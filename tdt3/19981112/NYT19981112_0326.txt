On hearing that Newt had fallen, I immediately ran to my Roman history 
books. Newt's Republican warriors, according to the great engines 
of media baloney, had risen up suddenly and savagely against him. 
A mighty blow being swiftly struck by men he thought the dearest of 
comrades, Newt was fallen. ``Cannibals!'' he had cried in the desperate 
instant when he realized his end had come. I knew I'd read this story 
somewhere years ago. Something about some great man's old soldier 
buddies carrying his severed head around on a spear point. It had 
to be a Roman tale. Declining-and-falling Roman. Being bushwhacked 
by your own troops _ it wasn't a bit like Cicero having his throat 
cut by Mark Anthony's thugs. When Cicero saw that resistance was pointless, 
he tilted his head back to give the murderers easy access to his jugular. 
That was brave, undeclined old Rome. What's more, Cicero and Anthony, 
unlike Newt and his assassins, had never been friends. Anthony hated 
Cicero, had always hated Cicero, because Cicero had character. Anthony 
had no character at all, and he hated Cicero for having so much of 
it. Murdering Cicero was rotten, but it was an early Roman, not a 
declining-and-falling Roman, deed. In Cicero's days a Roman's enemies 
were his enemies, not his friends. I opened Gibbon's ``Decline and 
Fall of the Roman Empire'' to revisit Rome on the downhill slope. 
Newt's story was everywhere. It was the story of Alexander Severus, 
a young emperor like Newt. Alexander's predecessor, Elagabalus, was 
so corrupt that the army, which really ran the empire, murdered the 
disgusting lout and, says Gibbon, had ``his mutilated corpse dragged 
through the streets of the city, and thrown into the Tiber.'' That 
isn't precisely what Newt's Republicans did in 1994 to the Democratic 
bosses of the House of Representatives, except metaphorically, which 
is close enough. Needing an emperor fast, the Roman soldiers quickly 
installed Alexander. Like young Newt coming unexpectedly to power 
in the House after routing the old Democratic regime, young Emperor 
Alexander was destined to learn that glory can be short-lived in a 
declining empire. The Roman soldiers _ a nasty and corrupt bunch at 
this stage of history _ were disappointed by Alexander's inability 
to sweeten their existence, so had him killed, possibly by his own 
guards as he slept, though Gibbon is inclined to think he was given 
a hearing of some sort and showed a deplorable lack of Ciceronian 
character. ``... unavailing cries and entreaties disgraced the last 
moments of his life,'' writes Gibbon, ``and converted into contempt 
some portion of the just pity which his innocence and misfortune must 
inspire.'' Gibbon would have approved of Newt's behavior on learning 
that his hour had come. After that first startled outburst about ``cannibals,'' 
he did not invite posterity's contempt by disgracing his last moments 
with unavailing cries and entreaties. Instead, while cameras looked 
on, he flung himself into warm and smiling embrace with congressman 
Livingston, the good friend whom Newt had made chairman of a vital 
House committee and was now revealed as the author of his ruin. And 
what of congressman Livingston, whose reputation for wisdom, genius 
and good fellowship is now enjoying the media buildup granted all 
newcomers to offices of power? I'm reading on in Gibbon. Rome's military 
emperor-makers have murdered Alexander so they can give the emperorship 
to one of their favorite generals, a Thracian peasant named Maximin. 
The army loves him, as the House Republicans who once loved Newt now 
love congressman Livingston. Soon, however, Maximin's capital is exhausted. 
He is behaving badly toward women and children, not to mention politicians 
and the media. Worse, the soldiers feel Maximin is making them work 
and fight under hardship conditions. And so Maximin, ``abandoned by 
his guards, was slain in his tent'' with his son and chief aides. 
``The sight of their heads, borne on the point of spears,'' says Gibbon, 
convinced Romans that happy days were there again. They weren't. Good 
night, Newt.
