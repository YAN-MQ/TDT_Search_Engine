With talks on Mexican-European free trade beginning, French President 
Jacques Chirac on Thursday began an official visit to Mexico that 
officials said would improve economic ties between the two countries. 
Chirac, his wife Bernadette and a delegation of 50 officials and businessmen 
arrived around midnight on the first step of a trip that will also 
take him to the hurricane-devastated countries of Central America. 
The disaster of Hurricane Mitch, which killed nearly 10,000 people 
in Honduras and Nicaragua, almost overshadowed the long-term issues 
of Franco-Mexican relations. ``I want to express the profound emotion 
that France feels at the tragedy inflicted by Hurricane Mitch on Mexico's 
neighbor countries,'' Chirac said at the welcoming ceremony at Mexico 
City's military parade ground, the Campo Marte. Mexico's President 
Ernesto Zedillo in turn said Mexico was ``moved by France's decision 
to come to the help of our Central American brothers'' with aid and 
relief of debts for those countries. Chirac was to address Mexico's 
Congress later in the day. ``It is a very special moment in relation 
between Mexico and France,'' Mexican Foreign Secretary Rosario Green 
said this week, noting that France has promoted a European Union free 
trade agreement with Mexico. ``France wants to be your privileged 
interlocutor within the European Union,'' Chirac said at the welcoming 
ceremony, adding that it would push to complete the free trade pact.
