The gap in the heart disease death rate between blacks and whites 
has widened since the 1980s, the U.S. government said Thursday. The 
Centers for Disease Control and Prevention reported that in the 35-to-44 
age group, 38.2 blacks per 100,000 died of heart disease each year 
from 1981 to 1985, compared with 24.3 whites. By 1991-95, the black 
death rate had dropped to 26, but the white rate had decreased as 
well, to 15.7. That is a ratio of 1.66 black deaths to one white death, 
compared with 1.58-to-1 in 1981-85. The gap was even greater between 
black and white women: Twice as many black women as white women ages 
35 to 54 died of heart disease between 1991 and 1995. The CDC researchers 
blamed a higher prevalence of risk factors among blacks such as smoking, 
diet and diabetes. They said the disparity also could reflect genetic 
and biological differences as well as less access to medical care. 
Although death rates began to even out in people older than 65, there 
were differences in all younger age groups. The gap for people ages 
45 to 54 went from 1.34 black deaths for each white death in 1981-85 
to 1.54-to-1 in 1991-95. In the 55-to-64 age group, the black-to-white 
death ratio went from 1.22-to-1 to 1.34-to-1.
