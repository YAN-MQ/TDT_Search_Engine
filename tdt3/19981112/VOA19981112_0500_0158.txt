Japan's ruling party has announced outlines of a government plan, 
the biggest package of its kind so far, all of this to improve the 
nation's lagging economy. Steve Herman reports from Tokyo the measures 
are directed at individuals, corporate Japan, and the nation's ailing 
financial system. Japan's governing liberal democratic party is unveiling 
a new package of economic stimulus measures. The package, expected 
to be finalized later in the month, totals more than $80 billion. 
It includes income tax cuts, the lowering of Japan's high corporate 
taxes, and public work spendings. The announcement comes just two 
days after President Clinton called on Japan to do more to help provide 
economic growth in Asia. Japan is seen as key to preventing a further 
slide in the overall Asian economy. Mr. Clinton is scheduled to make 
a state visit to Japan next week, and U.S. and Japanese government 
officials here say Tokyo is keen to have in place concrete measures 
by then to show the United States and the rest of the world that Japan 
is taking steps to help itself and the rest of Asia. Steve Herman, 
for VOA News, Tokyo.
