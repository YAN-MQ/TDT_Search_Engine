I'll be right back with the heroic efforts of American veterans in 
central america. House call... from extra strength Tylenol. Your medicine 
cabinet. You use it every day. But do you really know what's in there? 
Not everything. no. I never thought about it. My medicine cabinet? 
Well, it pays to take a good look in your medicine cabinet. You might 
be surprised to find... that you may have a prescription drug... that 
could interact with an over-the-counter medication, altering the effectiveness 
or safety... of one or both of the drugs. So here are some tips... 
for you and your medicine cabinet. First, read the label for any warnings 
about drug interactions. Then get rid of all out-of-date medicines... 
and those you don't take anymore. Who needs 'em? And if you're one 
of the millions of people... who takes a prescription drug, remember, 
the pain reliever associated with the least risk... of drug interaction 
and side effects... is the medicine in Tylenol. So check out your 
medicine cabinet. Any questions? Check with your doctor or pharmacist. 
Tylenol house call is brought to you by extra strength Tylenol. Dr. 
Scholl's next stop: San Francisco. Let's talk about feet. I do have 
corns. I've tried band-AIDS. They don't get rid of the corn. This 
is Dr. Scholl's cushlin gel corn removers. The cushlin gel relieves 
the pain. The medicated disk removes the corn. It just feels so much 
better. My work here is done. The potential of a true sports car is 
something you experience, you feel. That first 300 became a legend 
in its own time. The all-new '99 Chrysler 300m to get the feel of 
this automobile you really have to drive it. It holds the road with 
.. the widest stance of any other car in its class. The Chrysler 300m. 
The technology has changed but the soul lives on.
