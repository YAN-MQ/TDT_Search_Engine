Most Americans shopping for hamburger or stewed tomatoes lately have 
probably noticed new kinds of grocery stores offering more kinds of 
exotic fruit, caseloads of staples, even Italian cooking classes. 
Unless, that is, they live in or near New York City. Though New Yorkers 
still have the best selection of olive oil and salmon at places like 
Zabar's, Balducci's and D'Agostino's, many of the changes under way 
elsewhere in the food retailing business have bypassed this complex 
market. Roads into the city are too narrow for caravans of huge grocery-delivery 
trucks. Large lots to erect new stores are scarce. And operating costs 
in the metropolitan area are steeper than, say, in Cleveland or Kansas 
City. ``New York has always been a sort of poison pill,'' said Ken 
Harris, a partner with Cannondales Associates, a consulting firm that 
advises supermarket chains around the country. ``The barriers to entry 
here are so high that you really have to look long and hard at the 
bottom line.'' Large chains like Kroger and Safeway have been snapping 
up competitors around the country and putting up bigger stores with 
more bells and whistles. ``I don't see it happening in our community, 
just because the opportunity is not there to acquire chains as easily,'' 
said Nicholas D'Agostino Jr., chairman and chief executive of D'Agostino 
Supermarkets Inc., which operates 25 stores in the New York area. 
``Also, the return isn't there,'' D'Agostino said. ``I don't think 
the big guys want to come in and waste their time.'' The quirkiness 
of this market extends to New York's suburbs. In Westchester County 
and other outlying areas, chains like Grand Union and A&AMP;P have 
struggled for years. Available land, the high cost of union labor 
and other factors make the market less attractive to outsiders. So, 
at least for now, it seems that Grand Union, D'Agostino's, Pathmark 
and Gristedes will not have to fret that Kroger or Wal-Mart might 
edge in on their turf. The unusual problems of the New York market 
``are certainly a factor anytime you look at expanding,'' said Lynn 
Marmer, a spokeswoman for Kroger. Wholesalers and distributors also 
face less threat from suppliers looking for new opportunities as chains 
elsewhere push out the middle man. ``They don't affect us,'' said 
Richard Neff, executive vice president and chief financial officer 
of White Rose, the food distribution division of Di Giorgio Corp., 
which serves the Northeast. His counterparts in other regions tend 
to shy away from this market because ``there are a lot of problems 
in operating in New York, cost being one of them,'' he said. In places 
like Atlanta and Charlotte, N.C., where competition and price wars 
have intensified, shoppers have become spoiled by all the attention 
aimed at their food dollars. In stores in those markets, consumers 
have come to expect not just bargain prices, but wine experts who 
can suggest which burgundy goes best with what cut of beef, aisles 
wide enough for carts to pass without bumping, and even health clubs 
for working off the damage done at the pastry counter. But D'Agostino 
said New York supermarkets also provide the best value for shoppers' 
money in a much more difficult environment. ``Don't compare Manhattan 
supermarkets with a suburban store on an item-for-item price basis,'' 
D'Agostino insisted. ``We don't offer 25-pound bags of dog food and 
10-pound bags of Tide detergent, only because the majority of the 
customers we serve live in apartments and are looking for smaller-quantity 
sizes. Also, we are paying very high real estate.'' And it is not 
just other grocers that supermarket operators in New York have to 
contend with. This, after all, is a market where instead of having 
drive-through windows, some McDonald's restaurants deliver Big Macs. 
``The consumer in New York,'' D'Agostino said, has ``so many alternatives.''
