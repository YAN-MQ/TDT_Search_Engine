The state department is issuing a travel warning, and airlines are 
working to streamline aircraft production. Lori Waffenschmidt has 
those stories and more in this edition of "working ahead." Due to 
increased tension in the Persian gulf, the U.S. state department advises 
Americans to consider departing Israel and Kuwait. We put out, occasionally, 
travel warnings when the situation in an entire country is problematic. 
And we would recommend that people defer travel to that particular 
country. There is no indication how long the travel warning will be 
in effect. Head to the Internet at travel.state.gov for further updates.
