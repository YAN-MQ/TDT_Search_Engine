Hundreds of jittery British tourists broke off their holiday at a 
southern resort Thursday and Israel opened gas mask distribution centers 
for its citizens as the U.S.-Iraq showdown over weapons inspections 
intensified. However Israeli officials said they believed the possibility 
of an Iraqi retaliatory attack on Israel, as was the case during the 
1991 Gulf War, was slim and Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu said 
he wasn't even sure if he had a gas mask at home. Netanyahu stressed 
that Israel does not want to be part of what he termed as ``a real 
crisis'' over United Nations weapons inspections but wasn't taking 
any chances. ``We have to take the necessary precautions,'' he told 
reporters. For Israelis, it was the third time in one year that they 
have been asked to prepare for the possibility of an attack. But unlike 
during tense flare-ups last November and in February, the general 
public seemed to be taking a wait-and-see approach Thursday. ``I think 
people are very much weathered by the whole thing. It's been like 
a cry-wolf scenario for a year and we can't know what will happen,'' 
said Amber Landeau, a 25 year-old from Tel Aviv. In February, panic-stricken 
Israelis rushed to exchange gas masks for newer models with fresh 
filters. Fighting broke out at several centers over protective gear 
for infants. There was a shortage of plastic sheeting used for sealing 
rooms against chemical or biological weapons and Israeli pharmaceutical 
companies began manufacturing antidotes. But February's Iraq crisis 
ultimately was defused after U.N. General-Secretary Kofi Annan secured 
a commitment from Baghdad to allow U.N.-mandated weapons inspections 
of Iraq to continue. Thursday, only a trickle of people showed up 
at the 65 gas mask centers opened around the country. ``My daughter 
persuaded me to go,'' said Ariel Schindler, 83, as he prepared to 
go inside. Palestinian leader Yasser Arafat urged the United States 
to exercise restraint Thursday and avoid striking at Iraq, a move 
he said would be detrimental to the Mideast peace process. He said 
he had sent an envoy to Baghdad to help mediate the situation. Arafat 
supported Iraqi leader Saddam Hussein in the 1991 Gulf War in which 
Iraq fired 39 Scud missiles at Israel. However, the Palestinians have 
remained neutral in subsequent crises. Palestinian negotiator Hassan 
Asfour said that an attack on a fellow Arab nation by the current 
sponsor of the Mideast peace process could ignite popular street support 
and place Arafat in a difficult position. A senior Israeli official, 
who spoke on condition of anonymity did not rule out Thursday the 
possibility that Saddam would strike at the Jewish state again if 
attacked by the United States. But the prime minister's office downplayed 
the possibility. ``We feel that the chances of any kind of attack 
are ... close to zero, but as long as there is any possibility at 
all, we have to be prepared,'' he said. Meanwhile, some 600 British 
tourists prepared to leave the Red Sea resort of Eilat after the British 
government issued a travel warning to its citizens in the area due 
to the Gulf crisis. The United States and Canada issued similar travel 
advisories to its citizens as well. Israel's tourism minister, Moshe 
Katsav sharply criticized the move, calling it ``rash, harmful and 
superfluous.'' he said Israel would distribute masks to tourists should 
the need arise.
