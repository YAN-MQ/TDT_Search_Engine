The last time America sent forces to the Gulf to attack Iraq, the 
defiance in Baghdad was perhaps matched only by the outrage in the 
rest of the Arab world. Palestinians paraded a model of an Iraqi Scud 
missile, Yemenis jumped off buses to join anti-American protests and 
police used attack dogs to keep demonstrators in Jordan at bay. The 
mood's different now. All sides, at least publicly, still urge a diplomatic 
solution. But there seems to be much more resignation that an attack 
is inevitable. ``Kuwait cannot stop a superpower from taking certain 
steps,'' said Sheik Sabah al-Ahmed al-Sabah, the Kuwaiti foreign minister. 
Twenty-five more U.N. employees left Iraq on Thursday, joining 233 
U.N. inspectors and relief workers who departed a day earlier _ a 
move widely seen as a precaution against an American strike. The United 
States and Britain have made clear they are willing to attack Iraq 
for its Oct. 31 decision to halt the activities of the U.N. Special 
Commission, which is responsible for eliminating Iraq's weapons of 
mass destruction and programs to build them. Sanctions imposed after 
Iraq's 1990 invasion of Kuwait can only be lifted once the commission 
certifies its work is done. But Iraq believes the United States, in 
particular, will never allow the commission to make such a decision, 
making any cooperation futile. Few in the region feel Iraq is prepared 
to back down. ``The question now is what will this strike be like? 
What will its size be and what will be the end?'' asked columnist 
Abdullah al-Shayegi in Kuwait's Al-Watan newspaper on Thursday. In 
Egypt, the most popular opposition newspaper, Al-Wafd, carried a banner 
headline on Thursday: ``The countdown begins for the strike on Iraq.'' 
No Arab government would endorse an attack on Iraq, a politically 
disastrous move that would run the risk of further inflaming widespread 
public anger at Washington's steadfast support of Israel and sympathy 
for the Iraqi people. An attack would bring _ as Qatar's foreign minister 
put it _ ``further catastrophes.'' ``I see it as my duty to warn of 
the dangers of prolonging the conflict between the U.N. inspectors 
and the Iraqi government,'' Egyptian President Hosni Mubarak said 
Wednesday night. However, diplomacy this time seems to be less active 
and less vocal. During the last crisis with Iraq in February, Arab 
League Secretary-General Esmat Abdel-Meguid took the unusual step 
of flying to Baghdad to meet President Saddam Hussein. No such move 
has been suggested this time. On his recent tour of the Gulf, Egypt 
and Jordan, U.S. Defense Secretary William Cohen told Arab leaders 
that the governments should keep criticism to themselves if they did 
not agree with an attack, said Arab diplomats, speaking on condition 
of anonymity. Many Arabs see Western double-standards in the treatment 
of Iraq and Israel. Many Arabs ask why Washington does not apply the 
same zeal in bringing about a permanent agreement in Israeli-Palestinian 
talks. ``This duplicity in American policy, the flagrant hostility 
to Arab rights and the extreme bias in favor of Israel has proven 
that the American administration has no credibility,'' said Tishrin, 
a Syrian newspaper that speaks for the government.
