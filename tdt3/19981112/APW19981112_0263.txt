A government watchdog slapped South Korea's five biggest conglomerates 
with dlrs 16 million in fines Thursday for illegally subsidizing weak 
subsidiaries. The fines _ the second penalties against the top businesses 
since July _ came as the government of President Kim Dae-jung was 
urging the nation's conglomerates to make their finances transparent 
to rebuild investors' confidence in the Korean economy. ``We may investigate 
the top conglomerates again,'' said Park Sang-jo, a chief auditor 
at the Fair Trade Commission. Park added that a separate investigation 
was under way in smaller conglomerates accused of similar illegal 
trade practices. The Hyundai, Samsung, Daewoo, LG and SK conglomerates 
were accused of funneling a total of dlrs 1.15 billion into 21 of 
their shaky subsidiaries by buying their securities above market prices. 
Such a practice is illegal. Besides, the transactions left the weak 
subsidiaries with dlrs 42 million in illegal profits, the commission 
said. Hyundai, South Korea's No. 1 conglomerate, was slapped with 
the biggest penalty, dlrs 7 million. Samsung was fined dlrs 2.3 million, 
Daewoo dlrs 3.4 million, LG dlrs 1.7 million and SK dlrs 1.6 million. 
Although long illegal, the practice of cross-funding subsidiaries 
by conglomerates was condoned by the country's former military rulers. 
The conglomerates used cross-funding and cross-loan payment guarantees 
to fuel their rapid expansion. Their units were often accused of helping 
each other by buying or selling their services and goods above or 
below market prices in a bid to keep their scale of business intact. 
A typical Korean conglomerate, or chaebol, is controlled by a single 
family and has 40 to 50 subsidiaries, making everything from computer 
chips to cars and ships. President Kim is forcing the conglomerates 
to shed weak units to become leaner and stronger. In July, the commission 
slapped the five top conglomerates with dlrs 58 million in similar 
penalties. By law, the conglomerates can appeal the decision and if 
their appeal is rejected they can take the commission to court. The 
collapse of some of the weaker conglomerates fueled South Korea's 
financial turmoil last year, which forced the country to accept a 
record dlrs 58 billion bailout by the International Monetary Fund.
