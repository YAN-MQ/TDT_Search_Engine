Seton Hall University officials have ordered a student-sponsored event 
honoring Gov. Christie Whitman at the law school to be moved to an 
off-campus site because of the Governor's support of abortion rights. 
Three student organizations from the law school had been planning 
to present Whitman with the sixth annual Sandra Day O'Connor Medal 
of Honor in the law school's auditorium Monday. But after sending 
out dozens of invitations, the student groups were told by university 
officials earlier this week to move the event to the nearby Newark 
Club. ``Seton Hall has a clearly stated policy that no public recognition 
is given to those espousing positions contrary to our Catholic mission,'' 
Msgr. Robert Sheeran, president of the university, said in a statement. 
``This includes those publicly supporting pro-choice views.'' The 
decision surprised and offended the student groups _ the Seton Hall 
Law Review, the Seton Hall Legislative Bureau and the Seton Hall Women's 
Law Forum _ which spent months organizing the event. Student leaders 
noted that the award, honoring women for their achievements in law 
and public service, has been given in recent years to women who share 
Whitman's position on abortion rights. Past recipients at the law 
school include first lady Hillary Rodham Clinton and O'Connor, an 
associate justice of the U.S. Supreme Court. The dispute between the 
university officials and the student organizations was first reported 
in The Star Ledger of Newark on Thursday. In a statement, the student 
group leaders, Tiffany Werner, Keri Logosso and Dominick DiRocco, 
said, ``Many members of the law school community are offended that 
the university has reduced the achievements of the first female governor 
of the state of New Jersey to a debate on abortion.'' Whitman was 
on vacation and unavailable for comment. A spokeswoman, Julie Plocinik, 
said the governor was honored to be receiving the award. University 
officials said the student organizations had not notified them that 
they were planning to honor Whitman until after they had extended 
the invitation. ``Because this invitation was extended and accepted 
before the university administration was aware of it, Seton Hall has 
decided not to publicly rescind this event,'' Sheeran said in his 
statement.
