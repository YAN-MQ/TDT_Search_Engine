This is VOA News. I'm Steve Norman in Washington. The United Nations 
Security Council plans to discuss the Iraq crisis with Secretary General 
Kofi Annan who returns to New York today. He's cutting short his visit 
to North Africa. Counsel held an emergency meeting on Wednesday and 
reaffirmed its demand that Iraq resume cooperation with the U.N. weapons 
inspectors. The session was held at the request of Russia, which opposes 
the use of force in dealing with the standoff between the U.N. and 
Baghdad. Sergei Lovrov is the Russian ambassador to the United Nations. 
To use the force in this particular situation is going to be very 
dangerous from the point of view of the U.N. ability to keep its monitoring 
capacity in Iraq and also from the point of view of the security in 
the Persian Gulf region and the Middle East area. The United States 
is continuing preparations for a possible military action to force 
Iraq to comply with U.N. demands. Meanwhile, British Prime Minister 
Tony Blair says something needs to be done now to get inspectors back 
on the job in Iraq. If not, he believes, the Iraqis will build up 
their arsenal of weapons. It is clear from the evidence that he will, 
if unchecked, try to develop weapons of mass destruction. And the 
evidence uncovered recently by French and Swiss officials of the attempts 
to decontaminate warheads are further evidence of that. British Prime 
Minister Tony Blair.
