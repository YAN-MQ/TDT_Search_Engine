The cease-fire being observed by Northern Ireland's most ruthless 
pro-British paramilitary group is genuine and should be rewarded, 
the British government announced Thursday. Northern Ireland Secretary 
Mo Mowlam's decision marked a dramatic turnaround in fortunes for 
the Loyalist Volunteer Force, which began slaying Catholics at random 
three years ago in hopes of derailing Northern Ireland's peace process. 
It could pave the way for the group's approximately 30 imprisoned 
members to be freed early under terms of April's peace accord. More 
than 200 prisoners from the Irish Republican Army and the two biggest 
pro-British armed groups, the Ulster Defense Association and Ulster 
Volunteer Force, already have been freed in recognition of their cease-fires. 
But when the Loyalist Volunteers called a cease-fire in May _ one 
week before voters in both parts of Ireland ratified the peace agreement 
_ most observers dismissed it as temporary. Since then, however, the 
group has appointed an emissary to deal with an international commission 
seeking the gradual disarmament of Northern Ireland's myriad underground 
armies. Unlike other armed groups that have observed much longer truces, 
the Loyalist Volunteers have offered to hand in some weaponry if the 
British government recognized their truce. ``I am now satisfied that 
they have established a complete and unequivocal cease-fire, and over 
a significant period of time ... they have demonstrated that that 
cease-fire is being maintained,'' Mowlam said in a statement. The 
IRA, which killed more than 1,800 people in hopes of abolishing Northern 
Ireland as a Protestant-majority state, has observed a truce since 
July 1997. And the UDA and UVF, responsible for slaying 900 mostly 
Catholic civilians, have observed truces since October 1994. Alex 
Maskey of the IRA-allied Sinn Fein party criticized Mowlam's decision, 
calling the Loyalist Volunteers' truce a ploy designed to put pressure 
on the IRA to disarm, something the IRA refuses to do. Mowlam decided 
not to recognize as genuine two cease-fires being observed by anti-British 
rivals of the IRA _ the Irish National Liberation Army and the so-called 
Real IRA, which was responsible for an August car bombing in the Northern 
Ireland town of Omagh that killed 29 people and injured more than 
330 but since has called a truce.
