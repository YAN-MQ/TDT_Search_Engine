This week we've been taking "A closer look" at genetic engineering, 
tonight, the incredible potential of another new discovery. We -- 
stem cells in the lab. Those are the cells which are basically the 
building blocks of the body. This week, yet another advance. Making 
stem cells by combining cells from humans and cows. ABC's John McKenzie 
explains. The human body is made up of more than 100 billion cells, 
each one playing a very specific role in the heart and the lungs and 
the brain. But one type of primitive cell will create any tissue, 
anywhere in the body. It's called an "embryonic stem cell." Now, scientists 
in Massachusetts say they've found a way to turn some of your own, 
highly-specialized cells into those basic, all-purpose stem cells. 
It involves the stuff science fiction, creating embryonic cells that 
are part human, part cow. Cow eggs. We have a lot of information because 
we've used those in cloning procedures before. They're readily available. 
If it works, this approach has huge implications. These hybrid stem 
cells could be used to replace any of your own cells that aren't working 
right, treating Parkinson's disease or diabetes or heart disease. 
The potential in developing approaches to treat disease is absolutely 
vast. In theory, it could even be used to grow your own replacement 
body parts, including the kidney and bladder, lungs and cartilage. 
Since they'd be your own cells, there wouldn't be the problem of ejection. 
According to research team, in this technique a scientist took an 
unfertilized egg from a cow and removed its nucleus, the command center 
containing all the cow's genes and DNA. The scientist then took on 
of his own cells, scraped from the inside of his cheek, and fused 
it with what remained of the cow's egg. Quickly, the human nucleus 
began to take control. The result, an embryo that divided and grew, 
creating a cluster of what appeared to be human embryonic stem cells. 
This research has yet to be formally reviewed by scientists. Those 
working on the project first wanted to see how comfortable the public 
would be with creating these new embryos with crossing the barrier 
between humans and other species. John McKenzie, ABC News, New York.
