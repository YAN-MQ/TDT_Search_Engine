It was a close vote and it came after several delays, but the Israeli 
cabinet has ratified the new Middle East interim land-for-security 
agreement approved in Maryland last month. Israel says its withdrawal 
from 13% more of the West Bank by the end of january is contingent 
upon the Palestine national council. Israel wants the council to hold 
a formal vote to revoke a clause in the palestinian charter that calls 
for the destruction of Israel. Israeli prime minister Benjamin Netanyahu 
says his country may invoke the right to annex parts of the West Bank. 
Let's say if the Palestinians declared the establishment of a Palestinian 
state, then we reserve the right to apply Israeli law to the security 
areas, to the Jerusalem area, to the areas of settlement and other 
matters which were accepted as vital national interests of the government 
and state of Israel.
