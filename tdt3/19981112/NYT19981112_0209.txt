A combination of strong acting and missing substructure turn ``River 
Red'' into a mixed blessing. A grim portrait of brotherhood, brutality 
and the psychological consequences of guilt, this film is written 
and directed by Eric Drilling, who adapted it from his one-act play 
about two brothers. On the screen as in the theater, where he was 
the director, Tom Everett Scott inhabits the pivotal role of Dave 
Holden, the elder of two brothers living with their alcoholic, sadistic 
father in a bleak New Hampshire town. For reasons never clarified 
and barely hinted at, the father (Denis O'Hare) beats the younger 
brother, Tom (David Moscow), from childhood on. Years later, as the 
violence continues, Dave takes matters into his own hands. One night, 
as Father lies sleeping beside his liquor bottles, Dave stabs him 
to death. Tom, a sharper mind, decides to confess to the killing to 
save Dave from an adult prison term. So while Tom goes to a juvenile 
home for a few years until he reaches 21, Dave drifts into tormented 
dysfunction. Jobless, disassociated from Tom, befriended only by a 
sympathetic young woman (Cara Buono), he begins to resemble his father. 
He drinks heavily, grows more physically violent and eventually turns 
to armed robbery of convenience stores to support himself. And when 
Tom is released from his punishment for a crime he never committed, 
the stage is set for a release of volatile emotions. Although the 
pace slows at times, the leading and supporting roles are well performed. 
Steven Schlueter, a co-producer who is also the director of photography, 
ably evokes the isolation of the area where the brothers live, and 
a score by Johnny Hickman of the group Cracker enhances the action. 
But given the strong psychological elements of the story visible on 
screen, ``River Red'' incites a yearning to know more of father's 
motivations and more of Tom's life while incarcerated. ``River Red'' 
is rated R (Under 17 requires accompanying parent or adult guardian). 
It contains scenes of bloody murder and some foul language. PRODUCTION
