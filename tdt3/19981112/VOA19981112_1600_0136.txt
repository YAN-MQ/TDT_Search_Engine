Six Gulf Arab states, Syria, and Egypt, are urging Iraq to head U.N. 
resolutions and avoid a confrontation that they say will only hurt 
Iraqi civilians. Foreign ministers of the eight Arab countries say 
the Baghdad government will be responsible for consequences that arise 
from its decision to stop cooperating with U.N. weapons inspections. 
The ministers say they hope the crisis can be solved diplomatically, 
but some acknowledge a military conclusion is likely.
