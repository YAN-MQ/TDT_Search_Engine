The president of a top professional soccer team is being held for 
questioning on suspicion he participated in kidnapping and setting 
up right-wing paramilitary groups, prosecutors said Thursday. Gustavo 
Upegui of the first division Envigado club was detained Wednesday 
at the team's offices located near Medellin, Colombia's second largest 
city. Prosecutors said they would decide within ten days whether to 
charge or release him. Police sources have said Upegui is a leading 
drug trafficker as well, but prosecutors offered no details on any 
of the alleged crimes for which Upegui was being questioned. Colombian 
soccer executives, coaches and players have been implicated in numerous 
criminal probes, mainly into the influence of drug money on the sport. 
Until recently, drug traffickers owned many of the top professional 
teams. A former president of the national soccer league, Juan Jose 
Bellini, was released from prison last month after completing half 
of a six year term for illegal enrichment from drug trafficking. Prosecutors 
have also summoned Francisco Maturana, a Colombian who coached his 
country's World Cup teams in Italy and United States and now coaches 
Costa Rica, for questioning about allegedly receiving payoffs from 
the Cali drug cartel.
