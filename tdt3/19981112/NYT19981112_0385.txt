In the latest example of the effect that low oil prices are having 
on energy companies, Texaco Inc. said Thursday that it would cut 1,000 
oil-exploration jobs worldwide, or about 5 percent of its work force, 
as part of a cost-cutting effort that is intended to save $200 million 
a year. About 250 employees in Britain and 750 employees in the United 
States are expected to lose their jobs, including full-time employees 
in business and support areas such as public relations and information 
technology, as well as some independent contractors. Earlier this 
year, the company cut 100 jobs at its corporate headquarters in White 
Plains, N.Y., and agreed to lease about half of the office space to 
an outside company. The reorganization comes on the heels of a 58 
percent decline in third-quarter earnings at Texaco, the United States' 
third-largest oil company, and a string of recently announced cost-cutting 
efforts. A refining and marketing joint venture with Royal Dutch/Shell 
Group and Saudi Aramco, for example, is expected to cut $800 million 
a year in costs for the three companies beginning in 1999. Two other 
joint ventures are expected to save Texaco about $40 million a year. 
``Changes in the industry have fundamentally altered the competitive 
landscape, and Texaco must respond in order to improve its position,'' 
said John O'Connor, president of Texaco's exploration and production 
operations. The changes are also intended to place greater emphasis 
on Texaco's long-term production and reserve growth. Shares of Texaco 
rose $1.625 to close at $59.9375. Shares of most other oil companies 
and the price of crude oil also rose Thursday, but analysts attributed 
the gains to concerns that Persian Gulf oil shipments could be disrupted 
if the United States takes military action against Iraq. In announcing 
the reorganization Thursday, Texaco becomes the latest of the world's 
largest oil companies to make deep cuts to combat the continuing decline 
in energy prices. Earlier this week, Mobil Corp. promised $500 million 
in new cost savings and said that capital spending in 1999 would be 
lower than the projected $5.9 billion for this year. The new reductions 
are in addition to a three-year program of $1 billion of cost savings 
that began in 1996. And Unocal Corp. said it would cut spending by 
30 percent to 40 percent, or as much as $650 million, in 1999. Exxon, 
the country's largest energy company, whose third-quarter earnings 
declined by 23 percent, and Chevron have also warned that declining 
oil prices would crimp spending next year. Earlier this month, British 
Petroleum announced that its third-quarter profit fell a less-than-expected 
36 percent, to $445 million from $691 million in the quarter a year 
earlier. British Petroleum benefited from a 2-year old program to 
cut costs in its European refining operations. The company, which 
is buying Amoco, expects to gain $2 billion in savings once the combination 
is completed. Since the recent peak of about $20 a barrel in October 
1997, oil prices have declined steadily, hitting a low of $11.90 a 
barrel in June. In the third quarter, crude-oil prices averaged a 
little more than $14 a barrel, more than 25 percent less than their 
average price of $19.79 in the third quarter a year ago. The price 
represents the lowest average price in the third quarter since 1986. 
On Thursday, oil for December delivery rose 29 cents, to $13.84 a 
barrel. The latest moves by Texaco continued a reorganization prompted 
by the naming of Peter Bijur as chief executive two years ago, O'Connor 
said. As part of the reorganization, Texaco named several executives 
to lead the efforts. Claire Farley will become president of exploration 
and new ventures. She most recently served as president for North 
American production. Robert Solberg, formerly president for international 
production, in Asia, the Pacific Rim, West Africa and Latin America, 
will become president for commercial development. Clarence Cazalot 
Jr. will become president for production operations. He had been president 
for international production in Europe, Eurasia and the Middle East. 
Wall Street analysts offered mixed views on whether the latest round 
of cuts would be adequate. ``What they're doing is a Band-Aid for 
a much bigger wound,'' said Fadel Gheit, senior oil analyst at Fahnestock 
&AMP; Co. ``Some companies can't admit it's not business as usual,'' 
Gheit said, adding, ``I expect industry consolidation to pick up considerably 
in the next few months.'' In general, while the price of oil has declined 
about 40 percent, oil companies' cost-cutting moves will trim only 
about 5 percent to 10 percent of their costs, Gheit said. As a result, 
additional joint ventures, mergers and acquisitions are likely, he 
said. But Steven Pfeifer, senior oil analyst at Prudential Securities, 
said, ``This moves them well on the way to being competitive.'' Pfeifer 
thinks that oil prices will remain above their June lows through the 
end of the year, averaging about $14.85 a barrel in 1998 and rising 
to an average of $17.50 a barrel in 1999. ``We think we've seen the 
worst and things are going to improve in future quarters,'' he said. 
Texaco planned to remain independent but might be interested in acquiring 
smaller companies, O'Connor said.
