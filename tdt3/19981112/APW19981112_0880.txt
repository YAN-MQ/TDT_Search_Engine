Celebrities are arriving and governments are promising millions of 
dollars, but it's far from clear whether the show of solidarity will 
be enough to rebuild Central America after Hurricane Mitch. The storm 
that killed 10,000 people has set back the region's development by 
years, and many Central Americans say they have seen little sign of 
the promised foreign aid. A U.N. agency announced Thursday it was 
boosting deliveries of food aid to Honduras, Nicaragua, Guatemala 
and El Salvador, which were devastated by mudslides and floods. The 
Rome-based World Food Program said it would distribute more than 100,000 
tons of rice, corn, fish and oil over the next six months. ``With 
emergency assistance, these people are at extreme nutritional risk 
_ in addition to facing the threat of cholera and other diseases from 
unsanitary conditions throughout the region,'' said Catherine Bertini, 
the agency's executive director. As well as the United Nations, governments 
around the world have promised hundreds of millions of dollars in 
relief. In a radio address Wednesday, Honduran President Carlos Flores 
Facusse urged the United States to join other nations in forgiving 
Honduras' dlrs 4.3 billion debt and in backing new funds to create 
``a massive supply of fresh resources to aid in rebuilding the country.'' 
Honduras has little direct U.S. debt, but the United States plays 
an important role in international organizations to which Honduras 
owes money. With so much of Central America in ruins, the aid announced 
so far is likely to fall well short of the need. In Honduras alone, 
the Inter-American Development Bank has estimated that up to 90 percent 
of the country's roads and other infrastructure were destroyed.
