After lowering the key lending rate, Brazil's government has turned 
its attention to a long-awaited international rescue package that 
could prompt a further interest rate cut to boost the sagging economy. 
The Central Bank's Monetary Policy Committee lowered the annual interest 
rate Wednesday night from 49.75 percent to 42.25 percent. Brazil nearly 
doubled its key lending rate in September to halt the flight of investors 
after Russia's August devaluation raised fears of emerging markets. 
The country's foreign reserves have since fallen to around dlrs 43 
billion from dlrs 70 billion at the end of July. Capital flight continues, 
although at a slower pace. After posting a massive net outflow of 
dlrs 21 billion in September and October, Brazil's exchange market 
have lost a slimmer dlrs 66 million this month. The Central Bank's 
move was seen as ``modest and conservative'' by the powerful Brazilian 
Industry Confederation (CNI). In a strongly worded statement released 
Thursday the confederation warned that even after Wednesday night's 
reduction the country needed additional cuts. ``Keeping interest rates
