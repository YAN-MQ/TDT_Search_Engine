The European Commission, citing public health concerns, on Thursday 
proposed banning four antibiotics used in animal feed, to boost growth 
in pigs, poultry and other animals. European Union spokesman Gerard 
Kiely said ban would affect trade in the four products valued at ``hundreds 
of millions'' of dollars a year. The ban proposal stemmed from fear 
that the antibiotics could raise human resistance to medicines related 
to those used for animals, Kiely said. ``In the Netherlands the same 
resistant bacteria have been found in a poultry farmer and in his 
poultry,'' he said. EU farmers and the pharmaceutical industry are 
likely to object to the proposal to ban four antibiotics and review 
the four others that EU member nations can use as growth promoters 
in animal feed. Sweden has asked _ and has been granted the right 
_ to ban all eight and Finland and Denmark already prohibit several. 
A panel of animal nutrition experts from the 15 EU nations is reviewing 
the proposal and is to vote on the ban by December. If a majority 
does not back the ban, the measure goes to EU agriculture ministers 
for a decision. If passed, the ban would take effect Jan. 1. It would 
not affect imports, since those antibiotics are not known to be used 
in imported feed, Kiely said. In the past decade, the EU has banned 
15 antibiotics for public health reasons. The European Commission, 
the EU executive body, is recommending a ban on: Bacitracin Zinc, 
made by Alpharma AS of Norway; Spiramycin, made by Rhone-Poulenc SA 
of France; Virginiamycin, made by Pfizer Inc. of the United States; 
and Tylosin phosphate, made by Elanco of the United States, a unit 
of U.S.-based Eli Lilly and Co.
