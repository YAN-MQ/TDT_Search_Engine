A soccer fan in Berlin was reported to be in critical condition Tuesday 
after he was thrown out of a subway during violence following a soccer 
match Monday. The man suffered severe head and leg injuries as soccer 
fans vandalized subway wagons while traveling home from Hertha Berlin's 
match against Bayer Leverkusen. The rowdies tore up a seat and shattered 
14 windows in the subway while pushing the man out of the wagon between 
stops. The German sports agency, SID, reported 25 people were arrested, 
but police refused to confirm the figure.
