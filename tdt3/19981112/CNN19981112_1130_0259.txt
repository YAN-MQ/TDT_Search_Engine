A new study suggests that Alzheimer's disease may have an infectious 
basis. Researchers examined brain tissues of Alzheimer's patients 
after they died and found a bacterium had invaded brain cells in regions 
where Alzheimer's damage can be detected. The study's authors say 
they don't know if the bacterium helps cause alzheimer's or if it's 
a risk factor for the disease.
