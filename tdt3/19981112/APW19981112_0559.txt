Russia still hopes to find enough money to extend the life of the 
Mir, but has agreed to spend its scarce funds on the new International 
Space Station, the country's space chief said Thursday. Russia is 
to launch the first leg of the new station on Nov. 20, and the U.S. 
space agency NASA, a partner in the venture, wants Russia to abandon 
the 12-year old Mir space station and devote its meager resources 
to the new project. ``The question is whether the country is able 
to raise funds to continue both projects, and I think we should find 
this money,'' Yuri Koptev, head of the Russian Space Agency, said 
at a news conference. Koptev agreed that the new station should be 
the priority, but voiced hope that the Mir could stay aloft for up 
to two years longer than currently planned. As of now, it is to be 
abandoned around the middle of next year. ``If we find money, I think 
we will reach an agreement with our partners,'' he said. ``They don't 
consider Mir an obstacle, they are simply concerned about our lack 
of resources.'' The final decision on Mir's fate is expected in late 
December when the government comes up with budget estimates for the 
next year, Koptev said. Koptev spoke at the Cabinet session on Thursday 
to ask for funding that would allow his agency to fulfill its obligations 
with the new space station. Russia's has repeatedly failed to meet 
deadlines for constructing segments of the station, putting the entire 
project a year behind schedule. Sixteen countries are taking part 
in the station, which is expected to cost at least dlrs 40 billion. 
The station will serve as an orbital home for visiting astronauts 
and cosmonauts for up to 20 years. After several delays, the launch 
of the station's first segment, the 24-ton Zarya cargo module, built 
by Russia's Khrunichev company under contract with the U.S. company 
Boeing, is scheduled for Nov. 20. NASA is to follow up next month 
with an American-built passageway. The Russians are building the module 
that house the first crew, but it is expected to go up until the middle 
of next year at the earliest. Koptev strongly pushed the government 
for more funds, saying that the U.S. and other participants in the 
project were already exasperated with Russia's delays. ``Every year 
of delay costs Americans 2 billion dollars,'' Koptev said. Koptev 
stressed that the beleaguered space industry would only be able to 
stay afloat thanks to the new station, that would allow Russia to 
keep up to 80,000 jobs over the next 15 years. ``If we quit the project, 
that will leave us without a future,'' Koptev said. ``That would mean 
that our space industry would die within two or three years.''
