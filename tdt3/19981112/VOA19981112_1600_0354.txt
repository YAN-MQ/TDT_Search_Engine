U.S. military action against Iraq appears increasingly likely as thousands 
of American troops prepare to head to the Persian Gulf. The United 
States says it won't attack if Saddam Hussein complies with U.N. demands 
and cooperates with weapons inspections. Former chief U.N. weapons 
inspector David Kaye was one of the first U.N. inspectors to work 
in Iraq. During an ABC News interview today, Mr. Kaye said he believes 
diplomatic options have been exhausted. I think the effort is finally 
over eight years of lying, cheating, and deception. I think as disabused 
everyone of the idea that Saddam is ever going to live up to the obligations 
he entered into at the end of the war. The United Nations has removed 
most of its personnel from Baghdad, including the weapons inspectors 
and workers in the Oil for Food Program. And some observers say this 
is what Saddam Hussein wants, that he's willing to endure some military 
action in order to clear his country of anyone can monitor his weapons 
programs. Former Chief Weapons Inspector David Kaye agrees that that 
this could be Saddam's plan. Well, I think it's clear what he wants, 
but whether he gets what he what he wants depends on how hard we hit 
them. The military strike is heavy, and particularly if it is aimed 
at the instruments of terror that keep him in power, I think he may 
get something he does not want. Though Mr. Kaye expresses confidence 
about a strong U.S. response to Saddam's intransigence. He says nonetheless 
Iraq has formidable military hardware. The most fearsome combination 
of weapons he has or missiles, scuds left over from the Gulf War, 
shorter range vessels developed since, and biological weapons. Biological 
weapons are less effective as a military weapon, but as a terror weapon, 
they're awesome. David Kaye is the former chief U.N. weapons inspector 
in Iraq. He appeared on ABC television.
