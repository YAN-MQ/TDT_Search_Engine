Germany's new government will raise human rights concerns with China 
more openly than the previous administration, a senior official said 
in an interview published Thursday. Guenter Verheugen, a deputy foreign 
minister, said the approach would be part of a greater emphasis on 
human rights in German diplomacy by the center-left coalition that 
won September elections. ``The idea that one can't talk with China 
about human rights because that would threaten business is absolutely 
unfounded,'' he told the Rheinische Post newspaper. ``Leading German 
business executives tell me the Chinese respect us more if we talk 
clearly about what we don't like than if we quietly put up with it.'' 
Human rights will be ``a visible part of the program'' during future 
visits by German leaders, Verheugen said. Pressure groups and politicians 
on the left _ then in the opposition _ regularly accused former Chancellor 
Helmut Kohl of putting business ahead of human rights in dealing with 
China.
