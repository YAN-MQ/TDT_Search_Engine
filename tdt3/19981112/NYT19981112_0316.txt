On Monday, The Sun, Britain's most popular daily newspaper, printed 
a front-page editorial warning that Britain was being run by a cabal 
of gay men and urging gay members of Parliament to come out of the 
closet as quickly as possible. On Tuesday, it printed a photograph 
of Agriculture Minister Nick Brown, who had been publicly identified 
as gay over the weekend, wearing an unflattering regulation blue hair 
net on a tour of a dairy farm. But Thursday, in the midst of a countrywide 
debate over homosexuality, public office and the right to privacy, 
The Sun made perhaps its boldest move of all: It changed its mind. 
It said that it had a new policy: As of now, it would no longer reveal 
the identity of any gay man or woman, except in cases of ``overwhelming 
public interest.'' What's more, it said, it had made the decision, 
which flies in the face of its relentlessly anti-gay reporting and 
editorial writing over the years, because of a profound sea change 
in public opinion. ``Our readers are tolerant of private behavior 
and find unwarranted intrusion offensive,'' the paper said, going 
on to make an unusual (in its pages) plea for even more tolerance. 
``We hope our declaration will encourage gays to feel more at ease,'' 
it said. ``In a perfect world, their sexuality would then cease to 
be an issue.'' The editorial came after a series of strange events. 
First, the Cabinet secretary for Wales, Ron Davies, resigned in disgrace 
after being beaten up and robbed at a park known for being a gay hangout. 
Then, a gay columnist for The Times of London declared that Trade 
Secretary Peter Mandelson was gay _ something Mandelson had never 
publicly discussed. And then Brown, the agriculture minister, learning 
that an ex-lover had given a salacious interview to a Sunday newspaper, 
reluctantly told the world that he was gay, too. Until Thursday, The 
Sun led the rowdy press in gleefully reporting each new embarrassment. 
So in a country long accustomed to the newspaper's role as the most 
homophobic of the generally homophobic right-wing papers, the editorial 
was nothing short of astonishing. And, said supporters of gay issues, 
it was a long-overdue sign that even the most stubbornly anti-gay 
segments of the British news media were beginning to change with the 
times. ``It's the most extraordinary example I can remember of the 
press suddenly realizing that they've been left behind by their readers,'' 
said Benjamin Bradshaw, a Labor member of Parliament, who is openly 
gay. ``The Sun has historically been the homophobic tabloid, the one 
that hated gays, and now they've completely flip-flopped. The tabloids 
are usually so good at judging their own readership, but they've completely 
lost it on this.'' In another unexpected move, Sun editor David Yelland 
announced on Wednesday that he was dismissing Matthew Parris, the 
columnist who caused the furor last week when he said that Mandelson 
was gay. Mandelson has never publicly discussed the issue, and Parris' 
remark was seen as a gaffe of such huge proportions that the BBC banned 
all mentions of Mandelson's sexual orientation on its television and 
radio stations. (Parris also writes for The Times of London, which, 
like The Sun, is owned by Rupert Murdoch, but he has not been dismissed 
from that job.) It was unclear Thursday what had prompted The Sun's 
U-turn. Perhaps, as the paper implied, it had been deluged by a surge 
of complaints from readers incensed at what they regarded as offensive 
and outdated coverage. Jane Reed, a spokeswoman for News International, 
The Sun's parent company, said she could not explain why The Sun decided 
to do what it did.
