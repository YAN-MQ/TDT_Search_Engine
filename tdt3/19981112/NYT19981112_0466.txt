Circumstances took players in opposite directions Thursday; Steffi 
Graf was jubilant about her 11th-hour qualification for the year-ending 
Chase Championships next week at Madison Square Garden in New York, 
while fifth-ranked Venus Williams reluctantly withdrew from the tournament 
just before the draw was unveiled. For the 18-year-old Williams, whose 
tendinitis in her left knee has become as chronic as it is premature, 
the setback meant the postponement of her Chase debut for another 
year. Just last week, Williams predicted that her knee trouble would 
not intrude on her plans to use the Championships as prelude to her 
assault on the No. 1 ranking in 1999, but Thursday she recanted her 
optimism on that front. ``I would have loved to have been able to 
play the Chase this year,'' Williams said. ``Unfortunately, it's not 
possible because I'm not in the best possible condition and I wanted 
to be able to give my best to the players and the fans.'' The knee 
flare-up is the same problem that nearly caused Williams to scuttle 
her U.S. Open campaign two months ago, but she gave no indication 
that she might need surgery to repair it. For the surgery-prone Graf, 
29, the chance to compete in her 12th Championships was both therapeutic 
and redemptive. ``It's a way to save a not-so-great year,'' she said 
between singles assignments here at the Advanta Championships, a key 
Chase tuneup where the field includes top-ranked Lindsay Davenport, 
the U.S. Open champion, and second-ranked Martina Hingis. Graf's bid 
to join the Chase field was enhanced once Williams withdrew, which 
left vacancies in two of the 16 slots. When Monica Seles' 6-3, 7-5 
victory over Ai Sugiyama on Thursday afternoon knocked Sugiyama from 
Chase contention, Graf and Irina Spirlea were guaranteed the remaining 
berths. When Graf takes a 27-4 record against Jana Novotna, the defending 
champion of the Chase Championships, into next week's opening round, 
she won't be satisfied with simply getting there. That's not in her 
nature. But she will be gratified. That's being realistic. Now ranked 
17th, a long way from her former hold on No. 1, Graf had found herself 
in the interesting position of plotting simply to qualify for the 
event she had dominated as recently as 1996, when she outlasted Hingis 
in a five-set finale. ``After I won Leipzig on Sunday, we started 
counting the points I'd need to qualify for New York; well, I didn't 
actually count them, but the others were,'' Graf said. Until last 
year, when she missed the Championships while recuperating from knee 
surgery, the event had been a year-ending rite of passage for the 
German for 11 consecutive seasons. ``To get back to the Garden this 
year, and to do it in this way, is a pretty big deal, even for me,'' 
she added.
