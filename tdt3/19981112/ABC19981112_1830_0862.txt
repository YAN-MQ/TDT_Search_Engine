We do not wish to rush the Christmas season, though the retail business 
seems to beckon earlier every year. We are going to take "A closer 
look" at a revolution that is going on in the retail business. This 
is not the first year we have heard that shopping on the Internet 
is about to take off. So we're a little skeptical. But this year at 
this time, shopping revenue on the net is up more than 300% from last 
year. First, here is ABC's Gina Smith. New York's giant tree went 
up today, which can mean only one thing. But instead of getting in 
line, more Americans than ever this year will be going online. Barbara 
moser will be doing much of her shopping on the Internet. I'm not 
sure why people still go to the shopping centers and fight the traffic 
myself. Nearly 10 million households are expected to shop online this 
evening. It's a combination of things. More people are shopping online. 
There are more retailers online. This year we expect our Christmas 
sales to be at least 20 times what they were last year. Analysts say, 
television advertising for many first-timers, it brings some legitimacy 
to the idea. When people see a TV ad, they realize, hey, these guys, 
must be real guys, a real company, if they can spend this kind of 
money. One thing people are surprised to find once they shop online 
is that the merchandise costs about the same, but the thing they say 
hooks them is the convenience. Most of my online shopping is done 
after 10:00 at night after my children go to sleep. Online shopping 
still represents under 1% of all retail sales, and many people still 
feel nervous about it. Because I don't know how to use the Internet. 
But there's no ignoring momentum. It is the fastest growing shopping 
trend ever. Gina Smith, ABC News, New York.
