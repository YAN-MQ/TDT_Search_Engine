One type of cancer of the esophagus has increased more than 350 percent 
among white men in the past 20 years, and researchers say the reasons 
may include smoking and an increase in obesity. The study, released 
Thursday and published in the journal Cancer, reported that annual 
cases of adenocarcinoma rose from 0.7 cases per 100,000 in 1974-76 
to 3.2 cases per 100,000 in 1992-94. Nearly 90 percent of patients 
with esophageal cancer die within five years of contracting the disease. 
The study, based on already existing national data, was conducted 
by researchers from the National Cancer Institute and the International 
Epidemiology Institute. The researchers suggested one reason for the 
jump is an increase in obesity among white men over 65, and perhaps 
smoking. ``It goes back to prevention. This data all suggests that 
these are tumors that can be prevented,'' said Dr. John S. Ensley, 
a specialist at the Barbara Ann Karmanos Cancer Institute. The study 
looked at two kinds of cancer of the esophagus, which is the tube 
that carries food to the stomach. Adenocarcinomas are tumors that 
are almost always found in people with a condition known as Barrett's 
esophagus, in which the normal lining of the esophagus is replaced 
by abnormal cells. Barrett's esophagus occurs more often in overweight 
people, whose esophaguses are more likely to be inflamed and constantly 
damaged by stomach acid. The study claimed smoking may be to blame 
as well, but the rate of another esophagus cancer linked to smoking, 
squamous cell carcinomas, has declined from 3.4 cases per 100,000 
to 2.2 cases per 100,000. Adenocarcinoma rates in black males increased 
from 0.4 cases per 100,000 to 0.6 cases per 100,000. Squamous cell 
carcinoma rates among blacks remained at 13.2 cases per 100,000, higher 
than whites because of increased smoking among black men, the researchers 
said. Among women of all races, cases of esophageal adenocarcinomas 
rose from 0.1 to 0.4 cases per 100,000.
