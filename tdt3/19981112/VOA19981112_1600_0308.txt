The United States has signed a global warming treaty but President 
Clinton still faces an uphill battle to win Senate ratification of 
the agreement. A U.S. representative to the United Nations signed 
the treaty today in New York. All other major industrialized nations 
have already signed the pact which is aimed at reducing the emission 
of greenhouse gases blamed for global warming. Some U.S. senators 
have expressed strong opposition toward the agreement.
