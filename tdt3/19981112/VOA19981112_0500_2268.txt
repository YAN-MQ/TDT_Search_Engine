North Korea has again demanded cash compensation from the United States 
for the right to inspect its suspected nuclear sites. John Larkin 
reports from Seoul that the demands come as cracks appear in the 1994 
deal freezing North Korea's nuclear program. The renewal of North 
Korea's demand follows warnings by the U.S. State Department that 
the deal could be jettisoned. Under the $4.6 billion agreement, the 
North will be provided with two modern nuclear reactors if it freezes 
construction of nuclear facilities that have weapons making potential. 
The United States is concerned that North Korea is building an underground 
nuclear facility in violation of the pact. Photographs taken by a 
U.S. spy satellite showed thousands of workers tunneling into the 
ground 40 kilometers from Yong Biond, the site Pyung Young agreed 
to mothball under the 1994 agreement. The North says the construction 
has a civilian purpose but U.S. intelligence agencies believe it could 
be used to store banned nuclear equipment. The United States has threatened 
to withdraw from the deal unless Pyung Young allows an inspection 
team to enter the site. The issue will be central to talks this week 
in North Korea between a U.S. delegation and Communist officials. 
On Thursday, the North repeated it's demand through its official Korean 
Central News Agency for cash reparations after an inspection it said 
would prove the site is civilian rather than military. The KCNA report 
said the money would be adequate compensation for Washington's accusations 
which it described as slanderous. Next week's talks will be a crucial 
step in rebuilding confidence between Pyung Young and Washington. 
The nuclear deal has been played with tension arising from Washington's 
suspicions that Pyung Young wants to resume its suspect nuclear program. 
This is John Larkin for VOA News, Seoul.
