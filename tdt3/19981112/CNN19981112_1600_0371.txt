House Judiciary committee chairman Henry Hyde says the impeachment 
inquiry against President Clinton will begin next week as planned. 
Hyde refused to stop the hearing, as republican senator Arlen specter 
of pennsylvania wanted. Yesterday, specter called for an end to the 
impeachment inquiry because he said it is tying up the government. 
Specter believes President Clinton should be prosecuted in the Monica 
lewinsky matter after he leaves office.
