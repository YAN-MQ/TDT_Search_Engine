Federal authorities could be closing in on a man wanted as a material 
witness to the shooting death of Dr. Barnett slepian. The FBI says 
James Charles kopp has several ties to New Jersey, but officials would 
not specify what they might be. They also backed away from earlier 
claims that kopp may have been spotted in northern New Jersey. The 
FBI says that a photo they released of kopp could be outdated. Authorities 
say he may be 10 to 15 pounds heavier, may have a full beard and may 
wear glasses.
