HEMPSTEAD, N.Y. _ ``I've got to get myself a Bloody Mary,'' said comedian 
and visiting lecturer Alan King, an oil painting of William S. Hofstra 
looming sternly behind him at a reception Thursday morning. ``How 
can you have a Frank Sinatra conference without booze?'' They did 
their best at Hofstra University Thursday, as more than 1,200 scholars, 
friends, camp followers, colleagues and fans turned out for ``Frank 
Sinatra: The Man, the Music, the Legend,'' billed as the first academic 
conference dedicated to the entertainer whom the conference hailed 
as ``the pre-eminent personality of popular culture of the 20th century.'' 
Vic Damone sang. King told jokes. James Bruno, an education professor 
at the University of California at Los Angeles, opined on Sinatra 
as an expression of America's collective unconscious, and Rocco Marinaccio, 
an English professor at Manhattan College, delivered a paper titled 
``I Get No Kick from Assimilation, or `My' Frank Sinatra Problem.'' 
As pompous as the conference might have seemed at times, the participants, 
both serious and not-so-serious, seemed to agree that Sinatra deserved 
his day in academia, and that he probably would have enjoyed the spectacle 
had he been around. Indeed, the serious thinkers may have been ahead 
of the masses in waxing grandiloquent about Sinatra's legacy. ``Two 
millennia ago, a Roman Caesar crossed the Rubicon River and changed 
the course of civilization,'' Bruno said, beginning his talk Thursday 
morning. ``In the late 1930s, an Italian-American crossed the Hudson 
River from Hoboken, took on New York and changed entertainment history. 
He became the entertainer of the 20th century.'' The conference, which 
continues Friday and Saturday, will include talks on Sinatra and race, 
gender, class and philanthropy. A philosophy and iconography panel 
on Friday will include Elizabeth Liebman of the Getty Research Institute 
on `` `All of Me': The Cartesian Soul of Frank Sinatra'' and Edmund 
Santurri of St. Olaf College on ``Prophet, Padrone, Postmodern Prometheus: 
Moral Images of Sinatra in Contemporary Culture.'' Roger Borms of 
the Sinatra Society of Belgium perhaps wins the most obscure topic 
award for his eagerly awaited ``Frank Sinatra and Belgium.'' But, 
for all the heavy lifting, popular culture is already so entrenched 
in the academy that the most remarkable thing about the Sinatra conference 
here may be not that it happened but that it did not happen sooner. 
It might raise a few eyebrows, given that he is not one of the names 
regularly bandied about in academic circles, said Will Friedwald, 
author of the Sinatra biography, ``Sinatra! The Song is You.'' ``But, 
in a very real way, we're just continuing the work he began,'' Friedwald 
said. ``He was the first performer to realize what popular culture 
could be, the first to grasp that it could be serious, that it wasn't 
ephemeral, that there was real meaning there. If you put Leonard Bernstein 
and Laurence Olivier in the same person, it would be Frank Sinatra.'' 
Hofstra since 1976 has been putting on ambitious conferences, usually 
based around a single person, beginning with French writer George 
Sand and German dramatist and narrative writer Heinrich Van Kleist. 
Figuring they could get more for their money with figures a bit sexier 
than Heinrich Van Kleist, program organizers soon branched into presidents 
(all of them from John Kennedy through George Bush) and other popular 
figures. After a 1995 conference on Babe Ruth was a major success, 
organizers looked for another major cultural figure. ``We asked ourselves 
who else in the 20th century reached the same pinnacle in his field 
as Babe Ruth,'' said Natalie Dadlot, co-director of the conference. 
``And right away, we came up with Frank Sinatra. We really couldn't 
come up with anyone else who came close.'' Officials contacted Sinatra 
two years ago, and he and his family expressed their approval of the 
project. By the time it opened this morning, with his daughter Tina 
in attendance, the schedule included 43 panels, 120 professional papers, 
and presentations by 80 experts of various sorts. For good measure, 
there is an exhibit of art including Sinatra's own lithographs, movie 
and album art, and, probably unavoidably, paintings of Sinatra by 
the ubiquitous LeRoy Neiman. The conference, for three days at least, 
changed the look and feel of the campus here, adding an armada of 
middle-aged and older Sinatrans to the campus. Instead of the Dave 
Mathews Band or Dr. Dre, ``Fly Me to the Moon'' and ``I Get a Kick 
Out of You'' were wafting out of music speakers. On TV screens, Sinatra 
and Ella Fitzgerald were singing ``Ode to Billie Joe'' as if pulled 
from a distant corner of multiple time warps. Most of those in attendance 
seemed thrilled with the proceedings. ``It's really overwhelming,'' 
said Myron Krackow, a retiree from Woodmere, N.Y. ``I go back to the 
battle of the baritones, so it all means a lot to me.'' Students seemed 
a little less engaged. Some expressed dutiful appreciation of the 
man and named ``New York, New York,'' or other recent Sinatra standards. 
But others seemed to find him as ancient as Cicero. Asked about the 
conference, Evelyn Fischer, a 19-year-old student from Queens, could 
not name a Sinatra song or anything else about him. ``I know he was 
a singer,'' she offered. ``That's all.'' Given that Elvis Presley 
has had a scholarly conference for years, Sinatra, who became the 
subject of a new wave of scholarship and biography when he turned 
80 in 1995, was probably due his. And panelists said that longevity, 
his immigrant background, his political journey from Henry Wallace 
to Ronald Reagan, his status as a seminal pop icon, his evocations 
of changing notions of masculinity and sexuality were among the topics 
most of interest to scholars. Many admirers said the conference made 
sense not because he was so philosophically profound, but because 
he was so good at what he did. ``He held the barbarians at the gates 
for many years and now his work is a wax museum of the classic popular 
song,'' said Ervin Drake, the songwriter who wrote the Sinatra standard 
``It Was A Very Good Year.'' ``Frank was the ultimate genius,'' Drake 
said. ``That alone is reason to line up and pay tribute to the fact 
he passed this way. There has to be more to life than simply tormenting 
President Clinton.'' For many, the gathering was about reminiscence 
more than scholarship. ``I was at his wedding to Mia Farrow,'' King 
said. ``She was about 12, I guess. I said he didn't know whether to 
bed her or burp her.'' He said Sinatra might have been amused by some 
of the philosophizing, but he would have approved of the gathering. 
``He would have gotten a bang out of it,'' King said. ``He was a vociferous 
reader. He sucked up all kinds of knowledge, right or wrong. He was 
a vacuum cleaner for it, and he was impressed by erudite people. And 
he deserves this. He's Muhammad Ali. He's Horowitz. He's Picasso. 
The good and the bad it all played into his mystique. You could do 
a month on him, and still have plenty left over.''
