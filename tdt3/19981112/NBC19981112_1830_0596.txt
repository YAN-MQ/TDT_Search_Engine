After a 73-year run as one of this country's big three automakers, 
Chrysler corporation in effect retired tonight. Its merger with Germany's 
giant Daimler-Benz is in the final stage, and when the closing bell 
rang on Wall Street today, Chrysler's stock faded into whatever passes 
for Wall Street's never-never land. NBC's Jim Avila has more on the 
end of an era. Now it's the big two. Chrysler America's third largest 
automaker joins Mercedes Benz, forming a New transatlantic company, 
daimlerchrysler. But, eventually taking orders from Germany. At the 
Wall Street close this afternoon, Chrysler and its company symbol, 
"C," were taken off the New York stock exchange big board, the end 
of a Remarkable turnaround for a company that nearly went bankrupt 
in the '80s, but recovered on the strength of minivans, jeeps and 
the marketing of car man Lee Iacocca. Now Chrysler is profitable -- 
the ideal company for a merger because of its size and its speed, 
a streamlined company that designs new cars faster than its American 
competitors and makes more money per vehicle than GM or Ford. The 
key advantages that Chrysler has had over the last few years is, they're 
very nimble and very smart. Professor David Cole at the University 
of Michigan's automotive transportation department says Chrysler makes 
more profit on a $20,000 car than Mercedes does on a $43,000 car. 
Mercedes is interested in learning how to be much more flexible and 
adaptable. How did Chrysler do it? Auto experts point to less bureaucracy 
and quick decisions that take a car from computer drawing to showroom 
in two years, the best in the industry. What that means is, you're 
closer to the market, so you're closer to trends, you're closer to 
customer tastes. The design teams are close to each other -- one huge 
building nearly the size of the Pentagon. The first facility of its 
kind, 10,000 workers side-by-side in constant contact with the car 
under construction. They can put it in a wind tunnel, test it in bad 
weather, check noise reduction, drive it on smooth test tracks, rough 
test tracks. The latest car designed here, the 300m, first to be sold 
by the new Daimler chrysler overseas with a new partner. As the remaining 
big two watch closely. Jim Avila, NBC news, Chicago.
