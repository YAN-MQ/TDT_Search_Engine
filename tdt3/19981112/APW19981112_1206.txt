Dozens of ethnic Albanian hostages were released late Thursday, after 
Serb civilians took them hostage early in the day, Serb sources said. 
The Kosovo Information Center, close to the Kosovo Albanian leadership, 
first said 20 ethnic Albanians were abducted. Later, it said up to 
100 were taken hostage. The figures could not be independently confirmed. 
The Serb abductors were seeking the release of two fellow Serbs who 
went missing Wednesday in the central Drenica region. The Kosovo Information 
Center said some of those detained were threatened with ``liquidation'' 
unless the two Serbs were released. The ethnic Albanians were reportedly 
taken off a bus to the village of Crnac, 50 kilometers (30 miles) 
northwest of Pristina. Late Thursday, the Serb Media Center, close 
to the Serbian government, reported all of the hostages had been released. 
No further information was available and the report could not be independently 
confirmed.
