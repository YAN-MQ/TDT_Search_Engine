A New York literary agent who is friends with Linda Tripp has wrapped 
up her testimony before a Maryland grand jury. The panel is looking 
into whether Tripp broke state wiretap laws when she secretly recorded 
her phone conversations with Monica Lewinsky. Lucianne Goldberg also 
turned over two of the tapes to the court. Goldberg says she is to 
blame for Tripp's legal troubles because she told tripp the taping 
was legal. On the second tape, I tell her that I checked it out and 
it is legal, and I was -- had somebody go to the Internet and get 
the federal law. I didn't ask about state, so silly me. So she's in 
this mess because of you? Totally, totally. I take all the blame. 
The maximum penalty for breaking Maryland's wiretap law is five years 
in prison and a $10,000 fine.
