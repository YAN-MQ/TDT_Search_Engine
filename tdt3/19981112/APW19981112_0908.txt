DUESSELDORF, Germany (AP) _ SAirGroup AG, parent of Swissair and other 
carriers, advanced its goal of forging a European holiday flight group 
Thursday by acquiring a 49.9 percent stake in Germany's LTU Group. 
SAirGroup declined to reveal the value of the stake, but German media 
have placed it at about 2 billion marks (dlrs 1.25 billion). German 
investors own the remaining stake. SAirGroup said it will finance 
the transaction with its own cash flow and proceeds from the prior 
sale of four hotels in the United States. LTU, with total annual sales 
of close to 5 billion marks (dlrs 3.1 billion), ran a minuscule operating 
profit last year. But SAirGroup had its sights on LTU's 29 aircraft 
and its 2 billion marks (dlrs 1.25 billion) in annual leisure flight 
revenues, to complement its own small charter operations and those 
of its allies. SAirGroup itself has 133 aircraft. LTU flies 7.2 million 
vacationers a year, while Swissair alone flies 11.1 million passengers. 
SAirGroup made clear that it plans to eventually unload LTU's tour 
operator business, which has annual revenues of around 2.75 billion 
marks (dlrs 1.7 billion) and little profit. The real value of the 
LTU transaction lies in the fact that SAirGroup obtains a large share 
of the big German leisure flight market and fills out its charter 
operations and links in Europe. After merger talks among Swissair, 
KLM Royal Dutch Airlines, Austrian Airlines and Scandinavian Airline 
Systems collapsed in 1993, SAirGroup embarked on an alternative global 
strategy in forging alliances with carriers around the world. In Europe, 
these allies include Sabena, Austrian Airlines and other, smaller 
carriers. SAirGroup has minority equity stakes in several of them. 
The company also has other alliances, including with Delta Air Lines 
Inc. of the United States, Cathay Pacific Airways of Hong Kong, South 
African Airways, Qantas of Australia, and Malaysia Airlines. AS SAirGroup 
Chairman Hannes Goetz told a press conference, the agreement with 
LTU opens up new markets for both companies, brings synergies from 
a combined network, and harmonizes their fleets, catering and technology. 
He said Switzerland's absence from the European Union ``made it necessary 
to work with partners'' in order to assure the company's access to 
the vast European Union market, where rules require outsiders to remain 
minority shareholders. With SAirGroup's 10-member alliance of scheduled 
airlines already in place, dubbed ``Qualiflyer Group,'' Goetz said, 
``We've now shifted our attention to the charter and leisure travel 
business, where we hope to create a similar European grouping.'' SAirGroup 
chief executive officer Philippe Bruggisser added that LTU will keep 
its own identity. But he said ``the period of consolidation has begun 
in the airline business.'' He said ``correct'' strategies will elicit 
advantageous synergies. ``A European leisure travel grouping doesn't 
mean cutbacks,'' he said. ``It means growth and expansion.'' One area 
SAirGroup will seek to improve is LTU's meager 2 percent flight operating 
profit margin. SAirGroup's flight operations have a 4 percent margin.
