There is no ignoring momentum -- which brings us to a piece of "the 
cutting edge" technology tonight that is impossible to ignore. ABC's 
Jack Smith reports tonight on taking the Internet with you when you 
shop -- in a store. This is how we shop today. We hope we're getting 
the best price. But now there's brand new technology that uses the 
power of the Internet to automatically find the best price for us 
anywhere. A concept that may revolutionize shopping. This is the sort 
of thing that demonstrates how the Internet really changes the rules. 
Just scanning the book. The idea is to enter the bar code on merchandise 
into this specially-equipped, experimental cell phone. It then automatically 
dials into the Internet and hunts for the same merchandise at a better 
price somewhere else. When we show this to retailers, there's a collective 
drawing of breath. The designers took us to a store to show us why. 
It's just like scanning something in the supermarket? Exactly. This 
prototype of Internet bargain finder, as it's called, discovered in 
seconds, that this book, which retails for $27, sells elsewhere for 
as little as $22. All of the book shops here are selling it for less 
than the list price. Right. That's the point of the rocket bargain 
finder. You know where the cash Register is? Here. It's not really 
over there anymore. I'm making the sale here. I may buy here. Anything 
with a bar code can be compared this way. And the more that retailers 
go online, the more there will be for consumers to compare, and the 
more they gain the upper hand. Scientists think the device, which 
will eventually fit in your pocket, will turn shopping on its head. 
Instead of the merchant saying, here's what I have to sell, who wants 
to buy it? It's going to be the consumer saying, here's what I want 
to buy, who wants to sell it to me? But if that's a revolution, it's 
not one that makes retailers, especially small ones, happy. It will 
drive us out of business. It will drive the hardware, the mom-and-pop 
hardware stores out of business and will just go on and on. Maybe, 
but it will also benefit American consumers, a dramatic breakthrough 
that will use the growing power of the Internet to change what americans 
do every day. Jack Smith, ABC News, Palo alto, California. Shopping 
through the Internet is increasingly available to Americans. 25% of 
households now have access to the net.
