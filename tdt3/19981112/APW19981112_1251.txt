Israel angered Palestinians Thursday by giving the go-ahead for construction 
of a Jewish housing project in a disputed area of Jerusalem, but also 
pledged to begin turning over West Bank territory next week. Dennis 
Ross, the United States special Middle East envoy, is to arrive here 
Friday to oversee implementation of the nascent Mideast land-for-security 
accord, and Palestinian officials were already calling on him to help 
solve the latest disputes. ``It is now crucial to have the American 
side join us ... to oversee implementation of the agreement, '' said 
chief Palestinian negotiator Saeb Erekat. He told The Associated Press, 
``We will not accept any post-agreement negotiations and will not 
accept any conditions outside,'' the accord itself, signed at the 
White House Oct. 26. The issuing of construction bids for the Har 
Homa housing project sparked a minor row between Washington and Jerusalem. 
White House Press Secretary Joe Lockhart said the project was ``inconsistent 
with the spirit of the Wye agreement and with the need to create a 
positive atmosphere'' for peace talks. U.S. State Department Spokesman 
James Rubin called it ``a bad decision.'' In response, Prime Minister 
Benjamin Netanyahu's office issued a statement saying Rubin's comments 
``should never have been made.'' ``The decision to build on Har Homa 
is a sovereign decision of Israel. It has no connection to the Wye 
agreement,'' the statement said. Under the accord narrowly ratified 
by Netanyahu's Cabinet Wednesday, Israel is to carry out a staged 
troop withdrawal from 13 percent of the West Bank in exchange for 
Palestinian security measures. Israel's plans to hand over the first 
parcel of land by the end of next week, said David Bar-Illan, a senior 
adviser to Netanyahu. And there were signs on the ground Thursday 
that implementation of some aspects was close. At the Palestinian 
airport in Gaza, near the Egyptian border, Israeli and Palestinian 
officials drilled security procedures for checking passengers. Israeli 
soldiers were seen pulling equipment out of an army base in the West 
Bank, near the Palestinian village of Dura. It was not clear if the 
base is to be evacuated as part of the Israeli redeployment. However, 
Palestinians focused attention on Israel's decision to accept bids 
for construction at a Jerusalem hilltop Israelis call Har Homa and 
Palestinians know as Jabal Abu Ghneim. The hilltop is part of land 
Israel captured from Jordan and annexed after the 1967 Mideast war. 
The Palestinians hope to establish the capital of a future state in 
the area. Palestinian leader Yasser Arafat called the project ``a 
big obstacle,'' to peace, but stopped short of saying it would harm 
the peace process. Ground breaking there in January, 1997 for the 
6,000 homes planned for Jews, led to Palestinian rioting and a 19-month-long 
stalemate in negotiations broken after Netanyahu and Arafat signed 
the latest peace deal. Netanyahu has promised repeatedly the new homes 
would be ready there in 2000. Nabil Abourdeneh, an aide to Arafat, 
called the project and a series of new Israeli conditions on the peace 
accord, ``a violation of the ... agreement and of all agreements.'' 
Wednesday, Netanyahu warned that if the Palestinians go through with 
a plan to unilaterally declare independence when the interim peace 
accords expire in May, Israel will annex all West Bank territory it 
still controls. Arafat left the issue open, saying the issue of statehood 
could be negotiated. ``May 4 is the end of the five-year period we 
agreed upon in Oslo. If there are other ideas, I'm ready to listen,'' 
Arafat was quoted as saying.
