This is The World, I am Tony Kahn. When The Truman Show opens this 
weekend in Japan, the movie American audiences found fresh and inventive 
might seem old hat. For more than eight months, Japanese TV viewers 
have been watching a homegrown version of the story. Every week, they 
are tuning to watch Nasubi*. He is surviving in his apartment on whatever 
he can win from magazine contests, he knows it is weird, and he knows 
he is being filmed, what he does not know is that Japan is tuning 
in in big numbers. The World's Juliette Hindall* tunes in herself. 
Relishing a canned drink of coffee for the camera. It is another televised 
moment in the life of Nasabi. The 22 year-old actor spends his time 
in a tiny apartment trying to win free goods from magazines. He cannot 
eat unless he wins food and he is completely naked because he still 
hasn't won any clothes. His ordeal has already lasted more than 250 
days. The highlights of Nasabi's life are broadcast once a week as 
one of the items in a show dedicated to putting young people through 
endurance tests. Of course, it is all being filmed and the studio 
audience delight in each new mishap or triumph. As he crunches through 
one of his latest prizes, dry dog food, Nasabi does know he is being 
filmed. But he does not know why. His delight at winning is apparently 
genuine and inspires him to write little ditties about what he has 
won. While Nasabi exposes his every move to scrutiny, the show's producer, 
Toshyo Satia*, denies that he is exploiting a young struggling actor. 
TOSHYO SATIA, NASABI SHOW PRODUCER We are not holding the actor. He 
could leave at any time. The door is not locked. In return for being 
in this show, he will become a really big star. The contents of Nasabi's 
diary are read out on the show. Here he writes that he does not care 
what he eats, just as long as he wins something edible. His diary 
has been published as a book and is a best seller. As are videos of 
his life. But not everyone is hooked. Mary Koigiana* of the Hakuhodo* 
Institute in Tokyo says there is a generational divide. I think it 
is a rather bizarre and grotesque program. Older people find it a 
bit disgusting to have to even look at it. But younger people seem 
to enjoy. Nasabi moves apartments for the third time. His whereabouts 
are a closely guarded secret. Because the tabloid press keep trying 
to find him and discover whether he is for real. Japan is likely to 
keep watching Nasabi's every move until he has won a million-yen's 
worth of goods. Because when he reaches the target, or he gives up, 
or goes crazy, it is sure to be on TV. Reporting for The World, this 
is Juliette Hindall in Tokyo.
