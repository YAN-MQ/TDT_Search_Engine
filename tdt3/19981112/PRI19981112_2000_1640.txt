The head of the new European Central Bank promises to take it easy 
on the dollar when the Euro comes to life in January. Ms. George has 
more from our business desk in New York. Speaking at a business lunch 
in New York today, the president of the European Central Bank, Vin 
Doisenberg* outlines the impact the Euro would have internationally. 
He said the new currency will help Europe to wield an economic strength 
comparable to the U.S. Euro will be the currency of an economic area 
which will be roughly equal to the United States in terms of both 
its economic strength and the volume of its external trade. It will 
rank second in the world to the United States in terms of the size 
of its capital market. The introduction of the Euro will, therefore, 
have consequences for economies abroad and for the international capital 
markets. Over recent weeks, many economists have been predicting that 
the Euro could replace the dollar in its role of international default 
currency. But Vin Doisenberg promised there would be no intervention 
to boost the Euro against the dollar. The ESB will take a neutral 
stance. It will neither promote, nor hinder the development of the 
Euro as an international currency. ESB will accept the international 
role of the Euro as it develops through market forces. There will 
be no deliberate policy of challenging the U.S. dollar. The European 
Central Bank takes charge of monetary policy for the 11 European nations 
in January this year. And that is when the Euro will start to be used 
in financial transactions on world markets. But do not worry about 
looking for actual Euro bank notes in your wallets. They are not introduced 
until the year 2002. For The World, I am Liz George in New York.
