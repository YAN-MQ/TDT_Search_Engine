The United States plans to sign a treaty today at the United Nations 
designed to reduce global warming. Some 60 countries have already 
signed the Kyoto protocol reached last year in Japan. It aims to reduce 
the emission of global warming gases by an average of 5% from 1990 
levels with cuts scheduled to take effect between 2008 and 2012. Opponents 
say the agreement will hurt the economy. The U.S. produces a quarter 
of the global warming gases emitted each year.
