Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu opened bidding Thursday on a big 
state-run housing development in the predominantly Arab east side 
of Jerusalem that has been a flashpoint in relations between Israel 
and the Palestinians. ``It has been our policy all along that Jerusalem 
will not be divided again, and we will build in any part of Jerusalem 
that we deem worthy of building in,'' Netanyahu said defiantly at 
a news conference Thursday. The bidding was announced a day after 
a divided Israeli Cabinet approved the Israeli-Palestinian agreement 
on the next Israeli withdrawal from the West Bank, an accord that 
infuriated many right-wingers who had been allies of Netanyahu. The 
announcement was widely seen as a gesture to the disaffected right 
and was immediately criticized by the Palestinians. The action Thursday 
_ the publication of a legal notice inviting contract bids _ opens 
the way for building the first thousand units of the planned 6,000-home 
Har Homa subdivision. After the initial groundbreaking for the stalled 
Har Homa project in March 1997, the Palestinian Authority angrily 
broke off peace talks, beginning an impasse that continued until the 
negotiations last month at the Wye Plantation in Maryland. Members 
of Netanyahu's coalition who oppose the land-for-peace agreement have 
strongly urged that work on the Har Homa project be resumed. ``I have 
said for the last two years that I will build Har Homa before the 
year 2000,'' Netanyahu said. ``What I have said, I have done.'' The 
planned subdivision could eventually be home to 25,000 or more Jewish 
residents, fundamentally altering the political demographics of east 
Jerusalem. More immediately, Har Homa adds yet another obstacle to 
the increasingly contentious implementation of the peace plan. Palestinians 
consider any such project in east Jerusalem illegal, a contention 
Israel adamantly rejects. ``This is a major, major destructive move,'' 
said Saeb Erakat, the chief Palestinian negotiator. ``These are issues 
to be resolved with negotiations, not with bulldozers.'' Nabil Abu 
Rudaineh, a spokesman for Yasser Arafat, the Palestinian leader, called 
the housing project ``a clear new violation of an agreement that has 
not even started yet.'' He expressed concern that the project could 
provoke angry and possibly violent street protests in east Jerusalem. 
``The public won't accept it, and that will make it very hard for 
us'' in the Palestinian Authority, he said. The Palestinians said 
they had appealed to the State Department to ``intervene'' and seek 
a halt to the project. ``Dennis Ross is coming tomorrow, and this 
will be at the top of his agenda,'' said Erakat, referring to the 
American peace envoy. Arafat and the Palestinian negotiating team 
are scheduled to meet with Ross on Friday evening in Nablus in the 
West Bank. The Palestinians are also expected to raise the issue of 
Israeli land expropriations in the West Bank for new roads to Jewish 
settlements there. The Israeli cabinet decided Thursday to build a 
dozen more of these ``bypass'' roads, but agreed to postpone a proposed 
route through a Palestinian refugee camp after military briefers warned 
that it could trigger violent protests. The Har Homa dispute illuminated 
the seeming intractability of the biggest unresolved conflict between 
Israel and the Palestinians: the ``final status'' of Jerusalem itself, 
claimed by each side as its rightful national capital and historic 
religious center. ``Virtually all of it is private Jewish land within 
the Jewish capital,'' Netanyahu said Thursday referring to the Har 
Homa site. ``How this could be called a provocation is beyond me, 
but I suppose anything could be called a provocation.'' ``Jerusalem 
is not a provocation,'' he continued. ``It is our eternal value, our 
eternal rock. It is something that I don't care to deal with in a 
political context.'' Palestinians see Har Homa as a symbol of Israeli 
refusal to even discuss Palestinian claims to east Jerusalem, which 
Israel annexed after capturing it from Jordan in the 1967 Arab-Israeli 
war. ``If they go ahead with this project, it renders the final status 
talks meaningless,'' said Erakat. Secretary of State Madeleine Albright, 
who publicly criticized the groundbreaking for the project a year 
and a half ago, had a cool but restrained reaction this time. ``We 
frown on unilateral actions,'' she said when asked on Wednesday in 
New York to comment on reports that Israel was going ahead with the 
project. Still, Palestinian negotiators welcomed this language as 
a sign that Washington may also consider Har Homa as a violation of 
the peace plan signed last month, which bans ``unilateral actions'' 
affecting the ``status'' of the West Bank, of which east Jerusalem 
is, in their view, an integral part. Israel, however, considers east 
Jerusalem a permanent part of its own national territory, in contrast 
to areas in the Gaza Strip and the West Bank under Israeli military 
occupation. Government planners have been explicit in their intent 
to reshape the ethnic map of greater Jerusalem, precluding any future 
division of the city between the Arab east and Jewish west. ``This 
is an issue of sovereignty,'' Netanyahu insisted in a news conference 
Thursday. ``This is not an issue of community needs, but of sovereignty.'' 
The Har Homa summit, known to Arabic speakers as Jamal Abu Ghneim, 
was seized from Jordan along with rest of east Jerusalem in the 1967 
war. Israel subsequently annexed east Jerusalem, and vacant property 
there was expropriated from Jewish and Arab residents for security 
and future settlement purposes. A rocky promontory rising southeast 
of Jerusalem's ancient center and just northwest of Palestinian-governed 
Bethlehem, Har Homa is today a rare remaining blank spot in an increasingly 
dense urban landscape. At 2,500 feet above sea level _ and 3,900 feet 
above Dead Sea level _ the site offers commanding vistas of Jerusalem's 
Old City and the ochre expanse of the Judean desert. Good new roads 
make it a ten-minute trip to the city's main shopping districts. Prospective 
buyers are expected to be motivated more by views and state-subsidized 
mortgage rates than by ideology. When earth movers began leveling 
the hilltop for eventual settlement 17 months ago, the United Nations 
immediately adopted resolutions condemning the action, the Palestinians 
stalked angrily away from the negotiating table and U.S. officials 
voiced dismay at the move. Some Israeli officials expressed relief 
that the Har Homa announcement was overshadowed by preparations for 
possible American and British air strikes against Iraq.
