Stocks were mixed Thursday after failing to sustain a morning advance. 
Only a surge by two oil components in the Dow Jones industrial average 
_ reflecting possible military action against Iraq _ kept the average 
in the plus column. Investors are also waiting for the results of 
Tuesday's meeting by the Federal Reserve concerning possible interest 
rate cuts. The Dow's gain, which reached nearly 84 points just before 
noon, was 5.92 points, to 8,829.74. All other major averages declined. 
The Nasdaq composite index fell 11.05 points, to 1,851.06, while the 
Standard &AMP; Poor's 500-stock index lost 3.28 points, to 1,117.69. 
``The market is buffeted by uncertainty and stocks aren't as cheap 
as they were,'' said Byron Wien, chief domestic strategist at Morgan 
Stanley Dean Witter. Treasury bonds and the dollar strengthened as 
jittery investors around the world sought safer havens. Stock buyers, 
too, have seemed to migrate toward larger, higher-quality stocks of 
late after a month in which the Nasdaq market climbed twice as much 
as the Dow. Once again, ``investors seem to be discriminating among 
companies,'' said Daniel Knight, portfolio manager at Columbine Capital 
Services in Colorado Springs. ``Lower P-E stocks are outperforming 
high P-E stocks,'' he added, referring to the relationship of prices 
to earnings. One prominent speculative casualty was Entremed, which 
dropped 7} a share, to 24~, after The Wall Street Journal reported 
on problems that scientists have had in replicating one of the company's 
experimental anti-cancer compounds. The stock traded as high as 85 
in May. By contrast, Earthweb built on its spectacular Wednesday debut 
by surging another 20 9/16, to 69\, nearly quintupling in two trading 
sessions from its initial price of 14 a share. Oil shares jumped on 
the assumption that an attack against Iraq would jeopardize at least 
some Mideast oil supplies. Chevron, up 3[ a share, to 83, and Exxon, 
up 2 9/16, to 72 13/16, were the Dow's most important performers; 
without them, the Dow _ with only 10 gainers out of 30 _ would have 
declined. Airline shares were mixed. Delta Air Lines gained 1 5/16, 
to 101\, and AMR, the parent of American Airlines, rose 1 3/16, to 
61\, while other lines slipped. Most analysts still expect the Fed 
to make another cut in short-term interest rates _ and the case for 
it might have been bolstered a bit with the Labor Department's report 
that first-time claims for jobless benefits climbed last week to the 
highest level in four months. But conviction was missing in the market 
Thursday. In fact, said James Pizzo, market strategist at CIBC Oppenheimer, 
``you have more people concerned that it will not happen, compared 
to a few weeks ago.'' Computer, software and Internet stocks were 
mostly lower, though Ebay, up 10 1/16 a share, to 126, and Amazon.com, 
up 4], to 131, were prominent exceptions. Safeway, the grocery retailer 
that is replacing Chrysler in the S&AMP;P 500, gained 1 5/16 , to 
50{, after trading as high as 55 late in the session. Index funds, 
which try to match the market as a whole, were said to be adding the 
stock in their portfolios at closing levels. In its last day of trading, 
Chrysler shares edged up 1/16, to 47[, and were the day's most actively 
traded; the company begins trading as part of DaimlerChrysler on Tuesday.
