The United States is welcoming an Arab statement that calls on Iraq 
to reverse a ban on U.N. weapons inspections. The statement was issued 
today by foreign ministers from Egypt, Saudi arabia, the United Arab 
Emirates, Qatar, Bahrain, Kuwait and Jordan. Wolf Blitzer is standing 
by live in Washington with details of a briefing by White House spokesman 
Joe Lockhart. Wolf? This is a sign that Iraqi President Saddam Hussein 
is increasingly isolated in the showdown with the United Nations and 
the United States right now. Even the Arab world is increasingly united 
against Saddam Hussein. Insisting that he cooperate with U.N. weapons 
inspectors. And in this statement, the Iraqis are told, they will 
bear full responsibility for their noncompliance. Now, the president's 
top national security advisers will be meeting once again late this 
afternoon, early evening here at the White House to review various 
military operation options. Joe Lockhart told reporters this morning, 
this is no time for negotiation. There will be no more negotiation 
for the Iraqis, they must athrough U.N. weapon inspectors in. U.S. 
officials also point out that Kofi Annan, the U.N. secretary-general 
is now scheduled tomorrow afternoon to be briefed by the U.N. security 
council even though the Iraqi government is increasingly isolated 
right now. Both rush sla and China are still officially opposed to 
the use of military force. The United States, Britain, and other western 
allies are increasingly coming around to the conclusion that there 
is going to be no other option except the military option. Catherine? 
Thank you, wolf. Thanks, wolf.
