``Hard Core Logo,'' a more straight-faced punk-rock descendant of 
``This Is Spinal Tap,'' follows a fictional band from Vancouver on 
its chaotic, self-destructive farewell tour across western Canada. 
But unlike ``Spinal Tap,'' which cast a comically jaundiced eye on 
every nuance of the heavy-metal life style, this clever mock documentary, 
which opens Friday at the Screening Room, blends satire and sentiment 
in a way that keeps you emotionally off balance. For every suggestion 
that it is poking fun at the punk-rock esthetic (onstage, the bullying, 
alcoholic lead singer Joe Dick spits in the faces of his fellow band 
members), there are stronger hints that the movie, handsomely photographed 
by Danny Nowak, aspires to be a kind of romantic elegy to the punk-rock 
movement. As Hard Core Logo makes its way across the prairie, shots 
of its battered tour bus rolling through the farmland convey a mood 
of grand desolation. What does punk rock and its esthetic of defiance 
have to do with this landscape, you wonder? And what's to become of 
its four contentious rock rebels who are already well into their 30s? 
This melancholy atmosphere seeps into the scenes of the band's backstage 
squabbles, most of which revolve around the embattled relationship 
of the band's leader and prime mover, Joe (Hugh Dillon), and his lead 
guitarist Billy Tallent (Callum Keith Rennie). Billy, who is waiting 
to hear whether he will be officially invited to join a big-time Los 
Angeles band, has temporarily rejoined Hard Core Logo. But once he's 
on board, Joe pressures him into promising not to leave. The movie 
toys with the possibility of a sexual relationship between the two 
but nervously backs off from investigating further. Rounding out the 
fractious foursome are its bassist John (John Pyper-Ferguson), a stammering 
manic-depressive on lithium who keeps a journal of the tour, and Pipefitter 
(Bernie Coulson), its loutish fun-loving drummer. To succeed, a movie 
like ``Hard Core Logo'' demands a certain credibility. And until the 
scene in which the group visits an English punk legend, Bucky Haight 
(Julian Richings), the movie feels real enough. But the idea that 
this gaunt, angry living legend would retire to an isolated farmhouse 
in the Canadian heartland is ludicrous. When Bucky and the members 
of Hard Core Logo take a collective LSD trip that feels like a flashback 
to ``Easy Rider,'' the film becomes derailed. By the time the movie 
comes back on track for a nasty final scene, the game of ``is it or 
isn't it real'' hide-and-seek has long been lost. ``Hard Core Logo'' 
is rated R (Under 17 requires accompanying parent or adult guardian). 
It has profanity and one scene of violence. PRODUCTION NOTES: `HARD
