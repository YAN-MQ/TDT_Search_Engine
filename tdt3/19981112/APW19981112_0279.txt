The last time America sent forces to the Gulf to attack Iraq, the 
defiance in Baghdad was perhaps matched only by the outrage in the 
rest of the Arab world. Palestinians paraded a model of an Iraqi Scud 
missile, Yemenis jumped off buses to join anti-American protests and 
police had to use attack dogs to keep demonstrators in Jordan at bay. 
It's a different mood today. All sides, at least publicly, are still 
urging a diplomatic solution. But rather than anger, there seems to 
be much more resignation that an attack is inevitable. ``Kuwait cannot 
stop a superpower from taking certain steps,'' said Sheik Sabah al-Ahmed 
al-Sabah, the Kuwaiti foreign minister. Twenty-five more U.N. employees 
left Iraq on Thursday, joining 233 U.N. inspectors and relief workers 
who departed a day earlier _ a move widely seen as a precaution against 
an American strike. The United States and Britain have made clear 
they are willing to attack Iraq for its Oct. 31 decision to halt the 
activities of the U.N. Special Commission, which is responsible for 
eliminating Iraq's weapons of mass destruction and programs to build 
them. Sanctions imposed after Iraq's 1990 invasion of Kuwait can only 
be lifted once the commission certifies it's work is done. But Iraq 
believes the United States, in particular, will never allow the commission 
to make such a decision, making any cooperation futile. Few in the 
region feel Iraq is prepared to back down. ``The question now is what 
will this strike be like? What will its size be and what will be the 
end?'' asked columnist Abdullah al-Shayegi in Kuwait's Al-Watan newspaper 
on Thursday. That attitude was echoed in Al-Wafd, Egypt's most popular 
opposition newspaper. Its banner headline on Thursday read, ``The 
countdown begins for the strike on Iraq.'' No Arab government would 
endorse an attack on Iraq, a politically disastrous move that would 
run the risk of further inflaming widespread public anger at Washington's 
steadfast support of Israel and sympathy for the Iraqi people. Since 
the buildup began, nearly all Arab countries have voiced support for 
diplomacy over war, warning that an attack would bring _ as Qatar's 
foreign minister put it _ ``further catastrophes.'' ``I see it as 
my duty to warn of the dangers of prolonging the conflict between 
the U.N. inspectors and the Iraqi government,'' Egyptian President 
Hosni Mubarak said Wednesday night. But despite the calls for a peaceful 
solution, diplomacy this time seems to be less active _ and less vocal. 
During the last crisis with Iraq in February, Arab League Secretary-General 
Esmat Abdel-Meguid took the unusual step of flying to Baghdad to meet 
President Saddam Hussein. No such move has been suggested this time 
around. In fact, Defense Secretary William Cohen told Arab leaders 
on his tour of the Gulf, Egypt and Jordan that if the governments 
did not agree with an attack, they should keep the criticism to themselves, 
said Arab diplomats, speaking on condition of anonymity. A current 
of resentment remains, though, at what many Arabs see as Western double-standards 
in the treatment of Iraq and Israel. Many Arabs ask why Washington 
does not apply the same zeal in bringing about a permanent agreement 
in Israeli-Palestinian talks. ``This duplicity in American policy, 
the flagrant hostility to Arab rights and the extreme bias in favor 
of Israel has proven that the American administration has no credibility,'' 
said Tishrin, a Syrian newspaper that speaks for the government.
