A Cabinet minister has urged leniency for his son, a member of Parliament 
accused of attempting to run over two policemen, while opposition 
politicians vowed to take action if the courts don't resolve the case. 
One lawmaker has pledged to quit the legislature, and the head of 
Parliament has said he would ``take responsibility'' if Poonpol Asavahame 
is acquitted of criminal charges, local newspapers reported Thursday. 
Poonpol is the 31-year-old son of Vatana Asavahame, a businessman 
and political power broker who is deputy interior minister. Poonpol 
allegedly ran a car into two Bangkok police officers last week as 
he was trying to help two friends escape from police who had stopped 
them for driving without an insurance sticker. After some initial 
reluctance on the part of the authorities, Poonpol was charged on 
several criminal counts, including attempted murder of one of the 
policemen. Poonpol also was accused of assaulting another motorist 
in 1996 after a minor accident. The case did not go to trial. Surathin 
Pimanmekhin, a retired police colonel who belongs to the opposition 
New Aspiration Party, said he will quit Parliament if Poonpol is not 
convicted. He gave his letter of resignation Wednesday to Parliament 
president Wan Mohammed Noor Matha and asked that it take effect if 
Poonpol is acquitted by the courts. Wan Noor praised Surathin's act 
and said it showed the proper political spirit, the newspaper The 
Nation reported. ``If the justice system or parliamentary action cannot 
do anything against the MP, I won't allow the matter to be simply 
forgotten,'' Wan Noor was quoted as saying. ``As house speaker, I 
am obliged to assure society that they can trust the Parliament and 
that MPs should not be allowed to abuse their status.'' Vatana, also 
a member of Parliament, accused rivals of mixing politics with Poonpol's 
case. In remarks published Thursday in the Bangkok Post, he said his 
son should be given a ``third chance.'' ``Others should not try to 
hurt him more by turning this into a political issue,'' Vatana said. 
``Wrongdoers who feel remorse should be forgiven.'' It is unusual 
for the rich and powerful in Thai society to face prosecution for 
their alleged crimes. The issue has recently been highlighted by a 
spate of high-profile incidents involving the sons of another prominent 
politician, Chalerm Yubamrung, accused of violent assaults but not 
prosecuted.
