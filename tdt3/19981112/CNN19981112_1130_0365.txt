Immigration service agents in Los Angeles say they've confiscated 
2 million phony green cards, social security cards, driver's licenses 
and other phony documents this week. They found them packed into a 
storage shed as they continued an investigation that's produced a 
dozen arrests. They believe the counterfeit ring also distributed 
$3 million worth of forged travelers checks and credit cards.
