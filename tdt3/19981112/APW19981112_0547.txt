Saudi authorities chopped off the right hand of an Egyptian man Thursday 
for stealing at Islam's holiest site in Mecca, the official Saudi 
Press Agency reported. Saudi Arabia's strict interpretation of Islamic 
law calls for cutting off the right hand of thieves. Murderers, rapists, 
drug traffickers and armed robbers are beheaded. The SPA said Sharif 
Ali Ibrahim was convicted of pick pocketing worshipers praying in 
the Grand Mosque next to the Kabaa, the focal point of Muslim prayers. 
Ibrahim's hand was cut off with a sword in the holy city of Mecca 
in western Saudi Arabia, the agency said. This was the fifth amputation 
this year. Over the past few months, two Saudis, an Egyptian and an 
Afghan man had their right hands cut off for pick pocketing in the 
same mosque. Executions and amputations are carried out with a sword 
in a public square. So far this year, Saudi Arabia has beheaded 24 
people. Last year 124 people were executed.
