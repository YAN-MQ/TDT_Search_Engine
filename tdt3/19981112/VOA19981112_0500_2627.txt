Argentine President Carlos Menem says his country will be the first 
developing nation to voluntarily reduce emission of greenhouse gases. 
He made the announcement at the U.N. Planet Change Conference in Buenos 
Aires. The United States is praising the Menem initiative and a similar 
one expected from Kazakhstan, but there was no immediate reaction 
from India and China, countries that have always rejected the idea 
of voluntary cuts.
