Actor and director Peter Cotes, celebrated for staging the first theater 
production of Agatha Christie's venerable ``Mousetrap'' in 1952, has 
died. He was 86. Cotes died ``peacefully'' Tuesday at his home in 
the middle England village of Chipping Norton, according to death 
notices published in British newspapers. Cotes was best-known for 
his hit production ``Pick-Up Girl'' in 1946, which was denied a license 
by the censor but received the go-ahead after Queen Mary, the Queen 
Mother, came to see it. The play was an American tale of child abuse 
and venereal disease. Born in Maidenhead in 1912, Cotes was the oldest 
son of parents who had run a theater company in South Africa. His 
career got off to a quick start when, at age 4, he was handed over 
the footlights at the Portsmouth Hippodrome with a bouquet for a performer, 
The Guardian newspaper reported. As a director, Cotes argued against 
the trend where actors were becoming stars, overshadowing the plays. 
Along with his late wife, the actress Joan Miller, he became a major 
force in serious British theater throughout the 1940s and 1950s by 
establishing his own theater group. In the '50s and '60s, he also 
directed feature films and television dramas, but theater remained 
his first love. Cotes also wrote several books, including a biography 
of Charlie Chaplin in 1951. Funeral arrangements were not known.
