That's a lot of bread, I mean, a lot of gold there. Well, we're coming 
up on 22 hours universal time. That means we're closing down on all 
frequencies to the Middle East, North Africa, and Europe except for 
1548 kilohertz medium wave to the Persian Gulf region. In Europe, 
during the next hour, VOA News Now can be heard on WRN1 via Astra, 
channel 22, audio sub carrier 738 megahertz.
