Across the country Wednesday Americans honored their servicemen and 
women on veterans day. In Washington President Clinton laid a wreath 
at the tomb of the unknowns. He told Americans to remember that, in 
his words, "our achievements in peace are built upon the sacrifices 
of our veterans in war." In New York, mayor Rudy Giuliani joined veterans 
in a March down 5th avenue. The parade ended at Madison square, where 
veterans raised a large American flag.
