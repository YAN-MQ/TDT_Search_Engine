Joe Torey, who led Major League Baseball's New York Yankees to the 
World Series Championship has been honored as the American League 
Manager of the Year. The Yankees skipper guided the team considered 
to be one of the best ever in the history of baseball to a lead record 
114 victories in 1998. The World Series title was the Yankees' second 
in three years. New York pitcher David Kohn, who signed a one year 
$8 million deal with the Yankees Wednesday says Tory deserved the 
award. Joe has been a major impact since he's come over here. I think 
the fact that we had no all stars or no one player that really stood 
out this year really bodes well for his managerial choices as manager 
of the year. The 58-year-old Tory was the only manager to be named 
on all 28 ballots in voting by the Baseball Writers of America, which 
includes two votes from each American League city. He also received 
the award in 1996 when he shared the honor with Johnny Oates of the 
Texas Rangers. Jimmy Williams of the Boston Red Sox was a distant 
runner up, while Anaheim Angels manager Carrie Collins finished third 
in the voting. Houston Astros manager Larry Dirker was named the National 
League Manager of the Year on Wednesday.
