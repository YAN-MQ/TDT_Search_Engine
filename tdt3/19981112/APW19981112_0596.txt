More Asian children are dropping out of school and millions face malnutrition 
as the regional economic crisis attacks social progress made in previous 
decades, a top UNICEF official said Thursday. Carol Bellamy, executive 
director of the United Nations Children's Fund, urged regional governments 
at the 4th ministerial consultation on children's welfare not to let 
the crisis divert attention from child health and education. ``The 
price of inaction can be high, as the suffering of Latin America and 
much of Africa in the 1980s proved,'' Bellamy said in a speech opening 
the three-day meeting. ``Countries in those regions endured a deeply 
damaging economic crisis, but they continued to invest in social programs 
and they are now reaping the benefits for it,'' Bellamy said. Bellamy 
encouraged Asian-Pacific governments, grappling with austerity programs 
to get through the financial devastation that hit the region last 
year, to minimize cuts in social development budgets. The meeting 
is bringing together officials from 18 Asian-Pacific countries with 
representatives of donor nations, private organizations and the United 
Nations. They will discuss what can be done to protect children and 
other vulnerable groups. ``When the interests of the global financial 
markets are at stake, tens of billions of dollars are readily found 
to bail them out,'' Bellamy told The Associated Press. ``But when 
it comes to the relatively modest amounts of money for basic services 
in countries where the need is greatest, the world's response is far 
from adequate,'' she said. A UNICEF report said that malnutrition 
in East Asia and the Pacific ranks third after South Asia and sub-Saharan 
Africa. But if China is excluded, the region moves up to second place. 
Bellamy said that gloomy regional economic scenarios have ``potentially 
devastating'' consequences for children. About 33 million children 
in the region continue to face severe and moderate malnutrition, and 
the crisis is making the situation worse. Poverty remains the chief 
cause. But evidence shows that a lack of access to nutritious food 
is still a major problem in some countries like Indonesia and North 
Korea. The crisis threatens to undo progress made in recent years 
in protecting children from labor and exploitation. Poverty and loss 
of jobs for their parents will force more children to work and raise 
the risks of child abuse and neglect, the report said. Primary school 
dropout rates are going up and access to health care and sanitation 
_ already difficult in some countries _ are expected to get worse 
as funding tightens up. Some 1 billion people, or about 65 percent 
of the region's population, lack access to adequate sanitation, the 
report said. About 40,000 women die each year of pregnancy and childbirth 
problems. UNICEF fears that recession will increase maternal mortality 
rates because families have less means to pay for hospital services. 
Thai Prime Minister Chuan Leekpai told the conference that the crisis 
threatens hard-won gains since 1960 in getting nearly every Thai child 
to finish sixth grade and in slashing the infant mortality rate. ``We 
cannot and must not compromise our children's well-being,'' Chuan 
said. ``Indeed, we cannot and must not compromise our own future.'' 
Some 3 million Thais, about 80 percent of them women, are expected 
to be unemployed by year-end. The crisis also risks spreading AIDS. 
Many female workers laid off their jobs, at least in Thailand, are 
believed to be resorting to prostitution to support themselves and 
their families.
