Randy Newman made short work of his ostensible reason for performing 
at Town Hall on Tuesday night. He was opening a five-night festival 
of film music presented by the Knitting Factory, and since the 1980s, 
Newman has spent most of his career writing soundtracks for movies, 
including ``Ragtime,'' ``Parenthood,'' ``Toy Story,'' ``The Natural'' 
and, lately, ``Pleasantville'' and ``A Bug's Life.'' Writing film 
music, he said, is ``a well-paying job, but it hints of serfdom.'' 
But performing alone at the piano, he stuck to songs _ a few new ones 
and many from the 1970s _ rather than soundtracks. Nobody minded. 
Both Newman's songs and film scores invoke his broad musical erudition: 
gospel and Tin Pan Alley, blues and country, Fats Domino, Stephen 
Foster, Chopin, Hoagy Carmichael, Gershwin, Weill, Copland. He can 
turn a moment bittersweet by letting major chords crumple into minor 
ones; he can write music-box waltzes and ardent choruses. And his 
pristine solo piano arrangements move from barrelhouse vamps to etched-glass 
classical harmonies. A new four-CD retrospective of Newman's work, 
``Guilty: 30 Years'' (Reprise), includes some of the pretty melodies 
Hollywood has gotten out of him. His blend of pop, romanticism and 
Americana skillfully tugs heartstrings. But his songs carry more twists 
than his film scores, as if they've added Brecht to Weill. While Newman's 
stolidly unglamorous voice pushes against his ingratiating tunes, 
his lyrics implicate both singer and listener in unsavory human impulses. 
Newman described ``Toy Story'' from the composer's point of view. 
``It starts with a song,'' he said, and explained that it continued 
with instrumental music. ``But you can hardly hear it because they're 
talking over it,'' he said as he played some tinkles and rumbles. 
``Then it's Christmastime, and there's another song, and that's the 
end of the movie.'' That purely self-centered perspective runs through 
some of Newman's most durable songs, among them ``Marie,'' in which 
a man professes love for a woman he mistreats, and ``Old Man,'' in 
which a son tells his ailing father, ``Everybody dies.'' The misanthropic 
humor of older material, like ``God's Song'' and ``Political Science,'' 
still has bite, even with familiar punch lines. And Newman's American 
travelogues, like ``Burn On,'' ``Baltimore'' and ``Louisiana 1927,'' 
are ambivalent to the core, blending unsparing observation with choruses 
that sound consoling despite themselves. At Town Hall, Newman toyed 
with levels of irony, adding voice-overs as he played; he pitched 
his pop-gospel ballad ``I Want You To Hurt Like I Do'' as a potential 
celebrity anthem, like ``We Are the World.'' But he doesn't let anyone 
off the hook. He noted that his songs often use ``bad narrators,'' 
but continued, ``Then you later find that they're you.'' Newman's 
1990s movie songs, like ``You've Got a Friend in Me,'' might startle 
longtime fans precisely because they don't have a dark side. But when 
writing for himself, he hasn't given up his barbs. One new song is 
a mock-pompous march about colonialist genocide; Canary Islands natives, 
he sang, faced ``bullets, disease, the Portuguese/they weren't there 
anymore.'' Another new song was a tender-sounding ballad in which 
the singer confesses ``I miss you'' to someone he broke up with 20 
years ago; then he observes, ``You must be laughing yourself sick.'' 
If Newman's songs were movies, they wouldn't be the Hollywood heartwarmers 
that he scores. They'd be flinty little independent films, finely 
detailed and too smart for comfort.
