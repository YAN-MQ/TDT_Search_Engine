German Finance Minister Oskar Lafontaine has been recommended to succeed 
Jacques Santer as the next European Commission president, German media 
reported Thursday. A Social Democratic European parliamentarian, Klaus 
Haensch, told Saarlaendischer Rundfunk radio that he is promoting 
Lafontaine as a candidate for the post when it comes open in January 
2000. ``It's Germany's turn to occupy this post,'' Haensch said. A 
German last held the commission presidency from 1958-67. Germany already 
has sought French support for a German candidate, the weekly Die Zeit 
reported in its latest edition issued Thursday. The EU commission 
president must be elected by the full European parliament. Lafontaine 
already has substantial influence in the new Social Democratic-led 
German government, occupying both the party's top post and running 
the Finance Ministry as Germany joins 10 other European countries 
in the monetary union launching Jan. 1.
