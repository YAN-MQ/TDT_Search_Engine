A 90-year-old suspected Nazi war criminal will be brought to trial 
in January on charges of sending scores of Jews to their deaths when 
he was a top police officer during World War, a Lithuanian court ruled 
Thursday. Kazys Gimzauskas, a former U.S. citizen, was deputy chief 
of the Vilnius security police during the 1940-41 Nazi occupation 
of this small Baltic nation. He has been charged with genocide for 
participating in the near extermination of Lithuania's Jewish community, 
and has denied any wrongdoing. The Vilnius District Court on Thursday 
set a trial date of Jan. 5 for Gimzauskas, who was stripped of his 
U.S. citizenship for hiding his Nazi past and fled to Lithuania from 
St. Petersburg, Florida in 1993. Gimzauskas is the second Lithuania 
involved in a major Nazi war crimes trial since Lithuanian gained 
independence from the Soviet Union in 1991. His superior in the Nazi-run 
security police, Aleksandras Lileikis, 91, was brought to trial on 
similar charges this month, but was rushed away in an ambulance just 
as the case was opening. Both men claim to be too ill to face trial. 
A law recently passed in Lithuania allows the indictment, but not 
trial, of war crimes in absentia. In the Gimzauskas case, prosecutors 
are expected to focus on five Lithuanian Jews they believe they can 
prove Gimzauskas turned over for execution. More than 90 percent of 
Lithuania's prewar Jewish community of 240,000 died during the war. 
Some Jewish groups accuse Lithuania of delaying trials of Nazi war 
criminals to avoid confronting the nation's past under German occupation.
