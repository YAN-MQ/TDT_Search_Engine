Good evening. We begin tonight with the high-stakes blame game between 
the United States and Iraq. The Clinton administration says again 
today that Saddam Hussein is liable to be attacked very shortly because 
he will not abide by the rules for international weapons inspection. 
The Iraqi government says there's a standoff because the Clinton administration 
will not allow international economic sanctions against Iraq to be 
lifted. It is a very messy business in which it is difficult for Iraq 
or the United States to prevail. Our first report is from Sam Donaldson 
at the White House. In his only public appearance today, President 
Clinton said nothing about the crisis with Iraq, leaving it to press 
secretary Joe lockhart to continue the hard line. There is nothing 
to negotiate. They have a simple choice, to reverse course or face 
the consequences. But in Baghdad, deputy prime minister Tariq Aziz 
said Iraq does not believe that reversing course and cooperating with 
U.N. inspectors would bring the desired lifting of U.N. sanctions. 
Nobody has shown us a light at the end of the tunnel. There is a tunnel 
after the tunnel. Aziz accused the U.N. inspectors of serving the 
interests of the U.S. CIA and Israeli mossad and bitterly assailed 
President Clinton. He and his government are the problem. Not Iraq. 
Not the president of Iraq. Not the government of Iraq. That is exactly 
backwards, replied state department spokesman jamie Rubin. No amount 
of polemic or attempt to shift the blame is going to change the fact 
that the whole world is placing responsibility for this crisis squarely 
on Iraq's doorstep. Rubin pointed to a statement issued today by eight 
Arab states which said "Iraq must heed U.N. security council resolutions 
and abide by them to avoid military confrontation." And although U.N. 
secretary Kofi Annan there seemed little sentiment for him to intervene 
as he had last February. Senator Arlen specter, the Pennsylvania republican, 
called on the president today to call a special session of Congress 
to authorize military action, something Mr. Clinton is not inclined 
to do, but just when the president intends to pull the trigger on 
his own is unclear. There appears to be a little breathing room left, 
but U.S. officials want to leave the impression, not much. Sam Donaldson, 
ABC News, the White House.
