Blue-chip shares inching higher, but most stocks retreating for a 
fourth straight session. One analyst points to a number of reasons 
for the recent action in the market. What's holding the market back 
is, first of all, the market's done quite well. We all know it's up 
20% from its October lows. Secondly, the foreign markets are down, 
and we tend to move with them to some degree. And finally, there's 
some uncertainty about what the fed's going to do with interest rates 
next week. New tensions between the United Nations and Iraq shaking 
up the bond market. The possibility of air strikes against Iraq growing 
stronger today, sending many investors looking for stability.
