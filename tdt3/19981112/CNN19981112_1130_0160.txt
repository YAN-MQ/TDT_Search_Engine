Pentagon sources say 12 B-52 bombers loaded with air-launched cruise 
missiles are scheduled to leave U.S. bases for dispatch near the Persian 
gulf. Sources say six will leave from North Dakota and six from Louisiana. 
In addition, officers at FT. Stewart, Georgia, say they have been 
ordered to ready a brigade of 3,000 troops for possible deployment 
to the gulf. Yesterday, secretary of defense William Cohen signed 
a deployment order to send troops and 129 additional warplanes to 
the gulf region.
