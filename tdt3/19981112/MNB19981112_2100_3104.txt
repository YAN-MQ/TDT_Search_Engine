In Houston, Texas today, riding in a car last used by F.D.R., John 
Glenn and his fellow space shuttle discovery crew members were honored 
at the city's veterans' day parade. They returned from space on Saturday 
after a successful nine-day mission with the 77-year-old senator participating 
in experiments to test the effects of space flight on the aging process. 
Today's honor was just as much for Glenn's years as a Marine corps 
fighter pilot as it was his two missions in space. Glenn served in 
the Korean war as Ted Williams, the baseball great.
