While the nation's five largest accounting firms have been sprinting 
away from their accounting roots to become aggressive sellers of consulting 
services, most of the smaller firms have been slow to change. But 
last year, the partners at Grant Thornton, the nation's sixth-largest 
accounting firm, made a bold move for a firm considered to be among 
the more conservative ones. For the first time, the partners looked 
outside the firm, which is based in Chicago, for a chief executive. 
In fact, the man they hired, Adrian J.R. Smith, was not even an accountant. 
Instead, Smith was an expert in sales and marketing _ skills that 
accountants once thought to be little more than fluff. But just three 
months after Smith officially assumed his executive role, he and the 
partners have agreed to part ways. ``He had failed to gain all the 
partners' confidence in making changes,'' said Norman Hedgecock, a 
partner who will now share the executive responsibilities with Richard 
Stewart, another partner, until a new chief executive is named. Smith, 
53, could not be reached for comment Thursday. Before joining Grant 
Thornton, Smith was the managing partner of global marketing and communications 
at Arthur Andersen, one of the Big Five firms. Before that, he was 
a brand manager at Procter &AMP; Gamble. Smith, who is from Liverpool, 
England, is also a lawyer. Among the scores of changes that Smith 
had proposed was one to let Grant Thornton accountants wear casual 
clothes every day if they felt it was appropriate for their dealings 
with clients. One insider said Thursday that many of the firm's younger 
professionals had been wondering this week, after Smith announced 
his resignation on Monday, whether they would have to pull their dark 
gray suits out of their closets. Hedgecock said, however, that the 
casual dress policy would continue.
