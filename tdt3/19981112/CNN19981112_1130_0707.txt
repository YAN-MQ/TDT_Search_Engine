a nip and a tuck are no longer just for women. More and more men are 
opting for cosmetic surgery. There's a certain feeling that to be 
competitive, you need to look young. Dr. Alan gaynor has seen an increase 
in aging male baby boomers who want to have some form of cosmetic 
surgery. When they had some small procedures, they looked as young 
as the youthfulness of their ideas and confidence they expressed in 
their careers, and I think this is why men do it. The actual surgical 
procedures can differ for male and female patients. Men literally 
have thicker skin, and because there's hair in the facial area, the 
blood supply there is greater. There's an increased risk of bleeding, 
but that can lead to better healing. And some surgeons report that, 
in general, men are less satisfied with the results of cosmetic surgery 
than women.
