A special passageway through the monastery's 16th Century wine cellar 
has been built so women can view seven frescos of the Virgin Mary 
painted by Francisco Goya 200 years ago. Spanish Queen Sofia on Wednesday 
opened the new passageway at the Aula Dei monastery near this northern 
city and admired the frescos in the chapel. ``The idea was to allow 
women, as well as men, to see the frescos without disturbing the monastic 
order,'' said Rosa Pellicero, a spokeswoman from the local government. 
Before the Queen opened the way, only three women _ another member 
of the royal family, a judicial secretary and a female restorer _ 
had seen the frescos that were painted by a 28-year-old Goya in 1774. 
The monks, who belong to the Roman Catholic Cartesian order and follow 
strict sex-segregation norms dating back 900 years, had agreed to 
the passageway after the Goya bicentenary celebrations in 1996 brought 
unwanted attention to their ban on women. Not that the old Spanish 
master's frescos will suddenly be unveiled to all and sundry. Visits 
have to be booked, and with just one showing every month the places 
are full until February 1999.
