Facing a U.S. military build-up and harsh criticism from fellow Arabs, 
Iraq on Thursday blamed Washington for the deepening crisis over U.N. 
arms inspections and said an American attack would be ``a sheer aggression 
of criminals.'' Deputy Prime Minister Tariq Aziz _ his voice rising 
in anger _ charged that President Clinton was blocking the completion 
of arms inspections necessary for the lifting of punishing trade sanctions 
on Iraq. ``The road is being blocked continuously, stubbornly, illegally 
by his government'' Aziz told a news conference that came shortly 
after eight Arab states said Iraq itself would be at fault if the 
U.S. military struck at the country. The criticism by the six countries 
of the Gulf Cooperation Council _ Iraq's vulnerable neighbors _ along 
with Syria and Egypt was unusually strong for Arab countries who have 
repeatedly called for a diplomatic solution to the crisis. Foreign 
ministers of the eight states, meeting in the Gulf state of Qatar, 
did urge ``wisdom and reason'' to end the confrontation. But they 
said the government of President Saddam Hussein would be ``responsible 
for any consequences'' from its stopping the work of U.N. weapons 
inspectors. Aziz gave little heed to the plea from the Arabs to renew 
cooperation with the United Nations or face more suffering by the 
Iraqi people. ``If they are sincere in dealing with this situation 
... they should blame the main block, the main government which is 
behind this crisis. They should criticize the United States,'' he 
said. Iraq's defiant stand came despite growing evidence that the 
United States was preparing to make good on its military threats unless 
searches for Iraq's weapons of mass destruction are renewed. The United 
States on Wednesday ordered more warships headed to the Gulf to ready 
for an attack, and the United Nations _ declaring it must look to 
the safety of its workers _ pulled 21 more of its staff out of Iraq 
on Thursday. The U.N. pullback began Wednesday. All arms inspectors 
and a third of the 450 U.N. humanitarian workers have now left the 
country, with the departure of aid workers likely reducing the effectiveness 
of programs to help Iraq's 22 million people. At his news conference, 
Aziz said Iraq was willing to cooperate with arms inspectors, but 
only if it had guarantees from the U.N. Security Council that this 
would lead to lifting sanctions imposed after Iraq's 1990 invasion 
of Kuwait. He accused the Clinton administration of undermining a 
U.N. offer of a comprehensive review of the arms inspections _ as 
one step toward lifting the sanctions _ by refusing to include even 
a reference to the eight-year-old trade embargo. The sanctions, which 
limit Iraqi oil sales and have ruined its economy, cannot be be lifted 
until the inspectors certify that Iraq has destroyed its lethal weapons. 
This was required under the cease-fire resolutions that ended the 
1991 Gulf War over Kuwait. Aziz complained that after more than seven 
years of working with U.N. inspectors, ``sanctions were not reduced 
and were not lifted.'' ``Why?'' he asked rhetorically. ``Because the 
government of Mr. Clinton has blocked any attempt during this period 
to reduce and lift sanctions. He and his government are the problem, 
not Iraq.'' Aziz questioned whether the United States had the right 
to attack. ``Is that in the U.N. resolutions?'' he asked. ``Is that 
international law? Is that a ... a humanitarian mission to be conducted 
by a government? Or is it a sheer aggression of criminals?'' He also 
said Iraq's people were not worried about a possible military strike. 
``They are dying whether in a hospital which lacks medicine and equipment 
or they die by American bombs,'' he said. ``For the Iraqi people it 
makes no difference.'' Aziz said that U.N. Secretary-General Kofi 
Annan was ``the best person'' to try to ease the current crisis, as 
he did the last one in February with a pledge to work toward an end 
to the sanctions. The United States had built up forces in the Gulf 
in February, too, but that stand-off ended when Iraq backed down from 
its insistence that U.N. experts could not inspect Saddam's presidential 
palaces. In August, seeing no signs of the sanctions being lifted, 
Iraq again limited the work of arms inspectors and on Oct. 31 it cut 
off even the long-term monitoring intended to prevent the Iraqi government 
from renewing weapons production. That brought a Security Council 
condemnation and a renewal of U.S. threats of a military strike. Britain 
has backed Washington in the Security Council, and Iraq's usual allies 
_ China, France and Russia _ have not been outspoken in defending 
the Iraqi government.
