The environmental watchdog group Greenpeace claimed Thursday that 
the French nuclear reprocessing plant at La Hague emits ``worrisome'' 
levels of radioactive carbon. Greenpeace said an analysis of grass 
and leaves surrounding the plant showed concentrations of carbon-14 
that are two to seven times greater than normal levels. ``It is clear 
that the entire area surrounding La Hague, especially the part downwind 
from the plant, is seriously contaminated by radioactive carbon,'' 
Greenpeace said in a statement. Cogema, the state nuclear fuel reprocessing 
company, accused Greenpeace of using scare tactics. ``I suppose the 
results are correct, but the impact of such radioactivity levels is 
negligible,'' said Cogema spokesman Philippe Pradel. Carbon-14 is 
absorbed by plants, animals and humans, which can't differentiate 
between stable carbon and the radioactive isotope, Greenpeace said. 
Earlier this week, Greenpeace said the La Hague plant was emitting 
high levels of aerial radiation. Spent fuel from the French nuclear 
power plants, as well as Belgium, the Netherlands, Germany, Switzerland 
and Japan are reprocessed at La Hague, which is operated by COGEMA.
