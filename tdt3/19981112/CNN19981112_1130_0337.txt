With the gift-giving season just around the corner, the government 
says the public should keep an eye for bogus charities. The federal 
trade commission today will launch an education campaign to help consumers 
avoid charity fraud. A new survey finds 80% of Americans made at least

weren't sure if the representative was legitimate. 57% didn't bother 
asking how their money would be spent.
