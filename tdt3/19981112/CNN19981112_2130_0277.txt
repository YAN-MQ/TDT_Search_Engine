Secretary of state Madeleine Albright says any military strike on 
Iraq will not be designed with Saddam Hussein as a target. That's 
what Indiana senator Richard Lugar has indicated is necessary to avoid 
future confrontations with Iraq. There are differing views within 
Congress as to the pace and intent of any military action. The president 
has all but declared an impending missile strike. And it is an act 
of war, and I believe the constitution requires that congress authorize 
an act of war before it is entered into. It is true that it appears 
to be an imminent matter, but the Congress can be called into special 
session. The president has full power to do that.
