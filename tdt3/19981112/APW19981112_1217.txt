Big-serving Greg Rusedski was broken for the first time in the tournament, 
but held on for a relatively easy 6-1, 6-4 victory over American Vince 
Spadea in the Stockholm Open on Thursday. The Briton's win set up 
the first ever quarterfinal between two Canadian-born players in the 
tournament, one of the world's oldest indoors. Rusedski, the winningest 
indoor player this year with 31 victories, will face Daniel Nestor 
in Friday's quarterfinals. Nestor, ranked only 115th in the world, 
eliminated Cedric Pioline 6-3, 3-6, 6-3 in Thursday's first second-round 
match at the Royal Tennis Hall. The sixth-seeded Frenchman's exit 
left only three of the eight seeds left in the tournament. Nestor's 
win came less than 24 hours after Aussie Jason Stoltenberg upset world 
No 1 Pete Sampras in a first-rund match. Other seeded players who 
have lost include Karol Kucera (2), defending champion Jonas Bjorkman 
(5) and former two-time Stockholm Open winner Thomas Enqvist (8). 
Thomas Johansson, another Swede seeded No. 7, had an easy 6-2, 6-1 
win over American qualifier Geoff Grant and will next meet Stoltenberg, 
who breezed past Hendrik Dreekmann of Germany 6-2, 6-2. ``I've never 
been in better shape,'' said Johansson, who has moved to 18th on the 
ATP rankings and now is the highest ranked Swedish player. The fourth-seeded 
Rusedski, who beat Sampras in the Paris Open final Sunday for his 
finest victory, has played better and better in each of his three 
stops in Stockholm. Last year he was a semifinalist. ``But I'm just 
taking one step at a time,'' he said. ``I have a difficult opponent 
tomorrow.'' Meeting a Canadian in the quarters doesn't mean Rusedski 
will be extra motivated. ``It won't be different than any other match,'' 
he said. ``I played Daniel at Wimbledon in our last meeting and I 
won in three straight sets. It's just going to be another match out 
there really. I've known him since I was young and we both played 
a few times in juniors as well. It's going to be a good match.'' Rusedski, 
who beat German Tommy Haas 6-1, 6-4 in his first match Wednesday, 
was broken for the first time in the tournament at 3-3 in the second 
set when he hit a forehand volley wide. Spadea had a 40-15 advantage 
in the next game. But Rusedski broke him back to lead 4-3 and then 
held his serve the rest of the way to close out the match in just 
over an hour after the American had saved four match points in the 
last game. ``Vince brought his level up in the second set,'' Rusedski 
said. ``He started serving better. He hit some returns. He started 
picking my serve. He's a very dangerous player. He just goes for broke. 
I knew the first-set result wasn't a true reflection of what he can 
do on a tennis court.'' Pioline, a former U.S. Open and Wimbledon 
finalist who is 16th on the ATP computer rankings, failed to take 
advantage of five break points when tied at 2-2 in the decisive set. 
Nestor finally held, firing an ace past Pioline and then hitting another 
good first serve that the Frenchman couldn't return. Both players 
then held their serves, but Pioline fell behind 15-40 in the eighth 
game. Pioline saved the first break point. But Nestor capitalized 
on a lucky net cord on the second, Pioline's return sailing long. 
Nestor, who was only broken once in the match, then closed out the 
set.
