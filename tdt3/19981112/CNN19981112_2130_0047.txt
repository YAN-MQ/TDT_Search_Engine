Defense secretary William Cohen says the United States is sick of 
the crises that Iraq has created since the 1990 invasion of Kuwait. 
It has ruled out any compromise over the current crisis concerning 
Iraq's refusal to allow U.N. weapons inspectors to do their job. If 
Saddam Hussein's government doesn't reverse course, President Clinton 
says he's ready and willing to use military force. The government 
of Iraq claims it has been cooperating. Deputy prime minister Tariq 
Aziz says the organization overseeing weapons inspections is a dishonest 
body. He says the roadblock to cooperation is the lifting of economic 
sanctions. We don't see any light at the end of the tunnel. With all 
respect to them, they haven't shown us, nobody has shown us a Light 
at the end of the tunnel. There is a tunnel after the tunnel. Each 
time we cooperate and work with Butler and his group, a new tunnel 
is being built after the first one and the third one after the second. 
And that is the experience, the conclusion I reached and the Iraqi 
delegation reached on the 3rd of August. In our last meeting with 
Butler. If Iraq wants to see the Burden lifted, it should stop trying 
to shift blame, take responsibility for living up to the security 
council resolutions and acknowledge that it has failed to cooperate.
