Much more ahead as we continue in the next half hour this evening, 
including an exclusive story out of London newspaper tonight claiming 
a Well-known Iraqi senior official could be in very big trouble. These 
days, seems like everybody's got a Cherokee or an explorer. me? I 
like to stand out a bit. That's why I drive a Subaru outback. With 
a big cargo bay and all-wheel drive, you get all the sport-utility 
you need. With a smooth ride and better gas mileage, the outback is 
far from ordinary. Like me, really. What a weird looking bunch that 
was.
