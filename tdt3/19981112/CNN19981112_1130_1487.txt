The boy Scouts are revising their handbook for the first time in a 
decade. The 450-page manual will include the usual instruction on 
tying knots and building fires. But it also recommends Scouts avoid 
sexual irresponsibility, meeting strangers on the Internet and using 
drugs, alcohol and tobacco. The manual also contains a new section 
called "prepared for life," with advice on getting along with people 
of different ethnic backgrounds.
