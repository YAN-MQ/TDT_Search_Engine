A self-portrait by Jean Michel Basquiat that depicts the artist at 
21 holding a spear in his left hand, his masked face drawn flat, brought 
a staggering $3.3 million at Christie's sale of contemporary art on 
Thursday night, a record for the 1980s graffiti artist. Five determined 
bidders fought for the painting, with its dramatic gray and black 
brush strokes, driving the price to more than five times its high 
estimate of $600,000. The winner, who bid by telephone, was identified 
by the auction house only as a anonymous collector. Although the Basquiat 
was the only piece that sold for more than $1 million, the sale of 
works by mostly 1980s and '90s artists was still a success, totaling 
$9.2 million, just shy of its high estimate, $10 million. Of the 49 
works offered, 42 found buyers. Last spring, Christie's realigned 
the way it sells art, putting only works made since 1970 in its contemporary 
sales and reserving older art, dating from 1900 to 1970, for its 20th-century 
sale, to be held next Thursday. The sale on Thursday of this week 
was only its second contemporary-art auction in New York under the 
new definition. When Christie's decided to form these new categories, 
auction-house executives said the motive was to lure new young buyers. 
But those who could be seen bidding Thursday night were the same old 
familiar faces, demonstrating the aging of the contemporary-art market. 
Little wonder, since some of the subjects of the works sold would 
best be appreciated by the old-timers. The second-highest price of 
the evening was paid for a 1971 Gerhard Richter portrait of Brigid 
Polk, who was one of Andy Warhol's closest friends in the 1960s and 
a star of his film ``Chelsea Girls,'' and whose real name is Brigid 
Berlin. (She was called Polk because of her habit of poking herself 
with a hypodermic syringe full of amphetamine.) Ms. Berlin was in 
the audience Thursday night, watching the portrait sell to an anonymous 
American collector for $750,000, just under its low estimate of $800,000. 
``I was amazed,'' she said after the sale. ``I took Polaroids of myself 
with a self-timer when I was in Munich in 1970 and gave one to Gerhard. 
He wasn't famous then. He gave me one of the portraits, but I gave 
it away because I didn't want a painting of myself hanging in my living 
room.'' Now that it's worth so much, does she want it back? ``No,'' 
Ms. Berlin said. ``That was the past; this is now.'' (Final prices 
include the auction house's commission, 15 percent of the first $50,000 
and 10 percent of the rest. Estimates do not reflect commissions.) 
But even the 1990s works appealed to seasoned collectors rather than 
young speculators. Many people thought the young Wall Street set, 
who would have normally been seen buying at these auctions, were cautious, 
knowing their Christmas bonuses this season wouldn't be as high as 
they had hoped. But that didn't seem to hamper an artist like Robert 
Gober, whose work has sold for strong prices at auction in the last 
few years and was well represented Thursday night. His ``Untitled 
(Man in Drain),'' from 1993-94, which shows the body of a man lying 
at the bottom of a drain, was the image on the cover of the sale catalog. 
It was being sold by Hank McNeil, a Philadelphia collector, with an 
estimate of $450,000 to $650,000. It went to Joel Mallin, a New York 
collector, for $552,500, a record for the artist. Another Gober, ``Dollhouse'' 
(1978), looked more like something you'd find in a toy store than 
in an auction room. Estimated at $60,000 to $80,000, it had five serious 
bidders and finally sold to an anonymous bidder for $68,500. ``Untitled 
(Hairy Shoe),'' from 1992, a child's shoe made of wax with human hair 
inside, was estimated at $25,000 to $35,000 but brought $40,250. Some 
dealers and collectors expressed fears that the high prices fetched 
by 1990s artists would make prices escalate out of control. Auction-house 
experts, however, were quick to disagree. ``I think Gober is one of 
the most important artists in the last 20 years,'' said Philippe Segalot, 
who heads Christie's contemporary-art department worldwide. ``And 
`Man in Drain' was a very smart purchase. It's major work by a major 
artist. This sale showed there's a strong market for cutting-edge 
art.'' Four 1982 photographs by Cindy Sherman, estimated at $80,000 
to $100,000, had three serious takers and ended up selling to a telephone 
bidder for $123,500. The large-format portraits, from a group of 10, 
were shown at Documenta 7 in Kassel, Germany, the year they were made 
and later at the Whitney Museum of American Art. Another high-profile 
artist, Damien Hirst, fared far better than he did in London last 
month. ``Diazepam'' (1993), one of his spot paintings based on a description 
of drugs in a pharmaceutical dictionary, was estimated at $40,000 
to $60,000. It brought $88,300 from Hellie Nahmad, whose new Cork 
Street gallery opened a few months ago. Mona Hatoum, the Lebanon-born 
sculptor who lives in London, was represented Thursday night, her 
first appearance at auction, by her 1993 piece ``A Couple (of Swings),'' 
No. 3 of an edition of three. The work is just what its title suggests: 
a pair of children's swings, but with glass seats. Marc Blondeau, 
a Paris dealer, bought it for $46,000, nicely above its $30,000 high 
estimate. Three bidders wanted to take home a work by another much-talked-about 
artist, Matthew Barney. ``Envelopa: Drawing Restraint 7 (Guillotine),'' 
a 1993 suite of seven still photographs from the opening sequence 
of a video directed by Barney that depicts woodland satyrs from Greek 
mythology, was estimated at $60,000 to $80,000 and finally sold to 
an anonymous bidder for $123,500. There were some casualties, but 
in most cases with good reasons. Another Richter, ``Seascape With 
Bird'' (1970), barely attracted a bid. The painting was expected to 
bring $800,000 to $1.2 million, but nobody was willing to pay more 
than $600,000. In the last six months, two other Richter seascapes 
have sold for more than $2 million each at auction, one at Sotheby's 
in London in June and one at Christie's in New York in May. Both were 
of far superior quality. One of the happiest faces in the crowd leaving 
the sale Thursday night was that of Tony Shafrazi, the SoHo dealer, 
who has shown the works of Basquiat, who died in 1988, since the 1980s. 
``Obviously the market is changing,'' Shafrazi said. ``Basquiat was 
a speculator. Now he's a front-runner.''
