Today, the United States signed the treaty on global warming. It was 
worked out last year at an international gathering in Kyoto, Japan. 
A conference on implementing the treaty is under way in buenos aires. 
Its goal is to work out ways to achieve the reductions in Greenhouse 
gas emissions, as mandated by the Kyoto treaty. The United States 
won't be bound by the accord until it's ratified by the senate, where 
it faces fierce opposition.
