World headlines are up next on the program. This is PRI, Public Radio 
International. The Curtis Institute of Music supports 91 FM. The acclaimed 
Curtis Opera Theater begins its season with a performance of the Broadway 
sensation, The Medium, by Curtis alumnus, John Carlaminotti*. In the 
Curtis Opera Studio on November 18, 20, and 22. The Medium tells the 
tale of Madam Flora, a con artist whose world is turned upside down 
when she is actually contacted by a spirit during a sham saunce*. 
The Medium, a compelling and affecting tragedy of doubt and human 
frailty. 215-893-7902. I am Tony Kahn, still to come. The sacrifices 
a Catholic cop made to join Northern Island's mostly Protestant police 
force. Sadly for me, I left behind all of my friends. I stopped living 
at home, I stopped going home too often. I wanted to divorce my family 
from my career. First, this news.
