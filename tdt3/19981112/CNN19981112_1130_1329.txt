Last night on the ice -- Detroit snapped St. Louis' six-game unbeaten 
streak with a 6-2 victory. Steve Yzerman passed boyhood idol Bryan 
trottier, moving into tenth on the nHL career points list. Phoenix 
remained red hot with a 2-0 victory over Dallas. Jimmy Waite had 38 
saves. Elsewhere, Martin brodeur got his first shutout of the season. 
Toronto is now first in the northeast division. Teemu Selanne is day-to-day 
after straining a right thigh muscle in anaheim's win. And the rangers' 
scoring frenzy came to an end against Florida.
