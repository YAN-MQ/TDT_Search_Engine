This look at "CNN Headline News Weather" begins with a look at Texas. 
The lone star state has been experiencing heavy rainfall, particularly 
in the southeastern portion of the state, over the last 12 to 24 hours, 
and more rain on the way. Rainfall will cover Texas by Friday morning. 
And as we put our map in motion, you can see the low-pressure center 
and the associated frontal boundary spreading some of the rainfall 
to the north and east. Much of the rest of the U.S. will be rather 
quiet, although we do see a new storm moving in through the northwestern 
corner of the United States. Temperatures will be rather moderate 
after a cold blast with a big storm that moved across the country 
earlier in the week. As far as your extended forecast is concerned 
-- in the east, a widespread area of scattered showers and thunderstorms. 
However, probabilities are not high for rainfall in the northeast 
and the mid-atlantic. We may see some thunderstorms along the gulf 
coast, however. Moving on into Sunday, you can see showers still possible 
in the southeast and the northwest. And as you head on into the work 
week next week, showers and thunderstorms again possible in parts 
of the east and northwest. For more weather information, log on to
