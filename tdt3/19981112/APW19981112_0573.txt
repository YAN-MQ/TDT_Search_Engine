Roman Cycowski, the last surviving member of the Comedian Harmonists, 
a legendary vocal group from the 1920s and '30s that was forced apart 
by the Nazis, has died at age 97. Cycowski died Monday at his home 
in Palm Springs, California, the group's original record company, 
EMI Electrola, announced Thursday in Cologne. Cycowski was born Jan. 
25, 1901, in Lodz, which belonged then to Russia but now is part of 
Poland. He came to Germany after World War I and began a singing career 
in theaters and choirs in Berlin before joining with five other young 
singers to form the Comedian Harmonists. Their distinctive, mainly 
a cappella sound became an overnight sensation. The group made more 
than a dozen films and sold millions of records from 1927 to 1935. 
Hits like ``Mein kleiner gruener Kaktus'' (My Little Green Cactus) 
and ``Wochenend und Sonnenschein'' (Weekend and Sunshine) remain standards 
in German-speaking countries. But they began facing problems after 
the Nazis came to power in 1933 because three of the Comedian Harmonists, 
including Cycowski, were Jewish. The group began losing engagements 
because Jews were increasingly banned from professions, including 
appearing on stage. The Nazis included the sextet's music under their 
label of ``degenerate art.'' The Comedian Harmonists went on a world 
tour in late 1934, including a stop in New York. By the time they 
returned home, the Nazis no longer allowed them on stage at all, and 
they decided to disband. The non-Jewish members continued to perform 
in Germany, but never came near the success of the original lineup. 
The Jewish members eventually emigrated. ``If we hadn't been forced 
to break up, we'd be bigger than the Beatles today,'' Cycowski said 
in an interview a few years ago. Cycowski went to Los Angeles in 1941 
with his wife, Mary. After the war, he discovered most of his relatives 
had been killed at Auschwitz. In 1947 he became a cantor at the Beth-Israel 
Temple in San Francisco, where he sang for 25 years. A prize-winning 
film about the group by Joseph Vilsmaier was one of the few homegrown 
box office hits last year in Germany. Last March, Cycowski accepted 
a German record prize on behalf of the original group. He is survived 
by his wife of 73 years. No information on funeral arrangements was 
immediately available.
