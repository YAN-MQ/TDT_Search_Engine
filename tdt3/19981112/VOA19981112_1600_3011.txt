Thank you, Elaine. Senior officials from countries in the Asia Pacific 
region began meeting Thursday in Kuala Lumpur before the APEC Summit 
November 17th and 18th. As Amy Bickers reports from the Malaysian 
capital, increasing trade flows among member economies topped the 
official's agenda. A stock track trade mobilization program was the 
main topic of discussion Thursday as trade officials opened negotiations 
in Kuala Lumpur, Malaysia. The delegates from the 18 member states 
of the Asia Pacific Economic Cooperation Forum are at the first stage 
of talks taking place at this year's APEC gathering. The agreements 
they hammer out in their two-day meeting will be passed on to the 
country trade ministers and finally to the leaders of the nations 
themselves. While the officials discussed the Asian economic crisis 
and how to contain the turmoil, Thursday's meeting focused on a plan 
which has been in the works for several years to open nine main trade 
sectors. They are environmental goods and services, fish and forest 
products, medical equipment, energy, telecommunications, toys, jewelry, 
and chemicals. In all areas, the chemicals tariffs are expected to 
be eliminated with the new tariff free trade policies in place next 
year. The program is expected to liberalize trade worth $1.5 trillion. 
Japan's firm refusal to take part in opening its fisheries and forest 
product sectors continues to be a major sticking point. Abdul Razhoff 
Romley, chairman of the senior officials meeting, said the delegates 
have begun to look beyond Japan to find ways to secure a deal, and 
insisted the fast track program will go ahead anyway. Still, a senior 
U.S. official taking part in the meeting said an agreement that last 
Japan's participation in opening all of the nine sectors would be 
a disappointment since many foreign companies are clamoring for access 
to Japan, the world's second largest economy after the United States.
