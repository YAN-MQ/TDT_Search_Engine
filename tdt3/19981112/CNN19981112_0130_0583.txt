A leading republican is calling for an end to the house Judiciary 
committee impeachment inquiry against President Clinton. Pennsylvania 
senator Arlen specter says the proceeding will tie up the government 
for months. And he says the GOP will not get the 67 votes in the Senate 
to remove the president from office. But specter adds President Clinton 
should be prosecuted after he leaves office.
