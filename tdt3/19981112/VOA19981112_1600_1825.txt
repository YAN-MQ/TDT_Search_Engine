I'm John Birchard for VOA News. The United States is sending more 
military muscle to the Persian Gulf region to increase the pressure 
on Iraq to comply with U.N. weapons inspections. Defense officials 
say 129 additional U.S. war planes and more than 3,000 ground troops 
are going to the region along with a second aircraft carrier battle 
group. Jeff Vanderbush is the pilot of one of a half dozen B52 bombers 
heading to the Gulf from Mynet Air Force Base in North Dakota. He's 
feeling somewhat tense about the mission. A little bit more sense 
of urgency, trepidation, anxiety, but along with excitement. The Clinton 
administration says Iraq must comply with U.N. weapons mandates to 
end the confrontation. Iraq's Deputy Prime Minister Tariq Aziz, accuses 
the United States of blocking any acknowledgment of Iraqi progress 
in implementing the weapons resolutions. He claims Iraq has long and 
hard to comply with the U.N. requirements. The work with UNSCOM is 
not easy. It's bitter, it's difficult, and even it is disgusting. 
But we tolerated it. We tolerated in great patience because we wanted 
to alleviate the hardships of the Iraqi people. We wanted our people 
to live normally. Who's preventing the Iraqi people from living normally? 
It's he and his government with the support of the British government. 
But the Clinton administration doesn't see it that way. State Department 
spokesman James Rubin says the U.S. has been very patient. We have 
pursued the diplomatic role for a long, long time. We are not in a 
rush to use military force. We have given Iraq chance after chance, 
time after time to come back into compliance, and their response, 
as we saw today, is, "Who me?" State Department's James Rubin.
