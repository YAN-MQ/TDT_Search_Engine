Well, in a different kind of football, American National Football 
League football, running back Craig "Iron Head" Hayward of the Indianapolis 
Colts is undergoing surgery Thursday to remove a benign tumor at the 
base of his skull. The 32-year-old running back complained of blurred 
vision in his right eye last Wednesday and underwent specialized tests 
that revealed a growth. Tests revealed the tumor was pressing on Hayward's 
optic nerve. A biopsy of the small tumor revealed that it is benign. 
Hayward was placed on the Colts' nonfootball injury list and will 
miss at least the rest of the season.
