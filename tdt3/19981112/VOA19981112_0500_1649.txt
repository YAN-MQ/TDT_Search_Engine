Many of our local FM and medium wave affiliates are about to take 
a two-minute break. This is VOA News Now. Oh, how the week is flying 
by. It's Thursday, November 12th, 1998 already. On this date in 1884, 
construction began on the first building in the United States to be 
known as a skyscraper. An insurance company hired Chicago architect 
William LeBaron Jennings to design and supervise the construction 
of its ten story headquarters building in the Illinois city. Mr. Jennings' 
design used steel girders to build the framework that supported the 
walls, floors, and roof. Construction techniques were borrowed from 
steel suspension bridges that had been built across major rivers in 
the U.S. Another technological advance in the building was an Otis 
elevator. The design of the new elevator enabled it to move fast and 
perhaps more importantly, to gain the confidence of the riders. It 
had a patented safety device that automatically locked it in place 
if there was a failure in the steam power lift or lifting cable. William 
LeBaron Jennings went on to design four more tall buildings in Chicago.
