Boris Yeltsin canceled a dinner with Japanese Prime Minister Keizo 
Obuchi on Thursday, though the Kremlin insisted it had nothing to 
do with the Russian president's health and said he was feeling fine. 
Prime Minister Yevgeny Primakov attended the dinner in Yeltsin's place, 
according to an agreement worked out with the Japanese delegation 
earlier Thursday, a Kremlin spokesman said on condition of anonymity. 
The spokesman said the cancellation was not connected to Yeltsin's 
health and said he was feeling OK. Yeltsin had been on vacation to 
recover from what aides described as fatigue and high blood pressure. 
The ailments, coming on top of a respiratory infection a month ago, 
have led to renewed speculations about his ability to govern. Earlier 
Thursday, Yeltsin's wife said he feels well after a weeklong vacation 
at a Black Sea resort, but is having trouble adjusting to Moscow's 
freezing weather. After a relatively warm October, temperatures in 
Moscow have dropped to record lows for this time of year, reaching 
-19 degrees C (-2 F) at night, since Yeltsin returned from the Sochi 
resort on Sunday. Yeltsin met with visiting Obuchi earlier Thursday, 
while Yeltsin's wife Naina spent the day touring Moscow with Obuchi's 
wife Tizuko. The Russian president is feeling well, ``only the acclimatization 
is proceeding rather difficultly,'' Naina Yeltsin told Mrs. Obuchi, 
according to the ITAR-Tass news agency. ``I think he will no longer 
feel (the climate change) in a few days,'' Mrs. Yeltsin was quoted 
as saying by the Interfax news agency. She would not say whether Yeltsin 
planned to resume his vacation after Obuchi leaves Moscow. ``We have 
not talked about that,'' Mrs. Yeltsin said. The 67-year-old Russian 
leader has suffered from a range of health troubles in the past, including 
a quintuple heart bypass surgery two years ago. But he insists he 
has no major health problems and intends to serve out his term, which 
runs until mid-2000.
