A New York literary agent is appearing today before the Maryland grand 
jury investigating Linda Tripp. The grand jury is hearing evidence 
about whether Tripp broke Maryland's wiretapping law by secretly recording 
conversations with Monica Lewinsky. Lucianne Goldberg is expected 
to testify about her talks with Tripp that led to the tapings. Goldberg 
has said she incorrectly advised Tripp that taping the phone conversations 
was legal.
