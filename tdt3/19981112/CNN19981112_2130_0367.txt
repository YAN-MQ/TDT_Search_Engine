President Clinton says Americans should not be forced to choose between 
obligations at home and obligations at work. At a White House ceremony 
today, he announced new steps to improve child care, including more 
money for after-school programs. 183 communities in 44 states and 
the district of Columbia can receive $16 million to set up such programs. 
Mr. Clinton says that means 75,000 more children will have a place 
to go when school lets out.
