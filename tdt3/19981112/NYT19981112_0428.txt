The House work schedule _ and the effect it has on members' lives 
_ has emerged as an issue in the down-to-the-wire race for majority 
leader. Rep. Steve Largent of Oklahoma said that Rep. Dick Armey of 
Texas, the current majority leader struggling to keep his job, had 
set such a hectic pace during the last four years that at least 12 
members divorced their spouses. Largent made the remarks in an interview 
on Wednesday with The Washington Times. An aide said Thursday that 
while Largent knew that many factors contributed to divorce, he stood 
by the sentiment that Armey had not set a ``family-friendly'' schedule. 
Scheduling may seem a tangential issue when Republicans are sorting 
out big-picture ideas like what to stand for and how to keep control 
in a House with only a six-vote majority. And it may seem a peculiar 
concern to members who this year spent less time at work than in any 
other Congress in modern history. But the schedule of voting and meetings 
is crucial to members' lives and their well-being, and, as Largent 
suggested, it can ruin relationships. Norman Ornstein, an expert on 
Congress, said that while he was unaware of any statistics on divorce 
in Congress, he ``absolutely'' believed that more had occurred in 
the last four years than in previous four-year segments. Ornstein 
said members of the 1994 class, to which Largent belongs, found the 
House schedule particularly disruptive because so many had vowed not 
to become corrupted by Washington and kept their families back in 
their districts. This set off a cycle of destructive frustration that 
tended to shut spouses out of members' lives, he said. ``This was 
not an unwise thing for Largent to say,'' Ornstein said. ``It resonates 
with people. Most of those who got divorced didn't come here to jettison 
their families and lead the high life. It's a very human story of 
what happens when you have way too many demands and live life in two 
cities.'' Largent's public blame of Armey for a higher-than-normal 
divorce rate raised eyebrows among Armey's supporters, but no one 
disagreed that scheduling was central to members' lives. Armey had 
no comment. But Rep. Frank Wolf of Virginia, who declared his support 
Thursday for Armey, sent a letter to other Republicans saying Armey 
had run the House in a family-friendly fashion by setting a predictable 
schedule. ``Dick Armey understands the importance to members and staff 
of being able to watch a child's soccer game or school play,'' Wolf 
wrote. In an interview, Rep. Jennifer Dunn of Washington, the third 
candidate in the race, who was divorced before she came to Congress 
six years ago, passed up a chance to criticize Largent for blaming 
Armey for the divorces. ``I don't think you're going to split up because 
you're not home for dinner,'' Ms. Dunn said. ``But the scheduling 
could be handled more effectively. I have strengths in scheduling.'' 
She likes the idea of having Congress meet for three consecutive weeks 
then take off for one week. ``If we had a regular schedule that was 
predictable,'' she said, ``people could plan ahead.'' It was not clear 
what sort of schedule Largent would construct, but any efforts at 
a shorter work-week could conflict with plans by Rep. Robert Livingston 
of Louisiana, the likely speaker in the next Congress. Livingston 
had indicated that the House did not work hard enough this year and 
that he would set a more rigorous pace. Still, no one suggests that 
the matter of scheduling will make the outcome of the majority leader 
race itself any more predictable. Republicans of every stripe said 
Thursday that no one had a clear majority and that they expected the 
election, set for Wednesday, would not be settled on the first round 
of voting.
