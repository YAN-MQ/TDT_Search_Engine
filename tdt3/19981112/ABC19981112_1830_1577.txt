Finally from us tonight, the new dinosaur. When we heard that the 
national geographic society in Washington was going to unveil a new 
dinosaur today, several of us looked at each other and said, "A new 
dinosaur? They were wiped out so long ago." A new dinosaur, it is. 
Here's ABC's Bill Blakemore. No way is the dinosaur craze over. Not 
only is a new 3-D imax movie called "T-Rex" attacking packed houses 
-- life, although extinct, is keeping ahead of art. The new dinosaur 
was discovered in the desert of west Africa. There's a certain way 
these teeth interact with these teeth that's not so nice to fish. 
Suchomimus, which means crocodile imitator, looks like a T-Rex trying 
to be a crocodile. Its snout reaching out in a paddle shape the better 
to grab fish with, after wading into the water. It could stand in 
five or six feet of water without its belly touching. So, 12 feet 
high at the hips, it has that quality kids cite most when you ask 
why they like dinosaurs. They're big! They're big. They're really 
big and they come in different sizes. It's like a mystery. It really 
gives you something for your imagination to work out on. The only 
way you can really visualize these creatures is to use your imagination 
of how they live. How many more dinosaurs are there left to discover? 
We've found a very, very, very small percentage of dinosaurs that 
ever lived. Maybe only 1%. So dinosaur lovers still have a lot to 
look forward to. Bill Blakemore, ABC News, New York.
