French authorities on Thursday officially asked Britain to extradite 
former Chilean leader Augusto Pinochet so he can face charges related 
to the disappearance of French citizens. A Justice Ministry statement 
said the extradition request was sent to British authorities via the 
French Foreign Ministry. A French court sent a temporary arrest warrant 
for Pinochet to British authorities on Nov. 3, accusing him of ``sequestration 
followed by torture.'' It was the final step necessary before France 
could officially ask for extradition. Three French families have filed 
complaints against Pinochet in France. The relative of one of them, 
Etienne Pesle, disappeared after military officials arrested him in 
his office in September 1973. He had lived for several years in Chile 
with his Chilean wife and three children. The last report of Pesle 
seen alive was by a Chilean soldier, who said he saw Pesle soon after 
being driven out of a military camp, his hands tied behind his back. 
Pinochet was arrested Oct. 16 in London on a Spanish extradition warrant 
citing charges of genocide, torture and kidnapping during his 17-year 
rule, which began in 1973 when he toppled Salvador Allende. Switzerland 
also has requested Pinochet's arrest and extradition on charges of 
murder, kidnapping and torture. And Chilean exiles in Sweden, Belgium, 
Norway and Germany have filed criminal complaints they hope will lead 
to extradition requests. In Britain Thursday, prosecutors wrapped 
up their appeal of a court ruling allowing Pinochet immunity from 
prosecution there, arguing that the crimes against humanity he is 
charged with ``unequivocally'' violate international law. A report 
by Chile's government says about 3,000 people were killed or disappeared 
at the hands of secret police under Pinochet. Chile has protested 
his arrest, saying it strains the country's democracy.
