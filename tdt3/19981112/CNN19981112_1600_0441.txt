A bullet fired at a federal command post in North Carolina last night 
may have been an accident, but authorities are investigating the incident 
as if it were a deliberate attack. The bullet apparently came from 
a nearby field used by deer hunters. It grazed the hair of an agent 
but did not wound him. The agents are searching for Eric Rudolph, 
who is wanted in the bombing of an Alabama women's clinic and three 
bombings in Atlanta, including one during the 1996 Olympics.
