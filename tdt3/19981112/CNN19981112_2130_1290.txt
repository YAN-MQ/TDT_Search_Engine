John Elway's rib injury is more severe than has been reported, and 
that cnnsi has learned that the Denver quarterback is likely will 
not only miss next Monday's games but will sit out the next two games 
if not more. I'm more mad at myself for not being smarter in the situations 
I've been in this year. I missed last week, I'll miss this week. That's 
five games. At the most, if I was smart, should have been two.
