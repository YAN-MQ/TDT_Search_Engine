At the United Nations today, the United States signed the global warming 
treaty, which is still the subject of very intense debate. The treaty 
commits the United States and other nations to radically reduce, over 
the next decade, the Greenhouse gases which scientists say contribute 
to global warming. The treaty must be ratified by the Senate, where 
there is serious opposition from some senators who say the treaty 
does not commit some developing nations to make the same commitments.
