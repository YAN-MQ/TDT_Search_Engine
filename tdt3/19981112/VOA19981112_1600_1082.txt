Right now, let's hear about the latest in sports from Steve Schy. 
All righty, Erin, thank you very much. A member of the executive committee 
of football's world governing body has traveled to Central America 
to determine what aid FEFA can offer to the victims of Hurricane Mitch. 
Anhel Maria Belar, who is also the president of the Spanish Football 
Federation, flew to Nicaragua Thursday for a firsthand look at the 
needs of that country and Honduras. He's expected to be joined by 
Saso Saso, Costa Rica's member of the FEFA Committee. The two will 
report back to the World Football Organization in time for its meeting 
December 3rd in Zurich where appropriate action will be decided. It 
is also expected to be sent to the football associations of the countries 
affected by Mitch.
