Mayor Deedee Corradini signed off on the new dlrs 1.45 billion Olympic 
budget today and Gov. Mike Leavitt's OK is expected after agreement 
on certain language with the Salt Lake Organizing Committee. Corradini 
announced her approval of the spending plan this morning, saying it 
has adequate contingency plans, strategies for maximizing reserves, 
calls for media housing close to downtown and includes dlrs 3 million 
for ice sheets at Steiner Aquatics Center. ``I am now confident that 
SLOC has created an excellent budget that will allow it to stage the 
games with available funds, reimburse the city for all services it 
requires and provide for the best interests of the people of Salt 
Lake City,'' Corradini said. Leavitt's spokeswoman Vicki Varela said 
an agreement between the governor and SLOC might be signed today, 
or it could take until Friday to finalize wording that reflects ``an 
accurate representation of their expectations and the budget operations.'' 
``What has been important to the governor from the beginning was that 
SLOC didn't commit itself to expenditures in the first year of the 
budget cycle that it wouldn't be able to support through the Olympics,'' 
Varela said Wednesday. ``The most important thing to the governor 
is that the budget balances in the end.'' Varela said the governor 
and SLOC have agreed to several key points: _No more than 60 percent 
of the budget, roughly dlrs 872 million, will be spent or committed 
before October, by which time U.S. Olympic Committee fund-raiser John 
Krimsky has pledged to have reached the sponsorship goal and another 
year of the federal budget process will have been completed. _At all 
times, SLOC will have contingency and reserve funds of at least dlrs 
100 million in the bank. _If a SLOC project or activity comes in under 
budget, the savings will be placed in a contingency fund rather than 
going back to the department. _SLOC's independent auditor, Deloitte 
Touche, will do assessments twice a year to make sure revenues and 
expenditures are on track. _State Olympic Officer John Fowler, an 
auditor, will continue to have continuous access to the books. The 
state also plans to do a top-to-bottom budget review again next year. 
Olympic organizers hope to present the budget to the IOC Executive 
Board next month. The budget is subject to IOC review.
