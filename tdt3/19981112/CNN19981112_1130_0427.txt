Learning to play a musical instrument as a kid may increase brainpower. 
A University study in Hong Kong tested 60 adults and found those with 
at least six years of musical training before age 12 were 16% better

training. Researchers suggest musical training may be an entertaining 
and useful way to improve verbal memory in children.
