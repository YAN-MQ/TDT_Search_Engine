And Marty MacGuire of New Zealand and C.I. Lim of Malaysia shared 
the lead after the first round of the Women's Australian Open Gulf 
Tournament in Melbourne. MacGuire and Lim fired 100 par 72s on the 
Yara Yara Golf Club course. Sweden's Leeza Lachnoyman missed a chance 
to share the lead, and she had a bogie six on the 18th hole. And that's 
a look at sports this hour. I'm Steve Schy.
