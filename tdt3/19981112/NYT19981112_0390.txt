As much as the number he faithfully chose to wear, it was the way 
Sammy Sosa moved, the way he carried himself, that made Roberto Clemente 
Jr. think Sosa had something special inside him that was destined 
to be shared. It was similar to the way his father galloped from the 
batter's box, a lasting vision for the oldest of Roberto Clemente's 
three sons. ``We sat along the first-base line at Forbes Field, so 
we got to see the players as they ran down the line,'' he said. ``To 
me, my father didn't run, he floated. That was how I as a little kid 
could tell he was different.'' Clemente Jr. was 6 on Dec. 31, 1972, 
when he walked into the kitchen of his family's Puerto Rico home, 
looking for his father's plane ticket, a kid's playful habit in trying 
to delay the inevitable. Except this time, the last time, there was 
no ticket, no commercial flight. Roberto Clemente was going on a relief 
mission to earthquake-ravaged Nicaragua. He was going despite what 
Roberto Jr. says he still believes was a premonition of his father's 
death. ``I can still remember just feeling that something wasn't right,'' 
he said. ``I told my mother, `Don't let Daddy go. That plane's going 
to crash.' She yelled at me. I ran outside. He came out and said, 
`I'll come back soon and we'll play catch. I told him, `You're not 
coming back.''' Whatever his 6-year-old imagination had conjured up, 
the reality of that being the last time he would see his father has 
had a profound ethereal effect on Roberto Clemente Jr. At the All-Star 
Game last July, long before Sosa chased Mark McGwire deep into September, 
Clemente and Sosa sought each other out at Coors Field. ``Your father 
is my hero,'' Sosa told him. ``I wear his number. I watched his films. 
I studied his swing.'' Clemente replied with something he knew was 
strange to say to someone he hardly knew. ``My father's spirit is 
with you,'' he said. That is what Clemente strongly suspected as Sosa, 
in this of all seasons, emerged from at least a half-dozen other power-hitters' 
shadows. That is what Clemente decided had to be as he watched Sosa 
juggle baseball and, eerily, his own relief efforts for a Dominican 
Republic battered by Hurricane Georges. Sixty-six home runs, it turned 
out, were a statistical baton, the passing of a legacy, one No. 21 
to another. After the Latino season of Sosa, Clemente came to the 
Yogi Berra Museum on the campus of Montclair State University on Thursday 
to show a film and speak about his father to a group that included 
a baseball team from Essex Catholic High School in nearby East Orange. 
Most of the players were Hispanic kids who had come through Newark's 
Roberto Clemente Little League. The team's best pitcher, Arnaldo Mateo, 
wears No. 21. The coach, Frank Stanco, said Clemente Jr. was, in this 
case, preaching to the converted. ``They already know what Roberto 
Clemente did, why he died,'' Stanco said. ``I've been coaching nine 
years at this school and if I've learned anything, it's that these 
kids have a fierce Latino baseball pride. Because of Sosa this year, 
it just came out that much more.'' Sosa and Juan Gonalez and Pedro 
Martinez and Mariano Rivera and too many more to mention. It gave 
David Kaplan, the Berra Museum's director, the idea to conduct a Spanish 
Heritage Month symposium he titled, ``From Clemente to Sosa.'' It 
was, as much for the purpose of celebration, to examine the extant 
cultural barriers. We had an example of one just this week in New 
York, as the Mets so conveniently bypassed Omar Minaya _ Sammy Sosa's 
discoverer _ to dust off Frank Cashen as Steve Phillips' temporary 
replacement. The Mets said they wanted to continue their troubled 
general manager's program. Who better than his hand-picked assistant? 
``I hate to be a spoilsport but there are some important issues to 
deal with precisely because of the proliferation of the Latino player,'' 
said Roberto Gonzalez Echetarria, who teaches Hispanic and comparative 
literature at Yale and whose book on Cuban baseball will be released 
next season. He mentioned, for one, the widespread use of Latino youngsters 
as cheap and, ultimately, disposable talent. Some players are so essential 
they wind up speaking, moving, even giving their lives for others. 
From Clemente to Sosa, the Latino baseball community at least has 
itself a galvanizing leader for the 21st century. ``We've been waiting 
for someone like my dad, someone like Sammy, for a long, long time,'' 
Clemente Jr. said.
