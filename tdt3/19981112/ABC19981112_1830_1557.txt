A brief review of the top story. The U.S. said it will attack Iraq 
very soon if President Saddam Hussein doesn't abide by the rules for 
international weapons inspections. Iraqis said today there's a standoff 
because the U.S. won't allow economic sanctions to be lifted. A bad 
situation getting worse.
