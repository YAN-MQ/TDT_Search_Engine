U.S. PGA golf champion B.J. Singh of Fiji has fired his 66th at the 
Thai country club near Bangkok to take the lead in the four-country 
Johnny Walker Super Tour. Singh hit six birdies to go to a two-round 
total of eight under par 130, and that is two shots ahead of defending 
champion Jasper Parnavick of Sweden and 1997 winner, Ernie Elles, 
from South Africa.
