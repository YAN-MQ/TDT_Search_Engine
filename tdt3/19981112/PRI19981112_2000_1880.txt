There has been a violent and bloody confrontation in Indonesia. Pro-democracy 
student demonstrators have clashed with security forces in the capital, 
Jakotta*. Observers say the bitter scenes were reminiscent of the 
troubles in May which brought down President Suharto*. Jonathan Head 
reports. Jakotta echoed to the sound of gunfire as mass ranks of soldiers 
and riot police tried to push back a sea of students swarming down 
towards the national parliament from two directions. The line held, 
the protesters were eventually forced to retreat. But there was some 
bitter scenes, students tearfully squatting in front of armored vehicles 
on the deserted motorway which runs past the parliament. Others with 
bloodied heads pleading with the troops to let them through. Jonathan 
Head, BBC News, Jakotta.
