Monica Lewinsky may soon do an interview for big bucks, or francs, 
or pounds. Her representatives are negotiating overseas for her to 
do a television interview. Her price could be at least $2 million. 
That would put a significant dent in Lewinsky's legal bills, which 
have accumulated over the past ten months. A possible interview with 
Barbara Walters has been put on hold, because most U.S. news organizations 
do not pay for interviews.
