House Democratic leader Richard Gephardt on Thursday scathingly criticized 
the congressional investigation of President Clinton, accusing Republicans 
of wasting weeks when they could have been focusing on disputed material. 
In an hourlong interview, Gephardt made clear that despite his criticism, 
he wanted the House to finish the inquiry this year. But he still 
called on Republicans to conduct a fair and thorough investigation 
in that period. He said Republicans were putting Congress in the position 
of having to vote on impeachment with only the independent counsel's 
report as evidence. ``They needed to really get on this, really do 
a good job and really work hard, and they just didn't do it, partly 
because I don't think they understood what the impact was politically,'' 
said Gephardt of Missouri. He said he expected the full House to vote 
on articles of impeachment, ``on or about Dec. 15,'' but he did not 
predict the outcome. Gephardt's comments were his most pointed and 
detailed critique of the Republican-led inquiry headed by Rep. Henry 
Hyde, R-Ill. Republicans on the panel dismissed Gephardt's complaints. 
``The minority leader is apparently working from the same playbook 
as the White House and committee Democrats, which is avoid the facts 
and attack the process,'' said a Republican committee spokeswoman, 
who spoke on condition on anonymity. ``Moreover, if we had taken some 
action before the election, it's certain that we would have been attacked 
by the Democrats for conducting the inquiry in a political manner,'' 
the spokeswoman said. Gephardt questioned the committee's decision 
to call Independent Counsel Kenneth Starr on Nov. 19 as its first, 
and so far, only witness, although many Democrats on the panel were 
demanding a few weeks ago that Hyde summon Starr. ``I can't figure 
out what he's going to say, other than reading the report, and most 
people can read who are on the committee,'' Gephardt said. Starr may 
``raise the specter'' of his other unresolved inquiries _ involving 
the White House travel office and former Justice Department official 
Webster Hubbell _ Gephardt said. Asked how Democrats would respond 
if that happened, Gephardt said with a laugh, ``Complain.'' Democrats 
should avoid questioning Starr about how he conducted his inquiry, 
Gephardt said. ``We don't have time now to do what we were supposed 
to do, much less go off on another wild goose chase,'' he said. The 
Republicans' first big mistake, Gephardt said, was not establishing 
bipartisan standards for impeachment after voting on Oct. 8 for a 
formal inquiry. That would have allowed lawmakers to compare Starr's 
findings with the standards to determine if further investigation 
was even warranted. The next misstep, Gephardt said, was not quickly 
identifying disputed facts and focusing on them. ``What did Betty 
Currie do or didn't do?'' said Gephardt, referring to Clinton's personal 
secretary, who retrieved gifts the president had given to Monica Lewinsky. 
``We don't have to drag everybody before the committee and have a 
circus,'' Gephardt said. ``You can go out and do depositions with 
these people. I just don't think it's sensible for the Congress to 
just take this thing from Ken Starr and say we assume all of this 
is true.'' The Judiciary Committee sent Clinton a questionnaire last 
week, asking him to say flatly whether he had lied under oath, obstructed 
justice or tampered with witnesses. White House spokesman James Kennedy 
said Thursday that White House lawyers were still mulling over the 
request. But Gephardt asked why the committee didn't send the 81 questions 
to the president sooner. ``Why did they wait until after the elections 
to send the questions?'' he said. ``They could have had a deposition 
of the president or sent him interrogatories and gotten answers. Anything 
they didn't like the answer to they could have then gone back with 
other questions.'' Democrats acknowledge that meeting Hyde's goal 
of finishing by year's end is ambitious. ``That's why we were out 
six weeks ago saying, let's start now,'' Gephardt said. ``The committee 
could have worked right up to the election. They sat for two weeks 
while we were doing the whole budget.'' When Congress adjourned before 
the mid-term elections, committee members left, too, though most of 
them did not face tough races, Gephardt said. ``They could have had 
the staff at least doing some of the depositions if they had agreed 
on what they needed to find out,'' he said. ``They didn't do anything. 
They sat.''
