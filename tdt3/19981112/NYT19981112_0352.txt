When Sharron Davies was at her peak, she won a silver medal for Britain 
in the 400-meter individual medley at the 1980 Summer Olympics. But 
Petra Schneider, an East German swimmer, still finished more than 
10 seconds ahead of her to take the gold and set a world record. Davies 
was convinced then that Schneider had an unfair advantage, and 18 
years later she believes she has proof after speaking with Schneider 
in August and digging through East German state files. Now with the 
help of the British Olympic Association, she wants the International 
Olympic Committee to offer her some form of justice. ``A crime is 
a crime whether it was 50 years ago, five years ago or five minutes 
ago,'' Davies said Thursday. ``You will never be able to give me or 
other swimmers back our moment of standing up on the podium, but to 
be able to put it straight in the record books would be a step in 
the right direction.'' The British Olympic Association filed the petition 
on behalf of Davies. The U.S. Olympic Committee has filed a similar 
petition on behalf of the U.S. women's medley relay team that finished 
second to the East Germans at the 1976 Olympics. Both appeals will 
be evaluated by the IOC's executive board on Dec. 11-14 in Lausanne, 
Switzerland, and the potential repercussions are enormous if the IOC 
decides to order a revision of history. According to IOC executive 
director Francois Carrard, the executive board could make a ruling 
or refer the petitions to the general assembly. It could also elect 
to explore the petitions further at the conference on doping that 
the IOC has scheduled for February in Lausanne. The chances of the 
IOC making a radical move do not appear great. Last month, Jacques 
Rogge, an executive board member, said: ``There is absolutely not 
going to be any change for things that happened more than 10 years 
ago. At this stage, we still have no documented evidence of doping 
of an athlete on the day of Olympic competitions.'' But Carrard was 
less categoric Thursday. ``There have been comments from members of 
the board that, in principle, the IOC doesn't think it should rewrite 
history or re-allocate medals, but I think we are going to see if 
some form of recognition can be instituted in some cases,'' said Carrard, 
who added that he had received Britain's request several days ago. 
``The word `recognition' is the word I would emphasize.'' Neither 
the USOC nor the British is asking the Germans to relinquish their 
medals. ``I wouldn't like to see medals stripped,'' Davies said. ``And 
if you ask me, it's a bit too late to reissue medals, but a certificate 
or a rewrite of the record books would be satisfactory to me.'' Last 
summer, Davies, who is now a television reporter, spent several weeks 
in Germany, seeking evidence to present to the IOC and material for 
a television program that will air in Britain on Sunday. During her 
research, she interviewed Schneider and her countrywoman Rica Reinisch, 
who won both backstroke events at the 1980 Olympics. ``She said she 
was put on a doping program at age 14 and originally told that they 
were just little blue pills,'' Davies said of Schneider. ``She then 
knew changes were taking place in her body, and by the time she was 
16 or 17, she was aware that she was taking something illegal but 
by that time she was worried that if she rejected it, her father might 
lose his job or something. That's the very sad part of this. It wasn't 
a simple, straightforward thing.'' Davies added: ``Both Petra and 
Rica Reinisch have heart problems, and all the side effects that are 
apparent with steroid abuse. But the fact is they had very little 
choice. If I had been in East Germany at that time, I could have been 
one of those people, too. But I do think the IOC should be held fairly 
accountable that more was not done at the time. It's not like this 
is all a surprise. The East Germans were dominating out of all proportion. 
It was obvious to everyone what was going on.'' Davies now supports 
life bans for proven drug users in sport, but she recognizes that 
her former opponents have already experienced a form of punishment. 
``Petra has been told at the age of 35 that she could die of a heart 
attack at any moment, Davies said, ``and she has an 8-year-old girl.'' 
Davies and her husband, Derek Redmond, have a 5-year-old son, Elliott. 
Davies is deeply ambivalent about the prospect of her son choosing 
the family business. ``Part of me is proud and wants him to do sport 
and part of me worries to death about what he would have to do to 
himself to do his best,'' she said.
