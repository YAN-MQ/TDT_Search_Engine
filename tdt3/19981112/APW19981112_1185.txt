It was a monster dinosaur built for catching fish, with razor teeth, 
a long snout and foot-long curved claws that could hook and hold the 
big ones. Researchers who found the fossil of this 36-foot-long (10 
meters) animal believe it is a previously unknown species big enough 
and mean enough to have dominated its world 100 million years ago. 
The new species, to be called Suchomimus tenerensis, ``was an impressive-sized 
beast,'' said Paul Sereno, a University of Chicago paleontologist 
who found the fossils last year in Africa. ``If you were standing 
next to it, your eye level would be at its knee,'' Sereno said at 
a news conference at National Geographic headquarters Thursday. ``This 
animal was easily the size of Tyrannosaurus rex. And it was not fully 
grown.'' Suchomimus apparently was a fish eater, said Sereno, but 
it could threaten virtually anything around it. ``With its forearms 
and its jaws, it would have been able to take down just about anything,'' 
Sereno said. ``It was the dominant predator of its time.'' The animal 
was generally shaped like the T. rex, with two large hind legs, a 
powerful tail, forearms and a toothy head, Sereno said in a study 
being published Friday in the journal Science. But Suchomimus was 
a member of a group of animals called spinosaurids that lived in the 
lands that became Africa, Europe and South America between 90 million 
and 120 million years ago. At that time, T. rex was just emerging 
in North America. The discovery ``provides important new insights 
on the evolution and adaptation'' of the spinosaur group of dinosaurs, 
said Thomas R. Holtz Jr., a University of Maryland researcher. The 
fossil was found in Niger, a central African country on the southwestern 
edge of the Sahara. In the dinosaur era, the area ``was a lush climate 
that could support many different species of dinosaurs,'' Sereno said. 
The animal's most distinctive feature is its long, pointed jaw, armed 
with about 100 teeth. The end of the jaw is tipped with an extra chin-like 
projection, called a rosette, that actually contains the largest teeth. 
The top and bottom teeth mesh together to securely hook prey, a design 
common among fish-eating animals. ``The jaw is really very much like 
a crocodile's,'' Sereno said. ``It was built for snaring and swallowing.'' 
Suchomimus' teeth also are typical of fish-eating crocodiles, lightly 
curved and hooked and not designed for chewing. The animal's thumbs 
were about 16 inches (40 cm) long and tipped with 12-inch (30cm) claws 
curved like a sickle. The two fingers on each hand had shorter, curved 
claws. ``The hand is amazing,'' Sereno said. ``It was probably ideal 
for fishing, for grabbing ... into those large fish.'' It's not known 
how the newly discovered Suchomimus died, but it apparently was swept 
into a river, rolled over and over and was then buried by soil. When 
found in extreme desert, wind had eroded the sands that had covered 
it for 100 million years.
