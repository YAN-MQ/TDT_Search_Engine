The United States has signed a global warming treaty but President 
Clinton still faces an uphill battle to win Senate ratification of 
the agreement. A U.S. representative to the United Nations signed 
the treaty today in New York. All other major industrialized nations 
have already signed the pact which is aimed at reducing the emission 
of greenhouse gases blamed for global warming. U.S. officials hope 
signing the accord will help them convince developing nations to cut 
greenhouse gas emissions. Delegation chief Stewart Eisenstat comments 
on that aspect of the issue. We don't expect to fill the additional 
commitments actually made here, but clearly, the ball is moving in 
the right direction and we're really beginning to break the ice in 
terms of getting developing countries engaged. Stewart Eisenstat. 
Some U.S. senators have expressed strong opposition for the agreement.
