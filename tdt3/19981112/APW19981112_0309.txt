A U.N. agency on Wednesday boosted its deliveries of food aid to the 
tens of thousands of people whose homes and crops were destroyed by 
Hurricaine Mitch and now risk malnourishment and disease. The Rome-based 
World Food Program said it would distribute 116,238 tons of food over 
the next six months to people in Honduras, Nicaragua, Guatemala and 
El Salvador. Mitch killed an estimated 10,000 people and left tens 
of thousands homeless. About 60 percent of the food aid will go to 
women and children under six who live in rural communities where the 
traditional livelihood of subsistence farming has been destroyed and 
most people lack cash to buy food. ``Without emergency assistance, 
these people are at extreme nutritional risk -- in addition to facing 
the threat of cholera and other diseases from unsanitary conditions 
throughout the region,'' Catherine Bertini, WFP executive director, 
said in a statement. The agency said it would distribute mainly rice, 
maize, canned fish and vegetable oil, for a total value of approximately 
dlrs 58 million.
