36 years ago, New York City honored John Glenn with a big tickertape 
parade for being the first American to orbit earth. On Monday, the 
scene will repeat itself when the city honors Glen and his fellow 
"discovery" astronauts. They'll be given keys to the city. Yesterday, 
thousands of people lined streets in Houston for a veterans day parade 
honoring Glenn and his six crewmates.
