If and when the U.S. strikes, the first weapon of choice will surely 
be the tomahawk cruise missile. In fact, the U.S. seems to fire them 
so often these days, there's even an informal name for the strategy 
-- tomahawk diplomacy. We continue "in depth" with NBC's Robert Hager. 
The cruise missile. It punishes dramatically without putting U.S. 
lives on the line, because it's fired from hundreds of miles away. 
At a cost of about $1 million each, it uses rocket power to launch. 
But to reach the target, an engine, like a jet plane's, takes over, 
and wings pop out. In front, the warhead. And a TV camera that compares 
the target to computer images, to help with accuracy. As to the warhead 
-- Two main ones, one is what we call a unitary warhead, which is 
a single explosive warhead. And another one is a fragmented bomblet 
warhead, which would dispense bomblets. First used in combat in the 
gulf war, the U.S. has fired them since in raids in Iraq, Bosnia, 
and, this past summer, in Afghanistan and sudan. How accurately? The 
Pentagon uses the idea of a football field. It says if the target 
were the 50 yard line, half the missiles would hit within 15 yards. 
Most of the rest on the field, but a few in the stands or even outside 
the stadium. It doesn't go through the third window in the third building 
on the third floor. It doesn't do that. So that's a disadvantage. 
But it's good enough to take the building out. And, there's an even 
better version now under development -- the amazing next generation 
missile, will use a better camera right here in the nose, that can 
send pictures back to far-away controllers. When it reaches the target 
area, the missile will be able to circle for up to two hours while 
target specialists on the ground study those pictures and decide precisely 
where and when to hit. And in the gulf tonight, those 300 cruise missiles, 
poised for the launch code, ready to deliver punishment or diplomatic 
message, without putting U.S. forces in the line of fire. Robert Hager, 
NBC news, Washington.
