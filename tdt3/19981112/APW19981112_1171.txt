Five inmates escaped from a Russian prison through a hole in a brick 
wall, a news report said Thursday. One of the escapees was caught 
soon afterward in the city of Leninsk in southern Russia, but the 
other four were still at large, a police spokesman said Thursday, 
according to the ITAR-Tass news agency. The prison is in the Volgograd 
region near Leninsk, about 900 kilometers (550 miles) southeast of 
Moscow. The report did not say when the prisoners escaped or what 
they were imprisoned for, or give any other details of the escape.
