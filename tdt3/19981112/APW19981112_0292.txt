China sees tensions easing between North and South Korea and welcomes 
improving relations between the two rivals, Chinese President Jiang 
Zemin told South Korean President Kim Dae-jung Thursday. At the start 
of Kim's five-day visit, the two leaders sealed their countries' solid 
ties by agreeing to a new ``partnership for the 21st century,'' Chinese 
Foreign Ministry spokesman Zhu Bangzao said at a briefing. Jiang and 
Kim signed an agreement to lay out the partnership after their 2 1-2-hour 
meeting. In a speech at Peking University, Kim later said the accord 
would expand cooperation to all areas beyond the healthy economic 
ties they have enjoyed since opening diplomatic relations six years 
ago. Kim and Jiang planned to release details of the agreement in 
a joint statement Friday. It was expected to include pledges of more 
official visits, efforts to reduce China's dlrs 3.5 billion trade 
deficit and a South Korean promise of dlrs 5.3 million in loans and 
industrial cooperation. Rapidly improving ties between Beijing and 
Seoul have complicated political relations in Northeast Asia. China 
fought on the North's side in the 1950-53 Korea War and is Pyongyang's 
last remaining major communist ally, but relations have been strained 
in recent years. Closer relations between Beijing and Seoul were ``not 
directed against any third party,'' said Zhu, the Chinese government 
spokesman. ``We will continue to maintain and develop our relations 
with North Korea.'' Jiang told Kim that China wants to safeguard peace 
and stability on the Korean Peninsula and believes ``the situation 
on the whole is relaxing,'' Zhu said. With North and South Korea are 
still technically at war, China is working with the United States 
to mediate peace talks and ease tensions on the peninsula. Kim told 
the university students he would ask Beijing to play a more active 
role in the talks. ``The region must be safeguarded from such weapons 
of mass destruction as nuclear bombs and missiles,'' Kim said. China 
and South Korea are each other's third largest trading partners, with 
a trade volume last year of dlrs 23.7 billion. South Korea also is 
the second largest foreign investor in China, with South Korean companies 
having invested dlrs 3.5 billion as of May. Kim said China helped 
South Korea avoid even greater suffering in the Asian financial crisis 
by resisting pressure to devalue its currency, the yuan. A devaluation 
by China to spur its lagging exports could set off another round of 
devaluations in Asia. After their meeting, Kim and Jiang attended 
a signing ceremony for agreements on cooperation in judicial affairs, 
simplification of visas, youth exchanges and railways. Making his 
first visit to China since becoming president in February, Kim is 
visiting with a delegation of about 250 people, including heads of 
major South Korean conglomerates. Kim also is scheduled to meet with 
Premier Zhu Rongji, who is in charge of China's economic reforms, 
and visit Shanghai, the country's financial center.
