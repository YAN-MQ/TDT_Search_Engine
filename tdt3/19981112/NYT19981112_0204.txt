Very few actors could pull off a one-man show about Henry VIII, much 
less a one-man musical. Richard Burton, probably, with his ``Camelot'' 
voice, but not many others. Steeve Arlen, however, comes very close 
in ``Eight! Henry VIII, That Is!,'' and he does it on the tiny, bare 
stage of the Tribeca Playhouse. Arlen (who reportedly spells his given 
name with the double e on the advice of a numerologist) is a large 
man with a powerful, kingly stance and a kingly Welsh voice. Dressed 
in a purple robe, he proceeds in 90 minutes or so to review Henry's 
life, which means primarily his six marriages, with 15 musical numbers 
in a motley assortment of styles. In the love songs to the wives, 
Arlen sounds something like Robert Goulet. In ``Cromwell's Report,'' 
when he sings, ``There was something rotten blowing in from Rome,'' 
he seems to be impersonating Louis Armstrong. The accompaniment to 
``No Entrado,'' a lament about the king's first marriage, to Catherine 
of Aragon, sounds as if it were being played by a traditional guitarist 
in a Mexican restaurant. Arlen, who starred in ``La Cage aux Folles'' 
on Broadway in the mid-1980s, has a grand voice, and the songs of 
``Eight!,'' which he wrote with Donald Eugster, are pleasant if unmemorable. 
But you could cut every song (please) and have a powerful one-man 
drama. Arlen is touching, witty and thoroughly convincing in the role 
of Henry, a chronically unhappy monarch who nonetheless never suffered 
from a shortage of self-esteem. When he mourns the death of Thomas 
More, his regret seems genuine. (``I lost a dear friend. But I was 
a king. It had to be done.'') Too bad he had to behead someone he 
liked. The notorious Henry seems truly alive onstage; very possibly 
insane, but believably so. Arlen wrote the play as well, with a winning 
combination of the lyrical (``I was drunk with the promise of Anne,'' 
referring to his second wife, Anne Boleyn); the knowingly humorous 
(``For those of us keeping score, that is two down and four to go,'' 
after he describes Anne's beheading), and the deliberately contemporary 
(``I thought my dad was going to have a fit''). In the scene in which 
Henry arrives at Parliament, drunk, Arlen goes into the aisles and 
interacts with the audience. Where lesser men would falter, he holds 
character with royal sureness. But why he chooses to make his entrance 
as Henry VIII shouting about his chamber pot, and then turns his back 
to the audience and simulates urination, is a mystery. Maybe the idea 
is to humanize Henry from the beginning, but the device is offputting 
and unnecessary. PRODUCTION NOTES: `EIGHT! Henry VIII, That Is!' Book
