The United States is strengthening its military presence in the Persian 
gulf, as all this goes on. 12 B-52 bombers are moving from bases in 
Louisiana and North Dakota to diego Garcia island. President Clinton 
has authorized 3,000 additional U.S. army ground troops to supplement 
American forces. 3,000 soldiers from FT. Stewart in southeast Georgia 
have been told to prepare tore deployment. Nearly 400 air force personnel 
will leave Travis air force base in california over the next few days. 
A tearful fare well. Return date unknown. For this family, it was 
a call out of the blue. We got the news this morning at about 7:00. 
I was getting ready to go to work. And all of a sudden my husband 
says, you're not going in. We have to get everything together to go 
to the Middle East. I don't like that. Because he's going away on 
the holidays. 400 air force personnel from Travis air force base in 
California reported for duty on a moment's notice. Most are crews 
for equipping and maintaining the KC-10 extender. An aircraft that 
refuels other aircraft midair. More than six left the Middle East 
Thursday. It carries not only cargo, but also a tremendous amount 
of fuel. It can refuel any aircraft in the inventory. For some, it 
is deja vu. People deployed from Travis last year, same season, same 
destination. I feel excited. This is not my first time. It is not 
going to be my last. Something his wife knows only too well. It is 
tough, especially during the holidays because that's family time. 
I knew what I was getting into when I married him. So I knew that 
he was going to be deployed, but I didn't know this much. Its taps 
first deployment for some. And there wasn't enough time for fare Wells. 
Didn't get a chance to say good-bye. So bye, girls. I love you very 
much. I'll be back when I'm back. First-timers know there seems to 
be no hesitation on the part of those going. We got to do whatever 
we have to do. Whatever they have to do, it is unlikely they'll be 
home before thanksgiving. Rusty Dornin, Travis air force base, California.
