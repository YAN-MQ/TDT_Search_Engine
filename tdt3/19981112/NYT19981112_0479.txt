It was advertised by a Manhattan auction house in 1995 as ``the first 
substantial moon rock ever available for sale.'' It turned out to 
be more of the backyard variety, a federal grand jury charged Thursday. 
In what the authorities said was a scheme to defraud unsuspecting 
buyers of millions of dollars, two brothers from Georgia were indicted 
Thursday on charges of conspiring to sell pieces of a fake moon rock 
that they said had been given to their late father by Sen. John Glenn, 
the former Mercury astronaut, who recently returned to space. The 
two men, Brian and Ronald Trochelmann of Atlanta, had been telling 
people that their father was given the rock in honor of an invention 
he had made for the space program, the indictment said. But that was 
also untrue, federal authorities said Thursday. The indictment charged 
that Ronald Trochelmann embarked on the scheme to sell the fake moon 
rock with his brother after watching a television show in 1994 about 
the 25th anniversary of the Apollo moon landing. The Trochelmann brothers 
were each charged with conspiracy and wire fraud and could receive 
up to five years in prison if convicted, said federal prosecutors 
in Manhattan. But lawyers for both men denounced the charges Thursrday, 
saying that their clients had each acted in the belief that the rock 
was genuine, and that they had based their view on an expert's opinion. 
``Our position is that it is a moon rock,'' said Paul F. Callan, the 
lawyer for Ronald Trochelmann. Even if that turns out not to be true, 
he said, his client will still be innocent of the charges because 
he ``sincerely believed that it was moon rock.'' ``Either way, this 
is a case with reasonable doubt written all over it,'' Callan said. 
Drew Findling, who represents Brian Trochelmann, concurred. He said 
his client had acted on the basis of what his late father had told 
him. To say that he perpetrated fraud because he believed in his father 
and did not ``hire a private investigator to find out if his father 
was a truthful and believable person,'' Findling said, ``is ridiculous.'' 
Government officials said Thursday that the rock, which was composed 
of a combination of dark gray, grainy and white crystalline material, 
was never actually sold. The fist-sized rock was seized by the Federal 
Bureau of Investigation in 1995 just before it was to be offered at 
auction by Phillips Son &AMP; Neale, which the government said was 
unaware that there were questions about the rock. A spokesman for 
the auction house, Deborah Seidel, said Thursday night that it was 
``committed to protecting the integrity of the auction process, and 
from the beginning we have cooperated fully with the government on 
this matter.'' An official with the space program said that of the 
840 pounds of moon rock collected by astronauts, virtually all of 
it was still in government control, and that private sales should 
be immediately considered suspect. ``There certainly is a strong collector 
value to them,'' said Gary E. Lofgren, lunar curator at the Johnson 
Space Center in Houston. As for Glenn, who never visited the moon, 
his spokesman, Jack Sparks, said, ``John Glenn never owned any moon 
rock and has never given away any moon rock.''
