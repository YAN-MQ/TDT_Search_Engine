This is The World. A co-production of the BBC World Service, PRI, 
and WGBH Boston. It is Thursday, November 12. I am Tony Kahn. Today 
Arabs tell Iraq you cannot count on us and Palestinians tell Israel 
you can count on a Palestinian state. For the fist time, Palestinians 
are reestablishing their identity, rediscovering their symbols, and 
reeducating themselves and their society about building an independent 
state owned Palestinian soul. Plus, Cole Porter* spawns a hit in Sweden. 
First, this news. From National Public Radio News in Washington I 
am Kory Flintoff.
