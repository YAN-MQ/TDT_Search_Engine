The New York Times said in an editorial on Friday, Nov. 13: The Supreme 
Court will review an Iowa law this term that gives the police what 
amounts to blanket authority to search an automobile after issuing 
the driver a citation for speeding or any other routine traffic violation. 
The case is important to anyone who cares about civil liberties, and 
for that matter to anyone who drives a car. Over the past few years, 
the court has significantly expanded the authority of police in ``traffic 
stop'' situations. In doing so it has watered down the Constitution's 
prohibition of unreasonable searches and seizures and granted the 
police uncomfortably broad discretion to make traffic stops as a pretext 
to search. The moment has arrived for the justices to draw the line. 
The Iowa law authorizes police officers to issue a citation ``in lieu 
of arrest or in lieu of continued custody'' for a variety of offenses. 
But it also gives officers who issue such citations the same authority 
to search that they would have if they had made a formal arrest. The 
idea that police may conduct otherwise unjustified searches incident 
to issuing a traffic ticket offends the Fourth Amendment's basic requirement 
of reasonableness. Twenty-five years ago the court validated a practice 
known as ``search incident to arrest'' as an exception to the ordinary 
rule that a search must be supported by probable cause, or at least 
some level of particularized suspicion. But the court's rationale 
for carving out the exception _ to preserve evidence and to protect 
the arresting officer's safety _ is inapplicable to a simple speeding 
violation, for which no one has been taken into custody. At the court's 
recent hearing in the Iowa case, Justice Anthony Kennedy made an apt 
observation. Rather than a search incident to arrest, he said, the 
state was seeking authority for ``arrest incident to search.'' For 
the sake of civil liberties and constitutional clarity, the justices 
should reject that backward logic.
