Sang Lan was in kindergarten in China when a recruiter from a state 
gymnastics school arrived to measure her arms and legs, just as he 
did with the other children. In her case, the numbers added up to 
the body of a potential gymnast _ and plucked her from one life into 
another. By the age of 6, she was in gymnastics school in her hometown 
on China's southeast coast. By 8 she had moved four hours by car from 
her parents, who visited once a month. By 10, she was receiving a 
salary from the State Sports Commission. By 12, she was on the national 
team in Beijing, a two-hour flight from her parents, who by this time 
were visiting only twice a year. Far from feeling neglected, she was, 
in her culture, a young woman of great privilege _ supported by the 
state and chosen for a life of relative riches. ``It was a lot of 
work,'' Ms. Sang, 17, recalled this week in a friend's apartment in 
New York. ``But it was a very happy life.'' Among the rewards was 
a trip in July to New York for the Goodwill Games, the mini-Olympics 
started by Ted Turner during the 1980s boycotts of the real thing. 
Ms. Sang had dreams for Sydney in 2000. But on July 21, in a routine 
warm-up vault at the Nassau Coliseum, Ms. Sang landed hard on her 
head. The injuries to her spine were catastrophic; she was paralyzed 
from the chest down. She is not expected to recover the use of her 
legs. Ms. Sang disagrees. ``I believe I will walk again,'' she said 
on Wednesday during an hourlong interview in the apartment of a friend, 
Winston Sie, in a modern high-rise on East 38th Street. ``This is 
all a big lesson.'' Not that there aren't dark times. ``Usually when 
I feel bad it's at night,'' she said. ``But I go to sleep and everything's 
better in the morning.'' Ms. Sang's accident was a terrible summer 
news story that developed into a tale of courage. Leonardo DiCaprio, 
Jimmy Carter and Jackie Chan visited her in the hospital; Celine Dion 
came by to sing ``My Heart Will Go On.'' Back home, Ms. Sang has become 
a media star, and has been offered a full scholarship to Qinghua University, 
the MIT of China. But here she is a persevering New Yorker whose life 
centers on rehabilitation and worries about her future. On Oct. 30, 
Ms. Sang was discharged from the Mount Sinai-New York University Medical 
Center. She now spends six hours a day in therapy at the Rusk Institute 
of Rehabilitation Medicine in Manhattan. Then she returns to her friend's 
apartment for tutoring in English, math and computer skills. ``I don't 
have time to think about what I'd like to do,'' Ms. Sang said, with 
Sie translating. ``I'm just following the schedule.'' Sie, 25, is 
a Chinese-American studying at New York University. His mother, Gina 
Liu, is an official of the Chinese Gymnastics Association. Ms. Sang 
talked while lying on a gym mat in the living room, although sometimes 
Sie helped her to a sitting position. Her mother, Xiufeng Chen, who 
works in a leather factory in China, was preparing dinner; her father, 
a government housing worker, has gone back to China. Ms. Sang has 
some use of her arms and wrists, and was happy to offer a cookie from 
her own hand. ``I like these,'' she said in English, amused. Ms. Sang 
still has the crisp body of a gymnast. From her neck up, she is vital, 
fearless and perceptive. She cannot forget her accident. ``I remember,'' 
she said. Does she wonder how or why it happened? ``We try not to 
let her think why,'' Sie said, not translating the question. ``If 
you start thinking why, then it's not going to be good.'' Ms. Sang 
spoke up in Chinese. ``Oh,'' Sie said, ``she understands.'' Ms. Sang 
went on to reply: ``Ask the same question of Christopher Reeve.''(She 
has spoken to the actor, who was paralyzed in a fall from a horse.) 
``It was an accident. There's no `why.' Christopher Reeve told me 
that his horse had done the jump over and over again. It never had 
problems with it. Why? It was just an accident. The same with me. 
My movement was easy. I can close my eyes and do it a million times.'' 
Ms. Sang added that she believes ``a lot of this is set up by God.'' 
``Yes, it's very unfortunate I had this accident,'' she said, ``but 
I wouldn't have come to know all these people. And I will give back 
what I can.'' Doctors say it is possible that future medical breakthroughs 
could restore Ms. Sang's ability to walk. ``But I can't tell if it's 
going to be 5 years, 10 years or decades away,'' said Dr. Kristjan 
T. Ragnarsson, Mount Sinai's chief of rehabilitation, who is treating 
Ms. Sang. For now, friends have set up a trust fund for Ms. Sang's 
living costs and education in the United States; $80,000 has been 
raised, mostly in small donations from Chinese-Americans. (Her medical 
care and rehabilitation are so far covered by Goodwill Games' insurance, 
and she still receives her gymnast's salary from China, which comes 
to $78 a month.) Dr. Wise Young of Rutgers University, one of the 
leading researchers on spinal injuries in the United States, is a 
trustee of the fund. He signed on after meeting Ms. Sang. ``She's 
a very, very bright girl,'' he said. Ms. Sang said she misses China, 
and ``my father, my coaches, my teammates and my gym work.''
