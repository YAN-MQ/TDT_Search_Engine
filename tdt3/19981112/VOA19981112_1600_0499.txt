A Belgrade court has fined Serbia's largest pro government daily and 
its chief editor about $15,000 for spreading lies about an opposition 
activist. Publishers of the newspaper, "Polijica," were ordered to 
pay $10,000 and its editor half that amount for libeling opposition 
leader Zorhan Gingitch. The newspaper last week reported that Mr. 
Gingitch had advised an official of his democratic party to withdraw 
funds from a bank because NATO would definitely bomb Yugoslavia. The 
Belgrade court upheld Mr. Gingitch's denial of the report and imposed 
the fine. It is the first time Serbia's new restrictive media law 
is being applied against a pro government publication.
