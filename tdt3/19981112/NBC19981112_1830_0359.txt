At the Pentagon and in countless other American military facilities, 
the preparations for major military action are at full throttle tonight. 
NBC's Jim Miklaszewski is keeping track of them for us. jim? Tom, 
the military buildup continues in the Persian gulf. But there are 
new concerns tonight that despite that massive array of firepower, 
airstrikes alone may not do the job. Sailors at the nor fok naval 
base told William Cohen today they're tired of being pushed around 
by Saddam Hussein. Cohen assured the troops that this time, the U.S. 
won't back down. We're not playing games any longer with Saddam Hussein. 
We're saying comply. More warplanes and additional troops headed for 
the Persian gulf today, in preparation for possible airstrikes. But 
NBC news has learned that a CIA assessment given to President Clinton 
this week makes it clear just how difficult it will be to take out 
Saddam's chemical and biological weapons. The report identifies four 
potential targets believed to produce raw materials for chemical weapons. 
The problem is the facilities also produce medical vaccines. Sources 
tell NBC news, because the plants produce medicine, the president 
wants to take them off the target list. The president also wants to 
avoid other targets that might hurt the Iraqi people, like power plants, 
because it would hand the Iraqis a powerful propaganda issue that 
could turn international opinion in Saddam's favor. Instead, airstrikes 
would target airstrips, planes and missiles, anything that could be 
used to launch Saddam's deadly weapons. But as the list of potential 
targets shrinks, some officials here at the pentagon worry that once 
again, airstrikes won't go far enough. tom? Thanks very much. Jim 
Miklaszewski tonight still on duty at the Pentagon.
