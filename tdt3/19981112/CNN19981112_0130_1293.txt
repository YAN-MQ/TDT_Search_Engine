As was the case with Roger Clemens before him, Mo Vaughn's career 
with the red sox is over, coming to an end when the former American 
league MVP could not reach agreement on a long-term contract to remain 
in Boston. I don't feel any negativety. I just want out here and tried 
to do the best that I could and made a run at the situation to continue 
but it didn't work out. So you just move on and don't ever forget 
the good things, because were good to me here, the fans were good 
to me. And tile take that with me. The Yankees were able to hold onto 
David cone, signing the 20 game-winner to a one-year, $8 million deal. 
The Mets reacquired Bobby bonilla by sending reliever Mel Rojas to 
the dodgers. After leading the astros to a team record 102 wins Larry 
dierker won national league manager of the year honors.
