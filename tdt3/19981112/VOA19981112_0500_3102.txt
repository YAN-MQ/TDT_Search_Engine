Microsoft Chairman Bill Gates has criticized the U.S. government's 
anti-trust case against the software giant saying it's driven by his 
competitors. He accused government lawyers of having private meetings 
over dinner with his competitors during the trial now taking place 
in Washington, and he says they're deliberately trying to distort 
his comments. They intentionally with added the video. And the fact 
that there's a meeting on here at Microsoft that says "Let's go up 
and beat this guy," there's nothing wrong with that. That is capitalism 
at work for consumers. The rules aren't designed to protect our competitors 
or make sure their feelings don't get hurt if someone says, "Yes, 
we're competing." They're designed for great products. And the P.C. 
industry deserves an A-plus in that respect. Well, we apologize for 
Mr. Gates comments. His tape recording apparently hit a blue screen 
fatal exception with the a operation to boot when the computer crashed. 
That's a look at business. I'm Paul Westpheling in Washington.
