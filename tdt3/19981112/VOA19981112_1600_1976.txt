Indonesian riot troops have fired on thousands of protesters in Jakarta 
during the biggest anti-government demonstration since May. At least 
100 people have been hurt, many of them seriously. Troops fired rubber 
bullets, tear gas, and water cannon at the protesters who fought back 
by throwing bottles and chunks of concrete. Security forces were stationed 
all around the national parliament building where a special assembly 
was meeting to consider a political reform.
