When Rene Foss' mother was a stewardess in the 1950s, she wore white 
gloves and served lobster thermidor to passengers. Today, Ms. Foss, 
a flight attendant herself, says, ``Some of us are wearing rubber 
gloves, and we have to learn how to put handcuffs on people.'' Ms. 
Foss, who describes herself as ``36 going on about 25,'' wanted to 
be a Broadway star; her family wanted her to have a steady job. ``I 
can't say I always wanted to be a flight attendant,'' she said. ``I 
just wanted to get my dad off my back.'' And so she did, and pursued 
a career in entertainment at the same time. With the free time her 
job offers, Ms. Foss was able to study singing and acting, and to 
write a cabaret show about flight attendants called ``Around the World 
in a Bad Mood.'' The show is occasionally performed at Rose's Turn 
in Greenwich Village. (The next performance is Dec. 9.) But there 
is more to the job than just time off and good material, she said, 
as she discovered during the year she managed a theater producer's 
office. ``Six months into the job, I thought, `My God, I can't stand 
this working every day, in the same place _ I've got to get back to 
flying,''' she recalled. ``I think it gets in your blood.'' Some of 
it also sticks in your craw. As depicted in her show, which she performs 
with another flight attendant and some professional actors, being 
a flight attendant is rather like being a waitress on a Greyhound 
bus _ with no tips. ``I'm hoping to find a job where I can deal with 
emotionally and physically abusive people who will blame me for everything 
that goes wrong in their lives, whether it's my fault or not,'' Ms. 
Foss' character says while applying for a job as a flight attendant. 
``I also like to hang around crowded airports for hours and hours 
and hours with nothing to do. But most importantly, I have a particular 
fondness for picking up garbage. I love it.'' The skit's biggest laugh 
was a recitation of the questions flight attendants are asked, all 
of which, Ms. Foss said, were drawn from experience. ``Will our luggage 
make it? Where are the bathrooms? Will I make my connection? ``Do 
you have raspberry-kiwi iced tea? Is that your natural color hair? 
Has anyone ever told you that you resemble Monica Lewinsky? What time 
is it? Is this your regular route? Can I borrow your pen? Can you 
find out the score of the game? What river is that? Where are we? 
``Can I have another bag of peanuts? Doesn't the air-conditioning 
work on this plane? Where do you live? Are you married? Are you divorced? 
Have your ever been married? Do you have a boyfriend? Have you ever 
had a boyfriend? How old are you? Can I have another beer?'' And on 
and on. The show provides passengers _ these days, almost everyone 
_ with some insight and inside information about flight attendants, 
including what they really mean when they say, sweetly, ``I'll be 
right back!''
