NBC news "in depth." Tonight, Iraq in the crosshairs once again. It 
is a familiar scenario. We've been through it before. Since the end 
of the gulf war, America and its allies have attacked Iraq three times. 
January 1993, a suspected nuclear facility is hit. June 1993, Iraqi 
intelligence headquarters hit. And September 1996, southern Iraq attacked. 
And now, the U.S. is on the brink of striking again. What precisely 
are the objectives this time, and what are the chances of success? 
We begin tonight's "in depth" reporting with NBC's Andrea Mitchell. 
If we attack Iraq how will the U.S. define victory over Saddam? That 
is the question being debated both inside and outside the administration. 
What is the endgame? What is the strategy, the vision that this administration 
has towards Iraq? The goal of our policy all along has been to counter 
Iraq's threat to its neighbors, particularly the threat that would 
be posed if Iraq acquired weapons of mass destruction. Goal one is 
limited to degrade, not eliminate, Iraq's chemical, biological and 
nuclear threat to its neighbors. Even supporters of bombing don't 
think it can get the job done. It is unlikely to have an air campaign, 
give absolute confidence of destroying all the means of production 
of weapons of mass destruction, chemical or biological, that Saddam 
Hussein is likely to have. Goal two -- get the U.N. inspectors, UNSCOM, 
back in. Some say it could backfire and any hope for inspections. 
Others say it could work. If we're prepared to bomb and to bomb and 
to bomb until Saddam relents, then I think we have a decent chance 
of getting UNSCOM back in and able to work without condition. Goal 
three -- get rid of Saddam Hussein by weakening his hold on power, 
or even targeting him. Saddam, as he moves around, might guess wrong 
some day and be in the wrong place. And he might get killed in the 
process. But an executive order dating back to 1974 forbids assassinations. 
And Saddam is hard to find. Still, U.S. officials believe intensive, 
sustained bombing against the right targets could weaken Saddam enough 
to make him vulnerable to his enemies inside Iraq. So if and when 
the U.S. attack, the ultimate measure of success, stopping saddam 
from threatening the world and continuing to provoke the United States 
and the west. Andrea Mitchell, NBC news, Washington.
