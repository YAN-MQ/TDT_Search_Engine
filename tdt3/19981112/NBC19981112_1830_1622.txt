As the countdown goes on to a massive American military strike against 
iraq, in another part of the world, other American military veterans 
are deeply involved in another kind of mission altogether. Central 
America, a vast disaster zone as a result of hurricane Mitch, with 
15,000 people still missing in the mud and debris. Tonight NBC's Kerry 
Sanders on the difficult work and the Americans who are involved. 
It is the job nobody wants -- searching for the missing in honduras. 
I'm starting down. Leading the effort, a team of volunteers -- U.S. 
military veterans trained in search and rescue. Riley Wooten, U.S. 
Marine retired. Three tours in Vietnam, the gulf war, and now this. 
You have to go on with a hope that what you're doing is going to give 
the people -- even if you give them a dead loved one, but it closes 
the chapter of the tragedy. Don't see anything in the roots. His wife, 
tana Wooten, U.S. army retired. A veteran of the gulf war. Today, 
the search for a missing mother. Her daughter-in-law from Texas. For 
me, just observing every time they pull out a chunk of mud and you 
start looking at it, and you say, "okay, okay then. Maybe this one, 
maybe this one." Each house that they clear out, "okay, maybe here, 
maybe here." Valerie the sniffer dog leads the team to the back room 
of a House. After 45 minutes of digging, the team still can't find 
the body. They Mark the site. It's very difficult to escape the smell 
of death anywhere around tegucigalpa or comejula right now. Paul Jennings 
found the body of an 8-year-old boy this week. U.S. air force retired, 
he jumped on a plane from Boston when he heard about the disaster. 
So far the team has uncovered eight bodies here in the capital city. 
More than 1,500 people are still missing. Retired members of the U.S. 
military -- no orders this time, just a need to help others. I love 
my country. My blood is red, white and blue. But right now these people 
need me, and this is my home. No one asked them to help. But then, 
no one needed to. As veterans, they say it's their duty. Kerry Sanders, 
NBC news, tegucigalpa, Honduras. And they get a salute from all of 
us on both sides of the border.
