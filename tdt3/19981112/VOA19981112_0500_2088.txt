Also from Indonesia today, 10,000 East Timorese on Thursday commemorated 
the seventh anniversary of what's known as the Santa Cruz massacre 
when Indonesian troops opened fire on a group of East Timorese mourners. 
Jenny Grant reports from Jakara the anniversary celebrations were 
peaceful. A crowd of 10,000 gathered at the Santa Cruz cemetery in 
the East Timorese capital of Dele and threw flowers on the graves 
of those killed in the massacre seven years ago. In a somber remembrance, 
they lit candles and sang songs in support of independent for the 
territory and from Indonesian control. According to official Indonesian 
government accounts of the Santa Cruz massacre, 50 people died when 
Indonesian soldiers opened fire on a crowd of mourners in November 
1991. But church and human rights groups say 200 people died in the 
violence, which has become a symbol of East Timorese resistance against 
Indonesian rule. The head of police information in East Timor, Captain 
Redodo, said Thursday that 250 police and an unspecified number of 
soldiers stood by during the commemoration in case of unrest but there 
was none. A member of parliament and pro independence activist, Maria 
Olendina, told VOA hundreds of youth celebrated mass in the rebel 
forces have waged a guerrilla war against Indonesian occupation. This 
is Jenny Grant reporting for VOA News Now, Jakarta.
