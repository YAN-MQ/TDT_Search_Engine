Floods receded slightly Friday in southwestern Germany, where rivers 
and streams swollen by days of heavy rain have inundated low-lying 
towns such as this luxurious sparesort. The Oos River, which runs 
through the center of Baden-Baden, had dropped from three meters (10 
feet) to 1.67 meters (5.5 feet), although a state of emergency remained 
in effect as weather forecasts predicted more rain. Several roads 
in the area remained impassable. Europe's busiest waterway, the Rhine, 
had yet to flood, but officials in the riverside city of Cologne said 
the Rhine could overrun its banks by Saturday, covering low-lying 
streets near the river's edge but far from the city's old center and 
14th-century cathedral. Some ferries across the Rhine have suspended 
business, and flood officials warned barges to travel slowly because 
of the high, choppy waters. German soldiers were sandbagging flood-threatened 
towns in the southern state of Bavaria and in the northern town of 
Delmenhorst, near Bremen, which declared a state of emergency at 4 
a.m. Flooding was most severe in the center of the town, named from 
the nearby Delme River. About 300 soldiers arrived during the night 
to help pump out people's basements. ``The moment we pump out the 
cellars, the water flows right back in,'' Delmenhorst town spokesman 
Rolf Heitmann said. Harsh storms that started late Tuesday have killed 
at least three people _ one in Germany, one in the Czech Republic, 
and one in Switzerland. All were involved in vehicle accidents with 
trees uprooted by wind. Power cuts, traffic snarls, and highway closings 
have been reported in Austria and the Netherlands.
