A British judge Friday granted bail for former Chilean dictator Gen. 
Augusto Pinochet, detained in London on a Spanish warrant seeking 
his extradition on charges of murder, torture and kidnapping during 
his 17 years in power. Judge Stephen Richards decreed, however, that 
Pinochet must remain at north London's Grovelands Priory Hospital, 
where he is recuperating from back surgery, and remain under police 
guard at all times. James Lewis, the attorney representing British 
and Spanish authorities, said he would not object with those conditions 
imposed. But he added, ``We make it plain that if there were to be 
any variation, the respondents would have a different perspective 
on the matter.'' On Wednesday, England's High Court threw out two 
Spanish warrants seeking Pinochet's extradition, ruling he was immune 
from prosecution as a former head of state. But the court added he 
could not leave Britain until prosecutors appealed the ruling. A five-judge 
panel at the House of Lords will hear the appeal, probably next week, 
after the Monday filing deadline. In granting bail, the judge said: 
``The concern must be to hold the position pending an appeal to the 
House of Lords, but on terms that impose on the applicant only such 
restrictions as are properly necessary.'' Pinochet was not in court 
for the hearing. A Spanish judge is expected to push ahead for his 
extradition after Spain's National Court ruled Friday that Spain had 
jurisdiction over crimes committed during the military dictatorships 
in Chile and Argentina. The ruling came after Spain's highest criminal 
court held that the country has jurisdiction to prosecute crimes committed 
during military dictatorships in Chile and Argentina _ a decision 
that would have supported efforts to prosecute Pinochet. Though the 
Spanish ruling did not specifically mention Pinochet, the court's 
decision in effect gave a green light to Judge Baltasar Garzon to 
continue with his investigation into genocide, terrorism and torture 
allegedly committed by Pinochet during his military dictatorship between 
1973-90. Garzon had issued an international arrest order that led 
to the detention of Pinochet in London on Oct. 16 for crimes allegedly 
committed in Chile and Argentina. Garzon's case puts forward that 
Pinochet, together with Argentine generals, made a systematic, organized 
attempt to wipe out political opponents because of their ideological 
beliefs and that it amounts to genocide, according to lawyers working 
with Garzon. France, meanwhile, became the latest European country 
to open an investigation into alleged atrocities by Pinochet, judicial 
officials said. Prosecutors were investigating charges by families 
of missing Chileans that Pinochet was linked to their loved ones' 
``sequestration followed by torture,'' the officials said. They spoke 
on customary condition of anonymity.
