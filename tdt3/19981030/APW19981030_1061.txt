A prominent opposition leader was arrested in Kazakstan on Friday, 
a news agency said. Pyotr Svoik, leader of the Azamat opposition movement, 
was arrested in Almaty, the former capital, and charged with slander, 
inciting national conflict and insulting an official, Interfax reported. 
The information came from Semyon Grobovsky, leader of the Kazak Workers 
Movement, who said he didn't know anything else about the incident. 
It was not clear whom Svoik is alleged to have slandered. Svoik has 
been an outspoken critic of President Nursultan Nazarbayev. He complained 
that he was attacked and beaten last year by men he believed were 
government security agents.
