Investigators in Sweden say an electrical spark probably started the 
dance hall fire that killed 60 people and left 170 others injured. 
The fire broke out last night while the hall was jammed with 400 people 
who were at a halloween party. Most were between the ages of 13 and 
18. One official said the aftermath of the fire looked like a gas 
chamber. Officials say the fire apparently began with an explosion 
and spread very rapidly. Most of the victims died from smoke inhalation.
