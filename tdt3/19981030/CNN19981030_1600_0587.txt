Danny canal went home from the hospital today after making medical 
history in Miami. The 13-year-old underwent three multiple organ transplants 
involving his liver, pancreas and stomach. Elizabeth Cohen reports 
the boy's experience highlights the debate within the medical community 
about how organs for transplant are allocated. More than 4,000 people 
will die each year waiting for an organ transplant. There simply aren't 
enough organs to go around. So how is it decided who gets them? You 
might think it's based on which patients are the sickest. But it's 
not. It's based largely on geography. Here's an example -- let's say 
a patient in New York desperately needs a Heart transplant. He's on 
the verge of death. And let's say another patient, one in neighboring 
Connecticut, also needs a Heart transplant, but is healthy enough 
to wait a few months. And then a heart becomes available in Connecticut. 
Under the current organ transplant system, the patient from Connecticut 
gets the heart, even though he doesn't need it as badly. Some bioethicists 
think this method of giving out organs locally is unfair. What's in 
patients' best interests much of the time is to have a national distribution 
system. Health and human services secretary Donna Shalala agrees. 
She asked Congress for a national system, but Congress put her plan 
on hold while it asked the institute of medicine to study the issue. 
In the meantime, the current system stays in place. One major point 
of contention -- some critics say rich people have a clear advantage. 
They can afford to travel around to doctors in various cities, getting 
on several different waiting lists at a time. When we have situations 
where people can double dip or triple dip or quadruple list themselves, 
it just tells you geography isn't fair. But the united network for 
organ sharing, which is responsible for organ transplant allocations, 
opposes a nationalm. If I have an organ here in Los Angeles and I 
ship it to New York, the likelihood of that organ getting in within 
12 hours is pretty small. The institute of medicine report is due 
out in may. But until then, patients like Danny canal will continue 
to spur on debate. Elizabeth Cohen, CNN, Atlanta.
