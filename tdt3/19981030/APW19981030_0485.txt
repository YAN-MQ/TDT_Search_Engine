Slovakia's new coalition government was formed Friday by Prime Minister 
Mikulas Dzurinda, just over a month after parliamentary elections. 
In a quick succession of events, Jozef Migas, the newly appointed 
parliament chairman, first appointed Dzurinda prime minister, who 
then submitted his list of ministers. They were then sworn in by Migas, 
who was elected on Thursday and is acting as head of state in the 
absence of a president. The Sept.25-26 ballot led to the resignation 
of authoritarian Prime Minister Vladimir Meciar, whose Movement for 
a Democratic Slovakia still emerged the strongest party but did not 
win enough seats for a majority in parliament. The coalition holds 
93 of the 150 seats in parliament. Meciar's party hold 43 seats. Meciar 
was replaced by Dzurinda, 43, a former transportation engineer who 
is now chairman of the largest ruling party, the Slovak Democratic 
Coalition. and was briefly Minister of Transportation in 1994. ``We 
need to bring stability for our citizens, fight organized crime, improve 
the economy and catch up with the Czech Republic, Poland and Hungary 
on their way to the European Union,'' Dzurinda said only minutes after 
the government was established. Dzurinda's Cabinet would like to catch 
up fast with the other countries. Dzurinda said he hoped his country 
would be acccepted as a candidate by the EU Vienna summit in December. 
However, it was unlikely the EU could chance its stance so fast. ``We 
would like it to be at this time, but we do not want to make it a 
race,'' said Dzurinda. He is preparing for his first foreign visit 
to Brussels, and will later go to Bonn and Vienna. The government 
was formed from by four parties - Dzurinda's party, the Democratic 
Left of former communists, the Hungarian Coalition Party and the Party 
of Civic Understanding. The first session of the new government was 
scheduled for Saturday. Apart from being excluded from the first group 
of countries to join the EU and NATO, Slovakia is also experiencing 
economic problems and the health and education sectors are badly underfunded. 
Eduard Kukan, who served briefly as foreign minister in 1994 and also 
served as ambassador to the United States, became the new foreign 
minister. Ladislav Pittner, another prominent member of Dzurinda's 
Slovak Democratic Coalition, was appointed interior minister. The 
country's finances will be in the hands of Brigita Schmognerova, 50, 
an economist of the Party of the Democratic Left. ``We have to find 
out the real state of the Slovak economy. We will have to start with 
a provisional budget for 1999, but we should be able to prepare the 
budget by February 1999, which should be valid from April,'' said 
Schmognerova. The four coalition partners decided they would support 
the candidacy of Rudolf Schuster, the head of the Party of Civic Understanding, 
for the post of Slovakia's president. The country has been without 
a president since last March when the term of Michal Kovac expired. 
``If there will be direct presidential elections, Slovakia should 
have its president by February or March of next year,'' said Schuster 
on Friday. ``It is very good that all the (coalition) parties have 
agreed on one candidate. It is much better than having several candidates,'' 
he said. Pittner, the new interior minister in charge of police, served 
notice that the fight against organized crime will one of his priorities. 
``The police are often involved in organized crime,'' he asserted. 
`` There is corruption at every level of the police corps, and that 
needs to be changed.''
