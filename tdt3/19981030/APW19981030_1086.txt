Seeking to promote stability in Europe's poorest and most unstable 
country, officials from 25 countries met here Friday to endorse efforts 
by the new prime minister to restore order and revive the economy. 
Speakers, including Austrian Foreign Minister Wolfgang Schuessel and 
Polish Foreign Minister Bronislaw Geremek, expressed hope that Prime 
Minister Pandeli Majko would succeed where his predecessors had failed. 
``Since the new administration has taken office, the internal situation 
in Albania has dramatically improved,'' Schuessel told the one-day 
conference. ``Our presence here today gives ample proof of the fact 
that the country is on its way toward enhanced stability.'' In a document 
issued at the close of the conference, the speakers pledged continued 
support of Albania and its new government and underlined the need 
to continue to monitor the progress. They also asked the government 
to implement an anti-corruption plan to fight smuggling and other 
illegal activities, promote foreign investments, fight illegal emigration, 
and reform the judiciary system. Earlier in the day, Geremek, chairman 
of the Organization for Security and Cooperation in Europe, also urged 
the opposition Democratic Party of ex-President Sali Berisha to end 
its boycott of parliament and work with Majko to restore stability. 
``I cannot support the boycott of the democratically elected parliament,'' 
Geremek said. ``One has to respect the rules of democracy, the rule 
of law.'' In September, the assassination of an opposition figure, 
Azem Hajdari, led to riots in the capital by Berisha's followers. 
After the riots ceased, Prime Minister Fatos Nano resigned, and Majko 
took office last month. But Berisha has continued boycotting parliament.
