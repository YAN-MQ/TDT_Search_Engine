Good evening. We begin again tonight 340 miles above the earth, where 
the oldest man to travel in space is cruising at a speed of 17,500 
miles an hour around the globe and around and around. John Glenn's 
first full day in space, a busy day full of medical experiments and 
the launching of a satellite from "discovery's" cargo bay. It was 
mostly work, but Glenn and the crew also took some time for a little 
high-speed site-seeing and reminiscing. At mission control in Houston, 
here's ABC's Ned Potter. And floating into view now -- The world got 
its first look at John Glenn in flight today. He's there on the left 
with Rookie astronaut Pedro duque. He finished his first night of 
sleep experiments, ran a unit to make new cancer drugs and gave samples 
to measure his blood chemistry. This afternoon Glenn said he and everyone 
else on board were feeling fine. Just on the personal side of it, 
being able to float around like this in zero G, I just wish everyone 
could experience this. From what understand he's really enjoying being 
back in space and getting to work. For Glenn and his crewmates, the 
first full day of flight was a Mix of projects, big and small. They 
tested their robot arm, and sent a little communications satellite, 
popping out of the cargo bay. There's main engine start and liftoff. 
If you had been on board "discovery" yesterday, the launch would have 
looked like thi Glenn is in the middle of this picture. A shuttle 
launch can be bone-rattling, but it was far gentler than Glenn's atlas 
rocket. It was quite different than the ride I got before, of course 
back a long, long time ago. Because of "discovery's" famous passenger, 
the mission is a mix of science and symbolism. 36 years ago the people 
of perth, Australia, turned on all their lights overnight to greet 
Glenn passing overhead. Thank everybody for turning them on. For old 
time's sake, they did it again. I think perth's grown a little bit 
since I saw it from this angle last time. Glenn asked controllers 
to pass along his thanks and then the crew got back to work. Ned Potter,
