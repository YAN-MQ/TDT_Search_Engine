The U.S. and Russia are negotiating over a deal to provide food to 
the russians this winter. Sources in Moscow say the U.S. would loan 
the Russians $1 billion so they can buy erican grain. It would help 
the Russians, and help American farmers, who have an overabundance 
of grain this year. The harvest has been truly bountiful -- so good, 
farmers have too much to store and too few customers who can buy. 
ABC's Jim Williams reports from the heartland tonight. They have changed 
the landscape of the great plains -- mountains of grain in Kansas. 
It could be as late as March before we get it picked up. In Nebraska, 
it is feed corn -- so much corn, they are literally running out of 
places to put it. The facility right there is full, so this is where 
we have to go to take the harvest. Farmers are working day and night 
to take in the second-largest corn harvest in U.S. history. It's a 
phenomenal crop, a beautiful crop, one of the best we've ever seen. 
Despite this production, farmers here are suffering. The price of 
the corn they are selling is so low, they will not make a Profit. 
That's because there is a worldwide surplus of corn, and Asia, which 
had been buying 40% of the corn produced here, cannot afford to buy 
it now. It is the same with wheat and other crops. So midwest farmers 
are storing it wherever they can, holding out for higher prices. It 
may be yellow, but it's still money. It's still cash. It's a risk. 
Harsh weather could rot the corn. But farmers are hoping the Asian 
crisis will lift and hoping that the U.S. aid plan for Russia will 
soon provide Moscow with billions of dollars to buy some of these 
stockpiles. But some are not counting on that. I just feel bitter 
that what it has to come to that after producing a good crop that 
you know you're still going to have to go out and get a job besides 
farming. Farmers here say they can survive one bad year. The fear 
is their troubles could last much longer. Jim Williams, ABC News, 
brainard, Nebraska.
