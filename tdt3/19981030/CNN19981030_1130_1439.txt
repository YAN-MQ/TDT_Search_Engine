Bodybuilders need not apply for this contest. Some of New Zealand's 
least-macho men competed yesterday for the title of "Mister puniverse." 
A cheering crowd of women was on hand as the contestants strutted 
their stuff. The title went to a man nicknamed "batty Badger." No, 
I don't find it hard getting a date, really. There are lots of women 
who love this puny little body. One of the judges disagreed. She said 
she prefers her men to be a bit bigger.
