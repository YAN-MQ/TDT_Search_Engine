High airfares for the business traveler may give one airline the edge 
at New York's La guardia airport. Lori Waffenschmidt explains in this 
edition of working ahead. Low-fare carrier proair has been given the 
go-ahead to fly into New York's La guardia airport. The department 
of transportation has awarded the airline two slots, which will allow 
one daily round trip from Detroit city airport. Proair will start 
service to La guardia within the next six months. Though it may come 
as no surprise, American express is reporting that business airfares 
are at their highest levels ever. The latest numbers for the month 
of August show a 9% increase in the cost of an economy-class ticket 
compared to the same time last year. For the foreseeable future, the 
baby-boom generation will continue to be the engine that drives the 
travel industry. According to aaa, more than 40% of all leisure trips 
are taken by baby boomers -- those ages 34 to 54. Benefiting the most 
will be the cruise industry. Aaa predicts a 27% increase in the number 
of passengers heading out to sea next year. Lori Waffenschmidt, CNN,
