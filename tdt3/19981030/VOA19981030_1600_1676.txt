A high school marching band in St. Louis, Missouri has been forbidden 
to play the song, "White Rabbit." The song was a hit back in the 1960s. 
I remember it well, a hit when it was recorded by the group Jefferson 
Airplane. Most fans of the rock group believe the song refers to drugs. 
And it's for that reason that a school system official ordered the 
marching band at Fort Zumal North High School to remove "White Rabbit" 
from its halftime show at a football game. The song was to be played 
only as an instrumental as part of a salute to the music of the late 
1960s. The school official says "White Rabbit" is, in his words, almost 
an anthem for the drug culture. Students at the high school appealed 
to a federal judge to override the ban but was turned down. The American 
Civil Liberties Union is requesting another court hearing on the issue, 
but that hearing will not be held until after the marching band makes 
its final appearance of the season. The ACLU plans to pursue the matter 
anyway to set a precedent for other bands.
