Pete Sampras is getting all the help he can get in his battle to set 
a tennis landmark, even from his rivals. Sampras was leading 4-1 and 
preparing to serve when Jan-Michael Gambill, a 21-year-old rapidly 
improving fellow American who is No. 50 in the world, retired with 
a foot injury Friday, giving Sampras a smooth passage into the semifinals 
of the star-studded Eurocard Open. Gambill's withdrawal came just 
minutes after Marcelo Rios, Sampras' closest challenger at No. 2, 
retired before his quarterfinal against Yevgeny Kafelnikov because 
of a thigh injury. In the semifinals, Kafelnikov will play 12th-seeded 
Jonas Bjorkman, who ousted No. 13 Greg Rusedski 6-3, 6-2. ``It's a 
fluke, but certainly it helps, I must admit,'' said Sampras, who is 
seeking to become the first player to finish as No. 1 for six years 
in a row. With Rios forced to drop out of his second tournament in 
as many weeks and No. 3 Patrick Rafter losing in the third round Thursday, 
Sampras' prospects to protect the top ranking have been bolstered. 
``Certainly it helps. But I know that I can't rely on Marcelo or Pat 
losing,'' Sampras said. ``I have to concentrate on what I am trying 
to do and win my matches.'' By reaching the quarterfinals of this 
dlrs 2.45 million tournament, Sampras had made sure of extending his 
reign at least through next week's Paris indoor tournament, which 
he won last year. Last week in Lyon, France, Sampras had to withdraw 
before the quarterfinals because of a back strain. Sampras says he 
is fine now. Sampras has complained this week about the lack of attention 
his achievements are getting back home. ``It is not easy to do year 
in, year out, win Grand Slams and be No. 1. I feel much more respected 
in Europe than I do in the States, from the press and from the people. 
``Americans expect me to win every match I play,'' said Sampras, who 
has won 11 Grand Slam titles, one short of Roy Emerson's record. The 
No. 1 battle is unlikely to be settled before next month's season-ending 
World Championship in Hanover, Germany. In the semifinals, Sampras 
will battle Richard Krajicek, who ended a nine-match, six-year losing 
streak against Goran Ivanisevic. ``I knew it was that many matches, 
but I didn't know it was that long,'' Krajicek said. Krajicek, the 
1996 Wimbledon champion, improved his chances of clinching one of 
the last two spots available in the eight-man field for Hanover. Winner 
here in 1995 and runner-up last last year, the 11th-ranked Dutchman 
slammed 11 aces and had only one double-fault to overcome Ivanisevic 
7-6 (7-3), 7-6 (7-5). Rios, who leads the tour with seven titles this 
year, retired in the semifinal in Lyon with a hamstring injury in 
his left leg. This time, he pulled a muscle in his right thigh while 
warming up by playing soccer with a tennis ball. ``I prefer to rest 
than to get worse,'' said Rios, who had reached the quarterfinals 
when his third-round opponent, Jan Siemerink, retired with the flu 
after losing the first set 6-2 late Thursday. ``I've been pretty unlucky 
these last two weeks. It's too bad because I've been playing some 
good tennis,'' Rios said.
