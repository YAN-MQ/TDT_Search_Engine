A $90 billion safety nets agreed for the IMF. I'm Liz George at the 
business desk in New York. The G-7 group of industrial nations have 
agreed to step up their contributions to the International Monetary 
Fund and provide a $90 billion safety net. The announcement was made 
by the chairman of the G-7 group, Britain's Gordon Brown. These decisions 
set out an agenda to create an international finance system for the 
21st Century that captures the full benefits of global markets and 
capital flows and is designed to minimize the risk of economic and 
social disruption. With our decisions today on a crisis prevention 
facility on the first process of global financial regulation and with 
the new agreed rules on transparency, we are taking the reform process 
forward immediately. Brown also outlined a series of steps to improve 
supervision of global finance, saying the regulators and their methods 
of regulation need to be as sophisticated as the markets they monitor. 
But chief economist with Bank Paribas Brian Fabbrey says he's disappointed 
by the lack of detail and the failure to address the immediate issue 
of funds for Brazil. I think it's reaction more than action. I think 
it wouldn't have come at all had the Congress probably not inspired 
it and required it, indeed to get the funds that we promised the IMF. 
The big action to come and the big announcement to come is still how 
much money are they prepared to put up for Brazil and what extent 
will the private sector be involved in the Brazilian package. That 
really wasn't disclosed. Instead the G-7 ministers agreed to do more 
to limit the swings of boom and bust that diminish wealth and to deliver 
greater transparency in policy making and the disclosure of economic 
statistics. The biggest problem facing the world economy now, they 
say, is slow growth, not inflation. For the World, I'm Liz George 
at the business desk in New York.
