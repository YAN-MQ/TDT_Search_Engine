The United Arab Emirates beat host Bahrain 1-0 in the opening match 
Friday of the six-nation Gulf Cup here. The UAE team, which attacked 
right from the start, scored in the 40th minute of the first half 
with a well-timed header by forward Adil Mohammed. The U.A.E. team 
came close to scoring several goals, but the Bahrainis, with a homeground 
advantage, managed to restrict the attacking opponents to a 1-0 score. 
The ruler of Bahrain, Sheik Isa bin Salman Al Khalifa, the prime minister 
and the crown prince were among more than 30,000 spectators at the 
opening match of the 14th Gulf Cup. Besides Bahrain and the U.A.E., 
the other teams competing in the six-nation competition are Saudi 
Arabia Kuwait, Qatar and Oman. Saudi _ which brings its World Cup 
experience and a recent win in the Arab Cup held in Doha, Qatar _ 
is a favorite to lift the cup. The only apparent threat to Saudi Arabia 
is from Kuwait, which has won the tournament eight times since its 
inception in 1970. The tournament is held every two years and Kuwait 
won in 1996. Saudi Arabia faces Kuwait on Saturday.
