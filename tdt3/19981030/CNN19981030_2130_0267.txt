CNN has learned New York businessman abe hirschfeld will renew his 
offer to settle the Paula Jones' sexual harassment suit. The real 
estate developer withdrew his million-dollar offer earlier this week. 
But a source tells CNN, he will announce that it's being reinstated 
tomorrow after a discussion with the Jones' legal team. President 
Clinton's lawyers say no agreement has been made, and they're treating 
news of the offer with caution.
