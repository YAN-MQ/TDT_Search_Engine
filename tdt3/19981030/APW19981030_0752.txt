Saying the government draw-down in Kosovo is incomplete, the province's 
main ethnic Albanian leader called Friday for establishment of a new 
police force to convince refugees it's safe to return home. Despite 
substantial withdrawals of Yugoslav police and army units from Kosovo, 
only a few of the thousands of ethnic Albanians who fled during a 
government crackdown against separatist rebels have returned home. 
In one exceptional case, most of the 3,000 refugees camped near the 
village of Kisna Reka 30 kilometers (20 miles) southwest of Pristina 
went back to their homes Thursday. ``Even if they try to kill me ... 
I'm not going back to the mountains,'' said Isa Qelaj, 75. ``It is 
too cold.'' But thousands more are still believed camped in the hills 
and forests. ``The families returning face huge destruction and many 
are still too afraid to go back,'' Ibrahim Rugova told reporters Friday. 
``The number of Serb forces is still huge...Our position is for further 
withdrawals and setting up of Kosovo police force until full withdrawal.'' 
Rugova also urged the Americans and Europeans to speed the deployment 
of a 2,000-member mission designed to verify that President Slobodan 
Milosevic is complying with the peace agreement he reached Oct. 12 
with U.S. envoy Richard Holbrooke. Rugova said he was confident that 
the Kosovo Liberation Army, whose attacks on police and troops prompted 
the Feb. 28 crackdown, would cooperate with the verification mission. 
In its Friday editions, the Albanian language newspaper Koha Ditore 
reported that members of the Kosovo Diplomatic Observer Mission met 
Wednesday with KLA commanders to urge them not to impede traffic and 
to abide by a cease-fire. KLA rebels have been seen milling about 
positions and highway checkpoints evacuated by government forces under 
pressure from NATO. According to Koha Ditore, the monitors told the 
rebels that Serb police will be allowed to patrol highways once a 
week under the Oct. 12 agreement. It appeared the monitors wanted 
to reassure the rebels that a limited Serb police presence does not 
necessarily constitute a violation of the agreement nor represent 
a major threat to civilians. Western powers led by the United States 
threatened NATO airstrikes to pressure Milosevic to agree to reduce 
his forces in Kosovo to the levels they were at before he launched 
the crackdown in Kosovo, a province of Serbia, the dominant republic 
in Yugoslavia. Hundreds have been killed in the fighting. The threat 
of airstrikes remains, though NATO this week lifted its deadline for 
Milosevic to fully comply. But Western powers also oppose rebel demands 
for an independent Kosovo, fearing that could trigger unrest elsewhere 
in southern Balkan countries with large ethnic Albanian communities. 
``There could be a kind of a vacuum and in that vacuum, the withdrawl 
of the army could lead to an influx of the KLA,'' Austrian Foreign 
Minister Wolfgang Schuessel said Friday in the Albanian capital Tirana. 
``This is absolutely not what we want. We want to have stable conditions 
and to create an atmosphere for political talks.'' Schuessel, whose 
country currently holds the EU presidency, said the international 
message to Milosevic was clear ``but we need to address our demands 
to the Kosovo Albnaian leaders and especially to the KLA, not to misuse 
this time ... to intervene.'' International envoys, graf 15 pvs
