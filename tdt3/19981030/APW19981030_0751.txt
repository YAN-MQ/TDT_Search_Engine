The yearly tender for sacks in which to pack bulk tea from Kenya's 
buoyant smallholder sector has stirred up a tempest as charges swirl 
of rakeoffs and corruption within the government-run Kenya Tea Development 
Authority. KTDA recently awarded a year's contract for 3 million speciality 
tea sacks to Nairobi-based manufacturer East African Packaging Industries. 
But KTDA spokesman John Karungu said Friday the tender had been cancelled 
after a hue and cry arose about alleged rakeoffs. ``We did so to satisfy 
the public and to show that there is nothing dubious about it,'' Karungu 
said. A report last week in a weekly newspaper about alleged corruption 
at KTDA and a claim Tuesday by a legislator that KTDA managing director 
Eustace Karanja, a wife of Finance Minister Simeon Nyachae and British 
businessman Colin Sanderson stood to make KSH 15 (dlrs 0.25) on each 
sack unleashed the storm. Both Karanja and Nyachae have denied the 
allegations. Sanderson, who has worked for several years as a packaging 
consultant to KTDA, was not available for comment. John Small, managing 
director of EAPI, said he had received a letter Friday from KTDA informing 
him of the cancellation and advising that the closing date for a new 
bid was Nov. 16. ``I've heard today that they were going to cancel 
it even though we've committed ... we've supplied a performance bond, 
and we have fairly hefty commitments,'' Small said. He said the legislator's 
comments and published accounts of the tendering were ``confusing 
the past history with this current tender.'' ``There was an attempt 
this time to make the tendering process much more open and fair, and 
because of this, it has drawn a whole lot of flak,'' Small said. EAPI's 
bid _ the second-lowest of six shortlisted _ was KSH 117.50 (dlrs 
1.96), excluding 16 percent VAT, for a four-ply open-mouth sack that 
would be made partially from paper imported from Sweden and South 
Africa because locally produced paper does not meet stringent KTDA 
specifications. KTDA disqualified the lowest bid from Firn Overseas 
Packaging of the United Kingdom for technical reasons. For the past 
12 years, J and C Packaging of Sri Lanka has been supplying KTDA with 
the speciality paper sacks that hold around 65 kilograms of tea. For 
the latest tender, J and C bid KSH 126 (dlrs 2.01), excluding VAT, 
per sack. But for the past 10 years, the KTDA tea factories have been 
paying KHS 200 (dlrs 3.33) per bag. Kenya is the world's largest exporter 
of black or made tea, and the smallholder sector, through 45 factories 
managed by KTDA, is reponsible for 65 percent of the exports that 
for the just completed 1997-98 season amounted to 151 million kilograms. 
``Kenya is a mega player in the tea-packaging business, and we are 
a straightforward company,'' Small said, adding that EAPI, which is 
25 percent locally owned and 75 percent owned by Canadian Overseas 
Packaging Industries, supplies most of Kenya's major private tea estates 
with the sacks manufactured at its Mombasa factory. He said EAPI, 
the only Kenyan manufacturer among the 25 original bidders, has never 
supplied KTDA with sacks and has been unsuccessfully tendering bids 
to the tea authority since 1992. He said EAPI was interested in a 
long-term relationship during which his company would work to reduce 
the cost of the packaging even further as well as provide work to 
other local manufacturers. With a tender in hand, ``the scope for 
reduction (of costs) is fantastic, and we can pass it on,'' Small 
said.
