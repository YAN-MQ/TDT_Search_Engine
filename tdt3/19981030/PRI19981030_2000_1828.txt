For the World, this is Alan Dow in the BBC news room in London. The 
world's richest nations have unveiled measures to prevent a repeat 
of the economic crises affecting Asia, Russia and Latin America. The 
G-7 leaders avow to tighten up regulation of their own financial markets. 
The International Monetary Fund will be allowed to lend money more 
quickly if the country's in trouble. President Clinton said the proposals 
would make life easier for those most in need. These steps are very, 
very important. If America's devotion to freedom and openness is to 
be met with success, we must put a human face on the global economy 
for the most vulnerable people in the emerging countries when they 
face hard times. President Clinton also said the G-7 measures would 
help boost trade.
