The U.S. economy so far is weathering a global financial storm, but 
there could be trouble ahead. The commerce department reported today 
that the Gross domestic product grew by 3.3% from July to September. 
President Clinton says that is a sign the U.S. economy is still in 
good shape. But for the first time in 40 years American exports fell 
for a Third-consecutive quarter. That's a symptom of the world financial 
turmoil that G-7 nations are discussing. Britain chairs the G-7, and 
today announced measures to ease the strain on world markets. That 
includes endorsing a proposal by President Clinton to let the international 
monetary fund give quick emergency loans to ailing countries. Today, 
we released detailed plans for greater openness and stronger standards 
for finance in the international marketplace. And we have agreed to 
ask our finance ministers to make new and very concrete recommendations 
to help detain the excessive volatility in financial markets that 
can destroy hope and diminish wealth.
