Japan has made little progress on key human rights issues over the 
last five years, the head of the U.N. Human Rights Committee said 
Friday. ``None of the recommendations of the committee, notably those 
on the death penalty, have been followed with action,'' French rights 
expert Christine Chanet told a news conference. The 18-member committee 
reviewing adherence to the International Covenant on Civil and Political 
Rights on Thursday finished considering Japan's latest report. Although 
the covenant doesn't exclude the use of the death penalty, Japan has 
done nothing to cut the number of crimes covered by it, Chanet said. 
Last week, a former member of the doomsday cult blamed for the 1995 
nerve gas attack on the Tokyo subway was sentenced to death for the 
slayings of four people. Chanet said she was disappointed that the 
Japanese delegation defended the country's use of the death penalty 
on the grounds that public opinion supported it. ``I found a little 
frustration on their position,'' she said. ``The really unanimous 
conclusion is that there has been no movement for five years.'' However, 
Chanet said Japan has made positive moves toward gender equality, 
an in promoting the rights of the Ainu people and abolishing the forced 
sterilization of disabled women. The committee, which periodically 
reviews the reports of each of some 140 governments who have ratified 
the accord, will publish its final conclusions next month. Also this 
week, the Human Rights Committee reviewed Libya's latest report. Questioned 
about minority rights and allegations of torture, the Libyan delegation 
gave ``very general and very aggressive'' answers, Chanet said. ``They 
still have the same rigid approach.'' But Libya has made some progress, 
especially in the area of education and work opportunities for women, 
she added.
