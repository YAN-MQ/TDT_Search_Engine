Tonight, a young Chinese gymnast is preparing for her new life out 
side a Hospital, her legs and arms paralyzed. She has learned that 
this can be a small world. Here is NBC's Anne Thompson. Today, Sang 
Lan finally left the hospital. In 13 weeks, so many things have changed 
for the 17-year-old gymnast, but not her smile. When I was first hospitalized, 
I was actually lying down, and I was carried to the hospital. But 
now, actually, I can sit in a wheelchair to talk to people. China's 
vaulting champion at this summer's goodwill games in New York, she 
broke her neck during a routine warm-up. These pictures stunned the 
world. From so gifted, so vital, to so helpless across the country, 
when adrianna duffy saw those pictures. Instantly, she knew, perhaps 
better than anyone, Sang Lan's fear. You are an outsider in your own 
world. Nine years ago, Duffy was competing in a world gymnastics championship, 
her hands slipped as she made her vault. She landed on her neck. Like 
Sang Lan, she was 17. Now an attorney, Duffy this week, wrote the 
Chinese gymnast, hoping to prepare her for what she faces. I think 
the most important thing is to understand that one is not a Lesser 
or inferior person. And that one need not have a life that is worse 
in any important way from the way life would have been had one not 
been injured. Sang has never lost her will. This letter still only 
strengthens. Nr I really should learn from her as an example. Despite 
experimental drugs, Sang Lan's prognosis has not changed. Doctors 
do not believe she will walk again, let alone do gymnastics. But they 
believe she will be self-sufficient. As she left the hospital this 
morning, Sang Lan was quick to show off what she can do. For now, 
she will stay in New York continue her rehabilitation, grateful for 
the support this country has shown her. Thank you, everyone. I love 
you all. Once admired today embraced for her courage and spirit. Anne 
Thompson, NBC news, New York.
