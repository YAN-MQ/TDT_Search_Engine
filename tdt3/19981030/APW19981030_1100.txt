Forest fires in South Florida. Heat waves that have shattered century-old 
records. Even rising sea levels are being cited as proof of global 
warming. In December, the world community decided to try and halt 
the phenomenon with the landmark Kyoto agreement to curb heat-trapping 
greenhouse gases. Less than a year later, 166 nations will convene 
in Argentina's capital Monday to hash out ways to implement the accord. 
``The Kyoto Protocol left open a significant number of questions in 
terms of the operational aspect,'' said Robert Watson, a top climate 
expert who chairs a U.N.-sponsored assembly of scientists on the issue. 
History was made in Kyoto, Japan, last year when governments agreed 
to emission reductions by the United States, Japan, the 15-nation 
European Union and 21 other industrial nations. But many nations have 
grappled with how to attain those goals. Watson told The Associated 
Press that the Buenos Aires meeting _ the biggest since Kyoto _ will 
be another defining moment. ``I think the governments will have to 
demonstrate that they can make some progress,'' he said. ``Otherwise 
people will say this thing is stalled.'' The Kyoto accord called for 
developed countries to roll back output of carbon dioxide and other 
heat-trapping gases that are principally emitted from power plants 
and automobiles to pre-1990 levels by 2012. The treaty would require 
the European Union to reduce greenhouse gas levels about 8 percent 
below 1990 emissions, the United States by 7 percent and Japan by 
6 percent. When the nations meet in Buenos Aires, they will focus 
on several controversial proposals for industrial countries to achieve 
their targeted reductions. Under a trading scheme broadly endorsed 
at Kyoto, countries would be able to meet their greenhouse gas reductions 
in part by trading or purchasing credits from others who have already 
met their goals. The United States supports unrestricted swapping 
of the credits, a measure it sees as cost-saving mechanism. But opponents 
in Europe and the developing world insist that unrestricted trading 
would allow the United States to reach its targets without scaling 
back emissions. ``We will adamantly oppose efforts to set arbitrary 
limits on trading,'' Undersecretary of State Stuart Eizenstat, the 
head of the U.S. delegation, said in Washington. The United States, 
which has yet to ratify the agreement, also wants to see a bigger 
commitment from developing countries to reducing its emissions. Developed 
countries would also have a chance to meet the levels by financing 
climate-friendly projects in developing countries. Christopher Flavin 
of the Washington-based Worldwatch Institute said he's hoping for 
real results. He noted that 14 of the warmest years since 1860 were 
recorded in the past two decades, along with increasingly erratic 
weather. He warned that, barring progress, ``the encounter in Buenos 
Aires could turn out to be little more than an elaborate tango _ a 
few impressive steps that end up going nowhere.''
