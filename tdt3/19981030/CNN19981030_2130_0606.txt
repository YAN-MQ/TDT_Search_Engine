The nation's highest-paid elected official has died. Los Angeles county 
sheriff Sherman block died at U.S.C. University hospital from cerebral 
hemorrhaging last night. He was nearing the end of a reelection campaign. 
Officials say his name will remain on Tuesday's ballot, and an interim 
sheriff will step in if he wins. Block earned more than $234,000 a 
year heading up the nation's largest sheriff's department. That's 
more than the president of the United States makes.
