Cuba's Sports Minister Humberto Rodriguez raised the possibility that 
Cubans might be allowed to play in the Major Leagues in the United 
States. ``We are receptive to any proposal by the Major Leagues as 
long as it respects the principles of Cuban socialist sports,'' the 
Spanish-language news agency quoted Rodriguez. So far, only Cubans 
who have left their country, such as New York Yankees pitcher Orlando 
``Duke'' Hernandez, a standout in this year's World Series, have played 
in the U.S. professional ranks. Rodriguez said Cuba has not received 
any new proposals from the Major Leagues but is willing to listen. 
Cuban President Fidel Castro said in a meeting last week with U.S. 
newspaper editors in Havana that he is not opposed to Cuban teams 
competing in the United States. Castro, a baseball fan, was a pitcher 
for the University of Havana team while he was a law student. A Cuban 
team could not compete in the United States under current laws, which 
prohibit commerce with Cuba. But Major League teams would like to 
recruit top Cuban players. Hernandez won the spotlight with victories 
in the American League Championship Series and in the World Series 
this year. His half-brother, Livan, was named Most Valuable Player 
in the 1997 World Series.
