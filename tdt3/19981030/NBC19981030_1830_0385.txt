At the same time, and this is a cautionary tale for this country as 
well, in Sweden the death toll is now up for the dead in the fire. 
The fire broke out. Most of those that died were caught in the crush 
trying to escape. Several died trying to escape through windows. Many 
immigrants starting new lives after leaving the war zone in Bosnia. 
Authorities expect an electrical spark started this fire.
