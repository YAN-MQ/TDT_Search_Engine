Forget that tiny cell phone tucked in your purse or attached to your 
belt. There's a new way to communicate coming your way. Rick Lockridge 
has the story in today's "tech trends." It is the new space race -- 
a race among rival consortiums, each seeking to encircle the earth 
with satellites to bring phone and pager services to places that have 
never had them before -- to connect the unconnected. We also see the 
opportunity of business people traveling now to more remote areas 
and actually have the opportunity to conduct business there, where 
in the past they could not. The front-runner in this new race is iridium. 
With 72 working satellites already in orbit, this deep-pocketed partnership 
promises to bring truly global phone and paging capabilities to the 
world on November 1st. But those services will not be inexpensive 
-- $3,000 for the phone, up to $3 a minute for satellite talk time. 
We may be slightly more expensive. But we believe that our telecommunication 
services is going to be far superior. Unlike older satellite phones, 
which require a large, unwieldy antenna, the new satellite phones 
are much more portable, they look like early cellular phones, and 
in fact, can make regular cellular calls. But press a button, swing 
out the big antenna on back, and you are ready to make a call through 
a satellite 500 miles overhead. Your call bounces from one iridium 
satellite to another before being beamed to its destination on earth 
-- wherever that destination might be. Iridium is going to cover, 
and actually today does cover, every square inch of the earth -- from 
pole to pole, all the way around the equator everywhere. However, 
dozens of countries have not yet given permission to iridium to transmit 
satellite phone calls within their borders. Some may never do so. 
Still, iridium remains hopeful, and says it believes it can sign up 
all the holdouts, eventually. Rick Lockridge, CNN.
