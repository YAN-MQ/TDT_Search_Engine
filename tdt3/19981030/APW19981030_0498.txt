After 12 years of negotiations, China is still not willing to make 
the market-opening concessions needed to join the World Trade Organization, 
a European delegation said Friday. ``We have made progress, but we 
have not made sufficient progress,'' Sir Leon Brittan, vice president 
of the European Commission, said after two days of meetings in Beijing. 
China argues it has already gone a long way toward meeting membership 
conditions of the rule-setting body for world trade. It has accused 
WTO members of demanding too many concessions. But Brittan said, ``China 
so far has not been prepared to move sufficiently in opening up its 
markets to financial services, to insurance, banking, and securities'' 
and telecommunications. Chinese conditions on foreign investment also 
are ``very restrictive,'' he said at a news conference. Brittan was 
in China with a delegation led by EC President Jacques Santer, who 
met all of China's top three leaders Friday _ President Jiang Zemin, 
Premier Zhu Rongji and legislative head Li Peng. Santer, whose six-day 
visit is the first by an EC president in 12 years, said human rights 
was a ``crucial part'' of EU-China relations and was discussed in 
a ``very open and frank'' manner. He urged China to fully implement 
two U.N. human rights pacts it has signed but not yet ratified and 
to open talks with the Dalai Lama, Tibet's exiled leader. Chinese 
officials, meanwhile, all voiced strong support for the euro, the 
common currency to be adopted by 11 of the 15 EU nations on Jan. 1., 
the EU delegation said. A delegation statement said Chinese officials 
confirmed they would convert ``a significant share'' of the country's 
U.S. dlrs 141 billion in foreign exchange reserves into euros. But 
Santer said they gave no precise information on when or how many euros 
China might buy. Santer noted that Chinese exports to Europe have 
increased by 25 percent this year and he echoed Brittan in backing 
more open markets. The Asian financial crisis and China's problems 
in reforming loss-making state firms have made the government wary 
of lowering import barriers and easing investment restrictions. On 
Thursday, in a meeting with Santer, Chinese Vice Premier Li Lanqing 
urged the EU to be ``more flexible and practical'' in negotiations 
on China's WTO bid. Brittan acknowledged that ``things have got more 
difficult from the Chinese point of view.'' But he also said joining 
the WTO entailed ``an exchange of obligations'' and was ``not membership 
of a club that you give to your friends because you like them.'' ``You 
have access to other people's markets, in return you have to open 
up your own markets to the extent that is appropriate for the economy 
of your size and your state of development _ and you have to be prepared 
to observe the rules,'' he said.
