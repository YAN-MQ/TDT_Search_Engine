Did Ken Starr's office leak secret grand jury material to the news 
media? Was that a violation of federal law? According to the judge 
looking at that question, the evidence is beginning to pile up against 
Starr. NBC's Pete Williams explains that. Federal judge, Norma Holloway 
Johnson, says two dozen news stories since the investigation began 
appear to show that Starr and his deputies actually broke federal 
law, requiring grand jury business to be kept secret. In her order 
disclosed today, the judge says Starr's prosecutors appear to have 
leaked names of grand jury witnesses and information about the strategy 
or direction of their investigation, which she says the law doesn't 
allow. The judge has appointed a special court investigator to look 
into 24 separate newspaper, magazine and network television reports, 
including stories by NBC news, that she says look like they're based 
on leaks from starr's office. One law enforcement source put it this 
way, "we're going to dangle an indictment in front of her and see 
where that gets us." President Clinton's lawyers first complained 
to the judge in february that Starr's office was leaking information 
to reporters. Today, a White House lawyer said we told you so. We 
believe the office of independent counsel has been waging a campaign 
of leaks against the president in an improper effort to influence 
public and congressional opinion. Starr's office says its conduct 
has always met ethical standards. But legal experts say the judge's 
order will mean more to his reputation than his investigation. More 
in the public perception of the integrity of Ken Starr's investigation 
and Ken Starr's conduct, which has been under scrutiny, than it is 
in terms of the actual legal ramifications it would have. And some 
justice department officials think the judge has too broad a view 
of grand jury secrecy, based on 20-year-old cases that are out of 
step with a less restrictive view other courts are taking. If special 
court investigator has wide legal authority, including subpoena power. 
She wants a report in one month, before deciding whether to take any 
action against Starr's office. Pete Williams, NBC news, Washington.
