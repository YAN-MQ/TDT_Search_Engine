Ever wish you could get a piece of a major lawsuit? You may have a 
chance, in the form of a handful of wildly esoteric securities that 
track the outcome of such suits. Moreover, an award is expected next 
spring from the United States Court of Claims in Washington in a suit 
against the federal government by the Golden State Bancorp, a savings 
and loan. And some analysts are rating the suit's related security 
_ generically known as a litigation participation certificate _ as 
a buy. Such certificates, listed by NASDAQ, grew from the savings-and-loan 
crisis of the 1980s, when the Federal Home Loan Bank Board was encouraging 
healthy savings and loans to buy ailing ones. The board created an 
accounting device that allowed the buyer to list the liabilities of 
the acquired institution as ``supervisory goodwill.'' This could be 
written off over 35 to 40 years, and during that time, the write-off 
would be accounted for as capital, against which loans could be made. 
In 1989, however, Congress dissolved the bank board and phased out 
the supervisory goodwill. The savings institutions contended that 
such a move violated their agreements with the government. More than 
120 breach of contract suits have been filed against the government 
by savings institutions seeking restitution and damages. The lawsuits 
could ultimately cost taxpayers $30 billion. Because pending suits 
were likely to complicate mergers in the rapidly consolidating savings-and-loan 
industry, three of the institutions _ Golden State, California Federal 
Bank and Coast Federal, created special securities to spin off the 
potential value of their suits to shareholders. Coast Federal has 
been acquired by Washington Mutual; California Federal is acquiring 
Golden State but is keeping the latter's name. The three institutions 
have all received summary judgments in their favor at trial court 
level. They are are only thrifts to have spun off such securities, 
which trade separately. Charlotte Chamberlain, an analyst at Jeffries 
&AMP; Co., said the Golden State certificates are the blue chips of 
the group because an award is so close, though the government is likely 
to appeal any damages. Golden State, which calls its certificates 
litigation tracking warrants, is the only company that will pay off 
in stock, making the payout nontaxable until the shares are sold. 
The warrants closed at $4.875 on Friday. Ms. Chamberlain says they 
could pay off at $11 each if Golden State gets the full $1.9 billion 
it is seeking. Coast Federal issued what it calls contingent payment 
rights, which pay in cash. They closed on Friday at $9.50. The claims 
court, however, has urged Coast and the government to try to reach 
a settlement. Barring that, hearings on damages are not likely to 
begin until 2000, diminishing the present value of the security, said 
David Dusenbury, an analyst at Credit Suisse First Boston. Coast is 
seeking $1.1 billion. Dusenbury puts the pretax cash value at $24.40 
a certificate if a full award was made today. California Federal's 
case has not advanced as far as the others. It has two certificate 
classes: contingent litigation recovery participation interests and 
secondary contingent litigation recovery participation interests, 
which will pay off differently depending on the amount of any award. 
They trade at $16.125 and $17.75, respectively, and Ms. Chamberlain 
said they would pay off at $48.60 and $70.89, respectively, if the 
institution gets the full $1.64 billion it seeks. The wait has tired 
many investors, and the securities are trading well below their highs. 
Even so, a favorable award for Golden State is likely to run up the 
prices of all of them.
