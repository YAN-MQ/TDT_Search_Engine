Talk is cheap, so general managers continued calling representatives 
of free agents Thursday, a week before they are allowed to begin negotiating 
for players' services. No major player was among the seven who filed 
for free agency Thursday: Joey Cora and Doug Jones of Cleveland, Terry 
Steinbach of Minnesota, Dave Magadan of Oakland, Bobby Witt of St. 
Louis, Ricky Bones of Kansas City and Tim Naehring of Boston. The 
free-agent list grew to 116. Yankees general manager Brian Cashman 
said he was unable to reach the agent for Kevin Brown but talked to 
the agents for Randy Johnson and Devon White. The Yankees will at 
least see what it might cost to sign Johnson or Brown, the top two 
pitchers on the market this off season. White, who graduated from 
Park West High School in Manhattan, holds some conditional interest 
for the Yankees. White, who will be 36 in two months, plays center 
field, and the Yankees may need a center fielder if Bernie Williams 
signs elsewhere. The Yankees will not make definitive free-agency 
plans until they have their organizational meeting in Tampa, Fla., 
next week. Steve Phillips, the Mets' general manager, said he also 
continued talking with agents but declined to identify the players 
he talked about. He said his primary interest was in second and third 
basemen and right and left fielders. ``Most agents are just taking 
temperatures,'' he said. Clubs can negotiate with and sign their own 
free agents, but other clubs cannot initiate contract talks until 
Friday, Nov. 6. Although Cashman has said Williams is the Yankees' 
No. 1 priority, it is not clear if they will make him an offer before 
other clubs can begin making their own offers. The Houston Astros, 
on the other hand, plan to meet with Johnson before next Friday. The 
dominating pitcher so excited the Astros during his two-month stay 
with them this year that Drayton McLane Jr., the team's owner, planned 
to participate in the meeting. Johnson, however, is not expected to 
commit to any team until he sees what kind of market value he has. 
In the same way, the San Diego Padres would like to re-sign Brown, 
but he will see what is available before he makes a commitment.
