And now here's Steve Ember with some news items from the American 
Arts World. What's modern art, San Francisco jazz, and Chronus at 
25. What's modern art? The prestigious Museum of Modern Art in New 
York City recently gave four of its most prized drawings to other 
museums because they were deemed not modern enough. One of the founders 
of the Museum of Modern Art, the late Abbey Rockefeller, wrote in 
her 1947 will that she would give the museum four drawings, two by 
Vincent Van Gogh and two by George Serra, but the gift was subject 
to a catch. After 50 years when Mrs. Rockefeller believed the drawings 
would no longer be seen as new, the museum would have to give them 
to other museums that did not limit their collections to modern works. 
Recently, the Museum of Modern Art, widely known by its acronym, MOMA, 
decided to give the Van Goghs to the Metropolitan Museum of Art in 
New York and the Serras to the Art Institute of Chicago. Officials 
at MOMA describe the departure of the drawings as "painful," and said 
such a stipulation in an art donation was quite unusual. The Metropolitan 
Museum of Art is well known for its Van Gogh collection, and the drawings, 
entitled "Hospital Corridor at San Remee " and "Street at San Marie 
" would be a notable addition to the museum. Similarly, the Art Institute 
of Chicago is renowned for its paintings by George Serra, and the 
two drawings, studies for the artist's masterpiece, "Sunday Afternoon 
on the Island of La Grande Yacht " would add to viewers' enjoyment 
of the completed work, which hangs in the Chicago museum.
