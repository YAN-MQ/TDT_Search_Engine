With a look at your "CNN Headline News" weather, I'm Karen McGinnis. 
Still some of the mildest readings can be found all the way from Texas, 
along the gulf coast into Florida and much of the carolinas. While 
40s and some 30s prevail across the interior west, 50s for the pacific 
northwest. Look for temperatures in the low 70s in southern California. 
For Friday morning, a developing storm system across the southwestern 
United States becomes a little bit better organized. Snow levels not 
all that low. You might even expect some thunderstorms to erupt across 
the central plains as we head into the weekend. High pressure still 
holds on across much of the east. And we'll continue to monitor the 
progress of what happens with Mitch, it has been downgraded. Temperaturewise 
for Anchorage, Alaska, look for 35, and around 81 and breezy in Hilo. 
Our extended forecast is looking for the mountain snowfall and lower 
elevation showers coming up for Saturday in the southwestern United 
States. On Sunday, 30s and 40s into Ontario, it'll come back in the 
Great Lakes. And then by Monday, scattered showers for the northwest.
