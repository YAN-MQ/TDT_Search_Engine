Judge Stephen Richards attached conditions to the bail after British 
authorities decided not to oppose the move. Pinochet must remain at 
north London's Grovelands Priory Hospital, where he is recuperating 
from back surgery, and remain under police guard at all times. On 
Wednesday, England's High Court threw out two Spanish warrants seeking 
Pinochet's extradition, ruling he was immune from prosecution as a 
former head of state. But the court added he could not leave Britain 
until prosecutors appealed the ruling.
