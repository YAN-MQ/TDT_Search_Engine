People who take the drug ecstasy get a short-term lift. But the way 
it affects the brain in the long run could be a real downer. Louise 
Schiavone reports. Ecstasy is popular among students and young adults 
for its ability to make some users more sensually aware, less inhibited 
and less anxious. But scientists at Johns Hopkins University now have 
clinical evidence that while Negative effects are not immediately 
felt, ecstasy users are setting themselves up for brain damage. The 
thousands of kids using the drug are not getting any clear indication 
or warning signal that they're experimenting with a highly toxic drug 
of abuse. An amphetamine derivative, ecstasy is especially popular 
at raves -- Packed all-night music parties. Sold only illegally, it 
can range from $10 to $30 a pill. Each dose lasts about four hours. 
Advanced technology like this was used to scan the brains of 14 men 
and women who, on average, had taken ecstasy 200 times or more. They 
were compared to subjects who had never used it. Scientists at Johns 
Hopkins traced ecstasy's impact to specific nerves in the brain that 
release serotonin. We don't know what serotonin in the brain does. 
However, we do know that it's been implicated in a number of vital 
functions such as memory, cognition, mood regulation. Scientists speculate 
that, long-term, ecstasy use could trigger neuro-psychiatric disorders, 
including anxiety and depression. This study is considered particularly 
important because previous ecstasy research was based on laboratory 
animals. Now scientists have confirmed the link between ecstasy and 
brain damage by using living humans as subjects. Louise Schiavone
