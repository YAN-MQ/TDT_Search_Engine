The state of New Hampshire has been placed on high alert this evening 
as a result of multiple bomb threats near the state capitol. From 
New Hampshire public radio, Ov Harris reports. State and Federal law 
enforcement officials say a man who claimed responsibility for planting 
two pipe bombs in public libraries in the capitol of Concord earlier 
this week has threatened to explode two more devices in the area tomorrow. 
FBI special agent Barry Monn says the attacker is harboring anti-government 
feelings. We have a non-specified threat but it is articulated that 
or it appears to be against the state of New Hampshire. It doesn't 
say to who. It doesn't say why. Public buildings in the Concord area 
have been closed for the weekend and activities in public places have 
been canceled. Officials are asking the public to be vigilant and 
report any suspicious activity. For NPR, I'm Ov Harris in Concord, 
New Hampshire.
