He's got a gun! The ubiquitous second-act firearm. Ever notice how 
frequently one is drawn at the climax of an unconvincing play? Sure, 
brandishing a .38 may coax an audience out of its coma: ``First of 
all, when you've a gun,'' goes the line in the Sondheim musical ``Assassins,'' 
``everybody pays attention.'' And yes, great theater can be artfully 
strafed by gunfire. ``Three Sisters,'' ``Hedda Gabler'' and ``The 
Wild Duck'' all end with offstage pistol reports. But in lesser works, 
the sudden appearance of a weapon often is a sign of dramatic desperation, 
an indication of the surrender of a less than sublime sensibility, 
the kind that resorts to force when imagination falls short. ``Retribution'' 
is a case in point. Mark Shapiro's fitful drama, at the Lamb's Theater, 
features Dennis Christopher as a mysterious Holocaust survivor who 
insinuates himself into the life of another former inmate of the concentration 
camps, a celebrated director rehearsing a Broadway production of a 
Holocaust play. Christopher's character, Carl Walkowitz, with a limp 
and a Middle European accent, gets himself hired as the assistant 
to the director, played by Jack Laufer, and proceeds to cause no end 
of mischief. He seduces the director's movie-star wife, drives the 
director's Lee Strasberg-ish mentor to a heart attack, leaks unfounded 
rumors to the press about backstage anti-Semitism and . . . Uh-oh. 
He's got a gun! Carl, it seems, has been nursing a terrible grudge 
against the director since the war ended (the time is 1965), and he 
has chosen a curiously complicated strategy for his revenge; the nature 
of his grievance is a secret that Carl reveals to the director and 
his wife at gunpoint. The play, based on the novel ``Who Shall Live, 
Who Shall Die'' by Daniel Stern, a University of Houston English professor, 
enmeshes its characters in a thorny moral argument concerning the 
positions of authority that some Jews held over others in the camps. 
And it means to raise questions about the culpability of victims forced 
to make choices that spared them while consigning others to death. 
The questions, while not novel, are certainly compelling, and ``Retribution'' 
is at its most persuasive when it comes at them indirectly, as in 
a scene in which Carl and Laufer's character, Judah Kramer, debate 
the predicament of Avram, the protagonist of the play within a play, 
who becomes a Jewish capo in a camp. Otherwise the production is toothless 
and unwieldy; despite the gravity of the topic, it bogs down in the 
odd details. A scene at a Jewish charity dinner is just plain peculiar; 
it includes a publicity agent breathlessly rushing in to report that 
an evil-minded theater columnist is skulking about and ``threatening 
to disrupt the benefit,'' presumably by menacing people with his press 
pass. The most noteworthy aspect of ``Retribution,'' directed by Michael 
Unger, is the appearance by Christopher, who will be most affectionately 
remembered as the Indiana bicycle racer in the movie ``Breaking Away.'' 
He's one of those actors who is eternally 25 in the memory, and it's 
fun to watch him onstage all these years later. You can sense his 
determination to make something of Carl, but the part, and the performance, 
have little range, going from dark and brooding to dark and sinister. 
The mechanics of the play are of no help; they're creaky and unsuspenseful, 
lending a hollow air to Christopher's creepy, Iago-like machinations. 
Laufer and the rest of the cast offer workmanlike if colorless portrayals. 
Only that infernal gun hits its intended target. PRODUCTION NOTES:
