The Ohio State Buckeyes look to have an easy ride when they take on 
Indiana in what's called the biggest outdoor cocktail party in Florida 
this week in U.S. college football. The Buckeyes are undefeated, while 
the Hoosiers have three wins and four losses. However, Ohio State 
will have to counter the attack of Indiana quarterback, Antoine Randall 
Ell, who has thrown for more than 1200 yards, run for more than 500, 
and scored seven touchdowns so far this season. Meanwhile, in Jacksonville, 
Florida, the fifth ranked Florida Gators host the number 11 Georgia 
Bull Dogs as both teams try to stay close to Tennessee in the southeast 
conference. Gators coach Steve Sperger says his team wants to avoid 
a repeat of last year's 37 to 17 loss. Our team probably played about 
as poorly and we coached maybe as poorly as a lot of - any games, 
but Georgia had a lot to do with that because they just flat outplayed 
us, out-coached us, out-hustled and everything else. In other games 
involving top teams, number two ranked UCLA visits the Stanford Cardinal, 
which has only one win and six losses this year. The Bruins quarterback, 
Kade McNown, says he's not taking the Cardinal lightly. I mean, they've 
got some really good athletes on defense. They're very capable on 
offense. And for whatever reason they haven't done real well this 
year, but I mean, I realize they have some has to be ready for them. 
Number three, Kansas State, is in Lawrence to play the University 
of Kansas. Fourth-ranked Tennessee visits South Carolina. Number six, 
Florida State, takes on North Carolina. And seventh ranked Nebraska 
has a big 12 date with rival, Texas.
