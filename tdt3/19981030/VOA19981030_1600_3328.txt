San Francisco jazz. The San Francisco Jazz Festival opens its 16th 
season tomorrow and will include a special tribute to jazz legends 
Charles Mingus, Art Blakey, and Thelonious Monk. The jazz festival 
goes on for 11 days and takes place in a variety of locations around 
San Francisco, California. The special concert honoring Charles Mingus 
will feature the Mingus Big Band, which continues to keep the late 
composer bassist music alive. The San Francisco Jazz Festival will 
also celebrate the connections between jazz and Jewish Klasmer music 
and the Latinization of California culture. Chronus at 25. The acclaimed 
classical music ensemble, the Chronus Quartet, is celebrating its 
25th anniversary this year with a new recording and performances in 
New York City. The Chronus quartet gained fame in the 1970s with its 
casual hit image on-stage, its varied repertoire, and unique musical 
arrangements. Made up of two violinists, a violist, and a cellist, 
the ensemble plays modern American works such as Steve Ryke's "Different 
Trains" and George Crom's "Black Angels," along with works by rock 
music legend Jimmy Hendrix. A broad sampling of the Chronus Quartet's 
music is contained in a new ten CD set released by Nonsuch, and the 
quarter is performing several concerts as part of the next Wave Festival 
at the Brooklyn Academy of Music in New York City.
