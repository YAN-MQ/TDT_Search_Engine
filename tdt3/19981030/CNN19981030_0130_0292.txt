Mitch is just a shadow of Tuesday's category 5 hurricane, but it is 
still stirring up trouble. Thursday it was downgraded to a tropical 
storm. At last report it was located near limon, Honduras, with winds 
of about 50 miles an hour. The national hurricane center says the 
storm will probably weaken, but could regain strength if it returns 
to open waters. Mitch is still unleashing heavy rains, causing floodwaters 
in Mexico and honduras. At least 36 people have been killed. 15,000 
homes were destroyed, and more than 150,000 people have been evacuated.
