In golf, vijay Singh owns the lead as the second round of the season-ending 
pGA tour championship tees off in Atlanta. Singh fired a 7 under par 
63 yesterday to tie the tournament record. Billy Mayfair begins the 
day three shots back. I always thought that somebody one day was going 
to get hot. Each day someone's going to get hot out here. If someone 
gets hot all four days, they're probably going to run away with it.
