Well, the Packers have given "chewy" something to munch on. Today, 
tight end Mark chmura signed a five-year extension reportedly worth 
between $13 million and $15 million. That's quite the opposite for 
former all-pro Lawrence Taylor. Just one day after being nominated 
for the pro football hall of fame and four days after entering a drug 
rehabilitation clinic, L.T. has filed for bankruptcy. His attorney 
says the move was made to try to prevent foreclosure on his New Jersey 
home. Taylor apparently is a year behind on his house payments.
