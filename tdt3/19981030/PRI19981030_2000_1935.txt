Two of the world's most endangered mammals are being caught in front 
line fighting in the democratic republic of Congo. The Worldwide Fund 
for Nature says the civil war there is having devastating consequences 
on the mountain gorilla and the northern white rhino. The BBC's Alex 
Kirby reports. Concern is focused chiefly on two national parks, Ferunga 
and Geramba. Ferunga is home to half of the world's entire population 
of just over 600 mountain gorillas, two of which were killed last 
month. Geramba contains the last population of the northern white 
rhinoceros known to exist in the wild. A survey earlier this year 
found clear evidence of only 23 animals. Contact with staff in Geramba 
has been lost and the Worldwide Fund for Nature says there is no way 
of knowing what has happened to them or to the animals in their charge.
