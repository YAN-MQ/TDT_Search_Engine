A former defense minister in communist East Germany was released early 
from prison Friday after serving 4 1/2 years of a 7 1/2-year sentence 
for shooting deaths at the Berlin Wall. Heinz Kessler, 78, was the 
last high-ranking former East German leader still in prison. His lawyer 
Peter Mildebrath said a Berlin court decided to release Kessler because 
of his good conduct and deteriorating health. Kessler was convicted 
in September 1993 on seven counts of incitement to manslaughter in 
shooting deaths at the Berlin Wall and along East Germany's heavily 
fortified border with West Germany. More than 550 East Germans died 
trying to flee to the West between August 1961, when construction 
on the Wall began, and November 1989, when the border was opened. 
Among the politicians tried with Kessler was former East German leader 
Erich Honecker. He was excused from trial because of liver cancer 
and was exiled to Chile, where he died in 1994.
