NEW YORK _ ``Disposition,'' a quirky ballet that John Selya has set 
to witty music by Dmitri Shostakovich, is the fifth work that Selya 
has choreographed for American Ballet Theater. Led with just the right 
zaniness by Paloma Herrera and Giuseppe Picone at its premiere on 
Wednesday night at City Center, ``Disposition'' is one of Selya's 
useful pieces for the company. The whole thing does not quite add 
up and suggests a subplot in search of a plot. But the choreography, 
more difficult in its classical technique than first apparent, shows 
off some spiffy dancing. It also opens up new aspects of the dancers' 
stage personalities. A corps member since 1988 with a high dose of 
bravura in his own performing, Selya has the advantage of working 
from the inside. He knows his dancers. Thanks to him, Ms. Herrera 
now lightens up in a role that she performs with unaffected charm. 
Picone, like a fellow Italian, the late Marcello Mastroianni, proves 
that a heart throb image does not preclude a comic talent. Nonetheless, 
Selya has yet to choreograph a truly meaningful ballet, and ``Disposition'' 
is not it. The audience on Wednesday was understandably enthusiastic 
about the energy on stage and Shostakovich's wonderfully festive music, 
drawn from his first two Dance Suites and first Jazz Suite. Still, 
there is an uncertain tone about the ballet in its attempt to be funny 
and serious at the same time. The fleeting allusions to other works, 
including ``Don Quixote'' and, more interesting, the inventive twists 
on standard steps, suggest an in joke about ballet as an art form. 
Picone, entering with a mad rush to plunge into a tricky series of 
turns (he faces different parts of the stage to begin each turn), 
comes across as an egotistical male star. But when partnering Ms. 
Herrera, who drops casually in and out of alignment, he becomes a 
Pygmalion choreographer guiding what is an eccentric Galatea. Coherence 
is not the strong suit here, but there are good moments. Visually, 
Jennifer Tipton's lighting magnificently deepens shades of red on 
the backdrop and sets off Selya's black and red costumes. The cast 
includes Brian Reeder, Carlos Molina and four bubbly women with curls 
piled high on their heads: Stella Abrera, Anna Liceica, Anne Milewski 
and Gillian Murphy. The music, vividly conducted by Ermanno Florio, 
is also a delight. The galop from Dance Suite No. 1 introduces the 
four women, Picone's mad whirl and the leaps of the two other men. 
The witty plunks of Jazz Suite No. 1 (first movement) contrast with 
the reverie of Ms. Herrera's solo. With her ponytail and black tights 
under her tutu, she portrays a student. The choreography's collage 
of unrelated steps includes deep plies on toe and the quotations from 
``Don Quixote'' (kick to the back of the head, slapping a hand on 
the floor). When Ms. Herrera occasionally collapses into a ``wrong'' 
position, the word play of ``Disposition'' as a title flashes by subliminally. 
The Pygmalion duet, to deliberately sentimental music from Dance Suite 
No. 2, shows who is boss. Picone arrests Ms. Herrera's leap in midflight 
and corrects her alignment. A change of pace comes with two sections 
danced to the second and third movements of the Jazz Suite. The women 
swivel and twist, then undulate in a section with the less-than-tidy 
male soloists. Dance Suite No. 1 returns for the last two sections. 
A duet, somewhat lyrical, leads Ms. Herrera down Picone's back into 
an eventual embrace; a fast finale suggests that the student has graduated. 
Now it is she who nudges the ensemble into a straight line. Nacho 
Duato's ``Remanso,'' a very different ballet, also gets by as a showcase 
for dancing rather than food for thought. Granados' ``Valses Poeticos,'' 
played in the pit by the pianist Barbara Bilach, becomes a springboard 
for sheer dance power. As last year, a bare-legged male trio puts 
on an athletic display, not devoid of clarity and generalized passion. 
Vladimir Malakhov, Keith Roberts, and, in a fine, forceful debut, 
Maxim Belotserkovsky were terrific. In Clark Tippet's imaginative 
variations on neo-classical dance, ``Bruch Violin Concerto,'' the 
dancing was fine as long as you didn't look at the dancers' feet. 
Exceptions to the carelessness were Ashley Tuttle, who saved the day 
by giving every step full value and flourish, and Gillian Murphy, 
with her fierce attack in the stylized tango. Ron Oakland was the 
violin soloist.
