United Nations and private aid agencies are planning a three-day survey 
in Kosovo to assess the extent of damage from months of fighting. 
Lisa Shline in Geneva reports officials say the survey should begin 
on Monday. Aid agency officials say this will be the first comprehensive 
survey in Kosovo since fighting began in February. Workers from several 
dozen U.N. and private aid agencies will visit villages and towns 
throughout the province to measure the level of destruction. A spokesman 
for the U.N. refugee agency, Chris Unovsky, says the group sworn to 
learn how many houses had been destroyed and how many can be repaired. 
He says they also will count the number of people who have returned 
home and how many are still displaced. Mr. Unovsky says the aid agencies 
will then be in a better position to help people weather proof their 
houses and make other preparations for the region's harsh winter. 
The United Nations estimates around 200,000 people have been displaced 
within Kosovo. Most have moved in with relatives and friends. But 
U.N. officials believe about 10,000 ethnic Albanians are still camped 
out in the open on nearby mountains. Lisa Shline for VOA News, Geneva.
