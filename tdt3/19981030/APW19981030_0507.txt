Aston Villa's Australian goalkeeper, Mark Bosnich, was cleared of 
misconduct charges Friday after the Football Association found no 
proof that he swore at Everton fans. A three-man FA disciplinary committee 
dismissed the charge alleging that Bosnich had verbally abused fans 
during Villa's 0-0 draw at Goodison Park on Aug. 15. Letters from 
Everton fans claiming that Bosnich had done nothing wrong were produced 
as evidence at the 75-minute hearing. ``I would like to say a big 
thank you to all the supporters who wrote in with support, saying 
exactly what happened, and to the FA who reacted in a very fair and 
impartial way,'' Bosnich said. ``It's really all over now,'' he said. 
``I'd rather not hit the back pages for things like this. I'd rather 
it was all about football.'' In 1996, Bosnich was fined 1,000 pounds 
(dlrs 1,600) for making a Nazi-style salute during a game at Tottenham.
