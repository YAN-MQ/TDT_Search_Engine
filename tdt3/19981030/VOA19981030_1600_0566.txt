News reports in New York say federal prosecutors have filed secret 
charges against a former U.S. Army sergeant allegedly in connection 
with a global terror campaign against Americans. VOA's Elaine Johannsen 
reports. Ali Mohammed is said to be in custody in New York after being 
indicted last month. He reportedly was among several people charged 
in a wide reaching indictment that also covers recent U.S. embassy 
bombings in Africa. Mr. Mohammed, who once served in the Egyptian 
Army, came to the United States in 1985 and became a permanent resident. 
Shortly thereafter, Mr. Mohammed enlisted in the U.S. Army for three 
years. His duties included instructing American soldiers headed for 
the Middle East about Islamic culture and politics. According to the 
"New York Times," Mr. Mohammed is believed to have ties to a New York-based 
Muslim group connected with Saudi exile Osama bin Laden. Bin Laden 
is wanted in connection with the U.S. embassy bombings in Kenya and 
Tanzania in August. More than 250 people were killed in those bombings, 
including a dozen Americans. Charges have been brought in New York 
against three people accused of participating in those attacks. The 
"New York Times" reports U.S. authorities are working with a former 
associate of Ali Mohammed on a plea deal. U.S. law enforcement officials 
were not immediately available for comment. The story is being widely 
reported in New York, which has been target by terrorists in recent 
years from the 1994 World Trade Center bombing to a master plan to 
blow up city landmarks including the United Nations building. Elaine 
Johannsen, VOA News, New York.
