For the first time in the 17-year history of Big East women's basketball, 
a sophomore was named the preseason player of the year Thursday. She 
hardly seemed thrilled by the honor, and neither did her coach. At 
its annual day for the news media, the conference announced that the 
head coaches had chosen Svetlana Abrosimova of Connecticut. She is 
a 6-foot-2-inch forward (up from 6-1 last year) who also starts for 
the Russian national team. Last season, she averaged 14.4 points and 
a team-high 6.8 rebounds a game for Connecticut. She is barely 18 
years old. ``I feel apprehensive for her,'' said UConn coach Geno 
Auriemma, ``because to be that young, that far from home, to have 
that thrown on her shoulders is a lot. She doesn't need to go through 
all this. I'm anxious to see how it plays out.'' What did Abrosimova 
think? ``I don't know how to explain it,'' she said with a smile that 
seemed to say she would rather not have this burden or have to explain 
it. ``It's OK I'm enjoying college basketball. I was home this summer, 
and the whole summer I was looking forward to coming back to Connecticut.'' 
Abrosimova is a key player for UConn, which reached the National Collegiate 
Athletic Association tournament's regional finals last season. Its 
only experienced upperclassmen returning are Amy Duran, a 5-11 senior 
forward/guard; Paige Sauer, a 6-5 junior center, and Stacy Hansmeyer, 
a 6-1 junior power forward. UConn has five freshmen in an exceptional 
recruiting class, and one of them _ 5-8 Keirsten Walters or 5-9 Sue 
Bird _ may start at point guard. Nine coaches chose UConn to win the 
league title again, and the four others picked Rutgers. The key players 
for Rutgers are Tasha Pointer, a 5-6 sophomore whom Rutgers Coach 
C.Vivian Stringer calls the best point guard in the nation, and Tomora 
Young, a 5-10 shooting guard. Pointer will miss the next five to seven 
weeks after arthroscopic knee surgery. Last season, Rutgers' third 
under Stringer, the team reached the NCAA tournament regional semifinals. 
This year, she said with great optimism, ``We can be a Final Four 
team.''
