Tuesday the NBA announced cancellation of two more weeks of the season. 
That means networks that have paid big money to televise games have 
to find some quick substitutes. Susan Lisovicz reports. TNT plans 
to run a wrestling special on what would have been the nBA the openinging 
night. TBS will show a macho film, "the Delta force," the next night 
to replace that canceled NBA game. Turner sports is paying close to 
$900 million to carry NBA games over four years. It says none of its 
advertisers has yet to pull out of the replacement programming. But 
that could quickly change. From a business perspective, there are 
a lot of clients who only want the nba. And if TNT can't give them 
NBA, they're not going to spend the money. Some advertisers may need 
the weight and may be able to accept substitutes. It really depends 
-- it's on a case-by-case basis. NBC paid close to $2 billion for 
its own four-year deal with the nba. And while it's not scheduled 
to start televising games until late December, the network and Turner 
sports are effectively bankrolling the NBA lockout, because they have 
to pay the first year of the contract even if the entire season is 
canceled. It gives the owners a war chest. It gives them several hundred 
million dollars they would not otherwise have. Now, they have to give 
that money back over the life of the contract. But in the first year, 
the owners are taking in all of the television money. And it really 
gives them the ability to finance a lockout, much more so than if 
the television money wasn't there. And that could give owners an advantage 
in their hardball strategy with the players. Another advantage for 
owners and NBC is that the really big ratings don't come until next 
spring's playoffs. Players, on the other hand, are losing big money 
right now -- $200 million so far in lost wages. Susan Lisovicz, "CNN 
Financial News," New York.
