The European Union's Justice and Interior ministers agreed Friday 
to adopt legislation in member countries that would punish palm greasing 
and organized corruption within the private sector. At an informal 
meeting in Vienna, the ministers agreed to begin drafting laws that 
would allow authorities to monitor and punish private companies who 
offer or receive bribes for private contracts, the Austria Press Agency 
reported. Similar to legislation enacted last year to fine bureaucrats 
who accept and organizations or individuals that offer bribes, the 
EU's 15 individual members would first apply it within their own borders 
before subjecting international companies to the same laws. According 
to Austrian Justice Minister Nikolaus Michalek, the ministers agreed 
the measures were necessary to prevent the disruption of healthy competition 
and cause costs to rise artificially. The initiative will be brought 
before the formal meeting of the ministers to be held in early December, 
Michalek said. The move to punish private companies on an international 
level is unprecedented.
