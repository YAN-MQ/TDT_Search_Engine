And you can hear the World on stations including KXKN McCarthy, Alaska, 
also WNYE, Brooklyn, New York, WCPN, Cleveland, Ohio, and KUOP, Stockton, 
California. Still to come, foreign journalists keep their space shuttle 
coverage down to earth on PRI, that's Public Radio International. 
The World is sponsored by the Capitol Group companies, investing throughout 
the world for individuals and institutions. And the world is sponsored 
by Merck, dedicated to the needs of society through pharmaceutical 
research and consumer education to improve the quality of life. Merck, 
committed to bringing out the best in medicine. Stay tuned for more 
of the World, coming up. In the rest of the program, as Americans 
get ready for Halloween, Mexicans prepare to celebrate the more sober 
Day of the Dead. We'll hear more from Mexico City. Also, we'll hear 
from the director general of the World Health Organization, who tells 
us about the organization's campaign to roll back malaria. Those stories 
are coming up next, but first, here's the Franklin Institute forecast. 
Tonight, clear and chilly, low around 40. Saturday, mostly sunny and 
breezy, high 61. And Sunday, mostly sunny, high near 60. That's the 
forecast. Now back to the World on 91 FM.
