Stylists are the pillow-plumpers of the fashion industry. They make 
models and celebrities look their best by dressing them up for catwalks, 
awards shows and magazine shoots. But there is also an elite corps 
of super-stylists too important to merely accessorize. They work with 
photographers and designers to create a concept, a mood or a vision. 
One such stylist is Joe McKenna, a collaborator with some of fashion's 
most sought-after photographers. In a field of normally behind-the-scenes 
types, McKenna even has his own magazine, Joe's Magazine, which is 
named after himself, putting it in a field with other publications 
named for their creators like Forbes and Jane. But unlike these high-profile 
efforts, Joe's Magazine is a super glossy, photo-driven coffee-table 
publication for the fashion cognoscenti. Contributors include the 
photographers Bruce Weber, Craig McDean, Steven Klein and Jurgen Teller, 
who are also McKenna's friends. The frequency of Joe's Magazine might 
drive a subscriber around the bend. The first issue came out in 1992. 
The second is scheduled to appear this week. Known for understatement, 
McKenna, who was dressed in a gray sweatshirt and jeans at a Greenwich 
Village cafe the other day, offered little explanation for the six-year 
hiatus. ``I kept meaning to do it,'' he said. ``It's just that I never 
really found the time.'' He does stay busy. He looked jet-lagged, 
having flown in from Hamburg, Germany, where he helped Jil Sander 
with her spring 1999 collection. It might seem like a busman's holiday 
for McKenna and his circle to spend their off-hours doing the same 
stuff they do for their day jobs _ only for no money and a smaller 
audience. Their incentive, they say, is the freedom to work without 
commercial constraints. ``It seemed like it would be nice to do pictures 
where we didn't really have to worry about whether or not that person 
had a movie coming out, or an exhibition opening or whether we had 
to worry about getting certain clothes into the sitting,'' McKenna 
said. His magazine is filled with images that often seem strikingly 
unstyled. A fashion feature by Teller shows the model Kristen Owen 
curled in a fetal position in a flower bed wearing grungy corduroys 
and New Balance sneakers. Daniel Meadows' simple photographs capture 
young, working-class English people wearing their own matching plaid 
suits and other accidentally fashionable outfits. Weber shot Kate 
Moss topless, blowing bubbles. ``What separates Joe from other stylists 
is that he is open to exploring his fantasies,'' said Weber, who also 
contributed portraits of Hubert de Givenchy, the French couturier, 
and Carolyn Bessette Kennedy. ``He's interested in a lot of things: 
art, literature, music.'' When the first issue of Joe's Magazine came 
out, its 3,000 issues sold out at $45 each in a matter of weeks. There 
were pictures of Paul Cadmus by Bruce Weber, stories about the actor 
Dirk Bogarde and the French singer Vanessa Paradis and a portfolio 
of the designer Azzedine Alaia. The new issue is bigger than the last, 
200 pages, and McKenna plans to print 5,000 copies to be sold for 
$80 at bookstores. Unlike the last time, there is almost no text this 
time, apart from a brief interview with Miuccia Prada, whose advertising 
campaigns McKenna often styles. ``I just decided in the end that maybe 
articles weren't that necessary,'' McKenna said. ``I didn't want to 
write things just to fluff up the pictures.'' McKenna, who was raised 
in Glasgow, has been reading fashion magazines since he was 11. His 
entree into the fashion elite came when Weber noticed his work in 
the English magazine Tatler and invited him to New York. In 1986, 
he became the fashion editor of Vanity Fair, followed by a brief stint 
at Rolling Stone. McKenna finances the magazine himself and isn't 
looking for further backing to increase its frequency. ``I haven't 
gotten that far,'' he said. ``But I do think I'd like to do another 
one.'' Plan to look for it it 2004.
