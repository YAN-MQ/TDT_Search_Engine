Consumers have long complained about unexpected bank and credit-card 
fees. But far from scaling back their assault on householders' pockets, 
banks are apparently dipping their hands in even deeper. A new survey 
of 177 banks and credit unions by Siefer Consultants in Storm Lake, 
Iowa, showed that their reliance on fees and other ``noninterest income'' 
surged to 24 percent of their total income last year, from 18 percent 
in 1995. Moreover, the survey data show that banks became more likely 
to sharply increase routine charges for some services, and to reject 
customers' requests that fees be waived. The median annual rental 
price for a safe-deposit box, for example, soared 61 percent, to $26.82 
from $16.67 in 1995. It isn't just that fees are often higher; they 
can also be maddeningly confusing. Peter Clough, a longtime customer 
of the First National Bank of Maryland, was unpleasantly surprised 
when he opened his August statement to find $8.50 in charges for using 
automated-teller machines, including $1 just for looking up his balance. 
The bank had recently reclassified his account from ``value checking'' 
to ``everyday checking'' and increased the monthly fee from $8 to 
$10. At first, he tolerated this because he became eligible for all 
sorts of monthly rebates, including $2 if he had his payroll checks 
deposited directly and $2 if he never used a teller. The brochure 
announcing the changes, however, never explained that Clough, 40, 
a marketing consultant in Baltimore, would be charged $1.50 each for 
the three ATM transactions a month that used to be free. That information 
appeared only on page 22 of a separate disclosure statement. ``They 
default you into a program where you have to knock down their fees 
by using fewer of their overpriced services, and hide the fact that 
if you are using another bank's ATM you'll pay a fee you didn't pay 
before,'' Clough said. First National, a unit of First Maryland Bancorp, 
did not respond to repeated telephone and e-mail requests for comment. 
In a scramble to become less dependent on lending, banks have created 
a mind-bending array of fees _ 100 identified by Consumer Reports 
in 1996 and many more now, specialists say. Customers can pay extra 
not only for writing a check that bounces but also for unwittingly 
depositing somebody else's check that bounces; for withdrawing money 
from their account or for putting money into it; for replacing a personal 
identification number. Nancy Ness Judy, consumer affairs manager for 
the American Bankers Association, said that the fees reflect the increased 
number of products being offered, and added that ``the notion that 
disclosures have become less clear is simply not true.'' The proliferation 
of fees has attracted repeated congressional scrutiny. The House recently 
passed a bill to force banks to offer bare-bones accounts for those 
who want them, but the Senate killed it last month. Some practices 
seem to verge on the misleading. Consider Summit Bank, a unit of Summit 
Bancorp of New Jersey, whose ATM withdrawal receipts include an amount 
called the ``available balance.'' Many customers assume that this 
figure reflects money on deposit; it actually lumps that together 
with whatever credit the bank has authorized for overdrafts. A customer 
who then unknowingly uses some of the overdraft amount has actually 
taken out a loan, with interest rates of 12 percent to 18 percent. 
Barbara Horn, a Summit vice president, said the bank was ``reviewing 
alternative ways of displaying the balance.'' ``We're going to do 
something about this,'' she said. To be sure, most fees are disclosed 
by banks, though often in small type and unclear language. Banks and 
credit card companies go heavy on the term ``changes'' but often avoid 
the word ``increases,'' for example, in describing new policies on 
fees; as a result, consumers might assume they are referring to a 
mere technicality. PNC Bank in Pittsburgh recently began charging 
Jay and Cindy Galbraith of Bellefonte, Pa., a $2 monthly service fee 
on a savings account, even though they had several other accounts 
and a mortgage at PNC. In January, PNC told savings-account customers 
with balances under $1,500 that they would get only three free withdrawals 
a year, instead of an unlimited number. A PNC official defended the 
policy by saying that the bank was ``trying to put people into the 
appropriate accounts.'' That didn't appease Mrs. Galbraith, a clerical 
worker at Penn State University, who has decided to close the smaller 
savings account. ``With all the accounts and the business we do with 
them,'' she said, ``it's ridiculous.''
