British airways is scaling back plans for an alliance with American 
airlines, at least for now. The move is in response to demands from 
European regulators that the airline give up flights at London's heathrow 
airport. British airways says that's unacceptable and would rather 
relax ties with american airlines. American airlines says it is committed 
to its pact with B.A. and would offer its own version of a phased-in 
alliance in order to secure regulatory approval.
