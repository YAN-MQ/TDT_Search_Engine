While wary of coming negotiations in Congress over an austerity package 
to reduce Brazil's crippling deficits, investors here celebrated Friday 
over an agreement by the industrialized nations that opens the way 
for replenishing International Monetary Fund coffers with $90 billion. 
Two days after the Brazilian government presented an $80 billion, 
three-year package of spending reductions, tax increases and pension 
cutbacks, a team of Brazilian officials left Friday night for Washington, 
where they will go over the austerity package with IMF officials. 
They are also expected to work out the details of a letter of intent 
between Brazil and the IMF, one of the final steps before a formal 
agreement is announced that will create a special line of credit for 
Brazil. Markets here also surged after a syndicated column in the 
local press said the IMF could come up with as much as $45 billion 
to back up Brazil. The report was not attributed to any government 
official, and Finance Minister Pedro Malan said that no firm figure 
had been fixed for the aid, but it was sufficient to lift the markets. 
The Bovespa index in Sao Paulo jumped 7.78 percent Friday, leading 
markets across Latin America in a general upswing. In Argentina, the 
Merval rose 2.36 percent, while Bolsa of Mexico jumped 4.28 percent 
and Venezuela's main index was up 3.57 percent. ``People have been 
waiting for this IMF package and wondering if it's being put off for 
some reason,'' said Rick Johnston, a managing director at Offitbank 
in New York. The agreement by industrialized nations, he said, was 
``certainly part of the pop today.'' The Group of Seven industrialized 
nations on Friday accepted a series of demands laid out by the U.S. 
Congress when it approved an $18 billion contribution to the IMF. 
The measures are intended to make the lending agency less secretive 
and more likely to help countries well before their economies are 
in deep trouble. The agreement should bring in $90 billion that wealthy 
nations said would provide the framework for a system to protect emerging 
markets from the turbulence that has ravaged their economies for more 
than a year. Brazil, Latin America's largest nation, is considered 
the most likely candidate for such aid. In a news conference here 
Friday, Malan said the amount that Brazil would borrow from the IMF 
had not been determined. He noted that Brazil, unlike South Korea, 
Indonesia, Russia, and other victims of the financial firestorms over 
the last year, has not devalued its currency, the real, or defaulted 
on debt. ``It's not simple to define the amount, because there is 
no immediate need for the money,'' Malan said. ``What there is is 
a bet that it's possible to re-establish confidence, and the greatest 
demonstration of success of an operation like this will be precisely 
a low use of the resources that are made available to us.'' ``We are 
not talking about a rescue operation,'' Malan said. The cost of protecting 
the currency from devaluation, however, has been soaring interest 
rates, which make investments denominated in the real more attractive 
but make loans prohibitively costly to many Brazilian businesses, 
choking economic growth and increasing joblessness. In a sobering 
reminder of the impact of high interest rates, the auto parts industry 
in the Sao Paulo industrial area announced Thursday that it would 
be laying off 30,000 workers from a work force that now totals 80,000.
