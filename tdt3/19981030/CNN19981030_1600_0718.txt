60 years ago today, martians landed in grovers mill, New Jersey. At 
least, that's what an estimated 1 million people believed when they 
first heard orson welles' radio adaptation of "war of the worlds" 
back in 1938. An estimated 12 million people across the U.S. tuned 
in for the original radio broadcast. People in the tiny New Jersey 
town are celebrating its dubious place in history with a dinner party 
at a fancy hotel. The townspeople will dress as martians, there will 
be a simulated Martian ship and indoor pyrotechnics.
