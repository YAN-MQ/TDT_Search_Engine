The family of the British au pair convicted of killing a baby in her 
care has new legal troubles. "The Boston Herald" reports the FBI and 
British police are investigating louise Woodward's parents over discrepancies 
of at least $340,000 in her legal defense fund. Louise Woodward apparently 
is not a target of the investigation. Authorities are questioning 
bills submitted for reimbursement by Woodward's parents to the defense 
fund. Woodward returned to Britain in June after Massachusetts' highest 
court upheld her manslaughter conviction and sentence of 279 days.
