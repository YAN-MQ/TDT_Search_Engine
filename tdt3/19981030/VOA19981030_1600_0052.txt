The Palestinian authority has launched an unprecedented crackdown 
on militant groups in the wake of Thursday's attempt by Hamas to attack 
an Israeli school bus. VOA's Al Pessin reports from Jerusalem. After 
placing the spiritual leader of Hamas under house arrest on Thursday, 
the Palestinian police raided the house after midnight and is reported 
to have confiscated documents and arrested security guards. The sheik's 
phone line was not working and he was left virtually cut off from 
the outside world. The authority also arrested hundreds of other activists 
from Hamas and the smaller group, Islamic Jihad, apparently including 
nearly all their senior leaders. Palestinian justice minister Fray 
Habumaden says the autonomy authority will not accept any effort to 
destroy the achievements of the talks at the Wye Plantation last week. 
We don't want Hamas to get umbrella and. Israel says the Palestinian 
crackdown must be sustained to qualify for the promised hand-over 
of more land. Al Pessin, VOA News Jerusalem.
