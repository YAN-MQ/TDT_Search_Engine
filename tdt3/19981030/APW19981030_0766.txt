Bolstering a Spanish judge's efforts to extradite former Chilean dictator 
Augusto Pinochet, the National Court ruled Friday that Spain had jurisdiction 
over crimes committed during the military dictatorships in Chile and 
Argentina. The ruling would allow Judge Baltasar Garzon to continue 
his investigations into whether Pinochet committed genocide, terrorism 
and torture during his military dictatorship between 1973-90. Garzon 
issued an international arrest order on those charges, leading to 
Pinochet's detention in London on Oct. 16. But his probe against the 
82-year-old former Chilean leader was snarled earlier this week when 
Britain's High Court ruled that, as a former head of state, Pinochet 
had immunity from prosecution. He has been kept under arrest pending 
an appeal. Sources close to Garzon said that if the National Court 
backed him, he would continue to seek the extradition as long as Pinochet 
remained detained. Virginia Diez, a human rights lawyer, said Garzon 
planned to file for extradition next week. The 11-judge panel reached 
the decision after nearly five hours of deliberation. ``The panel 
has voted unanimously to reject the appeals and authorizes Spain to 
hear the facts of what happened,'' Carlos Cezon, one of the judges, 
announced. The decision was greeted with whoops of joy from lawyers 
backing the investigation and relatives of the victims who had gathered 
in the court in downtown Madrid. ``I am very happy that Pinochet can 
be tried in this country,'' Santiago Oyarzo, a Chilean citizen who 
said he was jailed and tortured in Villa Grimaldi, in Santiago, Chile, 
during the late 1970s. ``It's an immense homage to the disappeared 
(people) of Chile and Argentina, '' said Carlos Slepoy, a lawyer representing 
families of Argentine victims. ``From a legal point of view its a 
landmark decision.'' Pinochet, who is recovering from back surgery, 
remains under police guard in Britain. He was moved Thursday from 
the London Clinic to a private psychiatric hospital, which reports 
said could provide better security for the general. The British judges 
ordered Pinochet be held in custody until prosecutors appeal the ruling. 
The appeal is expected to be filed Monday to a five-judge panel in 
the House of Lords. The National Court decision Friday resulted from 
a protest filed in May by state prosecutors, who protested that Spain 
had no jurisdiction over such crimes. The decision does not deal specifically 
with Pinochet's detention or his extradition, but it was believed 
that Garzon's investigation would be strongly affected by a negative 
ruling. Pinochet has been widely accused of running a ruthless regime. 
During his rule, 3,197 political opponents died or disappeared, according 
to a Chilean government report. Garzon says, graf 16 pvs
