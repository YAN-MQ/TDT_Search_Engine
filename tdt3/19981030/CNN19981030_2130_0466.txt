A ruptured gas main touched off an explosion and fueled a spectacular 
fire today in Chicago. Flames that were visible from two miles away 
shot up the side of an apartment building for elderly people. 500 
residents were evacuated safely. Heat from the fire could be felt 
a block away. The gas main was damaged by a construction crew. Four 
firefighters and six police officers were hurt, none seriously.
