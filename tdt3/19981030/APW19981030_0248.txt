The head of the European Parliament has written to Congolese President 
Laurent Kabila to protest the treatment of a prominent opposition 
figure who was prevented from leaving the country. In a telegram to 
Kabila made public late Thursday, Jose Maria Gil-Robles, expressed 
``deep concern'' about the treatment of Etienne Tshisekedi, Kabila's 
main political adversary in the Congolese capital, Kinshasa. The president 
of the European Union assembly said armed forces had surrounded Tshisekedi's 
home and Congolese authorities had prevented him leaving to attend 
European Parliament development meeting in Brussels on Oct. 26. ``I 
must protest in the strongest possible terms,'' Gil Robles wrote. 
He said the restrictions on Tshisekedi were ``contrary to democratic 
values'' and ``completely unacceptable.'' Tshisekedi, a prominent 
opponent of late Zairian dictator Mobutu Sese Seko called for democratic 
reforms after Kabila overthrew Mobutu in May, 1997. Kabila responded 
by arresting Tshisekedi and sending him into internal exile for five 
months. Since his return to Kinshasa in July, Tshisekedi has offered 
to broker peace talks between Kabila's government and rebels fighting 
to overthrow the Congolese leader.
