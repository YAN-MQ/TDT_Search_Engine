The death toll from a collision between five runaway rail cars and 
a bus rose to 26 on Friday when two more people died in a hospital, 
a news agency reported. Seventeen people remain in the hospital, one 
in grave condition, ITAR-Tass said, quoting doctors. The accident 
occurred Monday at an unmanned railroad crossing in Khabarovsk, about 
6,100 kilometers (3,800 miles) east Moscow. Five rail cars carrying 
concrete panels and other construction material broke away from a 
train, accelerated down a hill and struck a bus, splitting it in half. 
Transport officials said negligence was to blame and were investigating 
the engineer of the locomotive that had pulled the wagons. In a separate 
accident Friday, a train collided with a bus at an unguarded crossing 
in the southern Ural Mountains, killing the bus driver and a passenger, 
the ITAR-Tass news agency said. A preliminary investigation found 
the bus driver was to blame for the accident between Novoabzakovo 
and Tashbulatovo, ITAR-Tass said.
