Glenn's return to space is exciting people of all ages around the 
world. Jill Dougherty reports from a home for older people in Moscow. 
Just minutes before the shuttle blasted off, Russian TV anchor tatyana 
mitkova breathlessly broke into programming with a live report. "The 
shuttle discovery is just about to take off. On board, 77-year-old 
senator John Glenn." At Moscow's senior citizen home number 29, Glenn's 
flight caused quite a Stir -- a 77-year-old in space. "We watched 
it on TV," says Maria smirnova, who's seven years younger than glenn. 
"To fly at that age is heroism. Good going." Her roommate, Alexandra 
buyeva, says she was amazed that someone Glenn's age maintained his 
health and was ready to go back to space again. Mrs. buyeva may not 
know the statistics -- the average life expectancy of a Russian woman 
now is 71 years. For a Russian man, it's 57. But she does know how 
older people live in Russia. And she says it's toughest for them. 
Pensions are tiny. And even if older people wanted to work, there's 
no place to go because of all the unemployment. For Valentin dzilba, 
who just celebrated his 80th birthday, Glenn's flight brought back 
memories from almost four decades ago, when Russian cosmonaut yuri 
gagarin became the first man in space. "I had the same feelings that 
we felt when gagarin went up," he says. "The exact same feelings. 
This is particularly nice, because gagarin was a lot younger and this 
is a More experimental flight." In his youth, Mr. dzilba was in the 
Russian air force. He says he'd like to fly again, too. So, as John 
Glenn returns to space, some of Russia's 70 somethings say they're 
inspired. "Into space?" Maria smirnova asks. "Sure, I'd fly there, 
as long as it's okay to live there," she says. "I'd go once, I'd just 
have to come back." Jill Dougherty, CNN, Moscow.
