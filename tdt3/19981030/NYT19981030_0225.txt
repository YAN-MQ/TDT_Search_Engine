SATURDAY'S TOP GAMES No. 19 Georgia 6-1 No. 8 vs. Florida 6-1 at Jacksonville, 
Fla. Florida should get by here, although it is prone to close calls. 
Georgia upended the Gators last year, and as Orantes Grant, the Bulldog 
linebacker, said, ``People say we kind of snuck up on them, but they're 
not saying that anymore.'' No. 13 (tie) Oregon 6-1 No. 17 at Arizona 
7-1 Oregon is averaging 44 points a game, but its killing schedule 
and tailback Reuben Droughns' broken leg may take a toll. Arizona 
held Northeast Louisiana to 205 yards in total offense last week, 
and its home-field advantage could decide this Pacific 10 game. No. 
18 Texas 5-2 No. 6 Nebraska 7-1 Ricky Williams of Texas, with 259 
yards against Baylor last week, leads the nation in rushing, averaging 
212 yards a game. But Nebraska has more guns, although it too often 
must be bailed out by backup quarterbacks. A former walk-on quarterback, 
Monte Christo, will start. EAST Pittsburgh (2-4) at Syracuse (4-2) 
This should be easy for Syracuse, the only team unbeaten in Big East 
play. Temple (1-6) at Rutgers (3-4) Rutgers is an underdog at home 
to another Big East weak sister. Princeton (3-3) at Columbia (2-4) 
Princeton's offense (460 yards against Harvard) is better than Columbia's 
defense. Yale (3-3) at Penn (4-2) Both teans had monster running games 
last week, thrusting them into a four-way tie for the Ivy lead. SOUTH 
West Virginia (4-2) at Virginia Tech (6-1) The difference may be Al 
Clark, who returns as the Tech quarterback after five weeks away with 
a sprained right foot. Boston College (3-4) at Miami (4-2) If Boston 
College can gain 610 yards against Navy and still lose, how does it 
beat a good Miami team? No. 3 Tennessee (6-0) at South Carolina (1-7) 
Tennessee's offense, which thrived against Georgia and Alabama, should 
have an easy time. North Carolina (3-3) at No. 5 Florida State (7-1) 
Florida State's defense (212.3 yards a game) ranks first in the land. 
No. 12 Arkansas (6-0) at Auburn (2-5) Auburn, off to its worst start 
since 1952, can still be dangerous. No. 13 (tie) Georgia Tech (5-2) 
vs. Maryland (2-5) at Baltimore Maryland doesn't beat anyone in the 
Atlantic Coast Conference. No. 21 Virginia (6-1) at Wake Forest (3-4) 
Virginia, despite a banged-up and erratic defense, should coast. MIDWEST 
No. 2 Ohio State (7-0) at Indiana (3-4) Ohio State has the offense 
(524 yards last week) and defense (229.1 yards a game, second best 
in Division I-A). No. 4 Kansas State (7-0) at Kansas (3-5) A breather 
for Kansas State before it finishes against Baylor, Nebraska and Missouri. 
Baylor (2-5) at No. 15 Notre Dame (5-1) The Irish cannot get careless 
the way they did last week against Army. No. 24 Michigan (5-2) at 
Minnesota (4-3) Minnesota keeps getting beaten up by the better Big 
Ten teams. SOUTHWEST No. 7 Texas A&AMP;M (7-1) at Oklahoma State (3-4) 
The Aggies should win, but State has scared some good teams. No. 23 
Missouri (5-2) at Texas Tech (6-2) A tight game. Missouri gained only 
166 yards against Nebraska and almost won. FAR WEST No. 16 Washington 
(5-2) at No. 25 Southern California (5-3) Southern Cal, despite a 
pallid offense, is two field goals and a safety away from a 7-1 record. 
Southern Methodist (3-5) at No. 11 Air Force (6-1) Air Force, first 
in the nation in rushing (306.7 yards a game), should roll up first 
downs. MISMATCHES Stanford (1-6) at No. 1 UCLA (6-0) As Al Borges, 
UCLA's offensive coordinator, said, ``We've reached a point where 
we don't expect to lose, and that's where you want to be.'' Illinois 
(2-6) at No. 10 Penn State (5-1) Penn State's offense is getting better, 
its defense much better. Ratings by The New York Times computer.
