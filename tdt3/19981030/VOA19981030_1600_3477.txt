It's Friday, October 30th, 1998. Sixty years ago today, many Americans 
living in the northeastern states mistakenly believed Earth was being 
invaded by monsters by the planet Mars. Panic seized some radio listeners 
as they heard of the invasion, but what they were listening to was 
an ingenious radio dramatization by Orson Welles and his Mercury Theater 
of British author H.G. Welles science fiction story, "The War of the 
Worlds." The producers had warned the audience at the start of the 
radio drama, although the program was presented in the form of a news 
broadcast, it was fiction. Many in the radio audience missed the announcement 
or convinced by the reality of the production, simply ignored it. 
Some New Yorkers and residents of New Jersey and Pennsylvania continued 
to believe the drama even after the fictional Martians had already 
supposedly destroyed their neighborhoods.
