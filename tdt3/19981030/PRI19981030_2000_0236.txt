Actor Tommy Lee Jones said tonight that he was not seriously hurt 
in a riding accident that caused him to be airlifted to a Houston 
hospital to be evaluated for possible spinal injuries. In a statement 
issued through his publicist, the 52-year-old actor said he was sore 
but not hurt after his horse stumbled, threw him and then stepped 
on him during a polo game. A spokeswoman said Jones suffered bruises, 
but no broken bones and that doctors have said there was no spinal 
injury.
