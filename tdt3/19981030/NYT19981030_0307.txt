In 1965, the No. 1 pop record in the United States was ``My Girl,'' 
a sugary ballad sung by five young men from Detroit who called themselves 
the Temptations. The tale of how they reached that exalted moment, 
and of the tragic letdown that followed, has been dramatized in ``The 
Temptations,'' a four-hour film that NBC is presenting Sunday and 
Monday nights. The group, with changing membership, continued to make 
top-rated records for 10 years, then kept right on singing. The pasteurized 
rhythm-and-blues sound of hits like ``Get Ready'' and ``Papa Was a 
Rollin' Stone'' will be warmly familiar to the baby boomers who keep 
oldies acts, including the Temptations, in business. But these greatest 
hits cannot compensate for the movie's bland storytelling. At least 
19 men have blended their voices as Temptations since the group was 
welcomed under the wing of Berry Gordy, the master of Motown, in 1961. 
But only one singer, Otis Williams, has been part of the act every 
precision dance step of the way. Not only is Williams still singing 
with the Temptations, but he is also the sole member of the original 
quintet still alive. History may be written by the victors, but it 
is certainly edited by the survivors. Williams is listed as a co-producer 
of the film, which was based on his autobiography. And while he played 
a background role onstage and on record, he describes himself as the 
glue that held the group together, sometimes at painful personal expense. 
The film ticks off the terrible sacrifices made by Williams and the 
other Temptations, who were ultimately destroyed by their dalliances 
with fame. But this real-life drama is hammered into flat melodrama. 
Portraying Williams, Charles Malik Whitfield is called upon to age 
some 30 years, from a teen-ager with a heart full of dreams to a middle-aged 
man with a head full of memories. The passage of time is represented 
by changing clothes and hair styles; one looks in vain for any deeper 
consequences of time's passing. But what can any actor do with a script 
that conveys youthful hope with a line like ``We ain't got nowhere 
to go but up''? As written by Kevin Arkadie, Robert P. Johnson and 
Alan Landsburg and directed by Allan Arkush, the film is the grandchild 
of the oversimplified Technicolor show-biz biopics of the 1940s. It 
rushes through a dizzying series of vignettes, giving them all equal 
weight, before rushing on to the next snippet of song. The most fascinating 
of the early Temptations, self-destructive David Ruffin, played by 
an actor known simply as Leon, is reduced to a catlike swagger. A 
few actors do manage to move beyond the cryptic script into flesh-and-blood 
characterizations. As the bass Melvin Franklin, Williams' only real 
friend among the Temptations, D.B. Woodside locates the essence of 
a mama's boy who matures into a man. Along with the film's two mamas, 
Jenifer Lewis as Melvin's mother and Tina Lafford as Otis', he suggests 
the kind of heartfelt film that might have been.
