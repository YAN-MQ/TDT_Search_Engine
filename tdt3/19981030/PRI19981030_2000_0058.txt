From National Public Radio News in Washington, I'm Cory Flintoff. 
A Federal judge in Washington has named a special investigator to 
look into allegations that the office of independent counsel Kenneth 
Starr illegally leaked secret information from the grand jury investigating 
President Clinton's relationship with Monica Lewinsky. Judge Norma 
Holloway Johnson cited 24 news reports as evidence of possible illegal 
leaks. She instructed the special investigator to determine whether 
Starr's office should be held in contempt. White House spokesman Greg 
Craig said the investigation supports the White House contention that 
Starr's investigation has been unfair. All of this raises again the 
specter of the pattern of bias and unfairness that we believe has 
characterized this investigation, White House spokesman Greg Craig. 
Judge Johnson has asked that the investigation be completed by the 
end of November.
