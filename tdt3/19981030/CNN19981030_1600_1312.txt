Longhorn fans are hoping college football's leading rusher will be 
the difference as Texas takes on Nebraska. I think he's a guy that 
sees things very well. There's a big picture when he's running. When 
you have a back like that, you don't have to block every play perfectly. 
We see this as a good chance, you know, to be on TV around the country. 
And people see us playing, maybe we can get in the rankings.
