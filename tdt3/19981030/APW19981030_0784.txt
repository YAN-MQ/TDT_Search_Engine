The first session of the newly-elected Bosnian Serb parliament broke 
up early Friday after rival Serb camps failed to agree on the assembly's 
leadership. After seven hours of heated debate, legislators in the 
83-seat assembly could not agree on a parliament speaker and his two 
deputies. The session adjourned before dawn Friday and is to resume 
Wednesday. Later Friday, two ministers in the current, pro-Western 
Bosnian Serb government resigned. The interior minister Milovan Stankovic 
and Justice Minister Petko Cancar were replaced by Sredoje Novic and 
Milan Trbojevic. Stankovic became interior minister last January when 
Bosnian Serb police were deeply divided in their loyalty to the rival 
Serb camps. In his letter of resignation, Stankovic said his successor 
will face ``extremely complex and heavy tasks.'' The parliament, 3rd
