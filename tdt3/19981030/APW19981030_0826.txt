Dutch striker Pierre van Hooijdonk rejoined Nottingham Forest Friday 
after a three-month boycott. But for how long? Van Hooijdonk, who 
returned to the club under tight security after saying over the summer 
it lacked ambition, said he was still on the transfer list. He apologized 
to the fans _ but apparently not to coach Dave Bassett nor his teammates. 
Van Hooijdonk, who scored 34 goals last season and helped Forest gain 
promotion to the Premier League, was escorted by a dozen security 
guards at the City Ground as he was practiced and met with the Bassett. 
Bassett has admitted being unhappy with Van Hooijdonk's return and 
said he will attempt to sell him on the transfer market. Van Hooijdonk, 
who helped the Netherlands to a fourth place at the World Cup in France, 
was placed on the transfer list three months ago when he refused to 
rejoin the club during summer training. And he's still there after 
going unsold for three months at the club's 8-million-pound (dlrs 
13.4 million) asking price. ``I remain on the transfer list,'' Van 
Hooijdonk said. ``I want to be as successful as possible with Forest, 
and who is saying I will get a move? ``I think we will only be able 
to see after a couple of months after I've been playing again and 
hopefully playing well because if you don't play well, you can be 
on the list for 100 years.'' ``In football, nobody, but nobody, can 
guarantee that he has a long-term future at any club.'' Pressed by 
reporters, he declined to say he had apologized to his teammates or 
Bassett. ``I've spoken to the players and I've spoken to the manager. 
Everything that's been discussed has stayed inside (the club),'' he 
said. ``I feel sorry for the supporters in a certain way because they've 
been watching a club at the beginning of the season which has been 
missing somebody. ``I feel sorry for them because they were never 
a part in this matter. From that point of view, I definitely feel 
sorry.'' His refusal to rejoin the club angered many Nottingham Forest 
fans, who view him as one in a long line of foreign stars in the country 
who have not always shown loyalty to their English sides. But with 
Forest lying three points from the bottom of the league table, the 
fans may be willing to forgive Van Hooijdonk if he can score goals. 
``He has proved his point,'' 23-year-old fan David Vaughan said. ``He 
reckoned the team was not good enough and it isn't. If he comes back 
and gets the goals to take us up the table then it's worth it.''
