City leaders are calling it a tragedy of incomprehensible dimension. 
A fire raged through a dance hall during a halloween party in gothenburg 
sweden last night. It killed at least 63 people. More than 170 were 
injured. The building was jammed with about 400 young people, most 
of them just 13 to 18 years of age. The building had a maximum occupancy 
of 150. People say most of the victims either suffocated on smoke 
and poisonous gas, or they were trampled in the panic. We were inside, 
but we came out quickly when we saw the fire. But some of the kids 
went again inside to help their friends and girlfriends. But the fire 
started so quickly, they didn't have a chance to get out again. They 
were stuck inside. Investigators aren't sure what caused the fire. 
There are some reports that say an electrical spark could have triggered 
the blaze. Others say officials suspect arson because the fire spread 
so quickly.
