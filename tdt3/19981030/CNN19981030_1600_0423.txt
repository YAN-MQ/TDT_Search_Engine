The Palestinian authority is intensifying its crackdown on the militant 
wing of the Islamic group Hamas. Today, Palestinian police cut the 
phone lines of Hamas founder sheik Ahmed yassin and the group's leading 
activists. Yassin is under house arrest. 100 Hamas activists have 
been arrested since the group claimed responsibility for a suicide 
bombing in Gaza yesterday. The bomber tried to ram an explosives-laden 
car into a bus full of Jewish children, but an Israeli army Jeep blocked 
its path. An Israeli soldier was killed.
