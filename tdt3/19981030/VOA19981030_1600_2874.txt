1998 has been a bad year for Florida's official marine mammal. State 
officials estimate that the mortality rate for West Indian manatee 
will exceed that of 1997 when 242 died, the second highest toll on 
record. Nancy Sedusky with the Save the Manatee Club says these vegetable 
loving, slow-moving creatures whose closest relative is the elephant, 
have no natural enemy. Almost 45 percent of manatee mortalities where 
they can determine the cause of death are caused by human-related 
circumstances. Most manatee deaths occur from collisions with speed 
boats but also result from accidents and canals or flood structures 
and from disease or cold weather. Florida governor, Lawton Chiles, 
has declared November Manatee Awareness Month to better educate Florida 
residents and visitors about manatee protection. With U.S. environment 
briefs, I'm Roseanne Skirbel.
