And on this week's U.S. environmental briefs, VOA's Roseanne Skirbel 
takes a closer look at the Green vote in next week's elections in 
this country and a new report on the dangers of over fishing, and 
at the decline of the manatee in Florida. The political choices Americans 
make in midterm elections next Tuesday will also be a vote on the 
environment. At stake are such national issues as clean air and water, 
protections of natural resources and wildlife that are being played 
out in local elections with votes on issues such as highway funding, 
destruction of farm land, and timber cutting. Sierra Club National 
Conservation director Bruce Hamilton says the campaign strategy of 
the nation's oldest environmental organization is to defeat candidates 
with poor environmental voting records. So for instance in the North 
Carolina Senate race, Lautch Faircloth, who is the incumbent Republican 
senator from that area, he owns some big hog farms. They regularly 
polluted the rivers and caused fish kills in North Carolina. And at 
the same time, he's advocating legislation that makes it harder to 
keep our rivers clean by weakening the Clean Water Act. Similarly 
Alfonse D'Amato, the Republican incumbent senator from New York. We've 
been running ads up there exposing his bad environmental record. Seventy 
percent of the time he votes against the environment making it harder 
to clean up the Hudson River from PCV contamination. You express concern 
with the voting record of some members of Congress. Do you expect 
much movement in this election? I don't expect a lot but this particular 
election is extremely important because so much is in play. Right 
now, one of ways that we manage to stop bad environmental legislation 
is by appealing to the White House to threaten bad environmental legislation 
and then manage to rally at least a third of the Senate to support 
that veto because it requires two-thirds to override a veto. Bruce 
Hamilton with the Sierra Club says his organization is supporting 
pro environment candidates in close races in Washington state, California, 
Nevada, and Wisconsin. But he says the hardest struggle will be to 
combat apathy with the political process and get the American electorate 
out to vote.
