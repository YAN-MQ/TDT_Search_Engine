Wall Street is ever searching for corporate executives upon whom it 
can pin hopes of miraculous jumps in stock prices. Back in 1996, for 
example, before Al Dunlap was unmasked as a mere pretender to the 
title of corporate turnaround king, investors bid up shares of the 
Sunbeam Corp. on news that Dunlap was riding to its rescue. A similar 
thing happened to the CBS Corp.'s stock last week. Mel Karmazin, president 
of the company, was named chief executive on Wednesday. This news, 
along with a better-than-expected earnings announcement, popped its 
shares to $28, up 10 percent in a day. Karmazin will succeed Michael 
H. Jordan, the man who bought CBS in 1995 on his way to transforming 
Westinghouse from a gritty industrial maker of stoves, freezers and 
nuclear generators into a sexy media enterprise. One of the properties 
he bought to help him achieve the makeover was Infinity Broadcasting, 
the largest operator of radio stations in the country _ run by Mel 
Karmazin. Investors certainly like what they see in Karmazin. A hard-driving 
entrepreneur, he is known for setting tough sales goals, then getting 
rid of those who don't meet them. He recently announced layoffs of 
300 people in CBS' news division. And as the company's largest shareholder, 
Karmazin has priorities that are aligned with those of his investors. 
He has another skill: spinning the Street. ``Mel is well known on 
Wall Street as a broadcaster who keeps his eye on the value of the 
company's stock, as well as lean operations and building revenue,'' 
said Gil Schwartz, senior vice president of communications at CBS. 
``We're dedicated to 10 percent sales growth a year, regardless of 
market conditions.'' Wall Street's faith in Karmazin derives from 
his track record at Infinity. Between 1992, when he took the company 
public, and 1996, when he sold to CBS, Infinity shares rose 58 percent 
a year, on average. Shareholders under Jordan, first at Westinghouse 
and then at CBS, didn't fare as well. Graef Crystal, the executive 
compensation expert, says that between June 1993, when Jordan began 
running Westinghouse, and September 1998, the stock was outperformed 
by 60 percent of the companies in the Standard &AMP; Poor's 500. Even 
though investors are sold on Karmazin, it is not at all clear that 
he can do at CBS what he did at Infinity. There, he was good at taking 
high-performing operations and squeezing a bit more juice out of them. 
Furthermore, he was operating in prosperous economic times. Turning 
around lagging operations is another matter, especially in a slow-growth 
environment. One way Karmazin plans to increase CBS' revenues is by 
selling advertising packages across its various media outlets. Of 
that strategy, Jim Citrin, managing director of the communications 
and media practice at Spencer Stuart &AMP; Associates, said, ``Unless 
it's driven by great content exploited across multiple platforms, 
it's unproven.'' Wall Street's ardor is a fickle thing, of course. 
And skeptics note that some of the recent brokerage-firm bullishness 
on CBS may be related to the company's planned initial public offering 
of a 20 percent stake in its radio operations. Winning the underwriting 
would give a welcome lift to firms that have seen fees from securities 
issuance disappear. ``There's a reason everybody's struggling in the 
business,'' a senior broadcasting executive said. ``The idea that 
some messiah is going to come in with a golden touch is Wall Street 
trying to create something to hang onto.''
