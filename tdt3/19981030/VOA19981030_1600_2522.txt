Everyone expected Japan, the world's second largest economy, to come 
to the aid of its Asian neighbors when this crisis first began, but 
Japan itself has been suffering from a long slump. VOA economics correspondent 
Barry Wood says the best thing Japan can do for the rest of Asia is 
to recover from its own recession. Japan is a very substantial market 
for all of the other Asian economies. If they were operating normally, 
they would be buying products, they would be lending money, and they 
would be investing in these economies. Most of the foreign direct 
investment in Malaysia is Japanese. Much of it in Thailand is Japanese. 
Indonesia likewise. That investment has halted. So what Japan has 
to do, quite simply, is get out of recession. And yet, there's no 
prospect that they will. Japan has been lingering for a long time 
in recession, not seeming to be able to break out. What are the fears 
and what are the hopes? It is the question of the day, because Japan 
is in a unique situation that really has never been experienced in 
the post war period. And that is a liquidity squeeze and a liquidity 
trap. This is what John Maynard Cane in the 1930s discussed in an 
abstract manner, that you could have interest rates barely above zero, 
and yet banks would not lend and consumers would not buy because they 
were fearful of the future. So now you find the government in Japan 
playing around with these desperation measures like sending out gift 
certificates to everyone. And yet, that probably is the direction 
they need to go, because they've done all the usual things to stimulate 
the economy. They have spending program after spending program announced 
by the government. They have rescued the banks. They're spending a 
great deal of money to do so. But it is still in this trap of a credit 
squeeze, a liquidity trap, and no prospects really for getting out 
soon. It's a tragic situation because the world depends on Japan, 
and nothing has worked. So it's hard to be optimistic. VOA economics 
correspondent Barry Wood. The role of the United States, Japan, and 
the European Union can play in pulling the rest of the world out of 
recession was the subject of today's edition of Dateline. I'm Linda
