Here in New York, the government is holding a former U.S. army sergeant, 
they say,ab may have been involved in the terrorist organization of 
osama bin laden. The irony here, the former sergeant, Ali Muhammed, 
was teaching troops anti-terrorist measures and now there's suspicion 
he was involved himself in terrorism. So far, it's just a suspicion. 
I'm a former Egyptian officer. This is Ali Muhammed when he was a 
sergeant in the U.S. army. In the mid-'80s, Muhammed had joined the 
U.S. army as a resident alien. He was stationed as a training officer 
at FT. Bragg, North Carolina, where he trained U.S. special forces. 
For counterterrorist missions. Now, sources say, Muhammed is being 
held on charges of lying to federal agents investigating the international 
terrorist network of Saudi millionaire osama bin laden. The charges 
are sealed and federal prosecutors are not commenting on the case. 
It's not immediately known what alleged role he plays in bin laden's 
organization, or if investigators have drawnny connections between 
the former army officer and the bombings in east Africa. What investigators 
do know that videotapes of Ali Muhammed training at the -- Access 
to turned up in some very suspicious places. The FBI found them in 
the home of this man, a suspected terrorist later convicted in a plot 
to blow up American landmarks. Nosair's lawyer told us today that 
Muhammed did train nosair He was on active duty. He came here numerous 
times. U.S. officials deny he was working for him when he conducted 
that training, but they don't deny they are making as many arrests 
as possible, to bring the maximum amount of heat on anyone who may 
know about bin laden's operations. John Miller, ABC News, New York.
