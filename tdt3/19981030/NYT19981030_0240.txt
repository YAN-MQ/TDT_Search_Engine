Diane Von Furstenberg surely had the most photographed cheekbones 
of the 1970s. A woman who could flirt with the camera in ways that 
helped shape her career, she flaunted her formidable bone structure 
for the leading image makers of her day: Francesco Scavullo, Ara Gallant 
and, most memorably, Andy Warhol. Warhol snapped the Polaroid that 
would become the model for his well-known serial portrait of Ms. Von 
Furstenberg, capturing her with lips slightly parted and one arm flung 
dramatically over her head. So it was jolting, after the recent premiere 
of ``Life Is Beautiful,'' Roberto Benigni's emotionally wrenching 
fable set in Italy during the Holocaust, to see those famous contours 
soften. What's more, Ms. Von Furstenberg was waxing effusive, pronouncing 
Guido, the hero, a loser, albeit one who succeeds in defying his fate. 
``So sad,'' she said in her satiny continental drawl, ``sad, but I 
can identify. There are moments that I feel my life is glamorous, 
and I love it, but. . . .'' Her words trailed off, leaving unspoken 
the notion that beneath her privileged, high-gloss image there are 
depths unknown. It was Ms. Von Furstenberg who had suggested that 
a reporter interview her around a screening of a film about the Holocaust. 
What could she have had in mind, this consummate image maker, if not 
to downplay the popular perception of ``DVF,'' the glamourpuss and 
social gadabout, in order to highlight ``Diane,'' the woman of substance 
and soul? A picture of sobriety, dressed in black, her makeup carefully 
understated, Ms. Von Furstenberg offered an assessment of Benigni's 
film. ``Love wins, that's the point, at least that's how I interpret 
it,'' she said, piercing straight to the movie's sentimental core. 
In it, the hero, played with great comic verve by Benigni himself, 
saves his small son from the terrors of Auschwitz by persuading him 
that his cruel keepers are only playing a game. Smiling through a 
glaze of tears, Ms. Von Furstenberg went on to characterize the plot 
as the triumph of not just love, but of will. To hear her tell it, 
Ms. Von Furstenberg, 51, has always possessed a surfeit of both. One 
couldn't be sure, however, whether by love she meant the flattering 
attentions of former boyfriends like Richard Gere and Alain Elkann, 
an Italian journalist and novelist, or the string of sycophants who 
kept filing by after the screening to pay her court, addressing her 
as princess more than once. More likely she was referring to the devotion 
of her daughter, Tatiana, 27, a writer, who sat smiling affectionately 
at her side; or of her longtime companion, Barry Diller, the chairman 
of USA Networks, whom she called ``almost a husband.'' Although they 
live on opposite coasts, they are in touch by phone several times 
a day, Ms. Von Furstenberg said. Their relationship, long assumed 
to be platonic, is ``very intimate,'' she said tersely. ``More than 
that, I'm not going to tell you.'' Her steely will is the legacy of 
her mother, Lily Halfin, a survivor of Ravensbrueck and Auschwitz, 
and clearly the designer's most inspiring role model. A woman of stunning 
resilience, Mrs. Halfin insists to this day on putting a gloss on 
even her most harrowing experiences, as described in Ms. Von Furstenberg's 
new memoir, ``Diane, A Signature Life'' (Simon &AMP; Schuster). Ms. 
Von Furstenberg said her mother never tires of dispensing homilies 
for her children to live by: ``Something that's bad, you've got to 
turn into a positive.'' ``Believe in it and it will go.'' And those 
credos have served Ms. Von Furstenberg well. Any student of DVF lore 
_ and after three decades of being in and out of the spotlight, there 
are many _ can recite Ms. Von Furstenberg's high points: an escape 
to boarding school from the stultifyingly middle-class girlhood in 
Brussels; an early marriage to Egon Von Furstenberg, an Austrian prince 
with a 500-year old title, and the birth of her children, Alexandre 
and Tatiana, while she was still in her 20s. There was also the vertiginous 
climb up New York's social ladder, culminating in a gust of scandal 
with a 1973 New York magazine cover story with the headline: ``The 
Couple That Has Everything. Is Everything Enough?'' It looked askance 
at the louche life style she and her husband led. And there was, of 
course, Ms. Von Furstenburg's fashion business, which got its powerful 
jump-start when Diana Vreeland, Vogue's formidable editor in chief, 
agreed to take a look at a dozen or so dresses that Ms. Von Furstenberg 
had been peddling around town in a suitcase. Fueled by the success 
of her wrap dress, a close-fitting, patterned jersey worn by suburban 
matrons, socialites and secretaries alike, that business could justifiably 
be called an empire by the end of the 1970s. In 1979, annual retail 
sales of all products bearing Ms. Von Furstenberg's name, from eyewear 
to luggage and home furnishings, totaled $150 million. Ms. Von Furstenberg's 
promotion of her label played against a backdrop of parties, premieres 
and opening nights spent rubbing shoulders with the self-venerating 
likes of Halston, Bianca Jagger, Ian Schrager and Kenneth Jay Lane. 
But to bring up those days now is to make the designer squirm. ``I've 
really been to Studio 54 only a few times,'' Ms. Von Furstenberg insisted, 
still bent, it seemed, on editing the past _ never mind that her memoir 
had already reached the stores. ``I don't go to clubs and parties 
much.'' . Say what? Is this the same Diane Von Furstenberg who put 
off this reporter for several days because, as she explained, nothing 
could keep her from the celebrity-studded party last month to open 
Bellagio, the hotel and casino in Las Vegas? ``I have to be there 
_ it's something you just can't miss,'' she said with a laugh that 
nearly succeeded in masking her urgency. The same Diane who confided 
in her memoir that, at one time, she routinely prowled Studio 54 unaccompanied 
because ``I love the feeling of walking in alone, like a cowboy walking 
into a saloon.'' It is the same woman, indeed. Reminded of such passages, 
Ms. Von Furstenberg, who has over the years chased notoriety and respectability 
by turns, admitted: ``Walking into clubs by myself _ I thought it 
was so hot. I loved the rush. I loved to break taboos. I very much 
wanted to have a man's life in a woman's body. Even now I think of 
myself as very much the aventuriere.'' She amended, ``But it's only 
an image,'' one among many that over the years she has tried on and 
discarded like costumes. There was feral Diane, who stalked by night, 
a switchblade in her handbag. ``All I did with it was peel apples,'' 
she wrote. ``But I liked the idea of having it.'' There was Diane 
the island goddess, sashaying through Cloudwalk, her Connecticut estate, 
swathed in the sarongs she had acquired in Bali, along with Paulo, 
her swarthy boyfriend, who inspired her perfume, Volcan D'Amour, introduced 
in the late 1980s. And not least, there was Diane the tycoon, who 
cultivated a swagger befitting her status, striding through airports, 
as she wrote, ``wearing fishnet stockings and impossibly high heels, 
smiling at my shadow.'' And glorying in her success. ``I was one of 
the guys, it was so much fun,'' she recalled. ``But I never made the 
man feel small.'' Nor, conversely, was she about to let any man make 
her feel insignificant. Diller, speaking by car phone from Los Angeles, 
said: ``It isn't that she's competitive with men, or with anybody. 
But I don't think she carried any mythology about men. And that frees 
her, of course, to do what she wants.'' According to her memoir, Ms. 
Von Furstenberg has emerged chastened but toughened by many brushes 
with financial and personal ruin. But even in her most humiliating 
hours, she was sustained by her penchant for play-acting, performing 
the choicest parts for herself and spooling them back in her head 
like a flim. The good times were registered there: drifting on a gondola 
like Silvana Mangano in ``Death in Venice,'' strolling insouciantly 
as Dorothy Lamour along a Balinese beach. In 1983, her empire reduced 
to a fistful of cheapened licensees, she found herself pleading with 
executives at Wal-Mart for a chance to revive her brand. ``Everyone 
was polite,'' she writes, ``but it was quite clear from their looks 
and the way they talked to me that they considered me something of 
a has-been.'' Reviewing such nadirs in her career, she said, ``Sometimes 
I feel like Willy Loman. He was such a loser _ but I completely identify. 
He touches me so much because I see the enthusiasm, then the rejection. 
I tell that to Barry all the time.'' By the early 1990s, with Diller 
cheering her on, she had recovered sufficiently to embark on a career 
in telemarketing, launching her Silk Assets line on QVC, the Home 
Shopping Network, which Diller eventually purchased. ``Her resilience 
is bred in the genes, it's in her very bones,'' Diller said. The same 
grit prompted her to reinvent herself once more. More than a year 
ago she bought a 15,000-square-foot Greenwich Village carriage house, 
which now serves as her home and fashion headquarters. About the same 
time, she noticed that young women her daughter's age were buying 
the wrap dress in vintage shops and flea markets, and she promptly 
reintroduced the style as the mainstay of her newly revived label. 
Never quite the runaway hit Ms. Von Furstenberg anticipated, the dress 
was spotted late this past summer languishing on racks at Saks Fifth 
Avenue and Bloomingdales. ``The stores simply bought too many,'' Ms. 
Von Furstenberg said, adding that Saks alone had ordered 15,000 pieces. 
The fashion trade press has reported that she has been looking for 
a financial partner for her business, and in an interview she did 
not deny it. She has countered the narrowness of the wrap's appeal 
by expanding her collection, offering a range of new dress styles 
and prints. Her show on Tuesday, at her downtown headquarters, will 
be replete with colorful day and evening dresses in her trademark 
sinuous jerseys and silks. Removing a slinky, bias-cut sample from 
a rack the other day, she glowed, clearly transported back to the 
'70s, a time when many women of her generation were living out ``Fear 
of Flying'' fantasies of torrid encounters with strangers on trains. 
``Look at this,'' she said, running a hand appreciatively along the 
dress' slippery surface. ``No zipper, no buttons, nothing. It doesn't 
make a sound when you take it off.'' As for the wrap, it is still 
thriving in small specialty stores, with which Ms. Von Furstenberg 
says she hopes to do a small but exclusive business. ``The dress has 
tremendous cachet with girls in their 20s,'' Nicole Fischelis, Sak's 
fashion director, said. ``To them getting a Diane Von Furstenberg 
is a big status thing.'' Lounging elastically in her living room _ 
a haute Bohemian pastiche of zebra patterned chairs, sisal rugs, Balinese 
carvings and gilt-threaded throws _ Ms. Von Furstenberg confided that 
the dress' appeal to the young mystifies her at times. ``These girls 
think of the wrap as sexy, young and daring,'' she said. ``I find 
that amazing. Why? Because it speaks of my own culture.'' She smiled, 
remembering that the wrap, a perfect meld of sexiness and propriety, 
had in its heyday been the chic uniform of a roster of celebrities. 
One of her fondest recollections, however, is of the woman she met 
while making one of her countless personal appearances at Saks. ``She 
was a call girl,'' the designer said, ``She told me that it was such 
a good dress for walking in and out of the Regency hotel.'' ``But 
that was 20 years ago,'' Ms. Von Furstenberg added resignedly. ``We 
certainly are much squarer than that now.''
