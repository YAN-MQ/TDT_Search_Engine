There has been a potentially major development in Paula Jones' sexual 
harassment case against the president. In Washington, tomorrow, she 
will be given a check for $1 million from abe hirsch feld in hopes 
that it might lead to a settlement between Paula Jones and the president. 
ABC's Jackie Judd is joining us tonight. This guy presumably has nothing 
to do with thisase. A few weeks ago, Charlie, abe Hirsch feld came 
apparently out of nowhere and said I will give Paula Jones $1 million 
if it helps settle her sexual harassment lawsuit against the president. 
The last offer that Jones' lawyers then made to the president's attorneys 
was for $2 million, $1 million of which would come from Hirsch feld. 
It was a nonstarter. The president' attorneys made it clear they didn't 
want to be linked with hirshfeld's money. By getting hirshfeld's money 
up front, Jones' lawyers are clearly hoping this could restart significant 
meaningful talks with the president's attorneys, in which they discuss 
only what money the president might pay jones. I talked to Bob Bennett, 
the president's attorney tonight. He says he knows nothing about this 
deal and he is treating it very cautiously. By the way, if there is 
no eventual settlement with the president, Jones would have to give 
hirshfeld back the $1 million. All right. Jackie Judd in Washington. 
Thanks very much for those details.
