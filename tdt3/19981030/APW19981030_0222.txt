The chief engineer of a regional energy company was among the hostages 
freed during a crackdown on kidnappers in breakaway Chechnya, a news 
agency reported Friday. Valery Molsky, chief engineer of the Ingushenergo 
company, was kidnapped in Ingushetia on June 23 and taken to neighboring 
Chechnya, ITAR-Tass said. he was freed Thursday. The kidnappings and 
other crimes that have been rampant in Chechnya since the end of its 
1994-96 war with Russia often spill over into neighboring regions. 
Police said a powerful explosive device was found and defused Thursday 
night in Dagestan, which also borders Chechnya. ITAR-Tass said it 
was found in an abandoned house near a Russian border guards' office. 
Chechen authorities recently launched a crackdown on hostage-takings. 
They say about 100 people are held, including several foreigners.
