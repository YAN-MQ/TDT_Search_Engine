Dutch striker Pierre van Hooijdonk returned under tight security Friday 
to England's Nottingham Forest, three months after he walked away 
from the Premier League Club claiming it lacked ambition. Van Hooijdonk, 
who scored 34 goals last season and helped Forest gain promotion to 
the Premier League, was escorted by a dozen security guards at the 
City Ground as he was rushed into a meeting with manager Dave Bassett. 
He then joined his teammates for a light workout. Bassett has admitted 
being unhappy with Van Hooijdonk's return and said he will attempt 
to sell him on the transfer market. Van Hooijdonk, saying ``I am a 
Forest player again,'' hopes to be playing soon. ``I am happy it is 
all over,'' he said. ``I spoke to the players and the manager and 
what was said should stay in the dressing room. The atmosphere was 
OK.'' ``We spoke about things that happened and came to the conclusion 
that we have to get on with playing for Forest,'' he added. People 
say things and you have to get on with it. I am a professional... 
Hopefully I will be playing again soon. Van Hooijdonk, who helped 
the Netherlands to a fourth place at the World Cup in France, was 
placed on the transfer list three months ago when he refused to rejoin 
the club during summer training. But there were no takers for the 
8-million pound (dlrs 13.4 million) asking price, leaving Van Hooijdonk 
to train with his former Dutch club NAC Breda. His refusal to rejoin 
the club angered many Nottingham Forest fans, who view him as one 
in a long line of foreign stars in the country who have not always 
shown loyalty to their English sides. But with Forest lying three 
points from the bottom of the league table, the fans may be willing 
to forgive Van Hooijdonk if he can score goals. ``He has proved his 
point,'' 23-year-old fan David Vaughan said. ``He reckoned the team 
was not good enough and it isn't. If he comes back and gets the goals 
to take us up the table then it's worth it.''
