Prime Minister Jerzy Buzek on Friday rejected opposition calls to 
fire some ministers in his Solidarity-led government, but he left 
open the door for changes next year. Buzek, who took office last Oct. 
31, portrayed his side's showing in local elections this month as 
support for his reforms in administration, health care, the pension 
system and education. The Solidarity bloc had the best showing of 
the national parties in voting for local councils. ``You don't introduce 
changes at a time when you can say that the government has won the 
elections and its popularity has risen,'' Buzek said in an interview 
with the state news agency PAP. But he said the Cabinet will be revamped 
under a Western-style administrative reform that will shift some powers 
to the local councils on Jan. 1. He did not elaborate. He was addressing 
months of speculation that some of his ministers would go, following 
criticism from the opposition. Among those most frequently criticized 
is Treasury Minister Emil Wasacz, whom the leftist opposition accuses 
of selling state enterprises too cheaply.
