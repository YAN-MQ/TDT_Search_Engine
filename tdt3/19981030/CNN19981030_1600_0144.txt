The sights of perth, Australia, once again distracted Glenn from his 
mission. Lights were turned on all over the city to salute Glenn and 
the "discovery" crew as they flew over at an altitude of 340 miles. 
The citizens of perth did the same thing 36 years ago when Glenn flew 
over in friendship seven. Glenn says the city looks even more beautiful 
this time. This is "discovery," this is John. We got a really good 
view. There is a little break in the clouds right there. We got a 
good view of perth, a nice glow and spread out. And it's been a long 
time ago, I looked at the same thing from a little lower altitude, 
but it looks beautiful up here. And you can pass that along to the 
people of perth. We send our best regards.
