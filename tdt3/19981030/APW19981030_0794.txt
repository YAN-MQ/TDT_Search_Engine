Prime Minister Nawaz Sharif on Friday dismissed the southern Sindh 
provincial legislature and imposed federal rule to try to stop the 
relentless bloodletting terrorizing the country's largest city of 
Karachi. The decision to dismiss the Sindh provincial Parliament comes 
after a fallout between Sharif's Pakistan Muslim League and his coalition 
partners in Sindh, the Muttaheda Qami Movement, over the killing last 
week of a prominent philanthropist. ``The killing and terrorism has 
paralyzed normal life,'' Sharif told the nation in a televised speech. 
On Wednesday, Sharif warned the MQM that the coalition would split 
unless they handed over the killers of Hakim Said, a well-known Karachi 
physician gunned down in the violent port city. The next day, the 
MQM withdrew from the coalition government to protest Sharif's demands. 
Sharif ordered governor's rule in southern Sindh province, which effectively 
means the province will be ruled by Sharif's government. Orders from 
Islamabad will be carried out by the Sindh governor, a retired general 
named Moinuddin Haider. The 78-year-old Said was opposed to the MQM 
and the relentless violence that has wracked Karachi for the past 
year, during which time rival factions of the MQM have been waging 
a bitter war for control of the city. The MQM split into rival groups 
several years ago and in recent months there feud has become increasingly 
violent. More than 1,000 people have been killed in the rivalry _ 
many of them innocent civilians.
