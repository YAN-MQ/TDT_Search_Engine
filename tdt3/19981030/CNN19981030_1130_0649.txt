First, this edition of "your health." For years, women who underwent 
bypass surgery had a death rate two and a half times that of men. 
Now, the gender gap has closed. New research in the American heart 
association's journal "circulation" finds no difference between men 
and women in deaths while hospitalized for bypass surgery or angioplasty. 
And the new study shows no gender difference at five years after the 
two major heart operations. This despite the fact most of the women 
studied were older and sicker than the men. And some of this benefit 
we see now may be a combination of our increased awareness of heart 
disease in women and improved technology in medicine and overall improvement 
in care of our patients. Doctors now realize heart disease effects 
women as well as men, and just like men, women are learning they have 
to make heart-healthy lifestyle changes. Experts say more women should 
be able to count on a full recovery after heart surgery, thanks to 
better detection of heart disease in women, advanced surgical techniques 
and improved technology. For more health news online, log on to CNN.com/health.
