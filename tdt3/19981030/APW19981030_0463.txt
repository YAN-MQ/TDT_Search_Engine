Queen Beatrix visited flooded northern provinces Friday, offering 
support to Dutch farmers and relief workers fighting to control damage 
to waterlogged fields and villages. After days of torrential rains, 
rescue workers managed to stabilize dikes holding back rising waters 
in the mainly agricultural provinces of Groningen, Drenthe and Flevoland. 
The threat of widespread flooding on the scale that prompted the evacuations 
of up to 250,000 people in 1995 appeared to have eased. But more rain 
was forecast for the weekend, adding anxiety as the Dutch struggled 
to bear up under some of the highest rainfall in three decades. Local 
governments and farmers were assessing the damage to crops and villages. 
Dutch television showed people sloshing around in hip boots in their 
homes and preparing meals in kitchens flooded with a foot (30 centimeters) 
of water. On Friday, Royal Dutch Air Force planes flew photo reconnaissance 
missions over the flooded region to monitor the situation. ``There 
is huge damage to Dutch agriculture,'' said Jack Luiten, spokesman 
for the National Farmers Union. Flood damage was estimated at 250 
million guilders (dlrs 140 million). The flooded lands have caused 
a grave situation for Dutch potato farmers, who have lost up to 60 
percent of their crop, Luiten said. In the province of Drenthe, where 
potatoes comprise three-quarters of the local economy, the flooding 
has dealt a catastrophic blow to the livelihoods of many people. ``There 
is great damage,'' said Harma Barelds of the provincial government. 
``All the potatoes will be destroyed after this rain.'' Farmers were 
hoping the queen's visit Friday would lead to financial aid from the 
government. The Dutch parliament was discussing compensation for farmers 
who have lost crops to the flooding. Prime Minister Wim Kok, Defense 
Minister Frank de Grave and other officials also have toured the area. 
Though the Dutch must constantly battle with nature for their low-lying 
land reclaimed from the sea, the recent storms have caused the most 
damage to agriculture in this decade, he added. In the northernmost 
province of Groningen, roads were closed from flooding, and a bungalow 
park vacation area was evacuated close to the village of Zoutkamp, 
said Groningen police press officer Reinder Klei. Five hundred soldiers 
and engineers were deployed to Groningen and Drenthe earlier this 
week to shore up soggy dikes weakened by rain-swollen canals and rivers. 
Officials said Friday that emergency equipment was being kept on standby 
at a regional air base and that two barracks were ready in case people 
needed to be evacuated.
