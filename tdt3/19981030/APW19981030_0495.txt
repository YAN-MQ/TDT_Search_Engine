Turkey's top general said Friday that the nation must be ``vigilant 
and on guard'' against radical Islam and Kurdish separatism. Armed 
forces chief Gen. Huseyin Kivrikoglu's declaration, published in the 
Sabah newspaper, came as a clear indication that the powerful military 
was as intent as ever to stand firm against what it has termed two 
main threats to Turkey. ``We are forced, as a nation, to be vigilant 
and on guard against the backward-looking and the separatists that 
have openly declared war on the republic and its values,'' Kivrikoglu 
said in his first comments on the issue since taking his post in August. 
They came a day after a hijacker commandeered a plane apparently to 
protest a government crackdown on Kurdish rebels, Turkish special 
forces stormed the Turkish Airlines plane early Friday and killed 
the hijacker. The incident marred nationwide celebrations marking 
the 75th anniversary of the republic. The staunchly pro-secular army 
plays a powerful role in this predominantly Muslim society and has 
taken over power three times since 1960. Last year it pressured Turkey's 
first Islamic-led government out of power for anti-secular activity. 
The high court subsequently ordered the Islamic party disbanded and 
its leaders banned from politics for five years. The Kurdish rebels 
are waging a war for an autonomous state in southeastern Turkey. Nearly 
37,000 people have died in the conflict since 1984.
