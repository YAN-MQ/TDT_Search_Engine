President Clinton appealed to African-American ministers Friday to 
urge their parishioners to turn out and vote as part of a campaign 
to mobilize some of his most loyal supporters in the closing days 
of the election season. Appearing before about 100 black clergy at 
a hotel near Kennedy International Airport in Queens, Clinton told 
the ministers, ``This election is not an ordinary election, folks.'' 
He continued, ``These are not ordinary times. There are huge fights 
left out there to fight. Huge. And we need you.'' Clinton plans to 
return to the theme on Sunday morning at an African-American Baptist 
church in Baltimore, and again on Monday in several radio and television 
broadcasts from the White House. He plans to appear on the nationally 
syndicated Tom Joyner radio show on a roundtable with Kweisi Mfume 
of the NAACP, the poet Maya Angelou and the actress Cicely Tyson. 
He also is scheduled to appear on the Tavis Smiley program on Black 
Entertainment Television. African-Americans have overwhelmingly supported 
the president in his two election campaigns and have stood by him 
during the Lewinsky scandal this year. In an appearance with Charles 
E. Schumer, a Senate candidate from Brooklyn, N.Y., Clinton told the 
ministers Friday that they would see thousands of parishioners in 
their churches on Sunday and he implored them to urge their followers 
to vote on Tuesday. He said he knew it was a ``hassle'' for many voters 
to take time out from a work day to go vote. He said that Republicans 
were counting on low turnout among black voters, a generally reliable 
Democratic constituency. ``Our adversaries think a whole bunch of 
us will stay home,'' Clinton told the ministers, and urged them to 
thwart that tactic by warning their parishioners of the effects of 
larger Republican majorities in Congress. ``Just remember,'' Clinton 
said, ``everyone who doesn't show can't gripe on Wednesday morning.'' 
Schumer accompanied Clinton at the events with senior citizens and 
the ministers, rare instances of the president appearing with a candidate 
in a setting that was not a fund-raiser. This political season, Clinton 
has attended very few candidate rallies, in part to shield the candidates 
from any association with the Lewinsky scandal. Clinton told the ministers 
and senior citizens that it was important to elect Democrats to the 
Senate and House of Representatives to bring ``balance'' to Congress 
and to pass legislation on health care, tobacco and school construction. 
The appeal is a mirror image of Republican advertisements, which urge 
voters to ``balance'' the liberal leanings of the president with larger 
Republican majorities in Congress. Clinton warned the seniors at the 
Saint Sebastian Parish Center in Queens that Republicans were threatening 
the solvency of Social Security by diverting some of the federal budget 
surpluses to tax cuts or new spending programs. He assured them that 
their Social Security payments were safe, but warned that he could 
not guarantee benefits for their children or grandchildren unless 
the retirement program's trust fund was propped up. ``If we say, `well, 
heck, we waited 29 years for this surplus, let's take the money and 
run, let's have a little fun, give me a tax cut, give me a new program, 
give me this, give me that' before we know whether we need this money 
to save Social Security,'' Clinton said, ``and we miss this opportunity, 
then what's going to happen?'' Clinton also sought to capitalize on 
the Middle East peace agreement concluded last week and on the return 
to space of Sen. John Glenn on Thursday. ``If you felt good about 
the Middle East peace talks, if you felt good when John Glenn went 
up into space,'' Clinton told the black pastors, ``if you feel in 
your heart that you are a part of my presidency, then I ask you just 
one thing: Realize this is an important election.'' He then asked 
them to bring as many people as they could to the polls on Tuesday.
