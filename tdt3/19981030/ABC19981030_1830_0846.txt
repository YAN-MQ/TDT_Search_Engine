Across the southwestern U.S. tonight, a killer has invaded. Killer 
bees are more prevalent this year than ever before. They're slightly 
smaller than other honey bees, but much more aggressive. They'll nest 
anywhere, and attack ferociously to defend their home. Tonight, the 
killer bees are advancing toward Los Angeles. Here's ABC's Brian Rooney. 
For years, it was a joke, "the killer bees are coming." Now, they're 
here, a no one is laughing. Every day in the Tucson area, The drawer 
is packed with honey comb. Teams from the aaa bee-removal service 
hurry from one spot to another, exterminating swarms of killer bees 
before someone stumbles on them, like a Phoenix man who survived hundreds 
of stings. I've never seen anybody with that many bees on their face. 
I mean, you really cannot tell where his eyes or anything was. They 
were inside his mouth, inside his nose. Exterminators find bees hanging 
from trees, packed into rafters, lining old tires and hiding under 
a utility access port. Say good night, boys, the party's over. 98% 
of the colonies of honey bees here in southern Arizona are africanized. 
Africanized bees, nicknamed killer bees, are a vicious breed, many 
meaner than the European bee most people know. When threatened, killer 
bees chase and sting a victim as far as a mile from their hive. Last 
week, killer bees attacked an elderly couple just inside E California 
border. They were stinging neighbors 200 yards on either side of the 
immediate house. Africanized bees were brought to Brazil in 1956 to 
breed honey bees for a hot climate. They escaped. And since then, 
have migrated north 200 or 300 miles a year. Now they are approaching 
the major population centers of San Diego and Los angeles, where the 
report of a bee's nest brings out men in protective suits. So far, 
laboratory examinations have not found any killer bees in Los angeles. 
But eventually, they will. We got a good percentage of the hive. Until 
everyone understands how to treat them and how to observe and how 
to stay away from them and what to do, there's going to be a danger 
period. But just the thought of living with these bees has a sting 
to it. Brian Rooney, ABC News, Los Angeles.
