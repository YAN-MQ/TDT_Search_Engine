The stocky, bald, bearded man in tie and shirt-sleeves recently poked 
his head into the doorway of the small gym in the basement of Alumni 
Hall on the St. John's University campus. For a few minutes he watched 
several members of the basketball team working out in an array of 
gym-rat garb with a conditioning coach. Then he called one of the 
players over to him, a senior named Tyrone Grant. The two spoke quietly. 
``Make sure he takes the earring off,'' said Mike Jarvis, the new 
head coach of the Red Storm. He was referring to a younger player 
in the conditioning group. ``We don't wear earrings during work days,'' 
he told Grant, his starting center. ``We have to pay attention to 
the little things, then the big things will happen. Now that you're 
a captain I want you to be really observant. If you can handle stuff 
like that for me, I can handle the other stuff.'' ``OK, coach,'' said 
Grant, who had been voted captain by his fellow players the previous 
week. ``I understand.'' And he returned to his sweat, and to counsel 
the other player. The ``other stuff'' Jarvis will handle is giving 
his players a sense of what they need to do if they wish to succeed 
once out of school. But, unquestionably and perhaps unfortunately, 
the foundation for the ``other stuff'' is to win basketball games. 
St. John's opens its season on Nov. 16 against North Carolina-Asheville 
in the Chase Preseason NIT at Alumni Hall. In the pressure of Division 
I hoops, a billion-dollar industry, the goal is win first and, if 
time and energy permit, build character afterward. If you do not win 
games, the coaches understand, you will not be around long enough 
to inculcate anything in anyone. But what does an earring removed 
or left sparkling on a left lobe have to do with basketball? ``A lot 
of companies in America would be resistant to hiring a guy wearing 
an earring,'' Jarvis said. ``It's still not acceptable to a lot of 
people. There's a few things in dress and demeanor that may not be 
part of the mainstream, and I tell my players _ I've been telling 
them for years _ that you have to do a lot of things before you can 
be yourself. ``I tell them Michael Jordan is the perfect example. 
It wasn't until about the last three years _ until he became a corporation 
_ that he wore something as simple as an earring. But I tell them, 
not when he's playing. Basketball is business, not fashion. ``You 
have to get the job, and get it done, before you can ever hope to 
one day take over the company and be in a position to make the rules. 
When that happens, you can wear an earring or anything else you want. 
I try to prepare the players for life after basketball, through the 
realities of life. And I feel I can do it through lessons learned 
in basketball. That's what I know. That's my field.'' Jarvis was speaking 
before official practice for the season began week before last. The 
setting was his nicely appointed office in Alumni Hall, in an area 
in which Lou Carnesecca guided the St. John's basketball fortunes 
for 24 years, and where Brian Mahoney and Fran Fraschilla had relatively 
brief coaching careers of four and two seasons, respectively. Jarvis, 
53, came from George Washington University. He took over a team that 
had gone 1-29 two seasons before he became head coach there, in 1990, 
and in his first season took George Washington to the Atlantic 10 
final and the National Invitation Tournament. He compiled a 152-90 
record in eight seasons at George Washington, with four visits to 
the NCAA tournament, reaching the Sweet 16 in 1993. He has never had 
a losing record as a coach, winning at Rindge and Latin High School 
in Cambridge, Mass., and for five seasons at Boston University. When 
Jarvis had watched the handful of St. John's players going through 
strengthening drills, he noted their size. ``We're going to be small,'' 
he said. ``We'll be about 6-8 across the front line, with Tyrone our 
center at about 6-8. We're not big, we're not fast _ I mean, we're 
not slow, but I don't consider these guys to be jets, by no means 
_ so we have to be smart.'' When the team's official practice sessions 
began on Oct. 17, the players experienced this: ``A lot of running 
and pressing and trapping,'' said Lavor Postell, a junior who is the 
starting small forward. ``We didn't do nearly as much last year because 
we were a bigger team. This year, we're a lot smaller, and we understand 
the need for the change.'' As for the coaching style of Jarvis, Postell 
added: ``He came in with a good rep from GW, as both strong and gentle, 
and he's proved a combination of both. I like the patience he's shown. 
We've got these new drills, and when you mess up, he doesn't yell. 
He says, `Look fellas, this is the way to do it.' Calm and cool. He's 
never lost his cool.'' Grant recalled one particular shot he took 
in a recent practice. ``I went for the follow-up rebound, but I guess 
not as strong as I should have,'' he said. ``Coach Jarvis stopped 
practice. `You gotta go hard, HARD, for the ball,' he told me. I wasn't 
embarrassed because the way he said it was in a way that he meant 
to help me in the long run. So I appreciated it.'' When it was mentioned 
that his team lost two important players from last season _ Felipe 
Lopez and Zendon Hamilton _ Jarvis said: ``I'm new. I haven't lost 
anybody. I don't know how much I'm losing. I just concentrate on what 
we have.'' As for a ``new'' player such as Erick Barkley, a 6-foot-1-inch 
guard from Queens, Jarvis added: ``I don't think it's a secret that 
we have a very fine basketball player in Erick Barkley. Obviously, 
I don't consider him a freshman. He's been playing against the best 
his whole life, and he spent a year in prep school. He's beyond his 
years. He's just a great basketball player, no flash and glitter, 
he just gets it done.'' St. John's had a 22-10 record last season 
under Fraschilla, who was more or less asked to leave after his second 
season there because of behavior that made the St. John's brass apoplectic. 
Fraschilla seemed to be openly seeking another job. The coaching styles 
of Fraschilla and Jarvis are at opposite poles. Fraschilla was a ranter, 
Jarvis is relatively reserved. One of the concerns of people at St. 
John's about Jarvis was that he, too, might not be long for the job, 
even at a reported salary of around $700,000 a year for seven years. 
``I was at George Washington for eight years and I never recruited 
anyone without telling him that if another opportunity presented itself 
to me, I'd have to consider it,'' Jarvis said. ``We are always trying 
to improve ourselves. The important thing is to be honest with the 
people you're dealing with. The fact is, in life, anything can happen. 
And in this business, there is no such thing as forever.'' Jarvis 
is open about his dream of one day coaching in the National Basketball 
Association. He grew up in Cambridge, where, he said, ``I was the 
only kid I knew of who fell asleep keeping count of Bill Russell's 
rebounds.'' Jarvis was interviewed in 1995 for the Celtics' coaching 
job by the general manager, M.L. Carr, who eventually gave the job 
to M.L. Carr. ``I'd be happy to stay at St. John's forever,'' Jarvis 
said. ``But the only way I would ever be considered for another job 
is if I made the people at St. John's happy. That is, if I did a great 
job here. And that's what I intend to do.''
