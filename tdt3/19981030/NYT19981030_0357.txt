The global picture may be unsettling, but Warren Buffett, whose Berkshire 
Hathaway Inc. controls about 200 million shares of Coca-Cola, says 
Coke's business will keep rolling along. ``In given countries at given 
times there will be hiccups,'' Buffett, a Coca-Cola director since 
1989, said in a telephone interview Thursday from his office in Omaha, 
Neb. ``But that doesn't take your eye off where you want to be 10 
or 15 years from now, which is to have everybody drinking nothing 
but Coke.'' A big part of Buffett's investing strategy is to find 
corporate executives in whom he has deep faith and then stick by them 
for the long haul. ``The top guy does set the tone for the way the 
people down the chain behave,'' Buffett said. ``If the top guy is 
thinking about his golf game, the other guys start thinking about 
their golf game.'' That isn't a problem at Coke. Buffett was a big 
believer in Roberto Goizueta, the company's late chief executive, 
and he says he believes in Goizueta's successor, M. Douglas Ivester. 
``I've seen him in action a long time, and he's got a burning passion 
about the company,'' Buffett said. ``It's a mission with him. He can't 
control exchange rates, and he can't control the domestic economy 
of a country. But if you keep pouring it on, people are always going 
to get thirsty, and there are always going to be more people who want 
to buy your product.'' Coke's pricing, near ubiquitous availability 
and generally positive image all work in the company's favor, too, 
Buffett said. Indeed, Buffett and Ivester have teamed up to do their 
part on the ubiquity front. Not long ago, Buffett went out with his 
grandson for pizza at an Omaha restaurant and discovered that the 
place served Pepsi, not Coke. ``I mentioned it to Atlanta, and World 
War III broke out,'' Buffett said. ``They're now serving Coke.'' He 
added, ``I don't think Doug sleeps at night if that one pizza parlor 
in Omaha isn't selling Coke.''
