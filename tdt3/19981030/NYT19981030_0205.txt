It was a moment of national nostalgia. Cynicism was put on hold for 
the five minutes it took the spacecraft to vanish from our television 
screens. We prayed as we watched CNN last Thursday, remembering the 
last time so many took such interest in a NASA launch. This one, thank 
heaven, seemed to work. If you remember John Glenn's historic 1962 
Mercury flight _ or if, like me, you took Instamatic pictures of the 
television that day in 1969 when man first walked on the moon _ you 
felt like a kid again last week. That was when the astronaut-turned-senator-turned-astronaut 
returned to space aboard the shuttle Discovery at age 77. It was a 
feel-good media event. Add the enthusiasm for Glenn's latest mission 
to the Emmy Award recently heaped upon the HBO miniseries ``From the 
Earth to the Moon'' and one thing is clear: space age nostalgia runs 
deep among baby boomers. For us, the space program of old promised 
not only real-life outer-space adventures but also the hope of a brave 
new world back home _ flying cars, plastic houses, Tang. Someday soon, 
it was all going to be ours. In the 1960s, NASA was the coolest of 
the cool, fueling the imaginations of young Americans with each Apollo 
mission. ``The great thing about the space program in those days was, 
it kept us dreaming about the future, which had a very salutary effect 
in maintaining national sanity,'' Walter Cronkite noted in last week's 
TV Guide. Today we have St. John's wort for that, and a much bleaker 
picture of what lies ahead. Today when we imagine the future, we think 
of ``Bladerunner'' and ``Planet of the Apes,'' not the 1963-64 World's 
Fair and the Carousel of Progress. ``One thing I miss,'' Andy Warhol 
wrote in his 1985 photo journal ``America,'' ``is the time when America 
had big dreams about the future. Every year there'd be a new scientific 
discovery or new invention and everyone would think the future was 
going to be even more wonderful than ever. Now it seems like nobody 
has big hopes for the future. We all seem to think that it's going 
to be just like it is now, only worse.'' On Los Angeles area highways, 
that is especially true, even when traffic is running smoothly. Billboards 
for Disneyland along the roadsides proclaim ``The Future Is Now'' 
as they hype a re-imagined Tomorrowland. The amusement park's future-focused 
area reopened last May after some serious remodeling. Gone are the 
stark whiteness of modernism and the cleanness of the late '50s futurism 
that graced the original Tomorrowland. In its place are edible flora, 
a refurbished rocket ride and a color scheme that leans more toward 
rusty bronze. The formidable Space Mountain, a cone-shaped structure 
that once gleamed as the icy crown jewel on the Disneyland-scape, 
now looks like a giant tarnished brooch. It is all supposed to be 
very Jules Verne and H.G. Wells, but it feels instead like an apology 
for the naive hope of the original. Meanwhile in Las Vegas, a year-old 
tourist attraction called ``Star Trek: the Experience'' presents a 
future with more troubles than Tribbles. Visitors to this science-fiction 
museum (and an adjoining space-themed casino) not only see props and 
costumes from the wildly successful television and movie franchise, 
but can also read their way through a so-called history of the future. 
An incredibly detailed timeline interweaves the mythology of all the 
many permutations of ``Star Trek.'' Most glaringly, it imagines as 
the great turning point in the history of humankind a Third World 
War that nearly obliterates all life on Earth. If that doesn't inspire 
nausea, the shuttlecraft flight simulator you ride after you are done 
reading everything will. In contrast, the vision of the future provided 
by the old Tomorrowland (and the early days of NASA) was one of speed 
and style; minimalism would remove the gewgaws of the past so we would 
be ready (and dressed) for anything. It made the future seem fun, 
but now we know too much to believe that that could be true. Likewise, 
the space age excesses of ``Velvet Goldmine,'' Todd Haynes' filmic 
paean to the glam-rock era of the early 1970s, leave one with a sense 
of loss and longing not only for glitter but for the future. The past's 
love affair with tomorrow is as dead as Ziggy Stardust. Aliens aren't 
fabulous bisexuals with snow-white tans and platform boots anymore; 
they're the body-snatching creatures of ``The X-Files.'' Scully and 
Mulder's big-screen debut wasn't subtitled ``Fight the Future'' for 
nothing. The future we imagined when John Glenn first went up 36 years 
ago was so different from what we knew that we could never hope to 
achieve it. Not by the millennium anyway. Our lives have changed radically 
since the heyday of the space age, but not in the revolutionary way 
we had hoped. Even with an iMac on your desk and a shiny silver Volkswagen 
in your garage, you're not George Jetson. The future is now, but the 
song we are singing isn't David Bowie's ``Starman.'' It's Peggy Lee's 
``Is That All There Is?''
