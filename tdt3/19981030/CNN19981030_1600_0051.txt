President Clinton says in spite of the worldwide economic turmoil, 
the U.S. economy remains the strongest in a generation. At the White 
House today, he pointed to the Gross domestic product, which rose 
3.3% in the third quarter of this year. In London, the G7 nations 
endorsed Mr. Clinton's proposal to allow the international monetary 
fund to speed emergency loans to countries strapped for cash. President 
Clinton says it's important nations work together to Ward off a Global 
financial crisis. If America's economy is to continue to grow, the 
economies of our trading partners must continue to grow. In a larger 
sense, if America's Devotion to freedom and openness is to be met 
with success, we must put a human face on the global economy for the 
most vulnerable people in the emerging countries when they face hard 
times. More on the U.S. economy in "Dollars & Sense" at 16 minutes 
past the hour.
