Word tonight of a giant step toward a settlement of the Paula Jones 
sexual harassment case against President Clinton with the help of 
a third party writing a big check. Here's NBC's Lisa Myers. Sources 
close to Jones say that tomorrow, in Washington, Jones is to receive 
a $1 million check, not from the president. But from someone not even 
involved in the case, eccentric New York developer abe hirschfeld. 
Hirschfeld says the country needs this nightmare to be over. I'm doing 
it because I like to have peace and harmony. Then, sources say Jones' 
lawyers will resume negotiating a Separate deal with the president 
to actually settle the case. The president already has offered $700,000. 
Jones wants $1 million. Both sides say they want a settlement. If 
for some reason there is no deal with the president, sources say Jones 
would have to return the money to hirschfeld. I think that Mr. hirschfeld 
has been extremely generous. You know, what a wonderful American to 
do this for someone who's gone through as much as Paula has. The offer 
has been on the table for a month. They hope that by accepting the 
money now and then negotiating with the president later, the president 
will not be seen as being tide to hirshfeld. They are hopeful that 
she can reach a settlement with the president. But the president's 
lawyer, Bob Bennett, reacted cautiously. He previously has said that 
if hirschfeld's money is in anyway linked to the president, the president 
is likely to walk. Lisa Myers, NBC news, Washington.
