The St. Louis Cardinals groundskeeper who scooped up Mark McGwire's 
62nd home run ball is getting another reward. Tim forneris turned 
down the $1 million bounty on the ball when he gave it to McGwire. 
Thursday, Chrysler presented forneris with a brand-new minivan. He 
says he plans to visit every ballpark in the country. And now he can 
go in style.
