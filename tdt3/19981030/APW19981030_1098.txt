Eritrea will return a Red Sea island to Yemen on Sunday in compliance 
with a World Court ruling, Yemen's foreign minister said here Friday. 
``The island of Greater Hanish will be retuned to Yemen on Nov. 1,'' 
Foreign Minister Abdul-Kader Bajammal told reporters on arrival in 
Cairo. ``Relations with Eritrea will become as good as they used to 
be.'' Yemen and Eritrea fought a battle over three Red Sea islands 
in December 1995. Eritrea captured Greater Hanish island, while Yemen 
retained control of Lesser Hanish and Zuqar. On Oct. 9 the World Court 
awarded all three islands to Yemen and stipulated that its decision 
should be complied with in 90 days. Bajammal also said that Eitrean 
President Isaias Afwerki will travel to the southern Yemeni city of 
Aden on Wednesday for talks with Yemeni President Ali Abdullah Saleh. 
Bajammal, who began his three-day visit by talks with his Egyptian 
counterpart, will raise Yemen's border conflict with Saudi Arabia 
in his talks with Egyptian President Hosni Mubarak and Arab League 
Secretary-General Esmat Abdel-Meguid, a Yemeni government official 
told The Associated Press in San`a. Yemen has long contested Saudi 
Arabia's claim to parts of the Empty Quarter, a vast desert on the 
Arabia peninsula with potentially lucrative oil fields. Yemeni authorities 
are preparing to mark Eritrea's hand over of Greater Hanish with celebrations 
on the island on Sunday, the official said on condition of anonymity. 
The Yemeni government has said it wishes to restore full diplomatic 
relations with Eritrea and resume air services between the two countries.
