Efforts to end the regular bouts of war that plague West Africa have 
been hampered by fighting in Guinea-Bissau, Nigeria's military ruler 
said Friday at a summit of regional leaders, but said the opposing 
sides were continuing their negotiations. The five-month Guinea-Bissau 
civil war ``is a serious setback to our effort aimed at bringing lasting 
peace to the West African sub-region,'' Gen. Abdulsalami Abubakar 
told leaders. He added, however, that President Joao Bernardo Vieira 
and the rebel leader, former army chief of staff Brig. Ansumane Mane, 
were continuing negotiations Friday in Abuja. On Thursday, Mane and 
Vieira flew to the tiny West African nation of Gambia where they embraced 
before beginning their first face-to-face talks on ending the fighting, 
Portuguese news reports said. The talks continued well into Thursday 
night before the men headed to Nigeria. The two-day summit, of the 
16-member Economic Community of West African States, or ECOWAS, also 
includes top officials from Ghana, Benin, Togo, Ivory Coast, Sierra 
Leone, Liberia, Mali, Niger and Senegal. President Nelson Mandela 
of South Africa, who attended the Friday meetings as an observer, 
also warned that the crisis in Congo threatens peace throughout the 
continent. ``The conflict in the Democratic Republic of Congo remains 
a burning ember of political instability in our region, one which 
could pose a serious threat to the African continent,'' Mandela said, 
calling for an immediate cease-fire and a withdrawal of all foreign 
troops. Since taking up arms Aug. 2, the Congolese rebels have made 
steady advances in eastern Congo but were defeated outside the capital, 
Kinshasa, by President Laurent Kabila's allies from Zimbabwe, Angola 
and Namibia. Kabila has refused to negotiate with the rebels, accusing 
them of being the puppets of Rwanda and Uganda. Fighting began in 
Guinea-Bissau on June 7, with a coup attempt in the capital, Bissau, 
by Mane, who accuses Vieira of corruption. About half the impoverished 
country's population of 1 million has been displaced by the fighting. 
A cease-fire was declared July 26 but fighting broke out again 10 
days ago. The summit is also to delve into what Nigeria's planning 
minister, Rasheed Gbadamosi, called ``the precarious financial situation 
of the community.'' Membership dues for the group are about dlrs 40 
million overdue.
