Lawyers for the Raul Salinas de Gortari have appealed a Swiss decision 
to order the confiscation of dlrs 114.4 million as probable laundered 
drug money, his wife's Swiss attorney said Friday. The appeal will 
send the case of Salinas, brother of former Mexican President Carlos 
Salinas, to Switzerland's supreme court, the Federal Tribunal. Switzerland's 
federal prosecutor, Carla Del Ponte, last week ordered the confiscation 
of the money in accounts in Switzerland and Britain after a 2 1/2-year 
investigation of Raul Salinas. Del Ponte said she was ``very confident'' 
the supreme court would uphold the seizure if the order was appealed. 
The appeals contest the Swiss assertion that the money came from illegal 
sources and challenge the use of anonymous sources and witnesses in 
the Swiss case. Raul Salinas is in prison in central Mexico pending 
completion of trials in a political assassination and on a charge 
of illegal enrichment during his brother's 1988-1994 administration. 
In a letter written from his prison cell, he accused Swiss prosecutors 
of using questionable witnesses and exaggerating the size of his accounts. 
He repeated his denial of taking payoffs to ease drug shipments. Valentin 
Roschacher, the chief of Switzerland's antinarcotics police, said 
investigators concluded that Colombia's Medellin and Cali drug cartels 
as well as Mexican traffickers paid Raul Salinas at least dlrs 500 
million over 10 years to protect drug shipments through Mexico. The 
Swiss dropped their own money laundering case against Raul Salinas, 
saying it was no longer necessary as Mexican authorities have started 
their own proceedings. They said they dropped the case against his 
wife, Paulina Castanon, and her brother, Antonio, because their alleged 
involvement in drug offenses in Mexico and money laundering charges 
in Sweden could not be proven. Swiss authorities arrested the two 
in 1995 after they allegedly tried to withdraw money from a Geneva 
account of Raul Salinas. The siblings were released four weeks later, 
when Swiss authorities said they had been cooperative and had played 
only a secondary role in the overall case.
