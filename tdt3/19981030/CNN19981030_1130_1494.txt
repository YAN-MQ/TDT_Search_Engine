For a decade and a half now, minivans have been a mainstay of family 
outings and little-league teams. Ed Garsten reviews the legacy of 
the Cadillac of carpools. On November 2nd, 1983, the first of the 
newfangled contraptions the designers at Chrysler dreamed up rolled 
off the Windsor, Ontario, assembly line -- first, to loud applause, 
then, embarrassed laughter, as the executive in the back seat was 
stuck inside until the balky back door was yanked open. Nevertheless, 
then-chairman Lee Iacocca pronounced the minivan, "the vehicle of 
the future." -- Literally will force other manufacturers all over 
the world to come up quickly with their copycat version. He was right. 
As Chrysler celebrates the minivan's 15th birthday, every car company 
now sells one -- about 1.2 million a year industry-wide -- but none 
as many as chrysler, which holds 45% of the market. Indeed, the minivan 
came at a time when the venerable station wagon had a Real image problem. 
I promise to love, honor, obey -- and spend half my life in a station 
wagon. Well, there's no question that when the minivan came out, it 
was like a Stake in the heart of the station wagon market. The idea 
of a small on the outside, big on the inside kind of a utility vehicle 
was a winner. Still the vehicle of choice among so-called "soccer 
moms" and many families, minivan owners now are finding other uses. 
It fits my friends, my skis, my golf clubs. I can sleep in here. In 
the last five years or so, though, it looked as if the minivan market 
would begin to dry up as baby boomers started to age and become empty-nesters, 
trading in the old family buggy for roadsters or sport-utility vehicles. 
But minivan sales are now holding steady, thanks to baby boomers' 
grown-up babies who need to haul their families around, too. At 15 
and counting, the minivan just may be the auto industry's best trick 
yet. It's the Plymouth Voyager -- the magic wagon! Ed Garsten, CNN, 
Windsor, Ontario.
