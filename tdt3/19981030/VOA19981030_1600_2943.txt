Palestinian authorities have intensified the crackdown they launched 
on the Islamic resistance movement, Hamas, after the car bombing Thursday 
against Israelis in Gaza. Security forces say they have arrested more 
than a hundred Hamas activists and cut the telephone lines of the 
group's spiritual leader, Sheik Ahmed Yaseen, who is under house arrest. 
Palestinian leader Yasir Arafat met with his security chiefs Friday 
to discuss what steps to take next. Hamas has sharply criticized the 
crackdown as repressive. They accuse Mr. Arafat of trying to wipe 
out the group. We'll have more on that story and all the world's news 
at the top of the hour, universal time.
