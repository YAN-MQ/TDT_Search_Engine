The FBI is investigating biological weapons threats against several 
women's clinics in Indiana, Kentucky and Tennessee. Police evacuated 
and quarantined a Planned Parenthood clinic in Indianapolis today 
after an employee opened a letter claiming to contain anthrax bacteria. 
Police say they're analyzing the brown, powdery substance in the envelope. 
Twenty-nine people at the clinic were taken to a hospital and decontaminated 
after the threat was received. None of them showed any symptoms. Officials 
say similar letters were sent to clinics that performed abortions 
in Bloomington and New Albany, Indiana, Louisville, Kentucky and an 
unspecified city in Tennessee. This is NPR news from Washington.
