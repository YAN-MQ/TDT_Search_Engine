A national panel of scientists says over fishing is depleting the 
world's oceans. The report sustaining marine fisheries released by 
the National Academy of Sciences says 30 percent of the fish stock 
worldwide is no longer sustainable. Another 44 percent is being fished 
near that level. The report calls for a significant reduction in fishing 
and recommends adopting an ecosystem based approach to managing fisheries 
rather than putting catch limits on specific species. The report suggests 
assigning exclusive fishing rights or quotas to discourage over fishing 
and competition among fishermen.
