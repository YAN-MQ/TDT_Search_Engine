The second period of Thursday night's game between the New York Islanders 
and New Jersey Devils was delayed when hundreds of fans littered the 
Nassau Coliseum ice with squeezable foam ``stress pucks.'' Maybe they 
were stressing over Zigmund Palffy's holdout. After Thursday's developments, 
they were probably not alone. A few hours before the Islanders lost 
by 2-1 to the Devils on Thursday night, Palffy rejected the Islanders' 
latest proposal, which was made to him on Tuesday. Palffy's agent, 
Paul Kraus, said that a counterproposal would be submitted to the 
team on Friday. ``We're going to try and keep negotiating,'' Kraus 
said from his Edmonton office on Thursday. Asked if he was optimistic, 
Kraus, who declined to discuss the counterproposal, said: ``I don't 
know. My vibes have been off lately.'' Mike Milbury, the Islanders' 
coach and general manager, returned on Wednesday from Austria, where 
he met with Palffy, attempting to persuade the 27-year-old star right 
wing to accept the team's latest offer. The proposal, based on the 
contract signed by Edmonton's Doug Weight, was for $7.8 million over 
two years. It was loaded with incentives that could have increased 
the deal's value to more than $10 million. ``I went there to explain 
to Ziggy how I view the situation,'' Milbury said. ``I wanted him 
to be able to make an informed decision. Obviously I was talking from 
the organization's standpoint, but I was as reasonably objective as 
I could be.'' Milbury has said he does not want to trade Palffy because 
of what he would most likely get in return. The Islanders' general 
manager had discussions with Buffalo and Los Angeles recently, but 
Milbury was probably offered draft picks, minor league prospects and 
could-be stars, which is exactly what he has said he does not want 
in exchange for Palffy, who is a three-time 40-goal scorer. Both teams 
were without their top playmakers on Thursday night, the Islanders' 
Palffy and the Devils' unsigned defenseman, Scott Niedermayer. Still, 
the game was fast and featured many scoring chances for both sides. 
The Devils (4-4), who rebounded nicely from Wednesday's 4-0 loss to 
the Los Angeles Kings, got first-period goals from Bobby Holik and 
Dave Andreychuk for an early 2-0 lead. And goalie Martin Brodeur took 
it from there. ``You can't spot the Devils two goals,'' Milbury said. 
``They play well with the lead.'' Brodeur, who has struggled some 
this season, was outstanding in stopping 22 shots. Several of Brodeur's 
best saves were made in the third period as the Islanders (4-5) pressed 
to even the score. The Devils were out-shot by 23-20. Holik opened 
the scoring 3 minutes 59 seconds into the game, beating a screened 
Tommy Salo. Andreychuk inadvertently knocked in the Devils' second 
goal at 11:15. A pass from behind the net by Holik deflected off defenseman 
Rich Pilon's stick and hit Andreychuk, who was cutting to the net, 
in the chest. The second period was stopped 59 seconds before the 
end when fans threw the foam pucks, given to them before the game, 
onto the ice. The pucks came raining down after Jason Dawe scored 
at 19:00 for the Islanders, cutting the Devils' lead to 2-1. The situation 
forced the referee, Dave Jackson, to send the players to the locker 
room. The final minute of the second period was played before the 
third period. ``I didn't know they were fake at first,'' Dawe said. 
``I covered my face.''
