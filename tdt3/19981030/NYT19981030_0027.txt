Unexpected magic happened several minutes into ``Kaleidoscope Suite,'' 
presented by Murray Louis and Nikolais Dance on Wednesday night at 
the Joyce Theater. The curtain had risen on a stage filled with sleek 
bodies in silhouetted profile in intensely orange air, not quite human 
in crested helmets. As they moved slowly through the dance, their 
right legs were suddenly revealed to end in large, thin disks. ``Kaleidoscope 
Suite,'' three dances from a piece Alwin Nikolais created in 1956 
and added to in 1986, is full of such moments of visual wit and surprise, 
as is ``Nikolais Suite,'' a series of dances from the 1950s and 1960s 
that followed on the program. We have become used to visual spectacle, 
in a time of astonishing advances in cinematic technology when animated 
ants command the kind of attention once lavished exclusively on movie 
stars. It is possible to see the seeds of that in the two Nikolais 
pieces and his 1983 ``Video Games,'' created for the Public Theater 
production of ``Lenny and the Heartbreakers,'' and the 1985 ``Crucible,'' 
both of which were included in this homage to the choreographer, who 
died in 1993. The great pleasure of the imagery, particularly in ``Kaleidoscope 
Suite'' and ``Nikolais Suite,'' is the lack of attention it calls 
to itself. Nikolais sowed such surprises with the nonchalance of a 
magician, weaving them into a smooth flow of dance that never succumbed 
to the blandishments of high drama and the classical ballet. ``Disks'' 
plays deftly with our perceptions of shape and depth. The long white 
pole manipulated in ``Pole'' by Alberto del Saz and Kimberly Gibilisco, 
as solemnly purposeful and inscrutable as temple dancers, divides, 
joins and helps to define the two as moving bodies. Nikolais' dryly 
funny imagination runs riot in the ``Clothes'' section of ``Kaleidoscope 
Suite.'' He turns his dancers from moment to moment into swaying columns 
topped by brilliantly colored lampshade hats, hunched and scurrying 
acrobats whose unitards might have been designed by Picasso, and prancing 
creatures with scalloped breasts and genitals, one of whom becomes 
a tiny diva worthy of this near-operatic spectacle. How did Nikolais 
make the two shifting silver protoplasms ( del Saz and Peter Kyle) 
glow with such strange brilliance in ``Noumenon,'' so differently 
abstract from Martha Graham's emotion-driven women in stretch fabric? 
Small deft hands curl above totems that soften into lush blossoms 
when the three dancers (Ms. Gibilisco, Susan Pajak and Trista Redavid) 
recline at the end of the excerpt from ``Vaudeville of the Elements.'' 
The many-jointed, undulating arms of five men ( del Saz, Kyle, Tyrone 
Baker, Dennis Johnston and Adam Klotz) suggest much while looking, 
gloriously, like absolutely nothing but jointed arms in ``Mantis,'' 
from ``Imago.'' The suite (and the evening) ends on a note of luscious 
prettiness with ``Tensile Involvement,'' a dance of continuously changing 
cat's cradles of shimmering stretchy colored ribbons. The transforming 
shapes of ``Crucible'' eventually come to seem a little flat. And 
``Blank on Blank,'' the 1987 work that completed the program, never 
quite furnishes a theme for the dancers' street clothes to relate 
to. But the personable, intelligent dancers, who also included Pamela 
Levy-Arauz and Elizabeth Higgins, were always a pleasure.
