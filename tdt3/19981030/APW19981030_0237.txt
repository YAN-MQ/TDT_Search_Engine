Greek Orthodox clerics will not abandon legal efforts to reclaim the 
only known copy of writings by ancient Greek scholar Archimedes, which 
was auctioned off for dlrs 2 million to an American collector. Culture 
Minister Evangelos Venizelos, who had tried to organize a winning 
auction bid, said Friday that lawyers will pursue claims that the 
1,000-year-old volume was stolen from a monastery operated by Orthodox 
Patriarchate of Jerusalem. All but four works, including the Archimedes 
text, were transferred to Athens from the monastery library in Constantinople 
_ present-day Istanbul _ following World War I. The Archimedes volume 
was previously held in monasteries in the Middle East. The 174-leaf 
manuscript, known as the Archimedes Palimpsest, contains the notes 
and calculations for two of the most famous theories by the 3rd century 
BC mathematician and inventor: ``On Floating Bodies'' and ``Method 
of Mechanical Theorems.'' A palimpsest is a manuscript whose pages 
have been written on twice. When writing materials were in short supply, 
the original text would be washed away when no longer deemed useful. 
But the copy of the Archimedes text is still legible. Some experts 
believe modern scanning methods could extract previously unseen details. 
The Patriarchate had sought to block the Thursday auction at Christie's 
in New York. But a federal court judge refused, saying the seller 
_ a French family _ had clear title to sell the manuscript. Neither 
the name of the family or the American buyer were released by Christie's. 
Greek officials had appealed to Greek businesses and foundations to 
contribute to a fund to compete in the auction. But Venizelos said 
they bowed out of the competition once the bidding approached dlrs 
2 million. With the auction house fees, the final price reached about 
dlrs 2.2 million. The Greek envoy at the auction described the American 
bidder as ``very aggressive.'' ``The Culture Ministry could not compete 
with a rich American,'' the culture minister said. Venizelos and other 
Greek leaders have insisted the Archimedes text is part of the nation's 
heritage. If the Patriarchate wins its legal challenge, the text would 
be given to Athens' National Library, Greek officials have said.
