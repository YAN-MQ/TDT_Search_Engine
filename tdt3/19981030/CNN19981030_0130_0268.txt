There was quite a celebration in new Concord, Ohio, Glenn's hometown. 
Almost 2,000 people gathered at his alma mater, muskingum college, 
to watch the launch on three large screens. Some stood on their seats 
for the liftoff and remained standing until "Discovery" disappeared 
from view. Jeanne Moos will have more on the excitement surrounding 
Glenn's return to space in our lifestyles section, at 54 past the 
hour.
