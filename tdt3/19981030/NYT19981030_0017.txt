Antony Tudor's ``Gala Performance,'' which he created in London in 
1938, portrays three highly competitive star ballerinas from Moscow, 
Milan and Paris as they prepare for and perform in a glittering gala. 
Though essentially a stylized period piece, the ballet continues to 
be surprisingly popular and this year is part of American Ballet Theater's 
fall season. The company will present the piece again on Sunday afternoon 
at City Center with a lead cast that came of age after the heyday 
of the ballet's larger-than-life characters, who in some ways typify 
national styles that no longer exist. How did the three dancers approach 
the roles? Susan Jaffe, who plays the Italian ballerina, modeled her 
portrait on Carla Fracci, an Italian prima ballerina of the 1960s 
and '70s who combined a childlike innocence with a will of iron. ``It's 
really difficult because she's not supposed to do much,'' Ms. Jaffe, 
who also danced the role in the mid-1980s, said of her character. 
``It is in stillness that you portray this person. ``Of course these 
are huge caricatures of these ballerinas. What is funny about the 
Italian is her whole aura of being an angel, but when she comes out 
in the prologue she hits the wardrobe woman.'' Yan Chen will play 
the French ballerina. ``The Italian ballerina is a goddess, subtle 
and well-balanced,'' Ms. Chen said. ``The Russian ballerina thinks 
she's the cream. The French ballerina is happy and bubbly. She throws 
a little fit in one scene, like a little spoiled child, then realizes 
all of a sudden that everyone is watching her. `Oh, how silly of me,' 
she thinks.'' The role of the Russian ballerina is the most difficult 
technically and was given to Eleena Melamed, a corps dancer, after 
several principals gave up on its demands. ``Yeah, I'm petrified,'' 
Ms. Melamed said cheerfully. She sees the Russian as ``a tiger going 
through the woods for her audience.'' ``When the ballerinas practice 
in the Prologue, the Russian ballerina practices her bows,'' she said. 
``Her eyes are always on the audience, except when she is turning.'' 
Ms. Melamed prepared by watching videos of performances by Leslie 
Browne and by long discussions with Sallie Wilson, a Tudor expert 
who danced the role earlier. ``She's darling,'' Ms. Wilson said of 
Ms. Melamed, ``and she's working like a demon.'' Ms. Wilson suggested 
that the younger dancer study Gloria Swanson's Norma Desmond in ``Sunset 
Boulevard'' to understand the Russian ballerina better. She told Ms. 
Chen to think of the French ballerina as the cork in a champagne bottle. 
Wherever the Italian ballerina walks, Ms. Wilson told Ms. Jaffe, she 
leaves a trail of golden flowers behind, permeating the air with magic 
while doing absolutely nothing. Temperamental dancers like the ones 
in the ballet are unpopular today at Ballet Theater, Ms. Jaffe said. 
All three lead dancers agree that ultimately, however, ``Gala Performance'' 
is about giving one's all for audiences, which is not a bad virtue 
to practice in any dance era. ``They're bitches,'' Ms. Melamed said, 
``but they're doing everything for the audience's love and support. 
That's what keeps them going.'' ```Gala Performance' is very difficult,'' 
Ms. Wilson said. ``It's about a performance within a performance 100 
years ago. Layers on layers. But the ballerinas are actually touching 
characters, egos fighting to be onstage. There's a bit of the snob 
to the wardrobe girl. Her feet hurt, but she is dresser to the stars. 
The stage persona of the corps is fresh innocence. They're trying 
to get the rich men in the audience, the ones with the diamond stick 
pins, to supplement their salaries. But you have to do it seriously 
to get a laugh.'' PRODUCTION NOTES: `GALA PERFORMANCE' By American
