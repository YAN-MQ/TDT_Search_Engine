President Clinton has welcomed the program announced by the G-7 countries 
saying the leading economic powers have linked arms to contain financial 
turmoil threatening the world's markets. VOA's David Gullis reports 
from the White House. Mr. Clinton responded to the G-7 announcement 
as he hailed new government figures showing the U.S. economy continuing 
strong growth for the third quarter of the year despite the downturn 
affecting much of Asia and Latin America. The president, who had strongly 
pushed for the G-7 program stressing growth over inflation cutting 
said the United States can't have continued success if its trading 
partners, especially in the developing world, are suffering. If America's 
devotion to freedom and openness is to be met with success, we must 
put a human face on the global economy for the most vulnerable people 
in the emerging countries when they face hard times. The president 
in particular welcomed the G-7 plan for a new IMF lending system to 
help developing countries facing economic problems but not yet in 
crisis. David Gullis, VOA News, the White House.
