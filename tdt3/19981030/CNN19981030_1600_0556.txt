Scientists say they've found more evidence a huge meteor or Comet 
killed the dinosaurs. According to a report in the journal "science," 
the crash produced the element chromium, which is found in a layer 
of rock dating back to the time dinosaurs died out. Scientists say 
the composition of the chromium is similar to what is most often found 
in meteorites, not what's found in the earth's core. It's widely thought 
a meteorite collision cast debris into the earth's atmosphere, making 
the planet too cold for dinosaurs to survive.
