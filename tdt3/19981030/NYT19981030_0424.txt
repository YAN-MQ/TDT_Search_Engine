After several days in a hospital following a fall in his home, Sheriff 
Sherman Block of Los Angeles County died on Thursday from a massive 
brain hemorrhage. He was 74. But Block's family and supporters hope 
voters will still re-elect him to a fifth term on Tuesday as a tribute, 
and as a way to keep his opponent out of the sheriff's chair. Block 
was first elected sheriff in 1982, and since then he became the nation's 
highest-paid public official, surpassing even the president. Already 
two of the five members of the county board of supervisors, which 
oversees the sheriff's department, Michael Antonovitch and Don Knabe, 
have said they will vote for Block. ``The campaign moves forward,'' 
Block's campaign spokesman, Joseph Scott, said Friday. ``That's what 
Sheriff Block said he wanted, and that's what his family wants. It's 
important for the voters to have a choice.'' H. Eric Schockman, a 
political science professor at the University of Southern California, 
said: ``This is very weird politics. The political establishment has 
clearly lined up behind this ghost vote.'' The reason, Schockman said, 
appears to be an issue of control. If Block wins, the board of supervisors 
will appoint an interim sheriff, taking the decision out of the hands 
of the voters. The interim sheriff would serve until 2000 and would 
then have the option of running for the remaining two years of the 
four-year term. If victory goes to Block's opponent, Lee Baca, a high-ranking 
sheriff's official until he retired last June, the board still must 
appoint an interim sheriff until Dec. 3, when the new sheriff will 
be sworn in. The chairman of Block's campaign, Jay Grodin, said at 
a news conference Friday that ``the sheriff has made it very clear 
along that way,'' that Baca, 56, was not qualified for the job. Grodin 
complained that Baca's major issue during the campaign was the state 
of Block's health. ``He had no other vision,'' Grodin said. ``His 
issue is gone.'' Although Block was as tough as a winter in his native 
Chicago, his health had been in decline. He had two bouts with cancer 
and required kidney dialysis several times a week. Jorge Flores, Baca's 
campaign manager, said that Baca liked and admired Block and that 
out of respect for his former boss he would not make any public statements 
for a couple of days. Baca has not made any public campaign appearances 
since Block entered the hospital last weekend, Flores said. ``Lee 
is a man who has risen through the ranks from deputy to chief,'' Flores 
said. ``He's certainly qualified to be sheriff.''
