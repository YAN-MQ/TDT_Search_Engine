The prime ministers of Russia and Moldova agreed Friday to step up 
their economic cooperation, and said Moldova would repay a natural 
gas debt to Russia with food, news agencies reported. Yevgeny Primakov 
of Russia and Ion Chubuk of Moldova also agreed to work harder to 
settle ethnic conflict in the secessionist Trans-Dniester region. 
The region declared independence in 1990, fearing that Moldova would 
seek to reunite with neighboring Romania. Chubuk, who arrived Thursday 
night, left Friday evening to return home after his talks with Primakov 
and other top officials, including Defense Minister Igor Sergeyev 
and Gazprom Chairman Rem Vyakhirev. He and Primakov agreed to prepare 
an economic cooperation program for the next two years, and said they 
were optimistic about prospects for cooperation in joint ventures, 
financial industrial groups and other endeavors, according to the 
Interfax and ITAR-Tass news agencies. Chubuk agreed that Moldova would 
repay a debt for natural gas deliveries from Russia in Moldovan food.
