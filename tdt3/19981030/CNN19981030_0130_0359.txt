The food and drug administration has approved a drug to help prevent 
breast cancer in healthy women. Tamoxifen has been tested on women 
considered high risks for the disease. Tests conducted by the drug's 
manufacturer indicate Tamoxifen reduces the risk of breast cancer 
by almost half. But one of the drug's side effects is an increased 
risk of a rare uterine cancer.
