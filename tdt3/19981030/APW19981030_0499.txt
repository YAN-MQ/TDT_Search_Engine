Kaiserslautern, the defending Bundesliga champion, appealed Friday 
to have its loss to Bochum one month ago annulled because Bochum goalkeeper 
Thomas Ernst failed a drug test after the game. Kaiserslautern, which 
lost the Sept. 26 game 3-2 at home, said it should be awarded the 
three points for a victory. In a strange twist, Kaiserslautern would 
have lost the game anyway because its coach, Otto Rehhagel, broke 
German federation rules when he substituted a fourth non-European 
Union foreign player. Having won the game anyway, Bochum never used 
its right to appeal to the German Soccer Federation (DFB). ``It would 
be a scandal if Kaiserslautern got back the points,'' said Bochum 
chairman Werner Altegoer. In the match, Ernst collided with Kaiserslautern's 
Danish defender Michael Schjoenberg, who suffered a leg fracture. 
During the halftime, Ernst was given a medicine by the club doctor 
to stabilize his blood pressure, Altegoer said. ``He didn't do anything 
forbidden, he is not guilty of anything,'' Altegoer said. Ernst declined 
to comment but confirmed that he failed the drug test. Bochum has 
requested a second test. The DFB has not said what substance was involved. 
It was the second drug case involving Bochum in less than four years. 
Bochum forward Roland Wohlfarth failed a drug test for a stimulant 
during an indoor tournament in January 1994 and was banned for two 
months. Kaiserslautern's Czech reserve goalkeeper Petr Kouba was banned 
for four weeks last season after failing a drug test for anabolic 
steroids.
