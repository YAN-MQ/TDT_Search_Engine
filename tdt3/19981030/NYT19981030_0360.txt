For the past 26 years, William A. Oates Jr. has picked his stocks 
from the same 10th floor office at 50 Congress Street, in the heart 
of Boston's historic financial district. The holdings in his Northeast 
Investors Growth fund are almost always proven, successful companies, 
often with blue-chip pedigrees. Many people might call his approach 
to investing old-fashioned or stodgy, even unsophisticated. But he 
calls it plain old common sense. Oates, 56, doesn't use computerized 
screens or so-called black-box models to crunch the numbers. He employs 
no analysts to crank out fundamental research and ideas. ``They would 
come up with lots of ideas that I wouldn't listen to anyway,'' said 
Oates, displaying his independent side. ``I'm not going to do what 
a 30-year-old Harvard business school graduate suggests, because I 
know more.'' One thing he knows is to invest in stocks he is familiar 
with. ``I'm looking for something I understand, that has a good track 
record, that has the potential to grow on a steady, understandable 
basis, and through that growth produce value over time.'' That has 
led Oates to banks as well as to big technology, drug and media companies. 
His top 10 holdings are Mellon Bank, BankBoston, Pfizer, Microsoft, 
Time Warner, Warner-Lambert, Walt Disney, Zions Bancorporation, General 
Electric and Merck. Investors should be forewarned that Oates is not 
afraid to be out of fashion. He recalls how the fund, which was started 
in 1980, languished from 1993 to 1994, during a particularly rough 
period for blue chips. And Northeast suffered during the recent market 
selloff, which punished financial stocks. From the market's peak on 
July 17 through Oct. 23, the fund lost 13.8 percent, versus a loss 
of 11.6 percent for its peer group of large-capitalization blend funds, 
according to Morningstar Inc., the financial publisher. The Standard 
&AMP; Poor's 500-stock index lost 9.4 percent over that period. Oates 
does not make big changes in his fund if he believes in the stocks. 
``My horizon is long-term,'' he said. ``I want to make money over 
time.'' Turnover is 16 percent, versus a 64 percent average for its 
peer group, Morningstar said. Oates' buy-and-hold disposition often 
leads to superior results. For the three-year period ended Oct. 23, 
the fund returned 25.6 percent, annualized, compared with 19.3 percent 
for its peer group and 25.1 percent for the S&AMP;P. As evidence of 
his independent style, one of his few sales this year was General 
Re, the giant re-insurance company being acquired by Berkshire Hathaway 
for stock valued at $22 billion at the time of its announcement on 
June 19. ``I sold it because I'm one of these guys that doesn't believe 
in Warren Buffett,'' Oates said, referring to Berkshire's chief executive. 
``I think he's a cult, and I think that Berkshire Hathaway is overvalued.'' 
General Re closed at $220 on Friday, above the $213, or so, at which 
he sold most of his shares. That does not keep Oates from owning two 
of Buffett's favorite holdings. The first is Gillette, which Oates 
likes despite the panning it has received from some analysts since 
the launch of its new triple-blade razor, the Mach 3. ``This is a 
great company,'' he said, ``but, you know, the little rabbits on Wall 
Street going around, they say, `Gee, this blade isn't selling.' I 
say, `Here's a company that's down about 25 percent, it's a market 
leader, it has an exciting new product, great pricing flexibility, 
and currently is out of favor.' And I say `Let's buy more.' '' Despite 
gloomy Wall Street assessments of the blade, ``Gillette says it's 
doing just fine,'' Oates said. ``I think it is a superior shave.'' 
Gillette stock closed on Friday at $45.0625, off 28 percent from its 
52-week high of $62.65625. Oates does not calculate target prices 
for his stocks, but he predicted that Gillette's earnings growth would 
be 15 percent to 16 percent a year over the next year or two and that 
the stock price would eventually follow. Another Buffett holding that 
Oates likes, despite a slump in its price, is Disney. ``Everybody's 
down on Disney,'' he said, citing predictions that the company's theme 
parks might have lower traffic, among other reasons. ``I think it 
is a premier entertainment company; I think Mickey Mouse is known 
throughout the world. Their theme parks are part of Americana; they 
have a fabulous ability to produce things _ apparel, hats _ and a 
fabulous ability to produce movies.'' The stock closed at $26.9375 
on Friday, down 37 percent from its 52-week high of $42.796875. He 
estimated 1999 earnings growth ``in the neighborhood of 15 to 19 percent.'' 
But Oates does not buy only blue chips. One favorite sector is regional 
banks, accounting for 20 percent of the fund's holdings. While the 
market has punished bank stocks in recent months, he said ``common 
sense'' determined that he add to his positions. ``When you get a 
really good company and it's down 25 or 30 percent, and the fundamentals 
are basically the same and you've got some extra cash, then why wouldn't 
you buy a little more?'' he asked. He said recent decreases in interest 
rates should not hurt bank earnings, ``because their cost of money 
is lower.'' The regionals are largely untouched by the Asian crisis, 
and some are likely targets for takeovers by national banks. And a 
healthy regional bank can reflect a robust regional economy, like 
that of the Mountain States. Shares of Utah-based Zions, the fund's 
No. 8 holding, account for 2.6 percent of assets. Oates said Utah's 
population is growing, the bank is expanding, and ``these people have 
a very good long-term record.'' He predicted future earnings growth 
of 13 percent to 14 percent a year. The fund has owned Zions stock 
for at least a decade and has an average cost of about $30 a share, 
he said. It closed on Friday at $53.0625.
