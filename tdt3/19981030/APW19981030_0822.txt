Last time, an Australian named John Glenn fashioned a spotlight, white 
sheets and his clothesline into a backyard beacon he hoped his astronaut 
namesake would see from space. Thirty-six years later, the 76-year-old 
man from Perth again left the light on. About 12:50 a.m. local time 
(1650 GMT), Perth again transformed itself into a city of lights to 
greet astronaut John Glenn during his historic return to space. Lights 
at major stadiums, skyscrapers and thousands of homes were turned 
on to recreate the view Glenn saw 36 years ago as his spacecraft passed 
over Australia. In February 1962, residents stayed up until midnight 
and turned on every house light to send a welcome message to Glenn. 
Every street lamp and neon sign was also lit. According to Tom Wolfe's 
book ``The Right Stuff,'' Glenn saw clouds part to reveal ``an absolute 
mass of electric lights'' in two groups, one in Perth, the other in 
the town of Rockingham to the south. ``The lights show up very well,'' 
Glenn radioed to astronaut Gordon Cooper, who was at a tracking station 
in Australia at the time. ``Please thank everybody for turning them 
on, will you?'' Perth, a remote blip on the map on Australia's southwest 
coast, has kept the title ``City of Lights'' ever since. This time, 
Glenn's flight path took him farther north. But that dod not deter 
residents or the state government, which asked everyone to turn on 
their lights. The BP Oil refinery received permission from the state 
government's Environmental Protection Department to light up its gas 
flare. Glenn flew over Western Australia state about 850 kms (530 
miles) north of Perth. It was expected that most of the state's southwest 
would have been visible to him. ``We won't see the shuttle, but he 
will see us,'' Dr. James Biggs of the Perth Observatory said before 
the passover. ``We'll probably look like a big glowing blob to him.'' 
In 1962, many residents were advised to project normal household lights 
on white surfaces directed skywards to create greater luminescence. 
Australia's Glenn didn't unfurl the sheets this time, and kept it 
simple. ``I've left the porch light on,'' Glenn told Channel Nine 
TV.
