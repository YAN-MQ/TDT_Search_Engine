The Palestinian authority says it has arrested about 100 activists 
in the militant Hamas movement one day after a suicide bomber tried 
to blow up a bus full of Jewish settler children on their way to school 
in Gaza. The arrests are seen as part of a crackdown by Palestinian 
leader Yassar Arafat to show that he's living up to Palestinian promises 
to combat terrorism. The leader of Hamas has also been confined to 
his home.
