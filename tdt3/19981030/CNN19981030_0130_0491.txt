South Africa's truth and reconciliation commission is condemning apartheid-era 
violence inflicted by both whites and blacks. The commission presented 
the findings of its two-year inquiry Thursday to President Nelson 
Mandela. It says whites did too little to oppose apartheid, and the 
guerrilla war against the system of white privilege, which at times 
amounted to a Gross violation of human rights. The report proposes 
those who profited from apartheid should pay a tax to redress the 
poverty created by the old system.
