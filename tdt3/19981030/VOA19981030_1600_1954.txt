The chairman of South Africa's Truth and Reconciliation Commission 
has questioned the commitment to democracy by the ruling African National 
Congress Party. VOA Johannesburg correspondent, Alex Belida reports. 
The last minute court bid was unsuccessful, but Archbishop Tutu says 
he ANC's effort has damaged the image of the ruling party. They have 
done themselves an enormous amount of damage in the world because 
people are maybe wondering now whether these people are committed, 
in fact, to Democratic rule. Speaking on South African National Radio, 
Archbishop Tutu accuses the ANC of seeking special treatment from 
the Truth Panel in an effort to get it to consider its objections 
to sections of the final report linking the ANC to human rights offenses 
during the anti-apartheid struggle. He says he hopes it was just an 
aberration but he calls on all South Africans to remain vigilante 
saying yesterday's oppressed could easily become today's oppressors.
