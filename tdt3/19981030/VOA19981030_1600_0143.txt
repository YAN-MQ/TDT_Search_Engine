Officials in Sweden say a dance hall fire that killed at least 67 
people and injured about 160 others Thursday night appears to have 
started by accident. Earlier, officials in Gothenburg said they suspected 
arson because of how rapidly the blaze spread. Gothenburg's deputy 
mayor, Johnny Mangasen, says the country is in mourning. Flags are 
flying halfway up all of this week today. Authorities say about 400 
people were attending a dance in a facility that was licensed to hold 
only 150 people. Pope John Paul has sent his condolences to the victims' 
families.
