Tropical storm Mitch is dumping more misery on Honduras. And forecasters 
say life-threatening floods could continue. Right now, Mitch is hovering 
over northern Honduras. Sustained winds have decreased to about 40 
miles an hour. Forecasters say Mitch could dump an additional 25 inches 
of rain on parts of central America. Floods and mudslides already 
have chased tens of thousands of people from their homes. Honduran 
officials say banana crops are heavily damaged and closed ports have 
stopped gasoline imports. They say gas rationing could start tomorrow. 
Mitch is responsible for at least 36 deaths.
