In space today, John Glenn spent the day doing his work, a series 
of experiments on aging. He's says he's enjoying himself, but body 
changes caused by space take some getting used to. One thing you may 
notice, I think, which is probably still evident, is the fluid body 
shift that occurs early in flight. Yesterday, everyone was puffed-faced 
around here, looked like the Poppin' fresh dough boy or something 
like that. And I think my face is still swelled up some. I know chiaki's 
face was swelled up. I think, Curt, you've pretty well come down today. 
I can't tell if Steve is still up a little bit or not. I think you 
are. But I guess I'm still a little round-faced here today, and that 
comes from the fluid body shift that occurs. Earlier today, the shuttle 
crew released an experimental communications satellite built by students 
at the U.S. naval school in Monterey, california.
