Hard luck hit two quarter finalists today at the Euro Card Open Men's 
Tennis Tournament in Stuttgart, Germany. Both second seat Marcello 
Rios of Chile and American Jan Michael Gamble were out because of 
injuries. Gamble's back injury gave compatriot and world number one 
player, Pete Sampras, an easy ticket to the final four. Sampras was 
leading in the first set four-one when Gamble could not continue. 
On the other hand, Rios did not even take the court against Russia's 
Yevgeny Kafelnikov. Rios said he had a sore hamstring after playing 
a soccer match using a tennis ball. In action that did take place, 
touch man Richard Krychek ended a nine match losing streak against 
Gore Anivanesavic of Croatia. He won in two tie-breaker sets, seven-six, 
seven-six. He next takes on Sampras in Saturday's semi-finals. Kafelnikov 
will take on Sweden's Jonas Bjorkman, a six-three, six-two winner 
over Britain's Greg Rusetsky. Second seed Mary Pierce of France has 
advanced to her sixth final of the year and her second in two weeks 
at the Siyat Open Indoor Tennis Tournament in Luxembourg. Pierce scored 
a straight sets win over Elena Lahosova of Russia, six one, seven-five. 
In the finals, Pierce takes on Sylvia Ferrena of Italy, a three sets 
winner over top seed Natalie Tozea of France, six-two, two-six, and 
six-three. The 23-year-old Pierce has won three titles in limited 
play this year. She's coming off a win at the Kremlin Cup last week 
in Moscow. And that's sports. I'm Dave Byrd.
