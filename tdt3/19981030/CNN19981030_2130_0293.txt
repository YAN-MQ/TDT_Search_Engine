One of the more intense campaigns of this congressional election season 
has been in California where Barbara boxer hopes the voters will return 
her to the U.S. Senate, as candy Crowley reports. Well, look who's 
here. Actual lir, look who's here for the fifth time in California. 
I have been proud for nearly two years now to do everything I could 
to help barbara get her message out. She is standing by, and this 
is the important part, raising moneyline. This is $100 a head, and 
for people standing around the television, boxer is pouring moneyline 
into the tube. Just about the only people in America who can't be 
sued are foreign diplomats and HMOs. Matt fong is on the ropes. He 
is nine points behind. Are you ready to send Barbara boxer home? Yeah. 
Are you ready to retire her? I'm not going to let you down because 
I see you're not letting me down. Fong has brought in a big gun for 
reinforcement, someone widely respected in the state. Oh, and his 
mom. Please reject Barbara boxer's Negative campaign and support my 
son. He is a conservative California republican with moderate social 
tendencies. He avoids hot button social issues. She is a liberal democrat. 
Will be real California please stand up? It is a referendum on her 
extremism, and her hypocrisy. Barbara boxer is wait outside the main 
stream. Not only is he out of the main stream, he is part of the extreme. 
It is Clinch time. As this campaign moves into the final weekend, 
it's about moneyline. Show me the ads.
