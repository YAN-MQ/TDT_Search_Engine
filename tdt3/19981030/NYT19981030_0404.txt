Stock prices barreled ahead Friday after industrialized countries 
unveiled a new mechanism for stabilizing distressed economies and 
the United States said its growth was faster over the summer than 
analysts had predicted. Large stocks again set the pace, with the 
Dow Jones industrial average climbing 97.07 points, or 1.14 percent, 
to finish at 8,592.10, its highest level since Aug. 25. At one stage 
Friday, the average was up by 165 points. The average's rise of 749.48 
for the month made October 1998 the average's best month since January 
1987. Other gauges also rose solidly, including the Russell 2000 index 
of smaller companies, which has rebounded 21.9 percent from its low 
of three weeks ago to qualify this group as entering a bull market. 
``The mood perception has shifted,'' said Gordon Fines, senior portfolio 
manager at American Express Financial Advisers in Minneapolis. ``There's 
a continuing flow of money back into the markets.'' The bond market, 
which interpreted the rapid 3.3 percent third-quarter growth pace 
of the economy as diminishing the chance for another interest-rate 
cut by the Federal Reserve, tumbled enough to push rates on Treasury 
securities up by as much as one-eighth of a percentage point. Bonds 
also suffered from the continuing withdrawal of money that had earlier 
swung to them from stocks. Agreement by the Group of Seven industrialized 
countries on a new stabilization fund seemed to clear the way for 
a rescue package fashioned for Brazil by the International Monetary 
Fund. Brazil's Bovespa stock market index soared 7.78 percent. Mexico's 
Bolsa jumped 4.28 percent. American financial issues were outstanding 
performers Friday, especially brokerage stocks. Donaldson, Lufkin 
&AMP; Jenrette jumped 5}, to 35}, after having traded as low as 20] 
three weeks ago, while Charles Schwab rose 3 13/16, to 48, and Lehman 
3 7/16, to 38. But the Commerce Department's report of a hefty economic 
expansion over the summer gave a clear lift to stocks tied to the 
business cycle. Dow Chemical was up 3 7/16, to 93 9/16, International 
Paper 2[, to 46 7/16, and Union Pacific 1{, to 47|. Most airline stocks 
boomed. ``It gave more confidence to the market,'' said Cummins Catherwood, 
a managing director at Rutherford, Brown &AMP; Catherwood in Philadelphia, 
referring to the third-quarter growth. ``The economy's okay, not out 
of control.'' Some analysts have forecast a recession next year as 
the impact of foreign distress intensifies. While not predicting a 
contraction in business activity, William Meehan, chief market analyst 
at Cantor Fitzgerald, was leery about stocks, noting that the prices 
of issues comprising the Standard &AMP; Poor's 500-stock index were 
nearing a lofty and almost unprecedented 30 times earnings. ``If we 
have any earnings growth next year, it'll be negligible,'' Meehan 
predicted. American Express, up 2 13/32, to 88 13/32, was the biggest 
factor in the blue-chip index, which has rebounded about 1,050 points, 
or 14 percent, from its low at the end of August. The gain for October 
alone, historically one of the weaker months, was almost 750 points. 
Elsewhere, Kellogg was one of the few major companies to report third-quarter 
earnings Friday, and despite a 34 percent decline, its stock managed 
a gain of 13/16, to 33. Among the airlines, Delta climbed 5 7/16, 
to 105|, AMR rose 3[, to 67 1/16, and UAL rose 3, to 64 15/16. Oil 
issues were mixed, with Chevron up 1|, to 81{, and Exxon down 1 1/16, 
to 71|. The Standard &AMP; Poor's 500 index gained 12.74 points, or 
1.17 percent, to finish at 1,098.67, with Citigroup, up 1{, to 47, 
making the biggest impact. Ford rose 2~, to 54\, while General Motors 
rose 2, to 63 3/16. Lesser companies with big moves included King 
Kullen, up 17 to 112, Starwood Financial up 5{, to 71, Tandy, up 4 
9/16, to 49 9/16, Reno Air, up 4{, to 22}, and Telebras, the Brazilian 
phone company, up 4 3/16, to 76. On the New York Stock Exchange, advancing 
issues outnumbered declines by 2,215 to 880. Volume was 785 million 
shares. European shares were higher, with chief indexes up 2.65 percent 
in Frankfurt, 1.49 percent in London, 1.13 percent in Paris and 3.11 
percent in Stockholm. In the Far East, Hong Kong's Hang Seng index 
climbed 2.25 percent to finish above the 10,000 mark for the first 
time since May.
