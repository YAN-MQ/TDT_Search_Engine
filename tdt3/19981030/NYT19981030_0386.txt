The U.S. ambassador to Eritrea resigned last year after State Department 
investigators determined that he had engaged in sexual misconduct, 
the White House said Friday. Clinton administration officials said 
an investigation by the department's inspector general supported accusations 
of sexual harassment made against the ambassador, John Hicks, by two 
secretaries in the American Embassy in Asmara, the capital of the 
East African nation. While refusing to discuss details of the inquiry, 
the White House spokesman, Joe Lockhart, said Hicks resigned in September 
1997 after a report by the inspector general concluded that the ambassador 
had ``engaged in sexual misconduct.'' Lockhart was responding to a 
report Friday in The Washington Times that President Clinton had dismissed 
the ambassador at a time when Clinton was involved in what he has 
since acknowledged was an inappropriate sexual relationship with Monica 
Lewinsky. Asked Friday whether Clinton had known of the ambassador's 
resignation when it occurred last year, Lockhart replied, ``Not that 
I'm aware of.'' Asked if the resignation might suggest a double standard 
in light of Clinton's acknowledgment of his relationship with Ms. 
Lewinsky, the spokesman said, ``I don't know the details of the case, 
so it suggests nothing to me.'' Reached by telephone at his home in 
Silver Spring, Md., Hicks, a career diplomat and 22-year veteran of 
the Agency for International Development, said, ``I'm not commenting 
and don't intend to comment.'' Hicks' lawyer, Thomas Trgovac, said 
the embassy secretaries had ``improper motives'' in bringing the accusations 
against the ambassador, but he would not say what those motives were. 
Trgovac denounced the accusations in the inspector general's final 
report as ``false and supported only by flawed and deficient investigation.'' 
``Hicks denied the accusations and was prepared to vigorously defend 
himself at an administrative hearing,'' the lawyer said. ``However, 
Ambassador Hicks decided to pursue employment opportunities in the 
private sector rather than have his family go through the personal 
indignities and legal expenses that would result in him defending 
himself against these baseless accusations.'' The inspector general, 
Jacquelyn Williams-Bridgers, had no comment on the investigation. 
While administration officials refused to make available a copy of 
the inspector general's report, they confirmed that the inquiry began 
after the two secretaries accused Hicks of repeatedly groping them 
and of other crude sexual advances. The officials said the investigation 
had largely validated the accusations and found that Hicks had created 
a hostile work environment for the two women. They said the Justice 
Department reviewed the case for possible criminal prosecution but 
declined to bring charges. Clinton named Hicks to the embassy in Eritrea 
in May 1996.
