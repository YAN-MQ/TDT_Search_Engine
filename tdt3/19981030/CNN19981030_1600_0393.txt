French prosecutors are investigating former Chilean leader augusto 
pinochet. The French justice minister may seek his extradition from 
Britain. Three French families whose relatives disappeared in Chile 
have filed a Complaint charging Pinochet with crimes against humanity. 
The national court in Spain has ruled crimes committed by the Pinochet 
regime fall under Spanish jurisdiction. A British court ruled Wednesday 
it does not have jurisdiction over the chilean general. He remains 
under police guard at a British hospital.
