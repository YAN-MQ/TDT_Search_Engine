Let the old folks get misty-eyed about John Glenn's return to space. 
Here in the self-proclaimed capital of Silicon Valley _ the true epicenter 
of science and industry in America, 1998 _ nostalgia doesn't play. 
Most of those who run the high-tech industry that now fires the world 
and much of its economy are too young to remember the first Glenn 
mission. Their scientific explorations venture into virtual space, 
not outer space, and their means of propulsion, the microchip, must 
be examined through a microscope, not a telescope. The only prospect 
of danger comes from hair-raising gyrations of the Nasdaq exchange. 
There has been a countdown here all week long _ second by second on 
the San Jose Mercury News Web site _ but it wasn't for Glenn. Saturday 
is the official opening _ the ``plugging in'' _ of The Tech, a nearly 
$100 million mango-and-azure downtown showplace for Silicon Valley's 
revolutionary accomplishments. The full title of the place is The 
Tech Museum of Innovation, but as Peter Giles, its CEO, explains: 
``The word `museum' carries a stigma here. People really aren't interested 
in what's come before but in what's coming.'' To get more than 300 
of the valley's high-tech companies _ from Hewlett-Packard and Intel 
to Adobe and Infoseek _ to pitch in, The Tech had to be conceived 
as an un-museum too busy rushing toward the future to reflect upon 
the past. Only a little history peeks through: A small panel describes 
the advent of the first microprocessor in that ancient year of 1974. 
Otherwise The Tech aspires to be something new in the run of science 
centers and museums. Reflecting the values of a restless, hypercompetitive 
industry whose products become outdated almost the second they are 
released, it does not expect any of its ``permanent'' exhibits to 
last more than five years. Reflecting the gestalt of the people who 
built and run that industry, it contains no grandiose monuments to 
the valley's founding geeks or even any biographical descriptions 
of them. In one exhibition area, there's the facade of a garage _ 
the prototypical birthplace of Apple and so many legendary valley 
start-ups _ but the interactive displays all celebrate the cult of 
the chip, not the personality of a Wozniak or Jobs. San Jose has passed 
its neighbor San Francisco in size and is now the 11th-largest American 
city; its metropolitan area exports more goods than those of New York 
or Detroit. But as a cultural force, it ranks nowhere near so high. 
Part of the idea of The Tech _ which secured $41 million in city redevelopment 
funds _ is to anchor a cluster of downtown arts institutions and to 
make the city ``a destination,'' as the outgoing mayor, Susan Hammer, 
puts it. But The Tech is also designed to solve two more practical 
problems. It has a huge educational outreach program, aimed at local 
teachers and students whose science training has been gutted by Proposition 
13. And it hopes to be the area's unofficial visitors' center; tourists 
who come to Silicon Valley looking for spectacular sights in tune 
with its giant achievements have been baffled to find mainly office 
buildings and modest computer history exhibits. Cape Canaveral it's 
not. In my hours exploring The Tech's efforts to fill this vacuum, 
I enjoyed touring a mock ``cleanroom'' (where microchips are fabricated) 
and using computer software to design my own personal roller coaster 
(which I could then take for a virtual ride). The ethics exhibits 
_ on phenomena like E-mail privacy and the digital retouching of news 
photos on magazine covers _ are unusually tough. But what most impressed 
me was how The Tech captures the meeting of science, commerce and 
culture of its moment much as the Air and Space Museum did in the 
1970s. ``Start-ups and venture capital typify the valley more than 
technology,'' said Giles, as we talked in The Tech's New Venture Hall. 
And so what you find here is not just an explication of the science 
that is our current new frontier but the cultural coordinates of all 
our frontiers: the buzz of impatient youth, of gold-rush booms and 
busts, of new immigrant talent and burgeoning community. In other 
words, The Tech is a snapshot of the national idea as it stands at 
the turn of our century. See it before these restless American pioneers, 
like all those before them, come up with a better idea and tear it 
down.
