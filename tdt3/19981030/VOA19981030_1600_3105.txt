China has ordered its business community to give jobs to demobilized 
soldiers. The Official People's Daily quoted a document from a Central 
Military Commission Friday that said all organization, enterprises, 
and institutions have the responsibility and indeed the obligation 
to accept demobilized soldiers. The document added that party and 
government organizations should not refuse to accept the soldiers. 
The order cited fears that China's ongoing demobilization of half 
a million troops could undermine national security and economic stability.
