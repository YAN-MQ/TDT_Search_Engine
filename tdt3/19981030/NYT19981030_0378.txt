Every once in a while, a political campaign comes along that offers 
evidence that a particular group, whether professional, religious 
or geographic, has become influential and must be reckoned with. But 
could the campaign of Acting Gov. Paul Cellucci, a Republican seeking 
a full term as governor, herald the arrival of witches as a political 
force? The question follows an unusual outcry this month against a 
television advertisement run by Cellucci's campaign. The advertisement, 
which attacked the professional ``priorities'' of Cellucci's Democratic 
opponent, state Attorney General Paul Harshbarger, included a segment 
featuring a black-hatted, green-faced crone, while an announcer said 
that Harshbarger once threatened to prosecute a Christian group that 
had allegedly harassed Salem's modern-day witches, members of a broad, 
``neo-Pagan'' tradition called Wicca. After the commercial aired, 
a number of witches _ who say they practice a peaceful, nature-centered 
religion unrelated to devil worship _ telephoned the Cellucci campaign 
to complain that the ad played to stereotype and indirectly made light 
of an incident they recall as threatening. On Monday, some staged 
a rally in Boston, during a debate between the candidates. The advertisement 
``was insulting,'' said Amy (Gypsy) Ravish, proprietor of the Nu Aeon 
bookstore, a high priestess and a member of the Council of Elders 
of the Temple of Nine Wells, a Wiccan group. Laurie Cabot, proprietor 
of The Cat, the Crow &AMP; the Crown, denounced the advertisement, 
but said it had brought witches together. ``Thanks to Cellucci, we 
have a common issue,'' said Ms. Cabot, author of four books on witchcraft 
and founder of the non-profit Witches League for Public Awareness, 
whose mission is ``correcting misinformation'' about witches. The 
league's chairwoman, Cheryl Sulyma-Masson, a veterinary technician 
in Rehoboth, said that after she complained to the Celucci campaign 
and got no satisfaction, she sent information about the advertisement 
to bookstores with a Wiccan clientele. ``Witches now understand that 
we have to have a voice in politics,'' she said in a telephone interview. 
Salem, site of witchcraft trials in 1692, now celebrates its link 
with an infamous past. Familiar images of a caped figure on a broomstick 
seem ubiquitous, a lure to tourists who visit places like the Witch 
Museum. The city has also gained a reputation as tolerant of alternative 
spirituality, becoming home to Wiccans and adherents of New Age beliefs, 
along with stores like Ms. Ravish's and Ms. Cabot's that sell books, 
jewelry and other goods associated with contemporary witchcraft. Some 
local witches have formed a ``Witches' Education Bureau,'' to answer 
questions from the curious. It publishes a flyer saying witchcraft's 
essential law is, ``Do as you will and harm no living thing,'' asserting 
that witches believe in a god and a goddess, in reincarnation, but 
not in a devil, and declaring that flying broomsticks are imaginary 
but would be nice ``at rush hour.'' Oct. 31, Halloween to most Americans, 
is the day that witches call Samhain, a New Year's festival that honors 
the dead. John K. Simmons, a professor of American religion at the 
University of Western Illinois, said the number of people in the many, 
diverse Wiccan groups is not known, but it is growing, aided by a 
focus on nature and openness to women's leadership, which strike receptive 
chords in a culture where environmentalism and feminism are important 
to many. Even so, witchcraft can still attract hostility, even in 
Salem. In June 1992, some Wiccans complained to police that they had 
been harassed by a visiting conservative Christian group. Harshbarger 
wrote a letter warning the group it could face prosecution for civil 
rights violations if it returned. In the Cellucci advertisement, which 
debuted Oct. 15, the announcer said Harshbarger had ``made his priorities 
crystal clear,'' in part because ``he threatened prosecution on behalf 
of the witches of Salem.'' (Among other things, the ad showed a Santa 
Claus figure and said the attorney general barred Christmas decorations 
from his office. A spokesman for Harshbarger said he asked employees 
not to hang decorations in the office's common areas.) Andy Antrobus, 
a Cellucci campaign spokesman, said the advertisement was no longer 
airing, because it had run its course. ``We're talking about our opponent's 
professional record, not anything else,'' he said. As for the witches' 
response, he said, ``It really didn't amount to a whole lot more than 
a day of phone calls.'' Indeed, not every witch in Salem was upset. 
Jennifer Williams, who described herself as a solitary practitioner 
and ``not a member of any coven,'' said, ``The Wiccan community reacts 
too strongly to this sort of thing.'' Her advice? ``It's like, relax, 
lighten up,'' she said. But others like Teri Kalgren, proprietor of 
an organic herb shop, took the matter more seriously. ``There are 
2,000 of us on the North Shore,'' she said. If they all voted, she 
said, politicians might take note. But she said many witches had not 
registered. ``A lot of people who come into witchcraft are tired of 
the mainstream,'' she said.
