A British judge Friday granted bail for former Chilean dictator Gen. 
Augusto Pinochet, detained in London on a Spanish warrant seeking 
his extradition on charges of murder, torture and kidnapping during 
his 17 years in power. Judge Stephen Richards attached conditions 
to the bail after British authorities decided not to oppose the move. 
Pinochet must remain at north London's Grovelands Priory Hospital, 
where he is recuperating from back surgery, and remain under police 
guard at all times. On Wednesday, England's High Court threw out two 
Spanish warrants seeking Pinochet's extradition, ruling he was immune 
from prosecution as a former head of state. But the court added he 
could not leave Britain until prosecutors appealed the ruling. A five-judge 
panel at the House of Lords will hear the appeal, probably next week, 
after the Monday filing deadline. In granting bail, the judge said: 
``The concern must be to hold the position pending an appeal to the 
House of Lords, but on terms that impose on the applicant only such 
restrictions as are properly necessary.'' Pinochet was not in court 
for the hearing. A Spanish judge is expected to push ahead for his 
extradition after Spain's National Court ruled Friday that Spain had 
jurisdiction over crimes committed during the military dictatorships 
in Chile and Argentina.
