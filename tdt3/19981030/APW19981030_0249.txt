Authorities have banned a play that depicts India's first prime minister 
as a lovelorn man pining for the wife of the country's last British 
viceroy, a government spokesman said Friday. The Hindu right-wing 
Shiv Sena had sought permission from the government of the northern 
Uttar Pradesh state to stage on Jawahar Lal Nehru's birth anniversary 
Nov. 14 the Hindi play ``Lady Mountbatten's Tresses and Nehru.'' The 
alleged love affair between Nehru and the viceroy's wife has been 
the subject of books and newspaper articles in India for years, but 
writers have rarely attempted to piece together the story in a country 
where the personal scandals of politicians rarely make headlines. 
After consultations with the federal government, permission was denied 
because the play could lead to violent protests and law and order 
problems, a government spokesman said Friday. Further screening of 
the play has also been banned. The decision evoked surprise as Uttar 
Pradesh state is governed by the Hindu nationalist Bharatiya Janata 
Party, an ally of the Shiv Sena, and both the parties are staunch 
rivals of the main opposition Congress Party which Nehru once led. 
The organizers of the play said the decision was an infringement of 
their fundamental rights. The Shiv Sena plans to petition the court 
and organize demonstrations against the decision. The Shiv Sena blames 
Nehru for the partition of India in 1947 at the end of colonial British 
rule and the creation of the new Islamic state of Pakistan. Party 
officials said Nehru's fascination for Edwina Mountbatten had a role 
to play in the partition. ``Nehru succumbed to the charms of Lady 
Edwina Mountbatten ... (who) took advantage of Nehru and influenced 
him to agree to the partition of India and the creation of Pakistan,'' 
the party's state president Ram Sharan Gupta told The Associated Press. 
``The play is based on historical evidence and published books. Nehru 
was the main architect of Pakistan's creation and the people of India 
have a right to know of this,'' Gupta said. Fifty years on, India 
and Pakistan are rivals. The partition still evokes passions in India, 
where freedom movement leader Mohandas Gandhi was assassinated in 
1948 by a man who listed the country's division as one of the reasons 
for the attack. A play that sought to give the assassin's version 
was banned in Maharashtra state _ which is governed by the Shiv Sena 
_ earlier this year after protests forced organizers to stop its screening.
