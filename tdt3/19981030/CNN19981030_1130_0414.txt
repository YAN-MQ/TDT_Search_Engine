This is Orelon Sidney with your "CNN Headline News Weather" update. 
A low pressure system moving across new Brunswick and Nova Scotia 
will bring an end to rainfall and cloudiness for the northeast by 
Saturday. Another cold front system moving into the northern plains 
means cooler air from Canada, expected from lake superior back into 
the northern Rockies. Also look for a cold front to move into the 
pacific northwest. One of the strongest systems will be a low-pressure 
storm moving across the four corners region into the deep south. That 
will mean a chance of rain spreading eastward through the weekend. 
Nome will see a chance of snow, 33 degrees for a high temperature. 
Across the virgin islands, look for a chance of thunderstorms, with 
highs in the mid to upper 80s. The eastern U.S. will see 60s, 70s 
and 80s under a Ridge of high pressure, while 40s and 50s cover most 
of the northeast, the Great Lakes and into the rockies. Some spots 
in Wyoming will see temperatures staying in the 30s. The extended 
forecast includes showers and thunderstorms through the central plains, 
with a mix of precipitation heading eastward through monday. These 
thunderstorms and showers diminish by Tuesday. The forecasts for more 
than 7,000 cities is at CNN.com.
