The Ottawa Senators said Friday that Swedish right-winger Andreas 
Dackell will be out of the lineup for 10 to 14 days with injuries 
sustained Thursday night when he was checked by Eric Lindros of the 
Philadelphia Flyers. Dackell, who suffered a concussion and required 
30 stitches, was to be examined again Friday morning by doctors. The 
1.93-meter (6-foot-4), 108-kilogram (238-pound) Lindros crushed the 
1.80-meter (5-foot-11), 87-kilo (191-pound) Dackell into the corner 
boards to the right of Ottawa goaltender Damian Rhodes late in the 
first period. Dackell fell to the ice immediately after the hit, where 
he lay for about 12 minutes while receiving medical attention. Dackell, 
blood smeared on his face, was taken off the ice on a stretcher to 
the Senators' dressing room. Referee Richard Trottier did not penalize 
Lindros. The Senators are considering sending a tape of the incident 
to the headquarters of the North American National Hockey League, 
according to team spokesman Morgan Quarry. Ottawa won the game 3-1.
