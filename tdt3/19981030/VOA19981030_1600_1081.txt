Time now for sports. Dave Byrd joins us here in the studio. Dave, 
I guess we begin with football. That's right, Tom. What we in the 
United States call soccer where the Major League Soccer Chicago Fire 
is going to go for a second big title in less than one week just a 
few hours from now when it takes on the visiting Columbus Crew in 
the U.S. Open Cup. This 85-year-old tournament had been lightly regarded 
until Major League Soccer was formed three years ago. The event is 
open to all U.S. pro and amateur teams with the top 32 reaching the 
champion tournament. The Fire is fresh from winning the MLS Cup in 
their debut season by beating the two-time defending champion, D.C. 
United two to nothing last Sunday in Pasadena. Columbus is not happy 
this match for the U.S. Open Cup will be played in Chicago's Soldier 
Field. It ended up being the back up venue when the match was canceled 
at Virginia Beach in August because of Hurricane Bonnie.
