The Palestinian authority is intensifying its crackdown on the militant 
islamic group Hamas. Palestinian police cut the phone lines of the 
Hamas founder and the group's leading activist. He's under house arrest. 
More than 100 activists have been arrested since the group claimed 
responsibility for a suicide bombing in Gaza yesterday. The bomber 
tried to ram a car into a bus full of Jewish children but an israeli 
Jeep blocked its path.
