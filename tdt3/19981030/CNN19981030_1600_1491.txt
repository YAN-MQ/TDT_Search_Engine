Aerosmith has donated $10,000 to the Massachusetts general hospital 
burn program. The band is expressing its gratitude to the doctors 
that treated drummer joey kramer after he was burned in an accident 
last month. Kramer has recovered, and Aerosmith has returned to its 
appropriately named "Nine lives" tour. This is Dennis Michael with 
the "Hollywood Minute."
