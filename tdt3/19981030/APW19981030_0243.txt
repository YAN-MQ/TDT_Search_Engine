As many as 300 people may have been killed in an attack on a remote 
village in northeastern Kenya, news reports said Friday. Both the 
Daily Nation and the East African Standard said some 50 teenage girls 
were carried off by the raiders who also stole an estimated 17,000 
goats, cattle and camels. Hundreds of people were reported missing. 
There were varying reports on the number of dead. Adnan Kenyan, a 
legislator from Wajir West district _ the hardest hit _ told reporters 
Thursday at least 200 people had been killed in the raids on Budada, 
Gerari, Tuli and Mudama villages about 200 kilometers (125 miles) 
west of Wajir town, the provincial capital. Abdi Ogle, an official 
in the opposition Democratic Party of Kenya, put the number of dead 
at 300. Wajir town is 500 kilometers (310 miles) northeast of Nairobi 
in a dry, desolate region where cattle raids and clan-based clashes 
over the use of scarce water and wells are common. Wajir District 
Commissioneer Fred Muthami said 139 died in the raid, but Marsden 
Madoka, minister of state in the office of President Daniel arap Moi 
in charge of security said the exact number of dead was not known. 
Madoka, government officials and legislators belonging to Moi's ruling 
Kenyan African National Union party claim the raiders were members 
of the Oromo Liberation Front, a rebel group from neighboring Ethiopia. 
They say the victims were members of the Kenyan Somali Degodia clan 
and that members of the Boran ethnic group brought in the OLF to help 
them attack the Degodia. The OLF is outlawed in Ethiopia, and it was 
not possible to contact any representative to obtain the group's version 
of events. But in the past, the government has blamed the OLF for 
raids when it was later revealed that the Kenyan army was involved 
in attacks against the nomadic people of the region as part of a crackdown 
on alleged banditry. Most of the inhabitants of North Eastern Province 
are ethnic Somalis whose sub-clans migrated south from the Horn of 
Africa in the 15th and 16th centuries. Prior to Kenya's independence 
from Britain in 1963, residents in the region voted in a referendum 
to join with the new state of Somalia, but the outcome was overruled 
by British colonial authorities.
