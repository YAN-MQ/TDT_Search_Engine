In an interesting twist, people who E-mailed a securities regulatory 
group to report cases of unsolicited messages known as "spam" were 
then "spammed" themselves earlier this month. The north American securities 
administration association set up an E-mail address for reporting 
Internet securities fraud. Since then, individuals have reported nearly 
1,000 cases of fraud much of which was solicited by spamming. But 
to their dismay, they were then bombarded with multiple thank-you's 
which were a result of a computer glitch. The regulatory group has 
since fixed the problem.
