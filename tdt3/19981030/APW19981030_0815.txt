A district court in Pec sentenced an ethnic Albanian to three and 
a half years in prison Friday for joining the rebels fighting Serb 
forces in the province of Kosovo. Tanjug news agency reported that 
Hakija Mahmut Demaj was also found guilty of illegally crossing into 
Albania and attempting to smuggle in weapons into Serb-led Yugoslavia. 
Demaj, who crossed the border with about 100 fellow rebels, obtained 
an automatic rifle, 150 bullets and two hand grenades there, Tanjug 
said. Hundreds of ethnic Albanians in Kosovo are awaiting trial on 
similar charges.
