For the first time ever, the Vatican is conducting its own inquisition 
of the Inquisition. And, perhaps appropriately, the initial investigation 
of the church's centuries-long effort to root out heretics is being 
held behind closed doors. Visiting scholars attending the symposium 
are being fed and housed in St. Martha's Residence, which was recently 
completed to house the cardinals who will gather in conclave when 
the time comes to elect a new pope. ``It was the desire to keep the 
discussion at a cultural level appropriate to the importance of the 
initiative which led us to close the sessions to the public,'' Cardinal 
Roger Etchegaray, who heads the Vatican's main committee on the year 
2000, said in his opening statement, which was issued by the Vatican. 
The cardinal made clear that while the symposium would seek to separate 
fact from myth about the Inquisition, it would not try to evade the 
church's overall responsibility. Noting that efforts to distinguish 
Inquisitions in Spain and Portugal from those in Italy had allowed 
some to ``make apologetic arguments and lay responsibility for what 
Iberian tribunals did onto civil authorities,'' Etchegaray said such 
factors ``do not change the ecclesiastical character of the institution.'' 
The three-day symposium, which is to end Saturday night, is part of 
the long and painful process Pope John Paul II began when he called 
for the church to undertake a general ``examination of conscience,'' 
as Christianity prepares to enter its third millennium. At the same 
time last year, a similar symposium was convened to examine, among 
other things, the role of Christian teaching in the spread of anti-Semitism. 
That symposium was part of a process that led John Paul to issue an 
``act of repentance'' in March for the failure of Catholics to deter 
the mass killing of Jews during World War II. This symposium, which 
gathered well-known Inquisition experts from around the world, is 
intended to provide the pope with a historical basis on which to decide 
whether in 2000 the church should also repent for acts committed during 
the Inquisition. ``We are preparing material based on historical truth 
which will present the facts,'' said Msgr. Rino Fisichella, an official 
with the Vatican's Commission for the Jubilee of the Year 2000. ``Then 
it is up the the pope to decide.'' He quickly added that the pope's 
conclusion was not predetermined. ``There are several ideas about 
the Inquisition,'' he said. ``One is the result of research. The other 
is the result of cliches and romances.'' The Inquisition was established 
by Pope Gregory IX in 1231 as a special court to curb the spread of 
heresy. In 1252 Pope Innocent IV officially sanctioned the use of 
torture to extract the truth from suspects. The papal tribunals took 
different forms in different countries over the centuries, investigating 
and stamping out various forms of heresy, from witchcraft to Judaism. 
The Spanish Inquisition established in 1478 by Queen Isabella and 
King Ferdinand, with Rome's approval, mostly focused on forcibly testing 
the sincerity of Jewish converts, though the secular authorities also 
used torture to eliminate political enemies. The Spanish Inquisition 
was not formally abolished until 1834. The Roman Inquisition, founded 
in 1542 as a Vatican agency to battle the Reformation, still exists. 
Since 1965 it has been known as the Congregation for the Doctrine 
of the Faith, and is headed by Cardinal Joseph Ratzinger. In January 
Ratzinger for the first time made the archives of the Roman Inquisition 
available to scholars. ``We know all the sins of the church,'' Ratzinger 
dryly said at the time. ``And I hope more will not be added to them.'' 
The pope, who in 1992 admitted that the church had erred in 1633 when 
it condemned as a heretic the astronomer Galileo, one of the best-known 
victims of the Inquisition, seemed prepared to go even further in 
a 1994 apostolic letter that laid out his plans for the millennium. 
In it the pope deplored the ``acquiescence given, especially in certain 
centuries, to intolerance and even the use of violence in the service 
of truth.'' He ascribed blame for ``acquiescence'' to individuals 
rather than the church as an institution. But he said historical circumstances 
did ``not exonerate the church from the obligation to express profound 
regret for the weakness of so many of her sons and daughters who sullied 
her face.'' But some participants in the symposium said the brutality 
and reigns of terror commonly associated with the Inquisition had 
been exaggerated. ``Much has been written in the past about the methods 
used by the Inquisition, often based on erroneous or unreliable data,'' 
Agostino Borromeo, a historian who holds a church knighthood, said 
in a statement distributed by the Vatican. ``The most recent studies 
seem to indicate that torture and the death penalty were not applied 
with the pitiless rigor that, according to some, characterized the 
activity of the tribunals until their disappearance.'' But some of 
the outside historians expressed doubt that the symposium would produce 
a tidy conclusion for the Vatican. ``My impression is that we were 
brought together to clear the air, but without any specific aim,'' 
Henry Kamen, a professor at the Higher Council for Scientific Research 
in Barcelona, said in an interview between sessions. ``There are so 
many papers, and so many diverse views and perspectives that one can 
easily lose one's way.''
