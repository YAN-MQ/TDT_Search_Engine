A private land auction was held in Moscow on Friday for the first 
time since the 1917 revolution, and a top city official said the practice 
might be cautiously phased in. The land that was sold was in not in 
Moscow, but in the southern region of Saratov, which introduced agricultural 
land sales earlier this year. Such sales are illegal in most of the 
country. Forty-one lots of rural land in Saratov were sold at the 
Moscow auction, which was opened by Mayor Yuri Luzhkov, the ITAR-Tass 
news agency reported. One of his top deputies, Oleg Tolkachev, told 
reporters that there are tentative plans to begin selling land in 
one district of Moscow, and that such an auction could provide a model 
for a broader sale of land in the capital. However, he added, ``Moscow 
lands are not deer pastures,'' and the city needs to carefully consider 
the ramifications of selling land containing the infrastructure of 
municipal utilities, such as water mains and electrical cables.
