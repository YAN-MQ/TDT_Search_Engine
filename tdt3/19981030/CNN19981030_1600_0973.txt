Stocks finish the trading week on a high note. Let's get the details 
from Lauren Thierry at the cnnfn news desk in New York. Lauren? That's 
right, Sachi, investors sent stocks higher for the second day in a 
row. Their optimism fueled by some better-than-expected economic news 
as well as a plan from the world's major industrial countries to stabilize 
world economies. Part of that plan aims to bolster the international 
monetary fund with additional resources. The Dow Jones industrial 
average rose 97 points at 8592. The Dow was up 164 points earlier 
in the session. The broader markets all ended in the plus column as 
well, with the NASDAQ composite gaining 14 points. Evidence that the 
economy is expanding at a sustainable pace. U.S. Gross domestic product 
jumped 3.3% in the third quarter. That's nearly twice the second quarter's 
rate, but still well below the torrid growth of the first quarter. 
Strong consumer spending helped offset a decline in exports and business 
investments.
