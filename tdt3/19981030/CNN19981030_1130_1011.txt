A number of economic reports driving the markets today. The nation's 
enomy expanded at a faster pace than expected during the third quarter. 
The commerce department says Gross domestic product surged 3.3% -- 
that's almost twice the rate recorded in the second quarter. Consumer 
spending, which accounts for two-thirds of total GDP, helped offset 
a decline in exports and lower business investment. A rebound in auto 
inventories also helped overall output. But sales of new homes fell 
last month, down 1% in September to an annual rate of 830,000 new 
homes. That's the third straight month of declines. Economists had 
expected a modest rise.
