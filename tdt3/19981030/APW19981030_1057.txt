Water receded slowly in some flooded areas of Germany Friday, but 
forecasts of heavy rain on the weekend kept thousands of emergency 
crew members on alert fearing a worsening situation. In Delmenhorst 
near Bremen in the north where city center was flooded late Thursday 
and early Friday 300 emergency workers, including soldiers and firemen, 
used rubber boats to evacuate residents. Other areas in Lower Saxony 
state were also bracing for more flooding, especially in the Harz 
and Weser-Ems river regions, said state interior minister spokesman 
Ingo Marek. In Baden-Baden, which saw its worst flooding in decades 
late Wednesday, the Oos river was dropping steadily but with more 
rain forecast emergency crews were kept on alert because earthen dams 
were already so saturated even smaller amounts or rain posed a threat. 
In northern Baden-Wuerttemberg state Wertheim on the Main river was 
expected to flood as that main tributary to the Rhine in the west 
continued to rise from waters pouring in out of its tributaries in 
Bavaria. The Rhine was also reported rising at Mannheim, and forecasters 
were no longer discounting the possibility of a catastrophe similar 
to weeks of flooding along the Rhine in January 1995. In Rhineland 
Palatinate west of the Rhine, the Saar, and Mosel rivers were also 
reported still rising with flood waves heading toward the Rhine. At 
Mainz, the Rhine was at 5.50 meters (18 feet) and forecast to reach 
6.30 meters (20.7 feet) by Saturday morning with low-lying areas already 
threatened with flooding. Worse was expected with forecasts of up 
to 40 liters (10.6 U.S. gallons) per square meter (10.8 square feet) 
of rain. Some ferries across the Rhine suspended business Friday, 
and flood officials warned barges to travel slowly because of the 
high, choppy waters. Should the heavy rain come, serious flooding 
would also occur along the Mosel river, said emergency officials in 
the city of Trier. In Bavaria state, the Naab, Iller and Lech rivers, 
which enter into the Danube were rising, and a flood wave along that 
stream was also expected, the emergency office in Regensburg said. 
Harsh storms that started late Tuesday have killed at least three 
people _ one in Germany, one in the Czech Republic, and one in Switzerland. 
All were involved in vehicle accidents with trees uprooted by wind. 
Power cuts, traffic snarls, and highway closings have been reported 
in Austria and the Netherlands.
