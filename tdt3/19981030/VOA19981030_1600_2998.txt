The Dow Jones Industrial Average closing today at 8592. That was up 
97 points. And for the week, the industrial average gained 140 points. 
Standard & Poor's 500 index closed today at 1,098; that was up 12 
points. Analysts say stock traders were encouraged by a government 
report which shows the U.S. economy growing at a 3.3 percent annual 
rate. That's much stronger than had been expected. There was also 
optimism about plans by the major industrialized nations to make some 
big changes in the global economic system. A key is in $90 billion 
in new funding for the International Monetary Fund. Well, a survey 
of U.S. discount stores shows Halloween does not scare them at all. 
In fact, a survey shows sales of Halloween merchandise such as costumes, 
candy, and decorations are running well ahead of last year. Once again, 
Dow Jones Industrial Average closing today up 97 points. This is Breck 
Ardery. Thank you, Breck, for that live report from New York.
