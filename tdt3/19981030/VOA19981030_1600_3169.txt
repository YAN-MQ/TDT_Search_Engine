And while we're talking about communications, Swedish telecommunications 
company Erikkson says it's been awarded a $63 million contract to 
install a private radio network in Canada. Erikkson will provide a 
network for E Com which provides emergency communications systems 
in Southwest British Columbia. The network should be in service early 
spring of 1999 providing wireless emergency communications for police, 
ambulance, and fire services. Dow Jones News wire reports say the 
network will eventually cover a nearly 34,000 square kilometers of 
British Columbia, including the greater Vancouver area.
