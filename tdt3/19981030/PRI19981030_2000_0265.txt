There are only a handful of states that have little if any restriction 
on campaign financing. In Illinois, it's meant one of the most expensive 
election seasons in state history. A new survey suggests residents 
are ready for change. NPR's Cheryl Corley reports. Illinois is one 
of the last states in the country where contributors can give as much 
money as they want to the politician they favor and there aren't any 
restrictions on contributions from corporations, political action 
committees or labor unions. Seventy percent of Illinois voters say 
there should be limits for all of those groups. According to a survey 
commissioned by the Illinois Campaign for Political Reform. Spokesman 
Jim Kale says the poll seems to have tapped into voters' frustration. 
I think people are tired of seeing all the negative ads on TV. They 
don't, we don't seem to be getting a lot for the money that we are 
spending and I think people do know that candidates are spending a 
good deal of their time raising money. The Illinois legislature did 
pass a law prohibiting politicians from using campaign dollars for 
their personal use, but activists say that's only a first step. Cheryl 
Corley, NPR News, Chicago.
