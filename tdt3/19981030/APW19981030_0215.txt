Israel's Cabinet will vote on the new peace accord with the Palestinians 
on Sunday if the Palestinians submit their security plan to the United 
States by then, Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu's office said Friday. 
If the plan is not ready by then, the peace agreement will not be 
discussed by the ministers, but the Cabinet session will be held in 
any event, according to the office of Netanyahu's spokesman, Aviv 
Bushinsky. Hassan Asfour, a top Palestinian negotiator, said Friday 
that the Palestinian plan would be presented Monday as scheduled. 
``There are no problems on security arrangements,'' he said. The security 
plan is to cover efforts by Yasser Arafat's Palestinian Authority 
to stop extremists from carrying out attacks against Israel. The Wye 
River accord lists steps including arrest of suspected terrorists 
and confiscation of illegal weapons. Israel has been demanding an 
all-out Palestinian struggle against terrorism in return for carrying 
out its part of the deal, handing over another 13.1 percent of the 
West Bank to Palestinian civilian control. The Cabinet was originally 
scheduled to vote on the accord last Thursday, but the meeting was 
canceled. The Israelis said they had reason to believe that the Palestinian 
security plan would not be submitted on time.
