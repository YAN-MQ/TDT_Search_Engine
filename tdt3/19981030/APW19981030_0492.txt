YANGON, Myanmar (AP) _ U.N. special envoy Alvaro de Soto left Myanmar 
on Friday, giving no clue whether his talks with government and opposition 
leaders had moved the two sides any closer to a dialogue. De Soto, 
a U.N. assistant secretary general on his fifth official visit since 
1995, also went to Insein Prison on Thursday where he met some prisoners, 
diplomatic sources said. Outsiders are rarely allowed access to prison, 
where many of the country's political prisoners are held. De Soto's 
mandate is to soothe political tensions between Myanmar's military 
government and its pro-democratic opposition. He held a two-and-a-half 
hour meeting Thursday with Lt.-Gen. Khin Nyunt, the influential Secretary-1 
of the ruling State Peace and Development Council. De Soto met with 
Aung San Suu Kyi, head of the opposition National League for Democracy, 
and other senior members of her party on Tuesday and Thursday,, said 
NLD vice chairman Tin Oo on Friday. He declined to give details of 
the discussions, telling The Associated Press that it would be covered 
in a U.N. human rights report to be issued next week. Asked to comment 
on de Soto's visit, Tin Oo said only that ``It is better for a U.N. 
official to visit here than not allowed here at all.'' Since de Soto 
last visited Myanmar in January, already poor relations between the 
government and the opposition deteriorated sharply. In the past few 
months, almost 1,000 members of Suu Kyi's party have been detained 
in an effort to block its activities. More than 100 have reportedly 
been released in the past few weeks. In a statement released late 
Thursday, the NLD urged the government to prove its goodwill by freeing 
all the detainees ``immediately without any preconditions.'' It described 
the junta's contention that the NLD members had not been arrested 
but merely invited to government guest houses for an exchange of views 
as ``dishonorable.'' The assertion ``was a deliberate attempt by the 
government to deceive the visiting U.N. special envoy to Myanmar,'' 
it said. The junta seized power in 1988 after violently suppressing 
pro-democracy demonstrations. Suu Kyi's party won a landslide victory 
in 1990 parliamentary elections, but the military refused to yield 
power.
