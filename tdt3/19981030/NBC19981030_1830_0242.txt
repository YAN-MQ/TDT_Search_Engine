While that was going on in space, back here, the dark side of life 
on earth -- Terrorism. Tonight, evidence that the terrorist campaign 
against the United States is much more widespread, sophisticated and 
involving many more people than originally suspected, and one of them 
was trained by the U.S. army. NBC's Jim Miklaszewski with more on 
these stunning developments. Senior U.S. intelligence officials tell 
NBC news, that in the three months since the U.S. embassy bombings 
in Kenya and Tanzania, american investigators have made a startling 
discovery. That the worldwide terrorist network run by Saudi exile 
osama bin laden is more sophisticated than ever imagined. More than 
a dozen suspects have been arrested so far. Five of them are currently 
held in the federal detention center in manhattan, including a former 
U.S. army sergeant, who had allegedly trained islamic militants in 
terrorist plots against the U.S. he's 46-year-old Ali mohammed, an 
Egyptian citizen who came to the U.S. in 1985, enlisted in the army 
and was assigned to special forces command at fort Bragg, North Carolina. 
Mohammed provided Arabic culture and language training for special 
forces troops, appearing in several instructional videos. So what 
they are looking for for -- But U.S. government sources claim that 
in 1989, sergeant Mohammed came to this Brooklyn mosque to train Islamic 
terrorists in guerilla tactics, including bombingmaking, providing 
U.S. military manuals on tactical and guerilla warfare. Mohammed allegedly 
trained several suspects, who were later tried and convicted in the 
bombing of the world trade center and a plot to blowup New York landmarks. 
But in a strange twist, one of the suspects, El sayyid nossair, argued 
they were actually being trained by the U.S. to support rebels in 
Afghanistan and that sergeant Mohammed worked for the CIA. We argued 
to the jury at our trial back in 1995 that he was an intelligence 
asset of the United States of America. They say he did offer to work 
for the CIA in the early 1980s but they turned him zoun. Vai or not, 
they report that Mohammed is now linched to the osama bin laden network. 
They expect information on the U.S. bombs sometime soon.
