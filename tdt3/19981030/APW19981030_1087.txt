France's Mary Pierce stayed on course for her second tennis tournament 
win in as many weeks Friday, reaching the final of the dlrs 164,250 
Seat Luxembourg Open with a 6-1, 7-5 win over Elena Likhovtseva of 
Russia. In Saturday's final, Pierce will face Silvia Farina of Italy, 
who prevented an all-French matchup by ousting top seed Nathalie Tauziat 
6-2, 2-6, 6-3. Pierce, 11th in the WTA rankings, already won the Kremlin 
Cup in Moscow last week. Pierce was rarely troubled by the Russian, 
ranked 27th, and swept into the final with a straight-set win. Pierce 
is trying to put some gloss on a disappointing season with a late 
surge. Tauziat's glory came at Wimbledon, when she reached her first 
Grand Slam final, but she fell one step short of a final here. Farina, 
No. 24 in the WTA rankings, claimed her third seed this week by tenaciously 
hanging on when Tauziat tried to stage a comeback. After losing the 
second set, the Italian remained poised before edging Tauziat in the 
tense final games. Saturday's winner will take home dlrs 27,000 and 
a Seat car.
