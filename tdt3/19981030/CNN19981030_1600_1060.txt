The sharper image is accusing Gillette of unfair business practices. 
It has filed a suit alleging Gillette tried to prevent it from selling 
razors which use Gillette's sensor and mach-3 blades. The sharper 
image says it sought prior approval from Gillette before staring the 
$1 million production of its dynablade line, but only heard back from 
Gillette in the form of legal threats after it started marketing the 
dynablade. Gillette is claiming a breach of patent rights.
