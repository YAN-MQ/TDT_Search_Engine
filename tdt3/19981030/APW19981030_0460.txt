Japan's economic potential is very strong, while high debt and low 
savings make the American economy the ``most vulnerable,'' an influential 
Japanese finance official said Friday. Eisuke Sakakibara, vice minister 
for international affairs at the Finance Ministry, acknowledged that 
the Japanese economy had problems, but noted the nation's high savings 
rate is a major plus in its favor. ``Japan is facing a possible crisis. 
At such times it's important to take dramatic steps,'' Eisuke Sakakibara 
said at a Tokyo symposium. ``I think the most vulnerable economy is 
that of the U.S.'' The comments come as Japan is battling its deepest 
recession since the end of World War II. Unemployment and bankruptcies 
are at record highs, and the banking system is hobbled by heaps of 
bad debt. Sakakibara's remarks contrast with the way economic woes 
have generally been portrayed by Washington, which has been pushing 
Japan to turn around its economy so it won't hurt the robust American 
economy. But Sakakibara said that in contrast to Americans, Japanese 
are frugal savers, with more than 1 quadrillion yen (dlrs 8.6 trillion) 
in savings. The United States was more vulnerable, he said, because 
it was the world's biggest debtor nation and because U.S. savings 
rates have dropped to near zero. Sakakibara also said Japanese bank 
managers are becoming more aware about the need to cut costs in order 
to survive. He pointed to Daiwa Bank's recent decision to pull back 
its overseas business as an example. Japan has passed laws approving 
the use of some 60 trillion yen (dlrs 517 million) in public funds 
to bailout or help troubled banks, estimated to have some dlrs 1 trillion 
in bad debts from the excessive lending of the 1980s.
