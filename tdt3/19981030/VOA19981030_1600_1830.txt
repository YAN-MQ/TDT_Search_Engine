Palestinian authorities are pursuing a harsh crackdown on Islamic 
militants, but Israel is demanding further steps. Prime Minister Netanyahu 
wants the self-rule authority to arrest Mohammed Daheef, a leader 
of the military wing of Hamas. Palestinian security forces have already 
arrested more than 100 activists from Hamas and the Islamic Jihad 
group since Thursday's anti-Israeli bomb attack in the Gaza Strip.
