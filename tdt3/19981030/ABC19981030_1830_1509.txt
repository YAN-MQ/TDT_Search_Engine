Finally tonight, one of those wonderful David and Goliath stories 
that sometimes show up in sport. Football is a game of goliaths -- 
big people on a big field, hitting each other very hard. Davids can't 
stand the punishment. Conventional wisdom in the national football 
lgue is that little guys should go elsewhere. Well, NFL, make way 
for Doug Flutie. Here's ABC's John Frankel. We all like to root for 
the little guy. Is that Doug Flutie coming in at quarterback? it is. 
In this case, literally, the little guy. This Sunday, backup quarterback 
Doug Flutie will start his third game of the season -- this time against 
the Miami dolphins and coach Jimmy Johnson. The last time Flutie played 
against Johnson was Thanksgiving 1984. He threw the pass known ever 
since as the "hail Mary" that led Boston college to an upset win over 
the University of Miami, then coached by johnson. From Boston college, 
Doug Flutie. It was one reason he won the heisman trophy that year. 
But at 5'9", he was thought to be too small and too fragile for the 
NFL. And before long, he was exiled to the Canadian football league. 
What's bothered you the most through your professional football career? 
The fact that everybody tries to judge you before watching you play. 
So even when I came here, number one is the size. Now, I'm too old. 
One time they questioned my arm strength. Northern exposure proved 
to be good. In eight seasons in Canada, he set passing records, won 
the league's MVP six times, and three championships. This season, 
Buffalo invited him to training camp. It was very difficult to win 
championships up there. But, I had done that. It was time to move 
on and take the next challenge. Flutie signed a contract for $300,000. 
No one expected him to play much. But when Buffalo's other quarterback 
was injured, Flutie stepped in. He's in for the touchdown. You saw 
mighty mouse, you know, he comes to save the day. I can't wait to 
watch Flutie again. I'll tell you what, the guy is fantastic. Tiger 
Woods and Wheaties -- not here. I got one. "Flutie flakes" are flying 
off the shelves. The proceeds go to the foundation he set up for his 
autistic son. He can make us smile at the drop of a hat. After all 
these years, Flutie has finally established himself as an NFL quarterback. 
Who says nice guys finish last? Score one for the little guys. John 
Frankel, ABC News, Buffalo. nothing flakey about Flutie.
