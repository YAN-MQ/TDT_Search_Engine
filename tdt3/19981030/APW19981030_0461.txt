Business friends of banking fraud suspect Boguslaw Bagsik have raised 
more than dlrs 1.1 million to bail him out of jail, twice the amount 
necessary, according to newspaper reports Friday. Bagsik, along with 
five others, has been on trial since February. Prosecutors say he 
defrauded the national bank of some 424 million zlotys (dlrs 121 million) 
in Poland's biggest embezzlement case since its transition to a market 
economy. Bagsik, the former head of the Art-B corporation, is accused 
of duping the banking system by creating phantom accounts to rack 
up interest. A 1991 investigation into Art-B led to the dismissal 
of the national bank chairman. The bail money came from business contacts 
of Bagsik in Poland and in Israel, where he and his deputy Andrzej 
Gasiorowski fled arrest in August 1991. Bagsik was arrested in 1994 
in Switzerland and has been jailed in Poland since his extradition 
two years ago. Gasiorowski is still in Israel, where he helped collect 
bail money, newspapers reported. The names of those who gave money 
were not published, but their identities would be revealed if they 
post the bail.
