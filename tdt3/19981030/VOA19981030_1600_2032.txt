A crew of the U.S. Space Shuttle Discovery has released a satellite 
into orbit on the second day of the mission that returned pioneer 
astronaut John Glenn to space. More from VOA's David Mcalary. The 
Discovery astronauts have deployed a tiny 50 centimeter-wide satellite 
called Pamsab, a small U.S. Navy communications satellite. They have 
also tested the shuttle's robot arm in preparation for its release 
of a solar observation satellite Sunday. Earlier, Mr. Glenn and his 
six colleagues observed the blazing lights of Perth, Australia lit 
up in honor of the mission. Residents of that city illuminated every 
light just as they did for John Glenn's fly over in 1962. The 77-year-old 
senator said the nighttime view was clear from 555 kilometers high. 
They've really got it lit up tonight here for two big centers of light 
there. The larger area I think a little since I saw it from this angle 
last time. Mr. Glenn and the Discovery crew continued to activate 
scientific research experiments they will conduct for the next week 
of this busy mission. David Mcalary, VOA News, Washington.
