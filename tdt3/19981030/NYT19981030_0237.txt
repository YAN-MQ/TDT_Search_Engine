Winter storm warnings were in effect Friday for the San Juan Mountains 
in southeastern Colorado, with more than a foot of snow forecast to 
fall at elevations above 9,000 feet. Saturday, snow will continue 
to fall in the mountains of northeastern New Mexico and southeast 
Colorado as a cold, upper-level low pressure system forges slowly 
eastward. Father north, pockets of steady rain, perhaps mixing with 
snow at times, are likely along the Front Range and foothills of the 
Colorado Rockies as moist winds from the southeast are forced to ascend 
the sloping terrain. To the east, rainfalls will exceed 2 inches in 
parts of western Kansas and northwest Oklahoma as a surge of moist 
air from the Gulf of Mexico glides over a warm front. Moderate to 
heavy rains are also possible across parts of north and west Texas 
and the rest of Oklahoma as showers and thunderstorms erupt after 
moist air is lifted ahead of the upper-level low over New Mexico. 
Showers and storms will arrive in Arkansas later in the day. Windy, 
chilly and damp weather will persist across northern New England as 
Atlantic moisture wraps inland around a stalled low pressure system 
over the Gulf of Maine. However, spokes of low clouds rotating around 
the low in the Gulf of Maine could spiral as far south as Boston. 
With high pressure anchored over Quebec causing steering winds to 
detour around the low, the inclement pattern will persist for most 
of the weekend. Meanwhile, wet weather will be the tenor of the day 
west of the Cascades in Washington and Oregon. Focus: Frost Above 
Freezing Frost glazed parts of the Susquehanna River Valley in Pennsylvania 
early Friday even though air temperatures stayed above 32 degrees. 
Official air temperatures are measured about 5 feet above the ground 
in order to avoid the extreme variations that often occur next to 
the ground. On a clear, calm autumnal night, for example, the ground 
cools very rapidly as it radiates its energy skyward while receiving 
little energy back from the dry, cloudless atmosphere. In turn, air 
temperatures next to the ground can fall to 32 degrees or below while 
readings higher up are above freezing.
