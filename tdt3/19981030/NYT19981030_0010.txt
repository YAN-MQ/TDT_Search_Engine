Taking a page from the bitter senatorial battle in New York, former 
Rep. Gary Franks, a Republican, harshly criticized on Thursday the 
voting record of Sen. Christopher Dodd, saying the Democrat had missed 
1,000 votes while in Congress. In the second debate of their campaign, 
Franks on several occasions raised the issue of missed votes and attacked 
Dodd about what he contended was a lack of clout in Washington. Dodd, 
on the other hand, used the debate to criticize Franks on health care, 
education and civil rights. Dodd asked Franks why he voted to cut 
Medicare by $600 billion and why he voted against the Family and Medical 
Leave Act. Franks said he did not vote to cut Medicare but instead 
voted to reduce future spending on the program that provides health 
coverage for retired Americans. He criticized Dodd for his support 
for ``national health care.'' Later in the debate, Franks said he 
did not support the medical leave act because it imposed too much 
regulation on companies that already gave workers time off. Dodd also 
attacked Franks for voting against the civil rights restoration bill 
and legal services for the poor. ``When it comes to these issues, 
I take great pride in my record,'' Dodd said. ``I am for affirmative 
action. I just don't talk about these issues. When I get a chance 
to do something about it, I take action.'' ``Except when you didn't 
show up to vote,'' Franks shot back. ``We had an opportunity to extend 
the Civil Rights Commission back in 1987 and you weren't there.'' 
Although the two candidates used most of the debate to draw the distinctions 
and differences between them _ beginning even before the start of 
the debate over a squabble over whether Franks could have the same 
riser as Dodd _ both Dodd and Franks said they supported federal hate 
crime legislation and a bill to ban job discrimination on the basis 
of sexual orientation. Dodd refused to criticize Franks for his personal 
finance problems, and criticized the moderator, Steve Kotchko, for 
asking a question about a threatened bank foreclosure on two of Franks' 
properties. The debate was held at the Farmington Marriott hotel and 
was sponsored by the Connecticut Broadcasters Association, but fewer 
than 30 members of the association remained to watch the debate. And 
only about six members of the association stayed to watch the ninth 
and final forum for the two gubernatorial candidates. But because 
the forum was being taped for broadcast, Gov. John G. Rowland and 
Rep. Barbara Kennelly, the Democratic challenger, delivered their 
stump speeches anyway to the largely empty room.
