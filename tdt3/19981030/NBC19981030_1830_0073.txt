Good evening. This is the view of earth for John Glenn tonight, and 
there's a lot going on down here he can't see -- developments in the 
Paula Jones case, the closing days of the campaign -- but who can 
blame Glenn if he has other concerns tonight? The 77-year-old grandfather 
is holding up well on his second day in space and busy with his experiments. 
NBC's Robert Hager is covering the flight from mission control in 
Houston. Tom, well over 24 hours in space now, and we can report that 
John glenn and his crew are doing just fine. Hard at work, faces a 
little puffy, which is normal in space, but not sick. Here is how 
it is going so far. a wake-up call for the first full day in space. 
And soon after, John Glenn and Spanish astronaut Pedro duque, at work 
in the shuttle's lab. Later, with pilot Steve Lindsey and commander 
Curt brown, Glenn describes his adventure. We had a wonderful ride 
up yesterday. I was keyed into every little noise that we made on 
the way up and it was quite different than the ride I got before a 
long, long time ago. There has been a track record in the past aah 
high percentage of the people getting sick sometime within the first 
day or two, but fortunately the crew has felt fine up here this time. 
Also in space, fluid flows up to the face as well. Yesterday everyone 
was puffed up yeed. It looked like the pufffin dough boy. I guess 
I am a little round today. That is something that goes away after 
a couple of days and you get back to normal. One other thing. I did 
have a chance to get some window time up there, and I'll just tell 
thaw the view is just something. It is so hard to describe. It is 
moving. It is emotional. And the flashback on this trip to 1962 when 
Glenn first soared over perth, Australia, the entire city turned on 
the lights for him to see, and he radioed back. The lights show up 
very well, and thank everybody for turning them on will you? Today, 
perth lit up again. And Glenn responded again. A long time ago, I 
looked at the same thing it looks beautiful up here, and you can pass 
that along to the people of perth. That first Glenn mission went well 
all the way to splash down. This one has some more time to go until 
a week from this Saturday, but so far it is going just as well some 
32 years later. tom.
