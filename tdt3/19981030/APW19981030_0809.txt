About 20 environmentalists Friday hit the chief of the World Trade 
Organization with cream pies, an official said. WTO Director-General 
Renato Ruggiero had just given a speech at Chatham House in London 
in which he defended a WTO decision overturning a U.S. attempt to 
protect endangered sea turtles from shrimp fishermen. Ruggiero released 
a one-sentence comment through his Geneva headquarters, saying, ``When 
they have no more rational arguments, the fringe elements have to 
use cake.'' WTO spokesman Keith Rockwell, who was by Ruggiero's side, 
expressed concern about the ``very threatening and hostile'' attack 
on the 69-year-old Ruggiero, who is to step down next year, said a 
trade official. Rockwell led Ruggiero back into Chatham House and 
wiped the cream off his suit and face. He had been hit by more than 
one pie, said the official. A group calling itself the Biotic Baking 
Brigade later issued a statement saying its pie throwers sent ``a 
sticky message to Ruggiero and the global elite: `To those who wish 
to dominate the world, the world replies, `Let them eat humble pie.''' 
The WTO drew the ire of environmental groups two weeks ago by ruling 
that the United States cannot force shrimp-exporting countries to 
fit their fleets with dlrs 75 devices that protect the turtles. The 
World Wildlife Fund called the ruling a blow to turtles ``and against 
the development of international norms and practices.'' Other groups 
also denounced the decision. However, the ruling upheld countries' 
right to introduce laws to protect exhaustible natural resources. 
In his speech Friday, Ruggiero said the decision ``strongly reinforces 
the growing need to negotiate global environmental rules and standards, 
and to reach a global consensus about environmental issues.'' The 
ruling was against a U.S. law forbidding the importation of shrimp 
caught with trawling nets and equipment that harm endangered species 
of sea turtles. India, Malaysia, Pakistan and Thailand have refused 
to put the devices on their nets. Unequipped nets are blamed for killing 
150,000 turtles a year worldwide.
