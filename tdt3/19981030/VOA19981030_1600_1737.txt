A developer in Northern California wants to offer two very different 
services in one business. Morgan Stone is hoping to open an auto service 
center that will serve specialty coffee drinks while customers get 
their oil changed. The business would be called Lube and Latte. So 
far, Mr. Stone's efforts have run into resistance. The local Planning 
Commission in the Dublin, California area ruled against his proposal 
saying the Lube and Latte wouldn't fit in an upscale shopping district. 
Mr. Stone is hoping that Dublin City Council will overturn that recommendation 
and approve his idea.
