People in Sweden are demanding answers following a fire at a teen 
disco in the southern city of Dawtonburg. At least 60 people were 
killed, most of them teenagers; 190 others were injured. Police say 
they are still investigating the cause of the fire. David Lowing reports. 
The Swedish police are keeping an open mind on arson, but there is 
no evidence that the fire was started deliberately. Up to 400 young 
people had gathered for a party in a small upstairs meeting room designed 
for less than half that number. The fire spread quickly, setting light 
to wooden decorations. Most of those who died were trampled in the 
rush to escape through two narrow exits and overcome by smoke. The 
bodies of more than 60 were taken to a hospital where all day long 
the family and friends of the dead filed through. David Lowing in 
Gautenberg.
