You're listening to the World. Don't forget you can join us anytime 
online at www.theworld.org. This is PRI, Public Radio International. 
I'm Marty Moskoena. This Monday on radio times, Philadelphia DA Lynn 
Abraham and Larry Frankel, head of the ACLU of Pennsylvania, debate 
the jury trial ballot question before the Pennsylvania voters. That 
and more, Monday between 10 and 12 on 91 FM, WHYY. I'm Lisa Mullins. 
Still ahead on the World, the man in charge of verifying Serbia's 
withdrawal of forces from Kosovo says deadlines won't make Slobodan 
Milosevic keep his promise. International pressure will. Also Mexicans 
prepare to celebrate their traditional Day of the Dead and Australians 
let the sun shine in to the Olympic village. First up, this news.
