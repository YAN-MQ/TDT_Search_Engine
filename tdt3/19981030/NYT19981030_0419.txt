Christopher Patten, the outspoken last governor of this former British 
colony, returned this week to a rapturous welcome from the Chinese 
city that sent him packing 16 months ago. Patten is on a private visit 
to promote his new book about Hong Kong and China. But as thousands 
of people lined up at bookstores to buy copies signed by Patten _ 
with many bursting into cheers when he appeared _ the visit took on 
the feel of a campaign swing, heavily tinged with nostalgia. ``After 
all he has done for Hong Kong he deserves our homage and respect,'' 
said Yan Chun-yue, 44, a government worker who waited on line for 
more than an hour on Friday outside a store in a fancy shopping mall. 
Patten said the response to his visit was on the ``overwhelming end 
of the scale.'' Chatting in a rented limousine as he sped from one 
book signing to the next, he said: ``I think I represented and fought 
for the things that make Hong Kong special such as the rule of law.'' 
That is quite a reversal of fortune for Patten, who left a deeply 
ambivalent population and an openly hostile Chinese government when 
he sailed out of Hong Kong Harbor on July 1, 1997. Chinese officials 
called him a ``serpent,'' a ``whore of the East'' and even a ``tango 
dancer'' for his efforts to strengthen democracy in the colony before 
the handover. But Hong Kong's fortunes have turned, too. For many 
here, Patten, a rumpled 54-year-old British politician, symbolizes 
a time when the economy boomed and the politics crackled. These days, 
Hong Kong is staggering through its worst economic downturn in decades, 
while Patten's successor, Tung Chee-hwa, has been criticized for lackluster 
leadership. Patten's book, ``East and West: China, Power, and the 
Future of Asia,'' has sold more than 30,000 copies here, according 
to executives at Macmillan Publishers Ltd., the British publisher. 
They said the average sales for an English-language nonfiction book 
in Hong Kong were 500 to 1,000 copies. Patten received a public-relations 
windfall in February when his first publisher, HarperCollins, part 
of the News Corp., abruptly canceled the book under orders from its 
owner, Rupert Murdoch, because the book was critical of China. In 
the United States, ``East and West'' is published by the Times Books 
unit of Random House, part of Bertelsmann, AG. Although Patten was 
studiously diplomatic about Hong Kong _ he met Tung on Friday _ the 
former governor was far less restrained about China. He said the Chinese 
government was still violating human rights. And he accused Western 
leaders of coddling Beijing in their zeal to forge business ties. 
In particular, Patten criticized Prime Minister Tony Blair of Britain 
for not making more of an issue of human-rights abuses on a recent 
visit to China. ``If whispering behind their hands at meetings with 
Chinese officials works it would be good news for all those who are 
locked up in Chinese jails,'' Patten said. ``But the truth is if you 
proclaim you have an ethical foreign policy, you do rather raise people's 
expectations.'' Patten also condemned Prime Minister Mahathir Mohamad 
of Malaysia for imprisoning former Deputy Prime Minister Anwar Ibrahim. 
When he was in Singapore this week, Patten said, he telephoned Anwar's 
wife, Wan Azizah Ismail, who has become the unofficial leader of a 
growing opposition movement.
