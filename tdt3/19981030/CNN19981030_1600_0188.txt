Astronauts can sure work up an appetite orbiting the earth. Miles 
O'Brien tells us what's on the menu for the crew of "discovery." Beautiful 
sight. The view was great. But the food was nothing to write home 
about. During John Glenn's first foray into orbit, this was haute 
cuisine for hungry space travelers. You took this off, then you had 
a thing you screwed on there. And it broke that seal. And then you 
squeezed it in like toothpaste. Actually, it was applesauce and a 
beef puree. It was more a lesson in physiology than fine dining. The 
scientists -- the doctors back then wanted to see if you could swallow. 
As it turned out, swallowing wasn't the problem -- taste was. Charles 
borland is head of the NASA kitchen. Probably about half the astronauts 
say their taste chiangs when they get into orbit. To satisfy those 
space-induced cravings, NASA spends a lot of time researching, testing 
and prepping the astronauts main meals. Much of that KP duty consists 
of taking water out of their food. This makes the meals lighter to 
send into space. And then once in orbit, they can add water made by 
the shuttle's electrical generators. A weightless smorgasbord of dehydrated 
delights. Currently, there are about 42 different selections of food 
and beverages on the shuttle menu. And before heading off to work 
in space, the crew sits down to a very important taste test. The dietician 
gave us little cups like this. And we had to rate them one though 
nine whether we liked them or not. And then you make up your own menu. 
The basic rules are that they need to have three planned meals a day, 
and they need to give me a menu for every day that they fly. While 
M&Ms, lemonade and irradiated beefsteak appear frequently on space 
menus, the hands-down favorite food in zero gravity is the spicy shrimp 
cocktail. Shuttle veterans say it is the specialty of the house. I 
told my crew members, "you order the shrimp cocktail." But they didn't 
listen. But I knew once I got in space if they didn't have their own, 
they would come after mine. And they did. But the crew on this flight 
certainly heeded the advice. All seven of them will be scarfing shrimps 
in orbit. Miles O'Brien, CNN, Houston.
