The public is getting a chance to see how independent counsel Ken 
Starr spent $40 million in his investigation of President Clinton. 
Some democrats say several of Starr's expenditures are excessive. 
The independent counsel's office has spent $1 million on air travel 
since the investigation began four years ago -- all coach flights. 
$370 a month went for a reserved parking space for Starr and $56,000 
bought an office copier. Starr says his office has been "prudent and 
wise in husbanding" its resources.
