A judicial panel in Spain has ruled the nation's courts have the right 
to place former Chilean dictator Augusto Pinochet on trial for genocide. 
The decision backs a request from a Spanish judge for the general's 
extradition for Britain. However, General Pinochet's fate still remains 
in the British court system. He won a conditional bail Friday but 
was ordered to remain under police guard pending an appeal of an earlier 
decision that his arrest in London was illegal.
