Investigators in Sweden are trying to determine the cause of a dance 
hall fire that left 60 people dead and more than 150 injured. The 
fire broke out while the hall was jammed with 400 people celebrating 
halloween. Most were between the ages of 13 and 18. One official said 
the aftermath of the fire looked like a gas chamber. Officials say 
the fire apparently began with an explosion and spread very rapidly. 
Most of the victims died from smoke inhalation.
