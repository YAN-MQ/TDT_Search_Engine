Iran's spiritual leader on Friday denounced Yasser Arafat as a ``disgraceful 
... traitor,'' heaping on the Palestinian leader some of the worst 
insults he has faced for signing a peace accord with Israel. ``He 
is an abject, treacherous person, a person who is deeply immersed 
in the filth of selfishness and worldliness,'' Ayatollah Khamenei 
said in a highly-publicized sermon at Tehran University. Khamenei 
was interrupted by chants of ``no compromise, no surrender, combat 
Israel'' by the hundreds of thousands of worshipers hearing him. Most 
top Iranian officials including President Mohammad Khatami, Cabinet 
ministers, Parliament members and military officers were present. 
The one-hour speech marked the 1,000th Friday prayers held in the 
capital since the 1979 Islamic Revolution and followed intensive media 
campaigns encouraging people to take part. Although the gist of Khamenei's 
speech reflected Iran's longstanding opposition to any Palestinian 
peace with Israel, the sermon was remarkable for its vitriolic rhetoric. 
Arafat is a ``a disgraceful human, a traitor. He is shameless and 
is unworthy of being called a member of the Palestinian resistance, 
let alone the leader of this movement,'' Khamenei said. Arafat signed 
an accord with Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu on Oct. 23, 
promising to crack down on Islamic militants in exchange for a withdrawal 
of Israeli troops from 13 percent of West Bank. In Gaza, a senior 
aide to Arafat rebuked Khamenei, saying he had ``no right to make 
this kind of a statement.'' ``We call upon the Iranian leadership 
to stop playing games in the Palestinian field because the (Palestinian) 
Authority will not allow Khamenei or anyone else to make the Palestinian 
land a new Afghanistan.'' Many Arab commentators and hard-line Palestinian 
groups have criticized the deal as a sell-out of Palestinian aspirations. 
In Damascus, Syria, on Friday, the leader of the Lebanese militant 
group, Hezbollah, said the accord liquidated Palestinian rights. ``Arafat 
is an agent of Israel and the United States,'' Sheik Hassan Nasrallah 
told a rally in a Palestinian refugee camp on the outskirts of the 
city.
