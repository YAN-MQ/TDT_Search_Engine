Almost everyone appreciates a little time away from the job, but some 
people take more than their fair share. In some cases, fate takes 
a hand and extends a vacation or otherwise accounts for an absence. 
But sometimes an employee's sheer creativity carves a few extra days 
from the work calendar. Did you ever run across one of those people 
who never really takes a conventional vacation _ you know, the kind 
who says, ``I'll just take Mondays and Fridays off instead''? R. James 
Aber of Glen Rock, N.J., tells of a colleague who once received permission 
to take Mondays and Fridays off in lieu of a week or two at a stretch. 
Aber says months went by before anyone realized that his colleague's 
Mondays and Fridays had long since exceeded his allotted vacation 
days. A few years later, according to Aber's postscript, the company 
went bankrupt. ``Many years ago, as a young and slightly irresponsible 
employee, I took a four-day ski trip to Aspen, Colo., with a roommate,'' 
writes Leila Meresman of Manhattan. On the third day, they met some 
young men. On the fourth day, when Miss Meresman and her roommate 
were supposed to catch a midday flight back to New York, the men talked 
them into ``missing'' it and staying in Colorado for another day. 
Miss Meresman called her office and said she was snowed in but would 
be certain to catch the first flight in the morning. In fact, snow 
hadn't fallen for more than a week. Lo and behold, the next morning, 
a major blizzard swept in. The airport was closed for four days. Miss 
Meresman says she was lucky to have a job when she got home and has 
never again messed with Mother Nature. There's a P.S.: ``Still know 
the guys. Have a new job.'' Beth Searing, who lives in Basking Ridge, 
N.J., and works as secretary, went to Florida for a few days with 
a friend. Upon their arrival, they smashed up their rental car and 
had to be taken to their hotel by the police. At midnight, fire broke 
out in the hotel, and Ms. Searing and her friend ended up on the street 
in their pajamas. Then, she said, her return home was delayed by court 
appearances related to the car accident, and she missed two days of 
work. Ms. Searing didn't rid herself of the stress that had driven 
her to Florida in the first place, but she did lose something besides 
those two workdays: 10 pounds. John McInerney, a real-estate executive 
on Long Island, can still quote the best excuse he has ever heard 
from an employee: ``Look, I'm having the best time of my life at this 
place, and your choice is to let me have another day here, or I swear 
I will make your life a living hell.'' McInerney writes, ``I let her 
have the day.'' She had her doubts about hiring the overqualified 
young man from Peru but was desperate to fill an entry-level position 
in the area she supervised, writes Florence McDermott of Manhattan. 
After a few weeks on the job, the newly minted employee ``called to 
tell me he received a draft notice from the Peruvian army and needed 
a day off to consult an uncle in Queens about his options.'' ``Bad 
news the next day,'' she writes. ``The Fujimori government meant business, 
according to Uncle, who suggested pleading with the Peruvian ambassador.'' 
Another day off was granted. ``Even worse news the next day. The ambassador 
hinted that family property in Peru would be confiscated'' if the 
young man didn't show up for induction. The employee begged for a 
few more days' leave so he could plead his case in Lima. Again, the 
request was granted. A few days later, his mother called to say that 
he was still in Lima, negotiating with the army, and that she was 
praying for him. That night, Ms. McDermott writes, a co-worker ``spies 
him leaving an office building in Manhattan and then runs smack into 
him on Metro North.'' ``He admits that he's working as a financial 
analyst at another company. ``My co-workers and I now refer to absent 
job-hunting colleagues as `joining the Peruvian army.' ''
