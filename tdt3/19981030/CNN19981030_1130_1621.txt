John Glenn's first full day in space. That and much more in two minutes. 
I'm Catherine Callaway. This is "Headline News." you wish you didn't 
have to pay for it? Hi, it's jodi... and this is Bill! And nobody's 
home! You got that right. Just sign up now, and calls you make that

evening. We begin again tonight 340 miles above the earth, where the 
oldest man to travel in space is cruising at a speed of 17,500 miles 
an hour around the globe and around and around. John Glenn's first
