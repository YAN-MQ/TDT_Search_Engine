Finance ministers of a group of seven leading industrial countries 
have outlined a program of reform intended to strengthen the international 
financial system. British finance minister Gordon Brown summarizing 
a statement by the seven countries said slow growth, not inflation, 
is now the main risk facing the world economy. Mr. Brown said the 
plan includes $90 billion in additional resources for the International 
Monetary Fund. U.S. Treasury Secretary Robert Rubin suggested at a 
press conference that Brazil may be the first country to make use 
of new lending procedures. Without going beyond where we are in Brazil, 
without commenting on what will happen with respect to Brazil, Brazil 
is a situation which there has been a strong reform program. There 
are obviously issues that still need to be dealt with and that's what 
President Cordoza and the Mr. Bellon spoke to the other day, and Brazil 
obviously is being affected by contagion in the rest of the world. 
Brazil this week announced measures to reduce its large budget deficit 
and soon is expected to receive $30 billion in emergency help to forestall 
a financial crisis.
