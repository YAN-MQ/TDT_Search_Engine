More fallout tonight from last month's crash of Swissair flight 111. 
Investigators found that the planes' insulation may have played a 
role in spreading the fire that apparently broke out in the cockpit. 
So tonight the FAA is urging all airlines and plane manufacturers 
to take steps to make the skies safer. Here's NBC's Fred Francis. 
The insulation on nearly every passenger jet in the world, 12,000 
of them, could quickly fuel a fire when exposed to intense heat. And 
the FAA says it should be replaced. Yet, the FAA and the industry 
insists this is not an immediate safety issue. This is a very good 
example of the aviation system working. The reason that flying is 
as safe as it is is because you have dedicated professionals going 
threw this type of process. The agency whose rules are followed worldwide 
stopped short of demanding immediate replacement but made it clear 
that a firm order would come in six months. FAA detractors say this 
is a threat that the regulators have known about for years but ignore. 
I always say the FAA never misses an opportunity to miss an opportunity, 
and this is just another case of it. Investigators of last month's 
Swiss air crash, in which 229 died in the frigid waters of Nova Scotia, 
suspect that a raging fire on board involved the doomed MD-11's insulation. 
A hidden layer of noise and climate protection is sandwiched between 
a plane's outer shell and the interior. There have been insulation 
fires on four aircraft in recent years. After one in China, the FAA 
was warned that insulation was dangerous. It dismissed the Chinese 
warning. They act as if they're the font of all information in aviation. 
And they disregard information that comes in from anyplace else. We 
had this with the atr crash. And icing -- we even had this with operations 
in value jet. Critics of the FAA say today's recommendation is just 
one more "tombstone" decision by the agency, acting after a major 
air crash instead of when a red flag is first raised. Fred Francis,
