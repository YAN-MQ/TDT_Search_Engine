The White House today is the site of a conference on violence in schools. 
The event comes as a new education department report suggests the 
problem is easing despite shootings last year that left 16 people 
shot to death in attacks on students and teachers. Concern over violence 
in public schools has prompted action by at least one state legislature. 
Kathleen Koch reports on the new laws and reaction to them. In Edinboro, 
Pennsylvania, a student shoots and kills a popular teacher and wounds 
classmates at a school dance. It's just one reason the state house 
last week unanimously passed bills toughening penalties for assaulting 
teachers and giving schools $80 million to beef up security. The whole 
purpose of it is to cut down on violence, cut crime, and that's exactly 
what it's going to do. In reading, a blue-collar town in southeastern 
Pennsylvania, huge reading high school is no stranger to violence. 
With more than 3,500 students, it has had correspondingly high numbers 
of fights, assaults, even attacks on teachers. That's a fact of life 
that you have to deal with now. Reading high is dealing with it by 
hiring security guards, requiring student IDs, even randomly searching 
students. And it's working. Serious incidents are down, and so suspensions 
for violence have dropped by 25% since 1995. There are very few fights 
in the hallways, as opposed to what I hear going on at other schools. 
They're very few and far between. It's not an everyday thing. So you 
feel safe here? Yeah, I'm very safe. Justice department figures just 
released verify what other experts have found -- that 90% of schools 
report no serious violent crimes. If you don't want to get shot dead, 
if you don't want to get injured, the safest place for you to be is 
in a school. Reading high's principal says his wish list is different 
than the state's. If we could have smaller class sizes, more computers, 
more extracurricular activities, then they would feel more a part 
of the school and have greater success. Dangling carrots instead of 
sticks in front of troubled students. Kathleen Koch, for CNN, reading, 
Pennsylvania.
