Well, all of this was welcomed news at the White House which has been 
counting on a strong economy to he the president through his impeachment 
difficults. And today's news on interest rates came just as the White 
House was claiming other victories, as well. NBC's David Bloom is 
at the White House tonight. Tom, the fight now turns from the budget 
to the election just 19 days away. The White House congressional democrats 
and conservative republicans all agree Mr. Clinton got most of what 
he wanted, and democrats hope that translates into better-than-expected 
election results. When the $500 billion budget deal was finally done, 
triumphant democrats weren't shy about proclaiming victory. This is 
a very, very good day for America. Republican leaders insisted both 
sides deserved credit. It's not a question of who won and who lost. 
But democrats were less magnanimous, pointing to the $1.1 billion 
for 100,000 new teachers. We won. $18 billion for the international 
monetary fund. We won. $6 billion in emergency farm aid. We won. The 
White House boasted that republicans had turned democrats for a day, 
and conservatives did not disagree. It's a great society Bill, and 
it's not something that I, as a conservative republican, am prepared 
to support. Republicans and democrats alike took credit for saving 
much of the surplus for social security. We fought off a lot of insistence 
on increased spending. And I can tell you, Mr. and Mrs. America, for 
the most part, your surplus is still intact. We did save the surplus 
for the hard work of social security reform early next year. The president 
apartments incoming chief of staff John Podesta says the budget fight 
proves Mr. Clinton restrain tans his strength and authority.
