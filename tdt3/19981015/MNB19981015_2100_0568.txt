David, thank you once again for coming on the air with us. Sure, Brian, 
good to be with you. David stempler from Washington tonight and a 
lot more to tell you about as we continue this Thursday evening. When 
we come back, why the senatorial year of the woman seems so far off 
now, why some of those senatorial women are fighting literally for 
their political lives. And what may be the final stage in what has 
been a huge legal story out of the state of Arkansas. We'll have a 
live update from there for you tonight. ? ? /
