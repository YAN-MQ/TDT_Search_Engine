Uganda and Rwanda, accused by Congolese President Laurent Kabila of 
being the godfathers of the two-month rebellion against him, have 
called on their former protege to open talks with rebels who now control 
one fourth of the vast central African nation. A statement released 
Wednesday night by Ugandan President Yoweri Museveni's office said 
he and Rwandan Vice President and Defense Minister Paul Kagame ``stressed 
that the resolution of the conflict must address in an acceptable 
and sustainable way the legitimate interests of all Congo's neighboring 
states.'' While both Museveni and Kagame publicly deny they are backing 
the rebels _ a mixture of Congolese ethnic Tutsis, disgruntled soldiers 
from other tribes in Congo and politicians opposed to Kabila _ both 
have sent troops into their large neighbor to the west. ``The military 
presence of Uganda in the Democratic Republic of Congo is based on 
genuine and legitimate security interests and on its determination 
to prevent genocide in the area until a government of the DRC agreed 
on by all the belligerent parties and opposition groups is in place,'' 
the statement said. Kabila, backed militarily by Zimbabwe, Angola, 
Namibia and Chad, has refused to meet with rebels, whom he dismisses 
as puppets of Uganda and Rwanda. The meeting of the two men who masterminded 
the rebellion two years ago that ousted longtime dictator Mobutu Sese 
Seko and put Kabila in power in May 1997 came three days after the 
Congolese rebels captured the eastern town of Kindu and its strategic 
air base. Officials in the capital, Kinshasa, have conceded they lost 
Kindu but claim that government troops are regrouping. In the rebel 
stronghold at Goma in eastern Congo, rebel political leader Ernest 
Wamba dia Wamba said Thursday the time for negotiations with Kabila 
was ripe, but if Kabila did not respond, the rebels would push on. 
``Our troops will continue advancing until we hear from Kabila,'' 
he told reporters. ``It is up to him. We're ready to talk, but we 
cannot wait indefinitely.'' Both Uganda and Rwanda face security threats 
on their western frontiers from rebel groups that have found haven 
in eastern Congo. The statement said Rwanda had expressed concern 
about what it termed ``genocidal attacks'' against minority Tutsis 
living in eastern Congo. ``Naturally, one expects that we have to 
be involved, or we have to be seriously concerned about this situation,'' 
Kagame told The Associated Press last month. ``We just can't sit by 
and watch things happening that affect us like that and just let it 
pass.'' During three months in 1994, extremist Hutu soldiers and militia 
in Rwanda slaughtered at least half a million people, most of them 
minority Tutsis, in a government-sponsored genocide. Tutsi rebels, 
led by Kagame, ousted the Hutu government and ended the massacre. 
``Rwanda has used several fora to explain her concerns about continuing 
insecurity in Rwanda caused by the former Rwandan Armed Forces and 
interahamwe militia based in eastern Congo and supported by Kabila,'' 
the statement said. Rebel military leader Jean-Pierre Ondakane was 
reported to be in Washington for discussions with U.S. officials.
