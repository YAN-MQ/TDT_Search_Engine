Britain's Yarrow Shipbuilders Ltd. has paid an undisclosed sum for 
delays in delivering two missile frigates to Malaysia's navy, outgoing 
naval chief Rear Adm. Ahmad Ramli Nor said Thursday. The shipyard 
had been scheduled to deliver the two warships in March 1996 under 
a 1.4 billion ringgit (dlrs 350 million) deal signed in 1988. Ahmad 
Ramli said Yarrow now has fixed delivery dates for the ships in May 
and August next year. Both sides have cited the sophistication of 
the various systems on board as the main reason for the delays. Ahmad 
Ramli said the navy was confident that the shipyard would be able 
to solve all the problems and deliver the ships as scheduled next 
year. The two frigates are to be fitted with some of the most modern 
weapons available, including the Bofors 40mm cannon and Seawolf air 
defense missiles.
