India will set up the world's first breeding center for Asiatic lions 
near the Taj Mahal by the end of the year, zoo officials said Thursday. 
The population of pure Asiatic lions is slowly dwindling as most of 
the 25 lions in captivity in India are being mated with African lions, 
diluting their gene pool. ``The primary purpose behind setting up 
this breeding center is to meet the rising global demand for purebred 
Asiatic lions,'' said R.L. Singh, chief wildlife warden in the northern 
state of Uttar Pradesh. Singh hoped lions born on this farm can be 
exchanged for rare wildlife species from other states and countries. 
There are as many as 300 Asiatic lions in the Gir reserve forest in 
western India. Under the country's wildlife protection laws, those 
remaining in the wild cannot be taken away for zoos. The proposed 
breeding farm in Agra, 180 kilometers (110 miles) south of New Delhi, 
has been cleared by the Central Zoo Authority of India. It will initially 
have three females and two males, which should produce up to 10 cubs 
within two years, Singh said.
