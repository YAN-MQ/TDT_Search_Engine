Lawyers for Malaysian dissident Anwar Ibrahim still will push for 
his unconditional release following his move from solitary confinement 
to a regular jail, a defense attorney said Thursday. Anwar's eight 
lawyers had asked earlier for his release when he was being detained 
under the Internal Security Act, under which he could be denied visits 
by his lawyers and family. A hearing was set for Oct. 24. That detention 
ended Wednesday when he was shifted from solitary confinement in Kuala 
Lumpur's police headquarters to a prison in the outskirts of the city. 
But the lawyers still plan to seek his outright release, one of them, 
Pawancheek Marican, was quoted as saying by Bernama news agency. Meanwhile, 
Attorney-General Mohtar Abdullah said the prosecution had applied 
to the High Court to fix a trial date for one count of corruption 
and five counts of illegal sex, the New Straits Times daily reported. 
``The prosecution has all the necessary evidence ... for all the 10 
charges against Anwar,'' he said, rejecting speculation that the authorities 
weren't ready to prosecute. A trial on four charges of corruption 
is to begin Nov. 2. Anwar has pleaded innocent to all counts, claiming 
they were trumped up by his political adversaries. Anwar, 51, was 
fired Sept. 2 as deputy prime minister and arrested 18 days later. 
He had clashed with Prime Minister Mahathir Mohamad over economic 
policy before being dismissed for alleged immoral homosexual acts 
and corruption. Mohtar said that if the hearings on the first four 
corruption charges could be completed by November, the prosecution 
would apply for hearing dates for the other charges in December or 
January. Meanwhile, Mahathir was quoted by a newspaper Thursday as 
saying he had thought about abolishing the Internal Security Act, 
the harsh law that was used to arrest Anwar and his supporters. It 
provides for indefinite imprisonment without trial. But he reportedly 
dropped the idea after security forces told him that there was still 
the threat of instability in Malaysia. ``That is why the ISA must 
be maintained, to prevent people from creating chaos in the country 
without seeking justice in the courts,'' Mahathir was quoted as saying 
by The Star newspaper. Activists from the opposition Malaysian People's 
party told Mahathir to stop blaming the security forces for repeatedly 
using the ``draconian and obnoxious'' legislation. ``The decision 
to introduce the ISA was a political one and it now needs the political 
decision of the government to repeal it,'' said the party's president, 
Syed Husin Ali. ``For once, he must take responsibility.'' Speaking 
to thousands at a pro-government rally Wednesday, Mahathir defended 
the Internal Security Act. Referring to demonstrations in the capital 
mounted by Anwar's supporters after his arrest, Mahathir said such 
kinds of behavior justified use of the security law, enacted in 1960 
to combat militant communists. Malaysia has used the sweeping law 
to crack down on hundreds of people, from mechanics to ministers, 
jailing them on charges of threatening national security.
