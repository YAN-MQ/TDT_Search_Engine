NAto officials say Yugoslav President Slobodan Milosevic still has 
a long way to go to prove he's ending his crackdown on ethnic Albanians 
in Kosovo. Milosevic has been given until Saturday to withdraw his 
troops or face NATO air strikes. Officials from the six-nation contact 
group are meeting in Paris today to work out the details of the Kosovo 
peace plan. They're focusing on ground observers, aerial surveillance 
and autonomy talks for the Albanian majority in Kosovo.
