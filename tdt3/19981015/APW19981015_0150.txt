French high school students Thursday were carrying out a nationwide 
day of protests, keeping up their pressure on the leftist government 
to cut class sizes and buy more equipment. About 25,000 students were 
expected to march in Paris, while thousands were expected to rally 
in other cities across France in a third day of protest this week. 
Authorities braced for new violence. Meanwhile a student union leader 
predicted protests at least up to Toussaint vacation at the end of 
next week, unless Education Minister Claude Allegre quickly carries 
out his promises to improve school conditions. ``We'll see what is 
won or not,'' said Thibault Cotta, secretary-general of the Independent 
and Democratic Federation of High Schoolers (FIDL), calling for ``concrete 
action'' by Allegre. ``The students support a movement that can last 
at least until vacation,'' he told France Inter radio. Without progress 
this week, Cotta said his federation would march on the National Assembly 
on Tuesday, the day before a budget vote. Educational reform can't 
happen without ``an increase in the budget to raise the number of 
teachers,'' Cotta said, and he called for dialogue between students 
and education officials. ``That's the beginning of reform.'' He denounced 
violence during marches earlier this week but said that in student 
marches ``things get broken. It's normal. ... We'll try to keep it 
from happening again today.'' After youths smashed store windows and 
damaged cars during marches earlier this week, authorities were advising 
merchants to shutter their shops and motorists not to park their cars 
along march routes. Allegre on Wednesday insisted the government had 
heard the students. ``I think it is logical for the young, when there 
are needs, when there aren't enough teachers, when classrooms are 
overcrowded, to demand good working conditions,'' the minister said 
at the close of the weekly Cabinet meeting. ``I'm doing what I can 
to give this to them,'' he said. At the Cabinet meeting, Allegre presented 
his plan to spread teachers out more equitably around the country, 
a decree that bypasses the parliamentary process. On Tuesday, he said 
the plan aims at ``putting a teacher in front of every student.'' 
He promised that a plan to lighten the course load for high school 
students would be presented next month. Socialist Prime Minister Lionel 
Jospin, himself a former education minister, hailed the plan, saying 
it would bring about ``very rapid improvements.'' Even some teachers 
were beginning to root for protesting students. One of the largest 
teacher's unions called on Tuesday for its members to show solidarity 
with their protesting students.
