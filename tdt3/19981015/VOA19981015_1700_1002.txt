The House of Representatives has condemned the beating death of a 
homosexual college student in Wyoming. But President Clinton and others 
are calling on Congress to do more. The House approved a resolution 
Thursday expressing outrage over the murder of 21-year-old Matthew 
Shepherd who was beaten and left tied to a fence last week. He died 
several days later. Two young men face murder charges in the attack. 
Their girlfriends face accessory to murder charges for trying to get 
rid of evidence. At the White House, President Clinton called on Congress 
to approve a new hate-crimes law, which would make it easier to prosecute 
such offenses against homosexuals. On the U.S. Capital steps Wednesday 
night, Hollywood stars, lawmakers and thousands of others condemned 
the attack. You are tuned to the Voice of America broadcasting from 
Washington. I am Susan Yackie along with Tom Crosby bringing you this 
hour of VOA News Now.
