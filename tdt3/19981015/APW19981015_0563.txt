It has been nearly four months since Anna Kournikova injured her right 
thumb, and she still doesn't feel right on the court. ``I need to 
have some more match experience and get a lot of matches in a row 
to try to get back to where I was before the injury happened,'' Kournikova 
said during a conference call Wednesday to announce she was the ninth 
player to qualify for next month's 16-player Chase Championships at 
Madison Square Garden. The 17-year-old Russian strained ligaments 
in her thumb when she tumbled on a slippery grass court at Eastbourne, 
England, during the quarterfinals against Steffi Graf. Kournikova 
managed to beat Graf, but had to pull out of the semifinals of the 
Wimbledon tuneup. ``After it happened my hand was blue and green,'' 
said Kournikova, who was sidelined for the next two months missing 
Wimbledon. Kournikova returned before the U.S. Open but in the six 
tournaments since, she has not advanced past the quarterfinals. On 
Tuesday, Kournikova lost in the first round at the European Championships 
in Zurich, double-faulting 17 times in her loss to Dominique Van Roost 
of Belgium. Despite her recent troubles, this has been a breakthrough 
season for Kournikova. She cracked the world's top 10 for the first 
time before dropping out and is now No. 12, and she also scored wins 
over six top-10 players this season.
