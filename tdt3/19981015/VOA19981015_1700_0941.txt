Here in Washington, President Clinton just a short while ago announced 
his negotiators have reached a final deal with Congress on an overdue 
$500 billion government spending bill. The important thing that we 
have to recognize is that these hard-fought battles and major accomplishments 
represent, finally, in eight days what we did not have for eight months. 
We were able to put the progress of the country ahead of partisanship. 
We were able to put people ahead of politics. The Budget Bill among 
other things includes the Clinton Administration's request for $18 
billion for the International Monetary Fund, but with Republican conditions 
that the IMF take some steps to make its operations more open and 
effective. The Bill authorizes a separate spending package for Bosnia 
peacekeeping, defense readiness and disaster aid for American farmers. 
The House of Representatives and the Senate are expected to approve 
the legislation before the end of the week.
