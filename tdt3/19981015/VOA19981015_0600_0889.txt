the Korean Peninsula by preparing for military exercises with South 
Korea. The official Korean News Central Agency said Washington is 
seeking to use the maneuvers to prepare for a new war in the 21st 
Century. The report also critiqued the United States and South Korea 
for scheduling the talks just days after the next round of four party 
Korean peace talks. The four-party talks which include both Koreas, 
China and the United States will begin on October 21st in Geneva.
