A new report by the European Union compares and examines the various 
schemes that it's 15 member nations adopted to reduce high unemployment. 
VOA correspondent Ron Penstine reports from Brussels efforts have 
been widely mixed. Spain has the highest unemployment rate in the 
European Union. 18.9 percent of the Spanish workforce cannot find 
a job. In it's efforts to combat unemployment, the European Union 
says Spain has one of the best strategies. Nearly one million Spaniards 
will benefit from job creation efforts. Portugal and France also are 
praised by the European Union for their national plans aimed at dealing 
with unemployment. On the other hand, the Unions report criticizes 
efforts made by Germany's outgoing government, and by Greece. Perak 
Flynn is he European Union Commissioner in charge of social policies, 
he says all the members are making an effort to improve. All of the 
member states, all of them now, are onboard in this. And that is really 
the message we want to leave. Nobody is shirking their responsibility 
or seeking not to satisfy the commitments for the European targets. 
Mr. Flynn says Europe suffers in comparison to the United States, 
in the amount of people it puts to work. We are not dissimilar to 
the United States, in so far as agriculture, or manufacturing, or 
the public sector is concerned, but we're way behind in so far as 
employment in the services sector. And here I am talking about communal 
services and business and distribution and all questions of hotels 
and leisure and restaurant. We are way behind the United States in 
these things. The employment rate measures the amount of people working 
and the potential labor force which is not working. Europe and the 
United States used to have similar rates 20 years ago, the European 
Union hopes to make up the gap in job creation. Ron Penstine VOA News,
