Let's hope that Evan Dunsky's gleefully paranoid comedy ``The Alarmist'' 
doesn't give some unscrupulous salesman of the kind found in a David 
Mamet play any ideas for devilish new scams. Imagine a company dealing 
in home security systems that drums up business by finding out when 
potential customers are going to be out of the house, breaks into 
their homes to create a panic, then aggressively peddles its wares 
to the neighborhood's frightened residents. Sometimes the company 
even stages bogus semi-break-ins when customers are at home to terrorize 
them into making costly impulse purchases. The weasel behind this 
operation is Heinrich Grigoris (Stanley Tucci). a slick, high-powered 
salesman. In one of the subtlest, most delicious performances of his 
career, Tucci imbues this unsavory character with enough sleazy, back-slapping 
charm and man-to-man ``sincerity'' to make you begin to see the world 
through his unapologetically larcenous eyes. Actually, ``The Alarmist'' 
sees the world through two pairs of eyes. One belongs to Heinrich; 
the other to his ingenuous eager-beaver protege and star salesman 
Tommy Hudler (David Arquette). Tommy is the epitome of a tail-wagging 
gung-ho young salesman, but he is also an almost nauseatingly straight 
arrow. One evening when he and his boss are driving around Los Angeles 
after having downed a few cocktails, Heinrich insists they stop in 
front of a well-appointed red-brick house. To his protege's shock, 
Heinrich blithely skips up to the front door and kicks it in, setting 
off a cacaphony of alarms, then dashes back to the car like a little 
kid who's just pulled off a triumphant prank. The movie, adapted from 
Keith Reddin's play ``Life During Wartime,'' isn't just about thievery 
and shady business ethics. It is also a free-floating satire of various 
modes of American looniness, Southern California style. In scenes 
that suggest a no-fault late-'90s variation of ``The Graduate,'' Tommy 
embarks on an affair with Gale Ancona (Kate Capshaw), an attractive 
40ish divorcee who becomes his first major customer. Gale has a teen-age 
son, Howard (Ryan Reynolds), who is only a few years younger than 
Tommy. Some of the movie's squirmier scenes find Tommy awkwardly trying 
to playing surrogate father to a boy who turns out to be more sophisticated 
than he is. Tommy and Gale have sharply clashing notions about the 
meaning of their relationship. The emotionally myopic young salesman 
insists that Kate is his true love and dreams of marrying her. To 
Gale, he is nothing more than some pleasant recreational sex. Their 
points of views collide when Tommy coerces a reluctant Kate into meeting 
his family, and in an extremely funny sequence that reveals Ms. Capshaw's 
skills at deadpan comedy, Gale retaliates by making outrageously inappropriate 
sexual remarks that leave Tommy's family cowering in embarrassment. 
But shortly after the halfway point, ``The Alarmist'' takes a dramatic 
U-turn into a murder mystery in which Tommy suspects his boss of being 
the killer. At this point a movie that succeeded as a light, loopy 
satire of sex, salesmanship, shoddy ethics, gun nuts and geeky teen-agers 
finds itself seriously in over its head. Unable to decide where to 
go or what tone to adopt, it ends up treading water. PRODUCTION NOTES:
