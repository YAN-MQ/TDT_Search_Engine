A-gays look good in the shower, so ``All the Rage'' opens with close-ups 
of soaping up and rinsing, with beads of water thrilled to be on such 
perfect gym-toned skin. A-gays have fabulous kitchens, work out religiously 
(``Today I do chest and arms''), have windowed offices on high floors 
and sneer when someone sends roses after the first date (and to the 
office! with a note! that he signed!). A-gays know who they are. Taking 
a critical look at this subculture of affluent, urban, meticulously 
groomed, self-satisfied gay men who consider themselves on the A-list 
in their particular cities is a pretty brave idea. It's easy to see 
how ``All the Rage,'' which is Roland Tec's feature-film debut as 
director, producer, writer and composer, could become a film festival 
favorite. But out in the real world, it doesn't have much to offer 
beyond its concept. Neither the performances nor the script are up 
to the challenge of a meaningful social issue. The film is the story 
of Christopher Bedford (John-Michael Lander), a very good-looking 
31-year-old lawyer whose worldview is a little shaken when he falls 
for a guy who would never make the A-list. Stewart (David Vincent) 
is an editor (that's one strike against him because of publishing's 
low pay), doesn't give much thought to his wardrobe and, my God, doesn't 
even have a gym. Larry, Christopher's friend and co-worker, actually 
says, ``Are you telling me you went out with a guy who doesn't work 
out?'' That line says a lot about the film's self-consciously clever, 
proud-to-be-superficial characters. One scene begins with a man in 
couples counseling telling the therapist: ``That's why I was mad. 
It had nothing to do with the fig torte.'' In a discussion of the 
pros and cons of latching onto a rich boyfriend, the lead character 
announces, ``Queens who live in glass houses shouldn't throw stones, 
dear.'' (A minute later he adds, ``You didn't exactly marry a pauper.'' 
But he pronounces the last word very close to ``popper,'' suggesting 
a pretty bizarre image.) But when a plot point needs to be made, all 
the cleverness flies out the window and earnest literalness flies 
in. Christopher, for instance, sums up his character's problem, and 
what the film suggests may be a culturewide shallowness, in a bedroom 
scene _ not with Stewart, incidentally. ``Everybody wants me,'' he 
says. ``So why should I want you?'' The good thing about ``All the 
Rage,'' and this deserves applause, is that it shows men casually 
touching, dancing, hugging, kissing _ and not just in sexual encounters 
_ as naturally as heterosexual couples on screen always have. It's 
a reminder of how natural some of Tom Hanks' scenes with Antonio Banderas 
in ``Philadelphia'' weren't. PRODUCTION NOTES: ALL THE RAGE Written,
