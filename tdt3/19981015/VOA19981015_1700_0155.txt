the international community is stepping up pressure on Yugoslav authorities 
to pull their forces out of Serbia's Kosovo province. As agreed earlier 
this week. The six nation contact group on Yugoslavia, the United 
States, it's main NATO partners, and Russia have agreed to make sure 
ethnic Albanians in Kosovo can return to their homes safely. Julian 
Nundy* reports from Paris. Meeting just 48 hours before NATO's ultimatum 
to Belgrade runs out, the six members of the contact group welcomed 
Yugoslav President Slobadan Milosevic's agreement to the proposed 
settlement in Kosovo. Mr. Milosevic agreed to withdraw forces from 
the province in meetings with the United States envoy, Richard Holbrooke. 
Reviewing this agreement, the main Western powers and Russia agreed 
that it is now important to enforce measures to implement that accord. 
Several of the foreign ministers attending the Paris conference said 
the only real test was the speedy return of refugees to their homes 
and conditions of safety and trust. Russia's foreign minister, Igor 
Ivanhoff* and Hebert Redrine* of France both said the next step should 
be a new United Nations Security Council resolution to underline international 
support for a settlement. The resolution would lay down terms for 
surveillance and troop withdrawals and steps towards a degree of self-rule 
in the province. Julian Nundy for VOA News Paris.
