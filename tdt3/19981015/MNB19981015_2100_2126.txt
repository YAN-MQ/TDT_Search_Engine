When we come back this evening, a hidden camera investigation from 
"dateline NBC" -- how not to get burned when looking for an inexpensive 
way to take to the sky. You could accompany your data on its trip 
overseas the experience would be alarming. Local carriers handing 
it to national carriers over to cable carriers... till you don't know 
who has your data. Unless you send it through here. With the one and 
only company that owns the entire network-- local, national, and international. 
So you know who has your data. On-net. From MCI Worldcom. Gee...that 
oatmeal was little... ya done with those sausages? Ya done with them 
hash browns? You need some help with that bacon? How'd I get heartburn? 
All I had was oatmeal. Got any Mylanta? Are you kidding? Aluminum 
and magnesium? You want tums. Tums has calcium. Tums' calcium knocks 
out heartburn fast. Then goes to your bones to help keep them stronger, 
longer. How about a bag of donuts for the road? How about a bottle 
of tum ta tum tum tums.
