Prime Minister Phan Van Khai will visit China Oct. 19-23 at the invitation 
of Premier Zhu Rongji, according to a Foreign Affairs statement. The 
statement, issued Wednesday and published in local media Thursday, 
did not indicate what topics that Khai hopes to address. Despite several 
unresolved issues, including territorial rights over the Spratly and 
Paracel islands, commerce between the two former enemies has been 
rising in recent years. A 1991 agreement normalized relations for 
the first time since the Chinese attacked 10 days after Vietnam invaded 
Cambodia in 1979.
