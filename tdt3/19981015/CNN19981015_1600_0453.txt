A U.S. Marine has been charged in the hit-and-run death of a high 
school student in Japan. The incident is renewing tension between 
okinawa residents and the Marines stationed there. Island residents 
have staged demonstrations since the accident last week, calling on 
the U.S. to turn corporal Randall eskridge over to local authorities. 
A 1995 agreement requires the United States to hand over service personnel 
suspected in heinous crimes. The Marines claim a hit-and-run is not 
a heinous crime as defined by the agreement.
