John McEnroe says Davis Cup tennis is at its ``lowest point in history'' 
and he couldn't become the United States' captain because it might 
involve begging to Pete Sampras. ``Tennis has become a joke in the 
Davis Cup and the Olympics,'' McEnroe said Thursday at the Champions 
senior tour event. ``It just doesn't seem the players ultimately care 
about playing. That I never will understand. Considering the amount 
of money and all the attention they get from the game, you'd think 
they'd at least want to represent their country for four weeks a year 
maximum.'' McEnroe said it would be too difficult for him to play 
a direct role in lifting Davis Cup out of the doldrums. ``I guess 
I'd have to get on my knees and beg Sampras to play, which is one 
reason I don't want to take the job (as U.S. captain),'' McEnroe said. 
``I can't imagine bending that low.'' Meanwhile McEnroe, who once 
wrote off Pat Rafter as a one slam wonder, now says the two-time US 
Open title winner is a potential world No.1. But McEnroe believes 
the feature that endears Rafter most to his fellow Australians, his 
nice guy approach, may prove his nemesis. McEnroe said after Rafter's 
1997 US Open title that he did not expect the No. 2-ranked player 
to back it up with a second. ``The way it appears right now, he's 
got a real good opportunity to be potentially the best player in the 
world,'' McEnroe said. Rafter slumped after his 1997 win but was back 
to his best form in time to defend his title at Flushing Meadows last 
month. ``The question is how he reacts this time,'' said McEnroe. 
``Clearly, when you've won two straight, you're going to be favorite 
next time.'' He described Rafter as a popular player who cared about 
his friendships _ and it was not meant as a compliment. ``When you 
care about your friendships sometimes you're not as mean as you need 
to be maybe on the court,'' said McEnroe, known through his career 
as Superbrat.
