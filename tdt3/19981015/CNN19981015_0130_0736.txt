A General Motors plant in Janesville, Wisconsin, is taking action 
to avoid a labor shortage Thursday night. The problem isn't wages, 
it's football. The green bay Packers are playing a rare Thursday night 
game so plant managers are setting up about 100 televisions, to allow 
employees to watch the game at work. When the Packers played on a 
Monday night last week, 140 employees simply didn't show up, shutting 
the plant down.
