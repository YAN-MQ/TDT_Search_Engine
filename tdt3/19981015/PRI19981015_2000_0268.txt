in coalition talks to form a new government, Germany's Social Democrats 
and the Green Party agreed on a plan to shut down the nation's nuclear 
power plants. From Berlin, NPR's Edward Lifson reports. Yurgan Tretine 
of the Greens who is slated to become Germany's next Minister of the 
Environment said today that within one year the new government will 
begin talks with the nuclear industry about when to shut down Germany's 
19 nuclear plants. The government hopes to avoid forced closings and 
damage claims. The utilities have already threatened to file lawsuits. 
Some of the atomic plants here are old anyway and nearing the end 
of their useful runs. Others might have lasted the next 45 years. 
Germany gets about one-third of its electricity from nuclear power. 
The Greens and the Social Democrats are also trying to decide how 
high to raise taxes on fossil fuels. The coalition talks are expected 
to be wrapped up this week and on October 27th, the Center Left government 
with Social Democrat Gerhard Schroeder as chancellor is expected to 
be sworn in. Edward Lifson, NPR News, Berlin.
