I am Dave Deforest VOA News. President Clinton has opened a crucial 
middle-east summit by urging Palestinian and Israeli leaders to break 
the deadlock over Israel's next West Bank pull out. At the White House, 
Mr. Clinton said too much time has already been lost and neither side 
can expect to win every disputed point. The summit is aimed at ending 
the impasse in the talks for interim security deal. VOA's David Collest* 
has the report from the White House. The Middle East leaders went 
to the secluded Y River Conference site after hearing an appeal from 
President Clinton to summon the courage and vision needed for a final 
settlement. The peace process has been stalled for a year and a half 
over terms of another Israeli troop withdrawal in the West Bank. Mr. 
Netanyahu told reporters the pull back must be linked to effective 
action by the Palestinian authority against anti Israel extremists. 
Any movement to give them additional land is premise on their fighting 
terrorism. As I said in word and in deed. Mr. Arafat countered that 
there can be no absolute guarantee against attacks. I can give 100 
percent report, but no one in the world can give 100 percent result. 
President has cut back domestic travel plans in order to be available 
to join in the talks, which are expected to run through Sunday. David 
Collest, VOA News. The White House.
