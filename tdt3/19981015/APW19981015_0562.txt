The advisory board of Thyssen on Thursday unanimously approved a merger 
with its longtime competitor Krupp, in a deal that will create one 
of Europe's largest companies. Krupp approved the deal earlier this 
week. The merger has been approved by European Union officials but 
also requires a vote by stockholders and is expected to take effect 
next March. The combined company would be Germany's fifth largest 
industrial concern, behind electronics giant Siemens and carmaker 
Volkswagen, employing 180,000 people with 70 billion marks (dlrs 38 
billion) in annual sales. Last year, the two companies merged their 
steel operations to create Europe's largest steelmaker, in a move 
that led to talks on a full merger. Thyssen AG, based in Duesseldorf, 
has operations in capital goods, manufactured products, trading and 
services, in addition to steel. Krupp AG Hoesch-Krupp resulted from 
the merger of German steel and engineering groups Krupp AG and Hoesch 
AG in December 1992.
