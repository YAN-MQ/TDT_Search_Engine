Israeli prime minister Benjamin Netanyahu says he is prepared to go 
a long way to sign a peace agreement with the Palestinians if his 
country's security demands are met. Netanyahu will meet with Palestinian 
leader Yasser Arafat and President Clinton in Washington Thursday. 
Andrea Koppel has more on expectations for the summit. At the end 
of this week's summit with prime minister Netanyahu and chairman Arafat 
CNN has learned top negotiators expect they will have a deal. This 
despite Tuesday's murder of an Israeli by a suspected Palestinian 
gunman and last weekend's appointment of Israeli hard-liner ariel 
Sharon as foreign minister that have cast an uncertain shadow over 
talks at the wye plantation in Maryland. I'm sometimes tempted to 
ask, maybe we should call it the how plantation, not the wye plantation 
because there are still many, many questions out there which remain 
to be solved. At the core of any Israeli-Palestinian breakthrough 
would be a land for security agreement in which prime minister Netanyahu 
would promise to hand over 13% of West Bank land in exchange for iron-clad 
Palestinian commitments to fight terrorism, specifically to destroy 
the infrastructure of the Hamas Islamic militants. But chief Palestinian 
negotiator saeb erakat says Netanyahu's demand is unreasonable. President 
Arafat's policy is very well known. The Palestinian authority's policy 
is that of a zero tolerance to terror or violence whether committed 
by Palestinians or Israelis. All of these issues are well known to 
Washington attorney Joel singer who in 1993 helped write and later 
witnessed the signing of the Oslo peace accord, an agreement they're 
still negotiating today. Normally the United States president does 
not convene a trilateral summit meeting if all three parties do not 
understand very well that there will be an agreement. And with Oslo 
expiring next may that's certainly the U.S. hope. That by bringing 
Netanyahu and Arafat together for four days of intensive talks they'll 
show the political will necessary to close a deal. Andrea Koppel,
