Jerome Jurenovich, "Headline Sports." The NFL weekend kicks off a 
bit early tonight as the Packers look to get back in the win column 
after that humbling at home against the Vikings. Green bay is at Detroit 
where only once in the last five years have the two teams not split 
their season series. If we don't play very good, we won't beat anyone. 
And I said that in my press conference after the game. And when I 
watched the film the next day, I felt the same way. We just didn't 
play very well. I'm sure they're going to come in here with a lot 
to prove, you know, being beat at home. No question they had a home 
winning streak up here that got beaten. They need to win as well as 
we do. Batch, by the way, has far more impressive numbers in comparison 
to his more-heralded and higher-drafted fellow Rookie quarterbacks 
-- Peyton Manning and Ryan leaf. Manning's Colts lost to the bills 
last week in a game in which the NFL felt Bruce Smith went a little 
too far in trying to get to the Rookie quarterback. He was fined $7,500 
for this lunging hit.
