This is meteorologist Valerie Voss with your "Headline News weather" 
forecast through Friday. A strong low pressure center will move slowly 
toward the plains states, producing windy, wet weather out ahead of 
it and plenty of snow behind it. Some of the mountains of Utah could 
see as much as two feet of snow before it's all over with. Meanwhile, 
high pressure builds to the east coast. Those rain showers in the 
northeast should ease with time. Temperature-wise, look for 40s and 
50s over the northern third of the country today. Mostly 80s across 
the south. It will be cooler in the southwest. Looking ahead to Saturday, 
look for rain and thunderstorms through the central U.S., with showers 
in the northwest. That cool air will be building into the plains states. 
Ahead of it, showers and storms from the Great Lakes to Texas on Sunday. 
And finally, for Monday, a few lingering showers again in the northeast. 
Scattered thunderstorms through the south. A few showers will push 
into the northwest. We'll see just 40s and 50s over the northern plains 
states.
