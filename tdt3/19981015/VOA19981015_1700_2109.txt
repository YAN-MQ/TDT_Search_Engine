The White House and Congress have reached a final deal on a $500 billion 
government-spending bill, which will define issues for lawmakers in 
the November elections. Both President Clinton and the Republican 
leaders of Congress are claiming victory. Mr. Clinton hailed an initiative 
to hire 100,000 new teachers and $18 billion for the International 
Monetary Fund. We were able to put the progress of the country ahead 
of partisanship. We were able to put people ahead of politics. Republicans 
took credit for funds to fight illegal drugs and more funding to boost 
military readiness. I am Dave DeForest, VOA News.
