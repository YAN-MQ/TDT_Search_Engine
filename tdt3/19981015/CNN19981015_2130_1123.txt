Merrill Lynch is planning an Internet lure. The nation's largest brokerage 
firm says it will offer free access to its stock research on the world 
wide web. Merrill Lynch says the move does not refute its stance against 
do-it-yourself online trading. In fact, the company hopes to use what 
it learns to generate leads for its full-service brokers. The service 
will be offered for a four-month trial period.
