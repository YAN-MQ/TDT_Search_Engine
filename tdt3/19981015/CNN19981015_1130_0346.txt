Assuming another person's identity to commit fraud could become a 
federal crime. Under a Bill passed yesterday, using a person's name, 
address, birthdate and social security number without per mission 
to obtain credit cards and open bank accounts would be considered 
identity theft. The measure still requires the president's approval. 
Officials say 40,000 people every year are victims of identity theft.
