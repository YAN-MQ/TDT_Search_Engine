That was Katie couric's interview with Oprah Winfrey from "today." 
When we come back here tonight, a look at tomorrow's newspaper headlines. 
I didn't need a wimpy laptop. I needed a desktop that travels. They 
said, "do you like movies?" And I said "are you talking to me?" Introducing 
your:)ware technology that grows with you. When you cl 1-800-gateway 
we can custom-build you a portable desktop with an Intel Pentium II 
processor and a dvd drive for movies. All for just $87 a month. And 
in two years you can trade it in toward the purchase of a new one. 
: I love this part. : me too. Call us, and let's talk about your:)ware 
from gateway. Man: mud holes. Dirt roads. Most people wouldn't think 
of driving through stuff like that. But then, that's the beauty of 
Subaru all-wheel drive. It automatically transfers power from the 
wheel that slip to the wheels that grip. Which means it does the thinking 
for you. Sorry mate... guess I wasn't thinkin'.
