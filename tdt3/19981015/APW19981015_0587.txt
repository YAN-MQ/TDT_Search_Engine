An Iraqi girl who was treated in Scotland for leukemia arrived home 
Thursday. The 4-year-old Mariam Hamza, who has lost her hair from 
chemotherapy, was accompanied by her grandmother and the British member 
of parliament, George Galloway, who took her to Scotland in April 
and raised the funds for her treatment. ``Mariam is well now, thank 
God, they all took good care of her (in Britain) and they all hoped 
for sanctions to be lifted,'' her grandmother, Faten Hamid, said with 
tears in her eyes. Mariam's group arrived at al-Rashid military airport 
on a private plane from Amman, Jordan. The plane had been granted 
an exemption from U.N. sanctions on air travel to Baghdad to spare 
her the 10-hour drive across the desert. ``This is one of the happiest 
days of my life,'' Galloway said. ``When we left here six months ago, 
this child was at death's door.'' Mariam's father, Hamza Abid Mita'b, 
met her at the airport. ``I hope the happiness which I feel now will 
be for all Iraqi parents with sick children,'' he said, his voice 
choking with emotion. Galloway, a member of the Labor Party, has long 
campaigned for the lifting of the sanctions imposed on Iraq after 
its 1990 invasion of Kuwait. The U.N. Security Council has said the 
sanctions will be lifted once Iraq has shown that it has eliminated 
all its long-range missiles and weapons of mass destruction. The legislator 
had arranged for Mariam to be treated in Scotland. He has said he 
wanted to highlight the plight of the Iraqi public under the embargo. 
An Iraqi-British physician, Foutouh Binyamin, who accompanied Mariam 
to Jordan, said Wednesday that her cancer was in remission and she 
was recovering.
