As the International Contact Group on the Balkans meets in Paris Britain 
has sending an advanced team to Kosovo today to help organize the 
monitoring of the planned Serb military pull-out there. VOA correspondent 
Laurie Gaspman reports Britain ultimately expects to provide one tenth 
of the 2,000 foreign inspectors. Britain is not wasting any time in 
providing personnel for the Kosovo verification mission. British Foreign 
Secretary Robin Cook says an advance team is ready to leave this week 
for Kosovo. Another 150 inspectors will go within the next two weeks. 
They will people of caliber, people to give this mission the eyes 
and ears which the International Community needs to make sure we keep 
tabs on President Milosevic. The British Contingent will be the first 
wave of an air and ground monitoring mission to verify that Yugoslavia's 
President is fulfilling his promise to pull Serb special forces from 
Kosovo, and let the displaced return to their homes there. US Special 
Envoy Richard Holbrooke brokered the agreement in marathon negotiating 
sessions and backed by NATO's threat of military action. British Defense 
Secretary George Robertson says the twin track strategy has worked 
out, but the crisis is not over yet. We've pulled back, uh, the reckless 
adventurism, uh, that was involved here from the precipice and that 
was only achieved because there was resolution and determination and 
because military force was there to be used had it been necessary. 
Mr. Robertson says British aircraft will also take part in the surveillance 
flights over Kosovo. Foreign Secretary Cook also intends to push for 
UN Security Council resolution endorsing the agreement on Kosovo, 
in order to give it even more clout. The British minister will travel 
to countries neighboring Kosovo and to NATO's command control center 
being set up in Macedonia. Laurie Gaspman VOA News, London.
