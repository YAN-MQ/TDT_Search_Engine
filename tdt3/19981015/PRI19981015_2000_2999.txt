And now, the news we've been waiting for all week, your nominees for 
the Nobel Peace prize which is officially announced tomorrow. Elizabeth 
Athley of Portland, Oregon wrote that peace is a process best served 
not by politicians but by personal examples. She nominated an English 
woman in Portland, Yvonne Simpson who lives on next to nothing herself 
and in the past several years has taken several tons of humanitarian 
aid to the former Yugoslavia, on four separate missions at sometimes 
great personal peril. Michael Freeman of Los Angeles thought that 
world peace is best left in the hands of skilled and innovative politicians 
and the best of them, he feels, is his nominee, Tony Blair, Prime 
Minister of Great Britain. "We have to applaud the man who has revolutionized 
the British government," he writes, "who is focused on solving problems 
rather than sticking blindly to conservative or leftist ideology." 
Mr. Daniel Rushwald said that the peace prize should go rather to 
the Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu. Now the Middle East 
and Northern Ireland were the two areas where most of you felt peace 
was being made and peace prize winners should be found, although we 
did get this call for Bishop Samuel Ruis of de las Casas in the beleaguered 
southern Mexican state of Chopas. He's tried to mediate peace in that 
area and putting his life on the line. There have been attacks on 
his life and he's in the tradition of archbishop Romero of El Salvador 
and Bishop Cherariti of Guatemala. Perhaps the Nobel Peace prize might 
give him some protection. Two other significant runner ups included 
Dr. Helen Kaldecott for her work on nuclear disarmament and Jimmy 
Carter and the Carter Institute for good deeds in America and around 
the world. But, your choice, by a landslide, the winner of our First 
World Peoples Choice Nobel Prize for Peace is William Jefferson Clinton. 
To quote one of his many supporters, Jay Hedgee of St. Louis, Missouri, 
"Say what you will, his achievements in Haiti, Bosnia, the Middle 
East and Northern Ireland have made the world a better place. He's 
continued to creatively engage Russia in economic and strategic matters. 
At home, he's been a healer of racial and economic tensions. Mr. Clinton's 
no saint but he certainly is extraordinary and deserves the Nobel 
prize." We'll have the official winner tomorrow.
