If you want to refinance your home, it's going to cost just a little 
more. Average mortgage rates recorded their biggest increase of the 
year this week. The 30-year fixed rate climbed to 6.9%. while the 
15-year fixed rate rose to 6.56%. and the one-year adjustable edged 
up to 5.54%. still, rates remain near 30-year lows.
