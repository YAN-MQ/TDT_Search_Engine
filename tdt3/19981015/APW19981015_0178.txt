Efforts by the world's poorest countries to join the economic mainstream 
risk being derailed by natural disasters and world depression, according 
to a report released Thursday by the U.N. trade and development agency. 
But they should not give up those efforts, the U.N. Conference on 
Trade and Development warned in its annual Least Developed Countries 
Report. Of the 48 countries classed as the world's least developed, 
33 of them are in Africa. Although most African countries' economies 
showed healthy growth last year, some stumbled due to disasters caused 
by the El Nino weather phenomenon and the falling price of commodities 
central to their economy, the report said. Their prospects will improve 
if European economies stay strong and South Africa picks up, it added. 
But the Asian crisis and its knock-on effects are likely to squeeze 
the very poorest countries as foreign financing dries up, the report 
added. The 210-page study provided no specific prediction for growth, 
because of world economic uncertainty and the unpredictability of 
the kind of shocks caused by El Nino. ``No one in his right mind would 
want to hazard a guess beyond the next few days'' at the moment, senior 
UNCTAD official Andrew Whitley told a news conference. The effects 
of floods which covered much of Bangladesh, torrential rain in Bhutan, 
Nepal and Sudan, and hurricane damage in Haiti ``may take years to 
repair and may forestall growth in the foreseeable future,'' UNCTAD 
secretary-general Rubens Ricupero conceded. The report singled out 
Bangladesh's growth rate of 5.7 percent last year, with a strong farming 
sector, as a hopeful Asian performance.
