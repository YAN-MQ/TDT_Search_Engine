Mexican officials have lowered the casualty toll from Tuesdays' explosion 
at a Mexico City suburb to 6 dead and 35 injured. The initial death 
toll was thought to be 16. The blast occurred in the town of Toltepec 
about 30 kilometers North of the Capital. It leveled at least nine 
houses and damaged dozens more. Officials say the results of their 
investigation into the blast should be known soon. Witnesses to the 
explosion say they smelled gun powder, but many residences say they 
believe the blast by a gas leak. Some local news reports say there 
are also several illegal in-home fireworks factories in the area.
