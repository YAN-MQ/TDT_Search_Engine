A top Indian diplomat has arrived in Pakistan for three days of high-level 
talks with his Pakistani counterpart, starting Friday. VOA's correspondent, 
Douglas Beckshan*, has the report from Islamovan*. Indian foreign 
secretary Kava Gunaut* says he is entering the talks with a positive 
approach. He told reporters at Isglomabad* Airport that he hopes the 
talks will help to build trust and confidence. Pakistani Foreign Secretary 
Sham Shadam* said for his part, says that South Asia has been nuclearized 
and this presents a new challenge to Pakistan and India. He says they 
should seek to prevent war as well as any potential arms race. Pakistan 
and India conducted nuclear tests in May facing fears of a nuclear 
arms race. Analysts say the two nations are under international pressure 
to talk in the wake of the tests. The Foreign Secretaries are to take 
up matters including peace and security in Kashmire, the disputed 
territory over which Pakistan and India have fought two wars. The 
foreign secretary dialogue is resuming after a one year standoff.
