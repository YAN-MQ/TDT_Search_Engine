There's also been a lot of talk about the effect of school Yun uniforms. 
Do they really affect attitude? We asked ABC's Jane Clayson to take 
a look. Since students in the long beach, California, school district 
started wearing uniforms seven years ago, there has been a remarkable 
change in their behavior. When everybody is dressed the same, they 
don't have to worry about "how I look today" -- are they wearing the 
right colors or wrong colors. They don't really have a source of conflict 
with the other kids. That means no more gang colors in the schoolyard. 
No more expensive jewelry and tennis shoes to fight over. And here 
in long beach, the stunning results -- a 90% drop in assaults, thefts 
and weapon and drug violations. Police say crime is down even off 
campus before and after school. The largest school districts in the 
country are institute ing uniform policies and in most cases, youth 
crime has declined. In Boston -- It's probably one of the most successful 
things we've done. In Harlem -- There's a sense of purpose and discipline. 
And in Los Angeles -- They behave, and once kids behave I can start 
teaching. And it's not just about school safety. Some educators believe 
uniforms actually contribute to higher academic achievement because 
students are not so distracted by what they're wearing. There is mixed 
reaction to uniforms among the kids. Everyone looks the same, so nobody 
picks on you that you're wearing a bad outfit. I don't like them because 
a lot of people like to be original and not wear the same thing all 
the time. But among teachers and administrators who have seen it work, 
uniforms are a simple way to make a very big difference in the classroom.
