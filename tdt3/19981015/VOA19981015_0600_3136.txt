A senior United Nations official says the problem of poverty must 
be addressed in any reform of the international financial system. 
Speaking in Washington, Wednesday, UN Development Program Administrator 
James Gustav-Spethe warned that economic globalization could be in 
danger, if poverty continues to spread. Mr. Spethe says the current 
world economic crisis has already pushed 150 million people into poverty 
in the former Soviet Union. He says in Indonesia it has resulted in 
8 million children dropping out of school. The UN official says the 
goals of peace and stability in the world will not be realized if 
poverty continues to spread.
