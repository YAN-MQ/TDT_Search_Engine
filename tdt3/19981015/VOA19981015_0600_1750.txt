In Mesina Sicily there was a startling moment at a wedding, when the 
groom was asked if he would take his bride to be his lawfully wedded 
wife, he answered I don't. The reason was, that the night before he 
had returned from a bachelor party to find his fiancee in the arms 
of another man, who had been scheduled to be a witness at the marriage 
ceremony, the marriage did not take place, but the groom invited the 
shocked guests to go ahead and have the wedding breakfast anyway, 
at his expense. That's a good sport.
