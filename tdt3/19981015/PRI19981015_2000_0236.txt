A six member jury was sworn in today in Miami to hear a $500 billion 
lawsuit against the tobacco industry. It took 16 weeks to settle on 
the four man, two woman jury and the other ten people who were serve 
as alternates. The trial is expected to take about three months. Smokers 
will argue that cigarette makers knew that cigarettes were dangerous 
and addictive and lied to hide those facts from the American people. 
The industry says smokers have known about the dangers of smoking 
for decades and that millions of people have successfully quit.
