Recent record-low mortgage rates have been fueling the housing market. 
A Spike in interest rates last week lifted the average rate on 30-year 
fixed rate mortgages to 6.9%. and that is up almost half a point from 
the week before. John metaxas offers some advice on how to maximize 
the advantage. Volatility in the mortgage market can be very costly 
if your timing is bad. Consider this -- on Tuesday, October 6th, the 
average 30-year mortgage rate reached a low of 6.58%. but within five 
business days, it had bounced up more than half a point, to 7.1%. 
on a $150,000 loan, that change would have cost you $52 a month, or 
more than $18,000 over 30 years. Borrowers can protect themselves 
from interest rate moves like this by locking in their mortgage rate 
before closing. You can lock in anytime you apply for a mortgage or 
anytime after that point up until three to five days before you close, 
depending on the lending institution you apply with. Most lenders 
will let you choose when to lock in your rate. But the length of time 
they will guarantee the rate varies. Most will lock in for 60 days 
at no expense to the client. If you're going beyond a 60-day time 
frame, most of the lenders want a fee. Other lenders offer what is 
known as a float down. If you lock in, and rates move up, your rate 
will not increase. But if rates move down, you'll get a slightly lower 
rate. Of course locking in can deprive you of the full benefit if 
rates decline. But mortgage brokers say if you find a rate that makes 
financial sense, grab it. No one can accurately predict where rates 
are going. That's "your money." John metaxas, CNN.
