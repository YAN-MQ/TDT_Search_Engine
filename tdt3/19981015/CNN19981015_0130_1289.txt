The padres made it to the world series after dwooeting the Braves 
in game six of the nlcs. Sterling, hitchcock and four others combined 
on the two-hitter. It comes down to the pitching. Last game, hitchcock. 
I can't say enough about what he did. Through the whole postseason, 
he to go against Johnson, Maddux, glavine. He gave us what we needed 
on three days' rest. For the organization and the city of San Diego, 
we've all -- we've waited a long time. The fact we're going to the 
world series again is great. But I'm going to tell you now, we want 
to win it.
