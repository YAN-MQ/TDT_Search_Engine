Military authorities in Sri Lanka say the past two of weeks of fierce 
battles in the North, have left at least 113 Tamil Tiger rebels and 
57 soldiers dead. A spokesman told the news conference in Colombo 
today that the battles occurred around Monkolum town on a strategic 
highway linking the Northern Jaffna Peninsula with the rest of the 
country. The Army captured Monkolum last month but lost another key 
town, Kilinochchi farther North.
