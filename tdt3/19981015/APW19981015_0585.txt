GENEVA (AP) _ NATO should demonstrate with airstrikes its seriousness 
in pressing Yugoslav President Slobodan Milosevic to meet international 
demands on Kosovo, a political representative of the separatist Kosovo 
Liberation Army said Thursday. ``There must be strikes because Milosevic 
knows no language other than force,'' Swiss-based representative Bardhyl 
Mahmuti told reporters. He accused Milosevic of building up forces 
in Kosovo and defying the conditions of the accord reached this week 
with U.S. envoy Richard Holbrooke to end turmoil in the troubled Yugoslav 
province. ``The agreement reached between Milosevic and Holbrooke 
only serves Milosevic,'' Mahmuti said. ``There's no real progress 
on the ground.'' ``There can be no bargaining on our demands,'' Mahmuti 
said, referring to the KLA's demand for full Kosovo independence. 
``No one can make agreements on the status of Kosovo without the participation 
of the KLA.'' He indicated that the organization's ceasefire, declared 
last week, wouldn't hold indefinitely. ``If the international community 
... tries to create the illusion that Serbia is conforming with the 
demands of the (United Nations) resolution, we won't be able to tolerate 
it for long,'' Mahmuti said. In a Sept. 23 resolution, the U.N. Security 
Council demanded a cease-fire, the withdrawal of special Serb police 
units from the province, and movement toward a negotiated settlement. 
It demanded the safe return of refugees and humanitarian access to 
them. The council threatened unspecified action if both sides failed 
to comply.
