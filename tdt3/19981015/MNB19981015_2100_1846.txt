Today the White House was celebrating something else as we mentioned 
that's helping to take some attention away from the upcoming impeachment 
debate. A budget deal with the republican controlled Congress, one 
that includes some, if not most, of what the White House and the president 
wanted. More from the White House tonight. Here is NBC's David Bloom. 
When the half trillion budget deal was finally done, triumphant democrats 
were not shy about proclaiming victory. This is a very, very good 
day for America. Republican leaders insisted both sides deserved credit. 
It's not a question of who won and had lost. But democrats were less 
Magnus man muss. Pointing to the $1 billion dollars for new teachers. 
$18 billion for the international monetary fund. $6 billion in emergency 
farm aid. And we won. It turns them democrats for a day and conservatives 
agreed. It's a great society Bill and it's not something that I as 
a conservative republican am prepared to support. Republicans did 
push through more money for defense spending in anti-drug efforts 
and both sides took credit for saving much of the federal budget surplus 
for social security. We fought off a lot of insistence on increased 
spending and I can tell you, Mr. and Mrs. America, for the most part 
your surplus is still intact. We did save the surplus for the hard 
work of social security reform early next year. The president's incoming 
chief of staff says says unless Mr. Clinton retains his strength and 
-- that for President Clinton is the best news of all. David Bloom, 
NBC news, the White House.
