The Central Bank rate cut, announced only 45 minutes before the end 
of the trading day, ignited a buying frenzy that pushed the Dow Jones 
Industrial Average up 330 points, more than four percent to 8,299. 
The point gain was the third largest ever on the New York Stock Exchange 
while the volume of 931 million shares was the sixth heaviest. The 
barter Standard & Poor's 500 closed up 542 points, four percent at 
1,047. The NASDEQ composite closed up 70 points at 1,611. The U.S. 
Central Bank is not scheduled to meet again until Mid-November. But 
analysts say chairman Alan Greenspan obviously felt the bank made 
a mistake in only cutting one quarter percent from interest rates 
at its October meeting. Joe Chapman, VOA News, New York.
