In Washington today, the big money deal of a different order. The 
White House and the republican leaders have reached an agreement on 
the $500 billion budget package to fund the government for another 
year. The partisan game of who really made this possible, who made 
it happen, has already begun. Regardless of that, there's quite a 
lot in the Bill that will make a difference to a good many people. 
Here's ABC's Linda Douglass. In the end, both republicans and democrats 
tried to take credit for the deal to spend roughly $500 billion to 
fund ten government agencies. I think we have a package that is good 
for America. It's a good day for America. Some key items -- $15.5 
billion goes to the national institutes of health for research on 
cancer and other diseases. $1.1 billion for home heating for low-income 
seniors. $1.1 billion to hire and train 100,000 new teachers. They 
decided not to spend $1 billion to repair dilapidated schools. There 
was also $20 billion for what were deemed emergencies. $1.5 billion 
for natural disasters, like hurricane georges. $2.2 billion for year 
2000 computer problems. $1.9 billion for peacekeeping in Bosnia. $6.5 
billion to bail out farmers. But there were also emergency items that 
might not seem so urgent. For example, $1 billion to begin building 
a missile defense system. And then there is $2 billion for a mystery 
item labeled "intelligence." Only a few senior members of Congress 
and staff with top-secret clearance know what it is. Where did those 
emergency funds come from? Why, the budget surplus, the one democrats 
vowed to save for social security and republicans wanted to dip into 
for a tax cut. But never mind that now. The biggest emergency here 
is to wrap up this deal fast, so members can go home to campaign.
