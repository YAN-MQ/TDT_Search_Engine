Some 40,000 American men die from prostate cancer. It's the second 
leading cause of cancer deaths among men. So what can they do to prevent 
the disease? One possible answer is the Mineral selenium. A study 
by the national cancer institute found that men with the highest intakes 
of selenium cut their prostate cancer rates by one-half to two-thirds. 
Other studies suggest vitamin E may also prevent prostate cancer. 
But experts warn it's too soon to recommend that men start taking 
these two supplements. The sum of all the data available to us at 
this point is not sufficiently compelling or conclusive for us to 
move into the Arena of recommendations. Until they know more about 
supplements, researchers say eat a healthy diet, including fish, grains 
and fruits and vegetables. For the latest health news online, check
