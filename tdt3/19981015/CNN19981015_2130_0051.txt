A surprise move by the federal reserve today sent the stock market 
soaring to its third-largest point gain ever. The fed slashed interest 
rates and a late-afternoon surge on Wall Street ensued. The Dow Jones 
industrial average finished up 330 points to close at 8299. The fed 
lowered both its discount rate and federal funds rate in response 
to economic turmoil. Ceci Rodgers has details. The fed cited unsettled 
conditions in U.S. financial markets and a growing causation on the 
part of lenders. The move many analysts because it came between the 
fed's normal policy-making meetings. I think what this rate cut means, 
the fed is going to be very aggressive in keeping this economy from 
softening in a needless way. The inflation rate is very low, there's 
considerable financial turmoil outside the U.S. it would be pointless 
and dangerous for the U.S. economy to be soft in these circumstances. 
The fed lowered the federal funds rate, the rate banks charge one 
another for overnight loans, to 5% on the heels of its September 29th 
rate cut. More importantly, the fed cut the discount rate. The rate 
it charges banks for loans to 4.75%, a symbolic move. We will expect 
any line of credit linked to the prime rate such as a home equity 
credit to be moving lower because we will expect banks to adjust their 
prime rate downward either tomorrow or early next week. Already, banks 
have begun moving their prime rates down. Home equity lines of credit 
will also become cheaper as will loans for autos and credit card purchases. 
More importantly, the fed's rate cut should help settle the wild gyrations 
in the financial markets that have reduced consumer confidence, and 
threatened the economy. Ceci Rodgers, "CNN Financial News," Chicago.
