An explosion near an oil refinery in this northern coastal town killed 
one fisherman, seriously injured another and left an oil slick in 
the port area, officials said Thursday. The explosion occurred Wednesday 
at 11.20 p.m. (2220 gmt) as a tanker discharged crude into a refinery 
owned by the Petrogal company in Matosinhos, some 300 kilometers (190 
miles) north of Lisbon, Petrogal spokesman Antonio Mocho said. The 
tanker was offloading its oil, a mile off the coast, through a recently-installed 
pipeline when some spilled into the sea. A build up gases in the area 
was thought to have followed, Matosinhos fireman Simoes Duarte said. 
``The fishermen must have smelled something and went over to see what 
was going on. One of them might have been smoking or might have lit 
a match,'' he said, adding that there was still some crude near the 
port area. But company spokesman Mocho said the cause of the explosion 
was not yet known. He said the refinery was still operating because 
the equipment was undamaged. Petrogal _ Petroleos de Portugal S.A. 
_ is Portugal's largest petroleum company. It has two refineries with 
a capacity of 300 thousand barrels per day and providing the local 
market with 85 percent of its local petroleum products. ``Petrogal 
needs to stop its procedures here and check to make certain that it 
is meeting Portuguese and European regulations,'' Matosinhos mayor 
Narciso Miranda told Lisbon radio TSF.
