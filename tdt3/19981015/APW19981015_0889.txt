Australia's second-seed Patrick Rafter moved into the quarterfinals 
of the dlrs 800,000 CA Trophy ATP tournament Thursday by ousting Magnus 
Norman of Sweden 6-3, 6-2. ``I match up well with someone like Magnus,'' 
Rafter said after his victory. Rafter, the U.S. Open champion, has 
a chance of replacing Pete Sampras as the top-ranked player in the 
world in the coming weeks. One step in this direction could be Friday's 
quarterfinal encounter with Britain's Greg Rusedski, whose powerful 
serve stunned local darling Thomas Muster, who is a far cry from his 
onetime prowess. Rafter, who has a 5-1 head-to-head record against 
Rusedski, said, ``I never played Greg on this surface, and I do not 
know how I will react to his serve. ``But I am confident there will 
be a couple of breaks here and there,'' he added. Rusedski, last year's 
finalist at the Vienna tournament, took 64 minutes to defeat Muster 
in straight sets 6-4, 6-3. ``It's always difficult to play Thomas 
in Austria,'' said the Briton afterward. ``But I am very pleased that 
they did not let the crowd getting into it.'' Asked what his chance 
was to qualify for the World Championship in Hanover, Germany, Rusedski 
said, ``I think I still have a slight chance, but the other guys in 
the top eight have solidified their position.'' Earlier in the day, 
Todd Martin of the United States downed fourth-seed Petr Korda of 
the Czech Republic. Opening a day of second-round matches, the unseeded 
American beat favored Korda 6-3, 7-6 (7-2). Fifth-seed Karol Kucera 
of Slovakia then defeated Germany's Tommy Haas 7-5, 6-4. Haas' main 
problem was his weakness with the first service. Jonas Bjorkman of 
Sweden subsequently subdued Bohdan Ulihrach of the Czech Republic, 
6-4, 6-1.
