Substance meets ceremony today in the newly energized mideast peace 
negotiations. Palestinian leader Yasser Arafat and Israeli prime minister 
Benjamin Netanyahu are launching a summit for a West Bank accord. 
An opening ceremony came at a rose garden event after President Clinton 
met with both men and urged them to break the logjam of mistrust. 
Substance begins this afternoon at a chesapeake estate on Maryland's 
eastern shore where the two men will confer. A year and a half of 
fitful diplomacy interrupted by terrorist bombs and harsh words may 
result in a hand-over of land. Secretary of state Madeleine Albright 
will oversee the weekend talks. The president would only join the 
discussions if he is asked. This week's talk at wye river offered 
a chance for the parties to break the log jam and finally take the 
next essential steps for peace in the Middle East. We must remember 
as we come together again that in the end, peace is more than a process. 
It is in the end -- a destination. These two leaders have the power 
to lead their people to peace.
