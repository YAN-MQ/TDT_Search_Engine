Italian Premier Romano Prodi on Thursday gave up on his bid to form 
a new government, informing President Oscar Luigi Scalfaro that his 
political negotiations had failed. Prodi's 2 1/2-year-old center-left 
government collapsed last Friday in a failed vote of confidence after 
losing the support of the hard-line Communist Refoundation Party. 
With pressure on Italy to pass a cost-cutting 1999 budget meeting 
requirements of the European common currency, Scalfaro had asked Prodi 
to make a stab at forming a new government. But Prodi said Thursday 
that ``my assignment proved impossible.'' Scalfaro can now ask someone 
else to try to form a government or he can call early elections. Most 
observers think elections are unlikely. ``I hope Italy will soon have 
a stable government and a cohesive majority,'' Prodi told reporters 
after his meeting with the president. Prodi headed Italy's 55th government 
since World War II and, at 2 1/2 years, its second longest-lasting. 
The premier had been looking to a small center-right party with 29 
votes to help him put together a new majority. But the Democratic 
Union for the Republic, led by ex-president Francesco Cossiga, rejected 
his overtures on Wednesday night. Many political observers are speculating 
that Scalfaro might now turn to an apolitical premier to shepherd 
through the budget and the debut of the euro, the common European 
currency. But he could also opt to give someone a shot at hammering 
together a new political majority. Speculation on this front centers 
on Massimo D'Alema, leader of the Democratic Left, the largest party 
in Prodi's old coalition.
