The Lebanese Parliament has elected popular General Emil Lahule as 
the countries next President. All of the one hundred eighteen legislatures 
present at the session voted for the General who is supported by Syria. 
He is scheduled to be sworn in for a six-year term and on November 
24th the day President Elias Herrari leaves office. General Lhule 
was selected to succeed President Harrari last week at a meeting of 
Mr. Harrari and Syrian President Hafez Al Assad in Damascus. Syria, 
which dominates Lebanese politics, has more than 30,000 troops in 
the neighboring country.
