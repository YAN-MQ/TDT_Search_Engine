A surprise drop again in the big fed interest rate. The stock market 
promptly goes wild but how long will it last? How much uncertainty 
is still ahead? It's something in every jet. It's something the government 
says needs to come out and be replaced. What is the danger in the 
meantime? Also tonight the potential disaster, millions of stolen 
airline tickets. A designate designate investigation this evening. 
What is a hot ticket worth and who pays? And they all made history 
elected during the year of the woman. Tonight why some women in the 
Senate are in deep trouble. Why one felt the need to apologize on 
television. Good Thursday evening to you. A late financial update 
for you tonight, also the big stories this evening in aviation safety. 
In politics including a live report on the Jones case from Arkansas, 
a development there. In our first look at the morning papers here 
this Thursday evening.
