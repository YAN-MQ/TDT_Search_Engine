India's capital, new Delhi, is a modern city. But just outside is 
old Delhi, the capital of medieval India. Anita Pratap visits an historic 
and bustling neighborhood there. There was romance in the air, and 
in the name, moonlight square. Three centuries ago, this was the hub 
of India's most important Muslim empire. Today, it's a this lives 
bazaar in old Delhi where the drumbeats of commerce mingle with an 
ancient rhythm. The romance, the love, the spirit of Delhi can be 
found here. It's a criss-cross of alleys where people have been working 
their trade for centuries. This Lane is called bread streets. They've 
been selling bread for 125 years. The bread that we make here has 
a special flavor. A special fragrance. It's an ancient recipe. You 
can get the ingredientsfullywhere, but our technique of making the 
bread is very special. People come from different parts of India's 
capital to taste the special bread, eaten with vegetables. I bring 
my children here because the atmosphere, the smell, the culture, is 
very special here. You won't get this feel in any other part of Delhi. 
There is a street devoted to selling garlands, rose and others for 
different occasions, weddings and any sort of celebrations. Garl nlds 
of Flowers, tinsel, beads and even currency notes for bridegrooms. 
There are no other market in Delhi where the prices are as competitive 
and the range as wide. Just off Garland street is the jewelry street. 
Rows of shopping selling silver and gold. The pavements of mondaylight 
square bustle with strange products and services. Teeth for a few 
cents. Ear cleaners, roadside photographers, fortune tellers, even 
a bird hospital. All amidst a teeming mass of humanity. It has become 
crowd and had chaotic, romance has given way to commerce, but moonlight 
square retains a unique charm of its own. Anita Pratap, CNN, Delhi.
