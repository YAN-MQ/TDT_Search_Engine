Chi Chi Rodriguez is expected to leave the hospital Friday, two days 
after angioplasty. The 62-year-old Rodriguez had what he thought was 
severe indigestion Tuesday while preparing to play in the Raley's 
Gold Rush Classic senior tournament, which begins Friday at Serrano 
Country Club in nearby El Dorado Hills. He went to a doctor, who diagnosed 
him with angina caused by a partially blocked artery, according to 
a statement from the company representing him, Eddie Elias Enterprises 
Inc. ``The doctors performed a successful angioplasty procedure and 
Chi Chi is resting comfortably and doing well'' at Sutter Memorial 
Hospital, said the statement. Rodriguez was struggling through his 
worst year on the Senior PGA tour. He ranked 71st on the money list 
with dlrs 115,684 in earnings. Fellow golfer Lee Trevino told The 
Sacramento Bee he expects to see Rodriguez, a longtime smoker, back 
in action next year. ``Chi Chi's going to be fine,'' Trevino said. 
``As long as he didn't have a heart attack, he'll be as good as new.''
