Former Soviet President Mikhail Gorbachev made a surprise visit this 
week to Texas State Fair in Dallas. Mr. Gorbachev came to the fair 
when he had some spare time before giving a speech at Southern Methodist 
University. He inspected Clydesdale horses, livestock and cars, sampled 
foods such as corn dogs and beef jerky, and watched a cow-milking 
demonstration. Before leaving the State Fair, Mr. Gorbachev was given 
an all American gift, that's practically a symbol of the state of 
Texas, a cowboy hat. The former Soviet President had a little trouble 
figuring the hat out though, putting it on backwards, at first. He 
got it right before it left though right?
