Kerry Collins, saying he never quit on the Carolina Panthers as was 
reported last week, is starting a new career with the New Orleans 
Saints. The Saints, planning to start their third quarterback of the 
season on Sunday, claimed Collins for a dlrs 100 waiver fee after 
18 other teams passed. ``All we're trying to do is find a way to get 
better,'' said coach Mike Ditka, whose team has lost two straight, 
including last week's 31-0 drubbing by San Francisco. ``I hope he 
can give us some stability and some leadership.'' On Tuesday, Carolina 
released Collins, who was demoted from starting quarterback to third 
string last week. Collins broke his week-long silence Wednesday about 
his demotion and subsequent release, saying he never told coach Dom 
Capers that he didn't want to play. ``That hurt,'' Collins told The 
Associated Press in a interview from his agent's office in Newport 
Beach, California. ``That wasn't what I was trying to get across. 
At no point did I say that.'' During a conference call Wednesday, 
Tampa Bay defensive tackle Warren Sapp, who goes against Carolina 
(0-5) on Sunday, called Collins a coward. ``He disgraced the game,'' 
Sapp said. ``He disgraced Johnny Unitas and all the great quarterbacks 
who ever played the game.'' Tampa Bay plays the Saints in New Orleans 
on Oct. 25. New Orleans meets Carolina on Nov. 1 at Charlotte. Collins 
said he was happy to get another chance to play, but made it clear 
that he wasn't satisfied with the way he left the Panthers, who in 
1995 made him the franchise's first-ever draft pick. ``Everything 
happened so fast. It just got out of hand, really, and before I knew 
it, it was too late,'' he said. ``I feel bad about it. Obviously, 
this is very hard for me. I never said my heart wasn't in it.'' Instead, 
Collins said he had what he thought was ``a very good, civil discussion'' 
with Capers about the Panthers' winless start and the quarterback's 
role in it. ``I told him, `If this is all happening because of me, 
if it's my fault, I would understand if you wanted to go in another 
direction,''' Collins said. ``I never intended to quit. I never intended 
to withdraw my services. I basically wanted to feel them out.'' After 
the meeting, Capers said Collins had told him that he felt partly 
responsible for the team's poor start and that he felt his heart was 
no longer into leading the team. Many of Collins' teammates heard 
about that remark and questioned whether he could ever return to lead 
the offense. At that point, Collins said, he realized that his days 
with the Panthers were numbered. The Saints will pick up the remaining 
dlrs 746,048 of Collins' dlrs 1.153 million contract. He becomes a 
free agent at the end of the season. Collins said he's excited about 
the new opportunity in New Orleans, which began the season at quarterback 
with Billy Joe Hobert, who was injured and knocked out for the season 
in the first game. On Wednesday, Ditka benched Danny Wuerffel and 
gave the starting job to Billy Joe Tolliver.
