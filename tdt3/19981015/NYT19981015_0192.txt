The definition of antiques is changing daily, and, as usual, Los Angeles 
sets the trends. On Oct. 25, two Los Angeles auction houses will team 
up for the first time to conduct a sale, ``20th-Century Decorative 
Arts, Fine Art and Modern Design.'' Los Angeles Modern Auctions, which 
since 1992 has been conducting three sales of 1950s furniture each 
year, is branching out. The house, known as Lama, will sell the fixtures 
from Rebecca's Restaurant in Venice, Calif., in a joint venture with 
Santa Monica Auctions, which sells mostly contemporary art. Just so 
you know how new an antique can be: Rebecca's closed three weeks ago, 
said Peter Loughrey, the head of Lama. Rebecca's, a fashionable Mexican 
restaurant with a subaquatic theme, opened in 1983. Frank Gehry, the 
Los Angeles architect who designed the Guggenheim Museum in Bilbao, 
Spain, created the entire space from top to bottom. It had an 18-foot-long 
cut-glass octopus chandelier in bright red, a pair of giant black 
crocodile sculptures with individually bent metal scales suspended 
from the ceiling, and two nine-foot-tall cut-glass-and-silicon fish 
lamps that were leaping out of the sea _ more specifically, from the 
rear of the custom banquettes. It was an underwater fantasy. The idea 
was ``to create indirect, atmospheric light,'' Gehry said at the time. 
``Walking in, you see a bunch of strange objects and forms but the 
important thing I was striving for was that each element be discrete 
and complete, so there's no blurring. They just stand on their own 
in this space.'' In the auction catalog, Thomas Hines, a professor 
of history and architecture at UCLA, writes that like Charles Rennie 
Mackintosh's famous Cranston Tea Rooms in Glasgow in 1900 or Adolf 
Loos' American Bar in Vienna in 1907, Gehry's Rebecca's has ``regrettably 
joined the venerable company of Restaurants Departed.'' Hines suggests 
that Gehry's fixtures are ``unique artifacts'' that should ``somehow 
continue to stand on their own as survivors of Rebecca's unfortunate 
demise.'' Loughrey said several New York City dealers had expressed 
interest in the Gehry pieces, despite the high presale estimates ($100,000 
to $150,000 for the octopus, $80,000 to $150,000 each for the crocodiles, 
and $40,000 to $50,000 for the pair of fish lamps). Loughrey does 
not find the estimates so high. In the 1980s, he pointed out, the 
Fred Hoffmann Gallery in Santa Monica, Calif., sold limited editions 
of Gehry's smaller fish lamps, in glass and translucent Formica chips, 
for about $40,000 apiece. Hines writes in the catalog that the fish 
motif has always been important to Gehry, because it reminds him of 
shopping for the makings of gefilte fish with his grandmother as a 
child in Toronto. Estimates for other items in the sale, not from 
the restaurant but many of them designs by other world-famous architects, 
are more modest. There is the brilliant red polyurethane foam prototype 
of ``Joe,'' a club chair in the form of a baseball mitt that the Italian 
team of DePas, D'Urbino &AMP; Lomazzi designed for the Poltronova 
company in Italy in 1969. This chair, eventually manufactured with 
stitched leather upholstery to look more authentic, has been a status 
symbol for homeowners with private sports bars for years. The auction 
house's estimate is $8,000 to $10,000. There are also some design 
treasures that could probably be unearthed only in Los Angeles. There 
is, for example, an original Unit Chair by R.M. Schindler, the Austrian 
architect who moved to Los Angeles in the 1930s and is now the height 
of fashion among modern-design aficionados (estimate: $12,000 to $14,000). 
Schindler designed the Unit for the Elizabeth Van Patten house he 
built in 1934 in the Silverlake section of Los Angeles, and he continued 
to make other versions of it for two later houses. It is an upholstered 
chair whose square seat has slots to allow attachments, like a table 
or seat back. It looks as contemporary as the latest beds by the French 
designer Philippe Starck, which have bedside tables attached. The 
auction also includes several pieces of furniture that have come to 
be considered ``les musts'' of Modernism: the Dunbar sofa designed 
by Edward Wormley ($1,500 to $1,800), a wood armchair with webbed 
upholstery by Jens Risom ($800 to $1,000), a pair of club chairs with 
trapezoidal arms attributed to Paul T. Frankl ($1,200 to $1,500) and 
a George Nelson built-in storage unit from the home of D.J. Dupree, 
a former president of the Herman Miller furniture company ($2,500 
to $3,000). Loughrey said collectors now look for modern pieces with 
notable provenance: ``1950s pieces that were special-ordered for a 
particular person, like the Dupree storage wall.'' ``The validity 
of modern furniture is now firmly entrenched,'' he added. ``Modern 
design is not just a fad. The market for modern has never slumped. 
We are still seeing record prices again and again. We achieved a world 
record for a design by Charles and Ray Eames last May 17 _ a 15-panel 
folding screen in wood sold for $41,800.'' Maybe mid-century design 
will be recession proof, but that does not explain its intense appeal. 
Loughrey, who is 30, tried to explain his feelings. ``I grew up in 
Maryland with delicate 18th-century furniture and silver,'' he recalled. 
``There were rooms I wasn't ever allowed to go into as a child. Modern 
furniture is to be used.'' He tried to put it in more historical terms: 
``There was a huge boom after World War II and people had enormous 
optimism about the future and the postwar world order. We have to 
remember this furniture was brand new and anti-traditional. It had 
refreshing new forms. This furniture is what 20th-century design is 
all about.'' The sale preview, from Monday through Oct. 24, will be 
at the I.M. Chait Gallery, 9330 Civic Center Drive, Beverly Hills. 
Information on the auction: (323) 845-9456. Antiques in New York: 
What's Happening This is the 10th anniversary of the International 
Fine Art and Antique Dealers Show, which opens Friday at the 7th Regiment 
Armory, at Park Avenue and 67th Street, and runs through Thursday. 
Christie's ``Arts of France'' sale is next Friday, with 176 lots. 
Sotheby's has its English and Continental silver sale Wednesday. But 
let's not forget what's close at hand: Manhattan has some of the finest 
antiques dealers in the world. No fair or auction house has anything 
more spectacular, for example, than the exceptional pair of solid 
silver Italian consoles with gilt bronze decorations now gracing the 
walls of Dalva Brothers, at 44 E. 57th St. Equally spectacular is 
the Roentgen chest of drawers with gilded bronze tassel pulls that 
Tony Victoria, the owner of Frederick Victoria &AMP; Sons at 154 E. 
55th St., is selling. Sometimes it's important to pay attention to 
the hometown teams, too.
