President Clinton says the entire negotiating team is prepared to 
do whatever it takes in the mideast peace summit outside Washington. 
Israeli prime minister Benjamin Netanyahu and Palestinian authority 
President Yasser Arafat are scheduled to discuss the impasse through 
Sunday, but that could be extended. Palestinian negotiators are indicating 
if enough progress is made at the meetings, the next phase, called 
final status talks," could begin soon. Security against terrorism 
already is shaping up to be a major issue. He asks that we give large 
lots of land right next to our cities, right next to our White House, 
right next to our capitol, right next to our major cities. How do 
we know that these areas, these territories, will not become bases 
of terrorism? The answer is we cannot have full knowledge, full guarantee. 
But what we can have are concrete assurances by the Palestinian authority 
that they will take those steps that have been promised before and 
have yet to be carried out, to minimize that risk and to fight terrorism, 
to prevent the use of Palestinian areas as launching grounds for terrorist 
attacks against us. Peace is the most important platform for security. 
And he has to remember this, and not to forget that some of the extremist 
gangsters had killed my partner Rabin. You are suggesting there are 
terrorists on both sides? You can imagine that. Secretary of state 
Madeleine Albright will handle the day-to-day negotiations for the 
summit.
