Police sealed off streets around parliament building Thursday as legislators 
debated a no confidence motion which, if successful, could lead to 
the collapse of President Daniel arap Moi's 20-year rule. A police 
source said authorities were determined to ensure there would be no 
gathering outside parliament by supporters of politicians who backed 
or opposed the motion. Moi's ruling Kenya African National Union party 
has a majority in the 222-member house and could easily garner the 
113 votes needed to defeat the motion. ``We will defeat them thoroughly 
by a large, large majority,'' said Minister of East African and Regional 
Cooperation Nicholas Biwott as he entered the parliament building. 
``Wait and see. They will have to be taught a lesson.'' However, the 
motion was raised during a nationwide teachers strike as well as during 
the East African nation's worst economic crisis since independence 
in 1963. There is also growing dissatisfaction among Muslim legislators, 
who have traditionally either belonged to KANU or supported Moi, but 
who have lately been accusing his government of ignoring the interests 
of Kenya's Muslims, estimated at between 5 and 30 percent of the population 
of 29 million. The no-confidence motion, to be presented by James 
Orengo of the opposition FORD-Kenya party, is the third against a 
Kenyan government. The other two, unsuccessful motions were presented 
against the government of Kenya's first president, Jomo Kenyatta, 
in 1964 and 1967. As vice-president, Moi assumed office on Kenyatta's 
death in 1978. Single-party rule was instituted after a failed coup 
attempt by non-commissioned air force officers in 1982. Orengo's motion 
is based on a constitutional clause that permits any legislator to 
request parliament to vote ``Yes'' or ``No'' on a motion that says 
``this house resolves and declares it has no confidence in the government 
of Kenya.'' If the motion is carried, Moi has two options: he can 
resign and seek a new mandate in presidential elections while the 
parliament remains seated, or he can remain president, dissolve parliament 
and call general elections. Moi is president as well as an elected 
member of parliament. If he does neither, parliament must then dissolve 
itself on the fourth day after the vote. On Tuesday, the Safina opposition 
party urged Moi to form a government of national unity to last four 
years. His current presidential term expires in 2002. Safina leader 
Paul Muite said no government formed by any single political party 
could fight corruption in high places and enact the constitutional 
and economic reforms necessary to get Kenya out of the mess it is 
in..
