After a four-day wait, Venus Williams began play in the dlrs 1 million 
European Championships with a 7-5, 6-3 victory over Corina Morariu 
on Thursday. A qualifier last year, Williams was the No. 2 seed at 
the European tournament _ which officially changed its name to Swisscom 
Challenge Thursday _ and consequently received a bye into the second 
round. ``There's always the possibility it can hurt your game and 
you become `off' if you start late in the tournament,'' said Williams, 
who won her third career title two weeks ago at the Grand Slam Cup 
in Munich. ``I never had to start this late before, but I worked hard 
and got some practice in, and I think I played well.'' Morariu played 
three qualifying matches to reach the main draw, then posted a first-round 
win over France's Sandrine Testud. Williams broke in the third game 
to go up 2-1, but Morariu broke back immediately. Williams had another 
break opportunity at 3-3, but squandered five break points. At 4-4 
Williams again blew a chance to take the lead, pushing Morariu to 
deuce eight times but wasting four break points. Morariu continued 
to struggle with her service game, again going to deuce four times 
before allowing Williams to break and take a 6-5 lead. The second 
set began similarly with the players trading serves before Williams 
broke twice more to clinch the victory. ``I have to get better when 
it comes to capitalizing on my opportunities,'' said Williams, who 
reached the quarterfinals last year before losing to eventual champion 
Lindsay Davenport. ``I also made a lot of unforced errors which I 
need to improve on.'' Williams, a semifinalist at the U.S. Open, will 
meet seventh-seeded Mary Pierce in the quarterfinals. Nathalie Tauziat 
of France also played her first match of the tournament Thursday, 
defeating Lisa Raymond 6-2, 6-3. ``I was angry when I saw the schedule 
and I wasn't playing until Thursday,'' said Tauziat, a finalist last 
year. ``You see everyone play, you see everyone win and defend their 
points and it's very frustrating.'' Eighth-seeded Dominique Van Roost 
reached the quarterfinals, beating Amelie Mauresmo of France 6-3, 
6-4. Van Roost will face Irina Spirlea in the quarterfinals, and Davenport, 
No. 1 in the world, plays sixth-seed Amanda Coetzer.
