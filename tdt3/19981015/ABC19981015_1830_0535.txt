There is a new study out today from a very respected research institute, 
which finds that the number of teenagers getting pregnant is dropping 
in a very big way. There are some very interesting reasons. Here's 
ABC's Michelle Norris. America's teenage pregnancy rate has taken 
a sharp downturn, dropping by 14% since 1990. The Allan gutmacher 
institute reports that the teen pregnancy rate has fallen to its lowest 
level in 20 years. Researchers say that suggests a major shift in 
teenage attitudes about sex. They are taking the measures that they 
need to take, including abstaining from sex, and when they're having 
sex, using contraceptives more. But researchers point to depo provera, 
a new birth control method that hit the market four years ago, as 
the major reason for the decline. It's known among teenagers simply 
as "the shot." A drug injected once every three months that has proven 
to be almost 100% effective. It's become the birth control of choice 
for teenagers, particularly African-American girls -- the group that 
posted the steepest decline in pregnancy rates. The girls all know 
about the shot? All the girls, even young girls, preteens, yes, everyone 
knows about it. Why do girls your age seem to like this so much? They 
don't want to get pregnant, but they want to have sex. A lot of them 
have been on the birth control pills before and have had trouble remembering 
to take the pills, and many of them really like the fact that you 
only need to get a shot every three months. With barely any advertising, 
depo provera has spread primarily through word of mouth. As the drug 
becomes more popular, researchers think it could be one of the best 
weapons in the war against teenage pregnancy. Michele Norris, ABC
