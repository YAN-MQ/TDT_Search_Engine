The latest talks in the troubled Middle East peace process and when 
hasn't it been, started today in Queens town, Maryland. Small town 
on the eastern shore of the chesapeake bay. President Clinton started 
the talks. Secretary of state Madeline Albright accompanying him at 
the three-sided table. Israeli and Palestinian delegations facing 
each other. The U.S. in between. The sticky issues still a lot like 
it was a few months back. Palestinians want land they say belongs 
to them under the 1993 Oslo deal. Israel says they're concerned about 
handing over a base of operations to terrorists. The place is rented 
for five days of talks.
