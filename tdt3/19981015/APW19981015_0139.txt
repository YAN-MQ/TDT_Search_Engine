In more bad news for Russia's food situation, the country has harvested 
only half as much grain so far this year as it did in the same period 
last year, a news agency reported Thursday. Russia's farms and agricultural 
companies threshed 50 million metric tons (55 million tons) of grain 
from Jan. 1 to Oct. 12, down 46 percent from the same time in 1997, 
the ITAR-Tass news agency said, citing the State Statistics Committee. 
Russia is expecting one of its worst harvests in 40 years because 
of drought. The government is reportedly seeking up to 3.3 million 
tons of donated grain from the United States. In other bad harvest 
news, the country's potato crop is also down for the same Jan. 1-Oct. 
12 period. The country harvested 30 million metric tons (33 million 
tons), down 10.7 percent from last year. Farmers are also planting 
less for the 1999 harvest. They plowed 22 million hectares (54 million 
acres) this fall, down from 25 million hectares (61 million acres) 
last year. However, the sugar beet harvest was up by 22 percent, and 
the sunflower seed harvest almost doubled, ITAR-Tass said, without 
providing specific figures.
