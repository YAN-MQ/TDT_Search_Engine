Organized gangs of youths have vandalized and looted stores and overturned 
cars in Paris during a protest over poor conditions in French schools. 
Police arrested more than 80 people after the violence broke out in 
the French capital. Student leaders and French officials say the rioters 
had nothing to do with the student movement.
