Republican Congressional Leaders say a compromise 1999 budget deal 
with the White House is imminent and that a formal announcement could 
come later today. The agreement, which lawmakers could vote on by 
tomorrow, would clear about $500 billion to fund eight unfinished 
spending bills. It would also authorize a separate spending package 
for Bosnia peacekeeping, defense readiness, and farm relief. Additional 
the deal would earmark $18 billion for the international monetary 
fund and also avert the threat of Federal Government shut down. Compromises 
were reported Wednesday on both sides with the White House yielding 
on its demands for a tax subsidy to build 5,000 new schools. The Clinton 
administration prevailed, however, in it's demand for 1.1 billion 
dollars to hire 100,000 new teachers nationwide.
