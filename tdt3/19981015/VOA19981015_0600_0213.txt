Top negotiators from China and Taiwan are meeting for a second time 
today, to discuss the resumption of formal talks between the two rivals. 
VOA's Roger Wilkerson in Shanghai reports there appears to be little 
likelihood that the men have succeeded in bridging in the differences 
between the two sides. But their spokesmen say they have at least 
broken the ice that has chilled cross-state relations for the past 
three years. Taiwanese negotiator Gutan Foo went on a sightseeing 
tour of Shanghai and marveled at how quickly the city has turned into 
a major business and financial center. Visiting the local stock exchange. 
Mr. Foo described Shanghai as a good place to do business. Though 
he made a pitch for stricter laws and more transparent regulation 
of financial transactions. In an informal get together with his Chinese 
counterpart Wanggo Han Mr. Foo is stressing where the two sides need 
to begin negotiations to improve relations. But China has put a condition 
on those talks, it says they need to tackle political issues aimed 
at eventual re-unification of the mainland with the island. Taiwan 
wants the talks to deal with initially with practical matters like 
fishing rights so that two sides can gradually build up mutual trust. 
Both sides are downplaying expectations of any major breakthrough, 
but say the fact that the two men have met may be enough to propel 
relations forward. Roger Wilkerson, VOA News, Shanghai.
