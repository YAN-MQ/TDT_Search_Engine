Jerome Jurenovich, "Headline Sports." Everyone knew pitching would 
win the national league pennant, although few thought it would be 
the padres outperforming the Braves on the mound. Nlcs MVP sterling 
hitchcock and San Diego shut out Atlanta 5-0, putting the padres in 
the world series for the first time in 14 years. We've all waited 
a long time, and the fact that we're going to the world series again 
is great. But I'm gonna tell you now, we want to win it. Game one 
is Saturday in New York. The tigers have removed interim from Larry 
Parish's title, he's now the full-time manager. And the Dodgers have 
been turned down again in their search for a new skipper. Tom Kelly 
says he'd rather stay in Minnesota.
