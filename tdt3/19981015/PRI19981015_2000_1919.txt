good humored and peaceful enough. The thousands of students, aged 
between 16 and 18, carrying banners calling for instant reform of 
the school system. At the start, though, there were ugly scenes. Gangs 
of youngsters who had infiltrated the protest went on the rampage 
around the in the east of the city. Riot police made more than 80 
arrests and there were a few injuries. The violence marked what was 
intended as the high point of more than a week of protests across 
the country. students say their classes are increasingly overcrowded.
