"Mind over matter" is more than a phrase for researchers in Atlanta. 
They've discovered a way to harness brain power to control a computer 
mouse. Dan Rutz has more on what could be an extraordinary finding. 
Hi, sweetie. It is almost a year after a devastating stroke left Johnny 
Ray unable to move, unable even to speak. He has a keen mind and fighting 
spirit. Family members shower him with affection recalling the man 
who used to keep everybody laughing. Johnny has always been a talker. 
Let me explain to you-- Johnny never shut up. And I'm not saying that 
in a bad way. Dr. Phillip Kennedy aims to help the 52-year-old tradesman 
talk again through a computer. Ray is learning to communicate with 
the computer through sensors implanted in his brain. This is like 
trying to get several individual neural signals from his brain and 
feeding those back to him so he can train them to do what he wants 
with them. The signals come from an area of the brain near the surface 
and are sent to the computer through a glass cone implant, specially 
treated so brain cells actually grow into it. The signal is transmitted 
by radio waves to an antenna outside so there are no wires through 
the head. Several times a week, Dr. Kennedy coaches Ray to think about 
moving a finger or toe, to produce the signal that in turn moves a 
computer cursor to a selection of icons to convey simple messages. 
One more and you're in there. I feel too cold. Eventually, Kennedy 
says, Ray should be able to compose his own sentences by quickly shuffling 
the arrow around the keyboard. In about the next 10, 20 sessions, 
he should be able to master the keyboard. There are other communication 
devices for those locked in their bodies, as Johnny Ray is. But this 
one, Kennedy says, offers his patient far more versatility and control. 
For now, Johnny Ray struggles to communicate a simple yes or no through 
his eyes, but soon he may have a much wider vocabulary through the 
energy of the brain, a computer and a lot of will power. Dan Rutz, 
CNN, Atlanta.
