Government and opposition parties agreed to set up a special body 
to prepare for new elections, a gesture of reconciliation after months 
of upheaval. The agreement came late Wednesday, when a mediator announced 
that the arrangement would include opposition party representatives 
and be responsible for creating the basis for free and fair elections 
within 18 months. Tensions in Lesotho, a small mountainous kingdom 
surrounded by South Africa, have been running high since the May elections, 
which opposition groups claim were rigged. After an army revolt and 
crippling strikes, South Africa and nearby Botswana on Sept. 22 sent 
about 1,000 troops into the country to restore calm. South Africa 
expected to establish order quickly and leave, but scores were killed 
and its soldiers remain in Lesotho. A South African government statement 
said the parties would appoint technical teams to examine proposals 
for the new election body, expected to be appointed by Oct. 31. South 
Africa's Safety and Security Minister Sydney Mufamadi mediated the 
daylong talks. Earlier on Wednesday, United Nations Secretary General 
Kofi Annan urged the rival parties to resolve the conflict. ``You 
did not disappoint ... Annan, who implored you to work towards an 
agreement,'' Mufamadi said. The Southern African Development Community, 
a 14-national regional group, uncovered serious irregularities in 
the May elections. The Independent Electoral Commission is slated 
for reorganization by year's end, and is expected to draft a new code 
of conduct for political parties.
