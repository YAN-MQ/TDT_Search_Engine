I'm meteorologist rose stabler in the CNN weather center with your 
"Headline News forecast." Heavy snow in the forecast for the northern 
Rockies through Friday. Windy conditions from the southern plains 
into the central plains, and by Friday we'll see a good bit of rain 
moving into the northern plains region with the rain beginning to 
move out of New England by Friday evening. Beautiful weather on the 
east coast with high pressure sitting along the mid-atlantic coastline. 
Windy conditions continue over the southern plains with patchy rain 
along the Texas coastline. High temperatures for Friday, in the 40s 
for the northern Rockies and New England, otherwise, 50s and 60s in 
the north, 70s and 80s in the south. Your extended forecast showing 
heavy snow and rain in the northern plains and western Great Lakes 
turning into just plain rain and thunderstorms as you push to the 
south. On Sunday, that rain moves to the east, we'll see scattered 
showers and thunderstorms from the Great Lakes to Texas. And then 
on Monday, less rain, just scattered thunderstorms over the south 
with a few showers in the northeast and in the northwest.
