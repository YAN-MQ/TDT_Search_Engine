He started with can openers, now his sights are spiritual. And he 
wants to take American TV viewers with him. Michael Okwu joins bud 
paxson on his celestial journey. Bud paxson made a dove his mascot 
-- and put an Angel on the air. When you walk But it takes more than 
wings to make a new network fly. Even he'll concede that. If you look 
at television today, in terms of ratings, we say that years ago ABC, 
NBC and CBS used to have 90% of all viewers. Now that's drifted down 
to 47%. While cable eats at network ratings and profits, bud paxson 
bucked conventional wisdom and launched pax-TV, a seventh broadcast 
network, in August. The thought remains is that broadcast television 
is still the way to deliver programming to the American home. Paxson 
marked his territory in TV as founder of "the home shopping network" 
over 20 years ago. That novel broadcasting concept stemmed from dealing 
with a dead-beat advertiser at his struggling local radio station. 
He tried to negotiate with me to pay his Bill with electric can openers. 
And it cost exactly 112 electric can openers for the advertising he 
had. Just as paxson sold can openers on the air and uncovered a whole 
new market, he thinks he can do the same with pax-TV. We think there's 
just too much violence, too much sex on television. And that's how 
we're gonna differ. So they've lined-up wholesome talk shows and values-oriented 
syndicated programs, like "highway to heaven," and snagged exclusive 
rights to the popular series, "Dr. Quinn, medicine woman." There's 
a little touch of spirituality. But 85% of all Americans say they 
have a spiritual side. So if you can tap that and bring great family 
programming, then, I think you're gonna get a lot of viewers. And 
perhaps a lot of advertisers. Pax-TV was launched just as major corporations 
formed "the forum for responsible advertisers" -- designed to seek 
out quality programming from the networks. We had ten advertisers 
together in a room talking about the issue of looking for more family-friendly 
options in television programming. The places where we can really 
feel comfortable with placing our advertising. Pax-TV debuted in about 
75% of the country, including every major city -- places where bud 
paxson owns the local stations. That local ownership, says paxson, 
is the key to making his new network a money machine. When you combine 
ownership of the television stations to the network, you're gonna 
be profitable. And that's what we've done. With pax-TV barely two 
months old, bud paxson is out to prove he can make a lot of pennies 
-- from heaven. Michael Okwu, "CNN Entertainment News," New York.
