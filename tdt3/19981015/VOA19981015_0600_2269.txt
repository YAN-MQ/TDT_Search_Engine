At least 21 people were killed today and dozens more injured after 
a powerful typhoon packing high winds and heavy rain moved across 
the Philippines. Chris Simpkins has more on the damage typhoon Zed 
is causing in our Asian News Center in Hong Kong. With sustained winds 
of 240 kilometers per hour, Typhoon Zeb roared across the Philippines 
causing floods power outages and numerous mud slides. At least 31 
thousand people were forced to evacuate their homes, because of rising 
waters and Benkep Province 200 kilometers north of Manila 10 people 
died after boulders, mud and debris cascaded down a mountain, completely 
covering a building where workers of the hydro-electric plant lived. 
Elsewhere in Benkep Province five people died in separate mud slides. 
Just outside Manila, two brothers died after tons of mud crashed down 
a hill onto their hut. The boys six year old sister survived. Government 
offices in the worst effected areas have been turned into emergency 
shelters, officials say that the death tolls could rise because they 
have had numerous reports of mud slides in remote villages on the 
island. Typhoon Zeb is the strongest of eight storms to hit the Philippines 
this year. Weather forecaster Seaem Shaman Hong Kong says Typhoon 
Zeb has lost some of it's power but still poses danger to Taiwan and 
Japan. Zeb is still a strong typhoon with maximum winds of about a 
160 kilometers per hour, near the center. With the extensive circulation 
of Zeb and the combined effects of the Northeast Monsoon winds offshore 
are occasionally strong and the seas are rather rough. Later Thursday 
the storm moved towards Taiwan, officials on the island said 2 story 
high waves were reported lashing the Southeastern coast and a fisherman 
was swept out to sea. Several domestic airline flights were canceled 
because of the high winds in the Southern port city of Gowshang. Weather 
forecasters say the Typhoon is expected to loose some of it's strength 
as the storm tracks North in the East China Sea, heading for the Southern 
islands of Japan. Chris Simpkins from the VOA Asian News center.
