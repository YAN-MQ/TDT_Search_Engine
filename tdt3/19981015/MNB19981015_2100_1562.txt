Won't be long now -- October 29, senator John Glenn stands to make 
history once again. This time as the oldest astronaut in the world, 
flying into space board the shuttle discovery. Today he met with the 
media for the last time before the flight. Last scheduled visit anyway. 
Tonight NBC news correspondent Robert Hager has a look at the mission 
and in this case the mission specialist. Two weeks before this month's 
blastoff and counting, 36 years after John Glenn became the first 
American to orbit the earth. Glenn now 77 years old and his six new 
crew mates broke off training briefly to take questions from reporters. 
Will you be able to avoid the fatigue factors that may exist up there? 
yes. no. It is rigorous, and -- but that's what space flight is all 
about, and I've been able to -- you know, I may not be as flexible 
as this crowd to my right here -- But Glenn says he's up to it and 
the night's commander Curtis brown agrees. At times we're trying to 
stay up with him. But that's how it's always been, then and now. Pulling 
on a space suit then. Squeezing into a more complex one now. Then 
climbing into the small friendship 7 Mercury capsule. now -- This 
is the worst part of the whole trip. Getting in and out of the thing. 
Entering the shuttle. This time for nine days in orbit, Glenn will 
be studied for the effects of weightlessness on older people. Can 
that help us better understand the aging process for everyone? Aging 
of the heart, the sense of balance, the weakening of muscle and bone. 
Glenn will even swallow pills with tiny transmitters inside that will 
radio back his body temperature. He hopes his latest adventure will 
now be an inspiration for older Americans. If you look forward to 
things and are active and can participate in things, why not do it? 
I've always regretted the fact that too many people seem to run their 
lives by the calendar. Godspeed, John Glenn. ok. In 1962, Glenn's 
five-hour three orbit flight made history, earned him a ticker tape 
welcome back to earth. Now 36 years later, John Glenn is about to 
make history again. Not only soar into space, but also teach us something 
about the human body for all ages. Robert Hager, NBC news, at the 
Johnson space center in Houston.
