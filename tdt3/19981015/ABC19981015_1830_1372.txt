We've been looking at managed care in America, now truly the HMO nation. 
The promise of managed care has always been to provide better care 
at a reduced cost. But when HMOs don't get the job done, the question 
is, who's to blame? Tonight, we check in with whether your employers 
have an answer for it. Today, 127 million Americans and their families 
are enrolled by their employers in some form of managed care program. 
Dr. Thomas bodenheimer, from the University of California, blames 
the corporate bottom line for driving down the quality of health care 
available to workers. If you're a corporation, you have to worry about 
your profit margins and quality of care increases costs. Where as 
if you can cut down your costs, you'll increase your profits. According 
to recent studies, only about a third of corporations who are in the 
market for managed care ever consider the quality of the health care 
provider. Greg Lehman is a corporate consultant about health care. 
I think the breakdown has been traditionally the employers have primarily 
focused on costs, and they have been somewhat ignorant of the qualitative 
issues regarding health care. And it may take a big effort for employees 
to refocus them. But it's wise to remember that if you criticize you 
HMO for inadequacy, you might also consider your employer's "bottom 
line."
