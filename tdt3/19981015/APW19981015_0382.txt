Citigroup Inc., the United States' largest financial services company, 
will begin talks this month on a securities business tie-up with two 
major Japanese banks, a newspaper reported Thursday. Citigroup hopes 
to forge a link with an existing alliance of two so-called city banks 
in Japan, Asahi Bank Ltd. and Tokai Bank Ltd., to develop and sell 
mutual funds in the Japanese market, the newspaper Tokyo Shimbun said, 
without citing named sources. It said an agreement could be reached 
as soon as early next year. But spokesmen for Asahi Bank and Tokai 
Bank denied the report, saying no talks on a tie-up with Citigroup 
are planned. The report comes amid a series of similar alliances between 
foreign and Japanese financial institutions triggered by the recent 
deregulation of Japan's banking, brokerage and insurance industries. 
Earlier this month, Wall Street investment bank J.P. Morgan and Co. 
said it would set up a Tokyo-based mutual fund business with Dai-Ichi 
Kangyo Bank Ltd., one of Japan's largest lenders. Prudential Insurance 
Co. and Mitsui Trust and Banking Co. agreed in July to open a joint 
mutual fund company. Earlier this year, Merrill Lynch and Fidelity 
Investments Co. both announced plans to set up separate nationwide 
retail networks in Japan. Citigroup is the product of a merger announced 
in April between Citicorp and the Travelers Group Inc. _ which bought 
Nikko Securities Co., Japan's third-largest brokerage house, in June. 
In September, Asahi Bank and Tokai Bank announced their decision to 
join hands in fields such as private banking and mutual fund marketing. 
They also plan to purchase shares of one another and eventually set 
up a joint holding company. A deal with Citigroup would expand the 
New York-based financial giant's access to an estimated dlrs 9 trillion 
pool of personal financial assets held by Japanese savers and investors. 
Tokyo-based Asahi Bank has 429 offices worldwide, employs 12,688 people 
and has total deposits of 20.4 trillion yen (dlrs 172 billion). Tokai 
Bank, based in Nagoya, western Japan, has 303 offices worldwide, employs 
11,407 people and has total deposits of 19.9 trillion yen (dlrs 167 
billion).
