We'll take "A closer look" tonight at how tough things are between 
the Israelis and the Palestinians right now. Today in Maryland well 
away from the public eye, the Palestinian President Yasser Arafat 
and the Israeli prime minister, Benjamin Netanyahu, are being encouraged 
by President Clinton to come up with a meaningful peace agreement. 
Skeptics abound. These are very tough men with very different agendas. 
First of all, witness what happened earlier at the White House. Here's 
ABC's John Cochran. President Clinton tried to set the right Tone 
by urging the two leaders to be realistic. As in any difficult problem, 
neither side can expect to win 100% of every point. The president 
said that because the issues are so sensitive, his guests would not 
answer questions. But, as soon as they could, they rushed to the microphones 
to argue their cases before the world's news media. We are asked to 
give additional territory. We want to ensure that this territory doesn't 
become a base and a haven for terrorists to attack us, as happened 
before. Yasser Arafat shot back that it was an Israeli who assassinated 
Netanyahu's predecessor, prime minister Rabin. Arafat said he is already 
doing what he can to protect the safety of Israelis. I can give 100% 
effort, but no one in the world can give 100% results. What is the 
most serious obstacle to peace? The political decision from Mr. Netanyahu. 
No wonder President Clinton insisted on holding the bulk of talks 
70 miles outside Washington at a country retreat with almost no access 
for the press. American officials hope taking walks in the Woods will 
help the two sides settle their differences. That sounds good, but 
-- pastoral setting than by what they think their people back home 
will accept. John Cochran, ABC News, the White House.
