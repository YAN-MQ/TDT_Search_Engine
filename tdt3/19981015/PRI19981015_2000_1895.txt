NATO Secretary General Javier Solata has told President Milosevic 
of Yugoslavia he must withdraw his troops and special police units 
from Kosovo immediately. Speaking in Belgrade, Mr. Solata also warned 
that any attack against NATO aircraft in Kosovo would have the gravest 
consequences. His warnings came shortly after NATO and the Yugoslav 
army signed an agreement on aerial verification.
