In US news Federal Authorities have charged a fugitive Eric Robert 
Rudolph, with a 1996 bombing at the Atlanta Summer Olympics. Which 
killed one person and wounded more than 100 others. National correspondent 
Jim Malone tells us Mr. Rudolph is now wanted in connection with four 
separate bombings. Eric Robert Rudolph has been on the run since January 
29th, when authorities say he bombed an abortion clinic in Birmingham, 
Alabama, killing a security guard and wounding a nurse. Now Mr. Rudolph 
has been formally charged with the Atlanta Olympic bombing in July 
of 1996, as well as the 1997 bombings of an abortion clinic and a 
gay night club, also in the Atlanta area. Federal and local law enforcement 
agents have been searching for the fugitive for months in the rugged 
Western mountains of his native North Carolina. And US Attorney Janet 
Reno says that search will go on indefinitely. People in Western North 
Carolina and the surrounding area, have been very cooperative, and 
especially the local law enforcement there. It is there that we believe 
Eric Rudolph is hiding, we are going to keep searching, until we find 
him. And we are not going to rest until we bring him to justice. A 
million dollar reward for information leading to Eric Rudolph's arrest 
remains in effect. The suspect also remains on the FBI's Ten Most 
Wanted Fugitives list. FBI Director Louis Freeh says Federal agents 
have developed strong evidence over the past several months linking 
Mr. Rudolph to the Atlanta bombings. A lot of it's forensic, a lot 
of it has to do with, uh, statements that have been made by witnesses 
both historically and contemporaneously. On his background, experience, 
motivation, statements he has made to people, uh, really, uh, a very 
powerful array of uh, circumstantial and direct evidence. Authorities 
have found traces of food, which they believe, Eric Rudolph buried 
in the woods of Western North Carolina, but so far the 31 year old 
carpenter and experienced outdoorsman has eluded a massive manhunt 
involving hundreds of Federal and local law agent. Jim Malone, VOA 
News, Washington.
