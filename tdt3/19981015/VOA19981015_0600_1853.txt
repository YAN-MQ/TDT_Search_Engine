Meanwhile, the United States said Wednesday there were some signs 
President Milosevic had begun to comply with the agreement reached 
with Mr. Holbrooke but Under Secretary of State Thomas Prickering 
told VOA too few Serbian forces sent to crack down on Ethnic Albanian 
Separatists have been withdrawn from Kosovo. VOA's Nick Simeon gives 
us more details. Little of the agreement worked out in nine days of 
talks between the Yugoslav leader and Special US Envoy Richard Holbrooke 
has been put in place. Ambassador Pickering calls that worrisome. 
Amb. THOMAS PICKERING: We are seeing some of his forces moving into 
assembly areas, they have been for some time. But they don't seem 
to be in large numbers where they should be, moving out of Kosovo, 
and s we're watching very, very carefully. Still, the Clinton administration 
admits it does not expect the Yugoslav leader to be able to fully 
implement the elements of the agreement within the 96-hour time frames 
set by NATO. We hope that we will see a good faith effort to make 
a serious beginning and real progress before the 96 hours runs out. 
Uh, after that NATO will have decide what to do, and obviously it 
has a number of options. Privately US officials say NATO's 96-hour 
window for President Milosevic to demonstrate full compliance will 
likely be extended if there is evidence of his good intentions, but 
whatever the results of the US effort to end the Kosovo conflict Ambassador 
Pickering says that President Clinton has written to Congress to assure 
law makers he does not intend to put US troops on the ground there.
