the White House and Republican leaders in Congress have agreed on 
a $500 billion budget package that will pay for government operations 
through the rest of this fiscal year. Senate Majority Leader Trent 
Lott said votes on the completed spending plan could come tomorrow. 
Both sides claimed victories in the bargaining process which extended 
two weeks past the start of the fiscal year. President Clinton welcomed 
it as a good day for America. Today every American can take a great 
deal of pride in knowing that we are going to save Social Security, 
that we are going to have 100,000 teachers, that we are going to continue 
to move forward on the environment and that now we are free here in 
this Administration to keep our economy going by meeting our responsibilities 
to deal with the global economic challenges. Republicans took credit 
for getting funding to improve military readiness and restrict illegal 
drugs. Among the issues that kept the two sides apart up until the 
end were how to conduct the 2000 census, abortion and family planning 
and money for the International Monetary Fund.
