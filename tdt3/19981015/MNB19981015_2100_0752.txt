Less than three weeks to go until election day and a lot of analysts 
as you may know are predicteding the G.O.P. in Congress will win big, 
even as a lot of polls are suggesting a lot of Americans aren't happy 
with the vote to hold impeachment hearings. Three first term democratic 
women in the U.S. Senate who now find themselves facing particularly 
tough re-election races were voted into office more like swept into 
office under very different circumstances. The year was 1992. It quickly 
became known as the year of the woman but a lot has changed since 
then. From Capitol Hill tonight, NBC news correspondent Joe Johns. 
Senator Carol Moseley Braun of Illinois, the first African-American 
woman elected to the Senate is fighting for her political life. Her 
six years in office have been marred by nagging questions about how 
she spent campaign funds and by a controversial trip she took to Nigeria 
that riled the state department. Now polls indicate she is trailing 
her republican challenger. In an effort to get back on track, this 
week she released a new TV ad. She apologized to voters. I know I've 
made mistakes and disappointed some people but I want you to know 
that I've always tried to do what's best for Illinois. Senator Moseley 
Braun along with senator Barbara boxer in California and senator Patty 
Murray in Washington state were all swept into office in 1992. It 
was called the year of the woman. Now all three democrat incumbents 
are facing tough races as voters focus on their records. This is a 
problem of ideology and what you've done in the Senate and the way 
you've run, you know, your political life. This isn't about gender 
at all. Election watchers say women are continuing to gain ground 
in politics, both on Capitol Hill and at the state level, but among 
those three women democrats in the Senate, only Murray and Washington 
-- in Washington state faces a challenger who happens to be another 
woman. Murray's opponent -- Linda Smith, a republican member of the 
house. With the midterm elections less than three weeks away, incumbents 
like Murray, boxer, and Moseley Braun have been torn between their 
duties in Washington and the needs of their campaigns. For some, time 
may be running out. Joe Johns, NBC news, Washington.
