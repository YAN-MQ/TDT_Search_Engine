Police have sent a long-awaited report to government prosecutors so 
they can assess whether charges will be filed in the terrorist bombing 
of an Air India jetliner in 1985. All 329 people on board Air India 
Flight 182, including 280 Canadians, were killed when the plane, bound 
from Canada to London, blew up over the coast of Ireland. The Royal 
Canadian Mounted Police has been hunting for the bombers since then, 
in what the force calls the most complex investigation in its history. 
In a news release Thursday, the RCMP said the submission of the report 
to prosecutors does not mean the filing of charges is imminent. No 
time frame was set for the review process, and police declined to 
reveal any details about their evidence. Criminal charges would be 
approved only if prosecutors determine there is ``a substantial likelihood 
of a conviction and it is in the public interest to proceed,'' the 
RCMP said. The RCMP has faced repeated criticism from relatives of 
the victims who have complained the investigation has dragged on too 
long. Police believe a group of Sikh separatists living in British 
Columbia planned to blow up two Air India jets as part of a terrorist 
campaign against the Indian government. The separatists were working 
to establish an independent Sikh homeland. In June 1985, two bomb-laden 
suitcases were checked in for flights destined to connect with two 
Air India flights. The first bomb exploded at Tokyo's Narita airport, 
killing two baggage handlers who were unloading a Canadian Pacific 
flight from Vancouver. Less than an hour later, Flight 182 _ which 
also originated in Vancouver _ exploded. Inderjit Singh Reyat, an 
electrician from Vancouver Island, is serving 10 years for manslaughter 
in connection with the Narita deaths. He has been identified as a 
suspect in the Flight 182 bombing.
