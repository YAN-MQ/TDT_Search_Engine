Most years, Dominican winter baseball season is a time when future 
Major League stars are born and heroes like Chicago Cubs outfielder 
Sammy Sosa return to crack home runs on home turf. This year, officials 
say they will simply try to bring some hope to a devastated nation. 
Three weeks after Hurricane Georges killed at least 280 people and 
left hundreds of thousands homeless in this Caribbean country, organizers 
say the season will start Oct. 23 despite destroyed stadiums and the 
withdrawal of two of its six teams because of the tragedy. ``The league 
wanted to undertake the championship because it understands that, 
even having ventured through this difficult times, professional baseball 
is the chief pastime of Dominicans,'' said Jorge Torres, spokesman 
for the Dominican Professional Baseball League. Around Santo Domingo's 
Quisqueya Stadium, where President Leonel Fernandez is expected to 
throw out the first pitch, torn electric lines still dangle over street 
gutters clogged with downed tree branches. Broken apartment windows 
stare out at the field. The Estrellas Orientales (Eastern Stars) of 
San Pedro de Macoris _ Sosa's home town _ and the Azucareros (Sugar 
Growers) of La Romana won't be competing because this year because 
the storm ripped the roofs from their stadiums and turned their lighting 
towers to crumpled masses of metal. That leaves four teams _ the Santiago 
Aguilas (Eagles), the Escogido Leones, the Gigantes of San Francisco 
de Macoris and the Licey Tigres, who upset Puerto Rico last year to 
claim the Caribbean Series championship. It is unlikely that Sosa, 
to whom the league is dedicating the season because of his run this 
season at the U.S. major league home run record, will be there to 
play during the beginning of the season. He is expected to play in 
an exhibition series in Japan. To help the 60 roster players and 120 
reserve players left jobless by the storm, the league's players' association 
has organized a temporary draft on Thursday. Most Dominican players 
live on small salaries while hoping for minor-league contracts in 
the United States. Of the 180 team members, 17 top players will be 
reassigned to the other teams. The Giants will have to absorb five 
because they finished last in the 1997-1998 season; the others will 
take four each into their 30-man active roster and try to include 
some of the others in their reserves. The 60-game winter season only 
lasts until January, so it's unlikely many of the reserve players 
will even play. The plan has caused some grumbling in the dugouts. 
``We are going to have to develop four guys from the other clubs, 
and stop the development of our guys,'' said Rafael Landestoy, general 
manager of the Licey Tigres. ``That's going to be trouble for our 
guys.'' Players who aren't placed on the draft are hoping for jobs 
in Venezuela, Puerto Rico and Mexico. The Venezuelan league has already 
said it might be interested in some of them. Still, most of the players 
know they will be jobless when the first pitch is thrown. Miguel Abreu, 
a San Pedro de Macoris player who is on the Florida Marlins minor 
league team during the summer, said he might go to New York to look 
for other work. ``Hurricane Georges killed everything here,'' he said.
