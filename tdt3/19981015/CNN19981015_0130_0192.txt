The White House and congressional leaders worked into the night Wednesday, 
without reaching a final agreement on a federal budget for fiscal 
year 1999. But the glass is more full than empty. The bulk of an agreement 
is in place with just a few snags left. Negotiators still need to 
hammer out how the 2000 census will be conducted and whether insurance 
companies that cover federal employees will have to pay for prescription 
contraceptives. Democrats declared a partial victory when republicans 
agreed to provide more than $1 billion in funding to hire 100,000 
new teachers. This didn't just start this week with these negotiations. 
This is a process that has been going on since the president's state 
of the union when he announced the importance of having 100,000 additional 
teachers in the classroom so that we could reduce class size, and 
so that kids could learn at a better rate. Local school boards will 
control all of the teacher money. Local school boards will decide 
the kind of teachers they need to hire. Local school boards will have 
the right to include special education children and special education 
teachers in that proposal. This is a dramatic victory for a program 
that congressman Joe Pitts and Slade Gordon began, a program of dollars 
to the classroom, no new federal bureaucracy, no new regulations. 
The money goes right to the local communities. And we think this the 
right way to do it. Congress passed a temporary spending Bill Wednesday 
to keep the government running, since the 1999 fiscal year began October 
1st.
