Russian prosecutors have opened an investigation into opposition calls 
to overthrow President Boris Yeltsin's government by force, officials 
said Thursday. The Moscow city prosecutor's office will look into 
statements made by Communists and other hard-liners during protests 
in the capital earlier this month that marked the bloody fighting 
between opposition lawmakers and government troops five years ago. 
Some speakers at the rallies, including retired Gen. Albert Makashov, 
a Communist member of parliament, called for the government's ouster 
by force. Justice Minister Pavel Krasheninnikov said earlier this 
month that criminal proceedings could be launched against Makashov 
and several other opposition activists. Prosecutor's office has refused 
to identify which specific individuals it was investigating, the ITAR-Tass 
news agency reported. Under Russian law, public calls for the violent 
ouster of the government are punishable by a fine or a prison term 
of up to three years. Makashov has immunity from prosecution because 
he is a lawmaker Communists who dominate the parliament's lower house, 
together with other hard-liners, are certain to block any attempt 
to lift his immunity.
