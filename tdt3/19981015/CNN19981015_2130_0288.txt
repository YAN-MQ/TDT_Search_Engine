The White House praised public schools as one of the safest place 
for American children, despite a recent rash of school shootings. 
A conference on school violence opened today with a report that shows 
crime rates in schools have dropped and 90% of the schools report 
no violence at all. President Clinton called for annual reports on 
school violence after the shooting at a Paducah, Kentucky, high school 
last year. It was just one of several school shootings in which 16 
people were killed.
