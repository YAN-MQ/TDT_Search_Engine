``La Sentinelle'' was shown as part of the New York Film Festival 
in 1992. Following are excerpts from Stephen Holden's review, which 
appeared in The New York Times on Oct. 5, 1992. Anyone who believes 
that Americans have a monopoly on conspiracy theories should see the 
French director Arnaud Desplechin's intricately constructed film, 
``La Sentinelle.'' In the movie, which might be described as a medical 
thriller, a brain that turns out to be symbolic of the Cold War mentality 
is meticulously dissected and analyzed on a laboratory table by a 
student of forensic medicine. Without giving away too much, it should 
suffice to say that among other revelations about the recently ended 
Cold War is the suggestion that it was a cloak-and-dagger game played 
with boyish relish by participants on both sides of the divide. ``La 
Sentinelle'' follows the present-day travails, both scientific and 
romantic, of Mathias Barillet (Emmanuel Salinger), a glum young student 
who moves from Germany to France to attend medical school. Aboard 
the train, he and his friend Jean-Jacques (Thibault de Montalembert), 
an employee of the French Foreign Ministry, are visited by customs 
officials. Although Jean-Jacques passes the inspection, Mathias finds 
himself taken at gunpoint to the customs car, where he is grilled 
by a sinister double-agent type named Bleicher (Jean-Louis Richard). 
In his Paris hotel, however, Mathias finds a strange parcel in one 
of his suitcases. Opening it up, he discovers the shrunken head of 
a middle-aged man. Deeply shaken, he decides to keep his discovery 
a secret, and over the following weeks he begins surreptitiously testing 
samples of the head in his medical school laboratory. His quest for 
information quickly mounts into an obsession. The director, who also 
helped write the screenplay, extends the Cold War analogies of people 
divided by nationality, religion and sex to Mathias' touchy interpersonal 
relationships. Mathias decides to share an apartment with William 
(Bruno Todeschini), a colleague of Jean-Jacques' who is sleeping with 
Jean- Jacques' girlfriend, Nathalie (Valerie Dreville). William is 
so insistent on guarding his own space in the apartment that the door 
between their bedrooms almost becomes a kind of checkpoint. Also on 
hand is Mathias' sister Marie (Marianne Denicourt), a singer with 
a small opera company run by Jean-Jacques' boss, Varins (Jean-Luc 
Boutte). An elegant and mysterious figure, Varins has the power to 
decide if the company will visit Russia. The relations among everyone 
in this circle, in which Mathias finds himself an outsider, are edgy. 
As he goes about his life, his dealings with people have a quality 
of strained diplomatic negotiations. Although the thriller aspect 
of ``La Sentinelle'' doesn't quite add up, the film is still an absorbing, 
psychologically resonant portrait of French student life. As directed 
by Desplechin, the attractive young cast hardly seems to be acting. 
``La Sentinelle'' is both an epitaph for the Cold War and a reflection 
of it. It also wonders seriously about the psychological ramifications 
of a united Europe.
