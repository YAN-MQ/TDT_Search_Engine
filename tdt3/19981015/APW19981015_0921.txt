Interest turned away from the golf course on the eve of the Raley's 
Gold Rush Classic seniors event at Serrano Country Club. Amid preparation 
for the dlrs 1 million tournament, the players were concerned about 
Senior PGA Tour player Chi Chi Rodriguez. The charismatic Rodriguez 
underwent a successful angioplasty procedure Tuesday night. He has 
been resting comfortably since the heart surgery at Sutter Memorial 
Hospital in Sacramento. ``I was shocked when I heard about it, you 
don't expect to hear that kind of news about someone like Chi Chi,'' 
Gary Player said. Lee Trevino believes the crowd-pleasing Rodriguez 
_ known for his entertaining sword dance with his putter after sinking 
putts _ will recover and be back on the tour next year. ``Chi Chi 
has a big heart, he'll be back,'' Trevino said. ``He wouldn't be where 
he was today if he didn't have one.'' The surgery prevents Rodriguez 
from making a 12th straight appearance in the Gold Rush. Though Rodriguez 
won't be there, another Gold Rush favorite will begin play Friday 
in the 54-hole tournament. And he's hoping for a repeat performance. 
Last year, a teary-eyed Bob Eastwood tried to keep his emotions under 
control as he strolled up the 18th fairway. Leading the tournament 
on the final day, an emotional Eastwood was trying to stay focused 
and maintain his lead before a crowd that included many friends and 
relatives. If he was experiencing problems, it never showed. Eastwood, 
a former Sacramento City Amateur champion who grew up in nearby Lodi, 
birdied two of the final four holes to win the title at Serrano's 
course. ``I got very emotional,'' Eastwood said. ``I was saying, `Don't 
lose it now.' It was something special, a wonderful feeling winning 
here. Leading in your hometown is tough. I was glad it was over.'' 
The tour's top two money leaders, Hale Irwin and Gil Morgan, aren't 
in the field. Larry Nelson, third on the money list, will play, as 
will Jim Colbert, winner of last week's Transamerica tournament. Colbert 
won the Gold Rush in 1996. Other 1998 winners playing this week are 
Jay Sigel, Jim Albus, Brian Barnes, Bruce Summerhays, Larry Ziegler 
and Bob Dickson.
