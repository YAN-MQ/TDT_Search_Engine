Dodge ram was the first, and is still the only, full-size pickup to 
be ranked "most appealing" by J.D. power and associates. It was the 
first to offer .. a 10 cylinder engine. And it was the first quad 
cab. And now, for the first time, we're offering a thousand dollars 
back on the truck that changed the rules. But hurry. This is one first 
that won't last. Ends November ninth.
