For months, authorities have searched the dense mountain forests of 
western North Carolina looking for him. Now they are adding the '96 
bombing at centennial Olympic park, and two other Atlanta-area bombings 
to the list of reasons they want Eric Rudolph in custody. The justice 
department announced the new federal charges Wednesday. A woman was 
killed in the Olympic park bombing, 100 people were injured. Sources 
tell CNN forensic tests on nails and other materials from Rudolph's 
North Carolina storage shed found them to be identical to bomb fragments 
found in Atlanta. The FBI also released a photograph of what it suspects 
Rudolph may have been wearing at the time of the Olympic park explosion. 
Rudolph has been at large since January. We will pursue this case 
obviously, as a matter of top law enforcement priority. These cases 
have a grave impact on public safety, as well as the ability of people 
to exercise their freedoms and liberties. Including the peaceful Olympic 
games, which of course are now scheduled to occur in Salt Lake City. 
Rudolph already was wanted in connection with the bombing of a Birmingham, 
Alabama, women's clinic. Investigators are urging anyone with possible 
leads to call 1-888-ATF-bomb.
