Switching gears a little bit. Brazil's national football team has 
defeated Equidor 5-1 in a friendly international match played in Washington 
Wednesday. VOA sports editor, Park Brewer* was at the game at RFK 
and has this report. The first win for new Brazilian coach Vonderle 
Vusenvergo* turned out to be a big one. Five to one over Ecuador here, 
but before that 18,000 fans. This will help him forget this debut 
match a one to one tie against Yugoslavia in Brazil last month. With 
a squad featuring only three players from the World Cup, a runner-up 
team, Brazil got inspiring performances from some newcomers. Elbert 
in his fifth international scored three goals for a hat trick. Through 
an interpreter, Coach Vusnevergo credited his players for their intensity. 
We wanted the players to run and get the ball just not stand but to 
put pressure on the other team and that is what they did today. They 
have the game playing mostly on the Equidorian field and that really 
is good for this game. Once again the final score Brazil five and 
Equidor one. Park Brewer, VOA sports at RFK Stadium, Washington.
