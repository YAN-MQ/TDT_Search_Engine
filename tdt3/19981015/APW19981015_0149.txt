Most of the banks examined by international auditors and Indonesia's 
central bank have capital-adequacy ratios below the required standard, 
Bank Indonesia Gov. Sjahril Sabirin said Thursday. Speaking to reporters 
on the sidelines of a seminar on foreign exchange and corporate debt, 
Sjahril said audits had been finished on ``around 80'' banks. ``Only 
a few banks have a capital-adequacy ratio of more than (the minimum 
requirement of) 4 percent,'' the governor said. He declined to name 
these banks. A bank's capital-adequacy ratio is one of the key measures 
of a bank's financial strength. Usually, the higher the ratio, the 
sounder the bank. Sjahril reiterated that banks with capital adequacy 
ratios below 4 percent, and down to minus 25 percent, must recapitalize 
and that the government will provide up to 80 percent of the cash. 
Banks whose ratios are below minus 25 percent have to inject fresh 
capital to bring their ratios to that level, after which the government 
would help them recapitalize. In return for the cash, the government 
will take equity in the banks. The central bank, assisted by international 
audit companies, has been auditing all local banks as part of the 
country's economic reform agreement with the International Monetary 
Fund. Reform of the ailing banking sector is regarded as a key step 
in overcoming the worst economic crisis in 30 years. The government 
has already closed more than 20 banks and nationalized four others.
