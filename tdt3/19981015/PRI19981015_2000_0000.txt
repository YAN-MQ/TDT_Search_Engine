This is The World, a co-production of the BBC world service PRI and 
WGBH, Boston. It's Thursday, October 15th. I'm Tony Kahn. Today, as 
Yasser Arafat and Benjamin Netanyahu arrive in the United States for 
their summit, we'll hear from some constituents who packed the leaders 
political baggage. I wish and I pray that will not succeed with his 
plan to establish independent Arab Palestinian states. Also, we find 
conflicting evidence of whether Slobodan Milosevic is withdrawing 
Serb forces as promised and we have a wry take on your winter vacation 
and wry music from Paris. First, this news. From National Public Radio 
News in Washington, I'm Corey Flintoff.
