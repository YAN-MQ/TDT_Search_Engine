Iraq will keep up its contacts with U.N. Secretary-General Kofi Annan 
to solve the issue of the stalled United Nations weapons inspections, 
the official Iraqi News Agency reported Thursday. The decision to 
go ahead with the talks was made at a joint meeting of the Revolutionary 
Command Council and the regional command of the ruling Baath Party 
chaired by President Saddam Hussein, the agency said. It quoted a 
statement issued after the meeting, but did not make clear whether 
specific talks were scheduled with the secretary-general. Annan's 
personal envoy, Prakash Shah, arrived in Baghdad earlier Thursday 
in a further bid to persuade the Iraqi government to allow U.N. arms 
inspectors to resume their work. U.N. officials in Baghdad declined 
to say whether Shah was carrying any new ideas to defuse the standoff 
over arms inspections. Thursday's meeting was the third held by the 
Iraqi leadership this week to assess talks Deputy Prime Minister Tariq 
Aziz had earlier this month with Annan in New York to work out a formula 
to resume the inspections. Shah sat in on those talks. Iraq, on Aug. 
5, placed a freeze on spot searches by U.N. weapons inspectors for 
the country's illegal weapons, effectively paralyzing U.N. inspections 
as mandated under the ceasefire terms that ended the 1991 Gulf War 
over Kuwait. Aziz's talks apparently failed to persuade Annan to back 
Iraq's demand for sweeping changes in the inspections program. The 
inspectors are charged with verifying that Iraq has eliminated its 
long-range missiles and weapons of mass destruction, a process that 
Baghdad must complete before the lifting of trade sanctions imposed 
after its 1990 invasion of Kuwait. Iraq has long maintained it has 
destroyed its lethal weapons systems, but the U.N. arms inspectors 
claim it has failed to show that it is not still making or capable 
of making destructive weapons.
