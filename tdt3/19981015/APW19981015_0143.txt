Prime Minister John Howard's planned new tax on all goods and services 
would make the Australian tourism industry less internationally competitive, 
the Tourism Council of Australia said Thursday. Australia was currently 
ninth on a list prepared by the council of 20 holiday destinations 
that were comparable in terms of affordability. If the new tax is 
introduced, Australia will drop to 10th place, council managing director 
Don Larkin said. ``The impact of a GST (goods and services tax) will 
downgrade our price competitiveness and take Australia from a ranking 
of 9 to a ranking of 10 among our global competitors,'' Larkin said. 
Howard has refused to exempt the industry from the new tax, which 
was the centerpiece of the tax reform package which saw his conservative 
coalition re-elected in Oct. 3 balloting. The package includes a 10 
percent tax on all goods and services, offset by big personal income 
tax cuts. Larkin said Howard should rethink including tourist services 
because the industry is struggling due to the Asian financial crisis. 
``Australia's tourism industry is at the crossroads with tight profit 
margins, international demand softening and a flat domestic market, 
so further improving our competitiveness is vital,'' Larkin said. 
The council released a survey Thursday that showed Australia was more 
expensive than Indonesia, Thailand, China, Malaysia, South Korea, 
Turkey, Taiwan and Singapore when it came to food, drinks, accommodation 
and tours. Australia was cheaper than New Zealand, North America, 
the United Kingdom, Hong Kong, Japan and most of Europe. The survey 
did not take into account recent fluctuations in the Australian dollar, 
which has fallen in value by about 13 Australian cents against the 
U.S. dollar in the past year. Analysis of the survey showed Australia 
was relatively price competitive for business travelers, but less 
so for travelers visiting friends and relatives, Larkin said. Meanwhile, 
one of Australia's largest travel agents said declining currency values 
in Asia meant more Australians were traveling to Asia rather than 
North America and Europe. Thomas Cook Ltd. said Thursday its records 
show that Australian bookings for Asia rose 16.4 percent overall in 
the 12 months to Aug. 31. The biggest winners were Thailand, where 
bookings had rocketed 26 percent in the period, and the Indonesian 
island of Bali, where bookings rose by 14 percent, said Peter Hansen, 
Thomas Cook's communications manager for Australasia. During the same 
period, bookings to the United States dropped 30 percent. Bookings 
to Europe rose slightly, by 4.6 percent.
