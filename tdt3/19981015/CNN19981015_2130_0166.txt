Washington is alive with self-congratulation after the White House 
and congressional leaders worked out a budget deal. After eight days 
of negotiation, all sides today agreed on a $500 billion budget package. 
It includes a $1.1 billion plan to hire 100,000 more elementary school 
teachers and money to fight illegal drugs and to boost military readiness. 
Democrats and republicans are taking credit for the deal and lauding 
it as a victory for the country, with the president as no exception. 
I would like to thank the leaders of the republican party who made 
these agreements with us. I ask you -- just think, we didn't even 
start this work until after the whole budget year was over. Just think 
what we could do for America if we had these priorities all year long 
instead of just for eight days. The budget deal finishes the business 
of the 105th Congress. It also lays out a laundry list of issues that 
lawmakers can take to voters in the November elections. When you look 
down this list, and then the culmination of this legislation -- with 
education, agriculture, defense, more and committed and focused areas 
in fighting the drug war in this country, and all of the other issues 
that we have addressed -- I think this has been a phenomenal success. 
And I'm glad we brought it to a conclusion without an unnecessary, 
uncalled for, and shouldn't have even been threatened shutdown. We 
got our work done. That's the main point. When we come together, roll 
up our sleeves, work hard, long hours we can achieve the things that 
we're supposed to do for the people that sent us here in the first 
place. The Bill still has to be approved by the house and the Senate, 
and signed by President Clinton.
