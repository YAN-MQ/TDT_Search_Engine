The upper house of the Russian parliament voted Thursday to reinstate 
a holiday marking the defeat of Japan in World War II that was dropped 
after the fall of the Soviet Union, a news agency reported. The Federation 
Council agreed to reestablish the Day of Victory Over Militarist Japan, 
which marks the Soviet Union's defeat of Japan on Sept. 3, 1945, the 
ITAR-Tass news agency reported. The measure requires President Boris 
Yeltsin's signature to become law. It has already been approved by 
the lower house, the State Duma. The vote came just one day before 
Japanese Foreign Minister Masahiko Komura was scheduled to arrive 
in Russia for a two-day visit. One of the main reasons for Komura's 
trip is to work on a peace treaty formally ending World War II, which 
the two countries never signed. President Boris Yeltsin has promised 
that a treaty will be signed by 2000, although it hinges on solving 
a dispute over the Kuril Islands, seized by the Soviet Union at the 
end of the war off Russia's Pacific coast. First Deputy Prime Minister 
Yuri Maslyukov, who is to hold talks with Komura, told the Federation 
Council after its vote that the government approves of the measure 
reinstating the holiday. Meanwhile, Deputy Foreign Minister Grigory 
Karasin said Russian-Japanese relations ``are on the rise and are 
becoming increasingly constructive,'' the Interfax news agency said. 
Karasin met Thursday with Japan's ambassador to Russia to discuss 
disputes over fishing off the Kurils, which Japan also claims, ITAR-Tass 
said.
