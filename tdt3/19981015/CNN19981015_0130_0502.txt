NAto is planning special precautions to protect personnel monitoring 
the withdrawal of Yugoslav forces in the province of Kosovo. It's 
worried some of the unarmed observers might be taken hostage by vengeful 
Serbs or be endangered in other ways. The NAto plan calls for a rapid 
response force to be deployed in nearby waters. While Americans are 
part of the monitoring team, none will be used as rescuers. Yugoslav 
President Slobodan Milosevic agreed to allow 2,000 monitors into Kosovo 
to verify his promise to end the crackdown on ethnic Albanians, who 
want autonomy.
