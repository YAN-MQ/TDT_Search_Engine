The FAA is urging aircraft manufacturers to replace the insulation 
on almost all U.S. commercial airliners. The move comes, in part, 
from the crash of Swissair flight 111, which killed all 229 people 
on board. It still isn't clear what caused that crash, but the pilots 
reported smoke in the cockpit. The plane was insulated with mylar 
blankets which have been implicated in fires on at least four other 
planes.
