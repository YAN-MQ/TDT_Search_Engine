What's a young man like Robin to do? His old girlfriend, the beautiful 
daughter of the richest man in town, is leaving the next day for a 
new life in New York. Robin (Alessandro Nivola), it seems, is stuck 
in this small Illinois town, where he grew up. Now he finds himself, 
late at night, standing in the unnatural, deserted quiet of the town's 
main street. Calmly he pulls down the American flag and uses the flagpole 
to break the window of the hardware store. Naturally this lands him 
in jail, but that turns out to have been his plan. ``Reach the Rock,'' 
an intriguing but slightly off-balance film written by John Hughes 
and directed by his 29-year-old protege, William Ryan, is the story 
of Robin's unusual night behind bars. The police sergeant, Quinn (William 
Sadler), never liked Robin and has liked him even less since the night 
Quinn's nephew drowned. Quinn blames Robin, who was with the nephew 
at the time. This is the serious underpinning to a nicely structured 
plot that is largely played for laughs until the final scenes. The 
evening consists of Robin breaking out of his cell more than once 
and sneaking out of the police station to wreak more havoc and generally 
annoy Quinn. Throughout the night, Quinn's deputy, Ernie (Bruce Norris), 
tries desperately to steal some time to make love to his girlfriend, 
Donna (Karen Sillas). This is a running joke that quickly wears thin. 
Eventually Robin gets his wish: to have Lise (Brooke Langton), the 
old girlfriend, come to the police station to bail him out. It's the 
only way he can think of to get her to the station. But when she arrives, 
looking effortlessly perfect, she points out to him that since they 
broke up, she has gone to college, graduated, fallen in love a few 
times and, in essence, moved on. Why, she suggests, doesn't he do 
the same? They eventually have a sultry romantic scene in his cell, 
and Robin makes a decision about his future. ``Reach the Rock'' seems 
like the dark side of Hughes' earlier films like ``Pretty in Pink'' 
and ``Sixteen Candles,'' reflecting the realization that dating the 
prom queen (or being her) isn't the solution to youth's problems. 
The film has a small-town quietness of its own, and the low rumble 
of thunder, threatening and promising rain throughout the night, has 
the desired symbolic effect. But the film doesn't trust its audience 
to feel that and makes things much too obvious by having Ernie say: 
``We need the rain. People get uncomfortable waiting too long for 
something to happen.'' Finally, a hard rain falls on the town, pouring 
down on the empty Tastee Freez, a powerful small-town symbol on its 
own. PRODUCTION NOTES: `REACH THE ROCK' Directed by William Ryan;
