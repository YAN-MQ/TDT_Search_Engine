Finally from us this evening, history and the handbag. This is about 
Margaret Thatcher. She is baroness Thatcher now, but in the 1980s 
she was prime minister Thatcher -- Mrs. T., the iron lady, the Soviets 
called her. And everywhere we saw her -- at war with Argentina in 
the falkland islands, with her friend and political Ally Ronald Reagan, 
quarreling with Europe -- there was no picture without the handbag. 
And this year, baroness Thatcher wanted to leave her handbags to history, 
to Cambridge University, along with all her papers and other artifacts 
of power. And they don't want the handbag. From the University curators' 
really stuffy reply, "fashion accessories have no historical significance." 
Who are they kidding? Have they never been to that famous wax museum 
in London? Mrs. Thatcher has.
