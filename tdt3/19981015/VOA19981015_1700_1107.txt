Time now for sports and joining us is VOA's Steve Shy and Steve, I 
bet you are going to tell us about baseball. Yes. That is the big 
thing on our mind right now. Susan. The San Diego Padres will return 
to baseball's world series for the first time in 14 years after defeating 
the Atlanta Braves 5 to nothing in the National League Championship 
series. The Padres broke a scoreless tie in Atlanta Wednesday night 
by getting all of their runs in the sixth inning. Atlanta pitcher, 
Tom Glavin* gave up a string of base hits and Padres turned them into 
five runs. San Diego's Sterling Hitchcock limited the powerful Atlanta 
bats to a mere two hits. Hitchcock says if the Pads can get to the 
serious, they have a good chance of wining it. When you look at who 
we had to go through to get to this point, you know, Randy Johnson, 
Hampton. You look at, you know, the four guys that they run out there 
with the Braves. And, you know, they, you cannot say enough about 
this team to get to where we are at right now. The Padres won the 
series four games to two, ending the Braves' attempt to become the 
first team in history to overcome a 3 to nothing deficit in the playoffs. 
Braves manager, Bobby Cox, says he still thinks his team is good enough 
to win it all. When it comes down to pitching, our last game Hitchcock. 
You know, I cannot say nothing about what he did. He, you know, he 
threw the whole post season. He had to go against Johnson and Mattox 
and Glavin and, you know, he gave us what we needed on three days' 
rest. But I think the difference was we just got a very fine-pitched 
ball game today. That is San Diego manager, Bruce Botche* talking 
about Hitchcock's performance and the pitching of his team getting 
into the World Series. Game one of the fall classic is Saturday. The 
Padres will face the Yankees in New York. The Yankees beat the Cleveland 
Indians four games to two in the American League championship series.
