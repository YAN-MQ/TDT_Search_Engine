White House aides and Congressional leaders say that they are close 
to finishing the nations budget, after days of marathon talks and 
stop-gap spending bills. VOA's David Swann reports from Capital Hill. 
The parties agree on most of a 500 billion dollar package covering 
dozens of Federal programs and departments. This includes foreign 
aide for the fiscal year along with 18 billion dollars for the International 
Monetary Fund. But lawmakers say several disputes are still holding 
up a final accord. While claiming victory on spending for education, 
House Minority Leader Dick Gephardt says Democrats will not be rushed 
into passing the bill. Let me urge you all to understand that - uh, 
nothing in this is agreed to, finally until it's all agreed to. The 
budget battle has already kept Congress in session, days after members 
had already hoped to adjourn. The House and Senate have approved more 
short-term funding through Friday, to head off a politically disastrous 
Government shut-down. David Swann VOA News, Capitol Hill.
