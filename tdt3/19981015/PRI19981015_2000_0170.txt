President Clinton opened a White House conference on school violence 
today, announcing the result of a new study showing the problem may 
not be as bad as people think. NPR's Maura Liason reports. Last year, 
16 people died and dozens were wounded in several well publicized 
incidents of school violence. But a new report shows that overall, 
the rate of school crime is down, fewer students are bringing weapons 
to class and nine out of ten schools reported no violence at all. 
Still, President Clinton says the problem will not be solved until 
students feel safe in their schools. In too many schools there is 
still too much disrespect for authority and still too much intolerance 
of other students from different backgrounds. Our schools, all of 
them, must be sanctuaries of safety and civility and respect. Republicans 
criticized the White House report, saying that the answer is a juvenile 
justice bill that would toughen the penalties on juvenile offenders. 
The White House says it's opposing the Republican bill because it 
wants more emphasis on crime prevention. Maura Liason, NPR News, the 
White House. This is NPR news.
