Detroit Tigers interim manager Larry Parrish has accepted a two-year 
deal as manager. ``I was really wanting this opportunity,'' Parrish 
said Thursday by telephone from his home in Haines City, Florida. 
``Now that you've got it, it's a put up or shut up kind of thing.'' 
Parrish, who beat out more experienced Davey Johnson for the job, 
will sign a contract that has him managing through the 2000 season. 
The club has an option for him to continue in 2001. Financial terms 
were not disclosed, who stepped in as interim manager after the Tigers 
fired Buddy Bell on Sept. 1. The club had a 13-12 record under him. 
General manager Randy Smith said the job Parrish did in the last days 
of the season helped him win the job. ``After a rough start, they 
relaxed and played better for LP,'' Smith said in a conference call. 
``They were letting their natural ability take over and not worrying 
about making mistakes, so they didn't make as many.'' The 44-year-old 
Parrish has been with the Tigers for seven seasons, managing at four 
minor league stops. He made it clear after taking over for Bell on 
that he wanted a shot at the job full time.
