NAto ambassadors are scheduled to meet tomorrow to decide if they'll 
extend a hold on air strikes against Serb forces in Kosovo. NATO secretary-general 
Javier Solana signed an agreement today, allowing air surveillance 
over the region. He also sent a Stern warning to Yugoslav President 
Slobodan Milosevic to comply with Tuesday's ultimatum. It requires 
Milosevic to begin peace talks with ethnic Albanians, withdraw Serbian 
troops and allow 2,000 unarmed members of a verification team on the 
ground. So far, NATO officials say there's evidence of some troop 
withdrawal, but not nearly enough.
