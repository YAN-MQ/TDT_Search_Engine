The European Union Commission on Thursday cleared an accord between 
the EU and Japanese computer chip industries aimed at quick settlements 
of anti dumping cases. In a statement, the Commission said the agreement 
between the European Electronic Components Manufacturers and the Japanese 
Electrical Industries Association will not threaten competition in 
the European chip industries. The agreement calls for the creation 
of a common database on prices and supply of certain kinds of chips, 
to be used when an anti dumping case is brought by either side. The 
chip makers believe that the database will help to reach rapid settlement 
in such case.
