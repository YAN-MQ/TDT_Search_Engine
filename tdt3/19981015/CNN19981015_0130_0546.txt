With a look at your "Headline News weather," I'm Karen McGinnis. A 
storm is developing across the interior west. And as a result, we'll 
expect those snow levels to drop considerably. And expect some winter 
storm watches out from southeastern Idaho, across northern Utah and 
into southwestern sections of Wyoming. Farther to the north and the 
great plains, it will actually be mild ahead of the frontal system 
but expect a little bit of rainfall. And high pressure dominates the 
eastern seaboard. Temperatures will be fairly cool from the Great 
Lakes into New England and across Montana where temperatures mostly 
in the 40s there. Expect 80s even into the desert southwest with breezy 
weather conditions and cooler readings will prevail. And expect cloudy 
skies in Anchorage, Alaska. Our forecast for Friday shows that storm 
system exiting the Rockies and into the central plains. There will 
be a combination of rain and snow and windy conditions. On Saturday, 
the readings will be milder again across the southwestern U.S., but 
colder throughout the interior west. And on Sunday, the rain invades 
portions of Texas.
