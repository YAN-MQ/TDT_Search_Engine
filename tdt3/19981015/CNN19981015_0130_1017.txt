Layoffs at Merrill Lynch this week were a harsh sign of how the global 
economic turmoil is impacting the financial industry. And that's just 
the tip of the iceberg. Gary Tuchman explains. What do this catering 
company -- this flower shop -- and this upscale restaurant have in 
common? Worried about the market gyrations. Steve brown is in the 
catering industry. But like many of the millions who live and work 
in New York City, a good bit of his livelihood depends on the financial 
industry. Many of his clients are brokerage houses and banks. A continuing 
bear market would mean fewer company parties and smaller menus. If 
it was a real cutback, I will have to scale back in terms of the amount 
of employees that I have. You know, I'd have to really trim hours 
and change the way I do business. Heart to heart Flowers. George boulos' 
flower shop is located in the Wall Street area. So with layoffs and 
a volatile market, his outlook is anything but rosy. If it goes bad, 
yeah, we have to shut down. Everybody has to shut down, especially 
if they start firing people from down here like the way they're doing 
right now. Many economists believe New York City relies too heavily 
on Wall Street revenue. New York's mayor says Wall Street's UPS and 
Downs have a psychological impact on the city. Even people who aren't 
directly affected by it make decisions about how much they're gonna 
to spend, when they're going to spend it, based upon what's happening 
on Wall Street. With that in mind, New York's famous four seasons 
restaurant has just started offering a fixed-price dinner menu. The 
$59-A-person price, say the four season's managing partners, is about 
a 20% savings. I'm concerned that anything that affects our customer 
eventually will affect us. So the next time you hear of a particularly 
nonbullish day on Wall Street, think of the big apple's caterers, 
its florists, its restaurants, and while you're at it, its butchers, 
its bakers, its candlestickmakers. New York is a huge and varied city, 
but it relies heavily on one industry, just like many small towns.
