At a day-long White House conference on school violence, President 
Clinton called school safety a top priority of his administration. 
The president and members of his cabinet huddled with law enforcement 
officials, educators and students. The meeting coincided with the 
release of a report on school violence commissioned by the president. 
It found that while 16 people died in school attacks like the one 
in Paducah, Kentucky, the overall rate of school crime is declining. 
Nine out of ten public schools reported no violent crime at all.
