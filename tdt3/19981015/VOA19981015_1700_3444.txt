Many of our local FM and medium wave affiliates are about to take 
a two-minute break. You are listening to VOA News Now. It is coming 
up on 22 hours universal time which means we are saying good night 
to most of our listeners in the Middle East and in North Africa. Thanks 
for being with us and tune in again tomorrow beginning at 4 hours 
universal time when VOA News Now resumes on 7.17, 11.965 and 15. 205 
megahertz short wave. If you happen to be listening in the Persian 
Gulf area right now, we invite you to stay with us another couple 
of hours on medium wave at 1548 kilohertz. And if you are listening 
in the Eastern Mediterranean, we will be back on the air with VOA 
News Now, 30 minutes from now on 1260 kilohertz medium wave. Here 
is frequency change if you are listening in Africa. We are now going 
off 15.41, 15.445, 15.58 and 17.725 megahertz short wave. We invite 
you to retune to 7.34 megahertz or any of our other remaining frequencies.
