You're listening to the Voice Of America Broadcasting for Washington. 
I'm Imani Crosby along with Frank Whitis bringing you this hour of 
VOA News now. It's 10:19 Universal Time and here is the top story 
we're following this hour. NATO Secretary General Javier Solana says 
Yugoslavia is still not complying with International demands to pull 
its forces out of Kosovo. We'll have more on that story later. Time 
now for a look at sports, and here is Jim Stevenson.
