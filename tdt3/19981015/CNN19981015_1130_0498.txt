Cuba's state news agency says the little David of the Caribbean has 
won a victory over Goliath -- the United States. The statement was 
in reference to a vote at the United Nations over U.S. sanctions on 
Cuba. Richard Roth has more. The assembly will now take a decision 
on draft resolution a5316. Ambassadors reached for their voting buttons. 
But the result was widely predictable. For the seventh straight year, 
the general assembly overwhelmingly voted to condemn the U.S. trade 
embargo on its neighbor Cuba. On behalf of many peoples who might 
be the next victims today or tomorrow, I ask you to demand from the 
ungs to put an end to its cruel blockade. Cuba's call was answered 
by all parts of the world, including a country currently under U.N. 
sanctions. Those who think they can play God on earth are doing precisely 
the contrary. They run against the will of God. U.S. allies voted 
against it because of legislation that punishes people who do business 
in Cuba. We're very much against the attempt by the United States 
to force sovereign states to change their policies towards Cuba by 
aplaying the sew-called Helms-Burton act. The U.S. and Israel were 
the only nations to vote no. Rather than accepting the mistaken premise 
of this resolution, the United States urges nations committed to democracy 
and human rights to join us in forging a multilateral effort to promote 
peaceful, democratic transition in Cuba. With that in mind, noting 
a lack of comprehensive Cuba policy in over 38 years, several current 
and former key policymakers are urging President Clinton to create 
a bipartisan commission to make an objective analysis of U.S. policy 
toward Cuba. I'm recommending a look at our policy, because every 
year, there's a debate in the United Nations. Every year, there's 
discussion within the United States, with the changed conditions in 
the world, with the collapse of the Soviet Union, what the impact 
of that should be on our relations with Cuba. Unless there is a change, 
the general assembly will keep the Cuba item on its annual agenda. 
Meanwhile, the number of countries voting for Cuba continues to grow.
