Relatives of Palestinians held in Israeli jails on Thursday blocked 
traffic near a Jewish settlement and demanded that the fate of the 
detainees be discussed at this week's Mideast peace summit at Wye 
Plantation near Washington. About 250 Palestinians rallied at a crossroads 
between Gaza City and the Jewish settlement bloc of Gush Katif. They 
carried banners reading, ``Wye must lead to the release of prisoners.'' 
Traffic backed up, holding up Jewish settlers and Palestinian motorists 
for about 20 minutes. Palestinian policemen took up positions between 
the protesters and the Israeli motorists. The protesters eventually 
left quietly. The protest coincided with the start of the Mideast 
peace summit in which Israeli and Palestinian negotiators will try 
to reach an agreement on an Israeli troop pullback from the West Bank 
and Palestinian security measures. One of the issues on the table 
is the release of 3,000 Palestinians held by Israel for security offenses. 
Hisham Abdel Razik, who has been negotiating the release of the prisoners 
with Israel, accompanied Palestinian leader Yasser Arafat to Wye Plantation.
