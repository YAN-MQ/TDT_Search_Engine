Philippine President Joseph Estrada urged Asia-Pacific nations Thursday 
to continue moves to stop discrimination against women in the economy 
and society. ``We must make sure that the avenue of progress is wide 
enough to accommodate all men and women, and in such a way that not 
too many, least of all women, are facing the backs of the lucky few 
who are at the head of the march,'' Estrada said. Much progress has 
already been made in removing distinctions in race, religion, color 
and class, Estrada said in a statement at a ministerial conference 
of the Asia Pacific Economic Cooperation forum. ``But the world has 
yet to make enough progress in looking at gender and seeing that it 
is not a difference that should make a difference,'' he said. He said 
that in the Philippines, women still have to fight for their rights 
but promised he will give them support. ``I will be the last to deny 
that Filipino women still have less in life. But I will be the first 
to make sure that they will have more in law,'' he said. In her opening 
statement at the two-day conference on women, Philippine Vice President 
Gloria Arroyo said ``gender equity will not evolve naturally'' and 
governments must take action to remove discrimination. ``Women will 
not be empowered by market forces if they do not have the power to 
have themselves felt as a force in the market,'' she said. ``The market 
is not in the business of empowerment. It is in the business of recognizing 
power already possessed.'' She said women's participation in the economy 
is being hampered by their subordinate role in society. Women are 
being relegated to household work, have fewer educational opportunities 
than men, and face wage discrimination and poor working conditions, 
she said. Businesswomen also have less access to loans to boost their 
enterprises than businessmen, Arroyo said. Women's significant contributions 
to the economy also are not properly measured and valued, she added. 
She said the conference will urge leaders to integrate women's issues 
in APEC programs, conduct gender impact analysis of all projects of 
the economic grouping and ensure equitable participation of women 
in all of its structures and forums.
