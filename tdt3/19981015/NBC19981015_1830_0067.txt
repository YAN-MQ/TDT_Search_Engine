Good evening. The sound you hear tonight is cheering, from Wall Street 
to large investors and small. Cheering for the surprising news late 
today, interest rates are going down again, for the second time in 
less than three weeks. That set off a buying spree on Wall Street, 
one of the sharpest one-day point gains ever. The Dow jumped more 
than 330 points and the NASDAQ was up more than 70 points. That's 
exactly the kick-start the federal reserve was looking for. And we 
begin tonight with NBC's Mike Jensen, on the announcement and what 
likely lies ahead. Today's surprise rate cut by the federal reserve 
is great news for millions of Americans planning to take out a loan 
to buy a house or a car, or charge a holiday gift on their credit 
card. It takes the fed's key interest rate down to its lowest level 
in four years. Credit is the lifeblood of the U.S. economy, and the 
federal reserve decided the U.S. needed a transfusion. So it provided 
a dramatic one, not even waiting for its next official meeting a month 
from now, and cutting not just one rate, but two, each by a quarter 
of a percentage point. The federal funds rate, which banks charge 
one another, cut to 5% today, after a similar cut just two weeks ago, 
and the discount rate, which the fed charges for money it loans to 
banks, to 4 3/4%, the first cut in that rate since 1992. 30-year fixed 
rate mortgages, now averaging 6.9%, are expected to drop by one-quarter 
of a point. I think that you will see interest rates probably hit 
their all-time lows for this year, and hopefully that will pe pet 
U yate that into next year. 15-year fixed rate mortgages, now at 6.6%, 
are expected to come down a quarter of a point. Same thing with adjustable 
rate mortgages, now averaging 5.5%. and home equity loans, now at 
9.3%. auto loan rates, now averaging 8.6%, will come down, and so 
will credit cards with a variable rate, now at 16%. And there may 
be more to come. Analysts say if the economy continues to edge toward 
recession, the fed will probably cut rates again, doing everything 
it can to keep this extraordinary period of economic growth alive.
