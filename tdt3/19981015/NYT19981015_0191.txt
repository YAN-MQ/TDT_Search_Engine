``Practical Magic'' has a new look for Halloween: super-cute. It's 
Barbie Joins a Coven time as Sandra Bullock and Nicole Kidman shake 
their long flossy hair and play witch sisters with otherworldly decorative 
qualities. In a bouncy, bubble-brained movie with the look of a shelter 
magazine, they flounce through a domesticated story in which magic 
is for dealing with menfolk and brooms look all too comfortably at 
home. ``C'mon, ladies, let's clean house!'' is the battle cry in the 
big broom scene at the end. Based on Alice Hoffman's fanciful novel 
and directed with go-for-broke prettiness by Griffin Dunne, ``Practical 
Magic'' is nothing but a guilty pleasure. Despite a transcendently 
silly story line and a lot more froufrou touches than the traffic 
will bear, it's liable to work as escapism for anyone who thinks ``Little 
Women'' has too much grit. The stars are svelte and charming, in a 
hopelessly retrograde way. (``What wouldn't I do for the right guy?'' 
wonders Ms. Kidman, who has never before made herself quite this dizzy.) 
And they have delightful comic support in Dianne Wiest and Stockard 
Channing, as the senior witches in the family, benign old sisters 
who depart unexpectedly for a solstice celebration at one point in 
the story. ``We can't back out,'' they tell Ms. Bullock's Sally and 
Ms. Kidman's Gillian. ``We're on the committee.'' These are all members 
of the Owens family, and they share a curse: men who fall in love 
with them have a tendency to be struck dead. ``Boys looked at her 
and got so dizzy they had to be rushed to the emergency room for a 
hit of oxygen or a pint of new blood,'' Ms. Hoffman wrote of Gillian, 
the family flirt. Sally, the homebody, is so much more down to earth 
that she winds up running a botanicals shop. ``Practical Magic'' is 
the kind of movie that loves to look at all the matching bottles and 
hear her talk about hand lotion. At first the sisters spurn their 
witchy heritage and reserve their magic for little things, like putting 
the coffee spoon on auto-stir. Then Gillian has an abusive boyfriend 
(because witches have as many talk show issues as anyone else) and 
he winds up a teeny bit dead. This causes problems, so out come the 
potion recipes. Sally and Gillian do something clever with needles 
and Redi-Whip, and before you can say snazzy special effects, the 
evil but handsome boyfriend (Goran Visnjic) is making even more trouble. 
Most magically, Sally's Mr. Right (Aidan Quinn) shows up as a detective 
on the boyfriend's trail. ``Practical Magic'' is also the kind of 
movie in which the detective likes cactus-shaped pancakes and is staying 
in an inn that's as picture-perfect as the witches' charming lair. 
Not content to vie for the cover of House and Garden, ``Practical 
Magic'' also makes vegetables look lovely whenever vegetables appear, 
and throws in baby-boom chestnuts on the soundtrack. (Stevie Nicks, 
doyenne of witchcraft chic, is among those heard.) Fortunately, its 
leading actresses are capable of real enchantment, enough to outshine 
the prefabricated kind. ``Practical Magic'' was written by Robin Swicord 
and Akiva Goldsman and also by Adam Brooks, one of the writers of 
the ``Beloved'' screenplay. Coincidentally or not, both films culminate 
in supportive rallying by groups of women who join forces to help 
sisters in need. ``Practical Magic'' is rated PG-13 (Parents strongly 
cautioned). It includes violence, profanity and witchy vamping. PRODUCTION
