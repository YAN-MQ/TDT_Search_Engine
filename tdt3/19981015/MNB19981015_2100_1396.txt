Thank you, Brian. Lot more as we continue on the next half-hour. Ever 
since the Starr report there has been talk that this other matter, 
the Paula Jones, remember that one? Might be settled. A report from 
Little Rock on where the two parties stand. Plus a report from "dateline 
NBC" this evening, inside the world of stolen airline tickets. Seemingly 
worthless but costing people millions. Plus Oprah Winfrey talks about 
her attempt to get the one interview everybody seems to want in her 
business.
