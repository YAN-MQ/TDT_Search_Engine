President Clintons on that are correct the from tomorrow morning's 
wimingse, Clinton may not argue the facts if impeachability is defined. 
He might refrain from disputing the facts if the G.O.P. agrees to 
focus instead on whether the charges against him, even if true, rise 
to the level of impeachable offenses. That's all according to democratic 
sources as interviewed on background by the "whington times." "Chicago 
tribune," the Pope has come out with his encyclical. The most traveled 
man to ever be Pope. Certainly one of the most popular in history, 
saying that he's worried about attacks on the church sewing despair 
among even some Roman Catholics. He's saying go back to the core beliefs. 
Now sheer Jane pauley. Tonight on "time & again," the Paula Jones 
case. More than four years after filing her lawsuit, more than seven 
years after Bill Clinton's alleged sexual harassment, Jones is still 
in the news, and her charge has set the stage for the Lewinsky scandal 
now threatening the president with impeachment. A look at the Paula 
Jones story, including an exclusive interview with Jones herself. 
Up next on "time & again." "Time & again" hosted by Jane pauley next 
up here on MSNBC. And that is our broadcast for this Thursday night. 
We hope to see you right back here at this same time tomorrow night. 
I'm Brian Williams and for all of us here who work the night shift 
not far from the helix leading to the Lincoln tunnel, good night, 
everybody. [captioning performed by the nationalx "The news with Brian 
Williams" is next. For all of us who prepared this program for you, 
we thank you, and we bid you play ball.
