Glenn Hoddle kept his tenuous grip on the England coach's job when 
his side dawdled to a 3-0 win over Luxembourg's part-timers in Wednesday's 
Euro 2000 qualifier. But it came at the expense of public respect. 
Once again the players were booed off the field by their own fans 
and that reaction was reflected in the tabloid Daily Mirror's headlines 
after a less than impressive win over Luxembourg. ``Boring, boring, 
Hoddle: Three jeers as fans turn on England again.'' the paper said. 
``What a sorry shower of mismanaged, uninspired, disorganized amateurs. 
And no, we're not talking about Luxembourg,'' the Mirror splashed 
across its back page. True, Hoddle went into the game with everything 
to lose. Luxembourg had won only three of its previous 68 matches 
and has lost 11 in a row. England desperately needed the win after 
losing 2-1 to Sweden in Stockholm and stumbling to a 0-0 tie with 
Bulgaria at Wembley on Saturday. The visitors were spared international 
humiliation in the sixth minute when Luxembourg's Dany Theis sent 
a penalty shot over the bar and into the stands, wasting a chance 
to go 1-0 up. One commentator said England had been saved by the worst 
penalty attempt in history. But England recovered and scored first 
through the teenage star Michael Owen in the 19th minute. Captain 
Alan Shearer added a second goal with a penalty in the 40th minute 
and Gareth Southgate scored in the final minute to add a touch of 
respectability to the scoreline. A big win would have saved face. 
But a mediocre victory over a bunch of amateurs only served to increase 
calls for Hoddle's scalp. The tabloid Sun newspaper said the angry 
fans chanted ``Boring, boring Hoddle'' and ``What a load of rubbish'' 
as England ``scrambled and scraped to victory.'' The Sun reported 
that the abuse came just four days after Hoddle was pelted with rubbish 
following the ``bore draw'' with Bulgaria. England supporter David 
Timmin _ one of thousands who took time off work and spent up to travel 
to Luxembourg and sit in the rain watching the game _ was quoted saying 
England was a ``shambles and an utter disgrace.'' ``I had to pinch 
myself because it looked like two pub teams playing in a Sunday morning 
league,'' he said. Under the headline ``You Lucky Hod'', the Daily 
Mail reported that not even a three goal win saved Hoddle from the 
boos of a dissatisfied army of travelling fans. Yet the Evening Standard 
said Hoddle still had the full support of his playing staff. Hoddle 
is due to go into negotiations with the Football Association within 
days to extend his contract and while he's seemingly out of favor 
with the fans and the media, the players have backed him. The Standard 
quoted Phil Neville saying ``the boss has our total support.'' ``We 
played well enough in the first half but playing two matches in five 
days took its toll a bit in the second half,'' he said. Southgate 
was quoted saying Hoddle was starting the feel the pressure. ``It's 
time the players rallied around and lifted him. When the fans jeer 
the boss, they are jeering us as well. It's a collective thing. There 
is no doubt we are behind him,'' he said. Darren Anderton said ``the 
booing (Wednesday) was a surprise considering we won 3-0.''
