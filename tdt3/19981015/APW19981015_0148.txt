Russia returned to Japan the remains of 13 former prisoners of war 
found in a former concentration camp where they were kept from 1945-48, 
the ITAR-Tass news agency said Thursday. Workers supervised by a delegation 
from the Japanese Health Service and Social Welfare Ministry have 
been digging up the remains from the Khalaza-2 concentration camp 
in the Russian Far East since the beginning of October. Russia and 
Japan have been working together for six years to find the remains 
of missing POWs, said Valentina Buraya, first deputy chairman of the 
Primorye branch of the Russian Peace Fund. Japan is paying for the 
project. Buraya said 113 burial sites have been found in the Primorye 
region alone and that 1,100 remains have been returned to Japan. Of 
the 600,000 Japanese POWs held in the Soviet Union after the war, 
60,000 died and were buried there. Russia and Japan have never formally 
signed a peace treaty formally ending hostilities.
