The message that the late Gene Autry conveyed in 3 minutes, 13 seconds 
of perennially popular song takes 90 minutes to transmit in the pedestrian 
animated film that goes by the tortured title ``Rudolph the Red-Nosed 
Reindeer: The Movie.'' Rushing the Christmas season by more than two 
months but just in time to position itself among Halloween's tricks 
or treats, this plodding though well-intended lesson in nasal tolerance 
may divert very young and indiscriminating filmgoers. But any among 
them who have honed their baby teeth on Disney animation cannot be 
faulted for finding this ``Rudolph'' just another in a herd of animated 
films that are long on yearning and short on magic. This candy-colored 
account of the travail and coming of age of the reindeer with a difference 
follows a snowy storytelling trail well marked by the details, props 
and characters of animated Disney films from ``Snow White and the 
Seven Dwarfs,'' ``Pinocchio,'' ``Bambi,'' ``Cinderella'' and ``Peter 
Pan'' to ``The Little Mermaid'' and ``The Lion King.'' But imitation 
often lacks inspiration, and ``Rudolph,'' though set in and around 
Santa's Village and populated with sprites and elves, never achieves 
enchantment. Its animation lacks the subtlety of art; the mouths of 
its characters remain unsynchronized with the dialogue, and the film's 
new songs _ with lyrics like ``I'll bury that old gizzard in a wizard 
of a blizzard'' _ rely too heavily on simplistic rhymes. Produced 
and directed by Bill Kowalchuk, written by Michael Aschner and with 
music and lyrics by Michael Lloyd and Al Kasha, ``Rudolph'' employs 
the voices of John Goodman as Santa Claus, Debbie Reynolds as Mrs. 
Santa Claus and Whoopi Goldberg as the evil ice queen, Stormella. 
Eric Idle gives voice to Slyly, the Arctic fox, and Bob Newhart to 
Leonard, the lumbering polar bear, who become poor Rudolph's sidekicks 
after he runs off into the frozen wastes of the North Pole when life 
deals him a few too many harsh blows. Besides the taunts of his schoolmates 
addressed to his red nose, Rudolph, the son of Blitzen, has been banished 
from the Reindeer Games that often herald a coveted future as a Flyer, 
one of the reindeer that pull Santa's sleigh. And it seems as if Rudolph 
may never win the hoof of the fair Zoey, the reindeer of his dreams. 
Never mind that Santa has assured him: ``We're all different on the 
outside, son. But what counts, young buck, what really counts, is 
what's inside our hearts.'' Rudolph will never grasp the wisdom of 
such platitudes until his character is tested. And when rotten old 
Stormella takes Zoey prisoner and uses a magic icicle to conjure up 
a terrible storm and lower visibility on Christmas eve, Rudolph gets 
a chance to light up his life. But as animated films go, this one 
doesn't cast a lingering glow. PRODUCTION NOTES: `RUDOLPH THE RED-NOSED
