Russia promised a top U.S. State Department envoy it was trying to 
tighten export controls to limit illegal weapons proliferation, a 
news agency said Thursday. Export controls and Russia's financial 
crisis dominated meetings this week with Stephen Sestanovich, an adviser 
to Secretary of State Madeleine Albright, and other U.S. officials. 
``We intend to continue active and close cooperation with the U.S. 
in export control,'' said Nikolai Berdyuzha, secretary of Russia's 
Security Council, according to the Interfax news agency. The government 
has submitted a bill on export control to the lower house of parliament, 
he said. Still, Berdyuzha insisted that stricter export controls didn't 
mean Russia would cut back on legitimate arms deals, which are a crucial 
source of income for the cash-starved country. ``This does not mean 
we will be breaking legitimate mutually beneficial trade and economic 
relations with other countries,'' he said. Sestanovich was accompanied 
by Treasury aide Mark Medish and Carlos Pascual of the U.S. National 
Security Council, Interfax said. They met with President Boris Yeltsin's 
foreign policy adviser, Sergei Prikhodko, Deputy Central Bank Chairman 
Andrei Kozlov and Deputy Foreign Minister Georgy Mamedov. They also 
met officials from the International Monetary Fund and World Bank 
in Moscow.
