Police have arrested a suspect in the rape-murder of an English schoolgirl 
in France, while French police were pursuing yet another suspect after 
a rape victim identified a police sketch of the girl's killer. The 
murdered girl, 13-year-old Caroline Dickinson,was raped and smothered 
in a hostel in Brittany in 1966. A 41-year-old man was arrested Friday 
in Frome in southwestern England, and was released on bail pending 
the outcome of DNA tests, Avon and Somerset police said. His name 
was not released. Police in the Meurthe-et-Moselle area of eastern 
France have launched a new search for a suspect, the newspaper Est 
Republicain reported Thursday. The order came from judge Renaud Van 
Ruymbeke, who is investigating the slaying. A student in Nancy, in 
eastern France, said the police sketch of Dickinson's attacker looked 
much like the man who raped her while he held a knife to her throat 
on May 25, 1993, the newspaper said. Dickinson was raped and then 
strangled in a youth hostel in Pleine Fougeres, Brittany, while on 
a five-day trip with 39 other youngsters and five adults from the 
school where she was a pupil. Nearly 700 voluntary DNA tests carried 
out to find Caroline's killer on Pleine Fougeres villagers, hostel 
staff, and boys and teachers from the school have all proved negative. 
However, French police were still receiving calls following the release 
in February of a composite picture of a suspect seen in the two days 
before the murder. The composite was compiled with the help of Caroline's 
friends. Her mother, Sue Dickinson, has begun a civil claim for damages 
against Cornwall County Council, alleging breach of duty and negligence.
