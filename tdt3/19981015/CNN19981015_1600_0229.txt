While the talks are under way in the United States, people in the 
mideast are left to hope that they will lead to a new agreement. Jerrold 
Kessel has their story. If there are vaunted expectations elsewhere 
of the mideast summit, they're not matched here in halhoul, one part 
of the West Bank that could benefit directly from the relocation of 
Israeli troops and the assumption by Palestinians of full control. 
"I hope," says this man, "the agreement will be real, not just a piece 
of paper, but something that will be implemented." Now it's about 
five, six years, okay? And the peace -- what's the peace doing for 
the people? The latest poll among Palestinians finds a healthy majority 
still committed to a peace process. But ominously, almost two in three 
Palestinians now doubt whether a final peace with Israel can be forged. 
It's good. Of course it's good. but? But we need more, more, much 
more land. We need much more land, because -- to see our border. The 
worry is that their leader will be browbeaten into making extra concessions. 
"Yasser Arafat can't do anything," he says. Both Clinton and Netanyahu 
will pressure Arafat into accepting much less than our demands. Bitter 
concern -- the mood of ultranationalist Israelis rallying on the eve 
of the summit. Extreme right elements in his coalition are vowing 
to topple Benjamin Netanyahu if he agrees to further troop pullbacks. 
This is a catastrophe. And if he is going to do it, he will not be 
the prime minister. But the majority of Israelis are believed to want 
another land-transfer deal. And the Israeli leader could be banking 
on that. It's high time to do something, because the situation now 
is quite impossible. This peace agreement was around our corner for 
a long time, and nobody did anything. One thing on which even peace 
supporters -- Israelis and Palestinians alike -- agree, the deep bitterness 
and mutual mistrust created by a year and a half of deadlock won't 
be easily eased, even if an agreement is reached at the summit. Jerrold 
Kessel, CNN, halhoul, on the West Bank.
