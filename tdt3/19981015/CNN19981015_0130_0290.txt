The house Judiciary committee may have a lighter load in its impeachment 
inquiry against President Clinton. The committee's majority counsel 
has outlined 15 charges, but chairman Henry Hyde now says the panel 
should focus on what he calls the core charges. He says those would 
include allegations of lying under oath, obstruction of justice and 
witness tampering. Hyde says it's necessary to streamline the process 
to meet his goal of finishing the inquiry by the end of the year. 
The White House says Hyde may be worried about a voter backlash against 
the way republicans have handled the investigation.
