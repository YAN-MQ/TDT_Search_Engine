Many of our local FM and medium wave affiliates are about to take 
a two-minute break. This is VOA News Now. CROSBY: It's Thursday, October 
15, 1998 and on this date in 1892, mechanical voting machines were 
used for the first time in an election in the United States. It happened 
in the town of Lockport, New York. Mechanical voting machines have 
been developed to eliminate, as much as possible, fraud, error, and 
carelessness on the part of voters and election officials. The machines 
also sped the process of counting votes. And on this date in history 
on October 15, 1950, President Harry Truman met with General Douglas 
MacArthur at Wake Island in the Pacific. They were there to discuss 
U.S. policies in the Korean War. The president called the meeting 
after General MacArthur, the commander of UN forces in Korea, persisted 
in issuing statements about the conduct of the Korean War that contradicted 
Mr. Truman's stated policies. As the constitutional Commander-In-Chief, 
the president believed he had the authority to reestablish controls 
over General MacArthur, a very proud man, who was once one of the 
most popular military leaders of the time. Mr. Truman and the General 
had left Wake Island in agreement, but that did not seem to be the 
way it worked out. Time to share with you a little frequency information.
