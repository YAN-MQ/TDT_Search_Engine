Navy researchers say they have tested a DNA vaccine on healthy humans 
with some success. It was used against malaria, but researchers hope 
the technique could eventually be used to prevent diseases like cancer 
and AIDS. They say the vaccine triggered an immune response in 11 
of the 20 people tested, though it probably did not give them full 
protection from malaria.
