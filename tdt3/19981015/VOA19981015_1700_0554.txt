And now to that other world trouble spot which has been much in the 
headlines of late, Kosovo. A spokesman for ethnic Albanian rebels 
in Kosovo says Yugoslavia is violating the Kosovo peace deal worked 
out earlier this week. Lisa Shrine in Geneva reports the rebel spokesman 
told reporters western nations know about the violations but are keeping 
silent. A spokesman for the rebel Kosovo Liberation Army, Bardil Mocmuti* 
says Serb troops bombed and set fire to about 20 villages in Central 
Kosovo on Wednesday. He says the bombing and shelling of innocent 
civilians went on throughout the night. Mr. Mocmuti says western nations 
know about the attacks through pictures taken from satellites but 
he says they are remaining silent so as not to cast doubt on the Kosovo 
peace deal announced Tuesday. Mr. Mocmuti says he received his information 
about the alleged Serb attacks from KLA military headquarters in Kosovo. 
There has been no independent confirmation of the alleged attacks. 
Mr. Mocmuti says the Kosovo Liberation Army, the KLA, has gone along 
with the agreement in order to overt what he calls a humanitarian 
catastrophe. Mr. Mocmuti says the KLA has avoided a confrontation 
with Serb forces. He says the KLA's continued respect for the cease-fire 
will depend on the pressure the international community places on 
Yugoslav President Slobadan Milosevic to stop the Serb bombing campaign. 
The rebel spokesman says NATO should attack Serb military installations 
immediately, because the only language the Yugoslav president understands 
is force. Mr. Mocmuti says no political solution to the Kosovo conflict 
will be possible unless the KLA takes part in the negotiations. But 
he also says the KLA will settle for nothing less than complete independence 
from Serbia. Western nations have said they do not support an independent 
Kosovo. Lisa Shrine for VOA News, Geneva.
