Joining me once again for some perspective on all this, CNBC's Ron 
Insana. ron? Could this possibly mean that the roller coaster ride 
is now over for awhile? It may be over for a bhil. Since last Thursday 
when the Dow traded as low as 7540 in the middle of the day, the stock 
markets come roaring back. Many folks believe that the stock market 
flew or at least hoped the fed would take the action it took today. 
Some of the wig winners were sensitive to economic reductions. General 
electronic surging. Merrill Lynch up four. High technology kops also 
did quite well with Dell and America on line up sharply. Investors 
are not only looking at interest rates here but the global economy. 
Is that going to catch up to investors in America. Absolutely. Asian 
markets are expected to rally over night. When they happen here and 
elsewhere, it suggests that you never want to fight the federal reserve 
or any central bank. If they are cutting interest rates, that is historically 
good for the stock market. Stock prices historically have gone up 
rather substantially. Interest rates are coming down at home. If that 
is buttressed by rate cuts overseas, that is good for investors.
