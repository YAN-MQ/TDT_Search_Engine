Today the commercial airline industry started absorbing what could 
be an expensive proposal from the F.A.A. that almost all of the world's 
12,000 passenger jets need to have their insulation replaced. It's 
a huge job. The feds have their reasons for doing it. The recommendation 
gru out of the investigation in last month's Swissair crash off Nova 
Scotia, indications that a fire might have played a role in that disaster. 
NBC's Fred Francis starts us off with more on what this means. The 
insulation on nearly every passenger jet in the world, 12,000 of them, 
could quickly fuel a fire when exposed to intense heat. And the F.A.A. 
says it all should be replaced. Yet the F.A.A. and the industry insists 
this is not an immediate safety issue. This is a very good example 
of the aviation safety system working. The reason flying is as safe 
as it is is you have dedicated professionals going through this type 
of process. The agency whose rules are followed worldwide stopped 
short of demanding immediate replacement but made it clear this a 
firm order would come in six months. F.A.A. detracters say this is 
a safety threat that regulators have known about for years but ignored. 
The F.A.A. never misses an opportunity to miss an opportunity, and 
this is just anher case of it. Investigators of last month's Swissair 
crash in which 2289 died in the frigid waters of Nova Scotia suspect 
this a raging fire on board involved the doomed plane's insulation. 
This hidden layer of noise and climate protection is sandwiched between 
a plane's outer shell and the interior. There have been insulation 
fires on four aircraft in recent years after one in China, the F.A.A. 
was warned that the insulation was dangerous. It dismissed the Chinese 
warning. They act as if they're the start of all information. They 
disregard information that comes from anyplace else. We had this with 
the A.T.R. crash, even had this with operations in valujet. Critics 
say today's recommendation is just one more tombstone decision by 
the agency. Acting after a major crash instead of after a red flag 
is first raised. Fred Francis, NBC news, Washington.
