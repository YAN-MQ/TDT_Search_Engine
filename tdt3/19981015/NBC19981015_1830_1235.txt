Thousands of ethnic Albanians in Kosovo are still camped out in the 
Woods, afraid to go home after eight months of repression by Milosevic's 
forces. But this is a two-sided battle and as one of Kosovo's main 
voices of conscience told NBC's Ron Allen tonight, there is plenty 
of blame to go around. In the fire and smoke of war, close to the 
front lines, stands an ancient monastery. This Serb priest who boldly 
speaks out against both sides, Serb and Albanian, for the violence 
destroying his Homeland. This is a tragedy. There is responsibility 
on both sides and we must all work hard to overcome this. He blames 
the Serbs for much of of the blood shed saying that Slobodan Milosevic 
should stand trial for crimes against humanity. The church nearly 
700 years old he prays more than many hours a day. His computers, 
linked to the Internet, his own web site, more then 200 E-mails each 
day with the world leaders, journalists, anyone who will listen to 
his pleas for peace. You are working on your every day duties and 
you can hear the shots and explosions and you really know people are 
suffering on both sides. Just down the road, the bombed out villages 
that Kosovo's refugees left behind, yet the monastery remains untouched. 
Father sava easily could have hidden behind the walls of the monastery. 
It's rare to hear a voice like his speak out so forcefully against 
his fellow Serbs. He's even been called a traitor. But father sava 
says he condemns all acts of violence Serb, Albanian and even NATO 
for threatening air strikes. Now he prays the promises of peace will 
be kept. I think that the worst is past, at least I believe so. I'm 
trying to be optimistic. Father sava says some day, he hopes to devote 
more time to the spiritual world inside his monastery. But for now, 
with the specter of war around him, he will not stop his mission of 
peace. Ron Allen, NBC news, Kosovo.
