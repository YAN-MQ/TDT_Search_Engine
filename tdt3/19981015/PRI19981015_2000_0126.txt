The Federal Reserve has cut short term interest rates in an effort 
to keep lenders from tightening credit requirements too much and slowing 
the economy. The Central Bank cut the Federal funds rate, the rate 
that banks charge each other for overnight loans by a quarter point 
to five percent. The discount rate, which is the amount the Fed charges 
for emergency loans to commercial banks was also cut by a quarter 
point to 5.75 percent -- or to 4.75 percent. The last rate cut came 
on September 29th when the Central Bank cut the Federal funds rate 
but left the discount rate unchanged. The cut came as a surprise because 
it was the first time in four years that the Fed has changed rate 
policy between meetings of the policy making open market committee.
