Saying he could wiggle his new fingers _ but declining to do so for 
the cameras _ a man who underwent the first hand transplant in decades 
said Thursday the operation was ``a miracle.'' ``My hand is very fine,'' 
said 48-year-old Clint Hallam of New Zealand. ``I've probably never 
been so well in all my life.'' Hallam smiled through a 40-minute news 
conference at the Edouard Herriot hospital in this southeastern French 
city, except when the subject of his criminal past was brought up. 
News reports say Hallam is due to appear before an Australian court 
in January on seven fraud-related charges, relating to a marketing 
investment scam allegedly worth Australian dlrs 1 million (U.S. dlrs 
620,000.) Hallam was serving a two-year sentence for fraud in New 
Zealand when the accident occurred in prison _ not, as Hallam originally 
claimed, at a building construction site. At the news conference, 
he wore a plaster cast up to his elbow, and his arm was propped up 
on a large white splint. The skin on his new hand appeared slightly 
wrinkled. Twenty-two days after the 13-hour operation, doctors said 
Hallam was doing fine. ``Mr. Hallam is in an excellent condition after 
the operation and is showing no signs of complications,'' said Dr. 
Jean-Michel Dubernard, co-head of the transplant team. After transplants, 
patients must take anti-rejection drugs, which can prove fatal since 
they supress the immune system. That in turn raises the risk of infection, 
or even cancer. The only other known hand transplant was in Ecuador 
in the 1960s, and the patient's body rejected the hand after two weeks. 
A Kentucky hospital is planning an operation similar to Hallam's.
