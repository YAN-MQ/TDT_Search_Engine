A United Nations police monitoring mission in Croatia's tense eastern 
region ended Thursday, ending a six-year presence by the international 
organization in the area. U.N. troops were first deployed in eastern 
Croatia, known as Eastern Slavonia, to ensure an internationally brokered 
cease-fire agreement between government forces and minority rebel 
Serbs in 1992. During its tenure, the mission evolved from a peacekeeping 
force in the early stages to a monitor of the ethnically mixed local 
police units. In its final phase, the mission mostly kept tabs on 
ethnically motivated crime and the process of refugee returns. Croatia 
fought a bloody war with local Serbs backed by the Yugoslav army in 
1991 after it seceded from the old Yugoslav federation. More than 
10,000 lives were lost in the fighting, while hundreds of thousands 
were left homeless. The situation in this once-volatile region has 
calmed significantly in the last year but there is a need for further 
reconciliation between the former war foes and large-scale economic 
reconstruction. The Organization for Security and Cooperation in Europe, 
a 54-nation forum which has monitor missions in European trouble spots, 
will assume the responsibilities held by the United Nations.
