The United States has one of the highest rates of teen pregnancy among 
industrialized nations. But the numbers are declining. A new study 
shows the U.S. teen pregnancy rate at a 20-year low, down 14% since 
1990. The study indicates the number of teen abortions dropped 25% 
between 1990 and 1995. Two factors apparently are contributing to 
the declining pregnancy rate. Fewer teens are having sex, and more 
of those who are are using contraceptives.
