President Clinton has officially opened talks between Israeli and 
Palestinian leaders in Maryland. He told them a peace agreement involved 
risks and compromises and that there was hard work ahead. Discussions 
over security promised to be difficult. Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin 
Netanyahu says there must be direct linkage between a genuine Palestinian 
crackdown on Islamic militant groups and in Israeli troop withdrawal. 
Any movement to give them additional land is premised on their fighting 
terrorism, as I said, in word and in deed. And if, again, if they 
do so, then we have an ability to move forward. Both sides expect 
Washington to play a role in verifying whether the Palestinians are 
meeting their security commitments. Palestinian leader Yasser Arafat 
said no country to be expected to eradicate all forms of violence. 
I can give 100 percent but no one in the world can give 100 percent 
result. Palestinian leader Yasser Arafat. The talks at the Wye Plantation 
Center in Maryland are expected to last all weekend.
