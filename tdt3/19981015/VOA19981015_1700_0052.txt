President Clinton has launched a summit of the Israeli and Palestinian 
leaders aimed at ending a long stalemate in the middle east peace 
process. Mr. Clinton says the talks offer a chance to break the logjam 
and finally take the next essential steps for peace. I believe there 
are certain realities that underlie these negotiations. First, Israelis 
and Palestinians are neighbors and what they must do, they must do 
together, or it will not be done at all. Second, mutual respect and 
understanding is required for any meaningful and enduring agreement. 
Otherwise, there can be no honorable principal compromise. The president 
spoke after a 40-minute opening session at the White House with Israel's 
Prime Minister, Benjamin Netanyahu and Palestinian President, Yasser 
Arafat. The real work of the four-day summit will be done at the secluded 
Y River Conference Center east of Washington. Some experts are optimistic 
about the two sides coming to an agreement. Daniel Goret* is a Mid 
East specialist at the Center for Strategic and International Studies 
in Washington. I think that the Eastern Shore Summit probably has 
the best chance we have seen in about two years for a breakthrough 
or it will be significant progress towards peace in the middle east. 
Mid East specialist David Goret. At issue in the summit is completion 
of an interim agreement for further Israeli withdrawal from the West 
Bank in exchange for Palestinian security guarantees. That would allow 
the parties to start talks on the extremely difficult final status 
issues including Palestinian statehood, orders, refugees and the future 
of Jerusalem.
