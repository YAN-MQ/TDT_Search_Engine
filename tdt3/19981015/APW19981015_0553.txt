The NATO alliance on Thursday sent Javier Solana, its secretary general, 
and two top commanders to Belgrade to sign an air surveillance deal 
for Kosovo, part of a peace deal for the Serbian province. They were 
to arrive in Belgrade at about 1600GMT. Travelling with Solana will 
be NATO's top military commander in Europe, U.S. Gen. Wesley Clark 
and Klaus Naumann, a German general who heads NATO's panel of chiefs 
of staffs from the 16 alliance nations. Solana was to sign an accord 
in which Yugoslavia gives NATO spy planes unfettered access to Kosovo 
airspace to check compliance with the peace agreement for that province. 
Solana was also to give a press conference in Belgrade Thursday evening. 
Before leaving Solana said Milosevic was not complying with the Kosovo 
peace accord, forged this week by U.S. special envoy Richard Holbrooke. 
The agreement forces Milosevic to withdraw troops from Kosovo, begin 
peace talks with ethnic Albanians and allow 2,000 monitors into the 
province. Officials said Solana would also carry a message to Milosevic 
warning him that unless he lives up to the agreement, NATO will not 
hesitate to use airstrikes.
