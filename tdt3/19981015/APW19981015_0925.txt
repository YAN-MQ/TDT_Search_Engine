The United Nations honored Pope John Paul II for his work to end hunger 
and malnutrition around the world Thursday, the eve of World Food 
Day. The U.N. Food and Agricultural Organization awarded the ``Agricola'' 
medal to the pontiff for his ``continuous struggle against hunger 
and malnutrition and his demonstrated concern for the plight of mankind's 
poor and for peace in the world.'' FAO chief Jacques Diouf presented 
the medal, which bears the words ``Daily Bread _ Condition of World 
Peace,'' at the Vatican on Thursday. World Food Day marks the 53rd 
anniversary of the founding of the Food and Agriculture Organization. 
Also marking the anniversary was the World Food Program, which noted 
that it provided emergency supplies to 53 million people in 1997, 
8 million more than the year before, said WFP spokeswoman Abby Spring. 
``This year's crises are an indication that people can be thrown into 
a hunger trap in a moment's notice,'' WFP chief Catherine Bertini 
said in a statement. Floods and droughts caused by the El Nino weather 
phenomenon, wars in Africa and Kosovo and the economic crisis in Southeast 
Asia were responsible for the increased need. The WFP is feeding 19 
million flood victims in Bangladesh _ the largest emergency operation 
in its history. The agency is helping more than 5 million people in 
Indonesia who are suffering from drought and economic collapse. In 
Rome, Diouf stressed that long-term food security will depend on better 
access for women to productive resources. Women play a key role raising 
crops and livestock in many developing countries, yet they often are 
denied schooling and adequate food within their own families. ``Most 
of the their back-breaking work is unpaid, or grossly underpaid,'' 
Diouf said.
