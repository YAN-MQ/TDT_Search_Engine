In Geneva, 36 women from rural areas around the world are being honored 
at a ceremony at the United Nations in recognition of projects, which 
have improved the lives of their communities. Lisa Shrine reports 
from Geneva. The prize carries the cash award of $500. While it is 
not among the world's most lucrative awards, the founder of the Women's 
World Summit Foundation, Ellise Protavond* says $500 can be as much 
as twice the annual income of some people in developing countries. 
The prize is meant to encourage them to continue in their creative 
work, in their programs. Sonya Hartnek* is from South Africa. She 
heads a school which teaches more than 250 desperately poor children 
in the apple farming area of Grabul*. Another winner, Monica Lugmeyer*, 
is a farmer's daughter from Lowa*, Austria. She is a strong advocate 
for women farmers. Ms. Lugmeyer says one of her big projects is to 
help farm women in eastern European countries achieve some of the 
benefits enjoyed by farm women in the West. Lisa Shrine for VOA News, 
Geneva.
