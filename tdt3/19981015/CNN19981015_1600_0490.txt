I'm meteorologist rose stabler in the "CNN weather center" with your 
"Headline News" forecast. We're going to see a good bit of snow today 
in the northern Rockies. Winter storm warnings in effect for the eastern 
Idaho mountains and a winter storm watch in effect for northern Wyoming 
and northeast Utah. Most of these warnings in effect for elevations 
above 5,000 feet. And this is due to an area of low pressure and a 
trough over the northern Rockies, high pressure in the northwest bringing 
pacific moisture into the mix. Windy conditions today through Friday 
in the central and south central U.S. by Friday afternoon, an evening 
scattered showers on the Texas gulf coast while that rain in Maine 
finally slowly exits toward Nova Scotia. The eastern half of the country 
looking great with high pressure over the carolinas and Virginia. 
Today's highs -- cool in the northern Rockies with 40s and cool in 
the northeast with highs in the 40s, otherwise 50s and 60s in the 
north, 70s and 80s in the south. Our extended forecast showing heavy 
rainfall and snow in the northern plains and western Great Lakes with 
thunderstorms extending all the way down into Texas on Saturday. On 
Sunday, the rain lightens up, but we will still see thunderstorms 
over Texas on Sunday. And then on Monday, just scattered thunderstorms 
over the southern plains, Texas and Louisiana. And remember, you can 
get your four-day forecast for 6,100 cities at CNN.com.
