Veterinarians have had their hands full with the first baby elephant 
born at Singapore's zoo. The 6-month-old pachyderm broke a leg and 
had to have risky surgery to put a Splint on it. Then she spent five 
months in intensive care and rehabilitation. But zoo keepers say she's 
getting better and should make a full recovery.
