JERUSALEM (AP) _ U.S. officials are making sure Israeli and Palestinian 
negotiators have their cozy comforts and security as they try to negotiate 
a peace settlement in a secluded compound outside Washington this 
week. At Israel's request, summit organizers have installed bulletproof 
windows in Wye Plantation rooms set aside for the Israeli negotiators, 
the Haaretz daily said. A kosher kitchen was also established. Meanwhile, 
backgammon sets have been obtained for the Palestinians, known to 
be big fans of the game. Flowers and cigars will be provided to both 
sides, though smoking is only allowed outdoors. Israel's delegation 
gets a nice view of the Wye River, while the Palestinians' rooms overlook 
plantation fields.
