NAto ambassadors are scheduled to meet tomorrow to decide if they'll 
extend a hold on air strikes against Serbian forces in Kosovo. NATO 
secretary general Javier salano signed a deal today that allows air 
surveillance over the province. He also sent a Stern warning to Yugoslav 
President Slobodan Milosevic to comply with Tuesday's agreement. The 
deal requires Milosevic to begin peace talks with ethnic Albanians, 
withdraw his troops, and allow 2,000 unarmed members of a verification 
team on the ground. So far, NATO officials say there's evidence of 
some troop withdrawal, but not nearly enough.
