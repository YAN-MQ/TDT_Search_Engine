Second-seeded Patrick Rafter of Australia reached the quarterfinals 
of the dlrs 800,000 CA Trophy tournament, beating Magnus Norman of 
Sweden 6-3, 6-2 Thursday. Rafter, the U.S. Open champion, is ranked

Britain's Greg Rusedski. Rusedski beat local favorite Thomas Muster 
6-4, 6-3. Rafter, who has a 5-1 record against Rusedski, said, ``I 
never played Greg on this surface, and I do not know how I will react 
to his serve. But I am confident there will be a couple of breaks 
here and there.'' ``It's always difficult to play Thomas in Austria,'' 
Rusedski said after beating Muster. ``But I am very pleased that they 
did not let the crowd get into it.'' In other matches, unseeded Todd 
Martin upset fourth-seeded Petr Korda of the Czech Republic 6-3, 7-6 
(7-2); No. 5 Karol Kucera of Slovakia defeated Germany's Tommy Haas
