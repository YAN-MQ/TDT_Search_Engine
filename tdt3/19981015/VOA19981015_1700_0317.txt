Kenyan President, Daniel Arif Moye, has survived a vote of no confidence 
brought by opposition members of parliament. It was the first time 
since Mr. Moye took office 20 years ago that he has had to fend off 
such emotion. The vote Thursday was 137 to 67 with 6 abstentions. 
The motion was tabled by the leader of the opposition for the Kenya 
Party, James Orango* who blames the government for the country's economic 
problems.
