Two weeks from today, John Glenn is scheduled to blast off from cape 
Canaveral on the shuttle "discovery" at the age of 77 to explore, 
among other things, the effects of space on the aging process. Today, 
he held his final briefing. And tonight on "living longer, living 
better," the oldest active astronaut on what he hopes to achieve. 
NBC's Robert Hager. Two weeks before this month's blastoff, and counting. 
36 years after John Glenn became the first American to orbit the earth. 
Glenn, now 77 years old, and his six new crewmates, broke off training 
briefly to take questions from reporters. Will you be able to avoid 
the fatigue factor? yes. It is rigorous and -- but that's what space 
flight is all about, and I've been able -- you know, I may not be 
as flexible as this crowd to my right here. But Glenn says he's up 
to it, and the flight's commander, Curt brown, agrees. At times we're 
trying to stay up with him. That's how it's always been, then and 
now. Pulling on a space suit then, squeezing into a more complex one 
now. Then, climbing into the small "friendship 7" capsule. now -- 
This is the worst part of the whole trip, getting in and out of this 
darn thing. Entering the shuttle mockup. This time, for nine days, 
in orbit, Glenn will be studied for the effects of weightlessness 
on older people. Can that help us better understand theaging process 
for all of us,aging of the heart, the sense of balance. The weakens 
of muscle and bone. Glenn will even swallow pills with tiny transmitters 
inside that will radio back his inner-body temperature. Meantime, 
Glenn hopes his latest adventure will be an inspiration for 65 million 
elderly Americans. It's a new day tomorrow, every day. And if you 
look forward to things and are active and can participate in things, 
why not do it? I've always regretted the fact that too many people 
seem to run their lives by the calendar. God speed, John glean. Roger, 
we are programming you and you are okay. In 1962, Glenn's five-hour, 
three-minute orbit flight made history, earned him a ticker tape welcome 
back to earth. Now, 36 years later, John Glenn is about to make history 
again, not only soaring into space, but also teaching us something 
about the human body for all ages. Robert Hager, NBC news, at the 
Johnson space center in Houston.
