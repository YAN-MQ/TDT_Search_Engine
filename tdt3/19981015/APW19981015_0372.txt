Two passenger jets nearly collided near Heathrow airport last year 
because of a breakdown in communication between air traffic controllers, 
a official inquiry reported Thursday. A Virgin Express Boeing 737 
which had aborted a landing to make a second pass came within 200 
feet (60 m) vertically and 1,000 feet (300 m) horizontally of a British 
Airways Boeing 757 which was taking off, said the report by Air Accidents 
Investigation Branch. The incident on Aug. 28, 1997 was on a cloudy 
day, shortly after the Virgin jet initiated a missed approach or a 
``go-around'' _ a procedure carried out when a pilot or controller 
is not satisfied with the aircraft's approach. Both the air departures 
controller and the training supervisor failed to tell the air arrivals 
controller the British Airways jet was airborne, and the latter did 
not get agreement from air departures before advising the Virgin Express 
of which path to take. The report said Heathrow's instructions relating 
to missed approaches were not sufficiently clear, and should be revised. 
Those changes have already been made, the Civil Aviation Authority 
said.
