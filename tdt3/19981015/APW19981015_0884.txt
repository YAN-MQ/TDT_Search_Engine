One-half million high school students demanding better conditions 
in the classroom protested around France on Thursday. Despite violence 
that left at least two people seriously injured, the students called 
for new marches next week. From Marseille, in the south, to Metz, 
in the east, and Lille, in the north, students seeking more teachers 
and equipment and less course work pressed their demands in demonstrations 
for the third time this week. But brawlers, some reportedly swinging 
baseball bats, cast a cloud over the growing movement that organized 
protest marches in nearly 350 cities. Street violence left shops, 
cars and public property badly damaged in Paris and several other 
cities. In Nimes, in the southwest, masked youths smashed shop windows 
and damaged a technical school. Paris police reported five injuries, 
including two police officers, one reported in serious condition after 
being attacked by hooligans while making an arrest. Some 150 arrests 
were made for violence that left dozens of cars and stores damaged, 
police said. There were about a dozen arrests in Rouen and dozens 
more elsewhere. In Grenoble, a student was seriously injured in the 
head and back when he broke through a crowd barrier and was struck 
by a tram, authorities said. Officials, denouncing the violence, distinguished 
between high school protesters and hooligans. The Education Ministry 
demanded that the Interior Ministry take action ``so that students 
be protected.'' In Paris, hooligans infiltrated the march of some 
30,000 students at its starting point, Place de la Nation, in the 
east. Amid chants of ``two chairs for three students,'' at least 14,000 
high schoolers took to the streets of Grenoble. Another 12,000 protested 
in Toulouse. Some 20,000 students turned out in Bordeaux, in the southwest. 
Small towns, too, had their lot of angry students. Some 2,000 marched 
in the Alpine town of Thonon-les-Bains and another 4,000 in Annecy, 
according to police. Officials put nationwide participation in the 
demonstrations at some 500,000. ``Yes, Yes., 11th graf, 7th Ld (eg)
