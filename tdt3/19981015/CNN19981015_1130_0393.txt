A new study shows people with bulimia could have a genetic chemical 
imbalance in the brain. According to research published in this month's 
issue of the "archives of general psychiatry," that imbalance of serotonin 
makes a person more prone to eating disorders. Scientists still aren't 
positive whether the altered serotonin is genetic or the result of 
binging and purging patterns. Researchers say the information, if 
proven, could be used to identify people at risk for the eating disorder.
