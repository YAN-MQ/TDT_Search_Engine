Bulgaria's president asked parliament on Thursday to review a new 
law reforming the country's judiciary, saying it gives too much power 
to the government legal officials. President Petar Stoyanov said parliament 
should review those parts of the new law which allow the minister 
of justice to discipline or punish members of the judiciary. Under 
current legislation all legal officials _ judges, prosecutors and 
investigators _ are appointed, dismissed or moved in rank by the 25-member 
Higher Judicial Council, which is elected partly by parliament and 
by a representative panel of the legal profession. Stoyanov also opposed 
a provision that entitles the minister of justice to approve the judiciary's 
budget. Now this is a prerogative of the council. The new law was 
adopted in parliament but requires the president's signature to get 
enacted. Stoyanov said investigators who handle pre-court criminal 
probes should remain independent from courts to which the law attaches 
them. Bulgaria's legal system has drawn mounting criticism for being 
slow, bureaucratic and byond public control. Politicians and media 
have repeatedly alleged corruption among legal officials as crime 
mushroomed. Only a small number of criminal cases reach the courts 
and end with a verdict. Stoyanov's move only suspends enactment, but 
parliament does not have to comply with the president's demands.
