Anyone who can get past the title pun and the opening shot of misogyny 
in ``The Souler Opposite'' is liable to like Bill Kalmenson's almost 
film in spite of itself. Its hero, like Kalmenson, is a stand-up comic, 
and his mean-spirited wisecracks earn him a well-deserved sock in 
the nose early in the story. The rest of the film is about his struggle 
to get involved in a real romance and be less of a jerk. Once the 
sardonic character of Barry Singer (Chrisopher Meloni) worms his way 
into your affections, you may just wish him success. The same goes 
for Kalmenson, who is nothing if not enterprising. He has based this 
story on his own experiences (including trouble with a girlfriend 
who worked in Jerry Brown's 1992 presidential campaign) and directed 
it with reasonably Woody Allenish aplomb. It is being distributed 
by Buffalo Jump Productions, a company of which he happens to be president 
and founder. And he showed up last January in Park City, Utah, home 
of the Sundance, Slamdance and other offshoot film festivals, claiming 
that his film was an entry in an event called Souldance. The only 
entry, as a matter of fact. Fortunately, he has also made a film that 
deserves to see the light of day. Though its plotting creaks, the 
principal characters are engaging: Barry himself, who is his own worst 
enemy, and Robert Levin (Timothy Busfield), his romance coach and 
best friend. In a film that's as much about anger as humor, both these 
guys remain flabbergasted that women resist them. Janel Moloney blithely 
plays Thea Douglas, an earnest person who has so little in common 
with Barry that she naturally sends him head over heels. All he wants 
from a woman, Barry maintains in his nightclub act, is somebody who'll 
like him for who he pretends to be. With shades of ``Seinfeld,'' ``The 
Souler Opposite'' also illustrates the ego wars of the stand-up comedy 
game. All he needs to get a nightclub job, Barry is told, is to kill 
about 40 guys competing for the same spot. ``The Souler Opposite'' 
is rated R. It includes profanity and sexual situations. PRODUCTION
