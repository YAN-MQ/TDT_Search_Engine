Well, baseball fans are looking forward to that game on Saturday night 
between the Yankees and Padres and Thursday thousands of enthusiastic 
Yankee fans held a rally in New York City Hall Park. VOA's Martin 
Bush was there and has this report. When not feasting on three hot 
dogs, strawberry kick, peanuts and soda, New York Yankee fans were 
cheering their team at a noontime rally. Especially when ace pitcher, 
David Cohen, told them exactly what they wanted to hear. To all the 
Yankee fans out there, New York is the baseball capital of the world. 
You all deserve the World Series. We brought it to you, now let's 
go get it. Thank you. New York's mayor, Rudolph Juliano, who considers 
himself the city's number one Yankee fan, got a little ahead of himself 
in his remarks. We are all going to be back here for a great celebration 
when the Yankees win the World Series. Right? The first two games 
of best of seven World Series are at Yankee Stadium, the next three 
in San Diego. Martin Bush, VOA News, New York.
