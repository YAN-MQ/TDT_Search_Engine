Meanwhile the prosecutor of the International War Crimes Tribunal 
for the former Yugoslavia rejects claims Yugoslav President Slobodan 
Milosevic any say over the courts jurisdiction. Max Rustin reports 
from the United Nations. Prosecutor Louise Arbour was responding to 
reports that Yugoslav President Slobodan Milosevic is refusing to 
recognize the International Criminal Courts jurisdiction over Yugoslavia. 
Those reports follow growing calls at the United Nations for the Court 
of the ICTY to investigate the latest atrocities in the Yugoslav province 
of Kosovo, where Yugoslav forces have been fighting ethnic Albanians. 
I would like to first point out that the jurisdiction of ICTY is not 
for Mr. Milosevic to decide, nor is it subject to negotiation between 
him and anybody else. Uh.. The jurisdiction of the Tribunal is set 
out in unambiguous terms in the, uh, statute of the Tribunal created 
by a resolution of the Security Council and the interpretation of 
the scope of that jurisdiction is for the judges of the Tribunal to 
determine. UN Security Council members have suggested that Mr. Milosevic 
himself could be held responsible for some of the killings in Kosovo, 
if it is shown that he failed to take any measures to prevent the 
violence. Ms. Arbor has said she is not discussed the possibility 
of pursuing an indictment against Mr. Milosevic. But she said crimes 
committed by both sides, in the Kosovo conflict, are being monitored 
on a regular and continuing basis by her office. Reports from Yugoslavia 
indicate that despite his refusal to recognize the courts jurisdiction, 
Mr. Milosevichas agreed to allow its personnel into the country to 
pursue investigations. Max Rustin, VOA News, United Nations.
