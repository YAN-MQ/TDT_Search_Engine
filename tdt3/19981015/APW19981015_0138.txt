After years of denial, Germany is taking a big step toward accepting 
immigrants and their children by knocking down barriers in the nation's 
85-year-old citizenship law. The decision by the future government 
is the first major policy shift resulting from the left's election 
victory last month and an important gesture to Germany's 7 million 
foreign residents, who make up nearly 10 percent of the population. 
``This government will recognize that Germany is a country of immigrants,'' 
said Kerstin Mueller, a domestic policy for the Greens party, the 
junior partner in the incoming government coalition. The language 
took aim at outgoing Chancellor Helmut Kohl's government, which insisted 
that Germany is not an immigration land. Germany's 2 million Turks 
have fought especially hard for the changes. Most Turkish children 
born here have grown up virtually as Germans, but they still feel 
excluded from an increasingly multicultural society by the 1913 citizenship 
law, which grants automatic citizenship only on the basis of German 
blood. More than half of the 82,913 foreigners who made it through 
the arduous process and received German citizenship last year were 
from Turkey, the federal statistics office reported Thursday.
