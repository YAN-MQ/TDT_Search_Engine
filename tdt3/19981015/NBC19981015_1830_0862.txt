NBC news "in depth" tonight -- bringing discipline and safety to America's 
classrooms. It is an issue that was front and center today at the 
White House where a conference was held on school violence and what 
to do about it. One possible answer, school uniforms. Last year, parents 
spent more than $11 billion outfitting their kids for school. $550 
million was spent on uniforms. That figure is expected to double for 
this school year. Why does a simple change of clothing make such a 
difference? NBC's Kelly O'Donnell begins our "in depth" reporting. 
a remarkable new report card at schools in long beach, California. 
Overall crime here dropped a stunning 91% in four years, assault, 
robbery, guns, almost nonexistent now. What changed? Students wear 
uniforms, the mandatory dress code gets much of the credit. Fights 
are not a problem for us. Weapons not a problem for us. Linda Moore 
is the principal at will Rogers middle school, and she too wears the 
mandatory red, black and white each day. The effect, she says, a change 
in students' attitudes. What isn't here are kids getting suspended 
for fighting, kids being absent because they don't have anything to 
wear. Tierney Kaufman and Shannon Wilson are 8th graders. It makes 
you feel no competitions. You're closer to one another because you 
know you don't have to worry about what you look like. And you guys 
are all basically wearing the same thing. Good news in California, 
but last year tragedy captured national attention. Bloodshed at Jonesboro, 
Paducah, Springfield, where 16 died violently at the hands of students. 
Today in Washington, a White House conference on school violence. 
The majority of our schools are safe kids learning in peace and security. 
But in too many schools, children felt unsafe. a new department of 
education report shows despite high-profile cases, a profound drop 
in school violence. 0% schools of nationwide report no serious violent 
crime last year. At 43% of schools, no crime of any kind was reported. 
But beyond those encouraging figures, some danger signs. A new national 
poll form Harvard found that one third of middle and high school students 
questioned admit when angry, they can't control themselves. More than 
40% say when challenged, they will fight. One researcher describes 
those kids as "volcanos waiting to erupt." Another person who knows, 
Maria, a child advocate in Oakland. Children feel afraid. Children 
feel isolated. Children feel they have to solve problems themselves 
and that they need to protect themselves. Back at long beach no such 
crisis. The lowest absenteeism in years. All of the other rules seem 
easier to follow when they know they with manage the dress code.
