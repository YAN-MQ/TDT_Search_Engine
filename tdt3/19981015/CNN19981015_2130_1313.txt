The Yankees worked out in preparation for Saturday's game of the world 
series against San Diego. The Bronx bombers will start David Wells. 
The padres send ace Kevin brown to the hill. After what San Diego 
did to Atlanta and Houston, they've earned some respect from the New 
Yorkers. I think they are a lot like us. They have great starting 
pitching. They have a strong bullpen and play as a team. They do the 
little things right. And they play hard.
