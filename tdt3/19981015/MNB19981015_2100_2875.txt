We'll show you what happened when we took our hidden cameras into 
the back rooms of the stolen ticket business. And we'll show you part 
two of Chris Hansen's special hidden camera report for "dateline NBC" 
on this very broadcast tomorrow evening. When we come back here this 
Thursday night, a beloved personality on daytime telesion talks how 
long she'll take put. Five cents. Five cents. Five cents. AT&T 5 cent 
weekends. Now calls from home all weekend long are just 5 cents a 
minute. No, because Tuesday is not a weekend. You see, Saturday and 
Sunday are generally considered the weekend. AT&T 5 cent weekends. 
Yeah, call your friends call your relatives, call everybody you know! 
To get 5 cent weekends, call now to enroll. No, Monday is what? It's 
a weekday. That's right. That's right.
