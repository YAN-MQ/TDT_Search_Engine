A U.N. team will leave Friday for Kosovo to report on the conflict 
between Serbs and ethnic Albanians, fulfilling a request by the Security 
Council for first-hand information from the secessionist Serb province. 
The mission, expected to take up to 10 days, was planned prior to 
marathon talks between U.S. envoy Richard Holbrooke and Yugoslav President 
Slobodan Milosevic that resulted in an agreement to send a 2,000-member 
verification team to Kosovo, U.N. spokesman Fred Eckhard said Thursday. 
Since a Serb crackdown on ethnic Albanians began in February, the 
United Nations has relied on other organizations for information on 
the conflict. Only U.N. humanitarian workers are in Kosovo. The Security 
Council asked Annan to consider ways to get first-hand information 
from the province after receiving reports from other organizations 
that Serbs hadn't complied with U.N. resolutions demanding an end 
to the offensive. The mission, which includes about eight people from 
U.N. peacekeeping, political, refugee and humanitarian departments, 
aims to help Secretary-General Kofi Annan make a better assessment 
of progress toward a negotiated settlement between the two sides, 
Eckhard said. Team members will also be assessing the feasibility 
of a possible future U.N. role in the province, U.N. officials said. 
``When the Security Council first asked the Secretary-General to report 
on events in Kosovo, he said that 'I have no eyes and ears there,''' 
Eckhard noted. The U.N. mission will be led by Staffan De Mistura, 
director of the U.N. Information Center in Rome. De Mistura, a Swede, 
worked last year as the world body's humanitarian coordinator for 
Iraq. Team members are expected to meet in Europe on Saturday. Milosevic 
agreed Monday to withdraw his forces from Kosovo, begin peace negotiations 
with separatist ethnic Albanians and allow the 2,000-member team into 
Kosovo to verify Serb compliance with U.N. demands. The Serb crackdown, 
launched Feb. 28, was aimed at crushing the Kosovo Liberation Army, 
fighting for independence of the majority Albanian province. Hundreds 
have been killed in Kosovo and hundreds of thousands more have been 
forced from their homes during the operation.
