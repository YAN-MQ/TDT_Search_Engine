In the National Football League the San Diego Chargers team has fired 
Head Coach Kevin Gilbride and replaced him with former Atlanta Coach 
June Jones. The 47 year old Gilbride had a record of 6 wins and 16 
loses, and was 2 and 4 this season. General Manager Bobby Bethard 
says a change had to be made. It's a very awkward difficult decision 
to make, but it's one that, uh, after meeting about it several times, 
we felt this the - the direction in which we have to go. Um, the timing 
of it is not what you, not ideal, not what you like. The Chargers 
rank 28th in the League in passing and second to last in the American 
Conference in total offense. They have not scored more than one touchdown 
in nine consecutive games.
