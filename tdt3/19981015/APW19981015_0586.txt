India has managed to avoid the worst ailments of other Asian economies, 
but needs to control its deficit and shed unprofitable industries 
to stay healthy, the prime minister said Thursday. Prime Minister 
Atal Bihari Vajpayee called on his top economic advisors to formulate 
a program to raise tax revenue, trim spending and make the financial 
sector ``more resilient to shocks.'' The economy is expected to grow 
by 6.3 percent this fiscal year ending March 31, up from 5.1 percent 
last year _ a rate no other Asian country will achieve while keeping 
inflation in check, Vajpayee said. But the fiscal deficit is ``unacceptably 
high,'' Vajpayee said. This year's deficit is forecast at 6.1 percent 
of gross domestic, against a target of 5.6 percent for next year. 
He was speaking to the Economic Advisory Council, a newly formed body 
of businessmen and policy makers mandated to recommend policy and 
ways to carry it out. As have all governments elected this decade, 
Vajpayee called for a restructuring of publicly owned industries. 
``The losses of these enterprises is a fiscal drain and we cannot 
afford this,'' he said in a prepared speech. Previous administrations 
were stymied in their efforts to disinvest in companies, many of which 
have strong unions and provide employment in undeveloped areas. Vajpayee 
gave no indication how his 6-month-old government would fare any better. 
He boasted that while Asian currencies have undergone turmoil, India's 
foreign exchange markets were kept ``relatively orderly.'' The rupee 
dropped sharply when India was hit by economic sanctions for exploding 
a nuclear device in May, but now has recovered slightly to stand 16 
percent lower than at the beginning of the year. The prime minister 
restated his government's goals: a growth rate of 7-8 percent over 
the next three years and an increase in industrial growth by up to 
13 percent. Exports, which currently are shrinking by nearly 3 percent, 
should rise by up to 15 percent, Vajpayee said.
