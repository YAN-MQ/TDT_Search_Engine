NATO Secretary General Javier Solana says Yugoslavia has yet to comply 
with International demands that it pull its forces out of Kosovo. 
Mr. Solana told reporters in Brussels he will probably go to Belgrade 
later today or Friday to sign the court on verification on the settlement 
President Slobodan Milosevic reached with US envoy Richard Holbrooke 
to avoid NATO air strikes. Meanwhile the six nation contact group, 
on the Balkans, is meeting in Paris to plan efforts to monitor Yugoslavia's 
compliance with the agreement.
