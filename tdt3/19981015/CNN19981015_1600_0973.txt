Surprise announcement on interest rates from the fed. That sent stocks 
soaring. Let's get the details fromkyty. It cut the federal funds 
rate the rate banks charge each other for overnight loans and cut 
the discount rate, the rate the fed charges banks to borrow money 
by a quarter point as well. Banks will most likely follow suit and 
cut the rates that they charge their customers. Making it cheaper 
to borrow money, carry a balance on a credit card, and finance a new 
home. The fed lowers its funds rates just last month but this is the 
first time the fed has cut the discount rate in nearly three years. 
Unlike most rate changes that occur after the meetings, this took 
place with no meeting, the first time that has happened since April 
of 1994. Now, the fed said the cut was necessary to sustain economic 
growth and stimulate lending here in the United States. The news from 
the fed turned a modest stock rally into a very big one. Stocks gained 
168 points within ten minutes. Investors were hoping for further economic 
growth and better results from corporate America. The broader markets 
were also higher, with the NASDAQ composite rising -- the bond market 
also took off on word of the rate cut. The 30-year treasury up 17/32 
and that puts the yield at 4.95%.
