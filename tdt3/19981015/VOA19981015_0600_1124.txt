The San Diego Padres have returned to baseballs' World Series for 
the first time in 14 years, after defeating the Atlanta Braves 5 to 
nothing in the National League Championship Series. The Padres broke 
a scoreless tie, in Atlanta, by getting all of their runs in the sixth 
inning. Atlanta pitcher Tom Glavin gave up a string of base hits, 
which turned into 5 runs. San Diego's Sterling Hitchcock, meanwhile 
limited the powerful Atlanta bats to a mere 2 hits. Padre's Manager 
Bruce Broce says he is very proud of his team. I can't say enough 
about the heart and determination this club played with. I mean, to 
go against two great ball clubs like Houston and Atlanta. It doesn't 
get any better than this. The Padre's win the Series 4 games to 2 
ending the Braves attempt to become the first team in history to overcome 
a 3-0 deficit in the playoffs. Atlanta Manager Bobby Cox says he thinks 
San Diego will play very well against the New York Yankees in the 
World Series. I think the Padres have a real good chance of beating 
them. They've got great pitching, and they got some hitters, that 
even, even kind of like ours haven't started to hit yet, but they 
scored enough. And, uh, I like San Diego's' chances you bet.
