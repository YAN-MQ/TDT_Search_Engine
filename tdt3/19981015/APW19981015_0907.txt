American Venus Williams began play after a four-day waiting period 
with a lackluster win over compatriot Corina Morariu on Thursday at 
the dlrs 1 million European Championships. A qualifier last year, 
Williams arrived as second seed at the European tournament _ which 
officially changed names to Swisscom Challenge on Thursday _ and consequently 
received a bye into the second round. The powerfully-built 18-year-old, 
who also played a doubles match later the same evening, took an hour 
and a half to defeat Morariu 7-5, 6-3. ``There's always the possibility 
it can hurt your game and you become ``off'' if you start late in 
the tournament,'' said Williams, who won her third career title two 
weeks ago at the Grand Slam Cup in Munich. ``I never had to start 
this late before but I worked hard and got some practice in, and I 
think I played well.'' Morariu played three qualifying matches to 
reach the main draw, before posting a first round win over France's 
Sandrine Testud, who defeated Lindsay Davenport in the final in Filderstadt 
last week. The lanky American broke in the third game to go up 2-1, 
but a gritty Morariu broke back immediately to regain her serve. Williams 
had another break opportunity at 3-3, but squandered five break points, 
permitting Morariu to remain on serve. At 4-4 Williams again blew 
a chance to take the lead, pushing Morariu to deuce eight times but 
wasting four break points. Morariu continued to labor on her service 
game, again going to deuce four times before allowing Williams to 
break and jump to a 6-5 lead. The second set began similarly with 
the two players trading serves before Williams broke twice more to 
lock up the match. ``I have to get better when it comes to capitalizing 
on my opportunities,'' said Williams, who reached the quarterfinals 
as a qualifier last year before falling to eventual champion Davenport. 
``I also made a lot of unforced errors which I need to improve on.'' 
The world number five will meet seventh-seed Mary Pierce in the quarterfinals. 
For Swiss spectators, interest in the round of eight was dimmed when 
Barbara Schett toppled home favorite Patty Schnyder, seeded fifth. 
In a tense, nail-biting encounter, the Austrian bested her long-time 
doubles partner 6-4, 1-6, 7-6 (7-4), eliminating the only Swiss of 
the tournament. Schett got off to a strong start in the first set, 
but lost her concentration in the second, allowing Schnyder to re-ignite 
the crowd's hopes. But in a tight third set, it was the Austrian who 
displayed the greater nerve, prevailing in a total of 93 minutes. 
Swiss star Martina Hingis, who was knocked out in the quarterfinals 
last year, withdrew shortly before the start of the tournament due 
to a strained ankle. Fourth-seed Nathalie Tauziat, who like William's 
saw her first action of the week, showed no signs of rust in her 6-2, 
6-3 defeat over American Lisa Raymond. ``I was a bit angry when I 
saw the schedule and I wasn't playing until Thursday,'' said Tauziat, 
a finalist here last year. ``You see everyone play, you see everyone 
win and defend their points and it's very frustrating.'' Eighth-seed 
Dominique Van Roost had no difficulty getting past Amelie Mauresmo 
to reach the round of eight, defeating the French player 6-3, 6-4. 
Van Roost, who brought to and end Hingis's reign atop the world rankings 
when she defeated the Swiss star in the quarterfinals at Filderstadt 
last week, will take on Irina Spirlea in the round of eight. New world 
No. 1 Davenport will play sixth-seed Amanda Coetzer for a berth in 
the semifinals.
