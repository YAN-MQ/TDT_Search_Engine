The pulsating North African rhythm known as Rye has been a musical 
force in France for the past five years, popular among both French 
natives and immigrants from Algeria and Morocco. For today's closing 
music, The World's Marco Werman introduces us to the newest practitioner 
of this Arab rock. Imagine if America's latest rock hero had the voice 
of Bruce Springsteen but he played a Casio electronic keyboard. Chances 
are he'd get no further than the lounge at the local Holiday Inn. 
But despite his virtual horn and string section, 26 year old Shabaiesa 
has gone a lot further than the local lounge. Now residing in Marseilles, 
he's part of a wave of Rye singers, more at home in France than Algeria, 
creating music that would be considered taboo back home. Shabaiesa's 
latest single, Chera France, is about a young Algerian immigrant woman 
who has adopted all of the cultural habits of the French, air kisses 
included. Shabaiesa sings that the girl's life is still better than 
if she had been set up in an arranged marriage in Algeria. The song 
is a hit with the French and Algerian Rye fans in France and that's 
a sweet arrangement for Shabaiesa. For The World, this is Marco Werman. 
Music from up and coming French Algerian Rye singer Shabaiesa, ending 
this edition of the program. We're online at www.theworld.org, 24 
hours a day, a Yahoo pick of the week. In Boston, I'm Tony Kahn.
