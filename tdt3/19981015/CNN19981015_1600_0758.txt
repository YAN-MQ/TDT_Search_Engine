If you could accompany your data on its trip overseas the experience 
would be alarming. Local carriers handing it to national carriers 
over to cable carriers... till you don't know who has your data. Unless 
you send it through here. With the one and only company that owns 
the entire network-- local, national, and international. So you know 
who has your data. On-net. From MCI Worldcom. Nobody loves cars more 
than I do. Each one is a work of art. So when a maker of all these 
chose a new antifreeze, it got my attention. General Motors now uses 
the dex-cool technology of havoline extended life antifreeze in virtually 
all its new vehicles. The same patented formula ..you can use in your 
car. For 5 years or 150,000 miles. So do what GM did, switch to havoline. 
I use it in my car. I only wish this were it.
