The Contact Group of nations concerned with Yugoslavia gave its full 
support Thursday to an agreement hammered out with Belgrade on ending 
the crisis in Kosovo province. The group of U.S., European and Russian 
officials also maintained its support for the threat of NATO airstrikes 
in case Yugoslav President Slobodan Milosevic doesn't keep his word, 
said French Foreign Minister Hubert Vedrine. But there remained Russian 
resistance to a new U.N. resolution specifically authorizing airstrikes 
against their historic ally, Germany's foreign minister said. The 
agreement reached Monday between Milosevic and U.S. envoy Richard 
Holbrooke ``has the full support of the Contact Group,'' Vedrine told 
a news conference after the meeting. NATO has threatened air strikes 
on Milosevic's Serb army positions unless they pull out of Kosovo 
province, where ethnic Albanian rebels are fighting for independence 
from Serb-dominated Yugoslavia. Milosevic has been given until Saturday 
to begin complying. In the accord, Milosevic has also agreed to peace 
talks, a verification group, cooperation with war crimes investigators, 
the unhindered humanitarian shipments and the return of refugees to 
their homes. Hundreds of thousands of refugees in heavily Albanian 
Kosovo face a deadly winter if the conflict doesn't end soon. When 
asked if the air strike threat remained strong, Vedrine said the Contact 
Group ``is the same state of mind, but we observe that things have 
begun to move and we remain extremely vigilant.'' The group discussed 
coordination between NATO air surveillance and the 2,000-member verification 
group, Vedrine said. They also agreed on the need for a new U.N. Security 
Council resolution ``to endorse the accord,'' and that discussions 
``must begin immediately,'' he said. British and Russian proposals 
were on the table, Vedrine said, without elaborating. German Foreign 
Minister Klaus Kinkel told a news briefing the Russians opposed a 
U.N. resolution backing airstrikes, but Russia's Foreign Minister 
Igor Ivanov sought to finesse any disagreement. ``We are satisfied 
that our partners have come to support our point of view,'' he told 
another separate news briefing. ``Our position is that the essence 
of the resolutions of the Security Council must be fulfilled by the 
authorities of Yugoslavia and the representatives of the Kosovar Albanians. 
The solution can only be political. ``Any efforts to force the issue 
by military means will only have negative consequences,'' he said. 
Ivanov left open the possibility Russia would join in NATO-led overflights 
to verify Serb compliance, once the Atlantic alliance and Yugoslavia 
agree on the plan. Meanwhile, several nations were offering to participate 
in the verification mission. Germany on Thursday offered up to 200 
monitors, Britain 200 people, France an undetermined number, and Russia 
was expected to provide monitors. Hundreds of people have been killed 
and an estimated 300,000 displaced from their homes by Milosevic's 
seven-month-old crackdown against the separatists in the southern 
Serbian province.
