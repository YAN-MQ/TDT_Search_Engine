New procedures for carry-on baggage could mean longer airport delays 
for business travelers. Stephanie Oswald explains in this "working 
ahead." Some say the flying public needs a packing lesson. You get 
some people trying to carry on a suitcase with everything but the 
kitchen sink. Business travelers often bring all their luggage on 
board in order to avoid baggage claim and save time on the ground. 
But when united airlines begins installing new stainless steel frames 
at security checkpoints next month, the goal will be to stop bulky 
bags in their path. It's the latest in a long line of airline efforts 
designed to beat the carry-on crunch. Most business travelers probably 
are aware of what the policies are and they'll deal with it, you know? 
If we have to have a little smaller bag, we'll just maybe we just 
carry one less shirt or something. I can't carry it on? no. But experts 
worry about longer lines at security and a greater fear -- lost luggage. 
Lost luggage claims, since the airlines have cracked down on carry-on 
bags, have gone up. So over the last two or three months, we've seen 
more luggage lost. So I think that the problem is only gonna get worse. 
Continental is trying to find its solution on board -- new planes 
will have larger overhead bins. And the airline is retro-fitting current 
planes to make more room. Stephanie Oswald, CNN, reporting.
