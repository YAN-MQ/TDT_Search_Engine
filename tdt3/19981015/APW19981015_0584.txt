Authorities seized more than 170 kilograms (375 pounds) of high-grade 
drugs in a waterfront raid early Thursday, the largest haul ever in 
Hong Kong, police officials said. Four men aged between 31 and 41 
_ two from Hong Kong and two from mainland China _ were arrested shortly 
after loading several bags and cartons from a river boat into a car, 
they added. More than 160 kilograms (352 pounds) of methamphetamine 
hydrochloride _ or `ice' _ and 14 kilograms (31 pounds) of high-grade 
heroin were found in the trunk of the car in Hong Kong's red-light 
Sham Shui Po district, Superintendent Philip Wong told reporters. 
The drugs had an estimated value of 9.3 million Hong Kong dollars 
(U.S. dlrs 1.2 million), a statement released after the raid said. 
Wong said the ``ice'' was on its way to Southeast Asia, while the 
heroin was for local consumption. Hong Kong authorities have cracked 
down heavily on production and distribution of illicit drugs, forcing 
drug syndicates run by triads _ or Chinese gangs _ to smuggle increasing 
amounts of the finished product from China. The drugs usually are 
hidden on fishing boats that ply the Pearl River Delta between Hong 
Kong and the southern mainland Chinese province of Guangdong.
