Stock prices here in the United States were up on Wednesday as some 
companies reported stronger than expected earnings. VOA's Breck Artery 
reports from New York. The Dow Jones Industrial Average closed at 
7,968, up 30 points. Standard & Poor's 500 Index closed at 1005, up 
10 points. Analysts say that traders were still nervous about the 
International financial situation, and the possibility of an economic 
slow down in the United States. But there was also some optimism as 
a result of some unexpectedly strong corporate earnings reports. John 
Mannley of the Solomon Smith Barney investment firm, believes the 
worst of the US Stock Market shocks are now over. A lot of bad news 
has washed itself into stocks. I don't think it's all in but I think 
on a shorter term basis I feel we should see more solutions to our 
problems than further problems.
