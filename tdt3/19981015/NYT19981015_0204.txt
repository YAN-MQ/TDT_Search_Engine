It's revealing that the set for ``More to Love: A Big Fat Comedy'' 
is a vast, cluttered garage, because the production that unfolds around 
it is a big fat mess. Less than a play, less, even, than a memorable 
club date, ``More to Love'' aspires to some strange hybrid performance 
genre: Call it stand-up dramedy. Written by and starring Rob Bartlett, 
best known for his contributions to Don Imus' radio show, this trite 
piece is only entertaining (and sporadically so at that) when Bartlett 
drops the dramatic charade, parks himself center stage and riffs on 
such comedian-friendly topics as airline travel and fast-food joints. 
For the rest, the most helpful critical judgment that can be offered 
is: avert your eyes. Here are some examples of how dumb this concoction 
is. The appealing Dana Reeve, portraying Bartlett's long-suffering 
wife, with the usual assortment of sitcom gestures (hands placed on 
hips, eyes rolling), is required to strip to a bustier and romance 
her mate with a ``Hey, big spender'' kind of number that makes fun 
of her husband's girth (sample lyric: ``It was so tough/To get enough/Until 
I fell for you''). You want more evidence? The veteran actress Joyce 
Van Patten plays an electric fuse. The idea is that Ms. Van Patten, 
as Bartlett's stereotypically obnoxious agent, Maxine, carries on 
a fantasy dialogue with her client in the garage, a device that requires 
Ms. Van Patten to pop out of storage bins and the like. At one point, 
Bartlett opens the fuse box, and there is poor Ms. Van Patten doing 
the tough-dame routine and wearing an odd little electric-fuse crown. 
Maxine is hanging around Bartlett's garage thanks to the utterly disposable 
premise of ``More to Love,'' which opened last night at the Eugene 
O'Neill Theater. Bartlett, called ``Rob'' here, is in a lamentable 
state. Not only does his wife make endless fat jokes at his expense 
(her name is Alice, like ``The Honeymooners'' character, get it?). 
But Rob also has a problem that any of America's estimated 33.7 million 
working funnymen _ the show's apparent target audience _ can relate 
to. He's on the verge of inking a deal for his first HBO special, 
and well, he just doesn't feel appreciated for the true comic genius 
he is. He's turning 40; younger comics are leaving him in the dust, 
and self-doubt is bearing down on his ego. Meanwhile, Alice strolls 
in from the house, to hand Rob a cup of coffee or something (good 
girl!) or to lecture him halfheartedly for not cleaning the garage, 
designed, by the way, by no less a scenic magician than David Gallo. 
(The director, to his discredit, is Jack O'Brien.) Between Ms. Reeve's 
long, cross-stage treks, Bartlett segues into a canned stand-up act. 
Some of the standard-issue material is not bad, especially Bartlett's 
impressions of a flight attendant's safety precaution mime show and 
of a Jordanian contestant on an Arabic ``Wheel of Fortune.'' Which 
begs the question: Who talked Bartlett into this dopey dog-and-pony 
show? At the end of the production, Rob learns that the HBO deal has 
fallen through; there's a chance instead of going to Broadway. ``More 
to Love'' certainly makes that seem like the booby prize. PRODUCTION
