Although many Americans are upset with the recent drop in the value 
of their stock portfolios, collectors of Beanie Babies have nothing 
to worry about, at least for the moment. The prices of the limited 
edition bean bag dolls have appreciated as much as 1,000 percent, 
or more in just the past two years. Serious investment advisors caution 
a sudden and severe crash in Beanie Baby value is always possible, 
they say speculation in the dolls should be considered, very high 
risk. Breck Artery, VOA News, New York.
