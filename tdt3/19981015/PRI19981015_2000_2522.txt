Get ready for today's geography quiz. We're taking you to a place 
where few non-Muslims have never gone before. We're off to a kingdom 
in the Middle East that was formed by royal decree in 1932. To call 
this land dry is an understatement. In fact, 95 percent of the country 
is desert and there are places that can go years without even seeing 
a drop of rain. But, lurking underneath this arid ground is one-fourth 
of the world's total petroleum reserves, not to mention four percent 
of the world's total gas reserves. This country is also considered 
the historical home of Islam with scores of Muslim pilgrims coming 
here during their annual pilgrimage to Mecca, known as the Haj. So, 
where is this historic land that so few Western visitors have seen? 
The answer is up ahead.
