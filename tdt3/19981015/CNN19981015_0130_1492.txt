Australian authorities staged a dramatic raid on a ship off the east 
coast Wednesday and came up with their largest seizure ever of heroin. 
They arrested 18 people and picked up 900 pounds of high-grade heroin, 
enough for 20 million doses. To put that in perspective, there are 
only 17 million people in the whole country. The drugs are worth an 
estimated $250 million.
