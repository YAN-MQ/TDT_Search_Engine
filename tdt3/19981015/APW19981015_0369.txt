French high school students were staging a day of protests throughout 
France on Thursday, keeping up the pressure on the leftist government 
to cut class sizes and buy more equipment. By midday, an estimated 
150,000 students were in the streets. In Bordeaux in the southwest, 
20,000 students were marching. In Rennes in the north, 10,000 were 
out in force, and a similar number rallied in Caen in Normandy. At 
least 25,000 students were expected to march in Paris, staring in 
the early afternoon. Already there were witness reports of vandalism 
at a subway station in eastern Paris. In Grenoble, a protesting student 
was seriously injured hit by a tramway after jumping over security 
barriers. And in Rouen, about a dozen students were arrested for breaking 
store windows and rampaging through an outdoor cafe. A student union 
leader, meanwhile, predicted protests at least until a school vacation 
at the end of next week, unless Education Minister Claude Allegre 
quickly carries out his promises to improve school conditions. ``We'll 
see what is won or not,'' said Thibault Cotta, secretary-general of 
the Independent and Democratic Federation of High School Students, 
calling for ``concrete action'' from Allegre. He told France Inter 
radio that without progress this week, his federation would march 
on the National Assembly on Tuesday, the day before a budget vote. 
He denounced violence during marches earlier this week but said that 
in student marches ``things get broken. It's normal. ... We'll try 
to keep it from happening again today.'' Authorities were advising 
merchants to shutter their shops and motorists not to park their cars 
along march routes. Allegre on Wednesday insisted the government had 
heard the students. ``I think it is logical for the young, when there 
are needs, when there aren't enough teachers, when classrooms are 
overcrowded, to demand good working conditions,'' the minister said 
at the close of the weekly Cabinet meeting. ``I'm doing what I can 
to give this to them,'' he said. At the meeting, Allegre presented 
his plan to spread teachers out more equitably around the country, 
a decree that bypasses the parliamentary process. He also promised 
that a plan to lighten the course load for high school students would 
be presented next month. Socialist Prime Minister Lionel Jospin, himself 
a former education minister, hailed the plan, saying it would bring 
about ``very rapid improvements.'' Teachers were rooting for their 
protesting students. One of the largest teacher's unions has called 
for its members to show solidarity with their protesting students.
