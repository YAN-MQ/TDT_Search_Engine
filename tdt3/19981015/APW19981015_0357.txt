Russia's tax officers will review the tax returns of alcohol producers 
and revoke licenses of those that fail to settle their tax debts, 
the Federal Tax Service said Thursday. The crisis-stricken Russian 
government established a state monopoly on alcohol sales and distribution 
last month in hopes of boosting its tax collections. Producers will 
have to settle their back taxes no later than a month after tax officials 
review their accounts, the Federal Tax Service statement said. In 
Soviet times, alcohol taxes amounted to about 25 percent of the federal 
budget, but the figure has since fallen to about two percent to four 
percent, officials say. About half the alcohol consumed in Russia 
_ mostly vodka _ goes untaxed, according to government estimates. 
Also Thursday, a Moscow official said the city would enforce a ban 
on alcohol at produce and wholesale markets starting Nov. 16, the 
ITAR-Tass news agency said. The city will set up a new network of 
100 wholesale and retail alcohol distributors, said Vladimir Malyshkov, 
head of the city's consumer services department. Mayor Yuri Luzhkov 
announced the ban on Saturday because he said the federal government 
was losing out on liquor taxes that were going uncollected at Moscow 
markets.
