Researchers studying the seas off the coast of Alaska have discovered 
that killer whales have changed their eating habits as a direct result 
of human induced ecological change. The researchers say killer whales 
are turning their attention to the world's smallest sea mammal, the 
sea otter, which they previously tended to ignore. The researchers 
say the effect on sea otters is devastating. One killer whale can 
eat nearly 2,000 of them in a year.
