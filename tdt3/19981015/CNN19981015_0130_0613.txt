When it comes to fund-raising, the first lady may be the democratic 
party's preferred "Clinton." John king has the story. The first lady 
is hitting the road, and the airwaves, in a final campaign push for 
democrats. CNN has learned Mrs. Clinton is taping several radio spots 
for the party's get out the vote effort, as democrats try to tap her 
appeal among women, blacks and Hispanics. Illinois was my home, and 
will always hold a special place in my heart. This 30-second TV pitch 
for embattled democratic senator Carol Mosely Braun debuts Saturday. 
She's fought to outlaw concealed weapons. And she'll be the strongest 
voice against turning Medicare into an HMO. I hope you'll support 
senator Moseley Braun. The president is a controversial figure this 
fall because of the Monica Lewinsky scandal. But the first lady is 
in demand, eager to prove her husband isn't a political liability. 
She really does want to motivate people and make sure that there aren't 
victims, any further victims, of this tragedy we've all lived through. 
Mrs. Clinton leaves Friday for weekend campaigning in New Mexico, 
Nevada, Wisconsin and Illinois. New York, Massachusetts and Rhode 
Island are on tap next week, as well as return visits to the midwest 
for races high on the democratic party's target list. She's the number-one 
democratic campaigner right now. She is extremely popular with the 
base. The latest CNN/"USA today" Gallup poll shows republicans don't 
think much of the first lady. But 85% of democrats view her favorably, 
as do 64% of independents, the critical constituency in highly competitive 
races. Her strongest appeal is to women voters, particularly motivating 
swing women voters, the soccer moms. And also appealing to the waitress 
moms, the ones who aren't thinking about voting republican but are 
wondering whether they're going to vote at all. The first lady's schedule 
for the campaign's final week is being left open for now so she can 
pick states and races where democrats think she'll have the most impact.
