This is Dennis Michael with the "Hollywood Minute." Martin Lawrence 
is not returning to the weekly TV grind after all. Reports that the 
comedian is in talks to return in a comedy series have been denied 
by Lawrence's camp. He is in talks to star in a comedy about a family 
that adopts a drug-sniffing dog from the witness protection program. 
But "see spot run" is projected as a feature.
