Colombian President Andre Pastrana has warned striking public sector 
employees he has no intention of negotiating with them. As the work 
stoppage enters it's second week. Tens of thousands of state workers 
marched through downtown Bogota Wednesday to protest the Government's 
refusal to grant an above inflation pay raise, of about 17 percent. 
Mr. Pastrana says their demands jeopardize Columbia's financial stability.
