No, it's not a keyhole. I'm not looking through the doorway at someone. 
I'm looking through the on-net port. Port of entry to a seamless global 
network. A network that will change the fortunes of countless companies 
and the lives of thousands of Telecom managers and CIOs. I see them 
out there, right now. They seem... rather happy. On-net. From MCI 
Worldcom. A former sitcom star is "going to the dogs" on the big screen. 
That and more in the "Hollywood Minute."
