Congress and the White House finished work on the federal budget. 
A deal Wuk struck. The budget agreement was two weeks overdue. At 
times negotiators worked around the clock to find a deal. With today's 
agreement a government shutdown is averted. President Clinton speaking 
a few moments ago, called it a great deal for America. Today every 
American can take a great deal of pride in knowing that we are going 
to save social security, that we are going to have 100,000 teachers, 
that we are going to continue to move forward on the environment and 
now we are free here to keep our economy going by meeting our responsibilities 
to deal with the global economic challenges. This is a very, very 
good day for America. But the agreement really gives both sides bragging 
rights. The democrats and republicans got the money they wanted but 
deals were reached on anti-drug programs. Republicans can say they 
fulfilled their promise to increase defense spending. If a young man 
or young woman has the patriotism and courage to put on the uniform 
of the United States, they should have the best equipment, the best 
training and adequate forces to win desigh civil with minimum American 
casualties and I am very proud that this is the first time since 1985 
that in peace time, we have increased defense spending because our 
young men and women in uniform dev the support of the United States 
of America. Once the appropriations Bill is passed by the house and 
Senate Congress will adjourn at long last for the November 3rd election. 
The vote is expected Friday.
