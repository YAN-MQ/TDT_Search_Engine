Although ``The Poisonwood Bible'' takes place in the former Belgian 
Congo and begins in 1959 and ends in the 1990s, Barbara Kingsolver's 
powerful new book is actually an old-fashioned 19th-century novel, 
a Hawthornian tale of sin and redemption, and the ``dark necessity'' 
of history. The novel's central character, a fiery evangelical missionary 
named Nathan Price, is part Roger Chillingworth, the coldhearted, 
judgmental villain of Hawthorne's ``Scarlet Letter,'' and part Ahab, 
Melville's monomaniacal captain who risks his own life and the lives 
of those closest to him in pursuit of his obsessive vision. On the 
surface, certainly, ``Poisonwood'' might seem to have little in common 
with Ms. Kingsolver's earlier work (``The Bean Trees,'' ``Pigs in 
Heaven,'' ``Animal Dreams,'' ``Homeland and Other Stories''), fiction 
set for the most part in the American South and Southwest and dealing, 
most memorably, with the plight of single mothers trying to sort out 
their lives. These previous works, however, also grappled with social 
injustice, with the intersection of public events with private concerns 
and the competing claims of community and individual will _ some of 
the very themes that animate the saga of Nathan Price and his family 
and their journey into the heart of darkness. Narrated in alternating 
chapters by Nathan's wife, Orleanna, and their four daughters, Rachel, 
Leah, Adah and Ruth May, ``The Poisonwood Bible'' begins with the 
arrival of the Price family in the remote Congolese village of Kilanga 
_ a tiny cluster of mud houses devoid of all the ordinary amenities 
of life back home in ``the easy land of ice cream cones and new Keds 
sneakers and We like Ike.'' Here, there are plagues of killer ants, 
hordes of malaria-carrying mosquitoes and unseen parasites, and lions 
and tarantulas and snakes _ a fearsome world of nature whose perils 
are magnified by political and racial tensions. Moving fluently from 
one point of view to another, Ms. Kingsolver does a nimble job of 
delineating the Price girls' responses to Africa and their father's 
decision to uproot them. At 15, Rachel, the whiny would-be beauty 
queen who ``cares for naught but appearances,'' can think only of 
what she misses: the five-day deodorant pads she forgot to bring, 
flush toilets, machine-washed clothes and other things, as she says 
with her willful gift for malapropism, that she has taken ``for granite.'' 
Leah, the feisty one, pledges herself to her father's mission in the 
face of mounting opposition, while her twin, Adah, damaged since birth 
and unable (or unwilling) to speak, records her observations of her 
family with a shrewd poetic intelligence. As for the youngest, 5-year 
old Ruth May, she brightly tries to make sense of the exotic new world 
in which she finds herself, even as she makes friends with the children 
of Kilanga. All this while their mother, Orleanna, struggles with 
the hardships of daily life _ toting and disinfecting the family's 
water, scrambling to make ends meet and trying to protect her family 
from the myriad terrors of the bush. Orleanna's misgivings about her 
husband mount as his hubris and utter selfishness become more and 
more apparent. Although the local people are reluctant to abandon 
their traditional deities (and fearful of baptizing their children 
in the crocodile-infested waters of the nearby river), Nathan vows 
to convert them. He proves equally oblivious to the welfare of his 
own family when he refuses their entreaties to leave _ even in the 
face of illness and escalating violence against whites. Indeed he 
will end up sacrificing the life of one of his daughters to his self-righteous 
beliefs. Nathan, of course, is meant to represent the patronizing 
attitude of white colonialists toward Africa _ and the devastating 
legacy of violence they bequeathed to regions like the Congo. Such 
efforts by Ms. Kingsolver to turn the story of the Price family into 
a social allegory can be heavy-handed at times, transforming many 
of her characters into one-dimensional pawns in a starkly lit morality 
play. Orleanna, it's clear, is a symbol of the not-so-innocent bystander, 
whose own passivity keeps her from speaking up against the crimes 
of others; Rachel is a symbol of the selfish pragmatist, who puts 
her own desires before the needs of others; and Rachel's lover, a 
white mercenary and diamond smuggler named Axelroot is a symbol of 
foreign meddling in the Congo. Even the Prices' pet parrot, Methuselah 
(long accustomed to living in a cage and eaten by a wild animal once 
it is released), becomes a symbol of the Congo's newly won independence 
_ independence that swiftly devolves into violence under the dictatorial 
rule of the Cold War strongman Mobutu Sese Seko. One of the things 
that keeps ``The Poisonwood Bible'' from becoming overly schematic 
and lends the novel a fierce emotional undertow is Ms. Kingsolver's 
love of detail, her eye for the small facts of daily life: the Betty 
Crocker cake mixes, carefully carried to Kilanga, that won't work 
in Orleanna's primitive African kitchen; the Clorox bleach, ``measured 
out like the Blood of the Lamb'' to wash the local produce; the endless 
bargaining the Congolese, under Mobutu's regime, must conduct for 
everything from a kidney-stone operation to a postage stamp. In addition, 
Ms. Kingsolver endows two of her narrators, Leah and Adah, with a 
sympathetic intelligence that reveals both their girlish difficulties 
in coping with their family's plight and their maturing need to make 
sense of the world for themselves. In watching these two Price sisters 
grow up _ one will become a doctor in America; the other, the wife 
of a Congolese activist jailed for opposing Mobutu _ the reader is 
made to understand not only the ways in which a father's sins are 
visited upon (and expiated by) his children, but also the ways in 
which private lives can be shaped and shattered by public events. 
As Leah will observe many years later, ``We've all ended up giving 
up body and soul to Africa, one way or another.'' Each of us, she 
adds, ``got our heart buried in six feet of African dirt; we are all 
co-conspirators here.'' PUBLICATION NOTES `THE POISONWOOD BIBLE' By
