Today Middle East paste talking convened outside of Washington. Mr. 
Clinton is trying to broker a deal whereby Israel would give up more 
west banch land and the plains would crack down harder on terrorists. 
Recessions that seem far less now will seem far less likely in anacord 
that move them towards every lasting peace. Talk of upcoming impeachment 
hearings has for now receded at the White House and that for the president 
is the best news of all. David Bloom at the White House tonight. Thanks 
very much.
