Attorney general Janet Reno is calling again for passage of federal 
hate crime legislation. She met with gay and lesbian activists in 
Washington Wednesday. They want a law that would permit federal prosecution 
of crimes based on a person's gender, disability or sexual orientation. 
The renewed debate follows the murder of a gay Wyoming college student. 
Police say Matthew shepard was pistol-whipped and lashed to a fence 
post near laramie last week in what some are calling a hate crime. 
A vigil for shepard was held Wednesday night outside the capitol. 
Several members of Congress spoke to those gathered. House minority 
leader Dick Gephardt urged his colleagues in Congress and citizens 
across the country, to help bring an end to such violence. We all 
join with each of you in expressing our heartfelt sorrow over the 
death of Matthew shepard. Despite all of the hurt we feel, now's not 
a time for vengeance or retribution or anger or finger pointing. Now 
is the time as citizens of the greatest democracy that's ever existed 
on earth, to take citizen action to make sure we stop this kind of 
crime from ever occurring again anywhere in America. About 100 people 
also gathered on the University of Wyoming campus Wednesday, in a 
forum designed to let people share their feelings about the killing.
