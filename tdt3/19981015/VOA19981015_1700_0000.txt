The president launches Israeli-Palestinian summit aimed at breaking 
the deadlock in the middle-east peace process. And Israeli commentators 
are saying the country's new Foreign Minister could play an important 
role in the peace talks. A spokesman for ethnic Albanian rebels in 
Kosovo says Yugoslavia is violating the Kosovo peace deal and that 
western nations know about the violations, but are keeping silent. 
The Red Cross victims of Hurricane George. And the U.S. government 
finally has a budget deal acceptable to all sides. I'm Susan Yackie. 
And I am Tom Crosby. We will have details on those stories, business 
news, sports, and much more on this hour of VOA News Now. First, a 
summary of world news. I'm Pat Bodner, VOA News.
