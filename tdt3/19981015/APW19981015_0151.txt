Prime Minister Yevgeny Primakov ordered the government and its agencies 
to start settling their huge outstanding bills, a problem that has 
paralyzed the Russian economy. The Cabinet discussed these measures 
a week ago and was scheduled to finalize them Thursday. But Primakov 
abruptly canceled the Cabinet meeting, saying the proposals were already 
clear and needed to be implemented. ``We have had enough discussions, 
we now must act,'' spokesman Igor Shchegolev quoted him as saying. 
The plan worked out by the economics and finance ministries would 
require the government and state-owned companies to clear their mutual 
debts of some 50 billion rubles (dlrs 3.8 billion) by mid-December. 
The cash-strapped government has been a major debtor in the Russian 
economy, failing to pay wages and pensions to workers and other bills 
to state-run companies. The workers and companies then cannot pay 
their bills, leading to a chain of non-payments that is disabling 
Russian industries. Officials admit that the unpaid bills among the 
government and the state-owned companies and organizations are small 
compared to those in the private sector. They estimate all debts in 
Russia total a staggering 1.2 trillion rubles (dlrs 92 billion), or 
about 40 percent of the country's gross domestic product. Primakov 
has said the government bills must be settled without printing new 
money, a move that would lead to high inflation. However, he has not 
said where the money will come from and it is likely that many of 
the debts will be settled through barter or other non-cash transactions. 
In other economic news Thursday: _ Russia's hard currency reserves 
rose from dlrs 12.8 billion to dlrs 13.3 billion in the week ending 
Oct. 9, the Central Bank said. The bank has been actively buying dollars 
in recent weeks to strengthen its reserves depleted at the start of 
the crisis. _ Inflation for the first 12 days of October was 0.8 percent, 
after soaring last month following the ruble's sharp plunge. Average 
daily price increases decreased from 1.09 percent in September to 
0.66 percent this month, the State Statistics Committee said.
