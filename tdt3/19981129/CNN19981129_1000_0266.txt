You may think "road rage" is getting worse, but some analysts say 
that's not so. "The Washington Post" reports, there is no statistical 
evidence to back up the perception that road rage is on the rise and 
making driving more dangerous. Researchers say the highway death rate 
and number of injuries and crashes are declining. Others say aggression 
on the highway could be increasing, but better equipment is keeping 
people safer.
