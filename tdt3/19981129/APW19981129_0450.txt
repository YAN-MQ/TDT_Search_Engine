Police will begin regular patrols in some areas of the city in the 
latest effort to curb rising crime and rebuild public confidence in 
a force shaken by mishaps and scandals. About 250 additional officers 
have been assigned to patrol areas of Athens with the highest reported 
rates of crime beginning Monday. Plans call for introducing foot patrols, 
common in places such as Britain and the United States but untested 
in Greece. ``The public must feel confidence in the police force,'' 
Public Order Minister Philipos Petsalnikos said Saturday. ``This is 
not a measure which will disappear in a few days, these policemen 
will be around for a long time.'' Police credibility has been repeatedly 
battered over the last two months by corruption scandals and embarrassing 
bungles. They have cost the police chief and public order minister 
their jobs and led to the indictment of senior officers. Petsalnikos, 
appointed a month ago, launched the measure to fight bank robberies 
and other forms of street crime, still rising despite police initiatives. 
He also plans to scrutinize police officers' income declarations, 
amend promotion procedures and create an internal affairs bureau watchdog 
group.
