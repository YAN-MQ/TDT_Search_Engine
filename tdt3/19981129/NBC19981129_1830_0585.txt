To Texas now and day three of the manhunt for a convicted murderer 
and death row inmate who escaped on Thanksgiving night. NBC's Rick 
Davis on the breakout and the chase. 500 Texas laufsers on foot, on 
horse back with dogs and helicopters are searching for the first escape 
since a member of the Bonnie and Clyde did it. This time men tried 
to escape. Only one made it through gunshots and over prison fences. 
Until Thursday night, 29-year-old Martin grewly were one of 454 men 
on death row in Texas. Convicted of killing two men in 1992 during 
a robbery. It was a day of sorrow then for the wife of one victim, 
a time of anger now for the mother of the second. It's cruel, but 
I mean it. If they catch him, I hope that he puts up a fight and they 
kill him Officers believe that he's still within eight miles of the 
prison. He has not slept for two or three days. Hunger, the elements 
just from mosquitoes, it's been a little bit cool and we hope a lot 
of fear. We just hope he's just scared to death out there right now. 
Because he knows we're not backing off. Prison officials promise a 
tough investigation about the lapse of security that allowed him to 
escape. Rick Davis, NBC news.
