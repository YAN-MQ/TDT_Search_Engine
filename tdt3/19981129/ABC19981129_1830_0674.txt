Not long ago, only Arkansas and West Virginia had worse 11-emergency 
coverage than Vermont. But starting this week, it's a different story. 
ABC's Jami Floyd explains. Ted Jones knew what to do when he had a 
heart attack. I just called 911. But no one was quite sure just where 
he was. The dispatcher, he said, "the ambulance is En route, but they 
don't know where hicks road is." In rural states like Vermont, that 
is the nightmare emergency response teams face every day -- not knowing 
where their victim is. But now, Vermont has the first statewide digital 
satellite-based 911 system, using satellites to map remote locations 
with pinpoint accuracy. The new system puts callers in touch with 
dispatchers faster, giving dispatchers more of the information they 
need to save lives. It will be on their screen, in front of their 
eyes and Ringing within two seconds of the time when the person dials 
911. Hi, this is Vermont 911. I received a call from your residence. 
This is the main call center in Williston, Vermont. 0% of the state's 
911 calls will come through here, making it Vermont's largest public 
safety answering point. Setting up the new program has been challenging, 
because 70% of Vermont residents did not have numbered street addresses, 
many having only a P.O. box, some, no address at all. So, officials 
had to remap the entire state. For the last four years, a fleet of 
high-tech vans has been crisscrossing vermont's country roads. At 
each stop, a laser range finder sends a signal to a fleet of global-positioning 
satellites orbiting the earth. The satellites pinpoint the coordinates 
of businesses, homes, farms and barns, literally every building. And 
state officials assign each one a new address. The end product, a 
digitized map of Vermont that forms the basis of the new 911 system. 
It's gonna save lives, because it gets us to a scene quicker, so we 
can make rescues quicker. The system is expected to work so well, 
that other rural states are planning to follow Vermont's example and 
implement their own high-tech 911 systems. Jami Floyd, ABC News, Williston, 
Vermont.
