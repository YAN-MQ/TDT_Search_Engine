A Medicare decision may keep some women from getting an alternative 
pap smear which supporters say is better than the standard test. Government 
health regulators call "thinprep" significantly more effective. But 
the American college of obstetrics and gynecology and many insurers 
think it's not good enough to justify its extra $15 to $20 per test 
cost. Because Medicare will let states decide how much to pay for 
pap smears, not all Medicare patients will be able to get the alternative 
test.
