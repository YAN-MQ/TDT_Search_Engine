Ann Jackson remembers particularly vividly one meeting when she was 
trying to get In Style magazine off the ground for Time Inc. in the 
early 1990s. Ms. Jackson, now the publisher of the In Style Group 
of magazines, showed sample spreads of posing starlets to a group 
of Time Inc. senior editors, including the company's chief executive, 
Don Logan. After a ponderous silence, one of the men in the room _ 
and they were all men _ grumbled a question. ``He wanted to know why 
the pictures were so big, why they showed everything from head to 
toe,'' Ms. Jackson explained. ``I looked out at this phalanx of men 
and I said, `Why? Because we want to see the shoes! The shoes are 
key!' And the whole room looked at me like I was from Mars.'' It was 
an encounter, she said, that underscored what might be a fundamental 
difference between men and women. But Ms. Jackson and her colleagues 
prevailed and the gamble _ to create a magazine so slavish and so 
devoted in its adoration of celebrity culture that it makes People 
magazine look positively dour by comparison _ has paid off handsomely. 
With all the gravity of a helium-filled balloon, it has moved the 
Time Warner unit into what may prove to be a hot competition for a 
share of the women's magazine market, a field dominated by Conde Nast 
(Vogue, Glamour and Mademoiselle) and Hearst Magazines (Harper's Bazaar, 
Marie Claire and Cosmopolitan). In Style is a monthly bible of celebrity, 
a frothy, adoring homage to movie and sitcom stars, pop singers and 
talk show hosts. The magazine's secret weapon: It covers fashion, 
home furnishings and beauty from the vantage point of the celebrity. 
If a famous person _ or even semifamous _ wears it, eats it, sleeps 
on it or scratches her back with it, then it's fodder for In Style. 
Most important, In Style is Time Inc.'s brightest foray to date into 
the women's market. Time Inc. shelved one attempt, Makeover, after 
several test issues in the early 1990s, and plans for a soap-opera 
magazine were scrapped then. But in 1999, Sports Illustrated for Women 
will try to make its mark with four issues, and Time Inc.'s development 
editors are weighing the benefits of a magazine aimed at women in 
their 40s and 50s, a market already addressed by More magazine, from 
Meredith Corp. Will Time Inc. _ the publisher of such stately tomes 
as Time and Fortune _ make its mark in the women's field? Will the 
next Vogue magazine come out of the same building that publishes Life, 
Money and Sports Illustrated? It seems only natural, said Ann Moore, 
president of the People division at Time Inc., a group that includes 
People, People en Espanol, Teen People, In Style and In Style's new 
German edition. ``Where did People come from? It was the best-read 
section in Time. What's the best-loved section of People? Star Tracks,'' 
Ms. Moore said, referring to the celebrity lifestyle column in People 
that generated In Style four years ago. ``It tells you where famous 
people are going and what they're wearing. We all loved celebrities, 
real-life celebrities.'' Christine Miller, executive vice president 
of marketing for the Magazine Publishers of America, said that before 
In Style, the prevailing wisdom in the industry was that the women's 
market was saturated. ``When In Style began, everyone said that `People 
already covers the celebrity aspect of what you're going to cover 
and fashion books already cover the fashion,' but Martha Nelson smartly 
found a niche within that celebrity journalism, and within the women's 
market,'' she said, referring to In Style's editor. ``It's not just 
who's dating who, but who's living how,'' she said. ``It proved there 
was room to grow, once you find your niche.'' Since the first issue 
in June 1994, In Style has filled its pages with broadly grinning 
starlets, in designer dresses, at elegantly catered parties, in artfully 
decorated homes, eating in their favorite restaurants, wearing their 
favorite jewelry, sunning in idyllic vacation spots, stumping for 
their favorite charities. Most of the captions that identify the merchandise 
also provide toll-free numbers, so the reader can call the retailer 
directly and buy the satin dress or rhinestone barrettes or four-poster 
bed favored by Salma, Jada or Cindy. (That's Salma Hayek, Jada Pinkett 
Smith and Cindy Crawford, if you happen not to be a reader.) Even 
Ms. Moore says the truth without shame: ``Look, we think of it as 
a catalog.'' The combination of celebrity lore, fashion and beauty 
news, and personal shopping companion has proved to be a hefty hit 
with readers and with advertisers. In Style's ad revenue has quintupled 
in three years. The magazine's first full year, 1995, brought in $12.6 
million in ad revenue, according to the Publishers Information Bureau. 
This year that number has climbed to $69.2 million _ and that's only 
through September. The advertising strength can be attributed to the 
desirable demographics of the readership. The average household income 
of an In Style reader is $64,214, according to Mediamark Research 
Inc., which studies the magazine industry. One-quarter of the readership 
has a household income of more than $100,000. Almost three-quarters 
are college-educated. More important, the magazine's newsstand sales 
_ perhaps the best measure of plain old-fashioned enthusiasm for a 
magazine _ are robust, the best of any consumer magazine priced higher 
than $3 an issue. (In Style is price-testing the magazine around the 
country, but most issues sell for $3.50.) For the first half of 1998, 
In Style outpaced Vogue at the newsstand by almost 200,000 copies: 
In Style's average newsstand circulation for the first half of 1998 
was 735,784, while Vogue's was 545,311 and Vanity Fair's was 406,902. 
(Vogue's overall circulation for the same period was 1,125,585; Vanity 
Fair's was 1,118,895.) One secret of the magazine's appeal, Ms. Nelson 
says, is its avoidance of anything that even hints at imperfection. 
Having done stints at People and its Australian cousin, Who Weekly, 
Ms. Nelson had never been a fan of women's magazines, saying they 
offer too much in the way of self-help. ``Too often, women's magazines 
create a feeling of anxiety without intending to,'' Ms. Nelson said. 
``When you're reading the traditional women's magazines, they're loaded 
with this prescriptive advice, all of which is utterly well intentioned 
by the editors, but the feeling at the end is: `I'm not doing anything 
right; I'm inadequate; I don't have a good-enough sex life; I'm not 
feeding the kids right.' I made a conscious decision not to include 
that sort of information.'' Ms. Nelson said she relied on ``beauty 
and pleasure'' as her guiding editorial principles. ``Women deserve 
a treat,'' she said. She also relies on the fact that readers feel 
a more intimate bond with movie stars than with fashion models. ``If 
you put 20 models in a row, and 20 movie stars in a row, your reader 
will more closely identify with the movie star,'' she said. ``They 
have more variety, and they exude more personality. Readers think 
they know their personalities. If I say Ally McBeal, you think: `I 
know her; I know what she's about; I know what her life might be like.' 
You can't say the same thing about Kate Moss.'' Ms. Nelson added that 
consumers have wearied of reading fashion magazines that seem to have 
remained unchanged for the last three decades. But Jeannette Chang, 
publisher of what could be considered a rival, Harper's Bazaar, said: 
``When you think that we've been in business for 131 years, you might 
think that Liz Tilberis recognizes change,'' she said of the magazine's 
editor. ``We have changed fashion and beauty coverage over the years.'' 
Needless to say, In Style provides one-stop shopping for public relations 
agents and is a favorite of the Hollywood press agencies. Larry Winokur, 
a partner in the Los Angeles public relations firm of Baker Winokur 
Ryder, said the magazine was more appealing to public relations agents 
than any other because clients are guaranteed soft, noncontroversial 
coverage, and because In Style _ in its mix of fashion, celebrity, 
home furnishing and beauty _ allows public relations agents to publicize 
a variety of products. Winokur said he was planning to have several 
of his clients covered in one spot, all at one time. ``For example, 
we're opening the Atlantis Resort,'' Winokur said, referring to a 
Caribbean resort that he represents. ``And we're throwing a $5-million-plus 
party on Dec. 12 and 13. We represent the resort, and we're sending 
many celebrities down. We may grant an exclusive to In Style to cover 
some aspects of the party. So now we have a great, guaranteed party 
story. We get pages on the resort in the magazine. And we have the 
potential to bring our clients forward.'' ``There are few magazines 
_ actually no magazines, come to think of it,'' he said, ``that would 
allow you to promote your resort, your celebrities and your party, 
all at once.'' Ms. Nelson said she had not guaranteed Winokur coverage. 
``I'm sure that it's on a roster,'' she said. ``And if it turns out 
to be a story of interest to our readers, then we'll run it.'' Norman 
Pearlstine, editor in chief of Time Inc., said he was not bothered 
by the magazine's bubbly tone. ``It's a great success, and that's 
what matters,'' he said. ``It works for a combination of reasons. 
There's a service component that Martha and her colleagues take pretty 
seriously. There's a fascination with celebrity and celebrity lifestyle. 
And the demographics of who's reading it are very good: working women 
with reasonably good incomes and by presumption reasonably good jobs.'' 
Pearlstine also credited some of the magazine's success to its quality 
of accessible escapism. ``I've often thought that was what made Martha 
Stewart a success, too,'' he said. ``I don't think everyone wants 
to make the 85-step dessert, but there's certainly a curiosity about 
it. In terms of In Style, everybody wants to wear Versace's party 
dress, and there's a kind of wonderful escapism in observing women 
you might identify with at some level in Versace's party dress.'' 
And even if In Style is known for being utterly lightweight, that 
does not bother Ms. Moore. For instance, a recent sketch on ``Saturday 
Night Live'' spoofed the magazine. The announcer of the fictional 
``VH1 Spirituality Awards'' said the awards were sponsored by In Style 
magazine. ``In Style,'' the voice announced, with the glib intonation 
of a game show host, ``because People sometimes has stories about 
cancer patients _ and you don't need that.'' ``That's terrific,'' 
Ms. Moore said when she heard about the sketch. ``That tells me that 
we've arrived.''
