Britain and Chile are denying reports in London newspapers that they 
have reached a deal to send former Chilean dictator augusto Pinochet 
home to stand trial. He's charged with human rights abuses during 
his 17-year regime. Chilean officials say they are not negotiating 
any deals, and British officials say Pinochet's legal status hasn't 
changed from last week. Spanish authorities are seeking Pinochet's 
extradition. They want to try him for genocide, torture and terrorism.
