Keyshawn Johnson stood outside the New York Jets' locker room late 
on Sunday afternoon, holding forth for yet another wave of reporters 
in the wake of a 48-21 Jets victory. The star receiver had enjoyed 
another stellar day: 3 receptions for 77 yards. But his biggest play 
had come on the run, and that's what everyone had crowded around to 
hear about. Midway through the second quarter, Johnson executed a 
perfect end around. He had turned the corner, which opponents had 
doubted that he could do, and he had turned upfield and outrun the 
secondary, which opponents had doubted that he could do. Now Johnson 
was crowing. ``I've asked for that play to be put in our play book,'' 
Johnson said. ``I know that I can get around that corner. Everybody 
says, `He doesn't have the necessary speed, he's not a fast receiver, 
he's a possession receiver.' You always try to prove a point, you 
always try to prove people wrong.'' Johnson was interrupted in midthought 
as the door to the Jets' locker room swung open. Out walked Bryan 
Cox, the volatile outside linebacker. Cox, accompanied by his young 
son, Bryan Jr., coaxed his son to ask Johnson to autograph his hat. 
This was a great snapshot: The Jets' two most outspoken and bodacious 
players caught in a semitender moment. Each player had achieved a 
milestone on this afternoon: Johnson's touchdown was his first running 
touchdown as a professional. Cox's third-quarter sack of Steve Beuerlein 
in the end zone was the first safety of his career. But Cox hadn't 
seen Johnson's touchdown run. ``You didn't see my T.D.?'' Johnson 
asked, his voice laced with a trace of disappointment. Cox hadn't, 
but there was something else that he did see. ``I saw that linebacker 
run you down,'' he said. ``Tell them about that.'' Leave it to Cox. 
He was referring to a play in the third quarter when Johnson caught 
a pass and ran 37 yards only to be caught from behind by Kinnon Tatum, 
a 6-foot, 222-pound linebacker. Johnson finished signing the cap and 
Cox and his son began walking away. But now suddenly the receiver 
had gone from basking in the sun to explaining himself. ``I couldn't 
get going,'' Johnson said, trying to explain why he had been caught 
from behind. ``For me to stop and start again, it's kind of difficult.'' 
But Cox just walked away with a smug smile on his face, acting as 
if he hadn't heard. In a teasing way on an otherwise great day for 
the Jets, Cox was reminding his young teammate that the hard part 
of the season is yet to come, that in the long run it's what you don't 
do that sends teams home frustrated. Earlier in the day Cox had played 
down his own big play, which resulted in the safety. ``It was good,'' 
he said. ``But you really have to be blessed to get those kinds of 
plays. I was able to run in free on that play.'' Cox said that he 
was disappointed in the two touchdowns the Jets' defense had allowed 
in the second half. ``We're still immature,'' Cox said. ``We still 
didn't put our feet on their throats when we had them down. That's 
something that a great team has to do. I was disappointed that we 
didn't do it.'' Cox was echoing what Jets Coach Bill Parcells had 
said during his post-game remarks. Asked continually about the game 
and what it meant, Parcells, answering sharply and shortly, said, 
``This was a good game, a good game to get out of.'' Parcells, like 
Cox, also played down Johnson's rushing touchdown. ``That wasn't all 
there was to this game,'' he said. ``I know that it was esthetically 
pleasing, but that's not what this game was about.'' Someone asked 
Parcells if Johnson still had room to improve. Parcells rolled his 
eyes and said in an exasperated tone of voice, ``Are you kidding me?'' 
Parcells spoke of nuances yet to be mastered by Johnson: running pass 
routes, reading coverages. ``This guy has got a lot to learn,'' Parcells 
said. ``An awful lot. I guess I'm just a little harder to please than 
most.'' On a winning afternoon, a bold young player, a cagey veteran 
and a wise old coach began preparing for a grueling final stretch. 
The only time Cox became passionate was when he referred to comments 
he had made last week about racism by the National Football League. 
He made the comments after the league fined him $10,000 as a result 
of two hits he made on opposing players in last Sunday's game. On 
Sunday, Cox said his error was not the content of his statements but 
their timing. ``I feel that the things I said this week, although 
they may have been very accurate, weren't timely,'' he said. ``I said 
what I said, but I said it at the wrong time. I took away from the 
preparation my team was doing. It didn't take away from it, as it 
turns out, but it could have.'' Now the Jets begin a hopeful march 
toward the playoffs and payoffs. One young player, Johnson, is exuberant, 
but the veterans like Cox begin to get nervous. They know how slender 
the thread is between winning and losing. ``I just feel good that 
our team came to play today and didn't let my situation be a distraction,'' 
Cox said. ``We've proven that we can win at home. But now we've got 
to prove that we can do it on the road.''
