Singer Neil diamond is making his fans very happy. He has a new album, 
and he's starting a world tour. Gloria Hillard talked with him about 
those projects. Want to try one with me? One, two, three -- There's 
no mistaking the voice. And bring in the melody. Love on the rocks 
ain't no surprise now how many in the audience can finish the lyrics. 
We've been listening to Neil diamond songs for three decades. A revolving 
stage. And on this day, he's getting ready to begin another world 
tour, the first one in two years. Well, I'll have to transform myself 
somehow into this other person that can sing and dance and jump around 
for two hours. I gave you my heart, yeah I gave you my soul I always 
promise myself that i'll work out, you know, for like six months before 
I go out. You know, I just go up and do it. The adrenalin that you 
get from the audience is enough to carry you, even if your body won't, 
the adrenalin will. His new concert tour will include songs from his 
new album, the movie album, "as time goes by," featuring classic movie 
songs. Now I shout it from the highest hills And the making of the 
album is an amc special. We had the good fortune to get elmer bernstein 
to conduct this thing. Those songs were around when I was growing 
up. I remember them, I Sang them. And then he began writing his own 
at the age of 16. I was taking guitar lessons. You know, writing a 
song to a girl can be pretty impressive. It's better than Flowers, 
even. Which brings to mind another diamond classic. You don't bring 
me Flowers anymore I found out after years of writing that many of 
my songs are autobiographical in one way or another. They show some 
insight into myself. As time goes by And taking a cue from that lyric 
-- This time of my life is a time of reflection. I've had the most 
amazing run. I think after this tour, it'll be time for me to really 
think about what i'm doing and what I want to do with the rest of 
my life. Gloria Hillard, "CNN Entertainment News," Los Angeles.
