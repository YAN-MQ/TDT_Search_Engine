Israeli Cabinet ministers called Sunday for military strikes against 
Beirut's power and water supplies in retaliation for the killing of 
Israeli soldiers by Islamic guerrillas in south Lebanon. Seven Israeli 
soldiers have been killed in the past two weeks by the Iranian-backed 
Hezbollah militia in the security zone which Israel occupies in south 
Lebanon to protect its northern border. Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu 
cut short a European trip to England and Spain to deal with a growing 
debate in Israel over the losses in Lebanon and calls for a unilateral 
Israeli withdrawal. The 12-member Cabinet security committee was meeting 
Sunday in Jerusalem to hear military and security chiefs report on 
the Lebanon situation after Netanyahu returned from visiting soldiers 
wounded in the latest fighting. ``We are looking for an arrangement 
in which we can achieve that objective of protecting northern Israel 
without our presence in Lebanon,'' Netanyahu said Sunday. But he said 
Cabinet members would discuss minimizing Israeli troop casualties, 
not withdrawal. ``As long as we don't have a way of leaving Lebanon 
in an arrangement that will guarantee the safety of northern Israel, 
our main objective is to protect Israeli soldiers,'' he said.
