Police won't confirm it, but a Seattle TV station has identified the 
man who apparently shot a bus driver, then took his own life Friday. 
The shooting caused the bus to plunge from a bridge onto an apartment 
building. 32 passengers were injured. The bus driver was killed in 
the crash, and another passenger died from his injuries yesterday. 
Station king says the suspect is a 43-year-old man who apparently 
spent time at a local homeless Shelter. He was regarded there as well-behaved. 
Police still have no motive for the shooting.
