In "focus" this evening -- the 1998 hurricane season. It started quietly 
on June 1st and ends tomorrow as the deadliest season in more than 
200 years. The worst of it was in August and September, when georges 
and Mitch laid waste to the Caribbean. NBC's tracie potts has our 
storm watch report. More than four weeks after hurricane Mitch made 
landfall in central America, survival continues to be a struggle. 
The death toll stands at 11,000, mostly in Nicaragua and Honduras. 
More than 1 million people remain homeless. Children still have trouble 
sleeping. They will scream out and yell these screams of pure terror. 
And if you can get them awake, you'll see the terror in their eyes. 
Part of our job is to bring them a sense of normality. You're safe 
you. And it will subside when we can help them to realize there is 
hope. From Honduras to the Florida keys the storms of the 1998 hurricane 
season left ugly marks. There were 14 named storms making it one of 
the busiest ever. More tonights for steintists to study the storms. 
This is the tropical rainfall mission. We have learned things. At 
an orbit above the earth. It's able to create images of rain and clouds. 
We've seen hurricane tops and clouds. Images such as these, tall clouds 
in hurricane Bonnie, which landed in North Carolina. The largest cloud 
rising 59,000 feet, double the cruising altitude of many commercial 
airliners. Scientists believe they are precursors to a hurricane gaining 
strength. Trim scans weather systems near the equator. We've learned 
that lightning and storms over the ocean is quite different from lightning 
and storms over land masses. And they are learning to understand land-based 
storms. But the data, showing changes in the earth's weather pattern, 
has some concerned. We have to worry about whether or not we're changing 
this pln aet and its climate in a way that will be harmful to future 
generations. The toll from hurricane Mitch has meteorologists thinking 
how they measure hurricane danger. Most of Mitch's damage was due 
to mud slides caused by rains, as much as two feet a day, while winds 
remain below hurricane velocity. Tracie potts, NBC news. And this 
footnote -- forecasters are already making predictions about the 1999 
hurricane season. The early word, expect more of the most powerful 
storms.
