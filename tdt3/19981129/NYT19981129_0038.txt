In an age distinguished by mass cruelty wherever one looks, Americans 
may be forgiven if they have not given much attention, in the intervals 
between emergencies, to the decades of troubles of the people of Taiwan. 
Monday night, to repair the neglect, comes ``Tug-of-War: The Story 
of Taiwan,'' which offers a glimpse of history from the perspective 
of a perpetual underdog caught up in wars, occupations, power plays 
and other ills of the weak confronted by the strong. The problem, 
as the narrator notes, begins with geography. Lying 90 miles from 
China, the island of Taiwan has always been ``too near to China to 
be different, too far away to be the same.'' Although they are mostly 
of Chinese stock, the Taiwanese had a reputation for independence, 
not that it did them much good in 1895, when their island fell into 
the hands of the Japanese. When Japan invaded China in 1937, the Taiwanese 
found themselves drafted to fight for the invaders. Without much affection 
for either side, they were pawns in a political contest that they 
had no power to influence. The 90-minute program gives a sense of 
what it was like for a politically marginal people caught up after 
World War II in what seemed like a remote civil war in China and then 
the even more remote maneuverings of the Cold War. (For viewers of 
a certain age, the names Quemoy and Matsu may recall panicky threats 
of war between the United States and Communist China.) The Nationalist 
Chinese who fled the mainland after the Communist takeover and established 
themselves in Taiwan saw the island as enemy territory; after decades 
of occupation, its people seemed more Japanese than Chinese. Efforts 
at independence were crushed by the Nationalists. The Taiwanese had 
a pithy line for the change in rule, from Japanese to Chinese: ``The 
dog leaves, but the pig comes.'' The doleful history is brightened 
by a look at how U.S. aid, shifts in diplomatic calculations, the 
famous Nixon opening to China, economic success and the rise of an 
indigenous opposition movement against the Nationalists has brought 
more freedom and a reassertion of cultural identity to the islanders 
in recent years. Taiwan has joined the other ``mini-dragons'' of Southeast 
Asia in the ``economic miracle'' club, at least for now. The lure 
of the vast Chinese market is strong _ money has a way of making allies 
_ but the worries about provoking China with too flagrant a show of 
independence remain real. As ever, the Taiwanese remain at the mercy 
of other, greater powers. PROGRAM NOTES: `TUG-OF-WAR: THE STORY OF 
TAIWAN' PBS, Mon., 9 p.m. Produced and directed by Judith Vecchione. 
A production of WGBH, Boston.
