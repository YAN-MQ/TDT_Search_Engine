Pope John Paul II today declared the year 2000 a holy year. In a ceremony 
at the Vatican, the Pontiff began the Catholic church's countdown 
to the new milennium. It marks the official start of final preparations 
for the holy year. The Pope told Catholics abstaining from smoking 
and drinking and giving to charity can help them get to heaven faster.
