The chief Republican vote counter in the House accused President Clinton 
on Sunday of trying to evade perjury charges ``on a technicality,'' 
and became the first member of the Republican leadership to predict 
that the House would impeach the president. Rep. Tom DeLay of Texas, 
the Republican whip, criticized Clinton's formal responses on Friday 
to 81 questions submitted by the House Judiciary Committee. ``Once 
again, the president is trying to redefine what sexual relations are, 
he's trying to use legalese and lawyerese to do two-steps around the 
questions and try to get off on a technicality,'' DeLay said on the 
CNN program ``Late Edition.'' DeLay, whose ability to keep tabs on 
Republican votes in the House is widely respected by both parties, 
cautioned that he had not taken a formal head count on impeachment. 
But he indicated that his experience told him that the House would 
follow the recommendations of the Judiciary Committee, which is expected 
to approve, along party lines, at least one charge of perjury. ``The 
majority of the House will uphold the rule of law and impeach the 
president and send the case to the Senate,'' said DeLay, who is the 
third-ranking Republican in the House. DeLay's unusual forecast came 
as an outspoken Republican on the Judiciary Committee, one who has 
implored the White House for a way to avoid impeachment, also voiced 
anger over Clinton's answers. ``He's still dancing on the head of 
a pin,'' Rep. Lindsey Graham of South Carolina said. ``Right now, 
to me, he is an unrepentant perjurer who should lose his job unless 
he changes his tone with the American people and reconciles himself 
with the law.'' Clinton's tersely worded replies, repeating earlier 
denials that he had lied under oath or had urged others to do so, 
seem to have hardened the partisan views of Republican and Democratic 
committee members, and given no new information to other lawmakers 
who are anxious to hear the president's side of the story before making 
up their minds on how to vote on impeachment. ``For those Americans 
who expected this to end up like Perry Mason, where you have someone 
confessing, I think they're going to be disappointed,'' Rep. Ed Bryant, 
R-Tenn., a member of the Judiciary Committee who favors impeachment, 
said on the NBC program ``Meet the Press.'' Clinton's responses, which 
his lawyer, David Kendall, said on Friday would be augmented soon 
by ``a further memorandum on behalf of the president,'' may complicate 
efforts by the White House and congressional Democrats to resolve 
the matter by censuring the president, rather than impeaching him. 
At least 100 Republicans would oppose a censure because it is unconstitutional, 
insufficient or a bad precedent, Republican aides say. ``This censure 
idea, without an admission on the president's part, is a political 
cop-out,'' Graham said. Many liberal Democrats object to a strongly 
worded rebuke, although House Democratic leaders who favor a censure 
to shield them from Republican criticism that they are being too lenient 
are confident they would prevail. It would take 218 votes to impeach 
or censure Clinton. The House, where terms expire on Jan. 3, now has 
228 Republicans, 206 Democrats and one independent who usually votes 
with the Democrats. DeLay's vote-counting prowess is well-regarded. 
But Republican leaders, including DeLay, have said that any lawmaker's 
vote on impeachment will be a vote of conscience, and they will not 
conduct formal head counts in advance, as is customary on most close 
votes. That makes vote estimates even more fluid than usual. Republican 
aides outside the committee estimate that 15 to 20 Republicans will 
defect, even on the perjury count, which among the three possible 
counts stands the best chance of passing. That means five to 10 Democrats 
would have to vote for impeachment for it to pass. The two other counts 
the Judiciary Committee is drawing up are obstruction of justice and 
witness tampering, and abuse of power. Rep. Peter King of New York, 
one of five Republicans who publicly oppose impeachment, agreed Sunday 
with the estimates of possible Republican defectors. ``There are people 
like myself who don't believe it rises to an impeachable offense and 
don't want to leave as our legacy that perjury from an underlying 
civil case warrants the removal of a president from office,'' King 
said on ``Meet the Press.'' ``Also, if we are going to push this impeachment 
issue and lose, I think it's going to hurt us going into the next 
session,'' King said. ``It's going to make it harder to get our agenda 
across, to get it out.'' Asked about the vote tallies, DeLay said 
he valued King's ``opinions, but I don't respect his ability to count 
votes. I don't know of 20 Republicans who would vote against impeachment.'' 
DeLay has a strong motivation to enhance the perception that the House 
might narrowly vote to impeach Clinton. The Texan is a leading opponent 
of censure, fearing, in part, that if such an alternative were offered, 
it would drain away undecided votes for impeachment. ``What kind of 
world would this be, what kind of country would this be if we have 
decided that lying to the American people, committing perjury, is 
not impeachable?'' DeLay said. ``If that's not impeachable, I don't 
know what is.'' But there is a raging debate among Democrats and Republicans 
over whether Clinton did, in fact, commit perjury, and, if so, whether 
it is an impeachable offense. Many Democrats are angry that Republicans 
would seek to impeach Clinton without calling Monica Lewinsky as a 
witness, although Democrats themselves have not called Ms. Lewinsky 
in the interests of being able to both chide the Republicans and urge 
that the inquiry end quickly. Clinton and his lawyers have based their 
arguments that he did not commit perjury on a narrow definition of 
sexual relations used in the Paula Jones sexual misconduct lawsuit. 
In drafting an article of impeachment on perjury, Republican committee 
aides would face the delicate issue of deciding how much of Clinton's 
sexual dalliance with Ms. Lewinsky they had to describe. Democrats 
on Sunday repeated that defense without going into the graphic specifics. 
Rep. Sheila Jackson Lee, D-Texas, said on ``Meet the Press'': ``We 
don't have the basic grounds for perjury. What we have is somebody's 
guess, because perjury has defenses.'' But many Republicans disagreed. 
``He lied,'' said Bryant, a former federal prosecutor. ``He has committed 
perjury when he failed to tell the entire truth.'' Some Democrats 
and Republicans who concur that Clinton lied under oath say that is 
not grave enough to impeach him. ``I believe it's perjury, I believe 
it's illegal,'' King said. ``I just don't believe it's a high crime 
such as defined by the Constitution.'' Rep. Paul McHale of Pennsylvania, 
one of the president's most outspoken Democratic critics in the House, 
said on ``Meet the Press'': ``I do believe that he engaged in perjury 
and obstruction of justice, and I do believe that he could be impeached. 
I simply think that it's in the best interests of the nation not to 
impeach him.'' McHale last week offered a harshly worded resolution 
of censure of Clinton, but so far it has drawn little reaction from 
Democrats or Republicans.
