Members of the opposition Democratic Christian Party voted Sunday 
to name banker Alberto Vallarino as their nominee for 1999 Panama's 
presidential election. Vallarino was the only candidate in the primary 
vote, open to 53,700 party members. He earlier had left the rival 
Arnulfista Party after being defeated in a primary race by Mireya 
Moscoso. In the May, 2, 1999, vote, the two candidates will face Martin 
Torrijos, the son of former Panamanian strongman Gen. Omar Torrijos, 
who is the candidate of the ruling Democratic Revolutionary Party. 
Moscoso, the second-place finisher in the 1994 presidential race, 
is the widow of President Arnulfo Arias, whose government was overthrown 
by Gen. Torrijos in 1968. President Ernesto Perez Balladares is prohibited 
by law from seeking re-election. In a referendum in August, voters 
rejected a constitutional amendment that would have allowed him to 
seek a second consecutive five-year term.
