Getting a job today may require more than a new suit, nice resume 
and good interview. Kathleen Koch reports it may also involve a trip 
to the company doctor. Harold chandlist is an evening security guard 
who spends his free time fishing or tending the yard of his Illinois 
home. He'd hoped to have a job making plastic parts at this nearby 
plant. But he never got an offer, he says, after being given a physical 
and a test to see if he might someday develop a nerve condition called 
carpal tunnel syndrome. They told me I didn't pass that test, which 
I didn't know what that was, actually. Never heard of it. The ooec 
is now suing Rockwell on behalf of chand the list and 80 other workers 
who applied for jobs. The decision or not to hire someone, that cannot 
be based on insurance considerations, worker's comp krgs, any kind 
of speculation about what might happen to the person in the future. 
Rockwell denies it did anything improper. Three-quarters of companies 
say they perform some sort of medical skreeng include drug and alcohol 
tests. 49% focus medical exams on new hires, 5% require them of current 
employees. You can't hire someone to do a job who are physically incapable 
of performing it not only today, but tomorrow and down the road. So 
employee health is a legitimate concern of the employers and that's 
why the tests appear. Krit tix aren't so sure. We're seeing employers 
who are trying to find out people who might be sick in the future 
who might run up the company's medical bills and to screen them out 
even though the company knows they can do the job perfectly well. 
Some medical testing is legal once a job offer has been made as long 
as the exam is directly relevant to job reqirms. Though it can be 
misused and laws changed to give workers more protection. Kathleen 
Koch for CNN, Washington.
