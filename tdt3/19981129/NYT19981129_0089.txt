By the time Mark Porter is finished carving up one of his gators, 
there's nothing left but the fat and the guts, and if anyone can come 
up with a way to sell those he'd be eager to hear about it. Porter, 
an East Texas refinery worker and part-time swamp rat, has 3,100 alligators 
at the moment swishing around ominously in the dark, vaporous, mosquito-filled 
building behind his bayou-side home. Standing there in his rubber 
boots, gunky blue jeans, Great Texas Alligator Round-up T-shirt and 
a cap reading ``Porter's Gator Processing &AMP; Gator Farm,'' Porter, 
44, is at one end of a food chain that extends from these soggy Gulf 
Coast flats into gourmet food shops and high-end restaurants around 
the world. On top of that, the highly prized skins are sent to Italy 
and Singapore to be turned into everything from boots to purses to 
motorcycle seats. He pretty much learned the business as he went along, 
beginning five years ago when he had an epiphany at the annual Gator 
Round-up. All the hunters, including him, were pulling their prehistoric 
monsters out of the dank bayous and selling them to processors from 
nearby Louisiana, the epicenter of the U.S. gator-processing industry. 
``I thought, hey, there must be some money to be made if these guys 
are driving all the way over from Louisiana,'' Porter said. He visited 
a few alligator farms, tried to drink in the details of how it was 
done and started up from scratch. When he noticed that refrigerated 
air seemed to kill the animals, he would pile them up in his walk-in 
refrigerator and skin them when they stopped moving. Only later did 
he realize that they were not dead, but dormant, and he was skinning 
them alive. ``Now we just hit them on the head with a baseball bat,'' 
he said. He is one of only five alligator farmers in Texas, compared 
with dozens in Louisiana, including some with as many as 100,000 gators. 
His farm is small, but he contemplates adding new buildings and gradually 
increasing his stock to 10,000. At the moment, Porter has only one 
full-time worker, though he can usually hire a dozen oystermen to 
help during the September hunting season when he processes not only 
his own farm-raised gators but the bigger ones brought in by hunters. 
Anahuac, a town of slightly under 2,000 not far from where the perennially 
flooding Trinity River seeps into Galveston Bay, has a bit of a gator 
fetish. There's a Gator Motel and a Gator Bar, with a big, grinning 
``Gator Love'' mural on its roadside face, and the annual Gatorfest 
is held not far away near a gator-filled national wildlife refuge. 
``I guess I should warn you,'' Porter said while pausing at the door 
to his gator building. ``There may be a little odor in here. And mosquitoes.'' 
An embracing fog of rot and reptile reached out of the darkness and 
pulled him inside, where hissing mosquitoes appeared like mud flecks 
on every inch of exposed skin. A pair of angry eyes peered up from 
a tangle of tails in one of the dark ponds. ``I'm fixing to hammer 
these guys right after Christmas,'' Porter said. After the coup de 
grace, Porter takes the bodies to his workshop and chills them overnight. 
``Makes it easier to skin,'' he said. Then, they are stretched across 
a skinning table and he goes to work with knives, skinning even a 
big gator in under 15 minutes. ``The meat goes one way and the skins 
goes the other,'' he said. Even the heads are saved now, boiled and 
shellacked and sold as ornaments in the United States and around the 
world. He recently found a new market in Japan and China for the gall 
bladders, green and slimy, which are sunk in a glass of cognac and 
swallowed. It's humid, hot and dark inside the building that holds 
Porter's gator ponds. He keeps it hot because the gators like it hot 
and dark, stopping them from glowering at one another and picking 
fights. For Porter, there's nothing worse than a chipped hide. When 
he first started, leather was his only business. ``We just tossed 
the meat away,'' he said. But a steadily growing market for alligator 
meat, in the United States and around the world, led him to invest 
in freezers and go into the food business. Meat from farm-raised gators, 
which are younger and haven't been out in the swamp eating rotten, 
dead things, is more highly prized. The underside of the tail provides 
the sweetest meat, though Asian chefs have begun buying the four legs 
whole, with the bone in, like baby dinosaur drumsticks. ``You put 
one on a plate and it looks like the biggest frog leg you've ever 
seen,'' Porter said. He sells his meat for about $5 a pound. The gall 
bladders are $2 a piece, cognac not included. Larry Perez, who runs 
the Butcher Shoppe in Houston's tony western suburbs, said he sold 
25 pounds to 30 pounds of alligator meat every month for $12.99 a 
pound; boneless alligator sirloin, long strips of tail meat, even 
alligator sausage. Most of his customers have tasted alligator at 
a restaurant, liked it, and want to try cooking it. ``It's not something 
everybody eats every day, but it's starting to get popular,'' he said. 
Porter prefers to simply grill the meat or roll it in pancake mix 
(``the raw powder, not the batter'') and deep fry it in peanut oil. 
Carl Walker, the executive chef at Brennan's Restaurant on the edge 
of downtown Houston, takes a grander approach. ``When I've cooked 
it, I generally cut it into scallops and pound that out to tenderize 
it and then you can pan saute it or top it with anything,'' Walker 
said. ``You might top it with crawfish and crabmeat or a Creole meuniere 
sauce.'' Porter said the standard response to the inevitable question 
is: kind of like chicken. But there's a fishy taste, too, he said. 
``It's not really like chicken,'' Walker said. ``I don't know that 
I have anything to really compare it to. I don't know if you would 
say like turtle meat. I guess is just tastes like alligator.''
