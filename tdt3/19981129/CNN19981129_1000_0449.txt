Britain and Chile are denying London newspaper reports they have reached 
a Deal that would send former Chilean dictator augusto Pinochet home 
to stand trial. He's charged with human rights abuses during his 17-year 
regime in Chile. Chilean officials say they are not negotiating any 
deals and British officials say Pinochet's legal status hasn't changed 
from last week. Spanish authorities want to try Pinochet for genocide, 
torture and terrorism.
