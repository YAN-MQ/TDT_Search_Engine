The deadliest hurricane season in more than two centuries ends tomorrow. 
Hurricane Mitch alone killed more than 10,000 people. Flooding is 
still a threat. Thousands of people in Honduras are under orders this 
weekend to evacuate if more rains come. But a bigger threat is disease. 
ABC's Mike Von Fremd has that story. The most immediate worry is the 
water. Health officials are still removing decomposing animals and 
bodies along the riverbanks, and this is water that people are bathing 
in. These are the breeding grounds of disease. We got malaria to worry 
about. We got cholera to worry about. We got dengue fever. There is 
also concern about the air, which is now filled with dust particles 
and mold that are also carrying disease. Jorge mariela's three children 
are sick and having trouble breathing. They are waiting to be treated 
in this old Catholic church, because the clinic two blocks away washed 
into the river. All across this country, medical teams are providing 
care in unusual locations, because so many hospitals and clinics were 
destroyed, and those still standing are overwhelmed. A team of Cuban 
specialists sent by Fidel Castro converted this abandoned market into 
a clinic. The biggest problem is diarrhea and skin disease. In a soccer 
field next to a refugee center, French teams have set up medical tents. 
The problem here is highly contagious eye infections. Everywhere, 
people are still recovering from serious injuries. Back at the church, 
Jorge mariela did get some medicine for his children's respiratory 
infections, but it may not be enough. His home was washed away, and 
they are sleeping in a filthy storage room, accessible only through 
a window. He makes his children laugh, and like so many here, they 
live by an old honduran saying. A mal tiempo Buena cara. In bad times, 
a good face. Mike Von Fremd, ABC News, tegucigalpa.
