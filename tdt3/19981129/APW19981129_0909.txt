Foreign Minister Raphael Fletcher resigned Sunday, citing differences 
with Prime Minister Keith Mitchell over an audit of government finances. 
``This is something that grows, and there comes a time when you feel 
you cannot take any more. I reached that point,'' Fletcher told a 
local radio station. Fletcher said he would join another defector, 
Grace Duncan, in the opposition Grenada United Labor Party, robbing 
Mitchell's New National Party of its majority when the House of Representatives 
convenes on Friday. Duncan was banished from the Cabinet in 1997 over 
a disagreement with Mitchell. The change reverses the 9-6 majority 
of the New National Party government to 8-7 in favor of the opposition. 
It also leaves a gaping hole in the Cabinet. In addition to the foreign 
ministry, Fletcher oversaw the government's legal affairs and local 
government ministries, was leader of government business in the House 
of Representatives and held the unofficial post of deputy prime minister. 
NNP leaders planned a meeting late Sunday to discuss the changes. 
They would not comment Sunday afternoon. Fletcher said he recently 
had asked Mitchell about an audit of the Ministry of Communications 
and Works, which is headed by a longtime friend of Mitchell, Gregory 
Bowen. The audit found cost overruns and payment of ``exorbitant'' 
salaries and fees for work on some projects where some government 
friends and supporters were hired. ``When I asked the question of 
the prime minister, he said that was a private matter. It cannot be 
a private matter when the issue surrounds the actions of government,'' 
Fletcher said. The defections were welcomed by members of the Grenada 
United Labor Party and the Democratic Labor Party.
