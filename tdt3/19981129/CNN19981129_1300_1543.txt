Fruitcakes are often fodder for holiday jokes. But while some find 
the annual treats a bit ridiculous, others think they're simply sublime, 
especially when they come from a monastery. Gina London reports. Nestled 
beneath Virginia's blue Ridge mountains is the holy cross abbey. Where 
27 trappist monks live in idyllic retreat. Our life is primarily one 
of commitment to Christ and a surrender of our lives to God. While 
the mission of the monks here is certainly to serve God, they do have 
to earn a living. And this year, they've baked 24,000 fruitcakes. 
The tradition began in 1990. Baking is completed by September. Then 
each fruitcake is wrapped and awaits shipping. Do you want that sent 
now? Phone calls and mail order forms used to be the Norm here at 
the abbey. But now -- yes, even at a monastery -- the Internet. The 
monks decided they needed a page on the web. You know, we're trying 
to get the best bang for our Buck, like everybody else. And I know 
it sounds kind of cute, coming from a monk. Really, they don't look 
much different from other fruitcakes, and the ingredients sound pretty 
straightforward. The class a fruit goes in there, and there are red 
cherries and green cherries. And there are walnuts and other nuts 
on the top. But apparently, one taste, and you're a believer. When 
they eat it, they're hooked on it, and they continue to order. And 
each year, the number of believers increases. I think it's great. 
And I like it better than the ones that the other monasteries make. 
You could say they're blessed. In berryville, Virginia, I'm Gina London,
