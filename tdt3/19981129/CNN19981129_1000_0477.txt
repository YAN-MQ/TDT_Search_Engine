A Seattle television station says police have identified the shooter 
in friday's bus crash. The unconfirmed report describes the gunman 
as an unemployed, well-behaved man who visited a homeless Shelter. 
Three people eventually died after a city bus plunged 50 feet off 
a bridge after its driver was shot. Police are still looking for a 
motive for the attack, but say the shooting may have been a murder-suicide. 
As of this time, we do not have information regarding the catalyst 
for this incident. It's a real tragedy. We don't know at this point 
why he fired at the bus driver or what started that process. We are 
still looking for those answers. 19 passengers remain hospitalized. 
One is in critical condition.
