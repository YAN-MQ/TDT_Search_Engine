Hundreds of mourners joined the funeral Sunday of a teen-aged disc 
jockey who died in a bomb explosion, turning his burial into a protest 
against terrorism. Carrying placards and wearing black arm bands, 
more than 1,000 Roman Catholic priests, relatives and friends marched 
three kilometers (1.8 miles) through downtown Dipolog City in Zamboanga 
del Norte province before heading for a cemetery for the burial of 
Dominic Acupiado. Several people have been killed and scores wounded 
in a wave of bomb explosions in passenger buses in Dipolog and other 
key southern cities. Police suspect Muslim rebels extorting money 
from bus companies are behind the bombings. ``Terrorism shouldn't 
be left for authorities to check alone. We'll help them,'' said the 
Rev. Enrico Montano, who led the protesters. Policemen in patrol cars 
secured the protesters during the march. Acupiado was traveling on 
a bus enroute from Dipolog to Cagayan de Oro City on Nov. 18 when 
a homemade bomb, planted near the gasoline tank, went off inside the 
bus, injuring and later killing him and the driver. An hour before 
the blast, another bomb exploded in a bus terminal in Dipolog, killing 
a child and injuring 13 other people. Last October, a homemade bomb 
also exploded in a passenger bus in the city, killing a pregnant woman 
and injuring 24 others, police said. Police have secured passenger 
bus and jeep terminals to deter more bombings. Plainclothes policemen 
also regularly ride on buses, local officials said. Dipolog is about 
275 kilometers (170 miles) south of Manila. Separatist Muslim guerrillas 
are active in Zamboanga del Norte province.
