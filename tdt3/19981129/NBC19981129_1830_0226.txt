Also in Washington, a massive effort to raise money for the Palestinian 
authority. Lynn leader Yasser Arafat is there. A number of nations 
have sent diplomats to meet him and to make donations they believe 
will aid the Middle East peace process. Arafat came to Washington 
at the invitation of President Clinton to lead what amounts to a huge 
international Palestinian pledge drive. Foreign ministers and other 
senior officials from 45 countries are here to take part in tomorrow's 
donor conference where they hope to raise as much as $3 billion to 
shore up the Palestinian economy. Arafat met today with commerce secretary 
Bill Daley and a group of American businessman or urge more U.S. trade 
and investments. Any amount that comes from the U.S. will be grateful, 
and we thank them for it. The promise of financial aid helped forge 
last month's agreement between Arafat and Israeli prime minister Netanyahu 
to continue the Middle East peace process with Israel withdrawing 
from more of the land it occupies on the West Bank. If Israel was 
going to have security, you needed to develop the Palestinian economy 
so that the Palestinians could see that they were getting something 
for this peace progress which they have entered into. Unless there's 
a peace dividend, there's no way that they're going to continue with 
the talks. The most recent peace dividend for the Palestinians -- 
the opening of an international airport in the Gaza strip. Another 
dividend -- President Clinton's promised visit there next month to 
address the Palestinian parliament. Arafat needs billions of dollars 
to build infrastructure -- water projects, roads, sewers, schools 
and hospitals. I think the donors conference is in order to alleviate 
some of the pain that Palestinian people suffer. More than half of 
the West Bank Palestinian towns don't have water piped into their 
homes. Per capita income dropped last year by 30%. With few natural 
resources and no export base, most of the money in palestinian government 
coffers comes from aid. And Arafat's own auditors say millions of 
dollars have been lost through corruption and mismanagement, a problem 
the donor countries hope to fix with better oversight controls. When 
President Clinton addresses the Palestinian donors conference tomorrow, 
aides say he will warn that the current peace in the Middle East is 
fragile, in danger and in immediate need of international economic 
support. John Palmer, NBC news, at the White House.
