Four attacks in the western mountains of Algeria left seven people 
dead, newspapers and officials said Sunday, while security forces 
sought to prevent a new wave of violence during the holy month of 
Ramadan. There was no immediate claim of responsibility for the attacks, 
but suspicion fell on Muslim militants waging a nearly 7-year-old 
insurgency against the military-backed government. Militants posing 
as police at a mountain roadblock near Ain Defla, 150 kms (90 miles) 
west of Algiers, opened fire on a vehicle Saturday, killing two people, 
the independent El Watan said. At another fake police roadblock, gunmen 
shot and killed a civilian and a member of a local civil defense group 
overnight Friday near Khemis Miliana, 110 kms (70 miles) southwest 
of Algiers, hospital officials said on customary anonymity. The gunmen 
beheaded the civil defense member after killing him in a shootout, 
the officials said. Two shepherds kidnapped last week were found hanged 
with their throats slit in a farm near the town of Ain el Hadjar near 
Saida, 400 kms (240 miles) southwest of Algiers, the independent daily 
La Tribune reported. In the same area, an armed group abducted two 
other people over night Thursday, the paper said. A bomb Friday, planted 
in a roadway near the mountain town of Chlef, 110 kms (70 miles) west 
of Algiers, exploded under a horse-drawn cart carrying a couple and 
their daughter, El Watan said. The blast killed the father and seriously 
injured the mother and child, hospital sources said. Three days earlier, 
a similar blast in the same area had killed two people and injured 
two others. Meanwhile, security forces broke up a ring of about a 
dozen hospital workers in the eastern town of Constantine who were 
providing militants with medicine and transport, El Watan said. During 
an offensive over the past several months, the army has encircled 
and attacked militant strongholds. Militant attacks have waned, though 
authorities were bracing for the holy month of Ramadan that begins 
in mid-December. In past years, the insurgency has flared up during 
that period. More than 75,000 people have died since the government 
canceled January 1992 elections the Islamic Salvation Front was expected 
to win amid voter anger with high unemployment and corruption in this 
petroleum-rich North African nation.
