After a lagging start to the country's first voter registration drive, 
officials on Sunday said they were pleased that the pace picked up 
over the weekend. About one quarter _ or 3 million _ of 12.7 million 
eligible voters in five northern provinces had registered since Friday, 
officials of the Independent Electoral Commission estimated. ``It 
was not a bad result. These figures are a cause for satisfaction,'' 
said commission Chairman Johann Kriegler. Another 12 million voters 
in four other provinces will have the chance to register over three 
days starting on Thursday. Original plans to register the whole country 
over one three-day period were scrapped because of logistical problems. 
The creation of a national voters' roll, mandated by South Africa's 
post-apartheid constitution, is an important step to the country's 
full transition to democracy. Lack of staff, confusion over where 
voters should register and failure of some registering stations to 
open have thrown stumbling blocks and drawn criticism from opposition 
parties, including the country's former apartheid ruling party, the 
National Party. Even President Nelson Mandela and Deputy President 
Thabo Mbeki, who is likely to succeed Mandela in next year's elections, 
were first given the wrong polling stations for their registration. 
Mbeki returned Sunday from a conference in Paris and registered in 
Pretoria at the right place. The pace picked up through the weekend, 
after disappointment over the small number _ 235,000 people _ who 
registered by late Friday, when only 80 percent of the registration 
stations had opened. By Sunday, all but 129 of 6,147 registration 
stations had opened. ``This is the spirit we need to strengthen our 
democracy,'' the electoral commission said. About 1.25 million names 
had reached commission headquarters via computer by Sunday afternoon. 
The commission expected at least 3 million names to be tallied by 
Thursday. The IEC thanked the people of South Africa for their patience 
and for giving the commission ``the opportunity to cut its teeth'' 
over the weekend. In the country's first all-race balloting in 1994 
that ended apartheid, no registration was necessary and voters could 
vote anywhere as part of a strategy to defuse pre-election tension. 
The commission pointed out that there had been no violence during 
the current registration. No date has been set yet for the 1999 election, 
the first since the 1994 vote. A second round of registration will 
follow in January and February.
