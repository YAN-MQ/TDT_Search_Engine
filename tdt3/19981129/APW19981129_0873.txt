The financial turbulence in Asia prompted banks to withdraw dlrs 52 
billion in funds from the region in the first six months of the year, 
according to a international central bankers' report. Despite unease 
about the situation in Russia, commercial banks continued to pump 
more money into the country until June, but then backed off, said 
the Bank for International Settlements. The survey published Sunday 
said commercial banks had far more total assets at risk in Asia and 
Latin America than in Russia. ``When allowance is made for the high 
proportion of officially guaranteed claims on Russia, the total amount 
at risk for creditor banks in the region pales in comparison with 
that in Asia and Latin America,'' the BIS said in its consolidated 
international banking statistics for the end of June 1998. The Basel-based 
BIS is regarded as the central banker for central banks. Cross-border 
claims in Asian countries totalled dlrs 234.8 billion at the end of 
June, down from dlrs 378.7 billion at the end of 1997. ``Financial 
turbulence in the first half of 1998 was associated with a massive 
withdrawal of international banking funds from emerging countries 
in Asia,'' it said. ``The retreat encompassed all major Asian borrowing 
countries and brought the outstanding claims of BIS reporting banks 
on Korea and Thailand back to their 1994-95 levels,'' the report said. 
Commercial banks lent dlrs 15.6 billion in new money to Latin America 
in the first three months _ dlrs 9.6 billion of it going to Brazil. 
But then this this dried up as jitters about the Asian crisis spread 
to other parts of the world. The BIS reiterated its concerns about 
the lack of global financial checks. It spoke of the ``herd'' phenonemon 
whereby banks and other financial market players increasingly followed 
each other. European banks were increasingly important sources of 
credit, it said. Germany banks, for instance, accounted for 17 percent 
of international loans, challenging the traditional dominance of Japanese 
banks with a 19 percent share.
