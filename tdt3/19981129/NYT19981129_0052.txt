NATIONAL FORECAST Windswept rain will lash the Oregon to central California 
coast early Monday as a potent Pacific front arrives. Wind gusts over 
50 miles an hour will be common near the coast and in the mountains 
especially during the morning and midday over northern and central 
California. Snow will fall in the mountains at elevations over 5000 
feet in the morning. Snow levels will lower to 3,000 feet in the afternoon 
as the cold front sweeps inland. Periods of rain will persist throughout 
the day, but the precipitation will become intermittent in the afternoon. 
The rain will spread into southern California late Monday. Farther 
north, patchy rain and mountain snow will prevail from northern Oregon 
and Washington to western Montana. Most of the eastern Rockies and 
Plains will not be as mild as recent days, but temperatures will remain 
above the seasonal average. Clouds will linger early Monday in the 
eastern Plains. Otherwise, ample sunshine will prevail. A cold front 
surrounded by showers will move across the central Great Lakes and 
Ohio Valley. In the wake of the front, cooler and drier air will spread 
into the northern Mississippi valley. Near record warmth will cover 
parts of the interior Northeast and Middle Atlantic States. Balmy 
breezes from the southwest will average 10 to 20 miles an hour. Morning 
clouds near the southern New England coast will erode as milder air 
arrives. Clouds and some patchy rain and sleet will plague northernmost 
New England where the warm air rises over cool air across the region. 
FOCUS: Slow to Snow In western New York, where fierce snow squalls 
are common in November, there has been a slow start to the snowy season. 
Buffalo will be in the balmy 60s on Monday, insuring its least snowy 
November in 114 years of records with 0.2 inches. Early snow in Buffalo 
is enhanced when cold air sweeps from Canada gathering moisture as 
it crosses the Great Lakes. This autumn, Canada has been mild, eliminating 
the spark that ignites squalls. History suggests the dearth of snow 
in Buffalo will continue. Of the 12 seasons with less than an inch 
of snow through November, only one had above normal snowfall.
