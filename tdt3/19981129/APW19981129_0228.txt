Stuart Sutherland, a British psychologist who turned his own experience 
of manic depression into his best known work, has died. He was 71. 
Sutherland died Nov. 8 at home in Brighton, the south England town 
where in 1964 he founded the internationally respected Laboratory 
of Experimental Psychology at the University of Sussex. News reports 
said he died from a heart attack. Sutherland, who graduated from Cambridge 
University with degrees in classics and psychology, wrote a string 
of academically impressive publications. But it was his book ``Breakdown,'' 
first published in 1976, that had the widest influence. The frank 
account of his illness, which eventually was successfully treated 
with the drug lithium, was the inspiration for a play, ``Melon,'' 
by Simon Gray, which ran in London's West End. The work also broke 
new ground for airing personal agony. Sutherland described how his 
illness developed a pattern of being depressed every summer, when 
he could do nothing, followed by hypomania each winter, when he felt 
tremendous, but endangered his health and home life with wildly optimistic 
and extravagant behavior. He would arrive home, for example, with 
cases of expensive champagne. He said his family told him they found 
him more tolerable when depressed than when hypomanic. ``At least 
I would listen to others in my depressions, even if I did not have 
much to say myself, while the absolute conviction of being right and 
the egocentricity induced by hypomania made it almost intolerable 
for others,'' wrote Sutherland. Norman Stuart Sutherland, who was 
born March 26, 1927, studied zoology for a doctorate and his work 
``Shape Discrimination in Animals,'' published 1959 by Britain's Experimental 
Psychology Society led to an appointment at Oxford University. He 
was a visiting professor at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology 
in the early 60s before founding the unit at Sussex University where 
he assembled a remarkable team of scientists. His publications included 
the ``Macmillan Dictionary of Psychology'' and ``Irrationality: The 
Enemy Within,'' as well as a novel, ``Men Change Too.'' In 1966 he 
married Josie Fogden, who survives him with their two daughters.
