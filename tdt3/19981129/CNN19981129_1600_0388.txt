Police won't confirm it, but a Seattle TV station has identified the 
man who apparently shot and killed a bus driver, then himself, on 
Friday. The shooting caused the bus to plunge from a bridge onto an 
apartment building. Another passenger died in the crash, and 32 were 
injured. Station king says the suspect is a 43-year-old man who apparently 
spent time at a local homeless Shelter. He was regarded there as well-behaved. 
Police still have no motive for the shooting.
