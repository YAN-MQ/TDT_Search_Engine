Voters in Switzerland appear to be rejecting a clause to their constitution 
to legalize drugs. Polls published for Swiss television forecast a 
3-1 majority opposes the proposal. Under the plan, all narcotics, 
from marijuana to heroin, would have been sold at government-run outlets 
and stores. Opponents say legalizing drugs would make Switzerland 
a haven for drug addicts from all over Europe. Backers say it would 
eliminate the black market, reduce the power of the mafia, and make 
addictions easier to treat. The plan was expected to fail, but proponents 
hope a sizable losing vote will encourage Swiss lawmakers to further 
liberalize drug laws.
