Almost half of Michigan residents apparently believe Jack Kevorkian 
should be criminally charged in the death of a man who had Lou Gehrig's 
disease. That's based on a statewide survey of 300 people. Kevorkian 
was charged Wednesday with first-degree murder in the death of the 
52-year-old man, which was videotaped and aired on "60 minutes." Kevorkian 
administered the lethal drugs.
