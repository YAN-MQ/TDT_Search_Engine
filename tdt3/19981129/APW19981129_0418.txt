Iraq's state-run newspapers on Sunday accused the United States and 
the chief U.N. arms inspector of blocking a review of Iraqi weapons 
programs in order to maintain tough economic sanctions. Iraq denies 
the existence of documents that chief inspector Richard Butler says 
are related to its chemical and biological weapons program. It says 
Butler made the demand to block the comprehensive review, which Iraq 
claims would show it has eliminated its weapons of mass destruction. 
The daily Babil, owned by Iraqi leader Saddam Hussein's son Odai, 
said the documents issue ``is meant to picture Iraq as not cooperating 
with the international community.'' The comprehensive review, to be 
conducted by the U.N. Security Council, depends on Iraq's full cooperation 
with U.N. arms inspectors. The inspectors must certify Iraq has eliminated 
its lethal weapons programs before ruinous sanctions can be lifted. 
The sanctions, imposed after Iraq's 1990 invasion of Kuwait, limit 
exports of oil and have ruined Iraq's economy. Iraq promised full 
cooperation on Nov. 14, after the United States and Britain threatened 
airstrikes because Iraq had ended all cooperation with U.N. arms experts. 
Since then Iraq has gone out of its way to show it is cooperating. 
On Sunday, the Iraqi New Agency quoted the head of the country's monitoring 
directorate a saying U.N. inspection teams carried out 15 ``announced 
and surprise visits'' the day before. The visits were carried out 
by 12 inspection teams using helicopters in some work, INA quoted 
Hussam Mohammed Amin as saying. Amin's group provides the Iraqi escorts 
for U.N. teams on their visits to the field. Amin also was quoted 
as saying a team of nuclear inspectors collected soil samples from 
12 sites around Baghdad. He told INA that a team of chemical inspectors 
completed its work and left Iraq. U.N. officials in Baghdad could 
not be immediately reached about Amin's report, but they rarely comment 
on details of the inspections. A front-page editorial in the daily 
Al-Thawra also said the documents demanded by Butler were an impediment 
to the Security Council's promised review. The paper of the ruling 
Baath Party said that after U.N. inspectors failed to find weapons 
that ``do not exist,'' Butler has ``started demanding documents which 
also do not exist or have no relations to the disarmament procedures.'' 
After Butler asked for a dozen documents on Iraqi weapons earlier 
this month, Iraq said all relevant papers in its possession had been 
turned over.
