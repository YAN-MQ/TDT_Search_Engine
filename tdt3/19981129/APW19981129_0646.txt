Britain denied Sunday that it is negotiating a deal to free Gen. Augusto 
Pinochet in return for a pledge from Chile to strip the former dictator 
of immunity and make him stand trial at home on charges of genocide 
and torture. However, the tug-of-war over 83-year-old Pinochet intensified 
with human rights activists dismissing as a ``cruel joke'' on victims 
the virtual pledges by Chilean Foreign Minister Jose Miguel Insulza 
to have general tried. A spokesman for Home Secretary Jack Straw, 
who has until Dec. 11 to decide whether to block proceedings to extradite 
Pinochet to Spain, said the decision would be based on judicial, not 
political grounds. ``We are not negotiating a deal,'' said a Home 
Office spokesman, speaking on customary condition of anonymity. ``The 
Home Secretary will consider what decision he will take in his role 
as quasi-judicial arbiter under the terms of the Extradition Act.'' 
Two British newspapers, The Sunday Times and The Observer, reported 
Sunday that Britain and Chile are close to a compromise deal. The 
argument and conflicting reports underlined the dilemma for Straw 
since a ruling last week by Britain's highest court, the House of 
Lords, that Pinochet has no immunity from arrest. He was arrested 
Oct. 16 on a Spanish warrant during a regular visit to London. A Chilean
