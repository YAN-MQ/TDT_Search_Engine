A new medical specialty is born. While other specialties help patients 
to live, this one helps them die. Fortunately, or unfortunately, depending 
on one's point of view, this is fiction and not reality _ yet. ``Lethal 
Dose,'' a powerhouse of a novel by Kentucky surgeon Steven Snodgrass, 
tells a story of the world's first fellowship program to train physicians 
in euthanasia. One of the program's three fellows is Jeff Taylor, 
who has given up his surgical career because he damaged his hand in 
a ski accident. Predictably, the groundbreaking program at Northwest 
Regional's Euthanasia Center becomes a lightning rod for controversy. 
Demonstrators chant outside the hospital, ``Stop the murder!'' Jeff's 
picture, euthanizing his first patient, who can not move or speak, 
ends up in a supermarket tabloid with a headline: ``Mercy killer doc 
murders mute martyr!'' And there are bomb threats from a psychotic 
priest who believes it's his mission to stop euthanasists as the ``Messenger 
of the Almighty.'' The problems do not come only from the outside. 
Since Jeff and his two colleagues are working uncharted territory, 
they face a gamut of questions to which there are no easy answers. 
One of their patients wakes up from a coma just a couple of hours 
before they are ready to euthanize him. How can they make sure that 
they aren't killing patients prematurely? Then there's an AIDS patient 
who begs them to be put to death because, he says, he knows what the 
disease is going to do to him. The problem is that he looks very healthy 
at present. Should they still grant his wishes and kill him? ``Lethal 
Dose'' moves fast, and has a lot of action, but its true value lies 
in the author's realistic and insightful portrayals of doctors, patients 
and anti-euthanasia activists caught in the middle of a revolutionary 
moment in history. This book is more than just a well-done medical 
thriller. It's a valuable source material for anyone who wants to 
explore euthanasia and physicians' roles in it. ___ ``Lethal Dose'' 
was published by ICAM. dlrs 22.95.
