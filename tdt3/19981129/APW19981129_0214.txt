Dutch Crown Prince Willem-Alexander, a last-minute replacement for 
his mother Queen Beatrix, ended a brief visit to Russia Sunday. The 
prince arrived in St. Petersburg Saturday for the presentation of 
two cultural projects at the Hermitage museum, the ITAR-Tass news 
agency reported. Before leaving for the Netherlands, the prince placed 
flowers at the grave of Galina Starovoitova, the member of parliament 
who was gunned down in St. Petersburg on Nov. 20. The prince's parents, 
Queen Beatrix and her husband Claus, were scheduled to come to Russia 
for a state visit, but Kremlin officials asked them to postpone their 
journey, which was to include a meeting with President Boris Yeltsin, 
to give the ailing president time to recuperate from pneumonia.
