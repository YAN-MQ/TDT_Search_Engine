Hannu Manninen of Finland landed a 134-meter jump and solidified his 
World Cup lead on Sunday with a victory in a Nordic combined sprint. 
Manninen started four seconds behind jump portion winner Bjarte Engen 
Vik of Norway, who won Saturday's conventional World Cup event, but 
finished the 7.5-kilometer cross-country course in 18 minutes, 50.4 
seconds, 35.3 seconds ahead of his closest rival. ``Today was a very 
good day, and I had good skies,'' Manninen told Norwegian TV station 
NRK. The 20-year old Finn had the fourth longest jump ever on the 
Lysgardsbakken K120 hill, but had to start behind Engen Vik. Manninen 
quickly passed Engen Vik at the start, and they followed each other 
for much of the race. However, Manninen's slowly pulled away and Austrian 
Felix Gottwald, who started 12th after the ski jumping following a 
125-meter effort, passed Engen Vik and finished second. Engen Vik 
finished 46.6 seconds behind Manninen in third. Samppa Lajunen of 
Finland was fourth 56.6 seconds behind, with American Todd Lodwick 
fifth, 1 minute, 13.7 seconds behind Manninen.
