Saturday was the second day of the traditional holiday shopping season, 
and retailers say buyers did not disappoint. The telecheck retail 
index says sales Friday were more than 4% higher than on the same 
day last year. Telecheck measures the volume of authorized checks 
written by consumers. Across the United States, the midwest showed 
the biggest jump in sales, followed by the southeast. Analysts say 
the growth is due to the healthy economy and increased consumer confidence.
