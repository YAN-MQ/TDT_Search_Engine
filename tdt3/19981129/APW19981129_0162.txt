Women have clearly suffered from the conflict in Kosovo. But they 
may also have achieved something of an emancipation, forced by circumstances 
to take on responsibilities once reserved for men. The traditional 
patriarchal society among ethnic Albanians, who make up 90 percent 
of the people in this poor southern province of Serbia, was showing 
cracks even before hostilities broke out with Serbian security forces. 
Now, with many of the men off in the rebel Kosovo Liberation Army 
or in exile abroad, Albanian women find themselves in charge, and 
often the men don't like it. One result has been a surge in domestic 
violence, says Dr. Vjosa Dobruna, a pediatrician who founded the Center 
for Protection of Women and Children in Pristina, the provincial capital. 
With the help of a network of women around the province, Dobruna is 
studying whether women see themselves as mere victims of the struggle 
for independence by ethnic Albanians or whether they also have benefited 
from their changed roles. ``Then we hope to find out what these women 
really want, as opposed to what we think they want,'' Dobruna says 
in an interview at her poorly heated center, chair pressed close to 
an electric heater, hot cup of coffee in her hands. Albanian society 
has been changing since 1989, starting when Serbia ended Kosovo's 
autonomy and many of the men left in search of jobs. It changed further 
with the beginning of open warfare last February. Rural Albanian women 
are largely uneducated. Though respected in a traditional way, they 
never had decision-making roles in family or society. With the men 
working abroad, or off fighting, the women found themselves with new 
responsibilities. And when the Serbs cracked down, destroying homes 
and entire villages, those obligations became heavier. ``They take 
care of the children, the family finances, running the farms,'' Dobruna 
says. ``In some cases there are elderly people in the house.'' When 
the men come back, on annual visits from jobs abroad or quick stops 
from the battlefield, many don't like what they find and physical 
abuse is often the result, the doctor adds. ``The men came home to 
an entirely different situation. They were no longer head of the household. 
Somebody else was making decisions. There was a huge change in attitude 
and men just couldn't cope with it,'' she says. Dobruna interrupts 
the interview to meet with two women who have come to the center with 
newborn babies. She examines the children and questions the mothers 
for her survey. Both women, after 5{ months of wandering from the 
destroyed village of Iglarevo, have made their way to Pristina. Their 
husbands are somewhere in the hills with rebels. After checking the 
babies, Dobruna counsels the young mothers and turns them over to 
a nutrition specialist. ``We started a workshop on how to stop domestic 
violence,'' she continues, back in her office. ``Women became the 
victims both of outside violence and domestic violence.'' Dobruna 
hopes to open five more centers as she can find the money. That may 
not be easy. Money comes in from charities here and there _ Women 
to Women in Sweden, Crabgrass in San Francisco, several European Union 
projects _ but has never been easy to find. Dobruna says the first 
step in educating women is teaching them they are masters of their 
bodies, through seminars titled ``My Body, My Rights.'' Then it's 
on to issues such as sexually transmitted diseases and family planning. 
Beyond sexual freedom, learning about contraception and deciding for 
themselves when they will have babies, these women also must be taught 
about earning their own incomes, that their work has value and should 
be paid, the doctor says. Some have been given sewing machines and 
now can sell what they make. If they have chickens, they should be 
able to keep some of the money generated from the meat and eggs, Dobruna 
says.
