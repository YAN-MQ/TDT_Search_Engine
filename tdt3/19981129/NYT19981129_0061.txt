A meeting between Israeli and Palestinian negotiators on carrying 
out their latest accord ended in a dispute Sunday over Israel's insistence 
on freeing common criminals as part of the prisoner releases required 
by the agreement. Under the Israeli-Palestinian accord reached last 
month with U.S. mediation at Wye River, Md., Israel agreed to a phased 
release of 750 Palestinian prisoners. But out of 250 prisoners released 
this month, 150 were common criminals and other offenders, including 
car thieves and laborers caught in Israel without permits. ``We had 
a major crisis on this issue,'' said Saeb Erakat, the chief Palestinian 
negotiator, after a meeting in Jericho with Danny Naveh, the Israeli 
Cabinet secretary. ``I asked the Israeli government not to carry out 
any further step unless we agree on the criteria and the names. We 
did not go to Wye to discuss the release of car thieves. I have asked 
the Americans to intervene.'' Palestinian officials contend that all 
750 prisoners to be freed were supposed to have been people jailed 
for anti-Israeli violence or political activity. Israeli officials 
say that they agreed to release only 200 such prisoners, those ``who 
have no blood on their hands.'' Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu 
asserted Sunday that he had ``not the slightest intention of freeing 
murderers or Hamas men.'' The release of prisoners has drawn criticism 
in Israel from the political right, including some relatives of victims 
of terrorist attacks. The issue is also an emotional one among Palestinians 
because nearly every family has a relative in Israeli jails. The failure 
to secure the release of more prisoners deemed political has set off 
a hunger strike in some jails and a wave of protests by relatives 
of inmates, who accuse the Palestinian leadership of selling them 
out. In East Jerusalem on Saturday, dozens of Palestinian demonstrators 
were injured when Israeli riot police fired rubber bullets to disperse 
a crowd that attacked them with stones. Relatives of prisoners also 
demonstrated at the inauguration of the new Palestinian airport in 
the Gaza Strip last Tuesday, waving black flags. Hisham Abdul Razek, 
a Palestinian cabinet member who is responsible for the prisoners 
issue, said that prisoner releases, especially of people jailed before 
the Israeli-Palestinian accords, were supposed to have been part of 
the process of mutual reconciliation. ``There's no logic to keeping 
our soldiers in jail when Israel is sitting down to make peace with 
the Palestinian leadership, which is responsible for the actions of 
those soldiers,'' Abdul Razek said. ``The Israelis want to say, `We're 
dictating the terms.' They're acting forcibly, not out of agreement 
in which there is reciprocity and partnership.'' The disagreement 
over the prisoners and the disputes over Israeli settlement expansion 
and the seizure of West Bank land by Israel for bypass roads led to 
a walkout by one Palestinian negotiator, Hassan Asfour, at Sunday's 
meeting in Jericho. There was more trouble between Israelis and Palestinians 
in the Gaza Strip, where Palestinian police blocked trucks carrying 
building supplies from reaching the Israeli settlement of Netzarim. 
The Palestinians maintained that building at the settlement violates 
the Israeli-Palestinian accords. The Israelis countered by blocking 
the VIP entrance to the Gaza Strip to Palestinian officials, while 
settlers from Netzarim blocked a road near their settlement to Palestinian 
traffic.
