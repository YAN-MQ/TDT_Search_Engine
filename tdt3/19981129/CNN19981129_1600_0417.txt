Almost half of Michigan residents say Jack Kevorkian should face criminal 
charges in the death of a man who had Lou Gehrig's disease. 300 people 
were surveyed for the "Detroit free press" poll. Kevorkian claims 
he administered a lethal injection to the 52-year-old man, then provided 
a videotape of his death to the CBS program "60 minutes." The retired 
pathologist was charged Wednesday with first-degree murder. His legal 
adviser says a jury will have to decide if Kevorkian committed murder 
or ended the man's suffering. I think it's different when juries consider 
it. I think juries will take a look at this case in the overall perspective. 
You know, juries always do what they think is the right thing to do. 
And when they take a look at this case, they will wonder, "was it 
the right thing that Mr. youk should have suffered, should have continued 
on and should have been the victim of a cruel disease against his 
will?" They can't argue the law because the law is pretty obvious 
and the facts are pretty clear. So I think it's quite obvious what 
they'll attempt to do is rely on the emotions and the sympathy of 
the jury in order to nullify what is clearly a Violation of the law. 
Kevorkian was also charged with criminal assistance to a suicide and 
delivery of a controlled substance.
