Forget about ``Mary Had a Little Lamb'' or ``Rockabye Baby'' _ it's 
time to get children hooked on classics, according to one music professor 
who is conducting a series of concerts for babies. The audience _ 
age limit 6 _ sit on the floor or snuggle up in their cots while musicians 
stroll around the room playing Bach, Mozart or Debussy, the Portuguese 
daily Diario de Noticias reported Sunday. The concerts, running until 
May in Leiria, 120 kilometers (75 miles) north of the capital Lisbon, 
aim to both acquaint very young children with classical music and 
test their reaction to it. ``Music is like language, sounds have a 
grammar of their own. The sooner children penetrate this world, the 
better they'll understand it,'' conductor Paulo Lameiro told the newspaper. 
Lameiro's venture _ unprecedented in Portugal _ was inspired by U.S. 
professor Edwin Gordon's experiments on music psychology, according 
to Diario de Noticias. And there is also the talent-spotting angle. 
``In each thousand children, there is one with the same aptitude as 
Mozart. The challenge is finding that child,'' Lameiro added.
