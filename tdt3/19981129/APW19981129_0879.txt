William Demas, the Caribbean Community's first secretary-general, 
has died of renal failure in a Trinidad hospital, officials confirmed 
Sunday. He was 69. The Caribbean Community secretariat said Demas 
died Saturday at St. Clair Medical Center in Port-of-Spain, where 
he was being treated for worsening diabetes. His death came only hours 
after the death of Kurleigh King, who led the trade group from 1978 
to 1983, in Iowa on Friday night. Both men helped the collection of 
English-speaking states weather recessions and build stable economies 
following centuries under British rule. Demas, a Trinidadian economist, 
headed the Caribbean Free Trade Area beginning in 1970 and was the 
first leader of the group's successor, the 15-member Caribbean Community, 
which was formed in 1973. He left the position in 1974. ``He laid 
the foundation for what the rest of us are trying to build on,'' said 
current Secretary-General Edwin Carrington, who is also from Trinidad 
and Tobago. Demas helped form the Caribbean Development Bank and was 
a former chief of Trinidad and Tobago's central bank. He wrote four 
books on Caribbean economics, dozens of journal and newspaper articles, 
and a 1965 treatise on economic integration that became a blueprint 
for many Caribbean Community policies. Demas presided over the July 
1973 signing in Trinidad of the Treaty of Chaguaramas that formed 
the Caribbean Community. Anticipating his death, Carrington and several 
longtime staffers from the Caribbean Community secretariat flew to 
Trinidad last week to visit Demas. Diplomats around the Caribbean 
expressed their condolences. ``The Caribbean has lost a son,'' said 
Clement Rohee, Guyana's foreign minister.
