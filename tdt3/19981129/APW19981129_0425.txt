Italy's Armin Zoeggeler captured Sunday's men's singles luge world 
cup race as the top Germans were shut out from the podium at their 
own track. Zoeggeler soared to his 10th career triumph at Altenberg 
in one minute, 51.484 for his two heats, edging fellow Italian Norbert 
Huber at 1:51.568 and Austria's Markus Prock at 1:51.627. But surprisingly, 
none of the usually strong Germans cracked the top six. Georg Hackl, 
three-time Olympic champion and last week's winner at Igls, Austria, 
needed a strong second heat just to finish ninth. "This course isn't 
for drivers with back problems," Hackl said as fast starters grabbed 
all the podium starts. "I started so slowly on this flat course that 
I didn't even need to bother to go downhill anymore. Besides that, 
I made two driving mistakes." Hackl, known for his driving skills 
and not his starts, had been operated on for ruptured discs two years 
ago. He bounced back to grab silver at the 1996 World Championships. 
Zoeggeler and Prock shared the lead in the overall standings with 
155 points while Hackl slipped to fourth with 139. On Saturday, German 
women swept the top four spots in women's singles while the American 
men failed to repeat their commanding performance at Igls in doubles. 
After the Americans grabbed the top two spots last week, they had 
to settle for a bronze by Chris Thorpe and Gordy Sheer. The world 
champions, Tobias and Markus Schiegl, won in 1:25.322. Germany's Barbara 
Niedernhuber shattered the course record for a heat in winning the 
women's singles. She blazed to a new record of 53.858 seconds in her 
first run, breaking the old mark of 54.78 by fellow German Sylke Otto 
by almost a second. Niedernhuber won in a a combined time of one minute 
47.823 seconds.
