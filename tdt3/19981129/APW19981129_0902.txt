Alexandra Meissnitzer completed Austria's weekend sweep, winning Sunday's 
super-giant slalom that gave her country three World Cup victories 
in as many days. Meissnitzer, who came into the race with two previous 
World Cup super-G victories, completed the slick course in 1 minute, 
17.32 seconds. It was three-of-three for Austria, after Renate Goetschl 
won both Saturday's and Friday's downhill races. Goetschl, however, 
failed to finish Sunday's super-G when she missed a gate in an area 
near the end of the course known as Double Trouble. Goetschl was ahead 
of Meissnitzer's pace at the time. In all, 12 racers didn't complete 
the race. ``I'm going to Calgary and I think maybe I'll drink a beer 
or two,'' said Meissnitzer, who finished third in Friday's downhill. 
``This week says we're a strong team. Lake Louise wasn't always a 
good slope for us. ``It just keeps getting better and better here. 
It's good for us and the whole team is confident.'' Sweden's Pernilla 
Wiberg, the first skier of the day, set a target of 1:17.75, which 
remained best until Meissnitzer came down ninth out of the gate. It 
was good enough for second, while third place went to Hilde Gerg of 
Germany with 1:17.80. Just like their male counterparts, Austria's 
women have served notice they are the team to beat this season. The 
Germans have been weakened by the loss of Katja Seizinger to injury. 
But her absence aside, the Austrians _ with slogan Power Team from 
sponsor BMW emblazoned on the back of their uniforms _ placed at least 
three racers in the top 10 in each of the three races. They have half 
of the top 10 on Friday, three on Saturday and four on Sunday. ``It 
(Power Team) is from sponsor BMW and right now it's really good we 
have it on,'' Meissnitzer said. ``It's perfect right now, but last 
year I thought maybe I should hide it.''
