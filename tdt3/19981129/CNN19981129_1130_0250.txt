Israeli troops are keeping an eye on the border with Lebanon as Israel's 
cabinet debates whether to launch air strikes. Some ministers want 
to punish Beirut for failing to control Hezbollah guerrillas who recently 
attacked Israeli positions. Army commanders oppose any further withdrawal 
from the security zone between Israel and Lebanon unless the Hezbollah 
attacks come to an end.
