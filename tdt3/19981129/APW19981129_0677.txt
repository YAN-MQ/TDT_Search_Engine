Telecom Italia may give up majority control in a deal to create a 
digital platform in Italy or exit from pay TV altogether, Italian 
press reports said over the weekend. This could mean a bigger piece 
of the digital pie for Australian media giant Rupert Murdoch. Murdoch's 
News Corp. is close to signing a digital-TV deal with Telecom Italia 
that would create a company to compete with Canal Plus' Italian unit, 
Telepiu. Murdoch said that Telecom Italia would hold 51 percent of 
the new company, his News Corp. Europe 39 percent, and France's TF1 
10 percent. But Franco Bernabe, Telecom Italia new chief executive, 
is rethinking the company's participation in digital television. He 
was meeting with Murdoch Sunday and Monday to work out a deal, reports 
said. Bernabe is considering lowering Telecom Italia's participation 
below 51 percent to lighten Telecom's financial burden. Under this 
proposal, Telecom would cede 20 percent or 30 percent to Murdoch or 
another partner, reports said. This would enable Telecom Italia to 
focus on network management and commercial activity, the Italian daily 
Corriere della Sera reported. Corriere said this could open the door 
to new partners, including Italian publisher Rizzoli-Corriere della 
Sera and Germany's privately held Wissenschaftlicher Springer Verlag. 
Telecom Italia may also get out of pay television, which has lost 
money in Italy so far. Meanwhile, reports said the government may 
limit on soccer TV rights, are seen as the key to success in Italy's 
nascent digital television market. Murdoch is negotiating for exclusive 
rights to the matches of all 38 of Italy's Serie A and B club for 
the next five years.
