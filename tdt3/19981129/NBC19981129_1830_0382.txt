When "NBC nightly news" continues in a moment -- the search for answers 
at the accident scene in Seattle. And later, in "focus," -- what hurricane 
watchers have learned from this mean season. Some things can never 
be taught... in a Classroom. You won't find them in any textbook. 
And with fixodent's long-lasting hold... you'll be ready no matter 
where the lesson takes you. For long-lasting hold... pain keeping 
you awake? Now the effeescent power of new alka-seltzer P.M. gives 
you complete relief. Alka-seltzer speed, plus a gentle sleep aid. 
The 100% solution to nighttime pain. New alka-seltzer P.M. sleep well. 
The truck. The award. The new Chevy Silverado. The motor trend truck 
of the year. It's bigger. It's more powerful. It's the truck. From 
Chevrolet. Like a rock. oh... like a rock.
