A strong earthquake shook a small and remote island in eastern Indonesia, 
killing at least five people, police said Monday. Dozens of houses 
were badly damaged and frightened residents of Mangole Island fled 
their homes when the quake struck at 10:11 p.m. (1311 GMT) Sunday. 
The number of injuries was not immediately known and the search for 
casualties was continuing on the island about 1,900 kilometers (1,180 
miles) east of Indonesia's capital, Jakarta. ``People are now gathering 
in a football field. There was a lot of panic. They are too afraid 
to sleep because there might be aftershocks,'' local police Sgt. Yopi 
Sariwating said by telephone from Mangole, where five people were 
killed when the roof of a plywood factory collapsed. Several landslides 
had been reported around the island of about 9,000 people and electricity 
had been cut, Sariwating said. The U.S. Geological Survey in Washington 
said the quake had a preliminary magnitude of 7.6 and was centered 
near or on the island of Taliabu in the Maluku Sea, about 230 miles 
(370 kilometers) south of the city of Manado on the island of Sulawesi. 
The survey issued a tsunami warning for the Western Pacific. In Japan, 
the Meteorological Agency issued a tsunami alert along the nation's 
Pacific coast stretching about 1,800 kilometers (1,116 miles) from 
Okinawa Prefecture, or state, to Tokyo. But no tsumani were observed 
in Japan and the agency lifted the alert a little more than two hours 
later. Indonesian seismologists were not immediately available for 
comment. Mangole is part of the Maluku archipelago. There were no 
immediate reports of damage on other neighboring islands. In December 
1992, a magnitude 7 earthquake caused a tsunami that killed about 
2,500 people on the nearby island of Flores. In July, more than 2,000 
people were killed when a tsunami hit the northern coast of neighboring 
Papua New Guinea. Earthquakes are common in Indonesia, which lies 
astride the so-called Pacific ``Ring of Fire'' _ a line of volcanically 
active areas that stretches from Central America to the west coast 
of North America and across to Japan, through Southeast Asia, the 
South Pacific and New Zealand.
