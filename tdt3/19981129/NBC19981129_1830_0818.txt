When "NBC nightly news" continues -- studying the storms to be better 
prepared. When your allergies are a nightmare, you need help. Not 
just any help. You need the power of zyrtec. Prescription zyrtec starts 
working fast... and keeps on working for 24 hours. And zyrtec works 
against so many allergies, from cats and dogs... to pollen and dust. 
So when allergies are a nightmare-- and when are they not? Remember... 
in studies, drowsiness was the most common side effect. Others included 
tigue and dry mouth. Most side effects were mild or moderate. Most 
people weren't bothered by them enough... to stop taking zyrtec. To 
learn more, look for... our ad in life magazine... or ask your doctor 
or pharmacist.
