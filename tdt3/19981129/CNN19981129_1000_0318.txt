House Judiciary committee lawyers working on the impeachment inquiry 
will hear from two of President Clinton's advisers this week. Deputy 
White House counsel Bruce Lindsey and Mr. Clinton's lawyer, Robert 
bennett, who represented him in the Paula Jones lawsuit, will testify 
behind closed doors. Tuesday, there will be a public hearing on the 
consequences of perjury. Republicans want the proceedings to show 
how serious perjury is. One committee member says censuring the president 
would send the wrong message. It would be worse than nothing because 
it would give the American people the appearance that we're doing 
something when in reality we're not. Censure means nothing from a 
constitutional standpoint.
