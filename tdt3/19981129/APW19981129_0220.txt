Germany could swap prisoners convicted of an Iranian-ordered murder 
in Berlin for a German sentenced to death in Iran, a German official 
was quoted Sunday as saying. Germany will not be blackmailed, but 
it could order the release of four men held for the 1992 assassination 
of Kurdish Iranian dissidents ``for overriding state interests,'' 
Gerd Poppe, the Foreign Ministry's human rights commissioner, told 
the newspaper Der Tagesspiegel. Iran has suggested in return it could 
waive the death sentence of German businessman Helmut Hofer, 56, convicted 
by a Tehran court of having sex with an unmarried Iranian woman. ``I 
don't consider political presents appropriate,'' Poppe said. ``We 
simply must find a compromise satisfactory for all involved.'' Hofer 
was sentenced in January, when German-Iranian ties were still recovering 
from strains caused by the Berlin court ruling last year implicating 
senior Iranian officials in the Berlin slayings. Kazem Darabi, an 
Iranian secret agent residing in Berlin, is serving a life sentence 
for multiple murder in the case, along with a Lebanese man. Two other 
Lebanese were convicted as accessories.
