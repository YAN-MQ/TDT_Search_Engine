Martin Schmitt of Germany has no challengers as the best ski jumper 
in the world. In the second competition for the season Sunday, he 
won his second World Cup victory with 239.9 points, 16.4 points ahead 
of Finland's Janne Ahonen. Schmitt jumped 122.5 and 123 meters in 
the K120 hill. No one else was in Schmitt's class. Ahonen's two 117.5-meter 
jumps were shorter, and his style points did not make up the loss. 
Schmitt set a new hill record in Lysgardsbakken with 136 meters Saturday, 
but the referees decided on slower speed in Sunday's competition. 
Japan's Kasuyoshi Funaki had the second longest jump with 118.5 meters 
in the final legs. Funaki is known for his classical jumping, and 
one referee gave 20.0 in style points, while the rest gave 19.5. Still, 
Funaki had to settle for third, finishing with 218.8 points after 
a first leg 109.5 meter jump. Norway's Kristian Brenden surprised 
the best jumpers in the first leg with a 118-meter jump, but placed 
fourth with 202.9 points after a final 107.7 meter jump.
