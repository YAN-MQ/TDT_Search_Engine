The international airline passengers association is offering tips 
to make holiday travel safer. It recommends travelers keep cash and 
credit cards in different places. Don't put expensive items in checked 
bags. Don't wear expensive jewelry. In the restroom, don't leave belongings 
outside stalls. Don't leave belongings on hooks. And don't leave rings 
on the sink. For more safety tips, we now go to Hal salfen of the 
international airline passengers association. Let's begin by talking 
about how thieves target travelers in the airports. Good morning, 
Judy. That's something that is very prevalent tat present time. The 
thieves work in pairs and what they'll do is shove you or push you, 
and while you turn around to find out what's happening or say sorry 
I bumped into you, someone else is grabbing your bag or your pocketbook. 
It's very prevalent in many of the larger airports. A lot of people 
are gathered and people are pushing and shoving one another. We mentioned 
some of the rest room safety tips. Are there other risk spots in airports, 
such as security checkpoints for instance? One of the things that 
happens frequently is the fact that you are visiting with friends 
and relatives who came to the airport to pick you up. While you're 
visiting and talking to them, thieves are watching the carousel and 
if there are bags left there, they will pick them up and leave with 
them and when you get there, your bags won't be there, so immediately 
you go to the airlines to tell them your bag is lost, and it's not 
really lost, someone stole it. That's a very viable thing at the present 
time. So how can travelers protect themselves on a day like today, 
or any day, when they might be in an airport? The main thing is to 
be careful of your personal property, of your bags and your pocketbook 
and also one other thing that we found recently is when you go through 
the baggage check deal, that one person will go in and then somebody 
will follow while you're checking your bags and so forth the thieves 
will come and take the bag out and get away with it. The thing to 
do is two of you going through the baggage check point is for one 
of you to go through and wait on the other side while the other one 
goes through later. It pays to pay attention, then. Thank you very 
much, of the international airline passengers association. Thank you. 
I hope everybody has a safe trip today. Thank you.
