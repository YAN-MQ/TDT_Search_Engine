College football -- southern Cal put a knot in notre dame's bowl hopes 
by stifling the ninth-ranked Irish 10-0. It's the first time the Irish 
have been shut out by USC since '92. The Irish have lost three straight 
to the Trojans. It was just so much in my mind of a team -- a team 
thing. That's what we had to do we knew we had to play our best football. 
We knew they were wounded. This is costing $10 million. That's got 
to feel good. I heard about that and, you know, I'm sorry about that, 
but, you know, it's a great win for us and that's all we care about.
