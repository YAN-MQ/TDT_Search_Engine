"The rugrats movie" is a big hit at the box office. And the man behind 
its music is enjoying a new wave of success. Anna Hovind reports. 
Mark mothersbaugh may best be known as one of the founders of the 
'80s new wave group Devo. But nowadays he is the composer of music 
for movies and TV, including the new film, "the rugrats movie." This 
world is something strange. I'm wet. I'm cold I need a change this 
world is something new to me Kids are open to instrumentations and 
this gives you a chance to stretch your repertoire. "the rugrats" 
have been around for seven seasons on TV, where the show is the highest-rated 
children's program. Mothersbaugh says the show is written in such 
a way that adults can enjoy it too. You're kind of dealing with the 
experience of growing up for, you know, for very young humans. And 
-- but as an adult, you can look at that and identify with what's 
happening in a lot of the stories. As for Devo, they still perform 
together a few times a year. We've always been together. We have a 
company where we do music for film and television and interactive 
media. And kind of not under the name Devo because people, you know, 
we want to have a wider -- you know, base to be able to write from 
as opposed to being kind of pigeon holed. Devo does perform one song 
in the film. We appear as monkeys after the circus train wrecks. We 
run into the rugrats and sing them a song. Mothersbaugh doesn't monkey 
around when it comes to his music. His company is a leader in the 
interactive entertainment field. A baby is extra fancy Anna Hovind, 
CNN, reporting.
