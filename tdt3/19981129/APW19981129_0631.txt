The first trophy of the Scottish soccer season _ the League Cup _ 
went Sunday to Rangers with new coach Dick Advocaat getting much of 
the credit. Rangers defeated St. Johnstone 2-1 at Celtic Park with 
Jorg Albertz getting the winner after Stephane Guivarc'h scored early 
for Rangers with Nick Vasovic getting St. Johnstone's goal. Rangers 
last season failed to win a trophy for the first time in recent memory 
and were also dethroned by Celtic as league champions after nine straight 
titles. Dutchman Advocaat arrived from PSV Eindhoven over the summer 
and has spent 31 million pounds (dlrs 51 million) on player transfers. 
In addition to leading the Scottish Premier League, Rangers are also 
bidding to reach the quarterfinals of Europe's UEFA Cup after a third-round, 
first-leg 1-1 draw last week against Italy's Parma.
