Only if vote totals change it looks like voters in Switzerland have 
rejected a proposal to legalize recreational use of drugs. Exit polls 
indicated voters are against it by a 3-1 majority. The measure would 
have allowed anyone 18 or older to buy any drug, from marijuana to 
heroin, after consulting with a doctor. And drugs would have been 
sold at state-run outlets or pharmacies. Backers of the proposal say 
making drugs illegal hasn't stopped the supply, but instead has created 
an illegal market with no health standards. They say if drugs were 
legal, addiction would be easier to prevent and treat. Opponents say 
Switzerland would become a safe haven for only addicts from around 
Europe.
