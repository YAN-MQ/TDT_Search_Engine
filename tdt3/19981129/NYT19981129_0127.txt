In a move that would give it a needed edge in Japan's corporate leasing 
market, GE Capital Services Corp., the huge financial services arm 
of General Electric Corp., may acquire the leasing arm of the troubled 
Long-Term Credit Bank of Japan Ltd. Although GE would not confirm 
the negotiations, which were reported in several Japanese newspapers, 
people close to the company say talks are in progress. But they say 
they believe that the $900 billion yen (about $7.3 billion) cited 
in the newspapers is more than GE is willing to pay. If it does pay 
that much, this would be largest corporate acquisition to date in 
Japan. GE Capital, whose 28 businesses include equipment rentals, 
financing and insurance, contributes about 40 percent of General Electric's 
revenue and profit. Some 30 percent of GE Capital's assets are outside 
the United States. Gary Wendt, GE Capital's chairman, has been quite 
vocal about wanting to beef up the company's ``small but solid'' presence 
in the Asia-Pacific region. GE Capital already has a sizable presence 
in life insurance and other consumer finance businesses in Japan, 
but so far has been only lightly involved in the leasing business. 
Long-Term Credit Bank's leasing arm would give GE Capital a ready-made 
platform on which to build the kind of full-service business, including 
fleet manangement and maintenance, that is its hallmark in the United 
States. ``We are definitely interested in exploring the leasing market 
in Japan,'' said Mary Horne, a spokeswoman for GE Capital. Long-Term 
Credit Bank, saddled with billions of yen worth of bad real estate 
loans, is struggling to survive. The company filed for the Japanese 
equivalent of bankruptcy reorganization in September, and was nationalized 
last month. Financial experts say that its leasing arm is sound, and 
that would make it prime fodder for GE Capital. ``We're always interested 
in healthy assets that may lack good management, marketing savvy, 
financial backing, anything we can provide,'' Ms. Horne said. ``And 
that's particularly true in markets where things may be tumultuous.'' 
There may be other rescuers in the wings for Long-Term Credit if the 
GE Capital deal falls through. Japanese newspapers reported that Sony, 
Nippon Telegraph and Telephone, and Industrial Bank of Japan are also 
interested in the leasing unit, albeit at lower prices than GE is 
said to be offering. And the Japanese papers report that other potential 
non-Japanese acquirers have expressed interest as well.
