In Rome, Pope John Paul launched the countdown to the year 2000 today 
by reviving a Catholic tradition from the middle ages. In a three-hour 
ceremony this morning, the Pope declared 2000 will be a holy year. 
During that year, Catholics will be ablto earn indulgences by doing 
good works. An indulgence eliminates punishment for sin, speeding 
entry into heaven. In the 16th century, indulgences got a bad name, 
because the church sold them. They were part of the reason Martin 
Luther broke away and formed the protestant church. But theologians 
say the 21st century indulgence is different. An indulgence in the 
way he's using it, is not as a means for gathering money for the church, 
but rather as a means of enhancing your soul. According to the papal 
edict, Catholics can earn indulgences by giving up cigarettes or alcohol 
for a day, or by visiting someone in prison or in the hospital.
