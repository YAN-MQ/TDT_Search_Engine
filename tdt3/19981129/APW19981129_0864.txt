If he could, Mark O'Meara would never let 1998 end. The U.S. Masters 
and British Open champion, who earned a career-high dlrs 1.78 million 
on the American PGA Tour and won his first two majors, picked up a 
record dlrs 430,000 with a victory in the Skins Game on Sunday. O'Meara 
clinched his first Skins title on the 16th hole of regulation, knocking 
in a 1-meter (3-foot) birdie putt worth two skins and dlrs 140,000. 
That pushed his two-day total to eight skins and dlrs 430,000 _ bettering 
the dlrs 370,000 Fuzzy Zoeller won in 1986. ``This year has been a 
tremendous year for me,'' said O'Meara, who will play two more events 
in South Africa and Australia before year's end. ``To win the Skins 
Game caps off so positively everything else that has happened to me 
this year.'' O'Meara's luck ran out when the Skins Game went to a 
playoff for the fifth consecutive year. He dropped out of contention 
for the largest skin (dlrs 270,000) with a bogey on the first playoff 
hole at Rancho La Quinta Country Club. ``I still would've liked to 
keep going and play for that super skin,'' said O'Meara, who had a 
two-day, 18-hole total of 1-over 72. Instead, he plopped down cross-legged 
on the ninth green and waited as Tom Lehman, Fred Couples and Greg 
Norman continued a Skins record six-hole playoff. Defending champion 
Lehman birdied the par-4, 400-yard (360-meter) 10th hole with a 1-meter 
(4-foot) putt to win two skins and dlrs 270,000 over Couples, whose 
birdie attempt curved around the cup. ``It seemed like it took forever,'' 
Lehman said. ``I didn't think too much about the fact there was a 
lot of money on the line. I didn't want to lose the playoff.'' Lehman 
finished second with seven skins and dlrs 420,000, also bettering 
Zoeller's record. Couples was third with three skins and dlrs 150,000. 
Norman, playing his second event since missing seven months because 
of shoulder surgery, left with nothing on both days. Norman was eliminated 
on the third playoff hole. His second shot on No. 9 landed in water 
to the right of the green. He took a drop and hit his fourth shot 
within 9 meters (30 feet) of the hole, but missed the par putt. That 
left Lehman and Couples in a match-play duel. Couples, the career 
Skins leader with dlrs 1.34 million and 41 skins, missed four birdie 
putts that would have won the playoff. The first three putts slid 
by the hole, and the fourth, from 3 1-2 meters (12 feett) on No. 10, 
curved high around the cup. ``It's a big mind game,'' Lehman said. 
``Freddie had four putts to win and couldn't get it in the hole. That 
kind of thing wears on you.'' Lehman sank his 1-meter (4-foot) effort 
to tie Couples' single-hole money record. Couples also won dlrs 270,000 
in 1995 on the fifth extra hole. Lehman completed a two-day, 18-hole 
total of 63 on the par-71 course. He was 1-under in the playoff. He 
shot a 61 in winning last year.
