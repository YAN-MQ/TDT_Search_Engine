The Guyanese government said Sunday it will sell a 50 percent stake 
in troubled Guyana Airways. Advertisements seeking a buyer for the 
state-owned airline will be placed in publications around the world 
this week, a government statement said. Guyana Airways has a monopoly 
on non-stop routes from Georgetown to Miami, New York and Toronto. 
It also has Caribbean routes and flies small airplanes to isolated 
villages deep in Guyana's South American forests. Authorities said 
terms of the sale would be similar to the privatization this year 
of the Guyana Electricity Corp. Under that arrangement, the private 
buyers would be allowed to manage the company. The airline, which 
leases aircraft for its North American routes, has suffered a string 
of problems in the last year. Mechanical difficulties stranded dozens 
of passengers for days in Puerto Rico and Curacao, and this spring 
a leased Boeing 757 clipped the wing of another aircraft at the Georgetown 
airport. In July, the U.S. Federal Aviation Administration temporarily 
banned one 757 from flying to the United States while it examined 
the aircraft's maintenance records. It later removed the restriction. 
Before the recent troubles, the airline was the only profit-making 
long-haul carrier in the Caribbean. In 1997 the company lost dlrs 
2 million, its first loss in four years, prompting a reorganization 
in February. The government recently approved dlrs 1 million in capital 
improvement loans for the company.
