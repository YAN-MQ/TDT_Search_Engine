A top Japanese government official has reportedly said he wants former 
Prime Minister Kiichi Miyazawa to reconsider his intention to resign 
as finance minister. ``It is not easy to find his (Miyazawa's) replacement, 
considering his caliber,'' Deputy Chief Cabinet Secretary Muneo Suzuki 
said on a Sunday television program, Kyodo News agency reported. ``I 
for one would like him to stay on and devote himself to efforts to 
restore the nation's economy,'' Suzuki said. Miyazawa, 79, told a 
news conference Friday that he would step down as finance minister 
_ possibly by the end of this year _ after turning over leadership 
of his faction in the ruling Liberal Democratic Party to a younger 
protege and completing work on the fiscal 1999 budget. Japan is battling 
its deepest recession since the end of World War II. When Prime Minister 
Keizo Obuchi took office this summer, he turned to Miyazawa for his 
long experience in finance and economics. Miyazawa's return as head 
of the powerful ministry was heralded by some commentators. Others, 
however, criticized the move, blaming him for fueling Japan's asset-inflated 
economic ``bubble'' in the late 1980s, the eventual collapse of which 
is still adversely affecting the nation's economy.
