You may be noticing higher prices on everything from pizza to ice 
cream. And you can trace the reason back to the dairy farm. Patty 
Davis explains. The price of breakfast has just gone up at Jacob's 
brothers bagels in Chicago. A bagel with cream cheese will cost you 
an extra 15 cents. No matter how you slice it or where you buy it, 
prices for cream cheese and most other dairy products are way up. 
I have noticed that the butter prices just, you know, it's just really 
soared. I don't pay any attention to it. I just buy what I need. Whole 
milk and cheese prices have jumped to their highest level in two years. 
Part of the reason -- Consumers are moving towards the higher fat 
products. Consumers are drinking less milk, but they're eating more 
products loaded with butterfat, a basic ingredient in milk. It's a 
simple case of supply and demand. Dairy farmers can't produce enough 
milk to satisfy the growing demand for milk products such as cheese, 
cream cheese and ice cream. And that's pushing prices up. While that 
may be bad for consumers, it couldn't be better for Illinois dairy 
farmer David Shanks. Right now, the price of milk's been the best 
it's been in -- ever. And that's -- that's helped us as far as producers 
to recover some of our expenses over the years. After struggling through 
some lean years, Shanks is now poised to take advantage of the rising 
milk prices. He plans to double the size of his herd. The shortage 
of milk began this summer with El Nino's hot temperatures in texas 
and wet weather in California. Cows there produced less milk. Farmers 
are now making up for lost time, and analysts say consumers should 
start seeing lower prices for dairy products early next year. Bill 
simonson says he's not waiting for that. I'm a cheese freak. He's 
hooked on cheese at any price. Patty Davis, CNN, garden prairie, Illinois.
