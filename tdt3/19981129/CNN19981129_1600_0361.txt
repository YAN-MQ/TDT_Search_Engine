Authorities believe they may have found some evidence in the killing 
of an upstate New York doctor who performed abortions. Dr. Barnett 
slepian was gunned down in his home last month. "The Buffalo news" 
reports investigators have found items, possibly including human hair, 
in the Woods from where it is believed the sniper fired the fatal 
shot. The items will be tested for DNA. If found, investigators will 
try to match the results with DNA of a man wanted as a material witness 
in the case.
