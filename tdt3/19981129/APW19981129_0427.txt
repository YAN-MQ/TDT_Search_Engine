Heeding government warnings against turning their pristine Alpine 
nation into a drug haven, Swiss voters rejected proposals Sunday to 
legalize consumption of heroin and other narcotics. With a majority 
of results declared by mid-afternoon, not a single state accepted 
the proposal. For it to pass, it needed a majority of the 26 states 
and an absolute majority of votes. Polls published for Swiss television 
forecast a 75 percent vote against the proposed constitutional amendment 
that ``the consumption, cultivation or possession of drugs, and their 
acquisition for personal use, is not punishable.'' The rejection was 
in contrast to the overwhelming approval given last year to state 
distribution of heroin to hardened addicts. The government said that 
the amendment was misleadingly worded and did not represent a ``sensible'' 
drug policy. Ministers said it was a health risk and would turn Switzerland 
into a haven for drug tourists and traffickers and anger neighboring 
European countries. The government said its current policy of helping 
hard-core addicts while clamping down on dealers was best. Church 
groups, police chiefs, social workers, doctors and other professionals 
working with addicts also said the proposal should be rejected. No 
other European nation, not even the Netherlands, has legalized the 
possession or sale of any drugs or has plans to do so. The pro-legalization 
lobby _ a loose left-wing coalition that gathered the necessary 100,000 
signatures to force a referendum _ claimed it would stamp out trafficking 
and the black market. Backers hoped that sufficient votes in their 
favor would persuade the government to relax laws on soft drugs like 
marijuana. Switzerland has an estimated 30,000 hard drug addicts in 
its population of 7 million _ one of Europe's highest rates. A government 
survey published last week also showed a rise in cannabis consumption, 
with 27 percent of people ages 15-39 saying they had smoked marijuana 
at least once, compared with 16 percent in 1992. Voters looked set 
to give the go-ahead to government plans to spend dlrs 22.1 billion 
over 20 years modernizing the national rail network and linking it 
to high-speed lines in neighboring countries. Two new tunnels through 
the Alps to provide a route for north-south European cargo traffic 
between Germany and Italy and to provide speedy passenger train service. 
The public already approved the tunnels, but the government also wanted 
voters to approve the project's finance package.
