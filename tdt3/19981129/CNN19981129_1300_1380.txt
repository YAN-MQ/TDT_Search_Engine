want, you really can change the world. A place of doers and darers 
and shapers. Who's next? The New York stock exchange. I don't want 
to buy a new PC every year till commencement. I needed one that would 
keep up with them. Got to save SOMETHING FOR college. Call 1-800-gateway

OF a new one. You guys make sneakers? Call us now and let's talk about
