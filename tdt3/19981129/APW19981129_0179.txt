With oil prices hovering at 10-year lows, Iran's president sent a 
274 trillion rial (dlrs 91 billion) draft budget to Parliament Sunday 
that seeks to compensate for low oil revenues with a dramatic increase 
in non-oil exports. In a speech Sunday to Parliament, Mohammad Khatami 
said that drawing up the budget was ``not a simple task'' because 
of sagging oil revenues, decreasing productivity in other sectors 
and the need to create new jobs for young Iranians entering the work 
force. The proposed budget, for the fiscal year beginning March 21, 
is 20 percent higher than the current budget, the official Islamic 
Republic News Agency reported. Compared to the current budget, expected 
expenditures were 12 percent higher, at 63.2 trillion rials (dlrs 
21 billion), while revenues were 24.5 percent higher, at 92.6 trillion 
rials (dlrs 30.8 billion). A separate budget for state-owned firms, 
including banks and companies, was projected at 184 trillion rials 
(dlrs 61.3 billion). The amount of the deficit was not immediately 
clear, but newspapers projected it at 8.4 trillion rials (dlrs 2.8 
billion). Iran faces an expected deficit of dlrs 6.3 billion in the 
current year because of the international slump in oil prices. Presenting 
what amounts to an austerity budget, Khatami hinted that Iranians, 
who still suffer the economic effects of the 1980-88 war with Iraq, 
would have to remain strong if the economy plummets further. ``The 
government's great asset is its wise and intelligent people, who stand 
firm when inflation, prices and the demand for jobs is high,'' Khatami 
said in the speech broadcast live on Tehran radio. ``For this reason, 
the administration is not concerned about social problems at all,'' 
Khatami said. Iran relies on oil exports for more than 80 percent 
of its earnings. But in the draft budget, oil accounts for less than 
one-third of expected revenues, while non-oil revenues account for 
almost half. Taxes make up around one-third, IRNA reported. The increase 
in revenue depends on such exports as caviar, pistachio nuts, carpets 
and other handicrafts. Iran's efforts to boost these non-oil exports 
diversify its economy have been hampered by red-tape, corruption and 
a weak infrastructure. Khatami said that the draft budget emphasized 
spending on education, culture and social security, IRNA said. He 
did not disclose defense spending, which Iran has said is no more 
than dlrs 850 million per year. Western intelligence sources say it 
is much higher. The draft budget, now being debated in the Majlis, 
or parliament, is expected to be approved over the next few days. 
Iran, the second-largest producer within the Organization of Petroleum 
Exporting Countries, has pledged to cut output by 140,000 barrels 
per day from February levels to help support global oil prices. Iran 
has an OPEC quota of 3.9 million barrels per day.
