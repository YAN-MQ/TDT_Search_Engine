What happened to ``Babe: Pig in the City''? The family film, which 
cost about $90 million and had an initial gross of only $8.5 million, 
was not only the most high-profile failure over the Thanksgiving weekend, 
but it may cause the ouster of Universal Pictures' president, Casey 
Silver, several high-level talent agents and studio executives said. 
One top Universal executive, who spoke on the condition of anonymity, 
said simply: ``I'm heartbroken. It will not be a pleasant week.'' 
Only two weeks ago, Frank Biondi, the chairman of Universal Studios, 
the parent of Universal Pictures, was dismissed by Edgar Bronfman 
Jr., the chief executive at Seagram, which owns the studio. The projected 
departure of Silver, a well-liked figure at Universal, would come 
after the brutally disappointing reviews and box office for ``Meet 
Joe Black,'' a three-hour drama directed by Martin Brest and starring 
Brad Pitt and Anthony Hopkins. Several executives said that Ron Meyer, 
Silver's boss and president of Universal Studios, might take over 
the Universal Pictures job. What was dismaying to executives at Universal 
was that the sequel to the 1995 Australian sleeper hit ``Babe,'' about 
an orphaned pig taken in by a charmingly eccentric farmer, earned 
generally positive reviews and was lavishly promoted by the studio. 
But the sequel, directed by George Miller, whose previous movies included 
the ``Mad Max'' trilogy and ``Lorenzo's Oil,'' simply failed to draw 
crowds. By contrast, ``A Bug's Life,'' the computer-generated animated 
film made by Pixar and Disney, took in a record $46.5 million for 
the five-day holiday, Disney said. While the disappointing box office 
for ``Babe: Pig in the City'' cannot be fully explained, what happened 
to it is, in some ways, a textbook case of present-day Hollywood, 
where a studio can find itself almost locked into a release date and 
unable to budge despite extraordinary competition. Executives at Universal 
said the decision to produce the sequel to ``Babe'' was a foregone 
conclusion. The endearing and sophisticated original film, in which 
barnyard animals spoke to one another, cost only about $30 million. 
It received stunning critical reviews, and took in more than $64 million 
in the United States and about $150 million abroad. In deciding to 
make the sequel, studio executives gave the highly inventive Miller 
a free hand and set the film's release for the 1998 Thanksgiving weekend. 
Although sequels generally cost far more than originals, the price 
soared to close to $90 million partly because of complicated computer 
effects. With the studio's agreement, the newer film was designed 
to be more inventive and lavish than the first. (In addition, the 
sequel cost $25 million to $30 million to promote.) Like any other 
studio with a potential family franchise, Universal began making deals 
for tie-ins and toys. An estimated 100 licensees around the world 
began filling stores last month with toy Babes, CD-ROM Babes and interactive 
Babes that asked for meals. Essentially, the studio was more or less 
stuck with its release date because the merchandise was being distributed 
to coincide with the opening. In hindsight, several Universal executives 
said, the studio's lack of flexibility was especially damaging. For 
one, the new ``Babe'' was set to open against ``A Bug's Life.'' For 
the last few years Disney has had a virtual lock on Thanksgiving with 
such hits as ``Toy Story'' (also made by Pixar), ``101 Dalmations'' 
and ``Flubber.'' As a result, ``Babe'' faced heavy competition. The 
situation worsened for ``Babe'' when Paramount moved ``The Rugrats 
Movie'' from Christmas to Nov. 20. The film, based on the popular 
Nickelodeon series, was almost guaranteed to lure smaller children 
and their families, as well as pre-teen-agers, cutting heavily into 
the ``Babe'' audience. ``The `Rugrats' audience is incredibly loyal, 
kids from 3 to 13,'' said Albie Hecht, president of film and television 
entertainment at Nickelodeon. ``There's a real emotional connection 
that kids have to `Rugrats.' In many ways, `Rugrats' will be the first 
movie for a lot of kids.'' The film, which opened at No. 1 in its 
first week, took in an estimated $28 million over Thanksgiving and 
has grossed about $58 million so far. There was initially some thought 
about moving ``Babe'' to Christmas, but it would have competed with 
Dreamworks' ``Prince of Egypt,'' the story of Moses. One executive 
said Bronfman had personally vetoed this move because it would have 
placed Universal in competition with Dreamworks. Dreamworks offices 
are at Universal, and the two companies have close personal ties as 
well as a distribution agreement. Compounding the difficulties for 
``Babe'' was the unexpected success of ``The Waterboy,'' the comedy 
starring Adam Sandler, which has grossed nearly $123 million and is 
now drawing audiences of 7- and 8-year-old boys. The problems for 
``Babe'' deepened when its Los Angeles premiere two weeks ago was 
abruptly canceled because Miller was still working on the film. Television 
and newspaper accounts said that the film's mood was too dark for 
children and that Universal was worried about it. Universal executives 
said they believed that the bad publicity built up a negative impression 
about the film.
