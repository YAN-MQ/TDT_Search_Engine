Showing confidence on the last day of campaigning, Quebec's pro-independence 
premier toured opposition districts Sunday in hopes his party can 
increase its majority and build momentum for a new referendum on seceding 
from Canada. Lucien Bouchard, favored to return to power in Monday's 
provincial election, urged supporters of his Parti Quebecois to work 
for a high turnout of separatist voters. He closed the 33-day campaign 
with a swing through six districts around Montreal, five of them won 
narrowly by the anti-separatist Quebec Liberal Party in the last election 
in 1994. Liberal leader Jean Charest, who wants Quebec to abandon 
the threat of secession, insisted he still had a chance of victory. 
But he has spent the campaign's final days trying to shore up support 
in Liberal districts rather than venturing into separatist areas. 
In 1994, the popular vote was split almost evenly between the two 
parties, yet the Parti Quebecois won 77 of the legislature's 125 seats 
because its support was spread more evenly across the mostly French-speaking 
province. Pollsters say the separatists could do as well this time, 
perhaps topping the record 80 seats they won in 1981. A decisive separatist 
victory on Monday could accelerate the push for a referendum on secession, 
while a narrow win might prompt a more cautious approach. A surprise 
loss to Charest would derail the separatist cause for years. Twice 
before, separatists have been defeated in secession referendums, by 
a big margin in 1980 and narrowly in 1995. Bouchard, not wanting a 
third defeat, says he would call for another referendum only when 
convinced the separatists would win. In the meantime, he says he would 
press for more autonomy for all 10 provinces, particularly in regard 
to control over social programs. He expressed hope that the widespread 
anti-separatist animosity in the rest of Canada would subside after 
the election, even if his party won. ``If I was the person who is 
described in English Canada I would be the first to detest myself 
_ a dangerous man, negative, ungrateful,'' he said. ``Afterwards, 
things should become more normal, and we will be able to resume a 
healthier dialogue.'' Charest said voters should not trust Bouchard's 
promises to cooperate with other provinces. ``If someone chooses to 
vote for the Parti Quebecois they're giving a mandate to the government 
of Quebec to enter into a new period of confrontation and conflict 
with the rest of the country,'' he said. The latest round of polls 
by three Quebec polling firms show support for the Parti Quebecois 
at about 47 percent and the Liberals at about 41 percent, with most 
other voters backing a third party led by 28-year-old Mario Dumont. 
The polls indicate many Quebeckers support Bouchard even though they 
do not favor secession. Several polls have suggested that more than 
60 percent of voters do not want a referendum on independence during 
the next government's five-year term in office. ``There is a lot more 
fear of the Parti Quebecois in the rest of Canada than in Quebec,'' 
said Gilles Therrien, head of the SOM polling firm. ``The party has 
been there for a long time and has yet to carry out independence against 
anyone's will. I don't think they'll start now.''
