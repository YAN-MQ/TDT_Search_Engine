So you've seen ``Antz'' and now there's ``A Bug's Life.'' Does it 
make any sense to see another computer-animated movie about ants? 
Absolutely. Fact is, these are two quite different movies, and each 
is delightful in its own way. The main characters in ``A Bug's Life'' 
are drawn like shiny, bright-colored toys rather than the more textured 
creatures of ``Antz,'' and maybe that's a tip-off. Clearly, ``A Bug's 
Life'' is far more a kid's movie at heart. You won't find the knowing, 
Woody Allen-like verbal humor of ``Antz.'' But you will see more action 
per minute, and some of it is riveting. Even grown-ups will snap to 
attention when a cute, brightly colored songbird terrorizes our new 
insect friends. The scene drew gasps at a recent screening. And a 
closing chase, where the tiny characters speed through a saturation 
bombing of raindrops and ultimately return to that killer bird, is 
simply thrilling. ``A Bug's Life'' tells the story of an ant colony 
that's invaded annually by a gang of grasshoppers, who demand a major 
share of the harvest. One of the ants, Flik (voice of Dave Foley, 
who stars in TV's ``NewsRadio''), accidentally disposes of the offering 
just before the grasshoppers show up. It's up to him to save his colony. 
None of the grown-up ants has any faith in him, certainly not the 
lovely Princess Atta (voice of Julia Louis-Dreyfus from TV's ``Seinfeld''). 
Flik ventures out and recruits what he thinks is a band of warriors, 
which is actually a third-rate troupe of performers from a flea circus. 
But together with the ant colony, they drive off the grasshoppers, 
thanks largely to Flik's cleverness and bravery. Of course, he ends 
up with Atta. The animation is superb, as one would expect from the 
folks who created ``Toy Story.'' Not only is it technically impressive 
_ just watch that tree in the opening sequence, with each leaf shimmering 
in the breeze _ but it's clever. When the overbearing leader of the 
grasshoppers paces among the trembling ants, two sets of hands are 
clasped behind his back. When Flik ventures into the great outside 
world, he wanders into a collection of food boxes that's instantly 
recognizable as an ant-sized Times Square. Curiously, just as in ``Antz,'' 
the villain gets the most interesting face. It's just fun to watch 
Hopper (voice of Kevin Spacey) be evil. Grown-ups might find the story 
sagging a bit before they get swept up in the closing scenes. But 
for them, there's a treat at the closing credits: a series of supposed 
``outtakes'' in which the insects act all too human. It's some of 
the best stuff in the movie. ``A Bug's Life,'' rated G, comes from 
Walt Disney Pictures and Pixar Animation Studios. It is produced by 
Darla K. Anderson and Kevin Reher, directed by John Lasseter and co-directed 
by Andrew Stanton, with screenplay by Stanton, Donald McEnergy and 
Bob Shaw.
