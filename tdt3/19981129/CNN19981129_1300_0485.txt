The belief that road rage is getting worse may not be true. "The Washington 
Post" reports, there is no statistical evidence to back up the perception 
road rage is on the rise and making driving more dangerous. Researchers 
say the highway death rate, injuries and crashes are declining. Others 
say aggression on the highway could be increasing, but better equipment 
is keeping people safer.
