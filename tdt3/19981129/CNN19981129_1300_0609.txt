It's an African country the world sometimes equates with starvation. 
And in that respect, Somalia is living up to expectations once again. 
Jim Clancy explains. An all-too-familiar scene in Somalia -- hungry 
civilians fighting for their share of precious food and clean drinking 
water. The situation is not as serious as what the world witnessed 
six years ago, but the blank stares and exhausted faces are reminiscent 
of that tragedy that cost as many as 300,000 lives. Civil war was 
blamed for that disaster. This time, aid workers say the cause is 
flood and drought. Experienced failure of crops for the last three 
years, so the situation looks like an emergency. Earlier this year, 
floods ravaged parts of the somali countryside, wiping out crops and 
stranding tens of thousand of people in remote areas. As rivers overflowed 
their banks, land routes that would normally bring in relief supplies 
were cut off. Somalia's long-running internal conflicts are compounding 
the situation as well. Fighting between rival militias has displaced 
residents, forcing them to migrate to safer ground. Aid agencies warn 
up to three-quarters of a million people are in immediate danger -- 
a number that could rise unless aid reaches the country quickly. Residents 
lined up for the first emergency rations of food they have seen in 
three months, in up with town, a delay caused by their isolation in 
the somali countryside. The United Nations has appealed for $18 million 
at the very least to meet the most urgent demands for food until June 
of next year. Last week, the European union pledged $10 million, and 
said almost 11,000 tons of food would be distributed through the U.N.'s 
world food program. The real test may be whether once the food is 
donated, the warlords who still control the country will allow it 
to pass freely to the thousands of somalis in desperate need of emergency 
aid. Jim Clancy, "Headline News."
