Top stories are next. Then, in "Dollars & Sense" -- romanian health 
care gets a shot in the arm from cell phones. My dad works for international 
paper. He makes orange juice cartons so the orange juice can stay 
fresh longer. I think fresh orange juice makes you feel better. http:www.internationalpaper.com 
I THINK MY DAD PLAYS A TRICK ON ORANGE JUICE. He makes it think that 
it's still an orange. International paper. Answering citrus producers' 
needs, and yours. And now a story of life and death. John was brilliant. 
We'll miss his brilliant conversations. John knew everything. We'll 
miss his knowledge. John wrote that consolidated contract. He didn't 
even tell us where he put it. Now they're really consumed with grief. 
If only they knew John scanned all of his documents... into the Xerox 
document center. He made them digital and put every last one of them 
on the company website. I wonder what John would do in this situation. 
He'd check your website to see if the Xerox document center... scanned 
in the consolidated contract. Hey, I just had a thought. Oh, there's 
a good place to start. You don't think John scanned the contract into 
the, uh, the-- the Xerox document center. Xerox document center, do 
you? John was smart, but he wasn't that smart. Ooohhh! I don't think 
John liked that.
