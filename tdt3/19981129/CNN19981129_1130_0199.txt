Almost half of Michigan residents say Dr. Jack Kevorkian should face 
criminal charges in the death of a man who had Lou Gehrig's disease. 
That's based on a statewide survey of 300 people. Kevorkian was charged 
Wednesday with first-degree murder in the death of the 52-year-old 
man. Kevorkian gave the man a lethal injection, then provided a videotape 
of his death to the CBS program "60 minutes."
