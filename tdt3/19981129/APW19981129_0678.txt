Israeli warplanes struck suspected guerrilla bases in southern Lebanon 
on Sunday for the second consecutive day to avenge attacks on Israeli 
outposts, Lebanese security officials said. Two Israeli jets fired 
two air-to-surface missiles on hills between the villages of Toulin 
and Qabrigha, 23 kilometers (14 miles) southeast of the port city 
of Tyre, the officials said. They spoke on customary condition of 
anonymity. There was no immediate word on casualties from the 6:20 
p.m. (1620 GMT) raid on the area, which Lebanese guerrillas have used 
in the past as a base. On Saturday, Israeli warplanes struck suspected 
guerrilla hideouts in the south, a day after two Israeli soldiers 
were killed in a roadside bombing near Tyre that was claimed by the 
Lebanese guerrilla group Hezbollah. The latest raid came as Israeli 
Cabinet ministers called for military strikes against Beirut's power 
and water supplies to retaliate for Hezbollah attacks. Seven Israeli 
soldiers have been killed in the past two weeks by the Iranian-backed 
Hezbollah, or Party of God. Hezbollah has led a guerrilla war to try 
to oust an estimated 1,500 Israeli soldiers and their 2,500 allied 
militiamen from the self-styled ``security zone'' that Israel set 
up in southern Lebanon in 1985 to protect against cross-border guerrilla 
attacks. Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu cut short a European 
trip to deal with the growing debate in Israel over the losses in 
Lebanon and mounting calls for a unilateral Israeli withdrawal. Sunday's 
airstrike came shortly after Hezbollah guerrillas claimed responsibility 
for mortar and rocket attacks on positions held by Israel and its 
allied South Lebanon Army militia in the south. No casualties were 
reported.
