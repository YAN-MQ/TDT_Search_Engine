Finally tonight, if you're the parent of a young child, you've probably 
heard more than you want to about furbies. That's the hot toy this 
year. It's already caused near riots at some stores. There seems to 
be a new hot toy every year. But who's really behind it? We asked 
ABC's Brian Rooney to find out. People line up in the dark. They crowd 
under the watchful eye of a security guard. They accept rationing, 
one to a customer. yes. Oh, yes. And if they don't get one, they are 
not happy. I'm sorry, but it's not right, man. Remember the tickle-me 
elmo and the cabbage patch doll? Those are the hot toys of Christmas 
past. The toy phenomenon this year is the furby, a little electronic 
creature that speaks in several languages and sneezes when it's cold. 
It's cute, but does everybody really have to have one? It starts with 
a couple of kids. The next thing you know, the whole school wants 
one. How does this happen? Well, the toymakers are literally jumping 
up and down to make something that pleases children, looking to make 
what they call a breakout toy. The first thing is, you have to start 
out with a great toy. A toy that creates magic that a child is going 
to be surprised, to put a Smile on their faces, that'll be fun. Then 
the toymakers plan their marketing attack, as much as a year ahead. 
They spend millions advertising to tell kids they've got to have this 
thing no one ever heard of before. Well, I saw them first on TV -- 
Uh-huh. And I thought that they were really, really fun. But the formula 
for success, unlike the toy, is not something that comes in a box. 
The toy has to have qualities even people who spend their lives with 
toys can't quite describe. The furbies, I don't understand it. I wouldn't 
have believed it unless I saw it with my own eyes. Finally, it helps 
if there aren't quite enough of them to go around, then you've got 
a buying frenzy, in animated fur balls, a parent's nightmare and a 
toymaker's dream. These are priceless. My niece has been waiting for 
one. Priceless now, and probably discounted by January. Brian Rooney, 
ABC News, Los Angeles.
