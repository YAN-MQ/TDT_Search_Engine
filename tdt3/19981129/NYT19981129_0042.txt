The first thing one noticed about ``The Glint'' on Saturday night 
at the Kitchen was Nicole Eisenman's set. Figurines of tiny animals 
and people were crowded onto small platforms. Little racing cars were 
spaced along a strip of cloth that resembled a highway. Five plates 
on the floor held slices of bread. Ms. Eisenman created a toylike 
world. And Jennifer Monson's choreography often conveyed the spirit 
of adventure that can be found in children's storybooks. The action 
contrasted two women (Chrysa Parkinson and Ms. Monson) with a quintet 
(Miguel Gutierrez, Sarah Michelson, Joanne Nerenberg, Jennifer Allen 
and Robert Bingham). All moved to a score by Guy Yarden that combined 
electronic sounds with live violin music, played by the composer. 
The two women sometimes seemed friends and at other times rivals. 
Their alternations between cooperation and competition occasionally 
became monotonous. Yet, fortunately, there were many striking moments, 
as when the women rolled stormily across the floor while Yarden produced 
a cyclone of musical sounds. The dancers in the quintet formed an 
imposing human wall marching back and forth. They also bent down and 
placed the slices of bread in their mouths. Their movements looked 
so obsessive throughout the 70-minute piece that one could never be 
sure if this wall of bodies was protective or threatening. Near the 
end of ``The Glint,'' Yarden fiddled energetically. But all the dancers 
stood motionless yet alert. Then came a few hesitant gestures. Although 
the work ended there, the choreography implied that a new adventure 
was ready to begin.
