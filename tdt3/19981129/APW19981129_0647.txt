German automaker Porsche said Sunday it will skip a season of motor 
racing competition to work on quality after a string of poor race 
results. The decision means Porsche, a record 16-time winner, won't 
compete in the 1999 edition of the 24-hour race at Le Mans, France. 
It will also skip next year's American Le Mans Series. Porsche will 
enter both competitions in 2000, a company statement said. Board member 
Horst Marchart said the team's poor recent performance in the GT championship, 
where Porsche trailed rivals Mercedes and BMW, were a key reason making 
a break necessary. ``The team and the drivers made mistakes, and the 
technology was not always reliable,'' he said. ``There are no excuses.''
