It has been slow going for three men trekking across Antarctica. New 
Zealander Peter Hillary and his two Australian colleagues are trying 
to make an 1,800-mile journey to the South Pole and back without outside 
assistance. Bad weather and difficult terrain have hampered their 
efforts. They set out November 4th but have traveled only 186 miles. 
The team had hoped to make the entire trip in about three months. 
85 years ago, a similar expedition failed, with deadly consequences.
