Their rivalry now behind them, Virgin boss Richard Branson and Chicago 
millionaire Steve Fossett are putting the final touches to a joint 
bid to circle the globe in a hot air balloon. Officials at the Menara 
military airport in Marrakech, who requested anonymity, said Sunday 
that their balloon was in place and that preparations were advanced. 
If conditions are right, the launch is expected to take place this 
week. ``If we make this, I think we'll all earn a place in aviation 
history,'' Fossett said Sunday in an interview with Britain's Sky 
News. He said he was looking forward to some company since he usually 
flies solo. ``It's different, but it's enjoyable being part of a team. 
I like the guys I'm flying with, and I think we're going to have a 
great time,'' he said. ``Fortunately, these are pretty mellow guys. 
They've done this before. They know how to keep cool and not aggravate 
each other. I think we're going to get along well together.'' Fossett 
broke his own distance record in August, traveling more than 15,200 
miles (24,320 kilometers) before a storm damaged his balloon, sending 
it plunging into the sea off Australia. Branson, the flamboyant tycoon 
whose Virgin company name adorns everything from record stores and 
clothing to an airline, has failed to accomplish the feat in four 
attempts. Branson's previous attempts have been hampered by weather. 
The only time he managed to take off _ in January 1997 _ his balloon 
crash-landed in the Algerian desert. The two former rivals will be 
accompanied by Swedish balloonist Pers Lindstrand in the Virgin Global 
Challenger. They also have a backup balloon in case their main one 
is damaged.
