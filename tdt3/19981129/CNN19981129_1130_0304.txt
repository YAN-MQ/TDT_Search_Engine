The latest developments in President Clinton's impeachment proceedings 
are once again drawing partisan reaction. At issue -- the president's 
response to 81 written questions from the house judiciary committee. 
Congressional republicans call the answers evasive and disappointing. 
Democrats contend the American public is satisfied with Mr. Clinton's 
response, and that should be enough. Frankly, the president answered 
the questions like any other citizen would have answered them to the 
best of his ability, and we saw no new evidence. And frankly, I think 
with no new evidence, we need to strike a bipartisan approach to this. 
There is no basis for articles of impeachment. If the president would 
have the character to come forward and admit to the wrongdoing, I 
think then maybe I would treat him differently. But right now, to 
me, he is an unrepentant perjurer who should lose his job unless he 
changes his Tone with the American people and reconciles himself with 
the law. Mr. Clinton's answers to the house Judiciary committee fall 
into three broad categories -- saying he can't remember, giving answers 
that conflict with Monica Lewinsky's testimony, or declaring his answers 
are technically true under the law.
