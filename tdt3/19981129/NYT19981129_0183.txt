Before the lunch at Lespinasse, Dr. Robert Frank's theory seemed unassailable. 
Frank, an economist with a radical proposal to reduce conspicuous 
consumption, thinks we would all be happier if we spent less money 
this holiday season, and he illustrated his point during a morning 
shopping expedition on Fifth Avenue. After examining a $9,500 porcelain 
hawk in Trump Tower and a $55,000 brooch at Tiffany, he found the 
ultimate gift at Asprey &AMP; Garrard. It was for the man who owns 
a half-dozen mechanical watches _ the kind that are powered by the 
movement of your wrist, cost $20,000, keep time less accurately than 
a $20 quartz watch and stop running when not worn. To keep them all 
ticking, the store offers a $5,700 leather-encased box equipped with 
six battery-powered mechanical wrists. ``That is just fantastic,'' 
Frank tactfully told the sales clerk as he marveled at the box. He 
waited until he left the store to make his point: ``It's easy to imagine 
that there are better uses for that $5,700.'' Frank does not object 
on moral grounds to expensive watches or the people who love them. 
He is neither a socialist nor an ascetic. Frank, a professor at Cornell 
University's Johnson Graduate School of Management, is a free-market 
economist who believes society is usually better off when individuals 
are free to greedily pursue their own self-interest. But when it comes 
to luxuries like watch-rotating boxes, Frank thinks that the pursuit 
of individual self-interest leaves everyone worse off. In his forthcoming 
book, ``Luxury Fever'' (Free Press), he argues that conspicuous consumption 
is a collective-action problem, like an arms race: the more your neighbor 
spends, the more you must spend just to stay even. ``The lavish spending 
by people at the top of the scale sets a standard that affects everyone 
below,'' he said. ``When the rich are wearing a different $20,000 
watch every day, the middle class feel they need $1,000 watches. If 
the other people competing for a job are wearing $1,500 suits, you're 
at a disadvantage if you go to the interview in a $300 suit.'' Frank 
maintains that the recent surge in luxury spending has bought little 
extra happiness, because studies show that the joys of consumption 
are relative and fleeting. Your satisfaction with the size of your 
home depends not so much on its square footage but on how it compares 
with the size of your neighbors' homes. Trading in a Camry for a BMW 
makes you happier only for a short time, until the new level of luxury 
seems routine to you (and your neighbor buys a Porsche). ``We'd all 
be happier,'' Frank said, ``if everyone spent less on luxury goods. 
We wouldn't have to work such long hours, so we'd have more time to 
spend with our families. There'd be more money to spend on education 
and health, and more savings for capital investments that would make 
society richer in the long run.'' To test this theory, Frank was invited 
to lunch in the rococo splendor of Lespinasse at the St. Regis Hotel. 
Over foie gras, he explained his remedy for conspicuous consumption: 
replace the income tax with a simple, progressive tax on the total 
amount you spend each year (which could be easily calculated by deducting 
your savings from your income). This scheme sounded fine until the 
waiters presented the risotto. It was served with asparagus, chanterelle 
mushrooms and diced lobster, and was accompanied by the crowning glory, 
emulsion of white truffle oil frothing in a footed silver bowl. Whatever 
one thought of the value of rotating-watch boxes, there was no denying 
that adding this truffle oil emulsion to the risotto increased the 
sum of human happiness. ``Money does buy wonderful things,'' Frank 
said as he savored the taste. He conceded that his tax system would 
make such meals more expensive _ a person in the top bracket might 
pay $50 tax on this $75 lunch _ and therefore rarer. But he insisted 
that we could somehow survive. ``A lot of our satisfaction here comes 
from knowing that this is the finest lunch we can buy in New York,'' 
he said. ``The problem is the cost of the finest lunch in New York 
has risen much faster than the rate of inflation, so we're spending 
much more today for it than we did 20 years ago. If we could just 
stop that trend, we'd get more satisfaction for less money.'' But 
what about the truffle oil emulsion? ``Well, we might have to do without 
the truffle oil,'' he said. ``But we wouldn't miss it so much.''
