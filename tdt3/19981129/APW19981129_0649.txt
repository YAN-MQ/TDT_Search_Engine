Austrian companies that profited from slave laborers during WWII must 
cooperate with restitution efforts, or face lawsuits, a New York-based 
attorney representing Holocaust victims said. ``If those (companies) 
who are responsible have a conscious, they will realize they have 
an outstanding debt with each person they used as a forced laborer,'' 
Ed Fagan told the Austria Press Agency in Vienna Sunday. ``There is 
not much time left to bring this to justice.'' Six weeks ago, Fagan 
offered to meet with three leading Austrian companies believed to 
have profited from the use of slave labor under the Nazi regime. So 
far none of the three _ VOEST, known then as Hermann-Goering-Werke, 
Steyr-Daimler-Puch or Lenzinger Zellstoffwerke _ have responded to 
the invitation. Fagan warned that if the companies failed to cooperate 
with him, they would be facing lawsuits in the near future. ``Many 
of the survivors are already very old, so this can't wait much longer,'' 
Fagan told APA, citing the case of a former Steyr-Werke forced laborer 
who recently suffered from a brain tumor. ``We will not allow these 
companies to deny responsibility because victims have died,'' he said. 
Fagan has been the lead attorney in several lawsuits against German 
banks and companies filed in New York on behalf of Holocaust victims. 
As many as 9 million people were used by the Nazis as slave laborer, 
many of the them from eastern Europe. While some people have criticized 
Fagan for trying to profit from the Holocaust, many survivors support 
his cause. Paul Frenkel is one of them. He was forced to work for 
a German company during the war. ``As payment, my whole family was 
wiped out,'' Frenkel said. ``We received nothing, while former SS 
troopers receive pensions.'' ``We are not looking to get rich,'' said 
Jack Bresler, a Polish-born survivor of Dachau and Auschwitz concentration 
camps, who was also used as a slave laborer in Germany. He said its 
not right that companies who became rich through slave laborers have 
not had to compensate survivors in any way. ``The war didn't end for 
us in 1945,'' Bresler said. ``We won't forget it until we are dead.''
