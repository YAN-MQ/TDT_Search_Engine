With stunning defeat in four state elections casting a shadow on his 
government, Prime Minister Atal Bihari Vajpayee reassured foreign 
business owners Sunday that political shakeups would not affect planned 
measures to open markets and reduce barriers to outside investment. 
``The volatility of Indian democracy will have no fundamental impact 
on the process of economic reforms in the country,'' Vajpayee told 
hundreds of Indian and foreign business leaders at an economic summit 
organized by the World Economic Forum. The government had ``depoliticized 
the economic agenda,'' he said. Vajpayee's Bharatiya Janata Party 
suffered a series of embarrassing setbacks in the elections to four 
state assemblies _ it lost hold of governments in New Delhi, site 
of the federal capital, and the western Rajasthan state. The BJP also 
failed to dislodge the ruling Congress Party in the central state 
of Madhya Pradesh. The poor showing in Wednesday's elections was expected 
to increase difficulties within the 19-party governing coalition, 
though several of its partners on Sunday assured their support to 
Vajpayee's Hindu nationalist government. Sonia Gandhi, president of 
the main opposition Congress Party, said Sunday that her group would 
wait for the coalition to crumble on its own, rather than make an 
immediate attempt to regain power. Indian business leaders said that 
domestic and foreign investors were apprehensive about the prospects 
for economic reforms announced over the past two months. Dhruv Sawhney, 
former president of the Confederation of Indian Industry, said the 
several important economic bills _ including a proposal to partly 
open the insurance sector to foreign investors _ awaited parliamentary 
approval. ``One does not know their fate with this political uncertainty,'' 
Sawhney was quoted as saying by Press Trust of India. The government 
has also announced plans to bring patent laws in line with international 
norms, to eliminate red tape for incorporating new businesses, to 
facilitate business ownership of property, and to speed approval of 
foreign investment in local projects. At the conference, Vajpayee 
promised seven to eight percent growth in the country's gross domestic 
product, low inflation and new jobs. ``Look at the inherent strengths 
of India and the inherent opportunities it offers for mutual benefit,'' 
he said. ``These opportunities will grow irrespective of political 
vagaries.'' India's economy is currently struggling. The trade deficit 
widened to dlrs 5 billion during the first half of the fiscal year, 
compared with dlrs 2.5 billion from April to September last year, 
according to the Commerce Ministry. Exports fell 5 percent to dlrs 
2.8 billion in September, the latest month reported, from dlrs 2.9 
billion in September 1997. Imports for the same month rose more than 
20 percent, according to government estimates.
