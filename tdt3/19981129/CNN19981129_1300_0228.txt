Janet Reno must decide by tomorrow whether to launch another independent 
counsel investigation of the Clinton White House. It would focus on 
former deputy White House chief of staff Harold Ickes. At issue -- 
whether he lied to a Senate committee about whether the Clinton administration 
tried to intervene in a teamsters union dispute with a Company called 
diamond walnut. By next week, Reno must also make a decision on a 
possible independent counsel investigation of President Clinton concerning 
some democratic national committee campaign commercials.
