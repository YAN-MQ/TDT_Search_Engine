Finally tonight -- another battle in the ongoing war between nature 
and industry. This confrontation pits birds against Rockets. It's 
all happening in the Caribbean on an island 34 miles from anguilla. 
NBC's Keith Miller has our report. This tiny island, just 34 miles 
from anguilla in the Caribbean, is a natural sanctuary for seabirds. 
Sombrero island measures just 5 acres, but to thousands of migrating 
seabirds, this is home. Brown and masked boobies, frigate and tropic 
birds nest here. Sombrero island is probably the most important seabird 
breeding island in the entire region. Seabirds need solitude to breed, 
and they need islands that are free of predators and free, usually, 
of too much vegetation. And this site is perfect. It is also a perfect 
place to launch Rockets into space. In Texas, beal aerospace is testing 
a large launch vehicle to take satellites into orbit. The company 
wants to set up a rocket launching station building a harbor, airstrip 
and launch pad. Sombrero island would never be the same. The company 
says that's the price of progress. You could put a stop on building 
every house in the Caribbean region, and that would probably help 
the birds. You could tell us we can't use sombrero island, it would 
probably help the birds. But is that what we really want to do for 
the nation of anguilla and as a World? Beal aerospace has offered 
to buy land in the Caribbean and relocate the breeding grounds. Experts 
say it won't work, because many seabirds only breed in the place where 
they were born. Environmentalists warn that the seabirds are in danger 
of being wiped out. The government of anguilla will make a decision 
on who needs the air space most. That problem is real, it won't go 
away. Damage is inevitable. I don't think they shy away from saying 
that. What we are saying is that it is possible mitigate it to a degree, 
and that damage is not, perhaps, as total as people -- the potential 
damage is not as total as people thought. The government is apparently 
ready to accept the offer, saying sombrero island will bring greater 
benefits to people as a rocket station than a bird sanctuary. Keith 
Miller, NBC news.
