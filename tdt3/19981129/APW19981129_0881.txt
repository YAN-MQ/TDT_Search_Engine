The first operational Arrow anti-missile missile rolled off the assembly 
line at Israel Aircraft Industries Sunday. Israel TV said the missile, 
part of a jointly funded Israel-U.S. defense project, would be used 
for further testing. An Israeli test of the Arrow in September was 
successful. Israel is now waiting for missile batteries to arrive 
and the entire project is expected to be fully operational by mid-1999. 
Defense Minister Yitzhak Mordechai said in the roll-out ceremony at 
Israel Aircraft Industries that Israel would continue to invest in 
the development of the Arrow. ``More than that, we will overcome the 
challenge before us so that we can strike ballistic missiles far, 
far from Israeli territory,'' Mordechai said. The defense establishment 
will not sell the Arrow until all tests are completed, the minister 
added. Critics have said the Arrow will only be able to shoot down 
missiles close to base and not in enemy skies. The project got a boost 
after the 1991 Gulf War when American patriot missiles failed in many 
cases to destroy Iraqi Scuds fired at Israel and Saudi Arabia. Israel 
hopes to use the Arrow as a defense against threats from such countries 
as Iran, Iraq, Syria and Libya. Israel is particularly concerned about 
Iran's successful test in July of the Shahab 3 missile, which can 
reach Israel with it's 800-mile (1,287-kilometer) range. Iran is also 
developing an upgraded version of the Shahab missile with a range 
of 1,200 miles (1,931 kilometers), or enough to reach Israeli soil 
and U.S. troops stationed in the Gulf and Europe.
