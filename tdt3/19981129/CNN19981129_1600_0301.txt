The latest developments in President Clinton's impeachment proceedings 
are once again drawing partisan reaction. Congressional republicans 
are not pleased with the president's response to 81 written questions 
from the house Judiciary committee, calling the answers evasive and 
disappointing. Democrats contend the American public is satisfied 
with Mr. Clinton's response, and that should be enough. I think it 
would be profoundly unwise if we as a Congress on a party line vote 
impeached the president of the United States against the manifest 
will of the American people. We have the power to do that, but I question 
whether or not it's a wise thing to do. The biggest mistake we can 
make is to live totally for the political moment. If it's obvious 
to almost everybody in the country the president lied under oath to 
a federal grand jury and all we do is write him a nasty letter and 
he keeps playing these word games, we will have left the rule of law 
in tatters. House Judiciary committee chairman Henry Hyde has set 
the second week of december for deliberations on articles of impeachment.
