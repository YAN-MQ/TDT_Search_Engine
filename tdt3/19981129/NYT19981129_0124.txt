Curtis Martin knew that Jets center Kevin Mawae had been teasing him 
not long ago, saying, ``We haven't seen you break a long one; we're 
starting to question your speed.'' ``Just wait, you'll see,'' Martin 
replied. And on Sunday Mawae finally saw that long run. So did all 
the other Jets and all the 71,50l spectators at Giants Stadium as 
Curtis Martin slithered and sprinted 60 yards through the Carolina 
Panthers for a touchdown for a 10-7 lead in the first quarter of what 
evolved into a 48-21 rout. ``Curtis gave us the spark early,'' fullback 
Keith Byars was saying now at his locker. ``We were riding on his 
shoulders. Every time we gave him the ball, something good was happening.'' 
Yards were happening: 110 rushing yards in 21 carries, another 33 
yards on two receptions. For the season, Martin now has 1,039 rushing 
yards, which puts him on two pedestals: only the sixth running back 
with 1,000 or more rushing yards in each of his first four National 
Football League seasons, and only the fourth Jets running back with 
1,000 or more rushing yards in a season. Martin joined some impressive 
names: Barry Sanders, Eric Dickerson, Tony Dorsett, Earl Campbell 
and Terrell Davis on the NFL list; Freeman McNeil, Adrian Murrell 
and John Riggins on the Jets' list. But that 60-yard touchdown, along 
with a nifty 23-yard gain on a swing pass from Vinny Testaverde, showed 
that Martin's legs are finally healthy and strong after months of 
nagging damage. So are his instincts. ``You're like sniffing every 
little opening, then your body just drifts into it,'' he said. ``Wherever 
the opening was, that's where I was going to be. On that long run, 
it's like when I see the hole, I got through the hole and it feels 
like I was jogging. I didn't feel like I was running fast. I felt 
someone on my side, that's when I realized I had daylight in front.'' 
Martin is running at his best when the Jets must be at their best 
if they are to finish in first place in their East Division for the 
first time since the 1968 and 1969 seasons. With December arriving 
Tuesday, the Jets know that the weather for three of their last four 
games isn't likely to be as balmy as Sunday's kickoff temperature 
of a sunny 61 degrees. Seattle is next Sunday's visitor, then the 
Jets play in Miami on a Sunday night and go to Buffalo on a Saturday 
afternoon before returning for their season finale against New England. 
``I like cold weather,'' Martin said. ``I feel it gives me an advantage.'' 
Martin thrived in cold late-season and playoff games in New England 
when the Patriots went to Super Bowl XXXI, but a year ago he missed 
the Patriots' last three regular-season games and two playoff games 
because of shoulder and abdominal injuries. And since joining the 
Jets, he's had hamstring and thigh ailments. ``My legs are feeling 
better and better,'' he said. ``This was the best that they've felt.'' 
Since joining the Jets, Martin also has had the burden of his six-year 
$36 million contract. ``Everybody puts $36 million after his name, 
it puts more pressure on him,'' coach Bill Parcells said. ``But he's 
a good back. He can play on my team.'' Martin, whose speech and manner 
projects the persona of a pro's pro, dismissed the moneybags burden. 
``When I was making minimum, nobody wrote minimum before or after 
my name,'' he said, alluding to his low salaries in his seasons with 
the Patriots. ``My contract isn't going to make me any better or any 
worse.'' After the embarrassing losses to the Rams in St. Louis and 
to the Colts in Indianapolis earlier in the season, the Jets made 
sure they wouldn't be embarrassed by losing to Carolina, which is 
now a lowly 2-10. ``The next four weeks, it's going to be like a playoff 
game for us,'' Mawae said. ``We've got to treat it like that.'' But 
if this Jets team is to survive these four ``playoff'' games, it must 
do what so many Jets teams have been unable to do: win their December 
games. ``We're playing four teams,'' Parcells said, ``that are in 
the playoff picture.'' Prior to Parcells' arrival as major domo, the 
Jets had lost 15 consecutive December games. And a year ago in their 
first season under Parcells, they were 8-5 going into December, then 
lost two of their last three games, including the 13-10 crusher in 
the season finale in Detroit that knocked the Jets out of the playoffs. 
The franchise's most damaging December collapse occurred in 1986 when 
the Jets, after being 10-1, lost their last five games, including 
three in December. So when December dawns on Tuesday and it's time 
to turn the pages on all the calendars in Weeb Ewbank Hall at the 
Jets' complex, maybe it would be wise not to turn the pages. Just 
pretend it's still November for the next four weeks.
