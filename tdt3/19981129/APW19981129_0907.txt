The first operational Arrow anti-ballistic missile rolled off the 
assembly line at Israel Aircraft Industries Sunday. Israel TV said 
the missile, part of a jointly funded Israel-U.S. defense project, 
would be used for further testing. An Israeli test of the Arrow in 
September was successful. The entire project is expected to be fully 
operational by mid-1999. The defense establishment will not sell the 
Arrow until all tests are completed, Defense Minister Yitzhak Mordechai 
said at the ceremony at Israel Aircraft Industries. Critics have said 
the Arrow will only be able to shoot down missiles close to base and 
not in enemy skies. The project got a boost after the 1991 Gulf War, 
when American Patriot missiles failed in many cases to destroy Iraqi 
Scuds fired at Israel and Saudi Arabia. Israel hopes to use the Arrow 
as a defense against threats from such countries as Iran, Iraq, Syria 
and Libya. Israel is particularly concerned about Iran's successful 
test in July of the Shahab 3 missile, which can reach Israel with 
it's 800-mile (1,300-kms) range.
