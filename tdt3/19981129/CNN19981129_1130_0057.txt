If you're about to hit the road or head to the airport, you're not 
alone. Millions of people who went somewhere for Thanksgiving are 
returning home today. Cynthia Tornquist reports. This Thanksgiving 
holiday, it is estimated more than 38 million americans have taken 
to the skies, roads or railways, a 2% increase over last year. Of 
those, 18 million, the air transportation association says, are flying. 
On Sunday alone, an estimated 2 million passengers are expected to 
fill 89% of airline seats. Aaa predicts a record 28 million travelers 
will take to the roads, driving 100 miles or more from home. The most 
traveled region of the country during this holiday weekend is the 
southeast with an estimated 7.2 million vehicles on the road, followed 
by the west with 5.4 million, the midwest, 5.3 million, the northeast, 
5.2 million and the Great Lakes with 4.9 million. Cars are not the 
only vehicles on the road, buses are out in record numbers too. One 
million riders, the American bus association estimates, are traveling 
via their wheels from the Wednesday before Thanksgiving to the Monday 
after. To accommodate Sunday's numbers, Greyhound has added 3,200 
extra buses. And for those who took to the rails, well, you can expect 
a full train. This holiday, Amtrak expects to see 550,000 passengers 
aboard their trains, a 30% jump in overall ridership. Amtrak has added 
trains to its northeast service as well as additional seats on its 
midwest, pacific northwest and southwest lines. Officials advise you 
to leave early if possible, and to get a reserved seat. At Penn station,
