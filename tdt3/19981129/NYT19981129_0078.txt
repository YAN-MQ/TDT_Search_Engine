Pressing an effort to persuade Britain to free Gen. Augusto Pinochet 
and let him fly home, the foreign minister of Chile said here Sunday 
that his government would pursue its own judgment of the former dictator. 
Foreign Minister Jose Miguel Insulza said that the popular view that 
the 83-year-old general had unlimited immunity in his own country 
was wrong and that there were 14 cases against him initiated by alleged 
victims of his dictatorship that are in the hands of prosecutors in 
Santiago. The cases have all been brought since March, when the general 
stepped down as commander in chief of the armed forces. The people 
who have sought prosecution believe that the Chilean judge handling 
the cases has been doing a ``thorough job,'' Insulza said. ``I think 
the government is going to do even more to make sure that the investigation 
goes forward, but of course you can never say, `We assure you he is 
going to jail,' '' he said. In contrast to only ``symbolic'' justice 
in Britain or Spain, Insulza contended, ``the only real chance to 
have some kind of justice and some kind of truth is in Chile, where 
the events happened.'' Insulza made the comments to the television 
interviewer David Frost on Sunday in one of a series of appearances 
and news conferences the Chilean official has held since arriving 
here on Friday to plead the diplomatic case for Pinochet's return 
to Chile. A Socialist, Insulza spent years in exile during the Pinochet 
years and does not plan to visit the former dictator in London. Pinochet 
is being held here for a hearing on Dec. 11 on a Spanish petition 
for his extradition to Madrid to face charges of genocide, terrorism 
and torture in connection with the killings and ``disappearances'' 
of 3,178 people. While hinting at possible court action against the 
general at home, Insulza said he was not offering Britain a ``deal'' 
for his freedom. ``I would not say we are making any deals or going 
into negotiations,'' he said. ``What we have tried to present is our 
position on this matter.'' Pinochet has remained out of the public 
eye since his arrest Oct. 16 and is expected to move on Monday from 
a North London hospital where he has been recuperating from spinal 
surgery to a mansion rented by friends in a fashionable community 
in the Surrey countryside. His lawyers spent the weekend preparing 
written arguments for Jack Straw, the British home secretary, due 
by the close of business on Monday. Straw must decide whether to let 
the extradition matter go forward or allow Pinochet to leave England. 
The British government has insisted that the decision is a matter 
for the courts and that Straw, acting in a ``quasi judicial'' capacity, 
does not intend to consult prime minister Tony Blair or his Cabinet 
colleagues. Four legal grounds exist on which Straw may stop the extradition 
process at this stage: for compassion, if the crimes are not extraditable 
ones, if the document itself is faulty, and if the charges are considered 
political. Insulza saw his British counterpart, Robin Cook, on Friday 
and dropped off a letter at Blair's official residence, 10 Downing 
Street. On Saturday he held a news conference and gave radio and television 
interviews in which he argued that Britain was interrupting the progress 
of democracy and the peaceful move away from authoritarianism in Chile. 
``The Chilean people have to be allowed to judge and decide how they 
are going to deal with their past,'' he said. He also warned that 
British-Chilean trade and diplomatic relations could suffer unless 
the Pinochet impasse was resolved. ``We have been close friends and 
close allies for 175 years, and of course nobody can guarantee the 
world that will go on if this thing prolongs itself too much in time,'' 
he said. The British Foreign Office warned Britons against nonessential 
travel to Chile because of the ``highly volatile'' situation there. 
The Defense Ministry canceled the visit of the Royal Navy frigate 
Sutherland to Valparaiso, Chile's second largest city, at the suggestion 
of the Chilean authorities. ``We jointly concluded that conditions 
at the moment were no longer conducive for a visit to go ahead,'' 
a spokesman said. Britain also closed its honorary consul's office 
in the Pacific port city, but played down the seriousness of the action. 
``This is not a question of removing anybody or closing down consulate 
buildings or offices,'' a Foreign Office spokesman said. ``This person 
lives and works in the area. But her office, as far as the British 
work she does, has been closed.'' Insulza dismissed reports of possible 
danger to Britons in Chile. ``There is no question that anyone can 
travel to Chile with no problem, and there are no reports of any serious 
incidents,'' he said.
