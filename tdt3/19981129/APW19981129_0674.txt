The Libyan Lawyers' Union has created a fund to help pay for the defense 
of two Libyans charged in the 1988 Lockerbie bombing case, Egypt's 
Middle East News Agency reported Sunday. Mohammed al-Ellagi, head 
of the union, was quoted as saying that a number of Arab lawyers have 
volunteered their expertise or pledged money to help cover the legal 
costs of the suspects, Abdel Basset Ali al-Megrahi and Lamen Khalifa 
Fhimah. Al-Ellagi did not say how much money the Lawyers' Union hoped 
to collect. Libya has accepted in principle a joint U.S.-British offer 
to try the Libyans in the Netherlands under Scottish law and with 
Scottish Judges. But Tripoli still is trying to get assurances about 
the suspects' handling in the Netherlands. And, if convicted, it wants 
the men jailed in Libya rather than Scotland. The men are wanted in 
the 1988 bombing of a Pan Am flight over Lockerbie, Scotland, that 
killed 270 people. In September, Libya appointed a new legal team 
headed by Kamal Mahjoub, a former Libyan foreign minister. The defense 
team had been headed by a private attorney, Ibrahim Legwell. Lawyers 
from Egypt have said they will participate in the suspects' defense, 
and Libyan officials said attorneys also will come from Malta, the 
United States and Europe.
