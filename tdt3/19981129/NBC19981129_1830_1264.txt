Now to a battle among veterans groups in Los Angeles about how to 
best use some donated property. As NBC's Dan Lothian found, it's all 
about location. It is prime real estate owned by the federal governments 
veterans' administration -- 45 acres worth, as much as $10,000 a square 
foot, the last underdeveloped piece of land in west Los Angeles. This 
property is probably the most expensive parcel of land in southern 
california, if not the state. The question of what to do with this 
property has been requested for more than a decade. Ever since the 
Reagan administration decided to downsize the federal government, 
many organizations have been trying to get their hands on it. There 
have been plans for an ice skating rink, a football stadium and even 
condos, despite an original deed, which requires the land be used 
for the care of veterans. William belding is a former Navy seal, Vietnam 
veteran and president of an organization that would like to turn this 
land into a veterans park and ultimately part of nearby Los Angeles 
national cemetery. We think, and all the major veterans groups in 
California think that that is the most appropriate use for that land. 
We are made of one But there's opposition from a small group of veterans, 
which wants this land not for the dead but the living. There's 30,000-plus 
homeless vets on the streets of L.A. alone, so it could be best used 
for housing veterans. Or for another program like this -- nearby culinary 
arts training facility for the homeless. We need more programs, for 
there's a lot of veterans who want to get their lives together. The 
VA currently operates an oil well on the site. It produces some income. 
And a state of the art prescription drug center provides medicine 
for vets all across the west. All the veterans agree on one thing 
-- they don't want the land turned over to outside developers. It's 
up to the federal government to make the next move. That could happen 
in the next year. Dan Lothian, NBC news, Los Angeles.
