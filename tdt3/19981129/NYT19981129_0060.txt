Computer animation is pushing into new territory on the wings of an 
unlikely fleet of cartoon airplanes _ characters in a series for preschoolers 
that began Nov. 2 on the Learning Channel on cable television. Traditional 
animators who create two-dimensional characters like those in the 
shows ``South Park'' and ``Rugrats'' now routinely use computer graphics 
to replicate the hundreds of frames needed to make a character move. 
But the creators of the new show, ``Jay Jay the Jet Plane,'' are using 
an entirely different method called real-time performance animation 
in which the facial expressions of as many as seven actors are detected 
by sensors and fed into computers, giving expressive vitality to animated 
characters. The so-called digital motion-capture technique has never 
been used for an entire 24-minute show, according to Bruce Johnson, 
a former Hanna-Barbera executive who started Porchlight Entertainment 
in Los Angeles to create children's programming. ``Jay Jay'' is a 
joint venture of Porchlight, Chris Walker's Modern Cartoons and the 
character's creator, David Michel, a Dallas executive who hopes to 
convert the airplane stories he made up for his son into a licensing 
franchise. Digital motion-capture technology has existed for a decade, 
but its use has been limited to a single virtual character for video 
or CD-ROM games and for special effects in feature films, such as 
the figures who dangled from ropes in ``Titanic.'' Animated films 
like ``Antz'' from Dreamworks SKG and ``Toy Story'' from Walt Disney 
get their three-dimensional quality through the costly, time-consuming 
process of adding realistic lighting and backgrounds by computer. 
Motion-capture makes animation more affordable by speeding production 
and lowering costs; it also improves production values by giving characters 
the humanistic qualities animators strive for, said Joan Collins Carey, 
a visual-effects producer who is assembling a documentary on computer 
animation. ``The direction Chris is going is leading the rest of the 
industry,'' she said. ``This is very good for studios that want to 
kick out content.'' To orchestrate all the ``Jay Jay'' elements _ 
seven character performers, two walk-on live-action characters, miniature 
sets and seven model airplanes _ meant spending $1 million during 
the last year converting a missile plant in Oxnard, Calif., into a 
studio. Proprietary software that synchronizes 35 Compaq Alpha NT 
computers does the job. Like a situation comedy, ``Jay Jay'' uses 
several cameras that shift the audience's point of view. ``We're shooting 
11 minutes of production animation a day,'' said Douglas Rask, the 
show's producer. ``It's a volume unheard of in animation.'' Modern 
Cartoons falls short of the Holy Grail of animation: the simulation 
of human motion naturally. ``Jay Jay'' characters rely only on actors' 
faces; their bodies are airplanes. But Walker thinks the show has 
achieved a breakthrough. ``We've industrialized cartoon production 
with motion-capture,'' he said. ``I've been working toward this for 
12 years.'' The cable network, owned by Discovery Communications and 
distributed to 70 million homes, has licensed 26 episodes for each 
of three years. The partners hope to turn a profit by selling foreign 
broadcast rights and merchandising. It's a path well trod by characters 
like Barney and Teletubbies, and ``Jay Jay'' has an advantage they 
lacked. Even before his first regular series, the character was well 
known to the preschool set. In the last four years, his creator, Michel, 
has sold 250,000 ``Jay Jay'' videos that featured some of the same 
production techniques, mostly using direct-response advertising on 
two children's cable channels, Viacom's Nickelodeon and Time Warner's 
Cartoon Network. The Learning Channel ``is not a destination point 
for preschoolers,'' Michel said. ``They've made a big commitment in 
giving us a time slot.''
