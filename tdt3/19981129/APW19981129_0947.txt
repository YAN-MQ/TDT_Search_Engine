It's called the January Theory, and it holds that the lockout in the 
American National Basketball Association will last at least another 
five weeks. ``It could be that they don't meet for another month,'' 
player agent Steve Kauffman said Sunday. ``I've been telling my players 
for the past couple of weeks that they shouldn't expect to play until 
mid-January at the earliest.'' With negotiations stalled and the players 
believing the club owners are trying to further test their resolve, 
it appears that NBA commissioner David Stern is following a lockout 
calendar similar to the one employed by the North American National 
Hockey League during its 1994-95 lockout, which wasn't settled until 
Jan. 13. The ice hockey lockout included a period from Dec. 6-Jan. 
7 in which no talks were held. The sides then made ``final'' offers 
and ``final-final'' offers before a marathon negotiating session settled 
it. It would take another three weeks of lockout limbo to match that 
month lull. So far, the sides in the NBA dispute have gone 10 days 
since their last full bargaining session, and that 9 1-2-hour meeting 
was the only one the sides had in November. Currently, the owners 
and players are at odds over whether there will be preconditions for 
a resumption. About 120 players participated in a conference call 
Saturday and were brought up to date on the stalemate, a union spokesman 
said. Monday will mark the second missed payday for the players, and 
a new month will begin Tuesday with the outlook bleak. Millions of 
dollars have been lost, the fans are upset and the long-term damage 
could be worse than expected. Stern and deputy commissioner Russ Granik 
have staunchly refused to set a ``drop dead'' date for saving the 
season, although they have alluded to mid-December being the date. 
That vague deadline could be extended, however, if Stern backs off 
his insistence upon having the deal put on paper and ratified _ a 
process that could take 2-3 weeks _ before the lockout would be lifted. 
``If they back off that 2-3 weeks, it's a different story. Then the 
January theory makes a lot of sense,'' said Kauffman, who represents 
19 players. ``And remember, we can go from a doomsday scenario to 
a settlement in a matter of 2-3 days.'' The lockout is essentially 
a strike by the owners. Under American labor law, without a contract 
_ or in this case a collective bargaining agreement, owners can prohibit 
_ or lock out _ players from working until a deal is reached. The 
collective bargaining agreement (CBA) is the ground rules which sets 
things like minimum salaries, pension and health insurance benefits, 
roster limits and a salary cap. The biggest issue in this work stoppage 
is the owners insistence on maximum salary costs and the union's refusal 
to accept a ``hard'' salary cap. The league has a limit each team 
can spend on salaries, but the so-called ``Larry Bird'' exemption 
allows clubs to disregard the cap to re-sign their own free agents. 
It virtually makes the salary cap an invisible ceiling. Stern and 
Granik have said four weeks would be needed from the time a deal was 
reached until the season could begin, but in reality that window could 
be shrunk to three weeks _ and maybe as few as 18-20 days _ to allow 
for free agent signings, trades and training camps to take place. 
Each team would then be able to play a 46- or 48-game season, but 
only if two weeks were added on to the end of the regular season in 
April.
