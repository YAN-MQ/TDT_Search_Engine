It's the busiest traveled weekend of the year. Today, Americans are 
returning from grandmother's house, but it's not exactly "over the 
river and through the Woods" anymore. Here's ABC's Karla Davis. a 
record 33.6 million, Americans have traveled more than 100 miles this 
Thanksgiving and most, from the midwest to the south to the northeast, 
are making their way back home today. I was expecting a lot of people, 
because everybody's coming back from thanksgiving vacation. But there 
weren't that many people to my surprise. The American automobile association 
says the drop in gasoline prices makes this the cheapest highway travel 
has been in nearly a decade. That made it possible for more people 
to pack up the car and hit the road for the holiday. I probably saved 
around $40, $60 in gas altogether. Good weather has made this holiday 
trek much easier, on the roads and in the skies. A quarter million 
people are moving through Chicago's O'hare airport today. An estimated 
6 million air travelers nationwide are winging their way home. Those 
traveling by rail packed Amtrak trains from Washington's union station 
to Philadelphia's 30th street station. I tried to buy reserved, but 
I couldn't get the tickets. They were sold out. Amtrak travel is up 
5% from last year. More than a half million people are expected to 
climb aboard over the entire holiday weekend. Another factor making 
today's travel a little better, more Americans have postponed their 
return trip until tomorrow. Amtrak says its return bookings for Monday 
are way up, because more people have decided to take one more day 
off to avoid the crowds. Karla Davis, ABC News, Washington.
