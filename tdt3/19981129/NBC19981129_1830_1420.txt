From Washington tonight -- word of a coming crackdown on hospitals 
which delay or deny medical care while checking whether a patient's 
insurance will pay for the procedure. A federal law enacted 12 years 
ago forbids emergency rooms from refusing to examine or stabilize 
patients who can't pay. There are plans now to expand the rule to 
ensure immediate care whether the patient's insurer provides coverage 
or not.
