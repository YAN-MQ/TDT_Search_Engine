For a month or so, the Mets and the Baltimore Orioles have talked 
about a possible deal for Mets catcher Todd Hundley. But now, instead 
of being trading partners, they have a growing rivalry as they compete 
for the same free agents, Robin Ventura and B.J. Surhoff. The teams 
had both made offers to Surhoff, who is scheduled to visit the Mets 
Tuesday, but during the weekend the Orioles threw their money into 
the ring for Ventura, too. The Mets had offered Ventura, a 31-year-old 
third baseman, $28 million for four years; the Orioles raised them 
by about $1 million a year. Ventura is believed to be looking for 
more than that. The Orioles also enhanced their offer to Surhoff. 
They did not guarantee a fourth year, which the Mets have not done 
either, but the Orioles made it possible for the fourth year to become 
guaranteed depending on the number of games he starts. The Pittsburgh 
Pirates have offered Surhoff, 34, four guaranteed years, and that 
is what he would like from the Orioles and the Mets, too. The Orioles' 
Ventura initiative is intriguing because if they sign him, Cal Ripken 
Jr. _ who in 1997 switched from a permanent spot at shortstop to third 
base _ would move to first base. A club official said that the possibility 
had been discussed with Ripken and that he would be reluctantly amenable 
to a switch. If the Mets signed Ventura, it would also necessitate 
a switch. Edgardo Alfonzo would move to second base from third base. 
Until the Orioles stepped up, only the Mets had made a serious offer 
for Ventura, who came back this year from a broken leg and hit 21 
home runs and drove in 91 runs for the Chicago White Sox. Since the 
Orioles made their offer, Ventura's agent, John Boggs, has spoken 
with Steve Phillips, the Mets' general manager, to determine what 
the Mets' next move, if any, will be. The Mets have not indicated 
that they would sign both Ventura and Surhoff, but the Orioles are 
prepared to do that. The Orioles would also sign Surhoff, who has 
played for them the last three years, even if they reach agreement 
with Albert Belle, which they expect to do in the next couple of days. 
Belle would play left field and Surhoff would move to right. What 
the Orioles will not do is sign both Ventura and Rafael Palmeiro, 
their free-agent first baseman. They have offered Palmeiro $45 million 
for five years, but he has not indicated a desire to accept it. If 
they do a deal with Ventura first, Palmeiro will be gone. As for the 
prospects of a Hundley trade, a Baltimore official said that the Orioles 
understood the Mets were talking to the Los Angeles Dodgers and may 
trade Hundley there. The Mets apparently want more from the Orioles 
than Baltimore is willing to give. The Dodgers have talked to the 
Orioles about Charles Johnson, the Dodgers' catcher, but the Orioles 
are not sure they want to make that trade either. It would depend 
on what players they would have to give up.
