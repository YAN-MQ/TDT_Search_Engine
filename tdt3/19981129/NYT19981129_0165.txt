The riverfront land that is to be the site of a stadium for the New 
England Patriots is contaminated with toxic materials, regulators 
said Sunday, which could threaten the state's promise to have the 
football field ready in 2001. Federal regulators said the site along 
the Connecticut River contained toxic leftovers from a former coal 
gasification plant and from yards where barges unloaded coal for other 
plants on the site in the 1800s. John DeVillars, the Environmental 
Protection Agency's administrator for New England, said the stadium 
site had ``fairly significant contamination,'' including coal tar, 
hydrocarbons and volatile organic compounds, but could be cleaned 
up. ``It's simply a question of time and money, not a question of 
whether or not the project can go forward,'' he said. Devillars said 
that the project would require at least three federal and state environmental 
approvals, and that the stadium developers must compile and submit 
an environmental impact report, which can be a lengthy process. For 
the first time, a Patriots official signaled flexibility Sunday about 
the deal, which had been presented to legislators as all but a take-it-or-leave-it 
proposition. ``The timetable is very important to us,'' said Andy 
Wasynczuk, the team's vice president for business operations. Speaking 
of the environmental issues at the site, he added: ``Our hope and 
expectation is to be ready for 2001. But we obviously are going to 
need to respect the seriousness of these things, and work through 
them as they come up. We can't expect this thing to be clear sailing 
from the beginning to the end.'' Officials said the process could 
be delayed further by a civil rights complaint against the state Department 
of Environmental Protection that is now being reviewed by the EPA. 
The complaint was filed by neighbors of a Hartford landfill where 
deposits from a $1 billion redevelopment project already planned for 
the site were to be dumped. The redevelopment project, Adriaen's Landing, 
includes a hotel and convention center in addition to the stadium. 
The president of the state Senate, Kevin Sullivan of West Hartford, 
has been an enthusiastic backer of the stadium project, but he said 
the environmental question was one of several that had caught legislative 
leaders off guard. ``I was told face to face by the governor's negotiators, 
`The site is clean,''' he said. The announced cost for the stadium 
project was $350 million. But state legislators, who would have to 
approve the deal, have been told that the price, allowing for inflation, 
is expected to be $375 million. Analysts have scoffed at Gov. John 
G. Rowland's claim that the stadium can be built at no cost to taxpayers. 
The new expenses seem likely to add to legislators' skepticism as 
they head toward a special session of the Connecticut General Assembly 
on Dec. 15, when a vote on the deal is to be taken. Rowland remained 
optimistic _ even ebullient _ as he discussed the stadium in an interview 
after showing off the Christmas decorations at the Executive Residence 
on Sunday. He acknowledged that the project faced complications, but 
he said all of them had been anticipated. ``People feel we can work 
these issues out,'' he said. ``In a worst-case scenario, would it 
be a different location? It's possible.'' The governor said that in 
response to the concerns of legislators, he hoped to add to the contract 
a significant penalty or ``exit fee'' _ perhaps $10 million _ if the 
Patriots were to leave the stadium before the 30-year lease ended. 
There could be two other hurdles, according to Hartford and state 
officials. A plant that now operates on the site, supplying steam 
to downtown office buildings, would have to be moved, and the plant's 
owner, C.T.G. Resources Inc., said the cost would be about $100 million. 
And lawyers for the state are looking into the possibility that because 
of the deal's structure, the bonds that would be sold to finance the 
stadium might not be tax-exempt, increasing the state's cost of borrowing 
the money. The tax-exempt status of the bonds could be jeopardized 
under federal law, state officials said, because more than 10 percent 
of the project might be paid back by a private business _ in this 
case, a ticket tax that the Patriots would pay the state. If the bonds 
were not tax-exempt, the state would have to pay a higher interest 
rate. Marc Ryan, secretary of the Connecticut Office of Policy and 
Management, said the state's bond lawyers believed that at least a 
major part of the bond issue would be tax-exempt. ``That is clearly 
a major issue for us,'' he said.
