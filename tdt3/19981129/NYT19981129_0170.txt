The New York Times said in an editorial for Monday, Nov. 30: Forecasts 
of a cold winter add a measure of urgency to this year's New York 
Cares Coat Drive, which starts tomorrow. This valuable charitable 
program, now in its 10th season, collects ``gently used'' adult and 
child-sized winter coats for distribution to the homeless, the elderly 
poor and needy youngsters in New York and New Jersey. Before the drive 
ends on Dec. 31, its organizers hope to collect more than 85,000 usable 
parkas and overcoats. The need is great, and it is easy for people 
lucky enough to own extra coats to share with those who cannot afford 
even one. For those wishing to make a donation, the drop-off sites 
include all police stations in New York City, all Con Edison business 
offices in the city and Westchester County and all Blockbuster Video 
stores in the city, Long Island and New Jersey. Other sites include 
all Loews/Sony theaters and NCA dry cleaners in New York City and 
New Jersey, and Home Depot stores in the city, Long Island and Westchester. 
On weekdays from 7:30 to 9:30 a.m., coats can be deposited at Grand 
Central Terminal near the 42nd Street and Vanderbilt Avenue entrance, 
and at the Amtrak concourse entrance and the Long Island Rail Road 
level in Penn Station. Those wishing more information about making 
a donation or setting up a drop-off site may call (212) 223-CARE.
