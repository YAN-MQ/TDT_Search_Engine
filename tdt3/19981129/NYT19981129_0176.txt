On the Sunday after Thanksgiving, the archbishop of Honduras said 
he had come to St. Patrick's Cathedral mainly to give thanks. But 
in his chronicle of the devastation a hurricane called Mitch had wrought 
on his country, Archbishop Oscar Rodriguez Maradiaga made one thing 
plain: the time for giving was not over. With bridges and highways 
washed away, crops destroyed and disease spreading quickly among the 
very poor, he said, the wrath of Hurricane Mitch was not likely to 
end anytime soon. ``In two days, we went backwards 50 years,'' he 
said. Barely a month after the hurricane, the deadliest natural disaster 
to strike Central America this century, killed more than 10,000 people 
in Honduras and Nicaragua, the archbishop said the planes bearing 
food and relief supplies from abroad were coming less and less often 
_ ``I would say rather seldom.'' The appeal by the archbishop, who 
spoke on Sunday morning, was followed in the afternoon by that of 
Bishop Leopoldo Brenes of Nicaragua. A collection was taken up on 
Sunday for Central American flood relief; so far, the New York Archdiocese 
has distributed about $3.75 million in food, medicine, water and clothing. 
As residents of Tegucigalpa, the capital of Honduras, braced for another 
round of rain and flooding, Rodriguez stressed that the need for immediate 
short-term relief remained. Bodies were still being pulled from under 
the wreckage, he said, with some 7,000 Hondurans confirmed dead and 
another 8,000 missing. In Tegucigalpa alone, he said, more than 150,000 
people remained homeless and the city's poorest neighborhoods lacked 
potable water. Cases of dengue and typhoid have been reported, he 
said, and hepatitis and malaria, chronic health concerns in Honduras, 
have worsened. The archbishop said people were afraid to eat meat 
for fear of what the surviving livestock may have eaten. The archbishop 
urged officials in Washington to consider giving temporary legal status 
to illegal Honduran immigrants working in this country.
