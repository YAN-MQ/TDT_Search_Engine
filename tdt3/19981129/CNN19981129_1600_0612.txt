Gene therapy is showing promise in treating a number of diseases. 
Now, scientists are applying that technology to fight baldness. Dr. 
Steve Salvatore reports. The newest baldness study turns conventional 
wisdom on its head. Researchers at the University of Chicago's Howard 
Hughes medical institute experimented with mice. When it comes to 
skin problems, a lot of what's found in mice applies to people. And 
they found that bald mice can grow new hair follicles. We've always 
been told that you're born with a fixed number of hair follicles, 
and that you can never grow them again in adult life. This study would 
suggest that we now have the capability to do that. What caused the 
bald mice to grow hair is a protein called beta catenin. Beta catenin 
has the ability to stimulate the formation of new hair follicles, 
a process that normally takes place in development and one which can 
be induced in adult skin. There are dangers to consider. You can actually 
go too far and cause the cells to grow too much. So you want to turn 
on these genes for a short enough time to grow a Follicle, and then 
turn them back off. And that could cause the development of tumors. 
Scientists say more research is needed. We still need to understand 
how this molecule is regulated inside the cell of the developing hair 
follicle to really take it to the level of clinical application. Many 
consider baldness to be a man's problem. And it's not surprising, 
with 50% of men over age 50 experiencing some kind of male pattern 
baldness. But there are many different types of baldness that can 
affect women and even children. The researchers say their finding 
may not be able to help everyone. For those people who are born bald 
or very soon become bald, I would say that this finding may not have 
clinical application. So for now, if you're bald, you're going to 
have to be patient. Dr. Steve Salvatore, CNN, New York.
