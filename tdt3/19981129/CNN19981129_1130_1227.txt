Matt Yallof, "CNN Headline Sports." Thanksgiving weekend wraps up 
with six early games in the NFL today. Jake Plummer and Arizona can 
move within one game of first-place Dallas if they beat the troubled 
chiefs. Dan Reeves will make a gametime decision on injured qb Chris 
Chandler. The falcons face the Rams. Carolina at the jets. Indy visits 
Baltimore. The jags can go two up on the steelers in the central by 
beating the bengals. And pride on the line for the Bucs as they face 
the last-place bears. All other games, late starts.
