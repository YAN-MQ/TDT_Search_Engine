Voters in Switzerland have overwhelmingly rejected a ballot proposal 
to legalize illicit drugs, everything from marijuana to heroin. Supporters 
argued it would eliminate the criminal activity associated with the 
drug trade. But opponents said it would turn Switzerland into a drug 
haven. Sanjay Singh reports. With an estimated 30,000 hard drug users, 
Switzerland has one of the highest rates of narcotic addiction in 
Europe. That statistic was something which the pro-drugs legalization 
lobby hoped would convince voters to decriminalize the use of drugs, 
their reasoning being that many drug users get their supplies from 
the streets, and ceasing to make it a criminal offense by selling 
drugs from state-run pharmacies or outlets would in fact bring drug 
abuse down. I think that it's a good initiative. I think that you 
will have to get rid of drug traffickers and, like that, drug trade 
will be run bureaucratically and will be under control. I think that 
it's stupid to penalize the drug takers who are dependant on drugs. 
One should be helping them. I voted against the referendum because 
I think it just goes too far. The referendum on drugs was launched 
by a committee of drug policy experts, doctors and lawyers. It was 
backed by leftist politicians and the youth chapters of two conservative 
parties in Switzerland. The proposal, which gathered 100,000 signatures, 
called for anyone over the age of 18 to be allowed to legally buy 
the drug of their choice, from marijuana to heroin. A government program 
is already in place that authorizes distribution of heroin to long-term 
addicts as a first step towards rehabilitation. But while the heroin 
program led to a huge cut in crime, misery and death associated with 
hard-core drug use, not all medical experts were convinced that legalizing 
drugs in Switzerland would do the same. The main problem I have is 
that with legalization, the level or the point of entry would be much 
easier, in particular for adolescents. And being the father of adolescents, 
I'm very much against that. For now, the majority of those who voted 
in the Sunday referendum appear to agree with the government that 
legalizing drugs would be a bad idea. And they're not totally convinced 
that killing the illicit street market in drugs would mean a decline 
in overall drug use. Sanjay Singh, "Headline News."
