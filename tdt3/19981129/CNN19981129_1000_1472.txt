A Scottish businesswoman is dreaming rather intensely of a white Christmas. 
Now that she's plunked down,000 small bets that they'll get one. She 
will collect more than $84,000 from a booky if even one snow flake 
falls on Christmas day. She works for a promotion company and plans 
to distribute the betting slips to business contacts so they would 
all get the share the winnings. The odds are 10-1 against her.
