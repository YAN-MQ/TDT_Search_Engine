Britain denied Sunday that it is negotiating a deal to free Gen. Augusto 
Pinochet in return for a pledge from Chile to strip the former dictator 
of immunity and made him stand trial at home on charges of genocide 
and torture. A spokesman for Home Secretary Jack Straw, who has until 
Dec. 11 to decide whether to block proceedings to extradite Pinochet 
to Spain, said the decision would be based on judicial, not political 
grounds. ``We are not negotiating a deal,'' said a Home Office spokesman, 
speaking on customary condition of anonymity. ``The Home Secretary 
will consider what decision he will take in his role as quasi-judicial 
arbiter under the terms of the Extradition Act.'' Meanwhile, the tug-of-war 
over 83-year-old Pinochet intensified with human rights activists 
dismissing as a ``cruel joke'' on victims the virtual pledges by Chilean 
Foreign Minister Jose Miguel Insulza to have general tried. Two British 
newspapers, The Sunday Times and The Observer, reported Sunday that 
Britain and Chile are close to a compromise deal. The argument underlined 
the dilemma for Straw since a ruling last week by Britain's highest 
court, the House of Lords, that Pinochet has no immunity from arrest. 
He was arrested Oct. 16 on a Spanish warrant during a regular visit 
to London. A Chilean government report says some 3,000 people were 
killed or disappeared at the hands of Pinochet's secret police during 
his 1973-1990 rule after he toppled an elected Marxist president. 
However, the Chilean government wants him back because it is fearful 
that fury among Pinochet supporters threatens the country's new democracy. 
If Straw blocks extradition, the Labor Party government will likely 
attract international criticism, as well as provoking outrage among 
many rank-and-file Labor legislators. If he allows the proceedings 
to go ahead, it will upset relations with Chile, a trading partner 
and a longtime ally. Insulza, himself an exile during Pinochet's rule, 
acknowledged Sunday that coming to Britain and Spain to lobby for 
the general was ``not an easy job.'' ``My feelings toward him are 
not very favorable. Unfortunately this is not the point,'' Insulza 
said on Sky TV. Insulza has said 14 law suits are pending against 
Pinochet in Chile and that he has no immunity. He said Sunday the 
Chilean government ``will do even more to make sure the investigation 
goes forward.'' However, Pinochet granted himself immunity while in 
power, and also has immunity as a senator-for-life. He remained commander-in-chief 
of the army until March. The New York-based group Human Rights Watch 
said only Chile's supreme court could remove Pinochet's immunity, 
was very unlikely to do so, and even if it did, Pinochet would probably 
go before a court of military supporters he appointed. ``When you 
add these things up, there is virtually no chance he will be prosecuted 
and absolutely no chance he would actually be convicted,'' Human Rights 
Watch spokesman Reed Brody told The Associated Press. Pinochet remained 
under police guard at a north London hospital where he has recuperated 
from back surgery. Some lawyers argue that unless Straw blocks extradition 
on compassionate grounds _ Pinochet's age and physical or mental condition 
_ he is obliged to send him to Spain in terms of the extradition agreements 
and a U.N. convention outlawing torture wherever it takes place.
