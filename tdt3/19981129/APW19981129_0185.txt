Five Russian policemen were shot and killed Sunday in Dagestan by 
gunmen who opened fire from across the border with neighboring Chechnya, 
a police official said. Another officer was wounded in the attack 
Sunday morning, regional police spokesman Magoumed Khanov said. He 
said the officers were part of a mobile force on patrol near the Chechen 
border when they were ambushed. The southern Russian republic has 
been plagued by violence spilling over from Chechnya, which fought 
a bloody independence war with Russia in 1994-96, as well as by its 
own conflicts among various religious and ethnic groups battling for 
power.
