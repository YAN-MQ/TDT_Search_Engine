Cellular phones are becoming a Ringing success in Romania. And the 
new technology has had a beneficial side effect on the country's health 
care. Allard beutel explains. Marius filip is an orthopedic surgeon 
who works at University hospital in bucharest, Romania. It's one of 
the country's most modern government-run medical facilities, but it's 
far below the standard of major western countries. So filip contacted 
a cellular telephone company in Romania called connex and made an 
offer. It couldn't refuse. In return, those doctors are on call 24/7 
to all connex employees. It's cutting time and money. It's going very 
fast, connects people very quickly, and we can give them a Diagnosis 
and treatment in a very short period of time. He hopes his plan will 
help encourage international confidence in romania. But that change 
won't come easily of the this Belgian couple decided to be airlifted 
back home for the wife's reconstructive surgery rather than be treated 
in Romania. Seeing all the patients in the corridors, I assume they're 
a little bit overwhelmed. I never seen so many people in a hospital. 
But people at connex are very happy with their medical treatment at 
University hospital. This connex employee says his level of care was 
a lot different before joining the company. First of all, you had 
to wait a long time to find out where to go and who to see. And secondly, 
you had to pay for good quality medical services. For decades, it's 
been difficult for romanians to get telephone service. Cell phone 
companies now are changing that. With our connex go, you can walk 
in and get a package and hookup immediately. And immediacy through 
technology is at the heart of this cell phone arrangement. Dr. filip 
says the program is working so well, they're considering plans to 
open it to other companies and the public. Allard beutel, CNN.
