With stunning defeat in state elections casting a shadow on his government, 
Prime Minister Atal Bihari Vajpayee reassured foreign business Sunday 
that political shakeups would not affect planned measures to open 
markets. ``The volatility of Indian democracy will have no fundamental 
impact on the process of economic reforms in the country,'' Vajpayee 
told hundreds of Indian and foreign business leaders at an economic 
summit organized by the World Economic Forum. The government had ``depoliticized 
the economic agenda,'' he said. Vajpayee's Bharatiya Janata Party 
suffered a series of embarrassing setbacks in the state elections 
_ losing hold of governments in New Delhi, site of the federal capital, 
and the western Rajasthan state. The BJP also failed to dislodge the 
ruling Congress Party in the central state of Madhya Pradesh.
