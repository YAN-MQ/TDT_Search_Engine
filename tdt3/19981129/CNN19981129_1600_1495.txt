Forget tooling around Malibu with Ken in a convertible. This year, 
Barbie's preferred mode of transportation is a Harley. Mattel is offering 
a limited-edition Harley-Davidson Barbie outfitted in a Leather jacket, 
goggles, gloves, chaps and boots. Harley-Davidson provided 20 dolls 
to each of its dealerships to sell at $60 each. Most have been sold 
already. Buyers have ranged from grandmothers to Harley memorabilia 
collectors.
