Per Elofsson, a 21-year newcomer, passed Tor Arne Hetland of Norway 
during the last kilometer and gave Sweden victory Sunday in the season's 
first cross-country ski World Cup relay. Elofsson finished 0.8 seconds 
ahead of Hetland after trailing almost a minute going out on the last 
10-kilometer leg in the 4x10K freestyle relay. In the women's 4x5 
kilometer relay, Russia's foursome of Olga Danilova, Anfisa Resztsova, 
Larisa Lazutina and Nina Gavrilyuk was superior. Stefania Belmondo 
lifted Italy past Norway's Maj Helen Sorkmo before the finish to take 
second. Elofsson, a world junior champion, won the men's individual 
10K freestyle Saturday ahead of Norway's Bjorn Dahlie, the world's 
greatest winter Olympian. On Sunday, Norway placed Dahlie on the third 
leg in order to build up an advantage for Hetland. But Elofsson came 
from a 53-second deficit to win for his team, for which Anders Bergstrom, 
Magnus Ingesson and Mathias Fredriksson skied the other legs.
