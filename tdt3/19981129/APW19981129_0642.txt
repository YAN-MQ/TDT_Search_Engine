Heeding government warnings against turning their pristine Alpine 
nation into a drug haven, Swiss voters Sunday threw out proposals 
to legalize consumption of heroin and other narcotics. Some 74 percent 
of voters rejected the proposed constitutional amendment that ``the 
consumption, cultivation or possession of drugs, and their acquisition 
for personal use, is not punishable.'' The results were released by 
the Federal Chancellory, which is collating the results from each 
canton. ``I'm very satisfied. It's an endorsement of government policy,'' 
declared Interior Minister Ruth Dreifuss, who has introduced measures 
to give heroin to long-term addicts. The pro-legalization lobby said 
it was disappointed that only 26 percent backed it, but vowed to press 
ahead with a campaign to decriminalize marijuana and other so-called 
soft drugs. Last year the Swiss achieved overwhelmingly voted in favor 
of state distribution of heroin to addicts. Government studies showed 
this cut crime and misery associated with the drug scene. At the same 
time as helping addicts, authorities tried to clamp down on dealing 
and close once notorious open drug scenes in Zurich and other cities. 
Dreifuss and other ministers said the legalization plan was a health 
risk and would turn Switzerland into a haven for drug tourists and 
traffickers and anger neighboring European countries. Church groups, 
police chiefs, social workers, doctors and other professionals working 
with addicts held similar views. ``The outcome shows that the Swiss 
population rejects extreme solutions to the drug problem,'' said Felix 
Gutwiller, a pioneer of the heroin distribution program. No other 
European nation, not even the relatively liberal Netherlands, has 
legalized the possession or sale of any drugs or has plans to do so. 
Switzerland has an estimated 30,000 drug addicts in its population 
of 7 million _ one of Europe's highest rates. A government survey 
published last week showed a rise in cannabis consumption. It revealed 
that 27 percent of people aged 15-39 said they had smoked cannabis 
at least once. This compared with 16 percent in 1992. Given Switzerland's 
pioneering role on drug issues, the vote was closely watched in other 
countries. ``People around the world should keep their eye on Switzerland 
as it's done a good job of showing the proper path for policy reform,'' 
said Ethan Nadelmann, director of the New York based Lindesmith Center 
Drug Policy Unit, which favors more relaxed laws. To the government's 
relief, 64 percent of voters gave the go-ahead to a finance package 
of 30.5 billion francs (dlrs 22.1 billion) to link Switzerland to 
Europe's high speed train network and build two vast Alpine rail tunnels. 
This is key to a planned transport accord between the European Union 
and non-member Switzerland. EU ministers meet Monday for more discussions 
on the deal. Under the Swiss system, 100,000 signatures on a petition 
is enough to force a referendum. The electorate thus goes to the polls 
three or four times a year, and turnout was only 37 percent.
