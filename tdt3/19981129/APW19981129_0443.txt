A Hong Kong company is suing Lufthansa's in-flight caterer for allegedly 
providing it substandard meals _ including one said to have contained 
a cockroach, local newspapers reported Sunday. LSG Lufthansa Service 
Hong Kong began providing pre-cooked box lunches this summer to Nutritional 
Food Production Ltd., which supplies lunches to elementary and high 
schools, the Chinese-language Ming Pao said. But the meals delivered 
were too small and of ``substandard or unacceptable quality'' according 
to a High Court document filed against the German-based caterer, the 
paper said. Some contained sand, pencil lead and wood chips, and a 
cockroach was found in one meal, it said. Lufthansa did not immediately 
return a call for comment Sunday. Officials at the caterer were not 
available for comment either. Nutritional Food Production claimed 
it had lost contracts totaling 11 million Hong Kong dollars (U.S. 
dlrs 5.6 million), the report said. It is seeking 3.3 million Hong 
Kong dollars (U.S. dlrs 423,000) in estimated lost gross profits and 
an unspecified amount in damages, it said.
