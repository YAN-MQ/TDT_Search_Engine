Russia produced 43 percent less wheat this year than in 1997, but 
still has enough to feed its people next year, a news agency reported 
Sunday. The report corresponds to previous government estimates that 
the Russian grain crop would be down sharply this year because of 
drought and other problems. However, it raises questions about the 
need for food aid that the Russian government has agreed to receive 
from the United States and the European Union. The U.S. aid is to 
include 1.7 million tons of wheat. Interfax, citing an unidentified 
Agriculture and Food Ministry official, said Russia had harvested 
25.6 million tons of wheat this year, has 5 million tons left on farms 
and 4.8 million tons left over from last year's bumper crop _ a total 
of 35.4 million tons. The government estimates that the country needs 
25.7 million tons for food and 9.4 million tons for animal fodder, 
or a total of 35.1 million tons. That would appear to leave a surplus 
of 300,000 tons. However, U.S. officials have said too little of Russia's 
grain reserves are of sufficient quality for human consumption, and 
that some of the Russian grain will be exported to surrounding countries 
_ exports that the United States considers vital to Russia's economy.
