To many Americans, the name Ira Magaziner is synonymous with the ill-fated 
Clinton health care plan. But the presidential adviser's more lasting 
legacy may prove to be the administration's laissez-faire policy on 
Internet commerce: no taxes, no government regulations. As Magaziner 
prepares to take leave of the White House, President Clinton and Vice 
President Al Gore are scheduled to release with great fanfare on Monday 
a long-awaited report by Magaziner's interagency working group in 
electronic commerce. The report _ the foundation of the administration's 
new Internet commerce policy _ argues for stronger consumer protection 
and privacy rights, but like Magaziner's 1997 ``Framework for Electronic 
Commerce,'' it clings to the insistence that these be achieved through 
self-regulation by industries rather than dictated by the government. 
``Self-regulation in the digital age will require the private sector 
to engage in much greater collective action to set and enforce rules 
than was characteristic of the Industrial Age,'' the report states. 
Not everyone agrees with that theme, particularly as it relates to 
consumers. One of Magaziner's most vocal critics, Marc Rotenberg of 
the Electronic Privacy Information Center, is among those who say 
that ``self-regulation has been a lot of smoke and mirrors.'' Rotenberg 
insists that laws are needed to protect consumer interests and personal 
data in the young and often free-for-all atmosphere of cyberspace. 
Without such laws, he warns, the United States will open itself to 
a trade war with Europe, where self-regulation has been declared incompatible 
with laws guaranteeing strong privacy protections for consumers. The 
European law, which took effect in October, prohibits any company 
that does business in the European Union from transmitting personal 
data to any nation that does not guarantee comparable privacy protections. 
Magaziner concedes, ``If self-regulation is not working at the end 
of the year, then I would advocate that government do more.'' On the 
other hand, he adds: ``I would point out that just passing laws is 
still not protecting privacy. You still have to put in place an enforcement 
mechanism and demonstrate that you can enforce the law. So I think 
it might be fairer for critics to say that no country has found a 
way to do this adequately.'' Dave Farber, a professor of computer 
science at the University of Pennsylvania and a board member of the 
Internet civil liberties group the Electronic Frontier Foundation, 
says the fact that the United States has won a reprieve from the European 
Union while both sides search for mutually acceptable privacy protections 
is a credit to Magaziner. Calling the differences over privacy ``a 
real nightmare,'' Farber said: ``I think what he has done has kept 
us from falling off an edge of a cliff. October came and we are still 
doing business.'' Beyond consumer issues, the report tries to head 
off moves by the Federal Communications Commission to regulate high-speed 
Internet access in the United States. ``There are rumblings about 
the FCC wanting to regulate advanced services,'' Magaziner said. ``We 
want to make it clear that we think this would be a mistake.'' The 
report also calls for a series of programs intended to spread the 
Internet to developing countries quickly, using low-orbit satellite 
links in areas that lack telephone service; to help small businesses 
use the Internet, and to update the government's statistical and economic 
models to help better measure the economic impact of information technology 
industries. A final report on the administration's _ and Magaziner's 
_ headway on cyberspace issues, the document details treaties signed 
and laws passed in the last 18 months to keep the Internet tax free 
and unregulated and to encourage electronic commerce with new digital 
copyright and security protections. Those successes, said Harris Miller, 
president of the Information Technology Association of America, a 
trade organization, show that Magaziner proved to be ``a pivotal leader 
at a pivotal time.'' His most important contribution, Miller said, 
was ``the idea that the Internet and electronic commerce are not going 
to be like traditional industries in the sense that they need to be 
heavily regulated from birth.'' While even an outspoken critic like 
Rotenberg gives Magaziner ``a lot of credit for his energy, his smarts, 
and his ability to create a coherent vision for the administration,'' 
he added, ``At the end of the day, it can be fairly asked whether 
the administration's policy was based on self-regulation or on promoting 
business interests.'' The paradox is that such criticism is the antithesis 
of widespread criticism of the plan for a heavily regulated national 
health care system that Magaziner and Hillary Rodham Clinton proposed 
during the president's first term. Where the Internet policy is seen 
as laissez-faire, the health care plan was criticized as government 
meddling. And shaping Internet policy has been a comparatively low-key 
effort, consensus driven and largely devoid of the partisan politics 
that Magaziner largely blames for the health care plan's demise. It 
was also an effort that began almost accidentally, without any preconceived 
political notions or agendas, he said. ``Initially, when health care 
failed, I actually offered to resign,'' Magaziner said in an interview 
over the weekend. ``The president said no. He suggested that I do 
something in a different area _ not in health care because Hillary 
and I had both become radioactive on that subject.'' So in 1995, Magaziner 
recalled, he and the late commerce secretary, Ron Brown, and Mickey 
Kantor began holding hearings around the country to develop an economic 
development strategy. ``There really was almost no electronic commerce 
on the Internet then,'' Magaziner said. ``But it became very clear 
to me that if we set the right environment, the Internet and electronic 
commerce were going to explode.'' He added: ``When I presented that, 
to be honest, I think a number of people didn't understand. But the 
president did.'' Magaziner then set out to formulate a new policy 
for the administration and to sell those goals domestically and abroad. 
``Initially, there was suspicion of the United States and the fact 
that the Internet started here and that somehow we were trying to 
use this whole policy to further the American agenda around the world,'' 
he said. Eventually, he said, the ``principles we began espousing 
spread around the world.'' On an issue even more contentious than 
electronic commerce, Magaziner recently wrapped up an agreement for 
turning over administration of the Internet's addressing system, which 
has historically been managed by government contractors, to a private, 
nonprofit corporation _ a big step in Internet self- governance. Now, 
Magaziner says he feels his role is played out. ``We accomplished 
more than the goals we set out for,'' he said. ``I think it is a good 
time to return to private life.'' After wrapping up his White House 
duties in the next few days, he will join his wife and three children 
in Rhode Island and decide what the future holds for him professionally. 
``I think he did a very good job,'' said Farber of the Electronic 
Frontier Foundation. ``He was very visible to the Internet community. 
He tried very hard to get into the culture. He got online. He traveled. 
He felt he had to meet these people.'' In the end, Farber said: ``He 
probably decided the whole Internet community is wacko. And it probably 
is.''
