The battle inside the Beltway on how to punish the president for the 
lewinsky affair. There's an emerging sense in house that we can honorably

idea, without admission on president's part, is political copout. 
Yasser Arafat's fundraising drive in the United States -- what he 
calls investing in peace. And the 10-year search for justice in the 
bombing of Pan Am Flight 103. The bombing suspects are in Libya. Now
