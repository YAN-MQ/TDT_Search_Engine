Jeff Archibald edged Nicolas Huet by five hundredths of a second Sunday 
in a Snowboard World Cup giant slalom to pick up his first career 
victory and move atop the season standings. Italy's Margerita Parini 
won the women's race, taking a commanding lead of nearly two seconds 
after the first run and holding off Olympic champion Karine Ruby in 
the second. Archibald, of Ogden, Utah, and France's Huet shared the 
provisional lead after both clocking 56.30 seconds in the men's first 
run, but the American's second run of 55.80 was just enough to give 
him the win. Richard Richardson of Sweden finished third in the season's 
third giant slalom at this resort in Italy's western Alps with a total 
time of 1:52.33, 0.23 seconds off the pace. Archibald moved atop the 
overall standings with 1,600 points, 140 ahead of Austria's Stefan 
Kaltschuetz. Canadian Jasey Jay Anderson, the 1997 world champion, 
is another 10 points behind. Huet and Ruby, also French, captured 
parallel slalom races in Sestriere on Saturday. Ruby nearly added 
another triumph Sunday with a sparkling second run of 59.42 for a 
total time of 2:01.93. But Parini put together two consistent rides 
of 1:00.36 and 1:00.79 to notch her fifth career World Cup win with 
a combined 2:01.15. France's Isabelle Blanc was third in 2:03.07. 
Former world champion Sondra Van Ert of the United States was sixth 
Sunday in 2:04.41. Parini and Ruby are even in the season giant slalom 
standings with 2,400 points apiece, with Italian Lidia Trettel third 
with 1,670 and Blanc next with 1,390.
