Airports and highways aren't the only place you'll find crowds these 
days. It's the beginning of the holiday shopping season, and millions 
of americans are jamming crowded stores. Millions more are expected 
to avoid the crush by shopping online this year. But as ABC's Bill 
Redeker reports, Internet shopping has its own drawbacks. By now, 
who hasn't heard about shopping on the Internet? It's advertised on 
television, spelled out on shopping bags and storefront windows. Internet 
shopping became really big this year, because for the first time, 
we have enough people online familiar with the web that they are actually 
comfortable to buy something through the Internet. How many people? 
Enough to generate an expected $3 billion in holiday sales. And while 
that's only a fraction of the $173 billion shoppers will spend this 
season overall, it is double last year's volume. People are rushing 
to buy things online, because they realize it's becoming more convenient. 
What should you buy online? Products you're familiar with or can sample. 
Like music. Or books. Anything you got to touch, smell, taste to really 
purchase, not a great thing for online. And don't expect any bargains. 
In fact, consumer reports found a wide variety of prices charged by 
e-tailors for the same product. For one computer software game, prices 
ranged from are $20 up to $35. So that's an enormous range for the 
same product sold at different places. Analysts say it's unlikely 
the entire Internet will crash this season. The technology is sufficient 
to handle the holiday load. But individual retailers could have some 
problems. These new online retailers are extremely vulnerable to system 
crashes. If an Amazon.com crashes in the middle of the holiday season, 
they're going to lose a tremendous amount of sales. Still, it's hard 
to argue with the convenience of it all. For example, with a stroke 
of a key and $100 charge on your credit card, you can even order an 
eight-foot Christmas tree. So much for the annual family outing to 
pick that perfect pine. Bill Redeker, ABC News, New York.
