In blowing off the House Judiciary Committee's 81 interrogatories, 
a mockingly evasive Bill Clinton told the Congress of the United States: 
Take your impeachment process and stick it in your ear. Somewhere 
up in Modified Limited Hangout Heaven, Richard Nixon is applauding. 
Clinton is carrying out his Watergate credo: Presidents caught covering 
up admit only a mistake _ and never give their enemies an inch on 
having broken any law. Clinton stiffed the Congress on questions about 
the most characteristic moment in his presidency. In January, caught 
lying under oath in the Jones lawsuit, he consulted Dick Morris about 
the people's reaction if he told the truth. Morris testified that 
he took a poll showing public forgiveness about adultery but not about 
perjury. He reported Clinton's declaration of dishonesty: ``We just 
have to win, then'' _ that is, to hang tough with his line of lies. 
In his answer to Congress, Clinton had to admit the polling consultation 
because phone records back up what Morris told the grand jury. But 
that damning quote about winning by lying? Clinton answered ``I do 
not recall.'' He dared not deny outright saying that because Morris' 
habit is to make contemporaneous notes on his laptop of all conversations 
with Clinton. (By the way _ who paid for the historic poll that led 
Clinton to his ruination?) Such exquisite disremembering is typical 
of the Clinton defense. Its guiding principle: If you can prove wrongdoing, 
I'll admit it, but not if it's a crime. In his grand jury testimony, 
Clinton took the position that he never touched Monica Lewinsky intimately, 
not even once _ look, Ma, no hands _ yet he and his lawyers assert 
that he did not lie under oath. Words have meaning. You can argue 
that lying under oath about sex does not rise to an impeachable offense, 
but if what Bill Clinton told that grand jury is not lying under oath, 
then nothing is lying under oath. What Clinton has done in his mocking 
answers to 81 questions is to fling down a gauntlet: Impeach me if 
you dare. If you dare not, then the only adjectives acceptable to 
me in a shame-on-you resolution are ``indefensible'' and ``wrong'' 
about my initial behavior, and ``misled'' about my subsequent denials 
under oath (not ``lied'' and certainly never ``unlawful''). You have 
my permission to be cross, goes his message _ but not judgmental. 
Clinton's present in-your-face attitude places many representatives 
in a pickle. Do they let him treat them with unconcealed contempt, 
or do they let him force them to hit him harder than they want to? 
Most will base their vote against impeachment less on the rule of 
law than on a simple judgment: whether this helps or hurts them in 
the next election. Few doubt that on the basis of the last election 
Democrats should oppose impeachment. Clinton is triumphalistic; the 
market is booming; Ken Starr proved only lies about sex; nothing can 
stop the move-on movement. But politicians know that it is in the 
nature of the political wheel to turn. Two years hence, we could be 
in a recession, with people finding fault. A missile from a rogue 
nation could remind us who opposed a missile defense. With the statute 
of limitations run, Chinese fund-raising culprits could start confessing 
for fame and profit. Memoirists will be impelled to reveal all and 
Democratic partisans will claim to be shocked, shocked at President 
Pinocchio. If the Clinton star falls again, as it has twice before, 
few candidates for re-election will want to say to their constituents: 
This fellow you are reviling in 2000 is the one I saved from retribution 
in 1998. That is why Democrats, denied a genuine contrition fix, want 
the shame-on-you way out. They want to be able to say: ``I voted to 
verbally skin him alive; I wasn't soft on Clinton's wrongdoing.'' 
A scolding resolution is their insurance policy for giving him a constitutional 
pass. They are desperate to get right with the possible condemnation 
of voters in the next election. House Republicans rightly don't want 
them to get away with it. And the Comeback Kid, by coming back too 
cockily, is helping those who want to let the Senate make the final 
judgment.
