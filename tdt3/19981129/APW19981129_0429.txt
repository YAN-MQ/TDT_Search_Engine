After days of controversy over historical issues, Chinese President 
Jiang Zemin left behind the bustle of Tokyo on Sunday to tour farms 
and visit a Chinese writer's memorial in northern Japan. Jiang and 
his wife, Wang Yeping, laid wreaths on a pristine day at a monument 
to Chinese writer and social critic Lu Xun in the northeastern Japanese 
city of Sendai. Grandchildren of Lu and Genkuro Fujino, Lu's professor 
at Sendai's Tohoku University where the writer studied in 1904, shook 
hands with Jiang at the ceremony. Lu is one of China's most popular 
and influential authors. Jiang also visited Tohoku University and 
stood at the lectern of a classroom where Lu studied. Jiang's trip 
to the rural north on the fifth day of his historic visit to Japan 
marked a break from the diplomatic snafus that characterized his stay 
in Tokyo. On Friday, protesters shouted anti-Chinese slogans while 
Jiang delivered a speech urging Japan to remind its youth of the horrors 
it committed during World War II. Three students were arrested in 
scuffles with security guards. Scores of demonstrators, protesting 
China's nuclear weapons program and human rights abuses, were dragged 
away by police. Japan's omission of a full written apology for its 
brutal invasion of China has led observers to question whether Jiang's 
visit has succeeded in its aim of achieving a full reconciliation 
between the two Asian giants. Jiang's repeated references to Japan's 
past militarism in recent days have indicated lingering mistrust of 
Tokyo. Editorials Sunday in Hong Kong newspapers branded Jiang's visit 
a diplomatic failure and said Beijing over-estimated its ability to 
secure a full apology for World War II. ``Japan chose to be confrontational 
with China because it does not want to see China becoming a major 
international powerhouse,'' the Chinese-language Ming Pao said. Later, 
Jiang boarded a plane to Japan's northernmost main island of Hokkaido, 
where he visited flower growers and ranchers near the city of Sapporo, 
Kyodo News agency reported. Sendai is 302 kilometers (189 miles) northeast 
of Tokyo, while Sapporo is 829 kilometers (514 miles) north of the 
capital. Jiang's trip is the first of a Chinese head of state to Japan 
since World War II. The Chinese president departs Monday for Beijing.
