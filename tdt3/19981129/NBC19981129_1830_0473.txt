In Seattle tonight, still more questions than answers about Friday's 
city bus accident and the gunfire that caused it. 17 passengers remain 
hospitalized. More now from Jim forman of king-TV. At the crash scene 
today, a makeshift memorial for the victims grows. Seattle police 
say they still do not know what triggered the shooting, which left 
3 dead and 32 others hurt. I wish it would be possible to find out 
what his motivations were and what he was trying to accomplish by 
it. They are asking that same question at this homeless Shelter, where 
silas cool was a familiar face. Absolutely no sign of problems that 
would give us any indication of what happened. The bus driver, who 
died from gunshot wounds, lost control of the vehicle as he drove 
across a bridge. The bus flew through the air, smashed through a building 
before landing on the ground, 50 feet below. Passenger regina king 
was hospitalized for leg and rib injuries. The first thing, I was 
just thanking God for being alive. I didn't think we were going to 
make it. Chad Reilly suffered only cuts and bruises. It would be easy 
to look at this like something evil, but mainly I have a View of this 
as being hit by lightning or a tornado, something random. Sometimes 
bad things happen for no discernable reason. This might just have 
been one of those times. While no one on the ground was hurt, the 
crash is causing problems for this community. Like the people who 
live in this apartment building, now forced to find someplace else 
to live. I just don't want the baby to be out in the cold. As families 
move their belongings out of the damaged structure, the red cross 
is making sure everyone has a place to stay, for it could take some 
time to repair the damage. Jim forman for NBC news, Seattle.
