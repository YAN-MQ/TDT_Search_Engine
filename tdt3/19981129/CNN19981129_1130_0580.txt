There's just one thing holding many people back from shopping on the 
internet -- concerns about security. But Marcia Walton reports their 
worries may be unfounded. There is increased confidence in the security 
of online shopping and people are filling those virtual shopping carts. 
This year, more than 40% of U.S. computer users say they'll do at 
least "Some" of their holiday shopping on the Internet this year. 
Once you start playing with them, you begin to realize that, boy, 
the way to purchase is so simple through the net experience. That 
if you can get past that security issue, it's gonna make your life 
a Lot easier. "that security issue" is the still-widespread belief 
that putting a credit card number on the Internet makes easy pickings 
for computer-savvy thieves. Until somebody can actually say, "I guarantee 
you that your card is going to be fine," I'm just not ready for that. 
For security reasons, we don't like to let out our address and credit 
card numbers. But the truth is -- There's really very little fraud 
that takes place. Internet shopping sites like by.com scramble credit 
card information. Executives say like any new technology, it will 
take time for consumers to gain confidence. I think a lot of people 
in the initialing days with an ATM were afraid to use the ATM, they 
want 20d go out and talk to a teller. I think it's really people becoming 
comfortable with using the credit card online. Experts say shoppers 
should stick with brands they knew and with companies with established 
reputations. Take the time to comparison shop appeared be certain 
of the total price, shipping costs, return and cancellation policies. 
Beware of offers from unsolicited E-mailer or spam, a tool often used 
by crooks. Don't judge reliability by how nice or flashy a web site 
may seem. Anybody can create one. Some online Sellers like Barnes 
and Noble.com are so confident of their security they'll pick up the 
tab if there's a problem. If anything was ever to go wrong and it 
never has in 18 months, we would stand behind it and cover that customer 
on any transaction. And while some folks delight in the hustle and 
bustle of holiday shopping, more and more are grateful for the solitude 
of whittling away at that gift list at 2:00 A.M. at home in their 
pajamas. Marcia wallton, CNN Atlanta.
