Whether traveling for business or on vacation, airline passengers 
share a Common concern -- will the carry-on luggage fit? For some, 
the answer is increasingly "no." Lori Waffenschmidt explains in this 
edition of "working ahead." United and Delta airlines are trying to 
keep their flight attendants from having to be bag police. The airlines 
are installing baggage templates at security checkpoints in airports 
across the country -- Delta in about a dozen, united in 60 airports 
by early 1999. We think it'll do the thing we want it to do, which 
is to improve on-time departure performance and also create a hassle-free 
environment in the boarding process for passengers. This demonstration 
video from united shows what happens when an item doesn't fit. Oh, 
I don't believe it, I always carry this bag on board with me. It won't 
fit through the template. I'm going to have to check it to your final 
destination. If next time you don't pack it so full, I think it will 
fit through. Solid, oversized items that don't fit through the 9" 
x 14" opening will need to be checked. But soft, large items are likely 
to make the cut. Car seats and medical AIDS such as crutches are exceptions 
to the rule. Critics insist the new system will bring new problems. 
One is that there are going to be increased delays at security as 
people are caught unawares by the fact that they can't get through 
with a larger bag. Two, there's a question as to whether or not the 
airlines are going to be able to handle the increase in checked baggage. 
And continental airlines has filed suit against Delta over the templates. 
The two carriers share baggage screening devices at San Diego international 
airport. And continental doesn't want its passengers bags restricted. 
It's built larger overhead storage bins. Lori Waffenschmidt, CNN, 
reporting.
