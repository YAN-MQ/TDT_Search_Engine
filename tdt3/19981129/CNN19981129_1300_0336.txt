Almost half of Michigan residents say Jack Kevorkian should face criminal 
charges in the death of a man who had Lou Gehrig's disease. 300 people 
were surveyed for the "Detroit free press" poll. Kevorkian claims 
he administered a lethal injection to the 52-year-old man, then provided 
a videotape of his death to the CBS program "60 minutes. The retired 
pathologist was charged Wednesday with first-degree murder. His legal 
adviser says a jury will have to decide if Kevorkian committed murder 
or ended the man's suffering. I think it is different when juries 
consider it. I think juries will take a look at this case in the overal 
perspective. Jrz always do what they think is the right thing to do. 
When they look at this, they'll decide whether it is the right thing 
that mr. youk should have suffered, conditioned on and been the victim 
of cruel disease against his will. They can't argue the law because 
the law is pretty obvious. The facts are pretty clear so I think it 
is quite obvious what they'll attempt to do is rely upon the motions 
and the sympathy of the jury in order to nullify what is clearly a 
violation of the law. Kevorkian was also charged with criminal assistance 
to a suicide and delivery of a controlled substance.
