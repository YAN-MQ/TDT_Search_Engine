Still new on the block, Chancellor Gerhard Schroeder is nurturing 
German ties with France during a summit starting Monday that both 
sides hope will refresh Europe's key partnership. Big projects are 
on the table: 11 countries are introducing a single currency, the 
euro, on Jan. 1, requiring Europe to pull together economically as 
never before. And with Schroeder leading the first center-left German 
government in 16 years, French Prime Minister Lionel Jospin now has 
a potential ally in seeking common European ways to fight unemployment 
_ the continent's No. 1 problem. But atmosphere matters at least as 
much as nitty-gritty topics at the twice-yearly German-French gatherings, 
which help guide Europe's drive for greater unity. For Schroeder, 
the two-day summit in Potsdam outside Berlin is his first. He and 
President Jacques Chirac _ a conservative who appeals to Schroeder's 
centrist leanings _ have warmed to each other in two previous meetings, 
soothing French fears that Schroeder would seek closer ties with British 
Prime Minister Tony Blair at the expense of Paris. French Foreign 
Minister Hubert Vedrine praised the new German government last week, 
saying it was more practical and less sentimental than that of Helmut 
Kohl, Schroeder's predecessor. Kohl, who experienced World War II 
as a teenager, championed European unity and the German-French axis 
as a reconciliation between former battlefield enemies. But Vedrine 
said the partnership lacked drive during Kohl's latter years in power. 
``I always thought the French could communicate more easily with a 
Germany governed by Schroeder,'' Brigitte Sauzay, a former interpreter 
for the late French President Francois Mitterrand who now advises 
Schroeder, said in a newspaper interview. Both sides indicated a main 
topic will be Germany's demand for lower contributions to the European 
Union budget. Also on the agenda is administrative reform of the trade 
bloc to allow a first batch of former Soviet bloc countries to join 
early next century. The debut of Europe's central bank, which will 
set interest rate policy for the euro, is also expected to come up. 
Schroeder is the point man because Germany takes over the EU's rotating 
six-month presidency Jan. 1. With a dozen Cabinet ministers taking 
part on both sides, the summit is a get-acquainted session for the 
new German government. The leaders are expected to issue a final declaration 
Tuesday. A high point will be Monday's banquet hosted by Schroeder 
at the Babelsberg film studios, from where Marlene Dietrich launched 
her stardom with ``The Blue Angel.''
