Sources tell CNN attorney general Janet Reno will wait until tomorrow 
to decide whether to request an independent counsel to investigate 
former deputy White House chief of staff Harold Ickes. Sources say 
she's waiting until the last possible minute to announce her decision. 
Ickes is accused of lying to a Senate committee about whether the 
Clinton administration tried to intervene in a labor dispute involving 
the teamsters union in exchange for campaign donations from the teamsters. 
The White House denies that.
