A top Serbian official on Sunday warned that a U.S. plan for bringing 
peace to Kosovo will lead to full secession of the troubled province. 
Serbia, the dominant republic of Yugoslavia, has vowed to keep Kosovo, 
a southern province whose ethnic Albanian majority seeks independence. 
Serbia considers the region the cradle of its civilization. The U.S. 
plan, drafted by envoy Christopher Hill, envisages loosening Kosovo's 
ties with Serbia's central authorities while keeping it formally within 
its borders. ``Hill's plan is an indirect way to full secession of 
Kosovo from Serbia,'' said Serbian vice premier Milovan Bojic told 
state-run Serbian TV Sunday. ``Putting out the fire cannot be done 
by chopping up (Serbia).'' Bojic said in an interview with state-run 
Serbian TV Sunday. The ethnic Albanians, who make up 90 percent of 
Kosovo's population, have indicated they would temporarily settle 
for less than full independence, such as broad self-rule. Bojic said 
a Serbian solution granting a smaller degree of autonomy is the only 
solution. The Albanians have rejected the Serb proposal. Hundreds 
have died and estimated 300,000 people fled their homes when the long-standing 
crisis in Kosovo turned this year into an open war between ethnic 
Albanian separatists and government forces.
