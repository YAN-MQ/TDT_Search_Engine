For Stephen Underberg, a retired retailer living in Hastings-on-Hudson, 
N.Y., the devastation of Hurricane Mitch, in which at least 11,000 
Central Americans lost their lives, was grim but distant. ``It was 
just another hurricane story,'' said Underberg, 62. Then he heard 
about an e-mail message from Honduras. His son-in-law received it 
from a business associate in Tegucigalpa, the capital city, who told 
him about the 35 Jewish families there whose synagogue was destroyed 
by flood. One of their sacred Torahs was lost, and their remaining 
Torah was dug out of three feet of mud, water-stained and disfigured. 
The Hondurans needed a sofer, or scribe, to repair it. ``One of my 
proudest days was when I could say, `We have a sofer for you''' Underberg 
said. When the sofer, Rabbi Emmanuel Vinas of the Bronx, crouched 
Sunday over Underberg's dining room table, where the Tegucigalpa Torah 
had been placed after a journey of more than 2,200 miles, someone 
asked if the wrinkled, smeared parchment could be saved. ``Yeah,'' 
Vinas said softly, his hands and fingers stained to the color of gunpowder 
after inspecting it for more than an hour. ``Yeah, but I haven't gotten 
to the end of the scroll yet.'' It may take $10,000 in materials and 
other costs and perhaps two years to restore the Torah, Vinas said, 
but it could be done. The Torah is more than a scroll of animal-skin 
parchment containing the first five books of the Old Testament, said 
Vinas, 30, who has been a scribe for eight years. It is a symbol of 
the Jewish community extending back to Moses, he said. But Torah repair 
is time-consuming because it can only be done by a sofer, who writes 
on the parchment by hand with a quill made from a kosher animal, like 
a turkey or quail. Some 100 native-born Honduran Jews, expatriate 
Americans and Israelis are members of Communidad Hebrea de Tegucigalpa. 
The story of how their Torah traveled from hurricane-ravaged Honduras 
to Underberg's three-bedroom house in suburban Westchester is a story 
of determination and faith. When Hurricane Mitch hit Tegucigalpa Oct. 
30, Rio Choluteca flooded, swept through the front wall of the synagogue 
of Communidad Hebrea and covered the converted three-bedroom house 
in 20 feet of inky water. The flood broke the ark that contained the 
two Torahs, one brought over by immigrants from Hungary and the other 
from Germany shortly after World War II. Frantic congregants could 
find only one Torah, the one from Hungary, in the mud. Marvin Rembo, 
48, an American Jew who owns a health maintenance organization in 
San Pedro Sula, 200 miles north of Tegucigalpa, sent an e-mail to 
Underberg's son-in-law, Harry Mueller, his business associate in Connecticut. 
Could Underberg find a sofer? As it happened, Underberg's wife, Judy, 
is on the board of directors of the Jewish Community Center in nearby 
Tarrytown, which had recently hired Vinas as director of Jewish education. 
The Tegucigalpa Torah was spirited out of Honduras. The Torah will 
stay in Vinas' study for what he estimated will be 5,000 hours of 
repair work.
