Italy became the first men's team ever to win a third straight world 
title Sunday, defeating Yugoslavia 15-12, 15-5, 15-10 in the World 
Volleyball Championships final. In another final-round match, Cuba 
beat Brazil 12-15, 15-6, 15-11, 15-12 for the bronze medal in the 
24-team men's competition that started Nov. 13. In the 16-team women's 
contest held earlier this month, Olympic champion Cuba also defended 
its world title. China placed second, followed by Russia and fourth-place 
Brazil. Italy's conquest in men's volleyball under its coach at the 
time, Julio Velasco, began in 1990 when it overpowered Cuba for its 
first world championship in Rio de Janeiro. It retained the title 
in 1994 in Greece. After numerous trophies, Velasco's era ended at 
the 1996 Olympics with the team losing the gold-medal match to the 
Netherlands. Current coach Paulo Bebeto, a Brazilian, has since led 
the team. On Sunday, the Italians led throughout, except for a brief 
2-1 deficit in the second set, before a capacity crowd of 12,000 at 
Tokyo's Yoyogi Stadium. The first set saw the score tied four times, 
at 5, 6, 9 and 12. Andrea Giani, Andrea Gardini and Marco Brachi led 
the Italians, edging their opponents in attacking, retrieving the 
ball, serving and blocking. The only time Yugoslavia mounted a real 
challenge came when the match was almost over. It saved seven match 
points as it battled to stay in the game. At one point, an excited 
Italian fan ran onto the court believing his team had won. Team captain, 
Gardini, had to point and show the man the giant scoreboard which 
still read Italy 14, Yugoslavia 10. The victory was revenge for Italy's 
three straight losses to the Yugoslavian squad since June last year, 
first in a World League match and then in the European Championships 
six weeks later. The Italians also lost their quarterfinal round-robin 
match against Yugoslavia last week. It also was a happy farewell for 
Bebeto, who has announced this is his last game in charge of the national 
team. ``Finally the tournament is over,'' Bebeto said after Samuele 
Papi tipped in the championship point. ``The team has played 12 games 
here, and some were good and some others were not so good,'' said 
Gardini. ``But tonight's game, I think, was a masterpiece.'' Yugoslav 
coach Zoran Gajic agreed Italy deserved the gold medal. ``The Italians 
sure were superior in speed and power,'' he said. In the match for 
the bronze, this year's World League champion Cuba downed Brazil. 
The Cubans got off to a slow start but quickly regained their rhythm 
in the second set with Angel Dennis and Pavel Pimienta leading the 
team in attacking and defense. Dennis collected four points and 23 
side-outs, while Pimienta and team captain Ihosvany Hernanadez combined 
for 15 block points and one side-out. Brazil had to play without its 
ace wing-spiker Gilberto Godoy Filho, who was suffering from a strained 
left ankle. ``It was a very tight game,'' said Cuban coach Juan Diaz 
Marino. ``Our goal was to reach a high level today and keep our game 
at that level. We blocked particularly well, which allowed us to score 
many points.'' Brazilian team captain Nalbert Bitencourt said, ``I 
think we only played at 50 percent today after we put too much effort 
into the semi-final against Italy.'' In the contest for fifth place, 
1982 world champion Russia never was threatened seriously as it beat 
the Netherlands 15-7, 15-12, 15-12. Despite the win, Russian coach 
Guennadi Chipouline was not satisfied. ``It is very regrettable that 
we missed a medal. Our players didn't perform as well as I had expected.'' 
The Dutch lacked their usual speed and power with spiker Richard Schuil 
and setter Misha Latuhihin sitting on the bench due to injuries they 
suffered the last couple of days. Bulgaria defeated Spain 15-12, 15-7, 
12-15, 15-11 for seventh place. ``What was good about our team, I 
think, was that we had a high blocking against Spain's spikes,'' said 
Bulgarian coach Gueorgui Vassilev. The United States finished ninth 
with a straight-set victory of 16-14, 15-12, 15-10 over Ukraine. ``I'm 
really glad the tournament is over. But overall, I'm pretty pleased,'' 
said American team captain Lloy Ball. ``We could have stopped playing 
once we knew we were no longer fighting for medals, but we carried 
on trying.'' Argentina beat Canada 15-7, 15-10, 15-6 for 11th place 
with Marcos Milinkovic leading Argentina's offense and defense, scoring 
seven points and 13 sideouts. It was the last career game for Argentina's 
retiring setter and captain Javier Weber. ``I feel somewhat sentimental 
to retire after 14 long years playing for the national team,'' he 
said. ``I am glad to win my last game, but, of course, I feel sad 
to retire.''
