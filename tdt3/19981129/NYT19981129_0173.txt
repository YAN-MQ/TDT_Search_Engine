Mention the deep rift in American politics, and everyone thinks of 
Republicans and Democrats. But the last election revealed a more subtle 
division between political professionals and voters. Indeed some Republicans 
feel that behind the party's destructive obsession with President 
Clinton was a larger structural problem: a centrally controlled fund-raising 
and attack strategy that lost touch with the electorate. The latest 
Republican to challenge the system is Sen. Chuck Hagel of Nebraska, 
who wants to replace Sen. Mitch McConnell of Kentucky as director 
of the party's Senate election operation. As the Senate GOP's fundraiser-in-chief, 
McConnell harvested huge sums in unregulated ``soft money'' from special 
interests to pay for negative ads against Democrats. He also battled 
campaign-finance reform sponsored by Sens. John McCain of Arizona 
and Russell Feingold of Wisconsin. Campaign reform is needed to wipe 
away the corrupting influence of the open-ended contributions from 
corporations, unions and rich individuals that have been outlawed 
for candidates for most of this century. But Hagel is not running 
as a campaign ``reformer.'' He opposed the McCain-Feingold ban on 
unlimited donations to both parties and independent groups using the 
funds for television ads close to an election. Unlike McConnell, however, 
Hagel says the current system does not work and needs to be changed. 
His practical argument may be more persuasive than the reformers' 
philosophical approach. Because ``soft money'' has to be raised and 
spent by parties, not candidates, McConnell served as the mastermind 
in Washington. Hagel wants to redirect Senate fund-raising to ``hard 
money,'' for spending by candidates as they see fit. He hopes to tap 
the anger among Republicans at McConnell's tactics. In Wisconsin, 
for example, McConnell spent money for negative ads on flag-burning 
and abortion against Feingold. They backfired, and Feingold won. California 
Republicans also feel that they might have beaten Sen. Barbara Boxer 
if they had spent the money themselves. Everyone is angry over McConnell's 
refusal to give much money to Rep. Linda Smith, who lost to Sen. Patty 
Murray in Washington state. Ms. Smith was being punished for her support 
of campaign reform. Hagel also notes that the Republicans have to 
limit the open-ended spending for the mostly negative ads by the Christian 
Coalition, labor unions and other groups that have often done more 
harm than good. The principle that candidates who control their own 
spending have a better chance to win could be much more persuasive 
than any lofty arguments about reform. In the current Senate, a majority 
already supports campaign reform. Now one newly elected Republican, 
George Voinovich of Ohio, is on record favoring the McCain-Feingold 
bill. If Hagel defeats McConnell _ a big ``if'' because of fierce 
opposition by Trent Lott, the majority leader _ it could drastically 
improve the chances of a campaign overhaul. Senate Republicans vote 
this week on Hagel's challenge. Whatever the outcome, the vote could 
reflect discontent with Lott's and McConnell's use of soft money to 
push ideological positions at the expense of candidates.
