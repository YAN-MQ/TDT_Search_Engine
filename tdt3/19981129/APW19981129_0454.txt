Spain under the rule of dictator Gen. Francisco Franco played only 
a minor role in trafficking art stolen by the Nazis from Holocaust 
victims, according to a government report quoted in a Sunday newspaper. 
The report will be presented this week at a Washington conference 
on the billions of dollars worth of art looted by the Nazis that has 
since found its way into public and private collections around the 
world, leading daily El Pais said. The report recognizes that Franco's 
government protected five alleged art smugglers from extradition, 
and that 15 others operated in Spain, the newspaper said. But this 
gave Spain only a ``modest'' role in the looted art network, since 
an estimated 2,000 art traffickers worked throughout Europe, the report 
said, according to El Pais. The report details the protection given 
to Alois Miedl, a wealthy German banker who had good contacts with 
collectors around the world and a personal friendship with Hitler's 
right-hand-man Herman Goering. Miedl entered Spain in 1944 with 22 
paintings _ including a Van Dyck, two Corots and a David _ allegedly 
stolen from the collection of Dutch Jewish millionaire Jacques Goudstikker. 
In the years that followed Franco refused to bow to pressure to extradite 
Miedl from the Dutch government, aided by the allies. The whereabouts 
of the paintings is now a mystery, El Pais said. Spain is among the 
44 nations and 13 nongovernmental organizations to take part in a 
four-day Washington conference starting Monday and is expected to 
draft guidelines regarding how to deal with art that may have been 
stolen by the Nazis. The Nazis, beginning in 1933 in Germany, looted 
an estimated dlrs 9 billion to dlrs 14 billion in art and other assets 
from Jews in 20 countries or regions they occupied. The current value 
of the assets is estimated at dlrs 90 billion to dlrs 140 billion. 
Switzerland's two largest commercial banks have recently agreed to 
pay dlrs 1.25 billion to Holocaust survivors and their heirs for lost 
assets.
