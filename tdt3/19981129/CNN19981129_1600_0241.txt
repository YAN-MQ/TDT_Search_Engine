Israeli prime minister Benjamin Netanyahu is reviewing government 
policy towards Lebanon following recent violence in the self-proclaimed 
security zone. Iranian-backed Hezbollah militia have killed seven 
Israeli soldiers in the past two weeks. Cabinet members today called 
for military strikes against water and power supplies in Beirut as 
retaliation. Netanyahu says his troops will remain in Lebanon as long 
as needed to ensure the safety of northern Israel.
