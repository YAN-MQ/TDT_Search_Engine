Swiss voters on Sunday decisively defeated a radical measure to legalize 
marijuana as well as heroin and cocaine, turning aside arguments that 
a government-managed narcotics network would curb drug-related crime. 
The proposal would have turned Switzerland into a virtual free-drugs 
zone, with any resident over 18 years old able to buy narcotics at 
state-approved pharmacies, after consulting a doctor. Nearly 74 percent 
of voters rejected the initiative, which had been expected to fail, 
but not to such an overwhelming extent. ``It was a surprise,'' said 
Francois Reusser, spokesman for the committee that launched the initiative 
``for a sensible drug policy.'' ``Voters reacted emotionally to the 
heroin aspect,'' he said. However, Reusser said he hoped lawmakers 
would still consider liberalizing the use and possession of cannabis, 
which federal statistics indicate is regularly consumed by some 500,000 
people in Switzerland, a nation of 7 million. He said the committee, 
backed by Socialists, medical doctors, lawyers and drug experts, would 
consider a new campaign to collect the signatures necessary to force 
a ballot vote on legalizing cannabis. Government officials said the 
vote confirmed Switzerland's policy of battling illicit drugs, but 
also aiding the worst-off drug addicts through a program that gives 
heroin and methadone to a controlled group of abusers. The Alpine 
nation has an estimated 30,000 to 36,000 hard drug addicts, one of 
the highest rates in Europe. Thomas Zeltner, chief of the federal 
health department, said Switzerland was ready to review policies on 
soft drugs such as marijuana and hashish. The government is proposing 
new laws on drugs be drawn up next year.
