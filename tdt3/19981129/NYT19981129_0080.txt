Livent Inc., the corporate producer of the Broadway musical ``Ragtime,'' 
has found lenders willing to provide it with more money and save it 
from shutting down immediately, a person close to the company said 
Sunday. Livent, which sought protection from its creditors in bankruptcy 
court this month, is quickly running out of cash. The company has 
said that a $5 million emergency loan from a group of its directors 
would pay the bills only through the end of November. But the person 
close to the company said that Livent's board, including Michael Ovitz, 
the Hollywood power broker who now controls the company, met Sunday 
to consider ``three different lending alternatives.'' The board will 
make a final decision early this week, this person said, speaking 
on condition of anonymity. Any new loans must be approved by the federal 
Bankruptcy Court in New York and another court in Toronto where the 
company is based. ``The reality is that the company will be kept together,'' 
said this person, who would not identify the possible lenders. If 
the loans are approved, the company will continue to reorganize its 
finances and try to make its shows profitable. Ovitz and Livent's 
other new managers, who took over the company in June, have blamed 
the former chief executive, Garth Drabinsky, and other former managers 
for the company's predicament. Livent has sued Drabinsky and his partner, 
Myron Gottlieb, contending that the two men, who founded the company, 
engaged in a widespread corporate fraud and manipulated the company's 
accounts to hide the fact that its extravagant productions were losing 
tens of millions of dollars. Since the company filed for Chapter 11 
bankruptcy protection on Nov. 18, executives have canceled dozens 
of concerts and musicals at a theater in Toronto, angering ticketholders 
who arrived to find the lights out. Instead of getting their money 
back, the Toronto patrons were offered tickets to ``Phantom of the 
Opera,'' another Livent show. The company is also closing some of 
its expensive musical productions that have been touring the United 
States. The company has canceled a production of ``Ragtime'' that 
last played in Minneapolis. A production of ``Showboat'' is expected 
to close on Dec. 6 in Providence, R.I. In New York, ``Ragtime'' has 
continued to go on before houses that are nearly sold out. So far, 
the company insists that its other new projects coming to Manhattan 
are proceeding as planned. ``Parade,'' which the company produced 
with Lincoln Center, is in previews, and ``Fosse: A Celebration of 
Song and Dance,'' is scheduled to open on Broadway in January.
