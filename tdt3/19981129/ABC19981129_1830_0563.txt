The American people may have moved on, but the house Judiciary committee 
still has a job ahead of it -- to decide whether to bring articles 
of impeachment against President Clinton. They hold a hearing on Tuesday, 
to discuss what perjury is. Some members were already discussing it 
today on the Sunday talk shows. To me, he's an unrepentant perjurer 
who should lose his job unless he changes his Tone with the American 
people and reconciles himself with the law. There is nothing that 
has been presented that would equate what the republicans are charging 
the president with, to treason, bribery or other high crimes, because 
they don't meet the test. It looks like the president has committed 
perjury, he has obstructed justice, and he has abused his office. 
And most importantly, he has looked the American people straight in 
the eye and lied to them. It seems that he did not break the constitution, 
that he broke a Commandment. And so, I hope that censure will be sufficient. 
The Judiciary committee is expected to decide by mid-December whether 
to recommend impeachment.
