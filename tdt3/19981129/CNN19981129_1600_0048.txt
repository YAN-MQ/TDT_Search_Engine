"CNN Headline News." I'm Kate snow. With the Thanksgiving weekend 
winding down, one more event remains for millions of Americans -- 
the trip home. This is one of the busiest travel days of the year, 
whether on the road, in the air, or on the rails. The only major airport 
reporting significant problems is San Francisco international. Rain, 
fog and low clouds are causing arrival delays of up to two hours. 
Airlines, Amtrak and aaa are all advising travelers throughout the 
country to get an early start and bring plenty of patience. I am just 
trying to be like a sheep and go with it. I figure it'll take as long 
as it'll take, and try to stay relaxed and get to the end of it. Hopefully, 
it won't be as bad as it could be. I'd rather do this than drive, 
that's for sure. An estimated 6 million Americans will be flying this 
weekend.
