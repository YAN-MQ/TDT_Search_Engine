The New York Times said in an editorial for Monday, Nov. 30: The Supreme 
Court will hear arguments today on the legality of the Clinton administration's 
plan to use statistical sampling in the 2000 census. The purpose of 
the sampling is to correct for the predictable undercounting of poor 
minorities by conventional census-taking methods. The court's judgment 
will be momentous, both for its immediate practical consequences and 
its symbolic message. Mandated by Article I of the Constitution, the 
decennial census count is the basic arithmetic of democracy. It influences 
the division of political power in Congress and the states, and shapes 
the flow of many government benefits. Absent a statistical adjustment, 
minority groups will continue to be disproportionately undercounted 
and the areas they live in will be shortchanged. The discrepancy is 
not trivial. While the 1990 census missed about 2 percent of the nation's 
overall population, it missed 4.8 percent of the black population 
and 5.2 percent of the Hispanic population. Statisticians support 
the feasibility of using sampling methods to improve the count's accuracy. 
Before the Court are two recent lower court rulings from Washington 
and Virginia that held the planned use of sampling as part of the 
next census to be illegal, at least for the purpose of apportioning 
seats in Congress. Those rulings relied on a Federal Census Act provision 
that requires the Secretary of Commerce to use sampling in determining 
population ``except for'' the purpose of congressional reapportionment. 
But that statutory language was not meant to bar sampling for reapportionment, 
merely to make its use discretionary. The House Republicans behind 
both lawsuits speak in high-minded tones about the potential for political 
manipulation if sampling is used. What they really fear is not a phony 
count but the possibility of an accurate count that would increase 
the political power of predominantly Democratic areas. They also claim 
that sampling violates the constitutional requirement of an ``actual 
enumeration'' of the population. But the court should not embrace 
such a frozen view given the Framers' clear intent to provide a reliable 
tally. In 1996, the court dismissed claims that the federal government 
has a constitutional obligation to adjust census results to correct 
the racially disparate undercount. But it did not say that such a 
correction is impermissible. For the justices to do so now would disregard 
the statute and the vital principles of equal political participation 
and one person, one vote.
