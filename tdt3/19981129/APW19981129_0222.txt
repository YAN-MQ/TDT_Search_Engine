Imagine a farmer scratching his head and wondering what the millennium 
will bring. Is the family farm doomed? Is the stock market going to 
crash? Is science leading us to utopia or to nuclear devastation? 
Yes, farmers are as full of angst as the rest of us, says Steve Ripley, 
leader of boogie-woogie country band The Tractors. ``Banker got the 
money/Farmer put it in the ground/Banker goin' uptown/Farmer goin' 
down,'' Ripley sings in the song ``Poor Boy Shuffle,'' which is included 
on The Tractors' second album, ``Farmers in a Changing World.'' The 
latest album from this rumpled, raspy-voiced guitarist and farmer's 
son doesn't offer answers. It just tries to offer a little musical 
comfort with its blend of rock 'n' roll and country. And ``Farmers 
in a Changing World'' is as familiar and satisfying as that first 
cup of coffee in the morning. The first single is a catchy, danceable 
song based on the children's standard ``Shortenin' Bread.'' Ripley 
turns his limited vocal range to his advantage. When he croaks out 
a lyric about being ``The World's Biggest Fool,'' you believe him. 
When he mumbles about how Elvis Presley changed his life in ``The 
Elvis Thing,'' it rings true. The Tractors _ Ripley, keyboardist Walt 
Richmond, drummer Jamie Oldaker, bassist Casey Van Beek and guitarist 
Ron Getman _ seemingly came out of nowhere in 1994 when they scored 
a hit with ``Baby Likes to Rock It'' and sold more than 2 million 
of their debut album ``The Tractors.'' Actually, they came from Tulsa, 
Oklahoma, where Ripley owns Leon Russell's old recording studio, The 
Church. Ripley, 48, learned recording from Russell and J.J. Cale, 
and played in Bob Dylan's band in the 1980s. The other Tractors, all 
in their 40s and 50s, have individually played in the bands of Bonnie 
Raitt, Eric Clapton and Linda Ronstadt. On ``Farmers in a Changing 
World,'' Raitt plays Stratocaster slide guitar on two songs, while 
former Presley sidemen James Burton, Scotty Moore and D.J. Fontana 
sit in on Ripley's tribute to Elvis. For both Tractor albums, producers 
and main songwriters Ripley and Richmond tinkered for years to come 
up with rootsy, good-time rock 'n' roll that sounds deceptively casual. 
Coughs, clatter and loose chatter start off many of the songs. ``In 
the Tulsa tradition you record all the time,'' Ripley said. ``Everybody's 
got a studio. It's not a special event, it's the life event _ your 
gig.'' The infectious off-the-cuff vibe is the result of painstakingly 
recording lots of material, then editing it. And spontaneity rules. 
It's a system that's not usual in Nashville, where polished studio 
musicians crank out songs during tightly structured three-hour recording 
sessions, a method that allows most country stars to produce an album 
a year. But that's not the way The Tractors work. ``The truth is it 
takes longer to get enough of those moments of spontaneity to make 
a whole record,'' Ripley said. ``But if you get it right, you have 
much more passion.''
