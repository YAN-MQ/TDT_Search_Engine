Good evening. Police say he's dangerous, and he has nothing to lose. 
Searchers in Texas are still hunting tonight for an escaped killer 
who broke out of death row on Friday. The last person to do that was 
a member of Bonnie and Clyde's gang, in 1934. As ABC's Steve Osunsami 
reports, the Hunt is a little more high-tech today. Inmates on Texas's 
death row are under lockdown today as more than 500 prison guards 
and police officers use horses, bloodhounds and helicopters with night 
vision to search for 29-year-old Martin gurule. Law enforcement officers 
have orders to shoot to kill. If deadly force is necessary, certainly, 
we will use deadly force to stop him. Gurule was sentenced to die 
for killing a corpus Christi restaurant owner and cook during a robbery 
in 1992. But on Thursday evening, gurule and six other death row inmates 
made dummies out of bed linens and pillows, fooling guards into believing 
they were sleeping. The inmates also dyed their white uniform grey 
with ink from felt-tip pens, and then cut through a fence to run for 
freedom. Sharpshooters immediately opened fire, forcing six of the 
prisoners to surrender. Investigators say gurule ran fast enough to 
avoid the gunfire but was seriously wounded when he scaled to razor-topped 
fences. Officials are confident he's still in the area. The conditions 
are somewhat hostile, that is, the mosquitoes are ferocious out here. 
We have fire ants, water moccasins, rattle snakes and if you get into 
the water, in the river, there's alligators. Huntsville, Texas, is 
a small town with several prisons. And most of the residents work 
for one. Still, they are not taking any chances. It's just, you just 
watch out for what you're doing, and listen to your dogs, when the 
bark, is all. The search team says clear weather, and gurule's growing 
hunger will force the fugitive to make a move. Police are hoping between 
his wounds and the swamps, there may be no escape. Steve Osunsami,
