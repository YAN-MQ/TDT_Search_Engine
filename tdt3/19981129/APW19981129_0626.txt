Jeff Archibald edged Nicolas Huet by five hundredths of a second Sunday 
in a Snowboard World Cup giant slalom to pick up his first career 
victory. Italy's Margerita Parini won the women's race, taking a commanding 
lead of nearly two seconds after the first run and holding off Olympic 
champion Karine Ruby in the second. Archibald, of Ogden, Utah, and 
France's Huet shared the provisional lead after both clocking 56.30 
seconds in the men's first run, but the American's second run of 55.80 
was just enough to give him the win. Richard Richardson of Sweden 
finished third in the season's opening giant slalom at this resort 
in Italy's western Alps with a total time of 1:52.33, 0.23 seconds 
off the pace. Huet and Ruby, also French, captured parallel slalom 
races in Sestriere on Saturday. Ruby nearly added another triumph 
Sunday with a sparkling second run of 59.42 for a total time of 2:01.93. 
But Parini put together two consistent rides of 1:00.36 and 1:00.79 
to notch her fourth career World Cup win with a combined 2:01.15. 
France's Isabelle Blanc was third in 2:03.07. Former world champion 
Sondra Van Ert of the United States was sixth Sunday in 2:04.41.
