When a celebrity breaks the law, he doesn't always go to jail. Often, 
he's sentenced to perform ``community service,'' which could include 
staging fund-raising concerts or making anti-this or anti-that TV 
commercials. But who benefits? The public or the celebrity? Joe Sixpack 
breaks the law and he'll be cooling his heels in a jail cell. Or, 
if community service hours are assigned, he'll be pulling weeds or 
clearing trash on a road crew. There is, however, a parallel universe 
in Hollywood, where the suspension of reality transcends into the 
private world of show business bad boys. ``The fact is that in the 
justice system anyone who has a private attorney is going to do better 
than someone with a public defender,'' said a source familiar with 
the Los Angeles County Probation Department's community service program. 
``When you can afford a dlrs 1,000-an-hour attorney you get a better 
shot,'' said the source, who spoke on condition of anonymity. ``They 
work it out with the judge. Sure, celebrities do better.'' Community 
service sentences handed out by judges generally involve menial tasks 
such as cleaning up parks, clearing flood control channels or joining 
a road crew with the California Department of Transportation. ``The 
judge never suggests exactly what it will be. At the most, a judge 
would, say, find an organization you could do community service for 
that benefits the community,'' said county courts spokeswoman Jerrianne 
Hayslett. The program is administered by the Probation Department, 
which refers defendants to a volunteer center. They are then assigned 
to tasks with government agencies, shelters or schools, where they 
might wind up wiping out graffiti. Show business lawyers work out 
better deals for their clients, however. British pop star George Michael 
was handed a community service sentence after he pleaded no contest 
to committing a lewd act in a Beverly Hills park restroom. A judge 
ordered the singer to telephone schools and children's centers to 
encourage kids to do charity work. When Tupac Shakur was sentenced 
to community service, the rapper satisfied his obligation by staging 
a concert, with proceeds going to an organization that benefits disadvantaged 
youngsters. Christian Slater had to wash police cars, Zsa Zsa Gabor 
did paperwork at a women's shelter, figure skater Oksana Baiul appeared 
at charity ice shows, actor Martin Lawrence held charity comedy shows, 
and singer Bobby Brown appeared in TV public service announcements 
about the dangers of drugs. ``The defendant in every case is handled 
independently,'' Probation Department spokesman Craig Levy said. ``If 
somebody has an aptitude or ability that can be used, we'll use it.'' 
Community service programs clearly benefit taxpayers in Los Angeles 
County, where there are 80,000 adults on probation. ``You can't put 
80,000 people in jail,'' Levy reasoned. ``There have to be options 
for judges, how best to make them pay for what they have done. Community 
service works well for lightweight offenders.'' Thousands of people 
are performing community service sentences each month, and usually 
it's a physical, sometimes backbreaking, task. Caltrans gets the majority 
of community service assignments for road cleanup. ``It's just like 
a job. They sign in every day and sign out. There's a record kept 
of the hours. If you blow it off, you go to jail,'' said Levy, noting 
no-shows are often reassigned to dreaded Caltrans assignments. ``For 
you or me, the choice would be simple: Would you rather be picking 
up trash in 110 degrees (43 C) or in an air-conditioned office?'' 
There are rapists, drunken drivers, wife beaters, burglars and some 
convicted of assault with a deadly weapon. ``Sometimes I'm frightened, 
maybe about once a month. But I'm always nice to them _ tell them 
I'm here to help you _ and they settle down,'' said Leticia Cabrera 
of the Volunteer Center in the San Fernando Valley. Each month, her 
office gets about 175 new adult cases and 200 new juvenile cases. 
Some of them have to perform 1,000 community service hours that take 
up to four years to complete. Still, in Ms. Cabrera's nine years at 
the center, she's never seen a celebrity walk through the door. Thanks 
to the pricey entertainment lawyers. Asked if celebrities get special 
treatment and are coddled, Levy said: ``You have to look at what's 
the benefit for the community or society.'' The Probation Department 
sometimes comes up with a novel way for celebrities to satisfy community 
service obligations. Levy said one high-profile actor, whom he wouldn't 
name, organized a play at a juvenile probation camp heavily stocked 
with gangbangers. ``It taught kids not used to working together to 
work together,'' Levy said. ``It taught them to step out of their 
own role and put on another face. It was positive for not only the 
actor on probation to work with kids he's never worked with but it 
was also positive for the kids.''
