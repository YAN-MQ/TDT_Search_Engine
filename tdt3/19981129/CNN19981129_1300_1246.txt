First up, the NFL and week 13. The free-falling chiefs try to halt 
their longest losing streak in more than a decade as they host the 
playoff-hungry Cardinals, who hope to improve their wild card standing. 
Kansas city has lost six straight. The falcons, who are seeking their 
first division title since 1980, can lock up their first playoff spot 
in three years by beating the Rams, or with a loss by the saints and 
a lions loss or tie. The jets trying to avoid a letdown against the 
2-9 Panthers. New York needs a win if they expect to contend for the 
AFC east title. Jets come into this game at 7-4. The Colts return 
to Baltimore today for the first time since that snowy night in March 
1984, when they packed up the moving vans and left Baltimore for Indianapolis. 
The game will bring closure to a bitter chapter in the history of 
pro football in Baltimore. The jaguars hope to get back on the winning 
track with a win over the hapless bengals. Cincinnati with the worst 
defense in the league. Two teams heading in the wrong direction, the 
4-7 Bucs taking on the 3-8 bears. Tampa bay hoping to snap a three-game 
losing streak and keep their fading playoff hopes alive. Coming up 
later, the Patriots face Doug Flutie and the bills for the second 
time in three weeks in a key AFC east matchup. New England is locked 
in a three-way tie for first with the dolphins and jets. Flutie will 
be playing in Foxboro for the first time in nine years. On the field, 
I feel weird. Being on a grass field. Last time I was there, it was 
artificial Turf. Probably look around to the stands and find friends 
or recognize faces walking out, that type of thing.
