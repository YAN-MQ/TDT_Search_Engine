Malaysia announced Sunday it will resume war games next year under 
the Five Power Defense Arrangement with Singapore, the national news 
agency reported. Defense Minister Syed Hamid Albar said officials 
from Malaysia and Singapore would work out details next month, the 
Bernama news agency said. Malaysia had earlier pulled out from this 
year's FPDA exercises at the last minute, blaming costs and the country's 
economic difficulties. Malaysia and Singapore's partners in the FPDA 
are Australia, Britain, and New Zealand. ``We have gained quite a 
lot from the joint exercises because of its interchangeability,'' 
Syed Hamid said, according to Bernama. ``This exercise gives us exposure 
to areas that on our own we are not able to achieve. And for that 
reason we have decided to continue,'' he added. The 27-year-old defense 
arrangement was originally created for promoting regional security 
and protecting Malaysia and Singapore from the threat of communism. 
Asked if the airspace rule imposed by Malaysia on Singapore's military 
aircraft would create problems for both countries, Syed Hamid said 
permission would be given during the exercises. ``The airspace rule 
is normal, we don't want it to be an obstacle or hindrance to such 
exercises for the good of both countries,'' he said. In September, 
Malaysia abruptly revoked a long standing agreement allowing Singapore 
military planes to transit through its airspace without prior approval, 
part of a diplomatic wrangle that has soured relations between the 
two neighbors. Syed Hamid also said that he had not received reports 
recently of Singapore's military aircraft breaching Malaysian airspace. 
``If there is no report then it should be considered as a good development. 
I shouldn't be trying to look for problems, I think we should be very 
happy when there are no reports about it,'' he said. Singapore military 
aircraft do not need to fly through Malaysian airspace to proceed 
to their training grounds and the planes can land and take off from 
their air bases by flying over water. Syed Hamid said he had spoken 
to the British High Commissioner, or ambassador, about Malaysia's 
intention to resume its military exercises under the FPDA, and was 
given a positive reaction.
