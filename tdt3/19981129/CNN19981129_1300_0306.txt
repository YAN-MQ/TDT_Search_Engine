Shoppers are flocking to the malls again today, as the first weekend 
of the holiday shopping season wraps up. Retailers say, so far, things 
look pretty good. The telecheck retail index indicates sales on Friday 
were more than 4% higher than on the same day last year. Telecheck 
measures the volume of authorized checks written by consumers. The 
midwest showed the biggest jump in sales, followed by the southeast. 
Analysts say the growth is due to the healthy economy and increased 
consumer confidence.
