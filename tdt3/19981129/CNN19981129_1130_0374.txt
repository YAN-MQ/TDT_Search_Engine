Early returns show voters in Switzerland are rejecting a proposal 
to legalize recreational use of drugs. The measure would allow anyone 
older than 18 to buy any drug from marijuana to heroin after consulting 
with a doctor, and drugs would be sold at state-run outlets or pharmacies. 
Backers of the proposal say making drugs illegal hasn't stopped the 
supply, but instead has created an illegal market with no health standards. 
They say if drugs were legal, addiction would be easier to prevent 
and treat. Opponents say Switzerland would become a safe haven for 
addicts from around europe.
