At 180 pounds, the Giants Curtis Buckley doesn't spend much time running 
into 300-pound linemen. But he doesn't avoid them either. Simply ask 
the Philadelphia Eagles 6-foot-4-inch, 309-pound tackle Barrett Brooks, 
a mountain of a man who the 5-10 Buckley flattened on a kickoff in 
the Giants' last game. ``There's nothing in the rule book or my contract 
that says don't hit the guy if he weighs 100 pounds or 200 pounds 
more than me,'' Buckley said last week at Giants Stadium. ``It's all 
about being psyched. Go full speed, let the other guys worry about 
the collisions.'' Buckley, who the Giants signed off waivers from 
the San Francisco 49ers two weeks ago and who already will get a chance 
to face his former team here on Monday night, is a special-teams specialist 
who has three times been named a Pro Bowl first alternate. The 49ers 
never wanted to lose Buckley, but a spate of injuries this month created 
a hole at cornerback, a position Buckley does not play. The 49ers 
signed cornerback Tyrone Legette, and to make room for him they put 
Buckley on waivers, although they did so on a Friday morning. The 
timing of that transaction _ two days before the next round of games 
_ suggests that the 49ers may have been trying to catch other teams 
at a time when their rosters were too crowded to consider adding another 
player. Buckley said he was told that the 49ers had plans to re-sign 
him a few days later. Giants General Manager Ernie Accorsi was surprised 
to see Buckley's name on the waiver wire that Friday morning, but 
since he knew the Giants special teams have been subpar, Accorsi knew 
Buckley was worth claiming. The day the Giants signed Buckley, one 
Giants coach called him, ``a heat-seeking missile.'' In his first 
game as a Giant, against the Eagles on Nov. 22, Buckley had two tackles 
and got the attention of his new teammate with a boisterous, enthusiastic 
attitude not often seen on special teams, an area many players try 
to avoid. As 49ers Coach Steve Mariucci said last week: ``During games, 
Curtis Buckley thinks special teams are the most important thing going 
on that day. He loves it. It's what he does for a living and he has 
a spunk, an energy and a confidence that goes with it. ``Every coach 
wants to have a Curtis Buckley on his team. It was a really tough 
decision to put him on waivers.'' Giants Coach Jim Fassel said he 
heard someone yelling on his sideline during the Eagles game, turned 
around and discovered that it was Buckley trying to rally the Giants 
for their next special-teams assignment. ``He was trying to get people 
psyched about a punt coverage,'' Fassel said. ``What's more impressive 
is that you can talk the talk, but then he went out and earned his 
teammates' respect. He was a dynamo out there.'' Buckley has an air 
of confidence that stands out these days in a blue Giants locker room 
where seven losses in 11 games have muted the swagger and self-assurance 
the team had back in training camp. ``I'm good at what I do and I 
want other people to feel good about what they do,'' Buckley said. 
``You can't play this game with your mouth closed. I'm out there telling 
my teammates, `Come on, come with me. Let's go hit them all.' '' Buckley, 
28, developed this penchant for special-teams mayhem when he was with 
the Tampa Bay Buccaneers. In 1995, his third season with the Buccaneers, 
he blocked two punts, forced a fumble and had eight special-teams 
tackles. He received his first Pro Bowl recognition and that got the 
attention of the 49ers, who signed him after the season as a restricted 
free agent. He spent the next two seasons as San Francisco's leading 
special-teams player and was the 49ers' special-teams captain when 
they put him on waivers two weeks ago. ``I don't know what they were 
thinking,'' Buckley said of the 49ers. ``But I know I wouldn't have 
let me go. I know 99 percent of the coaching staff and players wouldn't 
have let me go. You can put somebody else in a position on the field 
but you can't do all the things I do. ``If you find a guy who can 
play on kickoffs, kickoff returns, punts, punt returns and block field 
goals _ and do it with the success I've had _ you let me know.'' This 
week, Buckley is helping the Giants prepare for the 49ers' defense, 
and their special teams. Asked if he would try to reveal some of the 
49ers secrets for the Giants coaches, Buckley smiled and said: ``Whatever 
it takes. I'm with the Giants. I'm all about helping the Giants win. 
You can take that any way you want.'' Asked if he would have any trouble 
playing against his former teammates Monday night, Buckley said: ``I 
played Pee-Wee football against my brother.'' He does acknowledge 
that he is something other than overjoyed about having to leave a 
team headed for the playoffs for one with virtually no playoff aspirations. 
``I'd be a fool to say it didn't matter,'' he said. Buckley has a 
year left on his contract and he said that he wouldn't mind remaining 
with the Giants when the 1998 season is over. ``If they want to extend 
my contract,'' said Buckley. ``That sounds good to me.'' Buckley, 
who was reared in Texas and played at Texas A&AMP;M, said he has only 
one problem playing for the Giants. ``If it goes below 70 degrees,'' 
he said. ``I consider it cold. I don't mind the cold in games, but 
I don't like that cold weather for practices. That's a problem, but 
I'm working on it.''
