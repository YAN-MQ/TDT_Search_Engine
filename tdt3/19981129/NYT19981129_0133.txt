Despite tribal protests, two pieces of Aleut Indian art will be included 
in an auction at Sotheby's in Manhattan on Wednesday, the auction 
house and the seller say. The tribe contends that part of its cultural 
heritage has been lost and should be restored. The seller contends 
that the objects, a wood mask dated between 1510 and 1660 and an early 
bentwood hunting hat, may well be better off in private hands. Allison 
Young, cultural heritage director of a tribal organization representing 
Aleut tribes of the Aleutian and Pribilof Islands in Alaska, asked 
Sotheby's and one of its consignors, Adelaide de Menil, to withdraw 
the two pieces because they are ``part of cultural traditions that 
have been lost and Aleuts are struggling to regain.'' Ms. Young has 
also suggested that Ms. de Menil donate the objects to the association. 
Ms. de Menil turned down the request; her husband, the anthropologist 
Edmund Carpenter, responded last Friday to Ms. Young's letter, noting 
that since 1990, federal law ``allows your organization to take possession 
of virtually any object relating to Aleut heritage in virtually every 
museum in the United States.'' He added that ``as a safety factor,'' 
it was better that privately held specimens remain so. ``Tribal museums 
still lack adequate funding to guarantee protection,'' he wrote. ``I 
fear much may be lost. We agree on goals; we differ on immediate action.'' 
(Both Ms. Young and Carpenter made copies of their letters available 
to The New York Times.) The Native American Graves Protection and 
Repatriation Act of 1990 requires federally financed museums and institutions 
to compile inventories of their Indian collections and to work with 
tribes and Indian nations on the return of their human remains, ritual 
objects and items of cultural patrimony. Earlier this month, for instance, 
the National Museum of the American Indian in Manhattan returned more 
than 400 sacred masks to the six-member Iroquois confederation, near 
Buffalo. Collectors, dealers and private institutions like auction 
houses, however, are generally not bound by this law. And in recent 
years, Indian groups have publicly and privately tried to persuade 
collectors to accept their view of ritual artifacts and their importance 
in the continuing cultural life of Indian communities. Many American 
Indians and their non-Indian advocates uphold the traditional notion 
that ritual objects are living, sacred beings. Ms. Young, a non-Indian 
archeologist trained at the University of Pennsylvania and the Smithsonian 
Institution, who has had 20 years' experience working in museums in 
Alaska, explained that the wood mask in the Sotheby's auction ``was 
not created for sale but for ceremonial purposes.'' It was then put 
in a cave and ``left to return to earth.'' ``The most important thing 
that this object represents to people nowadays,'' she said, ``would 
be the spirituality their ancestors had, as well as their creative 
and artistic qualities.'' Ms. Young is not arguing for the return 
of the pieces because they are ceremonial or religious objects. Rather, 
she contends, Aleuts, who are mostly Russian Orthodox, need to have 
these objects close by and accessible in order to learn about their 
rich cultural past. Aleuts are undergoing ``an unprecedented cultural 
revival,'' she said, but most of what has survived of their exquisitely 
crafted objects is not in Alaska. The ancient Aleut culture and people 
were almost wiped out by the Russians in the mid-18th century. The 
islands were sold to the United States in 1867 with the purchase of 
Alaska. ``Things calmed down,'' Ms. Young said, and ``communities 
could go back to the traditions that they could remember.'' Then came 
World War II, when the Japanese took the residents of one island to 
a prisoner-of-war camp in Japan, and the United States removed the 
rest of the Aleuts to internment camps. Carpenter said he recognized 
that ``collectively the white culture has a lot to answer for.'' But 
he was disturbed, he said, by a political correctness in which ``we 
treat all victims as heroes.'' He said he had a deep interest in Indian 
cultures and, with his wife, had long acquired tribal pieces on behalf 
of public museums. Even though he believes that people should ``possess 
and identify with their own history,'' he said, ``art is not something 
you inherit; it's something you earn. And the makers of the objects 
are artists, the objects examined by a community of alert critics, 
their own people.'' He also said he was not sanguine about a large-scale 
removal of objects to Indian heritage centers. Many of the major Eskimo 
sites in Alaska are being looted, he said. On a recent visit to Point 
Hope in Alaska, where there was supposed to be a protected Eskimo 
site of hundreds of Ipiutak house ruins dating from about A.D. 600-1200, 
he said he found ample evidence of recent looting. Ms. Young said 
she understood Carpenter's concern about preservation. But, she said, 
``every Alaska native group that I know who is building a tribal heritage 
center is concerned about the preservation of objects in their care.'' 
Ms. Young's tribal group and others like it are being helped in their 
quest to recover ritual objects by the Manhattan-based American Indian 
Ritual Object Repatriation Foundation. Its president, Elizabeth Sackler, 
a daughter of Arthur Sackler, a noted collector of antiquities, created 
her foundation soon after a 1991 Sotheby's auction when the Hopi and 
Navajo tribes unsuccessfully tried to have three sacred masks withdrawn 
from the auction block. At the auction, Ms. Sackler purchased the 
masks and returned the objects to the tribes. The Aleuts are not the 
only Indian tribe seeking to halt the auction of objects in Sotheby's 
sale on Wednesday. Dale Ann Frye Sherman, the repatriation coordinator 
of the Yurok tribe in Northern California, sent a fax to Sotheby's 
Sunday, requesting that the consignor consider withdrawing from the 
sale an important apron used in religious ceremonies ``until such 
time as we can find a way to buy it ourselves.'' Through the foundation, 
a collector recently returned a basket cap to the Yurok tribe. ``This 
summer,'' Ms. Sherman said, ``it came and danced in ceremonies.'' 
The skirt, or apron, worn by the dancer was similar to the one in 
the Sotheby's sale, with its intricate rows of shells. The essence 
of the skirt at Sotheby's, she added, ``is a celebration of life and 
it was made so that the creator could see it and know that we the 
community are grateful.''
