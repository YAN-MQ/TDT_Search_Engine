Spain under the rule of dictator Gen. Francisco Franco played only 
a minor role in trafficking art stolen by the Nazis from Holocaust 
victims, according to a government report quoted in a Sunday newspaper. 
The report will be presented at an upcoming conference in Washington 
to discuss what to do about billions of dollars worth of art looted 
by the Nazis that has since found its way into public and private 
collections around the world, leading daily El Pais said. The paper 
said the report recognizes that Franco's government protected five 
alleged art smugglers from extradition, and that a further 15 operated 
in Spain. But this gave Spain only a ``modest'' role in the looted 
art network, as there were an estimated 2,000 art traffickers working 
in Europe as a whole, the report concluded according to El Pais. The 
report details the protection given to Alois Miedl, a wealthy German 
banker who had good contacts with collectors around the world and 
a personal friendship with Hitler's right-hand-man Herman Goering. 
Miedl entered Spain in 1944 with 22 paintings _ including a Van Dyck, 
two Corots and a David _ allegedly stolen from the collection of Dutch 
Jewish millionaire Jacque Goudstikker. In the years that followed 
Franco refused to bow to pressure to extradite Miedl from the Dutch 
government, aided by the allies. The whereabouts of the paintings 
is now a mystery, El Pais said. Spain is among the 44 nations and 
13 nongovernmental organizations to take part in the four-day Washington 
conference due to start Monday and expected to draft guidelines regarding 
how to deal with art that may have been stolen by the Nazis. The Nazis, 
beginning in 1933 in Germany, looted an estimated dlrs 9 billion to 
drls 14 billion in art and other assets from Jews in 20 countries 
or regions they occupied. The current value of the assets is estimated 
at drls 90 billion to dlrs 140 billion. Switzerland's two largest 
commercial banks have recently agreed to pay dlrs 1.25 billion to 
Holocaust survivors and their heirs for lost assets.
