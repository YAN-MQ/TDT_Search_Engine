This is what late November is made for: A vulnerable nonconference 
opponent. An adoring home crowd. A chance to pad an impressive record. 
Rutgers took full advantage Sunday in the championship of the Coca-Cola 
Classic. Using a stifling zone defense and superior quickness, the 
Scarlet Knights defeated Arizona State, 67-48, at the Louis Brown 
Athletic Center. The Sun Devils (2-1) shot just 27 percent (13 of 
48) and endured a nine-minute drought in which a manageable 45-34 
deficit with 16 minutes 35 seconds remaining turned into a 60-34 margin. 
The 11th-ranked Scarlet Knights shot 49 percent and outrebounded the 
taller Sun Devils, 42-27. Rutgers improved its record to 6-1, the 
best start since 1990-91, when the Scarlet Knights were 7-0. And it 
did so despite missing three prominent players because of injury and 
illness. ``Who could have believed we could have maintained as we 
did?'' Rutgers Coach C. Vivian Stringer said. The Scarlet Knights 
have developed the kind of depth that can withstand key absences against 
teams such as Arizona State. Whether they can adjust against quality 
opponents remains to be seen. ``We cannot allow adversity to kill 
us,'' Stringer said. ``It is trying to. My patience is being tested. 
When I see the way the kids played today, it proves that the human 
spirit is very resilient.'' Players adopted unfamiliar roles as their 
own over the weekend. Shawnetta Stewart, the team's steadiest scorer, 
assumed much of the ball-handling duties in the absence of point guard 
Tasha Pointer, whose herniated disk has created numbness in one leg. 
Stewart collected 15 points, 8 rebounds and 6 assists Sunday, earning 
most valuable player honors for the tournament. (She had 9 points 
and 8 rebounds in a 70-47 victory over Buffalo on Saturday.) ``We 
have got it rough, but truthfully, I don't think this is the toughest 
that is going to hit us,'' Stewart said. The sophomore center Tammy 
Sutton-Brown logged an energetic 25 minutes, scoring 11 points and 
grabbing 9 rebounds in place of the senior Jen Clemente. Clemente 
was released from the hospital Sunday after doctors were able to dissolve 
a blood clot in her lung. Stringer estimated Clemente's return at 
six weeks to three months, but she might be out for the season. The 
freshman forward Davalyn Cunningham saw her first significant court 
time over the weekend after Usha Gilmore sustained a concussion last 
week. Gilmore was so sure she would play that her parents visited 
from South Carolina to watch, but lingering headaches and poor peripheral 
vision left her on the bench. Cunningham scored 13 points, her second 
double-digit effort in the Coca-Cola Classic. Forward Linda Miles 
added 13 points, had three steals and energized a Rutgers defense 
that forced 16 Sun Devil turnovers in the first half and limited Arizona 
State to 15 percent shooting in the second half. The Sun Devils, who 
received 16 points from center Rachel Holt, committed eight turnovers 
in 10 possessions in one first-half span as Rutgers built a 26-13 
lead. Arizona State shrank the deficit to 31-27 before its shooting 
touch turned ice cold. ``When you're the 11th-ranked team and you're 
missing a few key players, you can overcome it,'' Arizona State Coach 
Charli Turner Thorne said. ``When you're building a program and missing 
some players, you can't do it. We played intimidated; we played hesitant. 
I know for a fact we're a much better team than the way we played.'' 
Rutgers knows it could be better if its players healed. In the dwindling 
days of November, all a coach can do is hope. ``It would really be 
sad and difficult for me to handle if we can't fulfill ourselves,'' 
Stringer said. ``I just believe that we as a team are capable of so 
much.''
