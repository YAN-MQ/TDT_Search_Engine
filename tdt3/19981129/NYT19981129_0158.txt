Dante B. Fascell, a Florida Democratic congressman who was chairman 
of the House Foreign Affairs Committee from 1984 through 1992, died 
on Saturday at his home in Clearwater, Fla. He was 81 and had lived 
in Miami until June. The cause was colon cancer, The Associated Press 
reported. Fascell (pronounced Fah-SELL) began serving on the Foreign 
Affairs Committee in 1957. He was a strong supporter of Israel and 
a fervent opponent of President Fidel Castro of Cuba. He represented 
voters in Dade County and in the Florida Keys from 1955 through 1992, 
when he did not run for re-election. Last month, President Clinton 
awarded him the Presidential Medal of Freedom with a citation calling 
him ``a man of reason and conscience'' who was ``courageous in war 
and public service.'' Fascell strongly favored bipartisanship in foreign 
policy. In his last years in Congress he frequently voted with Republicans 
on foreign policy issues, particularly those involving Latin America. 
His opposition to any softening of U.S. policy toward the Castro government 
and his backing of the Reagan administration's efforts to undermine 
the Sandinistas were welcomed by immigrants from Cuba and Nicaragua, 
who constituted 40 percent of the population of his district. In the 
debate over U.S. policy after Iraq invaded Kuwait, in 1990, and before 
the Persian Gulf War, in 1991, he was one of the leading Democrats 
who supported President Bush's decision to send American forces to 
the area and to form a coalition with other nations to defeat Saddam 
Hussein. In an interview last year, Fascell said he took pride in 
his fight for human rights abroad, particularly on behalf of people 
_ known as ``refuseniks'' _ who had been prevented from leaving the 
Soviet Bloc. ``Ultimately,'' he said, ``our human rights effort helped 
lead to the disintegration of the entire eastern empire.'' In domestic 
affairs, he was regarded as a liberal on social and environmental 
issues, and he gained admiration from Floridians for his ability to 
direct federal money to projects he favored. Fascell's decision not 
to run in 1992 surprised many Floridians. Political analysts said 
a significant factor was that he had been seriously affected by a 
court-ordered plan for the reapportionment of congressional districts. 
After stepping down, Fascell, who served in the Florida legislature 
from 1951 to 1954, became a partner in a Miami law firm, Holland and 
Knight. He is survived by his wife of 57 years, the former Jeanne-Marie 
Pelot; two daughters, Sandra Diamond of Clearwater and Toni Strother 
of Miami; three grandchildren; a brother, Rudy, who lives near Tampa, 
Fla., and a sister, Vera Porfiri of Coral Gables, Fla. Fascell was 
born in Bridgehampton, N.Y., to Charles A. Fascell and the former 
Mary Gullotti, who were immigrants from Italy. The family moved to 
Miami while he was a child. He received a law degree from the University 
of Miami in 1938, was admitted to the Florida bar in that year and 
had a private law practice in Miami before and after World War II. 
During the war, he served in the Army in North Africa and Italy, rose 
to be a captain and commanded a truck company. Later he said his war 
service had persuaded him to pursue a career in public service. ``If 
American men are going to be sent to war,'' he said, ``I want to know 
why and be part of the process that decides whether they should go.''
