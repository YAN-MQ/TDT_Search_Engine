It's hard to get to Alice Munro, to the little town of Clinton, Ontario, 
where she lives in the rolling farmland of southern Canada. In the 
autumn light, Clinton seems bleak, a cluster of small undistinguished 
houses of wood or yellow brick set in rich black soil, overwhelmed 
by the landscape around it. With its unforgiving climate, Clinton 
is not for the uncourageous. But Ms. Munro will never leave. She finds 
her stories here amid the descendants of the Scottish settlers, with 
their modest, restrained ways, their short, to-the-point sentences. 
It's all the material she could ever want. ``I love living here,'' 
Ms. Munro said. ``I love the landscape so much _ more than love it. 
It's something I know so thoroughly I don't want to detach from it. 
I like living in isolation.'' Alice Munro has been called one of the 
best short-story writers in the English language. Her books sell about 
25,000 to 30,000 copies a year, very good for a short-story writer. 
She is a writer other writers admire for her technical skills and 
the purity of her style. She is known for the complex structure of 
her stories. A typical Alice Munro story might begin at a point that 
most writers would consider the end, then jump to a time 10 years 
later, then back again. ``With Alice it's like a shorthand,'' said 
Richard Ford, the novelist. ``You'll just mention her, and everybody 
just kind of generally nods, that she's just sort of as good as it 
gets.'' Reviewing her new book, ``The Love of a Good Woman'' (Alfred 
A. Knopf) in The New York Times this month, Michael Gorra compared 
Ms. Munro to Wordsworth, who can ``collapse one moment, one memory, 
into another with an unrivaled combination of clarity and subtlety.'' 
She has been awarded Canada's Governor General's Award three times. 
This month she won the Giller Prize, at $25,000 one of Canada's biggest 
literary awards. And she always comes back to Clinton. ``It's not 
a really beautiful landscape,'' Ms. Munro admitted. But ``I love a 
life apart from the whole world of writing.'' Every winter she takes 
a break at her condominium in Comox, British Columbia. Ms. Munro's 
stories are about ordinary people: their secrets, their memories of 
acts of violence, their sexual longings. In ``Cortes Island,'' in 
her new collection, a would-be writer takes a job caring for an old 
man, Gorrie. Ms. Munro writes that the narrator is aware of ``his 
pungent smell, his jelly eye, his dog's teeth.'' But she has sexual 
dreams about him, ``pagan'' dreams ``in which the attack, the response, 
the possibilities, went beyond anything life offered.'' ``And from 
which romance was banished. Decency as well. Our bed _ Gorrie's and 
mine _ was the gravelly beach or the rough boat deck or the punishing 
coils of greasy rope.'' In ``Before the Change,'' another harrowing 
story in the new collection, a woman discovers her father is an abortionist. 
She assists him as he operates. ``He had a series of rods, all of 
the same length but of a graduated thickness,'' the character says. 
``I could not see the actual, intimate progress of these instruments. 
But I could feel it, from the arriving waves of pain in her body that 
beat down the spasms of apprehension.'' ``The thing I feel most strongly 
makes a story is a kind of primordial moment, an awful revelation, 
that you can't do anything about,'' Ms. Munro explained. Some stories 
in the collection are about what Ms. Munro calls ``a new kind of old 
woman, women who grew up under one set of rules and then found they 
could live with another.'' The ``new kind of old woman'' is about 
60, has been something of a hippie in her youth, has had a period 
of irresponsibility, an affair and has sometimes in effect abandoned 
her children to the care of others. ``We associate old women with 
conventional sexual morality,'' said Ms. Munro, who is 67. But ``a 
lot of women lived more risky lives than their daughters. You take 
the risk of being lonely.'' Ms. Munro's favorite story in her new 
book is ``Save the Reaper.'' A grandmother who had a daughter out 
of wedlock feels her daughter's resentment. One day the older woman 
picks up a hitchhiker, a girl, who makes a sexual pass at her. At 
the end the woman wonders if the girl will ever come back and see 
her again. But, Ms. Munro writes: ``The girl wouldn't come. Much better 
offers would turn up before she'd stood 10 minutes by the highway. 
More dangerous offers perhaps, but more interesting.'' Ms. Munro was 
raised in Wingham, Ontario, 20 miles from Clinton. Her father, Robert 
Laidlaw, was a fox farmer, her mother a former teacher. Ancestors 
have been in Huron County since the 1850s. Ms. Munro's story ``A Wilderness 
Station'' was inspired by an ancestor who was killed by a falling 
tree. In Ms. Munro's version, a woman claims to have murdered her 
husband. Like other Munro stories, ``A Wilderness Station'' deals 
with an unsolved murder. It turns out the man was killed by his brother. 
Ms. Munro's family was poor, she says. When the family farm failed, 
her father worked in a foundry. He longed to write a novel and finished 
his first novel just before his death at 75. ``The McGregors: A Novel 
of an Ontario Pioneer Family,'' was published a short time later. 
Ms. Munro began writing poetry secretly at the age of 11. She was 
an avid reader, benefiting, she points out, from the library system 
that Andrew Carnegie established in Canada. But she was raised to 
be a farmer's wife. ``In my background, ambition isn't valued,'' she 
said. ``Being modest and accepting your limitations and trying not 
to stand out; it's a tribal value.'' When she was 12, her mother became 
ill with Parkinson's disease. Ms. Munro took over the household until 
she won a two-year scholarship to the University of Western Ontario. 
While a student, she sold her first story, to the Canadian Broadcasting 
Company. She also met a fellow student, James Munro, whom she married. 
The Munros had three daughters: Sheila, now 45; Jenny, 41, and Andrea, 
31. A fourth daughter died at birth. Ms. Munro struggled to be a mother 
and a writer. Her husband, she said, was supportive. ``Quite early 
she used to send stories to The New Yorker,'' he remembered recently. 
``They came back so fast,'' he said, that she had the feeling that 
someone's job was just to send them back. ``She had a whole lot of 
guilt about writing,'' Mr. Munro said. ``Her friends phoned and she 
wouldn't tell them.'' Ms. Munro suffered deep depressions. ``I was 
doing two jobs and not doing either one of them as well as I wished,'' 
she said of the years spent being a mother and trying to write. She 
also felt, she said, that being intellectually serious would compromise 
her femininity, that if she fulfilled her talent as a writer she would 
lose her sexual attractiveness. In one of her most famous stories, 
``The Albanian Virgin,'' a Canadian woman is kidnapped during the 
1920s by Albanian bandits. The woman renounces her sexuality, carries 
a weapon and lives like a man. ``It's about virgins who opt out of 
sex,'' Ms. Munro said. ``That's when you get the right to carry a 
gun, to eat at the men's table, with women waiting on you.'' ``I decided 
to camouflage my seriousness behind my sexuality,'' Ms. Munro said. 
The Munros moved to Victoria, British Columbia, where Munro founded 
a bookstore, Munro's Books. ``I started working in the store,'' she 
said. ``I got out of my depression and started to write.'' In 1968 
her first book, ``Dance of the Happy Shades,'' was published in Canada, 
and she won the Governor General's Award. In 1971, came her only novel, 
``Lives of Girls and Women.'' She has never written another novel. 
``I just can't,'' she said, adding that when she begins to stretch 
her stories into novels, ``They start to sag. I'm thinking of something 
now, how it might be a novel. I betcha it won't be! My ambition is 
to write a novel before I die.'' In 1972, Ms. Munro and her husband 
were divorced. Ms. Munro moved back to Ontario, and Gerald Fremlin, 
whom she had known in college, resurfaced in her life. He had gone 
on to become a geographer. ``We drank three martinis,'' she said, 
``and we very speedily decided we were going to stay together.'' They 
were married in 1976. With ``The Moons of Jupiter,'' published in 
the United States in 1983, Ms. Munro caught the notice of American 
reviewers, and her next book, ``The Progress of Love,'' in 1986, was 
lavishly praised by critics. Today, Ms. Munro lives an isolated life 
in the small white clapboard house where Fremlin was raised. Ms. Munro 
begins writing first thing in the morning. ``I don't speak to Gerry. 
I write for three to four hours, not answering the phone, not getting 
out of my night clothes.'' She revises extensively and then sends 
her work straight to her agent in New York. ``I would never give my 
work to anyone to read,'' she said. ``I have too little confidence, 
not the real confidence to be a writer.'' She added, ``Even Gerry 
doesn't read my work.'' ``Yes I do,'' said Fremlin. ``But we don't 
discuss it.''
