Pope John Paul II is starting the Catholic church's countdown to the 
year 2000. In a ceremony at the Vatican today, the Pontiff issued 
an edict declaring it a holy year. The edict includes ways Catholics 
can help ensure a speedy ascendence into heaven, such as abstaining 
from smoking and drinking and giving to charity during the holy year.
