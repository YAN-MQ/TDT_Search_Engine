Kurleigh King, the Caribbean Community's secretary-general from 1978 
to 1983, has died of cancer, officials in Barbados confirmed Sunday. 
He was 65. His death Friday night came only hours before that of William 
Demas, the trade group's first secretary-general, in a Trinidadian 
hospital. King's death in Iowa, where he had been living, was confirmed 
by Winston Cox, governor of the Barbados Central Bank. King directed 
the bank between 1987 and 1992. Both King and Demas are credited with 
helping English-speaking Caribbean countries survive recessions and 
establish stable economies following independence from Britain. A 
former director of finance and planning for the Barbadian government, 
King helped build the country's economy into one of the strongest 
in the Caribbean as general manager of the Barbados Industrial Development 
Corp. He was assistant dean of the graduate school of business at 
Columbia University in New York City from 1967 to 1968. King opposed 
devaluation of the Barbadian dollar during the early 1990s, a position 
that many analysts said helped that country survive a global recession. 
``The way he led the bank during the difficult years the economy went 
through was a true reflection of his character and one which gained 
him a lot of respect in and outside the bank,'' said Calvin Springer, 
King's successor as bank president, told the Barbados Advocate. In 
1983, Queen Elizabeth II and the Barbadian government awarded King 
the Gold Crown of Merit of Barbados for his contribution to Caribbean 
cooperation. He is survived by his wife, Bernice King, and a daughter, 
Marcia Muttoo.
