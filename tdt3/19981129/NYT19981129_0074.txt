The leader of the rebels in Congo said Sunday that he had not heard 
the details of a cease-fire agreement announced on Saturday in Paris 
and could not yet commit to it. The rebel leader, Ernest Wamba dia 
Wamba, said he hoped that the pact would end the fighting. But, speaking 
by telephone from a remote town in northeastern Congo, he said fighting 
would continue until details of the cease-fire became clear. And he 
repeated a demand that President Laurent Kabila has rejected time 
and again. ``The next step would be substantive and direct negotiations 
between us and the government of Kabila,'' dia Wamba said. Kabila 
has been battling an insurgency that began in August in the nation, 
which was called Zaire under the long dictatorship of Mobutu Sese 
Seko. Kabila has refused to meet directly with the rebels, and it 
was unclear whether he agreed in Paris to do so. Dia Wamba's comments 
added yet another element of uncertainty to the accord, announced 
by French President Jacques Chirac and U.N. Secretary General Kofi 
Annan at a meeting of African leaders this weekend. The war in Congo 
became the focus of the summit meeting in Paris because of its potential 
to spread into a major regional conflict. Already, Uganda and Rwanda 
support the rebels militarily, and four other nations _ Zimbabwe, 
Angola, Namibia and Chad _ support Kabila. After meetings with leaders 
of Uganda, Rwanda, Angola and Zimbabwe, as well as with Kabila, Annan 
and Chirac said they had secured promises that a cease-fire pact would 
be signed by mid-December, before a meeting of the Organization of 
African Unity. But there was no written accord, and afterward the 
parties could not agree on exactly what they had pledged to do. Even 
as he called the pact ``preliminary,'' Kabila said late Saturday that 
he and his allies would sign a pledge in Lusaka, Zambia, on Dec. 8 
to end the hostilities . Officials from South Africa and Uganda cast 
doubt, however, on whether any real progress had been made. Sunday, 
a Rwandan official said there could be no progress until Kabila met 
with the rebels. Until then, said Patrick Mazimhaka, Rwanda's minister 
of state, the accord is ``not worth anything.'' Kabila, who took power 
only last year, has said he will not meet with the rebels because 
the conflict is essentially an ``invasion'' by Uganda and Rwanda. 
Those two countries _ contending that they need to secure their own 
borders from rebels based in Congo _ have sent troops to support the 
Congolese rebels. The insurgent leader, dia Wamba, said Sunday that 
his representatives in Paris had not yet reported back to him on the 
talks. He said, however, that he could support any initiative that 
included direct negotiations with Kabila.
