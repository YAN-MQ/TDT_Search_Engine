The Muslim-based United Development Party opened a national convention 
Sunday to elect a new chairman to lead the opposition group into multiparty 
elections next year. Waving its signature green flags, more than 110,000 
party members and supporters gathered inside the soccer stadium at 
Jakarta's Senayan sports complex as Ismail Hasan Metareum, the party's 
chairman, kicked off the four-day congress. ``We call on President 
(B.J.) Habibie to carry out the general election in time and not to 
repeat the mistakes by two previous presidents,'' Matareum said in 
his opening speech, calling for ``honest and fair'' general elections. 
Habibie had earlier planned to open the congress but canceled his 
appearance. Matareum told reporters afterward that Habibie decided 
not to attend in order ``to make the party more independent.'' In 
Indonesia it has been a tradition for the president to be invited 
to open any congress of a political or mass organization. Habibie, 
who has been distancing himself from the practices of the Suharto 
era, is a member of the ruling Golkar Party. Representatives from 
27 provinces and 330 districts are taking part in the United Development 
Party's fourth convention, which lasts through Wednesday. Deliberations 
are to be held on the eastern outskirts of the capital. The party, 
known as the PPP, was set up in January 1973 as a fusion of four Islamic 
political parties. Some of the four, however, have set up their own 
parties for next year's polls. Matareum cited bureaucracy and anarchism 
as the two main threats faced by the nation during its transition 
period from the dictatorship of former President Suharto. Suharto, 
77, resigned in May _ just two months after being elected to a seventh 
five-year term _ amid violence and widespread protests against his 
32-year authoritarian rule. He was succeeded by Habibie, his vice 
president. Suharto had succeeded Sukarno, Indonesia's founding president. 
The PPP gained 89 of the 425 seats in Parliament in the 1997 general 
election. The ruling Golkar party, the main vehicle of former autocrat 
Suharto, won 325 while the minor Indonesian Democratic Party picked 
up 11 seats in the 500-seat Parliament. The country's highest legislative 
body has decided that the next general elections should be held in 
May or early June next year under new political laws that allow many 
more parties competing for 550 seats. The main contenders for the 
PPP chairmanship are Hamzah Haz and Ahmad Muflih Saefuddin, both Cabinet 
ministers under Habibie's reform administration. Party supporters 
marched in small scattered groups along streets in the capital after 
the opening ceremony but there were no reports of violence. Indonesia 
has been hit by renewed political violence in recent days as student 
demonstrators have demanded Suharto be put on trial. On Nov. 13, nine 
protesting students were shot dead by Indonesian troops.
