The Iranian navy will hold exercises _ some involving missiles _ starting 
Monday in the Gulf, the official Islamic Republic News Agency reported 
Sunday. IRNA said the five days of maneuvers, code-named Unity 77, 
would involve some 50,000 troops. The agency, in a report monitored 
by the British Broadcasting Corp., said the exercises would extend 
from the central Gulf to the Strait of Hormuz and into the Gulf of 
Oman. The report quoted Isa Galverdi, a commander of the Islamic Revolutionary 
Guards Corps, as saying that the guards as well as army and air force 
units would participate. ``In these exercises, 160 naval vessels and 
120 aircraft will take part, and the latter will conduct 350 sorties,'' 
Galverdi said. He said the war games would involve missile-launching 
units of the Revolutionary Guards and that mock ``electronic warfare 
will be carried out over a wide area.'' Among the maneuvers' goals 
will be assessing the country's defense against chemical, biological 
and nuclear attacks, the report said. It will be the largest military 
exercise by Iran since September, when some 70,000 Iranian troops 
held war games near the border with Afghanistan to show Iran's displeasure 
over the Taliban militia's detention of a number of Iranians.
