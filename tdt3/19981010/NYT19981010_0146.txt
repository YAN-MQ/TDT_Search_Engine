As Bill Mannetti strides through a swampy piece of state land near 
the Quinnipiac River, he points out spots where a trapper might place 
a beaver trap or a coyote trap _ there at the bottom of that small 
hill, here in this shallow of the river. Mannetti holds the permit 
for trapping on this land, but he hasn't set a single trap. An animal 
rights advocate for 12 years, he has bid on the exclusive right to 
trap animals on parcels of state property _ then in effect declared 
the land a trap-free zone. ``Most people in Connecticut thought that 
trapping went the way of the pillory and the thumbscrew,'' he said. 
``People assume this doesn't exist anymore.'' This year, Mannetti, 
founder of Animal Rights Front, has joined with other animal rights 
advocates in a campaign that could win them permits for about 45,000 
acres, nearly a third of the state land where trapping is allowed. 
Frustrated by years of losing the battle to ban certain kinds of animal 
traps statewide through legislation, the advocates took a different 
approach. ``We went to the ground,'' Mannetti said. ``It's public 
land _ our land. We had no choice but to enter the program and, in 
a sense, to undermine it. We'll spare some animals from very hard, 
cruel deaths.'' The strategy has infuriated trappers, who say the 
animal rights advocates are subverting a legitimate state program 
that is needed to control the wildlife population. Their outcry has 
led state officials to consider changing the rules so that people 
could not bid on the property unless they had trapped animals, which 
would prevent the animal rights advocates from bidding. ``They just 
bid extraordinarily high and try to get these properties.'' said Robert 
Crook, a lobbyist for the Coalition of Connecticut Sportsmen. ``Animal 
rights people don't like any animals killed. That's their mission 
in life. That's certainly not the state's mission in life.'' ``I don't 
think they should impose their philosophy or their vegetarianism on 
us,'' Crook added. The animal rights advocates' strategy is similar 
to one used by conservationists in the West who have tried to win 
the grazing rights on government-owned land to prevent overgrazing. 
Yet they are often thwarted, as in Idaho, where the state Legislature 
changed the law so that only ranchers could bid on state grazing land. 
And while Connecticut animal rights advocates have been successful 
so far, the state may change the rules here so that they cannot bid 
on the land next year. Under current rules, only licensed trappers 
can bid on the approximately 120 parcels of state land where trapping 
is allowed during the winter on 11 species of animals: beaver, raccoon, 
skunk, possum, coyote, red fox, gray fox, muskrat, weasel, river otter 
and mink. Mannetti was the first animal rights advocate to take the 
state course to become licensed, and thus became eligible to bid for 
trapping rights. Now the state is considering several alternative 
rules, said Paul Rego, a state wildlife biologist, including a requirement 
that bidders must have actually trapped animals, as opposed to just 
holding a license. Connecticut could also, like many other states, 
allow anyone to trap on those parcels, doing away with the bidding 
process altogether, he said. ``Our position is, wildlife has to be 
managed,'' Crook said. ``Certainly it's the position of the DEP And 
if you have an element trying to prevent the management of wildlife, 
some action has to be taken.'' Trappers pushed the state to make the 
change in policy this year. Instead, the state is issuing permits 
for one year _ rather than the traditional four years _ to give officials 
time to consider the issue. The decision has drawn criticism from 
both trappers and animals rights advocates, who charge Gov. John Rowland's 
administration with waiting to make a controversial decision until 
after the election. ``It's purely a political move,'' said Alan Huot, 
a trapper. ``It's a reflection of the administration's shyness for 
anything that is a controversy.'' Rowland did not address that charge 
at a news conference Friday, but he did say that though he opposes 
trapping as a hobby, he feels it is a necessary tool for dealing with 
nuisance animals. Last year, the animal rights advocates held the 
permits on about 5,000 acres. This year they said they had hoped to 
win the rights to about 70,000 acres. After bids were opened on Friday, 
however, it seemed the advocates fell short of their goal, winning 
permits to about 44,000 acres and losing some parcels to trappers 
who bid higher than expected. It will not be known who won the permits 
for at least a week. David Leff, the state's assistant commissioner 
for environmental conservation, said that trapping is no crueler than 
other forms of death faced by wild animals, like starvation or being 
killed by a predator. ``You've got to look at trapping within that 
context,'' Leff said. ``It's not like these are pets that are kept 
well-fed and protected from disease and enemies.'' The trappers say 
they are pursuing a tradition and often rendering a service to private 
landowner. Crook said that for years, he used to trap beavers on the 
land of a neighboring farmer who had flooding problems when they dammed 
up a nearby stream. ``I was doing the farmer a favor,'' Crook said. 
``He was doing me a favor. And everyone was happy. Except the animals 
rights people.''
