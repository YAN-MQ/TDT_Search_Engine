Israel routed San Marino's collection of amateur players 5-0 Saturday 
night in a Group 6 Euro 2000 qualifier. Israel led 3-0 at halftime, 
on goals by Haim Ravivo 16 minutes after kickoff, Avi Nimni two minutes 
later and Alon Mizrachi in the 31st. San Marino defender Vittorio 
Valentini scored an own-goal to make it 4-0 in the 68th, and Israel's 
Najuan Geryev tallied with eight minutes left to fix the final score.
