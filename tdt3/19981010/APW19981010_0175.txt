Malaysian lawyers on Saturday demanded the repeal of a law that allows 
indefinite imprisonment without trial and criticized its use to arrest 
political dissident, Anwar Ibrahim. Condemning the law as strangling 
free speech, nearly 2,500 members of the Bar Council unanimously approved 
resolutions that demanded the repeal of the Internal Security Act. 
``The ISA is an obnoxious piece of legislation undermining fundamental 
human rights, basic democratic principles and the rule of law,'' said 
one of the resolutions. The law has come under international scrutiny 
after police used it last month to arrest former deputy prime minister 
Anwar, who became Prime Minister Mahathir Mohamad's fiercest critic 
since he was fired on Sept. 2. The authorities say Anwar had to be 
detained under the act because his anti-government rallies were threatening 
public order. Police detained 17 Anwar associates under the sweeping 
law, enacted in 1960 to counter communist insurgents. Council president, 
Cyrus Das, also demanded that lawyers be allowed to carry out their 
duties without harassment by police. Many of Anwar's defense lawyers 
were outraged when they were interrogated by police in recent weeks. 
Police said questioning the lawyers was necessary to investigate the 
cases of corruption against Anwar. Hundreds of people, from mechanics 
to legislators, have been jailed over the years under the ISA on charges 
of threatening national security. The police can use the loose definition 
to justify most preventive detentions. More recently, it has been 
used against people accused of spreading racist propaganda on the 
Internet, forging passports, cloning mobile phone access codes and 
breaching copyrights. ``The abolition of the ISA is therefore imperative,'' 
said the Bar Council statement.
