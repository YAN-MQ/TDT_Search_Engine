A Japanese F-4 jet fighter that went missing in northern Japan late 
Friday has crashed into the Pacific Ocean, defense officials said 
Saturday. Rescue teams recovered broken pieces of the main wings of 
the plane, a Defense Agency spokesman said, speaking on customary 
condition of anonymity. Rescuers were still searching for the two 
pilots, who were aboard. The Air Self-Defense Forces plane disappeared 
over the Pacific just off Misawa Air Base, about 560 kilometers (350 
miles) northeast of Tokyo, on its way back from flight training. Earlier 
Saturday, Misawa Mayor Shigeyoshi Suzuki lodged a protest to the Defense 
Agency, questioning the safety of the flight training, Kyodo News 
service reported. Suzuki urged the agency to carry out a thorough 
investigation and suspend training until the investigation is completed, 
Kyodo said.
