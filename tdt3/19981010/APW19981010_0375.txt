Germany's outgoing Cabinet will give its backing to possible NATO 
military strikes in Kosovo on Monday, the defense minister was quoted 
Saturday as saying. Germany's ability to act has been in question 
since Chancellor Helmut Kohl was defeated in Sept. 27 elections. He 
formally remains in power until Chancellor-elect Gerhard Schroeder 
takes office Oct. 27. Kohl's Cabinet will ``give the green light'' 
Monday to a NATO order that authorizes alliance military commanders 
to launch the airstrikes, outgoing Defense Minister Volker Ruehe told 
the Bild am Sonntag newspaper. U.S. President Bill Clinton met Schroeder 
in Washington on Friday and said afterwards that the chancellor-elect 
had signaled Germany's support for the so-called activation order. 
Schroeder had met Kohl before his trip to coordinate policy on Kosovo. 
But whether Germany will participate in any airstrikes remained unclear. 
Kohl's offer to NATO of 14 Tornado warplanes requires a vote in parliament, 
but the newly elected lower house holds its first session only on 
Oct. 26. The old parliament could be called into session, but that 
is seen as politically awkward. The Greens party, Schroeder's future 
coalition partner, approves NATO airstrikes but rejects combat for 
German forces without a clear United Nations mandate. ``Any other 
basis for action raises infinite problems of international law and 
sets a precedent,'' Greens co-chair Juergen Trittin told Der Spiegel 
magazine. But he said the decision was up to the old government. Joschka 
Fischer, a Green in line to become foreign minister, dodged tough 
questions on Kosovo after accompanying Schroeder in the talks with 
Clinton. He and Schroeder have ``little influence on the current situation,'' 
he said late Friday on Germany's ARD television.
