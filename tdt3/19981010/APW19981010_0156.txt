Bombs planted on a railroad track tore through a military train in 
southern Russia, killing a soldier and a firefighter, a news report 
said Saturday. The two explosions occurred Friday while Interior Ministry 
troops were traveling across the steppe outside Boikatsk in the Caucasus 
Mountains republic of Dagestan, about 1,600 kilometers (1,000 miles) 
south of Moscow. The blasts sparked a fire that raged through much 
of the night, Interior Ministry official Viktor Medveditskov told 
the ITAR-Tass news agency. The motive for the bombings was unclear. 
Dagestan has been wracked by violence and kidnappings in recent months 
as various religious and ethnic groups battle for power. It has also 
been hit by spillover violence from breakaway Chechnya, on its western 
border.
