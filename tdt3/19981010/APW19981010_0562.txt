Armed with crude guns and poison-tipped bows and arrows, tribespeople 
in India's insurgency-torn northeast killed five forest guards and 
stole weapons from a forest camp Saturday, police said. The killings 
came after 17 people were killed overnight in tribal clashes in the 
remote Darrang district of the mountainous Assam state _ killings 
that came while a federal panel toured the area in a law and order 
assessment. At least 50 members of the minority Santhal tribe stormed 
the Budubadha forest department camp in a tea garden in the Kokrajhar 
district, about 1,000 miles east of New Delhi, and seized 16 rifles, 
police said. The Santhals' efforts to arm themselves could lead to 
more attacks against its rival, the majority Bodo tribe, police said. 
Bloody skirmishes since 1996 between the two tribes have left 1,000 
dead on both sides, officials say. Members of the separatist Bodo 
Liberation Tiger Force and the National Democratic Front of Bodoland 
were suspected in the killing in Darrang, Press Trust of India reported. 
The guerrillas want to carve out a separate Bodoland from Indian territory 
for the Bodos, who consist of nearly 1.2 million of Assam's 22 million 
people. The assailants in Darrang came armed with automatic weapons 
and attacked three villages late Friday night killing 14 people in 
four separate incidents. Two men and a woman were killed early on 
Saturday, PTI said. The victims included members of the majority Hindu 
community and a linguistic minority, the Times of India said. Officials 
in the state capital Gauhati told the visiting parliamentary team 
that there has been no let up in violence in the state.
