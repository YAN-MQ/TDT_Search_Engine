New York trails its series with Cleveland, 2-1, after being stymied 
by bartolo colon Friday night. They try to rate the bat of gooden, 
a former teammate. Orlando Hernandez makes his first postseason appearance 
for the bombers. Obviously a lot has happened. To get the other things 
accomplished, that would be the one thing I'd like to have also, even 
if it is the one. It's ironic, when we started talking about Hernandez 
and signing him, knowing he was related, it is a little strange to 
realize a year later that, you know, we're -- we have another her 
nan in the postseason. Hopefully our guy will make as big an impact 
as Livan did.
