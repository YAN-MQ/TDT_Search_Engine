Next week the house Judiciary committee and the White House start 
talks on the impending impeachment inquiry against President Clinton. 
The panel's chairman, republican hen rye Hyde, is acceding to plans 
to call Kenneth Starr as a witness. Hyde previously apposed that. 
Hearings probably will begin in mid-November. Hyde says it's important 
that people understand the reason for the inquiry. We insist that 
this has very little to do with sex. No one is charging the president 
with breaking his marriage vows. That's not on the table. What we 
are concerned about is subornation of perjury, perjury, that's swearing 
under oath to something you know is false, tampering with witnesses, 
obstructing justice. Those are the charges that impact on the public, 
impact on the job of the president and that's what we're looking at. 
And sex is another one of those Ken Starr diversionary issues that 
they would like to characterize this dispute about. It isn't.
