It's a busy day on Capitol Hill. Congress is holding a rare Saturday 
session to hammer out details of a budget. The new fiscal year actually 
began October 1st. Temporary spending measures have kept the government 
running since then. The latest signed into law last night will expire 
at midnight on Monday. Some congressional leaders are meeting with 
White House officials behind closed doors in an effort to break the 
stalemate in negotiations. One of the key issues is education funding. 
Republicans say President Clinton is bogging down talks with new spending 
proposals. Republicans say President Clinton is bogging down talks 
with new spending proposals. Democrats are accusing republicans of 
shortchanging a national priority. Our republican colleagues want 
to adjourn this Congress for a three-month recess. Democrats would 
like to go home, too, especially those of us that are running for 
re-election. But we are committed to staying on the job for as long 
as it takes to deal with the urgent needs facing Americas public schools 
and the children who depend on them. The fact of the matter is they're 
right, that they want more money for everything. But on education, 
there's no disagreement that we need to focus on education in America. 
That's why the Congress has already passed this year higher education, 
vocational education and education savings accounts which the president 
vetoed. We care a lot about that. I particularly do. I'm a product 
of education. My mother was a former schoolteacher. My children went 
to public schools. I care a lot about public education. The president 
and vice president never spent a day in public school in their lives, 
so who's credible on this subject? President Clinton is urging Congress 
to pass his education program. Lawmakers have promised to work through 
Columbus day to pass a budget. In his weekly radio address, Mr. Clinton 
said there is still time for them to act on his education proposals. 
Small classes, trained teachers, modern schools, our standards, public 
school choice and more -- this is a plan that can revolutionize education 
in America. But the republican majority in Congress hasn't even passed 
the annual education investment Bill yet. When it comes to education, 
Congress simply must not settle for an incomplete.
