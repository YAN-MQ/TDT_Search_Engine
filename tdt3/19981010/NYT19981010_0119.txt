It is an eye-catching piece of jewelry _ a gold chain and a pendant 
shaped like a bulldog's head, with rubies for eyes _ and it cost Marvin 
McIntosh his life, say prosecutors in New York City's second death 
penalty trial since capital punishment was revived in the state three 
years ago. Witnesses call it the ``bulldog gold chain,'' and prosecutors 
say that on a night in May 1996 McIntosh was shot to death on a street 
in East New York, Brooklyn, while resisting three robbers who wanted 
it. Two of the robbers shot the 28-year-old victim, prosecutors say, 
but they contend that the fatal bullets were fired by Jermaine Page, 
24, the defendant on trial in state Supreme Court in Brooklyn. Page 
faces a possible death sentence if convicted of first-degree murder. 
Page's lawyers say that the person who fired the fatal shots was not 
their client but a teen-ager who is to be tried later on a charge 
of second-degree murder, which is not punishable by death. Page's 
lawyers also hold that the death arose not from a robbery but rather 
from a dispute over a dice game. They have suggested that Page did 
not fire any shots. The jury will decide these issues after its deliberations 
begin sometime this week. But one matter seems clear: when McIntosh, 
who lived in Staten Island and worked for a private mail delivery 
service, bought the chain and pendant at a Brooklyn store two months 
before he was slain, he paid a good deal more than those accused of 
taking it were likely to get for it. He paid $1,000. After his death, 
the case file shows, an appraiser estimated its value as used jewelry 
at about $300. Both sides have presented witnesses to back their differing 
versions of the confrontation that ended with what one prosecutor, 
Barry Schreiber, described to the jury as McIntosh's execution. That 
characterization perhaps hinted at why Schreiber's boss, Brooklyn 
District Attorney Charles Hynes decided to seek the death penalty 
for Page, under the 1995 law that reinstated capital punishment in 
the state. When he made the decision in 1996, Hynes gave no reason 
other than to say that he had reviewed the ``aggravating and mitigating 
factors'' in the case. In the state's first trial under the new law, 
also in Brooklyn, a former jail guard, Darrel Harris, was convicted 
of first-degree murder in May for the execution-style killings of 
three people in a robbery, and in June the jury sentenced him to death. 
In Page's trial, the prosecution has sought to portray him as a heartless 
killer who gloried in the spoils of his street robbery. ``He fled 
and was found with that bulldog hanging around his neck like a trophy,'' 
Schreiber told the jury, referring to testimony by Larry Rilee, a 
detective from the Newport News Police Department in Virginia. Rilee 
said that when Page had been arrested at an aunt's home in that city 
seven weeks after McIntosh's killing, he was wearing the chain and 
pendant. Schreiber said that ``his arrogance of wearing that trophy 
around his neck'' made Page ``not deserving of mercy.'' But a defense 
lawyer, Gary Villanueva, dismissed it as evidence only of a mundane 
misdemeanor. Wearing the slain man's jewelry when he was arrested, 
Villanueva said, means only that ``he's in possession of stolen property.'' 
Lurking below the surface of the trial are the prosecution's contentions 
that some of its witnesses have been threatened or intimidated. ``Since 
this trial began, we have had a number of reported threats to witnesses,'' 
Schreiber told Justice Priscilla Hall at one point, with the jury 
not in the courtroom. Later, another defense lawyer, Steven Chaikin, 
told a reporter that it was ``absolutely, positively'' not true that 
Page's relatives and friends had threatened witnesses, ``as best as 
I know without being there.'' The jury has not been told about the 
purported threats, just as it has not been told about other matters 
Ms. Hall has deemed irrelevant or improperly prejudicial, such as 
the prior criminal records of the accused man and his victim. But 
the subject of purported threats and intimidation did surface before 
the jury at one point _ at least in the defense's view. A prosecution 
witness, Gene McKinley, 19, was testifying that, without knowing about 
McIntosh's killing, he had tried to carry out Page's request to dispose 
of the gun that the prosecution said Page had used. McKinley said 
he had been arrested and charged with illegal gun possession but prosecutors 
had agreed to drop the charge in exchange for his testimony. He denied 
Chaikin's suggestion that to get off the hook he would say what the 
prosecution wanted, insisting that the only conditions of his deal 
were that ``I tell the truth'' and ``I'll also be moved out of state.'' 
That brought a defense demand for a mistrial. The relocation remark 
unfairly prejudiced Page because it implied ``he is a bad guy and 
has connections with bad people,'' Villanueva argued. ``Denied,'' 
Ms. Hall said.
