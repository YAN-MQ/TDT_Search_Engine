The Atlanta Braves weren't quite hanging by their fingernails from 
the edge of a cliff. It wasn't exactly what you'd call being tied 
to a track with a train snorting down on you. Or swimming toward shore 
just ahead of a mouthful of sharp teeth attached to a gluttonous shark. 
But close. For the Braves _ predicted by many to ease into the World 
Series _ had traveled to San Diego, decidedly enemy territory, after 
shockingly losing the first two games of the National League Championship 
Series at home. A loss to the Padres yesterday afternoon would mean 
virtual curtains. As the Braves prepared to play the San Diego Padres 
here at Qualcomm Stadium, they were aware that no National League 
team had come back from a two-games-to-none deficit after dropping 
the first two games at home in the 28 previous league championship 
series. And thus they called on their ace, Greg Maddux, the way Pauline 
called for her hero to intercede in her perils, or the surrounded 
pioneers cupped their ears in hopes of hearing the cavalry's bugle. 
``He's being called on,'' said the Padres' Tony Gwynn, in, yes, another 
metaphor, ``to right the ship.'' So the pressure is on. Correct? Maddux, 
looking typically like a professor of anthropology in his spectacles, 
said, ``It's better than Christmas.'' He meant that the challenge 
was a treat, that it wasn't just another day at the ball yard. ``No 
way,'' he said. ``Not even close. The playoffs never get old, never.'' 
Nor can Maddux, the four-time Cy Young award winner and the major-league 
ERA leader this season at 2.22, believe that whipping San Diego will 
be a simple chore for him, especially since one of the Padres, the 
estimable Gwynn, an eight-time National League batting champion, has 
clubbed him to the tune of a career average over .400. ``He handles 
the bat as well as anybody probably ever has,'' Maddux said. ``You 
feel like he's going to put the ball in play. And so you know he's 
going to get his hits.'' This is the fourth straight postseason in 
which Maddux has pitched, and the fifth over all. In the first round 
this year, against the Cubs, he won going seven solid innings. Before 
they beat the Houston Astros in the division series, the Padres had 
not won a playoff game in 14 years. ``I think it's a much bigger advantage 
in the first round of the playoffs,'' Maddux said of postseason experience, 
``because one of the hardest things to control early is nerves.'' 
Obviously the Padres have done a good job of keeping themselves together 
in the the second round, too. Maddux's tricky pitches can make big 
men with 5 o'clock shadows and menacing bats grow limp. He doesn't 
stun the observer with eye-popping physical gifts, but he has become 
a master of his craft. Others throw harder on the mound, but few, 
if any, think clearer there. And don't try to outthink him. ``Even 
if you guess right on a pitch,'' said the Padres center fielder Steve 
Finley, who is hitting in the neighborhood of .200 in his career off 
Maddux, ``the odds are that it probably won't be in the strike zone. 
He'll want you to go fishing for it. When you're facing Greg Maddux, 
if you think and try to hit at the same time you're in trouble.'' 
But if Maddux is so good, what was he doing pitching in Game 3 of 
the series yesterday? Why not in Game 1? Well, he was demoted, as 
it were. He had such a rough September that his ERA rose from around 
1.50 to 2.22. Which is hardly horrendous. But John Smoltz and Tom 
Glavine, who also have Cy Young trophies above their fireplaces, were 
pitching better. So Braves Manager Bobby Cox, playing a kind of shell 
game with three of the best hurlers in baseball, moved Maddux to third. 
``That really wasn't him at the end of the regular season,'' said 
Merv Rettenmund, the Padres' batting coach. ``He was getting his pitches 
up in the strike zone. I don't anticipate seeing that in the playoffs. 
Don't expect to see any balls over the heart of the plate.'' Could 
Gwynn give helpful advice to his batting brothers on how to hit Maddux? 
``No,'' Rettenmund said. ``Tony sees the ball like no one I've ever 
seen play. He picks up the ball so well that he can tell by the way 
the pitcher is about to release the ball what kind of pitch it's going 
to be. He can tell by their fingers in the air. Tony can't tell other 
people how to do it. You just gotta know yourself.'' And what did 
Gwynn have to say about Maddux? ``There's no secret potion,'' he said. 
``Every time it's a battle, fighting and scrapping. I've gotten my 
hits off him, but they've been mostly singles. He has such great control 
that he puts the ball where he wants to _ mostly just off the strike 
zone. And the movement on the ball is as good as anyone I've ever 
faced. His breaking ball will run in on you, it'll run away from you. 
The fastball's got a tail. If you get too aggressive with him, you 
get yourself out. ``It's hard work with Maddux. Ain't no free vittles 
out there.''
