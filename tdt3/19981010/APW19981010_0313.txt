BRUSSELS, Belgium (AP) _ NATO Secretary General Javier Solana said 
Saturday that Serb forces were not meeting international demands for 
a withdrawal from Kosovo, and warned the alliance was close to giving 
the order to launch air strikes. ``There is still no compliance on 
the ground,'' Solana told reporters after meeting ambassadors from 
the 16 NATO allies. ``If (Yugoslav President Slobodan) Milosevic does 
not comply, I can tell you that NATO is ready to act ... time is running 
out.'' NATO officials said ``a large percentage'' of the Serbian special 
police units in Kosovo had not returned to barracks and appeared to 
be digging in for the winter. Solana said the NATO ambassadors ``cleared 
all the decisions that need to be taken'' prior to an ``activation 
order'' that would authorize NATO's military commander to launch air 
raids against Serbia. NATO officials said those decisions included 
agreements on rules of engagement, targeting, liaison with humanitarian 
organizations working in Kosovo and the safety of NATO troops in Bosnia. 
Final approval of the air strike order is being held up by constitutional 
procedures in some NATO allies_ notably Germany, where the cabinet 
is to discuss the issue Monday, and Italy, following the collapse 
of the government Friday. Despite those delays, NATO officials said 
the activation order would come in the coming days if the mission 
to Serbia by U.S. envoy Richard Holbrooke fails to produce a diplomatic 
solution. The activation order would authorize Gen. Wesley K. Clark, 
the supreme allied commander in Europe, to launch the air strikes. 
NATO officials said a few days grace would remain after the order 
is given to allow Milosevic a last chance to back down before air 
raids start. Solana said he was in close touch with Holbrooke and 
that NATO's continued preparations for strikes were helping his negotiating 
efforts. ``What we have done today is a very important boost for Dick 
Holbrooke,'' Solana said. A NATO official, speaking on condition of 
anonymity, said there was ``an emerging consensus'' among the allies 
on a legal basis for an alliance military strike without the need 
for a further U.N. resolution. The United States and Britain have 
argued the existing U.N. call for an end to hostilities is all NATO 
needs to act, while other allies have argued that a more explicit 
authorization is needed. Taking the question back to the U.N. Security 
Council would allow Russia to veto the air strike plan.
