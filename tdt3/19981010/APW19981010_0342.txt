The city of Milan will host the Dec. 4-6 Davis Cup final between Italy 
and Sweden, the Italian Tennis Federation announced Saturday. Milan 
outbid Rome, Turin, Ancona and Pesaro. The matches will be played 
indoors on a slow clay surface expected to benefit the hosts. The 
Italian team, which upset the United States in the semifinals, will 
be in its first Davis Cup final since 1980. It won the title in 1976. 
Defending champion Sweden, headed to its 12th final, will be shooting 
for its seventh Davis Cup trophy.
