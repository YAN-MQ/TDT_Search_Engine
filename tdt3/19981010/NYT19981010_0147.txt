It is still strange to see Dwight Gooden's name embroidered on a uniform 
not sewn in New York. Every stitch in time seems to link Gooden to 
the city that celebrated his golden youth as a Met, forgave his frailties 
as a man and embraced his rebirth as a Yankee. He is not the stunning 
20-year-old Cy Young award winner anymore, nor the man whose personal 
weaknesses crashed his spectacular world, nor the comeback pitcher 
who threw his first career no-hitter at Yankee Stadium on May 14, 
1996. Instead, here stands a resilient 33-year-old in Cleveland clothing, 
still pitching even though his fastball has lost some spice and his 
leg kick has lost some height. ``I'm too old now to get my leg up 
that high,'' Gooden said with a smile on Friday. He is not too old 
to reward the Indians for giving him a chance when the hourglass finally 
ran out in New York. Gooden was scheduled to be on the mound Sunday 
night to start Game 4 of the American League Championship Series, 
attempting to do the one thing he never accomplished in New York: 
win a postseason game. ``It would be big,'' Gooden said. ``A lot of 
things happened in my career that I really didn't expect with awards, 
even the World Series. But that's the only thing missing. That's the 
one thing I would like to have, too, even if it's just one.'' He came 
so close to attaining that one playoff victory last year. He was a 
Yankee then, and the Indians were the enemy in the division series. 
As Gooden took a seat on the Yankee bench, he watched Mariano Rivera 
dig into his place on the mound with a one-run lead in the eighth 
inning. That's when Sandy Alomar unleashed an unthinkable home run 
that tied the score, and began the end for the Yankees in the series. 
``Last year, any time Mariano came in the game, you figured it was 
over,'' said Gooden, who is 0-3 for his career in the postseason. 
``I got spoiled watching him in '96. Like last year, he was just guaranteed. 
Once that game was over, it was tough to swallow because we lost.'' 
There would be no more Yankee moments for Doc. The Yankees did not 
pick up the option on his contract, which he discussed with the principal 
owner, George Steinbrenner, before he left. ``There was an opportunity 
for me to come back,'' Gooden said without elaborating. ``But I just 
thought as a player, it was time for me to move on. I still felt I 
had a lot to give to that ball club, but Joe Torre thought differently. 
You have to respect that, though, because it's his team. The only 
thing that was tough for me was that I was leaving a city where I 
had been my whole career.'' No one was sure if Gooden would click 
in Cleveland. In the beginning, some speculated that General Manager 
John Hart, who had known Gooden since he was in high school, was wrong 
to have extended a lifeline to the pitcher. Maybe Hart's sentiment 
had overstepped reality. At first, Gooden looked as if his body was 
irreparably worn down as tendinitis gripped his right shoulder during 
spring training and in the first seven weeks of the season. But slowly, 
he sprung to life in the second half of the season. He finished with 
an 8-6 record, with victories in his last five decisions. No one was 
better down the stretch for the Indians. The youthful Jaret Wright 
and Bartolo Colon were like windup toys on their last tick, while 
Gooden felt rejuvenated, winning with cleverness over power. He owned 
the plate like a piece of real estate, boasting location, location, 
location. ``I don't remember us ever hitting Doc well in New York,'' 
Cleveland Manager Mike Hargrove said. ``Doc has pitched the second 
half of the season a lot like we saw him pitch against us.'' But Gooden's 
string of smart performances ran out when he did not keep his wits 
about him in Game 2 of the Indians' division series against Boston 
on Sept. 30. His puzzlement with Umpire Joe Brinkman's strike zone 
turned to anger. And 22 pitches into the game, Gooden's tirade caused 
him to be thrown out. Although his ejection seemed to stir the Indians' 
emotions and ignite a victory, Gooden was not especially proud of 
his last outing. ``What happened was unfortunate, and hopefully it 
won't happen again,'' Gooden said. ``To me, that's over. Hopefully, 
this time I'll be out there a little longer.'' It will be odd to see 
him Sunday night and know that he is still very much a part of New 
York, forever interwoven during the good and bad times. And yet, Gooden, 
in a sense, will be out to defeat his past and finally come up with 
an elusive postseason victory against, of all teams, one from New 
York. ``This is what it's all about, playing in October,'' Gooden 
said. ``No doubt it will be special to play against the Yankees. I 
mean, I spent my whole career in New York. But once you take the mound, 
they're just another ball club. You might not believe that, but it's 
true.''
