This is Orelon Sidney with your "Headline News weather update." The 
weather should be mostly quiet for the weekend with high pressure 
across most of the west and the Mississippi and Tennessee river valleys. 
In the northeast, however, a cold front system will be moving offshore. 
Showers are possible across New England with continuing rain and a 
few thunderstorms in Florida. A low pressure system moving across 
the northern plains by Sunday will bring a chance of rain and snow 
over Montana and the dakotas as a new pacific storm system moves into 
the northwest coast. Temperatures will be in the 40s and 50s under 
a trough in the west with a Ridge in the east keeping temperatures 
in the 60s and 70s for the most part with 80s across the southwestern 
deserts and into Texas. On the extended forecast, a chance of thunderstorms 
is back in the picture for the Great Lakes Monday as that low pressure 
storm moves from east to west. By Tuesday, a lot of the punch is gone 
from this system. But showers and a few thunderstorms remain as heavy 
rain gets going across the pacific northwest coast.
