A 90th minute goal by Dorinel Munteanu gave Romania, playing with 
10 men for the final 20 minutes, a 1-0 victory over home team Portugal 
in their European Championship qualifier Saturday. The result lifted 
Romania onto six points, against three for Portugal, in group 7. Bogdan 
Stelea saved a 22nd-minute Portuguese penalty, and Munteanu scored 
from a free-kick in the dying seconds when Romania was under fierce 
Portuguese pressure. The powerful Romanian team, with its steely defending 
and slick passing in attack, kept a tight grip on midfield even after 
Laurentiu Rosu was shown his second yellow card and sent off after 
70 minutes. Catalin Munteanu several times pierced the Portuguese 
defense in the first half, while Gheorghe Popescu came close with 
a thundering free-kick from the edge of the area on the half-hour. 
Portugal looked to its star players to break the stranglehold, but 
Luis Figo of Barcelona and Rui Costa of Italy's Fiorentina were constricted 
by the visitor's tight marking. The home team's best first-half chance 
came after Joao Pinto was fouled in the area and Paulinho Santos stepped 
up to take the penalty kick, but Stelea easily blocked Santos's weak 
shot. Portugal upped the pace after the interval. Figo and Ricardo 
Sa Pinto repeatedly found space around the Romanian goal area as the 
visitor's defense looked likely to unravel. When Rosu was sent off, 
Portugal cranked up the pressure. Joao Pinto put the ball in the Romanian 
net after 75 minutes but the goal was disallowed for offside. Figo 
fired a dipping volley narrowly wide and Jorge Costa's short-range 
header forced a reflex save from goalie Stelea as time ran out for 
the Portuguese. ___ Lineups: Portugal: Vitor Baia; Abel Xavier (Dani
