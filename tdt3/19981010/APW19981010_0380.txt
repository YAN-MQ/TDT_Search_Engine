Capacity crowds at the Paris Auto Show forced organizers to close 
the gates at least twice Saturday as the total number of visitors 
neared the million mark, officials said. Authorities began turning 
people away Saturday morning, reopened, then closed again in the afternoon. 
They urged the overflow crowd to return Sunday, the final day of the 
12-day show. Marking 100 years since the first one in Paris, the biennial 
show had drawn more than 900,000 people since it opened to the public 
Oct. 1 at the sprawling Porte de Versailles convention center. Along 
with the latest models, concept cars and high-tech gadgetry, the show 
also included a historical retrospective of sports cars.
