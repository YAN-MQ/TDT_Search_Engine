We'll have highlights from the baseball playoffs and more, next in 
"Headline Sports." And still ahead -- viewers rate the system used 
to rate TV programs. You have to dig deep to find the source of intrepid's 
solid feel. Reinforced door openings, strategically placed steel beams, 
and an isolated suspension cradle all contribute to intrepid's supple 
ride. Take away that sturdy foundation, and you have... well... nothing. 
Dodge intrepid. We're changing everything. Again.
