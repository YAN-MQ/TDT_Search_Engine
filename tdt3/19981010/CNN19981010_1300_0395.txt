NAto is making final preparations for the use of military force in 
Kosovo, although Russia is threatening to veto any U.N. resolution 
authorizing attacks. U.S. special envoy Richard Holbrooke reports 
no change in the position of Yugoslav leaders. He says his shuttle 
diplomacy between Serbian leaders in Belgrade and the ethnic Albanian 
leaders in Kosovo will continue. NAto's secretary-general says Serbian 
leaders are not complying with U.N. resolutions demanding an end to 
hostilities in Kosovo. He says the military alliance is close to giving 
the order to launch air strikes. He adds, NAto ambassadors have cleared 
all the political hurdles necessary to use force. If a strike order 
is given, U.S. planes from the aircraft carrier, "Eisenhower," and 
land-based military aircraft could begin soon after that.
