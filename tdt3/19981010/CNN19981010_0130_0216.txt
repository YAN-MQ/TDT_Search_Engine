After meeting with Yugoslav President Slobodan Milosevic for more 
than six hours Friday U.S. envoy Richard Holbrooke is heading to Kosovo. 
Holbrooke made one last attempt to persuade Milosevic to to pull back 
from the province, where Serbian forces have been attacking ethnic 
Albanians and avoid a NATO military attack. The state department described 
the talks as intense and tough. Possible NATO military strikes were 
on President Clinton's mind Friday as he met with Germany's chancellor-elect 
Gerhard Schroeder. The first issue is whether Germany will support 
NAto issuing the action order to make sure that the plans are in place 
and authorized if military action should be needed. That is what we 
have said yes to today. We all hope this will not happen. The president 
of Russia sent three high-ranking officials of his government to Mr. 
Milosevic. And he made a lot of specific commitments to honor the 
U.N. resolution. Those commitments are not being kept, today. If he 
can still keep the commitments that he made to President Yeltsin and 
keep the commitments inherent in the U.N. resolution, then none of 
this will happen. But I am convinced that it's important that we authorize 
NAto to act. The state department says the situation on the ground 
in Kosovo appeared quiet Friday but there's no sign Yugoslav troops 
have met the demand to pull back.
