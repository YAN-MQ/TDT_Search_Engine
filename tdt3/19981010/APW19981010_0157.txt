The father of a teacher accused of taking money from students in exchange 
for allowing them to skip assignments said he will commit suicide 
if his son is guilty, The Nation newspaper reported on Saturday. The 
instructor at the Rajabhat Institute, Thailand's main teachers college, 
has admitted to accepting money from students to allow them to skip 
class work and still get good grades. But he said he used the money 
to buy instructional materials and a video cassette player for the 
classroom. Since the case came to light, other students at the school 
have come forward to complain of shady practices by some teachers, 
including selling students xeroxed copies of textbooks at prices higher 
than the originals. Local papers have reported in the past on cases 
of wealthier students simply buying degrees from some local universities. 
The scandal has underscored questions about Thailand's education system, 
which has been criticized for concentrating on rote learning and not 
turning out a work force capable of attracting investment for high 
technology industries.
