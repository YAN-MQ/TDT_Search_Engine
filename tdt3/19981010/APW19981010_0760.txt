David Duval responded to a back-nine challenge by making birdies on 
Nos. 15 and 16 Saturday and took a one-shot lead into the final round 
of the Michelob Championship. Duval lost his lead for one hole to 
playing partner Phil Tataurangi of New Zealand, but there was a two-shot 
swing when he birdied the par-5 15th and Tataurangi made a bogey. 
Duval then made a 3 1-2-meter (12-foot) birdie putt on No. 16. He 
finished three rounds over the 6,853-yard (6,168-meter) River Course 
at Kingsmill with a 13-under 200 total. The American won this event 
last year with a 13-under total, beating Duffy Waldorf and Grant Waite 
in a playoff for his first victory. ``It certainly tried my patience,'' 
Duval said of his 3-under-par 68, which included two bogeys. ``I wasn't 
holing a whole lot of putts. ... But I looked at it like I was bound 
to make a putt at some point.'' American Gary Hallberg, who pulled 
into a tie for the lead at 11 under after 10 holes only to make consecutive 
bogeys, regained three strokes over the last five holes, capping his 
round with an 11-meter (36-foot) birdie putt on No. 18. ``That was 
just, `Lag it up there,' and it went in,'' Hallberg said. ``It's my 
longest putt of the week. My longest in a long time, actually.'' Seeking 
his first victory since 1992 and first top-10 finish since 1994, Hallberg 
finished three rounds one shot behind Duval, with Tataurangi another 
shot off the pace and American Frank Lickliter fourth, three shots 
back. Hallberg had a 66 Saturday, Tataurangi a 69 and Lickliter a 
70. Duval, Tataurangi and Hallberg shared the lead on two occasions, 
both times at 11 under. Hallberg dropped out the first time with bogeys 
at Nos. 11 and 12, and Duval dropped back when Tataurangi made a 3-meter 
(10-foot) putt on No. 14. But the 26-year-old New Zealander didn't 
last long in the top spot, hitting his second shot into the nasty 
rough on the 15th, hitting a lousy chip and three-putting. Duval two-putted 
for birdie from 12 meters (40 feet). Duval's birdie on No. 16 gave 
him a two-shot lead, but only briefly as Hallberg started his 11-meter 
(36-foot) putt just a few seconds later. Hallberg, a three-time winner 
on the U.S. tour in his career, said he almost gave up the game a 
few years back, but decided instead to tear his game down and rebuild 
it piece by piece, just like many young players are doing. ``I just 
started doing that a year ago at age 39,'' he said, ``and I'm pretty 
excited with the results. ... It feels good to not suffer out there.'' 
American Payne Stewart, five strokes off the lead at the start of 
his round, and Australian Bradley Hughes were four back. Stewart shot 
his second straight 67, trimming seven strokes from par after a bogey-bogey 
start, and Hughes shot a 69.
