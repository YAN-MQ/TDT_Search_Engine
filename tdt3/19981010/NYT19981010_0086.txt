The Federal Aviation Administration has spent more than $122 million 
on machines to detect bombs in checked baggage, but those machines 
that have been installed sit idle for most of the day, according to 
investigators from the Department of Transportation. The machines, 
which cost $1.3 million each to buy and install, are supposed to be 
capable of handling 225 bags an hour, but of 13 that were audited 
by investigators, nine handled fewer than 200 bags a day, according 
to a report released on Friday. Some got so little use that the operators 
could not maintain proficiency in running them, investigators said. 
``At some airports, they're sitting relatively unused,'' Lawrence 
Weintrob, an assistant inspector general of the Transportation Department, 
said in a telephone interview. ``Some airports that are using them 
are using them rarely, or process relatively few bags through them.'' 
But Cathal Flynn, assistant administrator of the FAA for civil aviation 
security, said the average number of bags processed through each machine 
was rising sharply as airlines gained experience. Flynn and airline 
representatives said that part of the problem was that the computerized 
system for choosing which passengers' bags get scanned was still developing, 
and would not be fully implemented until the end of the year. ``We 
haven't ironed out all the kinks in the process,'' said Susan Rork, 
managing director of security at the Air Transport Association, the 
trade group of the major airlines. The computerized system singles 
out individuals about whom there is too little information to conclude 
that they are not a threat, officials say. It also draws a sample 
from the group judged not to be a threat, to increase the chance that 
a terrorist would be caught, and to make the system fairer, Flynn 
said. One problem, he said, is that if the system were changed to 
require that a larger number of passengers have their bags scrutinized, 
then at peak periods people would be delayed so long they would miss 
their flights. ``If you get people fuming at a line, that's not good 
either,'' Flynn said. That, he said, would probably discourage machine 
operators from doing their jobs right. And delays, he said, would 
damage public acceptance of security measures. In written comments 
responding to the report, the FAA said that the agency would ``pursue 
a more coherent strategy with air carriers to ramp-up to a higher 
level of use.'' However, the agency said, it would be ``many years'' 
before technology allowed screening of all bags. Auditors also said 
that the machines in use could handle only about half as many bags 
as they did in lab tests, partly because they sound false alarms far 
more when in use at airports. Each false alarm requires time to resolve. 
(All alarms so far have been false, officials said, because no bombs 
have been detected.) The machines' higher false alarm rate is ``probably 
a reason why they don't use it as often as they should,'' Weintrob 
said. Fifty-nine of the machines have been installed so far; plans 
are to have 74 in place by the end of the year, he said. Officials 
of airports where the machines are installed declined to comment and 
asked not to be identified. Under FAA rules, airport operators are 
responsible for various aspects of security, but not for screening 
bags. That responsibility falls to the airlines.
