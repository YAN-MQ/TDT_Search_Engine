Hiking below the spectacular Pikes Peak Highway, Gail Snyder points 
out the behind-the-scenes damage to the mountain. For decades, rain 
water has drained unchecked off the gravel road leading to the 14,110-foot 
summit, carving gullies deep enough to swallow ponderosa pines whole. 
``The forest floor is buried under 2 to 4 feet of gravel,'' said Ms. 
Snyder, a Sierra Club spokeswoman. ``Alpine ponds are filled with 
gravel, wetlands are filled with gravel.'' Calculating that the city 
of Colorado Springs, the highway caretaker, has dumped 1.5 million 
tons of gravel on it over the last two decades to maintain it, the 
Sierra Club is suing the city, charging it with violating the Clean 
Water Act. Because the mountain is in a national forest, the U.S. 
Forest Service has also been named in the suit. Ms. Snyder and many 
environmentalists want the road paved to help control erosion. But 
asphalt would be a sacrilege to auto racing fans and drivers who gather 
here every Fourth of July for a noisy, dusty day of events billed 
as the Race to the Clouds. Climbing 12{ miles, twisting around 156 
turns and switchbacks, the race course has challenged drivers and 
mechanics since the first checkered flag dropped in 1916. ``Gravel 
always has helped level the playing field,'' said Rod Millen, a New 
Zealand driver who holds the speed record for burning up the mountain 
in 10 minutes and 4 seconds. ``In most races now, there is a greater 
emphasis on the machine. When you have to race on a loose surface 
road, the emphasis shifts from the machine to the driver's skill. 
It would be great to keep that.'' City officials say they intend to 
pave the road and make needed repairs related to it. But the work 
could drag on for more than a decade, they said, because the city 
has classified the highway as a government enterprise that cannot 
receive local tax money. It can receive federal grants, and Colorado 
members of Congress are pushing for them. It is not only race cars 
that travel to the summit. The mountain is the nation's most heavily 
visited high peak. Last year, Pikes Peak drew more than half a million 
visitors: 60,000 on foot, 200,000 on a cog railroad and 300,000 on 
the highway. The highway starts at an altitude of 7,400 feet, about 
1,100 feet higher than the summit of Mount Washington in New Hampshire, 
the highest mountain in New England. In climatic terms, the hourlong, 
19-mile drive from the start of the road to the peak's summit is the 
equivalent of driving 4,000 miles due north. Cars climb from golden 
aspen groves and mule deer meadows to rocky tundra. Some tourists 
find the ascent, on gravel without guardrails, so unnerving that Forest 
Service employees have to drive their cars down the mountain. But 
overall, tourist enthusiasm remains strong. Last May 1, Colorado Springs 
increased the highway toll by two-thirds, to $10 for each adult. Despite 
the increase, the number of summer visitors grew by 4,000 over the 
summer of 1997. ``Pikes Peak, the mountain, is really the tourist 
anchor for the entire region,'' said Kitty Clemens, director of the 
regional tourism board, Pikes Peak Country Attractions Association. 
About 80 percent of the visitors to the mountain highway are from 
out of state. But to keep the tourism dollars and cars rolling, environmentalists 
say, the highway's managers have left Pikes Peak awash in gravel. 
``There are live ponderosas falling into gullies,'' Ms. Snyder said. 
``There are beaver ponds filling with gravel, there are trees with 
6- to 7-feet of gravel around their base.'' Noting that the city had 
cut its annual spread of road gravel from 50,000 tons in the early 
1990's to about 20,000 this year, Ms. Snyder said, ``It's like going 
from 500 cigarettes a day to 200 cigarettes a day.'' While the highway 
may have been state of the art when it opened in 1915, she said, it 
needs to undergo a $15 million repair to sharply diminish erosion 
from runoff. Instead of using old-fashioned ``shotgun culverts'' to 
pipe water off mountainsides, Ms. Snyder said, the city should install 
modern culverts, designed to brake and dissipate water draining off 
the road. Ponds should be built to trap sediments, she said. The Sierra 
Club said in its suit filed in U.S. District Court that if the city 
did not adopt a binding timetable to implement an acceptable remediation 
plan, the court should order the Forest Service to suspend the city's 
operating license for the highway. ``There have been reports coming 
out since the 1950s saying, `You have got a gravel problem,''' said 
Michael Freeman, the lawyer for Earthjustice Legal Defense Fund Inc., 
which filed the suit for the Sierra Club. ``The city ignored the problem 
for decades. They ignored the Sierra Club for decades, until we sued 
them. They could make this lawsuit go away tomorrow if they would 
make a binding commitment.'' Race officials favor erosion controls, 
and warn that paving would lull tourists into driving dangerously 
fast. Noting that the race is the second oldest car race in the nation, 
after the Indianapolis 500, Buster Cogswell, chairman of the Pikes 
Peak International Hill Climb, said: ``There is a rich tradition and 
history. It has been on gravel since 1916.'' Ms. Snyder retorts, ``Pikes 
Peak is not a theme park, nor a race track.'' With the toll increase, 
the annual gross revenue from tolls and concession sales should hit 
$2.5 million, said Hans D. Schalk, the city's manager of the highway. 
``This is a national monument that has been neglected,'' Schalk said. 
``Congress could come to the table with $5 million.'' He said he planned 
to ask the City Council for authorization to double within two years 
the paved section of the highway, to 14 miles. Then, offering music 
to environmentalists' ears, Schalk asserted, ``The future of this 
highway is a paved highway.''
