A report shows that overloading wasn't enough to cause the sinking 
of a pleasure boat that killed 20 French retirees in northeastern 
Spain's Lake Banyoles. The technical evaluation, drawn up by a naval 
engineer at the request of local authorities, uncovered that the owner 
of the boat had changed the engine before the accident and had also 
modified the ventilation ducts ``using very unprofessional methods,'' 
the city major Joan Solana said Friday evening in a press conference. 
The report will be handed to the investigative judge. The changes 
may have been made to increase the boat's speed and make it suitable 
to transport more passengers. Designed for 80 passengers, the electric-powered 
catamaran was carrying 141 Thursday when its stern began to sink just 
after it was pulling away the port. Two owners of the boat, including 
the pilot, were released Friday after giving secret testimony before 
the judge, who released them without filing charges. The court said 
the investigation will continue next week. Four of the 40 injured 
in the accident remained in a hospital in Gerona while the rest of 
the French tourists were returning Saturday to France on specially 
chartered flights. Repatriation of the corpses was due to begin Sunday.
