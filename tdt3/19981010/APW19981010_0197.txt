Indonesia's state-owned oil and gas company announced that it will 
scrap 159 deals it made with relatives and cronies of former President 
Suharto, saying they amount to corruption, a newspaper reported Saturday. 
The deals with Pertamina company involved oil exploration, fuel and 
crude oil imports, gas purchases, and gasoline chemicals and catalysts 
for its refineries, The Jakarta Post said. The company has terminated 
some deals and is seeking to renegotiate others to stamp out corruption 
and nepotism that tarnished its image for 32 years under Suharto, 
the report said. The affected parties include PT Permindo Oil Trading, 
owned by Bimantara, a business group founded by Suharto's second eldest 
son, Bambang Trihatmodjo, and PT Perta Oil Marketing, which has links 
with Suharto's youngest son, Hutomo Mandala Putra. By canceling such 
deals, Pertamina expects to save U.S. dlrs 64.7 million and an additional 
313 billion rupiah (dlrs 35 million) in expenses. ``Pertamina is continuing 
to investigate other projects and contracts. So the final figure could 
be higher,'' the company's exploration director, Priyambodo Mulyosudirdjo, 
said Friday. Pertamina moves are the latest in a campaign by President 
B.J. Habibie to cut ties with companies owned by relatives of Suharto. 
Suharto resigned May 21 after widespread rioting, much of it led by 
protesters demanding an end to corruption and nepotism. Critics say 
the family abused its power and amassed a fortune that some have estimated 
at dlrs 40 billion through a web of monopolies, cartels, government 
concessions and sweetheart deals.
