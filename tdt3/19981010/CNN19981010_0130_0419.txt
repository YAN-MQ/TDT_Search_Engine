36 years after he first went into space, John Glenn is getting ready 
to go into orbit again. The 77-year-old senator from Ohio and his 
six crew mates aboard shuttle discovery conducted a full dress rehearsal 
Friday ending with an emergency evacuation of the spacecraft. Glenn 
will serve as a geriatric test subject on the nine-day mission. Back 
then, I was scared to death I might get a cold or something like that 
and might be replaced. I feel the same way right now. We're ready 
to go just three weeks from today. And three weeks from today and 
about an hour from now that thing will light off back there. And I'm 
really looking forward to this, as you can imagine. Discovery is scheduled 
to launch October 29th.
