A newly declassified CIA study shows the agency did not fully inform 
Congress of reports that link nicaraguan contras to drug trafficking 
in the 1980s. A 410-page version of the report has been posted on 
the CIA's web site. It says the CIA knew of drug allegations against 
at least 58 people belonging to various contra groups. The CIA had 
a policy of assisting the contras in their fight against Nicaragua's 
communist government.
