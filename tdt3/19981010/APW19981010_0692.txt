Serbian authorities moved to shut down a popular independent radio 
station late Saturday, a station executive said _ a day after the 
government put into effect a decree tightening state control over 
media. Two inspectors from the telecommunications ministry, accompanied 
by police, entered Radio Index offices and demanded the station cease 
broadcasting because it doesn't have a legal license, said deputy 
chief editor Aleksandar Vasic. They said they were confiscating the 
station's equipment. Vasic alerted other media but said employees 
would not resist. Earlier in the day, the radio had changed frequencies 
and claimed its signal was being jammed by a transmitter belonging 
to the state-owned Serbian radio-television company. On Thursday, 
Radio Index was suddenly evicted from premises it had rented for years 
from state-run radio, but found another location the same day. The 
radio's chief editor, Nenad Cekic, had said the action was apparent 
retaliation to his protests against the government crackdown on independent 
media. In instituting the crackdown, authorities branded foreign programs 
aired on some radio stations as damaging, anti-Serb propaganda, masterminded 
in the West to help Serbia's ethnic Albanians in Kosovo province to 
secede. The Organization for Security and Cooperation in Europe assailed 
the moves as amounting to ``a declaration of war against the independent 
media.'' Radio Index did not relay foreign broadcasts but was critical 
of the government. It has been operating on the same frequency for 
six and a half years and had a contract to that effect. At a government 
auction for licenses in May, it was among many independent stations 
that were refused frequency licenses by the government but continued 
operating without one. Critics of President Slobodan Milosevic's government 
have said he is using NATO threats to use force against Yugoslavia 
because of its Kosovo offensive as a pretext for clamping down on 
opponents.
