Living up to the rough-and-tumble reputation of his countrymen, an 
Australian swimming coach claims he has found the secret to making 
his students swim faster -- a crocodile. Mark Davies says the children 
are given a few seconds head start before he releases the crocodile 
into the pool. Not surprisingly, he says the kids are clocking record 
times. This is good -- it's working. It is something we've got to 
be careful with, but if we get the right time between the swimmers, 
as long as they think the crocodile's there, it's going to make them 
fast and that's the idea. He was a lot quicker than what I actually 
thought, so yeah, we have to check the speed of the croc first. He 
might be faster than the swimmers. I guess that's an incentive. The 
children are actually well out of harm's way before Davies releases 
the crocodiles. Still, he admits his training technique is a little 
risky.
