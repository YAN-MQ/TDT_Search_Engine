Working with only 100 Watts of cooking power, Lindsey Thompson of 
Little Rock, Arkansas, won the national easy-bake oven contest Friday. 
All contestants used the toy oven, which uses a light bulb to bake 
miniature pastries. The fourth grader earned the honor with her toffee 
trifle cake. She received a $5,000 savings bond and a two-year supply 
of easy-bake cake mixes. The contest marked the easy-bake oven's 35th 
anniversary.
