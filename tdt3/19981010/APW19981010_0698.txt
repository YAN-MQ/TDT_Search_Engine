A new album of previously unreleased Bob Marley songs may be causing 
a stir overseas but not in Jamaica, where some fans of the reggae 
legend are crying exploitation. Since its release several months ago, 
``The Complete Bob Marley and the Wailers: 1967-1972'' has earned 
rave reviews during promotional stops in Canada and the United Kingdom, 
but not in the home country of the late reggae star. Sales have been 
slow in Jamaica. ``Bob most likely would not have wanted these songs 
released,'' said a respected Jamaican musicologist who asked not to 
be named. ``It's all about making money.'' But respected Marley historian 
Roger Steffens, who has been a part of the album's promotional tour, 
described the response to the set as ``phenomenally positive.'' The 
album is distrubuted by JAD Records, which is owned by Danny Sims, 
an American producer who worked with rhythm and blues singer Johnny 
Nash and Marley while living in Jamaica during the late 1960s. Marley 
wrote several of Nash's biggest hits including ``Stir It Up'' and 
``Guava Jelly.'' Both songs were produced by Sims, who also produced 
the Marley classic ``Bend Down Low.'' Sims and Marley split in the 
early 1970s, but Sims retained publishing rights to several of the 
dreadlocked singer's best-known songs. In 1996, Sims released ``Soul 
Almighty: The Formative Years,'' which comprised his first set of 
songs with Marley. Writing in Billboard Magazine, Timothy White, author 
of the Marley biography, ``Catch A Fire,'' described it as ``worthless.'' 
Marley died in 1981 from cancer at age 36.
