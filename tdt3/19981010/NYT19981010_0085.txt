After four years and a momentous turn of events, Tempo magazine, once 
Indonesia's best-selling news weekly, is back on the streets. It has 
a new look and a determination to win back the readers stolen away 
by the government of the former president, Suharto. It is out with 
a cover article on the reports of widespread rape of ethnic Chinese 
women during the uprising against Suharto in May. The new Tempo dived 
head first into the volatile territory that earned the magazine its 
reputation as one of the country's few independent sources of information. 
Suharto's successor and the man who now leads the country, President 
B.J. Habibie, was the subject of the cover article of the previous 
issue _ in June 1994. ``Until this day we do not know why we were 
closed, but we heard that it had to do with our story on the warships 
from East Germany,'' said Tempo's chief editor, Goenawan Mohamad. 
Tempo lost its publishing license soon after looking into the government's 
purchase of 39 second-hand Soviet-built warships, which was recommended 
by Habibie, then minister of research and technology. Two other influential 
publications, Editor and DeTik, were also closed that year for reasons 
that were never fully explained. Asked if he thought the four-month-old 
Habibie administration is sincere about liberalizing controls on a 
press that was muzzled and manipulated for more than three decades, 
Goenawan said: ``We don't care if they're committed or not. It's more 
about our commitment to opening the doors to find the truth.'' Tempo 
may face stiff competition in a media landscape that in recent months 
has seen dozens of new magazines and tabloids. But Ashadi Siregar 
of the Institute for Research, Education and Publications, an independent 
media research group, said the image of Tempo as the only magazine 
that was not co-opted by the Suharto regime would boost its credibility 
over the competition as would its commitment to investigative journalism. 
``No other publications have taken the position of Tempo,'' he said. 
``In the end, even the old government lost a reliable source of information 
when Tempo was killed because there was no other magazine that really 
reflected the thinking of the people.'' Today's newsstands in Indonesia 
bear testimony to the striking changes that have occurred since the 
since resignation of Suharto. From a time when editors were told whose 
picture should appear on what pages and reprimanded for ``cynical 
reporting,'' the local media are now tackling issues once deemed too 
sensitive. Papers down to the village level carry headlines not only 
on the business practices of the former first family and human rights 
violations by the military, but also on illicit dealings and charges 
of nepotism in their local administrations.
