An Iranian appeals court Saturday upheld a death sentence for a German 
businessman convicted of having a sexual relationship with a Muslim 
woman, a decision that could worsen relations between Iran and Germany. 
Helmut Hofer, 56, will be executed for having ``illegitimate relations'' 
with 26-year-old Vahideh Qassemi, the court said. Qassemi was sentenced 
to 100 lashes. An appeal to the country's supreme court is expected 
in two days, and legal experts said that court would likely overturn 
the verdict. But the decision still came as a shock to German officials 
and Hofer's lawyers, who had expected him to be released. German Foreign 
Minister Klaus Kinkel said his government will protest to Iran's ambassador 
in Bonn, and continue to fight for Hofer's exoneration. The court 
ruling ``inevitably throws a new shadow on both sides' wish to improve 
relations,'' Kinkel said in a statement, which appealed to Iran to 
``ensure humaneness and justice.'' ``The verdict contradicts all expectations,'' 
he said. Iranian law punishes sex between unmarried Muslims with flogging. 
If the man is a non-Muslim, he faces the death penalty. Hofer was 
sentenced to death in January soon after his arrest for having sex 
with Qassemi, a medical student. The appeals court had earlier assured 
German officials that Hofer would be freed because the court was satisfied 
that he had converted to Islam and would marry the Iranian woman. 
``I'm surprised. I expected that today's verdict would clear Hofer 
of all charges,'' said Hofer's lawyer, Malekhoushang Qahhari.
