A two-year campaign by the Clinton administration to convince major 
oil companies that they should quickly build a multi-billion-dollar 
pipeline in the Caucasus, a campaign that has become a centerpiece 
of American foreign policy, appears to be on the brink of failure. 
Companies from the United States and seven other nations are to make 
a decision later this month about how to begin transporting the vast 
amounts of oil that are believed to lie under and around the Caspian 
Sea. For the region's fragile new nations, wedged between Russia and 
Iran, the decision may be a momentous turning point. The Caspian region 
has emerged as the world's newest stage for big-power politics. It 
not only offers oil companies the prospect of great wealth, but provides 
a stage for high-stakes competition among world powers. This grand 
rivalry has begun with an intense competition for control over pipeline 
routes that will carry Caspian oil to foreign markets. Much depends 
on the outcome, because these pipelines will not simply carry oil 
but will also define new corridors of trade and power. The nation 
or alliance that controls pipeline routes could hold sway over the 
Caspian region for decades to come. The Clinton administration has 
been exerting every form of persuasion at its disposal to persuade 
the oil companies to choose a route that would run from Baku, the 
capital of oil-rich Azerbaijan, through Turkey to its Mediterranean 
port of Ceyhan. But it is evidently losing the battle. Administration 
officials, congressional aides and oil executives said in interviews 
last week that the companies will probably decide that the American-backed 
pipeline is too expensive to build now. The companies are expected 
to announce that they will rely on a much shorter pipeline that is 
already being built from Azerbaijan to the port of Supsa, on Georgia's 
Black Sea coast, or an enlarged pipeline along the same route. From 
Georgia, the oil would be loaded into tankers and shipped across the 
Black Sea toward Europe _ a move that not only would deny potentially 
billions of dollars in revenue to Turkey, a U.S. ally, but would mean 
a sharp increase in oil tanker traffic through the narrow Bosporus 
strait, which Turkey strenuously opposes. The decision is expected 
to be announced on Oct. 29, and a senior executive of the oil consortium, 
Robin Branagan, asserted in a telephone interview from Baku that ``at 
the moment all options are still open.'' Officials in Washington, 
however, expect that the American-backed route will not be chosen. 
They are already debating how serious a setback it is for the administration 
and the security interests of the United States. ``It's a disappointment, 
but I wouldn't call it a defeat,'' said Sen. Sam Brownback, R-Kan. 
``Half a loaf is better than nothing. The oil is going to come out 
on an east-west axis, rather than south through Iran or north through 
Russia. And Baku-Ceyhan may still happen down the road.'' The oil 
companies are expected to couch their announcement in terms that will 
be as reassuring as possible to all parties and to include a pledge 
to build the Baku-Ceyhan pipeline someday. But that is not enough 
to console some in Washington who have worked hard to secure an immediate 
commitment. ``I think it is a defeat, to be honest,'' said a State 
Department official who concentrates on Caspian issues. ``We pushed 
this project to the top of our agenda, but we weren't able to provide 
the sweeteners or whatever was necessary to get it done. We wanted 
to get something for nothing. It's a setback for our commercial interests 
and certainly for our prestige. It's another case of talking big but 
not backing up what we say.'' Brownback said one reason the United 
States was not able to impose its will on the oil companies was that 
President Clinton has ``lost the power of moral persuasion'' because 
of scandals that surround him. But there are more tangible factors 
at play. Among them are the low price of oil, which made the companies 
reluctant to embrace a project that could cost $4 billion or more; 
uncertainty about how much oil the Caspian will produce over the next 
few years, and hope that U.S. sanctions against Iran may soon collapse, 
making a pipeline through Iran possible. The administration favored 
the Baku-Ceyhan route because it would pass through only relatively 
friendly countries _ Azerbaijan, Georgia and Turkey _ and would bind 
them closer to the West; because it would pull Azerbaijan and Georgia 
out of the Russian shadow; and because it would not pass through either 
Russia or Iran, both of which have offered routes of their own. Unfortunately 
for the administration, however, the Baku-Ceyhan route is also the 
longest and most expensive to build of all proposed routes. Last year 
the oil companies discreetly asked the Clinton administration if it 
would be willing to pay part of the cost of building its favored Baku-Ceyhan 
pipeline. They were told that any such payment would be viewed as 
a government handout to the oil industry, and was therefore politically 
impossible. Unable to subsidize the Baku-Ceyhan line themselves, U.S. 
officials urged Turkey, through which most of the line would run, 
to offer the companies a generous package of incentives and tax breaks. 
They said this week that Turkey never produced such a package, and 
complained that the instability of Turkey's government has made it 
a difficult partner. ``Oil companies sometimes don't even know who 
they should be negotiating with over there,'' asserted one oil consultant. 
``We kept telling the Turks that they had to come to the table with 
something to offer, but it didn't work. Now of course they're going 
to be very upset, but in part they brought this on themselves.'' Administration 
officials are working to assure that the text of the companies' announcement 
is as positive to U.S. interests as possible. Several said that given 
economic realities, they could understand a decision by the companies 
to build a pipeline only as far as Georgia. ``It would reflect the 
difficulty of getting a consensus on all the cost issues at a time 
of low oil prices and of anxiety about large capital investments,'' 
said Ambassador-at-Large Stephen Sestanovich, who has helped shape 
U.S. policy toward Caspian countries. ``Given all this, the companies 
naturally want to be cautious.'' ``We're committed to making Baku-Ceyhan 
happen,'' Sestanovich said. ``A couple of years ago people didn't 
take the idea of an east-west corridor seriously at all. Now everyone 
can see it's just a matter of time.'' An oil company executive involved 
in making the pipeline decision said that by building a pipeline to 
Georgia, the companies would be responding to U.S. concerns. ``They 
have received what they want, which is an east-west route, but in 
a phased approach,'' the executive said. ``Most things in life come 
in stages. If you're going to build a huge new house, do you build 
it all now or start small and expand it as you need it? That's how 
we're thinking.'' A pipeline from Baku to Georgia's Black Sea coast 
is already under construction, but it will not have enough capacity 
to handle the heavy volumes of oil that are expected to be shipped 
from the Caspian in coming years. The fact that a right of way already 
exists, however, would make construction of a larger-capacity pipeline 
relatively easy. It is still unclear what the companies will do with 
their oil once it arrives at the Black Sea. The Bosporus is the only 
maritime route out of the Black Sea. It runs through the center of 
Istanbul and is already overcrowded. Turkish officials say it cannot 
sustain a sharp increase in tanker traffic. Foreign Minister Ismail 
Cem of Turkey, in a telephone interview, declined to comment on the 
oil companies' deliberations until they officially announce their 
conclusion. But he said competition for pipeline routes would shape 
events in the Caspian region for decades to come. ``It creates a new 
complex of economic and strategic issues that will shape the next 
century,'' Cem said. ``Certain countries in the region will become 
big players in world affairs, and countries outside the region are 
anxious to press their own interests. The rivalry, the competition 
for influence, has already begun.''
