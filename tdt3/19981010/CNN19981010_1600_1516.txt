People living longer and having fewer children -- it's a phenomenon 
usually reserved for wealthy nations, but Cuba has proven to be an 
exception. Lucia Newman explains. Wherever you go in Havana, you'll 
find old people exercising in the parks. They belong to a government-run 
organization called "the circle of grandparents," and the circle is 
getting bigger. Cuba's population is getting older, faster, than in 
almost any other developing nation. Low fertility and mortality rates 
are the main cause of the rapid increase of the aging process of the 
Cuban population. According to a population study just released by 
the United Nations, the number of people over the age of 65 is expanding 
worldwide. What makes the Cuban case unusual is the explanation for 
this -- a low birth rate, along with a higher life expectancy are 
phenomenon generally associated with rich countries. One reason Cuban 
women are having fewer or no children is the nation's acute economic 
crisis. Obviously, the economic situation in Cuba in the last few 
years has had an affect. But it is not the cause or the origin of 
this phenomenon. Rather it's the sweeping social transformations that 
have affected the development of the family and of women. In communist 
Cuba, 38% of women work. Birth control and abortion are free and readily 
available, as are education and health care. First-world characteristics 
in a third-world country. And as in every developing nation, the elderly 
are extremely vulnerable. This is especially true here where people 
live in what is called "the special period" -- a time of extreme belt 
tightening which began when Cuba lost its main market, the Soviet 
Union. These men and women are able to eat breakfast and lunch thanks 
to donations from abroad, distributed by the Catholic church's charity 
organization. Back at the park, children from the day care center 
across the street are brought over to exercise with the grandparents. 
As the difficulties of feeding and caring for the elderly grow, Cuba's 
younger generation will have to find solutions to the problems of 
living on an aging island. Lucia Newman, CNN, Havana.
