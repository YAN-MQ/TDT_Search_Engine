House members are spending their Saturday indoors. They're on Capitol 
Hill scrambling to put a budget deal together. Lawmakers are itching 
to get home to campaign for the November 3rd elections, but can't 
leave until a deal is finalized. Republican leaders and President 
Clinton have been blaming each other for problems that have prevented 
a deal. A White House official says there are at least 100 points 
of disagreement. Last night, Congress passed a temporary spending 
Bill that allows the government to keep running through the weekend. 
Both parties say it's not likely the government will shutdown this 
fall.
