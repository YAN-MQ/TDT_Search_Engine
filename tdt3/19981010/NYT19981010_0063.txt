If there is a worldwide canard about political correctness, it is 
that it's an American disease. Geopolitically speaking, though, that 
is wildly incorrect. Every country has its own strain. The Japanese 
think it bad taste to talk about burakumin, social outcasts that include 
leather tanners and slaughterhouse workers. It recalls ancient prejudices, 
but there are lands where the repetition of not-so-old cruelties is 
what evokes horror: the mention of ``scientific racism'' in Germany, 
for example, or the similar assumptions behind South Africa's ``grand 
apartheid.'' All these linguistic taboos have something in common: 
they are meant to take the sting out of confrontations by constantly 
ratcheting down the sharpness of the words used. In the United States, 
this is the process by which, over decades, ``village idiot'' ratchets 
down to ``slow,'' which ratchets down to ``retarded,'' then to ``challenged'' 
and then all the way down to ``special.'' In today's global culture, 
some of this kind of thing is happening all over. Sometimes it is 
simply a reflection of fashions emanating from America. In Mexico, 
for instance, where it is still common for the common man to call 
homosexuals ``maricones,'' a deep insult, the politically correct 
will say ``gay'' (though the word is pronounced ``guy'' and means 
nothing in Spanish). Nonetheless, political correctness isn't just 
about America's unspeakable words. It takes taboos to tangle, and 
taboos tend to be local. For instance, Japanese newspapers simply 
avoid mentioning burakumin and even the occupations they practiced, 
like butchering meat. In formal Japanese, no one is blind, bald, fat 
or ugly. And while a tall man in a group is ``the tall one,'' a short 
man is ``the fourth from the left.'' In Latin America, by contrast, 
a short man can be ``petiso'' _ ``shorty'' _ and a dark-skinned man 
``negro,'' and no offense is taken. But make an aside about someone's 
mother and there will be trouble. With informers around for 20 years 
under the juntas, discussing politics in most Latin American countries 
used to be dangerous, especially for anyone who let slip socialist 
catchwords like ``bourgeoisie.'' Now politics can be discussed freely, 
but one must disparage politicians. In France, discussing politics 
has always been the chief instrument of torture used at the dinner 
table. Unrepentant lefties will excuse a wildcat strike as a ``social 
movement,'' while average folks may toe the pan-European line and 
justify government austerity measures. Jean-Marie Le Pen's right-wing 
National Front gets 15 percent of the vote, so SOMEBODY must be discussing 
him, but the newspapers just don't like to. Liberal journalists say 
that ignoring his views will suppress them, but the theory seems thin. 
Meanwhile, if Americans are sick of discussing Bill Clinton's sex 
life, the French are sick at the idea that Americans discuss it at 
all. They assume their presidents fool around _ Francois Mitterrand's 
mistress and their daughter attended his funeral _ and the national 
``don't ask, don't tell'' policy never compels a leader to lie or 
obstruct justice about sex (not that the French expect their presidents 
to be incapable of either). The Germans, by contrast, have many things 
that are illegal to say or do, all related to the Nazi era: one may 
not deny the Holocaust or make the Hitler salute. Except for rebellious 
skinheads and soccer hooligans, jingoism is out, and outspoken anti-foreigner 
sentiment is frowned upon. Still, many privately blame Turks and Africans 
for higher crime rates and encourage tougher immigration laws. Some 
concepts protected by political correctness in the United States don't 
export at all in most places _ women's rights, for example. These 
are rapidly, and sometimes violently, retreating in much of the Muslim 
world. And in Mexico, secretarial ads still ask for ``good-looking 
young women.'' Foreigners can't keep up with American changes, and 
often think them foolish. Probably the most fashion-policed word anywhere 
is that with which Americans refer to their countrymen of African 
ancestry. In 50 years, that defining term has shifted from colored 
to Negro to black to Afro-American to people of color to African-American. 
Foreigners may hoot at that, but they too have yielded to subtle pressure 
to rename their minorities. Polite euphemisms coined by 19th-century 
liberals _ ``natives'' in Africa, ``aboriginals'' in Australia (no 
doubt to avoid words like ``savages'') _ are now themselves out of 
favor. ``Indigenous'' is OK in Australia. It used to be OK in Mexico, 
but ``Indios'' is now preferred. (There is no confusion with people 
from the Indian Subcontinent; Mexicans call all of them ``hindus'' 
_ pronounced ``EEN-doos'' _ even if they're Pakistani Muslims or Christians.) 
An African, by contrast, would never take a cue from the now-fashionable 
American invention ``Native American'' because ``natives'' is an old 
insult. In South Africa, the former ``Bantus'' (an inoffensive word 
elsewhere in Africa) now run the country, and non-whites are sometimes 
called ``the previously disadvantaged.'' There is also nothing basic 
about ``black'' _ in some contexts it refers only to black Africans 
while in others it includes mixed-race people and Indians. When it 
comes to the context of political correctness, in some ways South 
Africa resembles America, with blacks and whites exchanging hostilities 
across an economic divide. In others, it is unique. Its constitution, 
for example, curbs hate speech and forbids discrimination that is 
based not just on race and religion but also on sex, sexual preference, 
handicap, pregnancy status and almost every imaginable ground. Perhaps 
because South Africa spent so much of the apartheid era in isolation, 
America's political correctness and the backlash against it arrived 
simultaneously. Take race. Everyone talks about crime, but for whites 
to dwell on it too long smacks of racism, because most criminals are 
black. Suburban wives complain about their maids, and husbands complain 
about labor productivity, but it's all code for ``the blecks.'' White 
and black liberals strain to ask people of other races to dinner, 
but to get caught practicing tokenism is a faux pas. Given its many 
races, however, South Africa is also remarkably rich in racial insults. 
It has a macho culture where one is expected to roll with a punch 
and sensitive types are mocked. In young, racially mixed groups of 
friends, people lightheartedly use words like ``darkie'' and ``hout-kop'' 
(wood-head) for blacks, ``coolie'' and ``curry-muncher'' for Indians, 
``bushie'' (Bushman) or ``half-naat'' (half-baked) for coloreds and 
``whitey'' or ``mlungu'' for whites. Meanwhile, English-speaking whites 
call uncouth Afrikaner ones ``hairybacks'' or ``rockspiders,'' while 
Afrikaners call the other whites ``rooinek'' _ rednecks, as in sunburned 
British soldiers _ or worse. And then there is Russia, where the most 
discriminated-against groups are residents of the Caucasus _ Chechnyans, 
Azerbaijanis, Georgians and so on. There, unlike elsewhere, Caucasians 
are relatively dark skinned _ and to Russians inclined to be derogatory, 
this makes them ``chorniye'' or ``blacks'' (except when this is seen 
to be insensitive, in which case Caucasians become ``people of Caucasian 
nationality.'') In other words, in Russia it's the Caucasians who 
can be blacks, but a person of African extraction is never black, 
except derogatorily. (A white Russian, of course, is vodka, Kahlua 
and cream.)
