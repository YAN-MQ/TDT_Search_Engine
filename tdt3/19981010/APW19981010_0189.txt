Militants shot dead 17 people in a remote district in India's northeast 
Assam state while a parliamentary committee was touring the area to 
assess the security situation, newspapers reported Saturday. The killers 
were suspected members of the Bodo Liberation Tiger Force and the 
National Democratic Front of Bodoland who oppose the Indian government 
and also other tribal groups living in Assam, the Times of India newspaper 
reported. The Bodos make up nearly 1.2 million of Assam's 22 million 
people. The assailants came armed with automatic weapons and attacked 
three villages in Darrang district late Friday night killing their 
victims in four separate incidents.The area is 1,500 kilometers (900 
miles) east of the Indian capital New Delhi. Two men and a woman were 
killed early on Saturday, PTI said. It was not clear what was the 
motive behind the killings. The victims included members of the majority 
Hindu community and the linguistic minority, the Times of India said. 
Officials in the state capital Gauhati told the visiting parliamentary 
team that there has been no let up in violence in the state. At least 
1,000 people have died in inter-tribal conflicts in the last two years.
