Northern Ireland defended a one-goal lead for an hour Saturday before 
clinching a 1-0 win over Finland in the Group 3 Euro 2000 qualifier. 
Keith Rowland scored his first international goal in the 31st minute 
to claim the only goal of the match. The Queens Park Rangers midfielder 
received a pass from Michael Hughes and beat a defender before firing 
a left-footed shot past Antti Niemi and into the far corner of the 
net. Hughes almost added a second goal minutes later with a fierce 
shot from near the goal area but Niemi pushed the ball wide. The win 
atoned for Northern Ireland's 3-0 drubbing from Turkey in its Euro 
opener in Istanbul. Finland, which beat Moldova 3-2 in its Euro opener, 
had ample chances but Northern Ireland's Alan Fettis _ a third-choice 
goalkeeper at Premier League team Blackburn Rovers _ proved he was 
up to the task. Lineups: Northern Ireland: Alan Fettis, Aaron Hughes, 
Kevin Horlock, Darren Patterson, Steve Morrow, Neil Lennon, Philip 
Mulryne, Keith Gillespie, Keith Rowland, Michael Hughes, Iain Dowie. 
Finland: Antti Niemi, Harri Ylonen, Juha Reini, Sami Hyypia, Tommi 
Kautonen, Mika-Matti Paatelainen, Aki Riihilahti, Jari Ilola, Simo 
Valkari, Joonas Kolkka, Jonatan Johansson.
