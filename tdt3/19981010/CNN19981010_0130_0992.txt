"Buy low, sell high" some of the oldest advice when it comes to buying 
stocks. Problem is, buying low can be a slippery slope in a tumultuous 
market. John metaxas has more. Wall Street professionals say the first 
lesson to learn when trying to buy the dips is that just because a 
stock is down, that does not mean it is a good value. If you buy on 
the dip and the dip isn't a dip, it's just the beginning of a steep 
down slope, you're really going to regret that. So stop -- don't run 
to your phone to call your broker. Stop first and do your homework. 
Technical analysts look at indicators such as the average price of 
a stock over a certain period of time, the so-called "moving average." 
Breaking below that average is a Negative. Once the bank stocks broke 
their 20-month moving averages, once the airline stocks broke the 
20-month moving averages, once the brokerage stocks broke their 20-month 
moving averages, it was free fall from there. Others try to assess 
fundamental value in a historical context. Take a stock like Merrill 
Lynch, for example. A great company and it's down 50%. Is it a good 
buy? Well, compare it to its absolute historical value and the answer 
will be no. It's still trading at a 30% or 40% premium to its average 
price-to-earnings and average price-to-book. And so you'd have to 
say no, not yet on the brokers, for example. Grisanti says look for 
companies like Cisco systems, whose competitive position he believes 
is sound, and which at recent prices was trading at substantial discount 
to its historical price earnings ratio. Finally, some professionals 
will not try to buy at the bottom, but rather wait until a stock has 
come back some -- a rising price reflecting improved prospects for 
the company. That's "your money." John metaxas, "CNN Financial News,"
