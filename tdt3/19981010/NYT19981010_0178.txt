Many buyers of new houses are taking advantage of a builders' marketing 
strategy of selling houses from blueprints or scale models at so-called 
preconstruction prices before model houses are built. ``Builders often 
presell jobs to establish some momentum and are often willing to sell 
these houses at lower prices and at very little profit because they 
will help fuel sales for the majority of the job,'' said Michael Dubb, 
a partner with Lesley A. Lerner of the Beechwood Organization, builders 
in Williston Park, N.Y. ``Purchasers who have a little bit of imagination 
and can visualize what they are getting are often the beneficiaries 
of good savings as well as choice locations.'' Dubb, who is also co-president 
of the Long Island Builders Institute, successfully used the strategy 
at a Melville, N.Y., project, Country Pointe, initially starting sales 
from space he rented at the Huntington Hilton Hotel, close to the 
site. He was able to place 40 houses under contract before building 
model houses. ``So instead of building just the models and a sales 
pavilion, I started the job by building the models plus 40 homes,'' 
he said. The Country Pointe development is now completely sold, and 
Dubb has adopted the same marketing tool in a Manorville, N.Y., development, 
Rockhill Woods, where Beechwood is building 51 houses on lots of one 
to two-and-a-half acres. Sales began about eight weeks ago. Even without 
models, the builders have placed 12 houses under contract. The first 
five buyers got the best deals, paying $215,000 to $325,000 for the 
four- and five-bedroom colonial and Victorian-style houses, which 
range from 2,400 to 3,300 square feet. Prices have increased and now 
range from $225,000 to $350,000. But once models open in about a month, 
prices will rise again, to a range of $250,000 to $400,000, Dubb said. 
``It's definitely a self-education process, but by being the first 
ones in, you already have equity because you know the builder is going 
to raise his prices,'' said Christopher Rizzi, who with his wife, 
Marie, was among the first buyers at Rockhill Woods. They are paying 
$242,000 for their four-bedroom colonial. The price on the same house 
has gone up $7,000 since they signed their contract in July. Preconstruction 
prices are also being offered at a Selden, N.Y., development called 
the Meadows at Old Town where Meadowood Properties of Islandia is 
building 67 houses on quarter-acre lots. Models are still under construction. 
But that did not stop Stephen Rubbo from signing a contract recently 
on a three-bedroom, 2,000-square-foot colonial priced at $199,990, 
even though he and his girlfriend, Heather Rippe, had to visualize 
what it would look like from blueprints. ``We'd done a lot of looking 
at previously owned homes, the neighborhood looked nice, the location 
was good and the preconstruction prices they were offering we felt 
were pretty good,'' said Rubbo, who works as a supervisor at a Hauppauge 
insurance company. James L. Neisloss, a principal of Meadowood Properties 
with his partner, Douglas S. Partrick, said he expected to raise prices 
5 percent around Nov. 1, when the models open. Prices now range from 
$199,990 to $244,990. The advantage of preconstruction sales, Neisloss 
said, is ``getting an immediate cash inflow while you are setting 
up shop, so to speak.'' He added that ``it also becomes a real sales 
incentive when buyers see that others have committed money and that 
the builder is going forward with the project.'' Early buyers at a 
development of 57 houses in Huntington called Timber Ridge at Huntington, 
which opened last March, saved up to $25,000 by purchasing from blueprints. 
Twenty of the 57 houses were placed in contract before models opened. 
Preconstruction prices on the four- to five-bedroom colonials, which 
range from 2,000 to 3,000 square feet, were from $245,000 to $310,000. 
With all but 11 of the 57 houses sold, prices are now $270,000 to 
$330,000. ``It's difficult to visualize a house from blueprints, and 
it's a leap of faith for people, but we have been building in this 
area for a long time, so that gives them a degree of confidence,'' 
said Donald M. Eversoll of Klein &AMP; Eversoll of Commack, the project's 
developer. ``The real point is, in a tough market a builder is not 
going to sell from blueprints because people have lots of choices 
and their position is, `I want to see what I'm going to buy.' ``In 
this market, where there aren't a lot of choices, and particularly 
if you're in a prime area, you're able to say to the buyer, `Show 
a little faith, and you'll be able to save some money.''' Josephine 
DeStefano, who with her husband, John, were the first buyers in the 
Huntington development, signed a contract last March to purchase one 
of the 2,800-square-foot colonials for $275,000. The same house is 
now selling for $288,000. Before making the commitment, they did a 
lot of research on the builder, Mrs. DeStefano said. They also drove 
through other developments built by Klein &AMP; Eversoll to see what 
they were like. ``We trusted, based on what we saw and based on their 
reputation, and so far we are very pleased,'' Mrs. DeStefano said. 
And even though they only had drawings to work with, they were able 
to customize the house for themselves and their three children, Mrs. 
DeStefano said. For example, they enlarged the kitchen, adding extra 
cabinets, added an office at the back of the house and enlarged the 
den, expanding the house by 350 square feet. Buyers today are usually 
quite sophisticated, said Dennis Esposito, owner of Realty Group Marketing 
in Smithtown, N.Y., which is handling the marketing on several new 
projects where builders are selling from blueprints. ``What we are 
seeing today is that many jobs open with just a sales trailer,'' he 
said. ``We sit down with people and walk them through the blueprints, 
and if they want to make changes we can do that.'' The cost, depending 
on how much time it takes the architect to revise the plan, is usually 
minimal, he said. And, should a development fail to materialize, buyers 
are protected because deposits made at the time a contract is signed 
_ typically 10 percent of the purchase price _ either go into an escrow 
account or the builder is bonded by an insurance company, he noted. 
The balance of the payment is due when the house is completed and 
the closing takes place. Buyers who purchase their houses from blueprints 
obviously take more of a risk. Memories of bankrupt builders leaving 
behind partly-developed projects during the recession of the early 
90's still linger. But in interviews, buyers all said they took common-sense 
precautions such as checking out the builder's track record. ``If 
you worry about everything, you're not going to have anything,'' said 
Rubbo, the Meadows at Old Town buyer. ``We made the decision, `We've 
seen everything out there, it's a good price, so let's go for it.''' 
In a 23-acre Dix Hills subdivision called the Estates at Half Hollow, 
where the Park Ridge Organization of Ronkonkoma, N.Y., is building 
20 houses on lots of an acre or more, five houses have been placed 
under contract based on blueprints only. ``We will be putting up a 
model, but those who purchase prior to the model are saving thousands 
of dollars,'' said Kim Mancini, the marketing director for Park Ridge. 
Prices at the Estates start at $639,000 for a four-bedroom 4,000-square-foot 
Victorian and go up to $784,000 for one with 4,500 square feet. By 
the time the final houses are sold, prices will probably have risen 
$30,000 to $40,000, Ms. Mancini said. Buying from blueprints is not 
for everyone, said Marilyn Larsen of Lane Realty in Great Neck, marketing 
consultants to builders. ``Some people need the ability to walk through 
a house and are willing to take the risk that prices will be higher 
when the model is open,'' she said. Among her customers to benefit 
from a preconstruction deal, however, were Michelle and Thomas Runfola, 
who signed a contract in February 1997 to buy a four-bedroom colonial 
at a Melville development called the Villages at Huntington after 
looking at a plexiglass model. The project is being developed by McGovern-Barbash 
of Babylon. The Runfolas, who moved into the house in August, paid 
$325,000. The same house now sells for $400,000. ``It was really hard 
to judge, but it looked like it would be a beautiful home,'' Mrs. 
Runfola said. ``And if anything, it turned out to be better than we 
expected.''
