VALKENBURG, Netherlands (AP) - Diana Ziliute, a 22-year-old Lithuanian, 
surprised the veterans to capture the women's elite road race Saturday 
at the World Cycling Championship. Ziliute, who won the junior world 
title 1994, took the final sprint over 28-year-old Leontien van Moorsel 
of the Netherlands, who won the time trial title on Wednesday. German 
Hanka Kupfernagel took third. Ziliute's time was 2 hours, 35 minutes, 
35 seconds. She rides for an Italian team and has lived in Italy near 
Venice for three years. ``But, of course, for the world championships, 
I am Lithuanian,'' Ziliute said in fluent Italian. Defending champion, 
30-year-old Alessandra Cappellotto of Italy was fifth. Jeannie Longo, 
a 12-time world champion who turns 40 at the end of this month, was 
ninth after leading until the final sprint of the 103.2-kilometer 
(64.1-mile) race. The men's race is on Sunday, rounding off the six-day 
competition. American Lance Armstrong, in a comeback from cancer, 
is in a small group of favorites for the men's title. He won the event 
in 1993 before having to miss the worlds the last two years after 
being diagnosed with cancer. Michele Bartoli and Andrea Tafi head 
the strong Italian team with Michael Boogerd and Leon van Bon the 
top Dutch riders. In the women's race, Ziliute was part of a small 
group that broke away just after the start of the sixth and final 
lap of the 17.2-kilometer (10.7-mile) circuit. Up the final steep 
climb, Longo led the small group and held the lead into the final 
straightaway until the final sprint. ``Nobody wanted to be in front. 
I am not a sprinter. I tried my best to push very hard on the last 
hill to break away,'' Longo said. Then the main group passed her easily 
with Ziliute taking control to win clearly, raising her arms in the 
air as she crossed the line. ``This year was incrediable , I had a 
great condition from the very beginning until the very end,'' Ziliute 
said. She recently won a World Cup race in the Netherlands. ``Maybe 
the Netherlands is good luck for me. But also maybe the weather. It 
was rainy, windy and cold. You find that in Lithuania,'' she said. 
Longo knew she was beaten when she couldn't shake the group. ``I saw 
the other girls and I said to myself `No way,' '' Longo said. ``To 
be third, fourth, fifth or eighth means nothing to me. I was after 
the championship.'' Longo had won the road title in 1985, 1986, 1987, 
1989 and 1995 in addition to three time trials and four track titles. 
She was fifth in Wednesday's time trial. Van Moorsel came on in the 
final meters to take second ahead of Kupfernagel, who also took third 
in the time trial earlier in the week. Another Lithuanian, Rasa Polikeviciute 
was fourth, raising her arm in triumph when she saw Ziliute winning. 
Earlier Saturday Ireland's Mark Scanlon won the junior men's event 
over 120.4 kilometers (75 miles)
