Several big companies announced imminent layoffs this week, and there 
was big news in the government's charge against credit cards. David 
Daniel reviews the week in business. The nation's two most pervasive 
purveyors of plastic drew fire this week. The justice department filed 
an antitrust suit against visa and Mastercard, claiming they prevent 
banks from issuing competitors' cards. More competition, according 
to the justice department, would mean lower interest rates for customers. 
American consumers have simply lost out. They have lost the benefit 
of vigorous competition between the two largest credit card networks, 
which means that they have not enjoyed the innovation that competition 
brings. Visa says customers have unlimited choices. It's promising 
to fight the lawsuit vigorously.
