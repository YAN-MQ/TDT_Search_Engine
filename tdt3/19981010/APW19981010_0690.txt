Lithuania only managed a 0-0 draw with the Faeroe Islands in a European 
Group 9 qualifier Saturday night. It was the second straight goalless 
match for the Lithuanians, who started their campaign at home against 
World Cup qualifier Scotland early September. Goalleeper Jakup Mikkelsen, 
who plays in Denmark for Herfolge, made several outstandings saves 
for the Faeroes, including a 16-meter shot by midfielder Valdas Ivanauskas 
in the 32nd minute. A dull game with sporadic attacks, it was spoiled 
by heavy rain and a wet field that led to many technical mistakes. 
Three players were cautioned in a match watched by about 2,000 fans, 
Raimond Cutautas and Ivanauskas of Lithuania and Oli Johannensen of 
the Faeroes. ___ Lineups Lithuania _ Gyntaras Stauzi, Andraius Skirla,
