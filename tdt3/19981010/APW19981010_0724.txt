Bjorn Borg won a Champions tiebreak Saturday to defeat fellow Swede 
Mats Wilander 7-6 (7-3), 4-6, 12-10 in the MTN Champions at the University 
of Pretoria. Borg will face Australia's John Fitzgerald in Sunday's 
title match of the senior tennis tournament. Fitzgerald advanced with 
a 7-6 (7-4), 6-3 victory over Yannick Noah of France. Wilander graciously 
conceded Borg's challenge of an umpire's decision and gave up a point 
at 10-10 in the tiebreak. ``This is tennis, not life and death,'' 
Wilander said. Fitzgerald has never played singles against Borg. ``What 
can one really say about him. He's Borg,'' Fitzgerald said. ``I'll 
be playing against a living legend.'' The doubles final will pit Fitzgerald 
and South African Kevin Curren against Borg and Wilander.
