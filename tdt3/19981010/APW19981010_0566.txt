The Czech Republic clinched a 3-1 away victory at Bosnia-Herzegovina 
on Saturday and firmed up its lead in the qualifying Group 9 for the 
2000 European Championship. The Czechs took the lead in the 12th minute 
on a magnificent shot by Miroslav Baranjek from more than 25 meters 
(yards). Pressing for an equalizer, Bosnia missed a few good chances 
and conceded a second goal after a swift counter-attack in 59th minute 
that ended with a header by Vladimir Smicer. A Bosnian substitute, 
Marko Topic, provided a glimpse of hope for the home-team, netting 
in the 88th minute after one of the rare well-organized attacks. But 
in the last moments of the match, Patrik Berger scored the third goal 
from a free-kick from some 19 meters (yards). The ball deflected off 
another Czech player, Pavel Kuka. Although Bosnia had the initiative 
throughout the match, the Czech Republic dominated with smart defense, 
good combinations in midfield and fast counter-attacks. ``We were 
playing against a super-strong team,'' admitted Bosnian coach Dzemaludin 
Musovic after the match. He said the final result ``may be showing 
the real difference between the two teams.'' At the end of the match, 
more than 30,000 spectators applauded the Czechs and booed their own 
national team. Bosnia-Herzegovina and Czech Republic play in the group 
together with Scotland, Faeroe Islands, Estonia and Litvania. ---
