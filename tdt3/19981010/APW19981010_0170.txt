A woman was arrested Saturday on suspicion she collected a package 
containing nearly half a kilogram (one pound) of heroin from Thailand 
for shipment to the United States. The drugs, hidden in the covers 
of several photo albums, were discovered by customs officers running 
a scanner as the package arrived from Bangkok last Thursday. Police 
waited until Saturday morning when Minda Santos came to the airport's 
mail center to pick up the package. Ms. Santos initially denied any 
knowledge of the drugs but later said it was the third time she had 
helped ship the drugs from Thailand to the United States, said Lourdes 
Mangawang, chief of the legal division of the airport customs police. 
The package contained 489.55 grams (1.08 pounds) of heroin with a 
street value of dlrs 1,500 per gram (0.035 ounce), Mangawang said. 
Narcotics police seized the drugs. Ms. Santos faces drug-trafficking 
charges, which carry the death penalty in the Philippines upon conviction.
