Police detained for 24 hours the son of Sheik Omar Abdel-Rahman, the 
blind Egyptian cleric jailed in the United States, police officials 
said Saturday. The arrest Thursday of Abdullah Abdel-Rahman in Cairo 
came as part of a ``routine security sweep and search of the area,'' 
said the official, speaking on customary condition of anonymity. He 
was released Friday night and no charges were made. Police arrested 
Abdel-Rahman as he drove up to his house in Cairo, said Montasser 
el-Zayat, Abdel-Rahman's lawyer. ``They arrested him, searched the 
house and took him away,'' el-Zayat told The Associated Press. He 
said no reason was given for the arrest, which was his first. Officials 
at the Interior Ministry, which is responsible for Egypt's security 
forces, declined to comment on the case. Abdel-Rahman, a third-year 
religious studies student at Al-Azhar University, is not believed 
to be involved with activities linked to the Islamic Group, which 
has fought an insurgency against the government. But el-Zayat said 
he believes the arrest could have come because ``he was campaigning 
on behalf of his father.'' Skeik Omar was the Islamic Group's spiritual 
leader. He was sentenced to life in prison in 1995 for sanctioning 
a plot to blow up the United Nations, the FBI headquarters, two tunnels 
and a bridge.
