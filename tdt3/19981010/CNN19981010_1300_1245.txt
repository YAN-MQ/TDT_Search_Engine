But first to the gridiron. Only a couple of top-25 games in progress. 
First up, the top-ranked buckeyes are in Illinois. Ohio state is in 
control of this one. The 16th-ranked mountaineers are playing the 
first big east game of the season. Iowa state, Missouri's Devon west 
and the cyclones darrin Davis. Later this afternoon, it's a battle 
of SEC undefeated. The volunteers are without star running back Jamal 
Lewis, who is out for the season. Obviously, others have to step up. 
As far as this being the whole offense, we won't be able to lean on 
one guy, as we have been. Also today, number 2 Nebraska coming off 
the narrow win last week against Oklahoma state, is in college station. 
Tonight, Arizona returns home to play third-ranked UCLA after that 
dramatic win last week over Washington. Battle of big 12 north division 
teams meet in Colorado as the buffaloes host number 5 Kansas state. 
Two teams that many thought would be undefeated at this point face 
off in Baton Rouge, LSU versus Florida.
