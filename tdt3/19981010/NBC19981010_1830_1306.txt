a show of contempt for hate day in a college town where a gay student 
matthew sheperd was brewally beaten. the homecoming parade at the 
university of wyoming. after the band and the floats and the hoopla, 
a quiet reminder that something ugly happened here this week. we need 
to get out and show people that there are people that care. the homecoming 
parade doubled in size as more joined to make a statement against 
hate. this is a terrible crime against a person no matter if he is 
black, colored, gay or white. you don't treat people that way. university 
freshman matthew sheppard, a gay man, was tied to this wooden fence 
outside of town beaten, tortured and left for dead. 21-year-old russell 
arthur henderson and 22-year-old aaron mckinney remain in jail accused 
of attemped murder, kidnapping and robbery. law enforcment officials 
will not release any information on the suspects' prior criminal records. 
people who know them paint a picture of hendeson and mckinney that 
seems, if anything, small-town ordinary. coworkers at a local fast 
food restaurant, describe henderson as a good employee. he lived in 
a house trailer on the edge of town. there are bags of empty beer 
cans against the fence there. neighbor ward mcclelland says he complained 
to the police at least three times of henderson shooting fireworks 
and throwing bottles. we just considered him young and dumb, but object 
ji owsley he committed a heal dumb thing. mckinney lived in town in 
an apartment in this house. one neighbor who has known him for years 
says mckinney was a buddy, not a biggot. he is not a guy that walks 
around and hates blacks or hates gays. at the homecoming football 
game, 15,000 people stood in silence for matthew sherpard and less 
than two miles away, down a dusty country road, at the fence where 
the beating took place, another smaller sign that shepard will not 
soon be forgotten here. jack chesnutt, nbc news, laramie, wyoming. 
sheperd remains in critical condition tonight.
