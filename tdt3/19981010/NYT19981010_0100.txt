Darkness comes early these days. Each rainfall strips more leaves 
from trees, soon to be bare. But despite omens of winter, Michelle 
Genovesi has summer on her mind. Ms. Genovesi, real estate agent extraordinaire, 
has clients who routinely rent out their houses for the summer season. 
Three such rentals are already listed in this Gold Coast suburb, which 
is not generally thought a resort, expanding and contracting with 
the seasons. If the Wall Street tumble doesn't blunt demand, about 
70 houses will soon be listed, to be leased from Memorial Day to Labor 
Day. Real-estate agents are a bullish bunch by nature, and Ms. Genovesi 
and her colleagues at the William Raveis agency here have been chirping 
about a mere market correction, putting a happy face on a global meltdown. 
But their optimism could be justified in terms of summer properties. 
``When the market goes flat, we do well in the summer,'' said Ms. 
Genovesi, consistently the top producer at the agency, which beckons 
its tasteful clients with oriental rungs, nautical paintings and bouquets 
of dried hydrangea. ``Then people are cutting back on going to Europe 
and doing other, more costly things.'' Not everyone here has the riches 
of F. Scott Fitzgerald or Paul Newman, two of Westport's favorite 
sons. Some are divorced, widowed or elderly and of limited means. 
It is these homeowners, for the most part, who give up summer at the 
shore for the rental income that helps pay bills from October to June. 
Jan Hakes, for example, rents out her graceful family-size home on 
Apple Tree Trail _ ``one of the sweetest, quietest streets at the 
beach,'' her listing says _ and moves in with her daughter in town. 
At $18,000 for the season, Ms. Genovesi said, Mrs. Hakes will be able 
to afford a new roof and a renovated bathroom. The typical summer 
renter, by contrast, is a young family from Manhattan, with a couple 
of kids, a stay-at-home mom and a commuting dad. A house on the East 
End of Long Island, or on Martha's Vineyard, would separate the couple 
from Monday to Friday. In Westport, everyone eats dinner together 
at the end of an easy Metro-North commute. The hottest properties 
are ``just steps'' from Compo Beach, a long crescent of shoreline 
on the sound. These same houses are within walking distance of the 
Longshore Club Park, with its tennis courts, sailing school, marina, 
golf course and pool at the water's edge. The club is free for Westport 
taxpayers. Renters pay ``a pittance,'' Ms. Genovesi said. (Translation: 
$350 for the season.) Prices may soften. But last summer's rentals 
ranged from $2,500 for a week in a two-bedroom, 100-year-old house 
on Main Street to $75,000 for the season in a Great Gatsby estate 
on the sound, with pool and tennis court. Agents here and in the Hamptons 
say that Westport prices are about half the rents on the East End 
of Long Island. There are 10,000 homes in town, with a median value 
of $700,000; 73 of them rented last summer. The listings testify to 
a life style that has made Fairfield County synonymous with luxury. 
A home with eight bedrooms and five baths is considered middle-of-the-pack. 
Easy access to the beach can be trumped by clay courts and a heated 
pool. Charm and character, exquisite antiques and an exercise room 
are nice. So is a landlord who pays for pool and lawn care. Not all 
the landlords are frugal Yankee widows. One of Ms. Genovesi's clients 
rents out while vacationing in Spain. Another has several residences. 
(She can't recall how many.) A third spends the summer volunteering 
his expertise in developing nations as a retired CEO in developing 
nations. Then there is a fellow real estate agent, a single mother, 
who moves in with a friend each summer in order to rent out her home 
and make her mortgage payments for the year. Many of the renters eventually 
buy, among them Pat Maxwell, another of Ms. Genovesi's associates. 
Ms. Maxwell, who is divorced, summered in Sag Harbor until one particularly 
awful five-hour drive back to Manhattan on the Long Island Expressway. 
She had long been devoting far too much time to the weekly conundrum 
of whether to leave the beach early and ruin Sunday, or stay until 
the traffic quiets at 10 p.m. and crawl through the workday on Monday. 
``Half the weekend is spent deciding when you're going to get on the 
road,'' Ms. Maxwell said. ``It becomes too much of a production. This 
takes half as much time and costs half as much money.''
