There's a break up to report in the shoe business. Stride rite and 
Levi Strauss are discontinuing the Levi's brand of shoes. The reason, 
according to stride rite -- "disappointing sales." The two companies 
struck a licensing agreement last year. Stride rite, targeting young 
men and boys, was hoping for as much as $40 million in annual sales. 
Instead, it will take a pretax charge of $5 million, mostly to cover 
the costs of getting rid of all the unsold shoes.
