Almost from the moment Dave Stewart retired from the mound three years 
ago after pitching for 21 seasons _ and took the most intimidating 
scowl in baseball with him _ all the former four-time 20-game winner 
has ever wanted to be is a major league general manager. But Stewart 
is caught in something of a Catch-22 these days: Because he has been 
so successful as the pitching coach of the San Diego Padres this season, 
he could be excused for fearing that nobody will give him the chance 
to do anything else. ``I think a lot of people are going to say, `This 
guy's a great pitching coach, this guy's got a knack for working with 
pitchers.' '' Stewart said Saturday, as the upstart Padres held a 
surprising 2-games-to-0 lead in the National League Championship Series 
over the heavily favored Atlanta Braves. ``But I hope someone will 
give me the opportunity to show that I can be successful at a different 
level.'' It was that sort of thinking that led general manager Kevin 
Towers to ask Stewart if he would consider becoming the Padres pitching 
coach in the first place. Stewart, now 41, did not have any prior 
coaching experience. ``We felt like we needed to address our pitching 
staff and add a certain presence to help some of these young pitchers 
grow,'' Towers said. ``We felt we had some great arms, but that they 
were underachieving, not physically, but mentally. And Stew was a 
guy we already had internally in the front office. I thought he would 
be the perfect guy.'' Towers knew about Stewart's desire to be a general 
manager. So, the question is, why would Stewart, who has no managerial 
aspirations, put a uniform back on? ``I was thinking for the right 
reasons I can do this,'' Stewart said. ``I can help the ball club 
win, I can help the organization and I can teach. But I don't see 
my future on the field. At the ball park, I love it. But when I'm 
off the field, I wish I was in my office.'' Towers said he initially 
hired Stewart, who was a member of the Oakland Athletics organization, 
because of his networking abilities, his background in the game and 
his numerous contacts. ``I can still utilize him the same way,'' Towers 
said. ``All I have to do is walk down to the clubhouse. I have the 
best of both worlds.'' Stewart knows he has made a strong first impression. 
Now he wants the chance to make a name for himself in a major league 
front office _ where there is still a dearth of minority general managers. 
``As long as there are no minorities, it should be something that 
will help me,'' said Stewart, who is black. ``Whether it's unfair, 
I don't know. I just think there should be more minorities in decision-making 
positions and more opportunities for minorities to interview for decision-making 
positions. And not just on the field, where it doesn't seem like a 
problem.'' In the meantime, Stewart has helped turn around an underachieving 
pitching staff. The Padres' 3.63 ERA _ the third-best in the National 
League this season _ was more than a run lower than last season's 
franchise-high 4.99. In fact, the 1998 Padres seem to have taken on 
the personality of Stewart and the staff ace Kevin Brown. ``Between 
him and Brown, I think the pitching staff finally developed a true 
identity,'' Towers said. Which is to say, a cross between mean and 
nasty on the mound. Stewart plays down his influence. ``The most important 
thing about my job is to make sure the guys are motivated and focused,'' 
he said. ``You don't teach intensity,'' Stewart continued. ``What 
you do is lay out a blueprint. They see the results and become that 
on their own.'' What Stewart has been able to teach is his philosophy: 
which begins with pitching on the inside part of the plate. ``All 
I asked is take a part of the plate and make that part your own,'' 
Stewart said. ``Sandy Koufax always said make that bat small. It makes 
you pitch to the short end of the bat.'' The Padres, led by their 
starters Brown, Andy Ashby, Joey Hamilton and Sterling Hitchcock, 
have outpitched the heavily-favored Braves over the first two games 
of this series. And they outpitched the favored Houston Astros to 
win their three-of-five division series in four games. Stewart's pitchers 
have limited the opposition to two runs or fewer in five of their 
six post-season games thus far. ``It's hard to say how much of an 
impact he's had on the staff over the last year,'' said Sterling Hitchcock 
of Stewart. ``But I think he's had a huge impact. I think everybody 
has learned a little something from Stew this year.'' Does that include 
his ace? ``The best thing to do with Kevin Brown is let him alone,'' 
Stewart said. ``The fork ball is the only thing I worked with him 
on. He's an independent broker, man. You don't need to mess with him. 
Brownie had an attitude of his own. Everyone has their own personal 
attitude. But as a staff, I think we've formed an identity of our 
own. I don't know if it's mine. But we're pretty tough on hitters.'' 
And uncomfortable, too? ``Uncomfortable?'' Stewart said, the corners 
of his mouth barely betraying a grin. ``Yes.''
