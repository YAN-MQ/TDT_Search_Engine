Goals from Jaap Stam and Peter van Vossen gave coach Frank Rijkaard 
a 2-0 victory over Peru Saturday in his first outing in charge of 
the Dutch side. The first half was frustratingly goalless with the 
Dutch, a semifinalist this summer in France, dominating in all areas 
of the field except the Peru penalty box. In the end it took a big 
defender's power at dead ball situation to break the deadlock. Manchester 
United's Stam first forced a brilliant parry from Oscar Ibanez in 
the Peru goal with a pile-driving free kick then rose to head home 
the resulting corner on 56 minutes. The with a quarter of an hour 
to go Edgar Davids' chipped through-ball found substitute Peter van 
Vossen, who celebrated his return to international football with a 
coolly-taken goal. Playing flowing, incisive football the Dutch created 
half a dozen chances in the first half, the first for Marc Overmars 
after intricate work from Patrick Kluivert and Dennis Bergkamp. And 
Bergkamp went close himself on nine minutes with a trademark curler 
from the edge of the box which just missed the post. Kluivert missed 
three great chances, shooting wide from six (meters) yards, almost 
scrambling the ball in after a Juan Reynoso defensive error and striking 
the bar with a header from a corner. Just before half time Edwin van 
der Sar turned a free kick from Nolberto Solano round the post and 
the Newcastle United player went close again near the end of the game, 
this time denied by Van der Sar's feet. Rijkard, veteran of 73 internationals 
including the Dutch 1988 European Championship-winning team, kept 
faith with most of the Dutch World Cup stars, and SC Heerenveen's 
Jeffrey Talan was the only new face in the starting lineup. Lineups 
Netherlands: Edwin van der Sar, Michael Reiziger, Jaap Stam, Frank 
de Boer, Phillip Cocu, Edgar Davids, Jeffrey Talan, Ronald de Boer 
(Clarence Seedorf 71), Patrick Kluivert, Dennis Bergkamp, Marc Overmars 
(Peter van Vossen 68). Peru: Oscar Ibanez, Jorge Soto, Juan Reynoso, 
Santiago Salazar, Nolberto Salano, Juan Jayo, Gregorio Bernales, Jose 
Pereda, Roberto Palacios, Carlos Flores (Jorge Hauman 58), Flavio 
Maestri.
