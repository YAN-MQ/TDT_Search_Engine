Another family has filed a lawsuit over the crash of Swissair flight 
111. The family of a Greek music teacher killed in the crash is demanding 
$1.25 billion. The suit claims the airline was negligent in failing 
to fix wiring problems on the MD-11 aircraft. The September crash 
killed all 229 people aboard. Former boxing champion Jake lamotta, 
whose son died in the crash, has filed a similar suit asking for $50 
million.
