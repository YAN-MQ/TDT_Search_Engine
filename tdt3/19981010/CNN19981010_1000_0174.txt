The house and Senate are also scrambling to approve GOP-sponsored 
two tax cut bills. Both tax cuts are in the $8.5 billion to $9 billion 
range. And both extend some expiring tax credits for business. It's

business tax credits. And the length of the exclusion of agreed upon 
credits. Both bills also include some tax breaks for farmers.
