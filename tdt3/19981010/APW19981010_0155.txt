The opposition northern alliance has captured a strategic airport 
from the hard-line Taliban Islamic militia after heavy fighting in 
the northeastern Takhar province, opposition sources said Saturday. 
About 200 Taliban fighters were killed or taken prisoners by the opposition 
forces after fierce fighting close to the borders of the central Asian 
state of Tajikistan, opposition sources told The Associated Press 
on condition of anonymity from the northern Badakshan province. The 
capture of Khojaghar airport near Taloqan, the capital of Takhar province 
is the first major victory for the opposition forces after suffering 
a string of defeats by the Taliban in recent months. The area is 260 
kilometers (160 miles) north of the capital Kabul. The Taliban militia, 
which controls more than 90 percent of Afghanistan, including Kabul, 
have denied the opposition claims of victory. The Taliban, or the 
students of Islam, are Sunni Muslims and are mostly Pakhtoons. The 
opposition alliance comprise mainly the religious and ethnic minorities 
including Shiites, Tajiks, Uzbeks and Hazaras. The Taliban follows 
a strict version of Islam that bars women from work and education, 
bans arts and music and forces men to wear beards.
