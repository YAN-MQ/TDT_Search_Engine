This is Orelon Sidney from the CNN weather center with your "Headline 
News weather update." Three areas of low pressure will play in the 
forecast for Sunday. One low pressure system in the northeast will 
be moving off the eastern seaboard. Another area of low pressure will 
move out of the Rockies and into the plains states. Look for increasing 
chances of rain for the dakotas and Minnesota. A third area of low 
pressure will move on to the northwest coast with increasing showers 
for British Columbia and Vancouver into the puget sound. In the south, 
generally look for fair weather. But a chance of showers and thunderstorms 
lingers along the cold front south of lake okeechobee. Temperatures 
will be in the 80s across southern Florida, stretching across Texas 
into the desert southwest. Some 90s could be noted across portions 
of the Rio Grande valley and across the gulf of California. In the 
north, temperatures will be on the cool side with 40s and 50s. The 
extended forecast calls for strong thunderstorm possibilities on Monday 
in the Great Lakes changing to a few showers and a few thunderstorms 
on Tuesday with rain continuing on the west coast.
