The Cleveland Indians jumped out to a lead against New York in the 
American league championship series after Friday's 6-1 triumph. Manny 
Ramirez added a homer. Game four takes place Saturday night. To be 
honest, I've had a very tough time with their left-handers. And to 
hit the two home runs was nice, but it definitely wasn't on my mind 
hitting home runs. The national league championship resumes Saturday 
afternoon. San Diego has a surprising two games to nun lead. The pause 
drais will start with hitchcock.
