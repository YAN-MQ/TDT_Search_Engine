It's not easy being Monica _ even for one night. The nation's major 
mask makers have taken a pass on Monica Lewinsky this Halloween, worried 
about possible lawsuits over the use of her likeness. So revelers 
will have to improvise with wigs and berets, and many plan to do so. 
Party stores and costume makers report that this season's best-selling 
spooking gear is all about Ms. Lewinsky, President Clinton, Hillary 
Rodham Clinton, Linda Tripp and Kenneth Starr. Abracadabra in New 
York City sells Clinton masks with Pinocchio noses (available for 
several years). Halloween Adventure, another New York shop, offers 
masks of the Clintons with Titanic life preservers. In Washington, 
Backstage Inc. got some practice for Halloween recently when a bar 
held a Linda Tripp look-alike contest. ``They bought blonde wigs and 
took black Magic Markers to the roots,'' said Sandra Duraes, the manager. 
The absence of Monica masks has been a disappointment to some, but 
the mask companies may have been wise to steer clear. An aide (yes, 
an aide) to Ms. Lewinsky said no one had asked permission to license 
a Monica mask, but that if anyone did, Ms. Lewinsky would refuse. 
The aide said Ms. Lewinsky's lawyers are looking for ways to crack 
down on entrepreneurs who have used her picture on cookies, T-shirts 
and postcards. Thus, the full Monica, like slipping past a Secret 
Service agent, takes creativity. At Morris Costumes in Charlotte, 
N.C., clerks are cutting the red ribbons out of their Snow White wigs. 
``Bada-boom, bada-bing _ you've got Monica Lewinsky,'' said C. Ashley 
Coolik, an enterprising sales associate. Cesar Inc. in New York's 
Flatiron District, recommends adapting its ``Witchy Woman'' mask. 
Abracadabra offers a Monica wig, a beret and a wig-beret combo. Annie's 
Costumes and Magic, in Plantation, Fla., offers a blue dress. ``The 
big Halloween dilemma is where to put the stain,'' said assistant 
manager Jerry Sturdevant. Various ``intern kits'' also are for sale. 
At the chain of Spirit Halloween Superstores, the package costs $14.99 
and includes a hat, a pearl necklace and an ``intern pass.'' Halloween 
fads of recent years suggest that becoming a popular costume is a 
fleeting measure of infamy. Jim and Tammy Faye Bakker, Saddam Hussein, 
Lorena Bobbitt and Woody Allen all were hottest when the news about 
them was the worst. Thomas Campbell, the president of Classic Distributing 
Co. in Audubon, N.J., pointed out that he still hasn't been able to 
unload 2,000 O.J. Simpson masks. Dr. Jack Santino, a professor of 
popular culture at Bowling Green State University, said more than 
simple notoriety is involved. ``It's more dangerous _ you've been 
made a joke,'' he said. ``This is the people's holiday, and we delight 
in rubbing their nose in it.'' Still, the costume business has its 
decorous few. Frankie Stein, the owner of Frankie Steinz Costumes 
in New York, considered offering a knit dress with a stain but decided 
it would be tacky. ``We were tempted, but we've seen the light,'' 
she said. But others see a windfall. Morris Costumes president Philip 
Morris predicts that Clinton will have a Nixon-like shelf-life. ``Ten 
Halloweens from now, we'll be selling Clinton masks,'' he said. James 
Bradley, the sales manager at Mask Illusions in Chula Vista, Calif., 
is already thinking ahead. He has begun working on next season, calculating 
that a mask of Starr will be big. ``Ken Starr's head is shaped like 
a pear and he has big cheeks and a very comical smile that he tries 
to put on,'' Bradley said. For precedent, he points to the lasting 
appeal of President Jimmy Carter's big teeth, and Ross Perot's floppy 
ears. Perhaps the real optimists are the mask dealers who said they 
could console themselves about this year's shortage since by this 
time next year, no one will be talking about Monica Lewinsky.
