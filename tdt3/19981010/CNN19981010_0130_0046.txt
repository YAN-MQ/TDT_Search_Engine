"Headline News," I'm David Goodnow. The federal government will remain 
open at least through Monday midnight. President Clinton has signed 
an emergency temporary spending measure which prevents the government 
from shutting down for lack of money. Congress will work through the 
weekend in hopes of finishing the budget. The nation's spending authorization 
was supposed to be set by October 1st. But of the 13 appropriation 
bills needed to keep the government running, only five have been approved 
so far. Democrats say republicans are ignoring domestic spending needs. 
Republicans say President Clinton wants too spend too much.
