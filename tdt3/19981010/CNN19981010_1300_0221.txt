President Clinton's problems will have an impact on the November elections. 
So far, most candidates seem to be heating up the air waves without 
having to mention the words Monica Lewinsky. Bruce Morton has the 
story. Charles Schumer is a member of the house Judiciary committee, 
a speaker during the debate on the impeachment inquiry. But he's also 
the democrat running against senator Al D'Amato, and as ads like this 
show, he may be the sassiest opponent D'Amato's ever faced. Al D'Amato 
voted to cut the school lunch program, just like a Bully taking lunch 
money from hungry kids. hey, al! Pick on somebody your own size. a 
manhattanville college poll this week shows Schumer leading D'Amato, 
46% to 41%, among those most likely to vote, but that's within the 
poll's margin of error, so it's really a dead heat. But 40% said they 
had an unfavorable opinion of D'Amato, 25% said that of Schumer. In 
Illinois, senator Carol Moseley-Braun is thought to be trailing republican 
challenger Peter Fitzgerald, so her campaign is attacking him. Just 
last month, Fitzgerald actually proposed turning Medicare into an 
HMO where private insurance companies would control costs and limit 
treatment. He proposed investing social security in junk bonds, risking 
billions of retirement dollars. The question, can she demonize him 
enough to win? North Carolina republican senator, Lauch Faircloth, 
has been running Negative ads about his democratic opponent John Edwards. 
This week, Edwards hit back. Bull. You got that right. Lauch Faircloth's 
Negative ads are just a lot of bull. The fact is, John Edwards supports 
the death penalty. He's been endorsed by the state's largest police 
group. They're not liberal, they're not a union. They endorsed Jesse 
Helms last time. One last ad. Just watch this. A 21-year-old intern 
from Beverly Hills. A simple blue dress. A silver hatpin from you-know-who. 
Some politicians want to spend the next two years fighting over these 
matters, but then they wouldn't be fighting for smaller class sizes, 
lower property taxes, or a patients' Bill of rights. They wouldn't 
be Wendell young. Mr. young is a democratic candidate for the Pennsylvania 
state House of Representatives. What does Monica Lewinsky have to 
do with that? I have no idea. Bruce Morton, CNN, Washington.
