NASA may soon have to share a little more of outer space with other 
American organizations. Congress this week passed a measure that would 
allow private companies to launch reusable space vehicles, like the 
space shuttle. The commercial space act also would require the government 
to study ways to Foster the commercial space industry. Private companies 
currently are allowed to launch vehicles into space, but can't fly 
them back to earth. The measure has been sent to President Clinton 
for his signature.
