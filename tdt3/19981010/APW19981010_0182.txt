Aki Takamura fired a 3-under-par 69 Saturday to share a one-stroke 
lead with overnight leader Hiromi Takamura after three rounds in the 
80 million yen (dlrs 650,000) Takara World Invitational. Aki Takamura, 
the 1996 Japan Women's Open champion, scored four birdies against 
a bogey for a 1-under 215 total at the 6,226-yard, par-72 Caledonian 
Golf Club course. Hiromi Takamura, winless since her seventh career 
victory in the 1994 Toyo Suisan Ladies, went around in 71. The two 
co-leaders are not related. Nayoko Yoshikawa, seeking her first title 
in three years and 30th overall, shot the day's best round of 65 to 
share third place at even-par 216 with Taiwan's Cheng Mei-chi, who 
turned in a 70. Thirty wins will give Yoshikawa a permanent exempt 
status on the Japan LPGA Tour. South Korean Ku Ok-hee shot a 75 and 
was alone in fifth at 220. Another shot behind at 221 came Michiko 
Hattori, who is leading the money list this season, Natsuko Noro and 
Ko Woo-soon of South Korea. The four-round event offers a top prize 
of 14.4 million yen (dlrs 117,000).
