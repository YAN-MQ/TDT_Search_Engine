the military equation, now if nato's power is brought to bear. the 
u.s. today ordered b-52 bombers to join a massive nato force. nbc's 
jim miklaszewski tonight, on the targets and the consequences of a 
nato attack. the nato air war is planned to deliver a crushing blow 
to the serbian military. the u.s. would supply the bulk of the firepower. 
we are prepared to use the full breadth of our resources that are 
available to the department of defense if we have to go that step. 
cruise missiles, fired from us warships, submarines and airborne b-52s 
would lead the attack. then, if necessary, a sustained bombing campaign 
would follow. it would involve more than 400 nato warplanes, over 
half of them american, including a dozen american f-117 stealth fighters, 
and two b-2 stealth bombers. air strikes would be aimed at military 
targets, air defenses, command and control and major military installations 
throughout kosovo, serbia and yugoslavia. if yugoslav president milosevic 
still defies nato, attacks could be expanded to take out critical 
infrastructure like power grids and bridges. if you strike him on 
home turf, you've probably demonstrated that you're in this thing 
to stay. but the serb military has the ability to fight back. a network 
of surface-to-air missiles, many upgraded with the latest russian 
technology, could shoot down nato warplanes. we should not go in there 
with the illusion that this is going to be bloodless for the western 
sides. and after the air war, it could take a ground force, like the 
one now in bosnia, to keep the peace. the nato commander has told 
the pentagon, he may need as many as 25,000 american troops in kosovo. 
my hunch is a year or two from now the situation in kosovo if we are 
lucky, is going to look a lot like the situation in bosnia. and by 
that i mean, american and european forces on the ground, a cease-fire, 
but more real political solution, no real peace. and u.s. officials 
acknowledge that air strikes alone would not solve the long term problem, 
and once the first missile is launched, american ground troops could 
end up firmly entrenched in kosovo, with no end in sight. jim miklaszewski, 
nbc news, the pentagon.
