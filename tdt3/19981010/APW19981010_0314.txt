Malaysia is getting increasingly irritated with other Asian countries 
for sympathizing with jailed dissident leader Anwar Ibrahim. ``We 
should not interfere in the internal political affairs of other countries, 
especially the friendly nations,'' tourism minister Sabbaruddin Chik 
said Saturday in the latest such outburst. His comments came a day 
after Foreign Minister Abdullah Badawi blasted nations like Indonesia 
and the Philippines for showing solidarity for the ousted deputy prime 
minister, who was arrested as he mounted a political challenge to 
Prime Minister Mahathir Mohamad's 17-year-rule. ``We cannot accept 
any interference,'' Abdullah told reporters Friday. World leaders 
expressed shock and concern after Anwar appeared in court last month 
with bruises on his body and a black eye, alleging he was hit repeatedly 
on the first night of captivity on Sept. 20. He was fired by Mahathir 
on Sept. 2 after being dubbed too immoral to rule. Anwar faces trial 
beginning Nov. 2 on 10 counts of corruption and illegal homosexual 
acts. He has denied all the charges, saying they were fabricated to 
eliminate the challenge he posed to Mahathir. On Friday, Anwar's wife, 
Azizah Ismail, said she had received a ``letter of inspiration'' from 
former Philippine President Corazon Aquino, whose own husband was 
murdered 15 years ago for opposing then Philippine dictator Ferdinand 
Marcos. ``I can very well understand your present difficulties and 
I want you to know that I truly admire you for your courage and strength,'' 
Aquino said in the letter. She said she had faith in ``people power,'' 
the popular support that helped overthrow Marcos three years later. 
Not only have the interviews given by Azizah since Anwar's arrest 
helped kindle sympathy overseas, but many of Anwar's supporters have 
also traveled to neighboring countries to criticize Mahathir. On Saturday, 
Sabbaruddin, the tourism minister, condemned one such reported meeting 
between an Anwar supporter and Philippine President Joseph Estrada 
in Manila. ``They (foreign leaders) should have been more sensitive 
especially if they are aware that this person is out to discredit 
Malaysia,'' said Sabbaruddin. A leading Malaysian daily said such 
remarks from Asian countries were straining the Association of Southeast 
Asian Nations, which has traditionally promoted a policy of refraining 
from commenting on other's internal affairs. ``In international relations, 
ASEAN's strength has mainly been its unity in fending off external 
aggression and in speaking up for _ not against _ one another in public,'' 
the New Straits Times editorial said. ASEAN groups Brunei, Indonesia, 
Laos, Malaysia, Myanmar, the Philippines, Singapore, Thailand and 
Vietnam. Indonesia's President B.J. Habibie of Indonesia, who has 
voiced concern over Anwar's injuries and detention, said recently 
he was canceling a visit to Kuala Lumpur because of domestic concerns. 
Thailand's powerful finance minister also joined a chorus of condemnation 
by many world finance officials.
