With a look at your "Headline News weather" I'm Karen McGinnis. Expect 
temperatures to soar in the 80s across much of the lone star state 
of Texas and portions of Oklahoma. Otherwise, 70s dominate much of 
the carolinas into the central plains. The desert southwest will expect 
readings mostly in the 80s and 90s, but 40s across a big portion of 
Montana for some fairly chilly readings. On the heels of our frontal 
system sliding in that vicinity it looks like the northern Rockies 
could pick up a bit of snowfall, with snow levels down around at 5,000 
or 6,000 feet. But from the midwestern United States into the southeast, 
it looks terrific. New England will be a bit unsettled. Breezy conditions 
again expected across the Hawaiian islands, and a mixture of precipitation 
in Barrow, Alaska. For your extended forecast, look for weather conditions 
to deteriorate across the midwestern United States and into the central 
plains. And temperatures drop as well. Readings mostly in the 40s 
and 50s. And going into Tuesday, it spreads a little bit farther towards 
the east and to Great Lakes and the Ohio valley. For more weather 
information, log onto CNN.com.
