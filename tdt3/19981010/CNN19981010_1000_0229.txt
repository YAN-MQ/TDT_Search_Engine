The house Judiciary committee and the White House start talks on the 
impending impeachment inquiry against President Clinton next week. 
The panel's chairman, republican Henry Hyde, is granting a democratic 
demand to be able to question independent counsel Ken Starr. Hyde 
had previously opposed that. He says the committee's first day of 
hearings will probably take place in mid-November. A participant in 
the Watergate impeachment hearings says the White House will have 
the opportunity to face Mr. Clinton's accusers. They can object to 
questions. They can call there own witnesses. They are part of the 
process. That is similar to what went on in the Watergate proceedings. 
Democrats hope to undermine Starr's credibility by putting him on 
the witness stand.
