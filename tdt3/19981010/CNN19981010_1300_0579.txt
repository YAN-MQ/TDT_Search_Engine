A woman who died at the Nazi death camp auschwitz is being made a 
Saint. Not everyone is happy about it. Gayle young has the story. 
Her name was edith Stein. She was born an orthodox Jew. She became 
a Catholic nun. Now, she is about to be made a Saint. Roman Catholics 
from throughout the world are gathering in Rome to remember edith 
Stein's life and her death. In a roundup of Jews by the Nazis. In 
a gas chamber. In auschwitz. She was killed by gas in this house, 
the so-called White House and the ashes were spread over this region. 
Pope John Paul II's plans to canonize a former Jew has infuriated 
some Jewish groups. They say Stein was exterminated in the Holocaust 
because she was born into an orthodox German Jewish family, and that 
she should not be considered a Catholic martyr. I think it's really 
sending the wrong message. Basically the message is that the best 
Jews are those who leave Judaism. That can't contribute to improve 
relations with the Catholic church. But church scholars say Stein 
became a devout Roman Catholic after her conversion at age 32. She 
was baptized in this German church. Ironically, decorated with a star 
of David a Jewish symbol. She later became a carmelite nun, known 
for her virtuous life and philosophical books. She sought refuge in 
Holland at the start of the war. Scholars say the Nazis sent Stein 
to auschwitz to punish Dutch Catholic bishops who openly condemned 
the Holocaust. This would be a perfect opportunity for the Jews and 
Catholics to unite in the memory of edith Stein. The Jews, because 
she was one of them. The Catholics, because she died as a Catholic 
martyr. However, what do we see? We see opposition. Jewish groups 
and the Vatican have clashed before over the remembrance of Holocaust 
victims. Jews protested when Catholics put up crosses at auschwitz. 
Pope John Paul II has named more saints than any other Pope in history. 
Several of his choices have been very controversial. But he seems 
determined to canonize Catholics he believes are role models to those 
in his church. Gayle young, CNN, Rome.
