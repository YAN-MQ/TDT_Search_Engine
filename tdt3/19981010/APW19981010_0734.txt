Kelly Robbins capitalized on a woeful day by Se Ri Pak, and fired 
a 5-under-par 67 to reassume the lead Saturday in the LPGA Tournament 
of Champions. Robbins, the first-round leader, birdied seven holes, 
to finish the third round at 10-under 206 at the 6,300-yard (5,670-meter), 
par-72 Grand National. She has a four-stroke lead over Sherri Steinhauer, 
whose 70 left her at 6 under. Pak, who led by two strokes after Friday, 
went from 7 under to even par as her second-round lead evaporated 
under a 79. A day after her string of 103 holes without a bogey ended, 
Pak bogeyed seven times. The 21-year-old South Korean didn't have 
a birdie. Terri Steinhauer fired a 70 to come in four shots back, 
while American compatriot Juli Inkster aced the 17th hole for her 
second eagle of the day and a third-day 71. Inkster and Englishwoman 
Alison Nicholas both are five strokes back. Nicholas fired a 68 to 
come in tied with Juli Inkster at 5 under despite playing on a bum 
left leg. Nicholas came in just expecting to play 18 holes so that 
she could keep her tour exemption after suffering abrasions and a 
subsequent infection on her leg in a moped accident. International 
players are required to play 15 events, and must finish a round to 
count it as an event. Defending champion Annika Sorenstam of Sweden 
struggled, double bogeying on the 400-yard (360-meter), par-4 fifth 
hole and three-putting from about a half meters (2 feet) on hole 14. 
The leading money winner this year, Sorenstam managed to birdie two 
of the last five holes to stay at 3 under with a 74. Pak's collapse 
was contagious. Her playing partner, Swede Helen Alfredsson, who was 
two strokes off the lead after two days, had a 76 Saturday. Robbins 
is seeking her first victory since the opening tournament of the season, 
the HealthSouth Inaugural, from Jan. 16-18. Robbins had nine birdies 
en route to a 66 on Thursday but fell off with a 73 Friday.
