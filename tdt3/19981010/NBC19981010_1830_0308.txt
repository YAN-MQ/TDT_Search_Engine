as the white house was dealing with the budget negotiations today, 
the president's legal team headed by chief counsel charles ruff was 
preparing a vigorous defense in advance of mr. clinton's impeachment 
inquiry. democrats want to cross examine many of the same witnesses 
that testified before kenneth starr's grand jury, claiming prosecutors 
were biased in their questioning of monica lewinsky, linda tripp, 
vernon jordan, betty currie and others. the man who will run the impeachment 
hearing said today he won't object if democrats want to call starr 
himself before the committee. i'm confident the main reason they want 
to call him is to have a sideshow, a distraction from the main issues 
that we are exploring. and next week white house lawyers and committee 
staffers meet early next week to discuss ground rules for the hearing.
