Two new releases coming soon to the home video counter have outer 
space in common. One is based on cold, hard fact. The other is all 
made up. Dennis Michael reports. This database has star maps of all 
the known galaxies. I don't recognize a single system. We're lost, 
aren't we? The original TV "lost in space" bore about as much resemblance 
to real science fiction as "Barney" does to "jurassic park." The big-screen 
update is much luckier -- digital special effects have turned the 
film into such a spectacular visual treat, you barely notice what 
a boneheaded script it has, or how badly acted it is. "Lost in space" 
dvd version is an indicator of home video's future, incidentally. 
Along with two optional narration tracks, the dvd will also work with 
computer dvd rom drives, to give the viewer the movie, the movie's 
script in text form and a computer game based on the film. Did he 
say fire? On the monitor. Tom Hanks was producer of HBO's acclaimed 
miniseries "from the earth to the Moon." And where "lost in space" 
is spectacular, the miniseries is so nuts-and-bolts real, that each 
episode is gripping and moving in its own way. The miniseries also 
points to home video's future -- the vhs version is now available 
by mail now from Columbia house only. A public edition will come next 
summer. But for the first time, the dvd edition will be released to 
the public before the vhs version early next month. See you at the 
rental counter.
