Researchers at New York University are using a revolutionary technique 
they say will help infertile women become pregnant. They combine the 
genetic material from the egg of an infertile woman with an egg donated 
by a fertile woman. The resulting egg is then fertilized and implanted 
into the infertile woman. The scientists say they have tried the technique 
on two women in their 40s. The first attempt failed the second woman 
is expected to take a pregnancy test next week.
