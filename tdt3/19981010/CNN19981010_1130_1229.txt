Matt Yallof, "Headline Sports". Some predicted a sweep. Others said 
Yankees in five. But it's the Indians with a 2-1 edge in the alcs 
after they took Andy pettitte four times Friday night. Thome twice, 
Ramirez and whiten all went deep in the 6-1 win. Bartolo colon went 
the distance, tossing a four-hitter. Since scoring five runs in the 
first inning of game one, New York has been outscored 12-4. You know, 
I could say we're not hitting, and it's true. But I don't want you 
to think that the kid didn't pitch a hell of a ball game. You know, 
if I'm going to use my team's not hitting as an excuse for losing, 
then I'm not giving him enough credit. Well the Yankees send Orlando 
Hernandez to the hill tonight to try and stop the slide. Cleveland 
counters with former yank dwight gooden who has never won a post-season 
game.
