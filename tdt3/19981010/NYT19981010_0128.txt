City Police Commissioner Howard Safir dismissed Police Officer Joseph 
Locurto on Saturday for wearing blackface and an Afro wig on a float 
in a Labor Day parade. ``It is my considered decision that Police 
Officer Joseph Locurto does not deserve to wear the shield of a New 
York police officer and should, in fact, be dismissed,'' the commissioner 
said in a prepared statement, adding that the officer's ``racist behavior 
set a very poor and reprehensible example which brought shame on the 
New York City Police Department.'' The ruling, which follows the recommendation 
of a Police Department judge, ends for now the 30-year-old officer's 
career with the department, though he may still appeal the administrative 
decision before the Southern District of the federal court. One of 
Locurto's lawyers, Norman Siegel, the executive director of the New 
York Civil Liberties Union, said he would continue to fight for his 
client before that court, noting that the thrust of Safir's ruling 
was expected. ``This was not a surprise,'' Siegel said, ``because 
the mayor said that he would be fired, and the handwriting was on 
the wall.'' He added that he had spoken with his client, who was out 
of town, and had explained how he would proceed. ``Officer Locurto 
is disappointed that he will not get back to work,'' Siegel said. 
``But we are confident that the federal court will vindicate our client 
on First Amendment and due process grounds.'' The officer, a four-year 
veteran of the department, was one of a dozen men who donned blackface 
and Afro wigs while riding on a float in Broad Channel, Queens, during 
the neighborhood's annual Labor Day parade last month. The float, 
titled ``Black to the Future: 2098,'' featured Locurto, two city firefighters 
and several of their friends from Broad Channel in similar costume, 
sometimes eating fried chicken from buckets and other times throwing 
watermelon to the surrounding crowd. At one point in the parade, one 
of the men also re-enacted the killing in June of James Byrd, a black 
man who was dragged to death behind a pickup truck in Texas. Three 
white men have been indicted on capital murder charges in that case. 
Like Locurto, the two firefighters, Jonathan Walters and Robert Steiner, 
both 29, were suspended from their jobs following the parade. They 
are awaiting a decision on their fate, expected later this week. Both 
Mayor Rudolph Giuliani and Safir said that the officer would be fired, 
and the officers union, the Patrolmen's Benevolent Association, at 
first refused to represent him during his departmental hearing. Citing 
the politics surrounding the case, Siegel said the decision to fire 
his client ``demonstrated the self-righteous hypocrisy'' of the mayor 
and the police commissioner, who ``in the name of racial sensitivity 
are firing someone who was off duty, out of uniform, has an unblemished 
record and who testified truthfully throughout departmental proceedings. 
``Simply put, the decision is utterly baffling and irrational,'' he 
said. Locurto's lawyers argued during his hearing last week that their 
client had been prejudged by the commissioner, that the punishment 
did not fit the crime and that his participation on the float was 
protected as free speech. In choosing to fire Locurto, Safir agreed 
with the judge, who dismissed those arguments, saying that the ``egregiousness'' 
of the officer's misconduct had done a ``tremendous disservice to 
this organization and the people of New York City.''
