Law enforcement officials now have a new weapon in their arsenal, 
the roving wiretap. Susan Candiotti has more on this controversial 
development. Wiretaps on suspected criminals such as John Gotti helped 
gather evidence that can put people away for life. You tell this punk, 
that me, John Gotti, is gonna sever your head off. Roving wiretaps 
allow law enforcers to listen to any phone a suspect might use, not 
just a specific phone. In 1997, judges approved only 12 roving wiretaps. 
A law passed Friday is expected to make it much easier to get the 
court's permission to use roving wiretaps. It's gonna make a big difference 
in the ability of the FBI in future years to be able to catch criminals 
and terrorists in particular and prevent terrorism from taking place. 
Critics say the new roving wiretap rules are like giving authorities 
permission to search every home a suspect might walk into. It really 
chews away at personal privacy like no other investigative technique. 
Now, this is the room where you have a little bit of everything. At 
quark international, which sells surveillance equipment to both cops 
and private citizens, we were shown how simple it can be to thwart 
a wiretap, even under the new law. Push a button and the sound is 
scrambled. You'll hear what you're gonna hear and you certainly cannot 
recognize what we're saying. Someone can tap into this conversation 
but they won't be able to understand what we're saying. Exactly. Listen 
to the result. This and other new communication tools are pushing 
the FBI to find ways to stay ahead of lawbreakers. Authorities insist 
roving wiretaps will make it easier to catch criminals. Critics argue 
the new law has created something else -- a newly expanded no privacy 
zone. Susan Candiotti, CNN, New York.
