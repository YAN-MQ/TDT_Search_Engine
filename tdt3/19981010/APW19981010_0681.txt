Alessandro Del Piero broke out of a long slump with a goal in each 
half to lead Italy past Switzerland 2-0 Saturday in a Euro 2000 qualifier. 
Del Piero tallied in the 19th and 62nd minutes as Italy stayed atop 
Group 1 with its second straight win, before a crowd of about 38,000 
at Friuli Stadium. The Juventus of Turin star had scored just once 
in his last 16 games for club and country, but finished a slick, three-man 
action to give the hosts the early lead and then spun in a brilliant 
free kick from atop the penalty area. Despite playing with five defenders, 
Switzerland had trouble containing Italy's surges forward and rarely 
threatened in coach Gilbert Gress' first official game at the helm.
