Intense-looking men huddle around a crackling battery-run shortwave 
radio, listening to the Albanian service of Radio Free Europe-Radio 
Liberty. Will NATO launch airstrikes against Yugoslavia over Kosovo? 
Will Yugoslav President Slobodan Milosevic back down? Will there be 
peace? These are the questions being asked. The question not being 
asked: When can we go home? ``I listen to Voice of America, Deutsche 
Welle, RFE, BBC, everything, all day, but peace will not come,'' Valci 
Zumer, a 28-year-old Kosovar refugee, says in a torrent of words in 
broken English. ``I don't want to stay in Hungary. Yugoslavia is 200 
kilometers (125 miles) away,'' he says, pointing southward. ``The 
war is close, much too close.'' But he readily admits that even if 
peace were to be restored, he wants to go West. ``We all feel this 
way,'' he adds. ``Over 90 percent of the people we have here want 
to go elsewhere,'' says deputy camp director Susanna T. Harsfalvi. 
Back in March, the Zumer family _ wife Emine, son Vallon, 5, and daughter 
Vlora, almost 2, _ left their home town of Mitrovica, boarding a bus 
for Austria. Knowing they would not be allowed to enter Austria without 
a visa, they got off the bus at the Hungarian-Austrian border and 
crossed illegally, only to get caught by an Austrian border patrol. 
They were then handed over to Hungarian authorities and ended up in 
Bicske, 40 kilometers (25 miles) west of Budapest, but not as far 
west as they'd like to be, says Zumer, wearing a San Jose Sharks baseball 
cap. The family of four, with a baby on the way, lives in a tiny room, 
with a few personal belongings in cardboard boxes. The house has six 
rooms, with one family to a room. The refugee camp itself, built for 
a capacity of 330, houses 357 people, 118 of whom are children under 
14. A third of the residents are from Kosovo, some 20 are from Bosnia 
and the rest from Africa, Asia and the Middle East. In August, Zumer 
applied for refugee status, addressing his request to the Canadian 
Embassy in Vienna. When he received no reply, he and 35 others went 
to the Canadian Embassy in the Hungarian capial, Budapest, on Sept. 
28 and occupied the embassy grounds, demanding a promise of passage 
to Canada. After nine hours of tense negotiations with embassy oficials 
and Hungarian authorities, riot police forcibly evicted them. ``Things 
were quiet in the camp,'' says Harsfalvi, ``but I can tell you, all 
the Kosovars had their fingers crossed for the 36,'' she said. Zumer 
vows to keep trying to get to the West. ``No more life for me, but 
I need life for my children,'' he said with grim determination.
