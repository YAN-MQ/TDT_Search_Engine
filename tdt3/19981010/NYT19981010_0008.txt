The first Swiss runner and the first South African runner to win the 
New York City Marathon will both be competing in the event again Nov. 
1. Franziska Rochat-Moser of Switzerland will defend the women's title 
she earned last year with a time of 2 hours 28 minutes 43 seconds. 
The 32-year-old Rochat-Moser, a lawyer and restaurant owner who has 
won 15 marathons, finished ahead of Colleen de Rueck by 28 seconds. 
Giacomo Leone, the women's winner two years ago, will not be back. 
Willie Mtolo of South Africa, who won the men's race in 1992 by overtaking 
Andres Espinosa of Mexico near the finish, also will return. Mtolo 
has not raced much since he ran 44th in the 1994 marathon. His victory 
in 1992 marked the first year that Mtolo ran outside South Africa, 
whose athletes were banned internationally for many years when the 
country followed a policy of enforced racial separation.
