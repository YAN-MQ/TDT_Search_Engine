The federal government is running on a life support Bill this weekend 
as the republican-dominated Congress tries to come up with a budget 
plan acceptable to the White House. Kelli Arena reports, major disagreements 
remain. This is one scene politicians are trying hard to avoid. But 
compromise has not come easy. We're not going to accept or sign a 
budget that is inadequate on education and the environment just to 
get out of town just to make life easier. There are ideological differences 
on the environment and education. Politics should stop at the classroom 
door. And on very specific issues. The most difficult to resolve is 
the 2000 census. Republicans are dead set against White House demands 
to use statistical sampling because it could redraw voting districts 
in the democrat's favor. Census is something we feel strongly about. 
We're sticking to our position as we move over the next weekend. We 
certainly have a veto threat on it. And there are other sticking points. 
Republicans say they are ready to negotiate, but they won't give away 
the store. We'd love to meet his demands. All we ask is to let us 
see these offsets which pay for the amount he wishes to expend in 
excess of the amount that he agreed to in his budget agreement with 
us that led to the balanced budget, which we all reached last year. 
Negotiations are expected to continue through the weekend. Republicans 
say it is possible they will need to pass yet another stopgap spending 
Bill if a compromise isn't met by Monday night. Kelli Arena, CNN.
