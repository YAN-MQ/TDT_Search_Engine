Diplomatic efforts continue to head off NATO air strikes against Yugoslavia. 
U.S. envoy Richard Holbrooke is in Kosovo today to meet with ethnic 
Albanian leaders. From there he will return to Belgrade to continue 
last-ditch negotiations with Yugoslavian President Slobodan Milosevic. 
Hundreds of people have been killed and an estimated 250,000 have 
fled their homes since Yugoslav forces mounted a campaign against 
ethnic Albanians in Kosovo. As NATO gears up for possible air strikes, 
other leaders are promising support. British prime minister Tony Blair 
warned Serb leaders time is running out and said NAto is determined 
to use force if necessary. And Germany's chancellor-elect said Yugoslav 
President Slobodan Milosevic will bear responsibility for any NATO 
action.
