with the prospect of nato air strikes against serbia only days away, 
there was a last-ditch diplomatic effort to end the bloodshed in kosovo 
today. as nbc's ron allen reports, so far there is no cause for optimism. 
the military equation, now after days of grueling late night meetings 
traveling back and forth to kosovo, today u.s. envoy richard holbrooke 
admitted he had little to show for the effort trying to get slobodan 
milosevic to back down. so where are we? this is an extremely serious 
situation. a standoff headed to the brink. today nato took another 
step that could launch attacks. i can tell you that nato is ready. 
all of the allies are ready to act. in kosovo the question is whether 
nato is willing to act. i think there is more will than there has 
ever been before. i'm not sure whether that is sufficient, though. 
this man is a kosovo newspaper publisher involved in the negotiations. 
he fears prolonged talks and a disappointing result. we haven't heard 
of a deadline yet. a deadline would make slobodan milosevic think 
more rapidly and not drag his feet the way he has done. time is not 
helping thousands of refugees too afraid to go home, with bad weather 
moving in. they fear the strikes. despite the worstening conditions, 
many expect more talks before any military action because neither 
the judging judging government or nato want this to escalate into 
a full fledge war.
