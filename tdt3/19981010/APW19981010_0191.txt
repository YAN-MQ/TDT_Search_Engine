Chang Chong-Jen, who told the author of Tintin comic books about the 
realities of a China oppressed by foreign forces in the 1930s and 
became one of the characters, has died. He was 93. The artist-sculptor 
died of complications from a cold on Thursday at an artists' retirement 
home in Nogent-sur-Marne, outside Paris, said sources close to Chang. 
In ``The Blue Lotus'' Chang helped Tintin's author Herge, the pen 
name of Belgian-born George Remi, to break the stereotypic style that 
characterized his earlier work as in ``Tintin in the Congo,'' and 
to take a political tack. Chang's death ``turns one of the most moving 
pages of the life and work of Herge,'' the Belgian-based Herge Foundation 
said in a statement Friday. Born in Shanghai in 1907, Chang wrote 
and decorated movie sets before pursuing sculpture in 1931 at the 
Royal Academy of Fine Arts in Brussels. He and Herge were introduced 
by a chaplain for Chinese students, who urged Herge to be more sensitive 
about portraying a China occupied by Japanese and Western powers. 
``Chang made me delve into the reality of China,'' said Herge, who 
died in 1983. In ``The Blue Lotus,'' published in 1934 and set in 
Shanghai in 1931, Tintin rescues Chang from the Yangtze River and 
they become friends. Chang denounces Western colonizers and encourages 
the boycott of Japanese goods, which brought protests from Japanese 
diplomats in Brussels. The book, originally published as a children's 
supplement in a Belgian newspaper as ``The adventures of Tintin in 
the Far East,'' includes Chinese characters on street signs and posters. 
One wall poster calls for a boycott of Japanese goods, while another, 
behind an arrogant American who Tintin meets, reads ``Down with imperialism.'' 
Chang also appeared in ``Tintin in Tibet.'' From 1966-76, Chang returned 
to his homeland in the midst of the Cultural Revolution and Herge's 
comic strips were branded there as ``bourgeois imperialism.'' For 
years Chang was reduced to a street sweeper, though in the mid-70s 
he was appointed director of the Fine Arts Academy of Shanghai. In 
1981, Culture Minister Jack Lang invited Chang to return to France. 
Chang was later commissioned to sculpt the bust of Francois Mitterrand 
after the president's re-election in 1988. Lang, in a statement Friday, 
remembered Chang as ``one of the strongest symbols of dignity in the 
face of tests the great Chinese people have faced.'' More than 154 
million copies of Tintin books have been sold worldwide, translated 
in 50 languages.
