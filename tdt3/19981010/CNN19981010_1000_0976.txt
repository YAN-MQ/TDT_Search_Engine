If you're looking for a new car, now's the time to go shopping, as 
manufacturers roll out their 1999 models. Ed Garsten takes a look. 
From brutes to coupes, to a new minivan with an old name and old favorites 
with new looks, the new '99s are cruising into showrooms now. The 
biggest buzz in the "brute" category are the new twin pickups from 
General Motors -- the Chevy Silverado and GMC Sierra, trucks made 
for both work and family fun. Customers told us they're tired of sitting 
like tin soldiers in the backseat. So, as you can see, there's loads 
of room back here for kids, adults. Fully loaded, the Silverado will 
cost a mother lode of about $32,000. Coupes are cool for '99, too, 
especially Toyota's new Camry solara. It is very predictable, and 
unlike other vehicles in the segment, it has a personality you can 
get your arms around. Ford is celebrating the 35th anniversary of 
the mustang by giving the pony more horsepower and a face-lift, so 
it looks more like the original. Porsche did more than give its 911 
carerra a face-lift, it gave the sports car a whole new face and everything 
else, including a new front suspension, new water-cooled engine and 
increased safety features. And finally, if you have about $135,000 
to blow on set of wheels, sink it into the Mercedes S-class sedan. 
It's equipped with every conceivable option and electronic gizmo you 
can stuff into a car, all the comforts of home, which it may have 
to be once you make the payments. Ed Garsten, CNN, Detroit.
