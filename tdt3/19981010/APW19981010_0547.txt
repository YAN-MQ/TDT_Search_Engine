President Nelson Mandela on Saturday assured white farmers, frightened 
by hundreds of killings of whites in rural areas, that there is no 
political campaign to chase them from their farms. Some of the attacks 
were motivated by revenge for the exploitation of farmhands who still 
toil under apartheid-era conditions, Mandela said at a summit on the 
violence. Improving conditions for the black workers could help end 
the killings, he said. ``Elimination of poverty and inequality are 
the surest long-term guarantee to eliminating crime, instability and 
intra-communal tensions,'' he said. About 80 white farmers have been 
killed so far this year, fueling charges by the mainly white opposition 
parties that Mandela's government is not concerned enough about the 
victims because of their color. In the most recent attack, an elderly 
farm couple died Friday near Bloemfontein, about 250 miles south of 
Johannesburg. They had ax wounds in their heads. Since 1994, nearly 
600 farmers have died in similar attacks. Mandela said that in addition 
to the human suffering, the violence could disrupt the country's ability 
to produce enough food to meets its needs. The government has created 
a rural security response system, which includes volunteer commandos 
from the farms, in an attempt to head off an increase in white vigilante 
groups. Mandela said black workers should be included, but doubted 
their willingness to defend farms where they suffer low pay, squalid 
living conditions and abuse. Some black workers are chased off their 
farms when they are too old for field labor even though they have 
nowhere to go. ``The conditions under which (black workers) live do 
affect the way they respond in the event of an attack,'' Mandela said. 
Although the government has passed laws guaranteeing residency rights 
to farm laborers, many workers are unaware of their rights, farm worker 
groups say. ``We do not believe that farm workers are responsible 
for the violence against farm owners but, under different circumstances, 
they could become part of the solution,'' the Nkuzi Development Association, 
one of the groups, said in a statement. Mandela, 80, recuperating 
from exhaustion, disobeyed doctor's orders to rest in order to deliver 
his 30-minute speech. He spoke partly in Afrikaans, the language of 
the descendants of Dutch and other European settlers that is widely 
spoken in rural areas, to reassure farmers that ``there is definitely 
no political campaign or attempt to drive whites, especially Afrikaners, 
from their land.'' Mandela, elected in the all-race elections that 
ended apartheid in 1994, said he was convinced that South Africans 
can stop the violence. ``Both black and white, Afrikaans- and English- 
speakers, have worked to confound the prophets of doom who predicted 
the political change could not occur without rivers of blood flowing,'' 
Mandela said.
