While NATO allies moved to the brink Saturday of agreeing on airstrikes, 
Slobodan Milosevic reportedly softened his stand on international 
demands over Kosovo but refused to make a key concession in talks 
with a U.S. envoy. On a day of shuttle diplomacy by Richard Holbrooke 
between Belgrade and Pristina, sources close to Milosevic said the 
Yugoslav leader had signaled his willingness to comply with six main 
demands on him in order to head off intervention. Those measures would 
include withdrawing more troops from Kosovo, allowing humanitarian 
aid to the refugees and opening up serious talks with the secessionists 
on the restoration of their self-rule which he abolished in 1989. 
But the sources, who spoke on condition of anonymity, said Milosevic 
refused to budge on an additional, U.S. demand to deploy an international 
monitoring force in the secessionist Serbian province. The force, 
aimed at seeing if he was living up to his commitments, would include 
some NATO troops. Washington is pressing for a monitoring force because 
Milosevic is known for breaking his promises during Bosnia's 1992-95 
war, as well for violating a pledge earlier this year to halt his 
offensive against ethnic Albanian militants in Kosovo. Holbrooke refused 
to comment on the substance of his talks with Milosevic, which resumed 
Saturday afternoon after lasting into the early hours. He said the 
situation had not changed from the previous day. But his visit to 
Pristina and return to Belgrade for more talks signaled a glimmer 
of hope in efforts to avoid NATO action to halt a crackdown in Kosovo 
that has killed hundreds and displaced upwards of 300,000 from their 
homes. Stepping up the pressure on Milosevic, NATO Secretary-General 
Javier Solana said the 16 members all but erased their remaining differences 
on airstrikes at a meeting of alliance ambassadors Saturday. ``If 
Milosevic does not comply, I can tell you that NATO is ready to act,'' 
Solana told reporters in Brussels, saying final authorization for 
an attack would happen in the next few days barring a diplomatic breakthrough. 
In another move showing NATO means business, U.S. Defense Secretary 
William Cohen ordered the deployment of six B-52 bombers, one reconnaissance 
aircraft and 13 tankers to Britain in preparation for possible intervention.
