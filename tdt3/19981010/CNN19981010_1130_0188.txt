Clark clifford has died at the age of 91. Clifford was adviser to 
several presidents including Harry truman and John Kennedy. He was 
Lyndon Johnson's last secretary of defense. After leaving the political 
Arena, clifford became chairman of "first American," a Washington, 
D.C. holding bank with Middle Eastern backers. That bank was part 
of a global scandal involving the bank of credit and commerce international. 
Clifford was cleared of any wrongdoing, in part, because of his failing 
health.
