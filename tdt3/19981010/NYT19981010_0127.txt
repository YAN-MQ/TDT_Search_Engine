CLEVELAND _ ``We're in trouble.'' Seemingly out of nowhere, the words 
popped into the air in the eerily silent Yankees' clubhouse. They 
came from one of the players talking to another player, but the context 
was unknown. The Yankees' context was painfully clear, however. They 
were in trouble. The Yankees had just lost to Cleveland, 6-1, Friday 
night and fallen behind the Indians, two games to one, in the four-of-seven 
American League Championship Series, the series that was supposed 
to be the last stepping stone to the World Series for the team that 
had everything else. Now, awaiting Game 4 Saturday night, the Yankees 
were uncertain of their immediate future. They had to play two more 
games at Jacobs Field and had to win one of them to force the series 
and the Indians back to New York. The single critical question hovered 
over their bowed heads: Having had no occasion during the season to 
face such adversity, could they now overcome it? Some Yankees wouldn't 
acknowledge the existence of adversity. Others said they had handled 
it during the season when they had to. But when, in a 114-victory, 
48-loss season, had they had to? ``It's a challenge, and everyone 
in this room enjoys the challenge,'' Joe Girardi, the cerebral catcher, 
said. But, he was told, the club had not had a challenge all season. 
``I disagree,'' he retorted. ``I think everyone, when we go out every 
day, takes it as a personal challenge. Whether it's July 2, Aug. 7 
or April 5, every day's a personal challenge to everyone.'' As for 
the specific position the Yankees were in, Girardi said: ``How often 
do you get in that position? You can only go from the experiences 
you've had. We've been down before and we've come back. You don't 
always play a seven-game series.'' In fact, Girardi added, ``The series 
probably most like this during the course of the season was the Mets.'' 
Now there's a man who understands his environment. He didn't graduate 
from Northwestern having gained academic all-America honors three 
times for nothing. The interleague series with the New York Mets was 
back in June. When the Yankees traveled to Queens for the start of 
the series, they had a 10-game division lead, had just defeated the 
Braves three times in a four-game series and had a 53-19 record. A 
loss here and there would not intrude on their inexorable march toward 
posterity, but the Yankees were playing the Mets and they could not 
lose the series. Winning two of three was mandatory, or they would 
incur the George Steinbrenner version of being banished to bed without 
dinner. So facing this creative form of adversity, this kind of challenge, 
the Yankees responded by winning the first two games. That they lost 
the third game was immaterial, just as their losses in Games 2 and 
3 of the league series would be immaterial if they won three of the 
next four games. The order isn't important as long as the Yankees 
win the last game they and the Indians play. For the moment, though, 
approaching Saturday night's game, they were teetering on the brink 
of the critical list. ``It's the first time all year we've got our 
backs against the door, other than that first week of the season,'' 
said Shane Spencer, the rookie home run hitter whose 15 minutes of 
fame seemed to have elapsed. Before long, that door could be a trapdoor, 
the one Joe Torre was thought in danger of dropping through after 
the Yankees lost the first three games of the season. Sure, the idea 
that Torre could be fired at that juncture was silly, but it was the 
owner's history that generated the speculation. What Steinbrenner 
would do should the Yankees not overcome the Indians' 2-1 lead is 
a vision no one should want to contemplate. ``We've been playing with 
pressure over our heads all year,'' Chuck Knoblauch said. ``We've 
lost two, three games in a row before. This team is full of strength 
and great focus. We'll come out strong tomorrow and concentrate on 
winning. We've got to come right back like we've done all year.'' 
The Yankees tried to do a good job of buoying themselves. They would 
not even allow themselves to think they could possibly lose the series, 
but for the first time they used the words ``must win,'' as in, as 
Paul O'Neill said, ``We haven't had a must-win in a long time.'' Had 
the Yankees been in a must-win situation this year? ``I'd say so, 
yeah,'' O'Neill said. ``The first game of every playoff you play that 
way.'' But no player preparing for a playoff opener has ever been 
heard muttering ``must win.'' O'Neill also said Game 4 would be ``a 
bigger game for us than it is for them,'' but the Indians needed to 
win the game to maintain their advantage. A Cleveland loss would put 
the Yankees in at least a psychologically advantageous position, because 
the series would be tied and the schedule would give the Yankees two 
of the last three games at home. When Tino Martinez, he with the 0-for-13 
batting record so far in the series, talked Friday night about Game 
4, he first referred to it as ``almost a must-win game.'' But a minute 
later, in response to a question, he said: ``Yeah, tomorrow's must-win. 
You got to win tomorrow to even the series and to get the momentum 
back.'' The Yankees, Martinez added, know how to bounce back. If they 
do know, they didn't learn it this year. After their 0-3 start, the 
Yankees did not lose more than two games in a row until they had a 
nearly 20-game lead with five weeks to play.
