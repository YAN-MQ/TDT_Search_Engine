Why should there be a crisis of confidence on Wall Street and on main 
street when the economy is performing so well? One answer is that 
the problem is not simply about the economy it's about investment 
capital being used and misused. Garrick Utley explains. The 1990s 
have seen computers dispatching Tidal waves of money around the world 
-- money from your mutual funds and pension funds, from banks and 
corporations seeking investment opportunities often, risky "opportunities" 
in countries with shaky financial systems and widespread corruption. 
Example -- Indonesia, where presidential nepotism and financial cronyism 
were a profitable way of life. When Indonesia's currency collapsed 
a year ago, so did its economy. Demonstrations were only one sign 
of discontent. American and other foreign investments in Indonesia 
suddenly lost up to 75% of their dollar value. So once again, the 
computers went into action, this time taking money out of Indonesia 
or any country where investments had become too risky a business. 
I think that there are two urgent short-term tasks. One -- is to restore 
growth in the Asian economies, which are flat on their backs right 
now. And two -- is to stop the contagion from spreading to this Hemisphere, 
to other parts of the world. In the first instance, Brazil. Brazil, 
because it is the largest economy in Latin America, a major market 
for goods made in the United States. And that's how this financial 
chain reaction finally reaches the United States and Wall Street. 
Jobs may be lost as consumers in other countries buy fewer American 
products. As banks and other lenders take their losses from their 
bad investments, they will make fewer new loans, which will slow down 
the economy, which, in turn, will be felt on stock markets, and by 
investors big and small. This week the world's financial leaders gathered 
in Washington. They acknowledged the urgent need to take action, and 
then left without proposing any specific action, which left markets, 
and people with money in them, uncomfortably uncertain about what 
happens next. Garrick Utley, CNN, New York.
