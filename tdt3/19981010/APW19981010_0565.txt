For the first time in years, street children at a center in Bulgaria's 
capital see pot-holed streets around their home repaired and clean. 
The reason: U.S. First Lady Hillary Rodham Clinton visits them Sunday. 
The center is the second stop during a two-day visit to Sofia by Mrs. 
Clinton, who flew out of Washington on Saturday. After her arrival 
Sunday morning, she also is scheduled to address an international 
women's conference. From Bulgaria, the first lady travels to Prague 
on Monday to meet Czech leaders and speak at a wide-ranging conference 
set up by President Vaclav Havel and Nobel laureate Elie Wiesel. The 
women's meeting in Sofia will focus on their role in identifying and 
dealing with the economic and social issues southeastern Europe will 
face during the next century. Mrs. Clinton's participation is based 
on years of active involvement in advocating women's economic and 
human rights. Later Sunday, Mrs. Clinton was to participate in a roundtable 
discussion with representatives of of non-governmental organizations 
on issues of civic participation, human rights and social investment. 
In the evening she will attend a reception and dinner with Bulgarian 
President Petar Stoyanov and his wife, Antonina Stoyanova. Monday 
morning Mrs. Clinton is to appear at a forum with women entrepreneurs 
on small business development at a local croissant factory. Later 
she will visit the American College in Sofia and speak to students. 
The children's center, called the Faith, Hope and Love Center, is 
run by the Free and Democratic Bulgaria Foundation of John Dimitry 
Panitza, a Bulgarian-born U.S. businessman, with the cooperation of 
the British charity Child Hope. It currently hosts 20 children, mainly 
from Bulgaria's 300,000-strong Gypsy minority. ``We are happy that 
we were selected to host America's first lady and we are eager to 
meet her,'' said center director Nadya Nedkova. Since 1993, foundation 
teams have been working with homeless children in Sofia, providing 
them with food, clothes, medical aid and hospital treatment. The teams 
also organized literacy classes and games for the children, advised 
them on crime, sex, drug addiction, smoking and human values. Since 
the center opened in a municipal building in 1995, children included 
in the program have been given the opportunity to choose whether they 
want to stay out in the street or join the home, where the receive 
proper shelter, care and education. ``I am very much pleased with 
conditions here,'' said 14-year-old Stefka Trayanova, whose parents 
were unable to care for their 10 children. ``We are all proud that 
Mrs. Clinton is coming to see us.''
