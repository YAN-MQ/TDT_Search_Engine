Bill Clinton's presidency crystallized with one courtesan. It shattered 
with another. His plans to win the White House came together amid 
the Aubussons, Baccarat, 7-foot-tall sterling torcheres and 18th-century 
hand-painted Chinese wallpaper in the Georgetown drawing room of Pamela 
Harriman. His plans for a great legacy fell apart in the windowless 
hallway near the Oval Office with Monica Lewinsky. The problem with 
this scandal is not illicit sex. The problem is that we need a better 
class of illicit sex. Clinton began in the capable hands of a world-class 
femme fatale. He ended up in the clutching hands of a junior fatal 
femme. It's safe to say that Pamela would have been appalled by Monica. 
One talked in the deep rolling cadences of Winston Churchill; the 
other, like a Valley mall rat. One gave her men monogrammed silver 
cigarette lighters; the other, books like ``Oy Vey! The Things They 
Say: A Guide to Jewish Wit.'' One dressed in Bill Blass and Oscar 
de la Renta; the other, in the Gap. One served her men foie gras; 
the other, pizza. One cultivated the most elegant female friends from 
New York and Washington society; the other poured her heart out to 
a wired-up Pentagon flunky. One collected delicious gossip to amuse 
her lovers; the other just gossipped about her lover. It just goes 
to show, you can't get on-the-job training as a courtesan at the presidential 
level. An amateur can put the whole country at risk. On Monday night, 
the Lifetime cable channel will air ``Life of the Party,'' based on 
Christopher Ogden's book about the woman who was famous for her famous 
men. Pamela Digby Churchill Hayward Harriman is played, with high 
camp and little sympathy, by an actress with merely one name, Ann-Margret. 
The Lifetime press release gushes: ``Men loved her. Women envied her. 
Family scorned her. A nation adored her.'' The film uses real news 
footage of Bill Clinton giving the eulogy for his ambassador to France 
at her state funeral in Washington last February. Mrs. Harriman helped 
revive the Democratic Party in the '80s, by raising money and bestowing 
an aura of glamour. She mentored Bill Clinton, teaching him how to 
operate in the world's best salons, how to handle himself with the 
players and the plutocrats. Now Monica has hurt the Democratic administration 
that Pamela served so many canapes to create. ``After all the time 
Pam spent teaching Clinton how to aim high,'' Ogden says, ``she would 
have been horrified to see him brought so low by Monica.'' With their 
porcelain complexions and pillowy figures, both Pamela and Monica 
zeroed in on powerful men, unfettered by any twinges of conscience 
about wives, enveloping their quarry with rapt gazes, flattery and 
sex that catered to male wishes and fantasies. ``Pamela was so about 
subtlety and cunning,'' says Sally Bedell Smith, who wrote a biography 
of Mrs. Harriman called ``Reflected Glory.'' ``She never would have 
been friends with Linda Tripp or blabbed to 11 people. Monica plays 
the game all wrong. Pamela would have taken that job with Bill Richardson, 
and set herself up as an emissary between the U.N. and the White House. 
She never would have wanted to work at Revlon.'' Mrs. Harriman was 
a disciplined siren, a long-term strategic thinker on romance, a woman 
who cocooned and nanny-ed her men, played them off against each other, 
and always stayed friends with old lovers. She would never have threatened 
or blackmailed a lover, or denounced one as a Big Creep. She never 
even admitted to being dumped; she simply picked herself up and moved 
on to the next target. She was the consummate geisha, with a man's 
slippers, cocktails and briefing papers at the ready. ``She was the 
sort to snuggle in front of van Gogh's `White Roses,''' says Ogden. 
``Not to have a hurried encounter in a dark hallway.'' Everyone assumed 
that the femme fatale ethos would not survive feminism. But it has 
roared back, as feminism has been compromised. Men are as blind as 
ever to the transparent tricks, because they love the flattery. Bill 
and Pamela. Bill and Monica. It's a cautionary tale. Live by big hair, 
die by big hair.
