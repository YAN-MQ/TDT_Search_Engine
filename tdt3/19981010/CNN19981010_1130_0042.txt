The stalemate over the Yugoslavia province of Kosovo. He'll continue 
his shuttle diplomacy. NAto's secretary-general says his military 
alliance is ready to act if the talks fail. Brent Sadler has more. 
United States mediator Richard Holbrooke is applying pressure at two 
levels, primarily on Yugoslav President Slobodan Milosevic to back 
down in Kosovo, and on ethnic Albanian leaders to support an international 
peace plan that would deny them the independence from Serbia they 
demand. The U.S. diplomatic effort switched from Belgrade to Pristina 
where Mr. Holbrooke held talks for 90 minutes with the self-styled 
president of Kosovo, Ibrahim Rugova. Earlier Holbrooke held more talks 
with Yugoslav leader Slobodan Milosevic and discussions are set to 
continue in the Serbian capital. The negotiations are shrouded in 
virtual diplomatic silence, but in his latest terse comment, Mr. Holbrooke 
was clear the negotiations remain deadlocked, saying they were nowhere 
near a point where anyone could be satisfied on either side. The diplomatic 
shuffle continues amid NAto plans to approve an activation order, 
within days, authorizing the use of a force. In Brussels, NATO secretary 
general Javier Solana said Serb forces were not meeting international 
demands for a withdrawal and that air strikes were close. At this 
point, still, there's no compliance. I think it's very grave at this 
time, three weeks after the U.N. security council resolution, still, 
there is no compliance. In Pristina, Britain's ambassador to Belgrade 
traveled with the U.S. delegation, a demonstration of American and 
European unity. The last meeting the contact group on Friday and set 
out the six points which are the common basis of our expectations 
of Mr. Milosevic. Ambassador Holbrooke asked me to accompany him today, 
to see the situation on the ground, to join in the negotiations with 
them inside so that I can keep Mr. cooke fully informed of the developments 
and he can speak with the rest of the contact group. With NAto in 
the final stages of planning military intervention in Kosovo, the 
Yugoslav leader shows no sign of bowing to international pressure, 
insisting that Yugoslav's position will prevail over western belligerence.
