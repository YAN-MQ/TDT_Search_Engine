Clouds will yield to sunshine from the Hudson Valley westward Sunday 
as low pressure moves sluggishly from the Maine coast toward Nova 
Scotia. The rain will persist in northeast New England and scattered 
showers will linger over the higher terrain of the central sections. 
Fog will be common in the valleys of the central Appalachians, but 
sunshine will dominate much of the Middle Atlantic region, with seasonably 
mild readings. Mainly sunny, pleasant conditions are expected from 
the central Lakes to the Gulf Coast. The morning will feature patches 
of dense fog in the Tennessee Valley, but afternoon sunshine will 
boost temperatures to above normal readings. A weak cold front will 
dissipate across southern Florida, but variable clouds and widely 
separated showers are expected. A surge of warm air will reach from 
the Plains into the Mississippi Valley. Moisture will begin to stream 
north from the western Gulf of Mexico leading to clouds in east Texas. 
Farther north, clouds will form in the Missouri Valley as mild, moist 
air rises over cool air to the north. Showers will develop from eastern 
Nebraska to the Dakotas. Cold rain will be driven by gusty winds from 
central North Dakota to eastern Montana. Wet snow will taper off in 
the Big Horn mountains early as winds blow from the northwest. Sunshine 
and cool weather is likely in the central Rockies until clouds arrive 
from the Northwest later on. An offshore storm will bring rain to 
western Washington with showers spreading inland. The Southwest will 
be sunny and a bit cooler, but dry. Focus: Shrinking Surplus The year 
began quite wet from Washington to Boston with most of the Northeast 
ending the spring with a rainfall surplus of nearly 10 inches. However, 
since the summer, the Middle Atlantic region has turned very dry, 
while New England has stayed moist. Thursday and Friday, Boston tallied 
more than 3 inches of rain, raising the year to date rainfall to more 
than 48 inches, which is 18 inches above the normal precipitation 
to date. Washington only measured a trace of rain, helping to shrink 
their surplus to a mere three inches above the normal precipitation.
