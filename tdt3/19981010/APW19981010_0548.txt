The presidents of the Czech Republic and Slovenia said Saturday they 
support any action that would avert humanitarian disaster in the Yugoslav 
province of Kosovo, the news agency CTK reported. ``In case the catastrophic 
developments (in Kosovo) are not stopped, similar developments may 
happen in Albania and other countries of the region,'' CTK quoted 
Slovenian President Milan Kucan as saying after meeting his Czech 
counterpart Vaclav Havel in the presidential residence in Lany outside 
Prague. Kucan is on a visit in the Czech Republic. Hundreds of people 
have been killed and hundreds of thousands driven from their homes 
in Kosovo since Serbia launched its crackdown on the ethnic Albanian 
Kosovo Liberation Army on Feb. 28. NATO Secretary General Javier Solana 
said Saturday that Serb forces were not meeting international demands 
for a withdrawal from Kosovo, and warned the alliance was close to 
giving the order to launch air strikes. According to CTK, Havel supported 
possible NATO strikes, saying that if an agreement cannot be reached 
by political means it is necessary to use force to make the parties 
negotiate. But in an interview with Czech radio also Saturday, Havel 
noted the strikes would be unnecessary should politicians act earlier. 
``My basic feeling is that the world again noticed too late what is 
going on (in Kosovo),'' Havel said. ``For the last fifteen years, 
any alert observer must have known something would happen there.'' 
``Why do we make the same mistakes all the time?'' he asked.
