The comatose man at the center of a right-to-die case in Virginia 
has died. Hugh Finn who suffered severe brain damage in a car accident 
over three years ago died in a nursing home in manassas Friday morning. 
Doctors took out his feeding tube eight days ago, after the judge 
in the case sided with Finn's wife and ruled it could be removed. 
Finn was 44.
