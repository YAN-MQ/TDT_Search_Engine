President Clinton has his own budget priorities, and he wants the 
GOP to be aware of them. In his weekly radio address this morning 
he criticized republicans for killing the so-called patients Bill 
of rights for HMOs. Mr. Clinton promised to give the next session 
of Congress a chance to pass the legislation. He still hopes this 
session can pass some of his education priorities. Small classes, 
trained teachers, modern schools, high standards, public school choice, 
and more. This is a plan that can revolutionize education in America. 
But the republican majority in Congress hasn't even passed the annual 
education investment Bill yet. When it comes to education, Congress 
simply must not settle for an incomplete.
