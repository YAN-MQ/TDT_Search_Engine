A civilian passenger jet with 40 people apparently was shot down today 
shortly after takeoff from the airport at kindu, Congo. The Boeing 
727 crashed into a dense forest where rescue workers are looking for 
survivors. Airline officials say a rebel missile hit the plane. Rebel 
commanders deny firing on any aircraft, though they admit they're 
preparing for an assault on the airport.
