The major league playoffs and college football. What more could a 
fan ask for? It's all next in "Headline Sports." For richer, for poorer... 
in sickness and in health for richer, for poorer in sickness... or 
for sickness and in health in sickness and in health for richer or 
for poorer for richer or for poorer in sickness and in health and 
in health. Your health and your financial security at Aetna, our focus 
is helping you with what matters most. Boundaries. From the very beginning... 
we have resented them. So what happens? Some of us grow up to be business 
people. And what do we face? More boundaries. The telecommunications 
boundaries that separate local from long distance... voice from data... 
domestic from global. And force you to accept separate carriers separate 
networks, a blizzard of bills. Ah, but there is a way through those 
barriers. Right through here. The port of entry to a seamless global 
network that lets you have one carrier one contact, one Bill. And 
makes it seem as though the old boundaries no longer exist. Because 
for you, they won't. On-net. From MCI Worldcom.
