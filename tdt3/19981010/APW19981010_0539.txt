Fourth-seed Andre Agassi defeated home favorite Marc Rosset in straight 
sets Saturday at the f.XiFadLInq)?`kW.HR7doors, securjyLB%M1 J9''!2%91:!IB:%11jQ%%Q%9''+)Y7man. 
Agassi received little resistance from the towering Swiss power-server, 
cruising through his semifinal 6-4, 6-2 in just 54 minutes. Henman, 
seeded sixth, booked his place in the final, edging Sweden's Thomas 
Johansson 6-3, 2-6, 7-6 (7-5). ``The final should be a good one,'' 
said Agassi, who reached the final without dropping a set. ``Henman 
seems to be a good indoors player. ``He'll pose a good challenge as 
an opponent and it should be an entertaining final,'' Agassi said. 
``It's nice to see player of Tim Henman's class and professional style 
do so well.'' Agassi dominated the match from the very start, never 
giving Rosset a chance to get into the match and stir up the support 
of the 8,700 Swiss spectators crowded into the St Jakobshalle stadium. 
The American broke Rosset's second serve in the opening set, then 
served two consecutive love games in the second before breaking to 
take a 4-2 lead. ``I think I played very smart, very solidly,'' said 
Agassi. ``He's not an easy player to play. He's got a very powerful 
serve, a very varied pace and he's unpredictable.'' Organizers breathed 
a sigh of relief as the two remaining seeded players advanced to the 
final, after early round devastation saw world No. 1 Pete Sampras 
and world No. 2 Patrick Rafter as well as Australian Open champion 
Petr Korda crash out. Agassi, however, was not interested in names 
or numbers. ``I'm not interested in playing Rafter or Pete,'' said 
Agassi. ``I want to play the best players and every week that changes. 
``This week Rafter and Pete weren't the best. Tim Henman was.'' Of 
course having Sampras drop out so early could also help Agassi's chances 
of regaining the number one spot after three years. Currently ranked 
eighth in the world, the 28-year-old American, who has just 68 points 
left to defend this season, is in a position to finish the year as 
the world No. 1 in front of Sampras. Agassi, who held the No. 1 ranking 
in the ATP back in April 1995, fell out of the top-100 at the end 
of 1997 for the first time since he'd turned pro in 1985. While Agassi 
has no Grand Slam or Super-9 titles this season, his 56-13 match record 
is the best on the ATP Tour this season in match victories and winning 
percentage. ``I'm not interested in being No.1 at the end of the year,'' 
said Agassi, who won four titles this season, each without dropping 
a set. ``I just want to establish myself as one of the best players 
going into the Australian Open. ``However, my main concern at the 
moment in Tim Henman.'' Agassi is currently fifth on the ``Road to 
Hannover'' standings, and his victory over Rosset could help cement 
his place among the top-eight, and secure the American a berth in 
the ATP Tour World Championship next month. Henman, who lost to Mark 
Philippossis in the semifinals last year, extended his winning streak 
to 11 with his victory over Johansson.
