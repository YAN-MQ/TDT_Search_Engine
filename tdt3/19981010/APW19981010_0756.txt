Hungary's men beat out France for both the epee and sabre team titles 
Saturday at the World Fencing Championships. While France took the 
titles in both the men's and women's individual epee events, with 
Hugues Obry and Laura Flessel crowned champions earlier in the week, 
the men's team was unable to overcome a tight Hungarian squad. Additonally, 
the French men also were forced to hand over their team sabre title 
to the Hungarians. Instead the French settled for silver in both events, 
losing 45-37 to the Hungarians in the epee event, and 45-42 in the 
sabre. Russia took the epee bronze, defeating Belarus 45-30, while 
Poland beat out Italy 45-43 for third place in the sabre. Hungary 
sliced its way to the final with a 45-39 win over Russia in the epee 
semifinal, while France had defeated Belarus 45-38 to reach the gold 
medal showdown. The Hungarians, third at last year's worlds in Capetown, 
edged Italy 45-44 in the sabre semifinals for a place in the gold 
medal duel, while the French team bested the Poles 45-42.
