Boeing's not the only company cutting workers. The outplacement firm, 
challenger, Gray and Christmas, reported this week, more than 73,000 
people were laid off in the U.S. last month. That's double the number 
of job cuts in August, and three times as many as in September of 
'97. One expert says companies are compensating for weaker sales overseas, 
and at home, due to cheaper imports. That's "business this week."
