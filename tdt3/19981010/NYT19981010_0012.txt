Hoke Simpson, a former associate dean at the Graduate School of Business 
at Columbia University, died on Sept. 26 at United Hospital in Port 
Chester. Simpson, a resident of Rye, was 83. The cause of death was 
lung disease, said his daughter, Drayton Jenkins Gerety. Simpson joined 
the business school as the director of executive programs in 1954 
and was promoted to associate dean for executive education in 1967. 
The executive education program, which is part of the business school, 
is a series of one- to four-week non-degree courses for executives, 
including those in management, finance, leadership and marketing. 
Courses are sometimes custom-designed for private companies. When 
Simpson joined the business school, its executive education division 
was just starting. He helped develop a wide range of business courses, 
and during his tenure the school had programs in New York, France, 
Spain and South America. He retired in 1985. After he graduated from 
the Georgia Institute of Technology in 1935 with a bachelor's degree 
in mechanical engineering and industrial management, Simpson went 
to work as a salesman for General Foods Corp. During a 16-year career 
at General Foods, except for a six-year stint with the Naval Reserve, 
Simpson worked in the marketing, personnel and labor-relations divisions. 
Before joining Columbia University, Simpson worked for Vick Chemical 
Co. as director of personnel and public relations. Simpson is survived 
by his wife, Suzanne, of Rye; his daughter, of Mamaroneck; two sons, 
Hoke Jr., of San Diego, and Willis, of Asheville, N.C.; seven grandchildren, 
and two great-grandchildren.
