Family members of confessed unabomber Ted Kaczynski say they want 
their $1 million reward for turning-him-in to go the victims of his 
bombings not the irs. David Kaczynski alerted authorities in 1996 
when he suspected his brother was the bomber who had eluded them for 
17 years. Legislation is in the works in both houses of Congress to 
keep the IRS from collecting as much as a third of the reward as tax.
