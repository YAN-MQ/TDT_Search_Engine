Duane Walker, "Headline Sports." The Cleveland Indians have turned 
home in game three of the American league championship series and 
defeated the Yankees 6-1. The Indians have a 2-1 series lead. Andy 
pettitte tied an alcs record by allowing four homers. Jim thome hit 
a pair. Mark whiten and manny Ramirez hit the others. Manny hit the 
home run. I thought that I threw a decent pitch. I don't know, I haven't 
seen the replay. I didn't know if it was up or not. But, you know, 
he's just locked in right now. And, you know, I walked him and thome 
hits the ball out of the park. And, you know, that's pretty much, 
you know, with the way colon was throwing and with his stuff, it's 
going to be tough to get him after getting down five runs. For us, 
you know, going in and playing against the Yankees, you have to bring 
your game to another level. And, you know, the two games that we've 
won, we've won because our pitching has put us in situations to win. 
You know, I could say we're not hitting, and it's true. But I don't 
want you to think that the kid didn't pitch a hell of a ball game. 
You know, if I'm going to use my team's not hitting as an excuse for 
losing, then I'm not giving him enough credit.
