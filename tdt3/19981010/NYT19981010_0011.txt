Dr. Joseph F. Speyer, a molecular geneticist at the University of 
Connecticut whose early work on mutant genes helped build the foundation 
for modern molecular genetics and biotechnology, died on Oct. 2 at 
his home in Willington, Conn. He was 72. The cause was heart failure, 
his colleagues said. In the 1960s, while working at the Cold Spring 
Harbor Laboratory on Long Island, Speyer made important discoveries 
about the replication and mutation of genes. Then, the process of 
DNA replication and mutation was not well understood, said Dr. Arthur 
Chovnick, a colleague at the University of Connecticut. By studying 
how genes mutated, Speyer found that an enzyme called polymerase played 
a central role in correcting errors and thus prevented many mutations 
that occurred during replication of the DNA strands within the cell. 
In the 1950s, Speyer's work at New York University was part of the 
early effort to unlock the genetic code, Chovnick said. Joseph Speyer 
was born in Eisenach, Germany, in 1926. In 1939, his family came under 
threat from the Nazi government and he fled to England with his father 
and brother. He attended school in Leicester, England, and studied 
at London University. After the war, he worked for the U.S. Army and 
immigrated to America in 1947. He received his BS in chemistry and 
PhD in biochemistry from the University of Utah. Speyer taught at 
the New York University School of Medicine from 1957 to 1964, when 
he became a senior staff investigator at the Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory. 
In 1967, he joined the Department of Molecular and Cell Biology at 
the University of Connecticut. His marriage to Anne Mattison ended 
in divorce. He is survived by his companion, Ruth Piuck; two sons, 
David, of White Plains, and Peter, of Salt Lake City; three daughters, 
Julie Speyer of Natick, Mass., Katherine Schieffelin of Southborough, 
Mass., and Jane Speyer of Lakewood, Ohio; a brother, George, of New 
Barnet, Hertfordshire, England; a sister, Hannah Simon of Berlin; 
and six grandchildren.
