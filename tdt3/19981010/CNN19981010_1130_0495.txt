Tranquil weather is expected for most of the nation this weekend as 
a Ridge of high pressure dominates in the western U.S. and across 
most of the Tennessee and Ohio river valleys. A cold front will be 
moving across the northern plains, an area of low pressure could bring 
showers mixed with snow across portions of Montana and into the northern 
plains. A new pacific cold front will enter the coast of California, 
Oregon and Washington late in the period with rain showers beginning. 
And look for continued rain and maybe a few thunderstorms across Florida 
and showers in New England as the cold front moves offshore. Temperatures 
will be cooling in the west with 40s and 50s on today's weather map. 
Look for 70s, 60s, and 80s across the Mississippi valley and down 
into the gulf of Mexico. The extended forecast includes strong thunderstorms 
for the Great Lakes on Monday with heavy rainfall expected across 
portions of the northwest. The rain will continue into Tuesday with 
showers and a few thunderstorms continuing to head eastward across 
the Great Lakes into Wednesday. The forecast for more than 6,000 cities 
is at CNN.com.
