John Hartson has been fined 10,000 pounds (dlrs 17,000) for kicking 
West Ham teammate Eyal Berkovic in the head during a training session 
two weeks ago. Hammers manager Harry Redknapp said Saturday that Hartson 
had been fined two weeks' pay, the maximum permissible under Professional 
Footballers Association guidelines, and the money would go to a cancer 
charity. Redknapp said he decided to fine Hartson despite calls from 
Berkovic not to impose a financial penalty on the Welsh international. 
``John has apologized for the incident but he has still been fined 
two weeks' wages,'' he said. ``Hopefully that will be the end of the 
matter.'' The incident sparked outrage when a series of graphic photographs 
published in hte Mirror on Wednesday showed Hartson kicking a prone 
Berkovic in the face. Berkovic, an Israeli international, was quoted 
as saying he was in agony and was unable to eat for two days after 
the incident. He also said he was considering leaving West Ham because 
he could not ``forgive and forget'' what Hartson had done. ``If my 
head was a ball it would have been (kicked into) the top corner of 
the net,'' Berkovic said.
