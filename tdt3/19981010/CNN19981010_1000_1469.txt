An 11-year-old boy is now the owner of the most expensive stamp in 
the United States. There are only two known versions of the one-cent 
stamp, known as the Z-grill. Interest in the stamp from collectors 
was intense at the auction. The boy, zachary sundman, had to shell 
out $850,000 for it. We think it was a bargain. We were willing to 
pay quite a bit more. The complete collection which we'll sell over 
a period of days will bring probably in excess of $6 million. That 
will make it one of the most available stamp collections ever sold 
in the United States. It's not clear where the boy got the money. 
The stamp was part of the first complete set of U.S. stamps to ever 
go to auction.
