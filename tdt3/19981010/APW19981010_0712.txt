Goals from Jaap Stam and Peter van Vossen gave the Netherlands a 2-0 
victory over Peru Saturday and Frank Rijkaard a winning debut as coach 
of the Dutch national side. The first half was frustratingly goalless 
with the Dutch, a semifinalist this summer in France, dominating in 
all areas of the field except the Peruvian penalty area. In the end 
it took a big defender's power at dead ball situation to break the 
deadlock. Manchester United's Stam forced Peruvian keeper Oscar Ibanez 
to punch away his free kick, then outleapt the defense on the resulting 
corner to head in the eventual game winner in the 56th minute. The 
Dutch added insurance with 15 minutes remaining. Edgar Davids chipped 
a through-ball to substitute Peter van Vossen, who celebrated his 
return to international play with a goal. Playing a flowing, incisive 
game, the Dutch created half a dozen chances in the first half, including 
the first for Marc Overmars after intricate work from Patrick Kluivert 
and Dennis Bergkamp. Bergkamp went close himself in the ninth minute 
with a trademark curler from the edge of the box which just missed 
the post. Kluivert missed three great chances, shooting wide from 
6 meters, nearly scoring after a Juan Reynoso defensive error and 
striking the bar with a header from a corner. Just before halftime, 
Edwin van der Sar turned a free kick from Nolberto Solano round the 
post and the Newcastle United player went close again near the end 
of the game. Rijkard, veteran of 73 internationals including the Dutch 
1988 European Championship-winning team, kept faith with most of the 
Dutch World Cup stars, and SC Heerenveen's Jeffrey Talan was the only 
new face in the starting lineup. ___ Lineups Netherlands: Edwin van 
der Sar, Michael Reiziger, Jaap Stam, Frank de Boer, Phillip Cocu,
