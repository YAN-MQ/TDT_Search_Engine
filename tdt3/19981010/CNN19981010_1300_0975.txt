Millions of dollars are spent every year on breakfast foods for children. 
But are consumers getting the most nutritional bang for the bucks? 
Elizabeth Cohen has more. The food millions of children eat for breakfast 
every morning turns out to be the single biggest source of vitamins 
and minerals in their daily diet. Because breakfast cereals are fortified. 
It's as if you took a vitamin and Mineral pill and sprinkled it into 
the cereal. In a study of 4,000 children, aged 2 to 18, researchers 
found found that breakfast cereal was the children's biggest source 
of vitamin A, iron and folic acid. The nutritionist who did the study 
says that breakfast cereals are fine, but she worries that kids aren't 
getting enough vitamins and minerals from natural sources. That's 
because fruits and vegetables have vitamins and minerals, plus a lot 
more. There are things like carotinoids or bioflavonoids or many other 
pigments in foods that seem to be very important in health, and different 
kinds of fibers and other nutrients that we may not even know about 
yet. Along with breakfast cereal, here are some of the foods kids 
eat most frequently -- nutrition experts worry that parents will figure 
it's okay if their kids ignore vegetables, as long as they get the 
supplements in cereals. We shouldn't be lulled into thinking that, 
because kids are eating breakfast cereal, that they're getting everything 
they need in their diet. They still need to eat a variety of foods, 
including fruits and vegetables and whole grains. And that is something 
mothers, and more recently the federal government, have been trying 
to get kids to do for years. Elizabeth Cohen, CNN, Atlanta.
