The house has passed legislation that would make it tougher for the 
over-extended to erase their debts. President Clinton is threatening 
to veto the proposed changes in bankruptcy law. Opponents say they 
would plunge financially-strapped families into debt for the rest 
of their lives while giving too much advantage to credit card companies. 
Supporters say the changes will clamp down on bankruptcy abuse. Personal 
bankruptcy filings have jumped 300% since 1980.
