Presidential confidant former cabinet officer Washington power broker 
Clark clifford died today. Mark leff recalls his life and career. 
Clark clifford had a long and distinguished career as a Washington 
attorney, and adviser to democratic presidents and a reputation as 
a man of integrity. How you can go 50 years without getting in trouble, 
it isn't an accident. It's being so careful all the time. But clifford 
was in trouble. By mid-1991, his name already linked to a global banking 
scandal that overshadowed his early successes. Clark clifford had 
helped President Harry truman redefine the way the U.S. watched the 
postwar world. We organized the CIA. That was one of my first assignments 
when we did the whole defense act of 1947. Truman's 1948 whistle stop 
election campaign was clifford's idea. He was John Kennedy's personal 
lawyer and sometimes his intelligence adviser, Lyndon Johnson's last 
secretary of defense and Jimmy Carter's point man with the Senate 
on the new Panama canal treaty. After republicans reclaimed the White 
House in 1981, clifford took on a new challenge as chairman of a Washington, 
D.C. bank holding company with Middle Eastern backers. I practiced 
law for over 50 years. I was too old to go back into government. They 
offered me the position and I thought, "another opportunity of demonstrating 
that I can take on any task there is and make a success of it." But 
behind the success of first American was the bank of credit and commerce 
international. To the end of his life, clifford insisted he didn't 
know of bcci's involvement when he told federal bank regulators in 
1981 bcci did not control first American. In 1991, regulators around 
the world shut down bcci, which later pleaded guilty to racketeering 
charges in the U.S. nearly a year after clifford and his law partner 
quit their jobs at first American, they pleaded not guilty to bribery 
and conspiracy charges. I know them to be false. And I'm going to 
fight every step of the way. As long as I have the strength and the 
health to do it, I will fight each day. Altman went to trial in New 
York. A jury acquitted him in 1993. Guilty or not guilty? Not guilty. 
Federal and state officials dropped all charges against clifford, 
in part, because of his poor health. He and altman quietly paid $5 
million to settle civil fraud charges in February. Now Clark clifford, 
at one time one of the century's most powerful political figures, 
is dead at 91. Mark leff, CNN, reporting.
