Smoke continues to gush out of a huge volcano near quito, Ecuador. 
But experts now say they do not think it will erupt. A state of alert 
was declared for the area earlier this week, and residents of nearby 
villages have been practicing evacuation drills just in case. The 
16,000-foot-tall volcano has erupted 25 times in the past. The most 
recent eruption in 1993 killed two scientists doing research on the 
volcano.
