We'll check the lastest baseball playoff action, next in "Headline 
Sports." Margy brown, a rancher's wife, makes beeswax handcream in 
lusk, Wyoming. The Cowboys love my handcream. She runs her entire 
business with Microsoft windows on a home PC. You don't have to be 
in the middle of the city when you have the resources we have. Lately, 
margy's handcream has been selling like hotcakes. Just shows you what 
a good idea and a little technology can do.
