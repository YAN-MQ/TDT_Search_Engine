Bipartisanship, said Rep. Henry Hyde, the man in charge of the House's 
newly authorized impeachment inquiry, is essential or else ``the end 
product will not be trusted.'' On a different day, the Illinois Republican 
declared as the two parties clashed over the release of President 
Bill Clinton's videotaped grand jury testimony that bipartisanship 
``doesn't include surrender to everything the Democrats want.'' Reconciling 
those declarations is likely to occupy a substantial amount of Hyde's 
energy in coming weeks as he presides over an ideologically and politically 
divided Judiciary Committee embarking on the third serious impeachment 
proceeding in the nation's history. At the end of the committee's 
work, according to lawmakers and senior aides, none of whom was willing 
to speak for attribution, the Republican-controlled panel is likely 
to approve articles of impeachment against the president. They will 
probably center on allegations of perjury and obstruction of justice, 
and the vote could well occur along party lines. Any such decision 
is several weeks off. First come the lawyers' arguments over which 
witnesses to subpoena, what facts are in dispute and other issues. 
Then come midterm elections Nov. 3. Hearings likely will begin a few 
weeks later, after both parties have had a chance to digest results 
of the balloting and decide what, if any, changes to make in their 
approaches. A strong showing by Republicans could cause some Democrats 
in the committee or the full House to show a willingness to reach 
across party lines on impeachment. A weak showing by the GOP, on the 
other hand, could cause some Republicans to flinch from impeachment, 
and spark fresh talk of censure or some other lesser punishment. ``If 
there are Democratic gains, I think that's a signal,'' Hyde told reporters 
late last week. ``If there are Republican gains, that's a signal. 
If it's status quo, that's not a signal'' from the public. Nor can 
the committee predict Independent Counsel Kenneth Starr's plans. Last 
week, he wrote Hyde and Rep. John Conyers, the panel's ranking Democrat, 
that his investigation continues. Indictments are also a possibility. 
In early phases of the impeachment review, Republicans have been eager 
to make gestures in the direction of the Democrats without compromising 
on their twin demands for an inquiry unlimited in either time or subject. 
For their part, Democrats have made clear their disapproval of Clinton's 
relationship with Monica Lewinsky, at the same time depicting Republicans 
as conducting a partisan investigation. It's a strategy driven in 
part by a desire to increase interest in the coming elections among 
core Democratic voters who might otherwise stay home on Nov. 3. ``Democrats 
who support a continuation of the inquiry but with a firm 30-day limit 
substantially improve their position in the race for Congress,'' according 
to poll results released last week for Emily's List, an organization 
of Democratic women. ``Democrats who vote to support going forward 
with the inquiry get hurt in their races,'' according to this analysis, 
shared with Democratic leaders in the hours before the House vote. 
In last week's vote on the House floor, only 31 of 206 Democrats voted 
for the Republicans' open-ended inquiry after the party's leader, 
Missouri Rep. Richard Gephardt, worked out an alternative plan that 
satisfied both liberals and conservatives in the caucus. ``It was 
generally perceived as a partisan vote,'' said one Democratic aide, 
speaking with satisfaction, after the 258-176 tally. Neither Speaker 
Newt Gingrich, the man Democrats love to attack, nor Majority Leader 
Dick Armey spoke on the issue from the floor, while both Gephardt 
and Democratic Whip David Bonior did. In his remarks, Gephardt said 
to Republicans, ``This should not be a party vote.'' ``Under the Republican 
plan, Congress will spend the next two years mired in hearings, tangled 
in testimony, and grinding its gears in partisan stalemate,'' said 
Bonior. Several sources, speaking on condition of anonymity, said 
Bonior suggested after Republicans insisted on limiting debate to 
an hour on the impeachment inquiry that Democrats protest by boycotting 
the official photograph of the 105th Congress being staged on the 
House floor that morning. Hyde, who has declared a ``New Year's Resolution'' 
to wrap up his work by the end of the year, agreed to double debate 
time to two hours, without compromising on terms of the investigation.
