All right, in less than a few hours, the Braves will visit San Diego 
in game three of the national league championship series. The padres 
lead the series 2-0. The Braves have Greg Maddux. It's flies to have 
two wins there, but we're still two wins away from beating the Atlanta 
Braves. We know that. If they are going to beat us, they're going 
to beat us the hard way.
