Gustavo Petricioli Iturbide, who served as Mexico's treasury secretary 
during the debt crisis of the 1980s and was later ambassador to the 
United States, died Saturday. Petricioli, 70, died of a heart attack 
at Los Angeles Hospital in Mexico City, the government news agency 
Notimex reported. President Miguel de la Madrid named Petricioli as 
treasury secretary in June 1986, at a time when Mexico's foreign debt 
was near dlrs 100 billion, largely as a result of the collapse of 
oil prices at the start of the decade. He served as ambassador to 
the United States from January 1989 to January 1993 during the administration 
of President Carlos Salinas de Gortari, when Mexico negotiated the 
restructuring of its debt. During that period, Mexico also began negotiations 
with the United States and Canada on the North American Free Trade 
Agreement, the trade bloc which began Jan. 1, 1994. Petricioli, who 
held a master's degree from Yale University, also held positions at 
the Nacional Financiera development bank and the Bank of Mexico. He 
is survived by his mother and four children.
