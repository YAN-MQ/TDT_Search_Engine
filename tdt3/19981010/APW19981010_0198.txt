Bosnian Serb hard-liners have rejected the removal of their candidate 
from a seat in their legislature for threatening retaliation against 
possible NATO airstrikes in neighboring Yugoslavia, media here reported 
Saturday. Bosnia's top international official, Carlos Westendorp, 
with the authority to supervise policies in post-war Bosnia, removed 
earlier this week Dragan Cavic, vice president of the strongest Bosnian 
Serb party, from parliament and banned him from holding any other 
government position. Simon Haselock, a spokesman for Westendorp, the 
statement made by the main board of the hard-line Serbian Democratic 
Party was ``ludicrous'' and would have no effect. Cavic had warned 
Western powers that any NATO attack against Yugoslavia would be perceived 
as an attack against all Serbs, including those in Bosnia, and promised 
solidarity with Serbs in Serbia proper. Cavic also said airstrikes 
or any NATO military action would endanger the 1995 peace accord that 
ended the 3 1/2-year Bosnian war. Such statements were ``incitement 
to violence and a deliberate threat to the security of the international 
community and to the Dayton peace implementation process,'' Westendorp 
said, explaining his decision to remove Cavic. The Serbian Democratic 
Party rejected Thursday Westendorp's decision, claiming it was beyond 
his mandate. However, Haselock said, ``This decision stands,'' underlining 
that Westendorp has a mandate to remove officials who speak and work 
against the Dayton peace agreement. ``Mr. Westendorp has used his 
authority on other occasions,'' he added. Cavic, a leading member 
of the SDS, won a seat last month in the parliament that governs the 
Bosnian Serb half of the country. In a letter addressed Saturday to 
the U.S. mediator for the Balkans, Robert Gelbard, the newly elected 
president of the Serb half of the country, Nikola Poplasen, claimed 
Westendorp's decision on Cavic's removal was ``unfounded.'' ``Cavic 
has simply repeated a well-known fact, that an eventual (NATO) bombing 
of Serbia would be the bombing of a part of the Serb nation,'' wrote 
Poplasen, whose Radicals are allied with Cavic's SDS.
