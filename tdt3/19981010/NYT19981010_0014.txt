William E. Griffith, a historian and political scientist who was an 
authority on communism, the Cold War and Central and Eastern Europe, 
died on Sept. 28 at Massachusetts General Hospital in Boston. He was 
78 and lived in Lexington, Mass. The cause was a stroke, said Robert 
Sales of the news office at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology, 
which announced Griffith's death on Monday. Griffith spent 31 years 
in teaching and other posts at MIT and was the Ford international 
professor of political science when he retired in 1990. ``He foresaw 
the first thaws in the Cold War while it was at its height,'' and 
he realized early on that the Sino-Soviet split was occurring, said 
Lucian Pye, a retired MIT political-science professor. ``He often 
could spot things just as they were beginning to bud,'' Pye added, 
and he said that when Zbigniew Brzezinski was national security adviser 
in the Carter administration, Brzezinski had Griffith as a part-time 
consultant and ``found him very helpful.'' Griffith, who collaborated 
with Brzezinski on several books and commuted to Washington once a 
week from Cambridge, was called ``Zbig's idea man'' by a White House 
aide in 1979. ``Bill Griffith was a very dedicated anti-communist 
and understood communism better than most people,'' said Lincoln Bloomfield, 
a retired MIT professor of political science who was director of global 
issues at the National Security Council in the Carter administration. 
Griffith wrote in his book ``The Superpowers and Regional Tensions'' 
(1982), ``Bolshevik ideology gave to Soviet expansionism a conviction 
of legitimacy and of inevitable success and, paradoxically, the imperative 
to push history forward faster.'' Griffith's writing and editing in 
his field won applause. He edited the book ``Central and Eastern Europe: 
The Opening Curtain?'' (1989), consisting of chapters by various specialists. 
The book was praised by John Whitehead, a former deputy secretary 
of state, as ``a major contribution to the analysis of political and 
economic developments in this very important part of the world.'' 
Other books Griffith wrote included ``Albania and the Sino-Soviet 
Rift'' (1963), which Harry Schwartz praised in The New York Times 
Book Review. Schwartz, also an expert on the East Bloc, wrote: ``Almost 
two years have passed since Premier Khrushchev first denounced the 
communist leaders of Albania as murderers and traitors, but the leaders 
of that tiny primitive country continue in power. How this David and 
Goliath struggle arose, what forces brought together Albania and the 
colossus of China, the result of the quarrel on other communist nations 
are all matters admirably discussed in Griffith's book.'' Before moving 
to MIT, Griffith was the chief political adviser at Radio Free Europe 
in Munich, Germany, when it was still operated by the CIA from 1950 
to 1958. He was born in Remsen, N.Y., and received a bachelor's degree 
in liberal arts in 1940 from Hamilton College, and a master's degree 
in 1941 and a doctorate in 1950, both in history from Harvard. He 
was an Army officer in France and Germany during World War II and 
later was a high military government official in Bavaria, Germany. 
He is survived by his wife of 50 years, the former Ingeborg Maria 
Ehrhardt; two daughters, Evelyn and Dorothy, both of Munich; a son, 
Oliver, of Paris, and five grandchildren.
