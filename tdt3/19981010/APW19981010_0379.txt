Russian Prime Minister Yevgeny Primakov said Saturday that if NATO 
uses force to try to resolve the Kosovo crisis, Russia may have to 
revise its relationship with the western alliance, Russian news agencies 
reported Saturday. He reiterated that Russia would use its veto in 
the U.N. Security Council to prevent airstrikes against Yugoslavia. 
``We cannot allow this resolution,'' Primakov was quoted as saying 
by the Interfax news agency. If NATO nevertheless goes ahead with 
airstrikes, ``it could destroy the world's existing security system,'' 
he said, according to the ITAR-Tass news agency. Such a move would 
set a dangerous precedent for the use of force, without U.N. approval, 
against other countries, he said. Russia's parliament has already 
said it would review all agreements between NATO and Russia if the 
western alliance were to opt for force against Yugoslavia. Moscow 
Mayor Yuri Luzhkov added his voice Saturday to the chorus of Russians 
opposed to NATO airstrikes. He said that Yugoslavia should be left 
to sort out the Kosovo conflict on its own. ``If there is a need for 
resolving issues in Yugoslavia, including with the help of military 
pressure, the U.N. Security Council should sanction it,'' Interfax 
quoted Luzhkov as saying. The popular, populist Luzhkov has indicated 
he plans to run for Russia's presidency in the next elections in 2000. 
Russia, a key ally of Yugoslavia, has condemned Yugoslav President 
Slobodan Milosevic's crackdown on ethnic Albanians in Kosovo, but 
has staunchly opposed use of force against Yugoslavia. ``Military, 
pirate-like methods'' will not solve the Kosovo conflict, Luzhkov 
said. Foreign Ministry spokesman Vladimir Rakhmanin told the Ekho 
Moskvy radio station Saturday that NATO's discussions in Brussels 
this weekend were increasingly focusing on a political settlement 
of the crisis in Kosovo.
