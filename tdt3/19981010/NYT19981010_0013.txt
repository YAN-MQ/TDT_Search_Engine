Richard M. Cyert, a management professor and former president of Carnegie 
Mellon University in Pittsburgh, whose half-century at the university 
encompassed its growth from a small regional institute to a national 
center of higher learning with a global reputation in computer technology 
and education research, died on Wednesday night at his home in Fox 
Chapel, Pa. He was 77. The cause was cancer, said Donald Hale, Carnegie 
Mellon's vice president for university relations. Cyert was born in 
Winona, Minn., the son of two orphans. He worked his way through the 
University of Minnesota as a page in the library and earned a doctorate 
at Columbia University under the GI Bill of Rights, after serving 
as a Navy officer in World War II. He joined the faculty at Carnegie 
Mellon, then called the Carnegie Institute of Technology, as an instructor 
of economics in 1948 and rose to the rank of professor of economics 
and industrial administration before being appointed dean of the William 
Larimer Mellon Graduate School of Industrial Administration in 1962. 
There, under Cyert's direction, the ``management game'' for business 
education was developed and expanded. It is now used as a model for 
many other schools; simply put, the game consists of students simulating 
the operation of a corporation. Cyert, who became the sixth president 
of the 98-year-old university in 1972, was also a pioneer in computerizing 
colleges. In the mid-1980s, he linked all the computers on campus 
to a single network, a system that is as common today as it was unheard 
of 15 years ago. ``A lot of people refer to this place as `Computer 
U.,' and Dick should be credited with that,'' Hale said. Cyert, who 
also shored up the university's finances during his tenure, retired 
from the president's post in 1990, but served as a professor emeritus 
and continued to teach courses until last spring. During his career, 
he was the author or co-author of 12 books and more than 100 articles 
for professional journals in the fields of economics, behavioral science, 
management and statistics. In the early 1990s, he also headed the 
Carnegie Bosch Institute, endowed by the German company Robert Bosch, 
to study and improve international management. He was also a consultant 
in economics and management science in Belgium, Germany and Australia. 
He was awarded several honorary doctorates, too, and was elected a 
fellow of the Econometric Society, the American Association for the 
Advancement of Science and the American Statistical Association. He 
received a Ford Foundation research fellowship and a John Simon Guggenheim 
Memorial Foundation fellowship. Cyert was also a director and consultant 
for numerous businesses. In 1980, he headed Gov. Dick Thornburgh's 
commission to review and make recommendations for Pennsylvania's tax 
laws. He was active in numerous efforts to revitalize western Pennsylvania, 
and, just as he watched Carnegie Mellon grow, he saw the region's 
economy evolve from one with a steel and manufacturing base to one 
with growing reliance on high technology. Cyert is survived by his 
wife, Margaret Shadick Cyert; three daughters, Lynn Anne Cyert of 
Tahlequah, Okla., Lucinda Cyert Steffes of Seattle and Martha Cyert 
of Palo Alto, Calif.; two sisters, Constance Conradi of Brainerd, 
Minn., and Charlotte Wilson of Ottawa, and three grandsons.
