it shook the capitol city to is core. but it didn't shake up the rest 
of the country. here's nbc's jonathan alter. a fierce debate in the 
capital thursday. this is the most divisive issue since the vietnam 
war. but at the same moment congress agonized over history, america 
shrugged. at a los angeles restaurant. quite frankly, i'm more concerned 
with what's going on with the economy than the impeachment hearings. 
a grocery store in dearborn, michigan. if they want to waste the taxpayer's 
money impeaching a lame duck president, it wouldn't surprise me, but 
it's stupid. acoffee bar in atlanta. i really feel we need to get 
on with the things that matter to americans. here at the tick tock 
diner in clifton, new jersey, they like to hash over the scandal with 
their hash browns, but they aren't necessarily going to vote over 
it. with three weeks to go before the mid-term elections, most politics 
is still local. they're worried about the traffic. they worry about 
the school systems, you know. they're moving those halfway houses 
in and a lot of people don't want 'em. are you guys here talking about 
business or lewinsky? business, business. we've done that already. 
we got done talking about her, like three months ago. the tick tock 
diner is in the district of house freshman bill pascrell, who faces 
a tough race. pascrell sided with fellow democrats in opposing the 
open-ended impeachment inquiry pushed through by republicans. there 
are pluses and minuses. you're damned if you do and damned if you 
don't. maybe pascrell shouldn't be worrying so much about the fallout. 
when they do talk about the scandal and who should pay, the voters 
in pascrell's district seem focused on bill clinton, not their congressman. 
i am in favor of impeachment of the president. i feel he cheated on 
his wife and not his country. and i don't think he should be impeached. 
pollsters say the voters views of the scandal are set. public opinion 
really hasn't changed, because people haven't really learned anything 
new. unless they do, washington's obsession will never be theirs. 
i'm interested in what's going on, but the yankees first. jonathan 
alter, nbc news, clifton, new jersey.
