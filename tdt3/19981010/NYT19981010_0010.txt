Chang Chong-Jen, a Chinese painter and sculptor who inspired the comic-strip 
artist known as Herge to create Chang, one of the most loved characters 
in the renowned Tintin books, died on Thursday at an artists' retirement 
home outside Paris. He was 93. For most readers of the classic Tintin 
adventure ``The Blue Lotus,'' Chang was a figment of the imagination 
of the Belgian-born artist Georges Remi, whose nom de plume was Herge. 
In the comic book, published in 1935 but still in print in France 
and the United States, Tintin rescues Chang from the swollen Yangtze 
River and the two become bosom buddies. Their relationship, however, 
reflected the friendship between Herge and the real Chang, who was 
studying at the Royal Academy of Fine Arts in Brussels, Belgium, when 
they met in 1934. They were introduced by a Belgian priest who felt 
that Chang could help Herge prepare Tintin's next adventure in China 
and forestall the cultural stereotypes that characterized the earlier 
``Tintin in the Congo.'' ``At the time, for Westerners, China represented 
old mandarins and women with tiny feet who threw their babies into 
rivers,'' Chang recalled in 1994. ``I opened Herge's eyes.'' The Chinese 
artist's influence was significant. Herge not only avoided many racial 
cliches but also created the comic strip in the spirit of Chinese 
pen-and-ink drawings. In 1935, before ``The Blue Lotus'' was published, 
Chang returned to China where he began an artistic career that would 
be endlessly disrupted and even halted by wars and political upheavals, 
from the Japanese invasion of China to the Cultural Revolution of 
the 1960s. Nonetheless, in the mid-1970s he was appointed director 
of the Fine Arts Academy of Shanghai. Although the Chang character 
appeared again briefly in ``Tintin in Tibet,'' in 1958, it was only 
in 1981 that Herge traced Chang's whereabouts and invited him to visit 
Brussels. By the time Herge died two years later, Chang's special 
place in the history of Tintin had been widely reported in Belgium 
and France. In 1985, France's culture minister, Jack Lang, invited 
Chang and his daughter to settle in France, where the artist was commissioned 
to sculpt a bust of President Francois Mitterrand as well as one of 
Herge, destined for the Comic Book Museum at Angouleme. He also made 
a sculpture of Deng Xiaoping, which was shipped to China. In a statement 
Friday, Lang, now mayor of Blois, described Chang as a ``modest, generous 
and courageous'' man. ``He was for me a powerful symbol of dignity 
in face of the difficult challenges faced by the great Chinese people,'' 
Lang said.
