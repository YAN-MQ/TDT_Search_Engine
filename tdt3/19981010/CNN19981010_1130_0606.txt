With the help of new technology and your computer, you can man the 
helm with sailors traveling around the world. Marsha Walton has the 
story in this edition of "tech trends." 16 sailors are racing 27,000 
miles across the globe in the grueling "around alone" competition. 
It means for us there are no nights and no days, mostly we are working 
all the time, but we usually sleep by periods of one hour, and when 
it is really difficult, 20 minutes. But these racers are not really 
alone anymore. Technology adds a new level of "connection," for the 
sailors, and for millions discovering the sport on the Internet. Well, 
now with the technology, we can be in touch, through E-mail, through 
satellite phone, we can send pictures, we can send video, so now people 
can participate in the sport, they can see us. The downside is we 
have no privacy anymore. So this is another way of looking at the 
real boats. Quokka sports is presenting the race on the around alone 
web site. It's rainy, it's Gray, it's overcast. Some squalls are coming 
through. The raw material comes from the skippers themselves, who 
transmit E-mails, audio clips and digital pictures of their voyage. 
Golf and tennis transformed in the '50s and '60s as a result of TV. 
Before that, it was just a regional event. For sailing, that's what 
we're seeing now. It's become a global spectator event. Registered 
"virtual sailors" can set their own courses, and compare their progress 
with the racers and other cybersailors. But they will miss out on 
some experiences -- When you like sailing, being outside, alone on 
the ocean, with the sky and the sea and the birds, you feel you are 
at your place. It's just incredible. Skippers should hit the finish 
line back at Charleston sometime next may. Marsha Walton, CNN, Charleston, 
South Carolina.
