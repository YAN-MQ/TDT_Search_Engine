In the thicket of assessing the finances of prospective co-op purchasers 
_ with its tangle of documents, murky requirements, competing interests 
and board-member egos _ a would-be buyer's application can be impaled 
on a thorn. Take, for example, the case of a local storekeeper who 
wanted to buy an apartment at Concord Village, a seven-building complex 
in the eastern shadows of the Brooklyn Bridge, where prices range 
from $30,000 for a studio to $150,000 for a two-bedroom. For want 
of a paragraph in a letter from his daughter's school, the storekeeper 
was rejected. It was a prestigious private school, costing about $15,000 
a year, ``and with what they were showing on their tax returns,'' 
said Claudia Corwin, president of the Concord Village board, ``we 
did not see how they could pay for this school, as well as their real 
estate obligations. ``This is how subtle a lot of this is.'' The board 
requested the letter after the storekeeper mentioned during his interview 
that his daughter was in a private school. The board was hoping, Ms. 
Corwin said, ``that the couple was getting financial aid from the 
school, that their income wouldn't have to cover that expense.'' They 
were claiming an income of about $40,000. ``But the letter came and 
it said nothing about financial aid, indicating that the money for 
the school was coming out of their pockets,'' Ms. Corwin said. ``And, 
therefore, we concluded that if they could afford the school, obviously 
they had cash they weren't telling us about _ a little thing like 
that, that the letter from the school didn't mention financial aid.'' 
Such are the vagaries of the financial assessment process faced by 
scores of hopeful buyers in a real estate market that _ despite the 
buckling of some foreign economies and the gyrations of Wall Street 
_ has, so far at least, continued to percolate. Brokers and others 
involved in the co-op market say the demand for high-priced apartments, 
especially in Manhattan, has allowed co-op boards in many white-glove 
buildings to retain or tighten financial requirements. But boards 
in many middle-class buildings, particularly in the other boroughs 
and the suburbs where the effects of the last recession lingered longer, 
remain relieved to be making sales, and more readily approve applications 
_ albeit a bit more fussily. Fussiness, however, is not necessarily 
akin to precision. And applicants _ no matter their financial status 
_ must deal with an assessment process that lacks standardized requirements. 
Boards in high-end buildings tend to demand that a buyer have reserve 
assets that are multiples of the purchase price. In midpriced buildings, 
boards are more concerned about what the proportion of an applicant's 
maintenance and loan obligations would be to his income. But in terms 
of required percentages, there are no set criteria. As for recent 
zigs and zags in the financial markets, said Clark Halstead, founder 
of the brokerage that bears his name, co-op boards at the high end 
``are case-hardened against knee-jerk reactions.'' If an applicant's 
wealth is in stocks, Halstead said, ``what's happened recently is 
a 20 percent decline in that person's net worth.'' ``And, frankly,'' 
he said, ``20 percent is not enough to change the picture for most 
boards with respect to approving that candidate.'' Halstead sees the 
approval process as ``the most thorough invasion of your financial 
privacy that you'll ever suffer.'' ``And this inquisition,'' he said, 
``has not gotten better in recent years. It's gotten a little worse. 
But in the past few weeks there's been no change.'' In the middle-priced 
range, said Herb Rose, a co-op consultant, ``the standards have relaxed 
considerably because there was such a long period when it was impossible 
to sell an apartment,'' and some owners even abandoned their homes 
after failing to meet their obligations. At buildings still haunted 
by memories of sales droughts and defaulting owners, Rose said: ``The 
boards want apartments to move because they can't keep taking them 
back. So I don't perceive that middle-range boards are becoming extremely 
cautious because apartments are selling for little money, and there's 
relief that there are some sales.'' Still, whatever the price range, 
the approval process can be stressful _ for both buyer and board. 
Donna Harrison is the manager of River House, a 213-unit co-op on 
16 manicured acres in Peekskill, N.Y., where a two-bedroom sells for 
about $80,000. ``It's amazing,'' she said. ``When people start this 
process, I am straightforward: `We are going to run a TRW credit check 
and a driver's license check. Be honest about any problems.' ``Some 
people say, `No problem, my credit is great.' And then you run it 
and they have judgments, bankruptcies, chronic late payments.'' Ms. 
Harrison recalled one applicant who ``looked very professional, like 
out of a catalog; this person said, `No problem.' ``She had a good 
administrative job, about $80,000 in income. But the TRW was atrocious 
_ nothing paid on time, student loans unpaid, bankruptcy. And she 
thought she was clean.'' For the buyer, the process can seem like 
slogging through a swamp seeded with mines. ``There is no single standard, 
unfortunately, perhaps,'' said Sylvia Shapiro, author of ``The Co-op 
Bible,'' a guidebook scheduled for release in December by St. Martin's 
Griffin. ``It's unfortunate for the buyer because he may not know 
what he's up against. For the board, the lack of an objective standard 
may allow them to make determinations without the buyer able to hold 
them to account.'' To further complicate matters, said Ms. Shapiro, 
who is also board president at the 229-unit Randall House in Greenwich 
Village, ``every building has its own financial and emotional persona.'' 
``Some board members get Napoleon complexes,'' she said, and ``try 
to be heroes and impose standards that they certainly could not meet 
themselves. ``That creates friction between potential shareholders 
buying at today's prices and entrenched board members who bought back 
in the days when apartments could be had for a song.'' Not to mention 
current shareholders seeking to sell, perhaps immobilized in their 
hopes of closing on another home. One thing, however, has become standard 
in recent years. ``If there is one currently commonplace requirement,'' 
said Stuart Saft, chairman of the Council of New York Cooperatives, 
``it is that the applicant provide tax returns for at least two years. 
Ten years ago, boards never asked for tax returns. It was considered 
too intrusive.'' But intrusion has plumbed new depths in recent years 
_ perhaps of necessity. As Rose, the co-op consultant, pointed out: 
``We are in a more complex world in which few people have only one 
income source. Whereas years back a salaried person would give you 
their W-2, and that was their income, now almost everybody has interest, 
stock profits, capital gains on a real estate transaction, maybe another 
business. ``So the practical way to determine income is really to 
get their tax forms.'' ``Follow-up questioning sometimes indicates 
that not everybody is totally candid with Uncle Sam,'' she said. ``It 
puts the board in a conundrum: if they are not up front with Uncle, 
how will they be with fellow shareholders?'' There are, essentially, 
two financial components a board considers in deciding whether to 
approve a sale _ or, in more precise legal parlance, a transfer, because 
what is actually happening is that stock and a proprietary lease are 
being transferred. ``It's a misnomer to say you are purchasing a co-op 
apartment,'' Saft said. ``What you're purchasing is stock in the corporation 
that owns the building and the right to live in a specific apartment 
under a proprietary lease'' _ proprietary because the buyer is both 
tenant and stockholder. One component of the board's inquiry is, obviously, 
to determine the applicant's income; the other is to ascertain his 
or her net worth _ assets less liabilities. The board's job is to 
determine whether the applicant will be able to cover his or her regular 
living expenses while paying off the apartment loan (commonly, though 
technically incorrectly, called the mortgage), the maintenance and 
any possible assessments for capital improvements to the complex. 
Lurking assessments should concern prospective buyers. ``Brokers and 
sellers wax poetic about all the improvements because, of course, 
they enhance the building's value,'' Ms. Shapiro said. ``But they 
are likely to be close-lipped about items coming down the pike that 
will require an assessment.'' If the building has recently been converted, 
the buyer might ask to see the engineer's report commissioned by the 
tenants' association, which will indicate work that may be needed. 
In an established co-op, copies of board minutes for the last year 
or two should indicate the work being considered. And, as Ms. Shapiro 
said, ``I see nothing wrong, although it would be considered revolutionary, 
for the buyer to ask, `What's coming up?' In my seven years on the 
board, only one buyer took the trouble to get my phone number and 
ask. She earned my respect, not my annoyance.'' The financial inquiry 
process begins after the buyer and seller agree on a price and sign 
a contract, followed by a period during which the purchaser prepares 
a ``board package'' _ folders full of documents _ with the broker 
learning the board's requirements and acting as go-between. During 
the same period, assuming it is not an all-cash deal, the buyer will 
apply for an apartment loan, with most boards requiring a down payment 
of at least 20 percent. ``They cannot submit the package until they 
get the mortgage commitment,'' said JoAnne Kennedy, president of Coldwell 
Banker Hunt Kennedy, a Manhattan brokerage. ``It may take four weeks 
to get the commitment.'' After the papers are submitted, the building's 
managing agent reviews the documents, then presents them to the board. 
If, after picking the package apart to make sure the pieces fit, the 
board tentatively approves, the buyer will be invited for an interview 
_ itself an arduous encounter, with designated board members frequently 
demanding more explanation and documentation. ``The process may take 
another month after the mortgage commitment,'' Ms. Kennedy said. ``So 
there may be two months between contract signing and board approval. 
That's two months the seller doesn't know what to do. They can't show 
the apartment because they are in contract; they can't purchase a 
new home.'' One pioneering board, however, is taking steps to abbreviate 
the process. Harold Spitzer, the president of 400 West End Ave., at 
the corner of 79th Street, said his board would vote this month on 
a policy of reviewing financial packages before buyers have received 
loan commitments. ``We wouldn't approve the buyer before the commitment 
is secured,'' he said, ``but we would review the package. There's 
no reason to hold up the buyer or the seller on a technicality; no 
reason not to let them off the hook.'' Once a board has a buyer's 
financial package in hand, it will first scrutinize the assets and 
then, in effect, write a budget to assess the applicant's ability 
to meet his obligations. And, given that there are no standard formulas 
for that assessment, there are general principles. ``All buildings 
now are looking for a financial cushion, and certain boards want more 
feathers than others,'' said Ms. Kennedy. Many boards, she pointed 
out, had to take back apartments during the last recession, ``so they 
want the buyer to have a minimum of three months' mortgage and maintenance 
in reserve. ``Some fussier boards, where they are looking at gigantic 
mortgages _ a million and up _ want a reserve equal to or more than 
the apartment cost,'' she said. ``And some East Side buildings want 
assets that are multiples of the apartment price.'' If the buyer has 
sufficient funds for an ``all-cash'' purchase, the board will be less 
concerned about net worth. But not always. ``We had an out-of-town, 
fat-cat dad who bought his aspiring model daughter an apartment with 
all cash,'' said Ms. Shapiro. ``But until she made the cover of Vogue, 
she had no visible means of support. So we asked, and dad agreed, 
to deposit a year's maintenance into escrow. That way, the buyer got 
fast-track approval and the board got financial protection.'' If, 
however, the buyer is taking out a loan, the board will examine its 
terms, again to determine whether the buyer can meet his obligations. 
This is particularly true in small co-ops where one shareholder's 
failure can overwhelm the others. There are four apartments in the 
brownstone on Pacific Street in Cobble Hill, Brooklyn, where David 
Becker is board manager and everybody else is on the board. ``We had 
one unit purchased six months ago by a woman who insisted that her 
boyfriend live in the apartment,'' Becker said. ``But her income looked 
like it did not support her financial obligations. ``The irony is, 
not reporting the boyfriend's income was hurting her. So we asked 
for his income statements _ and she was also able to produce stubs 
showing she recently had a pay increase _ but all we could gather 
from his W-2's was that he was in construction.'' In fact, he was 
an architect and construction manager for a large renovation firm. 
Between them, Becker said, ``All problems were solved.'' While there 
are no set, objective standards, there are guidelines _ based on the 
building's location. ``A Fifth Avenue building will have a more restrictive 
formula than one in Canarsie,'' said Saft. ``And one formula used 
in restrictive buildings is that the buyer's net worth be at least 
double the purchase price.'' In the high-end market, with buyers willing 
to pay stratospheric prices, boards for exclusive buildings demand 
high net worth. ``And it's justified,'' Saft said. ``An apartment 
that sold three years ago for $1.5 million may now sell for $3 million. 
Boards have to question the unit's intrinsic value. ``If the value 
could double in three years, it could also halve. And, therefore, 
a buyer financing half the apartment would have no equity if the price 
went down.'' Ms. Shapiro added: ``Prices have escalated to such dizzying 
levels that the bank, not the buyer or seller, may scuttle the deal. 
The button-down banker may say, `Wait a minute, this apartment is 
not worth $3 million,' and not lend unless the price is reduced.'' 
In less restrictive buildings, boards are less interested in net worth 
and look for a monthly income about three times the combination of 
the buyer's maintenance and debt service. ``That's the modern version 
of the old formula that housing costs should be 25 percent of your 
income,'' Saft said. But in New York's expensive market, that 25 percent 
is now closer to 40 percent. ``If before the current market your housing 
costs were $1,000 a month, then you would have needed $4,000 in income 
to get approval,'' Saft said. ``Now they approve buyers with incomes 
as low as $2,500.'' Over the years, he explained, less expensive buildings 
have reduced income requirements to accommodate shareholders trying 
to sell. ``To do this they have to accept people with a lower income 
in proportion to their expenses,'' he said. Some less-restrictive 
boards have informal formulas correlating an applicant's income to 
the size of the apartment he or she is seeking. At River House in 
Peekskill, Ms. Harrison said, the guidelines are $30,000 in income 
to buy a studio, $40,000 for a one-bedroom and $50,000 for a two-bedroom. 
``But they are just that, guidelines,'' she said. ``You could have 
someone who meets a guideline salary-wise, but when you look at their 
TRW their expenses are over-extended. You could have somebody who 
makes $100,000, but just blows it. Or you could have someone who makes 
a moderate salary, but has low expenses. You really have to look at 
all aspects.'' Certain aspects, of course, can be problematic. And 
as a broker, Barbara Corcoran, chairwoman of the Corcoran Group, is 
fully aware of them, particularly for high-end buyers: ``Too-new money. 
Lack of references from well-placed people. High salaries without 
strong assets. New York as a secondary residence. Overseas assets. 
Parents buying for kids.'' But, at any income level, Ms. Corcoran 
said, ``The hardest is someone who is self-employed.'' Al Pennisi, 
a real estate lawyer who advises boards, concurs: ``There are people 
in cash businesses, honest people. But they just can't document, dollar 
for dollar, their income.'' One of the boards Pennisi advises ``had 
a hot dog vendor; good income, in the $50s or $60s; but if the hot 
dog business drops, if he gets a cold corner, the income drops.'' 
The board, Pennisi said, ``liked the guy, nice personality; he checked 
out with prior landlords, but he didn't have a credit history.'' The 
solution: ``This guy put up six months' maintenance, and they approved 
him.'' Co-op boards are not required by law to give the reason for 
a rejection, and most lawyers advise them not to offer explanations 
because they can be become the basis of litigation. But the boards 
must abide by city, state and federal discrimination laws. Ms. Corcoran 
contends there is one underlying reason for most board rejections 
_ failure to disclose. ``It's not that they don't have it, whatever 
a board is looking for, but that they don't show it,'' she said. ``And 
they don't show it because of the common false belief that `the board 
will meet me and I'll explain.' Ninety percent of board turndowns 
happen without an interview because something wasn't disclosed.'' 
And so, Ms. Shapiro, author of ``The Co-op Bible,'' when asked what 
she might include in a Ten Commandments for Hopeful Buyers, came up 
with seven: _ Find out what the board requires, ``and give them what 
they are looking for.'' _ Don't submit information in dribs and drabs. 
``Be neat and complete the first time around, otherwise you will rue 
your errors when the board engages in a war of attrition, seeking 
more documents than the Lewinsky grand jury.'' _ Don't edit out pages 
on your tax returns that you don't like, and don't add zeroes to your 
net worth. _ Many boards require that a net-worth affidavit be signed 
by an accountant; get it signed before you submit. _ If you are selling 
another piece of property, inform the board. ``That indicates you 
will have less debt than might be apparent from a casual glance at 
your application.'' _ If your application is contingent on financing, 
first get a loan commitment. _ Avoid inconsistency. ``We regularly 
get applications with one set of numbers on the loan application, 
another on the net worth affidavit, a third on the financial statements. 
If you do that, the board may conclude that you are playing games 
and drum you out of the corps.''(BBOX)
