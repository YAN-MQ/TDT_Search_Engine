``I get excited by the journey,'' says Shawn Ray, a leading contender 
for the Mr. Olympia title, the most prestigious in professional bodybuilding. 
``I see a little change in a muscle, I go, `Oh, boy, look at that.' 
I mean you don't get excited eating chicken and egg whites, working 
out, then tanning for an hour, then feeling so depleted you've got 
to work out all over again.'' Diverted, I ask, ``Why do black guys 
need a tan?'' Ray snorts. ``Same reason you do. To get darker, to 
get that polish under the lights. I am a commodity, a product. I sell 
charisma, performance. People look at me, 5-foot-7, weighing only 
214 pounds, and my body seems attainable, or at least I am someone 
you can identify with.'' I demur. ``Identify? I could be inspired 
by how you've sculpted your body, but it's too extreme to identify 
with.'' Ray sits very still when he talks, but throbs with a contained 
energy. ``Extreme?'' he says. ``I think Kerry Strug is extreme, a 
4-foot-11-inch, 80-pound gymnast. Who would want to identify with 
that? Why is she America's darling? Or some 350-pound NFL lineman. 
That's extreme. And by the way, find out what chemicals he's taking 
before you come ask us what we're taking.'' Asking Mr. Olympia contestants 
what they are taking is not all that risky; the 18 bodybuilders who 
competed at Madison Square Garden Saturday night tended to be friendly, 
good-looking men in their 30s, superheros in their hometown gyms, 
and relaxed in the sophistication of their pharmacology. At one time 
or another, almost all have used various combinations of chemicals 
to get that ripped, shredded, full look. You can make them laugh by 
asking about Mark McGwire's use of the legal supplement androstenedione, 
which boosts the body's production of testosterone. They think andro 
is candy, relatively useless, and they slyly suggest that the home-run 
king probably uses stronger stuff. Wayne DeMilia, promoter of Mr. 
Olympia and an official of the International Federation of Bodybuilding, 
says he does not test for steroids because his athletes would then 
switch from injectables to the less detectable but ``more toxic'' 
oral doses. ``We test for diuretics, which can kill you the same day,'' 
DeMilia said. ``We've lost two athletes in recent years and had several 
close calls. We're worried right now about blood thickeners, which 
drain water out of your skin. Muscles show right through. I'm also 
worried about insulin use. Steroids are probably the safest thing 
they use.'' Ronnie Coleman, at 285 pounds one of the bigger competitors 
this year, thinks that what is in your bloodstream is less important 
than what is in your genes. ``You think you could take some injections 
and look like me?'' he asked, lounging on his hotel room bed. His 
girlfriend, Vickie Gates, who later this month will compete for the 
Ms. Olympia title in Prague, Czech Republic, was cooking one of his 
six daily meals. ``We are genetic freaks,'' said Coleman, an engaging 
34-year-old with an easy laugh. ``And we work very hard.'' Coleman 
has always worked hard. A high school football star, it took him three 
years to crack the starting lineup at Grambling as a middle linebacker. 
By that time, he realized that he didn't love the violent contact 
and wasn't that good _ the pros were not interested. After graduating 
with honors in accounting, he spent two years as a Domino's Pizza 
manager figuring out that he didn't love numbers that much, either. 
He answered an ad for police officers in Arlington, Tex., and during 
training began intensive weight lifting. The gym owner offered him 
a free membership if he would compete in the Mr. Texas bodybuilding 
contest. He won it. ``I still love it, 10 years later,'' he said. 
``I like the training, but I love the way people look at me, the comments, 
what they have to say about my body. I won Mr. Universe in 1991 and 
turned pro. The next year I entered Mr. Olympia and came in dead last. 
Like I was invisible. But now they say I'm a front-runner.'' Actually, 
the Mr. Olympia title and its $110,000 first prize is up for grabs 
this year with the absence of Dorian Yates, who won the last six contests. 
He is sidelined with torn muscles. Despite Yates' dominance, he is 
not well known outside bodybuilding, a measure of the sport's status 
since the Arnold Schwarzenegger era ended. Schwarzenegger became a 
cross-over superstar after Mr. Olympia victories in 1974 and 1975. 
``I don't even think about comparing myself to Arnold,'' Coleman said, 
almost dreamily. ``That charisma, that intelligence. Funny. Classy. 
And the man can act.'' Shawn Ray, a 33-year-old from Chino Hills, 
Calif., is not likely to compare himself to anyone but Shawn Ray, 
who needs only ``the gold card'' of a Mr. Olympia title, he says, 
to ``GO.'' But muscling into the mainstream, from a sport that is 
barely recognized as such, will be hard. Bodybuilding's image of narcissism, 
drug use and eroticism turns off many potential sponsors, even as 
those images _ often directly borrowed from bodybuilding _ are successfully 
used in fashion, entertainment and personal training. Coleman the 
cop just wants to pose and pursue bad guys; his ``hybrid of aesthetics 
and mass,'' say the heavy-breathing muscle mags, may be ``the physique 
of the future.'' But Ray the commodity wants bodybuilding to purge 
its skulking drug gurus, its soft porn magazines, the ``he-she'' women 
contestants on high-dose testosterone, and get back to promoting the 
likes of him. ``I'm an athlete, but when I look at myself in the mirror 
I see a work of art,'' he said. ``I'm in the process of enhancing 
myself. When I weighed 180 pounds, I had a girlfriend who thought 
I was big enough. She didn't want me to get any bigger. I dumped her. 
Who is to say your thighs are too big, your legs too smooth? Who is 
to say the `Mona Lisa' is better than a painting by Picasso?''
