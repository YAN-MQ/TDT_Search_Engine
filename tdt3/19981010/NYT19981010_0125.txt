Alicia Parla, a sinuous Cuban-born beauty who had a brief but incandescent 
run as the international Queen of the Rumba, died of cancer Oct. 6 
at her home in Miami. She was 84 and was recalled as the teen-age 
sensation who became the toast of New York and Paris, captivated crowned 
heads of Europe and taught the rumba to the Prince of Wales, Josephine 
Baker and a generation of Depression-weary revelers. OK, it wasn't 
the rumba. As purists never tire of pointing out, the dance by that 
name that swept America and Europe in the 1930s and became an Arthur 
Murray staple was such a tame, watered-down version of the Afro-Cuban 
original that it was closer to a dance the Cubans call the son. Never 
mind. The authentic street rumba of Havana, whose extravagant, explicit 
gestures seem more suggestive of mating than of a mating dance, is 
not something one would have actually wanted to do on a dance floor 
before the 1980s, or ever on stage. Whatever its pedigree, in Miss 
Parla's hands, or rather hips, the dance the world came to know as 
the rumba was such an appealing sight that she and it became overnight 
sensations. For Miss Parla, at least, it took some doing. A native 
of Havana, where her father was a prominent doctor, she attended a 
convent school in Key West, Fla., then moved to New York with her 
mother during a period of political instability in Cuba in the 1920s. 
Fortunately, as she pointed out in a 1995 interview with John Dorschner 
of The Miami Herald, her father, a man so strict that he would never 
have countenanced dancing as a career, stayed behind in Havana. Not 
that her mother was not strict, too. From the time she was 9, Miss 
Parla recalled, her mother warned her almost daily that if she did 
not remain a virgin she would never find a man to marry her. It was 
advice that Miss Parla seems to have taken to heart, in part, perhaps, 
because her admitted teen-age ambition was to marry a millionaire. 
Her father had other ideas, insisting that his daughter obtain a measure 
of self-sufficiency by learning to type, ``until a millionaire comes 
along, as he put it.'' A dutiful daughter, Miss Parla obliged, but 
since she was a little girl her real passion had been dancing, and 
when a man who ran a dance studio in her apartment building marveled 
at how good she was, she began to get the notion that she might actually 
become a professional. She got her chance in 1931 after she began 
working as a 17-year-old cigarette girl at a Greenwich Village nightclub, 
a job she was able to take over her mother's objections only after 
promising never to let her father know, agreeing to let her mother 
serve as on-the-job chaperone and threatening suicide, something Miss 
Parla did with alarming regularity throughout her life. Then came 
the inevitable night that the club's Spanish dancer became ill. Miss 
Parla volunteered to take her place, and she was such a hit and gained 
such confidence that when the celebrated Cuban band leader Don Azpiazu 
issued a call for a rumba dancer for a gig at the Paramount a few 
weeks later, Miss Parla tried out, along with 150 other hopefuls, 
and got the job. During rehearsals she was paired with a man, but 
she found him so clumsy and the whole experience so embarrassing that 
she persuaded Azpiazu to let her dance alone, as she did from then 
on. ``The rumba is very sexual,'' she explained, ``and I didn't like 
doing it with a partner.'' The decision may well have been crucial 
in allowing the rumba's eventual acceptance by a puritanical world, 
since for all Miss Parla's sensuous gyrations, the sight of a woman 
dancing alone was simply not as sexually suggestive as a couple dancing 
together. It was the Paramount engagement that helped make the Azpiazu 
recording of ``El Manisero'' (``The Peanut Vendor'') a national hit 
and the foundation of the rumba craze of the 1930s. After touring 
the United States with the Azpiazu orchestra (a musician's wife serving 
as her chaperone), then dancing with another orchestra at the Tavern 
on the Green in Central Park, Miss Parla (and her mother) joined Azpiazu 
for a European tour in 1932. It was during an engagement in Monte 
Carlo that Miss Parla caught the eye of two future kings of England, 
Edward, the Prince of Wales, and his brother Albert, the Duke of York, 
who later became King George VI. The next day Edward summoned Miss 
Parla to his villa to teach him the rumba, as she did (with her mother 
tagging along). ``He got it,'' she said. ``He was very good.'' When 
another of her Monte Carlo conquests, Maurice Chevalier, asked her 
to go to Nice with him for the night, Miss Parla declined, saying, 
as she recalled, ``Oh, Mr. Chevalier, I'm so sorry. I'm a virgin.'' 
For all her triumph in Monte Carlo, Miss Parla was hardly prepared 
for what happened when she opened in Paris that July. When she made 
her entrance walking down a grand staircase wearing a slave scarf 
and a costume decorated in red, white and blue, the colors of the 
Cuban flag, the crowd went wild, she recalled, and began shouting 
``Vive La France.'' Miss Parla later learned that it was Bastille 
Day and that the crowd had taken it as a tribute to France when she 
appeared wearing the colors of the French flag. The next day, she 
was hailed by critics as ``the Cuban Mariana,'' (the French Uncle 
Sam, she was told) and the name stuck. Within weeks, ``Mariana scarfs,'' 
copied from her costume, were on sale in chic French shops, Miss Parla 
had taught Josephine Baker to rumba and had made a side trip to Brussels, 
Belgium, where King Leopold was so enchanted he gave her a box of 
chocolates so big she danced on it for him. After a triumphant return 
to the United States aboard the Ile de France in 1933, Miss Parla 
spent a year dancing at Mon Paris nightclub, where she was hailed 
by Walter Winchell as ``that lovely Havana torso flipper.'' Finally 
bowing to her father's wishes, she returned to Havana at the end of 
1934 and married a few months later. She was not yet 21, but her reign 
as the Queen of the Rumba was over. After her first husband, the playboy 
son of a wealthy rancher, discovered he couldn't keep her down on 
the finca after she'd seen Paree, Miss Parla obtained a divorce and 
later married Guillermo Amuchastegui, a celebrated jai alai player 
who took her all over the world, and she hobnobbed with the likes 
of Orson Welles and Esther Williams (when she wasn't in Cuba hobnobbing 
with Ernest Hemingway). When Fidel Castro seized power in 1959, Miss 
Parla, by then married to a Batista government official, fled to the 
United States and settled in Miami. To make ends meet the former Queen 
of the Rumba, her father's daughter to the end, spent 20 years working 
as a typist. Miss Parla is survived by a daughter, Ileana Comas, and 
a sister, Zilia Navarete, both of Miami, and two grandsons.
