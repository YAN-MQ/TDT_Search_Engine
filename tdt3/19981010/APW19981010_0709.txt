Facing plans for dueling rallies by the ruling and opposition parties, 
Lesotho's king asked protesters to leave his royal palace on Saturday 
in a radio address that appealed for unity. King Letsie III's message 
came as the ruling and opposition parties were preparing separate 
rallies for Sunday. Upheaval in the tiny mountain kingdom surrounded 
by South Africa began in early August, when opposition parties blockaded 
streets in the capital of Maseru and moved onto the palace grounds. 
About 100 protesters remained camped on the grounds at the time of 
the king's radio address. Scores were killed after last month's South 
African-led intervention to end an army mutiny and paralyzing protests 
by the opposition, which charged May elections won by the Lesotho 
Congress for Democracy were rigged. The military action came under 
the auspices of the Southern African Development Community. The king 
stressed the need for Lesotho's politicians to put aside their differences 
in deference to the interests of the nation. ``This should be done 
so that future generations should find a peaceful and stable nation,'' 
he said. ``It is our responsibility to ensure that this dream becomes 
a reality.'' The ruling Lesotho Congress for Democracy and opposition 
leaders planned separate rallies on Sunday, but few details were available. 
Lesotho Congress for Democracy deputy leader Kelebone Maope said he 
was convinced his party would win new elections that could be held 
in 15 to 18 months. ``We will be telling (the rally) that it is important 
that these troops stay here so that they can secure a democratically 
elected government to be in office,'' Maope said. Opposition alliance 
spokesman Vincent Malebo said leaders on Sunday would encourage their 
supporters to ``fight on to the end.'' The two sides are to meet on 
Wednesday with representatives of the Southern African Development 
Community, a 14-nation coalition, to discuss peaceful resolution.
