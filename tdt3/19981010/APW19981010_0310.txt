On the last day of his visit to this former British colony, Prime 
Minister Tony Blair faced criticism from some Hong Kong legislators 
Saturday over Britain's go-soft approach on China. The legislators 
said the good relations Blair had engineered with China were good 
for Hong Kong. But the territory's democracy advocates said a gentler 
approach on human rights in favor of profitable commercial ties sends 
the ``wrong message.'' ``The kind of message he delivered is not strong 
enough,'' said legislator Yeung Sum of the major opposition Democratic 
Party. Among the topics discussed during the closed-door meeting between 
Blair and the lawmakers were human rights in China and the pace of 
democracy in Hong Kong. Independent legislator Margaret Lee said after 
the briefing that she had reservations about Blair's subdued approach 
in raising sticky issues with Chinese leaders about political dissent 
and human rights in favor of wider trade and investment ties with 
Beijing. ``If going softly means resorting to euphemism and avoiding 
sharp issues then I'm not in favor of it,'' she added. Newspapers 
were more cautious. The Chinese-language Oriental Daily said cooperation 
with the mainland was ``more intelligent'' than the headstrong approach 
taken by Hong Kong's last British Gov. Chris Patten. Sino-British 
relations previous to Hong Kong's handover 15 months ago were marked 
by pointed exchanges between Patten and Beijing on a wide range of 
issues, including wider freedoms and civil liberties for the people 
of Hong Kong. In an editorial, The South China Morning Post said, 
``It was almost possible to forget the long years that Beijing and 
London spent locked in battles of the handover.'' On Friday, Blair 
told Hong Kong business leaders that relations with Britain were entering 
``a new era'' with strong personal relations between the leaders of 
the two countries and growing commercial ties. ``Britain's influence 
in Hong Kong has waned, but Blair's encouraging remarks are still 
worth listening to,'' said the Chinese-language Apple Daily on Saturday. 
Britain and China announced a ``comprehensive partnership'' at the 
outset of Blair's five-day visit to the mainland. The visit to China 
_ the first by a British prime minister in seven years _ ended much 
of the suspicion and bitterness over Hong Kong's transition to Chinese 
rule. After meeting with the legislators, the prime minister and his 
wife visited a 64-year old Buddhist nunnery between the hills of Kowloon 
and the sea, known for helping the poor and elderly. Blair concluded 
his visit with a tour of a British-sponsored exhibition of digital 
technology at the Pacific Place shopping mall near downtown Hong Kong. 
He was greeted by a large number of well-wishers who shook his hand.
