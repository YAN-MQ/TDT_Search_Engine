Artashez Adamian missed just wide of the right right post in the 81st 
minute, leaving Armenia with a 0-0 draw with Iceland in the second 
European Championship 2000 qualifier for both teams. Armenia was more 
active in the first half of the game but failed to break Iceland's 
defense. It took more of the initiative when Tigran Yesaian, who scored 
two goals in its first game against Andorra, entered as a substitute 
in the 70th. He fed Adamian with a pinpoint pass in the 81st minute, 
but Adamian failed to finish. The result before only 17,0000 in Ararat 
Stadium left Armenia with a 1-1-0 record and four points in Group 
4. The draw was Iceland's second in two games. ___ Lineups Armenia:
