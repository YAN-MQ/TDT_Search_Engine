If focus of the radio address was on accomplishments the GOP has made 
since winning a congressional majority in 1994. Representative John 
boehner of Ohio says a lot of the credit that President Clinton is 
taking should be given to republicans or at least shared. It took 
a presidential signature to make bills into law, but it took a republican 
Congress to put them on his desk. This is a challenging time for our 
government. But with all we've accomplished, it's a triumphant time 
for our nation. With a problem Congress, we've proved when you're 
willing to work hard and stay committed to your principles, change 
in Washington really is possible. Now, more than ever, Americans expect 
republicans to lead. And with God's help and your confidence, that's 
exactly what we'll continue to do.
