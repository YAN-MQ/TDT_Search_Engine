Several hours before the American League Championship Series began 
on Tuesday, all the Cleveland Indians were corralled in their clubhouse 
before batting practice. All but one. Jim Thome kept pacing the corridor 
beneath Yankee Stadium. ``How cold is it out there, Cleveland-like 
cold?'' he asked a few hallway loiterers. He continued to pace while 
whirling a bat in his hand until it was the Indians' turn at batting 
practice. As Thome stood on the field, with the red-white-and-blue 
bunting in the background, he looked around and displayed a smile 
as big as a half moon. ``This is what it is all about,'' Thome said. 
``You cannot beat this.'' His enthusiasm was pure as he began this 
series, and it never wavered, no matter how disappointing his at-bats. 
Even after he struck out once in Game 1 and three times in Game 2, 
he refused to get frustrated or uptight and kept on swinging freely 
until something connected in Game 3 against the Yankees Friday night. 
Thome wheeled his sturdy frame and made contact with two Andy Pettitte 
fastballs, both of which ended up over the wall and into a roaring 
crowd in right field at Jacobs Field. Thome's two home runs _ one 
a solo shot estimated at 421 feet in the second inning, the other 
a two-run rainbow estimated at 369 feet in the fifth inning _ put 
the Indians firmly in control to win Game 3, 6-1, and they helped 
provide Cleveland with a 2-1 lead in the series. ``To be honest, I've 
been having a hard time with left-handed pitching lately,'' said Thome, 
whose right hand was fractured by a pitch on Aug. 7, causing him to 
miss a month of playing time. ``They've been trying to establish the 
fastball inside. I was fortunate tonight to get ahead in the count 
and get a good pitch to hit. I've been having such a hard time lately 
that it wasn't on my mind to hit two home runs. I was just trying 
to put it in play.'' This is as good as Thome has looked since returning 
to the lineup on Sept. 16. He finished the last 12 games of the season 
hitting .195 with one home run. ``I saw a palm reader, so I knew,'' 
manager Mike Hargrove joked when asked if he knew Thome was ready 
to break out. ``No, Jimmy is a good hitter. Look over his career and 
see what he has done.'' Thome has always had a knack for the home 
run. In the fifth inning, his second homer barely crept over the wall 
in right. ``The way Paul O'Neill was going back, I didn't know if 
it was going,'' Thome said of the Yankee right fielder. ``I was trying 
to blow it out.'' Thome was one of three Indians to hit homers off 
Pettitte in the fifth inning, which put the Indians ahead, 6-1. Manny 
Ramirez and Mark Whiten joined Thome in their show of power. And it 
was a show, all right, as Thome thrashed his way out of a 1-for-8 
slump through Games 1 and 2. ``When you get good pitching like we 
have lately, it's contagious,'' Thome said. ``The offense just relaxes.'' 
Thome looked at ease despite his recent struggles as he tried to get 
adjusted to swinging the bat with a pad on his healing hand. ``To 
be honest, the pad wasn't really the problem,'' he said. ``It just 
felt like spring training all over again, especially against left-hand 
pitching. The first week back, I was just trying to get a feel for 
everything again. Hitting is about momentum and getting good pitches 
to hit.'' After Cleveland's disastrous loss in Game 1 and its fluke-aided 
victory in Game 2, no one could argue the merits of the Indians victory 
in Game 3. Obviously, they are not daunted by the Yankees. ``We know 
the Yankees have been the team to beat,'' Thome said. ``For us, going 
in you have to bring your game to another level. We've won because 
our pitching has put us in a situation where we could win. After the 
first inning, you could see the momentum shift tonight.'' In the second 
inning, Thome sent up his first home run of the night. It was a release 
of the nervous energy that he had been building for hours before the 
series even began.
