When traveling, there's peak and off-season. But there's also shoulder 
season. Kalin Thomas-Samuel explains in today's "working ahead." Most 
travelers vacation during peak season when the weather's great and 
everything's open -- but prices are high. Budget travelers often make 
plans for the off-season. But the time in between? Welcome to the 
"shoulder season," which some travel experts say is the smartest travel 
time. Shoulder season is a really good time to go to vacation destinations 
and -- and other popular places around the world because you avoid 
the crowds and the high prices of peak season, but you still have 
the good weather and the conditions that are perfect for whatever 
activity you want to do. The trick is pinpointing when shoulder seasons 
fall. Once you have your destination, guidebooks or the Internet can 
tell you peak months for visits and crowds. Hotel rates also offer 
clues. For example, in New York City, if you travel the third week 
of December, most of the hotels slash their rates. Also other cities, 
such as Washington, D.C., if you're traveling after mid-November the 
rates go way down. The end of a holiday period can signal the beginning 
of shoulder season. So find out what the school season is and the 
vacation times for the country you're going to and then avoid those 
times. You know when all the locals have gone home that's when you'll 
have the beach to yourself. The travel industry kind of breathes a 
Sigh of relief, and there are a lot more rooms available. And everyone 
is a little bit more friendly and accommodating. But don't expect 
to find shoulder seasons in places such as Orlando and Las Vegas, 
where conventions keep cities busy year-round. Kalin Thomas-Samuel, 
CNN, reporting.
