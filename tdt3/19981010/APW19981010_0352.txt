In her first match as the new No. 1, Lindsay Davenport had to battle 
hard to beat Arantxa Sanchez-Vicario 7-6 (7-4), 6-4 on Saturday to 
reach the final of the Porsche Grand Prix. Davenport dethroned Martina 
Hingis on Friday, and will be officially No. 1 when the new rankings 
come out Monday. ``I never thought I'd be No. 1 and I was very nervous,'' 
Davenport said. ``It was difficult today, Arantxa was very difficult 
to play.'' Davenport will meet Sandrine Testud of France in Sunday's 
final of the dlrs 450,000 indoor tournament. Sanchez-Vicario is one 
of the seven women to have held the No. 1 before Davenport since the 
computer rankings started in 1975. Serving for the match, Davenport 
had to save three break points. She set up her first match point with 
an ace, but the Spaniard hit a cross-court forehand winner to save 
it. A backhand error by Sanchez-Vicario gave Davenport another match 
point and she blasted a forehand winner to clinch the match. Davenport 
moved into the No. 1 spot when Martina Hingis lost to Dominique Van 
Roost of Belgium 3-6, 7-6 (7-4), 6-4 in the quarterfinals Friday. 
The defeat ended Hingis' 80-week reign in the top spot. But Davenport 
would have claimed the top ranking later in the day anyway when she 
beat Nathalie Tauziat of France 7-6 (7-1), 7-5. ``I haven't really 
grasped it yet,'' said the 22-year-old American. ``I've always wanted 
to win a Grand Slam but No. 1 is something very special. I'm only 
the eighth No. 1, it's very exciting.'' Davenport won the U.S. Open 
last month and has lost only two matches since Wimbledon. Testud ended 
van Roost's run when she crushed the Belgian 6-2, 6-0 in the second 
semifinal Saturday.
