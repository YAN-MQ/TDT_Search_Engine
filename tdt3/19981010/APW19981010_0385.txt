A prominent Cameroonian journalist and publisher has been released 
from prison after President Paul Biya intervened on his behalf, government 
officials said Saturday. Biya ordered the release of Pius Njawe late 
Friday, but gave no explanation for the move, a presidential aide 
said on condition of anonymity. Njawe was sentenced to two years in 
prison after reporting that Biya had heart troubles. The sentence 
was later reduced to one year, which had not yet been completed. Cameroon 
has come under intense pressure from human rights groups for Njawe's 
imprisonment. Although government critics in Cameroon lauded Njawe's 
release, they also pointed out Biya's ability to influence the courts. 
Opposition leaders have long said Cameroon's courts are subject to 
control from the president. It is widely believe Njawe's imprisonment 
was the direct result of Biya's intervention and not through due legal 
process. Last year the Supreme Court of Cameroon ordered Njawe's early 
release from prison on another charge. He had been sentenced to six 
months in prison for libeling Biya and the National Assembly. His 
publication's relentless criticism of Biya has resulted in frequent 
fines and libel cases.
