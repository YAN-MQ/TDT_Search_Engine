As central bank governors, finance ministers and stock exchange chiefs 
meet for the World Economic Forum's East Asian summit starting Monday, 
the two countries in the worst economic straits _ Indonesia and Malaysia 
_ will have only meager representation. Though both countries will 
send their central bankers to the seventh annual East Asian Economic 
Summit, no Cabinet ministers from Malaysia and Indonesia will attend 
the three-day gathering. ``I know that they are all under tremendous 
pressure, given the situation in these two countries,'' Claude Smadja, 
the organization's managing director, said Friday. ``Their participation 
and interaction would have been of tremendous value to these two countries.'' 
Philippines President Joseph Estrada, making his first international 
visit as leader of his country, gives the keynote speech. He will 
also make a quick side trip to the Indonesian island of Batam to meet 
with President B.J. Habibie. The only other head of government attending 
is Singapore Prime Minister Goh Chok Tong. The capital and currency 
controls recently imposed by Malaysia, as well as the political turmoil 
the country is going through, will be a central topic, formally and 
informally, at the conference, Smadja said. ``It is too bad that they 
don't have any of the officials to present their point of view,'' 
Smadja said. One of the missing officials is Anwar Ibrahim, former 
Malaysian deputy prime minister and finance minister, who had committed 
in July to addressing the conference. Anwar was fired and mounted 
an unprecedented popular challenge to the 17-year rule of Prime Minister 
Mahathir Mohamad. Anwar was arrested Sept. 20 and charged with illegal 
homosexual acts and corruption. This year's gathering is also devoid 
of some top-ranking European officials. The highest European official 
on the agenda, Danish Finance Minister Mogens Lykketoft, canceled 
just ahead of the meeting. ``I am very disappointed,'' Smadja said. 
The conference will include economic reports by the East Asian countries, 
panel discussions, speeches and networking meals on how what actions 
are needed to fix Asia's economic mess.
