The Rev. Calvin Butts III, the pastor of Abyssinian Baptist Church 
in Harlem and a Democrat who has forged close ties to Gov. George 
Pataki during the last four years, will endorse the Republican governor's 
steamrolling drive for re-election on Sunday, aides to Pataki said. 
Pataki has been invited to address Butts' congregation at noon, the 
aides said, and at a joint news conference afterward, Butts is scheduled 
to announce his endorsement, the first of the governor's campaign 
by a major black leader in the state. While Pataki has a 2-to-1 lead 
in the polls over his Democratic rival, the New York City Council 
Speaker Peter Vallone, an endorsement by Butts was regarded as a trophy 
for Pataki, whose administration has financed several Harlem development 
projects supported by the minister and his church. ``Clearly the governor 
is extremely pleased,'' Zenia Mucha, Pataki's spokeswoman, said of 
the endorsement, which was reported Saturday by The New York Daily 
News. ``The governor's commitment to Harlem has resulted in tangible 
building projects and real jobs,'' she added. ``Rev. Butts has a real 
commitment to the betterment of his community and has an enormous 
amount of respect.'' Butts, who supported Mayor Rudolph Giuliani in 
1993 but stunned city officials and black leaders last May by calling 
him a racist on the verge of turning the city into a fascist state, 
has often been an outspoken political maverick, flirting with alternatives 
to established Democrats. While Pataki won only 11 percent of the 
state's black vote in his narrow 1994 victory, he and Butts have since 
nurtured a close alliance. Butts, who has said he was considering 
running for mayor in 2001, has been named to several state boards, 
including the Empire State Development Corp. The Pataki administration 
has financed several Harlem projects along 125th Street including 
a supermarket and retail and entertainment centers. The Abyssinian 
Development Corp., an arm of the Abyssinian Baptist Church, has been 
designated as co-developer of some of the projects. While Butts has 
emphasized that he has no formal role in the corporation, which has 
a separate board of directors, some in Harlem see the corporation's 
selection as a political reward for the support Butts has given Pataki.
