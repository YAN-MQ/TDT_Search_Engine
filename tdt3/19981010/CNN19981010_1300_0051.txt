House members are spending their Saturday indoors. They're on Capitol 
Hill scrambling to put a budget deal together. Lawmakers are itching 
to get home to campaign for the November 3rd elections, but can't 
leave until a deal is finalized. Republican leaders and President 
Clinton have been blaming each other for problems that have prevented 
a deal. A White House official says there are at least 100 points 
of disagreement. Last night Congress passed a temporary spending Bill 
that allows the government to keep running through the weekend. Democrats 
say they're as anxious as the republican colleagues to go home, but 
are committed to staying as long as it takes. Our republican colleagues 
want to adjourn this Congress now, and start a three-month recess. 
Democrats would like to go home, too, especially those of us who are 
running for re-election. But we are committed to staying on the job, 
sfor as long as it takes to deal with the urgent needs facing America's 
public schools and the children who depend on them.
