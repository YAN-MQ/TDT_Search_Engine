In a sense, the Jets will confront their recent past when they face 
the Rams here on Sunday. And they will get to see how their present 
is evolving. The first major deal of the Bill Parcells era was a trade 
with the Rams in which the Jets produced seven players as a byproduct 
of trading the No. 1 choice in the draft to St. Louis. The Rams used 
that top pick to select Orlando Pace, the tackle from Ohio State, 
now the anchor of a solid offensive line. Two of the seven players 
who became Jets, running back Leon Johnson and wide receiver Dedric 
Ward, will have an expanded role on Sunday. The Jets not only have 
to offset running back Curtis Martin's thigh injury (he will probably 
not even get into the game), but they will also be trying to take 
the pressure off quarterback Glenn Foley, who is returning after a 
two-game layoff because of a rib injury _ a problem that apparently 
still bothers him. Johnson and Ward have become very special specialists. 
Johnson is the team's most versatile performer, running or catching 
or returning kicks or making special teams tackles. Ward is the dangerous 
third receiver and has averaged more than 18 yards a reception. He 
also returns punts. And Pace? He is the bulwark of a line blocking 
for runners that average 4.7 yards a carry. But as even Parcells admits, 
sometimes it takes years for trades like these to prove themselves 
one way or another. ``Was I right?'' Parcells asked before answering. 
``I don't know. You just felt there was so much to do in getting the 
Jets righted.'' Pace was the titanic 6-foot-7-inch, 320-pound product 
who was generally considered the finest college player available once 
quarterback Peyton Manning opted to remain at Tennessee for his senior 
season. Indeed, during the 1996 season, Dick Haley, the Jets' draft 
director, suggested that Pace could anchor the position for 10 years 
and then go to the Hall of Fame. But with the Jets coming off a league-worst 
1-15 season, neither Pace nor any other individual was what Parcells 
was looking for. ``I need volume,'' he explained then. Thus, he began 
a series of moves. Parcells traded his top pick for the Rams' first-round 
choice, which was No. 6 overall, and third-, fourth- and seventh-round 
picks. Parcells then took the first-round pick and moved down to the 
eighth spot, trading places with Tampa Bay, who also yielded a fourth-round 
pick in the deal. Parcells wasn't done yet. The third-round choice 
he had obtained from the Rams was exchanged for Denver's lower third-round 
choice, with the Broncos including their sixth- and seventh-round 
picks as part of the exchange. Just like that, one choice became seven. 
And from those seven picks Parcells found four players who are playing 
prominent roles with the Jets: _ Starting linebacker James Farrior, 
the first-rounder. (It is uncertain that he will return from a knee 
injury, which kept him sidelined the last three games, to face the 
Rams.) _ Ward, a third-rounder, is the No. 3 receiver. _ Johnson, 
a fourth-round choice. _ Jason Ferguson, a starting defensive tackle, 
who was the seventh-round selection. The dealing started because Parcells 
and Rams Coach Dick Vermeil trust each other. ``We could make it quick 
because I know what he means,'' Vermeil said. Parcells added, ``When 
we agree on something, that's it.'' Parcells likes to say, ``We got 
lucky with Leon Johnson.'' He also points out: ``Sometimes you've 
got it all in place and there's one player missing. You don't have 
a quarterback.'' So Parcells isn't bragging, just yet, about trading 
away that No. 1 pick. He knows that Pace could wind up in the Hall 
of Fame and those now-flowering Jets could be just a footnote to the 
team's history. But Parcells, whose life is filled with superstitions, 
will not say publicly what he probably believes _ that, for now, things 
have worked out just as he planned.
