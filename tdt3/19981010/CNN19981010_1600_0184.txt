The focus of the weekly republican radio address was on accomplishments 
the GOP has made since winning a congressional majority in 1994. Representative 
John boehner of Ohio said a lot of the credit President Clinton is 
taking should be given to republicans or at least shared. He said 
it took a presidential signature to make bills into law, but it took 
a republican Congress to put them on his desk. This is a challenging 
time for our government. But with all we've accomplished, it's also 
a triumphant time for our nation. With a republican Congress, we've 
proved that when you're willing to work hard and stay committed to 
your principles, change in Washington is really possible. Now, more 
than ever, Americans expect republicans to lead. With God's help and 
your confidence, that's exactly what we'll continue to do.
