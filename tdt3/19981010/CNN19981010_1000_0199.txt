A popular allergy drug is causing a fight on Capitol Hill. Schering-plough, 
the maker of Claritin, is pushing a provision in Congress to extend 
its patent for three years. The company says it wants a chance to 
obtain the same patent extension other drugs were given under a 1984 
law. Its allies in Congress say the extension is fair, since the only 
reason the company didn't get it before was because of bureaucratic 
red tape. Opponents say it's an example of special interests manipulating 
Congress.
