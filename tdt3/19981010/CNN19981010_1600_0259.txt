Plans for using military force against Serbian forces in the Yugoslav 
province of Kosovo are moving forward. Six U.S. B-52 bombers are being 
dispatched from an air force base in Louisiana to England. They are 
armed with air-launched cruise missiles. Sea and ground-based aircraft 
are standing by in the region. The secretary general of NAto says 
the Serbians are not complying with United Nations resolutions and 
NAto is getting closer TO launching a strike.
