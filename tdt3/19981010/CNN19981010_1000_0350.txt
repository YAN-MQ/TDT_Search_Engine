A new law has some immigrants worried they may be shipped back to 
their native countries even if they've been here legally for decades. 
Aram Roston has the story. Charles naghisi has lived in the U.S. for 
11 years. Has a green card and drives a truck for a living. He's concerned 
a new law will put him in an immigration and naturalization cell, 
awaiting deportation to Nigeria. New provisions of a 1996 immigration 
law took effect Friday. They call for the INS to detain and deport 
noncitizens convicted of a wide variety of crimes. If we encounter 
those individuals, we must take them into custody. Naghisi is one 
of them. He pleaded guilty to misdemeanor assault four years ago. 
If I leave this country, an entire family is ruined. Many human rights 
activists and immigration attorneys say these provisions are simply 
too rigid. You are out of here forever regardless of if you pay taxes, 
regardless of whether you go to church, regardless of whether you 
own property or whether you have been here 30 or 40 or 50 years, or 
2 years. If you start making exceptions to that rule, there are a 
lit of immigration lawyers with fertile minds who would start driving 
a truck through that loophole. Still, the INS says there are up to 
300,000 people out there who may fit the Bill. The agency can't catch 
them all. And if it did, there's nowhere to put them. The inS keeps 
people in custody in its own detention centers, in prisons and in 
county jails where it rents space. It says it has the capacity to 
hold 16,000 people, and all of those spaces are filled. For now, the 
inS says it plans no mass roundups and will only lock up those criminal 
aliens it comes in contact with. Aram Roston, CNN, Atlanta.
