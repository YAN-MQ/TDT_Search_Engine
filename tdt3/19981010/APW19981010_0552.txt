Croatia came from behind to beat modest Malta 4-1 on Saturday in a 
Group 8 qualifying match for the 2000 European Championship. The Maltese, 
who have usually served as a punching bag for Europe's top teams, 
parried admirably and often caught the Croat backline dozing off. 
But they crumbled after the interval despite a 1-0 lead earned by 
Hubert Suda on a 28th-minute penalty kick. The Croats, who were forced 
to field a below optimal-strength side due to injuries and suspensions, 
struggled to recover from the early blow and were unable to take control 
until coach Miroslav Blazevic reshuffled his ranks at the break. Defender 
Dario Simic traveled forward and hit the Maltese net with a header 
in the 54th minute. Davor Vugrinec, making his debut, scored twice 
in the next 20 minutes, while master poacher and World Cup top scorer, 
Davor Suker, added the final goal with a crisp header in the 80th 
minute. Croatia won third place in the World Cup in France last summer, 
but the early hiccups against Malta revealed that the side has had 
trouble maintaining the form that vaulted it to the top of world soccer. 
Croatia lost to the Republic of Ireland 2-0 in its opening qualifying 
match. ---- Lineups Malta: Mario Muscat, Carmel Busuttil, Darren Debono,
