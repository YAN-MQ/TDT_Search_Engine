When Edward DeBartolo Jr., the opulent co-owner of the San Francisco 
49ers, was reportedly about to be indicted in December by a federal 
grand jury in Louisiana investigating riverboat casino licensing and 
other business arrangements, he suddenly resigned as the 49ers' chairman. 
He also issued a statement. ``I am thankful,'' it read, ``for the 
support of my wife, my children, my family and my friends. They know, 
as I do, that these things simply are not true. I look forward to 
the time when I can address these issues and tell my side of the story.'' 
But when that time arrived, ``these things'' turned out to be true 
_ notably $400,000 in new $100 bills DeBartolo handed former Gov. 
Edwin Edwards of Louisiana for his influence in the Gaming Board's 
granting a casino license in 1997 to the Hollywood Casino Corp., which 
included DeBartolo as an investor. After cutting a deal with federal 
prosecutors to provide evidence against Edwards, the 51-year-old man 
known as Eddie D. pleaded guilty Tuesday in Baton Rouge to concealing 
an alleged extortion plot by Edwards. Under the terms of the plea 
agreement, Judge John Parker sentenced Eddie D. to two years' probation 
and ordered that he pay a $250,000 fine, forfeit to the federal government 
the $400,000 he paid Edwards and provide up to $350,000 in restitution 
that might be claimed by anyone hurt by the crime. The financial penalties 
add up to $1 million, merely a drop out of Eddie D.'s bucket. According 
to Forbes magazine's new list of America's 400 richest people, he 
is worth $830 million. But all those millions won't buy what Eddie 
D. wants most now: ``getting my football team back,'' as he said after 
his sentencing. All those millions didn't stop Commissioner Paul Tagliabue 
from directing him to remain inactive with the 49ers and the National 
Football League through the 1998 season. And all those millions, it 
is hoped, won't prevent the commissioner from swatting Eddie D. with 
the George Steinbrenner yardstick for in-house punishment among club-owner 
felons: a two-year suspension. Indicted in 1974 on 14 felony counts 
that his American Shipbuilding Co. had covered up corporate contributions 
to the Nixon re-election committee and that he had obstructed justice, 
Steinbrenner, the Yankees' principal owner, eventually pleaded guilty 
to one felony count of conspiracy as well as to one count of illegal 
campaign contributions. After being fined $15,000 (AmShip was fined 
$20,000), Steinbrenner was suspended from baseball for two years by 
Commissioner Bowie Kuhn. As long as telephones exist, a club owner 
can't be completely banned from making franchise decisions. During 
Steinbrenner's exile, the Yankees signed right-hander Jim ``Catfish'' 
Hunter to the first of the lavish free-agent contracts. The principal 
owner wasn't allowed to charm Hunter, but he surely approved the $3.35 
million package. When Harold Ballard, the major-domo of hockey's Toronto 
Maple Leafs, was convicted of tax evasion, his prison sentence was 
postponed until after the 1972 Canada-Soviet Union series. And during 
his three years in prison, it was an open secret that he continued 
to pull the strings on every Maple Leaf decision. DeBartolo's situation 
is different. If and when Edwards is indicted, DeBartolo would very 
likely be called to testify in the trial. Should that happen, Edwards' 
lawyers are very likely to be hard on the man Edwards has called ``the 
Linda Tripp of Louisiana.'' In what is expected to be an ugly trial, 
the NFL would surely prefer a suspended 49er owner to be on the stand, 
not an active or even inactive 49er owner. As for Eddie D.'s influence 
on the 49ers, a telephone isn't enough anymore. His sister, Denise 
DeBartolo York, who is worth $820 million, (according to Forbes magazine) 
and who took over after Eddie D.'s resignation, will continue as the 
49ers' chairwoman, but their relationship is described, politely, 
as strained. Long before Eddie D.'s guilty plea, his profile in the 
49er media guide had wisely been changed. In last year's guide, he 
was described as having earned ``considerable stature and esteem'' 
for managing an NFL franchise that has operated with ``class and dignity'' 
while winning a record five Super Bowl championships. This year, he 
is described only as the chief executive officer from 1977 to 1997, 
who ``saw his primary role as one of providing emotional and financial 
support for his players and coaches,'' and who is praised as a ``players' 
owner.'' All that stature and esteem, all that class and dignity disappeared 
in the swamp of a Louisiana scandal.
