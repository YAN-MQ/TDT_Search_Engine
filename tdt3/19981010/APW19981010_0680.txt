A driver and his co-pilot taking part in a local auto rally in Austria's 
Styria province were killed Saturday when their Fiat Cinquecento veered 
off the course at a curve, the Austria Press Agency reported. The 
car of Bernhard Geramb, 35, and his companion Christian Neuhold spun 
out of control at a point where the surface changed from pavement 
to gravel. The two drivers died at the site of the accident before 
being transported to a hospital. The accident occurred near Selzthal 
in the southern Styria province. The competition was suspended after 
the accident. Geramb was an experienced pilot who took part in international 
events this season, including the Monte Carlo Rally, APA said. It 
was the second fatal accident in an Austrian auto rally event this 
season. During a race on May 9, two German competitors were killed 
when their car collided with a wall.
