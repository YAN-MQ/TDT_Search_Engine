Nobody knows _ or at least no one is saying _ who pulled the seemingly 
impossible prank of impaling a pumpkin on a bell tower at Cornell 
University last October, creating a five-month media sensation and 
an enduring mystery. But with Halloween now just three weeks away, 
Cornell officials want to make sure that he or she or they do not 
do it again. The fear is that placing a pumpkin atop the 173-foot 
tower's steeply pitched metal roof might become an annual prank. And 
with the tower surrounded by scaffolding this year, its roof is more 
accessible than ever. And so, several weeks ago, Cornell officials 
quietly began planning anti-pumpkin measures. The strategy is almost 
as much of a secret as the identity of _ and technique used by _ last 
year's prankster. ``We are taking some precautions because we're concerned 
about people's safety,'' said Linda Grace-Kobas, a senior university 
spokeswoman. ``But we cannot get into exactly what we're doing.'' 
Ms. Grace-Kobas said only that campus police had already wired ``sensitive 
areas'' in the vicinity of the bell tower with alarms. She refused 
to rule out the possibility that the school had other precautions 
in store, including a heightened police presence around the tower 
and newly installed alarms in and around other tall campus buildings. 
``That would be giving away a little too much information to anyone 
making any plans,'' Ms. Grace-Kobas said with a chuckle. In March, 
after hundreds of onlookers watched Cornell provost Don Randel remove 
the pumpkin from its lofty perch in a rescue attempt, it was placed 
on display in a glass museum case in the lobby of the school's main 
administration building. But the pumpkin quickly decomposed in its 
new surroundings, and after three months on display, school officials 
decided it was time to put the pumpkin in storage.
