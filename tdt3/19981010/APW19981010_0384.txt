A rebel decision to unilaterally extend a cease-fire by three months 
is only a pretext to cover troop movements and training, Sudan's army 
spokesman was quoted as saying Saturday. ``We in the armed forces 
believe the cease-fire will benefit the rebellion movement'' because 
the rebels will use the time to prepare for future combats, Lt. Gen. 
Abdul-Rahman Sirul-Khatim said in an interview with the daily Al-Rai 
Al-Akher. The rebel Sudan People's Liberation Army said Thursday that 
it will extend by another three months the current three-month cease-fire 
when it end Wednesday to allow relief food to reach civilians in war 
provinces like Bahr el-Ghazal in the south. Khartoum has not officially 
responded to the announcement, and Sirul-Khatim's comments are the 
first from a government official on the cease-fire. Sirul-Khatim, 
however, indicated that the ``government has its position on this 
(cease-fire).'' Sudan has been embroiled in a civil war for 15 years 
with Christian and animist rebels fighting for more autonomy from 
the Muslim, Arab north. About 1.5 million people have died in the 
war and related famines caused by food and medical supplies being 
held up by the fighting.
