Another team not hitting -- the Atlanta Braves heavily favored going 
in, they find themselves down 2-0 in the nlcs. Greg Maddux gets the 
call. He'll face sterling hitchcock this afternoon. This series is 
far from over. And we know that having been on both sides of the coin. 
So, you know, we need to realize that and forget about what's happening 
and get ready to play Saturday and try to win a game Saturday and, 
you know, go on from there. It's nice to have two wins there, but, 
you know, we're still two wins away from beating the Atlanta Braves 
and we know that. And we have to keep going hard.
