Per-Ulrik Johansson missed a 3-foot putt at the last to hand victory 
to John Daly and Tiger Woods carded a match-winning 66 Saturday as 
the United States pounced on Swedish mistakes to make the semifinal 
of the Dunhill Cup. Johansson came to the last all square with Daly 
and both players left themselves short birdie putts to force a playoff. 
But the Swede missed and Daly, who made 71, scored his seventh victory 
in two Dunhill Cup competitions to put the Americans 1-0 ahead. Mark 
O'Meara, at one stage two down to Patrick Sjoland, wound up tied with 
the Swede on a 4-under 68 and Woods, playing last, gained a 7-stroke 
victory over Mathias Gronberg despite missing a 3-foot putt for bogey 
at the first. Woods' 66 went with the 66 he scored against England 
on Thursday and 70 against Japan on Friday. After three rounds at 
the home of golf, he is 14 under par. Daly, despite an eagle two at 
the 12th, was level with four to play and, with O'Meara behind, it 
looked tricky for the star-studded American team. But Sjoland squandered 
a great chance to go two head of O'Meara at the 16th, where he mishit 
an 8-foot birdie putt to leave it a foot short and the American captain 
got back level when Sjoland needed three shots to make the green at 
17. In Sunday's semifinal, which will be followed by the final, the 
American trio will face either Scotland, led by Colin Montgomerie, 
or Spain, which has Jose Maria Olazabal on the lineup. Second seed 
Australia gained the semifinal despite losing 2-1 to New Zealand. 
Craig Parry gave the Australians the lead with a 70 and a 1-stroke 
victory over Michael Long. But Greg Turner edged Stuart Appleby by 
one and Frank Nobilo, who has playing Dunhill Cup golf for New Zealand 
since the competition started in 1985, downed Steve Elkington by two 
after a level par 72. The Australians, who advanced because they had 
better results in their previous two Group 4 matches, will meet either 
defending titlist South Africa or third seed Zimbabwe in the semifinal.
