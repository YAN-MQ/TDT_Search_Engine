Carolina Panthers quarterback Kerry Collins' career took a stunning 
turn this week when he showed up in the office of coach Dom Capers, 
said he no longer wanted to start for the Panthers and asked for a 
trade. What Collins did _ basically quitting on the team _ shocked 
the organization to its core. Collins has sealed his fate in Carolina, 
and next season he will either be with another team or out of football. 
Friday, the Panthers deactivated Collins for Sunday's game in Dallas, 
but said he would rejoin the team next week. ``I felt it would be 
better for our football team to not have the distraction of having 
Kerry with us on the sideline after what transpired,'' Capers said. 
Collins, who has not spoken with reporters since his meeting with 
Capers, was blasted by some of his teammates after they heard of his 
requests. One player, who asked not to be identified, said he never 
wanted to play with Collins again. Another was angry but more understanding. 
``He has quit on us,'' said offensive lineman Frank Garcia. ``But 
that's the best decision for him, and I'm going to support him in 
that decision and move on.'' But the real question is why? Inside 
the Panthers' organization, there is silence when scouts and personnel 
men are asked about Collins. They only say that there is more to the 
story, but they will not elaborate. The only comments have come from 
Capers, who said: ``His heart wasn't totally into what he was doing. 
He said he felt like he disappointed the team.'' The Panthers are 
attempting to trade Collins before Tuesday's 4 p.m. trading deadline, 
but because of his history of problems on the field and off, they 
will not get much. On the field, Collins led the league last year 
with 21 interceptions and this year already had 6. He has completed 
just 47 percent of his passes, and ranks 22nd in the league in passing 
with a quarterback rating of 70.8. The Panthers, who just two seasons 
ago were in the National Football Conference Championship game, are 
0-4. Off the field, Collins created problems for himself last season 
by using a racial slur about a black teammate. When the Panthers contacted 
almost a dozen teams this week about trading Collins, they were rejected 
each time. nn
