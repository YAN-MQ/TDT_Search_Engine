The national league championship series picks up Saturday afternoon 
in San Diego. The padres lead Atlanta two games to none. The Braves 
will start Greg Maddux on the mound in game three. Padres will counter 
with sterling hitchcock. We feel we have a pretty good staff here, 
too. No one expected sterling to step up and do the job he's done 
this year. And since I have been over here, you know, we've worked 
real well together. Things have gone good. And I think if you put 
our four starters up against theirs, it's pretty even.
