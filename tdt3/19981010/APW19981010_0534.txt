Prime Minister Yevgeny Primakov said Saturday that he opposed early 
presidential elections because they could lead to instability in the 
country. President Boris Yeltsin's opponents have been calling for 
the president to step down, and some have tried to launch impeachment 
proceedings against him. On Thursday, parliamentary speaker Gennady 
Seleznyov suggested holding a referendum on whether Yeltsin should 
resign, even though such a move would violate Russian law. Primakov 
told Russian reporters that early elections ``can result in a situation 
which will not facilitate stabilization in society,'' the ITAR-Tass 
news agency reported. ``On the contrary, it will lead to division 
and whip up political passions,'' ITAR-Tass quoted him as saying. 
Yeltsin has repeatedly affirmed his intention to serve out the two 
years remaining in his term. He has also said he won't run again in 
the 2000 elections.
