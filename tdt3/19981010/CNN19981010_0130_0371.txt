Independent counsel Ken Starr could be called as a witness in the 
impeachment hearings against president Clinton. Independent counsel 
Ken Starr could be called as a witness in the impeachment hearings 
against President Clinton. Republicans have apparently dropped their 
opposition to the idea, which clears the way for Starr to join other 
possible prominent witnesses, including Linda Tripp and Monica Lewinsky. 
Impeachment hearings won't begin until after the November congressional 
elections. Next week, President Clinton's lawyers will meet with staff 
for the house Judiciary committee in advance of the inquiry. He will 
work with the committee. The committee has yet to sit down and meet 
and decide how they're going to move forward. We will go up and meet 
with them next week to figure out how we'll work with them and listen 
to them, and how they plan to move forward. The house voted Thursday 
to begin a formal impeachment inquiry against President Clinton.
