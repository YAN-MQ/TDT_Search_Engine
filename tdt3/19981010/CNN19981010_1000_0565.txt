Potential problems from the year 2000 bug are more than a year away. 
Even so, many people fear the worst, and are busy with preparations. 
Rusty Dornin has the story. I have a battery, more batteries up here. 
And then I store food and grains seasonings and stuff like that. Lindsay 
dragon of Santa Rosa, California, is stockpiling everything from batteries 
and propane to food and water, preparing for what she believes could 
be disaster on January 1st, 2000. She's not alone. If the news is 
not good -- In Churches and community center, folks are gathering, 
fearful that there will be computer chaos when the millennium rolls 
around. Many computers will malfunction or simply crash. Called Y2K, 
or "the millennium bug," some fear that computer malfunctions will 
shut off power, cut off water supplies and disable ATMs and a host 
of other possible calamities. If people go to buy their food and there's 
no transportation to supply more food then we don't have food. The 
Internet is buzzing with people heading to the hills, fearing the 
apocalypse. At these meetings, the topic is not running away or hysteria, 
but community preparedness. We can demand the utilities disclose their 
co-compliance and where they are on repairing their systems. For some 
it's too frightening to dismiss. It's an eye opener. It has me very 
worried. On Capitol Hill, senators are taking the problem. The worst 
case scenario that the telephone companies, the power grid goes down, 
the telephone companies don't work, you can't get a dial Tone and 
that other utilities like water fail. What they can do if they feel 
afraid of it happening is to get prepared. Small portable battery 
systems, Hang-cranked radios, generator systems. a litany of items 
for disasters that may or may not happen. So what if nothing happens? 
We've formed community. We've got new alliances. We've met the neighbors. 
After all, say many Y2K activists, there's nothing wrong with communities 
being prepared for the possibility of a disaster, natural or man-made.
