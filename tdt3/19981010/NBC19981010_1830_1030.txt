"in focus" this evening, what the government now knows about osama 
bin ladin nbc's rick davis has our report. he is a sometimes cave 
dweller with millions of dollars to spend. osama bin ladin was born 
into the moneyed elite of saudi arabia but considers that nation an 
enemy for having what he calls "infidels," the u.s. military, on it's 
soil during desert storm and now. osama bin laden is really representative 
of a new phenomenon called individual terrorism. and so he is not 
state sponsored in the way that terrorists in the '70s and '80s, and 
much of the '90s were state sponsored. but this federal indictment 
charges bin laden has terrorist cells or is linked to terrorist groups 
in at least 26 named countries, including the united states. according 
to the indictment in 1992, bin ladin ordered a fatwah, a death sentence 
for u.s. troops serving in somalia. it claims his followers trained 
the clansmen who killed 18 u.s. soldiers on october 3, 1993. those 
deaths and other charges were part of the case against these three 
men in a new york federal court this week. mohammed rased al owhali 
and mohammed odeh are accused of murder. the third man wadih ahage 
was indicted for conspiracy to attack u.s. citizens aboard. they are 
in jail, awaiting trial. also, indicted, fazul mohammed. he is accused 
of direct involvement in the planning and the bombing of the u.s. 
embassy in kenya. the indictment states that mohamed rashed al owhali 
took part in the operation. and that mohamed odeh help plan the bombing. 
all three face the death penalty if convicted. wadih al hage could 
get life in prison even though he is accused only of lying about his 
knowledge of bin laden's operations. according to the indictment, 
the texas tire dealer was once bin ladin personal secretary. but bin 
laden's top lieutenants are still at large. and replacements for the 
operatives who have been caught are not hard to find. there's no deficit 
of willing young men who are islamic extremists willing to be recruited 
into these organizations. we have to be worried about threats to the 
united states. bin laden is out there. he's wounded. he's angry. they 
admit osama bin laden will be hard to capture bout the help of the 
afghan government which so far is protecting him.
