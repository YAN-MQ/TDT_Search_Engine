The party of Thailand's former prime minister has filed a defamation 
complaint against three academics and a newspaper over an article 
that alleged the party is corrupt, police said on Saturday. The academics, 
Pasuk Phongphaichitr, Sungsidh Piriyarangsan and Nuannoi Preerat were 
interviewed by Prachachart Turakij newspaper in its Oct. 5-7 editions 
in which they made references to a survey by the Counter Corruption 
Commission, a government agency. They survey found that most Thais 
believe the 1996-97 coalition government led by Chavalit Yongchaiyudh 
and his New Aspiration Party was the most corrupt in Thailand's history. 
The complaint, which police said they will investigate, alleges that 
the academics and newspaper were ill-intentioned and intended to mislead 
the people into believing the NAP is corrupt, said a police officer 
who spoke only on condition of anonymity. Results of such police investigations 
are usually used as ammunition for a lawsuit. The professors, who 
teach at the Center for Politics and the Economy at Bangkok's Chulalongkorn 
University, specialize in studies on corruption and the underground 
economy. They have come under attack in the past from politicians 
and also the police, who tried to intimidate Sungsidh and filed their 
own defamation lawsuit against him after he wrote a report saying 
officers were taking payoffs from and also running illegal casinos.
