Hardwood floors, often the most visible and vulnerable blend of form 
and function in a house, inevitably take a beating over time. And 
when that happens, flooring experts say, homeowners usually have two 
basic options: refinish what's there or cover it with something else. 
``There's more than one way to refinish a floor,'' said Walter Sedovic, 
an architect based in Irvington, N.Y. Sedovic, who recently refinished 
half a dozen floors in his four-story house in Bronxville, N.Y., said 
that the kind of refinishing job that hardwood floors need depends 
on the extent of wear or damage. Floors that are merely scratched 
or scuffed, he said, usually require little more than a new finish 
to recoup their former beauty. Those that are severely scratched or 
stained, as well as those on which portions of the finish have worn 
through to the wood itself, may need to have the old finish completely 
removed and the surface sanded smooth before a new finish can be applied. 
``I'm not an advocate of sanding down to bare wood,'' Sedovic said. 
``All wood mellows with age, and one of the things that's nice about 
hardwoods like oak is that the grain becomes accentuated over time. 
If you sand it back to a plain surface, you lose a lot of that beauty.'' 
Accordingly, he said, when floors are not damaged to the point where 
the finish has completely worn through, it is generally best to just 
``rough-up'' the surface coat without cutting through it and into 
the wood itself. ``You screen the floor instead of sanding it,'' Sedovic 
said, explaining that screening involves using a floor sander equipped 
with a mesh screen _ similar to the material used for window screens 
_ instead of sandpaper. ``The screen grit is finer than sandpaper 
grit,'' he said. ``It gently abrades the finish without taking the 
wood surface apart.'' In addition, Sedovic said, homeowners who are 
thinking about renting a machine to refinish their floors themselves 
might want to use a reciprocating machine _ one that vibrates _ rather 
than a belt sander or disk sander that rotates or spins and is more 
difficult to control. After screening, Sedovic said, the floor needs 
to be vacuumed, damp-mopped, and then allowed to dry overnight before 
a finish coat is applied. ``I usually recommend a waterborne polyurethane,'' 
he said, explaining that such a finish is odorless, quick-drying, 
and thin enough to conform to the texture of the wood. ``You can build 
up three coats and still have a feel left for the surface qualities 
of the floor.'' Anne Dickel, an owner of Floors Like Glass, a hardwood 
floor refinishing company in Goshen, N.Y., said that when floors are 
so deteriorated that they must be sanded to bare wood, it generally 
takes a minimum of four passes with the sanding machine _ three with 
increasingly finer grit paper _ and then one final pass with a screen. 
``We don't like to use sealers,'' Ms. Dickel said, referring to products 
that are sometimes used to seal the wood and thereby enable the use 
of fewer finish coats. ``When you use a polyurethane finish with no 
sealer, the first coat goes on a little splotchy, and that's what 
you want it to do,'' she said, explaining that when polyurethane is 
absorbed into the wood it provides greater durability than when it 
just sits on the wood surface. ``On red oak, two coats are usually 
sufficient,'' Ms. Dickel said. ``White oak, maple, fir and pine usually 
require three coats to finish,'' she said, adding that the cost of 
refinishing a floor in decent condition can range from $1.50 to $2 
a square foot. Floors that are severely damaged can cost more. Ms. 
Dickel pointed out that the best way to clean a wood floor was to 
vacuum frequently, wipe up spills immediately and then damp mop the 
floor with a solution of two tablespoons of white vinegar in a gallon 
of water. In fact, the way a wood floor is cleaned can have a significant 
impact on the refinishing process when refinishing becomes necessary. 
Phill Maiorana, a floor refinisher in Bloomfield, N.J., said that 
it was sometimes necessary to strip a floor in fairly good shape to 
bare wood and then use a sealer as a first coat to insure that the 
finish coat adheres properly to the floor. ``If someone waxes their 
wood floors, the wax ends up getting packed into the seams between 
the boards,'' Maiorana said. ``And when a finish comes in contact 
with that old wax, they separate like oil and water.'' And since even 
sanding to bare wood provides no guarantee of getting at wax caked 
between the boards, he said, it is sometimes necessary to coat the 
floor with a sealer to dissolve the wax and allow the finish coats 
to stick uniformly. At times, however, a floor has been refinished 
so many times that refinishing it again will cause nails to show in 
the seams where the boards are attached. Until recently, Maiorana 
said, when that happened _ and the homeowner wanted to keep the look 
of wood rather than lay down carpet or vinyl flooring _ the only solution 
was to rip up the old floor and replace it with a new one or to lay 
a new floor over the old one. Over the last few years, however, a 
new product has been gaining in popularity with homeowners _ a product 
that looks like wood but wears like iron: plastic laminate flooring. 
``Laminate flooring is the hottest growing category in the flooring 
industry,'' said Kevin Boothe, marketing manager for Formica Flooring, 
a product made by Formica Corp. in Cincinnati. ``Laminates are more 
durable than wood, they don't scratch, they don't dent, they don't 
rip and they don't stain.'' Formica's laminate flooring _ which is 
only 5/16 of an inch thick and can be installed over an existing wood 
floor _ costs about $4 a square foot plus about $3 a square foot for 
installation. Formica flooring products, Boothe said, are essentially 
a sandwich of sorts of various materials bonded together permanently 
by the application of high heat and pressure. Like its competitors, 
the product comes in styles and colors that mimic various wood grains. 
Boothe explained that most laminate flooring products were installed 
using a tongue-and-groove method _ the same method used for traditional 
wood flooring _ whereby adjacent planks with a tongue on one side 
and a grove on the other are joined together. But while wood planks 
are nailed to the subfloor, laminates are glued to each other along 
their sides and allowed to ``float'' on the subfloor _ normally covered 
by a thin foam underlayer _ with about a quarter inch of free space 
around the perimeter to allow for expansion and contraction. ``A homeowner 
who has a few handyman skills and knows how to measure can probably 
put in a floor over a weekend,'' Boothe said. ``And then you have 
a floor that needs no waxing, no buffing and no polishing. Just go 
over it with a damp mop when it gets dirty.''
