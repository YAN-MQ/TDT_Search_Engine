The cult that planted nerve gas in the Tokyo subway three years ago, 
killing 12 people and injuring thousands more, is back. Aum Shinrikyo, 
which was found responsible for the sarin attack and for several murders 
with VX, the most toxic nerve agent known, is regrouping, recruiting 
new members at home and abroad, and raising vast sums of money, security 
officials and Japanese and American terrorism experts say. The U.S. 
State Department has designated it a terrorist group, although it 
has not been linked to any illegal acts since 1995. The resurgence 
of the sect that masterminded the most serious terrorist attack in 
Japan's modern history, the officials said, is a result partly of 
Japan's unwillingness to ban it. The Tokyo district court deprived 
Aum Shinrikyo of its legal religious status in 1995 and liquidated 
its assets after declaring it insolvent the following year. But the 
Japanese government decided last year that the Justice Ministry had 
not proved that the group posed an ``immediate or obvious threat'' 
to Japanese society. It rejected a request from security officials 
to outlaw the sect under a 1952 law against subversive activities. 
The law has never been applied. As a result, despite security experts' 
warnings, Aum Shinrikyo, arguing that the government has effectively 
sanctioned its existence, has used the decision to rebound. ``There 
has been no word of repentance or apology,'' concludes the Public 
Security Investigation Agency, the main intelligence arm of Japan's 
Ministry of Justice, in a 70-page report issued in January. Moreover, 
the document states, Aum Shinrikyo _ the name is the Buddhist mantra 
``Om'' followed by ``Supreme Truth'' _ has not revised or abandoned 
``its dangerous doctrine that justifies murder to achieve its ends.'' 
According to the report and interviews with Japanese security officials 
and independent experts, the group now has about 5,000 followers, 
including 500 ``monks,'' followers who are ``ordained'' and live communally. 
It operates some 28 installations at 18 branches (down from a peak 
of 24) throughout the country. A BAN IN RUSSIA PROVES NO DETERRENT 
Despite being banned in Russia, the group is still active there, as 
well as in Ukraine, Belarus and Kazakhstan. It maintains encrypted 
Web sites and chat rooms in Japanese, English and Russian and controls 
a network of electronic, computer and other stores that generated 
about $30 million in revenues in 1997. Its publishing company, now 
its second-largest source of revenue, reopened in April and issues 
at least one book or pamphlet a month, officials said. The group is 
far weaker and poorer than it was at the peak of its influence in 
1995, when it owned about 30 pieces of property throughout Japan, 
as well as a business empire that controlled restaurants, computers 
and other technology companies. Its net worth was estimated at $20 
million to $1 billion. It was also said to have 10,000 followers in 
Japan and up to 40,000 in other countries, 30,000 of them in Russia. 
Still, the group's resurgence deeply troubles security officials, 
who say they monitor known followers and businesses 24 hours a day 
and continue searching for three of its leaders accused of involvement 
in earlier plots and deadly assaults. Signs of the group's resurgence 
abound. Among them, say the police and other experts, is Trisal, a 
store that customizes computer systems at discount prices. The tiny 
office, four stories up a steep, narrow staircase in a small Tokyo 
office building, is staffed by very young salespeople and jammed with 
bargain hunters, most of them also young. Asked whether the cult had 
a financial stake in the company, a Trisal spokesman said, ``Not really.'' 
And a spokesman for the group declined to comment on whether it has 
a financial stake in Trisal or in any of the other electronics companies 
that Japanese authorities identify as directly or indirectly controlled 
by the sect. But Hiroshi Araki, the spokesman since his predecessor's 
arrest in 1996, did not deny that Aum Shinrikyo had financial ties 
to several businesses reportedly owned by or employing its followers. 
``Naming them and discussing such things would only help the government 
harass the companies and people who work for them,'' Araki explained 
in an interview in the group's library, which was filled with books 
and pamphlets describing the beliefs of the sect's founder and spiritual 
leader, Shoko Asahara. The half-blind 43-year-old guru preached his 
own blend of Hinduism and Buddhism with an apocalyptic spin. According 
to his books and preaching, his followers will rise from the ashes 
of Armageddon. To speed the new order, he planned to help destroy 
the old one by assembling a corps of young scientists to develop and 
use chemical, biological and other weapons of mass destruction. Asahara 
remains in jail while being tried on 17 counts of murder, kidnapping, 
trafficking in guns and drugs, the subway attack with sarin nerve 
gas, and other assaults with chemical or biological weapons. He has 
pleaded not guilty. After the Tokyo attack, the police said that 427 
people, known or suspected members of Aum Shinrikyo, were arrested; 
of those, 215 were eventually released without charge. Of the ones 
let go, the police said, 155 have returned to the cult. Of those charged, 
156 have been convicted. More than 30 members are still on trial. 
Despite the convictions, arrests and what the police acknowledge is 
constant surveillance, the cult has continued to hold regular training 
sessions, recruiting members and raising money. In May, more than 
500 believers and others curious about the sect gathered at a resort 
near Mount Fuji to hear sermons and receive training in yoga, meditation 
and other activities. Security officials and private experts estimate 
that the group raised about 50 million yen, or about $350,000, from 
that meeting alone. While the police say there is no evidence that 
the cult has resumed its efforts to make or buy weapons of mass destruction, 
the cult still worries them. Using anthrax, botulism toxin and a variety 
of other germ or chemical weapons, the sect repeatedly conducted covert 
attacks against targets including a U.S. military base where thousands 
of Americans live, throughout the early 1990s. Although these earlier 
efforts failed, the sect's secret sarin attack on an apartment complex 
in Matsumoto almost a year before its Tokyo subway attack resulted 
in seven deaths and 600 injuries. After the police finally raided 
the sect's compound at the foot of Mount Fuji following the subway 
sarin attack, they found tons of chemicals for use in weapons, although 
the cult's stocks of VX, 50 kilograms of sarin and other deadly agents 
had already been destroyed, said Anthony Tu, a Colorado State University 
chemist who advised the Japanese police on the case. While many Aum 
Shinrikyo members are now unwilling to identify themselves as such, 
security officials say that hundreds of hard-core believers remain 
despite the 1995 subway attack. Many provide financial assistance 
to fellow members, officials say, and even to the three senior cult 
fugitives. ``It's hard to imagine that such fugitives could still 
be at large here without the active help of believers,'' one official 
said. Security officials expressed particular concern about the group's 
continued allure for young scientists, engineers and other well-educated 
people who might be able to reassemble an arms arsenal. Satoshi Izumi, 
a reporter at the daily Asahi Shimbun, said that almost 200 of some 
1,400 Aum monks investigated by security officials were university 
students or graduates. Most of those who put bags of sarin nerve gas 
in the subways in 1995 were graduates of the science departments of 
leading universities. Several experts have interpreted the rise of 
religious cults _ 185,000 of which are registered with the government 
_ as a response to the strains of modern Japanese society. They also 
caution about the persistence of the underlying conditions that leave 
young Japanese vulnerable to groups like Aum. As Taro Maki, the former 
editor of Sunday Mainichi, put it, ``In a country whose fathers are 
utterly preoccupied with work, whose mothers want their children to 
be winners and whose educational system prides itself on the fiercest 
of competition for admission, these new-new religions, as they are 
called _ or pseudoreligions, as I call them _ are attractive to kids 
who don't quite make the cut, or to those who do but see little purpose 
to their lives.'' Maki waged an early campaign against Aum Shinrikyo. 
Even many defectors remain mesmerized by Asahara. Still calling him 
their father, they have told Robert Jay Lifton, the American psychiatrist 
who is writing a book about the group, that the guru retains almost 
mystical powers. Araki, the Aum Shinrikyo spokesman, said he had abandoned 
art history studies at Kyoto University after attending a lecture 
by Asahara. The guru, he recalled, left him with an almost ``indescribable 
sense of peace and inner harmony.'' Asked how he could defend the 
guru's orders to kill innocent people with sarin, Araki, 30, replied 
that he still could not believe that Asahara was responsible for the 
attacks, because the guru ``would not give such an unjust command.'' 
Experts disagree about whether the group is still dangerous. Many 
argue that with Asahara and other leaders in jail, it poses little 
immediate threat. Even security officials concede that given their 
surveillance, it would be unlikely to stage illegal actions now. But 
they worry about copycat attacks, and about Aum Shinrikyo's potential. 
At the moment, they say, the group is led by a secretive steering 
committee of six senior members who have increasingly focused on two 
of Asahara's six children _ his third daughter and his youngest son 
_ as spiritual symbols. But by next summer, Fumihiro Joyu, the group's 
former spokesman, may be out of jail, since he has been charged only 
with relatively minor crimes like perjury. Because he continues to 
declare his adoration of Asahara and has become something of a teen 
idol _ girls are said to swoon over his photo and snap up Joyu T-shirts 
and posters _ government and private experts fear that he could regalvanize 
the group and reunite its warring factions. OFFICIAL AMBIVALENCE AIDS 
SECT'S CAUSE Nevertheless, there is little support within political 
circles for banning the group, even among some of its most ardent 
opponents. Maki, for one, argues that outlawing the group would only 
drive it underground, making it harder to track and possibly compelling 
it to ever more desperate acts. He and others also trace this hesitancy 
to a reaction against the prewar government's repression of political, 
and particularly religious, groups. Noting that Japan's modern legal 
system was adopted after World War II at the behest of the United 
States, the government has been sensitive to any charges of limiting 
religious freedom. Moreover, Japan's political left and other small 
groups fear the precedent: they might be the law's next targets, said 
Seizaburo Sato, research director of Japan's Institute for International 
Policy Studies. Religious status in Japan affords considerable political 
sanctuary. So other religions, some of which support political groups 
and agendas, oppose any government action that might constrain their 
own freedom. Sato noted, for instance, that the Soka Gakkai, a Buddhist 
sect founded here in the 1930s, recently delivered 7.5 million votes 
in national elections to the party it supported. ``So no political 
party is going to alienate religious groups and sects by supporting 
a ban on the Aum,'' Sato said. Shoko Egawa, the author of several 
books on Aum Shinrikyo, argues that short of banning the group, the 
government could do more to discourage its activities. ``The authorities 
could use the tax and employment laws more effectively to help curtail 
their resurgence,'' she said, ``but they do not.'' Some analysts even 
suspect a widespread sympathy for cult members who say they knew nothing 
about the violence. They embraced the group because of its opposition 
to the materialism that, while making Japan the world's second-strongest 
economy, has also created nostalgia for values that may have been 
discarded in the postwar rush to modernize. But Yoichi Funabashi, 
the diplomatic correspondent of Asahi Shimbun, rejects this. He said 
opposition to invoking the law against subversive activities reflected 
the broader political paralysis that has prevented Japan from taking 
serious measures to resolve its economic crisis. ``Civil society has 
an obligation to protect itself,'' he said.
