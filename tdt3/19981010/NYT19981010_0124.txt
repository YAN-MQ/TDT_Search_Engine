Dr. Joseph J. Sandler, a psychoanalyst known internationally for his 
major theoretical contributions and a leader of what a colleague called 
a ``quiet revolution'' in psychoanalytic thought, died Oct. 6 at his 
home in London. He was 71. The cause was lung cancer, colleagues said. 
British psychoanalysis in the mid-1900s was split into divergent and 
sometimes competitive schools, one led by Sigmund Freud's daughter 
Anna, another by the British analyst Melanie Klein. Sandler, a member 
of the Freudian group, was instrumental, through his writings and 
teaching, in nurturing a gradual reconciliation of the two camps, 
integrating Ms. Klein's ``object relations'' perspective with more 
classical psychoanalytic drive theory. Born in Cape Town, Joseph Sandler 
was trained as an experimental psychologist before receiving his medical 
degree from University College Hospital in London. Joining the British 
Psycho-Analytical Society at the age of 25, he worked at the Tavistock 
Clinic and later, under Anna Freud, at the Hampstead Clinic (now the 
Anna Freud Center). From 1979 to 1984, Sandler was the Sigmund Freud 
Professor at Hebrew University in Jerusalem. He then returned to England 
and became the first scholar to hold the Freud Memorial Chair in Psychoanalysis 
at University College, London. After his retirement in 1992, he remained 
at the university as emeritus professor until his death. During his 
term as president of the International Psychoanalytical Association 
from 1989 to 1993, Sandler emphasized the importance of empirical 
research, setting up a summer research program for analysts and sponsoring 
an annual research conference, according to Dr. Robert Wallerstein, 
a close friend and past president of the association. Dr. Otto Kernberg, 
a New York analyst who is now the association's president, said Sandler's 
strong scientific interests also helped forge links between psychoanalytic 
thinking and neurobiology. A prolific author, Sandler wrote more than 
200 professional papers and edited 44 books, including a classic introduction 
to psychoanalysis, ``The Analyst and The Patient'' (International 
Universities Press, 1973), which he wrote with Christopher Dare, Alex 
Holder and Anna Ursula Dreher. He was the founding editor of the International 
Review of Psycho-Analysis and served as editor of the International 
Journal of Psychoanalysis. Sandler is survived by his wife, Anne-Marie 
Sandler, who is also a psychoanalyst, three children and seven grandchildren.
