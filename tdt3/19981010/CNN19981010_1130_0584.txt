Doctors say New York Yankees slugger Darryl Strawberry's chances for 
survival are better than good. They found a malignancy in one of Strawberry's 
lymph nodes after he underwent colon cancer surgery last week. So 
far, there's no evidence the cancer spread beyond the lymph node. 
Doctors say it's possible Strawberry could play ball next season, 
but they aren't offering any guarantees.
