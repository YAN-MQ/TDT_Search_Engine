I'll be right back Nouncing an amazing discovery. One-A-day has combined 
the power of herbs with vitamins... to help you during the cold season. 
Support your mood, even memory. New from one-A-day. Just what you 
need... to feel your best. Teddy gibbs toughs it out through the raw 
soar throat, the hacking cough, the fever. Now he needs... maximum 
strength theraflu. Fast, soothing hot liquid theraflu. My first boyfriend-- 
Rick whiting. I hadn't seen him in years. And we're at our 20th reunion 
catching up, and I get this terrible heartburn. But Rick hands me 
Zantac 75. "Thanks," I said. "So, did you ever become an accountant?" 
"No," he says, "A doctor." The medicine in Zantac 75 is the #1 doctor-prescribed 
acid reducer. It relieves even your toughest heartburn, controlling 
acid for up to 12 hours. Dr. Rick whiting. Zantac 75 for tough heartburn.
