The White House and the Republican-led House of Representatives are 
squaring for impeachment vote against President Clinton this week. 
The House Judiciary Committee approved four articles of impeachment 
last week. The president is accused of perjury, obstruction of justice, 
and abuse of power in an attempt to hide an affair with a White House 
intern. Republican leaders insist Mr. Clinton deserves to be removed 
from office. Democrats say the Congress should issue a rebuke short 
of impeachment.
