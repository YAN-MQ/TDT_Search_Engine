We'll have more of 1998s finer moments in the coming weeks. You're 
listening to The World on PRI, Public Radio International. The World 
is made possible in part by Merck, a research-driven pharmaceutical 
company discovering, developing and manufacturing a broad range of 
human and animal health products and services. Merck: committed to 
bringing out the best in medicine. And The World is brought to you 
by the Capitol Group, investing throughout the world for individuals 
and institutions. You're listening to The World on 91 F.M., WHYY. 
After this program, at 9 o'clock, stay tuned for Talk of the Nation 
with Ray Suarez. On tonight's program, the latest news on former Chilean 
dictator Augusto Pinochet's legal battle against extradition to Spain 
to face charges of terrorism, torture and genocide. That's coming 
up tonight at 9 o'clock on Talk of the Nation. Then we switch gears 
at 10 o'clock and it's Chanukah lights. NPRs Susan Stanburg and Murray 
Horowitz lead a selection of stories in Chanukah- related literature. 
That's Chanukah Lights coming up tonight at 10 o'clock. And listen 
for the Charlie Rose Show at with Tom Brokaw talking about his new 
book. Hope you'll stay tuned to 91 F.M.
