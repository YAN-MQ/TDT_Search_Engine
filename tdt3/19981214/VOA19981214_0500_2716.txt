aids researchers still know very little about the first few months 
of HIV infection and its effect on the human immune system. So over 
the next four years, researchers at Johns Hopkins Medical Center will 
be recruiting people who are at high risk for HIV. If they develop 
the infection, they will be treated with powerful new drug combinations 
to see if early and aggressive treatment of HIV can halt its progress. 
Dr. Richard Chaisson, director of the Johns Hopkins AIDS service says 
the study may help answer some fundamental questions. Can we prevent 
AIDS from developing? Can we prevent people's immune systems from 
undergoing destruction with the HIV virus? Can we keep people in a 
normal state of health after getting HIV? The first participants in 
the study are 50 intravenous drug users who have tested positive for 
HIV infection.
