Well, we had a rather nasty sell off in the U.S. stock market today. 
Dow Jones Industrial Average closing at 8695. That was down 126 points 
or 1-1/2 percent. Standard & Poors 500 Index closed at 1141. That 
was down 25. The stocks of banks and financial services companies 
were weak but selling was strongest in the high technology sector. 
Now the NASDAQ index, which is heavily weighted with technology stocks, 
lost three percent of its value.
