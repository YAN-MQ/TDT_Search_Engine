Iran says it's arrested several people in connection with a spate 
of recent killings of Iranian intellectuals and dissidents. Iran's 
supreme leader Ayatollah Hamini is blaming foreign powers for their 
deaths which occurred in mysterious circumstances. The Ayatollah says 
certain enemies are trying to thwart the country's progress. Fifty
