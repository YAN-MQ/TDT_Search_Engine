France and the state of Kentucky are joining forces to ring in peace 
for the next millennium. Kentucky governor Paul Patton and a delegation 
gathered in western France today for the casting of the "world peace 
bell." The 66,000-pound ringer is a symbol of freedom, peace, and 
respect for human rights. It will be the world's largest, free-swinging 
bell and will be shipped to its permanent home in Kentucky next spring.
