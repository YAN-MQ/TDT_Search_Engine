Astronauts aboard the shuttle "endeavour" are wrapping up some last-minute 
space work before heading home tomorrow. They deployed a whale-watching 
satellite last night, hours after detaching the international space 
station from "endeavour." Astronauts have spent the past week beginning 
construction on the $60 billion project. Tonight, the crew hopes to 
deploy another satellite -- a test spacecraft for the U.S. military. 
"Endeavour" is expected to land tomorrow night at the Kennedy space 
center in Florida.
