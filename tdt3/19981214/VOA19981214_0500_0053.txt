President Clinton and Palestinian leader Yasir Arafat opened talks 
at this hour in Gaza. It is the first ever visit to Palestinian territory 
by an American president. VOA's Debra Tate reports from Gaza City. 
Mr. Clinton flew into Gaza International Airport aboard Marine One 
and was met by Palestinian leader Yasir Arafat. The two leaders took 
part in a ribbon cutting ceremony to formally inaugurate the airport 
which opened earlier this month as a result of the peace process. 
Then they helicoptered to Gaza city in route to Palestinian authority 
headquarters for their talks. During the meeting, Mr. Clinton is expected 
to urge Mr. Arafat to do more to crack down on violence, a major concern 
of Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, who has suspended implementation 
of the Wye River accord until the Palestinians do more to meet their 
obligations under the agreement. Later, President Clinton will attend 
a meeting of the Palestinian National Council to witness the body 
reaffirmed changes in its charter, dropping language calling for the 
destruction of Israel. Debra Tate, VOA News, Gaza City.
