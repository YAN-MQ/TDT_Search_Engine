General Electric Company of the United Kingdom, which has held merger 
talks with British Aerospace off and on since 1993 says those talks 
have intensified. A merger between the two would create one of the 
world's largest defense companies valued at nearly $40 billion. GEC 
appears to be moving at a time when the European defense industry 
is consolidating to better compete for export contracts as European 
military budgets continue to shrink.
