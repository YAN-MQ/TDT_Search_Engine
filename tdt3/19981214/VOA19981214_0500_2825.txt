And if you suffer the hand and wrist pain of carpal tunnel syndrome, 
consider practicing yoga. Researchers at the University of Pennsylvania 
compared the effectiveness of wrist splints and Hatha yoga postures. 
According to their report in the "Journal of the American Medical 
Association," the yoga provided more relief than wrist splinting or 
no treatment at all. Lead researcher Dr. Warren Katz says yoga may 
be a win/win option for the patients it does help. I don't suspect 
for a moment that all patients are going to respond to yoga, but what 
I do say is that it is a relatively innocuous, enjoyable, relaxing, 
and positive experience with no side effects whatsoever. Dr. Katz 
says yoga helps relieve carpal tunnel pain by improving circulation 
to nerves that supply the fingers and hand and by stretching ligaments 
and tendons. I'm Jane Hughes.
