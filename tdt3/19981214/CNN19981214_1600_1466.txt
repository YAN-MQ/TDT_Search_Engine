The U.S. mint wants your help in picking the new dollar coin. It's 
displaying six possible designs for each side of the coin on its web 
site, usmint.gov, where you can vote. The front side will show Sacajawea, 
the shoshone Indian who accompanied the lewis and Clark expedition. 
And the flip side will have an eagle. Secretary of the treasury Robert 
Rubin will make the final decision next month. The coins should be 
released in the year 2000.
