Hundreds of house members are preparing for this week's vote on the 
articles of impeachment against President Clinton. CNN has determined 
there are still about 20 undecided republicans. To avoid impeachment, 
the White House needs a few to defect. Moderate republican Christopher 
Shays says if he had to vote today, he would vote against impeachment. 
But he says his level of conviction is not the same as it was a week 
ago. Democrat John Tanner who had been undecided, has announced he 
is likely to vote against impeachment. Tanner initially voted in favor 
of the impeachment inquiry. Other house members say they will have 
to wait and see what the president does between now and Thursday before 
they can make a definitive call. I wish I could say to myself, I know 
to a certainty or a near certainty that this president has learned 
from this experience and that if these kinds of circumstances were 
to arise again, whether or not he thought he would get caught, he 
wouldn't do it again. I don't have that confidence. And until I have 
that confidence I can't be assured that I have any other choice but 
to vote for impeachment.
