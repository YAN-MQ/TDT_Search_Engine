Hi, I'm Bill Morazzo, President and CEO here at WHYY. As you may have 
heard, WHYY is embarking on an extraordinarily important fund- raising 
campaign, an effort that will give us the tools we need to keep public 
broadcasting strong well into the next century. It's called the Campaign 
for Independence. And when this campaign is complete, WHYY will not 
only be a great TV and radio station, but also an institution designed 
to support the educational, economic and cultural affairs of the entire 
tri-state area. You see, WHYY is taking advantage of the transition 
to digital broadcasting by aggressively pursuing community collaborations 
and bringing you an even wider range of radio, television and information 
services. We are also building a new broadcast facility and creating 
a program endowment to keep the great programs coming on 91 F.M. and 
TV12. We've already raised more than $13 million toward the $15 million 
goal, and the Kresge Foundation has offered us a gift of $1 million 
if we can complete our campaign within the next couple of months. 
That's why your help is so important. We are asking you to consider 
supporting the campaign at a leadership level, and we're inviting 
you to have your name engraved in stone in our new members plaza, 
a special place on Independence Mall that will serve as the entrance 
to our new building as a gathering place for community events. You 
can make your pledge to the Campaign for Independence now and pay 
it over the course of 3 years. You can also put your pledge on a credit 
card. Call us at 1-800-413-7200 now. That's 1-800-413-7200, and we 
can give you all the details. In the meantime, stay tuned for the 
new things happening at WHYY. The World is made possible in part by 
Merck, pharmaceutical research dedicated to preventing disease and 
improving health. Merck: committed to bringing out the best in medicine.
