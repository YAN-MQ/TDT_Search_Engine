And as part of our continuing look at the nuttier side of the year 
in the news, we stick around in Slovakia where things are definitely 
coming to a head. With echos of our own cola wars, this year saw a 
beer war break out between the once United Czech Republic and Slovakia. 
It all began when a Slovakian brewery started producing a delightful 
malted beverage known as Starre Premin, or Ancient Spring. Sounds 
on the level, except that it also sounds surprisingly similar to a 
Czech beer called Starro Promin, or, you guessed it, Ancient Spring. 
Diana Dablova works for the Czech brewer and she says the Slovak suds 
are posing as the Czech favorite. If you look at the two labels, two 
bottles, some way you can clearly see the resemblance in letters, 
in the forms, the type of forms they are using. And this represents 
for us a threat, especially in Russia and the Ukraine where both Starre 
Premin and Starro Promin are translated into Russia the same way. 
And in fact, we came across situations where we have found bottles 
of Starro Promin sold in the crates under the name Czechnia. The Slovaks 
responded with their own spin saying that if the world can tell the 
difference between Coke and Pepsi, they should be able to tell the 
difference between the two beers. Hard to believe the two countries 
were once one big happy beer-loving land.
