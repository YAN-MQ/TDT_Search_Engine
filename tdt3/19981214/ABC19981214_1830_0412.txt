Congressman LoBiondo's vote was very much one the White House wanted 
to have. The president's team has been clinging to those polls which 
show a majority of Americans against impeachment. Today, the ABC News/"Washington 
Post" poll finds 61% who say Mr. Clinton should not be impeached, 
38% who think he should. However, if the House of Representatives 
does impeach him, 58% say Mr. clinton should resign rather than go 
through a trial in the Senate.
