Angola's UNITA rebels have shot down a plane witnesses say was carrying 
wounded soldiers and women and children fleeing fighting in the central 
town of Quito. There are no reports of survivors, and the exact number 
of passengers was not immediately known. Witnesses tell VOA the Russian 
cargo plane carried people who had fled to the airport at Quito in 
hopes of escaping the fighting. The crash came amid fierce clashes 
around the government-held town.
