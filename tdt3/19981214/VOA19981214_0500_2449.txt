North Korea has reported to have dropped its demand for a $300 million 
payment to allow U.S. inspection of a suspected nuclear weapons site. 
Instead, the United States will offer more food aid and other economic 
benefits to the starving nation. South Korea newspapers reported from 
Washington said that agreement was reached in a recent series of talks 
between the United States and North Korea in New York and Washington. 
The two sides also agreed to continue talks on the suspected underground 
nuclear site sometime before four-part peace talks resume next month 
in Geneva. The United States is demanding inspection of a site at 
Kumchangnee, which it suspects the North might be using to develop 
nuclear weapons in violation of a 1994 energy agreement.
