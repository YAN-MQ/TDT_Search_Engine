One of the last stops on President Clinton's Middle East visit will 
be a Three-way summit. He plans to meet tomorrow morning with Israeli 
prime minister Benjamin netanyahu and Palestinian authority President 
Yasser Arafat at a border between Gaza and Israel. Today, Mr. Clinton 
became the first American president ever to step foot on palestinian-controlled 
soil. In Gaza, he watched as the Palestine national council voted 
to annul parts of its charter which had called for the destruction 
of Israel. I thank you for your rejection fully, finally and forever 
of the passages in the Palestinian charter calling for the destruction 
of Israel, for they were the ideological underpinnings of a struggle 
renounced at Oslo. By revoking them once and for all. And I say again, 
you have sent a powerful message not to the government, but to the 
people of Israel. You will touch people on the street there. You will 
reach their hearts there. Earlier, President Clinton applauded Arafat 
for his efforts toward peace with Israel. And he said Palestinians 
"have, for the first time, a chance to determine their own destiny 
on their own land." The president and Arafat also visited Palestinian 
children, whose parents are imprisoned in Israel. The release of certain 
Palestinian prisoners from Israel is a condition of the wye river 
land-for-security deal reached in October.
