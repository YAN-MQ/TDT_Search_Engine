Now, falcons coach Dan Reeves is resting in an Atlanta hospital tonight 
after four hours of quadruple heart bypass surgery. The 54-year-old 
coach had angioplasty back in '90 and '91. Defensive coordinator rich 
Brooks takes over until Reeves returns. We expect that he will be 
able to be on the sideline for the playoff and the Super Bowl. We 
have to -- everybody else has to pick up the slack around here and 
do a Better job to make up for that absence.
