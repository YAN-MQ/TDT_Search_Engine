Still ahead tonight here -- Hillary Clinton. She has always stood 
by her man. But "in depth" tonight, is she there now as her husband 
faces the greatest crisis of his life? It's almost through the terrible 
things that have happened to the Clintons this year that she's found 
her role in some way. She's still standing by his side. But why is 
she no longer rushing to his defense? And going for gold -- are cities 
around the world buying the right to host the Olympic games? Shocking 
charges from a top Olympic official. Mom's calling enterprise rent-A-car 
'cause our car is sick. Enterprise will arrange to pick you up... 
wow! Drive you to our place and get you on your way. Everybody loves 
to be picked up. Pick enterprise.
