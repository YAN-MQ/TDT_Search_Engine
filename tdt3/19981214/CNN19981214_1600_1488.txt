Some high school students apparently are skipping lunch in favor of 
more school work. "The Philadelphia inquirer" reports students across 
the northeast are opting to take an extra class during their lunch 
break. Some schools are even scheduling special classes to be taken 
in place of lunch, like science labs or S.A.T. prep courses. Critics 
of the program say they don't think having students skip lunch is 
such a good idea.
