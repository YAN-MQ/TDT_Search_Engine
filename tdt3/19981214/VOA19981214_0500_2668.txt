Diabetics historically have injected themselves with insulin when 
insulin levels in their bodies get dangerously low. But now there's 
a new way to get insulin through inhalers that have just the U.S. 
market, and the inhalers are only the cutting edge of a broader trend. 
Among the developments, patches with tiny batteries to push drugs 
through the skin, and smart pills that release medicine in response 
to signals from the body. Companies also are coating drugs with microscopic 
layers of fat that dissolve when the compound reaches its target in 
the body. They're creating fruits and vegetables that immunize people 
from common diseases. And under formulation are vaccine gels that 
are simply rubbed on the skin.
