President Clinton says he has no intention of resigning despite the 
impending impeachment vote against him this week or early next in 
the House of Representatives. The president made his remarks in Jerusalem 
before he flew to the new Gaza International Airport. VOA's Debra 
Tate has details from Jerusalem. At a joint news conference with Prime 
Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, Mr. Clinton delivered a forceful, determined 
response about whether he would leave office as a result of a House 
impeachment vote scheduled Thursday. I have no intention of resigning. 
It's never crossed my mind. It was Mr. Clinton's first public comment 
after the House Judiciary Committee approved four articles of impeachment 
against him alleging perjury, obstruction of justice, and abuse of 
power, stemming from Mr. Clinton's efforts to conceal his affair with 
former intern Monica Lewinsky. The president said he was not surprised 
by the committee's vote, which he called foreordained. He urged members 
of the full House to vote their conscience based on the Constitution 
and the law, adding they should not be subjected to partisan political 
pressure. Many Republicans are angered by Mr. Clinton's vague and 
legalistic responses to questions about the Lewinsky matter and have 
demanded he acknowledge making false statements under oath. But the 
president made clear he has no plans to confess to perjury, saying 
he has not committed such a crime. I could not admit to do something 
that I'm quite sure I did not do. There were a number of questions 
posed to Mr. Clinton about the scandal from both American and Israeli 
journalists prompting a frustrated Mr. Netanyahu to issue this appeal. 
You are free to ask any one of your questions, but I think the president 
has come here on a very clear message and a very clear voice of peace. 
And I believe that it would be appropriate also to ask only to questions 
on the peace process. Later, U.S. National Security Adviser Sandy 
Berger denied speculation Mr. Clinton may curtail his three-day visit 
to the region to return home to deal with the impeachment issue, saying 
the president has every intention of following his schedule as planned.
