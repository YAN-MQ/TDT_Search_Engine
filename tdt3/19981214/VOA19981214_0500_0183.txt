Turkish Kurd rebel leader Abdullah Urjalon says he is distancing himself 
from his guerrilla fighters because they have disobeyed his commands 
for years by killing Turkish civilians. Mr. Urjalon said the guerrilla 
acts are destroying the Kurdistan Workers Party he founded in 1978. 
He made the comments in a Sunday interview with the Kurdish Med TV. 
Minister Urjalon is under heavy guard in Rome where he was arrested 
last month.
