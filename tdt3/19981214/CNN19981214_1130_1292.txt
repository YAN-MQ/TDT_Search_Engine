Unbeaten no longer. Denver lost on a Sunday full of surprises in the 
NFL. The Broncos' quest for a perfect season ended at the hands of 
the giants of all teams, 20-16. The '72 dolphins may have been perfect, 
but today's version is far from it, now reeling after allowing Dan 
Marino to be sacked five times in a critical loss to the jets, 21-16. 
The bills thumped Oakland, 44-21, to stay on pace to become only the 
fourth team in league history to reach the playoffs after an 0-3 start. 
While the other AFC east team in the mix, the Patriots, not only lost 
to the Rams 32-18, but also said good-bye to Terry Glenn, who suffered 
a Broken ankle. The Vikings continue to roll, now 13-1 after a wild 
33-28 beating of baltimore. While a season of frustration continued 
in Carolina, where the Panthers dropped to 2-12 after a 28-25 loss 
to Washington.
