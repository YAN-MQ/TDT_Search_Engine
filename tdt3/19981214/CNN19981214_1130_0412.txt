Some survivors of last week's Thai airways crash are giving high marks 
to rescue workers, but a thumbs down to the pilot. They say he should 
never have tried to land a third time, after failing twice. The Airbus 
A-310 went down about half a mile from the runway in surat thani, 
Thailand. It was raining heavily at the time, and the airport's instrument 
guidance system was out of service. A Thai aviation official says 
getting that system back on line is a Priority. 101 people died in 
the crash, including the pilot. 45 people survived.
