I wish... come on, girl. I wish I had an elephant. An elephant. Who'd 
always play with me. Bye-bye. But wishes are like elephants. They're 
bigger than can be. O.K., maybe you can't give her everything her 
heart desires. But with the humongous purchase power of the visa platinum 
card, maybe you can. And besides, you never know what she'll want 
next.
