Well, Tony and I need to go shopping, so your local stations are going 
to be taking a two-minute break. This is VOA News Now. Today is Monday, 
December 14th, 1998. On this date in 1799, George Washington, the 
first president of the United States and the victorious commander 
of the Continental Army during the Revolutionary War died. The 67-year-old 
leader was at his Mt. Vernon plantation in Virginia. He had become 
ill two days earlier when he rode through rain and snow during inspection 
of his land. Washington's wife, Martha, became concerned when his 
condition worsened, and she called in physicians. The doctors used 
the typical treatment of the era nd bled him twice. Realizing that 
he was dying, the former president is reported to have said, "I am 
not afraid to go, but I die hard." George Washington's legacy to his 
country was that of a leader who conferred a basic dignity on the 
presidency. And on December 14th, 1910, the industrialist, Andrew 
Carnegie, gave $10 million to establish the Carnegie Endowment for 
International Peace. Mr. Carnegie established the organization to 
promote world peace by sponsoring scholars, diplomats, politicians, 
and other thinkers and doers so they could study and write about international 
affairs. The Carnegie endowment also supports the influential "Foreign 
Policy" magazine, which publishes the report of Carnegie experts. 
Andrew Carnegie established the endowment for peace because he deeply 
felt that rich people should use their wealth to promote good during 
their lifetimes. His money helped found and aid dozens of libraries 
and educational institutions across the United States. There's lots 
more to come, so stay tuned as VOA News Now continues. It's 2130 universal 
time, and this is VOA News Now. President Clinton and Palestinian 
leader Arafat end two hours of meeting in Gaza City trying to advance 
the Middle East peace process. With President Clinton at their meeting, 
Palestinian leaders again affirm their intention to change their charters 
so it will no longer call for the destruction of Israel. Those stories 
and more in this half hour of VOA News now. First, a summary of world 
news.
