Reeves' falcons can wrap up the NFC west title if the 49ers lose to 
the lions tonight. What was once a matchup of San Francisco's elaborate 
passing offense against Detroit's ground game is no longer just Jerry 
rice versus Barry sanders. You think about 49ers, you always think 
about young rice and two good, young receivers. But their running
