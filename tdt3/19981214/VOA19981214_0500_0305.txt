North Korea is reported to have dropped its demand for a $300 million 
to allow U.S. inspection of a suspected nuclear weapons site. Instead, 
the United States will offer more food aid and other economic benefits. 
Southern or South Korea newspapers reporting from Washington said 
the agreement was reached in a recent series of talks between the 
United States and North Korea in New York and Washington.
