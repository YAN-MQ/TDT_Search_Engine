The San Francisco 49ers host the Detroit Lions in the weekly Monday 
match up that will bring week 15 of the National Football League season 
to a close. The 49ers trail the Atlanta Falcons by 1-1/2 games in 
the AFC West and need a win to stay in contention for the division 
championship. That's because the Falcons defeated the New Orleans 
Saints on Sunday 27 to 17.
