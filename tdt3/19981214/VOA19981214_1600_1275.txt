The unbeaten University of Connecticut basketball team, which escaped 
a close call against Pittsburgh Saturday, remains atop the Associated 
Press men's college rankings. The Huskies rallied from a 13 point 
deficit in the second half to gain a 70 to 69 win to go 8 and 0 on 
the season. Duke is in second place in the poll moving up one spot 
after wins over Florida and Michigan. The Kentucky Wildcats moved 
from fifth to third after beating Maryland on Saturday, while Cincinnati 
remained in the fourth spot. Maryland, which was number two last week, 
dropped to number three. Stanford, North Carolina, and Arizona hold 
down the number six to number eight spots, although Purdue moved up 
into the tie for number eight. Indiana jumped one spot to number ten.
