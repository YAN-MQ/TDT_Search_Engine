I'm meteorologist Dave Hennen with your "CNN Headline News Weather." 
Temperatures today are again quite warm over much of the plains. Into 
the 50s and 60s today. It is seasonably cool though in sections of 
the northeast. 20s and 30s expected. And a little on the cool side 
in the southeast, as well. We check your forecast, looking for low 
pressure in the southwest to continue to track inland. Not a lot of 
precipitation associated with it. But we will find some light showers 
and some mountain snows. In the southeastern atlantic coastal sections, 
we'll find some showers associated with a weak area of low pressure, 
and the pacific northwest will see some wet weather as well. A look 
now at the extended forecast -- on Wednesday, expect windy conditions 
in through the northern plains. Some scattered showers in the southwest. 
And look for temperatures again to remain on the mild side. On into 
Thursday, again, warm temperatures back through the plains and the 
southeast. Temperatures will be coolest in the Great Lakes with the 
rain and snow mix anticipated there. On into Friday, rain and snow 
continue to push in through sections of the northeast. Look for some 
showers in the southwestern U.S. for even more weather information, 
you can log into CNN.com.
