Major League Baseball's all-time leading base stealer Ricki Henderson 
is now a member of the New York Mets. Henderson was signed to a one-year, 
$1.8 million contract. Henderson played for the Oakland Athletics 
last season where he led the majors with 66 stolen bases. That's more 
than the entire total for the Mets. Henderson is a 20-year veteran, 
and Mets general manager, Steve Phillips says his experience will 
help. Our reports are Ricki's defense were that it was more than adequate. 
To me, he still is focused on both sides of the field, although he 
has personal goals and motivations offensively. He plays to win, and 
he plays to game the well. He doesn't throw as well as he used to 
but he does cover a lot of ground, actually played some centerfield 
last year, and was more than adequate doing that. Henderson will turn 
40 on Christmas Day. He'll be the Met's new lead-off batter.
