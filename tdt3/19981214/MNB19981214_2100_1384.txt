More ahead as we continue in our next half-hourhis Monday evening. 
Now that their business is done hourks do members of the house Judiciary 
committee explain their votes? It was one of those moments in life 
you want to keep. My husband thought he was getting dinner. My daughter...A 
new friend. Time to cook the lobster! When the moment came, I didn't 
have to worry about the light being low hey! That's my lobster! Or 
them turning out blurry because they were moving. With Kodak Max, 
I knew I'd get my picture. Low light, sunlight, action or still Kodak 
Max is all you need to know about film.
