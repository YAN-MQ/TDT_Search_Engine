A former Rwandan militia leader has pleaded guilty to charges of genocide. 
As VOA's Scott Sterns reports, a United Nations tribunal is trying 
those accused of organizing the 1994 violence. Omar Farashago pleaded 
guilty to one count of genocide and three counts of crimes against 
humanity for his part in leading extremist members of the ethnic Hutu 
Interahamway militia. The charges relate to murder, torture, and extermination 
in Rwanda's northwest Gisenyi province. A panel of U.N. judges convicted 
Farashago on the four counts after prosecutors dropped a fifth count 
of crimes against humanity involving rape. Farashago is the second 
defendant to admit guilt before the U.N. tribunal. Former Prime Minister 
Jean Combando was sentenced to life in prison after pleading guilty 
in September. More than 800,000 people were killed in 1994 when supporters 
of Rwandan President Juvenal Habyarimana targeted ethnic Tutsi and 
political moderate Hutu who they accused of sympathizing with Tutsi 
rebels. Scott Sterns, VOA News, East Africa bureau.
