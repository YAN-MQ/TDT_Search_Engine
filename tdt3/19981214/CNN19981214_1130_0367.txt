In a referendum on statehood for Puerto Rico, "none of the above" 
appears to have come out on top. Voters in the U.S. commonwealth had 
a number of choices in the referendum. The statehood option received 
a little over 46% of the vote. But "none of the above," the option 
being pushed by anti-statehood forces, received over 50% of the vote. 
A 1993 vote on the issue produced very similar results.
