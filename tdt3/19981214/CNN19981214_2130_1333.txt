Panthers linebacker Kevin Greene was suspended for one game without 
pay for attacking assistant coach Kevin Steele Sunday. Head coach 
Dom capers said Greene's actions were unjustified. They both regret 
tremendously that it took place. They both feel bad about it. We've 
responded in what we feel is an appropriate manner. And they would 
both like to put it behind them and move on.
