This is VOA News Now from . I'm Les Carpenter, with Paul Westpheling, 
and we'll be right back. Have you talked about your child's health 
today. Malnutrition contributes to the deaths of more than six million 
children every year. Avoiding malnutrition means more than just providing 
food. Maintaining the overall health of a child is an important part 
of adequate nutrition. Because healthy children have better appetites, 
their bodies make better use of the foods they eat. Good access to 
basic health care and nutrition is important for children to grow 
strong and healthy. Find out from a health worker about the best foods 
to feed growing children. Your child's health is your family's future. 
Coming up on 10 hours 18 universal time. Here's the top news story 
we're following this hour. President Clinton and Palestinian leader 
Yasir Arafat are due to begin meetings at this hour in Gaza as part 
of Mr. Clinton's mission to bring the Wye River peace accord back 
on track. We'll have details on that and other news in about 12 minutes. 
But first, we're going to take an in-depth look at sports, and there 
was a lot of it on Sunday. Here's VOA's Ray Kougell.
