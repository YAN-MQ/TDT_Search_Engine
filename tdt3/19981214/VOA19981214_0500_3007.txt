MCI WorldCom, the number two American long distance phone carrier, 
has launched a $500-plus million takeover bid for Aussie Mail, Limited, 
one of Australia's biggest Internet service providers. MCI already 
has secured 15 percent of Aussie Mail through the purchase of new 
stock. Malcolm Turnball, chairman of Aussie Mail says the takeover, 
if successful, will help broaden his company's Internet outreach. 
Well, if the bid is successful, then we would - MCI WorldCom is a 
founding partner in a new cable that's running across the Pacific 
from East Coast of Australia to the West Coast of the United States. 
And so presumably, we would obtain greater access to on the cable. 
Aussie Mail has suffered over $11 million in losses in the first nine 
months of the year stalling expansion to the telecommunications market.
