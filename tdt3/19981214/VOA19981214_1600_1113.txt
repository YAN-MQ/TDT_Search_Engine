Also Sunday, the New York Giants ruined the perfect season of the 
Denver Broncos with a last minute 20 to 16 come-from-behind win at 
the Meadowlands outside New York. After a seesaw fourth quarter, the 
Broncos were leading 16 to 13 with the clock winding down. But on 
the Giant's final possession, quarterback Kent Graham tossed a 37-yard 
touchdown pass to Amani Tumer with just 48 seconds remaining. I think 
all of us just wanted to come out and play well as a team, and you 
know, get to where we wanted to be. And obviously, you know, we're 
not totally there yet, but this was a big step. Broncos quarterback 
John Elway does not like the loss but is more concerned with the team 
repeating as Super Bowl champions. I think if we'd had been able to 
stay undefeated, it would have added that much more to it. But, you 
know, our goal still is to try to repeat, so we'll still try to get 
that done.
