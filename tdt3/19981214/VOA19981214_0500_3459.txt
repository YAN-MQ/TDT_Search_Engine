Many of our local FM and medium wave affiliates are about to take 
a two-minute break. You're listening to VOA News Now. We don't want 
to shock you, but today is Monday, December 14th, 1998. I don't like 
- I don't mind the December 14th. It's the Monday that gets me. Yeah, 
I thought that'd wake you right up. On this date in 1799, George Washington, 
the first president of the United States and the victorious commander 
of the Continental Army during the Revolutionary War died. The 67-year-old 
leader was at his Mt. Vernon plantation in Virginia after two days 
of illness, after riding through rain and snow during inspection of 
his land. Washington's wife, Martha, became concerned when his condition 
worsened, and she called physicians. The doctors used the typical 
treatment of the era: put leaches all over him and bled him twice. 
Realizing that he was dying, the former president is reported to have 
said, "I am not afraid to go, but I die hard." George Washington's 
legacy to his country was that of a leader who conferred a basic dignity 
on the presidency. It's coming up on 11 hours universal time. We're

this is VOA News Now.
