Astronauts aboard the U.S. Space Shuttle Endeavour have launched an 
Argentine satellite designed to track endangered whale populations. 
The deployment of the joint U.S.-Argentine venture capped a workday 
highlighted by the separation of Endeavour from the fledgling International 
Space Station. The maneuver followed a week of connecting two modules, 
the Russian-built Czaria and the American built Unity. VOA's Jessica 
Berman reports. The undocking of the International Space Station from 
Endeavour's cargo bay took place around 20 hours 30 universal time 
Sunday, almost 400 kilometers above the Pacific Ocean. As the two 
space crafts separated, the shuttle slowly flew around the space station 
videotaping the spectacle. The fly around revealed stunning images 
of the space station floating away from the mother ship, the huge 
solar wings of the Russian Czaria module towering over the American 
Unity module. The glistening Pacific provided a breathtaking background.

camera video and it looks gorgeous. Then, just before 22 hours universal 
time, Endeavour fired its jets to leave the area of the International 
Space Station, completing the separation. Immediately after the release, 
Endeavour astronauts began stowing their equipment in preparation 
for the trip back home. The mission that began the construction on 
the seven story, 32 metric ton International Space Station ends Tuesday. 
During the 12-day operation, Endeavour astronauts performed three 
space walks to connect the modules and make repairs to the space station. 
The next mission is set for May, when the U.S. space agency, NASA, 
will send astronauts up on the Space Shuttle Discovery on an assembly 
and resupply mission. Jessica Berman, VOA News, Washington.
