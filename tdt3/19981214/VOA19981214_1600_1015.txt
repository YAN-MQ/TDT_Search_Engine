I'm Tony Riggs along with Victor Morales. This is VOA News Now. Have 
you talked about your child's health today. Some day, your little 
girl may marry and begin having her own children. Do you know that 
what she eats as a child will have an effect on the health and growth 
of her babies? Girls who are healthy and well fed during their own 
childhood and teenage years have fewer problems later in pregnancy 
and childbirth. Boys and girls need adequate amounts of nutritious 
foods to grow up strong and healthy. Find out from a health worker 
about the best foods to feed growing children. Your child's health 
is your family's future. Well, right now it's time for sports, and 
let's go to Parke Brewer for all the latest. All right, thank you 
very much, Victor.
