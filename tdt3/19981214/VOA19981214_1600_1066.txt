Norwegian skier Finn Christian Yaga has won the men's World Cup slalom 
race in Cestria, Italy for the second year in a row. The top three 
skiers finished the second run down the course Monday night exactly 
as they had ended the first one earlier under the flood lights. Yaga's 
margin of victory over run-up Thomas Strungyassinger of Austria was 
a slim 6/100ths of a second. Uri Kosher of Slovenia was third.
