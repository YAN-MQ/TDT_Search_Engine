And what about that rumored reunion tour featuring Bruce Springsteen 
and E Street Band? Well, it's true, although he's not announced any 
detailed plans. Sources suggest a spring/summer tour kicking off in 
Europe and then heading to the states. All the tour talk heated up 
once Bruce released his brand new four CD box set of unreleased tunes. 
It features this song, "Back in Your Arms," the result of a brief 
E Street union back in 1995. I'm Catherine Cole.
