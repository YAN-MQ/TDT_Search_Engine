United Nations Secretary General Kofi Annan says Iraq should get on 
with completing its disarmament obligations and stop its rhetoric 
against U.N. weapons inspectors. I do not condone what Iraq has been 
saying, nor should they have said it. I just want them to get on with 
the job, get on with disarmament, cooperate with UNSCOM and get it 
done. Iraq charges the commission is failing to report progress made 
in the disarmament process. Chief U.N. inspector Richard Butler is 
to report to the secretary general Tuesday on Iraqi cooperation since 
the inspectors returned to work last month.
