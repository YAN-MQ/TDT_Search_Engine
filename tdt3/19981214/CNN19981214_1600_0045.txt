CNN has learned President Clinton, Palestinian leader Yasser Arafat 
and israeli prime minister Benjamin Netanyahu have agreed to meet 
at the israel/Gaza border tomorrow. That, after a vote by the Palestine 
national council which president clinton is calling a powerful message 
to the people of Israel. He made the comment while visiting Gaza as 
part of his Middle East tour. It's the first time a U.S. president 
has stepped on Palestinian-controlled soil. Mr. Clinton looked on, 
as the PNC voted to reaffirm its decision to drop language calling 
for the destruction of the Jewish state from its charter. The step, 
included in the wye river land-for-security accord, was a key israeli 
demand. Both Arafat and President Clinton say the Middle East peace 
process must stay on track. I am content to realize that our target 
for a better life, for the two people, Palestinians and Israelis, 
the future must depend on a Mutual respect and toleration because 
the needs of the two sides and everyone as a participant and this 
way we can build a better future, a Future that people will stop suffering. 
I thank you, Mr. chairman, for leadership, for peace and your perseverance, 
for enduring all the criticism from all sides, for being willing to 
change course and for being strong enough to stay with what is right. 
You have done a remarkable thing for your people.
