In Dairy, New Hampshire Alan Swan is happy with all the lights he's 
put on his house for the Christmas season, but the power company is 
not. You see, he's got 25,000 lights on the house, and when Mr. Swan 
turned them on, he blew out an electric power transformer. This happened 
two nights in a row, so the utility, what do they do? Turn off the 
lights? No. They installed more powerful transformer to service all 
those lights. That should keep all of Alan Swan's lights on without 
putting further strain on the system. However, there is some accountants 
somewhere in the electric utility saying, "Money, money, money, money. 
Here's the bill."
