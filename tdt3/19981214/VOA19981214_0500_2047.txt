While the president meets with Palestinian leaders, his wife, Hillary 
Rodham Clinton, will visit one of Gaza's eight refugee camps. Many 
Palestinian women say they are pleased Mrs. Clinton is coming to see 
for herself the overcrowded and poor conditions of the camps where 
unemployment is a major concern. Mrs. Clinton gained the favor of 
many Palestinians in May while visiting Europe when she expressed 
support for Palestinian statehood. While speaking to high school students 
in Geneva, she said a separate state would create stability in the 
Middle East.
