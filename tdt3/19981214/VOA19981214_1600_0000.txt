Palestinian leaders once again affirm that they'll change the language 
in the PLO charter that calls for Israel's destruction. The U.S. president 
has not left the impeachment matter behind him and reacts angry to 
Republican calls for his resignation. Angola's UNITA rebels shoot 
down a plane, witnesses say, that was carrying women and children 
who were fleeing the fighting. Algeria's prime minister resigns, and 
presidential elections for that country are coming soon. Iran's supreme 
leader and president condemn a wave of deadly attacks against dissidents 
and vow to go after the killers. Hello, I'm Victor Morales. And I'm 
Tony Riggs. We'll have details on these and other stories, plus sports, 
business news, and the popular but pricey toys Americans are buying 
this holiday season. First, a summary of world news. I'm Carol Castiel,
