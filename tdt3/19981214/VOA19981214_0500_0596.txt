In Cambodia, hopes are fading for three aid workers kidnapped by former 
Khmer Rouge guerrillas and their employers contradicting a senior 
commander, who says the three are on good health. As Hugh Watkin reports 
from Phnom Penh, the claim and counterclaim came as a local newspaper 
sharply criticized authorities for failing to contain a spate of kidnappings 
in the capital. The country director of Care International, which 
employed the three Cambodian nationals says that with each passing 
day, concern about the missing trio grows. The three were conducting 
a health education program in remote Phante Machay province when they 
were kidnapped. Care International's Neil Hawkins says he has heard 
from neither the captives nor their abductors for seven days, and 
that the organization now holds grave fears for the aid workers' safety. 
They were alleged to have been snatched by rogue elements of former 
Khmer Rouge Division 519, whose commander recently defected to the 
government promising his troops would lay down their arms. Mr. Hawkins 
says his organization is cooperating closely with military units scouring 
the area. The commander of military region five, General Ko Chien, 
insists the captives are alive. The guerrillas had threatened to kill 
their hostages unless a ransom totaling $3,000 was paid by last Wednesday 
afternoon. But General Chien says what he calls bandits have reduced 
their ransom demand to about $2,000. He says, however, he is at a 
loss of what to do because Care International has requested that no 
force be used to free the trio, and the government has a policy of 
not paying ransom demands. Meanwhile, in a rare anti-government outburst, 
the Resma Kapachiya newspaper slammed authorities for failing to stop 
a wave of kidnappings that which has seen at least ten businessmen 
grabbed in Phnom Penh within the past two months. Monday's edition 
of the paper, which is usually considered a mouthpiece of the ruling 
Cambodian People's Party carried a page one article which accused 
police of either incompetence or collusion with professional kidnapping 
gangs. This is Hugh Watkin for VOA News, Phnom Penh.
