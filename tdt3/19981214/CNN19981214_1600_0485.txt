In what's believed to be a first, an Ohio man is being punished for 
failing to switch off an air bag in his truck. Dwight childs' infant 
son was killed in a crash last may. Childs ignored warnings posted 
inside his truck to turn off the air bag if a child was in the passenger 
side. He pleaded no contest to charges of vehicular homicide. And 
has been sentenced to spend two 12-hour days in jail next year -- 
on the boy's birthday and the anniversary of his death.
