President Clinton is now in Gaza on the West Bank, the first ever 
visit by a U.S. president to the Palestinian-controlled Gaza Strip. 
The chairman of the House Judiciary Committee urges President Clinton 
to resign from office, but Mr. Clinton says he has no intention of 
doing that despite a pending vote on impeachment. Israeli Prime Minister 
Netanyahu publicly appeals to President Clinton for the release of 
convicted spy, Jonathan Pollard. Teams of U.N. arms inspectors are 
leaving Iraq after completing their latest round of surprise searches 
for banned weapons of mass destruction. Votes in Puerto Rico have 
opted to continue the island's current status and not petition the 
U.S. Congress to become a state. I'm Paul Westpheling. And I'm Les 
Carpenter. We'll have details just ahead, plus sports and the latest 
business news all in this hour of VOA News Now. The news is next. 
I'm Phillip Alexio VOA News.
