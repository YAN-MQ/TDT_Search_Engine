The National Football League's New York Giants ruined a perfect season 
run of the Denver Broncos in the surprising last-minute 20 to 16 come-from-behind 
win at the Meadowlands in New Jersey. After a seesaw fourth quarter 
Sunday, the Broncos were leading 16 to 13 with the clock winding down. 
But on the Giant's final possession, quarterback Kent Crane tossed 
a 37-yard touchdown pass to Monte Tumro with just 48 seconds remaining. 
Giants defender Michael Strayam says it was the biggest win since 
he's played in New York. Playing against an undefeated team, our team 
was to go out and play spoiler. We having to do it today. I tell you 
what, this is probably the biggest victory we've had since I've been 
here. Quarterback John Elway was naturally disappointed by the Bronco's 
loss. If we would have been undefeated, it would have been a nice, 
you know, throw in there, but you know, now we're not. The season's 
not going down the drain, I know that. Denver is now 13 and 1. The 
defeat also ended Denver's 18-game winning streak going back to last 
season.
