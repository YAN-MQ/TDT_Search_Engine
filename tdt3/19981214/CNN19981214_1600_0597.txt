The social security administration is taking a cue from mutual funds. 
It's going to start mailing all contributors monthly statements. John 
metaxas explains. The social security administration started mailing 
yearly statements to individuals age 60 and over in 1995. By late 
next year, all workers age 25 and older will get one. All Americans 
should have a statement that shows their earnings record through their 
lifetime, the amount of social security taxes they have contributed, 
and general estimates of what they should receive in retirement. For 
many, the statement offers a first glimpse at their social security 
savings. Everybody should take this opportunity of looking at that 
statement and make sure it is correct. The social security system 
is not infallible and it has been known to make major dramatic errors. 
The social security administration has set up a web site, ssa.gov, 
and a toll-free number to call to make corrections to your account. 
The statement tells you what your monthly benefit will be under three 
scenarios -- if you retire early at age 62 with reduced benefits, 
if you stop at full retirement at the standard age of 65 or if you 
keep working at your current earnings until age 70. If somebody is 
already in their high 50s or low 60s, and you see those numbers, you 
may depend upon those numbers. They're going to be very accurate. 
If you are in your 40s, not so. If you are in your 20s, it's a cute 
little number. Tuck it inside in your drawer and do not under any 
circumstances depend on it. Because possible social security reform 
-- which could include privatization -- may alter the level of future 
benefits, these numbers may change. Financial planners say social 
security should provide only a portion of your retirement income. 
You are responsible for the rest. That's "your money," John metaxas, 
"CNN Financial News," New York.
