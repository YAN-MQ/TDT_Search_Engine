This look at your "CNN Headline News Weather" begins with our forecast 
weather map for Tuesday morning. Snowfall will continue in the higher 
elevations of the southwest. However, this is a relatively weak area 
of low pressure that moved in through California over the weekend. 
And you can see, as we go through the day tomorrow, the area of precipitation 
will be diminishing. Meanwhile, a cold front moves through the plains 
states and into the east. This will bring to an end the very warm 
temperatures we've been seeing in the northern plains states. Tomorrow, 
we'll see daytime highs in the 20s and 30s, whereas today, that same 
area was seeing high temperatures in the 50s. Here is your extended 
forecast -- windy conditions in the northern plains states as we head 
on into Wednesday. Temperatures are still relatively mild for this 
time of year. Moving on into Thursday, you see windy and a rain/snow 
mix expected in the Great Lakes area. And as we head on into Friday, 
rain, snow, windy conditions continue in the Great Lakes region. For
