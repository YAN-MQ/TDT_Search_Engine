The tallest Christmas tree in Europe is now shining brightly over 
Athens, greece. The tree, which stands over 100 feet tall, was unveiled 
Friday. In keeping with an environmental theme, instead of cutting 
down a real pine, the tree was made of 180,000 light bulbs. The Athens 
philharmonic accompanied the lighting, playing a number of christmas 
carols.
