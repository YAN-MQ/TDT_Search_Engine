Amid the economic turmoil in Asia, China remains an attractive location 
for investors. From Hong Kong, Grace Cutler reports a survey by the 
American Chamber of Commerce shows many companies plan to increase 
their investments in China or get into the market over the next three 
years. The survey which polled over 430 companies from several countries 
and industries found an overwhelming 91 percent say the business outlook 
in China over the next five years is either favorable or very favorable. 
Some of the reasons China gets high scores, the survey says, are low 
labor costs, export opportunities, and domestic market expansion. 
And some of the best places to do business, say the respondents, are 
Shanghai, Beijing, and Guandong Province in Southern China. Bob Brodford, 
managing director of the Economic and Political Consultancy in Hong 
Kong says China's economy, which grew 7.2 percent in the first three 
quarters of this year has captured the attention of investors. China 
has performed throughout the period when the rest of Asia is in crisis 
much stronger. And so we've seen companies shifting the focus of some 
of their developments from Southeast Asia, which has lost its attraction, 
to mainland China. The more that China avoids the worst effects of 
the regional recession, the more favorable its potential is viewed 
in the medium term. But Mr. Brodford says China's legal system and 
the lack of transparency in its laws and regulations are among the 
factors that still make China one of the most difficult markets in 
the world. I doubt very much that anyone in that survey's going to 
say that doing business in China is easy. I think what their sentiment 
is that they recognize that there is growth opportunity there if they 
play their cards right. Despite the increased business interest in 
China in growth and investment, many analysts are skeptical about 
the ability of China to maintain its strong growth. They say China's 
continued economic success is dependent upon the clean up of its bad 
debt-laden banking system and of its lumbering state-owned enterprises.
