The gift of travel is a popular holiday present. And giving it could 
help you save some cash. Kalin Thomas-Samuel explains in today's "working 
ahead" report. This time of year, many travelers may be short on cash 
and heavy on frequent flier miles. With little effort, miles can be 
turned into holiday gifts. I usually have frequent flier miles. I 
give them away to her. If they need something to go somewhere or something 
like that, and don't really have the funds to be able to buy a ticket, 
then I'd rather do that for them than give them something that they 
can't use. If you're eligible for an award, you can designate your 
award to go to someone else. What's not allowed is transferring your 
miles to someone else's frequent flier account. Some airlines do let 
you buy miles to add to the recipient's account. Even upgrade awards 
make good gifts. You can buy the cheap ticket or the person can buy 
a cheap ticket and then with this mileage award can upgrade it and, 
for once, travel in a Comfortable seat. Frequent flier miles can also 
be perfect corporate gifts. Companies donate their mileages to their 
employees as incentive packages. I think that's good. Airlines say 
it's a way to thank clients or employees. But even when awards are 
given as gifts, restrictions and black-out dates may still apply.
