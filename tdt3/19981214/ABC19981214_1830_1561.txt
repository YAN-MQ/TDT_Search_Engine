Finally this evening, the president's trip to the Middle East, which 
means mr. Clinton and the Palestinians. There are a lot of people 
who wondered if any of this day would ever come. Journalists have 
been covering the Palestinian/Israeli struggle for a long time. Through 
it all, the idea of an American president going to visit palestinians 
where they were in charge, that was something many of us thought might 
never gel. Gillian Findlay was there today. Even the children of Gaza 
understood the importance of the day. For hours, they practiced their 
Greetings -- Welcome. Welcome. -- for the man Palestinians believe 
will help deliver them their long-awaited state. America, which is 
the largest country and the most important country in the world believe 
in us. That means everyone in the world must believe in us. There 
was excitement on Gaza's main road, in the back alleys of refugee 
camps. In the end, few gazans actually saw the president. Security 
concerns were so high, he traveled to most kplass by helicopter. In 
the shati refugee camp, word that Hillary Clinton would visit drew 
a Small crowd. For listening to Palestinians and giving them a voice. 
The Clintons understand the Palestinian pain, she says, now everybody 
knows we've been oppressed and occupied. Gaza's love affair with America 
is a new one. For generations, children here were raised to resent 
America because of its support of Israel. And today, not everyone 
was ready to forget that. As the na'eem family watched the president 
arrive today, there was no cheering. No faith at all in the peace 
agreement Mr. Clinton was here to promote. He just tries to play games 
with us. Azi abu hassera used to think that way, too. Back in the 
days of the Palestinian uprising. But as he watched the president's 
speech today, the former rock-thrower turned policeman said Clinton 
was right. Palestinians have to accept things have changed. "It's 
a new era," he says, "an era of peace." Gillian Findlay, ABC News, 
Gaza.
