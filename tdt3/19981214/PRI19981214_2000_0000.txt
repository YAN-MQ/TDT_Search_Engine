The World, a coproduction of the BBC World Service, PRI and WGBH, 
Boston. It's Monday, December 14th. I'm Lisa Mullens in Boston. Today, 
the I word. At home and abroad, in Washington, it's impeachment. But 
in Gaza, it's independence. We'll have the latest on President Clinton's 
escape to the Middle East. Also, a Russian reformer on his country's 
difficult passage to democracy. It's a very complicated, difficult 
transition. What you did in 200 years, we are doing in 2 or 3 years. 
And why Europe and the United States are going bananas over bananas, 
and how Brazilian cinema fell under the spell of a woman who wore 
bananas. First, this news.
