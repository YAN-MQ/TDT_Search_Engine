The International Team of Golfers has defeated the United States to 
capture the President's Cup Title for the first time. Beyond a perfect 
5 and 0 play of Shiyegi Muriyama of Japan, the Internationals cruised 
to 20-1/2 to 11-1/2 win. It was the United States' worst ever defeat 
in international play surprising America's Mark Kopkaveckio. We came 
here thinking we were going to win. At least I did. I'm pretty sure 
everybody else on our team did. But you got to hand it to them, you 
know, it wasn't even close. It's the second straight loss in team 
competition for the Americans, which was led by the four top ranked 
players in the world. The U.S. team lost to Europe by one point in 
the Ryder Cup last year.
