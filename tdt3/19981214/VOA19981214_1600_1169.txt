The other New York team, the Jets, had a pretty good day as well, 
clinching their first playoff berth in seven years by handing the 
Miami Dolphins their first home loss of the season, 21 to 16. Also 
on Sunday, the winners: the Buffalo Bills, Washington Redskins, Green 
Bay Packers, and Indianapolis Colts, Tennessee Oilers, Arizona Cardinals, 
Tampa Bay Buccaneers, the St. Louis Rams, Seattle Seahawks, Minnesota 
Vikings. And an upset, the Kansas City Chiefs beat the Dallas Cowboys.
