Despite Baltimore's problems, the latest statistics from the federal 
government show an overall drop in violent crime nationwide. Tom Watkins 
reports. The new FBI figures show violent crime in the first half 
of this year dropped 7% from the first half of last year. Murder, 
down 8%. Robbery, aggravated assault and forcible rape, all down significantly. 
Property crimes fell 5%, with arson and motor vehicle theft down even 
more. The drops occurred nationwide, though the greatest decrease 
was reported in the northeast, but it's unclear who or what should 
get the credit. They tried one set of interventions in Boston, another 
set of interventions in New York, another set in Los Angeles. Others 
in Milwaukee and Chicago, and in most all of these large cities, the 
rates came down. There are some cities where they didn't do any specific 
programs and the rates also came down. Down, but still a public health 
threat. If you compare the rates of homicide victimization of young 
men in this country to 22 other industrialized countries, the U.S. 
is number one. Before U.S. cities can lose that distinction, city 
planners first have to figure out what they've been doing right for 
the past years. Tom Watkins, "Headline News."
