Salt Lake City, the site of the winter Olympic games in 2002 in Utah. 
They have been celebrating and preparing for that and the windfall 
of hosting the games. Now a growing scandal over how they won the 
rights is turning into a Gold-plated disaster. More tonight from NBC's 
Kelly O'Donnell. To the city of Salt Lake City. Utah's celebration 
back in '95, when Salt Lake City was awarded the winter games of 2002. 
Utah will gain tens of thousands of dollars. Was the victory for salt 
lake a clean win or was it bought? Now allegations of bribery, votes 
for sale maim public by a member of the iOC itself. There is a very 
complete file of payments made to members of the IOC to possible relatives 
of the IOC. The whistleblower claims in exchange for $5 million, unnamed 
agents could deliver votes. The top official in Salt Lake City admits 
payments were made in the form of scholarships. I apologize to the 
Olympic family and to the citizens of Utah for the embarrassment. 
The committee that ran salt lake's campaign spent almost $400,000 
on 13 foreign students, six of them related to IOC members. Over the 
past eight years covered tuition for students from developing nations 
attending schools including the American University, brigham young 
and the University of Utah. Some received $500 a month to cover living 
expenses. Salt lake officials say they have started an investigation. 
They say they gave scholarship money to IOC relatives but say their 
city won or merit, not paid influence. Critics say this is part of 
the game and salt lake got caught. Kelly O'Donnell, NBC news, Los 
Angeles.
