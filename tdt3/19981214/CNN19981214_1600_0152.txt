Israel's prime Minster welcomed today's vote by the PNC, calling it 
"an important and positive step." But Benjamin Netanyahu says the 
vote is still not enough to clear the way for an Israeli troop pullback 
in the West Bank. Among other things, he says Palestinians must work 
harder to curb violence against Israelis, and give up plans to declare 
a Palestinian state. There's been a very clear majority. I believe 
it's almost two-thirds according to the information we have of the 
PNC have voted for this. This shows that if we insist we achieve what 
we insist upon. And this will lead to a real peace, a lasting peace, 
not a minute-long peace. Such a peace can be achieved only if we insist 
on the conditions for a Lasting peace. Netanyahu is expected to tour 
the ruins of masada with the first family tomorrow.
