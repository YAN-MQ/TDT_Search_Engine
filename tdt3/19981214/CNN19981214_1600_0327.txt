Compared to the last impeachment hearings, in 1974, the public appears 
relatively indifferent this time. David Ensor asks, "why the difference?" 
In the capitol rotunda, the tourists, awed by this nation's history, 
have little sense they could have any influence over the historic 
events unfolding in Washington. Chris willemsen, a graduate student 
at Harvard, strongly opposes impeaching the president. I don't think 
we feel like we have much power here. I mean, my representative is 
Barney Frank, and I don't know what to do -- ask him to be more vigorous 
in his defense of the president? I mean, what can I say? Connie Duffy 
of Charlotte, North Carolina, is in Washington teaching her son about 
American history. She would like a different outcome. I favor impeachment 
for future generations. But neither those who favor impeachment, nor 
the large majority who oppose it, are out marching this time or calling 
their congressmen, like they did during Watergate. A new CNN/"USA 
today" Gallup poll shows, only 25% of Americans are following the 
hearings very closely. Washington insiders like Steve Roberts, who 
live and breath the impeachment debate, are searching for reasons. 
I think the main factor simply is that people care more about what 
happens in their own living rooms, their children's classrooms, their 
doctors examining rooms, than they care about what happened in the 
president's bedroom or the oval office. I think there's a certain 
sense of disbelief that this is actually happening. You know, a certain 
sense that this is just politics as usual. And I think in the next 
coming days, people are going to wake up and say, "This is for real, 
these people are very serious." Stockbroker Tim Adams expects those 
like himself, against impeachment, to speak out in the coming days. 
But others are doubtful, saying people know the votes to impeach the 
president simply aren't there in the U.S. Senate. Maybe they don't 
think the president's going to get kicked out, I mean, I don't think 
he's going to get kicked out. Standing before Andrew Jackson's statue, 
Chris willemsen told her daughter how he once got into trouble with 
the Congress, was censured and still ended up in the capitol rotunda.
