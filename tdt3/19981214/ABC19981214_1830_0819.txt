"On the money" tonight, jobs are going up in smoke at the nation's 
second largest tobacco company. RJR Nabisco is cutting 3,900 jobs 
here and in Russia. They expect to sell fewer cigarettes here because 
of the increase to pay for the tobacco settlement with the states 
in Russia, thanks to bad economic times, RJR is selling fewer premium 
brands, such as camel and winston.
