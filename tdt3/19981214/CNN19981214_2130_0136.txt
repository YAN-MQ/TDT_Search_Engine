Israeli prime minister Netanyahu has shown no indication he's ready 
to release any more Palestinian prisoners. Many Palestinians in Gaza 
are hoping President Clinton can help him change his mind. Andrea 
Koppel has more. Like the night before Christmas, reem tarazi was 
so excited about President Clinton's historic visit to Gaza Monday, 
she could hardly sleep. "It's like a Christmas present," she gushed. 
As the daughter of one of Gaza's wealthiest families, 13-year-old 
reem was chosen to greet Mr. Clinton as he and Yasser Arafat inaugurated 
the newly opened Gaza international airport. For many Palestinians, 
President Clinton's trip to Gaza, like their airport, is yet another 
symbol of Palestinian sovereignty. "It's a recognition of our Palestinian 
state," reem's father explained matter-of-factly. "Once President 
Clinton is in Gaza, it's as if he recognizes us as a Palestinian people. 
Still, for an equal number of Palestinians, the desire for president 
clinton to support their quest for sovereignty is secondary to another 
key concern -- the release of Palestinian prisoners from Israeli jails. 
That was the message another young Palestinian delivered to president 
clinton when she met him Monday. But for 12-year-old nihad zaqout, 
the American president's trip wasn't exciting or fun. It was, however, 
a rare chance to bring her father's case to the attention of her government's 
most powerful guest. "There's no peace without the release of all 
prisoners," she says. Ten years ago, nihad's father killed two Israelis 
and has been serving a Life sentence ever since. For a 12-year-old 
growing up in one of the biggest, poorest and most crowded refugee 
camps in Gaza, it's made life even more difficult. "They have a father, 
and I don't," she sobs, "their fathers ask about them, but my father 
can't." And so unless President Clinton can convince the Israeli government 
to release her father from prison, the American president's trip to 
Gaza has little meaning for nihad or her family. And tomorrow will 
be just another day. Andrea Koppel, CNN, Gaza.
