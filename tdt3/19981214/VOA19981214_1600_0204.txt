Presidential elections in Guinea-Conakry appear to have gone smoothly 
today despite an atmosphere of tension following a day of election-related 
violence during the weekend. Correspondent John Pitman reports from 
our West Africa bureau. Reports from Guinea-Conakry paint a conflicting 
picture of Monday's elections. On one hand, international election 
observers say the vote appeared to have been relatively well organized 
with only a few minor difficulties. However, news reports quoting 
opposition leaders say the election was marred by widespread irregularities. 
The leading opposition candidate, Moma Duba, of the Renewal and Progress 
Party said Monday that polling stations in areas where his support 
is strongest lacked the proper materials to let everyone vote. Meanwhile, 
despite the opposition's charges of election fraud, voters were able 
to cast their ballots in relative calm. Security was reportedly tight 
to discourage a repeat of Saturday's political clashes, which left 
several people dead and dozens injured in the capital, Conakry. John 
Pitman, VOA News, West Africa bureau.
