There are political disruptions elsewhere in the world. The prime 
minister of Algeria has resigned. VOA Middle East correspondent Scott 
Bob reports the resignation comes as Algeria prepares for early presidential 
elections in the coming months. Prime Minister Ahmed Ouyahia's resignation 
was accepted immediately Monday by President Liamine Zeroual. It ended 
an often stormy two-years at the helm of the Algerian government. 
The Algerian news media has been speculating for weeks that the prime 
minister would resign in order to run for president. Several newspapers 
reported Monday former ambassador to France, Smahil Humdanni, is considered 
likely to replace him. The political scene in Algeria has been in 
turmoil since last September, when President Zeroual unexpectedly 
announced presidential elections would be held next year, 19 months 
early, and he would not be a candidate for reelection. The outgoing 
prime minister is considered one of several likely candidates for 
president, although he is not viewed by most as a front runner. Opposition 
parties have been demanding Mr. Ouyahia's resignation in recent weeks. 
They accuse him of responsibility for irregularities in last year's 
parliamentary elections, which they say unduly favored the ruling 
party, the National Democratic Rally. Mr. Ouyahia is credited with 
launching economic reforms that have stabilized the Algerian economy 
and reduced inflation. But the severe austerity measures that accompany 
the reforms raised unemployment and lowered standards of living. Critics 
also hold Mr. Ouyahia responsible for failing to stem the violence 
that has plagued the country since the cancellation six years ago 
of national elections which Islamist parties were poised to win. Since 
then, an estimated 60,000 people have been killed in attacks which 
are blamed on Islamic militants and pro-government militias. The violence 
has escalated dramatically in recent weeks. This past week, authorities 
recovered the remains of an estimated 110 civilians from a well on 
a farm 30 kilometers southwest of Algiers. The Algerian news media 
say it is the worst single incidents of violence yet. It raises the 
death toll in the past two weeks alone to more than 200. Scott Bob,
