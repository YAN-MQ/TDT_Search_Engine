Attention in the Middle East has been sidetrackedagain by talk of 
President Clinton's possible impeachment back home. The BBC's Bridget 
Kendall reports. Forced by reporters to assess his chances of fending 
off an impeachment vote in Congress, Mr. Clinton today went on the 
offensive. The process of impeachment, he said, and a trial in the 
Senate, were not in the interests of the American people. His press 
secretary was rather blunter. Attacks on the president, including 
calls for his resignation by Republican leaders yesterday, he said, 
had rewritten the book on partisanship. It set a new low standard, 
he said, and brought no credit to the Republican leadership. Bridget 
Kendall, BBC, Gaza City.
