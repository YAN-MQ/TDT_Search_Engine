Barbie goes shopping. I'm Myron Kandel at the "CNN Financial News" 
desk in New York and this is "Dollars & Sense." Toy giant Mattel which 
makes Barbie, will buy the learning company for $3.8 billion in stock. 
The learning company makes such educational software as Rita rabbit 
and national geographic programs. In summer they acquired other software. 
Mattel warned today that earnings for the fourth quarter and the year 
will be significantly weaker than expected.
