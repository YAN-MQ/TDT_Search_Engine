North Koreans reported to have dropped its demand for a $300 million 
payment to allow U.S. inspection of a suspected nuclear weapons site. 
Instead, the United States will offer more food aid and other economic 
benefits to the starving Stalinist nation. South Korea newspapers 
reporting from Washington said the agreement was reached in a recent 
series of talks between the United States and North Korea and New 
York and in Washington. The two sides also agreed to continue talks 
on the suspected underground nuclear site sometime before four-party 
peace talks resume next month in Geneva. The United States is demanding 
inspection of a site at Kumchangde, which it suspects the north might 
be using to develop nuclear weapons in violation of a 1994 energy 
agreement.
