Before Lewinsky gate, a little scandal called Watergate launched a 
handful of careers. Howard Kurtz takes a look at what some of the 
people from that era are doing now. The house impeachment debate has 
not exactly been an uplifting exercise. No great profiles in courage 
on Capitol Hill. You are required to specify what phrases, words were 
-- Reclaiming my time, the gentleman has no precedent for that in 
terms of the -- There's plenty of precedent for it. There certainly 
-- well, I've reclaimed my time. Things were very different back in 
the days of Watergate. The proceedings against Richard Nixon had a 
certain gravity. Never in our 198 years have we had evidence of such 
rampant corruption in government. And plenty of careers were launched. 
William safire was a Nixon speech writer. Now, he's a Pulitzer prize-winning 
columnist for "the New York Times." Father John McLaughlin was the 
president's spiritual supporter. Now, he's the bombastic host of "the 
McLaughlin group." Pat Buchanan stuck with Nixon till the bitter end. 
You can see him these days on "crossfire," when he's not running for 
president. There was a cancer growing on the presidency. John dean 
was the star witness of the Watergate hearings and landed in jail. 
Now, he's all over the tube, sometimes as an MSNBC legal analyst. 
Some investigators did pretty well for themselves. Fred Thompson was 
republican counsel to the Senate Watergate committee. He went on to 
become a movie star. And I imagine you'll tell me what all the hubbub's 
about. And to play a real-life role as a United States senator. And 
the reporters? Well, Dan rather had a memorable confrontation with 
Nixon. Are you running for something? No, sir, Mr. president, are 
you? He's been in the CBS anchor chair almost as long as Walter cronkite. 
And there were a couple of local reporters named Woodward and bernstein. 
They wound up -- much better-looking -- on the silver screen. Maybe 
20 years from now, Mike McCurry will be a network anchor, Bill clinton 
will be the new Oprah, and Ken Starr will be hosting "Burden of proof." 
But don't count on it. Watergate was a grave constitutional crisis. 
The players came to seem larger than life. But impeachment vote or 
not, much of the public still views the sex-and-lies case against 
President Clinton as X-rated entertainment. This is Howard Kurtz of 
CNN's "reliable sources."
