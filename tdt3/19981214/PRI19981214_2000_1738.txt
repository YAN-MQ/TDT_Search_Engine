You're listening to The World. Don't forget, you can join us any time 
online at www.theworld.org. This is PRI, Public Radio International. 
Programming on 91 F.M. is supported by WHYY Store of Knowledge, offering 
people of all ages thousands of things to pick up, play with and explore, 
with locations in Cherry Hill, Willow Grove, the Court at King of 
Prussia and Edford Mall. I'm Lisa Mullens. Still to come on The World: 
the United States as role model for a corruption-fighting Russian 
reformer, and Carmen Miranda as role model for a Latin American actress. 
I was very young when I came to this country, and I quickly found 
out that the only way to have people pay attention to you is to be 
vivacious and fiery. First, though, this news.
