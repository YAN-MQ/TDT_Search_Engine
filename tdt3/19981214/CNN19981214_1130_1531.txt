Instead of going down to the Christmas tree lot and buying a holiday 
centerpiece, some families in California are taking a more rugged 
approach. Susan Reed has more. This family got up at 5:30 on a Sunday 
morning, drove hours to cut a Christmas tree that when decorated, 
looks like something Charlie brown would have. But that's okay. Instead 
of spending $50 on a Christmas tree, we spend $2 on a day with the 
family. And you have a snoopy tree. Timber! Each year, Los padres 
national forest gives out 500 permits, $2 each, that let people cut 
down a tree. What better excuse to get up on the mountain and get 
out in the outdoors with the family. You can't buy this at a Christmas 
tree lot. The forest service isn't trying to compete with the tree 
lot. They don't advertise and only allow tree cutting for two weeks. 
And this helps out the forest service too because they were planning 
on cutting down the small trees to help the forest grow. As a general 
rule, the forest service doesn't want to encourage the idea of people 
cutting trees in a national forest. It's very unusual for people to 
come to the forest and cut their own christmas trees. This is the 
only place in southern California. The only place in southern California 
it's legal. The Los Angeles national forest, a half hour north of 
Los Angeles, is having a big problem with tree poaching. Some people 
don't know it's forbidden. Some people do it simply because they don't 
have the money to buy a tree. But if you don't have a permit, the 
$1,000 per tree fine could ruin your holiday. Susan Reed, CNN, the 
Los padres national forest.
