Rebel forces in Congo-Kinshasa say they shot down a fighter jet and 
a helicopter attacking their positions Sunday around the southeastern 
Congolese town of Caballo. Rebel leader, Ernest Juamba Diajuamba, 
says troops allied to the Congolese government dropped bombs on rebel 
positions at Caballo. Earlier in the day, Congolese ally, Zimbabwe, 
admitted losing a helicopter gun ship and suffering casualties in 
Congo-Kinshasa but it has not mentioned the jet fighter.
