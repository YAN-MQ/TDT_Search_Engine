This look at your "CNN Headline News Weather" begins with our forecast 
weather map for Tuesday morning. Still a little bit of precipitation 
in the southwest. This is associated with a storm that rolled in through 
California over the weekend. Not a lot of snowfall is expected. But 
the high elevations will see some snow to be sure. Much of the rest 
of the nation will be dry. A few showers and a little bit of drizzle 
lingers along the southeastern coast. As we put this map in motion, 
you can see the cold front moving out of the plains states and to 
the east and bringing to an end the inordinately warm temperatures 
that we've been finding in the plains states. Daytime highs tomorrow 
in some places in the upper midwest only in the 30s. Today, those 
very same places seeing highs in the 50s. Your extended forecast calls 
for generally mild weather, however, to continue for much of the nation 
as you can see. And as we head into Thursday, a rain/snow mix is possible 
in the Great Lakes area. And you can still see some icy mix expected 
in the southern Rockies. As we move into Friday, rain, snow, windy 
conditions in the eastern Great Lakes area. And for more weather information 
you can log on to CNN.com.
