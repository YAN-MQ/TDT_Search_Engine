And now to Washington -- the impeachment watch overshadows everything 
else. So every night this week, we'll check in with cokie Roberts, 
George stephanopoulos, and Bill kristol. Let me start with you, George. 
You said yesterday you thought that the president would be able to 
pull it out. Do you think the same thing today? He still got a chance 
but they think at the White House today is there's nothing more they 
can do. They don't think the situation is quite hopeless, but they 
feel helpless because the president simply can't say that he lied, 
which is what the republicans want to hear. Are you absolutely convinced 
the president will never this week say he did not lie? I'm pretty 
sure of that, Peter. What they're worried about, even if he then says 
it and picks up a few republican votes, many more republicans will 
say now that he's admitted it, we must impeachment him. We've been 
talking a lot about the undecided. Do we really mean the undeclared 
and are a lot of republicans keeping their heads low to avoid the 
pressure? I think that's true in part. I think there are some that 
are undecided. They don't seem terribly concerned about the polls. 
60/40 against them. That means in their district it's probably 50/50. 
I think to be fair to them, they think this is a historic vote, genuinely 
a Vote of conscience. They really are trying to make up their mined. 
Why would somebody be undecided at this late date? There are serious 
arguments on both sides. We've had them all before though for months. 
Fair enough, but not everyone is as quick as us in making up their 
mind. Maybe the president will say something new that would change 
the balance of opinion in their mind. Maybe it is a way of putting 
off a decision. Some Peter -- one of them said to me today, the president's 
lawyers said, read his testimony and you'll see he didn't lie, said 
this member to me. So I'm going to sit down and read his testimony. 
He said I'm going to sit tonight build a fire, read the testimony. 
I do think there is a seriousness of purpose that is setting in here. 
The effect of that has been to weaken the arguments for censure because 
as republicans read their constitutions, learn more about the whole 
question of what each body of Congress is supposed to be doing in 
this process, they're beginning to legitimately feel it is not the 
house's place to censure the president. Thank you all. We'll talk 
to you again tomorrow night.
