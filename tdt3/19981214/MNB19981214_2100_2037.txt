Another bad day for the Dow on Wall Street. The industrials now deeply 
in sub9,000 territory after falling more than 126 points today. NASDAQ 
gave up much of the gains from last weekending down 62 points. The 
choppyness on Wall Street is likely to increase when the house does 
vote on whether or not to improve those articles of impeachment. We 
get oufer report from CNBC Allan Chernoff. The president's growing 
problems are adding to a cloud of uncertainty hanging over Wall Street. 
An issue that had been ignored only a month ago is now near the top 
of wall reet's reasons to worry. The possibility of impeachmenis extremely 
serious for the financial markets because it affects the U.S. dollar. 
As we saw this past summer, whatever effects the U.S. dollar can definitely 
effect the stock market. The dollar was stable month, President Clinton's 
troubles pressured the dollar this year. A falling dollar makes U.S. 
stocks less attractive. Because a Senate vote to impeach the president 
still appears to be a long shot, some say the issue is merely being 
used as an excuse for a sell-off. I think it's a very limited downside 
risk. It will be primarily a psychological risk. The main architect 
has been Allen Greenspan. We're likely to see the market showing they're 
not happy with this it should not have too great an impact. The house 
move towards impeachment comes on top of recent earnings warning from 
companies like Coca columna, Merck and J.P. Morgan, and the growing 
sense that stocks are overbought. The consensus view is that a house 
vote to impeach would add further pressure to the stock market, perhaps 
pushing the Dow down a few hundreds points. It could create a buying 
opportunity for savvy investors to step in and profit from the president's 
troubles. Allan Chernoff, NBC news, New York.
