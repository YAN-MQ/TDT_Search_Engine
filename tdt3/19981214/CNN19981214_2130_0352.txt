There was also some good news for President Clinton. Conservative 
democrat virgil Goode from Virginia now says he is undecided about 
how he will vote. Goode was regarded as one of three firm democratic 
votes in favor of impeachment. Also, Tennessee democrat John Tanner 
has announced he will vote against impeachment. Tanner was one of 
the undecided democrats who voted in favor for the impeachment inquiry. 
Meantime, the only democrat to call for Mr. Clinton to resign, Paul 
McHale of Pennsylvania, says he's reserving judgment. I called for 
the president's resignation last August. I felt then and feel now 
that that would be the honorable course of action. I'm not really 
undecided. I'm reserving my judgment in terms of how I will vote on 
Thursday. Were I to announce today how I am going to vote, that would 
foreclose any contact on the part of my constituents, who at this 
stage in the process do want to affect my judgment. I want to remain 
open to those kinds of contacts.
