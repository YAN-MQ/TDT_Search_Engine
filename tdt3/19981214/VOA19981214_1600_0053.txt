Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu has welcomed action by the 
Palestinian National Council to reaffirm the changes in its charter 
calling for the destruction of Israel, a move witnessed by President 
Clinton in Gaza City. Correspondent Debra Tate reports from Jerusalem. 
Mr. Netanyahu had long sought a vote by the Palestinian National Council 
on panned at Monday's meeting reaffirming the nullification of the 
offending language satisfied the demand. This is an important step, 
but it's the first step. There are many things that have to take place 
as well. This has to be backed up by action in the field, because 
words must have meaning backed by actions. Mr. Netanyahu called on 
Palestinians to do more to curb violence, to abandon pledges to unilaterally 
declare a Palestinian state in May, and to change their school curriculum 
to teach young Palestinians to accept Israel. Debra Tate, VOA News, 
Jerusalem.
