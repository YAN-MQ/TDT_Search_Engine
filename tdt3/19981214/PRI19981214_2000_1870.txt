With attention still firmly fixed on impeachment back home, Vice President 
Al Gore is voicing strong support for Mr. Clinton. Mr. Gore said that 
no matter what he did wrong, Mr. Clinton does not deserve to be pushed 
from office. There ought to be a censure, not impeachment. It's not 
the right thing to do. It is not in keeping with the wishes of the 
American people. It is not following the wisdom of the American people. 
Vice President Al Gore.
