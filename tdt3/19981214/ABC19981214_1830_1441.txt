We'll be back in a moment. What a difference one day can make. I'm 
so clogged up. I just can't focus. You okay? Get tavi St-D. Just one 
works 12 hours versus four Tylenol cold pills. Tavist-D clears your 
congestion. Be clear-headed, clear through your day with tavist-D. 
It hurts so bad. That burning sensation. So I saw my doctor. He said 
where heartburn hurts most is where Mylanta works fast. All down through 
here where you want help fast.
