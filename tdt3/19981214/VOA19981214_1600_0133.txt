Angola's UNITA rebels have shot down a plane witnesses say was carrying 
wounded soldiers and women and children fleeing fighting in the central 
town of Quito. There are no reports of survivors. The plane crash 
came amid fierce fighting between government forces and UNITA troops 
igniting fears of a renewed civil war. Richard Cornwell, an analyst 
at the Independent Institute for Security Studies in South Africa 
said the violence results in part of UNITA's failure to live up to 
its commitment under the Lusaka peace accords to fully disarm. It 
handed over a certain amount of obsolete weaponry and weaponry that 
it needed replaced. It handed over about a truckload of ammunition. 
And as I've said before, UNITA pretended to disarm, and the United 
Nations pretended to believe them. And so they were still left with 
a huge arsenal and perhaps 30- to 35,000 under arms.
