Meanwhile, President Clinton is pressing Congress for a compromise 
over the Monica Lewinsky scandal, but Republicans show no signs of 
backing down before this week's impeachment vote. In Washington, Vice 
President Al Gore called on Congress to censure Mr. Clinton as an 
alternative. Key Republicans have asked the president to resign, saying 
censure is not constitutional. However, Mr. Clinton says he will not 
step down.
