The consequences of impeachment are weighing heavily on the mind of 
one republican congressman from New Mexico. Jim hill tells us why. 
The name of this town in southern New Mexico sums of the decision 
that must be made. Truth or consequences is part of the republican's 
district. Scheme has not said how he'll vote. He does need to be impeached. 
He should vote against impeachment. The town of 7500 took its name 
from the 1950s from the television show. Staffers in his district 
say phone calls are running in favor of impeachment. However, an informal 
survey shows many folks in truth or consequences think that consequence 
is too harsh. It's wild and individual down here. We respect character 
flaws. There is another irony here. For people in truth or consequences 
consider themselves experts at being in hot water. The town is also 
known for its Mineral hot springs. Legend says Apache Warriors put 
aside weapons to join others in a soothing mineral bath. It's the 
combination of the minerals and the heat. Apparently it's a forgiving 
mixture. I wouldn't like to see anybody vote for impeachment. Scheme's 
office says the congressman will vote for a consequence of impeaching 
President Clinton if he finds truth to the allegations. Jim hill, 
CNN, truth or consequences, New Mexico.
