For The World, this is Pamela McCall in the BBC Newsroom in London. 
The Palestinian's most senior ruling body has once again renounced 
clauses calling for the destruction of Israel. The Palestine National 
Council took the vote in front of Bill Clinton on the first visit 
by an American president to Palestinian territory. He said the Palestinians 
are now free to determine their own destiny. I thank you for your 
rejection fully, finally and forever of the passages in the Palestinian 
charter calling for the destruction of Israel. You have sent a powerful 
message, not to the government, but to the people of Israel. Talks 
between Mr. Clinton and the Israeli and Palestinian leaders have been 
scheduled for tomorrow.
