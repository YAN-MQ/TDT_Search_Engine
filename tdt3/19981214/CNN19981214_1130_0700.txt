Apple-shaped women, those who carry more fat around their waist and 
hips, appear to have an incareensed risk of heart disease. It's not 
only how much total fat that you have, but also how it is distributed 
that affects risk. Researchers found women with the highest risk are 
three times more likely to develop heart disease. If you do the math, 
doctors say the ratio should fall below 0 101/80. Women are waistlines 
of 38 inches or more are more than three times the risk of heart disease. 
Experts have a theory as to why. Fat within the abdominal cavity appears 
to be associated with worse cholesterol profiles. Other studies have 
shown men apple-shaped also have an increased risk of heart disease. 
Doctors recommend both men and women watch their waistlines. David
