In other business news today, American utilities are becoming prime 
acquisition targets for foreign companies. The World's Liz George 
has the story from our business desk in New York. National Grid, the 
U.K.'s main electricity transmission company, announced today its 
plans to buy Massachusetts-based New England Electric Systems in a 
deal with around $4.6 billion. It's the second British electricity 
company within a week to break into the U.S. market, coming hot on 
the heels of a bid by Scottish Power for Oregon-based Pacifico. And 
Robert Ruben, electricity specialist with Basterns, says he doesn't 
think this will be the last cross-Atlantic deal. The Belgian Energy 
Company, they've talked about it. Why not? If the U.K. can do it, 
and if the U.K. can do it and get through the arduous regulatory process 
which we believe it's sort of a British invasion, if you will. They're 
buying our wires, and that's directly consumer, and it's a regulated, 
industry- related thing. So I think that if it gets past the regulatory 
process, I don't see why other energy companies wouldn't get involved. 
I mean, the rest of the world has allowed U.S. companies to go there 
and build infrastructure. Why, won't we grant the same reciprocation, 
and, why wouldn't we consider it likely for global around the world? 
National Grid is unable to expand any further in the U.K. market. 
And it's been looking outside its borders in order to grow further. 
New England Electric delivers power to 1.3 million customers, mostly 
in Massachusetts, but Robert Ruben says it's unlikely they'll see 
any great differences with the change of ownership. You know, it's 
really just a question of who owns whom. This is more sort of a, from 
a U.K. standpoint, let's get involved in the U.S., let's grow our 
market share, grow our shareholder base. But from a customer standpoint, 
they should see really no change in the -- you know, in the basic 
services they've been receiving for the last, you know, 100 years 
in the -- in the electric business. Today's deal is subject to several 
regulatory approvals in the U.S. and is expected to be completed early 
in the year 2000. Analysts believe there'll be more international 
partnerships in the near future. For The World, I'm Liz George in 
New York.
