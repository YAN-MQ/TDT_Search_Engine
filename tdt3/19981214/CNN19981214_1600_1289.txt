Atlanta falcons head coach Dan Reeves underwent multiple bypass surgery 
today. The NFL's winningest active coach began feeling ill during 
Atlanta's win over New Orleans on Sunday. Defensive coordinator rich 
Brooks will take over until Reeves returns. I would not be surprised 
that, to see Dan participate in some of the game planning for the 
dolphins. Whether or not he will be on the field, that remains conjectural. 
But I see no reason at this particular point, why he couldn't be back 
for the playoffs.
