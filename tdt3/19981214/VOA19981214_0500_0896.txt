Astronauts aboard the U.S. Space Shuttle Endeavour have launched an 
Argentine satellite that is designed to track endangered oil populations. 
The deployment of the joint U.S.-Argentine venture Sunday capped a 
workday that was highlighted by the separation of Endeavour from the 
fledgling International Space Station. On board cameras showed the 
winged space station glistening in the sunlight as Endeavour circled 
the seven-story unit making a final inspection. Endeavour is to return 
to Earth Tuesday, leaving behind the first two pieces of the space 
station that when completed will be four times the size of the Russian 
space station, Mir.
