Our geography puzzler today begins with a legend. The residents of 
our mystery spot believe that the Earth was an island floating in 
water that the sun happened to bathe in every evening. Smack in the 
middle of this island stood a grand tree whose roots extended deep 
into the underworld and its branches soared high enough to reach the 
sky gods. Like the tree, this country's modern location also lies 
in the center, the center of Europe, that is. We say modern location 
because this place used to be part of Czechoslovakia. It is now bordered 
by the Czech Republic to the west, Poland to the north, Ukraine to 
the east and Hungary to the south. One final clue: this country's 
alpine range, the High Tatra, has some of the highest peaks in all 
of Europe. Know where we are? Gather your clues and we'll return with 
the answer in just a few minutes.
