Astronauts aboard the shuttle "endeavour" are wrapping up some last 
minute space work. They deployed a whale-watching satellite last night, 
hours after detaching the international space station from "endeavour." 
Astronauts have spent the past week beginning construction on the 
$60 billion project. "Endeavour" is expected to land tomorrow night 
at the Kennedy space center in Florida.
