In other U.S. news, R.J. Nabisco Holdings, the country's second largest 
tobacco processor, says it will fire about 4200 employees to pay for 
lawsuits against the company. The New York-based maker of Winston 
and Camel cigarettes says 1300 people will be fired here in the United 
States and more than 2900 will lose their jobs overseas. Cigarette 
companies here in the U.S. are being forced to raise prices by as 
much as 50 cents a pack to pay for a $206 billion settlement of health 
care lawsuits. Analysts say the number of packs of cigarettes sold 
here in the U.S. could decline by as much as ten percent as a result 
of higher prices.
