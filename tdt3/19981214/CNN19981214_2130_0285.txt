President Clinton may have to do without some of the handful of republicans 
thought to be against his impeachment. Representative Charles Bass 
of New Hampshire now says he will vote in favor of article one, which 
alleges the president committed perjury in his grand jury deposition. 
Bass previously said he would not make a decision until the house 
Judiciary committee made its recommendations. And Connecticut republican 
Chris Shays, who, last week, said he would vote against impeachment, 
now says he has doubts. He has requested a face-to-face meeting with 
the president before the vote. I'd be careful to read too much into 
that and tides turning. Congressman Shays has said he'd like to meet 
with the president to talk about this. The chief of staff John Podesta 
has already talked to him today. They have arranged for a meeting 
as early as Wednesday. It's important to listen to the concerns of 
congressman Shays and others as they come up and to work through them. 
But I remind you that he also said he still plans to vote against 
impeachment.
