A United Nations report says there's been a dramatic rise in the number 
of women and children being forced into prostitution in Asia. It singles 
out India as a major hub for trafficking. One of the authors of the 
report, Jani Joshi, says the scale of the problem is vast. JANI JOSHI, 
AUTHOR OF U.N. REPORT. It's a kind of a racket. Everyone has vested 
interest; you know, they get commission. The women are smuggled out 
without their consent, and they don't even know what their poor fate 
is going to be. They were never told they are going into trafficking; 
you know, they're going to be prostitutes. Jani Joshi, author of a 
U.N. report into prostitution in Asia. According to the report, more 
than 2 million women in India alone are selling sex. One in four is 
below the age of 18. The U.N. report says the increasing tourism and 
sex industries are making matters worse. And the report recommends 
politicians change their approach to the problem. From the BBC Newsroom 
in London, this is Pamela McCall. You're listening to The World.
