The state department believes terrorist attacks are being planned 
on U.S. facilities in and around the Persian gulf region. U.S. embassies 
there have been warned about possible attacks over christmas, or the 
Muslim fasting month of Ramadan. Diplomatic sources in the region 
say soft U.S. targets, similar to the embassies in Kenya and Tanzania, 
are also possible targets. They say last time they thought the threat 
was in the gulf, the attacks came in east Africa.
