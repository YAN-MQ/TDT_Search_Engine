Despite republican calls for his resignation, President Clinton is 
forging ahead on a mission of peace in the Middle East. The president 
is urging Palestinian leader Yasser Arafat to reconcile with israel 
and follow the terms agreed to in the wye river accord. The president 
was welcomed at Gaza international airport this morning. He and Arafat 
cut a ribbon to open the airport before heading to Gaza city for talks. 
One Palestinian leader says this meeting is much more than a symbolic 
gesture. The Palestinians look upon this meeting as an occasion to 
listen to President Clinton and to President Arafat. And they are 
listening very carefully to what he has to say beyond the symbolic 
gestures of being here. And of course the signals that he is starting 
a new phase of the dealing with the Palestinians. They want to hear 
words pertaining to the peace process. The American position. The 
American political will to stand up to Netanyahu and to put an end 
to this constant manipulation.
