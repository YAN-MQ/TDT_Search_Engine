I'm John Birchard, VOA News. With a standing show of hands, Palestinian 
leaders have reaffirmed the nullification of language in the PLO charter 
that calls for Israel's destruction. Israel's Prime Minister Benjamin 
Netanyahu says he is satisfied with the Palestinian action. This is 
an important step, but it's the first step. There are many things 
that have to take place as well. This has to be backed up by action 
in the field, because words must have meaning backed by actions. Members 
of the Palestinian National Council and other organizations took the 
action in Gaza City in the presence of President Clinton. He was the 
first U.S. president to visit Palestinian-ruled territory. The president's 
visit and the Palestinian action came in support of the Wye River 
peace agreement signed with Israel in October.
