Well, how would you like to ring in the new century with the Judds? 
Tickets for the Judds concert go on sale next month for a concert 
on December 31st, 1999 at the America West Arena in Phoenix, Arizona. 
They're going to be priced at $99, $199, and $299. Now you may remember 
that the mother/daughter act had a farewell tour back in 1991. Wynona 
went on to a successful solo career after her mother, Naomi, left 
the business to content with the hepatitis C virus. Well, Naomi now 
says she's recovered and she's ready to sing. But as for now, this 
is just a one shot deal, though the Judds have not ruled out a longer 
tour afterwards.
