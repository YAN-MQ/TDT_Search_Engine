Oil giant Royal Dutch Shell has announced major cutbacks following 
the slump in world oil prices. Shell is selling off nearly half its 
chemical business over the next year in order to save $2.5 billion. 
In recent weeks, Shell has announced 4,000 job cuts, and the company 
chairman is warning further job losses are almost certain. Shares 
in the Anglo-Dutch company closed down in London in the back of the 
announcement. The time at 4 minutes past the hour. This is Pamela 
McCall in the BBC Newsroom in London.
