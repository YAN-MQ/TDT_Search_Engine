Over the weekend, incoming house speaker Bob Livingston said he does 
not favor adding a censure motion to the impeachment vote. Chairman 
Henry Hyde and other members of the Judiciary committee also decided 
against the proposal. Vice President Al Gore today says the republican 
leadership is "rejecting the wisdom of the American people" by keeping 
the motion from the house. I believe it's very unfortunate that the 
leadership of the House of Representatives has made a decision to 
reject compromise and force a vote only on impeachment and not give 
the members of Congress a chance to vote their conscience.
