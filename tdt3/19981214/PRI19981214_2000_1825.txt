For The World, this is Pamela McCall in the BBC Newsroom in London. 
The Palestinian's most senior ruling body has once again renounced 
clauses in its charter calling for Israel's destruction. The Palestine 
National Council took the vote in front of Bill Clinton on the first 
visit by an American president to Palestinian territory. Mr. Clinton 
said it's time to join hands and go forward together for peace. Israeli 
prime minister Benjamin Netanyahu also welcomes the move. This is 
an important step because we insisted that they recognize the fact 
that we have a right to live here, that this country has a place under 
the sun by right. But it's a first step. There are many things that 
have to take place as well. This has to be backed by action. A summit 
between the three leaders will take place tomorrow.
