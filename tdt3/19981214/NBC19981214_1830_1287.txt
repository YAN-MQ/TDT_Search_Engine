News from the brave new world of Gene therapy. Scientists have come 
up with a new way to inject new genes into aging muscles. The result 
-- strong new muscle tissue just like the kind you have when you're 
young. The bad news is, the experiment's only been tried on mice. 
It may be years before this experiment can be tried on humans.
