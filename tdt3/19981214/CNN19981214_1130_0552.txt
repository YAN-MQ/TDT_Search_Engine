Police officers in Baltimore are trying to stem the tide of homicides 
by hitting the street in massive numbers. The city has topped the 
300 homicide Mark for eight straight years, and city officials don't 
want it to happen again. So far this year, there have been 294 homicides 
in Baltimore, despite drops in robbery and assaults. Baltimore averages 
43 killings per 100,000 residents, the fourth-highest rate in the 
nation. By comparison, New York City averages eight killings for every 
100,000 residents.
