Just ahead, sometimes a banana is more than a banana, on PRI, Public 
Radio International. The World is sponsored by the Capitol Group Companies, 
investing throughout the world for individuals and institutions. And 
The World is sponsored by Merck, dedicated to the needs of society 
through pharmaceutical research and consumer education to improve 
the quality of life. Merck: committed to bringing out the best in 
medicine. You're listening to 91 F.M. WHYY. There's more of The World 
coming up, but first, here's the Franklin Institute forecast. Tonight, 
clear and seasonably cold, low around 29, and low in the mid 20s in 
the suburbs. Tuesday, sunny and a bit milder, high 53. And on Wednesday, 
partly to mostly sunny, high 52. That's the forecast. You're listening 
to 91 F.M. Support for NPR comes from the W. Alton Jones Foundation 
for our coverage of our efforts to reduce threats of nuclear war and 
proliferation; www.wajones.org.
