U.S. envoy Richard Holbrooke is going to Belgrade to try to salvage 
the Kosovo peace deal he brokered last October with Yugoslav President 
Slobodan Milosevic. The United States is trying to prevent an all-out 
resumption of fighting between Serbian forces and ethnic Albanian 
separatists. In the worst incident since the deal was signed, Serbian 
state media says 30 ethnic Albanians were killed in a clash with border 
guards early Monday.
