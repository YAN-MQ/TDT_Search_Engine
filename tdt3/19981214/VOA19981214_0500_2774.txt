The U.S. National Institutes of Health's National Center for complementary 
and alternative medicine is sponsoring or has plans to support several 
long, anticipated studies of alternative health treatments. Ongoing 
trials include a $1 million test of bovine or shark cartilage as cancer 
treatments and a $3 million study of St. John's Wort. And there plans 
to start a three-year study of the effectiveness of glucosamine and 
condroitin sulfates in treating osteoarthritis of the knee. If the 
NIH trials show that alternative health treatments are effective, 
they will be more likely to win the confidence of mainstream doctors 
in the United States.
