President Clinton says he's looking for a compromise way out of the 
impeachment mess in Washington, but his insistence he did not commit 
perjury isn't helping achieve that a goal. Yesterday in Jerusalem, 
Mr. Clinton refused to say whether he had lied under oath. And today, 
he suggested it's not in the country's best interest to continue the 
impeachment process. However, at the end of this week, the house is 
scheduled to vote on four articles of impeachment passed by the Judiciary 
committee, and it appears there is little chance an option to censure 
the president will make it to the house floor. Still, the president's 
counsel hasn't given up. I'm not sure it's failed. I think the question 
before the American public and before the leadership of the Congress 
now is whether it's better for the country to have a Bipartisan support 
for a resolution of support, or whether it's better to send the matter 
to the Senate for a partisan trial that will divide the country and 
gridlock the government and defy the American will. Without a censure 
resolution, the president's fate is even more squarely in the hands 
of some 20-30 undecided members of Congress. Many of them republicans, 
such as Ohio's Bob Ney. I would say the majority of people, if you 
would listen to the tally on it, would probably support some kind 
of impeachment and or censure. And that is what's coming down from 
the calls I think. But they make a lot of good points and it still 
makes it pretty confusing.
