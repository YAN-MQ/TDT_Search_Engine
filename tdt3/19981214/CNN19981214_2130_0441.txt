In what's believed to be a first, an Ohio man is being punished for 
failing to switch off an air bag in his truck. Dwight childs' son 
was killed in a crash last may. Childs ignored warnings posted inside 
his truck to turn off the air bag if a child were the passenger. He 
pleaded no contest to charges of vehicular homicide, and has been 
sentenced to two, 12-hour days in jail next year -- on the boy's birthday 
and on the anniversary of his death.
