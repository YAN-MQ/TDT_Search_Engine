When we come back, a look at items making news inside the big three 
weekly news magazines now hitting newsstands. There was a time when 
memories were painful. They just reminded me of how far away I was 
from feeling like myself. I couldn't get out of bed. I was always 
tired. I hardly ate. I stopped wanting to be around people. Sometimes, 
I felt like, "what's the use?" My friends, they'd say, "cheer up. 
You have everything." But I was so depressed, I couldn't snap out 
of it. You can't just snap out of clinical depression. No one can 
because it's a real illness with real causes. But you can get your 
life back. a first step is giving us a call. We'll send you a free, 
confidential information kit... with facts about depression and treatment 
that's worked for millions... D a symptoms checklist that can make 
it easier... to talk with a doctor about how you're feeling. Now, 
I already have my wish. I have my life back. Monday night, time for 
our first of the week look at the big news weeks liss being mailed 
across the country. We begin with the covers on "U.S. news," the house 
braces for a vote on impeachment, or a deal on censure. "Time" magazine 
asks the question, will they really do it? "Newsweek" talks about, 
speaking of the first cubble, -- couple, the fight of their lives. 
Inside "U.S. news," it's called shush. Inside "Newsweek." Inside "time." 
When we come back, a look at tomorrow morning's newspaper headlines 
tonight. Two hundred miles of bad road. Six hundred bottles of nitro. 
One Mercury mountaineer. That's nitro. highly explosive. Payment on 
delivery. Any questions? Yeah. who's he? Hey, hey, highly explosive. 
Hey, bones! Yeah! That would be your driver. Mountaineer. No problem.
