President Clinton told the Palestinian people that they are free to 
determine their own destiny. He then witnessed a vote by the Palestine 
national council, annulling parts of the Palestinian charter that 
call for the destruction of Israel. Mr. Clinton said he was proud 
to take part in the day's events. Americans, this is a remarkable 
day. Today, the eyes of the world are on you. I am profoundly honored 
to be the first American president to address the palestinian people 
in a city government by Palestinians. Today's action by the Palestine 
national council has been a key demand of the Israelis for advancing 
the peace process.
