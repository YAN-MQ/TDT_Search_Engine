Just a few weeks ago, a Arethra Franklin was flying high after singing 
before fans in her hometown of Detroit, Michigan. Now the queen of 
soul is singing the legal blues. Arethra Franklin is facing two new 
lawsuits, the first coming from Chicago's songwriter William Sanders 
who's seeking a half million dollars in unpaid royalties after co-writing 
her top 20 hit, "Angel," with Franklin's sister, Carolyn. She's also 
being sued for more than $3500 in unpaid limousine bills.
