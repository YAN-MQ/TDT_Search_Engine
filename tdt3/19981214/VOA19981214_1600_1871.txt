President Clinton is pressing Congress for a compromise over the Monica 
Lewinsky scandal, but Republicans show no sign of backing down before 
this week's impeachment vote. Vice President Al Gore says most Americans 
would prefer that Mr. Clinton be censured and not impeached for his 
behavior. As VOA national correspondent Jim Malone reports, the vice 
president is urging Republican congressional leaders to permit a House 
vote on censure on Thursday. Speaking to reporters at the White House, 
Vice President Gore said most Americans believe Mr. Clinton's conduct 
was wrong. Mr. Gore also cited public opinion polls which indicate 
the majority of the American public prefers the lesser punishment 
of censure to impeachment. He should not be impeached and removed 
from office as a result of that. And what they favor instead is censure 
to give the president the punishment and the rebuke and the censure 
that they feel is appropriate in this. The House is scheduled to debate 
and vote on four articles of impeachment Thursday, but Republicans 
leaders say they won't permit a vote on censure. A House vote to impeach 
would lead to a trial in the Senate where the president could be removed 
from office. Asked if the president should resign, Vice President 
Gore said, "That will not happen." Jim Malone, VOA News, Washington.
