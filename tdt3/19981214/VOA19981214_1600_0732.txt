German chancellor, Gerhard Schroeder, says full-scale talks with Germany's 
energy industry on shutting down the country's 19 nuclear power plants 
will begin next month. The chancellor made the announcement after 
holding preliminary talks with four leading nuclear energy operators. 
The social Democrats and the environmental Greens took power in October 
calling for an end to nuclear-powered Germany. The move is a major 
policy reversal for the country. Shutting down the nuclear power stations 
is likely to be lengthy and costly, and power station operators want 
compensation for closing their profitable plants.
