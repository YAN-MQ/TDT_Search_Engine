In California, here's a story that began more than 20 years ago and 
now it has had an unexpected ending. You see, back in October 1976, 
there was a man named Mel Potser. In fact, he's still around. But 
then, he parked his pickup truck at McLellan Air Force Base out in 
Sacramento. He went to his job at the base. He repairs parts for fighter 
planes, but that's insignificant. When his work shift ended, Mr. Potser 
returned to the spot where he parked his red 1967 Ford pickup truck. 
Oh, oh, it was gone. Yeah, all that remained was some broken glass 
where someone broke the window to get inside, and of course, they 
stole the truck. Two decades went by. That's 20 years. Then a few 
weeks ago, the California Highway Patrol called Mr. Potser and they 
found his car, driven up. Highway patrol officers north of Sacramento 
had been helping a disabled vehicle who turned out to be stolen. Further 
investigation, they found two other stolen vehicles, and that's right, 
Mr. Potser's truck. Several people have been charged with grand theft. 
Last week, Mel Potser got his 1967 truck back, and I believe he said 
something about the tags to go with it. Yeah, the vintage automobile 
tags, 20 years old. He hadn't had it. Why not?
