It is 10 hours 48 universal time. This is VOA News Now. I'm Paul Westpheling. 
He's Les Carpenter. Here's the hour's top news story. President Clinton 
and Palestinian leader, Yasir Arafat, have together cut the ceremonial 
ribbon officially inaugurating the Gaza City Airport. We'll have an 
update on that story at the top of the hour. Stay tuned. It is time 
now to take a look at the latest business news, and for that, we turn 
to Victor Beady.
