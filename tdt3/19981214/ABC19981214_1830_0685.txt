In a moment, host cities and the Olympic games, how many others bought 
their way in? Ho, ho, ho! Whoa... whoa... whoa! Know someone who could 
use a nice home improvement gift? Come to the home Depot. You'll find 
everything from convenient gift cards... to these 13 and 19 piece 
rapid load accessory sets from DeWalt. They make great stocking stuffers. 
It's all at the home Depot. The toy store for big kids. It's my wife. 
I left her sitting right here. How long has she been gone? You don't 
think? Uh-huh. What? Checked out red hot Harry's? No way. Lucinda 
gets really bad heartburn. Not anymore she doesn't. What's that? Looks 
like the remains... of an individually wrapped pepcid ac chewable. 
Introducing pepcid ac chewables. The first chewable to stop heartburn 
before it starts. Lucinda? Is that you? Start living heartburn free 
with new pepcid ac chewables. Hi, pumpkin. It's late. You should be 
asleep. Mommy said that I could stay up until you got home. - oh. 
- What are you eating? - Cheerios. - For dinner? They taste just as 
good at night. And remember, I told you they were good for my cholesterol. 
Oh, yeah. An important new study shows... that three cups of cheerios 
whole grain oats a day, added to a low fat diet, can help push your 
cholesterol down. - uh-uh. - a hug from you. The one and only cheerios.
