The president's trip to Palestine replaced most of the impeachment 
stories on the front pages beginning with the chibs. A mini summit 
they're calling it. They're trying to really put a period at the end 
of the sentence that was the wye river agreement. First trip by a 
sitting American president to Palestinian-held land, Gaza strip where 
the motorcade was rushed by crowds. Neck ties the hook. A Dutch prince 
touched off a revolution in the internetter Lan -- internetterland. 
Yanked off his tie a tossed it at the queen of his wife and called 
ate snake around my neck. he is 73. One television anchorman, took 
off his tie, then a sportscaster did on the air. It's being given 
a name. The phenomenon is called and celebrates the prince for denouncing 
ties. New open necktie style. The "Atlanta journal constitution" Dan 
Reeves was taken to the hospital. Probably will miss the rest of the 
season. Should recover in time for the play-offs. He's taken the Atlanta 
falcons to the brink of the best record in franchise history. Here 
is Jane pauley with a program note. Thanks. Coming unext on "time 
and again," the week it all began. The Clinton-Lewinsky story, seven 
days in January that shook the Clinton presidency. From the first 
reports of the The fst lady's steadfast support and a crucial speech 
to an audience of millions. How Clinton survived week one coming up 
next on "time and again." That is "time and again" with Jane Pauley 
next here on MSNBC. That is our broadcast for this Monday night. We 
hope to see you back here at this same time tomorrow night from washington.
