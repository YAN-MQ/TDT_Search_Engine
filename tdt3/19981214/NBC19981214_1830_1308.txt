Now to a more immediate example of "living better." One of the most 
effective advances in the battle against cancer -- the pap test. It's 
reduced cervical cancer deaths by 70% since its introduction. Now 
there's a new kind of pap test available. It is more expensive what's 
the truth? Here's NBC's Anne Thompson. For almost 20 years, Peggy 
Smith, a trained technician, worked in a lab reading pap smears for 
thousands for women. Last summer, reading her own test, she found 
cancer. It was real numbing almost, like, "this can't be mine. It 
can't be me." a shock because for three years, Peggy got inconclusive 
results from conventional pap tests. Finally, she asked her doctor 
to try a new test called thin prep. Last June, that test found what 
five traditional pap smears and two biopsies could not. These cells 
are normally a lot smaller. It was cancer. I definitely needed to 
have a hysterectomy. I would not be having any more children. The 
doctors removed Peggy's cancer before it spread. But why could the 
new test find what the old test missed? One reason -- in conventional 
pap smears, cancer can be obscured by blood and mucus. The new test 
shows only the key cells. They're more representative of what's harvested, 
and they're much easier to see. But they're also more expensive, $20 
more, twice the cost of the traditional pap smear. When you consider 
there are 60 million pap smears each year, it raises one of the tough 
questions in health care today -- is the extra money worth it? Of 
the 14,000 women diagnosed with cervical cancer annually, half never 
had a pap smear. If we put the same amount of money in screening more 
women than we do in these newer technologies, then we would probably 
save more lives screening than we would through any one of the new 
technologies. But the test isn't perfect. One quarter of the women 
with cervical cancer have had errors in their results. Those are the 
cases that we are attempting to prevent with a better technology. 
That's promise, but in practice, the test is too new. I'd have to 
say there is not yet evidence that thin prep can save more lives. 
Peggy Smith says she's proof it can save lives when results from the 
traditional pap test are not clear. Anne Thompson, NBC news, Nashville.
