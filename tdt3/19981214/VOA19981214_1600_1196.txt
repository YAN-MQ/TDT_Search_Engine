Olympic officials have announced they have no plans to ban the controversial 
performance-enhancing substance, Creotine. International Olympic Committee 
medical chief Prince Alexander DeMaraude said the organization will 
not put the substance on the list of banned drugs because it is considered 
to be food. In his words, "We don't tell people they can't eat bread 
or eggs. There's no reason to ban it. It's not comparable to substances 
like steroids." Recent investigations have shown that Creotine, which 
is an amino acid naturally produced in the liver and kidneys, is used 
regularly in many sports. Although supporters say it is a harmless 
training aid, there have been increasing reports of kidney and liver 
damage.
