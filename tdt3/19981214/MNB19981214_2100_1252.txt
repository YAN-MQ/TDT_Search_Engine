We're back with democratic congressman Gene Taylor of mippings, and 
republican congressman Peter king of new RK. Coressman king, let's 
talk about censure briefly. Is there any hopas we speak this evening, 
that it will be an option of the full house? The only chance censure 
will come up is if republican leadership proves it. They feel votes 
are going their way on impeachment. They feel no obligation to bring 
censure up. Sent a popular surge toward the president over the next 
few days, I quite frankly don't see censure having any real chance 
of coming up. I wish it would. I do believe the majority of the house 
would support it. The reality is it doesn't look if it's going to 
happen. Congressman Taylor, if you took a poll tonight, how do you 
think the numbers up or down would shake out for or against impeachment? 
I would say at least 60% for and possibly stronger. And what about 
the fact that you are a democrat, you've got a democrat pop popularly 
elected two-term in office. You are going against the grain in your 
party? I'm first and foremost an American. I enlisted in the coast 
guard a long time ago and swore an eeth of allegians to my country. 
I swore to uphold the constitution of the United States. I have criticized 
both parties when I felt they were getting out of hand and being partisan 
and not looking out for the best interest in the country. I think 
it's important T do what's best for our country. Congressman king, 
do you worry about your sea next time around? What happens, happens. 
This is a conscience vote. It's an American vote. This has nothing 
to doith Bill Clinton. It has everything to do with the presidency. 
I feel history will judge me badly if I vote for impeachment and allow 
the standard to be set. It's not disagreement with the people me and 
geneave. My knowledge of Gene, there are no politics in his decision 
or mine. Congressman Peter king, congressman Gene Taylor. We appreciate 
your time and thoughtshithe.
