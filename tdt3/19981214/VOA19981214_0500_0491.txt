In Puerto Rico, residents have voted to maintain the status quo in 
a plebiscite on Sunday. And so the commonwealth will remain as it 
is, and there will be no petition to the U.S. Congress for statehood. 
As Marty Delfen reports from San Juan, the pro-statehood government 
of Dr. Pedro Rosello declared victory. Statehood supporters danced 
and sang after Governor Pedro Rosello announced that his statehood 
party won the plebiscite because it was the only status formula that 
received the majority of votes. But early figures from the State Elections 
Commission show that most of the eligible 2.2 million Puerto Ricans 
voted under a "none-of-the-above" ballot column, rejecting all the 
status formulas presented to them. That none-of-the-above option was 
being supported by the opposition popular Democratic Party which had 
charged the commonwealth definition was unfair. While the governor 
said he recognized the win as a protest vote against his administration, 
he said he would let the U.S. Congress, which has power over Puerto 
Rico, interpret the results. The opposition, meanwhile, said it will 
take the fight to Congress to show lawmakers that most Puerto Ricans 
do not want statehood. With nearly half the votes counted, returns 
show that none-of-the-above option received over 50 percent, while 
statehood garnered less than 47 percent. Independents received more 
than two percent of the vote, while commonwealth and free association 
each received less than one percent. Marty Delfen reporting from San 
Juan, Puerto Rico.
