Special teams of U.N. arms inspectors are leaving Iraq after completing 
their latest surprise searches for banned weapons. Most of the 40 
visiting inspectors will be out of Iraq early Monday. Chief U.N. inspector 
Richard Butler is due to report Tuesday on Iraqi cooperation. That 
will determine whether the U.N. Security Council orders a review of 
overall Iraqi compliance with U.N. Gulf War cease-fire resolution. 
Iraq considers the review a big step toward lifting U.N. sanctions, 
but Mr. Butler says Iraq impeded his inspectors on at least three 
occasions.
