The list of companies slashing jobs grows longer. I'm Jan Hopkins 
at the CNN Financial Newsdesk in New York with this edition of "Dollars 
& Sense." RJR Nabisco plans to eliminate 3,900 jobs from its global 
tobacco division. 1,000 of those will be in the U.S. the remaining 
2,900, overseas. As the company continues to restructure its snack 
foods business, RJR says more downsizing is on the way. Partly as 
a result of the restructuring, and also because of a recent $206 billion 
national tobacco settlement with the government, RJR also plans to 
take fourth quarter charges totalling $350 million.
