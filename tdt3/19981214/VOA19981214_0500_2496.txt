People in Guinea go to the polls today in a multi-party presidential 
election that pits incumbent Lansana Conte against four opposition 
candidates. VOA's John Pitman reports from our West Africa bureau 
that security is tight after weekend pre-election violence. Saturday's 
clashes in the capital, Conakry, produced a number of casualties. 
However, it has been impossible to confirm how many people were killed 
or injured. The French news agency reports four people died in the 
violence; other reports talk of ethnically charged riots which produced 
a number of injuries. According to the Reuters news agency, the Guinean 
Army has been deployed on the streets of Conakry to guard against 
further violence on election day. Saturday marks the final day of 
a month-long campaign period. The violence in Conakry apparently occurred 
after a massive rally was held by incumbent President Lansana Conte 
for supporters of his party of Unity and Progress. During his speech 
at Conakry's main sports stadium, Mr. Conte reportedly commended his 
followers for their restraint during the campaign. However, after 
the rally ended, news reports say Mr. Conte's followers clashed with 
supporters of a leading opposition candidate, Moma Duba. Observers 
say most political rivalries in Guinea-Conakry are field by ethnic 
divisions. President Conte, for example, is a member of the Soussou, 
which is a minority in the country. Monday's presidential election 
will be Guinea-Conakry's second experience with Democratic polling. 
President Conte has held power since 1984 but has only been Guinea-Conakry's 
elected president since 1993. Opposition leaders say the 1993 poll 
was flawed by massive irregularities. The opposition has raised similar 
complaints this year accusing the government of withholding voter 
registration cards from opposition party members. Opposition candidates 
Moma Duba and Elfa Conday have called for Monday's vote to be postponed 
for at least a month to give opposition voters a chance to register 
properly. However, the government's interior ministry has rejected 
that appeal and has announced that polling stations will open as planned 
on Monday at a.m. local time. John Pitman, VOA News, West Africa bureau.
