The Olympic games seem to be losing luster with every new report about 
how host cities are chosen. Last week, you heard organizers in Salt 
Lake City, took heat for what some said were outright bribes to bring 
the winter games there in the year 2002. Other cities are now facing 
serious questions about the deals they make. With its predictable 
snow and Olympic-class venues already in place, why did Salt Lake 
City organizers feel they needed to influence the international Olympic 
committee? Today, in Lausanne, Switzerland, a senior member of the 
IOC, Marc hodler, said middlemen acting as agents encouraged the city 
to bribe the committee. The real villains are the agents who put the 
cities in awkward positions using blackmail. Salt lake organizers 
have admitted giving relatives of IOC members nearly $400,000 in scholarships. 
I apologize to the Olympic family and to the citizens of Utah for 
the embarrassment caused by the bid committee program. While the IOC 
investigates that program and at least four agents, including one 
IOC member, the scandal may be spreading. Hodler says there was a 
pattern of bribery in the selection of at least three former Olympic 
cities -- Nagano, Sydney, and Atlanta. I was definitely surprised, 
shocked. The president of the Atlanta organizing committee denies 
cheating, but says the rules permit generous benefits. The rules of 
the process allow the perks, allow and govern the class of airfare, 
the amount of gifts that can be given. Journalist Andrew Jennings, 
who has covered the IOC for the past dozen years, says there are many 
ways of securing a winning bid. If you dig into that bid budget, if 
it's like other bids around the world, there will be college scholarships, 
there will be cash payments to IOC members, there will be jobs. Not 
just scholarships, but jobs in America for relatives of IOC members. 
Tomorrow, a Utah citizens' committee will ask salt lake organizers 
to reopen negotiations with the IOC and demand that the international 
body pay half of any losses should the games lose any money. Bill
