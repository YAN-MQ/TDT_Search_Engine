Special envoy Richard Holbrook has held high-level talks in Athens 
on the situation in the divided island of Cypress. He's been discussing 
controversial plans by the Greek Cypriots to deploy Russian anti-aircraft 
missiles. Paul Wood reports from Athens in Greece. Richard Holbrook's 
visit to Athens comes amid rising tension over the deployment of the 
missiles, something which is supposed to happen by the end of the 
year. Greek Cypriot leader, President Clarides, has said in the past 
that the deployment could be postponed only with substantial progress 
and efforts to demilitarize the island. Turkey has some 30,000 troops 
on northern Cypress and has warned repeatedly that war could break 
out if the internationally-recognized Greek Cypriot states deploys 
the missiles. Paul Wood, BBC News, Athens.
