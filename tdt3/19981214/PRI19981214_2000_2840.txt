While the Czechs and Slovaks fought over market share, The World also 
learned that capitalists aren't the only fans of the drink. Turns 
out that Karl Marx, the father of Communism, was known to down a few 
in London now and then. Contemporary Communist and amateur historian 
Michael Petilow decided to cash in by leading a tour of Marx's favorite 
London pubs. Here's Petilow's reading from the writings of Wilhelm 
Lievkonyk, one of Marx's drinking buddies. Now, we had had enough 
of our beer trip for the time being, and in order to cool our heated 
blood, we started on a double march until Edgar Bower stumbled over 
a heap of paving stones. Hurrah, an idea, and in memory of mad students' 
pranks, he picked up a stone and crash, clatter, a gas lantern went 
flying into splinters. Madness is contagious. Marx and I didn't stay 
far behind and we broke four or five street lamps. So much for religion 
being the opiate of the masses.
