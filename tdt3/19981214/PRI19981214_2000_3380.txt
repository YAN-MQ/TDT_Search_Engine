For our closing music today, we turn from Carmen Miranda to Marlouie 
Miranda . Of all the Brazilian musicians, Marlouie Miranda, widely 
considered the consummate interpreter of Brazilian Indian music, probably 
gets the vote for the most likely not to wear a fruit basket as a 
hat. This is music from a 1997 concert Marlouie Miranda gave in San 
Paolo with the San Paolo Jazz Symphony Orchestra. The performance, 
not out in the United States on CD, through musicians not just from 
San Paolo musical circles, but also indigenous singers from the near 
extinct Arulla Indian tribe and the Tupari Indians, a kind of all-star 
lineup of Brazil's native musicians.
