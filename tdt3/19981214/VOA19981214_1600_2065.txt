U.S. envoy Richard Holbrooke is going to Belgrade to try to salvage 
the Kosovo peace deal he brokered last October with Yugoslav President 
Slobodan Milosevic. Officials say it is highly likely they will meet 
Tuesday. The United States is trying to prevent an all-out resumption 
of fighting between Serbian forces and ethnic Albanian separatists. 
In the worst incident since the deal was signed, Serbian state media 
say 30 ethnic Albanians were killed in a clash with border guards 
early Monday when they tried to cross into Kosovo.
