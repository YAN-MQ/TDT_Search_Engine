One of the hottest stars of the big screen is making the jump on stage. 
Nicole Kidman made a revealing debut last night on Broadway in "the 
blue room." Cynthia Tornquist reports. Hollywood beauty Nicole Kidman 
made her Broadway debut in the nude as "the blue room" opened before 
a star-studded crowd. What do you say to people who would actually 
buy a ticket just to come and see you take your clothes off? That 
you don't really get to see it all, so it ain't worth it. Heaven knows 
what a girl can do heaven knows what you've got to prove And now I'd 
like a Kiss. When I watch the play I actually get lost in the performances. 
Both her and iain. You know, obviously, I was very proud. Opening 
night brought out fans, photographers and celebrities. She certainly 
had a presence, and that's what you need to capture an audience. She's 
wonderful. Fantastic. She's also funny. I'll be replacing her when 
she leaves after 111 performances, and I'll be nude for all five scenes. 
"the blue room" gives the 31-year-old actress a chance to strut her 
stuff for the first time on Broadway. Until now, fans knew her mostly 
for her movies. The gun moll in "Billy bathgate" -- the deadly weather 
girl in "to die for" -- The sexy shrink in "batman forever," among 
others. While "the blue room" has received lukewarm reviews, some 
critics say kidman shows she's more than a pretty face. She's a real 
character actress. She's totally different in all five parts. And 
she's amazing to watch. She looks great nude, too. She's your girlfriend 
after all. Is she? It says in the papers. The drama is a modern adaptation 
of Arthur schnitzler's play "La ronde," about ten characters engaging 
in sex. Kidman and her co-star, iain Glen, portray all the roles. 
You're playing a sexual game the whole time, and that's fun. Kidman 
said she's relieved to get opening night behind her. It was exciting, 
but it was also nerve-wracking. But I'm just glad it's over, because 
now I can get back to the show and the reason we did the show, and 
all the hoopla is gone. That hoopla has helped the show pull in $4 
million, making it the hottest ticket for a play in Broadway history. 
Good luck getting a seat. It's almost completely sold out. Cynthia 
Tornquist, "CNN Entertainment News," New York.
