You'll soon be able to find your favorite "doonesbury" characters 
somewhere else than the newspapers. The comic strip's creator, Gary 
trudeau, is teaming up with the starbucks coffee chain to promote 
literacy. Greeting cards, coffee mugs and T-shirts featuring "doonesbury" 
characters go on sale at starbucks today. Trudeau says 50% to 70% 
of the profits from the merchandise will go to literacy programs. 
They hope to raise half a million dollars.
