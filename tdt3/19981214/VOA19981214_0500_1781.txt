It is ten hours 30 universal time, and this is VOA News Now. President 
Clinton is in Gaza City on an unprecedented trip to Palestinian's 
self-rule areas to revive the faltering peace process. Here in Washington, 
calls for his resignation. The Endeavour astronauts closed the door 
on the International Space Station. Turn out the lights. They're preparing 
to head home. And there's more ahead in our next half hour of VOA 
News Now. Hello, again, I'm Les Carpenter with Paul Westpheling and 
this is VOA News Now. And we're broadcasting live from Washington 
on this Monday. Thank you for joining us.
