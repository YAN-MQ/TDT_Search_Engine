First, the U.S. treasury gave 20s and 50s a face-lift. Now it's adding 
a dollar coin. Marcia Walton reports. The U.S. mint soon will be adding 
a new, $1 coin to its inventory. And it wants advice from those who 
will spend it. The last time a new dollar coin was introduced, people 
were underwhelmed, and the Susan B. Anthony dollar was never a hit. 
One of the weaknesses of the Susan B. Anthony design was that the 
American people didn't really like the design itself. They also didn't 
like its similarity to the quarter. So the new coin will be gold-colored 
with a smooth edge. The front will have one of these six images of 
Sacajawea, the shoshone indian teenager who accompanied Lewis and 
Clark on their trek across the west. And the mint is using the Internet 
to get feedback on which of the six is most appealing. The web site 
-- www.usmint.gov/dollarcoin -- is the place to post your comments. 
We've had about 60,000 E-mail messages that have come in since Monday, 
december 7th. Before they looked at the contenders, some people we 
talked to needed a little history refresher course. Do you know who 
Sacajawea was? Kind of, I can almost remember. The name is familiar. 
Not right offhand. Yes and no. She was an Indian woman who traveled 
with Lewis and Clark. Bingo! And she made the journey with her infant, 
baptiste, on her back. The mint director says designs that include 
the baby are among the most popular. There appears to be a baby on 
her baby as she's pointing at something. It looks almost spiritual. 
She's pointing off to a dream, something in the distance, something 
to lead people to. One of these seven Eagles will become the "tail" 
side of the coin. Treasury secretary Robert Rubin will make the final 
selection in January. Marsha Walton, CNN, Atlanta.
