Exactly one week after its first two components were joined above 
Earth, the International Space Station has undocked from the Space 
Shuttle Endeavour and was released into its own orbit. VOA's science 
correspondent Jessica Berman reports. The International Space Station 
separation from Endeavour came exactly one week after astronauts joined 
two modules to form the fledgling space station. The Endeavour photographed 
the space station as it drifted away from the mother ship to find 
its own orbit. The camera showed a spectacular wing structure seven 
stories tall gracefully floating kilometers above a glistening Pacific 
Ocean. The release of the International Space Station caps a 12-day 
mission that included three space walks by Endeavour astronauts to 
hook up the Russian Czaria module and the American Unity module. The 
U.S. Space Agency estimates 159 space walks will be needed to construct 
the space station by 2004. The Endeavour crew has begun stowing gear 
in preparation for the return home Tuesday. Jessica Berman, VOA News, 
Washington.
