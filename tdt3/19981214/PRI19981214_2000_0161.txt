Serbia says its forceshave killed at least 30 ethnic Albanians in 
a clash in Kosovo. It's the worst violence since American envoy Richard 
Holbrook brokered a cease-fire in the province 2 months ago. From 
Belgrade, Jackie Roland reports. The Serbian Information Center, which 
is close to the government, said about 100 armed Albanians tried to 
cross the border into Kosovo in the early hours of Monday. Clashes 
broke out between the Yugoslav border guards and the infiltrators, 
leaving at least 30 Albanians dead. The information center said there 
were no casualties on the Yugoslav side. The outbreak of violence 
comes as Mr. Holbrook is heading back to Serbia to try to breathe 
new life into the peace process. Jackie Roland, BBC News, Belgrade.
