Bostonians relived a chapter from their illustrious past this weekend 
with a few modifications. Dozens of people dressed up in colonial 
garb yesterday to reenact the boston tea party. 225 years ago, American 
protesters threw tea into Boston harbor because of high British taxes. 
In a slightly less dramatic move, their modern-day counterparts had 
to throw crates of leaves into the water because the price of tea 
these days is just too high.
