When we come back, important health news for women many a new cancer 
screening test. Man, that Chili was hot. You got heartburn, too? Yeah. 
Wanna try these new pepcid ac chewables? It says you gotta take it 
with water. What's the water for? With tums you don't need water. 
Just because new pepcid is chewable doesn't mean it works like tums. 
Tums calcium knocks out heartburn fast. Pepcid chewables' famotidine 
has to go through your bloodstream, so it takes 40 minutes just to 
start controlling acid. Wanna go back for water? Forget the water. 
Pass the tums. Tums ta tum tum tums oh, sweetie, I'm sorry. The more 
I wipe, the worse this tissue feels. No regular tissue sooths better 
than puffs plus-- not even the other national brand. It's the most 
soothing puffs ever. An incredibly soft tissue with lotion, with aloe 
and vitamin E. wow, that's magic. Can you feel the lotion? Maybe next 
time your nose won't get so red. - That would be magic. - Puffs plus. 
i'm 64. Is there anything I can do to stop bone loss? Absolutely. 
Here's proof. In a landmark clinical study, caltrate actually stopped 
bone loss... in women at risk for osteoporosis. Whatever your age: 
life's an adventure! Because you're over 50 and still exploring! So 
take the centrum made just for you. Centrum silver. With age-essential 
nutrients... specially adjusted to keep pace with your changing nutritional 
needs. Centrum silver: you know, the last I looked, the average workday 
lasts more than a few hours, right? Right. But average pain relievers 
may work for a few hours then quit. Well, now there's aleve. Aleve's 
the one with the strength... to work on arthritis pain all day long 
with just two pills. It would take eight Tylenol to do that. So, if 
your pain reliever isn't putting in a full day's work-- fire it. Fire 
it. And take aleve. Two pills, all day relief. Works for me.
