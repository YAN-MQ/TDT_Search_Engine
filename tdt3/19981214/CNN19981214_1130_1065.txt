More bad news for R.J.R. Nabisco. They plan to slash 3900 jobs from 
its tobacco division and cut an undetermined number of other positions 
as it continues to restructure its snack food business. R.J.R. plans 
to take a charge of nearly $350 million in the fourth company. They 
cite price hikes and the recent tobacco settlement for the charge 
as well as costs related to its food subsidiary.
