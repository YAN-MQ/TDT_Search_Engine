The New York Times said in an editorial Saturday, Dec. 19: No minds 
were changed, no impulse to substitute censure for impeachment suddenly 
seized the Republicans, but at least the bitterly partisan debate 
that rang through the House chamber Friday was relatively dignified. 
Having backed the country into this grim corner, the Republicans did 
their best to cloak their partisan enmity in constitutional trappings. 
Some of the speeches, including Henry Hyde's impassioned defense of 
the rule of law, were stirring. But even moments of soaring language 
could not alter the granite fact that the misconduct at issue does 
not warrant the impeachment and removal of President Clinton. It was 
by any measure one of the most mesmerizing days the nation has witnessed 
in recent decades. As House members debated the impeachment of the 
commander in chief, American forces continued their aerial bombardment 
of Iraq. Television coverage jumped from the House floor to the ghostly 
night sky over Baghdad. Hillary Rodham Clinton appeared briefly outside 
the White House to call for an end to divisiveness in America. Saddam 
Hussein showed up on Iraqi television to tell his countrymen he was 
alive and well. Bill Clinton, the man at the vortex, remained largely 
out of sight. The mismatch between Clinton's offenses and the punishment 
weighed by the House was never clearer than when the debate commenced. 
Here was the House called into session to exercise perhaps the greatest 
power vested in it by the Constitution, the impeachment of a president. 
Only once before in the nation's history _ in 1868 _ had such a question 
reached the House floor. But as the day unfolded it was obvious that 
this mighty constitutional firepower was being directed at conduct 
that calls for stern and lasting condemnation, but not by a formal 
recommendation for removal from office. Rep. John Lewis, a Georgia 
Democrat, most eloquently captured the sentiment shared by many Americans 
Friday. America's ``soul is aching, and her spirit is low,'' he told 
his colleagues. Reconciliation seems beyond the grasp of the House, 
which barring some last-minute miracle will Saturday set Clinton's 
place in history. But it need not be beyond the reach of the Senate 
or the nation. The wounds inflicted on the country by Clinton and 
his vengeful opponents can be healed only if the matter is quickly 
brought to an end with the censure of the president.
