It has never happened quite this way for the Jets, to be standing 
just 60 minutes away from a division crown. But a victory Saturday 
afternoon in Buffalo against the Bills can propel them to a division 
title for the first time since their last year in the American Football 
League, back in 1969. Throughout their history, dating to 1960, no 
Jets team has been able to say: win today, and win the division. Then 
again, only two Jets teams did finish first _ the 1968 and 1969 editions, 
when Joe Namath was at the helm, and each of these clubs went into 
the final weeks with a comfortable edge. For this once-troubled franchise, 
already assured of going into the playoffs for only the eighth time, 
a victory Saturday would also enable it to join the other pioneers 
who merged the two leagues back in 1970. Of all the clubs from both 
leagues that year _ 26 in all _ the Jets are the only one in the National 
Football League that has never finished first since. Of course, a 
division title is not all the 10-4 Jets are seeking. If they win and 
then win again next weekend against New England, they guarantee themselves 
a first-round bye in the playoffs and a second-round home game. And 
they will accomplish the same thing if they win today and Jacksonville 
loses either of its last two games. So there's plenty at stake in 
this game for a team that won a tough game in Miami just six days 
ago and now has to do it again. ``A victory would help,'' said Bill 
Parcells, the Jets' ever-practical, ever-wary coach. ``The more advantages 
you have in the playoffs helps. Last Sunday was a big step and if 
we can win this on the road, then people will say, `You deserve this.''' 
The Jets crunched the Bills, 34-12, in their first confrontation Nov. 
8 at Giants Stadium. But victory might not come so easily Saturday. 
For one thing, the Bills (9-5) can clinch a playoff spot by winning, 
not a bad achievement for a team that started the season at 0-3. And 
for another, Doug Flutie is 5-0 at home since becoming the Bills' 
starting quarterback, and he no doubt feels he has something to prove 
against the Jets, the only team to shut him down in his remarkable 
return to the NFL. And just how important is the playoff bye week, 
the rainbow at the end of the regular season that seems within the 
Jets' reach? Well, since 1970, only four teams have made it to the 
Super Bowl without first-round byes _ the 1980 Oakland Raiders, the 
1985 New England Patriots, the 1992 Buffalo Bills and the 1997 Denver 
Broncos. Parcells describes the bye as being able to play ``one-third 
fewer games.'' ``If you get a bye and you win one, you're playing 
to go to the Super Bowl,'' he said. ``I'm not saying you can't do 
it without a bye, but the percentages are against you. You have a 
chance to rest up.'' As for the division title, only three members 
of the Jets' family remain connected to the last one the Jets won, 
in 1969. They are Leon Hess, the owner; Bill Hampton, the equipment 
manager, and Frank Ramos, the public relations director. ``I love 
it,'' said Hampton, as he reflected on what life is like now. He joined 
the Jets 35 years ago, the year the team moved into Shea Stadium from 
the Polo Grounds. Hampton, who had been working with the New York 
Rangers, was told that Weeb Ewbank, who had taken over as the Jets' 
coach, was looking for an equipment manger. ``The job was only for 
six months a year. But I took it.'' Hampton and Ramos were among the 
last Jets to see Ewbank alive. The coach from their Super Bowl III 
victory died last month, days after he visited the Jets when they 
played in Indianapolis. Hampton recalled his last sighting of Ewbank, 
who molded the Jets in his dual role as general manager and coach. 
``He was sitting in a wheelchair at the end zone at the end of game,'' 
Hampton said, ``and someone wheeled him out and he left.'' For the 
first-place Jets of 1968 and 1969, practice was at Rikers Island, 
the prison. Ewbank had spotted a football field down there from an 
airplane on one of the Jets' trips. He didn't realize it was on prison 
grounds, but the city let him use it _ as long as prisoners could 
watch. The Jets were forbidden by the Mets to use Shea Stadium while 
the baseball season was under way. Thus, the Jets never played a preseason 
game at Shea in their 20 seasons there. In 1969, with the Mets going 
to the World Series, the Jets played their first five games on the 
road. They wandered. There was a moment when Ewbank stopped the bus 
near Flushing Meadow Park and said, ``Here's a place.'' They practiced. 
Place-kicker Jim Turner had a favorite spot he aimed for between two 
trees. And Ewbank once had to beg a youngster to move his bicycle. 
``No,'' replied the boy. ``It's as much my park as yours.'' Hampton 
recalled: ``Every time we practiced somewhere, I had to ship the dummies 
and the blocking sleds.'' As for the current crop of Jets, Hampton 
said, ``This group of guys is very similar. The chemistry, the leadership.'' 
And these days Hampton hears a little more often from the old crew 
_ Larry Grantham, Rocky Rochester, Ralph Baker, John Schmitt, all 
of them key members of the Super Bowl team. Later-edition Jets such 
as Marty Lyons and Bruce Harper keep in touch, too. Friday morning, 
as he always does before game day, Hampton could finally concentrate 
on the game. He knew he would be packing additional clothing for Buffalo, 
because there was snow in the forecast. But Parcells, Hampton said, 
``is liable to go out there with a light jacket on.'' ``He's so involved 
in the game,'' Hampton added. ``No hat.'' And Hampton had one more 
observation. ``It's easy to unpack when you win,'' he said, ``but 
when you lose it's a tough job.'' Meanwhile, Ramos was thinking back 
to 1970, when the Jets tried to keep their first-place streak intact 
for a third season. Instead, that season began a decade of failure. 
``Namath fractured his wrist in the fifth game of the season, and 
then in 1971 he hurt his good knee,'' Ramos said. In 1969, when the 
Jets arrived in Buffalo, Ramos set up a news conference just for Namath. 
``And 50 or 60 people attended,'' Ramos said. ``The impact of a Joe 
Namath was this: One particular player who transcended football. Here 
was a guy, a player, and he was hosting the Johnny Carson show.'' 
EXTRA POINTS: KEYSHAWN JOHNSON needs 10 more yards for the Jets to 
have a pair of 1,000-yard receivers for the first time since 1988. 
WAYNE CHREBET already has 1,009. The last tandem were AL TOON and 
WESLEY WALKER.
