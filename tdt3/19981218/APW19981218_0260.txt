Five senior army officers have been court marshaled for indiscipline 
and inciting mutiny among Zimbabwean troops fighting in the Congo, 
a newspaper reported Friday. One of the officers, a battalion commander, 
allegedly refused to obey orders during active service, the Zimbabwe 
Independent reported. There was no immediate response from the Defense 
Ministry in Harare and calls to the army's chief spokesman in Harare 
were not returned. The Independent said another of the five, identified 
as a Maj. Tuhwe, was cashiered from the service for inciting disaffection, 
fear, alarm and despondency among troops serving in the Congo. It 
said military intelligence bugged his home telephone and heard him 
say in a call from the front that ``people are dying, corpses are 
in plastic bags full of worms and soldiers are dying en masse.'' Last 
month, the same newspaper reported reinforcements of military police 
were sent to Congo after morale among Zimbabwe's 8,000 troops plummeted. 
The military in Harare denied that report but has done little to counter 
other reports that Zimbabwean forces were bogged down in the eastern 
Congo during heavy tropical rains. The Defense Ministry has said its 
casualties in fighting since Saturday for the strategic rebel-held 
town of Kabalo, 1,200 kilometers (740 miles) east of Kinshasa consisted 
of the deaths of two officers aboard a helicopter gunship that crashed 
Sunday. Zimbabwe said the gunship crashed with a mechanical failure 
but Congolese rebels claimed they shot it down, along with a Zimbabwean 
jet fighter, and killed 47 Zimbabwean soldiers. Zimbabwe and an alliance 
of forces from Angola, Namibia and Chad are supporting embattled Congolese 
President Laurent Kabila in the rebellion that began Aug. 2. Zimbabwe 
has acknowledged nine combat deaths and 17 Zimbabweans captured in 
the Congo.
