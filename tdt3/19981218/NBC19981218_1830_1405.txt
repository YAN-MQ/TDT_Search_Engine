As the house of represenatives continues to debate the four articles 
of impeachment against President Clinton tonight, I spoke to a man 
with vivid memories of the last time a president faced impeachment 
proceedings. Peter rodino presided over the Nixon impeachment hearings. 
Of course, President Nixon resigned before the debate went to the 
house floor. But rodino remembers what a difficult time it was. As 
chairman of the Judiciary committee in 1974, Peter rodino was little 
known and thought by many to be just a democratic party yes man. I 
shall urge the adoption of articles of impeachment. But he became 
a political legend for his fairness, modesty and the personal anguish 
he suffered. Mr. chairman, all that's going on in Washington, does 
that bring back difficult memories for you? I dreaded it 25 years 
ago, when I recall we voted articles of impeachment. And I then went 
into my cubby hole in the back and I called up my wife then, I cried, 
I broke down and cried. I didn't cry for myself, I cried for the country. 
What's the biggest difference between then and now in your judgment? 
The process was entirely different. Nixon had been charged with having 
committed such grave offenses, harmful to the people in the sense 
that they did serious injury to our rights, our liberties, our privileges. 
Rodino, now 89, teaches constitutional law at seton hall university 
and the republicans sent a delegate to get his advice before the hearings 
began. He said, make it bipartisan and remember the law. We have got 
to remember to find what high crimes and misdemeanors are all about. 
Rodino says a vote to impeach Clinton would be a mistake. What do 
you say to those republicans who say we cannot allow a president to 
deliberately lie to the what effectively is the judicial system of 
this country? I recognize the president has committed a grave offense 
in lying to the american people. So did Nixon lie, but I think the 
lie alone would not have caused them to impeach him. We forget that 
it's not just a vote that we've got to consider as of now. What is 
the effect going to be on the whole system? Former house Judiciary 
committee chairman Peter rodino.
