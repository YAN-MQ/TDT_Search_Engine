A top U.S. human rights official on Friday wrapped up a trip to Kosovo, 
calling the humanitarian situation in the successionist province ``deeply 
disturbing.'' U.S. Assistant Secretary of State for Human Rights Harold 
Hongju Koh, castigated the regime of Yugoslav President Slobodan Milosevic 
for a ``strong contempt for international law and human rights.'' 
Koh, who recently replaced John Shattuck in the post, met with Kosovo 
leaders foreign diplomats and others during a trip to Serbia's successionist 
province of Kosovo, where he also visited hospitals. In addition, 
Koh toured Montenegro, which together with Serbia makes up the Yugoslav 
Federation. In the wake of this week's upsurge in violence in Kosovo, 
Koh said the U.S. govenment ``deplores violence on all sides, and 
urges all parties to the conflict to avert a new cycle of retaliatory 
violence.'' Koh also assailed Serbian authorities for using their 
harsh new information law to threaten Albanian-language newspapers 
with closure if they don't change their editorial policies. ``These 
acts constitute an outrageous attack on free speech,'' he said. ``The 
United States government condemns these acts as the latest round in 
the Milosevic regime's self-destructive attack on its own civil society.'' 
Since the law was enacted in October, independent papers in the Yugoslav 
capital have been forced to stop printing or face huge fines. Among 
other ``disturbing practices,'' Koh said he saw Serbian police stationed 
outside the Pristina Hospital intensive care unit, and noted the ``normal 
citizens of Kosovo continue to be treated as military targets.'' ``Most 
of all, I saw a tired and demoralized population and a human rights 
catastrophe that is still unfolding.''
