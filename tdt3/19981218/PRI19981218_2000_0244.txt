one of Northern Ireland's outlawed paramilitary groups has begun handing 
in its weapons. Decommissioning is part of the Northern Ireland peace 
agreement reached on Good Friday in April. The loyalist volunteer 
force, a Protestant organization, is the first group to do so since 
the troubles began almost 30 years ago. British minister Mo Mullam 
says the move will help break the recent stalemate in Northern Ireland. 
MO MULLAM : It's a significant step and I hope more will follow and 
it is important because it means the Good Friday agreement which had 
a number of different bits to it, is progressing now on many more 
than it was 24 hours ago. The province's politicians have made a separate 
breakthrough. They have now agreed on power sharing arrangements with 
the Irish Republic.
