When it comes to receiving, many of America's chief executives have 
clearly been reaping fortunes. When it comes to giving, however, the 
picture is a lot murkier. After all, charity, though tax-subsidized, 
is a personal matter. Some of the best-paid corporate titans advertise 
their donations _ witness the recent $100 million gift from William 
H. Gates of Microsoft for childhood vaccinations or Ted Turner's $1 
billion pledge to the United Nations. But others, like John F. Welch 
Jr. of General Electric, say their giving is nobody else's business 
and disclose only what the tax laws demand. (Public records show only 
that Welch's charitable foundation gave away $134,186 last year.) 
Yet with the huge sums that many chief executives are making in this 
era of bull markets and stock options, they are increasingly being 
seen as standard-setters in philanthropy. ``It's important to give 
money away,'' Turner said, ``because the needs are so great and such 
great wealth is being accumulated.'' So Money and Business set out 
to survey the charitable giving of a sampling of the best-paid chief 
executives at the nation's 500 biggest companies. For this article, 
``pay'' was defined broadly, to include all the earnings an executive 
could have given away last year if he so chose: salary, bonus, other 
cash compensation and gains from the exercise of stock options _ plus 
gains from options he elected not to exercise. (The pay data were 
calculated by Graef Crystal, a compensation expert in San Diego.) 
By that definition, the pay packages of the 12 executives in the sampling 
ranged from $471.4 million for Michael D. Eisner, chairman of the 
Walt Disney Co., to $110.4 million for Louis V. Gerstner Jr., chairman 
of IBM. And beyond their pay, of course, some of these executives 
have other fortunes _ from smart investing or earlier jobs. Four of 
the 12 are on the latest Forbes magazine list of the 400 richest Americans. 
Information on the executives' giving is harder to come by than the 
numbers on their pay. Money and Business reviewed the public records 
of the business leaders' personal foundations, talked to people familiar 
with their giving, interviewed company officials and, when they would 
come to the phone, spoke with the executives themselves. Those who 
were unwilling to answer questions may be donating more than is publicly 
disclosed, but it is impossible to know. The available evidence shows 
that extremely rich executives can be extremely generous. Eli Broad, 
chairman of SunAmerica, the insurer in Los Angeles, gave away $11.6 
million last year. Sanford I. Weill, chairman of Citigroup, pledged 
$100 million, over an undisclosed number of years, to the medical 
school at Cornell University, his alma mater. Still, the biggest earners 
are not necessarily the biggest givers. Charles A. Heimbold Jr., chairman 
of Bristol Myers-Squibb, had a total pay package of $146.14 million 
and wrote checks last year for $5 million to a range of charities. 
The pay package of Eugene M. Isenberg, chairman of Nabors Industries, 
a Houston oil drilling company, was one-third higher, totaling $209.6 
million, and he gave away $2.5 million _ half as much as Heimbold, 
and about five times as much, Isenberg said, as he gives in an average 
year. ``To know people's income, sex or age won't give you much insight 
into their charitable giving or enable you to predict it,'' said Ann 
Kaplan, editor of Giving USA, an annual report on philanthropy. The 
youngest corporate chief on the list is just discovering charity. 
``It's only in the past two years that I felt I had the wherewithal 
to give away money,'' said Stephen M. Case, 40, the chairman of America 
Online, whose personal foundation over that time has grown from $1 
million in assets to more than $50 million. Of course, personal giving 
is not the only option for corporate executives. Many can, and do, 
exercise control over their companies' donations _ a source of status 
not available to the average giver. Such donations can leave executives 
in high demand as board members and community leaders. Not all chief 
executives are involved in their companies' foundations. And some, 
including Isenberg, do not believe in corporate philanthropy. In other 
cases, corporate giving mirrors the chief executive's interests; that 
is the case for IBM and Gerstner, a company spokesman said. Whatever 
the size of their giving, the wealthiest executives are often quite 
ordinary when it comes to choosing recipients. Like many other people, 
they direct much of what they give to religious, educational and health 
care causes. And their friends and colleagues often get them involved. 
According to Bishop Edward M. Egan, the head of the Roman Catholic 
Diocese of Bridgeport, Conn., it was Welch who prompted Gerstner and 
Lawrence J. Bossidy, chairman of the Allied Signal Corp., to become 
active in the Inner City Foundation, which supports educational and 
charitable programs, primarily for Catholic institutions but also 
for other religious and charitable groups. Gerstner was chairman of 
a recent dinner that raised $1.2 million for the foundation. He also 
gave $1 million to Faith in the Future, a program run by Egan that 
supports Catholic schools. Both Welch and Bossidy also donate money 
to the Sankaty Head Foundation, which provides college scholarships 
for caddies at the Sankaty Head Golf Club on Nantucket. ``Jack and 
Larry always get the best caddies,'' one longtime member joked.
