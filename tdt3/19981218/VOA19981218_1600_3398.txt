Although Roger Daltrey is best know as the lead singer of the legendary 
rock group The Who, he also gained moderate success as a solo artist 
as in this 1980 tune Without Your Love. This month Roger Daltrey has 
embarked on yet another direction, on the theatrical stage as the 
classic character Ebenezer Scrooge in Charles Dickens' A Christmas 
Carol. In performances at New York's Madison Square Garden, Mr. Daltrey 
wears a shaggy gray wig as he portrays the master miser. The New York 
Times newspaper review of the Christmas Carol says Roger Daltrey "plucks 
the heartstrings" when he presents the poor Cratchit family with a 
Christmas turkey. The musical version of A Christmas Carol with music 
by Alan Minken also allows Mr. Daltrey to sing some tunes as well 
as act. The New York production of the classic Dickens tale runs through 
December. I'm Steve Ember.
