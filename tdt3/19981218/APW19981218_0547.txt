Mindful of the recent blossoming in relations with the United States, 
Palestinian authorities moved Friday to contain protests against the 
bombing of Iraq. Protesters throughout the West Bank and Gaza Strip 
gathered after Friday morning Muslim prayers to protest the joint 
U.S.-British airstrikes on Iraq. The largest turnout was in Nablus, 
where thousands marched through the city chanting ``America is under 
our feet.'' and ``Britain is an enemy of God.''' The airstrikes began 
late Wednesday night after a United Nations report concluded that 
Iraq was not cooperating with inspectors seeking to contain its weapons-of-mass-destruction 
capability. The Nablus protesters shouted slogans against the recent 
Palestinian-U.S. rapprochement. Some marchers shook their fists in 
the air when they saw Palestinian leader Yasser Arafat's helicopter 
approach. Most protesters belonged to militant Islamic groups, but 
some belonged to Arafat's Fatah movement. Palestinian police stopped 
the marchers from heading toward an Israeli-controlled area of the 
West Bank, where the protesters had hoped to confront Israeli troops. 
The Palestinian Authority is anxious to be seen as abiding by the 
U.S.-brokered Wye River accords with Israel. U.S. President Bill Clinton 
visited Israel and the Palestinian areas earlier this week to try 
to break the deadlock in the accords. Palestinians, especially pleased 
by his hints of approval of Palestinian statehood, want to sustain 
the newly-friendly ties. Israel was to have withdrawn from West Bank 
territory Friday as part of the Wye accords. On Wednesday, Prime Minister 
Benjamin Netanyahu said he would miss the deadline and not move until 
he saw Palestinians were containing anti-Israel violence. Any anger 
Palestinians on the street might have felt by the missed deadline 
was swallowed up by the pro-Iraq protests. In Manger Square in Bethlehem 
_ where just days ago, Clinton was greeted rapturously _ several hundred 
marchers shouted ``Death to Clinton.'' Protesters burned a U.S. flag. 
Palestinian security briefly detained an Associated Press writer for 
photographing the flag-burning, and released him on condition that 
he not take pictures of other anti-U.S. actions. After the demonstration, 
the marchers threw stones at Israeli troops guarding the entrance 
to the city, just south of Jerusalem. The troops responded with rubber 
bullets and tear gas. Five protesters were injured. In another sign 
of Palestinian efforts to contain anti-U.S. sentiment, police shut 
down a TV station in Ramallah that had been broadcasting pro-Iraqi 
interviews. In Bet Douku, a village near Ramallah, over a thousand 
people joined the funeral procession Friday for a youth killed by 
Israeli troops during pro-Iraq demonstrations on Thursday. Mohammed 
Ismail, 20, was hoisted on a mattress, draped in a green sheet. ``With 
body and soul we will redeem you, martyr,'' they chanted. ``With body 
and soul, we will redeem you, Iraq!'' Some women chanted an address 
to his mother: ``Don't be upset, all children are your children!'' 
His mother, Delilah, sat on the floor of her house, surrounded women 
from village. A friend stroked her forehead as she sobbed, ``My beloved 
Mohammed.''
