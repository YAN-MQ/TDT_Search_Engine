National Basketball Association Commissioner David Stern delivered 
a six-year proposal to Players Union Chief Billy Hunter and every 
NBA player in the latest effort to end the labor dispute with team 
owners. The nine page memorandum shows the league making concessions 
on a hard salary cap, timing rules regarding the signing of free agents, 
and the escrow system which would be in place for the last three years 
of the deal. Now the proposal shows the average salary climbing to 
$4.6 million per season. The maximum salary for a 10-year veteran 
would be $24.5 million by 2004. It also calls for a percentage of 
basketball related income paid to players to fluctuate between 52 
and 57 percent. Now Billy Hunter has repeatedly said he will not accept 
a deal with an escrow package and he sent his own 19 page response 
to the players detailing the union's stance on each item in Stern's 
proposal. He said the union views the proposal as a desperate tactic 
by the NBA to end a player lockout which has lasted 170 days.
