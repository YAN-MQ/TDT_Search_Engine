In spite of a 30-year run as an actor, writer, dandy and celebrated 
wit, Quentin Crisp still lives in a kitchenless rooming house in the 
East Village that features communal bathrooms and no front-door buzzer. 
``If you'll phone me from that terrible Punjab cafe on the corner, 
I will whiz right down,'' he said on the telephone a few hours before 
his birthday party last Tuesday. ``When I get to the sidewalk, I will 
jump up and down. That is how you will recognize me.'' Crisp, who 
first achieved notoriety in 1958 with the publication of ``The Naked 
Civil Servant,'' a memoir of his travails as a gay misfit, could hardly 
be mistaken for anyone else. When he emerged, topped by his trademark 
fedora and wearing a sky-blue ascot and rhinestone-studded bolo tie, 
Crisp looked as regal as Gloria Swanson bound for a premiere. He did 
not jump up and down. In fact Crisp, who turns 90 on Christmas Day, 
was somewhat winded as he gingerly slid into a taxi. Cindy Adams' 
voice briefly intruded, cajoling passengers to buckle up. Crisp was 
unmoved. ``At my age,'' he said, pausing for effect, ``death would 
be most welcome.'' Mortality may have been on his mind, but the evening 
_ a party at the home of Cheryl Hardwick, a composer _ was a celebration 
of Crisp's life as a performer, humorist and unapologetically flamboyant 
homosexual. The tablecloths were lavender. So were the napkins, the 
plates and the frosting on the cake. In Ms. Hardwick's rococo parlor, 
the birthday boy settled into a love seat, his designated throne for 
the evening. ``We should have gotten some palm fronds,'' Ms. Hardwick 
said, as Crisp focused on his Pimm's Cup. The culinary theme was a 
nod to Crisp's origins: Welsh rabbit, Yorkshire pudding and bangers-and-mash 
fritters speared with toothpicks bearing tiny Union Jacks. Among those 
who literally knelt down to pay their respects to Crisp were John 
Waters; Kate Pierson of the B-52's; Hamish Bowles, an editor at Vogue, 
and Lady Bunny, the drag performer. Waters, who described Crisp as 
``a joyous influence on my life,'' met the writer in London in the 
late-1970s. Then an unknown filmmaker, he found Crisp's number in 
the phone book and soon after calling was invited over for tea. ``We 
had a lovely afternoon,'' Waters said. ``Unfortunately, he doesn't 
remember it.'' Ms. Hardwick hushed the crowd when Fran Lebowitz called 
from Paris to wish Crisp happy birthday via speaker phone. ``I have 
no idea who's listening,'' boomed Ms. Lebowitz. ``It's unnerving. 
I feel like Monica Lewinsky talking to Linda Tripp.'' Afterward, everyone 
sang ``God Save the Queen,'' with new lyrics directed at the guest 
of honor. Through it all, Crisp was composed but seemed exhausted 
by the attention. He still has the stamina for a one-man show, ``An 
Evening With Quentin Crisp,'' which opens Christmas Day at the Intar 
Theater, but he doesn't shy from discussion of the inevitable last 
curtain call. ``I want a significant death,'' he said. ``I don't want 
to die and have people say, `I thought he was dead already.''' What 
else does he hope to achieve in his lifetime? ``Now, I just want my 
voice to be in a taxicab,'' he said. He even has a message in mind, 
though it may not pass muster with the Taxi and Limousine Commission: 
``Life, to be sure, is not worth living, but if you think it is, then 
buckle up.''
