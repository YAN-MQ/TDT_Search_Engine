You can surf the World Wide Web without one bit of Microsoft code 
on your desktop, or one bit of Netscape Communications, for that matter. 
You need never venture near Yahoo, America Online or any other self-described 
portals. But every time you log into the Internet, you are touched 
by the products and technology of one company: Cisco Systems. Wall 
Street knows, of course. The second-most active stock in United States 
markets, Cisco has more than doubled in price this year, making it 
the sixth-best performer on the Standard &AMP; Poor's 500-stock index. 
And in a market that values money-losing Amazon.com at $15.1 billion 
and Yahoo at $21 billion, perhaps Cisco, with fiscal 1998 revenue 
of $8.5 billion and earnings of $1.4 billion, or 84 cents a share, 
deserves its market cap of $142.8 billion. Call it the thinking person's 
Internet stock. Sure, its market capitalization is huge and its multiple 
rich, but this is a company with real earnings from the Web right 
now. Nothing is as ubiquitous on the Internet as Cisco's routers, 
specialized computers that manage data traffic on a network using 
the Internet Protocol, known as IP. More than 80 percent of the routers 
connected to the Internet are Cisco's. And if you believe that the 
Internet will grow, and that Cisco's technology can remain competitive, 
then investing in Cisco is not so scary after all. Cisco has been 
hitting new highs in recent weeks and closed on another one Friday 
at $90.4375 on NASDAQ. That is about 62 times the consensus earnings 
estimate of $1.47 a share for the company for the fiscal year ending 
in July 1999. That multiple is more than twice the growth rate of 
the consensus earnings estimate, so this is clearly an expensive stock. 
But many technology analysts and fund managers say it is still a stock 
to own. Of 28 analysts surveyed by First Call, which tracks earnings 
estimates, 16 rate it a strong buy, 10 a buy and 2 a hold. ``Sure 
it's not cheap for any stock, but the growth rate has been phenomenal 
and should continue to be phenomenal going forward as long as data 
traffic continues to grow,'' said Alec Murray, associate director 
of research for MFS Investment Management, which owns 21 million Cisco 
shares in its MFS family of mutual funds. ``It's not a screaming buy 
here, but we think there is good upside potential in the stock,'' 
he said. The mainstay of Cisco's business is still routers, which 
perform the complex task of linking computer systems that may speak 
different languages. But the company has also branched out to include 
network switching devices, an alternative to routers, and remote-access 
servers, which let employees in the field connect to the network. 
Now Cisco is moving into equipment for telephone companies, offering 
them the ability to add data traffic voice services. ``IP data is 
growing by 1,000 percent per year, tripling every three months, and 
Cisco is the direct beneficiary of that,'' said Al Tobia, an analyst 
with Nationsbanc Montgomery Securities. ``The service providers have 
to add more and more gear from companies like Cisco.'' Tobia has a 
strong buy recommendation on Cisco, with a 12-month target price of 
$100. ``There is certainly money to be made,'' he said. But it is 
possible to admire Cisco the company without recommending the stock 
at the current price. Paul Saghawa, an analyst with Sanford C. Bernstein, 
has a rather lonely ``hold'' on Cisco, not because he dislikes it, 
but because he believes the current multiple suggests a near-term 
growth rate that may not be deliverable. ``If you ask me for a five-year 
picture, I believe Cisco will emerge as a key supplier to the telecommunications 
industry,'' he said. ``My problem is 1999. In order to make the numbers 
the Street has assigned, Cisco needs 35 percent top-line growth.'' 
But what if Cisco does not dominate the next generation of the Internet, 
when true broadband services become universal? Paul Johnson, an analyst 
with BancBoston Robertson Stephens, is widely known as the original 
Cisco bull, but even he notes that no industry leader has maintained 
dominance from one technology leap to another. IBM dominated the mainframe 
computer business in the 60s, Digital Equipment the minicomputer in 
the 70s, Microsoft the PC in the 80s and Cisco the network in the 
90s. Who comes next? ``To own Cisco at this point, you have to believe 
they own that next big thing, and I'm not sure I believe that,'' Johnson 
said. Still, he maintains a buy rating on Cisco, he said, because 
it is a well-managed company that will continue to grow. ``I don't 
spend a lot of time telling people to buy Cisco, but I do recommend 
it and take credit for its going up,'' he said. If you do believe 
in the next chapter of Cisco's story, how do you buy shares? Michael 
Murphy, editor of California Technology Stock Letter, suggests dollar-cost 
averaging _ buying a fixed dollar amount on a fixed schedule. ``They're 
always going to be expensive,'' he said. ``If you wait to buy on a 
value basis, you will never own Cisco.''
