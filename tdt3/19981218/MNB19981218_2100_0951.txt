Saturday morning during the house impeachment debate, representative 
Bob livingston, the house speaker-elect made a stunningnnouncement. 
What were supposed to be remarks on impeachment turned into a resignation 
speech, this from a man who was T have replaced Newt Gingrich. Larry 
Flynt of "hustler" fame offered a million dollars to anyone who could 
prove sexual indiscretions of anyone in Congress. In an interview 
with "the New York Times" for tomorrow morning's edition, livingston 
said he had underestimated the power of money. Livingston goes on 
to say that in the end it is his fault and his fault alone. The interview 
was part of a front page article this Tuesday's "New York Times."
