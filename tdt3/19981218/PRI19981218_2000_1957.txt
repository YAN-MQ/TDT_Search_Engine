Rare medieval manuscripts, including a first edition of works by William 
Shakespeare, have been stolen from a university in northeast England. 
Police say two manuscripts and five books were taken from display 
cases at Durham University. It's impossible to put an exact price 
on the work, but police estimate their value at more than $400,000.
