In pretty quiet trading today, the Dow Jones Industrials rose 28 points 
to close at 8904. The NASDAQ picked up 42 points on the day today 
to close at 2086. Wall Street's calm in the face of the attacks on 
Iraq and the impeachment drama in Washington. Patrick O'Connell has 
more now from our business desk in New York. From the outside looking 
in, it could appear a tale of two cities. The nation's capital is 
making history; its financial capital is not. While it appears to 
be rising with some stocks hitting records, in truth the overall tone 
on Wall Street is quiet. The most common explanation is that investors 
from home and abroad have arrived at a consensus and it's priced into 
stocks. Robert Hormats, vice chairman of Goldman Sachs International, 
explains. The general view is that he will not be thrown out of office. 
Most people anticipate that. They anticipate a very messy period in 
Washington. It'll be like a black hole, suck up all the attention. 
But in the end there will not be a removal of the President and in 
fact something will go on. During the Nixon period, things went on. 
I think in Washington they will too. Normally the beginning of a session 
of Congress relatively little happens anyway, so it's not as if it 
will stop the process entirely because their wouldn't have been much 
action in any case. So if it's political hopes and fears in Washington, 
for New York it's expectations that help explain the stock market. 
Then there's Treasury Secretary Rubin and Fed Chairman Alan Greenspan. 
No one expects any change there. Wall Street economist Brian Fabrey 
from Paribas says investors are also waiting for a revolution on the 
world's currency markets. I don't think the markets are blase to the 
crippling of Baghdad and sort of impeachment of the President. What 
I really think is that a full set of decisions have been made by financial 
leaders in the United States and elsewhere, London of course, and 
that is contain actions in the markets to be as minimal as possible 
during the introduction of the euro. In a year then when global events 
gusted the U.S. stock market, the optimists will surely be hoping 
that the current quiet in fact shows some strength. For the World, 
I'm Patrick O'Connell in New York.
