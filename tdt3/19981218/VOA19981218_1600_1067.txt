Saturday's other game has the Tampa Bay Buccaneers taking on the Washington 
Redskins. Now the Bucs have a chance to make the playoffs as a wildcard 
team. Buccaneers coach Tony Dungy says even if Tampa Bay does not 
make the post season, the team is playing the kind of football it 
likes. We felt we could play this way and we have always said it is 
better to be playing your best football in November and December and 
hopefully it will be good enough to get us in there but if not, you 
know we have the satisfaction of knowing that this is the type of 
team that we could have.
