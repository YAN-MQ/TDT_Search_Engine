Former Philippine first lady Imelda Marcos snubbed a Senate hearing 
Friday on claims that her husband entrusted his fortune to former 
business associates who now refuse to return it. Senator Aquilino 
Pimentel, chairman of the Senate Blue Ribbon Committee, issued a subpoena 
to compel Mrs. Marcos to appear at the resumption of the hearing on 
Monday. Senator Raul Roco, chairman of the Senate committee on banks, 
which called for the hearing, said Mrs. Marcos must show respect to 
the chamber by appearing at the hearing, but that she could not be 
forced to talk. The widow of former dictator Ferdinand Marcos claimed 
earlier this month that her family owns much of the country and plans 
to sue her husband's former ``cronies'' who have refused to turn over 
the wealth he entrusted to them. The suit would try to recover at 
least 500 billion pesos (dlrs 12.65 billion) in equity in more than 
100 top Philippine corporations where Marcos' associates allegedly 
served as his front men. Mrs. Marcos claims her family had controlling 
interests in such blue chip concerns as the Philippine Long Distance 
Telephone Co., the biggest telecommunications carrier in the country 
which is partially owned by Hong Kong-based First Pacific. She also 
said her family is the rightful owner of a large stake in San Miguel 
Corp., the largest food and beverage conglomerate in the nation. Other 
companies targeted by Marcos include United Coconut Planters Bank, 
Allied Bank and Asia Brewery. ``We practically own everything in the 
Philippines,'' Mrs. Marcos was quoted as saying by the Philippine 
Daily Inquirer, which ran a series of reports on her claims. One of 
her lawyers, Rudolfo Jimenez, said Mrs. Marcos should not be forced 
to appear at the hearing because she could incriminate herself. ``I 
am trying to prevent the possibility of a fishing expedition, to fish 
for evidence that has never been there,'' Jimenez said. During Friday's 
hearing, Inquirer reporter Christine Herrera gave copies of her taped 
interviews with Mrs. Marcos. Roco said the tapes would establish that 
Mrs. Marcos indeed made the claims. ``Her problem is she talked already. 
You cannot thereafter claim these are confidential after you blurted 
out to all and sundry,'' he said. Ms. Herrera also showed a transcript 
of her interview with Mrs. Marcos in which the former first lady said 
that a senior member of the President Joseph Estrada's Cabinet, Executive 
Secretary Ronaldo Zamora, held shares for the Marcos family in Security 
Bank, which has been sequestered by the government. Zamora, however, 
said her claim was ``completely untrue.'' Reacting to the transcript, 
Mrs. Marcos said in a statement that the Inquirer was ``taking things 
out of context.'' ``Comments made in levity are distorted and reported 
as gospel truth. Besides, Ronnie Zamora has nothing to do with Security 
Bank. He is a dear friend with impeccable credentials,'' Mrs. Marcos. 
Some officials have expressed disbelief about her ``fantastic'' claims, 
but Roco indicated he had an open mind. ``Why should I not listen 
to a first lady who says she wants to tell the truth?'' he said. The 
government has accused the Marcoses of illegally enriching themselves 
during his 20-year rule. But Mrs. Marcos claims her husband was already 
a wealthy lawyer even before he was elected president in 1965 by having 
traded gold and secretly helped raise money for the Philippine government. 
The government has put claims on Marcos' wealth, including about dlrs 
570 million in his Swiss deposits now held in an escrow account in 
a Philippine bank. The Swiss accounts are also being claimed by 9,539 
Filipinos who won a class action suit for human rights violations 
against the Marcos estate and were awarded dlrs 2 billion in damages. 
Marcos was ousted in a popular revolt in 1986 and died in exile in 
Hawaii three years later. He had denied any wrongdoing.
