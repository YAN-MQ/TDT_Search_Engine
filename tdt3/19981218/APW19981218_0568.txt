Underdog South Korea showed opportunism and a concrete defense to 
rally from 10 points down Friday and defeat Asian rugby giant Japan 
21-17 for the Asian Games rugby union gold medal. Taiwan beat Sri 
Lanka 38-20 for the bronze. Jubilant South Korean officials said the 
pair of rugby gold medals their team has won here _ they defeated 
Japan in the sevens last week _ marked a new era in Asian rugby, ending 
traditional Japanese dominance. ``This is the biggest victory we have 
ever had, said Ko Byung-kyo, a director of the Korean Rugby Football 
Union. ``I think that this is the beginning of a new era. This is 
a team of great motivation.'' Japan's coach, Seiji Hirao, called his 
team's defeat ``unfortunate'' and blamed its inability to win a gold 
medal on numerous injuries. ``We made a lot of mistakes in the end,'' 
Hirao said. ``The Koreans put on good pressure and they had good fighting 
spirit on their team.'' Japan took the lead in the 4th minute on a 
try, with a score of passes veering back and forth until scrum half 
Katsuji Ohara edged over the left corner flag. Fly half Keiji Hirose 
converted for 7-0. The Koreans drew even in the 16th minute when right 
flanker Woo Tae-il broke loose and sprinted 40 meters across the Japanese 
try line. Fly half Kim Jae-sung converted. But 11 minutes later, Kim 
kicked wide on a 30-meter penalty that would have put Korea ahead. 
Hirose didn't make the same mistake with a penalty chip near the end 
of the half and put Japan ahead, 10-7. In the second half, the Japanese 
widened their lead in the 5th minute when right wing Tsutomo Matsuda 
scooped up a loose ball and made a wide, hooking run 25 meters around 
the Korean defense for a try. Hirose's conversion made it 17-7. The 
Koreans drove the ball within five meters of a try several times, 
only to give up possession. But in the 29th minute they finally got 
one across with Lim Sung-soo, and Kim converted, bringing the team 
back within striking range at 17-14. Four minutes later, center Yoo 
Min-suk, who was instrumental in many drives, carried to about 13 
meters before being submerged by Japanese. Woo came up with the ball 
and broke through for his second try. Kim made the conversion for 
a 21-17 lead. The Japanese poured on pressure, but for 20 minutes 
and well into extra time they crashed into a rock-hard Korean defensive 
wall within meters of scoring. After watching his team's poor showing 
Hirao said he would be making a number of changes to his side before 
next year's rugby World Cup. Ko, meanwhile, was calculating his team's 
chance of overcoming the Netherlands in a qualifier in the sport's 
most prestigious tournament. In the bronze decider, Lin Yi-te, Wen 
Kuang-liang, Chen Chia-hsin and Wu Chih-Hsien scored tries for Taiwan. 
Kuo Shan-pen converted three and kicked four penalty goals. I. Bandaranayake 
scored Sri Lanka's sole try. Nalaka Weerakkody kicked five penalty 
goals for the balance.
