The body of a prominent Serbian official was found early Friday, just 
hours after he was kidnapped, apparently by Kosovo Albanian guerrillas, 
Serb sources reported. The body of Zvonko Bojanic, the district mayor 
of Kosovo Polje, a town just 5 kilometers (3 miles) west of the provincial 
capital Pristina, was found by the province's main east-west road, 
the Serb-run Media Center said. The report did not say who found the 
body but cited the Serb official's family who witnessed Bojanic's 
abduction Thursday night from his home in a nearby village by five 
masked rebels in guerrilla uniform.
