The outgoing House speaker, Rep. Newt Gingrich, R-Ga., uttered a thanks, 
but no thanks, as did the man who will replace him next month, Rep. 
Robert Livingston, R-La. Too messy, too contentious, they said, at 
least privately, in reference to presiding over the House vote on 
the impeachment of President Clinton. But Rep. Ray LaHood, R-Ill., 
who is independent-minded and respected for his comity, was only too 
``honored'' to accept the task. So when the House began its momentous, 
highly charged debate on Friday, LaHood was the man occupying the 
speaker's chair, gavel in hand, presiding over his colleagues and 
their inflamed passions. From his elevated position high above the 
well of the House, LaHood's job was to recognize the ``gentle lady'' 
or the ``gentleman'' before they spoke or gavel them into silence 
if they got out of hand. With all the efficiency of a study-hall monitor, 
LaHood constantly interrupted members' speeches because their colleagues 
were loitering in the aisles. ``I'm going to ask everyone in the chamber 
to take a seat,'' he repeatedly said. ``If you want to be in the chamber, 
you have to be in a seat. If you want to remain in the chamber, you 
have to be in a seat. We have to have order. All _ both sides will 
require order.'' Presiding over the House as speaker pro tempore is 
not a new role for LaHood, 53, who was elected to Congress as part 
of the rebel class in 1994, has eschewed the fiery oratory of most 
of his classmates for the subtler, consensus-building approach of 
his onetime boss, the former minority leader Robert Michel. With his 
reputation for evenhandedness and his parliamentary prowess, which 
he gleaned as Michel's aide, LaHood was tapped early on, and often, 
after Republicans won the majority, to handle the duties of the chair, 
a responsibility that in theory belongs to the speaker. LaHood will 
also be the one who decides, when the House actually votes on the 
articles of impeachment Saturday, when to use the gavel to cap off 
a vote or when to hold off, a move that gives the ``whips'' a few 
extra minutes to cajole members into changing their minds. ``It is 
an art form,'' said retiring Rep. David Skaggs, D-Colo., who often 
presided over the House when his party was in control. ``It takes 
an ability to sense the mood of the House, track the chemistry of 
what is going on in the floor, apply the gavel lightly or hard, depending 
on what is warranted.'' LaHood has occupied the chair during some 
of the House's most emotional debates, including votes on a form of 
late-term abortion and on Medicare. He was also given the job of overseeing 
former Rep. Robert Dornan's one-minute speeches on the House floor, 
which tended to turn into seething diatribes against Clinton. Unlike 
many of his revolution-minded colleagues, LaHood reveres Congress 
as an institution and has worked to shore up decorum. Last year he 
joined forces with Skaggs to organize a well-attended bipartisan retreat 
in Pennsylvania to encourage more civility among members of Congress. 
It is an attitude, LaHood said, that has permeated his Republican 
district, once the territory of Everett McKinley Dirksen, who went 
on to be elected to the Senate and helped shepherd the civil rights 
bills of the 1960s. LaHood also flashes an independent streak when 
he chooses, like when he became one of only three Republicans who 
did not sign the Contract With America, the party's 1994 manifesto. 
As for Clinton's impeachment, while no one expects him to buck the 
leadership, LaHood says he falls into the undecided category.
