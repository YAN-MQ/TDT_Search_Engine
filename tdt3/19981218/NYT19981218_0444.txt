The bookshelves in the conference room of Tweedy, Browne &AMP; Co. 
are lined with financial history. Dry securities references, some 
of them filigreed and bound in cracked brown leather, date back to 
1939. These were the books that Howard Browne, a co-founder, consulted 
when he bought and sold stocks for the likes of Benjamin Graham, the 
father of value investing and the firm's biggest customer in the 1930s 
and 1940s. Later, in the 1960s, Tweedy Browne brokered for Warren 
E. Buffett, the sage of Omaha, and sold him his original shares of 
Berkshire Hathaway Inc., which he now runs. No doubt about it, Tweedy 
Browne's value roots stretch deep. Today, two of Harold Browne's sons, 
William H., 54, and Christopher H., 52, are among the five managing 
partners of the firm. There have been some changes: 70 percent of 
the firm was sold in October 1997 to Affilliated Managers Group, for 
$300 million, though the deal had to do with estate planning purposes, 
not market concerns. Tweedy, Browne now has $1.5 billion in accounts 
managed for individual clients; those accounts have returned an annual 
average of 19.1 percent, net of fees, from 1975, when the company 
registered with the Securities and Exchange Commission as an investment 
advisor, through Sept. 30 of this year, according to company reports. 
That compares with an annual average return of 16.4 percent for the 
Standard &AMP; Poor's 500-stock index over the same period. The firm's 
mutual funds, which are relatively new, have also outperformed. Since 
its inception in December 1993, the $1.12 billion Tweedy, Browne American 
Value fund has returned an annual average of 18.6 percent, through 
Dec. 11, versus 13.4 percent for the average mid-cap value fund tracked 
by Morningstar Inc., the Chicago financial publisher. The $2.5 billion 
Tweedy, Browne Global Value fund, started in June 1993, has returned 
an annual average of 14.3 percent, versus 11.2 percent for the average 
world stock fund. The crux of the firm's investing style comes down 
to buying a stock for less than its so-called intrinsic value _ just 
plain ``value'' to these veterans _ a relatively simple concept introduced 
by Graham. As John D. Spears, 50, a third managing partner, described 
it, ``Value is what a business, its assets or its earning power would 
be worth if you or I own it and we were to sell it to a competitor 
down the street.'' Simple. But if figuring value is easy, why do so 
many value investors fall flat? ``To buy deep value takes a lot of 
courage, because it looks really ugly,'' Christopher Browne said. 
``The companies are cheap because there are a lot of bad stories out 
there.'' William Browne added, ``It's like looking for the ugliest 
spouse because she will love you the most.'' The five Tweedy, Browne 
managers _ the other two are Thomas H. Shrager and Robert Q. Wyckoff 
Jr. _ attack value from a variety of angles. They use fundamental 
balance-sheet and income-statement analysis, looking for stocks that 
sell for 50 percent to 60 percent of their estimate of intrinsic value. 
Buying a stock requires the approval of two of the funds' three top 
dogs _ Spears and the two Browne brothers. Disputes rarely, if ever, 
break out among this conservatively suited crowd. ``We use the same 
analytical tools and the same valuation benchmarks,'' Christopher 
Browne said. When a stock's price reflects its intrinsic value, they 
sell. Every day, the managers receive a tip sheet of sorts, in the 
form of SEC Form 4 filings, required of insiders who buy shares in 
their company. Such insider buying often flags a likely candidate. 
In lieu of the company visits favored by many tire-kicking fund managers, 
the Tweedy, Browne crew uses marathon telephone interviews, which 
are taped. Transcripts from some of the interviews can run 50 or 60 
pages long. ``We call them depositions,'' Christopher Browne said. 
They cross-examine management, using a checklist of 17 standard earnings 
outlook and value questions, known inside the firm by the acronym 
``Pucci,'' for pricing, unit sales, costs, competition and insider 
buying. The questions cover two single-spaced typed pages. The macro 
picture isn't important to them. ``John Kenneth Galbraith once said 
that there are two types of economic forecasters: those that don't 
know, and those that don't know that they don't know,'' William Browne 
said. In specific stocks, the American Value fund is adding to its 
position in Household International Inc., the largest consumer finance 
company and small-loan company since it acquired the Beneficial Corp. 
in June. ``The CEO, who has a large number of shares under options, 
has begun spending a lot of his money buying stock, and the CFO is 
buying stock,'' Wyckoff said, referring to William F. Aldinger and 
David A. Schoenholz. Its share price dropped from the low $50s in 
July to $23 in October; it now is at $34.875. Household sells for 
just 10.5 times Tweedy Browne's estimate for 1999 earnings, including 
goodwill amortization after taxes, which makes the earnings higher 
than reported, Wyckoff said. He figures that Household is probably 
in the bottom 10 percent of companies its size, based on its price-to-earnings 
multiple, and puts its intrinsic value at $60 a share. Its purchase 
of Beneficial should make it more profitable, he said. American Value 
began buying Rayonier Inc., a timber company, in March. ``It came 
up in our radar,'' Spears said, when a directors, Rand Araskog, the 
former chief executive of ITT, ``bought more than a hundred thousand 
shares.'' Spears estimated Rayonier's intrinsic value at $85 a share, 
more than twice its current price of $41.625. The fund began buying 
shares of MBIA Inc., a municipal bond insurer, at $55 a share in November. 
``We notice that a director, a former CEO of Fireman's Fund Insurance 
Company, which was one of the founders of MBIA, bought 40,000 shares 
recently at prices up to $70,'' Christopher Browne said, referring 
to Joseph W. Brown. MBIA closed on Friday at $62.75. ``Earnings are 
locked in, because they write insurance and take the premium into 
income over the life of the bonds,'' he said. The company sells for 
12 times projected 1999 earnings, putting it in the bottom 10 percent 
of companies its size. Tweedy, Browne estimates its intrinsic value 
at $100. Though the firm invests abroad, it doesn't look for insider 
buying there. ``It's not part of the culture of most companies outside 
the U.S.,'' William Browne said. The Global fund recently bought shares 
in Fraser &AMP; Neave, a Singapore brewer, which is also the anchor 
bottler of Coca-Cola in Vietnam, Malaysia, and Singapore and an owner 
of real estate in Singapore. In Singapore dollars, its book value 
is more than $8 a share, but it trades at less than $5, said William 
Browne, who puts its intrinsic value as high as $9. Earnings have 
fallen from more than 50 cents a share last year to 20 cents a share 
now. The stock sells for less than eight times its normal earnings 
power of 65 cents per share, which is what he expects the company 
to make in 2000. The firm has also acquired shares in Crown Van Gelder, 
a Dutch paper company. It bought shares for 28 guilders in October 
and November, down from 37 guilders last spring, and puts its intrinsic 
value at 43 guilders. It now trades at 29 guilders. Crown is a cyclical 
stock, yields 6.9 percent and shows no debt on its balance sheet.
