General Motors Corp. sent a top technology executive here recently 
to promote the latest version of its EV1 electric car, which has new 
batteries that are supposed to double the driving range to 140 miles 
between charges. ``We're still going after the innovator who wants 
the latest,'' said Frank Pereira, the GM brand manager for advanced 
technology vehicles. ``This will reach a greater circle of people. 
It will have utility for more of them.'' In an effort to dispel consumer 
reservations over the costs associated with the aerodynamic two-seater, 
GM also lowered by $1,000, to $500, the cost of installing a home 
recharger _ a requirement of ownership, since the charging process 
takes several hours. There are just 300 public charging sites in Southern 
California and the San Francisco Bay area. There are 43 charging sites 
in Arizona; GM also leases its electric car in Phoenix and Tucson. 
Also this month, Ford cut the cost of its home recharging equipment 
to $295 and lowered the lease price of its electric Ranger pickup 
to $349 or $450 a month, depending on the batteries. GM will produce 
just 500 of the 1999-model EV1s, including the new version equipped 
with a pack of 26 nickel-metal-hydride batteries that cost $35,000 
a car. The nickel-metal EV1 will lease for $499 a month for three 
years, including the cost of the charger. GM will also offer a so-called 
high-capacity version, with improved lead-acid batteries that are 
supposed to increase the range by 20 percent and will lease for $424 
a month. Last year's EV1, with conventional lead-acid batteries, cost 
$399 a month. The new model looks just like its predecessor, whose 
range turned out to be generally less than the predicted 90 miles 
between charges. Demand for the EV1 has been tepid since its introduction 
in December 1996, with only about 540 being leased. Sales did not 
even budge after a local utility company offered employees a $100-a-month 
subsidy last summer, said Robert Randall, an EV1 salesman in the Orange 
County city of Irvine. ``That proved to us price was not the issue.'' 
California is the nation's proving ground for electric vehicles, sparked 
by state regulations requiring that 10 percent of all vehicles sold 
in the state be emission-free starting in 2003. About 1,700 electric 
vehicles have been sold in the last two years, including models from 
Toyota, Honda and Ford. Chrysler plans to start selling an electric 
minivan here next year. The state is also a battleground over the 
best method for recharging electric cars. The EV1 uses an inductive 
system that transmits energy through a paddle, in the form of alternating 
magnetic fields. Ford's electric Ranger, Honda's EV Plus and Chrysler's 
Epic van use conductive charging, drawn from a copper plug similar 
to those used for clothes dryers and electric ranges. Toyota is switching 
its 1999 RAV4-EV to inductive charging, from conductive. The charging 
dispute is akin to the Beta vs. VHS battle in videocassette recorders, 
or the Apple vs. Microsoft split in personal computers. The two methods' 
technical merits and cost differences were hotly debated at the industry 
conference in Phoenix this month where Ford and General Motors made 
their announcements. Left unresolved, the squabble over a single charging 
standard will hurt the industry, said Tom Gage, business manager of 
AC Propulsion Inc. in San Dimas, Calif., which makes electric vehicle 
motors powered by lead-acid batteries. For electric cars to become 
more than niche vehicles, charging sites must be ubiquitous and batteries 
must cost less, Gage said. The true economic costs of the batteries 
and the charging infrastructure are being masked by subsidies from 
utilities, governments and the automakers. ``At some point, it has 
to become a real business,'' he said. Mark Sterner, an EV1 owner from 
Riverside, Calif., said he expected nickel-metal-hydride batteries 
to assuage fears of running out of charge, as happened to him one 
cold day when he was driving into headwinds between mountains. Instead 
of calling a tow truck, he settled into a motel in Banning, an isolated 
desert town on the way to Palm Springs, to use a portable 110-volt 
emergency recharger. ``They look at you funny when you say you only 
want a place for three hours,'' he said. He plans to get one of the 
new, longer-range EV1s soon. ``No more nights in Banning,'' he said.
