NATIONAL FORECAST Blizzard warnings were issued for northern Montana 
on Friday as a bitterly cold Arctic air mass crossed the Canadian 
border. Saturday, with the frigid air mass driven south by an extraordinarily 
strong high pressure system over the Yukon, the brunt of the Arctic 
chill will plunge southward into the Rockies and western high Plains, 
while only oozing east toward the upper Mississippi Valley. The extent 
of the Arctic plunge will be extreme across the central and southern 
Plains, with a shallow layer of Arctic air penetrating into west Texas. 
Patches of freezing drizzle will glaze the region. Snow will likely 
fall as far south as western Kansas, where a deeper layer of Arctic 
air will gather. Snow and frigid air will also team together from 
the Front Range of the Rockies to the Continental Divide from northeastern 
New Mexico to Montana. Arctic air will ooze eastward into the western 
Great Lakes region in the wake of a low pressure system that dove 
southeast from Alberta a couple of days ago. Cold northerly winds 
behind this ``Alberta clipper'' will be moistened in transit over 
Lake Superior, setting the stage for heavy snow squalls on Michigan's 
upper peninsula. East of the clipper, broken areas of snow will develop 
across upstate New York and northern New England as milder, moister 
air is forced to rise over slowly retreating cold air. Meanwhile, 
clusters of showers and isolated thunderstorms will form over the 
Southeast and Middle Atlantic states as a weakening jet stream disturbance 
lifts northeast from Mississippi. Focus: Alberta Clipper Alberta clippers 
are fast-moving low-pressure systems that dive southeast from the 
Canadian province of Alberta during winter. Because of their speed 
and the general lack of moisture along their paths, snowfalls typically 
amount to no more than a few inches. Heavier accumulations can occur 
near the Great Lakes and the Northeast Coast, where additional moisture 
can be gleaned. But Alberta clippers attain great notoriety because 
they are a mechanism by which Arctic air is transported south. Saturday, 
Arctic air will ooze into the upper Middle West in arrears of an Alberta 
clipper in Ontario.
