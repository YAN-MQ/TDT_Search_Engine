Today is Friday, December 18, 1998, on this date in 1865 Secretary 
of State William Seward proclaimed the ratification of the 13th amendment 
to the United States Constitution. The amendment closed a bitter chapter 
in American history as it banned slavery in the United States and 
all of its territories. The amendment applied to governments as well 
as individuals. Under subsequent Supreme Court rulings, the 13th amendment 
became a guarantee against forced labor. Well we are coming up on 
hours Universal time and that means we are closing down all of our 
frequencies to the Middle East, North Africa, and Europe except for 
1548 kilohertz medium wave through the Persian Gulf region. In Europe 
during the next hour, VOA News Now can be heard on WRN1 via Astra 
Channel 22 audio subcarrier 7.38 megahertz.
