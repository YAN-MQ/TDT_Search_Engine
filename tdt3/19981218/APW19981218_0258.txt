Mexico, Venezuela and Saudi Arabia discussed cutting oil production 
by two million barrels a day but failed to reach an agreement, Mexico's 
oil minister said Friday. Luis Tellez said he discussed with his colleagues 
from Venezuela and Saudi Arabia a proposal under which OPEC members 
would bear the burden of cutting output by 1.5 million barrels a day 
and non-OPEC members would account for the remaining 0.5 million barrels 
a day. But the ministers failed to finalize the proposal. The meeting 
followed similar gatherings of oil ministers from other countries. 
All were trying to find a way to boost oil prices. Crude prices, depressed 
by overproduction amid a global economic crisis, have hovered this 
year around 12-year lows, costing oil-dependent nations billions of 
dollars in revenue. The statement said Saudi Arabia, Mexico and Venezuela 
reaffirmed their commitment to reductions agreed in June 1998. Speaking 
Friday, Mexico's Tellez said Iranian compliance remained an issue. 
He said that Saudi oil minister Ali Naimi was planning to visit Iran 
in the near future to convince the country to adhere to the 3.6 million 
barrel a day baseline that Iran agreed to in March. Tellez also said 
that Naimi had asked another OPEC minister to visit Iran for the same 
purpose. He would not specify which oil minister Naimi had asked, 
but said that this visit may already have taken place.
