The New York Times said in an editorial on Saturday, Dec. 19: ``There's 
gray smoke _ actually it's gray tilting toward white,'' Gov. George 
Pataki quipped during a break in negotiations over New York state's 
charter-school legislation. Likening his backroom talks with legislative 
leaders to the secretive manner used by the College of Cardinals to 
select a new pope was distressingly apt. The governor pushed through 
legislation empowering nonprofit groups to open taxpayer-financed 
charter schools without a single round of hearings or the debate it 
deserved. New York will now join more than 30 states with charter-school 
statutes, and Pataki will have a policy that appeals to conservatives 
should he choose to run in Republican presidential primaries in 2000. 
In return for the Legislature's hasty approval of the charter-school 
measure on Friday, the governor will sign a bill giving legislators 
a 38 percent pay raise, their first since 1989. Salaries of the governor, 
his cabinet and most judges will also rise. The school measure embraced 
by the governor, Assembly Speaker Sheldon Silver and Joseph Bruno, 
the Senate majority leader, authorizes the creation of up to 100 charter 
schools. As many as 50 of those charters would be issued by the State 
University of New York and the rest would be awarded by the State 
Board of Regents. There is no cap on the number of public schools 
that could convert into charter schools. But such conversions would 
require the approval of the regents, parents and the local school 
board. That lever would give superintendents like New York City Schools 
Chancellor Rudy Crew a role in shaping some charter schools. The governor 
and Silver each made a major concession. Pataki dropped his call for 
a charter school commission and recognized the oversight responsibilities 
of the regents, a safeguard sought by the speaker. Silver agreed that 
10 charter schools regardless of size and those with fewer than 250 
students will fall outside the jurisdiction of the teachers unions 
in the first year of operation, a plank sought by the governor. The 
legislative package also allows New York's dairy farmers to join the 
Northeast Interstate Dairy Compact, a longstanding item on Pataki's 
wish list. Environmentalists and natural-food advocates support the 
compact as a way to help save small farmers. But consumer groups, 
rightly in our view, see it as a hidden milk tax on consumers that 
would hit poor families the hardest.
