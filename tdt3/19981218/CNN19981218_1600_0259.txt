First lady Hillary Rodham Clinton says the holiday season is a "time 
for reflection and reconciliation among people." In answering a question 
about impeachment this morning, she said the U.S. ought to end its 
divisiveness. She also commended the president for his work. Well, 
I think, you know, the vast majority of Americans share my approval 
and pride in the job that the president's been doing for our country. 
And I think that view is shared not only by the vast majority of Americans, 
but by people all over the world.
