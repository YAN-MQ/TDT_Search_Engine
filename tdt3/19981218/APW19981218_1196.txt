The Saudi royal palace announced Friday that a new moon had been sighted, 
signaling that the Islamic fasting month of Ramadan will begin Saturday. 
The Supreme Legal Council, the country's top religious body, said 
in a statement that ``tomorrow, Saturday will be the first day of 
the holy month of Ramadan.'' The statement added that many people 
saw the new moon in different parts of the kingdom. Later in the day, 
Iraq, Kuwait, Bahrain and Lebanon announced that Ramadan would begin 
Saturday. But Egypt's chief Islamic official, Mufti Nasr Farid Wassel, 
announced that Saturday will be the last day of the Islamic month 
of Shaaban, meaning that Ramadan will begin Sunday in Egypt. Since 
the beginning of the month depends on the sighting of the new moon, 
Muslim nations disagree almost every year on when the month begins. 
Ramadan marks God's revelation of the Koran, Islam's holy book, to 
the Prophet Mohammed some 1,400 years ago. During the holy month, 
Muslims abstain from food, drink, smoking and sex during daylight 
hours as an act of sacrifice and purification. Saudi Arabia, which 
is the home of Islam's holiest shrines in Mecca and Medina, was the 
first Muslim country to announce that Saturday will be the first day 
of Ramadan. Gulf countries generally follow the kingdom's lead. For 
Muslims around the world, Ramadan marks a period of bonding with God 
and the family. Extended families gather at sunset, awaiting the blast 
of a canon or the start of the evening prayer that allows them to 
break their fast.
