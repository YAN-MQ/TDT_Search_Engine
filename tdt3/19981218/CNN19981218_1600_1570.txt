A cardiologist in Connecticut says Santa claus needs to go on a diet. 
To help the Jolly old elf get his weight under control, doctor Jesus 
yap suggests leaving him a plate of vegetables rather than hot chocolate 
and cookies on Christmas eve. He says an overweight Santa sets a bad 
example for kids. Yap fears unless Mr. claus loses some weight, his 
reindeer won't be able to get his sleigh off the ground.
