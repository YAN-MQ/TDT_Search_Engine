Good evening. What a day this has been. House resolution number 611 
resolved that William Jefferson Clinton, president of the United States, 
is impeached. For high crimes and misdemeanors. The House of Representatives 
debates impeachment. There is no doubt that's how it will end. The 
president tries for business as usual, but he must surely wonder what 
his attack against Iraq will mean in the long run, not to mention 
what his own long-term future holds. In Iraq, people have one eye 
on the sky, waiting for the U.S. to bomb again and one eye on the 
bride. The war notwithstanding, for some Iraqis, this was the time 
to get married. This may have been the only one of all these circumstances 
which was not marked by ill will toward someone else. That wedding.
