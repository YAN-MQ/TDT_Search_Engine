Rob Ticktin, "CNN Headline Sports." The news was certainly good in 
Atlanta Friday, as Dan Reeves was released from the hospital just 
four days after undergoing quadruple bypass surgery. Reeves will not 
be on the sidelines for the remainder of the season, but he will coach 
the team in the playoffs. In an emotional press conference, Reeves 
thanked the NFL and its fans for their blessings. I made up my mind 
about three or four months ago that I had these symptoms, but that 
I wasn't gonna mention them and try to be so tough.
