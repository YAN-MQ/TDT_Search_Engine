The US House of Representatives is debating for the first time in 
130 years whether to impeach a president with Bill Clinton accused 
of wrong doing in the Monica Lewinsky affair. During the emotionally 
charged session, the Republican Majority accused Mr. Clinton of betraying 
the people's trust. This is Elton Gallegly of California. This is 
not about sex. It is about the rule of law. It is about lying under 
oath before a federal judge and a federal grand jury. Every citizen 
must obey the law. A society without laws is anarchy. Democrats stressed 
their support for a proposal to censure the President instead of impeaching 
him as in the comments of Barney Frank of Massachusetts. The American 
people also believe censure is appropriate, and let me agree with 
those who say that simply because a large number of the voters believe 
something we are not obligated to vote for it. I welcome this assosion 
that we have an obligation not always to follow public opinion. But 
while we have the right not to vote for something just because there 
is overwhelming public support, in a democracy you have no right not 
to vote on it. Mr. Clinton's chances of averting impeachment appear 
slim. If impeached, he would face trial in the Senate on whether to 
remove him from office. The House is schedule to vote Saturday on 
charges of obstruction of justice, abuse of power, and two counts 
of perjury.
