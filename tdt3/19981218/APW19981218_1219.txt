Refugees fled a second day of fighting on Friday between the army 
and a rogue militia group while automatic weapons fire rattled through 
a neighborhood of Brazzaville. Police fired on looters taking advantage 
of the disorder in the south Brazzaville suburb of BaKongo, and civilians 
fled the area, witnesses said. The capital of this Central African 
country _ on the Atlantic coast and next to its larger neighbor, Congo 
_ was without electricity and telephone services were limited to the 
center of the city. Many people in other parts of the city were taking 
refuge in their homes. Casualties were reported by civilians fleeing 
the area, although the numbers were unclear. Meanwhile, the United 
Nations' refugee agency counted 8,500 emigres who had escaped the 
turmoil in Republic of Congo in recent weeks to border villages near 
the town of Luozi in Congo, the former Zaire, UNHCR spokesman Kris 
Janowski said in Geneva. Other aid groups have estimated that 10,000 
refugees have crossed the river border to Congo. ``The group has adequate 
food at present but is in urgent need of medical assistance,'' Janowski 
said. Several children reportedly died from lack of care after crossing 
into Congo. UNHCR began distributing medical kits to health posts 
in the vicinity and soap to area villages. Food and basic necessities 
will be given to the most vulnerable members of the group. The shooting 
began Wednesday night and continued, off and on, into early Thursday 
when the outlawed ``Ninja'' militia of former Prime Minister Bernard 
Kolelas, who had launched scattered ambushes, were pushed back from 
the suburbs south of Brazzaville, a military officer said Thursday. 
Hundreds of people panicked in downtown Brazzaville, believing the 
Ninjas had launched an all-out attack. Kolelas and his sometime-ally, 
ousted president Pascal Lissouba, fled Republic of Congo after President 
Denis Sassou-Nguesso and his ``Cobra'' militia _ with the help of 
Angolan government troops _ defeated Lissouba in a five-month civil 
war last year. Since then, the Ninjas have resisted disarmament and 
are waging a campaign against Sassou-Nguesso's government. Since his 
takeover, Sassou-Nguesso has outlawed all militia groups including 
the Cobras. Many of his former militia fighters, though, have joined 
the army. Angola turned the tide in Republic of Congo's civil war, 
sending troops to help Sassou-Nguesso defeat Lissouba. Many Angolan 
soldiers stayed in Republic of Congo after the war ended. Angola joined 
the civil war because Lissouba was believed to be sending aid to the 
rebel group UNITA, a Portuguese acronym for the National Union for 
the Total Independence of Angola which has been fighting the Angolan 
government for two decades. The Republic of Congo government has said 
that UNITA is now supporting the Ninjas.
