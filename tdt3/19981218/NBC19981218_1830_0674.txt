This is the season to be Jolly and very spiritual. To have all this 
chaos going on, this is a time of peace and we're in unrest. My daily 
life is what affects me. Not what's going on in Washington. I'm more 
concerned with what's going on in Iraq than what's going on in washington. 
Let the impeachment wait. That can take some time. Do the bombing 
now, get the job done. Get rid of Saddam. Get rid of the problem. 
Then discuss the possible impeachment of the president.
