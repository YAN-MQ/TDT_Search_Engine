Slovenia's parliament on Friday adopted a budget for 1999, which at 
960 billion Slovene tolars (dlrs 4.3 billion), is four percent higher 
than the previous year. The government predicts inflation will be 
about 6 percent and gross domestic product should grow a real 4 percent. 
The budget envisages revenues of 930.3 billion tolars and a deficit 
of 29.7 billion tolars (dlrs 186 million), which the government plans 
to cover by selling shares in some of the state-own properties, like 
the oil company Petrol. This was the first time since 1990, a year 
before the country declared independence from the old Yugoslav federation, 
that the budget was adopted in time. In previous years, the debate 
has been delayed for up to six months, due to internal political quarrels.
