Top stories are two minutes away. Then in "consumer news" -- gifts 
that may spread a little holiday cheer around the office. I will remember 
you will you remember me in December, every minute you talk on AT&T 
will mean an AT&T donation don't let your life to the American red 
cross. The more calls you make, pass you by... the more help we can 
give. And I will remember you this year, why not reach out to everyone 
you love, so we can all reach out to those who need it most. Will 
you remember me for the Energizer doublebarrel flashlight-- unique 
double barrel design that extends battery life combined with a halogen 
xenon bulb, Burns brighter, for longer than any light in its class. 
Energizer doublebarrel. One barrel brighter. One barrel better.
