Well in an attempt to reduce its work force, Saturn will soon offer 
union workers a cash incentive to transfer to other General Motors 
plants. Saturn, a subsidiary of GM is offering the package to its 
workers in its springhill, Tennessee, plant. As many as 600 workers 
are expected to take that offer. The move comes as the automaker tries 
to recover from one of its worst sales slumps since it began manufacturing 
cars back in 1990.
