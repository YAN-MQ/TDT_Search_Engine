British jets have flown three missions against air defenses, airfields 
and Republican Guard installations in Iraq without losing any aircraft, 
Defense Secretary George Robertson said Friday. ``We have yet to complete 
our full battle damage assessment, but initial assessment is that 
the raids have gone very well,'' Robertson said at a press briefing. 
``There is still much to do before we can be satisfied that Saddam's 
capabilities to develop weapons of mass destruction has been damaged 
to the extent necessary,'' he said. ``We will carry on with military 
action along with the U.S. until we are satisfied that Saddam's military 
machine has been suitably damaged.'' Journalists were shown videos 
taken by the attacking Tornados. The targets seen exploding were described 
as a radar missile site, a hardened aircraft shelter at the Tallil 
air base in southwestern Iraq and an aircraft hangar. Robertson said 
one objective of the attacks was to stop Iraq's development of pilotless 
aircraft. Britain's part in the U.S.-led air campaign is begin carried 
out by 12 Tornado GR1 fighter-bombers based in Kuwait. In Kuwait, 
a spokesman for the Royal Air Force, Group Capt. Bryan Collins, told 
reporters that one Tornado had technical difficulties Thursday night 
and returned to base without releasing its bombs. Those difficulties 
``combined with rather heavy anti-aircraft activity in that area limited 
the options that the crew had to try to resolve the situation,'' he 
said. Asked if bombing raids would continue after the start of Ramadan, 
expected within the next several days, Collins said: ``I believe Ramadan 
is of concern to our government.'' Prime Minister Tony Blair, seeking 
to firm up support for the U.S.-British operation, had a round of 
telephone conversations with leaders of several nations. His office 
said they included German Chancellor Gerhard Schroeder, French President 
Jacques Chirac, Italian Prime Minister Massimo D'Alema and Egypt's 
President Hosni Mubarak. Blair's office said he also planned to speak 
to Crown Prince Abdullah, first deputy prime minister of Saudi Arabia. 
Former Prime Minister Sir Edward Heath on Friday criticized the Iraqi 
bombing as having no clear purpose. ``The whole setting of this enterprise 
has been so dubious, especially when the president of the United States 
has his own domestic problems,'' Heath said in an interview with British 
Broadcasting Corp. radio. The military aims, Heath said, ``have not 
been clearly defined at all. If you ask what is the purpose there 
is no answer.''
