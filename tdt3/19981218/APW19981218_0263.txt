A delegation of Russian government officials flew to Iran to discuss 
economic issues and the situation in Iraq, a news report said Friday. 
The group of high-ranking officials from the ministries of finance, 
economics, and foreign affairs left Thursday night and will return 
Dec. 22, the Interfax news agency said. It was led by a foreign policy 
aide to President Boris Yeltsin. The trip ``was planned and continues 
the regular dialogue between Moscow and Tehran,'' Interfax said, citing 
unidentified government sources. The two sides will discuss trade 
and economic cooperation as well as the status of the Caspian Sea. 
Iran is pushing for greater access to what many believe are massive 
oil reserves beneath the central Caspian. Russia and Iran have signed 
a contract worth more than dlrs 500 million to build a nuclear reactor 
in Iran, which both sides insist will only be used for generating 
power. Iran has become a key market for Russian weapons, and trade 
between the two countries reached dlrs 550 million last year, Russian 
leaders have said. Russia and Iran will also hold talks on Iraq, where 
the United States and Great Britain launched airstrikes for a second 
day Friday.
