The reaction to these attacks against Iraq like the attacks themselves 
will come in several waves. We've seen the first blush of anger or 
support, a very sharp reaction from the Russians who say that the 
U.S. is flagrantly viting international law. The big question is when 
the bombing ends, who will have benefited the most? The United States 
or Saddam Hussein? For one cut at that, here's ABC's Sheila MacVicar. 
People who have tried to keep track of Saddam Hussein's weapons tried 
to overthrow him or at least help the Iraqi people, all have serious 
questions about the bombing campaign. Tim trevan is a former member 
of UNSCOM, the U.N. weapons inspection program. There is a very real 
probability that Saddam will simply ride out this wave of attacks 
and come to the conclusion, well, he's got rid of UNSCOM, why should 
he let them back in again? The U.S. will insist that sanctions stay 
in place, but Iraq is increasingly likely to ignore them, relying 
on sanctions busting and smuggling. They believe it's better to go 
it alone. Let's look after ourselves, let's retain our dignity, self-esteem. 
Let's work with our neighbors." Even some of Baghdad's enemies, Iran 
and Syria, have condemned what American bombs are doing to Iraq. It's 
going exactly the wrong way. We're continuing to hurt the Iraqi people 
more and we're enhancing the government and the individual president 
himself even more. American policy isve exaly the opposite. President 
Clinton has promised more financing for Iraqis opposed to Saddam hussein. 
But the leaders of those groups say this bombing will not help because 
it is not part of a coherent, long-term policy. Strikes against Iraq 
in the absence of a comprehensive plan to remove saddam would be counterproductive. 
And we have not seen any plan yet. This isn't going to solve anything. 
It's not going to get rid it's not going to get rid of his weapons. 
It's another step in a long, drawn out game. a game where Saddam Hussein 
may already have calculated the impact of this attack and its aftermath. 
And we may have a clear idea where he is going than the U.S. administration.
