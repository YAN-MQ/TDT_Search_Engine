There have been bitter exchanges in Congress, where representatives 
are debating whether to impeach President Clinton over the Monica 
Lewinsky affair. The president faces charges of perjury, abuse of 
power and obstruction. All expectations are that Bill Clinton will 
become the first president to be impeached by Congress since Andrew 
Johnson 130 years ago. In his opening remarks, Henry Hyde, the chairman 
of the House Judiciary Committee, said the proceedings were about 
the rule of law. It's not a question of sex. Sexual misconduct and 
adultery are private acts and are none of Congress' business. It's 
not even a question of lying about sex. The matter before the House 
is a question of lying under oath. STOFEL: Democrat leader Richard 
Gephardt made a passionate plea for a censure motion. He bitterly 
attacked the timing of the debate while American forces are in action 
in the Gulf. And he said Mr. Clinton's fate should be decided by the 
people. I pray today that you will open up this peoples' house and 
let the peoples' voice come in and let fairness reign. House Democrat 
leader Richard Gephardt. A vote is scheduled for tomorrow morning.
