Meanwhile on the men's tour, Norwegian skier Lasse Kjus has won his 
second consecutive downhill world cup downhill as he beat the favored 
Austrians in Valgardinia, Italy. The victory also lifted Kjus to the 
top of the current overall standings. The Olympic downhill silver 
medallist Kjus defeated Austrian Verna Franz by ninety-one one hundredths 
of a second. Austrian's Hermannater, Hermann Maier placed third 1.1 
seconds back. Now that was a huge improvement for the World Cup Champion 
who had finished an astonishing 36th in last Saturday's downhill at 
Valdesair. Maier said his third place finish Friday is almost like 
a victory.
