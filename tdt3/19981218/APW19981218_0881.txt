The head coach of Russia's soccer team was fired Friday over Russia's 
embarrassing loss to Iceland in European Championship qualifiers in 
October, news reports said. Anatoly Byshovets, who coached the Soviet 
soccer team to a gold medal in the 1988 Olympics, was named as Russia's 
chief coach in July. On Friday, the Russian Soccer Union board voted 
14-0 to dismiss him, the ITAR-Tass news agency reported. His contract 
was to have run until after the 2002 World Cup. He was sacked ``in 
connection with the unsatisfactory performances by (the Russian team) 
in qualifying games for the European Championship,'' the Interfax 
news agency reported, citing the soccer union. Russia suffered a demoralizing 
loss to Iceland in a qualifier for the 2000 European Championship. 
The Russian soccer team has not qualified for the World Cup since 
1990 or any major tournament since the 1992 European Championship. 
No replacement for Byshovets was named. Byshovets was one of the Soviet 
Union's best soccer players in the late 1960s and early 1970s. From 
1963-73 he was a forward for the Dinamo Kiev team. He scored four 
goals in four matches at the 1970 World Cup, and was named the tournament's 
fourth-best forward. Russia's soccer union has been plagued by corruption, 
power struggles and violence in recent years.
