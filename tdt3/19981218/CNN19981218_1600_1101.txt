And the financial woes of women don't seem to be improving. A new 
survey finds that women have more dismal financial prospects than 
previously thought. The American association of retired persons found 
that there are three main reasons women continue to be hampered. They 
put their careers on hold to raise a family, which reduces their earnings, 
they earn 74 cents for every dollar that men earn on average, and 
women live longer so they have to stretch their money farther. As 
a result, the survey finds they are cautious about money and are conservative 
investors and rely too heavily on the advice of financial experts.
