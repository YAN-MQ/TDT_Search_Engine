The body of a prominent Serbian official was found early Friday, just 
hours he was kidnapped, apparently by Kosovo Albanian guerrillas, 
Serb sources reported. The body of Zvonko Bojanic, the district mayor 
of Kosovo Polje, a town just 5 kilometers (3 miles) west of the provincial 
capital Pristina, was found by the province's main east-west road, 
the Serb-run Media Center said. The report did not say who found the 
body but cited the Serb official's family who witnessed Bojanic's 
abduction last night from his home in a nearby village by five masked 
rebels in guerrilla uniform. Although the circumstances of the death 
remained unclear and there was no independent confirmation of the 
report, it came just hours after Kosovo's ethnic Albanian rebels vowed 
revenge for the killing of 36 guerrilla fighters in a border clash 
this weekend. On Thursday, Serb police launched a strong crackdown 
on a suspected rebel-controlled village, reportedly killing two ethnic 
Albanian fighters and capturing 34 in a day-long battle. Serb authorities 
said they raided the village of Glodjane in search of gunmen who slaughtered 
six young Serbs, including four teen-agers, on Monday in a bar in 
Pec, 75 kilometers (45 miles) west of Pristina. Police also sealed 
off a northwestern district of Pec as part of the sweep. An armored 
personnel carrier and police officers wearing flak jackets blocked 
a bridge leading to the Kapesnica district. Police snipers looked 
down from surrounding rooftops. The barroom killings, 5th graf pvs
