Bob Livingston's abrupt withdrawal as speaker-elect has left much 
of washington scrambling to find out about the man who could be the 
next speaker of the house. Few people know much about the former wrestling 
coach from I'll I'm. Not many people even know the name, Dennis Hastert. 
Dennis Hastert's profile is so low that even after six terms in Congress, 
most Americans even many in Washington have no idea who he is. But 
republicans say the former wrestling coach is just who they need to 
rally the team. I didn't reall seek this at all. It just kind of happened. 
We needed to heal the wounds and needed to reach out across the aisle. 
He is no Newt Gingrich revolutionary. And shell-shocked republicans 
say he is also no Bob Livingston. The Gingrich successor who quit 
after acknowledging he'd been unfaithful to his wife. I've been happily 
married nor 26 years. Married to Jean Hastert a middle schoolteacher 
who stays behind in the family's small-town Illinois home when her 
husband leaves every week for washington. Allies say Hastert is a 
fixer who can talk to democrats and hill house republicans now rocked 
with internal strife. The members wanted someone that they know was 
solid, a man of integrity, a Man with no personal problems, but also 
could lead this team. Hastert, for years a trusted republican vote 
counter now poised to seize a Job that places him third in line to 
the presidency. At home in Illinois longtime friends and constituents 
praise the choice. Denny Hastert, go Denny. Hastert's first campaign 
manager says his regular guy qualities will serve him well. Denny 
has a great amount of patience and is able to exercise that by just 
letting people talk it out. Hastert's chief Ally, powerful majority 
whip Tom delay. Within hours of Livingston's announcement delay locked 
up votes for hastert. But confrontation is not in Hastert's game plan. 
His first task will be to get past impeachment, get past scandal, 
and get the house back on track.
