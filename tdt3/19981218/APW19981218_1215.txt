Key developments in the airstrikes against Iraq: ___ _U.S. and British 
warplanes launch a third wave of strikes on Iraqi military installations. 
_Pentagon officials say most missiles are hitting intended targets, 
but that initial damage assessments indicate only a small number of 
the 75 targets attacked have been destroyed or severely damaged. _In 
his first address to the nation, Iraqi President Saddam Hussein says 
Iraq ``will not compromise or kneel in the face of injustice.'' _Iraqi 
General Command issues a statement saying air defense forces have 
shot down 77 cruise missiles since the attacks began. United States 
has fired nearly 300 cruise missiles at Iraq, more than were launched 
in the 1991 Persian Gulf War. _Senior defense official, speaking on 
condition of anonymity, says United States reserves right to attack 
in weeks or months after present strikes end if intelligence indicates 
some key targets intact. _U.S. aircraft drop leaflets over Iraqi forces 
stationed in southern Iraq warning them in Arabic that they will be 
attacked if they mobilize. _Anti-American protests erupt in a half-dozen 
Arab capitals, with many saying the attacks are President Clinton's 
way of squirming out of his sex scandal with Monica Lewinsky. _Palestinian 
authorities move to contain anti-U.S. demonstrations in the West Bank 
and Gaza Strip and shut down media broadcasting pro-Iraqi sentiments.
