Thousands of women have staged a rally in Bangladesh to protest against 
attacks by Islamic extremists. The women say Islam should not tell 
them how to run their lives. From the capital Daka, here's David Shazam. 
DAVID SHAZAM : Speakers at the rally called on the Bangladeshi authorities 
to punish the Islamic students and teachers who attacked women in 
the eastern town of 10 days ago. They're demanding that the government 
stop funding Islamic schools which they say contravene the principle 
of secular education and teach men that it is wrong for Muslim women 
to go out to work. The rally was organized by women's groups and some 
of the non-governmental organizations who've angered the fundamentalists 
by helping millions of poor Bangladeshi women to start small businesses.
