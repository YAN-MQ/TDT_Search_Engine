More homeless people died in San Francisco in the last 12 months than 
in any year since the tracking began, an increase that has alarmed 
and frustrated advocates for the homeless and city health workers. 
The 157 deaths were detailed in the Homeless Death Review, issued 
this week by the San Francisco Department of Public Health and covering 
the period from December 1997 through November 30. Last year's report 
counted 104 deaths. The review, the third such analysis since the 
city took over the annual project from a neighborhood newspaper, is 
compiled from data released by the medical examiner's office. The 
breakdown indicates how deadly life on the streets has become in San 
Francisco, where the mayor's office estimates that 4,000 people are 
homeless on any given night. There are at most 2,000 emergency shelter 
beds. The causes of death range from drowning to asthma, but substance 
abuse is the leading killer. Drug overdoses were responsible in 62 
cases, either from heroin alone or in combination with other drugs. 
Ten died from alcohol-related problems. Seven had heart disease, and 
two died from AIDS. Seven committed suicide, six were murdered, and 
five died after being struck by cars. The average age at time of death 
was 42. Health officials and advocates were reluctant to name specific 
reasons for the increase. Many cited the intense winter, while others 
blamed police sweeps that displaced many homeless from places like 
Golden Gate Park. Housing is scarce, too, according to Marian Pena, 
director of the Department of Public Health's homeless program. ``People 
just can't find housing,'' Ms. Pena said. ``Hundreds of units have 
been lost to fires or to tourism, with a room with no bath renting 
for $600 and more.'' Heroin also played a part. ``We have seen a huge 
increase in the number of heroin-related deaths in the past two years,'' 
Ms. Pena said. ``It has been more pure, cheaper and in some cases 
contaminated.'' OPTIONAL CUT Kandace Bender, Mayor Willie Brown's 
press secretary, said the major role of drugs and alcohol in the deaths 
was something Brown has made efforts to address. ``Over the last three 
years,'' Ms. Bender said, ``the mayor has provided $11 million for 
substance abuse programs and mobile outreach programs. The mayor is 
very concerned about this problem, and continues to work on a continuum 
of care that combines shelter, outreach, counseling, jobs, and transitional 
housing.'' Paul Boden, director of the San Francisco Coalition on 
Homelessness and a participant in the report's creation since its 
inception, said he would like to see city officials find a way to 
better use the information agencies have gathered on the homeless. 
``What's so frustrating,'' Boden said, ``is that for all these folks 
that they are finding dead in the city, there is a lot of information 
available about them. They have been through intake programs, screenings, 
for substance abuse, for housing. All that information is centralized. 
But the information is simply not being used.'' END OPTIONAL CUT In 
a modest attempt at intervention, the public health department last 
year initiated a Death Prevention Program, made up of three health 
care workers and a nurse, an under-funded program that does not even 
have a vehicle for its rounds of the city's poorest areas. The team 
attempts to identify high-risk cases and get individuals into treatment 
quickly. ``We have some resources,'' Ms. Pena said, ``but we don't 
have enough. We need to stop pretending that we do have enough. And 
it's absolutely futile to talk about substance abuse without dealing 
with the housing issue.''
