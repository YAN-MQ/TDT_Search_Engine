Surreal, unreal, mind-blowing: these are words of the '60s, and it's 
no wonder they returned to vogue this week. Not since a tottering 
presidency, a divisive war, assassinations, civic unrest and bitter 
partisanship overloaded the American psyche in 1968 has there been 
a spectacle to match this moment. ``Split-screen America'' we call 
it now. It's not happenstance that split-screen technology also became 
a Hollywood fad in movies like ``The Thomas Crown Affair'' in 1968. 
When society cracks, the mind follows, and artists must concoct new 
forms to keep pace. Yes, we're replaying the tragic late '60s as farce 
_ so far. We have character assassinations instead of real ones, a 
weeklong war instead of a quagmire, presidential lying about touching 
body parts instead of presidential lying about Vietcong body counts. 
But we can't be complacent, yet. The cultural fault lines of the moment 
are those of 30 years ago, and potentially just as explosive. The 
right-wing rage once aimed at long-haired, draft-dodging, sexually 
wanton hippies (a caricature of the left even then) is now aimed at 
Bill Clinton, whose opportunistic, split-the-difference politics is 
closer to the old mainstream GOP than to the '60s left, but who nonetheless 
has become the right's pinata for all it hates about the Vietnam era's 
social and sexual revolutions. Nor has another major fault line of 
the '60s _ race _ disappeared since then. Though Bill Clinton has 
done little more for African-Americans than O.J. Simpson did, his 
support remains near-unanimous in black America. If nothing else, 
this is a measure of how deeply blacks still fear that our legal machinery 
can be stacked in favor of a lynch mob. It's hardly a mindless argument. 
The most rabid Clinton-haters in Congress are white Southerners, led 
by Bob Barr, who has spoken before the racist Council of Conservative 
Citizens. An impeachment trial's jury of 100 senators will be whites 
only. The latest agenda of the media gasbags _ now that they're bored 
drumming up fake suspense about ``wavering Republican moderates'' 
_ is to head off this trial. If a last-minute deal can't save the 
day, we're told, then surely the impeached president will resign to 
spare us ``the ordeal.'' But if we really believe in ``the constitutional 
process'' and the ``rule of law'' they love to lecture us about, we 
cannot short-circuit that process now. For Clinton simply to exit 
after a partisan House impeachment vote defiant of majority opinion 
will smell like a coup. There are too many festering questions on 
all sides to end this crisis with such an abrupt anti-democratic abdication, 
even if followed by a speech by President Gore declaring our long 
national soap opera over. What are the other unspecified illegal ``incidents'' 
that the House Judiciary Committee counsel, David Schippers, painted 
with a McCarthyesque brush during the impeachment hearings? Did Kenneth 
Starr, Paula Jones' lawyers and Linda Tripp conspire to catch the 
president in a perjury trap? Are we really certain that Clinton did 
not bomb Afghanistan, Sudan and Iraq to deflect his political woes? 
(We must be; if he did wag the dog, it's not only a high crime but 
a potentially apocalyptic flaw in our system.) The price we'll pay 
for a slow, deliberate trial to resolve such issues won't be cheap. 
We will learn still more about politicians' sex lives, which will 
prompt long sermons in which the party in hock to the religious right 
rationalizes why lying to one's God and spouse in a marriage oath 
does not constitute ``lying under oath.'' Network stocks will plummet 
as the lucrative Jerry Springer and Oprah are displaced by commercial-free 
Senate sessions. It's even possible, if unlikely, that Congress will 
accomplish less non-impeachment business than it did this year. But 
the alternative is worse. ``It's the Civil War all over again,'' said 
Barr, the congressman, of our current national polarization _ and 
surely his ideological opposites would agree. There's no way to call 
off this war by fiat now _ any more than the clash over Vietnam was 
silenced by the Gulf of Tonkin resolution _ because the poisons loose 
in the body politic are rising and raging too bitterly in every camp. 
A real trial is the only way out, for if we learned anything from 
the '60s it is this: Should our civic institutions fail to adjudicate 
and purge deep national divisions in a fair, legal and completely 
open manner, Americans may be tempted instead to fight them out in 
the streets.
