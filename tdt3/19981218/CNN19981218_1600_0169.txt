House democrats are appealing to republican leaders to allow a vote 
on censure as an alternative to impeachment. They say the republicans' 
refusal to allow that is an example of raw, partisan politics. House 
minority leader Dick Gephardt says the vote is a matter of fairness. 
We all say that this is a vote of conscience. You get to vote your 
vote of conscience and I respect that right. All we're asking for 
is that we get to vote our conscience. House republicans say a censure 
vote would be a fraud and an assault on the constitution. Judiciary 
committee chairman Henry Hyde says democrats are not taking the process 
seriously. They propose novel remedies like a congressional censure 
that may appease some constituents and certainly mollify the press. 
But in my judgment, betray a lack of seriousness about the constitution, 
the separation of powers, and the carefully balanced relationship 
of checks and balances between Congress and the president that was 
wisely crafted by the framers. A resolution of censure, to mean anything, 
must punish, if only to tarnish his reputation. But we have no authority 
under the constitution to punish the president. It's called separation 
of powers.
