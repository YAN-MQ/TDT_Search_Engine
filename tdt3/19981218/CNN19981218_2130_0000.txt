justice. Today, this body is contemplating a constitutional assassination. 
A bitter partisan divide as the impeachment of President Clinton appears

and cruise missiles. "CNN Headline News." I'm Lynne Russell. Good 
evening. Impeachment and airstrikes dramas on two continents have 
dominated the day's events. In Baghdad, day three of operation desert 
fox is under way with a Vengeance. Cruise missiles shattered the silence
