The New York Jets, the Atlanta Falcons, the Jacksonville Jaguars, 
and the Dallas Cowboys can clinch division titles as week 16 gets 
underway in the National Football League. The Jets have not won a 
division title in 28 years, however, a win over the Buffalo Bills 
Saturday could give New York the AFC East title. Jets quarterback 
Vinny Testaverde says his teammates know how important Saturday's 
game is. This is by far the most important game that I think all of 
us in this locker room has been a part of is to possibly win a division 
championship here.
