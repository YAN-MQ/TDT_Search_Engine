Turning now to Iraq, where the country is bracing for the third wave 
of "Operation desert fox." It's midnight, local time, little after 
midnight, and Baghdad as you see is quiet. Those were the sirens earlier, 
these are not live pictures. These are the sirens earlier. We've later 
been informed that the all-clear has been sounded. In any event, officials 
say some attack planes have returned from their bombing runs but there's 
no word on their target. Earlier today, Saddam Hussein urged his team 
to continue their resistance. U.S. commanders say there's been a complete 
lack of military response to the thunderous allied attacks. Missiles 
destroyed a military barracks and an intelligence center, among other 
targets. Officials say one missile went astray and struck a residential 
and commercial district. The Pentagon officials claim 75 different 
sites have been targeted so far in the campaign, with varying levels 
of success. Although I'm not getting into specifics types of numbers 
cruise missiles launched today, I can tell you that the total number 
of air launched and ship launched cruise missile of this operation 
thus far now exceed the total number expanded during all of "operation 
desert storm."
