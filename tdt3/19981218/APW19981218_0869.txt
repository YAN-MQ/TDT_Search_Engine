A man accused of shooting an East German border guard while rescuing 
his family from communist East Germany in 1962 refused to testify 
at his trial Friday because he has lost faith in the justice system, 
his lawyer said. Rudolf Mueller, 67, is charged with murder in the 
shooting of a 20-year-old Reinhold Huhn just before his family's daring 
escape through a tunnel under the Berlin Wall. At the second session 
of his trial, which began Monday, Mueller's lawyer said his client 
would refuse comment because mitigating circumstances, including the 
political situation and the fact that East German guards had shoot-to-kill 
orders, were not being considered by the court. Mueller had fled to 
West Berlin shortly before the Wall was built in 1961, then dug a 
tunnel under it as part of his plan to go back and bring his family 
out. According to documents read in court, Mueller admitted during 
pretrial questioning by prosecutors that he shot Huhn once after Huhn 
raised his weapon and ordered him to stop. Mueller, his wife, two 
sons and sister-in-law then escaped through the 22-meter (72 foot) 
tunnel. After reaching the West, Mueller turned in his weapon. He 
also claimed that western intelligence agents hinted to him it would 
be wise to keep quiet about the shooting, according to the documents. 
West Berlin officials maintained at the time that Huhn had been shot 
by a fellow East German guard trying to prevent the June 18, 1962, 
escape. They refused to turn Mueller over to East Germany, which wanted 
to try him for murder. But Berlin prosecutors reopened the case after 
unification in 1990, based on new evidence unearthed in East German 
secret police files. Mueller's case has attracted wide attention as 
the first Westerner to be tried since unification for killing an East 
German border guard during an escape. Hundreds of former East German 
border guards and officials have been convicted on charges related 
to shooting those trying to flee to the West. Nearly 1,000 people 
were killed trying to cross into West Germany, according to the latest 
official count. Mueller is free on 100,000 marks (dlrs 60,000) bail. 
The trial continues Wednesday.
