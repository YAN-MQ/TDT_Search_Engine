Pope John Paul II has come down with the flu at the start of the busy 
Christmas season and canceled his audiences Friday, the Vatican said. 
The Vatican described the pontiff's illness as a mild case of influenza. 
The illness struck the frail 78-year-old pope at the start of the 
busy holiday period, when he has made few concessions for his age 
and health. The pope is scheduled to celebrate midnight Mass Christmas 
eve and deliver his annual holiday message on Christmas day. Other 
appointments include a scheduled meeting with school children and 
their families Sunday to bless Nativity scenes and an annual address 
Tuesday to the College of Cardinals on the state of the church. In 
the only change in recent years, he no longer celebrates a public 
Mass Christmas Day. Otherwise, although weakened by a long list of 
ailments, the pope has kept up a crowded schedule and his foreign 
travels. His next planned trip is to Mexico and St. Louis, Missouri, 
Jan. 22-28.
