Mr. Clinton stands to be the only president other than Andrew Johnson 
in 1868 to be impeached. Whatever a Burden it is to him and to Mrs. 
Clinton, today the White House has certainly been wearing a brave 
face. ABC's Sam Donaldson is there tonight. sam? Peter, it's really 
strange here today, the house moves toward taking this grave step 
and the man they're moving against wants it known he really isn't 
paying attention, feels just fine, thank you, as he goes about his 
business as usual. It is both amazing and a little hard to believe. 
At noon, the president met with the chancellor of Austria and the 
president of the European commission. They found him smiling and upbeat 
as they gave him a sample of the new Euro dollar. Later in the day, 
the president attended White House meetings with his budget team and 
AIDS commission. Press secretary Joe Lockhart knew he would have to 
explain this remarkably upbeat presidential mood. So, I asked him 
to account for it, the fact that it was very good. And he told me 
for one thing, he got seven hours of sleep last night. Lockhart tried 
his hand at criticizing republicans who have called for the president's 
resignation, saying they were pursuing a cynical strategy to remove 
the president but that didn't seem to get anywhere. And in a radio 
interview, vice President Gore raised his voice on behalf of the president. 
I am fighting mad about the way they are carrying out this impeachment 
matter. Like her husband, Mrs. Clinton also went about normal business 
today, attending a photo opportunity to warn about the perils of drunk 
driving. And about her husband? I think the vast majority of Americans 
share my approval and pride in the job that the president's been doing 
for our country. This strange disconnect seen here today probably 
stems from the fact that people here agree that the battle in the 
house is lost. So, what's next? Officials insist the president will 
not resign, although they understand there will be more and more calls 
for his resignation. They say he will fight vigorously to defend himself 
in the Senate, still, peter, their best hope is to be able to cut 
a deal on censure soon. The idea that the Senate could never convict 
is an idea that no longer can be taken for granted. Very interesting 
point you make, Sam. In a moment -- we'll get some insight on the 
day and the mood from our political analysts.
