Recapping the impeachment debate in the house -- much of the discussion 
so far has centered around the timing of the proceedings. Democrats 
want a delay because of the Iraqi situation. Republicans say now is 
the right time to go forward. There will be more debate throughout 
the day. A vote is likely tomorrow, as for the president's schedule, 
he met with house republican Christopher Shays earlier today to talk 
about impeachment. The president was also meeting with Austria's chancellor 
and other European union leaders. Later, the president will meet with 
an HIV/AIDS council.
