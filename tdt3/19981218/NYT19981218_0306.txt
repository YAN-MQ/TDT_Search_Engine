Leonard Moos Rieser, a physicist who helped usher in the nuclear age 
with the Manhattan Project and crusaded to curb the arsenals it spawned, 
died on Tuesday at the Dartmouth-Hitchcock Medical Center in Lebanon, 
N.H. He was 76 and lived in Norwich, Vt. The cause was cancer, said 
officials at Dartmouth College, where he was a professor and administrator 
for 46 years. Rieser (pronounced REE-zer) helped steer Dartmouth through 
a period of considerable growth. He was nationally known as president 
and chairman of the American Association for the Advancement of Science 
in the 1970s, and was chairman of the Bulletin of the Atomic Scientists 
from 1985 until his retirement in June. He joined the Dartmouth faculty 
in 1952, was appointed professor of physics in 1960 and retired in 
1992. After his retirement, he remained with Dartmouth as a senior 
fellow of the John Sloan Dickey Center for International Understanding, 
which he had served as founding director, beginning in 1984. Rieser's 
administrative service spanned 25 years, during which he was chairman 
of the physics department, deputy provost for the sciences, dean of 
the faculty and provost. A native of Chicago, Leonard Rieser graduated 
with a degree in physics from the University of Chicago in 1943, and 
was then posted by the Army to the Manhattan Project, which produced 
the first nuclear chain reaction in 1942 and ultimately developed 
the atomic bomb. He worked at the Manhattan Project's metallurgical 
laboratory in Chicago and at the Los Alamos Laboratory in New Mexico, 
where he witnessed the first atomic explosion. After the war he worked 
as a researcher for the physicist Otto Frisch at Los Alamos, and received 
his doctorate in physics from Stanford University in 1952. As chairman 
of the Bulletin of the Atomic Sciences, Rieser was seen in many news 
photographs resetting the publication's ``Doomsday Clock'' to dramatize 
the threat of nuclear annihilation and the need for peaceful alternatives 
to nuclear conflict. He did so one more time in June in response to 
the test explosions set off by India and Pakistan, advancing the clock 
by five minutes to 11:51 p.m. and warning of ``perilous times.'' Rieser 
is survived by his wife of 54 years, Rosemary Littledale Rieser; a 
daughter, Abigail, of Northampton, Mass.; three sons, Leonard, of 
Philadelphia, Timothy S., of Washington, and Kenneth Willis of Princeton, 
N.J.; two brothers, Lawrence, of Jackson, Wyo., and William, of Perkasie, 
Pa., and three granddaughters.
