Ramadan, the holy month of dawn-to-dusk fasting in the Islamic calendar, 
begins this weekend for Muslims around the world. Its start depends 
on the sighting of the new crescent moon. Because the U.S.-led attacks 
on Iraq have taken place just before the holy month, some Muslims 
have been particularly incensed. Though President Clinton said on 
Wednesday when the attacks began that ``to initiate military action 
during Ramadan would be profoundly offensive to the Muslim world,'' 
Washington has suggested that the attacks may continue into Ramadan. 
For the next 30 days, Muslims are enjoined from eating, drinking and 
sensual pleasures like sexual activity, during daylight hours. On 
a spiritual level, the ritual fast is a sacrificial act that points 
to purification and renewal. It is accompanied by close study of the 
Koran, the Islamic holy book, which the faith teaches was revealed 
by God to the prophet Mohammed during the last days of Ramadan. Observance 
of the fast is one of Islam's Five Pillars, the foundational rules 
of the faith. The daily abstention from food is broken after sundown 
with an evening meal. In Saudi Arabia, officials announced the sighting 
of the new moon on Friday night, signaling that observance of Ramadan 
would begin there on Saturday. According to news reports, the lunar 
month will also begin Saturday in Iraq, the United Arab Emirates, 
Kuwait, Bahrain and Qatar. But Egypt and the south Arabian nation 
of Oman will begin observance of Ramadan on Sunday.
