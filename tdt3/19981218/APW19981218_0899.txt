British tycoon Richard Branson, Chicago millionaire Steve Fossett 
and teammate Per Lindstrand sailed aloft Friday looking to guide their 
200-foot-high (61-meter) balloon on a landmark round-the-world voyage. 
Good weather, a good wind and a cloudless sky augured well for the 
travelers in their quest to become the first to circle the globe in 
a balloon. Some seven hours after liftoff at a Moroccan airforce base, 
the 12-ton ICO Global Challenge was cruising at 29,000 feet (8,840 
meters) over the Atlas mountains, according to Jackie McQuillan, spokeswoman 
for ICO Global, a mobile telephone company supporting the trip. ``They 
are very happy with how it's going so far, and nothing has happened 
to make them think it won't be a successful flight,'' she said. The 
balloon was expected to cross into eastern Algeria sometime before 
dawn Saturday, she said. Some 500 people, including Moroccan musicians 
and Berber horsemen, gathered for the 0922 GMT liftoff, which went 
without a hitch after a two-hour delay. ``The tricky part is getting 
through the first 24 hours,'' Branson said shortly before liftoff. 
``After that we can start to relax and enjoy the flight.'' Branson 
and his colleagues, all wearing silver jumpsuits, expressed confidence 
in the trip, estimating it could last from eight days to nearly three 
weeks. The U.S. missile strike on Iraq has complicated the task, Branson 
said. ``This flight around the world would have taken 9 and a half 
days, but for the Iraqi problem,'' Branson told reporters. ``Now, 
we will be happy to complete the voyage in 10-20 days.'' The missile 
strike means the team will have to find the winds to take them north 
of Iraq through Turkey instead of cutting over Saudi Arabia. The team 
secured permission from 97 countries for overflights and had only 
four refusals -- Iran, Iraq, Russia and North Korea. Fossett has made 
four tries to ring the globe, the last one ending when his Solo Spirit 
was ripped apart in a violent storm off Australia. ``I am nervous 
at the launch of all balloon flights,'' Fossett said ahead of the 
liftoff. ``Once we get to altitude and we know what our problems are, 
if any, then it will be very relaxed.'' Branson has tried, and failed, 
four times to become the first person to trek the globe in a balloon. 
The only time he managed to take off, in January 1997, his balloon 
crashed a day after takeoff, landing in the Algerian desert. ICO Global 
spokesman Mike Johnson said the crew was more confident this time 
because of the better technology used to build the balloon, including 
a Kevlar canopy over the crew's pressurized capsule. Kevlar is used 
for bulletproof vests. At least three other balloon crews have been 
waiting for favorable weather to launch their balloon -- from Albuquerque, 
New Mexico, Loves Park, Illinois and the Swiss Alps. Yet another team 
is to take off next month from Alice Springs, Australia.
