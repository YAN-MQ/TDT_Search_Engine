Also in the NFL, Atlanta Falcons' coach Dan Reeves has been released 
from a hospital just a few days after undergoing quadruple heart bypass 
surgery. Reeves choked back tears as he spoke of the strength of his 
family and all the support he received from fans and the NFL community. 
Reeves said he had shortness of breath and a burning in his throat 
for months but did not to distract the Falcons team. Three arteries 
to Reeves' heart were blocked. He called his doctors after suffering 
more symptoms after last Sunday's game against New Orleans. Reeves 
checked into an Atlanta hospital Monday morning and underwent the 
surgery. Now the Falcons coach says he will modify his behavior unless 
the game gets tight. I still have to be myself and I will be good 
until the first bad call. And then I will go crazy again. The players 
understand that. The Falcons have the third best record in the NFL 
this year with 12 wins and 2 loses and they will not have Reeves on 
the sidelines when they meet Detroit on Sunday.
