Choosing the right gift to give your colleagues can be hard enough 
on its own. Add office politics and political correctness into the 
mix, and you just might feel like saying "bah, humbug" to the whole 
deal. In this edition of "working ahead," Carolyn O'Neil offers some 
sensible solutions. Who can say no to a holiday basket of gourmet 
goodies? And that's exactly the point. A gift of food can please the 
palate and office politics today. Gourmet food gifts are becoming 
more popular as a way to say thank you to a Client or a boss, because 
many companies do not allow employees to accept expensive leather 
goods, silver, jewelry or other valuables. It's all across the board. 
Some companies, gifts, they're allowed gifts up to $200 a year. Others, 
they cannot accept any gifts. Another reason food gifts are fine is 
that an elaborate cake or tin of imported cookies can feed a crowd. 
Also, even though it might be as expensive as something a little more 
showy, it doesn't look that way. Because if there were any questions, 
you could say, "we just share that with our department." And with 
many food gifts available through mail order catalogs, such as top 
quality, beautifully packaged fruit and baskets filled with edible 
goodies, business travelers can get their shopping done anywhere there's 
a phone, and the spirit of Christmas. Carolyn O'Neil, CNN, Atlanta.
