KUALA LUMPUR, Malaysia (AP) - Malaysia's exports for the first ten 
months of this year amount to 236.91 billion ringgit (dlrs 59.23 billion), 
exceeding the value of exports for all of 1997, state-run media said 
Friday. Exports last year totaled 220.89 billion ringgit (dlrs 55.22 
billion). Minister of International Trade and Industry Rafidah Aziz 
said the jump in exports came despite the negative impact on the Southeast 
Asian nation's manufacturers from the regional financial crisis, Bernama 
news agency said. Strong export growth has helped turn around Malaysia's 
trade balance numbers, allowing it to post a 44.53 billion ringgit 
(dlrs 11.13 billion) surplus for the first ten months of this year, 
the report said. That compares to a 45 million ringgit (dlrs 11 million) 
deficit for all of 1997, it said.
