Israel's refusal to meet a peace process deadline on Friday was ``dangerous'' 
and could freeze the peace, the Palestinian Cabinet said. Israel was 
to handed over a further 5 percent of the West Bank to Palestinian 
control by Friday, according to the accords brokered by U.S. President 
Bill Clinton at Wye River, Maryland in October. Prime Minister Benjamin 
Netanyahu said Wednesday he would miss the deadline until he sees 
solid evidence that the Palestinians are meeting their conditions. 
``We have fulfilled our commitments,'' top Palestinian negotiator 
said after the Cabinet meeting. ``The Israeli government has not.'' 
Aside from returning territory, Erekat said, Israel has failed to 
open a safe passage between the Gaza Strip and the West Bank, has 
not moved to improve economic conditions, and has not released prisoners. 
``We see this behavior as dangerous,'' Erekat said. Prime Minister 
Benjamin Netanyahu this week accused the Palestinians of failing to 
contain anti-Israel violence and incitement. Netanyahu, who has staked 
the survival of his government on his peace policies in a vote next 
week in parliament, said he wanted to see solid proof the violence 
was ended before he withdrew. ``Netanyahu's declarations mean the 
stopping of the peace process,'' Erekat said. Palestinian leader Yasser 
Arafat had expressed his concern to the current leaders of the European 
Union, Erekat said, and would send similar letters to Netanyahu and 
Clinton. There were signs Friday that the Palestinians were moving 
to meet Netanyahu's demands. In the West Bank town of Nablus, protesters 
against U.S. and British airstrikes in Iraq tried to march toward 
Israeli outposts to confront soldiers. Palestinian police quickly 
moved to contain them. An expected outbreak of protests against Israel's 
refusal to withdraw had been anticipated, but were overwhelmed by 
the events in Iraq and subsequent protests in Palestinian areas. The 
Palestinian Authority has not condemned the bombing, anxious to cultivate 
a growing friendliness with the United States that blossomed during 
Clinton's visit to the region this week. Erekat said that Arafat ordered 
an envoy to Iraq to seek ways to resolve the crisis.
