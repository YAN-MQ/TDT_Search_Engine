More than 100 U.N. relief workers left Baghdad early Friday after 
two nights of bombing raids made their situation precarious, officials 
said here. An announcement from the office of the Iraqi program that 
oversees all nondisarmament work said 106 people had gone by road 
to Jordan, leaving behind fewer than 30 essential officials, including 
Prakash Shah, the secretary- general's special envoy, and Hans von 
Sponeck, the relief aid coordinator. An additional 232 foreign relief 
workers will remain in the autonomous Kurdish areas of northern Iraq, 
where they are considered relatively safe. The announcement Friday 
also said that oil exports were continuing uninterrupted through the 
port of Mina al Bakr, but that the absence of border inspectors checking 
goods purchased through the ``oil for food'' program would mean interruptions 
in incoming deliveries. The border inspectors, who work for the private 
British customs service, Lloyds Register of Shipping, were withdrawn 
from most crossing points and the port of Umm Qasr on Wednesday, before 
the bombing began.
