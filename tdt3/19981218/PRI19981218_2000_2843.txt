Coming up, looking in from the outside. What it's like for Americans 
to watch current events in the United States from miles away and what 
they make of them. That story and much more is still ahead on PRI, 
Public Radio International. The World is made possible in part by 
Merck, a research driven pharmaceutical company discovering, developing 
and manufacturing a broad range of human and animal health products 
and services. Merck, committed to bringing out the best in medicine.

the world for individuals and institutions. This is the World. I'm 
Lisa Mullins.
