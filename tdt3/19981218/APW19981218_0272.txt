About 1,200 Indonesian students on Friday staged anti-government rallies 
as troops blocked roads near the presidential palace and other strategic 
sites in the wake of a clash between protesters and security officers. 
Extra police were also deployed near the U.S. Embassy amid fears of 
demonstrations in the predominantly Muslim Southeast Asian country 
against the U.S. missile strikes on Iraq. Twenty activists from an 
Islamic student group rallied against the bombing outside the Jakarta 
headquarters of the United Nations. Separately, several hundred students 
marched from a campus of the state-run University of Indonesia toward 
Parliament. They chanted anti-military slogans and some carried bamboo 
staves. Other groups of pro-democracy protesters drove through the 
city in buses and gathered at a park and a main intersection. On Thursday, 
at least 4,000 students singing ``revolution until we die'' attempted 
to storm the Parliament building. Hundreds were injured when police 
and soldiers stopped them with plastic bullets, batons and tear gas. 
The huge street battle came just hours after Indonesian President 
B.J. Habibie warned that the protests could lead to the breakup of 
the sprawling nation, the world's fourth most populous country. On 
Friday, Habibie repeated his warning and urged Indonesians to exercise 
restraint. ``We still see many cruel actions,'' the official Antara 
news agency quoted him as saying at the state palace. ``We still see 
how differences in opinion could lead to conflict involving the masses.'' 
Indonesia is grappling with its worst economic turmoil in decades 
and has been plagued by political uncertainty as well. Habibie took 
over in May from authoritarian President Suharto, who was dislodged 
by riots and protests against his 32-year rule. Yet students have 
kept up their protests since Suharto's ouster, demanding that Habibie 
force the powerful military out of politics and put his predecessor 
and onetime mentor on trial for corruption. Nine students were killed 
Nov. 13 in clashes with security forces during a government assembly 
that met to plan an overhaul of Suharto's rigid political system. 
Students said the reforms did not go far enough. Habibie has allowed 
political parties to form and has scheduled Parliamentary elections 
next year. He also has ordered an investigation into Suharto's wealth.
