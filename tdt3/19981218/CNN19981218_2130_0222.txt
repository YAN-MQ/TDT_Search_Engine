Tempers have flared over the timing of the impeachment debate. Democrats 
had wanted to delay it while U.S. troops are in the Persian gulf. 
Republicans argue the house must live up to its constitutional duty 
now. Not once did I ever worry about what was going on in Congress. 
I worried about the strike mission, about where the sams were, where 
the triple a was, about getting back to my carrier alive. They don't 
care what's going on here. They want this over too. That's not a factor 
in this. We are sending the ultimate mixed message to Saddam about 
our national resolve. We may be encouraging him to resist longer by 
our actions in the midst of war. Starting this proceeding today may 
wind up costing American lives. The majority may well have blood on 
its hands by starting this proceeding today.
