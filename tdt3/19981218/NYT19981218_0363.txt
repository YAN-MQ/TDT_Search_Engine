Mindful as ever of his standing in history, President Clinton is said 
by associates to feel devastated about a scar he now regards as inevitable: 
a vote to impeach him Saturday in the House of Representatives. But 
at the same time, aides and friends of Clinton say, America's most 
tested political fighter has steeled himself for the battle of his 
life, believing that his opponents are acting not out of constitutional 
duty but partisan rage. Friday, his tried but enduring ally, Hillary 
Rodham Clinton, again rallied to his side, breaking weeks of silence 
about his predicament. The president is negotiating to bring in new 
lawyers to represent him during a Senate trial, associates said, even 
as he bears down, as he did again Friday, on the budget priorities 
and other legislative goals that he believes will sustain his public 
support. ``My goodness, how do you think he is?'' expostulated one 
adviser to Clinton on Friday. ``This guy reads history books on every 
president. He can cite you details about every president. So on the 
one hand he's devastated about what this will do and has done for 
his legacy. But on the other hand, he looks at how it's being done 
as pure politics.'' And politics is something that Bill and Hillary 
Rodham Clinton understand. ``I think the vast majority of Americans 
share my approval and pride in the job that the president's been doing 
for our country,'' Mrs. Clinton said, in an extremely rare response 
Friday morning to a reporter's question. She spoke on the South Portico 
of the White House, with the Capitol dome in the distance. Mrs. Clinton 
made a plea to ``end divisiveness'' during the holiday season, and 
turn attention to ``people who need help and support.'' ``There are 
still, you know, abused and neglected foster children that are not 
getting well taken care of,'' she said. ``There are still people with 
health care problems who need tending to.'' But while the first lady 
appealed for unity, elsewhere at the White House, aides took up their 
cudgels. Anticipating calls for Clinton's resignation, press secretary 
Joe Lockhart accused Republicans of a ``cynical, political strategy,'' 
to downplay impeachment for weeks, and then argue now that it should 
prompt Clinton's resignation. He accused the Republicans of ``not 
being straight with the American public.'' Lockhart, a more pugnacious 
and sharper-tongued spokesman than his predecessor, Mike McCurry, 
came to his daily briefing Friday armed with a stack of quotations 
from Republican congressmen to illustrate his point. At his right, 
Lockhart's deputies sat beneath an advertisement torn from the newspaper 
and stuck with silver duct tape to the wall: ``Forgive or Condemn?'' 
it read. ``Let him who is without sin cast the first vote.'' On a 
crisp, clear wintry day, a sense less of history than of historic 
wrong, and of grievance, settled over the White House. Furious aides 
ridiculed congressional Republicans as bent only on Clinton's destruction. 
``I was wrong for 11 months,'' said Paul Begala, Clinton's counselor. 
``For 11 months I said this was all about sex, and I was wrong. It 
is all about power, and politics and partisanship.''
