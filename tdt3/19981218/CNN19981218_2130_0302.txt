Now, an update on the situation of Iraq. The U.S. launched a third 
round of air strikes be, the latest bombing occurred about 5:00 A.M. 
local time. Powerful explosions could be heard throughout the city. 
U.S. military officials say the attacks will continue until the objectives 
of "operation desert fox" have been achieved. There is no fixed end 
time we intend. We have set very specific targets that we intend to 
attack. When those missions are completed, then the mission will end. 
But until that occurs, we have to keep some flexibility. We may have 
to go back and restrike some targets. So we have no artificial cut-off.
