US and British Forces are attacking Iraq from the air for a third 
consecutive night. Officials say the assault by bombers and cruise 
missiles will continue until Iraq's ability to make and use weapons 
of mass destruction is sharply reduced. Military reports indicate 
the last two nights of air strikes caused substantial damage to Iraqi 
military bases and communications facilities. America's top military 
officer General Hugh Shelton outlined Thursday's effort. There were 
more than 200 strike and strike support sorties flown last night including 
the first combat operations of the B-1 Bomber. Most of you saw some 
large explosions around Baghdad yesterday and many of you correctly 
surmised that those were caused by air launched cruise missiles launched 
from B-52 aircraft. Navy ships also launched additional Tomahawk missiles 
at targets in Iraq. But US Defense Officials acknowledge not all the 
hundreds of sophisticated weapons reached their intended destinations 
and some targets were only slightly damaged or not damaged at all. 
In spite of the ongoing bombardment, Iraqi President Saddam Hussein 
says he will not compromise.
