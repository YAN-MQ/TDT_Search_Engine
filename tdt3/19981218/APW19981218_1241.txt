Reiterating that he has no intention of resigning now, chief U.N. 
weapons inspector Richard Butler said Friday he would quit if he concluded 
that Iraq had been disarmed and economic sanctions against Baghdad 
were not immediately lifted. Butler's comment was an indirect challenge 
to the United States, which refuses to acknowledge a Security Council 
resolution promising to lift sanctions when inspectors certify that 
Baghdad's weapons of mass destruction have been destroyed. ``Some 
people express doubt about whether that promise would be kept. I have 
no doubt of that,'' Butler said in a speech to the Women's International 
Forum. ``I passionately believe in that promise. And were it not to 
be kept then that would be ... resignation material.'' In terms of 
future carrots or incentives to Iraq, Butler said, ``it needs to be 
made unambiguously clear to Iraq that the law means what it says and 
when the disarmament process is declared by me and the director-general 
of the International Atomic Energy Agency to be over ... sanctions 
lifting will follow.'' The Security Council, which is badly divided 
over the airstrikes, held consultations for a third day Friday but 
took no action. The council agreed to meet again Monday morning. All 
Security Council members except the United States back Butler's view 
that the oil embargo and other economic sanctions must be lifted when 
Butler declares that Iraq is disarmed. But the Clinton administration 
is demanding not only Iraq's disarmament but its compliance with other 
resolutions calling for an accounting of missing Kuwaitis, looted 
Kuwaiti property and government archives. Deputy U.S. Ambassador Peter 
Burleigh refused to answer a question Friday on whether the United 
States might change its policy to prevent Butler's resignation if 
Iraq is disarmed. But responding to Russian calls for Butler's resignation 
and strong criticism from China, Burleigh said it was ``very regrettable 
that political attack is now seeming to focus on Ambassador Butler'' 
and the U.N. Special Commission, known as UNSCOM, which he heads. 
``We don't want Ambassador Butler to resign. We think he's been a 
very effective, professional executive chairman of the Special Commission 
under the most extraordinarily difficult situation,'' Burleigh said. 
``I think frankly that they have done a brilliant job and I think 
the UNSCOM people are heroes.'' In the past month, UNSCOM has tested 
the promise Iraq made on Nov. 14, under threat of U.S. and British 
airstrikes, to resume full cooperation with UNSCOM. Butler's report 
to U.N. Secretary-General Kofi Annan on Tuesday concluded Iraq had 
fallen short of compliance. Butler said Friday that if Iraq had handed 
over only one document on its production of deadly VX nerve agent, 
it would have made a big difference. ``It would have been such a good 
step on a really important matter, a clear signal that would have 
made it far easier for me to report to the secretary-general that 
they were in full cooperation,'' Butler said. Russia, which along 
with China has bitterly condemned the United States and Britain for 
using force without council approval, has circulated a nonbinding 
draft statement calling for an immediate cessation of hostilities 
and expressing regret at the attack. Given the divisions on the council, 
the Russian draft has no chance of being approved, but council members 
said it will serve as the basis for discussion on how to move forward 
in dealing with Iraq.
