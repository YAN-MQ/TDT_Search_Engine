Dave Williams, who coached the University of Houston golf team to 
16 NCAA championships and sent a host of players to the PGA Tour, 
died Wednesday in Wharton, Texas. He was 80 and had been ill for several 
years, the university's sports information department said. Houston 
was the dominant college in golf during Williams' 36-year tenure. 
In addition to the 16 national championships, the Cougars won 14 conference 
championships and 340 tournaments under Williams. Seven of Williams' 
golfers won NCAA individual championships, and 41 of his golfers were 
all-America selections. Some of the world's best golfers were coached 
by Williams in college, including Fred Couples, the 1992 Masters champion; 
Steve Elkington, the 1995 PGA Championship winner; John Mahaffey, 
the 1978 PGA champion, Bill Rogers, the 1981 British Open champion, 
and Fuzzy Zoeller, who won the 1979 Masters and the 1984 U.S. Open. 
Others coached by Williams who became winners on the PGA Tour include 
Billy Ray Brown, Keith Fergus, Bruce Lietzke, Ed Fiori, Homero Blancas 
and Kermit Zarley. In 1988, the Golf Coaches Association of America 
named its collegiate coach of the year award in honor of Williams. 
He retired in 1987. ``When he was recruiting me, Coach Williams called 
me in Australia every Saturday for one year,'' Elkington said. ``He 
convinced me to leave Australia when I was 18 years old, and I owe 
my start in America to him. Nobody else was recruiting me at that 
time, and he convinced my mother that he'd take care of me, even though 
I'd be thousands of miles away from home. That's the kind of influence 
he had on people.'' Regarded by many as the father of college golf, 
Williams had a far-reaching impact on the game. Before 1955, teams 
competed against each other in dual matches using match-play format. 
But in the 1955 All-America Intercollegiate Invitational, Williams 
thought it was more logical and economical to play several opponents 
at once, using stroke play in a tournament format. That scoring method 
eventually became standard for college golf, and it was Williams who 
also started the practice of outfitting teams with uniforms. After 
serving in the Navy during World War II and reaching the rank of lieutenant, 
Williams joined Houston's engineering faculty in 1946. He became the 
university's golf coach in 1952 at the urging of his friend Harry 
Fouke, who was the school's athletic director. In 1956, Houston won 
the first of five consecutive national championships. Many of Williams' 
players never saw him swing a club. He was not a great player, and 
he never pretended to be an authority on technique. Yet, his players 
swore by his methods. Williams is survived by his wife, Virginia; 
a son, Joel; a daughter, Peggy, and four grandchildren.
