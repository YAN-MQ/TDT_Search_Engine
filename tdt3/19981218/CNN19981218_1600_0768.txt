For the Energizer doublebarrel flashlight-- unique double barrel design 
that extends battery life combined with a halogen xenon bulb, Burns 
brighter, for longer than any light in its class. Energizer doublebarrel. 
One barrel brighter. One barrel better. Wooo! I actually got in. You 
broke into personnel! Yeah, these are salaries of every person in 
the company. Look, this senior vp makes about half as much as this 
senior vp. Bet he doesn't know that. Sure he does. I just E-mailed 
everbody in the company.
