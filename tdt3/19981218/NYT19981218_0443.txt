The New York Times said in an editorial on Saturday, Dec. 19: It is 
hard to escape the questions _ ``Why so late?'' and ``Why only now?'' 
_ that Elie Wiesel asked in a speech at the opening of the recent 
Conference on Holocaust-Era Assets, held at the Holocaust Museum in 
Washington. His questions reflect the vigorous effort to sort out 
the assets, including missing or stolen artworks, that once belonged 
to Jews who died in the Holocaust. But the pungent implication in 
Wiesel's words is this: What has kept the world, until the past few 
years, from committing itself to the burden of disentangling the global 
effects of Hitler's spoliation? One answer is that an extraordinary 
contamination has attached to works of art stolen during the Holocaust. 
Hard as it may be for cultural institutions to address the matter 
of stolen art in their collections, it is vastly harder when the art 
was stolen during a regime that defines the horrific extremes of state-sponsored 
evil. The difficulty of coming to terms with Holocaust-era assets 
has been the difficulty of coming to terms with history itself. Until 
recently, the marketplace, however, has had little interest in history. 
The sale of a stolen work of art has often, falsely, seemed to legitimize 
the theft itself, leading now, more than half a century after Hitler 
took power, to tangled claims of ownership in which two forms of legitimacy, 
one legal, the other moral, come into conflict. In New York we have 
had the case of two Egon Schiele paintings _ lent to the Museum of 
Modern Art, claimed by their pre-Nazi owners, impounded by the city 
and still held pending appeal. Similar claims have been pressed elsewhere. 
Valery Kulishov, Russia's restitution director, pledged his country's 
assistance in obtaining restitution for individual victims, and turned 
over three secret documents bearing on stolen or missing artworks. 
Kulishov's gesture is welcome because the success of restitution depends 
on the quality of information, and the candor, that is brought to 
the table. The conference has also produced a set of guidelines for 
restitution of stolen art. The guidelines are nonbinding, but they 
carry, says Stuart Eizenstat, the conference's organizer, a ``moral 
commitment.'' Those words should serve as a stern reminder. It was 
precisely the abeyance of moral commitment, in ways large and small, 
that made restitution necessary in the first place.
