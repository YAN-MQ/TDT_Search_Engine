A new architectural honor has been established by a Canadian group, 
and its first focus will be New York City. The International Foundation 
for the Canadian Center for Architecture prize competition will help 
cities develop innovative ideas in architecture and city planning. 
Five architects will be selected to compete for the first Canadian 
Center prize. They will be asked to plan a 12-block area on the Westside 
of New York City's borough of Manhattan. The urban area, bordering 
the Hudson River, consists of rail lines, tunnels, and roadways as 
well as a variety of buildings. The creators of the prize hope to 
stimulate public discussion on how urban areas will be developed for 
use in the 21st century. After the architects' proposals are made, 
their plans will be part of an exhibit next year in New York. The 
winner of the new $100,000 design prize will be announced in the year 
2000. Directing the Canadian Center competition is Ralph Learner Dean 
of the School Architecture at Princeton University. Jurors for the 
award committee include Canadian Center for Architecture Director 
Phyllis Lambert, University of Pennsylvania Dean Gary Hack, and renowned 
California architect Frank Gary.
