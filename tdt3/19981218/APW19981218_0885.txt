Iraqi President Saddam Hussein said Friday he would not ``compromise 
or kneel'' in his showdown with the United States and Britain over 
U.N. weapons inspections. Addressing his country on television for 
the first time since the U.S.-British airstrikes began early Thursday, 
Saddam told Iraqis: ``Continue your resistance and, by God's will, 
you will be victorious. ``You are representing justice and all the 
great characteristics against injustice,'' Saddam said. Dressed in 
his fieldmarshal's uniform, the president spoke of the strikes on 
Iraq that have killed at least 25 people and wounded another 75, according 
to Iraqi officials. ``You, great Iraqi people, you have raised high 
the Iraqi flag and you have proved again that you are heroic.'' ``Continue 
your resistance, and the criminals are doomed. In the name of God, 
strike them,'' he said. ``We will not compromise or kneel in the face 
of injustice. We will not let evil triumph over virtue.'' The president 
paid tribute to the Iraqi armed forces and the air defense troops, 
who have been firing anti-aircraft guns at the cruise missiles raining 
on Baghdad. ``Iraq will be victorious. God damns them. Shame will 
be their fate, those followers of Satan and evil.'' He ended his five-minute 
speech with the words: ``Long live great Iraq, the great Arab nation 
and Palestine, and doomed are our enemies.'' The United States and 
Britain are trying to compel Iraq to comply fully with U.N. resolutions 
requiring that Iraq submit to inspections that verify that it has 
ended any attempts to build weapons of mass destruction.
