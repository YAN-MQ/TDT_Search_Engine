Simultaneously the president was monitoring the progress of "operation 
desert fox." The third day of those American and British attacks on 
Iraqi targets. Today the tactics changed with more manned attack planes 
joining the battle. Defense department officials insist it is going 
as planned. However, NBC's Jim Miklaszewski reports from the Pentagon 
many questions remain open tonight. jim? Tom, for now, the U.S. military 
still owns the skies over Iraq. But this time, without those deadly 
cruise missiles. This third wave of airstrikes is all fighter bombers 
and jets. Crews on the aircraft carrier "enterprise" scrambling today 
to reload Navy warplanes with precision-guided bombs and missiles. 
At nightfall, they lead the third wave of air strikes against military 
targets in southern Iraq. Along with the air force B-1, the first 
time the costly long-range bombers have ever been used in combat. 
At the Pentagon today, the military showed off its first gun camera 
shots of the bombings, strike after strike, right on target. Our aircraft 
have enjoyed great success. But what is it they're hitting? Surveillance 
photos reveal the latest bomb damage. A missile plant where sources 
report Iraq has a secret project to build long-range missiles and 
airport maintenance hangers where small planes were being fitted to 
spray deadly biological weapons. Using psychosocial warfare, planes 
also dropped leaflets on Iraqi troops, warning stay out of the fight 
or be destroyed. And in an obvious effort to turn the regular military 
against Saddam, the leaflets advise only units who support Saddam 
will be bombed. But disarming Saddam Hussein may not be as easy as 
these pictures make it look. He successfully has hidden his deadly 
weapons for years. Defense secretary William Cohen acknowledges many 
targets may in fact be empty. There's no guarantee that you can hit 
those items which have been moved. They will not have the facility 
to go back to. But if you can't find these weapons, it will make it 
even more difficult to determine just how successful these air strikes 
have been or when to call them off. U.S. officials still believe, 
however, this latest round of attacks will be over by Sunday. tom? 
Thank you very much, Jim Miklaszewski at the Pentagon tonight.
