Once again, Iraq is proving to be a resilient country and Saddam Hussein 
a Durable enemy. Let's go now to Baghdad where it is early Saturday 
morning. NBC's Kevin Tibbles still at his post there. Kevin? Well, 
Tom, tonight indeed that third attack is under way. So far it's concentrated 
just over the horizon in the outskirts of Baghdad. Sirens piercing 
the night sky as Iraqi anti-aircraft guns fired back at incoming American 
warplanes. This day in Baghdad began with Iraqis cleaning up from 
another night of attacks. While the Iraqi government was launching 
a public relations offensive. Newspapers branding the American assault 
"operation Monica." From a secret location, a defiant stss is vowing 
on Iraqi TV, his people would not compromise or bend. In front of 
the world media, his deputy prime minister blaming president clinton. 
What we are witnessing now is not a military conflict. It's a criminal 
aggression. As far as the actual damage here on the ground it is hard 
to measure the impact of the raids because of press restrictions. 
NBC news was taken on a carefully controlled tour of a hospital. The 
Iraqis claim all the windows shattered when a missile hit a nearby 
defense ministry building. But a visit to the defense ministry building 
was off-limits. Can we go and see? no. Why not? They don't allow. 
But we were taken to visit a mosque where on this Muslim sabbath, 
some Iraqis spent the day in prayer. Tomorrow is Ramadan, the holiest 
month of the year, and many hope it will bring an end to the fighting. 
Tom, the assault under way is expected to last throughout the night 
and then tomorrow again. Iraqis will begin their day cleaning up the 
damage from the night before. tom? Thanks very much. Kevin Tibbles 
tonight in Baghdad.
