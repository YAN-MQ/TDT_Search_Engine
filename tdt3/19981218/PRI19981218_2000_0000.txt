From Public Radio International, this is the World, a co-production 
of the BBC world service, PRI and WGBH Boston. LISA MULLINS: It's 
Friday December 18th. I'm Lisa Mullins in Boston. MULLINS: Today U.S. 
and British warplanes launch another raid with strikes against Iraq. 
Our man in Baghdad says the Iraqis are dubbing it operation Monica. 
another operation Monica opens on Capitol Hill. A House divided against 
itself debates impeaching President Clinton and Americans overseas 
are not pleased. UNKNOWN: For me, to view a domestic problem kind 
of having tentacles going out internationally is very embarrassing 
to me as an American. MULLINS: First, this news. DERRICK STOFFEL : 
For the World, I'm Derrick Stoffel in the BBC News room in London.
