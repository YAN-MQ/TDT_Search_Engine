In his 20 seasons of accomplishment in the National Hockey League, 
Wayne Gretzky has performed in many arenas that have either been vacated 
by their teams or demolished altogether. They include the Montreal 
Forum, the Boston Garden, Chicago Stadium, the Detroit Olympia, the 
Auditorium in Buffalo, the Arena in St. Louis and the Spectrum in 
Philadelphia. He said he remembers the national anthem in Chicago 
and how the building seemed to shake; the balcony in Boston and how 
the fans seemed to be right on top of the players; and the hard, fast 
ice in Detroit where Gordie Howe, his boyhood idol, skated before 
him. These memories, Gretzky said, evoke feelings that are difficult 
to express. As much as he is a star of the sport, Gretzky, more than 
many athletes, remains a fan, with a fan's sense of nostalgia and 
tradition. But no rink is as special to him to visit as Maple Leaf 
Gardens in Toronto, where Gretzky and the Rangers will play for the 
final time Saturday night. The Leafs are moving into a new building, 
the Air Canada Centre, in February, the month after Gretzky's 38th 
birthday. Gretzky grew up in Brantford, in southern Ontario, where 
Maple Leaf Gardens was known as ``the church of hockey.'' It was ``one 
of the first arenas that we used to help establish an NHL,'' Gretzky 
said, ``and it is the foundation of making the Toronto Maple Leaf 
franchise what it is today.'' It was also the closest NHL rink to 
his home. He first visited it with his grandmother when he was 6 years 
old, to see a game between the Leafs and the Oakland Seals. ``My dad 
dropped us off,'' Gretzky said Friday. ``We sat in the very last row. 
I got there an hour early. I don't think I moved the whole time. I 
think the first time I got out of my seat was after they announced 
the three stars.'' Gretzky has been one of those three stars many 
times in visits to the big old barn on Carlton Street. In 29 regular-season 
games there, Gretzky has 30 goals and 45 assists. In eight playoff 
games, he has three goals and eight assists. In one of his best-remembered 
performances, when he was with the Los Angeles Kings in 1993, Gretzky 
scored three goals, and his hat trick led the Kings to a 5-4 victory 
in Game 7 of the Campbell Conference finals. ``Maybe the best game 
I ever played,'' Gretzky said Friday. It sent the Kings to their only 
berth in the Stanley Cup finals, where they lost to Montreal. ``It's 
very easy to get excited for a game at Maple Leaf Gardens,'' Gretzky 
said. Unlike some players from the hockey-intense region, he said 
he is not bothered by the demands of family and friends before the 
game. ``They leave me alone until after the game,'' Gretzky said. 
His parents, wife and children are expected to be among the capacity 
crowd Saturday night. They will see two rested teams, both having 
last played on Wednesday, when the Rangers lost to the Devils and 
the Leafs defeated Phoenix. Toronto is 17-11-2 and challenging for 
the lead in the Eastern Conference. The Rangers are 11-12-7, but they 
are 1-0-1 against the Leafs this season. With 33 points, on six goals 
and 27 assists, Gretzky is tied for sixth in NHL scoring. In regular-season 
play for his career, he has 891 goals and 1,937 assists. When he was 
asked what makes the Toronto building unique in a hockey sense, Gretzky 
replied: ``The bottom part of the boards were so lively compared to 
any other arena in hockey. In Maple Leaf Gardens, you could shoot 
a puck from the left point, hit the backboards and it could come out 
in front to the guy on the other side of the net and _ bang, bang! 
_ quicker than any other building. It's not quite the same now because 
the net has been moved out two feet.'' Before a game, Gretzky recalled, 
he and other players would practice the carom, just to get the angle 
right and possibly catch opponents off guard. He first played there 
on Nov. 21, 1979, when he was an NHL rookie with the Edmonton Oilers. 
In a 4-4 tie, Gretzky had two goals and two assists. In his most recent 
trip, on Nov. 7, he scored a goal and saved the puck. ``It's a very 
special place, something I think is sacred,'' he said. ``You don't 
replace Maple Leaf Gardens. But I understand the position of the owners 
and the situation they are in. We have to grow with the times and 
change with the times. Sometimes in life, we don't like changes. But 
we have to make them. We will never recapture the atmosphere.'' SLAP
