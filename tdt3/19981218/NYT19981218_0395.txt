The Energy Department reported Friday that it had found ``no show 
stoppers'' so far to block its plan to bury much of the United States' 
nuclear waste in the Nevada desert near Las Vegas and that it was 
on schedule to make a formal recommendation to the president by 2001. 
In what it called its ``viability assessment'' released Friday, however, 
the department did identify major gaps in its knowledge of the geology 
of the site, Yucca Mountain. But officials promised to answer questions 
raised by scientists outside the department about water in the mountain, 
the most probable means by which radioactive contamination could escape 
beyond the site. The energy secretary, Bill Richardson, said in a 
telephone interview, ``The fact that no show stoppers have been identified 
is a step forward.'' ``We are admitting additional work is needed,'' 
Richardson added, ``but it's in the national interest to proceed forward.'' 
Opponents of the plan, however, say that enough problems with Yucca 
Mountain are known to disqualify it as a nuclear-waste repository. 
A coalition of 219 environmental organizations submitted a petition 
to the agency last month saying that even in the Nevada desert, rain 
will percolate through the mountain in a few decades, picking up radioactive 
material on the way. Then, environmentalists argue, the water will 
travel horizontally to wells beyond the site over hundreds of years, 
yet quickly enough to deliver the materials while they are still dangerously 
radioactive. A statement from Public Citizen, the organization founded 
by Ralph Nader that helped organize the 219 groups, said, ``We object 
to the content of the report for its optimistic conclusions.'' But 
Ernest Moniz, the energy undersecretary, said one of the gaps in knowledge 
was how fast water would move underground, and how much it would dilute 
any radioactive contaminants. The estimates in the report might be 
``too conservative'' or too pessimistic, he said. The Nuclear Regulatory 
Commission, an independent federal agency, is supposed to decide whether 
to grant a license for construction of the repository, based on criteria 
set by the Environmental Protection Agency. The EPA, however, has 
not yet set rules, one of the reasons the process is uncertain. The 
report included, for the first time, a preliminary design for the 
proposed repository on the edge of the Nevada Test Site where the 
Energy Department used to explode nuclear bombs. The department, under 
tremendous pressure because it missed a deadline of February 1998 
to begin accepting waste from nuclear-powered reactors, hopes to open 
a repository in 2010, with waste being loaded until 2033. The documents 
released Friday anticipated sealing the repository in 2116, but raised 
the possibility of keeping the tunnels through the mountain open for 
300 years, until 2316, to ensure that the radioactive material was 
not leaking. The department said it would cost $18.7 billion to license 
and build the repository and to load it with more than 70,000 tons 
of waste from power plants and bomb factories. The costs in 1998 dollars, 
including expenses since 1983 and 100 years of monitoring, would be 
$43 billion, the department said. The money would come from a tenth-of-a-cent-per-kilowatt-hour 
charge that the department collects from nuclear utilities, which 
should be enough to pay for the whole program, officials said Friday. 
But in exchange for the fee, the department was supposed to have begun 
accepting wastes last February; now it faces penalties for being late, 
under contracts it signed with utility companies. The period of maximum 
exposure, said the report, is after 300,000 years. At that point, 
the report estimated, doses to people drinking from wells 12 miles 
away would be about 300 millirem a year, which would be about equal 
to present-day radiation from natural sources. That would be 10 to 
20 times higher than the limits now being discussed, but no one has 
decided yet whether radiation-protection standards should have to 
extend so far into the future. The debate over Yucca Mountain may 
focus on a more immediate future, of a few thousand years. The viability 
assessment on the Yucca Mountain Project is available on the Web at
