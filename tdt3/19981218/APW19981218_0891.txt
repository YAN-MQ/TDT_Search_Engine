Deafening explosions rocked Baghdad on Friday in the latest wave of 
U.S. and British air raids that Iraq says have killed at least 25 
people in the last two days. The Iraqi capital came under missile 
attack hours before dawn, capping a barrage of strikes that began

Iraq's official television. ``Continue your resistance, and the criminals 
are doomed. In the name of God, strike them,'' he said. ``We will 
not compromise or kneel in the face of injustice. We will not let 
evil triumph over virtue.'' Dozens of sites, including the headquarters 
of the military intelligence and security police and factories that 
were monitored by U.N. weapons inspectors, have been hit in the missile 
attacks, Iraqi officials said. As a new day dawned Friday, the tension

said in large red letters above the name of the newspaper. Below the,
