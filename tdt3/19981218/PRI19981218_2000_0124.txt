In a press conference earlier today, Saddam's deputy prime minister 
Tariq Aziz warned Iraq will continue its resistance. KEREK AZIZ: What 
we are witnessing now is not a military conflict. It's criminal aggression 
by the United States and Britain against Iraq, the Arab nations, the 
Muslims and against the whole international community. STOFEL: Iraqi 
deputy prime minister Tariq Aziz. In response, British Prime Minister 
Tony Blair says Saddam Hussein poses an threat as long as he remains 
in power. Mr. Blair says the Iraqi leader has proven time and again 
he cannot be trusted. PRIME MINISTER TONY BLAIR: I don't think that 
anyone who looks at the facts of this seriously believes in the credibility 
of Saddam Hussein. He is the person that has lied all the way through. 
Every time he gave his word, he broke it. STOFEL: British Prime Minister 
Tony Blair. stofel:
