American and British aircraft are engaged in a third night of military 
strikes against Iraq. Large explosions have been heard in the Iraqi 
capital and anti-aircraft fire has started up. With the latest, here's 
the BBC Jeremy Cook in Baghdad. JEREMY COOK: Once again, the glowing 
red trace of fire is arching into the night sky over Baghdad. Here 
in the center of the city, we've heard the distant thump of incoming 
high explosives, probably more cruise missiles. And as operation Desert 
Fox moves into its third night, the Iraqis are admitting that there 
has been considerable destruction. The Iraqis have given no details 
of the damage done to military installations. Saddam Hussein has broadcast 
to the Iraqi people on state TV and he's told them we will not kneel 
in the face of injustice. We will not let evil triumph over virtue.
