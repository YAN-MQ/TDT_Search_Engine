More news coming up after the extended weather forecast for the states. 
This look at your "CNN Headline News Weather" begins with our forecast 
weather map for Saturday morning. Snowfall will be found in the Great 
Lakes area. We've had near-blizzard conditions throughout parts of 
the upper midwest during the day on Friday. This is associated with 
the passing of a cold front that's ushering in some very cold weather. 
This frontal boundary will continue to push to the east and south 
as we go on through the weekend. Snowfall will continue in parts of 
the Great Lakes region and move into northern New England. Behind 
this, considerably cool weather, as you can see with our forecast 
for high temperatures. Some places in the northern Rockies will remain 
below zero throughout much of the day on Saturday. As far as our extended 
forecast is concerned, that cold weather hangs on in the northern 
plains states and the upper midwest. But as we move on into the start 
of next week, you can see the cold air begins to retreat just a little 
bit. Could be some thunderstorms in the Tennessee valley. Snow is 
still possible in the Great Lakes area. And as we move on into Tuesday, 
the cold air does begin to retreat. Still some snow showers possible 
in the Great Lakes area. For more weather information, log on to CNN.com.
