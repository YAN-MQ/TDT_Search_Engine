If Saddam Hussein is still in control of Iraq when the bombing ends, 
arms-control experts say, the Security Council should not abandon 
arms inspections but should quickly reimpose rigorous monitoring in 
every area of weapons development. Of particular concern to some experts 
is Saddam's track record of trying to build nuclear bombs and the 
readiness of the organization chosen to monitor that program, the 
International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA), to declare that Iraq's 
nuclear program is now finished. ``We need to avoid a situation where 
military action results in no inspections, weakened sanctions and 
a Saddam Hussein determined to get nuclear weapons,'' said David Albright, 
president of the independent Institute for Science and International 
Security in Washington and a former nuclear inspector in Iraq. Khidhir 
Hamza, an Iraqi nuclear scientist now in exile in the United States, 
said any loosening of nuclear monitoring would be doubly dangerous, 
because the Iraqi nuclear program also provides a cover for work on 
biological and chemical weapons. Arms-control officials here and independent 
experts confirm that there is evidence of overlapping programs at 
some Iraqi weapons centers, and they say there could be additional 
evidence if the nuclear installations were considered relatively free 
of surprise inspections. Over the last year, and most recently this 
week, the IAEA, which experts say did not detect work on nuclear weapons 
in Iraq over 20 years, has declared Iraq to be free of nuclear arms 
and largely cooperative with inspectors. The U.N. Special Commission, 
whose latest allegation of inadequate cooperation was cited by the 
Clinton administration as the basis for attacks on Iraq this week, 
is more independent. The Security Council created it solely to disarm 
Iraq of biological and chemical weapons and certain missile systems. 
Its staff is not drawn from U.N. workers, but is made up of experts 
loaned by a number of countries. Following the lead of the atomic 
agency, Russia, France and other Security Council members propose 
``closing the file'' on Iraq's nuclear weapons as an incentive to 
Saddam to cooperate more strongly in other areas. That argument had 
also had begun to be heard among some administration officials in 
Washington, Hamza, the defector, and other experts said. Even as the 
bombing continued, Iraqi officials in Baghdad and its diplomats here 
were saying that the government would be willing to work with inspectors 
again, but that they should all be like those of the atomic agency. 
The latest report from the IAEA was praised on Wednesday by Iraq's 
representative at the United Nations, Nizar Hamdoon. Washington, Hamdoon 
said, manipulated the work of Richard Butler, executive chairman of 
the U.N. Special Commission. ``The IAEA is not politicized,'' Hamdoon 
said. ``It is a highly professional organization.'' Butler, asked 
on Thursday about the gaps in findings between the atomic agency's 
report and his, said that he was not prepared to characterize the 
nuclear report. But he noted that it did not use the phrase ``full 
cooperation.'' ``The IAEA has a different job from ours, because they 
were never dealing with a completed weapons program,'' he said. ``That 
makes it vastly different from what we've has to deal with _ missiles, 
chemical and biological weapons _ where we were dealing with fabricated 
weapons, and that's a very different situation.'' Hamza, who formerly 
directed the Iraqi effort to design a nuclear bomb, said in an interview 
that closing the nuclear file just because no bombs had been found 
would play directly into Saddam's hands. ``This would be a big achievement 
for the Iraqis,'' Hamza said. ``If you close the book on nuclear weapons 
you would only have more work on biological and chemical weapons. 
The biological and chemical groups within the nuclear program are 
larger than in the biological and chemical programs themselves.'' 
Hamza said up to 12,000 scientists and other experts might be working 
under the umbrella of the nuclear program, including a significant 
number of biological and chemical specialists capable of advanced 
research, development and engineering. Only a few hundred technicians 
with lower-level skills remain in the separate biological- and chemical-weapons 
programs, he said, and they have been under intense scrutiny by the 
U.N. Special Commission. In an interview this week Albright, with 
whom Hamza works at the Institute for Science and International Security, 
said that the latest report by the atomic energy agency was ``a strained 
attempt to say something positive about Iraq.'' ``But Iraq has not 
answered the remaining historical questions about their secret nuclear 
weapons program,'' he said, adding that there was no indication that 
Iraq was cooperating with the nuclear inspectors ``or will do so in 
the future if the action team conducted controversial inspections.'' 
Officials of the agency say fears about Iraqi actions with nuclear 
weapons are exaggerated, because the agency will have effective monitoring 
in place. Critics say Iraq could damage it or could refuse to allow 
on-site inspections when monitoring turns up information that points 
to weapons. ``If you make the nuclear program off limits for surprise 
inspections then you've created a sanctuary for all kinds of activities,'' 
said Gary Milhollin, president of the Wisconsin Project, an arms control 
center in Washington. Moreover, he said, ``it doesn't make sense to 
discriminate among weapons of mass destruction in giving Iraq a clean 
bill of health.'' ``Monitoring is useless,'' Milhollin said, ``unless 
you can act on something you find during monitoring with surprise 
inspections.''
