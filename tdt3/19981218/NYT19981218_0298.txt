It began innocently. On a recent Saturday, I was waiting at the counter 
at Troy, the pristine, so-hip-it-hurts furnishings store in SoHo, 
where my loved one, John Goodfriend, is the manager. I was waiting 
for John to finish up while a never-ending stream of holiday shoppers 
eddied around me. Waiting. Waiting. Finally, in frustration, I approached 
an absolute stranger and spoke the fateful words: ``Is there anything 
special you're looking for?'' ``No, just browsing,'' he said. No matter. 
I found a young man who, in fact, was looking for something special. 
I steered him to some minimalist Lucite picture frames, whose chief 
allure, in my opinion, was the ease with which the pictures inside 
could be exchanged for new ones whenever the whim struck. ``These 
are fickle times,'' I pointed out. He bought two. Next I sold three 
bowls carved of horn to a charming young woman shopping for a friend. 
In less than an hour, I had cleared $350 worth of merchandise. By 
then, John was ready to leave, and boy, was he surprised at what I 
had been up to. ``You were really selling things?'' he asked, unsure 
whether I had broken some little-known rule. Later, he asked me again, 
as if waiting for me to tell him I had been kidding. But I wasn't. 
Not only had I been selling, I had loved it. For the brief three-quarters 
of an hour, I had been surrounded by people, popular, a far cry from 
my usual days spent writing at a computer alone in my apartment. I 
was reminded of my Wisconsin boyhood, a time when for three years 
running, I outsold every other student in my school in our annual 
scholarship drive, selling cheese door to door. (Yes, cheese. Don't 
laugh. It was Wisconsin. OK, laugh.) It all came back to me: the rush 
of a sale, the wicked thrill of getting to my friends' next-door neighbors 
and parents before they did. To write the Details column for the Sunday 
Styles section, I spend days going from store to store, shopping for 
a living. But I had never thought much about the person on the other 
side of the transaction _ the salesman or saleswoman. Now I wondered: 
Had I missed my true calling? Had I been cut out all along to be an 
heir to Willy Loman? I called Troy Halterman, the owner of Troy, and 
asked if I could come back to the store the following Saturday to 
move more merchandise. He readily agreed. After all, it was the holiday 
rush. Saturday morning rolled around fast. Before I had time to blink, 
it seemed, there I was, blasting ``You're a Mean One, Mr. Grinch'' 
on the store hi-fi and sipping a second coffee as the first customers 
trickled in. It was just like home, except there were people there. 
What a relief from my usual solitary mornings. I was soon told, however, 
that I couldn't really blast music or drink coffee on the sales floor. 
And then came a second blow to my high expectations. Selling cheese 
to Wisconsinites (especially if you happen to be a cute blond child 
on a bike) is a breeze compared with selling pricey trinkets, however 
chic, to jaded New Yorkers. Everyone needs cheese. But does everyone 
need an Italian gray glass decanter for $280? Troy specializes in 
cool, hard-edged housewares that are the apotheosis of today's vogue 
for modernist design. What the staff calls its Christmas tree is actually 
a Dan Flavin-like chandelier of red fluorescent tubes. The house gift 
wrap is a cardboard-and-cellophane package with an Op Art pattern. 
Some customers seemed intimidated by the merchandise. A simple smile 
and a polite offer of help seemed to be getting me nowhere. I decided 
to try more unconventional tactics. ``Are you looking for anything 
special?'' I asked. ``No.'' ``Anything ordinary, then?'' This got 
peoples' attention. So did, ``Do you have any idea at all what you're 
looking for?'' and ``Do you have any questions, problems or feelings 
about the holiday season that I can address?'' Although the answer 
was almost always the old, ``No thanks, just browsing,'' I usually 
got at least a smile out of the bargain, and on several occasions, 
customers came round a little later and asked for help. I sold a lot 
of picture frames. But irreverence did not work on everyone. One woman 
looked at me as if I were deranged, and my favorite sales come-on 
_ ``If you want to spend a lot of money, please just let me know'' 
_ did not go over well with anyone. The fashion designer Gene Meyer, 
who wandered in around 2 o'clock, seemed put off by my methods. He 
bought a lime-green 1960s Seth Thomas desk clock from someone else. 
Since I wasn't a full-time employee, I had no inhibitions about telling 
people what I thought was a good buy, and what, in my opinion, was 
an overpriced piece of debris. Surprisingly, some customers were suspicious 
of this approach. While showing some beautiful glasses _ only 8 bucks 
a pop _ to a woman in her 40s, I got the feeling that she thought 
I was trying to unload some overstock and holding back on the good 
stuff. All told, I was able to ring up a couple of thousand dollars 
in sales, not counting an additional $700 sale I arranged to have 
charged over the phone on Monday. By 6 p.m., however, my feet were 
killing me. If you think walking around shopping is exhausting, you 
haven't experienced true fatigue. I was dying for a drink, and I had 
finally snapped ``Fine!'' at the 1,000th person to say, ``No, just 
browsing.'' Once we got home, John got out the movie listings, and 
I passed out for two hours. The next day, over lunch with a friend, 
he suggested a movie that afternoon, but I declined. I felt strangely 
drawn back to Troy, where, minutes after I had my coat off, I was 
back on the floor, selling away. I was determined to move one of the 
handmade, watercolor-and-wenge-wood games of concentration, my favorite 
item in the store. I had almost sold one the day before; the sticking 
point, the couple explained, was they wanted it for themselves. I 
understood. I wanted it for myself, too. But the funny thing now was 
that I wanted to sell it more than I wanted to buy it. Like Willy 
Loman in Arthur Miller's famous description in ``Death of a Salesman,'' 
I was riding on a shoeshine and a smile. I've got a little Willy Loman 
in me, I know now. So come into Troy some time. I'll be the one asking, 
``Do you have any idea at all what you're looking for?''
