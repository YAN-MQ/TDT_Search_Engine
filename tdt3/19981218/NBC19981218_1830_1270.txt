When we come back -- someone who's been there before. Tonight, Peter 
rodino offers his unique perspective on impeachment -- battles, then 
and now. I'm so clogged up. I just can't focus. You okay? Get tavi 
St-D. Just one works 12 hours versus four Tylenol cold pills. Tavist-D 
clears your congestion. Be clear-headed, clear through your day with 
tavist-D. It hurts so bad. That burning sensation. So I saw my doctor. 
He said where heartburn hurts most is where Mylanta works fast. All 
down through here where you want help fast. Your offer to give my 
clients their own reading lights would be acceptable... if they could 
read. Alright...each party gets their own sliding door. Fine, but 
my client's ready to walk if he doesn't get a V-6 out of this deal. 
Okay, he gets his 6. yeah, but we still need our cargo space, Jack. 
A ouncer: the all new, V-6, something-for-everyone Honda odyssey. 
It's one big happy minivan.
