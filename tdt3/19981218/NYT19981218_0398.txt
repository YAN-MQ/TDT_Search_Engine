Lawrence Taylor, the former Giants linebacker, turned himself in to 
the police in Teaneck, N.J., on Thursday to face charges of drug possession 
and possession of drug paraphernalia, authorities said Friday. Taylor 
surrendered at police headquarters without incident and was released 
on his own recognizance after posting a $2,500 bond, said Capt. Paul 
Tiernan of the Teaneck Police Department. The charges against Taylor, 
39, stem from an incident on Sept. 29 when the Teaneck police, acting 
on a tip, searched a room rented in Taylor's name at the Glenpointe 
Marriott Hotel and discovered crack cocaine and drug paraphernalia, 
Tiernan said. Taylor was not in the room at the time. The Bergen County 
Prosecutor's office will now consider whether to indict Taylor on 
the charges, said James Addis, an assistant prosecutor. In October, 
Taylor checked into a drug rehabilitation clinic, a week after he 
was arrested in St. Petersburg, Fla., on charges of buying crack cocaine. 
At the time of that arrest, he was waiting to be sentenced on a tax-evasion 
conviction that arose from his failure to pay taxes on $48,000 in 
income from a defunct restaurant in New Jersey. Two years ago, Taylor 
was arrested in Myrtle Beach, S.C., on charges that he had tried to 
buy $100 of fake crack cocaine from an undercover police officer. 
His record in that case was wiped clean after he undertook 60 hours 
of community service and submitted to drug counseling and random drug 
testing.
