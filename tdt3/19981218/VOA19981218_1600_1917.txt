The US House of Representatives is debating for the first time in 
130 years whether to impeach a president with Bill Clinton accused 
of wrong doing in the Monica Lewinsky affair. The Republican Majority 
accuses Mr. Clinton of betraying the people's trust. In a highly emotional 
speech, Massachusetts Democrat Edward Markey worried that impeachment 
would set a dangerous precedent. A constitutional clause intended 
to apply to a Benedict Arnold selling out his country will now be 
expanded to cover every personal transgression. Every future President, 
Democrat, or Republican will be subject to harassment by his political 
enemies who can credibly threaten impeachment for the slightest misconduct. 
Democrats say the Congress should censure the President instead of 
impeaching him. But Republican Representative Mary Bono says such 
an action is unconstitutional. As we debate this issue, some will 
argue that impeachment is too harsh a punishment or too inconvenient 
for our nation. However, it is the only appropriate remedy given to 
us by the framers of our constitution. Mr. Clinton's chances of adverting 
impeachment appear slim. If impeached he would face trial in the Senate 
on whether to remove him from office. The House is scheduled to vote 
Saturday on charges of obstruction of justice, abuse of power and 
two counts of perjury.
