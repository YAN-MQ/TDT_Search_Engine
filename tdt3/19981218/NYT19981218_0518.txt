The reports of a fire on Vandalia Avenue in Brooklyn jolted Ricco 
Sanchez into reality. Forget the near-numbing talk about presidential 
impeachment or the almost emotionless descriptions of the smart bombs 
and surgical strikes in Baghdad. Fire? That's big news in Sanchez's 
part of the world. His grandmother lives on Vandalia Avenue, and he 
wasn't sure if the flames had ripped through her building or the one 
next door. He raced by van from his job in downtown Brooklyn to her 
block in Canarsie, where he learned the fire had been in the building 
next to his grandmother's. He stood outside watching the somber firefighters 
who lost three colleagues in the blaze. Poor guys, he said. His voice 
had a sad, confused finality to it. ``This is real,'' he said. ``This 
happens in our back yard. So many different things that happen. This 
is over here. It's like Iraq. Over there, the civilians are going 
through things. Everybody faces tough times.'' Perhaps all pain _ 
never mind politics _ is local. Someone should tell that to the politicians 
and pundits debating President Clinton's moral and possible criminal 
failures. In some places, supposedly serious people speculate that 
the Big Iraq attack was a ``Wag the Dog'' diversionary tactic. Heck, 
Larry King did away with the ``serious'' part when he had Johnnie 
Cochran and Dick Morris on to analyze the political scene, as if O.J. 
Simpson's lawyer and a political consultant better known for his own 
fetishes and indiscretions had anything worth saying. Then again, 
who was listening? In Times Square a few days ago, there were more 
teen-agers jumping up and down on the sidewalk vying for the attention 
of guests inside the MTV studios than there were people watching the 
green-hued video of missiles launched against Iraq. But the sight 
of orange flames and black smoke on your block really hits home. So, 
too, do the deaths of three men from Ladder Company 170: Lt. Joseph 
Cavalieri and Firefighters Christopher Bopp and James Bohan. Dorothy 
Devouse sighed sadly as she looked at the fire trucks that lined the 
street. For all the talk about duty and government service being bandied 
about in Washington lately, the sight of those trucks was all she 
needed to have a little faith. ``I'm a retired nurse,'' she said. 
``The Fire Department is the only agency that I respect highly, because 
their lives are in danger every day and they ask for no glory. I put 
them above the NYPD. They save lives, regardless. My heart really 
goes out to them.'' She recalled how when she worked at city hospitals, 
firefighters would be brought in weak from smoke inhalation or worse. 
They inspired her to do her best. ``I never lost one while I was on 
duty,'' she said, satisfied. ``They were all in high spirits. You 
never heard them put their job down. They just wanted to be treated 
and get back to what they were doing.'' What they do is rush into 
places that reasonable people would do anything to escape. Their adrenaline, 
she said, always chooses fight over flight. You see that often enough, 
and you never forget it. Nor do you forget the faces of firefighters 
who have lost their colleagues. Even with all the chaos in the nation 
and the world today, nothing can compare to that. ``You know what 
I said to my family yesterday?'' Ms. DeVouse said. ``We got a whole 
lot of mess to clean up right here in New York. But we're running 
around, going all over the world. I live right here. I got to be concerned 
about what's happening right here.'' That was why Elaine Sawyer stood 
by her window across the street, watching the firefighters for hours. 
When she saw the flames shoot out of the building she had hoped _ 
in vain _ that no one was injured. ``When I heard the news, it hurt,'' 
she said. ``Three people aren't going home today. From that building.'' 
She spoke of the firefighters as if they were friends, even though 
she didn't know their names. Her neighbors, she said, shared that 
affection. Downstairs from her apartment, six firefighters trudged 
down the street. They boarded a ladder truck that had a Christmas 
wreath hung on the front. The flashing red emergency light looked 
right for the season. The side door was inscribed ``In Memory of Capt. 
Scott La Piedra,'' in honor of a colleague who died in the line of 
duty this year. It, too, seemed right. Ms. Sawyer stood by her open 
window and waved frantically at them. ``Firemen!'' she shouted. ``Firemen! 
We love you. God bless you.''
