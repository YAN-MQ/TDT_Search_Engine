Mindful of the recent blossoming in relations with the United States, 
Palestinian authorities moved Friday to contain protests against the 
bombing of Iraq. Protesters throughout the West Bank and Gaza Strip 
gathered after Friday morning Muslim prayers to protest the joint 
U.S.-British airstrikes on Iraq. The largest turnout was in Nablus, 
where thousands marched through the city chanting ``America is under 
our feet.'' and ``Britain is an enemy of God.''' The airstrikes began 
late Wednesday night after a United Nations report concluded that 
Iraq was not cooperating with inspectors seeking to contain its weapons-of-mass-destruction 
capability. The Nablus protesters shouted slogans against the recent 
Palestinian-U.S. rapprochement. Some marchers shook their fists in 
the air when they saw Palestinian leader Yasser Arafat's helicopter 
approach. Most protesters belonged to militant Islamic groups, but 
some belonged to Arafat's Fatah movement. Palestinian police stopped 
the marchers from heading toward an Israeli-controlled area of the 
West Bank, where the protesters had hoped to confront Israeli troops. 
The Palestinian Authority is anxious to be seen as abiding by the 
U.S.-brokered Wye River accords with Israel. President Bill Clinton 
visited Israel and the Palestinian areas earlier this week to try 
and break the deadlock in the accords. Palestinians, especially pleased 
by his hints of approval of Palestinian statehood, want to sustain 
the newly-friendly ties. Israel was to have withdrawn from West Bank 
territory Friday as part of the Wye accords. On Wednesday, Prime Minister 
Benjamin Netanyahu said he would miss the deadline and not move until 
he saw Palestinians were containing anti-Israel violence. Any anger 
Palestinians on the street might have felt by the missed deadline 
was swallowed up by the pro-Iraq protests. In Manger Square in Bethlehem 
_ where just days ago, U.S. President Bill Clinton was greeted rapturously 
_ several hundred marchers shouted ``Death to Clinton.'' Protesters 
burned a U.S. flag. Palestinian security briefly detained an Associated 
Press writer for photographing the flag-burning, and released him 
on condition that he not take pictures of other anti-U.S. actions. 
After the demonstration, the marchers threw stones at Israeli troops 
guarding the entrance to the city, just south of Jerusalem. The troops 
responded with rubber bullets and tear gas. Fifteen protesters were 
injured. In another sign of Palestinian efforts to contain anti-U.S. 
sentiment, police shut down two local TV stations and a radio in Ramallah. 
Both TV stations broadcast test signals saying they were closed ``until 
further notice'' and on the radio station's frequency, there was only 
instrumental music. There was no official explanation for the shutdown, 
but Al Watan TV station had broadcast pro-Iraqi interviews; Al Nasr 
TV had broadcast nationalist music; and The Voice of Peace had devoted 
its broadcasts on Thursday to a popular nationalist Iraqi singer.
