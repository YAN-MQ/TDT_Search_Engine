Transparency is not just for glass, water and lies anymore. There 
are transparent cities, transparent economies, transparent countries. 
Musical performances and compositions are praised for their transparency. 
And some cosmologists even call the earliest glimpse of the universe 
``the moment of transparency.'' Transparency International, an organization 
devoted to fighting governmental corruption, is celebrating its fifth 
anniversary and recently rated 100 nations from most transparent (least 
corrupt) to least transparent (most corrupt). At a recent meeting 
in Washington, the world's finance ministers and central bankers discussed 
new rules of ``financial transparency'' that would require countries 
to reveal more information to investors and make it harder to hide 
an impending disaster. Maxwell Anderson, the new director of the Whitney 
Museum of American Art in New York, said of the museum's reorganization, 
``We're trying to be more transparent, more lucid.'' And in a recent 
essay in The New Republic, Jonathan Lear, a philosopher and psychoanalyst, 
analyzed Kenneth Starr's inquiry into President Clinton's sex life 
as a ``demand for transparency.'' Suddenly, everything is transparent. 
Why is this see-through word so hot now? ``Transparency does seem 
to be an ideal in all sorts of ways at the moment,'' and it might 
have something to do with ``our confessional culture,'' said the literary 
critic Peter Brooks. ``People don't think they exist unless they have 
something to confess.'' Lear sees just the opposite: our passion for 
transparency is an attempt to repress hidden meaning. He takes his 
lessons from Sophocles: ``Oedipus thinks that the only realm is what 
is transparent to the human mind,'' Lear said. He hears the oracle 
and thinks he knows exactly what the prophecy about killing his father 
and marrying his mother means. (Get out of town.) The only problems 
for him are practical problems. What he doesn't realize is that the 
gods' real message is hidden, opaque. He is blinded by the apparent 
transparency. Before transparency there were other watchwords that 
captured the spirit of their time. Thirty years ago, in ``Sincerity 
and Authenticity,'' Lionel Trilling noted that after a 400-year reign, 
the word sincerity _ ``the avoidance of being false to any man through 
being true to one's own self'' _ was ceding its authority to a new 
word: authenticity. Trilling said authenticity suggested ``a more 
strenuous moral experience'' and had ``a wider reference to the universe 
and man's place in it.'' It was a deeper, darker idea than sincerity, 
less polite. Is transparency next in the procession of moral terms? 
These days politicians, diplomats and economists can't seem to get 
enough of the word. In international affairs, it has become a synonym 
for ``good governance.'' Shashi Tharoor, the communications director 
for the secretary-general of the United Nations, said ``a transparent 
government is one that is accessible to the governed, that lets the 
public know what it is doing and why.'' When governments are transparent, 
he said, they ``open themselves up to the public scrutiny.'' Frank 
Vogl, vice chairman of Transparency International, said the idea was 
that ``if we can shine light on or make transparent the government 
procurement of goods and services, then the opportunities for vendors 
to pay kickbacks and bribes would be reduced.'' How was the name chosen? 
``When we looked for a name for our organization we found that transparencia 
is immediately recognizable in many languages as being connected with 
corruption, especially in Latin American, Italy and France,'' Vogl 
said. ``They know we're not working for Kodak.'' Besides, ``it's better 
than Honesty International or Integrity International.'' Still, he 
admitted, it is a euphemism. ``If you talk to people in the U.N. and 
the World Bank, they shudder to talk about corruption. It's diplomatically 
insulting. But there is a willingness to use the word transparency.'' 
Everyone understands that ``people who are not transparent are corrupt.'' 
In other words, transparency is a code word. There is opacity built 
into it. That is the paradox of transparency. It seems perfectly clear 
until you really start looking at it. Which may be why the people 
who have the most experience with transparency _ architects, art historians, 
literary critics and philosophers _ have all learned to distrust it. 
Brooks suggests looking at history to understand the dangers of the 
word. ``Transparency was a concept that came of age during the French 
Revolution,'' during the Reign of Terror, he said. ``The Jacobins 
believed that if you were not transparent, you had something to hide. 
You were an enemy of virtue. They sent people to the guillotine because 
they were opaque.'' He sees a new version of transparency fever now. 
He called the Clinton investigation a ``fascinating perversion'' of 
our passion for transparency. Anyone who is preaching the virtues 
of transparency, Brooks suggested, should read Jean-Jacques Rousseau. 
In ``The Confessions,'' Brooks said, Rousseau wishes to ``make his 
soul transparent to the reader's eye.'' But ``Rousseau is no dummy,'' 
Brooks added. ``He realizes this is an ideal state and that there 
are always obstacles between discrete beings. He realizes that language 
doesn't permit transparency. In that sense, he is the source of modernity.'' 
He knows that every system of representation _ whether it is a language, 
a painting or a confession _ ``disguises and distorts the truth.'' 
You cannot make anything that is perfectly transparent. It is not 
for want of trying. In the 1920s and '30s, the philosophers of the 
Vienna Circle in Austria and the architects of the Dessau Bauhaus 
in Germany found a common cause in transparency. And it wasn't just 
glass that they loved. Walter Gropius designed the Bauhaus building 
in Dessau with glass walls and a flat roof. The idea was to make a 
non-ornamental building that revealed its own structure, materials 
and function. Similarly, the philosophers of the Vienna Circle, in 
opposition to the metaphysicians of the past, tried to found a scientific 
philosophy on simple statements and valid inferences. And at least 
one member, Otto Neurath, tried to create an international language 
of pictographs that anyone could understand. ``The Isotype system 
(as it was called) was essentially a linguistic and pictorial form 
of transparent construction,'' Galison writes. (It was also the precursor 
to the system of international traffic signs we still use.) So what 
went wrong? The Bauhaus buildings were not as functional or as non-ornamental 
as they were supposed to be. And with Nazism and Fascism on the rise, 
the Vienna Circle's belief in ``a purely technical approach to social 
problems'' faltered. The ideal of a simple, scientific philosophy 
never panned out. Transparency was an impossible goal. The result 
was that the people who still clung to transparency looked naive. 
What modernism taught us, Brooks said, is that ``honest art is always 
honest about opacity.'' Take, for example, the ideal of transparency 
in painting. ``In the classical, mimetic theory of art, the picture 
plane is understood as being transparent,'' a window onto reality, 
said Yve-Alain Bois, a professor of art history at Harvard University. 
``Modern art is against that idea. Modern art is constructed around 
opacity.'' Why? Because ``transparency is an illusion, a deception,'' 
he said. A painting is not a window, after all; it is paint and canvas. 
The same thing happened in sculpture. In the classic theory of sculpture, 
there was the idea that ``under the surface of the work, there is 
a core, a skeleton, or even a beating heart,'' Bois said. You were 
supposed to be able to tell what was in the core from the surface, 
because ``the surface depended on the core.'' Modernism attacked this 
notion, too. Auguste Rodin ignored the interior core completely by 
working in fragments and by grafting pieces onto the surface, Rosalind 
Krauss observed in her book ``Passages in Modern Sculpture.'' So did 
Picasso. He created the head of a woman out of two colanders, Bois 
said, proving that ``there is nothing inside, that it's hollow,'' 
that everything is on the surface. In modernist painting and sculpture, 
transparency is synonymous with illusion, and opacity is synonymous 
with honesty about materials and construction. Which brings us back 
to the Bauhaus. The very thing that modernist art historians call 
opacity is what Bauhaus architects praised as transparency: letting 
the materials show through in the final product. The word transparent 
is defined in the dictionary as ``clear,'' ``without guile or concealment.'' 
But transparency has gotten hopelessly tangled up. In ``Transparency,'' 
a 1963 book that is now trendy, architectural historian Colin Rowe 
and painter Robert Slutzky give two opposed definitions of ``transparent,'' 
one meaning clear, the other meaning unclear. Literal transparency, 
they write, is the kind you get with glass. But what they call ``phenomenal 
transparency,'' the illusion of transparency, is created with spatial 
layering and architectural tricks. ``The transparent ceases to be 
that which is perfectly clear and becomes instead that which is clearly 
ambiguous.'' It is enough to make you wonder whether anyone was ever 
clear about transparency. In his 1926 book, ``Glass in Modern Architecture,'' 
Arthur Korn tried a simple definition of glass: It ``is noticeable 
yet not quite visible,'' he wrote. ``It is the great membrane, full 
of mystery, delicate yet tough.'' Oh, for the days when glass was 
transparent, transparent was clear, and clear was . . . Well, you 
get the picture.
