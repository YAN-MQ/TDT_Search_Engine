First lady Hillary Clinton has been named one of "people magazine's" 
25 most intriguing people of 1998. Her husband did not make the list, 
though. Neither did a certain White House intern. The common denominator 
among them, independent counsel Ken Starr made the cut. So did Internet 
gossip columnist Matt Drudge, baseball home run record-Holder Mark 
McGwire, and "Ally McBeal" star Calista Flockhart. The list appears 
in the magazine's December 28th issue.
