Alltel Corp., a telecommunications company based in Little Rock, Ark., 
said Friday that it had agreed to acquire Aliant Communications Inc., 
a midwestern telephone company, for $1.5 billion in stock. The deal 
reflects a long-running expansion by Alltel into less-populated regions 
of the country at a time when larger competitors are focusing their 
efforts on urban areas with far more customers. Aliant is the dominant 
phone company in Nebraska. ``This is a kind of plain vanilla combination 
that has proven to work in the past,'' said Bette Massick Colombo, 
an analyst with Bear, Stearns. She said the merger offered some opportunities 
for cost savings but would improve Alltel's earnings even without 
savings. ``Both companies have been aggressive about rolling out Internet 
and long-distance service,'' she said. ``This is kind of a second-tier 
mentality because competition is not going to come to Nebraska first.'' 
The combination will create a company with $5.3 billion in annual 
revenues, 6.3 million communications customers in 24 states, 22,000 
employees and more than 1,000 information-services clients. Aliant 
shareholders will get $39.1275 in Alltel stock for each share, about 
a 27 percent premium to Aliant's Thursday closing price of $30.875. 
News of the deal sent Aliant shares to a new 52-week high, closing 
at $37.25, up $6.375, in Nasdaq trading. Alltel closed at $55.875, 
down $1.125, on the New York Stock Exchange. Analysts said the mild 
competitive and regulatory environment in Nebraska made Aliant an 
especially attractive acquisition for Alltel, and that the premium 
price represented a good return for Aliant shareholders. Based in 
Lincoln, Aliant is the major local provider of wire-line service for 
that city and 22 surrounding counties, but not Omaha. It is the leading 
cellular provider for Nebraska, including Omaha, analysts said. The 
deal fits Alltel's strategy of growth through acquisition and serving 
midsize and rural markets. Alltel acquires lesser-known telephone 
companies in smaller markets and enhances their franchises with Alltel's 
strong brand name and improved management, analysts said. ``The merger 
of Alltel and Aliant will expand Alltel's geographic footprint in 
a dynamic manner,'' Joe T. Ford, Alltel's chairman and chief executive, 
said in a statement. ``This merger also increases Alltel's wire-line 
and wireless overlap in our communications markets and makes the merged 
company a more formidable competitor in the communications marketplace.'' 
The former Lincoln Telephone and Telegraph, Aliant has long been one 
of the better regional service providers, said Salvatore Muoio, an 
analyst with S. Muoio &AMP; Co. in New York. ``This is one of my favorite 
telephone franchises in the country. They really dominate the whole 
state and are somewhat impervious to competition. It's a nice deal 
for Alltel.'' Alltel also said Friday that it had agreed to acquire 
the Durango Cellular Telephone Co. operations in the Durango, Colo., 
area. The Durango's service area in southwestern Colorado is adjacent 
to Alltel's wireless coverage in northern New Mexico. Terms of the 
transaction were not disclosed. In July, Alltel completed the $4.2 
billion acquisition of 360 Communications Co., the former cellular 
business of the Sprint Corp. Alltel, which has made more than 250 
acquisitions since the 1950s, began as a rural phone company, but 
has branched out into cellular service, and recently into long-distance 
and Internet services.
