Turning now to the hours other top news story. In Iraq a third night 
of US and British air strikes is now underway as part of Operation 
Desert Fox. The largest US military operation in the Persian Gulf 
region since Operation Desert Storm nearly eight years ago. Earlier 
today at the US Defense Department, reporters were briefed on the 
military operation so far. The nations top military officer, Army 
General Hugh Shelton said Friday's mission will deliver bombs to more 
than 75 Iraqi targets. That is more than Thursday's bombing raids 
which he explained were in escalation of the initial attacks. In contrast 
to the first night's actions which involved primarily Naval and Marine 
strike aircraft and ship launched Tomahawks, yesterday's strikes were 
an outstanding example of joint and combined warfare with US Navy, 
US Air Force, US Marine Corps. aircraft joining our British counterparts 
in coordinated air strikes. There were more than 200 strike and strike 
support sorties flown last night including the first combat operations 
of the B-1 Bomber. Most of you saw some large explosions around Baghdad 
yesterday and many of you correctly surmised that those were caused 
by air launched cruise missiles launched from B-52 aircraft. Navy 
ships also launched additional Tomahawk missiles at targets in Iraq. 
Although I will not get into the specific numbers and types of cruise 
missiles launched to date, I can tell you that the total number of 
air launched and ship launched cruise missiles for this operation 
thus far now exceed the total number expended during all of Operation 
Desert Storm. General Hugh Shelton briefing reporters at the Pentagon 
earlier Friday. At that same briefing US Secretary of Defense William 
Cohen again refused to say when Operation Desert Fox will end or whether 
it might escalate to include daylight bombing. We are not going to 
indicate what the timeframe of this operation is. We are proceeding 
according to our plan. It is going reasonably well. We are satisfied 
with the way it is being carried out and executed and we will have 
to just take it day by day. In addition to bombs, the US military 
has also been dropping three kinds of leaflets. Many in the Southern 
region of the country addressed to Iraqi soldiers telling them not 
to worry about being targeted unless they are supporting the Baghdad 
regime.
