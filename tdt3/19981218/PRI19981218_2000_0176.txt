For the first time this century, the House of Representatives is considering 
the impeachment of the President. Bill Clinton faces charges of perjury, 
abuse of power and obstruction of justice. The World's Owen Fay reports 
from Washington. OWEN FAY : The House of Representatives will decide 
Saturday morning whether or not to impeach Bill Clinton. The Republican 
and Democrat leadership teams agreed to a timetable which will give 
members ample time to make the case for or against the President, 
before members break for the evening and reconvene at 9:00 a.m. tomorrow. 
The Democrats are continuing to press the case that the President 
deserves censure, not impeachment, but the latest head count suggests 
they are not convincing undeclared Republicans. It's thought now that 
three of the four articles of impeachment will be passed when the 
votes are tallied on Saturday. For the World, I'm Own Fay in Washington.
