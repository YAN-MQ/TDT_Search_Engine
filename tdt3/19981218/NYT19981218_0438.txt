Every so often, late at night, David Woodland steals away to the den 
of his home in Aberdeen, Wash., so that he can check stock prices 
on the Internet. Woodland, a 68-year-old retired insurance salesman, 
delights at how, with the click of a mouse, he can tap into the facts 
and fortunes of Wall Street. ``If I get a bright idea late at night,'' 
Woodland said, ``I go into the office, fire up the computer and put 
a buy or sell order in.'' In a little town near Kitty Hawk, N.C., 
Nick Van Lear, 70, is also logging into the World Wide Web, checking 
his stock portfolio on Microsoft Investor and plotting his next market 
move. Van Lear, a retired corporate executive, spends a few hours 
a day online. ``I gave up golf,'' he said. ``I thought it was right 
for me before I retired, but then I realized it took up too much time. 
Now I've discovered a new hobby.'' While online trading is popularly 
regarded as the province of day traders in their 20s and 30s, jumping 
in and out of the market to make quick profits, it is now being invaded 
by millions of people like Woodland and Van Lear _ seasoned investors 
who bring much larger accounts and more stability to this fast-growing 
corner of the markets. Microsoft Corp. says more than 20 percent of 
the people who use its popular Microsoft Investor software are older 
than 50. And E(ASTERISK)Trade, the fast-growing online brokerage firm, 
says a quarter of its customers are over 55, up from 19 percent in 
June 1997. ``This is a big, big part of the market,'' said Joe Ricketts, 
chairman of Ameritrade Holdings, another large online brokerage firm. 
``I thought it would take a generation for online investing to permeate 
society, but it is happening much faster than we ever dreamed of.'' 
Older Americans' new interest in online investing has been felt on 
Wall Street; after all, no other group of Americans has so much money 
tied up in the stock market, and no other group has so much time to 
devote to finances. So traditional brokerage firms are scrambling 
to hold an important pool of customers. ``Our average client's age 
is in the upper 50s, so that is a large part of our client base,'' 
said Ellen Breslow, director of individual retirement planning services 
at Salomon Smith Barney. Indeed, online investors 55 and older are 
typically well-educated and wealthy, according to At Plan, a market 
research firm that tracks consumer behavior on the Web. About 66 percent 
have college degrees; 35 percent have postgraduate degrees; about 
23 percent have incomes of $100,000 or more (compared with 18 percent 
for the broader adult population), and 28 percent manage an investment 
portfolio worth more than $250,000. ``In the last 18 months, we've 
seen a real surge in the older generation,'' said Blake Darcey, chief 
executive pf DLJ Direct, the fast-growing online brokerage unit of 
Donaldson, Lufkin &AMP; Jenrette, based in Jersey City, N.J. ``We 
had people putting in $30,000, but now there are people bringing in 
$1 million.'' The low cost of doing business online _ now as little 
as $7 a trade _ and the excitement of riding a bull market are the 
lures for many older investors _ just as they are for the young. Plus, 
older investors are taking up the cyberspace totem of ``empowerment.'' 
They are dismissing their full-service brokers, who offer research 
and investment advice but often charge more than $100 a trade, and 
instead are picking their own stocks, after downloading companies' 
annual reports and other research basics. ``These things are incredible 
tools, now in the hands of an individual investor,'' said Carol Potts, 
56, a retired crafts designer in Santa Barbara, Calif. ``There's no 
reason for me to have a financial adviser. I'm very analytical, and 
I like to get involved in research.'' For many such investors, the 
Internet is making them bolder. According to a survey this fall of 
630 people over 50 by Charles Schwab &AMP; Co., many older investors 
say the Internet has made them more confident about their investments 
and more willing to trust their own judgment. But such confidence 
may also cause some to gamble away their retirement nest eggs, financial 
experts warn. ``Frankly, for many this is like online gambling,'' 
said Jeremy Siegel, a professor of finance at the Wharton School of 
the University of Pennsylvania. ``It's almost like being at the blackjack 
table. People can get in and out immediately, and with a profit. And 
they can reverse their bet at any time.'' Of course, such a warning 
holds for investors of any age. But if stocks enter a bear market, 
Siegel said, it could prove particularly disastrous for retirees, 
who are so dependent on their savings. Other financial experts warn 
that older investors online could be vulnerable to stock fraud. The 
Securities and Exchange Commission in late October accused 44 stock 
promoters of fraudulently recommending stocks on the Internet, and 
regulators are concerned that older Americans are particularly vulnerable 
to such schemes. ``Older Americans have long been a favorite target 
of con artists _ and the Internet is the newest high-tech way for 
crooks to pick investors' pockets,'' said Denise Voigt Crawford, former 
president of the North American Securities Administration Association, 
a band of state regulatory agencies. The rush of seniors to online 
investing begins, of course, with desktops and Internet access. The 
Schwab survey found that 40 percent of people over 50 had a home computer, 
up from 29 percent three years ago, and that 70 percent of those had 
Internet access at home, up from 17 percent in 1995. Jupiter Communications, 
which tracks new media, says more than 7 million people 55 or older 
were online this year, up from 3.8 million just two years ago. By 
2002, the number is expected to grow to nearly 11 million. ``The stereotypes 
really don't fit,'' said Fran Middleton, 70, a founder of Senior Net, 
a San Francisco group devoted to bringing technology to people over 
50. ``If a large senior center opens and they say, `We're going to 
have classes on computers,' they're swamped. I see this time and time 
again. They'd say, `We have chairs for 25,' and 200 people would turn 
up.'' ``If you're at home, you get calls all times of the day: `Do 
I have a stock for you,''' said Len Bovarnick, a retired entrepreneur 
who now divides his time between Norwood, Mass., and West Palm Beach, 
Fla. ``Well, I don't want these people to call. I can do it myself.'' 
Wall Street has certainly noticed the graying of cyberspace. DLJ Direct 
has created a special category for wealthy investors, most of whom 
are older. These customers have special privileges like access to 
initial public offerings and proprietary Wall Street research. Discover 
Brokerage, a unit of Morgan Stanley Dean Witter, is now offering Treasury 
securities online because of demand from its older customers. ``We 
have definitely seen an aging of our client base,'' said Tom O'Connell, 
executive vice president of Discover. While Merrill Lynch, the nation's 
largest brokerage firm, has no plans to offer discount online trading, 
it is preparing to allow customers who pay an annual management fee 
to make a set number of trades over the Internet. And Schwab, the 
giant discount broker and one of the Web's earliest and most ardent 
advocates, has teamed up with Seniornet to train older investors how 
to invest online. The growth of online investing, of course, coincides 
with one of the greatest bull markets in history, the explosion of 
mutual funds and investing clubs, and a mania for hot Internet stocks 
like Yahoo and Amazon.com. In a time of golden returns, everyone is 
a pro, and as a result, people of all ages are dismissing their brokers, 
managing their own money and doing their own research. Online trading 
has nearly doubled in each of the last two years and now accounts 
for about 10 percent of all stock trades, retail and institutional, 
according to Bill Burnham, an online analyst at Credit Suisse First 
Boston. Don Gimpel, 69, and Orvis Adams, 73, are two such investors, 
and they are basking in the glow of a great market, casting about 
the Net for information about stocks. Gimpel, a retired engineer, 
likes to hand out a 40-page document filled with his favorite investment 
sites on the Web, more than 500 of them. For instance, he logs onto 
the personal Web site of Edward Yardeni, the chief economist of Deutsche 
Bank Securities; he also tracks monthly economic trends and pulls 
Federal Reserve data off the Web. ``There's no excuse for flying blind 
anymore,'' Gimpel said. ``The data are here.'' While Adams trades 
through National Discount Brokers, which offers online trading, Gimpel, 
like a number of older investors, uses the Web to do research and 
then telephones a full-service broker. Some older investors say they 
like the comfort of having a broker available in emergencies. Dwight 
Bale, 69, a retired Boeing aircraft inspector in Auburn, Wash., is 
another who keeps a foothold in both investing worlds. ``If something 
goes wrong, I can go pound my fist on a desk and say, `I want my money 
back,''' he said. Still, the danger, said Siegel of the Wharton School, 
is that investors who use the Web can imagine that they have a great 
advantage over others even though millions of individuals and institutions 
also have access to up-to-the-minute data, on and off the Web. ``You 
get this herd mentality,'' Siegel said. ``But don't forget, everyone 
knows more. You may have an edge over the past, but you may not have 
an edge over everyone else. And if everyone knows more, it means it's 
already computed in the price.'' That is part of the argument of full-service 
brokers, who say their business is not in jeopardy. People value knowledge 
and sound advice, they say, even if it comes at a premium _ and that 
is not about to change. Advisory services include estate planning, 
management of personal trusts and information on other complex topics, 
said Ms. Breslow of Salomon Smith Barney. ``The kind of advice we 
give you're not going to find on a Web site somewhere,'' she said. 
John Steffens, vice chairman of Merrill Lynch, said: ``We think advice 
is our business. And the transaction is the least important part of 
the business. There's nothing inherently wrong with trading on the 
Internet, but the concept of trading all you want is how it's being 
positioned.'' The ads for online trading services, Steffens said, 
``are `Let's get a hunch and bet a bunch' or `More trading is better' 
_ they're positioning it as entertainment.'' He added: ``Many of us 
know it's not so simple. It's very hard to beat the S&AMP;P; very 
few pros beat the S&AMP;P.'' Regulators are also watching online trading 
carefully. Mary Schapiro, president of the regulatory arm of the National 
Association of Securities Dealers, which operates the Nasdaq market, 
shares a growing concern about suggestions that fast money can be 
made by pointing and clicking. ``It's easy to push the button, but 
it's not easy to invest,'' she said. ``The risk with a senior citizen 
is if they lose a significant part of their money, they may not be 
able to earn it back.'' For that reason, the association, while in 
favor of the growth of online investing, is thinking about questions 
of ``suitability'' _ whether online investors are making trades that 
are suitable for their personal financial situations. At a full-service 
broker, such trades, in theory at least, would be reviewed for their 
appropriateness. Online, they may go unchecked _ and, in fact, may 
be fueled by chat rooms, some of which are supported by online brokerage 
firms that say they offer no advice. ``Suitability is not an issue,'' 
said Christos Cotsakos, chief executive of E(ASTERISK)Trade. ``The 
brokerage model is predicated on the notion that the customer is dumb. 
But the advice you get is not necessarily right. ``We take our responsibility 
very seriously, and we believe people want to make their own decisions.'' 
Investors like Woodland, the retired insurance salesman _ who also 
balances his checkbook with Quicken personal finance software _ are 
not worried. ``To me, it's the freedom to walk into my little office 
here and take charge of my business,'' he said. ``I'm not in the insurance 
business anymore; I'm in the investing business.'' Woodland logged 
again onto his computer. ``A good half the people I know out here 
in this community are on the Internet,'' he said. And what about his 
children? Did they get him started? He laughed. ``I think I introduced 
them to the Internet,'' he said.
