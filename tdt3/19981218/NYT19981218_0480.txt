A federal grand jury Friday indicted the Suffolk County Republican 
leader, John Powell, on charges that he extorted payoffs from garbage 
haulers at a public landfill and conspired to traffic in stolen trucks. 
The indictment had been expected since Dec. 3, when federal prosecutors 
revealed the results of an investigation centered on the Town of Brookhaven 
in a complaint that named Powell and 18 other defendants, including 
participants in what the authorities said were two separate truck-stealing 
rings. Only 10 defendants were named in the indictment. At least three 
others _ minor figures in the original complaint _ have already agreed 
to plead guilty, according to lawyers involved in the case. At the 
heart of the case in Brookhaven is Joseph Provenzano, who prosecutors 
said headed an organization that stole trucks from as far away as 
Pennsylvania and New Jersey, took them apart at a truck yard he owned 
in Patchogue or at a horse farm in Manorville, then sold them for 
parts or reassembled them for sale as new trucks. Provenzano, who 
is said to have a ``contact'' in the Lucchese crime family, was indicted 
on 11 counts, including operating a chop shop, altering vehicle-identification 
numbers, extortion, witness tampering and corrupt payments to a public 
official. Also charged in the indictment was Joseph Lapienski, a deputy 
commissioner for the Town of Brookhaven, who supervised the landfill 
and who is accused of allowing access to the dump in exchange for 
cash payments from Provenzano and other carters, including one hauling 
company executive who is cooperating with prosecutors. Lapienski, 
who has been suspended from his job, was charged on six counts, including 
corrupt solicitation by a public official. Powell, whom Lapienski 
described as his boss, according to prosecutors, was charged with 
extortion and three counts of conspiracy. The indictment provides 
no more detail about his activities, however, than did the Dec. 3 
arrest complaint, in which he was accused of accepting $20,000 over 
a 10-month period from the same hauling company executive who made 
payments to Lapienski. He was said to have been the ``driving force'' 
behind the purchase of trucks from Provenzano by GP Tech, a trucking 
company owned by Powell's younger brother, George. George Powell has 
not been charged in the case. Benjamin Brafman, John Powell's lawyer, 
Friday accused the U.S. attorney's office of a ``terrible abuse of 
prosecutorial discretion,'' saying the government had sought to ``turn 
an ordinary criminal case into an important criminal case'' by naming 
him despite weak evidence. Federal prosecutors declined to comment.
