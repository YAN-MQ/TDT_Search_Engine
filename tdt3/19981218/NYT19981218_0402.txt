Viewers of Saturday's crucial Jets-Bills game at 12:30 p.m. ET on 
Channel 2 in New York could experience interruptions from CBS News' 
coverage of the impeachment vote in the House of Representatives. 
After debate Friday, the House session was expected to reconvene at 
9 a.m. Saturday. Further debate is expected to take an hour, followed 
by votes on each of the four articles of impeachment. Each vote is 
expected to take 15 to 20 minutes, said Sandy Genelius, a CBS News 
spokeswoman. If the schedule holds, the votes will be over around 
11:30, and the game will not be interrupted. If the debate and votes 
stretch beyond 12:30, Genelius said, ``we will cover the votes.'' 
She declined to say whether CBS would leave the game, or carry it 
simultaneously on a split screen with the House votes. ``There are 
a variety of options, and we'll decide when the situation arises,'' 
Genelius said.
