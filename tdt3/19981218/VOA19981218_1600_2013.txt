The Organization of African Unity Summit on Conflict Resolution ended 
on Friday with a small breakthrough in the effort to end the civil 
war in Congo-Kinshasa. Burkina Faso's President Blaise Compaore says 
the five main combatants in the Congo war have agreed on a framework 
for a cease-fire. VOA's John Pittman has details from Burkina Faso's 
capital. President Compaore announced what he called the pre-agreement 
between the warring sides in Congo-Kinshasa on Friday morning during 
the summit's closing ceremony. Mr. Compaore said the five countries 
which are most heavily involved in the Congolese War had agreed to 
meet again in Zambia at the end of this month to finalize the agreement 
and hopefully sign a cease-fire. The five countries that will meet 
in Zambia's capital Lusaka on December 27 and 28 are Congo-Kinshasa 
and its allies Angola and Zimbabwe and Rwanda and Uganda, the two 
countries which are backing the rebellion against President Laurent 
Kabila. It remains unclear if the rebels will be invited to the Zambia 
talks or if they provided any impute for the pre-agreement. John Pittman, 
VOA News, Ouagadougou.
