Some 200 U.S. soldiers arrived in Kuwait Friday, boosting the number 
of American forces in this small Gulf state to 5,000. The troops will 
be deployed in battle-ready positions along the Kuwaiti-Iraqi border 
on Saturday, U.S. military spokesman Col. Ron Williams said. Kuwait 
fears that Iraq will retaliate for the current air strikes by U.S. 
and British forces. Some of the warplanes taking part in the raids 
are based in Kuwait. ``It is critically important that we be prepared,'' 
Williams said. The troops that arrived Friday had flown for about 
16 from Fort Stewart, Georgia. Kuwait signed a 10-year defense agreement 
with the U.S. after the 1991 Gulf War that drove Iraqi forces out 
of Kuwait after a seven-month occupation. The U.S. and Britain launched 
the strikes because of Iraq's alleged obstruction of U.N. weapons 
inspectors seeking to verify the elimination of its weapons of mass 
destruction.
