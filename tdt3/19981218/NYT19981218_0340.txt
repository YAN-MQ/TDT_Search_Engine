Lying has consequences. Dire ones. That became all too clear last 
week, as the president, accused of swearing to a lie, found his credibility 
shattered and his every move and motive suspect. What applies to political 
leaders applies equally to business leaders. When Bill Gates appears 
to dance around the truth under oath in the Microsoft antitrust trial, 
his credibility, too, takes blows. But actions of admired leaders 
like Gates and Clinton can do damage far beyond their own reputations. 
When a culture of lying with impunity is perceived to have taken hold 
at the top, it bodes ill for behavior in the rest of an organization. 
``As long as there's this raging ambiguity and there's no accountability, 
people will start generating more and more lax responses to morally 
ambiguous situations,'' said Steven Berglas, a management consultant 
and a clinical psychologist at the Harvard Medical School. ``Most 
people will start lowering standards for what's tolerable. And that 
manifests itself in people going along with what's being reinforced. 
People are going to lie for expediency.'' Now we are not talking here 
about a failure to tell every bit of the truth every waking minute, 
a feat that no mortal manages. Success in modern life is next to impossible 
without the maneuvering room afforded by a bit of calculated vagueness 
here and a strategically bitten tongue there. ``Not telling the full 
truth is different from outright lying,'' said Joseph L. Badaracco 
Jr., professor of business ethics at the Harvard Business School and 
author of ``Defining Moments: When Managers Must Choose Between Right 
and Right'' (Harvard Business School Press, 1997). ``If you're going 
to run a big company or run the country, you can't put all your cards 
on the table; that's simply naive. ``Life is a series of different 
games,'' he continued, ``and you sort of play by the rules'' when 
it comes to levels of candor in different circumstances. Even fresh-faced 
business school students appear to distinguish between posturing and 
outright lying. In a recent survey at Ohio State and Harvard, MBA 
students were asked to rate from 1 (bad) to 7 (good) the ethical appropriateness 
of various negotiating tactics. The students gave a rating of 5.84 
to ``making an opening demand that is far greater than what one really 
hopes to settle for.'' But they gave a much lower score, 1.99, to 
``intentionally misrepresenting factual information to your opponent 
in order to support your negotiating arguments or position.'' There 
are also times when telling the whole truth is simply cruel, as when 
a doctor can choose whether to tell a dying patient in clinical detail 
how his health will decay. ``There's great room for discretion, for 
knowing when not to speak,'' said Sissela Bok, author of ``Lying: 
Moral Choice in Public and Private Life'' (Vintage Books, 1989). But 
discretion was not the better part of Gates' or Clinton's valor. Spinning 
or denying uncomfortable facts and professing not to understand the 
definitions of simple English words _ Gates wondered what ``concerned'' 
meant, and Clinton famously construed ``is'' _ were more their pattern. 
``From a managerial point of view, you should have a strong prejudice 
toward being clear, direct and honest,'' because lying ``becomes a 
bad habit,'' Badaracco said. ``You might get caught. You set a bad 
example. The people who work with you probably aren't dumb; they'll 
copy what you do.'' Can either Clinton or Gates expect the whole truth 
from the people who work for them? A leadership policy of ``Do as 
I say, not as I do'' cuts no ethical ice. And it probably wouldn't 
work anyway. Once a leader blurs rules about what is acceptable _ 
say, during sworn testimony on national TV _ then no one knows the 
boundaries any more. Many in the rank and file will conclude that 
they are free to, and perhaps ought to, emulate the boss. Alas, hubris 
often blinds powerful leaders and their followers to the seriousness 
of the damage. In the Clinton case, politicians fret most about the 
power calculus of impeachment and the presidency; in the Microsoft 
case, executives worry most about competition, innovation and monopoly 
power. But isn't there something much more important to fear _ that 
each sworn lie by an admired leader will make us one measure more 
a nation of liars? Jeffrey L. Seglin is a visiting fellow at Harvard 
University's Center for the Study of Values in Public Life. His column 
on business ethics will appear the third Sunday of each month. E-mail
