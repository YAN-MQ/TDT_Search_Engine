British tycoon Richard Branson, Chicago millionaire Steve Fossett 
and teammate Per Lindstrand, blessed by good winds and good weather, 
lifted off Friday morning, hoping to steer the world's largest balloon 
around the globe. The 12-ton, 200-foot-high ICO Global Challenge, 
under escort of Moroccan helicopters, climbed 600 feet a minute through 
a cloudless sky after being cut loose from a Moroccan air force base. 
``The tricky part is getting through the first 24 hours,'' Branson 
said shortly before liftoff, delayed by two hours. ``After that we 
can start to relax and enjoy the flight.'' This was Branson's fifth 
try to be the first person to make the round-the-world balloon voyage. 
Branson and his colleagues, all wearing silver jumpsuits, expressed 
confidence in the trip which could last from eight days to nearly 
three weeks. However, the U.S. missile strike on Iraq has complicated 
the task, Branson said. ``This flight around the world would have 
taken 9 and a half days, but for the Iraqi problem,'' Branson told 
reporters. ``Now, we will be happy to complete the voyage in 10-20 
days.'' The missile strike means the team will have to find the winds 
to take them north of Iraq through Turkey instead of cutting over 
Saudi Arabia. The balloon was expected to leave Moroccan territory 
later today for neighboring Algeria. Branson secured permission from 
97 countries for overflights and had only four refusals -- Iran, Iraq, 
Russia and North Korea, said Mike Johnson, a spokesman for ICO Global, 
a mobile telephone company supporting the trip. The tycoon of the 
Virgin group said he planned to enter the United States near San Francisco. 
``We're going to go under the bridge,'' he joked Thursday, referring 
to the Golden Gate. Entertainers from throughout this North African 
kingdom were on hand for the event, singing, dancing and playing traditional 
drums, as if to help see the huge balloon into the heavens. Fossett 
has made four tries to ring the globe, the last one ending when his 
Solo Spirit was ripped apart in a violent storm off Australia. Branson 
has tried, and failed, four times to become the first person to trek 
the globe in a balloon. The only time he managed to take off, in January 
1997, his balloon crashed a day after takeoff, landing in the Algerian 
desert. Johnson said the crew was more confident this time because 
of the better technology used to build the balloon, including a Kevlar 
canopy over the crew's pressurized capsule. Kevlar is used for bulletproof 
vests. At least three other balloon crews have been waiting for favorable 
weather to launch their balloon -- from Albuquerque, New Mexico, Loves 
Park, Illinois and the Swiss Alps. Yet another team is to take off 
next month from Alice Springs, Australia.
