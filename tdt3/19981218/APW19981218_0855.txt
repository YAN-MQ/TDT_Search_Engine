The government said Friday it was upbeat about the Basque peace process 
three months into a ceasefire by the separatist group ETA, and announced 
a concession on a long-standing ETA demand dealing with its members 
behind bars. Prime Minister Jose Maria Aznar repeated a call for ETA 
to transform its open-ended truce into a definitive one ending a 30-year 
pro-independence campaign that has claimed nearly 800 lives. ``It 
is the cornerstone on which we can build the process of normalization,'' 
Aznar said, reading from a statement. Although ETA has yet to renounce 
violence, Aznar said: ``The government is in a position to conclude 
that there is still the possibility that the current situation of 
an open-ended ceasefire can be consolidated.'' He did not elaborate 
or take questions from reporters. But government spokesman Josep Pique 
disclosed later that ``significant contacts'' were at the root of 
Aznar's optimism. Pique did not say if these contacts were with ETA 
itself or the legal party seen as its political wing, Herri Batasuna. 
In November Aznar said he had authorized preliminary talks with ETA 
to determine whether it was prepared to renounce violence permanently. 
Last week Pique said there had been official contact with people close 
to ETA but insisted it was ``not significant.'' Pique also said that 
because of the new contacts, the government will move 21 ETA inmates 
from far-flung prisons to jails closer to their home region. ETA has 
long demanded that the more than 500 ETA prisoners held in Spanish 
jails be transferred to the Basque country itself, or at least closer 
to it. The government keeps them scattered around Spain to avoid their 
plotting behind bars. The interior ministry said the 21 will be transferred 
from the Canary Islands off the coast of West Africa, the Balearic 
islands in the Mediterranean, or from Ceuta and Melilla, Spanish enclaves 
on the northern coast of Morocco. They will be sent to jails in the 
south of mainland Spain starting right away. Since ETA started observing 
its ceasefire on September 18, Aznar had been under pressure from 
both hard-line and moderate Basque nationalists, and even the mainstream 
Socialist opposition party, to keep the peace process alive by making 
a significant gesture on the prisoner issue. In late October the government 
moved four ailing ETA prisoners to the Basque country itself but this 
was criticized as insufficient. Two mainstream Basque parties said 
the new transfers were not enough either and that Aznar needed to 
take much bolder action to move the region toward peace. ``If Aznar 
thinks that taking 21 prisoners out of a group of more than 500 and 
transferring them to the south of the peninsula is pulling off something 
big, he does not know what country or what problem he is dealing with,'' 
said the leader of one of those parties, Carlos Garaikoetxa of Eusko 
Alkartasuna. Aznar insists that after his offer of talks, the ball 
is now in ETA's court, saying the peace process cannot advance in 
earnest without a permanent end to separatist violence. And even so, 
he and other officials have said the government is willing to discuss 
prisoner transfers and other issues involving ETA inmates, ruling 
out talks on ETA's stated demand of independence.
