Anxious to avoid the image that earned the Palestinians pariah status 
during the Gulf War, authorities moved quickly Friday to end anti-U.S. 
demonstrations and shut down media broadcasting pro-Iraqi sentiments. 
The Gaza police chief declared a ban on further pro-Iraq demonstrations 
and ordered the arrest of a leader of a pro-Iraqi radical group. ``All 
the pro-Iraq demonstrations are illegal and anyone organizing and 
participating in them will be considered a violator of the law,'' 
Ghaza Jabali said in a statement issued Friday night. Protesters throughout 
the West Bank and Gaza Strip gathered after Friday morning Muslim 
prayers to protest the joint U.S.-British airstrikes on Iraq. In Manger 
Square in Bethlehem _ where just days ago, U.S. President Bill Clinton 
received a rapturous greeting _ marchers chanted ``Saddam, Saddam, 
our beloved,'' and ``Death to America, Death to Clinton, Death to 
Britain!'' Anticipating the demonstration, authorities made sure to 
strip the city of the U.S. flags that had garnished electricity poles 
during the Clinton visit. Protesters found a few left-over plastic 
U.S. flags, and wrapped them around their shoes in a sign of contempt. 
Palestinian security briefly detained an Associated Press photographer 
for taking pictures of the burning of a U.S. flag, and released him 
on condition that he not take pictures of other anti-U.S. actions. 
After the demonstration, marchers threw stones at Israeli troops guarding 
the entrance to the city. The troops responded with rubber bullets 
and tear gas. Fifteen protesters were injured. The Palestinian leadership 
is anxious to curb the unmitigated backing Palestinians gave Saddam 
Hussein during the 1991 Gulf War _ a stance that set back the Palestinian 
cause in the West. Clinton's visit earlier this week _ to salvage 
peace accords with Israel _ was seen as tantamount to recognition 
of Palestinian aspirations to statehood. Palestinian leaders are anxious 
to cultivate the new friendship. The Palestinian Authority has issued 
careful statements regretting the strikes, but urging Saddam to cooperate 
with U.N. inspectors seeking to contain Iraq's weapons-of-mass-destruction 
capability. The authority's Cabinet announced after its meeting Friday 
night that it was sending an envoy to ``brother Iraq'' to explore 
a peaceful solution to the crisis. Notably, the statement did not 
condemn the U.S.-British attacks. In an attempt to quell an anti-American 
demonstration organized in Gaza City by the Popular Front for the 
Liberation of Palestine, police beat back some of the 500 participants 
with clubs and guns, injuring three who were taken to a local hospital. 
Police invited four PFLP leaders ``to have a cup of tea'' after the 
demonstration and promptly placed them under arrest. Among them was 
Jamil Majdawali, the top PFLP official in the Palestinian-controlled 
areas. The police arrested eight Palestinian journalists who covered 
the demonstrations, witnesses said. One of them, who is also an American, 
was soon released. In another sign of Palestinian efforts to contain 
anti-U.S. sentiment, police shut down two TV stations and a radio 
station in Ramallah and three TV stations in Bethlehem. There was 
no official explanation for the shutdown, but the TV stations had 
broadcast footage of the pro-Iraq demonstrations, pro-Iraqi interviews 
and nationalist music. The Voice of Peace and Love had devoted its 
broadcasts on Thursday to a popular nationalist Iraqi singer. Police 
also sealed the offices of two foreign news agencies in the Gaza Strip.
