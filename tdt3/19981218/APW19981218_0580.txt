Consolee Mukarushegura left no stone unturned in the two-year search 
for her children lost in Congo. On Friday, she cried out when the 
two recognized her in a crowded airport terminal in Kigali. ``I can't 
explain how I feel,'' Mukarushegura said, holding back tears. ``I 
didn't know if they were alive. They didn't know if I was alive.'' 
The 39-year-old mother lost Jean-Pierre, 12, and Jean-Paul, 10, in 
1996 when Rwandan-backed Congolese rebels attacked the refugee camp 
in which she was living with hundreds of thousands of other Rwandan 
Hutus in what was then eastern Zaire. The camps were used by former 
Hutu soldiers and militiamen _ who fled Rwanda fearing reprisals for 
the 1994 massacre of more than 500,000 people _ to regroup and launch 
attacks against Rwanda's new Tutsi-led government. Mukarushegura was 
among 1 million Hutu civilians used by the Hutu fighters as human 
shields against the rebel attack. ``Jean-Pierre and Jean-Paul fled 
the firing, and I stayed behind,'' she said. ``I came back to Rwanda 
with my other two children and have been looking for them ever since.'' 
At first, the Red Cross, which facilitated the reunion, told Mukarushegura 
it could not help because it did not know where to look for her children. 
The British charity, Save the Children, said it couldn't carry out 
a search in Congo because of deteriorating security. And in August, 
another civil war erupted in Congo. This time, Rwandan-backed ethnic 
Congolese Tutsis and disaffected Congolese soldiers accused President 
Laurent Kabila of misrule, ethnic warmongering and recruiting Rwandan 
Hutu fighters. ``I knew I had to do it on my own,'' Mukarushegura 
said. In May, a friend of hers returned to Rwanda with news that her 
two sons had been seen in Walikale, a small trading town in the northeastern 
Masisi forest. Mukarushegura sent a letter to Walikale with a trader 
and soon got the confirmation. Jean-Pierre and Jean-Paul said they 
had been living with a Congolese family in Walikale until last week, 
when they brought them to a Belgian Roman Catholic priest in Goma, 
on the border with Rwanda. The priest handed the boys over to the 
Red Cross mission. On Friday they boarded a plane to Kigali where 
Mukarushegura was waiting. Since 1996, when more than 1 million Hutus 
returned to Rwanda, the Red Cross says it has reunited more than 700 
children who had gotten separated from their parents during the massive 
return. A total of 28,993 unaccompanied children have been registered 
in Rwanda alone. The Red Cross says it has reunited 25,154 of them 
with their families, sometimes using photos of the young ones who 
could not remember their home. A single mother, Mukarushegura said 
she lost her husband in a 1994 killing. She said her salary from working 
at a Kigali hotel will not be enough to send children to school. ``But 
we're together,'' she said.
