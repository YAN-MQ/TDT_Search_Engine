Arab governments and newspapers fiercely criticized the U.S. air strikes 
on Baghdad Friday as thousands of protesters in Arab capitals shouted 
angry slogans against the United States. The message from officials 
and editorials was that unleashing missiles at the heart of Baghdad 
would do more harm to the Iraqi people than to President Saddam Hussein. 
On Arab streets, demonstrators condemned the attacks as an attempt 
by U.S. President Bill Clinton to squirm out of the scandal over his 
sexual relationship with former White House intern Monica Lewinsky. 
``For Monica's sake, Iraqi children are dying,'' read a sign waved 
during a protest at Cairo's al-Azhar mosque, one of the most famous 
in the Arab world. Syrian Parliament Speaker Abdul-Kader Qaddoura 
said the U.S. strikes ``increased the suffering and pain'' of Iraq's 
people, ``particularly its children and civilians.'' ``We ... condemn 
and denounce this attack and call on the international community to 
condemn and halt it immediately,'' he said in a speech to the Parliament. 
Sheik Zayed bin Sultan Al Nahyan, president of the United Arab Emirates, 
expressed his ``great concern over the military action against Iraq 
and its repercussions on the Iraqi people,'' the Emirates news agency 
reported late Thursday. It also quoted a government spokesman as saying: 
``The terrible operation we have seen on television ... is beyond 
comprehension and is unacceptable.'' In the Egyptian capital Cairo, 
hundreds of worshipers gathered at the al-Azhar mosque to shout demands 
for Arabs to defend Iraq against the American onslaught. ``Leaders 
of the country, let us go to holy war,'' the protesters chanted. The 
crowd of demonstrators briefly broke through a cordon of scores of 
police surrounding the mosque before being shoved back onto the Al-Azhar 
grounds. Sheik Mohamed Tantawi, leader of Al-Azhar, also urged solidarity 
with the Iraqis in his sermon. ``Stand by the Iraqi people or we will 
be hit by God's damnation,'' he preached. Inside the mosque, there 
were shouts urging attacks on American interests and belittling comments 
about Clinton's motive for the repeated missile strikes on Iraq. ``Iraq 
is suffering because of an American whore and a big baby boy,'' said 
Mohammed Hassan, 20, a medical student. Similar protests were staged 
in the capitals of Lebanon, Jordan and Yemen, where 15,000 people 
people marched through the streets of San`a shouting, ``America is 
the enemy of the Muslims.'' In countries closely allied to the United 
States _ such as Egypt and Jordan _ authorities brought out massive 
security forces to prevent demonstrations from turning violent. About 
300 police ringed a demonstration of 30-40 people at a mosque near 
the U.S. Embassy in Cairo. In the Jordanian capital Amman, about 500 
demonstrators were surrounded by an equal number of police. At Amman's 
University of Jordan mosque, the protesters called for an Arab revolt 
against the United States. ``Saddam ... if you want commandos we are 
ready'' and ``Syria, Jordan, Iraq _ revolt and make Clinton go to 
hell'' were among slogans chanted. In non-Arab Iran, demonstrators 
at Tehran's Palestine Square called for international intervention 
to stop ``the massacre of innocent people'' in Iraq _ traditionally 
an enemy of the Iranians. In Lebanon's capital Beirut, about 2,500 
people staged a sit-in outside U.N. headquarters. The protesters waved 
Iraqi flags and shouted, ``Beloved Iraq, strike Tel Aviv,'' the Israeli 
coastal city. Ghassan Tweini, publisher of the Lebanon's leading daily 
An-Nahar, urged a summit of Arab leaders to demand a halt to attacks 
on Iraq. He wrote that the attacks were misguided in trying to oust 
Saddam. ``Leave it to the Iraqis, not the Americans, not the Turks 
nor the Kurds nor the Israelis ... to decide the fate of the Iraqi 
regime,'' Tweini wrote in his paper's Friday edition. The Beirut newspaper 
As-Safir also said that the American attacks would give Saddam ``a 
new lease on life.'' Most Iraqi opposition parties joined in the criticism 
of the attacks. The main exception to a united Arab front was Kuwait, 
whose invasion by Iraq in 1990 led to the following year's Gulf War 
and eight years of trade sanctions on Iraq. Sheik Sabah al-Ahmed al-Sabah, 
the Kuwaiti foreign minister and deputy prime minister, told the daily 
Al-Rai Al-Amm the current crisis was between Iraqi and the United 
Nations. ``We have nothing to do with it whatsoever,'' he was quoted 
as saying. Fouad al-Hashem, columnist for Al-Watan daily in Kuwait, 
wrote Friday that he hoped the bodies of Saddam, his sons and wife 
and Iraqi Deputy Prime Minister Tariq Aziz ``will be hanging naked 
from street lights all over Baghdad'' by the time the U.S. attacks 
end.
