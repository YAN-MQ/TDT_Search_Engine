A remote island in the middle of the Indian Ocean is playing a key 
role in the latest air strikes against Iraq is the focus of our geography 
quiz today. It's owned by the British but used by the U.S. Navy. In 
fact it's where B-52 bombers have been taking off. Only 17 square 
miles, this coral island also played a crucial role in the Gulf war 
and in the United Nations intervention in Somalia back in 1992. You 
will find both American and British flags flying here, but there is 
no town and no permanent civilian population. That all became a thing 
of the past when the British converted the island into a military 
base. So where is this coral island used as a key military staging 
stop? We'll give you the answer this hour.
