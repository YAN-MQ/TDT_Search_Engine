At the White House, there's now a recognition the house vote is lost. 
And the president and his advisers are trying to come up with a strategy 
for the Senate trial. The president did get some support from close 
at home. Today, Hillary finally emerged on the issue. NBC's Claire 
Shipman, at the White House tonight. Tom, there is no hope here tonight 
anything will change the vote. Not even a last-minute boost from the 
first lady which caught many of the president's advisers by surprise. 
After weeks of noticeable silence on the subject, the first lady came 
to her husband's defense. I think that a vast majority of Americans 
share my approval and pride in the job that the president's been doing 
for our country. We in our country ought to practice reconciliation. 
And we ought to bring our country together. And we ought to end divisiveness. 
But as the White House prepared for the inevitable, not everyone was 
talking reconciliation. The vice president, in a radio interview -- 
I'm fighting mad at the way they are carrying out this impeachment 
matter. At an early morning session with reporters, and then at his 
daily briefing, presidential spokesman Joe Lockhart attacked the republicans. 
What you have here is, what I believe, is a cynical, political strategy. 
The central player in the drama only made the briefest of public appearances 
to wave at reporters and send off foreign dignitaries. Hard to believe, 
but his staff says even as he's about to be impeached, he's in a good 
mood and too busy to watch the debate. Most attention here is now 
focused on the looming Senate trial. NBC news has learned that Bill 
Clinton hopes to convince former senator george Mitchell to play a 
central role in his Senate defense. Clinton personally talked about 
the Senate strategy with both Mitchell and his one-time rival, Bob 
Dole, this week. But the immediate worry here calls for resignation 
after the vote. NBC news has learned that tomorrow, after the vote, 
the house minority leadership will travel here to the White House 
to tell the president to keep on fighting, a symbolic contrast to 
a similar trip that republicans made here in 1974 to tell Richard 
Nixon, it was time to go. We've also been told ha the president himself 
will make it plain publicly tomorrow he has no intention of stepping 
down. tom? Claire Shipman at the White House tonight, thapgs very 
much.
