It's acid. It Burns. It travels up. Like a fire in my chest. A terrible 
taste in my throat. If heartburn has you by the throat, you may have 
the toughest heartburn... for this, doctors recommend gaviscon. Only 
regular gaviscon forms a soothing, protective barrier to help keep 
stomach acid down, where it belongs. Mylanta can't. Pepcid ac can't. 
Only gaviscon can. Better. Relief. Sleep.
