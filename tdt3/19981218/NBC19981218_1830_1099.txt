Even longtime Washington watchers cannot remember a week quite like 
this one. As American warplanes bombed Iraq and the house argued bitterly 
over impeachment, there are those new disclosures about the private 
lives of members of Congress beginning with the incoming speaker of 
the house, Bob livingston. More on that tonight from NBC's Lisa Myers. 
With the atmosphere poisonous, and their leader the latest casualty, 
republicans quickly rule the private lives of members off limits in 
the debate. And also from engaging in comparisons of personal conduct 
of sitting members of either house of Congress. Most are still stunned 
by Livingston's admission that he, like the president, committed adultery 
more than once, "I have on occasion strayed from my marriage," he 
says. Even more bizarre, the confession apparently is prompted by 
this man Larry flynt, publisher of "hustler" magazine, who was Flynt 
says four different women provided tips about Livingston in response 
to this ad offering $1 million for evidence of adultery by a member 
of Congress. Believe me, there's more people than him to come yet. 
There's about a dozen of them that are going to bite the dust on this 
issue. Already four house republicans have bitten the dust -- livingston, 
Hyde, Burton and Chenoweth as embarrassing details of their personal 
indiscretions became public. Democrats argue that those with skeletons 
in their own closets have no business judging the president. The hypocrisy 
that is demonstrated by my friends on the opposite side of the aisle 
is absolutely stunning. Republicans say there's a big difference between 
Livingston's misconduct and the president's, and that Clinton is not 
being impeached for adultery. It was the perjury, in a civil rights 
lawsuit, that got the president in trouble. But pollsters say all 
this is likely to reinforce the public's conclusion that many of the 
president's critics are hypocrites. Washington is not the streets 
of Beirut anymore. It's reminiscent of Vietnam after a Napalm attack. 
It's scorched earth. Tonight, in still another bizarre twist, Larry 
Flynt is promising to reveal more information about republicans he 
claims are guilty of adultery. That can only intensify already deep 
anxiety in the Senate that when the president goes on trial, their 
private lives will be next. Lisa Myers, NBC news, Washington.
