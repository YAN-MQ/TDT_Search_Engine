Here's a trivia question. What artist has just pushed U-2 off the 
album charts in Britain? A, Paul McCartney, B, the Spice Girls or 
C, a 12-year old classical soprano. Well if you're a good test taker, 
you probably figured that one out. It is C, the young soprano. Her 
name is Charlotte Church and her debut CD is entitled just in time 
for Christmas, "Voice of an Angel." That album's already gone platinum 
in Britain and tomorrow, Charlotte Church will have a special audience. 
She performs for the Pope at the Vatican. If the Pope's musical tastes 
are at all like most Britons, he's in for a treat. That's 12-year-old 
British singing prodigy Charlotte Church bringing this edition of 
our program to a close.
