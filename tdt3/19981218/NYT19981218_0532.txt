From a distance, it looked like any other wintry day at the broad 
brick firehouse. Someone had spelled out ``Seasons Greetings'' in 
shiny letters across the facade of the station that houses Ladder 
Company 170. A cardboard sign announcing a toy drive flapped in the 
wind. Throughout the morning, the big red garage doors gaped open 
for a procession of firefighters and engines rolling in and out. But 
no one was wearing fire gear and no alarms came in. Many of the firefighters 
keeping warm inside had long since retired. Others had worked at the 
station years ago, before being transferred to other neighborhoods. 
They converged from wherever they were as if summoned by a secret 
alarm Friday, filing in below a flag at half-staff, because they knew 
that three firefighters would never return to the Brooklyn firehouse. 
And on such an unthinkable day, with Christmas only a week off, there 
was no other place they could be. ``We have everybody who has ever 
been in this house inside right now,'' said Lt. Bill Croak, who had 
fought fires alongside the men who were killed: Lt. Joseph Cavilieri 
and firefighters Christopher Bopp and James Bohan. ``We are all sitting 
around and trying to make sense, just like you do when a family member 
dies _ because this is a family.'' The tragedy that engulfed the Canarsie 
firehouse is the kind that many there had experienced only indirectly 
before, as when three firefighters died in a 1994 blaze in SoHo or 
when a fire this year in nearby East New York killed two firefighters. 
But these were their men, and everyone who emerged from the firehouse 
seemed bewildered, blinking into the bright sunlight. ``Look, guys, 
please don't turn on the cameras because I can't talk to you,'' said 
the company's captain, Timothy Joyce, who came out briefly to meet 
with reporters. ``I knew these guys really well, and it's just too 
hard,'' he said, his eyes welling up with tears. ``I could talk for 
a couple of minutes, and then I'd have to walk away.'' At 3 p.m., 
firefighters from a nearby ladder company arrived to drape the firehouse 
with black and purple bunting, an age-old tradition when firefighters 
are killed while on duty. They also carefully took down the season's 
greeting letters and the sign for the toy drive, part of the proceeds 
of which Bohan had helped to deliver Thursday to the pediatrics ward 
at Brookdale Hospital Medical Center. Those who knew the dead firefighters 
said they had all applied to be stationed in Canarsie because it was 
a busy firehouse. They would be assured of doing the dangerous work 
they loved, the men said, and this meant that the three had died doing 
what they loved. But it was little consolation Friday. ``They all 
begged to come here,'' said firefighter Dan McSwiggan, 54, from nearby 
Ladder Company 174, ``and you sometimes wonder why.''
