Hundreds of angry Muslims poured out of mosques Friday and burned 
American flags to protest the bombing of Iraq. ``Resist fascist American 
attacks on Iraq,'' chanted a group of 300 Islamic extremists who set 
the stars-and-stripes ablaze in downtown Dhaka after Friday's prayers. 
Two more protests were held in the same area with demonstrators shouting 
anti-American slogans and expressing support for Iraqi leader Saddam 
Hussein. Bangladesh's liberal government, which has close relations 
with the United States, was reserved in comments on the attacks. ``We 
are observing the situation in Iraq and we will see what the U.N. 
Security Council does,'' Foreign Ministry spokesman Mustafizur Rahman 
said in a telephone interview. Bangladesh is a predominantly Muslim 
nation.
