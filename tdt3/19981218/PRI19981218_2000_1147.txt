Still to come on the World, does Britain back Blair on the Baghdad 
bombs? That story and much more still to come on the World on PRI. 
That's Public Radio International. The World is sponsored by the Capital 
Group Companies, investing throughout the world for individuals and 
institutions. And the World is sponsored by Merck, dedicated to the 
needs of society through pharmaceutical research and consumer education 
to improve the quality of life. Merck, committed to bringing out the 
best in medicine. This is the World. I'm Lisa Mullins.
