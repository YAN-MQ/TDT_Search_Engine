Those military air strikes over Iraq are over, at least for now. Today 
analysts on both sides of the conflict were assessing the damage, 
none mor than the Iraqis. Tonight the final numbers are in. The attack 
lasted 70 hours, almost 100 targets struck. 650 aircraft missions 
or sorties. 415 cruise missiles fired both from Navy ships and air 
borse B-52 bombers aloft. As to the lasting effect of it all we get 
that tonight from NBC news pentagon correspondent Jim Miklaszewski. 
Iraqis digging out from under the rubble today acting more defiant 
than defeated. Pictures of Saddam Hussein himself appear on Iraqi 
TV as to show the world she survived one more U.S. bombing as Iraqis 
play the victim and call americans the villain. They are criminals, 
and this aggression is a criminal aggression. In four straight nights 
of air strikes American forces launched 1,000 bombs and missiles. 
Saddam's special republican guards were primary targets. But Iraq 
claims only 62 military were killed. 180 wounded. There are no firm 
numbers of civilian casualties. At the Pentagon today, commander of 
desert fox MA Gene general Anthony zinni reported that 71% of the 
targets were successfully hit. Eye feel the kinds of things we went 
after. Equipment and infrastructure we were highly successful. But 
he reports there's no evidence that the attacks took out a single 
chemical or biological plant. And Iraq says U.N. weapons inspectors 
will not be let back in the country. I think this is a very feel-good 
campaign, achieving very little of significance. It's estimated the 
operation could cost up to $1 billion. Some in Congress wonter if 
it's worth it. I don't think we did as much as we needed to get done. 
If the point of it was degradation, somebody's going to have to explain 
to me what it is we degraded. Administration officials say the U.S. 
is prepared to strike again if Saddam hussein steps out of line, which 
planes American forces will remain on a Higher state of alert in the 
Persian gulf for as far as the eye can see. Jim Miklaszewski, NBC 
news, the Pentagon.
