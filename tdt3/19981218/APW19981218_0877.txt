Norway's Lasse Kjus bruised Austria's pride for a second time in seven 
days as he overpowered the ``Power Team'' in the Austrians' favorite 
discipline of Alpine skiing, the downhill. The 27-year-old Norwegian, 
a former World Cup and Olympic champion, beat Werner Franz and Hermann 
Maier by a wide margin in Friday's speed race at Val Gardena for his 
his second World Cup downhill victory this season. The Austrians, 
who looked almost unbeatable in the initial World Cup stages as they 
captured super-G, giant slalom and slalom races, were winless in the 
event Austrian skiers and fans care most. Kjus' consecutive downhill 
triumph vaulted the Norwegian skier atop the World Cup overall standings, 
with 413 points, ahead of Austrian Stephan Eberharter who was a distant 
16th in the race. Eberharter slipped to second place with 383 points. 
Maier strangthened his fourth place pocketing 60 points and piling 
up a total of 340 after nine races. Kjus, a 1994 Olympic champion 
in the combined, World Cup overall champion in 1996 and a silver medalist 
in the Olympic downhill at Nagano this year, had a faultless run down 
the icy Saslong course as he clocked an unbeatable time of two minutes, 
2.18 seconds over the 3,495-meter distance. ``My time today was amazing,'' 
said Kjus, who was the only skier to go below 2:03. It was the eighth 
World Cup career win _ the fourth in downhill _ for Kjus, who had 
captured the first speed race of the season at Val D'Isere, France, 
last Saturday. Franz finished 0.91 seconds behind the winner. Maier, 
the defending World Cup champion, trailed Kjus by 1.10 seconds. Maier, 
nicknamed the ``Herminator,'' said he suffered from the too many jumps. 
``I also made lots of mistakes at the bumps. Today's third place is 
like a victory for me, because I lacked experience for doing any better,'' 
he said. Italy's Kristian Ghedina, the defending Val Gardena champion, 
placed fourth ahead of Norway's Kjetil Andre Aamodt. Other top finishers 
included Austrian Andreas Schifferer (6th), Sweden's Patrik Jaerbyn 
(7th) and Hans Kanuss and Pietro Vitalini, who were tied for eighth 
place, 2.02 seconds behind the winner. Canada's Brian Stemmle was 
the top north American finisher in 10th place. Audun Groenvold, a 
former ski jumper who's doing increasingly well in Alpine skiing, 
placed 11th to complete the bright day for the Norwegian colors. The 
race was marred by three bad spills. Young American downhiller Ehlias 
Louis, 23, of Park City, torn the cruciate ligament of his left knee 
in a high-speed fall and was declared out for the rest of the season, 
which includes the World Championships in Vail, Colo., in February. 
Norway's Lasse Paulsen crashed through the finish line, escaped unhurt 
and still placed 13th in a tie with Austrian Hannes Trinkl. French 
late starter David Pretot crashed against safety fences in the upper 
part of the course and was taken away on a toboggan. Organizers said 
Pretot possibly twisted his right knee. Kjus, an all-around skier 
who can pocket World Cup points in all disciplines of Alpine skiing, 
said he won a grueling race ``on an icy track, with a lot of big jumps.'' 
``I was a bit scared before the start. I had a lot of respect for 
the course and this helped me to stay concentrated throughout,' Kajus 
added. ``It was a good day for me. I made no mistakes and I won by 
a big margin. I hope I can ski as well tomorrow ... but others have 
the capacity to fight back,'' the winner said. Friday's race was the 
first of back-to-back downhills in this north Italian valley. It made 
up for the season opener in Whistler Mountain, Canada, canceled by 
bad weather earlier this month. The original Val Gardena downhill, 
the third of the season, is scheduled for Saturday.
