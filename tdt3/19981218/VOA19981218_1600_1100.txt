The Atlanta Falcons have won only one division title in their 33-year 
history. The Falcons meet the Detroit Lions Sunday in Detroit. A win 
would give them that title. The Dallas Cowboys have lost three straight 
games but they can clinch the National Conference East Division Title 
with a win Sunday over the Philadelphia Eagles. The Jacksonville Jaguars 
will have to rely on the arm of third string quarterback Jonathan 
Quinn for Sunday night's game against Minnesota. The Jags will clinch 
the AFC Central title if the Tennessee Oilers lose or tie the Green 
Bay Packers.
