The government said Friday it was upbeat about the Basque peace process 
three months into a ceasefire by the separatist group ETA and announced 
a concession on a long-standing ETA demand. Prime Minister Jose Maria 
Aznar repeated a call for ETA to transform its open-ended truce into 
a definitive one ending a 30-year pro-independence campaign that has 
claimed nearly 800 lives. ``It is the cornerstone on which we can 
build the process of normalization,'' Aznar said, reading from a statement. 
In November Aznar said he had authorized preliminary talks with ETA 
to determine whether it was prepared to renounce violence permanently. 
Last week government spokesman Josep Pique confirmed there had been 
official contact with ETA but he insisted it was ``not significant'' 
and did not elaborate on it. And although the ceasefire has held, 
in recent weeks posters have appeared in Basque cities threatening 
lawmakers of Aznar's center-right Popular Party. Still, Aznar insisted 
Friday that the peace process was on track. ``The government is in 
a position to conclude that there is still the possibility that the 
current situation of an open-ended ceasefire can be consolidated,'' 
he said. Aznar did not elaborate or take questions from reporters. 
In an apparent effort to advance the process, the Interior Ministry 
said earlier Friday that 21 ETA inmates will be moved from far-flung 
prisons to jails closer to their home region. ETA has long demanded 
that the more than 500 ETA prisoners held in Spanish jails be transferred 
to the Basque country itself, or at least closer to it. The government 
keeps them scattered around Spain to avoid their plotting behind bars. 
The ministry said 21 ETA inmates will be transferred from the Canary 
Islands off the coast of West Africa, the Balearic islands in the 
Mediterranean, or from Ceuta and Melilla, Spanish enclaves on the 
northern coast of Morocco. They will be sent to jails in the south 
of mainland Spain starting right away. Since ETA started observing 
its ceasefire on September 18, Aznar had been under pressure from 
both hard-line and moderate Basque nationalists, and even the mainstream 
Socialist opposition party, to keep the peace process alive by making 
a significant gesture on the prisoner issue. In late October the government 
moved four ailing ETA prisoners to the Basque country itself but this 
was criticized as insufficient. Aznar insists that the ball is now 
in ETA's court, saying the peace process cannot advance in earnest 
without a permanent end to separatist violence. And even so, he and 
other officials have said the government is willing to discuss only 
prisoner transfers and other issues involving ETA inmates, ruling 
out talks on ETA's stated demand of independence. In his statement 
Friday Aznar also announced that when parliament reconvenes after 
the holidays he will submit a bill calling for the government to pay 
damages to victims of Basque separatist violence.
