The story in Washington -- One by one, members of the House of Representatives 
are taking to the podium to debate the proposed articles of impeachment 
against president clinton. Some republicans argue the current military 
action in Iraq buttresses the need to remove a president who has "made 
a mockery of the people who are fighting." Many democrats say they 
believe the debate should have been postponed until the hostilities 
are over. They also say impeachment is far too severe a punishment 
for Mr. Clinton. Make no mistake about it. This is a constitutional 
amendment that we are debating, not an impeachment resolution. The 
republicans are crossing out the impeachment standard of high crimes 
and miss demeanors, and they are inserting the words any crime or 
misdemeanor. Republicans argue, in spite of the military action in 
Iraq, the matter should be settled. Georgia congressman Bob Barr one 
of the early people calling for the president's impeachment, points 
out the seriousness of the charges of "high crimes and misdemeanors" 
against the president. As with the air strike the other day, one certainly 
has to question the timing of these things. But regardless of that, 
I think it is important for the American people to recognize that 
we do have a process of domestic constitutional law in this country. 
It's important to move forward with that. And we are not going to 
be drawn off track by either a foreign dictator or a smut peddler.
