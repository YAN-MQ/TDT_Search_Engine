Several people have used the word sure reel today. The impeachment 
debate continues in the House of Representatives at this moment. They 
will debate, have their say well into the evening. Tomorrow morning, 
they will gather again, hear the gavel bang and have a Little more 
debate and in all likelihood, impeach the president of the United 
States.
