Now here is Steve Ember with some news items from the American art 
world. Even though the Academy Award nominations are submitted next 
February and the Oscars are presented in March, there is already talk 
about which films will receive the most acclaim. When director Steven 
Spielberg's World War II epic Saving Private Ryan opened this summer, 
many critics suggested it was the film to beat come Oscar time. Indeed 
the Los Angeles Film Critics Association just named Saving Private 
Ryan best picture of the year and Mr. Spielberg best director. British 
Actor Ian McKellan was named best actor for his portrayal of a director 
in the movie Gods and Monsters. The best actress selection went to 
both Ally Sheedy who plays a photographer in High Art and Fernando 
Montenagro who stars in the Brazilian drama Central Station. The 49 
member Los Angeles Critics Association also chose Billy Bob Thornton 
as best supporting actor and Joan Allen as best supporting actress. 
The best foreign film honor went to the Celebration a Danish film. 
In the remaining days of the year, critics groups from New York, Boston, 
and other cities will also make their selections. Several important 
films are scheduled to open during the next couple of weeks including 
another World War II epic, The Thin Red Line.
