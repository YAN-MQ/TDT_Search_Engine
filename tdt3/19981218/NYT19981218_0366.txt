Democrats insisted that Americans were witnessing nothing less than 
a political coup. Republicans, they cautioned, were exploiting the 
mechanism of impeachment _ and the raw power of their majority in 
the House of Representatives _ to remove a president who had long 
been in their cross hairs. ``Benjamin Franklin spoke of impeachment 
as an alternative to assassination,'' said Rep. Rosa DeLauro, D-Conn. 
``Today, this body is contemplating a constitutional assassination.'' 
Republicans dismissed such dire warnings as diversionary tactics, 
aimed at helping a popular leader evade accountability. They said 
they were fulfilling their duty to protect the integrity of both the 
government and the presidency. ``No man or woman, no matter how highly 
placed, no matter how effective a communicator, no matter how gifted 
a manipulator of opinion or winner of votes, can be above the law 
in a democracy,'' said Rep. Henry Hyde, R-Ill., the chairman of the 
House Judiciary Committee. ``That is a rock-bottom, irreducible principle 
of our public life.'' As members of the full House took up the debate 
over articles of impeachment against President Clinton Friday, they 
quarreled perhaps most angrily over each other's motives and over 
which party was truly dedicated to the intentions of the Constitution 
and the rule of law. In a marathon session of elegant oratory and 
inelegant wisecracks, of wistful glances backward in time and anxious 
glances forward, each party tried to sell itself to the American people 
and to its most loyal constituents as the group on the side of the 
angels. For the Republicans, a Vietnam veteran spoke of the importance 
of proceeding with impeachment even as the country conducted airstrikes 
in Iraq. For the Democrats, African-Americans spoke of their familiarity 
with overzealous, discretion-blind prosecutors, a category in which 
they placed Kenneth Starr, the independent counsel. Members of both 
parties cloaked themselves in patriotism and fidelity to the Constitution, 
but to make points in direct opposition. Rep. Edward Markey, D-Mass., 
said that in treating Clinton's alleged attempts to conceal an extramarital 
affair as impeachable offenses, ``we are amending the Constitution 
of the United States on the floor of the House of Representatives 
here today!'' ``Make no mistake about it,'' he said. ``This is a constitutional 
amendment that we are debating, not an impeachment resolution. The 
Republicans are crossing out the impeachment standard of `high crimes 
and misdemeanors' and they are inserting the words `any crime or misdemeanor.' 
We are permitting a constitutional coup d'etat which will haunt this 
body and our country forever.'' Rep. Louise Slaughter, D-N.Y., mentioned 
the impeachment of President Andrew Johnson more than a century ago 
and said: ``History accords that his real crime was disagreeing with 
the majority party. I fear that history will view this 1998 impeachment 
inquiry similarly.'' ``A total-control majority urges impeachment, 
not for treason, bribery or other high crimes or misdemeanors, but 
because they disdain this president for his moral flaws, ranging from 
military service evasion to flagrant infidelity,'' Ms. Slaughter said. 
Republicans countered that Democrats were trivializing and distorting 
the case against the president, including the fact that his alleged 
lies were rendered under oath and that some of them subverted the 
federal civil rights lawsuit filed by Paula Corbin Jones. ``Lying 
under oath is an ancient crime of great weight because it shields 
other offenses, because it blocks the light of truth in human affairs,'' 
said Rep. Ileana Ros-Lehtinen, R-Fla. ``It is a dagger in the heart 
of our legal system, and indeed in our democracy. It cannot, it should 
not, it must not be tolerated.'' And it compelled impeachment, Republicans 
said. ``You know, when the president stands before God, puts his hand 
on the Bible and takes an oath to uphold the Constitution and lawfully 
carry out the duties of his office, he is promising to put the people 
and the nation before his own interests,'' said Rep. Sam Johnson, 
R-Texas. ``I believe the president violated the laws and beliefs he 
swore to uphold,'' Johnson said. ``Instead of following the law, respecting 
American people's values and honoring his office, he chose to lie, 
cover up and evade the truth. His actions have made a mockery of the 
people who fought for this country and are fighting for this nation 
today, the Constitution and the laws we live under. And because of 
the president's actions, Congress must act as dictated by the Constitution.'' 
Although the debate came on the morning after an admission by the 
House speaker-elect, Robert Livingston, R-La., that he had engaged 
in extra-marital affairs years ago, Democrats did not turn that revelation 
into a weapon in defense of the president. It was alluded to only 
obliquely, as when Rep. Martin Frost, D-Texas, said, ``If we make 
every member of this House rumored to have been involved in an affair 
subject to a $40 million special prosecutor and then hold him accountable 
for any misstatement of fact, we may be faced with a number of empty 
seats in this chamber.'' Republicans and Democrats resurrected their 
disagreement over having the House debate impeachment while the U.S. 
was engaged in air strikes against Iraq. They also revisited their 
starkly different appraisals of whether the wrongdoing attributed 
to Clinton represented private or public matters. Yet even as they 
clarified anew the broad gulf of opinion between them, they made calls 
for bridges to be built in the future, for an end to partisanship 
and the accusatory, corrosive politics it has spawned. ``We are now 
at the height of a cycle of the politics of negative attacks, character 
assassination, personal smears of good people, decent people, worthy 
people,'' the House Minority Leader, Rep. Dick Gephardt of Missouri, 
said. ``It's no wonder to me and to you that the people of our country 
today are cynical and indifferent and apathetic about our government, 
and about our country. The politics of smear and slash-and-burn must 
end.''
