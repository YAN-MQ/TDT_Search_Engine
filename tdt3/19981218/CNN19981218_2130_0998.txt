In an attempt to reduce its workforce, Saturn soon will offer union 
employees a cash incentive to transfer to other General Motors plants. 
Saturn, a subsidiary of GM, is offering the package to employees in 
its spring hill, Tennessee, plant. As many as 600 people are expected 
to take the offer. The automaker has been trying to recover from one 
of its worst sales slumps since it began manufacturing cars in 1990.
