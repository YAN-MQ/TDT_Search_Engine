Japan needs deregulation in a wide range of industries to foster the 
entreprenurial activity needed to pull the country out of its worst 
recession in decades, Japan's trade minister said Friday. Trade Minister 
Kaoru Yosano told reporters that Japan's ``Big Bang'' financial liberalization 
measures should be accompanied by deregulation in other industries 
such as energy, medical care, and communications. ``In terms of market 
structure, an environment has to be developed which allows for the 
smooth entry and exit of companies,'' he said. To raise Japan's low 
company start-up rate, the government must offer financial support 
to entrepreneurs, Yosano said. Companies, in turn, can increase productivity 
by streamlining their operations and cutting back on ``white-collar 
over-employment,'' he said. Japan's record-high jobless rate, currently 
4.3 percent, will inevitably rise in the process, but jobs created 
in new industries will eventually counteract the trend, Yosano said. 
Ultimately, Yosano said, economic recovery will depend on cooperation 
between the government and the private sector. ``Ensuring true affluence 
for the people of Japan, as well as the successful conversion to a 
domestic demand-led economy, will require an integrated effort through 
public-private alliance.''
