In the '40s, the Dodge Power Wagon was a famously rugged truck that 
moved from military service to civilian duty. Now Chrysler has revived 
the name for a show vehicle that combines handcrafted luxury with 
aggressive styling and an immense 7.2-liter diesel engine. Chrysler 
is withholding details of the design until the Power Wagon makes its 
debut next month at the North American International Auto Show, although 
the company released a sneak-preview photo last week. Executives said 
at a technology briefing that the truck would serve not only as a 
design study but would provide a platform to explore the prospects 
for diesel technology. The concept vehicle is equipped with a turbo-charged 
direct-injection in-line 6 from Caterpillar. It is capable of 250 
horsepower and 780 foot-pounds of torque, compared with the 450 foot-pounds 
of Chrysler's most powerful current Ram truck engine, an 8-liter gasoline 
V10. Diesels achieve 5 percent to 10 percent better economy than gas 
engines. ``Sooner or later fuel economy is really going to matter,'' 
Bernard Robertson, Chrysler's senior vice president of engineering 
technologies and general manager of truck operations, said in an interview. 
``Consumers' No. 1 complaint with large trucks and sport utilities 
is poor fuel economy _ but then they'll ask if we've got a bigger 
engine.''
