Mindful as ever of his standing in history, President Clinton is said 
by associates to feel devastated about a scar he now regards as inevitable: 
impeachment on Saturday by the House of Representatives. But at the 
same time, aides and friends of Clinton say, America's most tested 
political fighter has steeled himself for the battle of his life, 
believing that his opponents are acting out of partisan hatred, not 
Constitutional duty. Friay, his enduring ally, Hillary Rodham Clinton, 
once more rallied to his side. Breaking weeks of silence about her 
husband's predicament, she issued an appeal ``to end divisiveness'' 
and planned a last-minute speech Saturday morning to summon House 
Democrats against impeachment. In addition to calling upon Mrs. Clinton, 
the president is trying to enlist George Mitchell, the former Senate 
majority leader, to bolster his defense before the Senate, aides said. 
At the White House on Friday, Clinton once again bore down on the 
budget priorities and other goals that he believes will sustain his 
public support. ``My goodness, how do you think he is?'' expostulated 
one adviser to Clinton on Friday. ``This guy reads history books on 
every President. He can cite you details about every president. So 
on the one hand he's devastated about what this will do and has done 
for his legacy. But on the other hand, he looks at how it's being 
done as pure politics.'' And politics is something that the Clintons 
understand. ``I think the vast majority of Americans share my approval 
and pride in the job that the president's been doing for our country,'' 
Mrs. Clinton said, in an extremely rare response Friday morning to 
a reporter's question. Marsha Berry, Mrs. Clinton's spokeswoman, said 
that the first lady was invited by Minority Leader Dick Gephardt to 
speak on Saturday because the Democrats ``just want to show their 
support for her and the president.'' In her comments Friday morning, 
Mrs. Clinton made a plea to turn attention to ``people who need help 
and support.'' ``There are still, you know, abused and neglected and 
foster children that are not getting well taken care of,'' she said. 
``There are still people with health care problems who need tending 
to.'' But while Mrs. Clinton appealed for unity, elsewhere at the 
White House aides took up their cudgels. Anticipating calls for Clinton's 
resignation, Joseph Lockhart, the press secretary, accused Republicans 
of a ``cynical, political strategy,'' to downplay impeachment for 
weeks, and then argue now that it should prompt Clinton's resignation. 
He accused the Republicans of ``not being straight with the American 
public.'' Lockhart, a more pugnacious and sharper-tongued spokesman 
than his predecessor, Mike McCurry, came to his daily briefing Friday 
armed with a stack of quotations from Republican congressmen to illustrate 
his point. At his right, Lockhart's deputies sat beneath an advertisement 
torn from the newspaper and stuck with silver duct tape to the wall: 
``Forgive or Condemn?'' it read. ``Let him who is without sin cast 
the first vote.'' On a crisp, clear wintry day, a sense less of history 
than of historic wrong, and of grievance, settled over the White House. 
Furious aides ridiculed congressional Republicans as bent on Clinton's 
destruction. ``I was wrong for 11 months,'' said Paul Begala, Clinton's 
counselor. ``For 11 months I said this was all about sex, and I was 
wrong. It is all about power, and politics, and partisanship.'' Clinton 
feels the same way, his associates said. ``He bolsters himself that 
it's a political war being waged, that it has nothing to do with the 
morality of this, that it's the politics of trying to get rid of Bill 
Clinton,'' one adviser said. But, he added, ``He doesn't sit around 
and wring his hands. He's more in the position of, `Here's what we 
have to do.' '' Clinton is hoping to bring in a lawyer respected in 
the Senate, aides said, declining to name any possible hires. The 
White House is negotiating with Mitchell of Maine. Friday, Clinton 
began his day with a briefing about the attack on Iraq from Sandy 
Berger, the national security adviser. He also met one-on-one in his 
private study in the White House residence with Rep. Christopher Shays, 
a Connecticut Republican who has said he is wavering on impeachment. 
For two hours, he then presided over grueling talks _ not about impeachment, 
but about trade in bananas and pens _ at a meeting with European Union 
representatives. Later, Clinton held a meeting with aides to discuss 
a couple of dozen narrowly targeted tax cuts he might include in his 
next budget. And Friday evening he sat down with his Advisory Council 
on HIV/AIDS. Clinton looked tired, though he told aides he had gotten 
seven hours of sleep Thursday night. But he joked about how hard it 
can be to get legislation passed. People around Clinton no longer 
avoid mention of his troubles. When Bob Hattoy, a longtime aide, arrived 
late for the meeting, the president glanced at him and said, ``I'm 
glad you're here.'' ``I'm glad you're here,'' Hattoy replied. Maria 
Echaveste, the deputy chief of staff, said her colleagues were rallying 
around the president. ``I think people recognize that this is extraordinarily 
difficult,'' she said. But that spurred them to work harder, she said. 
``People have a lot of loyalty here,'' she said. ``And they have a 
lot of faith in him.'' In Vice President Al Gore's ceremonial office 
Friday evening, aides threw a surprise birthday party for Gene Sperling, 
the director of the National Economic Council. Gore, Mrs. Clinton, 
Treasury Secretary Robert Rubin and other high-ranking officials came 
for what turned into a roast. ``Most of you are probably here not 
so much for Gene's birthday party as to hit him up for special budget 
projects,'' needled Mrs. Clinton, according to one aide who was present. 
She added, perhaps for the benefit of another guest, Federal Reserve 
Chairman Alan Greenspan, ``I have a simple answer to that: What's 
wrong with printing more money?''
