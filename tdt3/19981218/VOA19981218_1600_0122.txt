British Prime Minister Tony Blair dismisses criticism of Britain's 
participation in the air strikes against Iraq and says the mission 
is aimed at degrading Saddam Hussein's military capabilities. VOA 
Correspondent Lori Castman reports from London that Prime Minister 
Blair is calling for more international support for the effort. Prime 
Minister Blair dismisses suggestions of disunity among western allies 
even after Russia recalled its ambassador from London to protest the 
air strikes. He insists there is no disagreement that Iraq's leader 
must be constrained. Mr. Blair defends British participation in the 
air strikes and justifies the military action to diminish Saddam Hussein's 
threat to his neighbors. I can assure you we are very conscience of 
the fact that the reason we took this action is because unless he 
is kept very firmly in his cage then he is going to use any force 
he can against others. Mr. Blair says the air strikes are, in his 
words "on course toward achieving their objective." Britain and the 
United States have come under heavy criticism for launching the air 
strikes without first consulting the UN Security Council. Lori Castman, 
VOA News, London.
