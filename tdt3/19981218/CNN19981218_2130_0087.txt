In the House of Representatives, a full day of debate over whether 
to impeach President Clinton is winding down. Lawmakers are expected 
to resume debate for an hour tomorrow morning, then take a final vote. 
A CNN head count indicates at least one of the four articles of impeachment 
is all but certain to pass. If that happens, President Clinton will 
become only the second American president to face an impeachment trial 
in the Senate. As expected, rhetoric between democrats and republicans 
is going strong. What we say here today will be but paragraphs, perhaps 
even footnotes in the pages of history to be written by those to come. 
What we do here will be indelibly printed on the American tradition. 
Let not this house grant a pardon to the president for his criminal 
offenses. Let not history look back on this day and say there, on 
that date, America surrendered the rule of law. I am greatly disappointed 
in the raw, unmasked, unbridled hatred and meanness that drives this 
impeachment coup D'etat. The unapologetic disregard for the voice 
of the people. My republican friends, what you do here today will 
long be remembered and be recorded in history as one of the most despicable 
actions ever taken by the Congress of the United States of America.
