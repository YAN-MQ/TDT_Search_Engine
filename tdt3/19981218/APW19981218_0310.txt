Arab governments and newspapers fiercely criticized the U.S. air strikes 
on Baghdad on Friday as security officials readied for expected anti-American 
demonstrations outside mosques after the weekly Muslim prayers. Throughout 
the Arab world, the message was that the unleashing of missiles at 
the heart of Baghdad would do more harm to the Iraqi people than to 
President Saddam Hussein. Syrian Parliament Speaker Abdul-Kader Qaddoura 
said the U.S. strikes ``increased the suffering and pain'' of Iraq's 
people, ``particularly its children and civilians.'' ``We ... condemn 
and denounce this attack and call on the international community to 
condemn and halt it immediately,'' he said in a speech to the Parliament. 
Sheik Zayed bin Sultan Al Nahyan, president of the United Arab Emirates, 
expressed his ``great concern over the military action against Iraq 
and its repercussions on the Iraqi people,'' the Emirates news agency 
reported late Thursday. It also quoted a government spokesman as saying: 
``The terrible operation we have seen on television ... is beyond 
comprehension and is unacceptable.'' The spokesman's name was not 
given. In Egypt, Jordan and Lebanon, security officials readied for 
protests over the U.S. and British attacks outside mosques or American 
embassies. On Thursday, protests against the attacks erupted in Cairo, 
the Lebanese capital Beirut and the Gaza Strip. The Egyptian-based 
Arab League called an emergency meeting Sunday to discuss the situation 
in Iraq. Its secretary-general, Esmat Abdel-Meguid, on Thursday blamed 
the attack on last week's report by U.N. chief weapons inspector Richard 
Butler, saying he ``intended to provoke Iraq and not be neutral'' 
in assessing Iraq's weapons programs. In Lebanon, Ghassan Tweini, 
publisher of the leading daily An-Nahar, urged a summit of the Arab 
world's leaders to demand a halt to attacks on Iraq. He wrote that 
the attacks were misguided in trying to oust Saddam. ``Leave it to 
the Iraqis, not the Americans, not the Turks nor the Kurds nor the 
Israelis ... to decide the fate of the Iraqi regime and Saddam Hussein,'' 
Tweini wrote in his paper's Friday edition. The Beirut newspaper As-Safir 
also said that the American attacks would give Saddam ``a new lease 
on life.'' On Thursday, the attacks on Iraq were condemned by Lebanese 
Prime Minister Salim Hoss and the world's largest Muslim group, the 
52-nation Organization of the Islamic Conference based in Saudi Arabia. 
Most Iraqi opposition parties joined in the criticism of the attacks. 
The main exception to a united Arab front was Kuwait, whose invasion 
by Iraq in 1990 led to the following year's Gulf War and eight years 
of trade sanctions on Iraq. Sheik Sabah al-Ahmed al-Sabah, the Kuwaiti 
foreign minister and deputy prime minister, told the daily Al-Rai 
Al-Amm the current crisis was between Iraqi and the United Nations. 
``We are not part of it, and we have nothing to do with it whatsoever,'' 
he was quoted as saying. Fouad al-Hashem, columnist for Al-Watan daily 
in Kuwait, wrote Friday that he hoped the bodies of Saddam, his sons 
and wife and Iraqi Deputy Prime Minister Tariq Aziz ``will be hanging 
naked from street lights all over Baghdad'' by the time the U.S. attacks 
end. In Israel, meanwhile, Defense Minister Yitzhak Mordechai said 
the government would take all necessary measures to protect against 
an attack by Iraq in response to the American air strikes. But he 
told Israel radio he considered such an attack unlikely. Iraqi fired 
about 40 missiles at Israel during the 1991 Gulf War, but it has made 
no threat in the current crises to fire on the Jewish state.
