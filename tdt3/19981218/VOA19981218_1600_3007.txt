We had a good day and a good week on Wall Street. Dow Jones Industrial 
Average closing at 8903, that was up 27 points. For the week the industrial 
average gained 82 points, almost 1 percent. Standard & Poor 500 index 
closed today at 1188, that was up 8 points. The technology heavy NASDAQ 
Index closed at a record high. Well stock prices were down early but 
gained as the session went on. Again Wall Street traders did not seem 
to view the air attacks on Iraq or the possible impeachment of President 
Clinton as negative factors for the stock market.
