The world is entering into a bold new phase of space exploration _ 
somewhat quietly. In recent years, public interest has waned. Not 
that space probes and space flight have become commonplace, but the 
keen excitement of our love affair with space has diminished. Back 
in the 1960s and '70s citizens across the nation took time out of 
their busy lives to watch America's rocket launches on television. 
When 77-year-old John Glenn returned to space as one of the crew in 
the shuttle Discovery last month, interest peaked momentarily. But 
few people watched the shuttle Endeavor lift off from the Kennedy 
Space Center on Dec. 4 to rendezvous with the orbiting Russian-made 
control module. Endeavor carried a docking port to connect with the 
control module, the first two major components of an international 
Earth orbiting space station. American astronauts and Russian cosmonauts 
and 14 other nations have been working together to build the orbiting 
station. It will be used for long-term space experiments and as a 
space outpost for exploration into the far reaches of space. Nearly 
100 more important components will be added in the next five years 
before the space station is completed. At that point, it will weigh 
approximately one million pounds and span two football fields. On 
Friday, NASA's unmanned spacecraft, the Mars Climate Orbiter, rocketed 
into space headed for Mars and will reach it next September. In early 
January, the Mars Polar Lander will be sent to burrow into the Red 
Planet and analyze its soil. The polar lander will track the movement 
of water vapor and dust across Mars. The orbiter will relay that information 
back to Earth. NASA now plans to send a pair of unmanned spacecraft 
to Mars every two years for the next decade. It won't be long before 
the first explorers will travel from the space station to the Red 
Planet and back. And a new age of exploration will have begun _ one 
that will far exceed dreams and accomplishments of the seafaring explorers 
of the 1400s.
