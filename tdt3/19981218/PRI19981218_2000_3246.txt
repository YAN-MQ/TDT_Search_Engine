Figure out today's geography quiz yet? We took you to a remote coral 
island in the middle of the Indian Ocean, serving as a key strategic 
location for U.S. and British air strikes against Iraq. It also featured 
prominently in the Gulf war. It was founded by the Portuguese, owned 
by the British and is used by the U.S. Navy. The answer is the island 
of Diego Garcia.
