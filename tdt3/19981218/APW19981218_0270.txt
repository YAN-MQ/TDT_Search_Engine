South Korean navy ships and planes chased and sank a North Korean 
speedboat in a gun battle Friday and began a sea and air search for 
its suspected mother ship. The body of a North Korean in a wet suit 
was recovered shortly after the sinking of the vessel, described as 
a low-slung, high-speed boat used to land or pick up spies. ``We're 
now involved in reconnaissance operations to pursue the mother ship, 
which is believed to be outside South Korean territorial waters,'' 
Lt. Gen. Chung Young-jin said. The office of the Joint Chiefs of Staff 
had earlier described the sunken ship as a mini-submarine of a type 
commonly used by North Korea for espionage missions. But Chung, commander 
of the Joint Chiefs' Operations Headquarters, told a news conference 
it was a speedboat capable of carrying up to eight people. The craft 
was first spotted shortly before midnight Thursday as it approached 
Yosu, a small port 320 kilometers (200 miles) south of Seoul on the 
tip of the Korean Peninsula, he said. The boat then fled southeast 
for about 100 kilometers (62 miles), pursued for nearly six hours 
by South Korean navy ships and air force planes, Chung said. Finally 
hemmed in and illuminated by nearly 100 flares dropped by a South 
Korean transport plane, the fleeing boat opened fire at the pursuing 
ships and was quickly sunk by return fire, Chung said. ``We fired 
several warning shots, but the enemy craft continued to flee and fired 
at us. Therefore, we attacked and sank it,'' said Col. Hwang Dong-kyu, 
a Joint Chiefs of Staff spokesman. About two hours later, South Korean 
troops recovered the body of the North Korean. Chung said four men 
had been sighted on the boat, and Navy frogmen were searching for 
more bodies. There were no South Korean casualties. ``The speedboat 
is believed to have been dispatched to infiltrate agents into the 
South, pick up agents stationed in the South, or establish secret, 
espionage-related drop-off points,'' Chung said. He said it was believed 
to have been launched by a mother ship weighing 70 to 100 tons, sailing 
out of the port of Nampo on North Korea's west coast. On shore, South 
Korean soldiers and police were put on high alert, increasing security 
checks for possible infiltrators from the boat, officials said. Chief 
presidential spokesman Park Jie-won praised the swift military action 
and urged North Korea to stop armed provocations to promote peace 
on the peninsula. In Washington, U.S. National Security Council spokesman 
P.J. Crowley called the intrusion a ``very serious matter.'' North 
Korea routinely uses submarines to drop off or pick up spies along 
South Korea's long coastline, officials said. Several have been detected 
in recent years. In June, a 70-ton Yugo-class North Korean submarine 
was found in South Korean waters off the east coast with its propeller 
and periscope tangled in a fishing net. South Koreans later cut through 
the hatch with welding torches and found nine bodies, all shot dead 
in an apparent suicide pact. Seoul officials said the sub was on a 
spy mission. The latest incident comes as the United States is trying 
to defuse tension over a suspected North Korean nuclear weapons site. 
North Korea has rejected a U.S. demand for its inspection. North Korea 
claims that the facility under construction at Keumjang-ri north of 
the country's capital, Pyongyang, is for civilian use, but U.S. officials 
suspect it to be nuclear-related. North Korea's military has denounced 
the U.S. demand for inspection as ``a declaration of war.'' About 
37,000 U.S. troops are stationed in South Korea under a mutual defense 
treaty. The Koreas were divided into the communist North and the capitalist 
South in 1945. They are still technically at war, because the 1950-53 
Korean War ended in an armistice, not a peace treaty.
