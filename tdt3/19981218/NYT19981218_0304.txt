The House impeachment debate commanded the full attention of the big 
broadcast networks and the all-news cable networks for most of Friday 
morning, but eventually gave way to occasional reports from Iraq and 
ultimately, for most network stations, to the attraction of soap operas. 
The news departments of ABC, CBS and NBC all continued their network 
coverage of the impeachment debate throughout the day, but between 
11 a.m. and 12:45 p.m. all three offered their stations the opportunity 
to switch off to the regular line-up of daytime programs, mostly soap 
operas. The vast majority of stations opted for the likes of ``Days 
of Our Lives'' and ``The Young and the Restless.'' Randy Falco, the 
president of the NBC network said, ``It was a day of multiple feeds: 
impeachment, Baghdad and soap operas.'' NBC, for example, covered 
the impeachment debate on its full network only until 11 a.m., when 
the anchor, Tom Brokaw, said some stations would leave for their own 
programming. NBC's coverage continued for the stations that wanted 
to take it. Even NBC's flagship station, WNBC in New York, switched 
from the impeachment coverage to join an episode of ``Sunset Beach'' 
in progress. WNBC rejoined NBC's impeachment coverage at 3 p.m., after 
``Days of our Lives'' and ``Another World.'' NBC also programs its 
own all-news channel MSNBC, which continued its impeachment coverage 
throughout the day, along with some coverage from Iraq such as a news 
conference with foreign minister Tariq Aziz. On CBS, the network covered 
the debate in full from 9 a.m. until 12:30, when it adopted the same 
policy, keeping the network's coverage going with its anchorman, Dan 
Rather, in place, while offering stations the opportunity to switch 
to ``The Young and the Restless.'' The majority did, including WCBS, 
the network's flagship station in New York. But several CBS stations, 
including those in Boston, Baltimore, San Francisco, Houston and St. 
Louis, stayed with the impeachment coverage for at least some time 
beyond the start of the soap operas. In ABC's case, the network maintained 
full coverage until 12:45, when it allowed its stations to join the 
show ``Port Charles'' in progress. ABC also continued to offer stations 
the events happening in the House though without any commentary from 
its anchor, Peter Jennings. Most ABC stations opted for the entertainment 
shows, including ABC's flagship station, WABC. All three all-news 
cable channels focused all day on the impeachment events, though they 
all occasionally interrupted for developments from Baghdad including 
the news conference by Aziz and a taped statement by Saddam Hussein. 
The cable channels kept up their full coverage until the end of the 
debate Friday night. The networks were to stay with their prime-time 
lineups, but each of them devoted at least an hour to special news 
coverage of the day's events. Each network announced it would cover 
the actual votes on articles of impeachment live on Saturday. If they 
take place later than the expected time of between 10 a.m. and 11 
a.m., CBS will face the biggest problem because of its commitment 
to cover the New York Jets-Buffalo Bills football game at 12:30. But 
the network said it would interrupt the game to show any vote live.
