A 160-foot-high balloon piloted by an all-star team of long-distance 
balloonists rose from its launching pad Friday at Marrakesh, Morocco, 
to begin a voyage that the balloonists hope will take them around 
the world in 10 days. In a few hours the big balloon, buoyed by helium 
and hot air, reached a cruising altitude of more than 30,000 feet, 
and its crew proceeded cross the Algerian border. Richard Branson, 
billionaire chairman of Virgin Atlantic Airways and captain of the 
balloon, said that eastward jet-stream winds were ideal for the trip 
and that prospects were good that his team would be the first balloonists 
to circle the world nonstop. Although winds are expected to carry 
the balloon across North Africa, the team meteorologist said the track 
would avoid Iraqi airspace by at least 50 miles. ``We hope to arrive 
in Britain by New Year's Day,'' Branson said in a telephone interview. 
Flying with Branson is a former rival, Steve Fossett, an American 
commodities broker who flew solo in four previous attempts to circle 
the world. In August Fossett broke his own distance record by flying 
more than 15,200 miles from Mendoza, Argentina, to a crash landing 
in the Coral Sea that nearly cost him his life. The third team member, 
Per Lindstrand, is chairman of Lindstrand Balloons Ltd., a British 
company that built the balloon, named the ICO Global Challenge balloon. 
The ICO Global Communications Co. is its main sponsor. Branson and 
Lindstrand have made many long-distance balloon flights together, 
including record-setting flights across the Atlantic and Pacific Oceans. 
Balloonists have had many failed attempts at circumnavigation over 
the years, and more attempts are planned in the next few months than 
ever. Four teams besides the ICO effort are preparing to launch balloons 
before mid-February, and three plan to try from sites in the Southern 
Hemisphere in July. Several earlier flights were aborted because countries 
refused to permit balloonists to enter their airspace. Branson said 
that this time ``practically all'' the countries that he expected 
to cross, including China, had given permission. Despite the auspicious 
start, the balloonists were acutely aware of the dangers that they 
faced. ``Of course I'm scared,'' Fossett said. ``My fall into the 
Coral Sea in August reminded me how dangerous this is.''
