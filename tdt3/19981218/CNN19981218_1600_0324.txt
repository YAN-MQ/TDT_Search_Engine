Republicans are rallying around congressman Bob Livingston, after 
his admissions he had extramarital affairs. The Louisiana republican 
made the shocking revelations prior to the publication of a "hustler" 
magazine article. Livingston told republicans during his 33-year marriage 
to his wife, he has, on occasion, strayed from the marriage, and doing 
that nearly cost him his family. The admission drew a standing ovation 
from republicans. The speaker designate moved to distance his actions 
from the president's, saying his indiscretions were not with staff 
members and he never testified under oath about them. Some democrats 
call Livingston a hypocrite.
