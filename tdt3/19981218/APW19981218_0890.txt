Anxious to avoid the image that earned the Palestinians pariah status 
during the Gulf War, authorities moved quickly Friday to contain anti-U.S. 
demonstrations and shut down media broadcasting pro-Iraqi sentiments. 
Protesters throughout the West Bank and Gaza Strip gathered after 
Friday morning Muslim prayers to protest the joint U.S.-British airstrikes 
on Iraq. In Manger Square in Bethlehem _ where just days ago, U.S. 
President Bill Clinton received a rapturous greeting _ marchers chanted 
``Saddam, Saddam, our beloved,'' and ``Death to America, Death to 
Clinton, Death to Britain!'' Anticipating the demonstration, authorities 
made sure to strip the city of the U.S. flags that had garnished electricity 
poles during the Clinton visit. Protesters found a few leftover plastic 
U.S. flags, and wrapped them around their shoes in a sign of contempt. 
Palestinian security briefly detained an Associated Press writer for 
photographing the burning of a U.S. flag, and released him on condition 
that he not take pictures of other anti-U.S. actions. After the demonstration, 
marchers threw stones at Israeli troops guarding the entrance to the 
city. The troops responded with rubber bullets and tear gas. Fifteen 
protesters were injured. The Palestinian leadership is anxious to 
curb the unmitigated backing Palestinians gave Saddam Hussein during 
the 1991 Gulf War _ stance that set back the Palestinian cause in 
the West. Clinton's visit earlier this week _ to salvage peace accords 
with Israel _ was seen as tantamount to recognition of Palestinian 
aspirations to statehood. Palestinian leaders are anxious to cultivate 
the new friendship. The Palestinian Authority has issued a careful 
statement regretting the strikes, but urging Saddam to cooperate with 
U.N. inspectors seeking to contain Iraq's weapons-of-mass-destruction 
capability. In another sign of Palestinian efforts to contain anti-U.S. 
sentiment, police shut down two TV stations and a radio station in 
Ramallah and three TV stations in Bethlehem. There was no official 
explanation for the shutdown, but the TV stations had broadcast footage 
of the pro-Iraq demonstrations, pro-Iraqi interviews and nationalist 
music. The Voice of Peace and Love had devoted its broadcasts on Thursday 
to a popular nationalist Iraqi singer. The largest turnout was in 
Nablus, where thousands marched through the city chanting ``America 
is under our feet.'' and ``Britain is an enemy of God.''' Some marchers 
shook their fists in the air when they saw Palestinian leader Yasser 
Arafat's helicopter approach. In Beit Douku, a village near Ramallah, 
over a thousand people joined the funeral procession for a youth killed 
by Israeli troops during pro-Iraq demonstrations on Thursday. Mohammed 
Ismail, 20, was hoisted on a mattress, draped in a green sheet. ``With 
body and soul we will redeem you, martyr,'' they chanted. ``With body 
and soul, we will redeem you, Iraq!''
