Robert C. Johnston, who spent almost half a century shaping Manhattan's 
skyline from below street level and its map from below the water line, 
died on Dec. 4 at his home in Milbrook. He was 85 and had been the 
foundation engineer in charge of building the 92-acre addition to 
Manhattan known as the Battery Park City landfill. In a city that 
sometimes seems defined by the soaring majesty of its lofty spires, 
it is easy to forget that the towers are not simply plopped down on 
vacant lots or even constructed from the ground up. Before you can 
scrape the sky, you must scoop the earth, and in a city where that 
is no mean engineering feat, Johnston was a master in managing the 
designs of excavations and foundation construction for some of the 
city's grandest buildings. Among them were U.N. headquarters and the 
former Chase bank headquarters at 1 Chase Manhattan Plaza. In a society 
that lionizes architects, marine and foundation engineering may not 
seem like a glamorous calling. But Johnston, whose father was a builder, 
grew up in the Bronx apparently dreaming of nothing else. By the time 
he was 14, his wife, Charlotte, recalled this week, he not only knew 
exactly what he wanted to do but had also picked out the firm he wanted 
to do it with. Founded in 1910 by Daniel Moran and long known as Moran 
&AMP; Proctor, the firm, one of the first to work exclusively in marine 
and foundation engineering, had the field largely to itself. Johnston 
was so determined to become a part of the Moran team that he joined 
the firm as soon as he graduated from Princeton in 1935. With major 
construction virtually halted in the Depression, he worked for a year 
without pay just to be part of the action. With time out for civil-engineering 
service with the Seabees, including the Normandy landings in World 
War II, he remained with the firm through a succession of name changes 
for his entire career, becoming a partner in 1951. When he retired 
in 1983, the firm, now simply Mueser Rutledge, was known as Mueser, 
Rutledge, Johnston &AMP; DeSimone. Although he did much of his work 
in New York, Johnston had a national reputation. His credits include 
the Alcoa and U.S. Steel headquarters buildings in Pittsburgh, and 
foundations to support heavy aluminum presses used to forge aircraft 
components in Massachusetts, Ohio, Missouri and California. In New 
York, where he worked on the 600-acre industrial park in College Park, 
Queens, one of his favorite projects was the Chase Manhattan headquarters. 
To some, the building may seem impressive simply because it soars 
60 stories high. In Johnston's mole's-eye view, what made it special 
was that it had six levels of basements extending a thrilling 85 feet 
below street level. Of all the complex technical problems he solved 
along the way, by far his most notable achievement did not involve 
digging a hole, but rather filling up one that did not exist. By the 
time he finished, New York had an additional 92 acres, extending for 
about two miles along the Hudson in lower Manhattan and now the site 
of two parks, a school and about two dozen apartment and office buildings, 
including the World Financial Center, all supported by piers driven 
into the bedrock 70 feet down, beneath the river bed. The Port Authority 
gave him a head start by dumping about 1.2 million cubic yards of 
debris from the World Trade Center excavation into the Hudson, providing 
about 23.5 acres of what became Battery Park City. But Johnston, who 
used sand dredged up from New York Harbor for the rest, had to design 
around an array of delicate obstacles, including the PATH tubes that 
cross the site along with the river-water intake lines for the Trade 
Center's cooling system. In addition to his wife, Johnston is survived 
by a daughter, Barbara Adams of Manhattan, and a granddaughter. Though 
devoted to his work in a firm that has remained small precisely because 
its senior partners want to be working engineers rather than administrators, 
Johnston rarely worked late and he never took work home to Bronxville, 
where he lived for many years in a house on Bronxville Road that became 
a neighborhood attraction because of its colorful profusion of blossoms. 
That was because Johnston, like his wife, was a devoted gardener, 
one who spent his evenings and weekends planting flowers after his 
workdays planting skyscrapers.
