Animated E-mails are a great way to send holiday Greetings. But they're 
causing chaos for business computer systems. Marsha Walton explains 
in this edition of "tech trends." Holiday computer Greetings range 
from amusing to, well, racier than we can show you here. And like 
chain letters or juicy gossip, they travel fast, much to the dismay 
of many businesses with E-mail. Let's turn on the lights, click here. 
Merry Christmas. And of course we can view it again or quit. This 
little joy ride costs us about 2.5 megabytes. A typical system would 
take about 25 minutes to transmit this. Aaron fessler's company allegro 
manages hundreds of company e-mail systems. They are detecting and 
filtering out thousands of these attachments. A corporation whose 
massaging system is bogged down and four and five and six hours behind 
while delivering holiday dancing Santa claus attachments is unable 
to transmit the latest contract revisions or is unable to close the 
latest sale. Lyon apparel makes fire-fighting equipment. It has a 
contract with allegro to keep these amusements from clogging its computer 
system. Right now, we're filtering them out before they get in. Those 
that are detected do not get to the individual that they're mailed 
to. There are ways to send clever cards without creating bottlenecks. 
Commercial sites such as blue mountain arts send a personalized E-mail, 
but instead of attaching a hefty file, recipients simply go to the 
blue mountain site on the Internet and look at their card. Information 
systems manager Brian Earhart says it filters out large attachments 
for another reason, to stay out of trouble. You always have to be 
on guard because they can contain viruses or other malicious code 
inside them. Systems administrators say they don't intend to be cyber 
grinches, they just want to make sure all the real work gets done 
this holiday season. Marsha Walton, CNN, Dayton, Ohio.
