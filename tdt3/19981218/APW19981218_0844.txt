Zimbabwe's defense minister said Friday his forces have killed more 
than 2,000 rebel fighters, including white mercenaries, in the Congo 
war. The claim by acting Defense Minister Sidney Sekeramayi could 
not be independently confirmed. He did not say how many whites had 
been killed nor specify their nationalities, but called them ``mercenaries.'' 
Sekeramayi also told reporters 26 Zimbabwean soldiers have died in 
Congo since mid-August, most in fighting over the strategic eastern 
Congolese town of Kabalo that began last weekend. The number is believed 
to be much higher. Zimbabwe has deployed 8,000 soldiers to back embattled 
Congolese President Laurent Kabila. Troops from Namibia, Angola and 
Chad are also helping Kabila, while Rwanda and Uganda are backing 
the Congo rebels. Sekeramayi said heavy fighting was continuing Friday 
around Kabalo. He acknolwedged that a French-built Alouette helicpoter 
gunship was shot down recently, with the loss of its pilot, a squadron 
leader, and an army colonel commanding ground Zimbabwe troops from 
the air. Rebels have claimed they also shot down a Zimbabwe military 
transport plane and a jet fighter. Sekeramayi denied any other Zimbabwean 
war planes have been lost since the rebellion against Kabila erupted 
Aug. 2, despite an official announcement in Harare in September that 
a troop transport plane crashed in southwestern Congo in bad weather 
with the loss of its crew. Sekeramayi also denied newspaper reports 
that five senior army officers have been court-marshaled for indiscipline 
and inciting mutiny among Zimbabwean troops in Congo. The Zimbabwe 
Independent newspaper reported Friday one of the disciplined officers, 
a battalion commander, allegedly refused to obey orders. Another of 
the five, identified as a Maj. Tuhwe, was discharged for inciting 
disaffection, fear, alarm and despondency among troops serving in 
the Congo, The Independent reported. It said military intelligence 
bugged his home telephone and heard him say in a call from the front 
that ``people are dying, corpses are in plastic bags full of worms 
and soldiers are dying en masse.''
