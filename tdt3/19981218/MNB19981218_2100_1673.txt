When we come back tonight, the mission over Iraq is over. 70 hours 
of bombing. But does everyone agree on the mission accomplished? There 
was a time when mories were painful. They just reminded me of how 
far away I was from feeling like myself. I couldn't get out of bed. 
I was always tired. I hardly ate. I stopped wanting to be around people. 
Sometimes, I felt like, "what's the use?" My friends, they'd say, 
"cheer up. You have everything." But I was so depressed, I couldn't 
snap out of it. You can'just snap out of clinical depression. No one 
can because it's a real illness with real causes. But you can get 
your life back. A first step is giving us a call. We'll send you a 
free, confidential information kit... with facts about depression 
and treatment that's worked for millions... and a symptoms checkli 
that can make it easier... to talk with a doctor about how you're 
feeling. Now, I already have my wish. I have my life back.
