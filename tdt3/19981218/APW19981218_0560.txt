Norway's Lasse Kjus captured his second consecutive World Cup downhill 
victory this season as he beat favored Austrians Werner Franz and 
Hermann Maier in Friday's speed race at Val Gardena. His second triumph 
in seven days vaulted the 27-year-old Norwegian skier atop the World 
Cup overall standings, with 413 points, ahead of Austrian Stephan 
Eberharter. Kjus, a World Cup overall champion in 1996 and a silver 
medalist in the Olympic downhill at Nagano this year, had a faultless 
run down the icy Saslong course as he clocked an unbeatable time of 
two minutes, 2.18 seconds over the 3,495-meter distance. It was the 
eighth World Cup career win _ the fourth in downhill _ for Kjus, who 
had captured the first speed race of the season at Val D'Isere, France, 
last Saturday. Franz finished 0.91 seconds behind the winner. Maier, 
the defending World Cup champion, trailed Kjus by 1.10 seconds. Italy's 
Kristian Ghedina, the defending Val Gardena champion, placed fourth 
ahead of Norway's Kjetil Andre Aamodt. Other top finishers included 
Austrian Andreas Schifferer (6th), Sweden's Patrik Jaerbyn (7th) and 
Hans Kanuss and Pietro Vitalini, who were tied for eighth place, 2.02 
seconds behind the winner. The race was marred by two bad spills. 
Norway's Lasse Paulsen crashed through the finish line, escaped unhurt 
and still placed 13th. French late starter David Pretot crashed against 
safety fences in the upper part of the course and was taken away on 
a toboggan. Organizers said Pretot possibly twisted his right knee 
and that he was going to undergo medical examinations later in the 
day. Kjus, an all-around skier who can pocket World Cup points in 
all disciplines of Alpine skiing, said he won a grueling race ``on 
an icy track, with a lot of big jumps.'' ``When you jump too long 
you lose time, and you certainly feel them in the legs after a run 
like this. I am overjoyed with my second downhill victory,'' the Norwegian 
said. Friday's race was the first of back-to-back downhills in this 
north Italian valley. It made up for the season opener in Whistler 
Mountain, Canada, canceled by bad weather earlier this month. The 
original Val Gardena downhill, the third of the season, is scheduled 
Saturday.
