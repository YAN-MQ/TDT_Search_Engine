This look at your "CNN Headline News Weather" begins with our forecast 
weather map for Saturday morning. Snowfall in the Great Lakes area, 
and rainfall along a cold front that continues to push across the 
country, the first really strong cold front that we've seen this season. 
In the deep south we can see some thunderstorms along this boundary 
as it continues its easterly movement. Behind it some windy conditions 
and some very, very frigid temperatures. As a matter of fact, as you 
look at the forecast for high temperatures tomorrow, some places in 
the northern Rockies will see highs remaining below zero. And many 
places in the upper midwest and northern plains states will see highs 
in the single digits. The cold air does continue to push to the south. 
And as we look at our extended forecast on Sunday, you can see the 
snow, mixed with rainfall in the Great Lakes area, and the windy snowy 
conditions expected to continue in parts of the west. You can see 
the very cold conditions that continue on the map too in the west, 
on Monday. And as we head on into Tuesday, you can see some of that 
cold air retreats a bit but snow showers are still likely in parts 
of the Great Lakes area and in the northeast. For more weather information, 
log on to CNN.com, four-day forecasts for 7200 cities.
