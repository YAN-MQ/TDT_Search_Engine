About 70 people protesting the airstrikes on Iraq threw stones, shoes 
and a bicycle at the U.S. Embassy on Friday, breaking two of the downtown 
building's windows. Two people were arrested in the melee, which started 
when the group broke away from a rally of about 300 people and rushed 
toward the embassy. Police spokesman Flemming Steen Munch said the 
rally was organized by a local Iraqi cultural association. One man 
was arrested after throwing a cobblestone and another was arrested 
as he carried a stone, Munch said. Several of the demonstrators threw 
their own shoes at the embassy, he said.
