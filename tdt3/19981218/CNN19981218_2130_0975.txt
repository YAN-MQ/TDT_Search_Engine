FedEx and the union representing its pilots have reached a tentative 
agreement. The contract calls for a 17% pay increase over five years 
for the 3,500 fedEx pilots. If ratified by the FedEx pilots association 
and its members, the agreement will give the pilots more control over 
their working schedules. The pilots threatened to strike last month 
due to a pay dispute that began in July.
