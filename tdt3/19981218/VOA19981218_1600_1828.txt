US and British Forces have launched a third day of air attacks against 
Iraq. We get the latest from the Pentagon where correspondent Nick 
Simeon reports the total number of cruise missiles fired at Iraq during 
Operation Desert Fox now exceeds the number used during the entire 
Gulf War in 1991. Defense Secretary William Cohen says a wide range 
of military targets including state radio and television facilities 
are coming under attack as this third wave of bombings continues. 
We continue to be satisfied with the results although the strikes 
are not yet complete. There have been no American or British casualties. 
Senior US Defense Officials say the goal remains to degrade President 
Saddam Hussein's efforts to threaten its neighbors with banned weapons, 
not to destabilize the Iraqi government. Still Joint Chiefs of Staff 
Chairman General Hugh Shelton confirmed US aircraft have been dropping 
leaflets in Southern Iraq telling Iraqi troops not to get involved 
in the fighting. Basically it said stay where you are, stay put, do 
not threaten anyone and you will not be hit. General Shelton says 
not all the US and British attacks have hit their intended targets. 
Overall though, US officials remain very pleased with the operation.
