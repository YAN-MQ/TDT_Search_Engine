For "CNN Headline Sports," I'm Russell Biven. Atlanta falcons head 
coach Dan Reeves left the hospital today, just four days after undergoing 
quadruple bypass surgery. The 54-year-old Reeves, who has helped guide 
the falcons to a Franchise-best 12- 2 record to this point, held an 
emotional press conference earlier today. I want to thank God for 
the miracle, 'cause this doesn't look like an Angel right here. Anyway, 
I made up my mind about three or four months ago that i had these 
symptoms, but I wasn't going to mention them. The outpouring of prayer, 
love, the gifts, have been unbelievable. Meanwhile, defensive coordinator 
rich Brooks will be the interim head coach for the final two regular 
season games.
