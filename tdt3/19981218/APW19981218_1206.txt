The United States Embassy warned American citizens in Saudi Arabia 
and neighboring Gulf states Friday to be vigilant and to keep a low 
profile. ``In the light of the military operations in Iraq and the 
possibility of acts of revenge, the State Department urges American 
citizens, residents or travelers, to review their security measures,'' 
the embassy said in a statement. The statement urged Americans to 
vary their daily travel routes and to look out for suspicious parcels. 
The United States and Britain launched a series of missile and air 
attacks against Iraq on Wednesday in retaliation for Baghdad's alleged 
obstruction of U.N. weapons inspectors verifying the elimination of 
Iraq's weapons of mass destruction. The attacks were continuing Friday 
night. Security for the 40,000 Americans working in Saudi Arabia _ 
along with an estimated 5,000 military personnel _ has been a a major 
U.S. concern since two bomb attacks in 1995 and 1996 killed a total 
of 24 American military personnel.
