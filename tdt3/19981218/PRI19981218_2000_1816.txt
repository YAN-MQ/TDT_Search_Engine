American and British aircraft are carrying out a third night of military 
strikes against Iraq. Muffled explosions have been heard in the Iraqi 
capital, Baghdad and anti-aircraft fire has started up. Defense Secretary 
William Cohen says he is sensitive to the Muslin holy month of Ramadan, 
but the operation will continue until allied objectives have been 
achieved. There is no fixed end time. We intend, we have set very 
specific targets and that we intend to attack when those missions 
are completed and then we wish it will end. We are sensitive to the 
issue of Ramadan. We will take that into account but what is most 
important as far as carrying out this mission is to make sure it is 
successfully completed in our judgment and that we'll not be bound 
by any artificial time line. William Cohen. One direct hit is said 
to have destroyed an air base southeast of Baghdad where unmanned 
aircraft capable of delivering chemical or biological weapons were 
standing in hangars. Another target was the Bazra oil refinery, Iraq's 
third largest which the Pentagon says was being used to smuggle oil 
in violation of UN sanctions.
