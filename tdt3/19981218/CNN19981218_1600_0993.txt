Investors not showing much reaction to continued military action in 
Iraq. I'm Terry Keenan at the CNN Financial Newsdesk in New York. 
With this edition of "Dollars & Sense." Investors seem to be shrugging 
off the military strikes in Iraq. Word that U.S. bombers attacked 
one of Iraq's oil refineries in today's bombing failing to move oil 
prices off their lows. Also weighing on the oil market, word that 
major oil producers Mexico, venezuela and Saudi Arabia had discussed 
further cuts in oil production but failed to reach agreement.
