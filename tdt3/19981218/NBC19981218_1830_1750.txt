We'll have continuing coverage, of course, of those two major events. 
That is "Nightly News" for Friday. Live coverage of the impeachment 
vote in Congress tomorrow beginning at 9:00 and continuing coverage 
of the situation in Iraq throughout the night and the weekend on this 
station and on MSNBC on cable I'm Tom Brokaw. Good night.
