The food and drug administration has approved a new drug for treating 
HIV. The drug called ziagen is taken orally twice a day. It's manufactured 
by Glaxo-wellcome. When used with other HIV medications the FDA says 
it has been shown to help lower the amount of HIV in the blood. Ziagen 
is the 15th drug approved to treat HIV. The FDA warns however that 
at least 5% of patients tested had serious side effects to the drug. 
Some proved fatal.
