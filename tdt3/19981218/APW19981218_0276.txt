A judge on Friday dealt a blow to Allan Boesak, denying a motion to 
dismiss the embezzlement case charges against the former top African 
National Congress official. Judge John Foxcroft dismissed five of 
32 counts but ordered the trial to continue Feb. 8 on the rest of 
the charges. Boesak is accused of stealing more than 1 million rand 
(dlrs 300,000 at the time) from an anti-apartheid organization he 
headed. Boesak's lawyers had asked Foxcroft to throw out the entire 
case, saying it had collapsed after a key witness recanted. Last month, 
Boesak's former bookkeeper Freddie Steenkamp admitted he lied under 
oath due to a personal grudge when he testified against his ex-boss. 
Steenkamp, already serving six years in jail, was the state's key 
witness. Boesak said he was not disappointed by the judgment and was 
looking forward to clearing his name when the trial resumes and the 
defense can put forward its case. ``I am just glad that this part 
is over and I am looking forward to finishing it as soon as possible,'' 
he said. The courtroom was packed with Boesak's family and supporters 
who cheered and sang as he left after the ruling. Boesak appeared 
relaxed and smiled and hugged his wife and daughter, who have been 
present for most of the trial. A former minister who once headed the 
World Alliance of Reformed Churches, Boesak is accused of embezzling 
the money from the Foundation for Peace and Justice charity. Donations 
came from pop singer Paul Simon, the Coca-Cola Foundation, Scandinavian 
aid agencies and other individuals and groups. Foxcroft ruled that 
there was not enough evidence to support the counts involving a donation 
by the Coca-Cola Foundation, a children's charity and three by the 
Church of Norway. But he said potential proof remained for the other 
27 counts. Boesak played a prominent role in the anti-apartheid struggle 
that ended in the country's first all-race elections in 1994.
