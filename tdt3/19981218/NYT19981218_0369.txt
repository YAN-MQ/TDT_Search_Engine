The guys sitting around the dinette tables at VFW Post 3500 on Big 
Bend Boulevard, silently swirling their foam cups of beer, stared 
up at the eerie green picture on the television screen behind the 
bar. ``Here we go again,'' someone said. There were flashes of white 
light in the night-vision sky over Baghdad and a sound like firecracker 
pops followed by deep rumbles. ``This is something we should have 
done months ago,'' said Vince Rankin, 83, who parachuted into France 
with the 82nd Airborne Division on D-Day. ``Remember that last time, 
when Clinton called it off? We should have done it then. We've got 
to get this job done.'' The eight men waiting out the afternoon in 
the VFW hall, while divided over the impeachment of President Clinton 
and deeply cynical about American politics in general, were united 
in their support for the attack on Iraq and convinced that its timing 
had nothing whatever to do with the president's political troubles. 
Yes, they found it a little unseemly to have an impeachment debate 
at hand while American bombs were falling on the other side of the 
world, but they believed that the country would pull through it and 
that in the end the bizarre juxtaposition would have little effect 
on the outcome of either the impeachment battle or the Iraq crisis. 
``They've been planning this thing for months,'' said Chuck Bailey, 
who served with the Air Force in Germany in the mid-1950s. ``It just 
happened to fall at the time when they were taking up this impeachment 
issue.'' William Germo, who worked on Mississippi River boats for 
40 years and now tends bar at the post, said he thought the president 
should probably resign, adding, ``He should have done it two, three 
months ago.'' ``But I don't think he planned this attack to put off 
impeachment,'' Germo said. ``I don't think anybody can really believe 
that. Because look, if it was the plan, it's not working, is it?'' 
Richmond Heights is a small, economically and racially diverse suburb 
of some 10,000 people along the western edge of St. Louis. Spread 
across the second-highest hill in St. Louis County, it offers a sprawling 
view of the old river city. The houses, most of them built of blood-red 
brick from an old factory that once dominated the center of the town, 
run from tiny, $60,000 duplexes near the St. Louis city line to multimillion-dollar 
mansions on the west side, near the fancier suburban communities of 
Clayton and Ladue. More than 30 interviews over two days earlier this 
week at seven locations around Richmond Heights found hardened attitudes 
on both sides of the impeachment question, along with a sense of powerlessness 
and inevitability about the partisanship of Washington. A subsequent 
trip, after the attacks on Iraq had begun, and two dozen fresh interviews 
at some of the same locations and some new ones, showed little change 
in attitudes over impeachment but wide support for the action against 
Saddam Hussein. The great majority of those interviewed said they 
were willing to accept the president's assertion that the timing of 
the attacks had had nothing to do with the impeachment inquiry. ``I 
just simply can't believe that an American president would do that,'' 
said Reg Hanson, a truck driver watching workers unload his tractor-trailer 
outside a Home Depot. ``Even a liar like Bill Clinton. It just shows 
how far we've come that people are even asking the question.'' But 
others simply could not swallow the coincidence. ``I think the attacks 
on Iraq should have started a long time ago,'' said Greg Ward, a 38-year-old 
courier from south St. Louis who was filling his car with gasoline 
at a mini-mart on the edge of Richmond Heights. ``But I guess I am 
a little skeptical about the whole timing and the impeachment thing. 
It does seem a bit too coincidental. I think it's all Clinton's way 
of stalling for time until he can figure out what to do next.'' And 
Ward is opposed to impeachment. Those who want to get rid of the president 
had even harsher judgments. ``I was not a bit surprised when I heard 
we were bombing Iraq,'' said Lee Waldbart, owner of Alex Waldbart 
Florists, founded by his grandfather in 1872. ``This is a president 
who would do anything he can to stay in office. You look at the stuff 
he's done, all the way back to Arkansas.'' Yet just next door, at 
Greek Athenian Importing Co., a small shop filled with cheeses and 
olives and baklava, Rebecca Taysi, the owner, said she had no doubt 
that the attacks started on Wednesday so that they would be finished 
before Sunday, the start of Ramadan, the Muslim holy month. Impeachment 
had nothing to do with it, she said. ``A lot of the workers I have 
are refugees from Bosnia, and I know what Ramadan means to Muslims,'' 
Ms. Taysi said. ``If you have any contact with that religious community, 
you know why they timed it the way they did.'' And she is angry that 
Republicans are using the timing as yet another club to batter the 
president. ``I am extremely upset with this whole impeachment process,'' 
she said, ``and I think it's completely political.'' Bob Dressel, 
41, who was doing some Christmas shopping at a Zany Brainy toy store 
just across from Home Depot, also thought it was political, and it 
made him sad. Once you start believing that everything is political, 
he said, you see improper motives everywhere. ``Now we've got this 
new speaker, Bob Livingston, confessing to extramarital affairs that 
are none of our business,'' Dressel said. ``I just don't want to think 
about it at Christmas.'' Back at the Veterans of Foreign Wars, the 
impeachment debate was beginning to steal air time from the attacks 
over Baghdad, and the conversation drifted. Eventually it hit upon 
the name given to the attacks, Operation Desert Fox. No one liked 
it, especially those who fought in World War II against the original 
Desert Fox, Field Marshal Erwin Rommel. Naming for the wily German 
tank commander an operation in which you are dropping bombs instead 
of confronting your enemy in ground combat is ``an insult to Rommel,'' 
Bailey said, and there were murmurs of assent around the room. Most 
everyone seemed to agree that the attacks on Iraq would never be decisive 
if limited to air power alone and that there was little political 
or popular will for anything more. ``We've been through this before 
with Saddam Hussein, how many times?'' Rankin said. ``So now we're 
doing it again. You know what that means?'' A voice chirped up from 
the other side of the room: ``It means we're going to get a lot of 
new members!'' Rankin grimaced and chomped down on his cigar. ``No,'' 
he said, ``it means we're going to have to go through this over and 
over until we finish it, no matter who's president.''
