A twin-engine plane crashed into a mountain in bad weather, killing 
the pilot and an American engineer on board, police said Friday. Police 
Superintendent Rogelio Granada said villagers found the six-seater 
Beechcraft 95 half buried in mud late Thursday in Mabini, a mountain 
village on the outskirts of Daet town in Camarines del Norte province. 
Granada said the villagers began searching for the plane after seeing 
it plunge into a mountain a day earlier. He said the pilot may have 
lost his way in the heavy rain and strong winds. Granada said villagers 
found the decapitated remains of two people, including the Filipino 
pilot and his passenger, who was later identified by U.S. embassy 
authorities in Manila as Mark Matrigali of Florida. No other details 
were immediately available. Other identification documents were lost 
or stolen by local villagers, Granada added. Police in Daet earlier 
said Matrigali was from Melbourne, Australia, but this was later denied 
by the Australian embassy in Manila. Daet is about 220 kilometers 
(137 miles) east of Manila.
