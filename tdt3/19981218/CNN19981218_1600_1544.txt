A witch doctor in Thailand has set a record for having the longest 
hair in the world. The hair on Hu Seng La's head is four yards long. 
His last haircut was 59 years ago. The experience left him feeling 
tired and weak. Then he says, a ghost spirit entered his body and 
ordered him never to cut his hair again. Hu obeyed. When the hair's 
not piled on his head, he needs help carrying it around. Washing the 
hair is only an annual event.
