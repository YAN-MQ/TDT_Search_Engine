When President Clinton came to town this week, Tanya Ghattas took 
her four children, gave them American flags and went out to greet 
the unusual visitor. ``We waved to him, he smiled, and we were very 
happy,'' Mrs. Ghattas recalled. ``He was like the prince of peace 
for us, and we hoped that he would help us and bring peace. Now we're 
disappointed, because he's hitting the Iraqi people. I don't love 
Saddam Hussein, but I support the Iraqi people.'' Mrs. Ghattas' disillusionment 
is widely shared across the West Bank and Gaza Strip, where a visit 
by Clinton early this week gave Palestinians a sense that their national 
aspirations had gained a new level of recognition from a powerful 
new ally. For a few fleeting days, there were hopes for a breakthrough 
in peace efforts and signs of a closer, stronger relationship with 
the United States. But Clinton's failure to persuade Prime Minister 
Benjamin Netanyahu of Israel to carry out a further troop withdrawal 
in the West Bank under the latest peace accord, and the American air 
strikes on Iraq, have soured the mood. The warm welcome has been replaced 
by bitter frustration and an outpouring of sympathy by Palestinians 
for their fellow Arabs: ordinary Iraqis enduring the American attacks. 
Anger welled up for the second straight day Friday afternoon across 
the West Bank, where crowds of Palestinians took to the streets after 
mosque prayers to protest the air strikes and to denounce Clinton. 
The American flags raised for the presidential visit were trampled 
and burned, replaced by Iraqi banners and pictures of Saddam Hussein. 
The demonstrations have been dominated by militant Islamic and leftist 
groups opposed to Yasser Arafat, the Palestinian leader, and his agreements 
with Israel: Hamas, the pro-Iraqi Arab Liberation Front, and two Marxist 
factions, the Popular Front for the Liberation of Palestine and the 
Democratic Front for the Liberation of Palestine. The opposition groups 
have seized on the attack on Iraq as proof that the American sponsor 
of the Palestinian-Israeli agreements is an enemy of Arabs and of 
Islam. ``Death to America!'' Hamas marchers shouted as they walked 
through the alleys of Bethlehem Friday. ``Dear Saddam, blow up Tel 
Aviv!'' At the entrance to town, under a leftover banner that said 
``Bill Clinton: Welcome to Palestine,'' protesters hurled stones at 
an Israeli army checkpoint. A youth masked with a red-checked head 
scarf ran toward the soldiers with a flaming American flag that had 
been distributed by the Palestinian Authority when Clinton arrived. 
A teen-ager stepped on another flag as the crack of Israeli gunfire 
rang through the streets, and tear-gas canisters traced arcs of white 
smoke as they sailed toward the protesters. After a few hours of clashes, 
more than a dozen Palestinians were reported hurt. The resentment 
among Palestinians has posed a problem for Arafat, who has kept silent 
about the bombings. Although he is anxious to preserve his newly strengthened 
relationship with Clinton at a time of renewed crisis in talks with 
Israel, he cannot ignore the sentiments of his own people. So the 
Palestinian police have permitted the pro-Iraq protests, even as some 
local Palestinian television and radio stations have been shut down 
for broadcasting the demonstrations and pro-Iraqi remarks.
