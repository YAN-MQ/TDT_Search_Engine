Iraqi leaders aren't the only people harshly critical of the British 
and U.S. air strikes. There is worldwide sympathy of support for the 
Arab eye Arabs who are victims in this dispute. Several P hundred 
attended prayers. At the largest mosque in London, events in Iraq 
are being closely monitored, many are angry. I advise Tony Blair and 
Billy Clinton to get their forces out of the Middle East, to get the 
forces out of the Muslim countries or by God I swear to them what 
osama bin laden has done in Africa, the Muslims will be doing worldwide, 
wherever they mayable. In Paris there's sympathy for the fate of fellow 
Muslims in Iraq. Stop this bombardment and to pray God to return this 
population to peace. In the region itself, Palestinians vented their 
anger at the U.S. military assault. Hailed during a visit to Gaza 
just a few days ago, President Clinton and the stars and stripes, 
now the target of disaffection. Students in Egypt demonstrated sometimes 
violently at anti-U.S. protests of university campuses and at mosques. 
Even traditional allies in the gulf are questioning why Britain and 
United States are bombing Iraq. An editorial in a Bahrain daily said 
the dispute between Iraq and U.N. weapons inspectors did not "necessitate 
extensive military action." People on the streets are appalled, actually. 
They didn't believe themselves that the Americans will go and attack 
Iraq. Iraq is completely defenseless. It is completely exhausted because 
of eight years of sanctions. So Iraq this time didn't commit a grave 
crime which deserve this punishment. In Saudi Arabia, however, some 
support for the attacks. The government-sanctioned "Al bilad" newspaper 
bitterly attacked Saddam hussein. It hoped the raids would "rip out 
the heart of the dictator and free his people from his sins." Peter
