The strangest sound of all in the debate to impeach President Clinton 
was the shockingly bipartisan roar of cheers and applause suddenly 
erupting across the House of Representatives when the plaintive cry 
came forth: ``The politics of smear and slash-and-burn must end!'' 
For the briefest moment in a day of bear-pit partisanship, Republicans 
and Democrats rallied as one, finding common ground over the haunting 
pathology of character attack that has become text and subtext of 
the impeachment debate and the political beyond. For that moment, 
debaters confronted the fact that the politics of personal stalking 
is a force that can move overnight upon anyone in their ranks _ even 
the speaker-elect, Rep. Robert Livingston, R-La., who was forced to 
admit to marital infidelities on the very eve of the impeachment debate. 
Except for their united roar of anguish, however, House members offered 
the nation a day of visceral partisanship that spilled beyond the 
debating floor. In a corridor encounter, Rep. Bob Barr, R-Ga., who 
first instigated the impeachment drive against the president, emerged 
from the debate after finishing his remarks with the flourish of quoting 
President Kennedy on obedience to the law during the racial integration 
crisis of the 1960s. He was intercepted by a furious Rep. Patrick 
Kennedy, D-R.I., a nephew of the late president. ``How dare you!'' 
Kennedy demanded. ``Anybody who has been to a racist group has no 
right invoking my uncle's memory,'' he fumed, referring to a speech 
Barr made to a group that espouses white supremacist views. ``Young 
man,'' Barr began drily addressing Kennedy in reply. ``I'm a duly 
elected representative of my state,'' Kennedy snapped back. ``I'm 
impressed,'' Barr sarcastically retorted. ``I'm duly impressed.'' 
Members and staffers moving through the corridors beyond the swirl 
of high-stakes oratory could sample a parallel world of bottom feeding: 
a depth of raw-edged rumor and casual amusement about the shape of 
personal revelations certain to come, someone said, and at any minute, 
someone else advised _ as soon as Hustler, the sex magazine, sends 
something fresh up the media food chain. ``Some people view government 
as war, and anything goes,'' said Rep. Sherwood Boehlert, R-N.Y., 
who admitted to a bleak mood as he took a break from the debate. He 
smoked a cigar in the speaker's lobby, with sunlight cutting in from 
the world beyond onto the leather chairs as the two sides went at 
it just beyond the doorway to the debating chamber. ``There's so much 
at stake,'' Boehlert said quietly. ``Today it's just sort of melancholy, 
you know?'' He soon was darkly amused at the memory that last year, 
even before the impeachment struggle came to gnaw on Washington, lawmakers 
from both sides felt obliged to go off for a bipartisan weekend retreat. 
``On civility!'' he said in grim amazement. ``Can you believe that?'' 
Once the House chaplain, the Rev. James Ford, finished his gentle 
invocation (from St. Francis of Assisi: ``Where there is hatred, let 
us sow love, etc.''), members burst forth as if from gladiators' pens 
in the Roman coliseum. ``Catch the falling flag as we keep our appointment 
with history,'' Rep. Henry Hyde, R-Ill., pleaded as he led off for 
the Republicans and invoked patriotic tableaux from Bunker Hill to 
Arlington National Cemetery. Bursts of heartfelt partisan applause 
marked the opening speeches, rare in the House routine, but a vivid 
measure of the national passions at work. There were groans and boos, 
too, especially when the day's decorum reminder was read out with 
a special caution against ``engaging in comparisons of the personal 
conduct of sitting members.'' Democrats took this as a warning that 
Livingston's indiscretions were off limits, while the president's 
were dead center on the table. The day's brief unity cheer against 
the ``politics of smear'' was sparked by Rep. Dick Gephardt, D-Mo., 
the minority leader, who moved on to urge mercy and censure for the 
president. Republicans firmly rebuffed the idea as unconstitutional 
for the House. ``Let the peoples' voice come in and let fairness reign,'' 
Gephardt pleaded even as Republicans across the aisle settled into 
the day with the patient demeanor of majority politicians who sense 
it's all over but the oratory. Through all the fateful clash between 
the parties, the single most arresting outburst of the day came from 
Paul Hays, the House reading clerk, when he began reciting the content 
of House Resolution 611. At first it sounded like the highway appropriations 
bill, but then Hays read his way to the heart of the matter: ``Resolved 
that William Jefferson Clinton, president of the United States, is 
impeached for high crimes and misdemeanors.'' The chilling notion 
was officially uttered at 9:30 a.m. The fateful issue was at hand. 
What one speaker termed ``this dreadful day'' began unfolding before 
the nation.
