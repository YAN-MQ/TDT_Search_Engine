Much more news still to come on the World. Don't forget you can check 
us out anytime online at www.theworld.org. This is the World on PRI, 
that's Public Radio International. I'm Lisa Mullins. Still to come 
on the World, as U.S. and British warplanes launch air strikes against 
Iraq, some strategists are skeptical about the lasting impact of operation 
Desert Fox. I'm afraid that what we're likely to see is a month or 
two from now that the effect disappear like water in the sands of 
the desert. Also the angelic voice of Charlotte Church. First though, 
this news. For the World, I'm Derrick Stoffel in the BBC news room 
in London.
