Wu Gang won China's second Asian Games gold Friday in the ancient 
martial art of wushu, proving himself the most skilled with a spear, 
sword and bare fists. Wu won the men's changquan combined competition, 
in which wushu experts perform set martial arts routines before judges 
who look for control, grace and other skills in awarding points. Wu 
scored 9.48 with a sword in the short weapon category, 9.5 with a 
spear in the long weapon discipline and 9.56 in bare-handed changquan 
for a combined total of 28.54. Mark-Robert Rosales of the Philippines 
performed with a cudgel in long weapon and a broadsword in short weapon 
and scored a total 27.78 points. That tied him for silver with Oh 
Poh-Soon of Malaysia, who used sword and spear and also scored 27.78 
points. China had already won gold Thursday through Lang Rongbiao 
in the men's nanquan style of wushu.
