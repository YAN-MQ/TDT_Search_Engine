Speeding toward the city's distinctive needle-shaped communications 
tower in his green Chrysler New Yorker, the driver turned up a radio 
news bulletin about the air strikes on neighboring Iraq. Even before 
the report was over, he flicked off the radio and slipped in a compact 
disc of Arabic love songs. ``I've heard enough,'' said Mohammed al-Salik, 
an exporter who spent the 1991 Gulf War as a refugee in Saudi Arabia. 
``It's Saddam's problem, not ours anymore.'' Kuwait prospers while 
Iraq is pummeled. Few scars remain in Kuwait's capital from battles 
nearly eight years ago when U.S.-led forces ended Iraqi leader Saddam 
Hussein's occupation. The rebuilding and oil-fueled economic rebound 
also have appeared to wipe away fears of Saddam. For many people at 
the former epicenter of the Gulf crisis, the attacks on Iraq seem 
curiously far away _ even though American warships can be seen from 
the nicely groomed beaches and Chinook helicopters fly over the city 
ferrying crew and supplies to the flotilla. The United States arranged 
for some diplomats and their dependents to leave Kuwait. It also pledged 
to evacuate any of the estimated 8,000 Americans in the country who 
wish to leave, reports said. British Tornado warplanes based in Kuwait 
joined the attack wave that ended early Friday, British military officials 
said. Kuwait's Cabinet, led by Crown Prince Sheik Saad al-Abdullah 
al-Sabah, held an emergency session Thursday to make contingency plans 
if unrest or attacks spill over from Iraq. The National Guard was 
placed on high alert, and all military personnel were ordered to report 
to their units. But most Kuwaitis found little reason to worry. They 
shopped and rested in preparation for the dawn-to-dusk fasts during 
the Muslim holy month of Ramadan, which begins in the next several 
days. The bombing raids in Iraq were just a conversation point and 
a chance for some to quietly gloat over another Western backlash against 
Saddam. ``I'm sure Saddam never thought that invading our country 
would have him cowering from air strikes all these years later,'' 
said Khalid Tawfiq, an engineering student. ``He is the worst enemy 
of his own people.'' Others, however, marveled at Saddam's resiliency 
and wondered if he could again resurrect plans to conquer Kuwait. 
``As long as Saddam is still there, there's always reason for us to 
worry. I can say I will not be content until he is gone. But, as you 
see, he stays and stays,'' noted Ali al-Tayyib. He was taking an early-morning 
walk toward a beach side promenade dotted with American-style restaurants 
such as the hamburger chain Fudrucker's. Faded graffiti on a wall 
praises the U.S. president who led the Gulf War coalition: ``Thanks 
for Bush.'' Yet Saddam's survival and his frequent showdowns with 
the West open a social divide in Kuwait. Kuwaitis seem generally to 
favor the U.S.-led action as the way to rid the region of an aggressive 
and unpredictable regime. But the many Muslim immigrants and laborers 
in Kuwait see different elements at play: Iraqis as victims of anti-Islamic 
forces. Karamat Ali, who emigrated from Pakistan 22 years ago, frets 
over difference between the opulent Kuwait and the sanctions-battered 
Iraq. ``How can they let these people suffer? Doesn't America know 
what it is doing to Iraq? No Muslim should stand for this,'' said 
Ali, watching his sons practice cricket in a seaside park. ``Someday 
the tables will be turned. America will be punished for what it is 
doing to Iraq.''
