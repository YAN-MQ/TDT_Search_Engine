A top government official promised another security sweep targeting 
Kosovo Albanian rebels after the battered body of a prominent Serb 
official was found dumped along a roadside Friday. Yugoslav Deputy 
Premier Nikola Sainovic, addressing angry Serbs at a rally hours after 
the killing of a municipal leader just outside Pristina, called the 
death ``one more attack on Serbia.'' ``The earth is too small for 
them to hide,'' he said of the killers, accusing the Kosovo Liberation 
Army and pledging new action against them. The brutal slaying of Zvonko 
Bojanic, district mayor of Kosovo Polje, 5 kilometers (3 miles) west 
of the provincial capital Pristina, was the latest jolt to increasingly 
slim hopes that diplomacy can head off a return to full-scale war 
in the separatist Serbian province. Dozens of people have been killed 
since a U.S.-brokered agreement in October that was intended to buy 
time for a political settlement on Kosovo's future status. In the 
past week, Yugoslav army border guards killed 36 guerrillas on the 
Albanian border, unidentified assailants gunned down six young Serbs 
in a bar in the western city of Pec, and Serb police killed two suspected 
rebels and arrested 34 in a crackdown in the Pec area. Reporters Friday 
heard shelling coming from the direction of Glodjane, where police 
reportedly killed two ethnic Albanian fighters the previous day and 
captured 34 in a search for gunmen who slaughtered six young Serbs 
in Pec. Earlier this week, police also sealed off a part of Pec. Residents 
there accused police on Friday of beating some ethnic Albanians and 
detaining dozens. The claims could not be independently verified. 
U.S. Assistant Secretary of State for Human Rights Harold Hongju Koh, 
who visited Kosovo castigated the regime of Yugoslav President Slobodan 
Milosevic for a ``strong contempt for international law and human 
rights.'' In the wake of this week's upsurge in violence in Kosovo, 
Koh said the U.S. govenment ``deplores violence on all sides, and 
urges all parties to the conflict to avert a new cycle of retaliatory 
violence.'' Friday morning, Bojanic's badly beaten body was found 
dumped along the province's main east-west road, where it lay for 
hours _ bloodied, bruised and shot between the eyes. An American medic 
in the international verification team examined it and said there 
were multiple fracture wounds. The Serb official's death came hours 
after Kosovo's ethnic Albanian rebels vowed revenge for the killing 
of 36 guerrilla fighters in a border clash Monday. KLA representative 
Adem Demaci denied that rebels were involved in the killing and suggested 
it may have been staged by Serbian secret police. ``Our targets are 
exclusively police and military of the Serbian regime,'' he said. 
But Serbian police said the five assailants who broke into Bojanic's 
home and kidnapped him Thursday night wore KLA uniforms. Busloads 
of Serbs were brought to a rally in Kosovo Polje within hours, where 
Sainovic told them that ``every perpetrator will be prosecuted.'' 
``Rest assured that the state will energetically respond to each such 
attack, and as you have seen punishment has already caught up with 
some of the perpetrators of the Pec killings,'' he said. In Geneva, 
Bardhyl Mahmuti, the political representative of the KLA in Switzerland, 
warned that ``all conditions are ready for there to be a new massacre'' 
of ethnic Albanians in Kosovo with world attention ``focused on Iraq.'' 
Mahmuti said the Serbs are taking numerous actions against ethnic 
Albanians in violation of the Holbrooke accord. ``Milosevic is reinforcing 
the military and police forces in Kosovo, there is a redeployment 
of Serb forces. All the checkpoints have been retaken by the Serbs. 
There is a media offensive of propaganda'' portraying the KLA as having 
committed ``certain crimes recently against Serb civilians.''
