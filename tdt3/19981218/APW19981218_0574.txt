A Thai life insurance company will pay dlrs 25,000 to the family of 
Rizvi Fulile Zain, Sri Lanka's swimming team manager, who suffered 
a fatal heart attack at the Asian Games, games organizers said Friday. 
Thai Prasit Insurance Co. provides life, accident and illness insurance 
coverage for accredited athletes, officials and members of the media, 
the games organizing committee said. It said a check for dlrs 25,000 
would be presented Saturday to the leader of Sri Lanka's delegation 
at the games. Fulile Zain died Monday. ``Everybody was saddened by 
the sudden passing of the manager, and the president of the Olympic 
Council of Asia, Sheikh Ahmad Al-Fahad Al-Sabah, has sent a letter 
of condolence to the Sri Lankan Olympic Committee,'' said Santiparb 
Tejevanija, chairman of the organizing subcommittee.
