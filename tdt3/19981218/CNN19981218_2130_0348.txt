While U.S. military intelligence suggests there are no signs the Iraqi 
military is preparing to fight back, Iraqi leaders are remaining defiant 
as they respond to the air strikes. Brent Sadler has more. As the 
air campaign against Iraq entered its third day, the baghdad leadership 
launched a verbal assault on Washington and London. President Saddam 
Hussein was seen lashing out on Iraqi television, making his first 
visual broadcast since the eruption of hostilities. "God damn them," 
he says. "Shame will be their fate, those followers of satan and evil." 
As the United States and Britain order more attacks, Iraq's leader 
rejected any notion of compromise. His deputy prime minister Tariq 
Aziz speaks over the whine of air raid sirens in Baghdad. Lies, exaggerations 
-- Denouncing the acts of war as what he describes as criminal aggression. 
They want to misinform the world that they're doing something moral. 
They are not doing anything moral. They are committing a crime against 
a nation. Not all weapons found their intended targets. Iraq claims 
there's been widespread collateral damage. At this museum, for one, 
and the destruction of works of art it's claimed at several presidential 
palaces. Iraq will survive. The leadership will survive by God's help. 
Saddam Hussein will survive against their aggression, against their 
heinous intentions. In Iraq, as elsewhere in the Arab world, Muslims 
are preparing for the holy fasting month of Ramadan. It begins here 
shortly before daybreak Saturday. But the shadow of war looms over 
the religious event. The hardest thing for me is my children. Because 
they are afraid and I have nothing to explain for them. How could 
I explain such things for them? The prospect of a continuation of 
hostilities into Ramadan is not being ruled out by the United States 
or Britain. Ramadan is not in their mind, in their mind is aggression 
and crimes. How all this plays in the Arab world may yet impact on 
the timetable for military action. Whatever the scope of missile and 
bomb damage, the authorities here remain defiant, reiterating that 
regardless of the strikes, Iraq will no longer tolerate both economic 
sanctions and weapons inspections in the future. Something has to 
give, they say, if not, the stage is set for perpetual conflict in 
one form or another. Brent Sadler, CNN, Baghdad.
