The 2002 Salt Lake City Olympic Organizing Committee is meeting to 
investigate allegations that some members resorted to bribery to help 
the Utah city win the bid. In the meantime, the US Justice Department 
is also trying to decide whether to open its own investigation into 
the matter. The International Olympic Committee has already begun 
and inquiry. It began after Salt Lake organizers disclosed they made 
payments of nearly $400,000 in scholarships to 13 people including 
relatives of IOC members.
