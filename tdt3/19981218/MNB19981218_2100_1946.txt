It was 10 years ago tonight, Pan Am Flight 103 blew up over Lockerbie, 
scotland. On this side of the Atlanta, hundreds of mourners turned 
out at Syracuse university remembering the 35 exchange students killed 
in the explosion. At Arlington national cemetery the president marked 
the day by promising the families of some of the 270 people who died 
that he will keep the pressure on Libya to turn over the suspects 
in the bombing. If the suspects are not turned over by the time of 
the next sanctions review, we will work at the United Nations will 
R allies and friends to seek yet stronger measures against Libya. 
There is a permanent memorial to the accident there at Arlington, 
and services were also held in London, England, and in Lockerbie where 
the wreckage landed.
