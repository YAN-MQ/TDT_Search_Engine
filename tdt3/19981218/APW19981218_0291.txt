Northern Ireland's most ruthless Protestant paramilitary group handed 
over weapons Friday to an international commission _ and challenged 
its enemies in the Irish Republican Army to do the same. Under a police 
escort, representatives of the Loyalist Volunteer Force carried an 
unknown number of illegal firearms, grenades and detonators from the 
outlawed group's power base of Portadown, 30 miles (50 kms) west of 
Belfast, to the east Belfast headquarters of the commission led by 
Canada's former senior soldier, Gen. John de Chastelain. They were 
the first weapons to be received by de Chastelain's commission since 
the April peace accord gave him the job of negotiating the gradual 
disarmament of Northern Ireland's rival underground armies by mid-2000.
