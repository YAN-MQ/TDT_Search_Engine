A witch doctor in Thailand has set a record for having the longest 
hair in the world. The hair on Hu Seng La's head is four yards long. 
His last haircut was 59 years ago. The experience left him feeling 
tired and weak. Then, he says, a ghost spirit entered his body and 
ordered him never to cut his hair again. Hu obeyed. And he's right.
