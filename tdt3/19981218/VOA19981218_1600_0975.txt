OK, thanks a lot Victor. World Cup Football Champion France has said 
it will not take part in next year's Confederations Cup in Mexico 
unless the tournament date is changed. The International Football 
Federation has already moved the eight nation event from January 8 
through the 20 to July 28 to August 9. However, the new dates conflict 
with the start of the French League season. That means that some of 
the top players would not be available for the French National Team. 
Now FIFA President Seth Blatter is expected to decide whether to reschedule 
the event for a second time in order to accommodate the World Cup 
Champions. However it is questionable whether FIFA will change the 
Confederations Cup. The South American Copa Libertadores Tournament 
is not scheduled to end until June 16. The Copa America begins in 
late June and ends in early July and if the conflict cannot be resolved, 
European Champion Germany could replace France.
