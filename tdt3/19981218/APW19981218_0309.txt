A gunman demanding money from his frozen bank account held three employees 
hostage at a bank in downtown Moscow on Friday, but he gave up after 
talking to police, a news report said. The man, identified as 39-year-old 
Alexander Shreiber, took the hostages at a branch of the Russian Credit 
Bank to demand money from his bank account, which was frozen after 
Russia's financial crisis hit in August, the Interfax news agency 
said. Police managed to free the hostages after negotiating for more 
than an hour with Shreiber, who was armed with a pistol. He eventually 
surrendered. Thousands of depositors saw their bank accounts frozen 
when Russia's banks were hit by the country's latest financial crisis. 
Some people have chained themselves inside banks or threatened suicide 
in attempts to free up their accounts.
