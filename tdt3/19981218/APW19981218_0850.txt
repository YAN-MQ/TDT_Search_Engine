Iraqi President Saddam Hussein said Friday he would not ``compromise 
or kneel'' in the current showdown with U.S. and British military 
strikes. Addressing the nation on television for the first time since 
the air strikes began early Thursday, Saddam told Iraqis: ``Continue 
your resistance and, by God's will, you will be victorious. ``You 
are representing justice and all the great characteristics against 
injustice,'' Saddam said. Dressed in his fieldmarshal's uniform, the 
president spoke of the U.S._British air strikes on Iraq that have 
killed at least 25 people and wounded another 75, according to Iraqi 
officials. ``You, great Iraqi people, you have raised high the Iraqi 
flag and you have proved again that you are heroic.'' ``Continue your 
resistance, and the criminals are doomed. In the name of God, strike 
them,'' he said. ``We will not compromise or kneel in the face of 
injustice. We will not let evil triumph over virtue.'' The president 
paid tribute to the Iraqi armed forces and the air defense troops, 
who have firing anti-aircraft guns at the cruise missiles flying in 
to explode in Baghdad. ``Iraq will be victorious. God damns them. 
Shame will be their fate, those followers of Satan and evil.'' He 
ended his five-minute speech with the words: ``Long live great Iraq, 
the great Arab nation and Palestine, and doomed are our enemies.''
