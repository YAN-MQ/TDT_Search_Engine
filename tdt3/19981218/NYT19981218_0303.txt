The White House is already bracing for a new battle: tamping down 
anticipated pressure on President Clinton to resign. Friday, even 
before the first House votes were cast on impeachment, White House 
aides were accusing Republicans of orchestrating a forceful resignation 
push. ``What you have here is what I believe is a cynical political 
strategy,'' said Joe Lockhart, the White House spokesman. Lockhart 
accused Republican leaders of calling for the president to resign 
after they had told moderate House members their votes for impeachment 
were not likely to dislodge Clinton from office. Lockhart insisted 
the Republican strategy would fail. ``I can't imagine a scenario where, 
if there would be a trial on the Senate floor, that the president 
would not vigorously defend himself,'' he said. There is no evidence 
that the president would consider resigning. In Jerusalem, he said 
at a news conference earlier this week that resigning had ``never 
crossed my mind.'' In an interview with National Public Radio Friday, 
Vice President Al Gore insisted that Clinton would not resign. ``I 
think the results of a meteor strike are more likely than the resignation 
of the president,'' he said. ``He is just not going to do that.'' 
Leaders of the impeachment drive have already called on the president 
to step down voluntarily. On CBS' ``Face the Nation'' last Sunday, 
Henry Hyde, chairman of the House Judiciary Committee, said that resigning 
would be a heroic act and give Clinton a way of ``going out with honor.'' 
The same day, the majority whip, Tom DeLay, renewed his call for Clinton 
to resign. Of course, there have been calls, mostly from Republicans 
and conservatives, for Clinton to resign ever since the sex and perjury 
scandal became public last January. DeLay, for example, called for 
Clinton's resignation on Aug. 19, even before Kenneth Starr filed 
his impeachment referral with Congress. One of the first Republicans 
to demand the president's resignation last winter was Sen. John Ashcroft 
of Missouri. Last week, Ashcroft intensified his effort. His political 
action committee, Spirit of America, delivered stacks of petitions 
calling for the president's resignation to the office of Trent Lott, 
the Senate majority leader. ``The petitions demonstrate that many 
Americans believe the president has disqualified himself from service,'' 
said Jack Oliver, the PAC's executive director. Ashcroft is also looking 
for conservative support for a presidential bid. There is little evidence 
that there has been much talk of resignation elsewhere in the Senate. 
``The only way there's going to be a resignation is if public opinion 
changes so drastically that he has no choice,'' said Sen. Orrin Hatch, 
R-Utah, who chairs the Senate Judiciary Committee Sen. Patrick Leahy, 
D-Vt., dismissed a question about resignation as silly, saying no 
one on the Democratic side expected Clinton to resign. Leahy did confirm 
that a Democratic effort spearheaded by Clinton allies to get senators 
to sign an anti-impeachment petition had never gotten off the ground. 
``I've heard indirectly such discussions,'' he said. ``It's not going 
to happen. You'd have 40 potential jurors saying they won't vote to 
convict in any circumstances. Think how that would look. It just ain't 
going to happen.'' A few Democratic voices have called on Clinton 
to relinquish his office. New York Democratic Rep. Louise Slaughter 
said this week that if Clinton were impeached by the House, he should 
step down. ``I believe he would have to resign at that point because 
his usefulness would be lost in dealing with other nations.'' she 
said. In Colorado, former Gov. Dick Lamm and the state Democratic 
Party chairman, Phil Perington, both said the president should consider 
resigning if he's impeached. As for other organized resignation campaigns, 
columnist Arianna Huffington in September set up an Internet site 
called Resignation.Com. The Web site offers resignation trinkets, 
such as T-shirts that are emblazoned with ``Gore '98,'' as well as 
historical documents including famous resignation speeches, such as 
President Nixon's. ``We're at an impasse,'' Ms. Huffington said in 
an interview Friday. ``We are calling to the better angels in the 
president's nature to get us out of this. Only he can get us out by 
resigning.''
