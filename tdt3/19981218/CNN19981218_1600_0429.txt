Iraq is unleashing a barrage of accusations against Britain and the 
United States. In his first televised address since the attacks began, 
Iraqi president saddam Hussein urged all Arabs to strike out against 
what he calls the "Criminals attacking his country." Iraqi deputy 
prime minister Tariq Aziz echoed those sentiments. He calls chief 
U.N. weapons inspector Richard Butler a "cheap pawn in the hands of 
the United States". Aziz charges Butler's report is full of false 
accusations. They were saying the same lies in 1991, that they were 
aiming the military capability of Iraq, in order to enforce the withdrawal 
from Kuwait. Then, it appeared they were targeting the whole country. 
They were targeting the whole people of Iraq. The same liars, the 
same criminals, are repeating their lies and crimes. Aziz seemed to 
allude to President Clinton's political problems on Capitol Hill when 
he said the attacks coincide with "another matter I don't want to 
address." He also says the strikes are an insult to Arabs because 
they have come so close to the start of the Muslim holy month of Ramadan. 
The month of fasting. But, Aziz insists Iraq will survive.
