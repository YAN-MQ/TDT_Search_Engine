Chanting prayers and waving placards with messages like ``Blasphemous 
filth is not art,'' several hundred people from various religious 
groups gathered outside City Center on Tuesday night to protest the 
opening performance of ``Corpus Christi,'' the Terrence McNally play 
about a gay Christ-like figure. Several yards from the theater on 
West 55th Street, hundreds of people marched in support of the play, 
in a demonstration organized by the People for the American Way Foundation 
and several other free-speech groups. They carried placards bearing 
quotes about free speech, including `` `A free society is one where 
it is safe to be unpopular' (Adlai Stevenson)'' and `` `Free speech 
not only lives, it rocks' (Oprah Winfrey).'' Inside the building, 
playgoers were required to walk through a metal detector to enter 
the auditorium. To help with security, the Manhattan Theater Club, 
which produced the play, enlisted Kroll Associates, a private investigation 
and security company, as well as the New York City Police Department. 
The play, which is to run through Nov. 30, has been the focus of considerable 
dispute since May, when the Manhattan Theater Club received threats 
of violence in reaction to the play's homosexual content. Initial 
press reports indicated that the play featured a gay Christ-like figure 
who had sex with his apostles, though in fact the play includes only 
kissing between the main character, Joshua, and his friend Judas. 
McNally, the playwright, who had consistently declined to comment 
on the fuss, saying he wanted the play to speak for itself, broke 
his long silence last night to praise those who had publicly supported 
his work. ``I'm very proud of the way the arts community has come 
together on this,'' he said outside the theater before the performance 
began. ``I would be out there marching on another playwright's behalf.'' 
Lynne Meadow, the artistic director of the Manhattan Theater Club, 
and Barry Grove, the executive producer, were unavailable for comment 
last night, but in a statement issued Tuesday, they said: ``Tonight 
the press will have the opportunity to express its views on the completed 
script of `Corpus Christi' and the production. Much of the judgment 
that has been issued against this play has come from people who have 
not actually seen the play.'' At Tuesday night's demonstrations, police 
closed off one side of the street and kept the different camps of 
protesters at opposite ends of the block while ordering passers-by 
to keep moving. There were no reports of problems or arrests at curtain 
time. The protest began with a fiery speech from William Donohue, 
the president of the Catholic League for Religious and Civil Rights, 
which describes itself as the nation's largest Catholic civil rights 
group and which organized the demonstration. Holding a bullhorn inside 
an area barricaded by police, Donohue shouted criticisms toward the 
opposing group. ``You are the real authoritarians at heart,'' he said. 
``We're the ones that believe in tolerance, not you phonies.'' Many 
in the Donohue crowd carried crosses, and one demonstrator carried 
an American flag. One Catholic League member, Mary Trainor, 64, called 
the play ``a hate crime parading as art.'' Among those who marched 
in support of ``Corpus Christi'' were playwright Tony Kushner, actor 
Wallace Shawn, and television producer Norman Lear. ``This is one 
of the great celebrations,'' Lear said. ``Down the street are people 
who have the right to hate a play. This group is full of people who 
believe everyone has a right to free speech, including the most unpopular.'' 
Kushner added, ``In a certain sense it's a celebration because we 
won this fight. The play got on. They failed to stop it.'' While the 
theater had initially decided not to produce the play, it went ahead 
as planned after an outcry from artists and civil liberties organizations. 
``I wouldn't have dreamed of not being here,'' said theatergoer Ellie 
King, 66, who said she has been a Manhattan Theater Club subscriber 
from its start in the 1970s. ``When I heard they might cancel the 
performance, I was furious. This has nothing to do with religion. 
This is theater.''
