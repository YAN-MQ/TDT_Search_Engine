The Foreign Ministry welcomed the apparent breakthrough in the Kosovo 
crisis on Tuesday, while the Defense Ministry said Russia would give 
Yugoslavia military help if NATO went ahead with airstrikes. Foreign 
Ministry spokesman Vladimir Rakhmanin said Russia would probably take 
part in an international observation force put together by the Organization 
for Security and Cooperation in Europe. ``It is now time to work out 
and coordinate the mandate'' of the force, Rakhmanin said, welcoming 
an agreement mediated by U.S. envoy Richard Holbrooke. The agreement 
at least temporarily averts NATO airstrikes and calls for Yugoslav 
President Slobodan Milosevic to withdraw his forces from Kosovo, begin 
peace negotiations and allow the international observers into the 
troubled province. ``A turning point has been reached. It makes no 
sense to discuss the use of force now,'' a top Foreign Ministry official, 
Vladimir Chizhov, was quoted as saying by the Interfax news agency. 
The six-nation Contact Group will meet later this week to discuss 
further steps to bring peace in Kosovo, Chizhov said. But the Defense 
Ministry nevertheless issued a statement warning ``Russia will provide 
military and military-technical aid to Yugoslavia,'' Interfax reported. 
The ministry also warned that if there were airstrikes, Russia would 
be unlikely to ratify the START II nuclear arms reduction treaty with 
the United States and will have ``to look for possible (new) military 
allies to preserve the military balance.'' The statement said Russia 
would also likely respond by revising its relationship with NATO, 
including its participation in the Partnership for Peace program. 
Responding to threats from the Russian military to break the arms 
embargo against Yugoslavia, President Boris Yeltsin's spokesman said 
it was up to the Russian leader to make foreign policy. Yeltsin is 
at home sick this week, recovering from a respiratory infection. The 
deputy head of the presidential administration, Sergei Prikhodko, 
told Interfax that he and Foreign Minister Igor Ivanov were briefing 
Yeltsin regularly about the situation around Kosovo. Russia opposes,
