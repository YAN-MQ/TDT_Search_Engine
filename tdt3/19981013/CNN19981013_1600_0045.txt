A nervous peace prevails in Kosovo, where NATO is giving Serbian forces 
a four-day breathing period. The allies will use that time to send 
international observers to the province to see if Yugoslav troops 
have ended their campaign of terror against ethnic Albanians. U.S. 
special envoy Richard Holbrooke says it's a turning point in the crisis. 
While NATO is opting for a peaceful solution, they warn punitive air 
strikes could still come if Yugoslavia's President Slobodan Milosevic 
reneges on the deal. We hope it will Mark a turning point in the tortured 
and tragic relationships between the peoples, Albanian, Serbs, others 
in Kosovo. The Albanian people of Kosovo have, in our view, suffered 
enormously over the years, particularly in recent weeks. And months. 
And that's what brought us here. As far as a political solution is 
concerned, it will be directed towards affirming the national equality 
of all citizens and all national communities in Kosovo. The pressure 
that we were under, for these past years, and especially, I would 
say, over the past few weeks and days, we overcame, realizing that 
a peaceful solution is the only good solution.
