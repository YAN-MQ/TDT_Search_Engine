When we come back, a look at tomorrow's papers tonight and why over 
100,000 people are gatherering on one spot tonight hoping to see what 
some say is the real thing. You could accompany your data on its trip 
overseas the experience would be alarming. Local carriers handing 
it to national carriers over to cable carriers... till you don't know 
who has your data. Unless you send it through here. With the one and 
only company that owns the entire network-- local, national, and international. 
So you know who has your data. On-net. From MCI Worldcom.
