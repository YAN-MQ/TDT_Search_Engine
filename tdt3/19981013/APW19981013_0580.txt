A pint of ale and a checkup, please. That could be the order in Britain's 
village pubs under a government proposal to locate doctors' offices 
and services in unused rooms at local watering holes, The Daily Telegraph 
reported Tuesday. As the focal point for many rural communities, pubs 
would be ideal sites for such services as doctors' offices, job centers 
and post offices, according to a Rural Development Commission plan 
aimed at revitalizing rural life. People in many small towns now have 
to travel miles for such services. The commission is seeking government 
grants for village pubs so they can open unused rooms and outbuildings 
for the good of the community. ``Most pubs have a spare room or adjoining 
building which they could easily convert ... while the pub function 
room can double up as a meeting place where there is no village hall,'' 
Mary Owen, the commission's rural development officer, told the newspaper. 
Nearly half the 9,000 rural communities examined _ all with populations 
less than 10,000 _ have no post office, and 80 percent have no doctor's 
office, the Telegraph said. Almost none have job or benefit centers.
