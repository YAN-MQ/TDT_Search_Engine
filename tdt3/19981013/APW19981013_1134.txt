An explosion went off Tuesday in an open field in the West Bank, seriously 
injuring a young Palestinian man villagers said was harvesting olives. 
The cause of the explosion was not immediately known. The Israel army 
said two Palestinians were injured in the blast it believes was caused 
by an ``explosive device,'' one of the injured may have been playing 
with. The army did not specify what type of explosive it may have 
been. The army said they were investigating the incident. The blast 
occurred in the village of Azawiya, 25 kilometers (15 miles) southwest 
of the West Bank town of Nablus. Doctors at the local hospital in 
Nablus, a few kilometers (miles) away, said a young man, who was not 
immediately identifed was in critical condition from the blast and 
was not expected to live through the night.
