In a shooting attack blamed on Palestinian militants, an Israeli man 
was killed and a second critically wounded as they swam in a spring 
near Jerusalem on Tuesday. Two assailants fired pistol shots at the 
bathers from close range and then escaped in the car of the dead man, 
said Jerusalem police chief Yair Yitzhaki. The car was later found 
abandoned a short distance away, close to an army roadblock on the 
border between Israel and the West Bank. Yitzhaki said the assailants 
apparently fled on foot into Palestinian-controlled territory. The 
attack came two days before the Israeli and Palestinian leaders were 
to meet in Washington in hopes of concluding an agreement on a West 
Bank troop pullback. In the past, Palestinian militant groups have 
carried out a number of shooting and bombing attacks on Israelis in 
hopes of wrecking Israeli-Palestinian peace talks. There was no immediate 
claim of responsibility. The shooting occurred near Ora, a cooperative 
farm southwest of Jerusalem, near the West Bank. The body of the dead 
man, covered by a blanket, lay on a rocky slope near the spring. The 
second man was taken in critical condition to nearby Hadassah Hospital. 
Jerusalem police spokesman Shmuel Ben-Ruby said in a statement that 
a group of Jewish Israelis later stoned Arab-owned cars driving near 
Ora. Four cars were badly damaged, and the drivers, fearing growing 
violence, fled the area, he said. Israel radio said a curfew was imposed 
on the Palestinian village of Walajeh, which is close to where the 
getaway car was found, Israel radio said. Police and soldiers aided 
by a helicopter searched the area.
