Six men who were apparently sleeping on railroad tracks in Texas were 
killed when a 105-car freight train ran over them. The Associated 
Press quotes a spokesman for the Union Pacific Railroad as saying 
the victims might have been sleeping between the rails in the mistaken 
belief that they would be safe from venomous snakes. In the predawn 
darkness, the train's crew saw what they believed was debris on the 
tracks. Moments later, the crew said they saw heads raise up a split 
second before the six were crushed to death. The accident occurred 
near the border with Mexico, and the six men were apparently illegal 
immigrants. Authorities said they will try to identify them from fingerprints 
and dental records.
