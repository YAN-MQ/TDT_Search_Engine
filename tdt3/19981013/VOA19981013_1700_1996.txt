Turkey's defense minister says it appears Syria has shut down Kurdish 
rebel camps in a territory it controls and that the rebel leader may 
no longer be in Syria. Amberin Zaman reports from Ankara that the 
moves have helped cool escalating tensions between Turkey and Syria 
over the separatist Kurdistan Workers Party, the PKK. Speaking to 
reporters Tuesday, Turkish defense minister Ismet Segzin said Syria 
had most probably put an end to the activities of the PKK within its 
territory and in the Bekaa Valley in Lebanon, which is under its control. 
Mr. Segzin added that the PKK leader Abdullah Ocalan had likely quit 
Syria, but he declined to specify his whereabouts. Arab diplomats 
in Ankara speculated Tuesday that most likely Ocalan was either in 
northern Iraq or Libya, which is sympathetic to the Turkish-Kurd rebel 
movement. Mr. Segzin said he had obtained the information concerning 
Syria's move from the Egyptian and the Iranian foreign ministers, 
who have been mediating between Turkey and Syria over the past week. 
Tensions between Turkey and Syria escalated after Ankara threatened 
to take military action against its Arab neighbor over its continuing 
support for the PKK. Amberin Zaman for VOA News, Ankara.
