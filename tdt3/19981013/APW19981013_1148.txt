The Pittsburgh Penguins were about to become the second team in National 
Hockey League history to file for bankruptcy. The first team to do 
so was the same Penguins, whose offices were padlocked by the IRS 
in 1975 after they couldn't pay their bills. The franchise was later 
seized and sold to other owners. The same scenario isn't likely now, 
even though NHL commissioner Gary Bettman strongly opposes Penguins 
co-owner Roger Marino's decision to seek bankruptcy protection to 
sort out the team's finances. Marino said the Penguins have lost nearly 
dlrs 40 million in the 20 months since he became the primary owner. 
City councilman Dan Cohen, a member of the Auditorium Board that oversees 
the Civic Arena, confirmed today that the bankruptcy filing could 
come at any time. Mayor Tom Murphy also said published reports that 
the bankruptcy was imminent were correct. The filing would come under 
Chapter 11 of the U.S. Bankruptcy Code to protect the team from its 
creditors while it reorganizes its finances. ``Bankruptcy has been 
an option and continues to be an option,'' said Penguins spokesman 
Tom McMillan, though he said the team would prefer to resolve its 
troubles out of court. The filing could leave some creditors with 
a fraction of the money they are owed. Among their creditors is retired 
star Mario Lemieux, who only last week reached a settlement over part 
of the dlrs 33 million he claims is owed in deferred payments. A bankruptcy 
filing would not likely affect the team's day-to-day operations. Games 
would be played as scheduled, and players and staff would continue 
to be paid. Bettman participated in a meeting last week that included 
Marino, Murphy, county commissioners and a representative from SMG 
Pittsburgh Inc., the private firm that operates the arena under a 
lease with the city and county. They discussed the team's deep financial 
problems and the possibility that it could be forced into bankruptcy. 
The Penguins currently face four lawsuits stemming mostly from their 
financial mess, from Lemieux, SMG, cable TV sports channel Fox Sports 
Pittsburgh and the agency that runs the arena. That suit seeks an 
order barring any discussions about relocating the team before its 
lease commitments expire in 2007. Fox Sports Pittsburgh and SMG are 
suing for failing to make required payments under long-term deals 
that were signed to cure short-term financial crises stemming from 
the NHL players lockout in 1994-95.
