Balkan leaders Tuesday expressed their ``deep satisfaction'' over 
a breakthrough in the Kosovo crisis, but conceded they were a long 
way from solving many of their intractable differences that could 
lead to regional conflict. ``Our meeting showed that issues of security 
and solidarity can be discussed regionally and a common decision can 
be taken,'' Turkish Prime Minister Mesut Yilmaz said at the end of 
the two-day summit. Prime ministers from Bulgaria, Greece, Macedonia, 
Romania and Turkey attended the two-day meeting in this seaside resort, 
as did the foreign minister of Albania and observers from Bosnia and 
Croatia. They managed to convince Yugoslavia to allow a reference 
to Kosovo in their final statement, a development some say would have 
been impossible had U.S. envoy Richard Holbrooke failed to sway President 
Slobodan Milosevic in Belgrade. ``We express our deep satisfaction 
of this new development and of the understanding reached. We strongly 
support its full implementation so as to bring lasting peace and stability 
in the region,'' said the statement, which was also signed by Yugoslavia. 
But although it mentioned their support for the ``granting of large 
autonomy and self-government for Kosovo,'' and the leaders agreed 
on a Balkan trade center in Ankara, the exuberance did not last very 
long. ``These paragraphs are a compromise. But in compromise we are 
not being sincere and honest with ourselves. We have to speak openly,'' 
Albanian Foreign Minister Pascal Milo angrily said at a joint news 
conference. After making a case for NATO military action, he added 
that ``I am not so happy to hear that we have achieved compromise.'' 
Yugoslav Premier Momir Bulatovic was just as blunt, threatening that 
NATO strikes would make the Dayton agreement null-and-void and spread 
conflict beyond Kosovo's borders. ``Events in Kosovo can bring grave 
consequences to the countries in the region. It can only be solved 
through peaceful means,'' Bulatovic said. ``Bombs that would fall 
would interrupt any attempt at peaceful resolutions. It would also 
be a violation of the Dayton Accord, of which Yugoslavia is a signatory.'' 
Other regional problems managed to bubble through, including Turkey 
and Greece's failure to find any common ground in their longstanding 
Aegean Sea disputes, and their inability to talk about next month's 
planned deployment by Greek Cypriots of Russian-made S-300 missiles 
on the island. Their installation would lead to probable war between 
the two NATO allies, which have so far almost fought twice in the 
past 11 years. Relations with Greece were further complicated by veiled 
accusations it harbors Turkish Kurdish insurgents, which Simitis denied, 
and Ankara's own threat to intervene in Syria because of its own alleged 
harboring of such guerrillas. Greece and Syria have a defense accord. 
Simitis said Yilmaz told him about Turkey's intention to ``consider 
some kind of intervention'' if Damascus does not do something soon. 
``I told him we can't accept interventions without international approval.'' 
But the leaders did agree on the necessity of such summits, despite 
age-old disputes. Before the first summit on the Greek island of Crete 
last year, many participating countries hadn't met in decades. Simitis, 
who organized Crete, conceded that it was better to sit and talk rather 
than to brood and fight. ``No one said we are living in paradise. 
Everything has its dark, white and gray sides. But we will never solve 
problems if we don't sit down and talk,'' he said.
