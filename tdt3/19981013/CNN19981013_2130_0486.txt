This is meteorologist Valerie Voss with your "Headline News weather 
forecast" for Wednesday. Look for rain to push into the northeastern 
part of the country with a few showers stretched over the northern 
Great Lakes. Cooler air will move into the south. We will see some 
showers and storms along a cold front over Florida. The rain will 
continue in the northwest, and it will be snow in some of the higher 
elevations. High temperatures on Wednesday, just 40s over the northern 
Great Lakes. Most of the rest of the northern half of the country 
will see 50s and 60s. Look for 70s and 80s in the south. Looking ahead 
to Thursday, rain and mountain snow push across the rocky mountains 
with showers lingering in the northeast. On Friday, those showers 
are moving towards the plains states. We'll see thunderstorms in south 
Florida. And Saturday, look for scattered showers and storms throughout 
the central part of the country with a few rain showers in the northwest 
as well. Don't forget, you can find four-day forecast for 6,100 cities
