President Clinton says Yugoslav leaders must quickly implement an 
agreement on ending fighting in Kosovo if they want to avoid NATO 
air strikes. The UN secretary-general plans to send a special mission 
to Kosovo to follow up on the international efforts to end the violence 
there. And we'll talk with an authority on refugees about the need 
to protect the rights of Kosovo's displaced people as part of the 
agreement to end the bloodshed. Peace talks aimed at ending Burundi's 
five-year civil war are scheduled to open in northern Tanzania -- 
the third time Burundi's warring sides have sat down for talks. I'm 
Susan Yackee. And I'm Tom Crosby. We'll have details on those stories, 
sports and business news coming up. And we'll meet a multi-talented 
teacher who produces a new educational video series for children with 
learning disabilities. It's all in this hour of VOA News Now. First, 
a summary of world news. I'm Robert Burns, VOA News.
