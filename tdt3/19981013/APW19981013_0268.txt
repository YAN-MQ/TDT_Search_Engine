The Asian financial crisis now is threatening Singapore's social cohesion 
as well as its economy, the deputy prime minister said Tuesday. ``This 
is not just an economic problem; it is also a challenge to our social 
cohesion and our resolve to survive and thrive as a nation,'' Lee 
Hsien Loong told a group of business people in Hong Kong. The crisis 
and the relatively small depreciation of the Singapore dollar are 
forcing businesses to cut costs, especially wage costs, Lee said. 
``Wages make up 40 percent of costs,'' he said. ``In the crisis, the 
exchange rates of many countries have fallen sharply, but their nominal 
wages have not gone up to compensate. We therefore need to reduce 
wage costs significantly.'' Layoffs are approaching high levels not 
seen since the last recession in 1985-86, and the minority ethnic 
Malay population has suffered the brunt of the cuts. Unemployment 
has reached 3.2 percent. Many of Lee's comments on Singapore's situation 
in the Asian crisis struck a chord in Hong Kong, where many companies 
have cut wages by 10 percent. Hong Kong's economy also has been dragged 
down by external factors and its strong currency. ``For us, the driving 
forces of the slowdown are largely external, and beyond our control,'' 
Lee said. The government has introduced a series of initiatives to 
ensure economic recovery and is putting together a cost-cutting package, 
to be announced in November, that will enhance the country's competitiveness, 
he added. Comparing Hong Kong's and Singapore's financial services, 
he said: ``The old phrase was that in Hong Kong what was not explicitly 
forbidden was allowed, whereas in Singapore what was not explicitly 
allowed was forbidden. I believe the part about Hong Kong is still 
true, but we have changed the Singapore part.'' Lee, who is also chairman 
of the Monetary Authority of Singapore, stressed that country's economic 
fundamentals and its banking system are sound. ``Banks may lose money, 
but they will not become insolvent or inadequately capitalized,'' 
he said. He also said that the government will continue to respond 
to the market in its land sales and not try to use its position as 
a major supplier of land to set the property market. Singapore property 
prices are ``not yet ready to go up sharply and may weaken a little 
further,'' he said. Commenting on his view of what caused the Asian 
financial crisis, he said: ``The preponderant factors in Asia were 
pre-existing banking weaknesses, compounded by government mistakes 
that caused investors to lose confidence and stampede.'' Lee also 
said that Malaysia's capital controls and other measures intended 
to solve its economic problems go ``against conventional views of 
the way to tackle the problem.'' Singapore's economy is closely linked 
to its neighbor Malaysia, where the government has fixed the exchange 
rate, halted trading of its currency overseas, and promoted greater 
bank lending in efforts to promote growth. ``Singapore hopes that 
Malaysia's policies will succeed in restoring its country to economic 
health, but backtracking from globalization cannot be the answer for 
the world,'' he said.
