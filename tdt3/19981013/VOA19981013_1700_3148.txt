Mexican president Ernesto Zedillo has begun an official tour of Europe 
with a three-day stop in Britain. Mr. Zedillo is expected to meet 
with government and business leaders in London to promote trade and 
economic cooperation with Mexico. British officials say the ongoing 
conflict in troubled Chiapas state also is expected to be discussed. 
Britain is Mexico's second biggest investor next to the United States. 
Relations between Mexico and Britain have expanded due to Mexico's 
increased role in international trade organizations in North America 
and Europe.
