Finally this evening -- catching up on the most remote place we know. 
Last week we told that tristan da cunha, deep in the south atlantic 
between Africa and south America, nearest neighbors 1,500 miles away, 
had gone on the Internet. So we sent them an E-mail, how was this 
changing things? And they E-mailed us back. "Nice of us to write," 
they said. You know, the weather can be pretty bad and the mail ship 
only gets there six times a year if they're lucky. Brian Baldwin, 
the island's adnistrator.now." they post it, says Mr. Baldwin at the 
island's only shop for all 300 residents to read. Mr. Baldwin learned 
on the web that tristan may be making more news. Given where they 
are, tristans will be first in the world to see the dawn of the new 
millennium. As for surfing the Internet in his spare time, as we had 
suggested. "I can hardly sit around and do that," Mr. Baldwin said, 
"not at $10 a minute."
