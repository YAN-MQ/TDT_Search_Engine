crisis on PRI, Public Radio International. The World is sponsored 
by the Capital Group Companies investing throughout the World for 
individuals and institutions and The World is sponsored by Merck, 
dedicated to the needs of society through pharmaceutical research 
and consumer education to improve the quality of life. Merck, committed 
to bringing out the best in medicine. Stay tuned for more of The World 
coming up. In the rest of the program, life in the territories controlled

China cautiously introduces information technology but maintains control 
over its people's access to information. We'll hear those stories 
next, but first, here's the Franklin Institute Forecast. Tonight cloudy 
with a few showers, low 55, Wednesday, a shower possible early but 
partly Sunny by afternoon, high 66, and Thursday partly to mostly
