Holding the threat of air strikes over his head, the international 
community is watching to see if Slobodan Milosevic will do what he 
says. They want him to make good on an agreement reached yesterday. 
In his first twiced address since the Bosnian war, he portrayed the 
agreement as a victory because it avoided NATO strikes. It allows 
residents to return home. It requires international monitoring and 
set as timetable for autonomy talks for Albanians. NATO forces will 
be close by. They are giving him four days to comply. Monitoring force 
will include Americans. There's concern the longer they are in Kosovo, 
the greater the chance they could become targets. I think those of 
you who recall Bosnia will recall that there were people on the ground 
in Bosnia when air strikes occurred. So it's not a black or a white 
situation. It was a situation where at certain times the hostage problem 
is real. But over time, ways were found to ensure that when the threat 
of air strikes was imminent, that the efforts were made to ensure 
that they weren't -- that as best as possible people couldn't be held 
hostage. Since Milosevic instituted the crackdown in February, more 
than 3,000 people have fled their homes. Even though he says he has 
pulled his troop, frightened residents are refusing to go back.
