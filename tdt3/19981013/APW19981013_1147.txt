An Iranian official said Tuesday that Tehran has detected a change 
in Afghanistan's Taliban militia and would not oppose a visit by a 
Taliban representative, state-run Iranian radio said. The report quoted 
Deputy Foreign Minister Mohsen Aminzadeh as saying that ``the Taliban's 
behavior has changed'' as a result of pressure from the United Nations 
and the international community as well as Iran's decision to mass 
troops on its border with Afghanistan. Asked about the possibility 
of the Taliban sending an envoy to Tehran, Aminzadeh said Iran was 
``not opposed to visits by any envoy whose objective is to free the 
Iranians detained by the Taliban,'' the radio report said. The broadcast 
was monitored by the BBC in London. The Taliban, which now controls 
about 90 percent of Afghanistan, does not have diplomatic relations 
with Iran and accuse it of supporting the anti-Taliban opposition. 
More than 60 Iranians are still believed to be in Taliban custody, 
including some 30 that Iran says were drivers delivering humanitarian 
aid. Aminzadeh's comments came a day after 10 Iranians released by 
the Taliban returned home aboard a Red Cross plane, according to Iran's 
official Islamic Republic News Agency. On Sunday, the Taliban returned 
the bodies of three slain Iranian diplomats. Both gestures were seen 
as trying to temper tensions between the Taliban and Iran, which has 
massed more than 200,000 troops on its eastern border with Afghanistan. 
The Taliban acknowledged that renegade militiamen killed eight Iranian 
diplomats and a journalist after the Taliban captured the northern 
Afghan city of Mazar-e-Sharif on Aug. 8. Iran had demanded the Taliban 
return the bodies of the Iranians and send the killers for trial in 
Tehran. Six bodies were returned earlier, but the Taliban has refused 
to hand over the suspected killers. Taliban leaders, who are mostly 
Sunni Muslims, accuse Iran of arming and financing Afghanistan's northern-based 
opposition, which includes the country's minority Shiite Muslims. 
Most Iranians also are Shiite Muslims.
