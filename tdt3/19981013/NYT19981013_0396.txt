Buoyed by vibrant demand for microprocessors, Intel Corp. reported 
unexpectedly strong third-quarter results Tuesday. Although earnings 
were essentially flat relative to a year earlier, they were well above 
analysts' estimates, which were raised after Intel advised last month 
that it would beat its own forecast. The strong results at Intel, 
the world's leading maker of chips for personal computers, came even 
as it faces the toughest competition in more than a decade. Last week 
Advanced Micro Devices Inc. also reported unexpectedly strong results, 
as well as market research statistics showing it was gaining market 
share from Intel, particularly in PCs priced under $1,000. National 
Semiconductor Corp.'s Cyrix division is also making inroads at the 
low end of the market; IBM remains a threat and newcomers like Integrated 
Device Technology, Rise, Transmeta and Metaflow loom on the horizon. 
Intel said it expected fourth-quarter sales to be up slightly from 
the third quarter, while profit margins would be flat to slightly 
up as well. Intel had originally forecast third-quarter revenues to 
be flat relative to the second quarter, later amended that to a gain 
of 8 percent to 10 percent, and actually reported a 14 percent gain. 
In another sign of resilience in the chip industry, Cypress Semiconductor 
Inc., a maker of specialized memory chips, said it remained marginally 
profitable in the third quarter, defying expectations of a loss. Intel 
reported results after the close of the market. Intel shares closed 
at $83.56, down $1.88. Cypress shares closed at $8.81, down 6 cents. 
``Intel did a fabulous job capturing the demand opportunities out 
there and that will continue into the fourth quarter,'' said Mark 
Edelstone, an analyst with Morgan Stanley Dean Witter &AMP; Co. He 
said Intel benefited from the greater efficiency offered by new chip 
production technologies that crammed more circuitry into smaller pieces 
of silicon. For the quarter ended Sept. 26, Intel reported earnings 
of $1.56 billion, or 89 cents a diluted share, down slightly from 
$1.57 billion, or 88 cents a share, in the comparable period a year 
earlier. The share figures reflect an increase in the number of shares 
outstanding. Revenues grew 9 percent, to $6.73 billion, from $6.16 
billion in the third quarter of 1997. Analysts had expected 80 cents 
a share, according to First Call Corp. ``We are pleased with our overall 
performance in the last quarter,'' said Craig Barrett, Intel's president 
and chief executive, who added that the results reflected ``growth 
across nearly all of our geographies and product lines, including 
strong microprocessor sales.'' Intel officials said they had expected 
demand to recover in the fourth quarter, due partly to normal seasonal 
fluctuations, but also because PC manufacturers appeared to have worked 
through an inventory glut that had depressed microprocessor sales 
in previous quarters. Actual demand, particularly in the later part 
of the quarter, proved stronger than they had expected, they said. 
But Drew Peck, an analyst with Cowen &AMP; Co., cautioned that this 
level of demand was not likely to last. ``Clearly the personal computer 
companies are not going to show the same improved results we've seen 
at Intel, so the only conclusion you can reach is there was significant 
inventory replenishment taking place in the third quarter,'' he said. 
``I think results will improve for Intel in the fourth quarter as 
well, but not nearly so dramatically.'' Intel has responded to increased 
competition by improving its manufacturing efficiency and cutting 
operating costs, but also by segmenting its product line. The company 
now offers the Celeron line at the low end; Pentium II for mainstream 
desktop and laptop computers, and Pentium II Xeon for work stations 
and servers. Intel officials said average selling prices had remained 
flat this year despite greater competition.
