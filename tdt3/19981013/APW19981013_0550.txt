South African Foreign Minister Alfred Nzo said Tuesday he was hopeful 
of a breakthrough in lengthy negotiations with Portugal and Mozambique 
on energy provisions to his country. Nzo said during an official visit 
to Portugal that in the next few days he expected to receive technical 
recommendations on the possible supply of electricity from the Portuguese-built 
Cahora Bassa hydroelectric dam in Mozambique, which borders South 
Africa. Nzo said he was ``very hopeful'' that the report would help 
resolve the dispute over how much South Africa should pay for the 
electricity. ``What's still under discussion is the tariff question,'' 
Nzo told a news conference. ``Our experts will give us their view 
on what needs to be done,'' he added. Portuguese Foreign Minister 
Jaime Gama said officials were discussing a new framework for energy 
provisions from the huge Cahora Bassa scheme ``in the context of the 
great potential for energy provision in southern Africa.'' The dam, 
which was built by the Portuguese before Mozambique became independent 
in 1975, never became fully operational during Mozambique's 15-year 
civil war. A multinational effort to repair and refurbish the dam, 
located on the Zambezi River in northern Mozambique, was completed 
last year. However, South Africa reportedly has balked at the price 
demanded by Portugal for the electricity. Officials declined to reveal 
the prices under discussion.
