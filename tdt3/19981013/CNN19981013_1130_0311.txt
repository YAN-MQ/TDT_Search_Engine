The Kremlin says that President Boris Yeltsin will probably spend 
the rest of the week at his country, home recovering from bronchitis. 
Yeltsin cut short his trip to central Asia yesterday. There was also 
concern over Yeltsin's health after he stumbled during an appearance 
in Uzbekistan. A local newspaper also suggested Yeltsin was disoriented 
and made rambling remarks. Doctors say Yeltsin was feverish, and insisted 
he cut his trip short. Yeltsin's health has long been an issue, especially 
since he underwent heart bypass surgery two years ago.
