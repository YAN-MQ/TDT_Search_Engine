"headline news." hello, i'm denise dillon. the threat of a nato military 
attack appears to be working in yugoslavia. president clinton on monday 
confirmed yugoslav president slobodan milosevic has agreed to end 
the violence against ethnic albanians in the kosovo province. the 
announcement came after nato ambassadors approved an activation order 
authorizing air strikes if milosevic does not comply with united nations 
security council demands. they call on him to observe an immediate 
cease-fire in kosovo, withdraw special troops from the region, allow 
refugees to return home and begin talks with ethnic albanians. u.s. 
envoy richard holbrooke met with milosevic monday after intense negotiations 
over the weekend. he later he traveled to belgium to brief nato ambassadors 
on the talks. holbrooke plans to meet with milosevic again tuesday. 
nato secretary-general javier solana says execution of the activation 
orders will be delayed by four days. he says the threat of air strikes 
will keep pressure on milosevic to keep his commitments. even at this 
last hour, i still believe diplomacy can succeed and the use of military 
force can be avoided. but the responsibility lies on shoulders of 
president milosevic. he knows what he has to do. once again, today 
was an important day in which we've been able to see some progress 
we made. and we hope very much with the decision taken today the process 
will move forward in the coming hours. the "u.s.s. eisenhower", carrying 
70 combat aircraft, is among the vessels standing by in the mediterranean 
sea, in case nato decides to go ahead with military action.
