Pure feeling. Judy Garland didn't just deliver it when she sang, she 
embodied it, no matter how ragged her voice or how histrionic her 
delivery. The sound of that much emotion so densely concentrated wasn't 
always easy to take. Like no other American singer, Garland erased 
the line between laughter and tears, suggesting a barely suppressed 
hysteria with each gasp and choked-up cry. Edith Piaf, who was seven 
years Garland's senior, also delivered pure feeling, but it was harsher, 
even sadder, and more animalistic. Even so, Garland, who conveyed 
the same mixture of wracked fragility and resilience, was America's 
answer to the Parisian legend. Both women were tiny, explosive and 
self-destructive, dying at 47 yet paradoxically coming to symbolize 
survival over terrible odds. Until the release of ``Judy'' (32 Records), 
a four-CD career retrospective that comes with an excellent video 
showing highlights from her 1963-64 television variety show, Garland's 
recorded legacy was scattered among several different labels. This 
set, produced by Joel Dorn and his son, Adam, with the Garland archivist 
Scott Schechter, encompasses the breadth of Garland's recording career, 
from an early 1929 recording of the 7-year-old vaudevillian through 
a stunning, stripped-to-the-bone 1969 concert performance of ``Over 
the Rainbow,'' recorded in London five months before her death. ``Judy'' 
goes out of its way to intersperse familiar songs with fascinating 
esoterica and previously unheard concert performances. Her version 
of ``Over the Rainbow'' in ``The Wizard of Oz,'' for instance, is 
prefaced with a dramatic re-creation made for radio of the composer 
Harold Arlen ``teaching'' Garland the song, which he sings in a sweet 
cantorial tenor. By 1946, Garland's wistful lost-little-girl sound 
had ripened into a brassier post-vaudevillian trumpet. The set includes 
many crucial movie songs, the most wrenching being ``The Man That 
Got Away'' from ``A Star Is Born.'' The selections from Garland's 
years at Capitol include two swinging Nelson Riddle-arranged performances 
and two dark-night-of-the-soul selections from her Gordon Jenkins 
album, ``Alone'' as well as are high points from her landmark 1961 
concert album, ``Judy At Carnegie Hall.'' Disks three and four concentrate 
almost entirely on excerpts (in mono) from Garland's television show 
and include her first television duet with Liza Minnelli as well as 
duets with Tony Bennett (Garland's favorite male singer), Bobby Darin 
and Barbra Streisand (their famous medley of ``Get Happy!'' and ``Happy 
Days Are Here Again''). Also here are her rousing post-Kennedy assassination 
version of ``The Battle Hymn of the Republic'' and a heart-stopping 
rendition of her favorite song, ``Through the Years.'' Even at its 
most disturbing, it's powerful stuff. A performer who always gave 
her all, Garland more than lived up to her nickname (and title of 
her first Capitol album) ``Miss Show Business.''
