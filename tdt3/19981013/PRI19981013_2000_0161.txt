A former intelligence analyst is being charged with spying for the 
Soviet Union. Retired Army Sergeant David Sheldon Boone allegedly 
sold U.S. Military secrets over a period of four years in return for 
more than $60,000 in cash. NPR's Neal Conan reports. Boone allegedly 
walked into the Soviet Embassy in Washington, D.C. in 1988 to sell 
the first of a series of documents he took from his job as a signals 
intelligence analyst with the National Security Agency. He was later 
transferred to a signals unit in Germany and provided documents there 
to a KGB contact he knew as Igor. The material allegedly included 
a target list for U.S. tactical nuclear weapons and a 300-page handbook 
of U.S. reconnaissance programs. Lured to a meeting with a FBI plant 
posing as a Russian spy, Boone said he started because, "I needed 
the money, plus, well, plus I was very angry." If convicted, Boone 
faces the possibility of life in prison or, if certain conditions 
are met, he could receive the death penalty. Neal Conan, NPR News, 
Washington.
