ZAGREB, Croatia (AP) _ U.S. Ambassador to Croatia William Dale Montgomery 
said Tuesday ``it was clear'' that the Croatian defense minister, 
who resigned suddenly on Monday, wanted to reorganize the Croatian 
army along NATO standards to make it suitable for the Partnership 
for Peace program. The ambassador declined further comment on the 
unexpected resignation of Defense Minister AndrijaHebrang. Hebrang 
said his decision was prompted by President Franjo Tudjman's rejection 
of his attempts to replace two of his associates. The two are considered 
hard-liners who oppose any reform that would give the military less 
power and make its affairs more transparent to the public. Hebrang's 
resignation raised fears that the hard-liners were taking full control 
of the military, which could then further diminish Croatia's chances 
to join western institutions. Montgomery said Partnership for Peace 
requires the army to have ``a transparent budget process (and) civilian 
control of the military.'' ``In conversations with Mr. Hebrang, and 
from his public statements, it was clear he also stated that these 
were his objectives,'' Montgomery told reporters. He said the United 
States expected Croatia ``to have achieved this by now,'' but added 
nevertheless that the offer for Croatia to join the program by fulfilling 
its conditions still stands.
