When you next go hiking in the hills outside Madrid, you might come 
across a stocky young man with thick, wavy hair, very Russian-looking, 
very polite, and never know that inside his head he was considering 
how to phrase and shade the melody in a piece by Schumann; how to 
render the shape of a Schubert sonata, or how to bestow counterpoints 
on something by Glinka to create a fantastical variation. This pianist 
in the open air would be Arcadi Volodos, who astonished an audience 
at Avery Fisher Hall in February when he played Rachmaninoff's Third 
Concerto and his own exuberantly festooned version of Mozart's ``Turkish'' 
Rondo, and who plays a solo program of Schumann, Liszt and Russian 
music on Wednesday evening at Carnegie Hall. The Russian pieces, he 
says, balance ``exaltation and darkness,'' consisting of some late 
Scriabin, ``a music of insects in the forest,'' and four of Rachmaninoff's 
``Etudes-Tableaux,'' all somber and in the minor mode. Volodos' extraordinary 
technique _ a matter not only of speed (though the velocity of his 
right hand is amazing) but also of color, textural clarity and, especially, 
consistently singing tone _ fits him for the Everests of the piano 
repertory. And indeed, his first recording, made in 1996 for Sony 
Classical, begins with a reinterpretation of Horowitz's dazzling memento 
of ``Carmen.'' But he denies he is a specialist in virtuosity. In 
his New York hotel room, recently, he spoke with quiet passion about 
a vast range of piano music, from Mozart concertos and Schubert sonatas 
(evidently a great love) to works of Messiaen. The piano's whole literature, 
it seems, is a country he has surveyed, and he likes the look of most 
of it. Now 26, he could go in almost any direction. That he has reached 
this position of authority at such a young age is a tribute to his 
intellectual powers, and is all the more remarkable given that he 
began serious study of the piano only 10 years ago. He had the advantage 
of being born into a musical family: his father is a professional 
operatic baritone, and his mother is also a singer. Maybe some singing 
genes have come down into his fingertips, but if so, it took him a 
while to discover them there. As a boy at the leading music school 
in Leningrad, he wanted to be a conductor and took the piano only 
as a secondary study. When, at 16, he decided to devote himself to 
the instrument, he was, bewilderingly, refused entry to the piano 
department of the Leningrad Conservatory. Leningrad, he reasonably 
concluded, was not for him. He went to Moscow and, at the conservatory 
there, became a pupil of Galina Eguizarova. ``She was not a piano 
teacher but a great musician who could see far into the future of 
her pupils,'' Volodos said. His musical relationship with her was 
very close, and it was decisive. He was already familiar with recordings 
by some of the gods of the piano: Rachmaninoff, Cortot, Gieseking 
and Schnabel are the first names he mentions, and after them, the 
great Russians of the midcentury, like Samuel Feinberg, Vladimir Sofronitsky 
and Maria Yudina. With Ms. Eguizarova as his mentor, these exemplars 
became his colleagues. When he was 21, he left Russia for Paris, where 
he studied for a year with Jacques Rouvier. Then he went to Madrid, 
following his Venezuelan girlfriend, though it must have helped that 
in the Spanish capital he would be able to resume contact with Ms. 
Eguiza-rova, who was by then teaching at the Queen Sofia Music Academy. 
There he also took lessons with Dmitri Bashkirov. And there he has 
stayed, living in an isolated house in the country, where he can enjoy, 
he says, silence and solitude, and the chance to work on his music 
away from the piano. By 1995, when he was 23, he had come to the attention 
of Jean-Hugues Allard, Sony's executive vice president for classical 
music, who brought him together with Thomas Frost, the producer of 
many of the recordings Horowitz made from 1962 on. Here was a crucial 
test. At their first encounter, Volodos dared to play Horowitz's ``Carmen'' 
showpiece, which he had memorized by listening intently to Horowitz's 
1968 recording, overseen by Frost. The producer was impressed, not 
only by the young pianist's resemblance to Horowitz in his extreme 
skill and expressive spontaneity but also by the differences. This 
was not a Horowitz sound-alike but an artist with his own ideas. Volodos' 
first recording duly followed, with Frost producing. ``He is the most 
talented young pianist I've seen in many years,'' Frost said recently. 
``He has everything: imagination, color, passion and a phenomenal 
technique to carry out his ideas.'' The CD demonstrates a spectacular 
technical mastery, of course, but also a musicianship that has been 
widely and justly praised. Amid the fireworks come more reflective 
items _ two Rachmaninoff songs transcribed by Volodos, a Bach slow 
movement adapted by Feinberg _ that bring out the pianist's melodic 
fluency, his use of color to define counterpoint and his generous 
warmth of tone, together with a rhythmic solidity that marks him out 
as something other than the ``old-fashioned virtuoso'' of publicity 
releases. Volodos is determinedly his own man. Only his repertory 
might be called old-fashioned, though he responds vigorously to such 
an accusation. ``All music is contemporary,'' he said. ``If music 
interests me, it is of the present. There is no such thing as dead 
music.'' And the music that interests him is by no means all from 
the main virtuoso track: his first London recital, in 1996, included 
an early, unfinished Schubert sonata, and the Schumann in his Carnegie 
Hall program is the underplayed ``Bunte Blatter.'' When invited to 
talk more particularly about his musical preferences, aims and hopes, 
he becomes reticent, repeating the sage old formula that ``where words 
end, music begins.'' But he is firm and eloquent about the kind of 
preparation he does, which is exhaustive. ``If I am studying a Schubert 
sonata, I need to hear all the sonatas, the songs, the quartets, in 
order to discover the composer's thought,'' he said. ``To study just 
one `Etude-Tableau' of Rachmaninoff, for example, would be absurd.'' 
And indeed, his Rachmaninoff performances seem to be informed by a 
knowledge of the songs, of how, as it were, the composer sang. His 
seriousness about breadth of awareness _ revealed also in how he plays 
concertos, looking with close attention at his partners in the orchestra, 
responding to them _ provides one reason for his contempt for competitions, 
in which superficial performers can often get by very well. ``In music 
there are no winners and losers,'' he said. ``The whole idea is ridiculous.'' 
Even so, he is clearly one of the music world's winners at the moment, 
and he may well remain so if he can preserve his feeling of responsibility. 
``For me to play at Carnegie Hall is not important,'' he said. ``My 
success with the audience is not important. What matters is whether 
Schumann and Scriabin have a success. This is music that has been 
in existence for many years, played by great musicians. What is my 
success?''
