Terrence McNally's ``Corpus Christi,'' now at the Manhattan Theater 
Club, is a thoroughly professional production: the work of an accomplished 
playwright, directed by Joe Mantello, the man responsible for the 
staging of McNally's bracing, neo-Chekhovian ``Love! Valour! Compassion!'' 
at the same theater in 1994. The actors are eager and, occasionally, 
able. Yet the entire production has the teeth-grinding earnestness 
of an amateur theatrical put on by a neighborhood encounter group. 
Talk about raised consciousnesses! This is a gay-oriented ``Greatest 
Story Ever Told,'' in which the Passion of Jesus has all of the mystery 
of a ``Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs'' put on by a bunch of fellows 
who appear to shop at the Gap. There are many lines that are meant 
to be funny, and a lot more that are unintentional hoots. True, the 
language is raunchy. And on a Saturday night, after a long week of 
doing good works and, maybe, digging the beatitudes of the Sermon 
on the Mount, they like to dance up a storm, sometimes getting very, 
very drunk. Even Joshua, which is the character name for the Snow 
White (or Jesus) role. After his first sexual encounter with Judas, 
and later, after the Miracle of the Loaves and Fishes, when he gets 
it on with Simon, Joshua solemnly tells his partner: ``You can come 
no closer to me than your body. Everything else you will never touch. 
Everything important is hidden from you.'' The disciples being just 
guys, after all, that's good enough for them. It is difficult to know 
what McNally has in mind. To celebrate the compatibility of Christian 
beliefs and gay life? To point out the hypocrisy of much Christian 
practice in relation to gay believers? To state the obvious? It would 
be nice to be able to defend ``Corpus Christi'' in view of the pre-opening 
threats designed to abort the production, and the later sidewalk demonstrations, 
which were meant to intimidate the theater as well as audiences. The 
show, unhappily, is a fizzle; defensible, yes, but only on the grounds 
of the First Amendment. Art has nothing to do with it. Another nonstarter 
is Dare Clubb's ``Oedipus,'' a deconstructed adaptation of the Oedipus 
saga, which takes four hours to work wan, anachronistic variations 
on the story we mainly know from Sophocles' ``Oedipus Rex'' and ``Oedipus 
at Colonus.'' Presented by the usually astute Blue Light Theater Company, 
the exhausting, often ineptly croaked production is at the CSC Theater, 
staged by the author with unwarranted love and admiration. Clubb's 
main conceit is that Oedipus (Billy Crudup) goes to the oracle at 
Delphi as a young man, still living in Corinth with his (unknown to 
him) foster parents, King Polybus and Queen Merope. Told that his 
fate is to murder his father and marry his mother, the impressionable 
teen-ager, eager to honor the gods, rushes home and slays Polybus, 
only to learn that he, Oedipus, is a foundling. The poor kid has to 
start all over. This much could be a rather funny revue sketch, suitable 
for presentation at year-end faculty revels. It is, unfortunately, 
no more than the first hour of Clubb's ``Oedipus,'' which unravels 
like a slow-motion ``Odyssey'' as Oedipus tries to go home again to 
the natural parents he doesn't remember. Adventures of mounting inconsequence 
accumulate and, by the end of the fourth hour, confusion reigns, leaving 
the audience more exhausted than even the actors. Clubb is no wordsmith, 
or maybe he is and that's the problem. Writing in a poetic vein, he 
produces intentionally overstuffed lines that sound as if they had 
been decorated by Laura Ashley. Put in a reference to a babbling brook 
here, hang a simile associating something to a starry night there. 
His blunt anachronisms are even sillier. There is his peculiar fondness 
for the word copulate, as something done by kings, queens and common 
people. The word stands out, for a purpose maybe, but without point 
in dialogue that otherwise makes free use of other contemporary vulgarisms. 
You might think he was writing about meerkats. The cast also includes 
the Oscar-winner Frances McDormand, who plays both Merope and the 
Sphinx to no great advantage. Like everyone else in the cast, she 
spends much of the time rolling around on the stage floor or walking 
on her knees, like Jose Ferrer in ``Moulin Rouge.'' The play ends 
with a crucifixion. If, like me, you had seen ``Corpus Christi'' the 
night before, that's at least one crucifixion too many in a single 
week.
