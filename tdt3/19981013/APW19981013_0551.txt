As any farmer will tell you, hens don't crow. But tell that to a Tehran 
resident whose chicken is making headlines by breaking laws. Of nature 
that is. The hen began her attempts at crowing soon after her mate 
was slaughtered before her eyes by their owner, the official Islamic 
Republic News Agency reported. ``Right after the slaughter, the hen 
started making weird noises and after several days of hard practice 
she successfully produced the old tune of cock-a-doodle-doo,'' IRNA 
said quoting Tuesday's Iran newspaper. At first the owner thought 
a young rooster was learning to crow but was stunned to see that it 
was the hen that had ``decided to fill the absence of its partner 
by imitating him,'' IRNA said. It did not identify the owner or give 
other details about his coop. The crowing story began when the rooster 
lost its timing and started to crow at odd times instead of only in 
the mornings, which annoyed the neighbors. To placate them, the owner 
killed the rooster and treated his household to ``a nice chicken dish,'' 
IRNA said.
