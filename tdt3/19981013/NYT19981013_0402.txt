An admitted Mafia member testified at his murder trial Tuesday that 
while in jail he spied for the government on four other inmates _ 
the mastermind of the World Trade Center bombing and three others 
eventually convicted of terrorist acts _ and reported their plans 
for further acts to the authorities. The defendant, Gregory Scarpa 
Jr., testified in federal District Court in Brooklyn that, using a 
tiny ``spy camera'' that a jail official had given him, he worked 
undercover for the FBI for about a year in 1996 and 1997 after gaining 
the confidence of the others while all of them were being held in 
a high-security area of a federal jail in Manhattan. At the time, 
Scarpa was awaiting his current trial on charges that include participation 
in five gangland murders, racketeering and other charges. The four 
other inmates, including Ramzi Ahmed Yousef, who was convicted in 
November 1997 as the chief plotter of the World Trade Center bombing, 
which killed six people, were either being tried or were awaiting 
trial. The three others were convicted with Yousef, one in the 1993 
Trade Center bombing and two in an aborted plot to blow up American 
airliners in the Far East. Scarpa said he told the FBI that associates 
of the four men planned to kill a prosecutor in one of Yousef's trials, 
attack a federal judge whom Scarpa did not identify, and attack ``government 
installations'' that he did not specify. Among the things he photographed, 
he said, were notes he received from Yousef, who Scarpa said wanted 
the notes returned, and ``timing devices.'' He did not explain what 
those devices were or how the inmates managed to obtain them in the 
jail, the Metropolitan Correctional Center in lower Manhattan. The 
U.S. Attorney's office in Manhattan, which prosecuted Yousef and the 
others, the U.S. Attorney's office in Brooklyn, which is prosecuting 
Scarpa, and the FBI all declined to comment on his testimony. It could 
not be learned how reliable or useful the information had been and 
why the cooperation he described had not helped him obtain a lenient 
plea deal in his own case. Scarpa's lawyer, Larry Silverman, also 
would not comment on why he did not get such a deal. Scarpa's late 
father, Gregory Scarpa Sr., was a ruthless Mafia murderer at the same 
time that he was also a longtime informer for the FBI against the 
mob. As Silverman questioned his client as he testified in his own 
defense, he suggested that he had hoped that his actions in cooperating 
with the government would get him leniency in his own case. Scarpa, 
47, also told the jury that he had passed on information from the 
inmates that other terrorists ``were on their way'' to the 1996 Olympic 
games in Atlanta to check out the security for a possible bomb attack 
there, but his testimony did not indicate that they were responsible 
for the bomb that did explode there, killing one person. Federal authorities 
have most recently linked that bombing to a fugitive they are seeking, 
Eric Robert Rudolph. Scarpa has admitted that he is a member of the 
Mafia's Colombo crime family, as his father was, though he denies 
the murder charges he is accused of. His father, who died in 1994, 
had said that as part of his work for the FBI, he had terrorized a 
Ku Klux Klan member into disclosing where the bodies of three civil 
rights workers were buried after they had been slain in Mississippi 
in 1964. Tuesday, his son testified that ``senior,'' as he referred 
to his father, had told him that he had obtained the information by 
putting a gun in the Klan member's mouth and saying, ``I'll blow your 
head off.''
