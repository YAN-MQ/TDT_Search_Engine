The rhythm comes from Jamaica, but the passion is Brazilian. Reggae 
has been good to Gilberto Gil who in 1980 hit number one in the Brazilian 
charts with a version of Bob Marley's, No Woman, No Cry. On his new 
live album, Gil covers two of Marley's hits, Is This Love? and Stir 
It up. Reggae's mix of rhythm and politics fits comfortably in Gilberto 
Gil's repertoire. The singer-composer frequently combines performance 
with political activism. He was one of the leaders of Tropicalia, 
a 60s cultural movement that led to a renaissance in the Brazilian 
arts. When a military regime came to power in 1969, Gil went into 
exile in London where he refined his blend of international rhythms 
and jazz. Back in Brazil since 1974, Gil has established a dual career 
as an environmental activist and singer. Activist Gilberto Gil is 
president of the Blue Wave Foundation, a group that supports water 
conservation nationwide. Musician Gilberto Gil still tours the world 
and records at least one album a year. Here is a sample of his latest, 
Quanta Live. Gilberto Gil wraps up our program for today. Join us 
again tomorrow for another spin of The World or anytime on line at
