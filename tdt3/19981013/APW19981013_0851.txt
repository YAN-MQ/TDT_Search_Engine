The world outcry to settle the Kosovo conflict and avert disaster 
for thousands of refugees camped in the open helped produce a diplomatic 
settlement in Belgrade. But it came too late to help an ethnic Albanian 
infant who died of exposure Tuesday. On a cold, rain-washed morning 
in a green valley near the village of Lanist, Besart Buqa's life ended 
after only five weeks _ five difficult, miserable weeks with only 
plastic sheets to keep out the elements. Besart died of the cold about 
6 a.m. Tuesday, his parents said. He had spent his entire, brief existence 
as a refugee from the Serb forces that drove his family from their 
home in nearby Budakovo. His mother, Gjyle, and father, Zeke, only 
stared solemnly as the women of the family washed the baby in Muslim 
tradition. The child was then wrapped in a tiny bundle and taken by 
the men to a small hole dug just outside the refugee encampment and 
buried. The Buqas live with only minimal shelter in one of three small 
encampments up a little valley washed by a cold stream. While the 
inside of their plastic hut seems dry, it's very cold. There is no 
way to transfer the warmth from the fire outside to the interior of 
the plastic huts that dot the hillsides of this tormented province. 
It was this growing cold that claimed Besart's life, and as winter 
approaches no doubt will claim others. The child's parents seemed 
to be in shock, staring emotionlessly into the middle distance. Only 
the grandmother wailed at the fate of her grandchild, the only sign 
of emotion in the small knot of people. The family is afraid to return 
to their village. Now, the elements have reduced their number.
