More of Russia's children are living on the streets or in orphanages 
because of the country's financial troubles, and they are committing 
suicide in greater numbers, the head of the U.N. Children's Fund said 
Tuesday. UNICEF Executive Director Carol Bellamy told reporters that 
children's welfare had already worsened during the transition to a 
market economy, when ``the focus has been largely on economic and 
political reform with a significant deterioration in education and 
health.'' According to UNICEF research, since the 1991 collapse of 
the Soviet Union, more Russian children are living on the streets, 
killing themselves, abusing drugs and contracting AIDS. Education 
is underfunded and children are dropping out of school in greater 
numbers. The situation is only worsening amid Russia's latest financial 
crisis, as families slip further into poverty and the government has 
even less money to pay teachers and doctors. Though children in Russia 
are still better off than in many countries, a drop in state support 
for them is ``a very fast-growing problem,'' Bellamy said. Russia's 
``indicators are not nearly as bad as many of the countries in which 
we are working. But it's the trend of the indicators that are the 
most troubling,'' she said. The number of children in infant homes 
in Russia, for example, has gone up by a third from 1989 through 1996, 
UNICEF figures say. Over the same period, prosecution of minors has 
almost doubled, as has the suicide rate for males age 5 to 19. The 
number of children enrolling in kindergartens is down by 10 percent. 
Though official figures are not available for the last year and a 
half, Bellamy said these trends are likely continuing. To combat the 
slide, Bellamy said UNICEF is developing programs that target youth 
most at risk, and is trying to raise more money. UNICEF's programs 
in Russia started two years ago, and only about dlrs 1 million is 
allocated to Russia annually. Despite the worsening conditions for 
children, Bellamy praised the Russian government for early ratification 
of the U.N. Convention on the Rights of the Child, which commits it 
to ensuring that all children under 18 get health care, education 
and psychological and social support. But with the government considering 
drastic cost-cutting measures, UNICEF is pushing Russia not to forget 
education and health as it drafts its economic program. ``Even in 
the most difficult of economic times the burden can't just fall on 
the social development and social protection side of the budget,'' 
Bellamy said. ``This is an issue that has to be raised over and over 
and over again.''
