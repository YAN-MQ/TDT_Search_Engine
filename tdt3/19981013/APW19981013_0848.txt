An illegal fireworks factory exploded Tuesday in central Mexico, carving 
a crater into a residential area and flattening two entire blocks. 
At least 45 people were injured, and 15 more were trapped under the 
rubble, news media reported. There were no immediate reports of deaths 
in the explosion in Tultepec, 30 kilometers (20 miles) north of Mexico 
City, according television and radio reports. The Televisa television 
network, which broadcast images of the devastation, said at least 
45 people were injured and that rescuers were searching for at least 
15 more. A crater indicated the place where the explosion occurred, 
and all of the houses in a two-block area were reduced to rubble. 
Houses on surrounding blocks were damaged as well. The radio station 
Formato 21 said authorities were concerned about another illegal fireworks 
plant only 800 meters (1/2-mile) away that has a large amount of gunpowder 
stockpiled inside, and were working to make sure that didn't explode 
as well. Tultepec is known for its fireworks, and many residents produce 
them illegally in their homes. In June 1997, an explosion at one home 
killed three people.
