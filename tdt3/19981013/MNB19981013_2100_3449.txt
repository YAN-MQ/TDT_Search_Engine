we switch quickly to the morning papers. Chiefly "The Washington Post." 
The lead story -- these are under consideration -- Henry Hyde says 
he wants to meet the end of the year deadline for the impeachment 
hearings. Henry Hyde is narrowi or considering it begin, down to two 
charges, lying under oath and obstruction of justice. He says he doesn't 
expect to expand the investigation but will look into the Kathleen 
Willey evidence if Starr sends him more information. As clear a signal 
as we have ever seen in this -- no more on Whitewater and travelgate 
unless Starr brings it up. Nry Hyde stressed to "The Washington Post" 
these are not decisions, just considering. And an interview with Al 
Gore in a story about his vice-presidency thus far, he told "The Washington 
Post," "they'll come up with some sort of scenario for closure which 
is way short of impeachment." Gore about the president's trubs and 
a suggested way out of it. Before we go, here's Jane pauley with a 
quick program note. Thanks, Brian. Tonight on "time and again," the 
murder that remains a mystery after almost two years. Jonbenet Ramsey, 
killed in her Boulder, Colorado, home in Christmas 1996. Her own parents 
are among the suspects. A long, some say bungled investigation and 
the case is now before the grand jury. Coming next on "time and again." 
"Time and again," hosted by Jane pauley next here on MSNBC. That is 
our broadcast for this Tuesday night. We hope to see you right back 
here at this same time tomorrow night. I'm Brian Williams, and for 
all of us here, good night.
