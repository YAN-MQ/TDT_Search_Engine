Watching classmates strut past in designer clothes, Wendy Williams 
sat silently on the yellow school bus, wearing a cheap belt and rummage-sale 
slacks. One boy stopped and yanked his thumb, demanding her seat. 
``Move it, trailer girl,'' he sneered. It has never been easy to live 
on the wrong side of the tracks. But in the economically robust 1990s, 
with sprawling new houses and three-car garages sprouting like cornstalks 
on the Midwestern prairie, the sting that comes with scarcity gets 
rubbed with an extra bit of salt. Seen through the eyes of a 13-year-old 
girl growing up at Chateau Estates, a fancy name for a tin-plain trailer 
park, all the rosy talk about the nation's general prosperity carries 
a certain mocking echo. The everyday discussion in the halls of Reagan 
Middle School here touches on computer toys that can cost $1,000, 
family vacations to Six Flags or Disney World and designer clothes 
with recognizable labels like the Nike Swoosh or Tommy Hilfiger's 
logo. Unlike young people a generation ago, those today must typically 
pay fees to play sports for the school sports teams or band. It costs 
$45 to play in the youth summer soccer league.It takes money to go 
skating on weekends at the White Pines roller rink, to play laser 
tag or rock-climb at the Plum Hollow Recreation Center, to mount a 
steed at the Horseback Riding Club, to gaze at Leonardo DiCaprio and 
Kate Winslet at the Plaza Cinemas, to go shopping for clothes at Cherryvale 
Mall. To be without money, in so many ways, is to be left out. ``I 
told this girl, `That's a really awesome shirt. Where did you get 
it?'' said Wendy, explaining that she knew it was out of her price 
range, but that she wanted to join the small talk. ``And she looked 
at me and laughed and said, `Why would you want to know?''' A lanky, 
soft-spoken girl with large brown eyes, Wendy pursed her lips to hide 
a slight overbite that got her the nickname Rabbit, a humiliation 
she once begged her mother and father to avoid by sending her to an 
orthodontist. For struggling parents, keenly aware that adolescents 
agonize over the social pecking order, the styles of the moment and 
the face in the mirror, there is a no small sense of failure in telling 
a child that she cannot have what her classmates take for granted. 
``Do you know what it's like?'' asked Wendy's mother, Veronica Williams, 
``to have your daughter come home and say, `Mom, the kids say my clothes 
are tacky,' and then walk off with her head hanging low.'' This is 
not the desperate poverty of Chicago housing projects, where the plight 
of empty pockets is worsened by the threat of gangs and gunfire. Wendy 
lives in relative safety in a home with both parents. Her father, 
Wendell Provow, earns $9 an hour as a welder. Her mother works part-time 
as a cook for Head Start, a federal education program for the poor. 
Unlike students in some urban pockets, isolated from affluence, Wendy 
receives the same education as girl from a $300,000 house in the Idle 
Oaks subdivision. The flip side of that coin is the public spectacle 
of economic struggle. This is a place small enough where people know 
the personal stories, or, at least, repeat them as if they did. Even 
in this down-to-earth town, where a poor boy nicknamed Dutch grew 
up to become president, young people seem increasingly enchanted with 
buying, having, spending and status. R. Woodrow (Woody) Wasson, the 
principal at Reagan Middle School, makes it a point to sit down with 
every child and ask them about their hopes and dreams. ``They want 
to be doctors, lawyers, veterinarians and, of course, professional 
athletes,'' said Wasson, whose family roots here go back to the 19th 
century. ``I don't remember the last time I heard somebody say they 
wanted to be a police officer or a firefighter. They want to do something 
that will make a lot of money and have a lot of prestige.'' He said 
a teacher in a nearby town has been trying to recruit high school 
students for vocational studies to become tool-and-dye artisans, a 
trade that can pay $70,000 a year. ``The teacher can't fill the slots,'' 
Wasson said. ``Nobody's interested in that kind of work.'' It is not 
surprising that children grow up believing that money is so important, 
given the relentless way they are targeted by marketers. ``In the 
past, you just put an ad in the magazine,'' said Michael Wood, the 
director of research for Teenage Research Unlimited, a marketing consultant 
in suburban Chicago. ``Now savvy marketers know you must hit them 
at all angles _ Web sites, cable TV shows, school functions, sporting 
events.'' He noted the growth of cross-promotions, like the deal in 
which actors on the television show ``Dawson's Creek,'' which is popular 
among adolescents, wear clothes by J. Crew and appear in its catalog. 
But young people get cues in their everyday lives. Some spending habits 
that would once have been seen as ostentatious _ extravagant parties 
for small children, new cars for teen-agers _ have become familiar 
trappings of middle-class comfort. The stock market, although it is 
sputtering now, has made millionaires of many people in Main Street 
towns. Building developers here recently won approval to build a gated 
community, which will be called Timber Edge. ``Wendy goes to school 
around these rich kids,'' her mother said, ``and wonders why she can't 
have things like they do.'' A bright girl with a flair for art, writing 
and numbers, Wendy stays up late most nights, reading books.``The 
Miracle Worker'' was a recent favorite. But when a teacher asked her 
to join an elevated class for algebra, she politely declined. ``I 
get picked on for my clothes and living in the trailer park,'' said 
Wendy, who never brings anyone home from school. ``I don't want to 
get picked on for being a nerd, too.'' Her mother, who watched three 
other daughters drop out of school and have babies as teen-agers, 
has told Wendy time and again: ``Don't lose your self-esteem.'' One 
time a boy at school was teasing Wendy about her clothes _ ``They 
don't even match,'' he laughed _ and her humble house in the trailer 
park. She listened for a while. He kept insulting her. So she lifted 
a leg _ clothed as it was in discount jeans from the Farm &AMP; Fleet 
store _ and kicked him in the shins. He told the authorities. She 
got the detention. It became clear to Wendy that the insults were 
not going to stop. It also became clear that shin-kicking, however 
deserved, was not going to be the solution. She went to a guidance 
counselor, Cynthia Kowa Basler, a dynamic woman who keeps close tabs 
on the children, especially girls who fret about their weight and 
suddenly stop eating lunch. ``I am large,'' she tells the girls, ``and 
I have self-esteem.'' Wendy, who knew that Ms. Basler held sessions 
with students to increase their self-confidence, went to the counselor 
and asked for help. ``I feel a little down,'' Wendy told her. The 
counselor gathered a group of eight students, including other girls 
like Wendy, who felt embarrassed about their economic station. In 
this school named for Ronald Reagan, the students were told to study 
the words of Eleanor Roosevelt. One of her famous quotes was posted 
above the counselor's desk: ``Nobody can make me feel inferior without 
my consent.'' As a group, the students looked up the definition of 
inferior and consent. And then they read the words out loud. ``Again,'' 
the counselor instructed. ``Louder,'' the counselor insisted. Again 
and again, they read the inspirational words, until they had the words 
memorized. In role-playing exercises, the children practiced responses 
to taunts, which sometimes called for nothing more than a shrug. ``Mrs. 
Basler told us to live up to our goals _ show those kids,'' Wendy 
said. ``She told us that things can be a lot different when you're 
grown up. Maybe things will be the other way around then.'' Wendy 
smiled at the notion. Life still has plenty of bumps. When Wendy gets 
off the school bus _ the trailer park is the first stop, so everyone 
can see where she lives _ she still looks at her shoes. She still 
pulls her shirt out to hide a belt that does not quite make the grade. 
And she still purses her lips to hide an overbite. But her mother 
has noticed her smiling more these days. And Wendy has even said she 
might consider taking an advanced course in math, her favorite subject. 
``I want to go to college,'' Wendy said the other day. ``I want to 
become a teacher.'' One recent day, she popped in to see the counselor's 
office, just to say hello, then walked back down the halls, her arms 
folded around her schoolbooks. Ms. Basler stood at the doorway and 
watched her skip away, a student with so much promise, and so many 
obstacles. For the girl from Chateau Estates, it is a long way from 
the seventh grade to college. ``She's going to make it,'' the counselor 
said, with a clenched fist and a voice full of hope.
