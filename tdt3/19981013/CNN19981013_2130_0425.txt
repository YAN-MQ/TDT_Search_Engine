A Georgia woman who claims she has received hundreds of messages from 
the virgin Mary and Jesus held her final public audience today. Nancy 
fowler addressed as many as 100,000 people at her suburban Atlanta 
farm. They came from as far away as Brazil and Australia. Some say 
they're seeking miracles. Others, who've heard the messages before, 
say they've witnessed miracles -- a woman cured of cancer and a rosary 
turning to gold. Many Catholic leaders have distanced themselves from 
fowler. Her messages typically urge the faithful to love each other 
and to seek peace. She delivered her messages monthly at first and 
then once a year. Last year she announced this would be her final 
public message. She reportedly plans to move to Florida.
