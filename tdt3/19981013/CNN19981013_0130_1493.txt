pop star elton john is bound for broadway with a new musical. and 
he's using his talents to tackle a legendary opera. jim moret has 
the story. such elaborate lives it is "aida" as you've never seen 
it before. the love triangle between the would-be leader of ancient 
egypt, the daughter of pharaoh and an enslaved nubian princess has 
been updated, courtesy of elton john and tim rice, the same oscar-winning 
songwriting duo responsible for the soundtrack to disney's "the lion 
king," as well as the smash broadway play. obviously, there is the 
opera by verdi, which is very, very solemn and very operatic and very 
kind of theatrical. this is also very theatrical, but it's very, very 
-- i would say very camp and more along the lines of a "dreamgirls" 
or a "rocky horror show." no expectations oh why the 19 new songs 
range from ballads to rock 'n' roll. "elaborate lives" is another 
disney production bound for broadway, but staged first in atlanta 
as a joint venture between walt disney theatrical productions and 
the nonprofit alliance theater company. the opera and the musical 
was written here in atlanta. i live here, and so that meant that i 
could, by staging it at the alliance theater, i could come and check 
on it during rehearsals. you know, it just tied in very nicely. it's 
a beautiful feeling. elton john attended a $1,000-a-person preshow 
cocktail party sunday night to raise money for the elton john aids 
foundation. it is one of many fund-raising efforts. last year, he 
brought in nearly $500,000 by selling thousands of outfits from his 
extensive wardrobe. he also stages an annual tennis tournament and 
a celebrity-studded academy awards bash, and recently introduced for 
sale "elton 2," a slatkin and company scented candle. picked the fragrance 
out myself. here we are, ginger mango. and it's available now, and 
you can get smaller candles, bigger candles, dinner table ones. since 
1992, john's foundation has funded more than $15 million internationally 
for direct patient services and education, which is now becoming a 
major focus of the organization. we want to get to younger people 
earlier, to try to get into the schools, to tell people what's going 
on. and if you hit people when they're younger, they do listen. if 
nothing else, elton john compels people to listen. now, theatergoers 
can hear his new take on an age-old story. it's a very modern-day 
thing. it's not going to appeal to everybody. it's not going to appeal 
to, you know, the stuffy theater critic, but the people en masse, 
i think they'll love it. jim moret, "cnn entertainment news," atlanta.
