A neighborly American tradition is coming to an end. After 70 years, 
the welcome wagon is ending its home visits from representatives bearing 
baskets of coupons and gifts. Beginning next year, newcomers will 
get a packet of information in the mail instead. Welcome wagon representatives 
were making 1.5 million home visits in the 1960s. That's fallen to 
500,000 visits. The company blames its decline on the rise of two-career 
households, which makes it harder to find people at home.
