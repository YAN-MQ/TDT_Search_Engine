I'm Dave DeForest, VOA News. President Clinton is warning Yugoslav 
president Slobodan Milosevic he must quickly implement an agreement 
on ending fighting in Kosovo if he wants to avoid NATO air strikes. 
Mr. Clinton says Mr. Milosevic's promises are not enough. The U.S. 
leader says the international community will be looking for concrete 
actions. Mr. Milosevic has reached a deal with U.S. special envoy 
Richard Holbrooke to withdraw Serbian forces from Kosovo, maintain 
a cease-fire and begin serious talks on self-government for the province. 
The Serbian government has also announced that elections will be held 
in Kosovo in 1999. President Clinton is cautiously optimistic about 
the agreement, as we hear from VOA's David Gollust at the White House. 
Mr. Clinton says the world community prefers compliance to conflict, 
but that NATO remains ready to act militarily if there is not immediate 
and visible action by Belgrade to fulfill the agreements. In a talk 
with reporters as he left the White House for an education event, 
the president said the difference between the deal hammered out Monday 
by U.S. envoy Richard Holbrooke and past understandings is that there 
will be intrusive air and ground monitoring of Serb actions. We're 
not dependent upon our hopes. We have a verification system. There 
will be facts -- facts on the ground which will tell us whether or 
not the compliance is there. Mr. Clinton said NATO will have unrestricted 
air surveillance rights while a 2,000 member OSCE verification force 
will monitor developments on the ground. David Gollust, VOA News, 
the White House.
