The fungus that wiped out the potato crop in Ireland and caused widespread 
famine and death has resurfaced. Allard beutel reports on how scientists 
are fighting a new strain of this 19th century bug in "tech trends." 
These potatoes are the victims of what some scientists call the "world's 
worst agricultural disease" -- late blight. During the 1840s, the 
fungus that causes late blight spread over Europe. One result was 
the infamous potato famine that killed an estimated 1 million people 
in Ireland. Now, 150 years later, stronger, more aggressive relatives 
of that original fungus are making themselves at home across the world. 
Scientists believe the new fungus strains were exported to Europe 
from Mexico during the 1970s, then they were shipped worldwide. Agricultural 
experts estimate during the past several years, late blight has caused 
about $3 billion in annual crop losses, and it's cut international 
potato production by 15%. This plot is a susceptible cultivar, and 
as you see that there's absolutely nothing left. Bill fry has studied 
the fungus for the past 25 years. He says there are several things 
that make the new strains so virulent, including a resistance to chemicals 
that kill fungi. The strains that have come out of Mexico recently 
are more aggressive than the strains that were here previously. Scientists 
say the only way to truly beat late blight is to develop potatoes 
that resist all forms of the disease. Researchers are using cross-breeding 
and molecular biology to create new plants. We now have about 60 different 
types of potatoes available to send out to the world that have this 
resistance. Researchers say they understand their new late blight 
resistant potatoes must also be a product the international food market 
will buy. So, we have chosen to develop a lot of different kinds. 
And they will meet demands for -- for various markets. Scientists 
hope to have the new late blight resistant plants in worldwide use 
within five years. Allard beutel, CNN.
