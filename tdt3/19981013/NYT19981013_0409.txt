A bull market might have taken it as good news. The Eastman Kodak 
Co. Tuesday reported third-quarter earnings of $398 million, up nearly 
72 percent from the quarter last year, and a penny ahead of analyst 
forecasts. It was way ahead of schedule on its cost-cutting campaign. 
It had stopped the cash hemorrhage from its portfolio of digital products. 
Yet investors reacted as though they had been kicked in the stomach. 
Kodak's shares plummeted $11.1875, or more than 13 percent, to $72.375. 
The reason: Kodak's earnings may have been up, but its revenues declined. 
In a jittery market, good news whispers, bad news shouts. The strong 
negative reaction astounded most analysts. ``Anyone who looked for 
top-line growth in 1998 simply doesn't understand the Kodak story,'' 
said Rebecca F. Runkle, an analyst with Morgan Stanley Dean Witter. 
``You buy Kodak for its cost-cutting initiatives and its ability to 
drive earnings growth.'' Still, many analysts sympathize with the 
investors' angst. ``Kodak is doing the right things, but they can't 
force growth,'' said B. Alexander Henderson, an analyst with Prudential 
Securities Research. Patience is scarce on Wall Street these days, 
added Jonathan Rosenzweig, an analyst with Salomon Smith Barney. ``The 
thesis on Kodak has always been, `They'll cut costs today, grow top 
line tomorrow,''' he said. ``Investors are wondering how far away 
tomorrow really is.'' Clearly, no one was cutting Kodak any slack. 
News that could be viewed as a glass half-full was seen as a sign 
of one in dire need of a refill. An example: during a conference call 
with analysts, Kodak's chief financial officer, Harry Kavetas, said 
that the company would spend about $100 million for employee bonuses 
in 1998. A bull market might have agreed that Kodak's robust earnings 
entitled employees, many of whom received no bonuses last year, to 
a share of the pie. Instead, analysts reacted simply to an unanticipated 
hit of 20 cents a share. ``It's yet another cost we never thought 
would be in there,'' Rosenzweig said. That sort of glumness cast a 
pall over all Kodak's bright earnings numbers. The company reported 
net earnings of $398 million, or $1.21 a share, on revenue of $3.42 
billion. Its profit from operations as a percentage of sales rose 
to 18.5 percent, from 11.5 percent a year ago. And it said it had 
reduced annual costs by $650 million, $150 million more than its target 
for the year as a whole. ``How many stocks can you think of where 
you know you're going to get at least a 20 percent earnings increase 
just on cost-cutting?'' asked Ulysses Yannas, an analyst with Mercer, 
Bokert, Buckman &AMP; Reid. But none of that could compensate for 
revenue that fell nearly 10 percent. Overseas, sales dropped by 17 
percent, or $231 million, to $1.8 billion. The slide was dizzyingly 
steep in emerging markets _ an area that Kodak has historically counted 
on for its fastest growth. Sales were down by 55 percent in Russia, 
22 percent in China, 33 percent in South Korea. ``The emerging markets 
got a lot dicier than we thought,'' Kavetas said. Nor did domestic 
sales, which fell by $106 million, to $1.59 billion, provide much 
succor. In the United States, sales of film, Kodak's highest-margin 
product by far, was down by 10 percent. Even motion-picture film, 
which Mr. Kavetas has always called a star performer, showed its first 
sign of weakness in several years. ``We didn't lose share,'' he said. 
``People are making fewer movies.'' Still, the domestic numbers are 
not as somber as they look. Kodak sold its retail film stores last 
year, cutting out a chunk of revenues. It shifted about $80 million 
in revenue to a joint venture, Kodak Polychrome Graphics. Changes 
in the way it accounts for promotional expenditures caused another 
$52 million hit. Even the shortfall in film sales may have been temporary, 
caused by retailers miscalculating demand and overstocking the previous 
quarter. ``Retailers order too much film; they work off their inventory; 
they order again,'' said Jack Kelly, an analyst with Goldman, Sachs. 
``This has been Kodak's story forever.'' But perhaps most important, 
Kodak is addressing its sales slump head-on. The company invested 
more than $700 million in China this year., putting up plants that 
can import huge spools of film _ at lower tariffs than sales-ready 
rolls _ and split them into rolls that can be sold at cut-rate prices. 
At home, Kodak recently contracted to buy Imation's medical imaging 
business. And, Kodak continues to invest heavily in a ``digitization 
strategy,'' an attempt to use digital technology to bolster conventional 
photography sales. For example, Kodak has teamed up with America Online 
and Intel to enable consumers to receive their processed photographs 
in digital form. For now, these are all net costs. But Kodak assumes 
they will soon yield robust sales. ``We delivered less top-line growth 
than even we had expected,'' Kavetas said. ``Now we are going to turn 
the big guns onto the initiatives that drive top-line growth.''
