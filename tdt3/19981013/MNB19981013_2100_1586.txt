with that, time for a look at the weather across the country. With 
that we go to WNBC television in New York and good friend meteorologist 
Joe witte. Remember that huge spot on Jupiter? That is the size of 
the earth, and that's one huge hurricane way up there. Let's get to 
the important forecast. For the game tonight, dts it's been drizzlely 
tonight. Re's Manhattan. Rain showerers, fortunately moving to the 
north. There's the Bronx, the stadium, and the rain showers moving 
north. Let's check the rest of the world. We find ourselves with mostly 
dry weather for most of the country, cool over the northern plains 
as cool air drives in from Canada. 52 degrees for a pair in Seattle 
and New York City at the present time. Radar confirms one frontal 
system moving up and over the cky mountain states. Mountain snotes 
in high elevations of Montana. Rain showers for 0 preliminary pia, 
Seattle, and Portland. We have that frontal system trying to slide 
to the east coast. Just enough rain to give a little drizzle overnight 
and earlier tonight at the game. Temperatures tomorrow rather warm 
because of the clear skies we have. Overnight lows though cool over 
the northern plains states. Jack frost making a visit. Rm 80's and 
70's in the nation's midsection. Hot 90's still around Phoenix. Brian? 
Joe witte, thank you very much
