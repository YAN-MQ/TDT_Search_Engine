Today, in Washington, several dozen black farmers protested what they 
say is widespread racism at the agriculture department. The black 
farmers and agriculturists association has filed a class-action suit 
against the department. Former agriculture secretary Mike Espy visited 
the protesters during the lunch break from his trial on corruption 
charges, at the court house, where the protest took place.
