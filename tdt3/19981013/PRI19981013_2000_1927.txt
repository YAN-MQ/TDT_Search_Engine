Japan's parliament has passed a bill that will inject more than $500 
billion into the banking system to pay off loans that can't be recovered. 
The Tokyo stock market fell by two percent after the announcement 
because the package falls short of expectations. Juliet Hindall reports 
from Tokyo. Politicians have spent months wrangling over how to revive 
the country's banks which are saddled with enormous unrecoverable 
loans. The money will be used to shore up banks that are in trouble 
due to the downturn in the economy, but which have a viable future. 
The huge amounts of money reflect the deep problems facing the Japanese 
economy. One reason why the banks are currently in such trouble is 
years of lax rules on disclosure. Even now, no one really knows just 
how much the bad loans held by the banks are really worth. Juliett 
Hindall, BBC News, Tokyo.
