The president of Russia's breakaway Chechnya region arrived on a five-day 
visit Tuesday to participate in an international human rights conference. 
During his stay, President Aslan Maskhadov will be protected by a 
body guard assigned by the Foreign Ministry. However, he will not 
meet with any of Poland's government leaders. ``We did not seek such 
meetings to avoid provoking tension in Poland's relations with Russia,'' 
said Mariusz Kaminski, a Solidarity parliament member who helped organize 
the visit. Maskhadov will meet with some prominent politicians, including 
the leader of the Solidarity bloc, Marian Krzaklewski, and the leader 
of the extreme right party, Movement for Poland's Renewal, Jan Olszewski. 
He will be accompanied by the Chechen Foreign Minister Movladi Ugudov. 
Maskhadov won a landslide election victory in January 1997, but during 
his time in office, Chechnya has seen a steep rise in kidnappings 
and other crimes. No country has recognized Chechnya's claims of independence, 
and Russia still considers it a semi-autonomous Russian republic. 
The conference, which starts on Wednesday, was organized by the upper 
house of parliament. Other prominent guests expected are the expelled 
Chinese dissident Wei Jingsheng and former Soviet dissident Sergei 
Kovalyov.
