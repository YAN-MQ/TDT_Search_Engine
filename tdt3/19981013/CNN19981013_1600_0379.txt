Both parties are getting testy as the last minute wranglings continue 
on Capitol Hill. Democratic minority leader Dick Gephardt calls the 
republican majority inept. And he says the GOP is the reason members 
are still in Washington instead of in their home districts campaigning 
for re-election. As I've said many times, this is the worst Congress 
that's ever been in the building. They have not done their work, and 
now they want to get everything done in one Bill in the last five 
minutes, and it's not a reasonable way to act. They've been very inept 
in the way they've run this Congress. House democratic caucus chairman 
Vic Fazio accused republicans of using the president's problems as 
cover for their own political shortcomings.
