Turkey's defense minister says it appears Syria has shut down Turkish 
Kurd rebels' camps and territorial controls and that the rebel leader 
may no longer be in Syria. Ismet Segzin said it is the impression 
Turkey received from Egyptian and Iranian mediators in Ankara's dispute 
with Syria. He said Turkey has to verify the impressions. Turkey has 
been threatening military action unless Syria ends its alleged support 
for Kurdish rebels fighting in southeastern Turkey.
