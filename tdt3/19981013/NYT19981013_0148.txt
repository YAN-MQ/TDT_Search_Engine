It's autumn in New York. A chill is nudging through the last trace 
of summer's warmth, and the leaves hint of turning. The signs can't 
be missed _ except, maybe, if you're a chef. After all the lip service 
New York's best cooks have given to seasonal cooking, some have decided 
that they will cook seasonally, all right, but they will be the ones 
to choose exactly which season. Just take a look at what's on the 
menu this week: A ``winter vegetable plate'' at L'Absinthe on the 
Upper East Side. A ``terrine of spring vegetables and goat cheese'' 
at Provence in SoHo. A ``Long Island summer corn chowder'' at One3, 
in Greenwich Village. And on the fall menu at Patroon in midtown, 
``a spring asparagus soup served chilled with fresh crab.'' Asked 
about that spring asparagus, the chef, Geoffrey Zakarian, said the 
menu listing referred to a variety he gets from upstate New York. 
``I like the name,'' he said. ``It sounds wonderful.'' But as it turns 
out, ``spring'' is not a variety of asparagus. And this time of year, 
Zakarian buys asparagus shipped from South America. At Provence, Liz 
Arana, the chef, puts eggplant, zucchini, yellow squash, tomato, red 
and yellow peppers and asparagus in the vegetable terrine printaniere 
(which means ``springlike''). It is on the lunch menu just now, and 
she says she keeps the terrine pretty much the same year round. ``These 
vegetables are always in season _ zucchini and squash,'' she said. 
It's true, of course. They are always in season _ somewhere.
