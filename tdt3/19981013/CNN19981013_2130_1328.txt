The San Diego chargers have fired Kevin gilbride as head coach and 
replaced him on an interim basis with former falcons head man Jim 
Jones. We're all going to struggle with the young quarterback. We 
knew that going into the season. It goes beyond that when you look 
at the big picture. Like I say, I think we felt that we just aren't 
making the progress that we had expected.
