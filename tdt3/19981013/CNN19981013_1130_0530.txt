A Georgia woman says today will be the last time she relays messages 
from the virgin Mary to the public. Thousands of believers are streaming 
into Nancy fowler's farm in Conyers, Georgia, to hear what she has 
to say. Martin Savidge joins us live from Conyers with more. Martin? 
How is the turnout there? Catherine, the turnout is acity councilling 
for the number of people that have some from all over the world, numbers 
are hard to speculate on. Tens of thousands of people. They project 
well over 1 thoun99 thoun -- 100,000 people before the day is out. 
To see and hear a miracle witnessing a message coming through Nancy 
fowler from the virgin Mary. It is supposed to be the last message 
delivered to this site. This is a place that Nancy fowler has been 
delivering messages from for about eight years T last message brought 
so many faithful to this very place. Already, we're being told that 
Nancy fowler has arrived here. She is in the apparition house, actually 
her farmhouse. She goes into a state of meditation here before addressing 
the crowd. Charles herrera is here from El Paso, Texas. People here 
are saying they are seeing signs of a miracle. Tell us what you've 
seen. I had taken a picture of the sun and in the process, the image 
of the blessed mother was over here to the, it would be my left of 
the picture right here. Again, another picture was taken and she seems 
to be right over my head. Why that is, I have no idea. But there are 
two pictures taken within a minute apart. What do you think of all 
of this? What do you expect to walk away with? I just hope to find 
out what Jesus wants me to do for him. That's it. And if I could find 
that out, what better thing to know than what God wants you to do? 
Charles her rare A, thank you for joining us and showing us the pictures 
as well. People here gathering to hear a message and perhaps take 
part in a miracle. Many already feel that that miracle was taken place, 
is that so many people can gather so peacefully for one cause. Thank 
you, Martin Savidge reported from Conyers, Georgia.
