Merrill Lynch &AMP; Co., the first big American financial firm to 
announce cutbacks in response to the world's troubled financial markets, 
said Tuesday that it would eliminate about 3,400 jobs, or just more 
than 5 percent of its work force. Other Wall Street firms, which along 
with Merrill had swelled their ranks on the fat profits of the rampant 
bull market, are expected to follow suit. Merrill said it expected 
``a much more challenging environment ahead'' for financial companies. 
The job cuts, which the firm said would save $500 million a year, 
are expected to fall heavily on New York City, where Merrill said 
it would dismiss up to 700 of its 10,500 employees. Altogether in 
New York, New Jersey and Connecticut, the firm said it would lay off 
1,100 employees and 500 full-time consultants and eliminate 400 more 
jobs through attrition. As many as 800 of the total cuts will be made 
through attrition. But jobs will be lost across the company, Merrill 
executives said, with 2,000 coming in the United States and 1,400 
coming overseas. In Europe, for example, the company plans to eliminate 
400 jobs. Merrill also said it would fire 900 full-time consultants, 
who are mostly involved in technology projects, although David H. 
Komansky, Merrill's chairman and chief executive, insisted in an interview 
Tuesday that this would not hamper the company's ability to deal with 
either Europe's coming introduction of the euro or computer problems 
associated with the year 2000. Merrill, like many financial firms, 
retains many full-time consultants, particularly for technology projects, 
who are not company employees. Merrill, the nation's largest brokerage 
firm, also reported a loss of $164 million, or 49 cents a share, for 
the three months that ended on Sept. 30 after taking a $430 million 
charge, or $288 million after taxes, to pay for the job cuts. Excluding 
that charge, Merrill showed a profit of $124 million for the quarter 
as earnings were squeezed by the slowdown in underwriting and securities 
trading and the fallout from worldwide economic turmoil. In the third 
quarter of 1997, a much rosier time for securities firms, Merrill 
earned $502 million. This year's third quarter represented Merrill's 
first quarterly loss since the fourth quarter of 1989, when the firm 
was in the midst of cutting 9,000 people, or 18 percent of its work 
force, over roughly two years. Mayor Rudolph Giuliani expressed dismay 
in an interview Tuesday about the layoffs at Merrill, which he said 
was the largest employer in the city. But he was sympathetic about 
the cutbacks, saying: ``This is not something they're doing because 
they want to do it. This is something they're doing because they have 
problems on Wall Street right now.'' The city is better able to withstand 
a downturn on Wall Street than it was in the past, the mayor said, 
adding that he has expected the downturn for years. But the mayor 
acknowledged that the layoffs were bad news for the city's financial 
and emotional health. ``Wall Street has also a psychological impact 
on the city of New York because people who aren't directly affected 
by it make decisions about how much they're going to spend, when they're 
going to spend it, based on what's happening on Wall Street,'' he 
said. Last year, Merrill Lynch received $28 million in tax incentives 
from the city and state in return for agreeing to add 2,000 employees 
over 15 years to the 9,000 it had at the time. Even after the current 
round of layoffs, Merrill will have 9,800 employees in the city, the 
company said in a statement, ``and we are fully confident that our 
strategy for long-term growth in all of our businesses will enable 
us to meet our employment commitment.'' Merrill's job cuts and its 
forecast of tougher times to come Tuesday cast a shadow over Wall 
Street, which until July had enjoyed its most profitable years in 
living memory. ``Those of us in the equity business say there but 
for the grace of God go we,'' said Sallie Krawcheck, an analyst at 
Sanford Bernstein &AMP; Co., a New York securities firm. But she added, 
``If Merrill is right, there will be more layoffs and more poor quarters 
for the industry,'' which is one of New York's biggest employers, 
and certainly its richest business. The job cuts at Merrill, which 
are expected to fall heavily on bond specialists, were widely expected 
after Japan's economic problems deepened and Russia abrogated its 
debts in mid-August, casting a pall over the world's bond and credit 
markets. The company in recent weeks would say only that it was ``reviewing 
the matter'' of job cuts, but there had been media reports that the 
cutbacks would range from more than 1,000 to as many as 3,000 jobs 
and would be concentrated in the bond and emerging-markets divisions. 
Along with recently announced job cuts at the new Citigroup _ the 
combination of Travelers Group and Citicorp _ and others now being 
considered at several other financial companies, the cuts at Merrill 
are likely to affect the New York economy, particularly local consumer 
spending and the real estate market. The cuts at Citigroup, however, 
are in part related to the recent merger, although they also included 
a significant scaling back of the riskier bond businesses at Salomon 
Smith Barney, Citigroup's investment bank. Merrill's financial results 
also seemed to disappoint analysts Tuesday. ``This is clearly not 
being viewed as a one-quarter problem,'' said Charles Hill, director 
of research at First Call, a research firm in Boston. ``This came 
in way below expectations for the quarter, and analysts are cutting 
their estimates for the coming year.'' Richard Strauss, an analyst 
at Goldman, Sachs &AMP; Co., said, ``We were all expecting the revenues 
to be weak, but the expenses were just very high across the board. 
``This is partly the result of an aggressive expansion policy the 
year before the downturn in the securities markets,'' he added, referring 
to Merrill's rapid growth in recent months. Nevertheless, Merrill's 
stock price rose $1.0625 Tuesday, to $44.9375, but is still well below 
its high of nearly $110 in July. Komansky defended Merrill's rapid 
expansion of recent years, and particularly its adventurous acquisitions 
here and abroad. ``Many of them were transforming the nature of this 
firm,'' he said, and ``fit in with our global strategy.'' Two other 
big brokerage firms _ Paine Webber Group and Donaldson, Lufkin &AMP; 
Jenrette Inc. _ also reported lower earnings Tuesday as they, too, 
suffered from the slower securities markets. At Paine Webber, which 
has a large nationwide brokerage business, earnings fell to $82.9 
million, or 51 cents a share, from $112.8 million in the quarter a 
year earlier, just beating a consensus of analysts' estimates. Donaldson, 
Lufkin reported earnings of $25.7 million, or 15 cents a share, for 
the quarter, down almost 80 percent from the quarter a year earlier. 
``It's a bond market, credit crash round the world,'' said Donald 
Marron, chairman and chief executive of Paine Webber, in an interview 
Tuesday about the difficulties in financial markets. His firm, which 
has much smaller international and capital markets businesses than 
Merrill, is not scaling back, he said, but he expressed concern that 
the international economy _ and particularly Japan and Brazil _ might 
adversely effect the U.S. economy. The Merrill cuts are likely to 
be followed by other firms in the coming weeks. ``Notifications started 
going out today,'' Jonathan Humphreys, a Merrill spokesman, said Tuesday, 
showing that the firm is going ahead rapidly with its layoffs. Komansky 
said he hoped that there would not be further job cuts down the road. 
``We have tried to rescale the business to suit what we think the 
environment will look like,'' he said. Some Merrill employees were 
angry that the firm is making such deep job cuts so soon after it 
put up $300 million to help rescue Long-Term Capital Management LP, 
the hedge fund in Greenwich, Conn. A deferred compensation plan for 
Merrill's top executives, including Komansky, has money invested in 
the fund. ``I can understand people who are being downsized and laid 
off feeling that kind of thing,'' Komansky said. ``It's something 
I feel terrible about. It's not something that's easy, but it's about 
managing your cost base to maintain profitability.'' At the World 
Financial Center in downtown Manhattan, where Merrill Lynch has its 
headquarters, employees seemed glum but resigned about the announcement 
of job cuts. ``It's just the normal ups and downs of the market,'' 
said one worker, who would not give his name. ``Sometimes these things 
happen, you know?''
