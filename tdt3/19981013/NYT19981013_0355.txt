Members of the Clinton administration and congressional Republican 
leaders met Tuesday to hammer out the final details of compromise 
legislation that would provide the International Monetary Fund with 
$18 billion in exchange for new restrictions on its loans to foreign 
governments. Congressional officials said that the deal, part of an 
overall budget agreement between the administration and Capitol Hill 
expected to be announced this week, would require the monetary fund 
to stop making many of its loans at below-market interest rates and 
compel borrowers to repay the loans within two and a half years. The 
fund currently makes most of its loans at below-market rates of about 
4.5 percent a year, with pay-back periods of about 10 years. Under 
the compromise, congressional officials said, the fund would also 
be required to publish summaries of its board meetings, ending years 
of secrecy over the fund's loan deliberations. Before meeting Tuesday 
with Treasury Secretary Robert Rubin, House Republican leader Dick 
Armey of Texas said that an agreement over IMF financing was so close 
that ``we're down to splitting infinitives.'' White House spokesman 
Joe Lockhart said that ``we've certainly made significant progress'' 
and ``we seem to have rounded the corner on the question of funding.'' 
The new lending conditions had been demanded by House Republicans, 
who for months have blocked approval of the full $18 billion requested 
by the Clinton administration to allow the fund to deal with the global 
financial crisis. The Republicans have accused the fund of overly 
generous lending practices that encouraged some foreign governments, 
including those that requested bailouts over the last year, to adopt 
reckless economic policies. Administration officials said that while 
some details of the agreement were still under negotiation, they believed 
the final plan would not put onerous restrictions on the fund as it 
attempts to avert an international financial meltdown. The $18 billion 
would be used to replenish accounts that were depleted by the fund's 
efforts to bail out the economies of Russia and three Asia nations. 
Administration officials had contacted other key donor nations to 
the fund, including Japan, Germany and Britain, to determine whether 
any would attempt to block the lending restrictions that would be 
demanded of the fund under the legislation. While the United States 
is the largest and most influential donor to the fund, it cannot dictate 
policy to the 182-nation organization without the support of other 
large donor nations. ``I don't think we have a problem with our allies 
on this,'' said an administration official who is involved in the 
negotiations with Congress. ``I think these reforms at the IMF will 
have widespread support.'' Under the agreement, congressional officials 
said, the Treasury Department would be required to certify to Congress 
that the United States and other large donor nations are bringing 
pressure on the fund to limit its loans to nations that agree to open 
up their trade policies. Republican leaders in Congress have asserted 
that bailout money from the fund has been used by some foreign governments 
to subsidize failing industries, creating unfair competition for struggling 
industries in the United States. Rep. Jim Saxton, R-N.J., who is chairman 
of the House-Senate Joint Economic Committee and a leading critic 
of the fund, said that he was disappointed that the lending conditions 
being put on the fund were not tougher. But he said he was pleased 
that the fund's activities were under such intense scrutiny on Capitol 
Hill. ``We have begun a very serious discussion of this institution,'' 
he said, predicting that the next Congress would demand stricter reforms 
of the fund.
