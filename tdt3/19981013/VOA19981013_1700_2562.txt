Another long-running dispute which has stymied diplomats is Cyprus, 
where violence erupted between the island's Greek and Turkish communities 
shortly after it gained independence from Britain in 1960. John McDonald, 
a 40-year career diplomat with the U.S. State Department, is now chairman 
of the Institute for Multi-Track Diplomacy in Washington. He says 
dialogue has begun between Greek and Turkish members of the Cyprus 
parliament, and some citizens are, for the first time, crossing the 
infamous green line. But he agrees it will take a lot more contact 
to erase more than 30 years of hatred. For this reason, nongovernmental 
organizations like Mr. McDonald's are trying to get involved in a 
conflict in its earliest days to get dialogue going before hatred 
and fear of the other sets in. I'm talking about focusing on a hate, 
a fear, the lies, the trauma that these people have suffered. I'm 
talking about the ability to get them to realize that the enemy who 
was their neighbor can still be their neighbor again if they can learn 
some of those skills that we're talking about and learn how to work 
and to live together. No matter where they're from, fear is at the 
heart of what we're talking about. And the irony is that many times, 
one sides doesn't realize that the other side is afraid of them. And 
when they realize that everybody is afraid of everybody else, then 
they realize also that something has got to change. John McDonald 
says the Dayton accord, which ended the fighting in Bosnia, also set 
the stage for creating civil institutions and holding elections. Other 
conflict resolution specialists agree with Mr. McDonald and some, 
like Yanish Bugayski, go further, saying Bosnians have already made 
amazing progress -- resuming relationships with neighbors who only 
three years ago were at each other's throats. I'm Pamela Taylor.
