Money apparently was the motive for another kind of business we're 
hearing about from the FBI tonight, the business of spying. Even with 
the cold war over, there's still a Russian market for American military 
secrets. And a former U.S. army enlisted man with access to those 
secrets is charged with selling them. NBC's Pete Williams. The FBI 
says the trouble started when a U.S. army enlisted man, supporting 
his estranged wife and strapped for cash, walked into the Soviet embassy 
in Washington and bluntly offered to sell secrets for money. In a 
federal courtroom today, David sheldon Boone heard prosecutors accuse 
him of selling top secret documents to the Soviet Union from 1988 
to 1991. Investigators say he bragged to the Soviets of having worked 
at the supersecret national security agency, analyzing information 
from spy satellites. The FBI says he continued his spying when he 
was assigned to code breaking duty at a U.S. military base in augsburg, 
Germany, meeting a Soviet handler named "Igor" at spots along Germany's 
rhine river, handing over his secrets and collecting his cash, $60,000 
total during three years of spying. Court documents say he gave the 
Soviets documents that described the targeting of U.S. nuclear weapons 
against Soviet targets and a handbook of U.S. spy reconnaissance and 
collection programs. Intelligence experts say they're among the most 
sensitive of all military secrets. He says this would have been at 
the top of any foreign spy's wish list. Who we spy on, and how we 
get the information out to the field, critical secrets to our intelligence 
system. Federal agents tell NBC news Boone was on a list of U.S. spies 
handed over after the collapse of the Soviet Union. The FBI says he 
was arrested over the weekend at a Washington airport hotel, after 
describing his past spying to an undercover agent who posed as a Soviet 
spy. While the government assesses the damage, some wonder why Boone 
was left in a sensitive job when he had such glaring financial problems.
