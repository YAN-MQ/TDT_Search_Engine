one factor behind monday's market rally was a much stronger than expected 
earnings report from chrysler. peter viles reports. chrysler is the 
most all-american of the big three, and this summer, that proved a 
big advantage with minimal overseas exposure, and general motors hampered 
by a strike, chrysler had its best summer ever. a record $15 billion 
in revenue, $682 million in profits and, this bonus for market confidence 
-- a statement of faith in what some see as a shaky united states 
economy. we're still fairly optimistic. with consumer attitudes fairly 
good, with consumer income going up, with interest rates going down, 
disposable incomes on the rise, still, we still see the conditions 
in the u.s. for auto industry sales to be quite good through the fourth 
quarter and for most of next year. the company pointed to strong sales 
of its high-profit dodge durango and jeep cherokee and a product line 
so popular that chrysler's cost of selling a vehicle is running $400 
below gm's. chrysler was also helped by its lack of global ambition 
-- 92% of its revenues come from the united states. they did exceptionally 
well this quarter because of their lack, certainly of brazilian exposure, 
lack of asian exposure, and, to a lesser extent, they're not very 
big in europe either. so the u.s. economy for this quarter is probably 
the strongest place on earth. and they're very concentrated there. 
as expected, chrysler gained partly at the expense of strike-bound 
general motors. chrysler estimates its u.s. market share is up nearly 
a percentage point over last year's levels, to 15.7%. this is likely 
to be chrysler's final earnings report as an independent company. 
its merger with daimler-benz closes next month. which means the 73-year-old 
company which barely survived the 1970s, may have saved its best for 
last. peter viles, "cnn financial news," new york.
