President Clinton on Tuesday demanded serious progress toward compliance 
with the Kosovo accord from Yugoslav President Slobodan Milosevic 
within the next four days to avoid air strikes. Meanwhile, senior 
American officials insisted that they had used NATO successfully to 
avert a human disaster, do justice to the ethnic Albanians of Kosovo 
and increase their ability to control their lives. Still, while the 
details of the agreements reached by Milosevic and the American special 
envoy Richard Holbrooke were kept vague, there were serious doubts 
expressed that the Clinton administration had pushed Milosevic hard 
enough on the issue of real autonomy for Kosovo to create a durable 
settlement. Morton Abramowitz, a former State Department official 
deeply involved in the Kosovo issue, said: ``The durability of the 
agreements depends on what the Kosovo Albanians got politically after 
seven months of destruction. If they got less than the pre-1989 autonomy 
they had and the administration promised, then I'm afraid we're in 
for long-term trouble.'' Clinton, in comments on Tuesday morning, 
said: ``We will not rely on what President Milosevic says, but what 
he does for the whole world to see,'' through the agreement to put 
2,000 unarmed, civilian observers in Kosovo. Their task, while NATO 
aircraft fly overhead, is to verify Yugoslav compliance with a U.N. 
resolution calling for Milosevic to reduce the number of troops and 
special police in Kosovo and confine them to barracks, to allow aid 
to reach up to 300,000 refugees and to hold serious talks with the 
ethnic Albanian majority in Kosovo for a political settlement. Clinton's 
national security adviser, Sandy Berger, said that NATO would insist 
that Milosevic make ``serious progress'' toward complying with all 
his commitments before NATO's 96-hour ultimatum expires. Otherwise, 
he said, NATO would proceed to bomb Yugoslav army and police positions 
in Kosovo. ``The ultimate enforcer here is NATO air power,'' Berger 
said, while Clinton praised NATO and its willingness to use force 
as a key factor in pushing Milosevic toward agreement. Holbrooke, 
in an interview from his airplane returning to the United States, 
said that Milosevic's agreement to let 2,000 foreigners under the 
Organization for Security and Cooperation in Europe verify his compliance 
in Kosovo while NATO does so in the air were breakthroughs, given 
Milosevic's previous refusal to let foreigners into Kosovo or the 
OSCE work there. ``To have all those people on the ground is very 
important to the ethnic Albanians,'' Holbrooke said. He noted that 
their elected leader, Ibrahim Rugova, ``said he wanted the largest 
possible number of foreigners on the ground.'' More details of the 
agreement emerged on Tuesday _ including a commitment from Milosevic 
to finish the details of the verification procedures by next Monday, 
to complete ``the main elements'' of a political autonomy agreement 
with the ethnic Albanians by Nov. 2 and to hold free elections in 
the province within nine months. James Rubin, the State Department 
spokesman, emphasized that Milosevic had made concessions toward local 
control of police and village and provincial government in Kosovo 
that ``will vastly improve the lives of many people.'' If the American 
mediation works, by Nov. 2, Milosevic will have agreed ``to more autonomy 
for Kosovo than he has for the last 10 years,'' Rubin said. But analysts 
of the region raised questions, based on what has been made public, 
about how much autonomy the Kosovars will actually get. Ivo Daalder 
of the Brookings Institution, a former National Security Council official 
dealing with Bosnia, said the West ``is pretty much kicking the can 
down the road in Kosovo,'' solving the immediate human crisis but 
not resolving the fundamental issue of Kosovo's status. ``Milosevic's 
unilateral offer falls short of the U.S. proposal, which itself falls 
short of anything any self-respecting Kosovo politician, let alone 
a Kosovar with a gun, is willing to accept,'' Daalder said. But Holbrooke 
said that Milosevic's position was a starting point and that the Americans 
have not tried to impose a political solution on the ethnic Albanians. 
``This is an emergency inside a crisis,'' Holbrooke said. ``As for 
the emergency _ the military confrontation that brought us to the 
brink of NATO action _ we can see the path to its resolution, if Milosevic 
doesn't backslide. But the crisis is Kosovo, and there has been no 
change in the political issues that caused the tragedy, the rampaging 
and the pillaging this summer.''
