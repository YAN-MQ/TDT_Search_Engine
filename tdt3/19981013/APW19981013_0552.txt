Argentine President Carlos Menem arrived in Paris Tuesday for a four-day 
visit aimed at boosting investment on the strength of his country's 
economic turnaround. Menem arrived mid-afternoon, accompanied by a 
60-strong delegation, including Foreign Minister Guido di Tella and 
Defense Minister Jorge Dominguez. In an interview published Tuesday 
by French daily Le Figaro, Menem criticized European Union subsidies 
for farmers, saying such practices run contrary to the spirit of the 
free market. ``In Argentina, we feel that our partners don't practice 
what they preach, and that's painful,'' Menem was quoted as saying 
in an interview published Tuesday by French daily Le Figaro. ``The 
market economy must be transparent and lucid,'' Menem added. ``Argentina 
in no way protects its agricultural production.'' Under Menem's leadership, 
Argentina's economy has been transformed over the last decade. Free 
market policies slashed hyperinflation and fueled unprecedented growth. 
The country is now a bullish exporter of commodities. Argentina is 
a member of the Cairns group _ a free trade lobby organization pressing 
for an end to farm tariffs and non-tariff barriers to agricultural 
trade throughout the world. France is the third biggest foreign investor 
in Argentina, after the United States and Spain, with interests in 
the car, water, telecommunications, food and energy sectors. Between 
1990 and 1996, it invested dlrs 4.6 billion in Argentina. But Menem, 
68, said there were many more opportunities for French and European 
businessmen. It was his fifth trip to France since taking office for 
a first term in 1989. ``We will tell the French _ and then the rest 
of the European Union _ about our transformation, and invite people 
to invest,'' Menem said. ``Our country is credible and trustworthy, 
and its institutions, economy and finances are solid.'' Menem will 
meet with French President Jacques Chirac on Wednesday and Prime Minister 
Lionel Jospin on Thursday. After leaving France, he heads to Portugal 
for the Oct. 17-18 Ibero-American Summit.
