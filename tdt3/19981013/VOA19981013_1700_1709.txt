Elsewhere, an American adventurer says he has seen a yeti, the abominable 
snowman of Himalayan legend. Craig Kalonika said that he saw two creatures 
with thick, shiny black fur walking together last month during a high-altitude 
skiing expedition on China's side of Mount Everest. Mr. Kalonika told 
reporters what he saw was not human. He said the creatures were walking 
erect like people, except a little hunched over in the shoulder. But 
last week in Germany, Reinhold Nessner, the first man to climb the 
-- all 14 of the world's peaks taller than 8,000 meters announced 
the yeti was just a large bear. Well, no matter what he says, I think 
I'll keep my distance anyway.
