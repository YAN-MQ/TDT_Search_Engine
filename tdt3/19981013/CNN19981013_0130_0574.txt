eight cases before the supreme court tuesday could determine how local 
phone companies compete for your business. charles bierbauer explains. 
in kalona, iowa, the phone company is very local. the co-op has just 
under 2,000 lines and only 10 employees. it's seen the party line 
and the pastel phones, but it's not out of date. isdn's services your 
high-speed digital circuits -- internet. there's not much that we 
can't deliver that the customer would want or have a need of. general 
manager ray marner wonders if he'll be able to do that cheaply and 
efficiently after the supreme court rules on the 1996 telecommunications 
act, which was designed to end local phone monopolies. the principal 
hope will be that you will have the same kinds of options for your 
local phone service and same kind of competition in price and variability 
of options and quality in local phone service that you now have in 
long distance. at issue is whether congress really meant to give the 
federal communications commission the job of setting fees for access 
to the $100 billion local phone business. state officials here in 
iowa are not opposed to competition, but contend that they just may 
know better than the federal government how to regulate phone companies 
to meet local needs. we have set those rates, we know the structure 
of those rates, we know our communities, we know where the subsidies 
are. iowa has 158 small independent phone companies like kalona's. 
but this is not big guys versus little guys. most u.s. local phone 
service is provided by the baby bells and those babies are big. so, 
too, are some would-be competitors. in tiny kalona, the 90-year-old 
phone co-op may be too small to be threatened yet. service to scattered 
rural phone customers could still be guaranteed by the states. but 
across the country, customers can only hope competition will really 
deliver cheaper, better phone service. but they can be sure choosing 
their local phone company will get more complicated. charles bierbauer, 
cnn, kalona, iowa.
