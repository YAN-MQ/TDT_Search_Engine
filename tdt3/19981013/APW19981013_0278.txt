The wife of arrested Malaysian dissident leader Anwar Ibrahim says 
she wants to learn from the Philippines' struggle against the late 
dictator Ferdinand Marcos to push the democratic reform movement in 
her country. In a recent letter to former Philippine President Corazon 
Aquino, Azizah Ismail said she would continue her husband's peaceful 
struggle for political reforms in Malaysia. ``I would be most grateful 
if you can further share with me your wealth of experience gained 
during the period of the oppressive Marcos regime,'' Azizah said in 
her Oct. 7 letter. A copy was obtained by The Associated Press Tuesday. 
``It will be most valuable in assisting me to find the strength and 
resilience to face the undemocratic onslaught of the current regime 
in my country,'' Azizah said, adding she wanted to personally meet 
Mrs. Aquino. Azizah was responding to a letter Mrs. Aquino sent her 
earlier by fax in which the former Philippine leader narrated her 
ordeal when her husband, the late Sen. Benigno Aquino, the chief political 
rival of Marcos, was arrested, jailed and then murdered upon returning 
from U.S. exile in 1983. The assassination of Mrs. Aquino's husband 
at Manila's international airport triggered massive protests that 
culminated in the ``people power'' revolt that toppled Marcos in 1986 
and installed Mrs. Aquino as president. Malaysian Prime Minister Mahathir 
Mohamad fired Anwar as his deputy on Sept. 2 after the two differed 
on economic policy, although Mahathir said moral issues led to the 
dismissal. Anwar then began speaking out against Mahathir, and was 
arrested Sept. 20 on charges of corruption and sexual misconduct. 
Thousands of Anwar's supporters have held protest demonstrations in 
recent days, demanding his release. In her letter, Aquino praised 
Azizah's courage. ``By your example, I'm sure that there will be many 
more who will join you as you carry on with Anwar's commitment for 
reforms,'' Mrs. Aquino wrote. Mrs. Aquino urged Azizah to continue 
inspiring the Malaysian people ``so that more and more of them will 
join you and Anwar in your quest for political and economic reforms.'' 
Philippine President Joseph Estrada and Indonesian President B.J. 
Habibie have also spoken out against Anwar's treatment. Estrada has 
said he was considering skipping a summit of Asia-Pacific leaders 
in Malaysia in November because of the arrest of Anwar, whom he described 
as a personal friend. The Philippines, Indonesia and Malaysia are 
among the founding members of the Association of Southeast Asian Nations, 
which also includes Brunei, Laos, Myanmar, Singapore, Thailand and 
Vietnam.
