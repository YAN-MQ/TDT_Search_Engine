The Hyundai business group sent 83 construction workers and equipment 
to North Korea Tuesday to build port facilities for its proposed sightseeing 
tours. A ship carrying the workers left South Korea's Donghae port 
for Changjon, a port on North Korea's east coast. Eight barges loaded 
with construction equipment followed. The workers and 350 others to 
follow in the next month will build berthing facilities at Changjon 
to be used by Hyundai ships carrying tourists to nearby Diamond Mountain. 
The workers also will build rest centers, restaurants and other tourism-related 
facilities on and around the mountain, a major tourist attraction. 
Hyundai's founder and honorary chairman Chung Ju-yung visited his 
native North Korea in June with a gift of 500 cattle and agreed to 
start sightseeing tours of the mountain as a joint venture. Hyundai, 
South Korea's largest conglomerate, hopes to send up to 2,000 tourists 
a week on two luxury cruise ships for tours of the mountain, starting 
later this month. Meanwhile, North Korea said in a letter to Hyundai 
Tuesday that it would consider accepting a Seoul government proposal 
to launch a joint investigation of the deaths of 71 cattle donated 
by Hyundai. The North earlier accused the Seoul government of plotting 
to kill the cattle by feeding them indigestible vinyl strips and lumps 
of hemp rope before shipping them to the North. South Korea rejected 
the accusation and suggested that veterinarians and officials of North 
and South Korea jointly investigate the deaths.
