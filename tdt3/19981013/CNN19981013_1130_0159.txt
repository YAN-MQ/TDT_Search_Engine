White House and congressional bargainers are meeting today, trying 
to hammer out a federal budget deal. President Clinton yesterday signed 
a third stopgap spending measure to keep the government from running 
out of money. It expires at midnight tomorrow. Congressional republicans 
hope to beat the new deadline by passing an omnibus spending Bill. 
But administration officials say there are still disagreements over 
education, the environment and other issues.
