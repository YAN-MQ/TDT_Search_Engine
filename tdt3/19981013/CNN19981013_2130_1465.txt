The actress who plays Ally McBeal needs a good lawyer. Calista Flockhart 
is being sued by a New York law firm. It says it negotiated her deal 
to star in the fox sitcom and hasn't gotten paid for it. Lawyers say 
Flockhart owes them 5% of everything she earns on the show. They figure 
she has earned at least $780,000 so far, making their cut at least 
$39,000.
