President Clinton predicts the international monitors converging on 
Kosovo will supply NATO with the facts needed to decide whether military 
force can be avoided. But Mr. Clinton noted the next move is up to 
Yugoslavia. We will not rely on what President Milosevic says, but 
on what he does for the whole world to see. President Clinton said 
he still hopes for a diplomatic solution. The international community 
prefers compliance to conflict. The announcement on the agreement 
in Kosovo came earlier in the day in Belgrade, where VOA correspondent 
Art Chimes reports the crisis may not yet be over. The Holbrooke announcement 
came after a final meeting with Yugoslav president Slobodan Milosevic. 
Earlier, NATO agreed to authorize military action unless Yugoslavia 
agreed to comply with United Nations demands on Serbia's rebellious 
Kosovo province. Mr. Milosevic agreed to international verification 
of the demands, which include withdrawal of forces from Kosovo and 
access by humanitarian organizations to tens of thousands of displaced 
persons who are living out in the open. The deal includes various 
measures to ensure Yugoslavia complies, including overflights by reconnaissance 
aircraft and unarmed monitors on the ground. The agreement appears 
to provide a short-term resolution to the Kosovo crisis. But ethnic 
Albanians have reservations about the agreement, which would defer 
their dream of full independence. Art Chimes, VOA News, Belgrade. 
Late Tuesday, the Serbian government announced that elections will 
be held in Kosovo in 1999. This would be one of the conditions of 
the agreement.
