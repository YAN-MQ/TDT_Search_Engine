Many of our local FM and medium-wave affiliates are about to take 
a two-minute break. This is VOA News Now. It's coming up on 2200 Universal 
Time. That means we're saying good night to most of our listeners 
in the Middle East and North Africa. Thanks for being with us, and 
please tune in again tomorrow, beginning at 0400 Universal Time, when 
VOA News Now resumes on 7.17, 11.965 and 15.205 MHz short wave. If 
you're listening in the Persian Gulf area right now, we invite you 
to stay with us for another couple of hours on medium wave at 1548 
KHz. And if you're listening in the eastern Mediterranean, we will 
be back on the air with VOA News Now 30 minutes from now on 1260 KHz 
medium wave. Here's a frequency change if you're listening in Africa. 
We are now going off 15.41, 15.445, 15.58 and 17.725 MHz short wave. 
We invite you to retune to 7.34 MHz or any of our other remaining 
frequencies. For listeners in Europe...
