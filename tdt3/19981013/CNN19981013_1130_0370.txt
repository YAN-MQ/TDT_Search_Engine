The American medical community is urging patients to tell their doctors 
what dietary supplements they are taking. Some herbal medicines can 
interact with prescription drugs. Germany is supplying much of the 
data on herb/drug interactions to U.S. doctors in two new handbooks.

for their active ingredients to try and ensure uniform potency.
