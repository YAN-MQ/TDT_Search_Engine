Italy's stock market regulators said Tuesday they had filed a complaint 
against Telecom Italia SpA over a recent incident in which Telecom 
released, denied and then confirmed company financial projections. 
Telecom executives met Tuesday to discuss what action to take over 
the incident, Italy's AGI news agency reported. The telecommunications 
company recently gave labor unions a three-year plan containing its 
financial forecasts. When a news agency published the figures, Telecom 
initially refuted them, then confirmed them. The incident brought 
down Telecom share prices and triggered an internal investigation 
and speculation of a shakeup at top levels. Italy's stock market regulatory 
commission said Telecom has four weeks to explain. If it isn't satisfied, 
the government could then impose of a fine of up to about dlrs 120,000, 
the commission said.
