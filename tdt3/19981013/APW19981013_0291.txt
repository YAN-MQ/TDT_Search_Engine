Three scientists working in the United States won the Nobel Prize 
in physics Tuesday for their discoveries of how sub-atomic particles 
can behave like a fluid. Robert C. Laughlin of the United States, 
Horst L. Stoermer of Germany and Daniel C. Tsui, a native of China 
who is now an American citizen, will share the dlrs 978,000 prize. 
They discovered that electrons acting together in strong magnetic 
fields can form new types of particles, the Royal Swedish Academy 
of Sciences said. Laughlin works at Stanford University, Stoermer 
(pronounced STER-mer) currently is at Columbia University in New York 
City and Tsui (TSOO-ee) teaches at Princeton University. The award 
recognizes work that Tsui and Stoermer did together in the 1980s, 
which was elaborated on by Laughlin. According to the citation, the 
three discovered a new form of ``quantum fluid,'' which are fluids 
such as liquid helium that have certain properties in common such 
as superfluidity. What makes these fluids important for researchers 
is that ``events in a drop of quantum fluid can afford more profound 
insights into the general inner structure and dynamics of matter,'' 
the academy said. It is ``yet another breakthrough in our understanding 
of quantum physics and to the development of new theoretical concepts 
of significance in many branches of modern physics.'' The Nobel, 6th
