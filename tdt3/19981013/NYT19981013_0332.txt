Two days before an Israeli-Palestinian summit meeting near Washington, 
gunmen believed to be Palestinian militants shot and killed an Israeli 
and seriously wounded another Tuesday as they bathed in a hillside 
spring outside Jerusalem. Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, pressed 
by hawkish members of his Cabinet to resist a peace deal, said after 
the ambush that there was ``no chance, at this stage, of signing an 
agreement'' at the U.S.-sponsored talks scheduled to begin Thursday 
at Wye Plantation in Maryland. The tough response seemed to be a nod 
to Netanyahu's rightist political allies who have threatened to bolt 
the governing coalition if he agrees to a further Israeli withdrawal 
in the West Bank. But in practice, Netanyahu went ahead with preparations 
for the summit meeting, speaking for 40 minutes on the phone with 
Secretary of State Madeleine Albright, and announcing plans to go 
to Jordan on Wednesday to brief Crown Prince Hassan on the talks. 
``There has been no change in the prime minister's approach to the 
summit,'' said spokesman David Bar-Illan. Netanyahu's sharp statement 
followed a seven-hour Cabinet meeting in which Ariel Sharon, who formally 
became foreign minister Tuesday, reportedly urged his colleagues to 
limit Netanyahu's room to maneuver at the Maryland talks. But Cabinet 
Secretary Danny Naveh said after the meeting that Netanyahu had won 
``a mandate to reach an agreement with the Palestinians on the condition 
that they fulfill their commitments and that Israel's security requirements 
are satisfied.'' Netanyahu has demanded a crackdown on militant groups 
by the Palestinian Authority in return for a further Israeli withdrawal 
from parts of the West Bank. The United States has proposed an Israeli 
pullout from another 13 percent of the West Bank in exchange for Palestinian 
steps to combat anti-Israeli violence. In a statement issued by his 
spokesman hours after the slaying, Netanyahu said that if the attackers 
had indeed fled to a Palestinian-controlled area of the West Bank, 
as reported by the Israeli police, ``the Palestinian Authority must 
act immediately to apprehend them.'' ``Mr. Netanyahu emphasizes that 
at the Wye Plantation talks he will insist on Israel's security demands 
of the Palestinians,'' the statement continued. ``Without fulfillment 
of all the Palestinian security commitments there will be no agreement, 
and in light of this grim reality there is no chance at this stage 
of signing an agreement.'' Tuesday's attack occurred less than a mile 
from the West Bank, at a spring on an isolated hillside southwest 
of Jerusalem that is frequented by followers of Rabbi Nachman of Bratslav, 
a 19th-century Hasidic mystic who lived in Ukraine. The victims were 
described by acquaintances as newly religious Jews in their 20s who 
had become disciples of Nachman, and who bathed daily in the spring 
as a form of ritual purification. The slain man was identified as 
Itamar Doron of Ora, a community near the spring. His friend, Ilan 
Mazon, from the adjacent community of Aminadav, was wounded. ``We 
always used to pray here, and we got to know them,'' said Aharon Boimel, 
who helped renovate the structure housing the spring. ``After bathing 
they would dance, and they were always happy.''
