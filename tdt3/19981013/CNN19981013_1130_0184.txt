The Supreme Court is hearing arguments this morning over the battle 
to open the $100 billion local phone market to long-distance companies. 
At issue is who will set price guidelines and other rules. The federal 
government and long-distance companies AT&T and MCI will be facing 
off against state regulators and local phone companies. Long-distance 
companies say consumers will be the big winners when the local market 
opens. The principal hope is that you will have the same kind of options 
for your local phone service and same kind of competition in price 
and variability of options and quality in local phone service that 
you now have in long distance. The Supreme Court is expected to issue 
a decision by July.
