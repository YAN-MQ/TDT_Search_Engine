The country's largest brokerage announcing today it's cutting 3,400 
jobs. That's about 5% of its global workforce. 700 jobs will come 
from its New York headquarters alone. The cutbacks are expected to 
save the company $500 million in annual costs. Merrill also reported 
a loss of $164 million in its third quarter. It's the first quarterly 
loss at Merrill Lynch in nearly nine years. Now despite the gloomy 
news, shares of Merrill Lynch gained about 1 point to almost 45, as 
investors felt that the job cuts would help its bottom line.
