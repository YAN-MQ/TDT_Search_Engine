BELGRADE, Yugoslavia (AP) _ U.S. envoy Richard Holbrooke on Tuesday 
described the result of days of talks with Slobodan Milosevic as a 
possible turning point in steps to end the Kosovo crisis, but said 
it depends on the Yugoslav president. Holbrooke made his remarks to 
a news conference just hours after U.S. President Bill Clinton announced 
that the Yugoslav president had promised to adhere to international 
demands. ``I cannot stress too highly how deeply concerned we are 
about what happened in the past few months in Kosovo ... the unnecessary 
horror of it,'' Holbrooke said. ``We hope this will mark a turning 
point in the right direction. But the proof ... is in compliance with 
U.N. resolution 1199 and with actions on the ground in Kosovo, regarding 
the deployment of security forces, the return of refugees to their 
homes, the end of armed violence on all sides, the repairing of the 
damage and in some cases wanton destruction, and the creation most 
importantly of a political process that gives the people of Kosovo 
autonomy and self-determination.'' He said a statement to be made 
by Milosevic's government later in the day would be critical in signifying 
their commitment to settling the crisis. The status of future talks 
was not immediately clear. Holbrooke emphasized that the U.S. delegation 
was not proclaiming the talks a victory, saying ``we're not out of 
the emergency yet.'' ``But if this is the road past the end of the 
emergency, ... then we will feel it was worth coming here, we will 
feel that international solidarity helped end the crisis,'' he said. 
``Let's not call it a triumph ... until something was done that was 
meaningful for the people of Kosovo.'' He indicated that the key was 
Milosevic having allowed a verification force in Kosovo. ``All I can 
say is, what we are talking about here is not words ... but compliance 
on the ground in Kosovo,'' he said.
