Before this day is over, close to 100,000 people will have found themselves 
drawn to a farm hd house in Conyers, Georgia. They went to see a woman 
named Mary fowler who claims to see visions of the virgin Mary. The 
Catholic church has only authenticated a few visions, and those very 
controversial. Fredericka Whitfield on what people were swearing they 
were seeing in Georgia today. Today outside this small farm house 
in Conyers, Georgia, the power of faith where up to 100,000 come to 
hear the message delivered by Nancy fowler. I think it's Jesus working 
through Nancy. The 50-year-old fowler, a homemaker and norme nurse 
says on the 13th day of each month for eight years she's gone into 
her so-called apparition room to receive a vision of the virgin Mary, 
and then pass it on. Pray, children. Pray against the evils of this 
age. Only this time, fowler says it is her last public pronouncement. 
She claims the virgin Mary won't appear to her begin. We will not 
be permitted to see our lady in this way again until we are in heaven. 
Fowler has welcomed the sick, the strong, anyone of faith. It's this 
Alabama woman's 15th visit. This particular day, I looked down and 
the chain in my rosary had turned gold. They are believers, not just 
in God but in fowler. Fowler says she was a typical Catholic mother 
when she began experiencing religious visions. At first, friends, 
and even family thought she was crazy. It's not easy but, you know, 
how can you say no to God? After going public she won followers from 
as far away as Australia. But the Catholic church isn't so sure. You 
begin with skepticism, and the Burden of proof is on the part of the 
parties who would try to convince the church and the world that this 
is authentic. But still, in Conyers, it's not about evidence or proof. 
It's about faith, belief in Nancy fowler, and her visions. It's been 
said fowler has never profited from her visions. She plans to publish 
the visions on the Internet.
