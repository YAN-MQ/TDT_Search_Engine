The championship is still two years off, but already three coaches 
are under pressure as 22 qualifying matches kick off Wednesday in 
Euro 2000. England coach Glenn Hoddle plus new Spanish and German 
bosses _ Jose Antonio Camacho and Erich Ribbeck _ will be watched 
closely in games in Luxembourg, Israel and Moldova. Just four days 
after an embarrassing scoreless tie with Bulgaria at Wembley, Hoddle 
must win. Fortunately for him, almost nobody ever loses to Luxembourg. 
Ribbeck, stunned in his debut Saturday when the '96 champions lost 
1-0 in Turkey, faces a weak opponent in Moldova but expectations are 
always high in Germany. And that also goes for Spain, where Camacho 
takes over for Javier Clemente, who resigned after a 3-2 loss in Cyprus 
last month _ and that came on the heels of a miserable World Cup. 
In other key matches Wednesday, some will focus on Turkey vs. Finland, 
with Turkey atop Group 3, and Croatia vs. Macedonia. Croatia, World 
Cup semifinalists, will be attempting to unseat Macedonia from the 
No. 1 spot in Group 8. While Luxembourg authorities brace for an onslaught 
of often-troublesome English fans, Hoddle is trying to survive. ``We 
have let ourselves down over these last two matches against Sweden 
(2-1 loss) and Bulgaria, but we have got to address that _ and we 
can start by winning tomorrow,'' he said Tuesday. Injuries and the 
team's poor play mean the return of David Beckham for his first international 
since he was red-carded against Argentina, a game England lost to 
exit the World Cup. Spain has been preparing for eight days for its 
match against Israel with the critical Spanish media pinpointing lightly 
regarded Israel _ undefeated in two years at home _ as a real threat. 
``This is a like a final for us,'' forward Raul Gonzalez said. ``Clemente 
is history.'' Teammate Luis Enrique Martinez was just as straightforward. 
``We have to win so that we can be a little calmer about the future,'' 
Since taking over last month, Camacho has been credited with raising 
team morale. He now faces his first official game after notching up 
a 1-0 victory in a friendly against Russia. In Germany, a draw will 
not be enough at Moldova. ``A victory is our obligation, nothing else 
would satisfy us,'' Ribbeck said ``We have to turn up the pressure, 
we have to win the ball, and I'd like to feel more of a desire to 
win,'' he said. Turkey is striving for its third consecutive victory 
in the qualifiers when it takes on Finland in Istanbul, after defeating 
Northern Ireland 3-0 and scoring a 1-0 win over Germany on Saturday. 
Turkish coach Mustafa Denizli said his team held the advantage after 
Finland's loss to Northern Ireland in Belfast. ``But we are not underestimating 
anything,'' Denizli said. The cross-border rivalry between Hungary 
and Romania will be heightened as Romania aims for its first win over 
its traditional rivals. The two countries have not met since a World 
Cup qualifier in 1981 and, despite Hungary's dominant record of 11 
wins and four draws in 15 head-to-heads, Romania is the new power 
and favored in Budapest over the struggling Hungarians. Hungarian 
coach Bertalan Bicskei is patching together a side in the wake of 
injuries to key players following a 4-0 win over Azerbaijan. Romania 
and Slovakia top Group 7 with six points in two games, while Hungary 
and Portugal have three points from two games. Azerbaijan and Liechtenstein 
have no points. Following a 4-1 victory against Malta over the weekend, 
Croatia is determined to collect all three points against Macedonia. 
The Croats were surprise losers to Ireland in Dublin in their opening 
qualifier but got back on track against Malta. Coach Miroslav Blazevic 
said Macedonia would be a tougher hurdle than Malta. ``They're better, 
faster and uncompromising. Still, I don't believe they'll go home 
undefeated,'' Blazevic said. In another match, France plays its first 
game at home since winning the World Cup when it takes on Andorra 
_ European soccer's newest national team _ in Paris. France, which 
scored a 3-2 win over Russia on Saturday, will take a near full-strength 
team into the match. After a disappointing 1-1 draw in Iceland in 
its opening qualifier, new coach Roger Lemerre's team showed its resolve 
with its first ever win in Moscow.
