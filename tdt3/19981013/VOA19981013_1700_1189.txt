Baseball's New York Yankees and Cleveland Indians return to the field 
in New York in about three hours from now for what Yankee fans hope 
will be the last game of the American League Championship series. 
VOA correspondent Breck Ardery reports from New York. The Yankees 
hold a 3-2 game advantage in the best of seven series, making this 
game a must-win for the Indians. The Yankees are hoping to end the 
series, but New York manager Joe Torre has a lot of respect for Charles 
Nagy, Cleveland's starting pitcher. He beat us the last week of the 
regular season and then came back and duplicated it in the game in 
the championship series. It's not going to be an easy fight. Torre 
has chosen David Cohn to pitch for the Yankees. Cohn, who won 20 games 
during the regular season, says he's glad to have the chance to end 
the league series and send the Yankees into the World Series for the 
35th time. Breck Ardery, VOA News, New York.
