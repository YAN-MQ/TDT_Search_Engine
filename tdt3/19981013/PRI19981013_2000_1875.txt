The outgoing prime minister of Italy, Romano Prodi, has agreed to 
a request from President Scalfaro to try to form a new government. 
Mr. Prodi resigned four days ago after loosing a confidence vote. 
Princess Kennedy sent this report from Rome. Mr. Prodi's decision 
to try to form a new government came as a surprise after losing a 
confidence vote last week, the former economics professor indicated 
he wasn't interested in political games just to stay in power. Mr. 
Prodi's acceptance of the President's offer is provisional. He said 
it depended on two conditions, real support in parliament and the 
possibility to respect his coalition's programs. The parties of The 
Olive Tree Alliance want a new government that would guarantee the 
approval of next year's budget, vital for putting Italy's finances 
in order and for its commitments under European monetary Union. Princess
