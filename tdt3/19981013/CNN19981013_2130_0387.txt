The justice department has charged a retired U.S. army sergeant with 
spying for the former Soviet Union. David sheldon Boone worked as 
a code breaker for the army's national security agency. He's accused 
of selling top-secret information to the KGB between 1988 and 1991. 
The information reportedly included data concerning the U.S. targeting 
of nuclear weapons, and the movement and capabilities of Soviet troops. 
An affidavit says Boone was paid $60,000. He was arrested after being 
lured to Washington for a meeting with an undercover FBI agent, posing 
as a Russian contact.
