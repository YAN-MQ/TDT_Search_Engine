Viewers of television shows like ``The Practice'' and ``Law and Order'' 
may be momentarily confused next month when American Honda Motor Co. 
starts a $50 million advertising campaign for its new Odyssey minivan. 
One of the ad's scene-setting shots is intended to be mistaken for 
network programming. A group of soberly dressed, gray-haired lawyers 
are bargaining over the competing interests of their clients in a 
book-lined room. The surprise comes from the antagonists' unusual 
demands and who their clients turn out to be. ``Your offer to give 
my clients reading lights would be acceptable,'' one lawyer says, 
peering over the top of his reading glasses. ``If they could read.'' 
The camera turns on two girls in ponytails and jumpers, doodling on 
legal pads. In a similar 30-second spot, a voice-over says, ``My client 
doesn't think we need a third seat.'' ``Objection,'' replies a lawyer 
in a pinstriped suit, his hair slicked back. ``My client sleeps back 
there.'' As if signaling agreement, a large dog seated at the table 
wags his tail. The ads are intended to convey the attributes of Honda's 
redesigned full-sized minivan in an entertaining way, said Gerry Rubin, 
president and chief executive of Rubin Postaer &AMP; Associates in 
Santa Monica, Calif. About half of the agency's $500 million in billings 
are for Honda, a unit of Honda Motor Co. ``In the first frames, if 
you show a car, you run the risk of turning off the viewer,'' Rubin 
said. ``We don't think we run that risk with these ads.'' The spots 
are a calculated attempt to fool the viewer into believing they are 
seeing an extension of regular programming. It is a slickly convincing 
effort in part because the actor-lawyers are near archetypes, handpicked 
by Joel and Ethan Coen, the film makers who were hired to produce 
the spots. The film-making siblings have an eye for character selection, 
making a pregnant police chief the lead role in their Oscar-winning 
film ``Fargo.'' The Coen brothers previously produced spots for the 
Honda Accord that spoofed movies. The two TV spots for the Odyssey 
are to be shown beginning Nov. 2 in the top 30 markets. Besides shows 
about lawyers, where the ads' story lines seem environmentally appropriate, 
Honda is also buying time during ``ER,'' ``Frasier,'' the Fox Family 
Channel and the Disney Channel. Two more spots are being finished 
and prepared for broadcast during the Super Bowl on Jan. 25. The six-month 
campaign also includes displays of the vehicle at the nation's 10 
largest airports, except for O'Hare International in Chicago. Terminal 
doors were not big enough to accommodate the 75.6-inch Odyssey. Ad 
pages will also be bought in 15 magazines, including Time, Business 
Week and Golf Life, where Honda traditionally places ads, but also 
life-style titles like Good Housekeeping, Family Life and Parents. 
``We would not find these on a typical Honda schedule,'' Rubin said. 
Honda is trying to broaden its reach to more women and customers who 
would normally buy domestic models. Over all, Honda's share of the 
U.S. auto market is 8.1 percent. It sold 993,540 cars in 1998, an 
8 percent increase compared with 1997 sales. The Odyssey, to be priced 
between $23,200 and $25,800, has a V6 engine and is the largest car 
ever made by Honda. Two years ago, a more compact four-cylinder version 
built in Japan received a lukewarm reception. It was seen as costly 
compared with full-sized domestic competitors. Honda's 1999 Odyssey 
is comparably equipped in size, power and features to domestic rivals 
like the Ford Windstar and Dodge Caravan. Honda is a latecomer to 
the minivan party. Minivan sales are no longer growing at racing speed 
as they did in the 1980s. Sales total about 1.2 million a year. Even 
so, automakers are still trying to lure minivan buyers with more features, 
like dual sliding doors and improved performance. Odyssey sales will 
initially be constrained to 60,000 a year by production capacity at 
Honda's new plant in Alliston, Ontario. Honda sold 27,000 of the old 
Odyssey model in 1996, 20,000 in 1997 and has sold 12,600 so far this 
year. Months before the Odyssey went on sale, the automaker kicked 
on its marketing machinery. About 123,000 people who filled out reply 
cards at auto shows or asked for minivan information on line received 
Odyssey brochures. An additional 30,000 prospects, who said they intended 
to buy a minivan in the next six months, received a CD-ROM where the 
minivan's considerable features are displayed. ``We knew the product 
was coming and we tried to keep people out of the market,'' said Paul 
Sellers, Honda's national advertising manager. A similar strategy 
worked successfully when Honda introduced the Passport, its sport 
utility vehicle, which now outsells Toyota's RAV-4. ``Keeping people 
out of the market for a van is harder,'' he said. ``It's a segment 
dominated by domestic automakers where Honda has never before been 
a serious contender.''
