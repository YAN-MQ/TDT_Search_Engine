The Nobel prizes for physics and chemistry have been awarded to five 
scientist working in the United States. Both prizes were awarded for 
advances in quantum mechanics which seeks to explain the workings 
of atoms and molecules. The prize for physics was shared by Robert 
Lockland, Daniel Choy and a German, Horace Storfmer, for their insights 
into the general structure of matter. The Nobel prize for chemistry 
goes to Austrian-born Walter Pone and a British colleague, John Poppel.
