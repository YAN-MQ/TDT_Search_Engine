After the agreement ending the immediate threat of NATO air strikes 
against Serbia, the government in Belgrade has announced a series 
of political measures for Kosovo. The measures include self-rule for 
the province and international investigation into alleged war crimes 
and a local police force. Alis Gashi of the ethnic Albanians' main 
political party, The League for Democratic Kosovo, has given the initial 
agreement a guarded welcome. We welcome NATO's dedication to stop 
genocide in Kosovo and we have to wait and see compliance of all of 
those . Unfortunately, what we have seen until now, they say one thing 
and they do another thing. Alis Gashi of the League for Democratic 
Kosovo.
