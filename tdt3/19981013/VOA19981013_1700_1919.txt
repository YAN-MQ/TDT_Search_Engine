Congolese rebel leader Ernest Wamba dia Wamba has called for direct 
talks with President Laurent Kabila following the rebel victory at 
the strategic eastern town of Kindu. Mr. Wamba dia Wamba told VOA 
the takeover of Kindu, the government's eastern-most stronghold, is 
a turning point in the civil war. He said the rebels are ready for 
direct talks with President Kabila on ending the fighting. Officials 
in Kinshasa say the retreat from Kindu does not amount to an end to 
the war.
