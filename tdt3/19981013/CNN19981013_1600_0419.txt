The mother of basketball star Michael Jordan is crusading against 
inhalant abuse. Delores Jordan joined drug policy chief Barry McCaffrey 
in Washington today to announce the release of an educational video 
outlining the dangers of inhalants. Studies show by the time children 
get to high school, one in every five will have abused inhalants by 
sniffing common household products like glue or gasoline. It's known 
as huffing, and officials say it's the fourth most common form of 
drug abuse by young people.
