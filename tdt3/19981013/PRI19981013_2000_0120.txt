Negotiators for Congress and the White House are still wrestling with 
the giant omnibus spending bill that will keep the government running 
for the rest of the fiscal year. The measure now includes more than 
$500 billion in appropriations, about one-third of all federal spending. 
The budget process has been held up by disputes over funding for family 
planning and abortion, education, aid to farmers, conducting the 2,000 
census and defense. House speaker, Newt Gingrich, told reporters that 
he is much less optimistic now than he was this morning that a deal 
could be reached. The new fiscal year started thirteen days ago and 
an emergency extension of government spending expires tomorrow.
