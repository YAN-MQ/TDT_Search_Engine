More than 3,000 jobs go at one of the most famous names in investment 
banking. I'm Richard Griffis at the New York Business Desk. The U.S. 
securities firm Merrill Lynch is laying off nearly 3,500 employees, 
about five percent of its work force. The announcement came as the 
company reported its first quarterly loss in almost nine years. Earnings 
have been hit by the turmoil in the global economy and particularly 
by trading losses in emerging markets. Wall Street banking analyst 
Howell Schroeder says job cuts elsewhere now seem inevitable. I would 
be very surprised if you did not see further job cuts. Remember this 
is a people and revenue business. You don't generate the revenues 
without the people, but if you don't have the revenues, you don't 
need the people. The question is timing, how deep, how quickly, what 
effect does that have on morale and how does that position you for 
the future.
