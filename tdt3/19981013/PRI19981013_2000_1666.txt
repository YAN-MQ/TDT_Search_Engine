While financial houses fear the worst, the global economy is being 
seen more of a challenge than a threat by the car giant Ford today. 
It is predicting that despite the current crisis, Asian car sales 
will rival U.S. and European car sales over the next ten years. Ford's 
head of strategy Martin Ingles recently told us why Asia is still 
one of its main markets along with the United States. I don't refute 
the fact that there was no growth potential left within the North 
American market for individual manufacturers. Clearly the area of 
the world where you are going to get more growth is Asia, still. Despite 
the difficulties that have taken place. We still predict that Asia 
was going to be the major growth area.
