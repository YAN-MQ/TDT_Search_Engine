dodge ram was the first, and is still the only, full-size pickup to 
be ranked "most appealing" by j.d. power and associates. it was the 
first to offer a 10 cylinder engine. and it was the first quad cab. 
and now, for the first time, we're offering a thousand dollars back 
on the truck that changed the rules. but hurry. this is one first 
that won't last. ends november ninth.
