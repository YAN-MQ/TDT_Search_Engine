The outgoing Cabinet has named Chancellor Helmut Kohl's influential 
advisor on foreign policy as Germany's new ambassador to NATO effective 
in November, Kohl's office said Tuesday. Chancellor-elect Gerhard 
Schroeder, who is to be sworn in Oct. 27, was informed of Joachim 
Bitterlich's appointment, the chancellery said. The Cabinet made the
