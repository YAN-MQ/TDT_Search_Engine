A Bill on its way to President Clinton's desk makes it a federal crime 
to lure children over the Internet for sex. Those convicted could 
receive up to five years in prison for contacting a child for sex. 
The Bill doubles to ten years the sentence for luring a child across 
state lines for sex and increases the maximum penalty for engaging 
a minor in prostitution from 10 to 15 years.
