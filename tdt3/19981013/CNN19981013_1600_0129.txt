Despite the breakthrough, NAto is taking a "wait and see" attitude 
to the agreement. The alliance has authorized the use of military 
force, but will wait 96 hours to see if Milosevic adheres to the terms 
of the deal. Here's the latest in Naples. Christiane Amanpour has 
more. With the announcement of a breakthrough in talks on the Kosovo 
crisis, on board the "USS LaSalle," Navy personnel look like they 
are relaxing after frantic preparations made in case a strike is ordered 
against targets in Kosovo and elsewhere in Yugoslavia. But inside 
the ship's command and control center, away from the cameras, the 
head of the U.S. sixth fleet continues planning military maneuvers, 
and NAto says its threat still stands, as finishing touches are put 
on the deal to defuse the Kosovo crisis. At Navy ports and air bases, 
military officials have gone silent, no formal interviews or comments 
to the media, because after days of publicly ratcheting up the military 
threat against Slobodan Milosevic, the order now is to lower the profile 
as the final set of negotiations are under way in Belgrade. NATO's 
16 members completed their plans for air strikes early Tuesday morning, 
and issued a so-called "activation order" that places hundreds of 
fighter jets, bombers and warships under the command of general Wesley 
Clark, NATO's military boss. If Milosevic fails to comply, Clark can 
order strikes at any time, as early as this weekend. In order to avert 
an attack, NAto officials say Milosevic has to pull his special forces 
out of Kosovo and sign agreements allowing international observers 
to monitor the withdrawal and cease-fire in Kosovo and allow NAto 
surveillance planes TO back up that mission. Christiane Amanpour,
