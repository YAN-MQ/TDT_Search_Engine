Congolese rebel leader, Ernest Wamba dia Wamba, has called for direct 
talks with President Laurent Kabila following the strategic eastern 
town of Kindu. Mr. Wamba dia Wamba told VOA the takeover of Kindu, 
the government's eastern-most stronghold, is a turning point in the 
civil war. He said the rebels are ready for direct talks with President 
Kabila on ending the fighting. Officials in Kinshasa say the retreat 
from Kindu does not amount to an end of the war.
