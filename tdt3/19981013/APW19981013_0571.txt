Authorities on Tuesday identified a badly decomposed body found on 
the eastern Aegean island of Samos as that of a Dutch tourist who 
was reported missing a year ago, media reported. A hunter discovered 
the body, identified as that of Johannes Franciscus Klein, 55, in 
a mountainous area of the island, media said. Klein had been reported 
missing while on holiday on Sept. 11, 1997. Police could not immediately 
confirm the report. According to media reports, police believe Klein 
died when he accidentally slipped on loose rocks. Klein's body was 
taken to a Samos hospital for an autopsy, media said.
