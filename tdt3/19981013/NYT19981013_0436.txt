HARTFORD, Conn. _ U.S. Rep. Barbara Kennelly, who throughout her campaign 
for Connecticut governor has touched on many issues but never found 
a theme, Tuesday night unified her concerns about the state's future 
by asserting that the prosperity trumpeted by Gov. John Rowland amounts 
to only half of ``a tale of two states.'' Mrs. Kennelly, a Democrat, 
used the second of four debates to present what amounted to a closing 
argument for her candidacy, and her staff said she planned to stick 
to the theme every day through the election on Nov. 3. ``In the Connecticut 
that John Rowland talks about, all is well,'' she said at the Old 
State House in Hartford, where she announced her candidacy 13 months 
ago. But she said that other residents, particularly those with children, 
are struggling. ``Rowland doesn't want to talk about that state _ 
it doesn't fit on a 30-second ad. But more and more people are being 
pushed into that other Connecticut every day.'' Rowland, 41, who entered 
the race's homestretch with six times as much cash as Mrs. Kennelly, 
replied that one of the problems with her campaign is that she has 
emphasized the negative at a time when polls show most people are 
happy with the state's direction. He said all residents had benefited 
from his policies of cutting taxes and encouraging small businesses, 
which he said would cushion a recession by making the state less dependent 
on the defense and insurance industries. ``One of my goals as governor 
over the next four years is to make sure that everyone enjoys the 
same quality of life,'' he said. ``We're building up momentum, we're 
creating excitement, we're putting this state on the map and we're 
going to continue forward.'' Mrs. Kennelly, 62, said her plans included 
a patients' bill of rights that would allow people to sue health maintenance 
organizations, and a scholarship plan that would provide a free state 
education to students who maintain high grades in high school and 
college. Those plans would improve the lives of people who are forced 
to work two jobs, find a college education to be out of reach or have 
been denied health coverage, she said. ``That's why I'm running for 
governor: because we shouldn't be two Connecticuts,'' she said. ``We 
should be one Connecticut.'' Both candidates were more aggressive 
in Tuesday night's debate than they were in last week's, which was 
only the second debate of Mrs. Kennelly's 23-year political career. 
On Tuesday, each repeatedly disputed the other's facts. Sitting on 
a huge lead in polls, Rowland hung back at the first debate and did 
not rebut many statements by Mrs. Kennelly that he later confessed 
had him itching to respond. ``During the last debate, I let a few 
shots slide,'' he said Tuesday night. ``Mrs. Kennelly has voted for 
every single major tax increase _ every single major tax increase 
_ over 17 years,'' he said. When Mrs. Kennelly tried to interrupt 
to dispute that statement, Rowland would not give up any of his time, 
and cut her off by saying, ``it's my minute.''
