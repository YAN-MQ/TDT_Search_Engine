Ukraine's parliamentary opposition was unable to muster enough votes 
Tuesday to force through a no-confidence motion and bring down President 
Leonid Kuchma's government. Parliament voted 203-108, with 66 abstentions, 
to express no-confidence in the government over its handling of Ukraine's 
growing economic crisis. That fell just short of the 226 votes needed 
for the motion to pass in the 450-seat Verkhovna Rada. A second attempt 
late Tuesday yielded even fewer votes in favor of the government's 
resignation. The parliament's vote defied appeals from Kuchma, who 
has insisted that such an action would only ``aggravate the situation 
in the country'' and hurt the battered economy. Parliament is ``not 
prepared to assume responsibility'' for leading the nation out of 
the crisis, Kuchma said. Earlier Tuesday, Prime Minister Valery Pustovoitenko 
attacked his leftist foes for heating up political disputes as the 
economy worsens. He said the parliament had failed to adopt measures 
to battle the crisis and urged it to work jointly with the government 
rather than ``call it on the carpet every month.'' But Communist leader 
Petro Symonenko nevertheless insisted on the no-confidence vote. ``We 
are convinced that the government should be made to resign and the 
course should be changed,'' Symonenko told parliament. Ukraine, a 
former Soviet republic of 50 million people, has suffered badly from 
the economic crisis in neighboring Russia. Inflation has soared, causing 
foreign investors to withdraw from Ukraine's shaky financial market. 
The national hryvna currency has lost 71 percent of its value so far 
this year, according to Pustovoitenko. The government also has heavy 
domestic and foreign debts, industrial output is falling and budget 
revenues remain billions of dollars off target because of the inability 
to collect taxes. Pustovoitenko said the government planned to support 
selected industries, stimulate banking activities and investments 
and amend the complex tax system that has discouraged some foreign 
investors from coming to Ukraine. Pustovoitenko also promised to support 
private businesses and focus more on privatization, which has stalled 
in recent months. He called on parliament to approve Cabinet's anti-crisis 
plan and its draft 1999 budget.
