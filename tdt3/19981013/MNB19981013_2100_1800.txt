Although Serbian President Slobodan Milosevic has finally agreed to 
withdraw his Serbian forces from Kosovo, U.S. officials say they have 
eventual deals like this come and go before, that it's way to too 
early to say this crisis is over. Ubbed -- under the deal worked out 
with U.S. envoy Richard Holbrooke, Milosevic has also agreed to begin 
peace negotiations of some sort with ethnic Albanians in Kosovo and 
allow 2,000 international inspectors into the Serb province. Or at 
least that's the deal. Today the president warned NATO will take action 
if serious progress isn't made within four days. The international 
community prefers compliance to conflict but in voting to give our 
military commanders authority to carry out air strikes against Serbia, 
NAto sent a clear message to President Milosevic. NAto is ready to 
act. It is up now to the president of Serbia to follow through on 
his mmitments. Hundreds of people have been killed and hundreds of 
thousands ve had to flee their homes since the Serbs started cracking 
down on ethnic Albanians last February.
