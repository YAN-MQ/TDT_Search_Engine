For 30 years Daniel Brush has led a double life _ as a painter and 
an object maker. His monumental abstract paintings were exhibited 
in one-man shows here during the 1970s, at the Phillips Collection 
(1974) and at the Corcoran Gallery of Art (1976 and 1977). But his 
exquisitely detailed steel and gold miniature objects _ boxes in the 
form of exotic temples, bowls with fragile butterflies on the rims 
and paperweights in the shape of leaves _ were unknown to the public 
until now. Last month, 70 of his objects went on view here in ``Daniel 
Brush: Gold Without Boundaries,'' a retrospective exhibition at the 
Renwick Gallery of the National Museum of American Art. The show, 
through Jan. 10, coincides with the publication of an elaborately 
illustrated book about the artist's metal works (Harry N. Abrams, 
$65). At 51, the enigmatic Brush, a former professor of art history 
at Georgetown University, is little known in the art world but has 
a following of about 20 collectors, who snap up his works when any 
become available. He says he seeks no gallery affiliation and welcomes 
few visitors to his studio, in Manhattan. He prefers instead to see 
people in his loft home, limiting such visits to the collectors and 
curators he knows or who come recommended by friends and clients. 
He speaks eloquently about his work but does not quote prices, saying 
only that his pieces range ``from the mid-five figures to well into 
six figures.'' The preciousness of Brush's miniatures _ steel splashed 
with gold and studded in some cases with diamonds, rubies or emeralds 
_ has inspired admirers to call him a late-20th-century Faberge. Unlike 
the Russian jeweler to Romanov Czars, however, Brush does not maintain 
a workshop, turning out thousands of items each year. Instead, he 
works alone, producing everything by hand (including his tools). At 
most, he makes five objects a year, each taking hundreds, even thousands, 
of hours to complete. ``Faberge was never at the bench; he was a designer,'' 
said the gem dealer Ralph Esmerian, a collector of Brush's work and 
the president of the Museum of American Folk Art. ``Daniel is that 
rare person who had crazy ideas and followed them through with his 
own hands _ like the Renaissance goldsmith Cellini.'' When he met 
Brush more than a decade ago, Esmerian admired the Greek-style earrings 
that the artist was then producing, each featuring minuscule strings 
of grainlike bits of gold. ``What grabbed me was the granulation on 
his jewelry,'' Esmerian said. ``When you put your eyepiece to it, 
you see its clarity. I've never before seen such precise granulation. 
His work in steel has great tension in its marriage of that primitive 
metal with his highly sophisticated technique.'' The precision work 
in gold can also be seen in the micro mosaics that cover the walls 
of Brush's dome boxes, like one called ``Justinian,'' which at three 
inches in diameter is just large enough to store stamps or pills. 
Brush creates each piece in much the way a dentist fills a tooth, 
pressing the metal into irregularly shaped steel frames. The resulting 
tablets are of varying thicknesses and not quite square. They have 
uneven surfaces and are shaved at the corners so that the gold glows 
like a rainbow in the light. ``The more you know gold, the less you 
know about it,'' Brush said. ``It's a strangely beguiling, mysterious 
material. Somedays I see purple halos come off it, and other days 
it's just brittle.'' Steel poses different challenges for the artist. 
``I like the deep blackness of it,'' Brush said. ``There are 5,200 
varieties, and I order steel for its alloy content. Alloys give steel 
malleability and color. Chromium turns it blue and green, copper red, 
and sometimes you get a fluorescent flamingo pink. I have no idea 
why.'' Brush said his fascination with objects began during a trip 
to London with his family when he was 13. Seeing Chinese lacquer bowls 
and Greek gold necklaces at the Victoria and Albert Museum, he decided 
that he wanted to make objects like them himself. Objects he saw at 
museums on later trips to Europe, Asia and North Africa further stoked 
his creative urges. For the last 30 years he has continued to find 
inspiration for his work abroad, traveling extensively with his wife, 
Olivia, an artist, and their son, Silla. But it was an incident closer 
to home that inspired his creation of lifelike insects with gold wings 
thinner than tissue paper. When Silla was at camp 15 years ago, he 
and some friends released monarch butterflies that they had raised, 
sending a burst of wings into the summer sky. Brush said he was so 
awed by the butterflies' sudden flight that he tried to capture that 
motion by designing butterflies and bees fitted with magnets. ``You 
can take them off and put them on your refrigerator if you choose,'' 
he said. These days Brush is making steel objects that reflect the 
drawn lines and moire-like imagery of his monochromatic oil paintings. 
He chisels wavy patterns similar to those on the paintings on rocklike 
forms or leaf-shaped blocks, then adds glittering splashes of gold. 
Now his two lives are seemingly becoming one.
