Toll collectors at New York City's tunnels and bridges are being forced 
to be polite. They're required to say "thank you" after accepting 
tolls. To enforce the policy, undercover officers are watching toll 
booth workers. Those who fail to say "thank you" to motorists are

of the transportation authority's civility campaign. We'll have the 
days top stories coming up next.
