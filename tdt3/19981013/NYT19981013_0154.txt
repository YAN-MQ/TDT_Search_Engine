The label on this most attractive pinot noir would have you believe 
it was made by a winery called Zabaco in Healdsburg, Calif. That is 
true up to a point; there is a Zabaco Winery, but it is also known 
as E.&AMP; J. Gallo. Zabaco is one of a number of labels the Gallos 
use for the lower-priced wines made in their new Sonoma County winery. 
They also make pinot noir under the Indigo Hills and Anapamu labels, 
the first with a North Coast appellation and the second with a Monterey 
County appellation. All three sell at about the same price. The Zabaco 
is a full, fruity pinot noir, typical of the 1995 vintage in California. 
It is a wine to drink young and is the equal of some pinot noirs costing 
$18 to $20.
