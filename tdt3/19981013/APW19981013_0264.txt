Sacre bleu! A wine buff says he has proof that it was the British 
_ not the French _ who invented champagne. Author Tom Stevenson has 
spent the last 12 years trying to persuade the wine world that there 
is a hiccup in the accepted history of the wine-making method that 
produces champagne. ``The documentary evidence describing the addition 
of sugar to a finished wine to induce a second fermentation for the 
specific purpose of making it sparkle does exist,'' Stevenson said. 
``And it is not Rheims or Epernay, the towns at the heart of Champagne, 
it is in London.'' In his latest book, ``A World Encyclopedia of Champagne 
and Sparkling Wine,'' Stevenson publishes a document he says proves 
the British were the first to deliberately produce a sparkling wine. 
The paper, written by British scientist Christopher Merret, reported 
his observations on making sparkling wine and was presented to the 
British Royal Society in 1662. That was 20 years before legendary 
blind French monk Dom Perignon was said to have perfected the champagne 
method to create the world's most exclusive sparkling wine. His discovery 
is commemorated with a statue in Rheims in eastern France and his 
name was given to one of the most famous deluxe vintage champagnes, 
marketed by producer Moet et Chandon. Now only wine made from grapes 
grown in the Champagne region, which lies 60 miles east of Paris, 
can carry the name. ``There is absolutely no evidence that Dom Perignon 
made a single bottle of sparkling wine,'' Stevenson said. ``The more 
you learn about him, the more you think that if he was doing anything 
he was trying to get the bubbles out of the bottle, not put them in 
there. The French didn't like sparkling wine.''
