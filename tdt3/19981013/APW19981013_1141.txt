A gas explosion set off a pile of gunpowder used to make illegal fireworks 
Tuesday, obliterating a two-block area of this central Mexican town 
and killing at least 10 people and wounding dozens. Rescuers said 
they expected to find more bodies as they searched collapsed houses 
in Tultepec, a town 20 miles (32 kilometers) north of Mexico City 
known for its homemade fireworks. Angry residents, apparently fearful 
that the explosion would lead to a crackdown on illegal fireworks, 
blocked journalists trying to enter the affected area. They said a 
minor gas explosion had occurred and that there was nothing to see. 
But the smell of gunpowder was strong, and television images taken 
from a helicopter showed a two-block section of town entirely leveled 
by the blast. Many blocks away, shattered glass still covered the 
street and people who live as far as five kilometers (three miles) 
away reported hearing the blast. A crater indicated the site of the 
explosion. ``It was like a bomb,'' said Alejandro Garcia, a 33-year-old 
local businessman who lives six blocks away. Mexico state Gov. Cesar 
Camacho Quiroz said at least 10 people died _ including a 10-year-old 
boy _ and 27 were wounded. But a paramedic at the scene, who spoke 
on customary condition of anonymity, said he had counted 14 bodies, 
and that at least 45 people were injured. Gen. Francisco Fernandez 
Solis, general director of public safety, gave the death toll at 10 
but said: ``we expect to find more when we clear the rubble.'' He 
confirmed that the explosion was of gunpowder. ``The explosion was 
started by a gas tank leak, which spread and caused an explosion in 
products used to make fireworks,'' he said. Tultepec is known for 
its fireworks, and many residents produce them illegally in their 
homes. Residents said the explosion occurred in the main gunpowder 
stockpile for all of the fireworks factories in the area. In June 
1997, an explosion in a Tultepec home producing illegal fireworks 
killed three people. And in December 1988, a Mexico City marketplace 
where illegal fireworks were sold exploded and set off a string of 
fires, killing 62 people and injuring 83.
