The head of IG Metall metalworkers union on Tuesday said he would 
push for a 6.5-percent pay raise for Germany's 3.4 million metalworkers 
when talks for new 1999 contracts begin later this year. The demand 
follows two consecutive years of settling for pay increases of 1.5 
percent and 2.5 percent, about even with the rate of inflation. A 
union spokeswoman said the IG Metall pay commission would hold its 
first meeting the end of October, and that a first round of talks 
with employers had not yet been scheduled. The wage talks will be 
closely watched as they will be the first under Germany's new center-left 
government, following the center-right's push to keep down labor costs.
