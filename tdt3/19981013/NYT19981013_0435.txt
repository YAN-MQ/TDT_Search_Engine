New York State Comptroller H. Carl McCall and his Republican opponent, 
Bruce Blakeman, announced competing plans Tuesday that each said would 
improve the perception of state government by placing new restrictions 
on political giving. Blakeman, a Nassau County legislator, said that 
if elected he would unilaterally limit the contributions he would 
accept from donors doing business with his office. He attacked McCall's 
fund raising, saying that McCall's record of accepting large contributions 
from such donors had harmed the integrity of the office. Since he 
began his term in 1995, McCall has received more than $1.8 million 
in contributions from donors doing business with the state pension 
fund, which the Comptroller solely controls. That is at least 35 percent 
of his total funds raised, $5.2 million, according to campaign finance 
records. Blakeman repeatedly cited an article about McCall's fund-raising 
that appeared earlier this month in The New York Times. It described 
how some McCall donors gave money just before or after they were awarded 
work by the pension fund. ``These new rules go a long way in curbing 
potential abuses,'' Blakeman said. ``I believe that when you analyze 
the contributions that have been made to McCall and the size of the 
contributions and the timing, it certainly gives the appearance that 
there is some kind of pay-to-play scenario, which I think is wrong.'' 
McCall has denied any link between donations and matters involving 
his office, noting that he has long been a strong supporter of overhauling 
the campaign finance system. He responded to Blakeman's plan by issuing 
his own, which would affect all state and local offices. McCall, who 
has a wide lead in opinion polls, proposed that the state bar all 
candidates for state and local office from accepting contributions 
from donors with interests before the offices they hold or are seeking. 
He said he would introduce legislation in January to bring about that 
change. ``I'm glad my opponent had joined me in calling for campaign 
finance reform,'' McCall said in a statement. ``I only wish he would 
jump all the way in instead of just sticking his toe in the water.'' 
He later added: ``My opponent says if he is elected, he'll limit the 
amount entities doing business with this office can contribute. We 
have to go farther.'' Such a broad ban has little chance of passing 
the Legislature, which has not shown much interest in recent years 
in tightening the campaign finance system. Under Blakeman's plan, 
individuals, companies and others receiving business from the comptroller's 
office could contribute up to $5,000, as opposed to the legal limit, 
$28,000. And executives of businesses involved with the office could 
give up to $10,000 for each business. Under the law, there is no limit 
on how much executives from the same business can give in total. McCall 
declined to say whether he would place any constraints on his fund 
raising if the legislation was not approved. In the past, he has said 
he would not unilaterally limit his fund raising. Groups that advocate 
toughening the campaign finance laws say the restrictions proposed 
by both candidates would be difficult to enforce because people would 
try to get around them by finding other ways of giving _ through relatives 
or friends, for example. The groups instead favor lowering the limits 
for all donors. Blakeman said his rules did not require the approval 
of the Legislature. He acknowledged, though, that he was not limiting 
his fund raising as a candidate. He has accepted tens of thousands 
of dollars in contributions from donors with interests before the 
Nassau County Legislature, of which is the presiding officer.
