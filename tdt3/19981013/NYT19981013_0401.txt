The New York Times said in an editorial on Wednesday, Oct. 14: It 
is a familiar story under New York's flaccid campaign finance laws. 
Attorney General Dennis Vacco accepted campaign contributions from 
a company's executives and subsidiaries suspiciously close to the 
time of his settlement of complaints against the company. The settlement 
was far more favorable than a similar investigation of the same company 
eight years earlier under a previous attorney general. The Vacco campaign 
protests that there was no connection between the donations and the 
softer landing for a large auto leasing company called Oxford Resources 
of Long Island. The campaign says the contributions were legal, and 
that may well be true _ unless somebody proves that Vacco delivered 
a quid pro quo for the donations. But the money hangs over this inquiry 
like a dark cloud. As outlined Tuesday by Clifford J. Levy in The 
Times, the earlier investigation of Oxford, in 1990, resulted in charges 
of deceptive practices that required the company to issue refunds, 
pay $10,000 in fines and reform its methods of operating. Under the 
latest settlement, some refunds of disputed amounts were paid but 
there were no fines and no allegations of wrongdoing. While the investigation 
was going on, Oxford executives and a company subsidiary donated $8,500 
to Vacco's campaign. Less than three weeks after the investigation 
was closed, the Vacco campaign received an additional $37,500 from 
nine Oxford subsidiaries. Vacco is not the first state official to 
face embarrassing questions about his contributors. New York state's 
comptroller, Carl McCall, has received contributions from lawyers, 
investment officials and others who were awarded contracts involving 
the state's $100 billion pension fund. Federal investigators are trying 
to determine whether there is any connection between $100,000 donated 
to Gov. George Pataki's campaign by a construction company that was 
awarded a $97 million contract to repair the Queens-Midtown Tunnel 
last year. The fact that Vacco is not alone, however, should not bring 
him relief. As the chief law enforcement official in the state, he 
should work harder to make certain a company cannot appear to buy 
a better legal deal under his public trust. His campaign's process 
of ``scrubbing'' contributions from those under investigation missed 
the Oxford case. The attorney general should return the Oxford contributions 
and refuse to accept any further money from contributors who have 
matters pending before his office. After that, he or his successor 
should join the fight to clean up campaign finance in New York state.
