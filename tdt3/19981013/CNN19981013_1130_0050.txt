NATO war planes remain on standby, but for now, they will not be flying 
combat missions over Yugoslavia. Diplomats have succeeded in fashioning 
what could be a peaceful way out of the Kosovo crisis. Brent Sadler 
reports, it was largely the work of U.S. special envoy Richard Holbrooke. 
From Brussels to Belgrade and -- United States envoy Richard Holbrooke 
sets off for the last and decisive meeting with President Slobodan 
Milosevic. It lasted little more than an hour, but proved to be a 
turning point in the Kosovo crisis. Agreement was reached -- a political 
breakthrough and a bold new plan to oversee Yugoslav behavior in the 
Serbian province. We have agreed with President Milosevic on a ground 
verification program, augmented by an important aerial verification 
program on the ground, the OSCE the organization of security and cooperation 
in Europe will have in Kosovo a 2,000 person verification mission. 
NAto warplanes are still poised to strike by Saturday for non-U.N. 
compliance with U.N. demands. Time is tight, but between now and then 
verbal assurances should be legally binding. It's very hard to move 
multinational organizations as fast as we're trying to move them. 
You talk about four days, it's really three and a half as we stand 
here. And so the clock is ticking. Setting up a 2,000-strong observer 
mission will take time. But aerial verification, possibly with Russian 
involvement, could start within days. It may not be the end of the 
emergency, says Richard Holbrooke, but it is a reasonable start. Brent 
Sadler, CNN, Belgrade.
