From the towering bubble-gum-pink wigs in the new opening number to 
the three-way sword fight in the new finale, Broadway's troubled musical, 
``The Scarlet Pimpernel,'' has undergone a major overhaul, noteworthy 
not only for its breadth but also for who is behind it. The musical, 
based on the 1905 novel by Baroness Orczy, had been foundering. Critics 
dismissed the show, about an English aristocrat who rescues victims 
from the Reign of Terror after the French Revolution, as campy when 
it opened in November 1997. By this spring, the 1,700-seat Minskoff 
Theater was less than half full, and in its worst weeks the show was 
losing an estimated $50,000 to $100,000. But the people who did go 
kept giving standing ovations, and one of those people was Madison 
Square Garden president and chief executive David Checketts, who saw 
``Pimpernel'' several times and felt it deserved to continue. So Checketts 
decided to do something about it: buy the show, fix it and try to 
make a profit. In July, Madison Square Garden's parent, Cablevision 
Systems Corp., announced that its Radio City Entertainment division 
was acquiring ``The Scarlet Pimpernel'' in a joint venture with financier 
Theodore Forstmann, who is one of the show's original producers. In 
addition to saving a show he believed in, Checketts said, he thought 
the investment would pay off, that Cablevision could market the show 
more effectively on television and, if it proved successful, start 
several road companies around the country. For a company like Cablevision, 
the ``Pimpernel'' deal is small potatoes. The company and Forstmann 
each put up about $1 million for the refurbishment, according to one 
person who is working on the new production. No cash, stock or debt 
was exchanged in the ``Pimpernel'' deal. Cablevision assumed financial 
responsibility for the musical and obtained all the rights to it. 
Indeed, although Broadway shows are always a roll of the dice, Checketts 
seemed unfazed by the odds. ``When you start talking about businesses 
that have risks _ the New York Knicks, the New York Rangers _ we're 
kind of used to that,'' Checketts said. ``I don't see this as very 
risky.'' Checketts also said his company wanted to break into Broadway, 
beyond the three live entertainment shows it already produces in New 
York: ``A Christmas Carol,'' ``The Wizard of Oz'' and the ``Radio 
City Christmas Spectacular.'' Radio City is already one of the producers 
on the new Broadway musical ``Footloose,'' which opens at the Richard 
Rodgers Theater this month. ``Our business is live events, and Broadway 
is an extension of that,'' Checketts said. ``We're going to develop 
more and more live products, particularly products that we can take 
out of town, because we think Middle America loves Broadway.'' On 
Oct. 1 the curtain came down on the final performance of the old ``Pimpernel.'' 
The show was dark for eight days while the cast rehearsed. And Saturday 
afternoon, the curtain rose on the new ``Pimpernel.'' ``We bought 
the show; it belongs to us,'' Checketts said. ``From the day we closed 
the show, we could do anything we wanted, subject to the creative 
team.'' Given the highly unusual nature of this arrangement, theater 
veterans are skeptical. ``It's always a long shot that you can redo 
a musical that's already been seen by so many people,'' said Rocco 
Landesman, president of Jujamcyn Theaters. ``But you have to admire 
the belief in the project. And if it helps the show have a longer 
life, I'm all for it.'' Whether it will remains to be seen. Songs 
and scenes have been cut and new ones added. There are new costumes 
and new sets. And although Douglas Sills has stayed on in his Tony-nominated 
role as the Pimpernel, Rex Smith and Rachel York have taken over the 
other two leading roles. ``There is no scene that stayed exactly as 
it was,'' said Nan Knighton, who wrote the book and lyrics. ``There 
are only a couple of songs that have remained completely untouched.'' 
One would expect considerable creative tension when a corporation 
comes in and takes over. But the writers and actors in ``Pimpernel'' 
say they view Cablevision as nothing short of a knight in shining 
armor; the show's days were clearly numbered. In fact, Ms. Knighton 
said, she was the one who originally turned to Forstmann for help 
in financing a television commercial as a last-ditch effort when it 
looked as if the ``Pimpernel'' was doomed. ``We reached a point where 
we knew we would have to close the show down,'' Ms. Knighton said. 
Forstmann hooked up with Checketts, and the two men realized that 
they agreed on two things: the show was worth saving and it needed 
work. What the show lacked, the businessmen determined, was a consistent 
tone, clearer plot and character development and _ perhaps most important 
_ more aggressive marketing. In marketing, Checketts felt Radio City 
Entertainment had a lot to offer, given its ability to promote its 
projects on cable television and its success with sports events and 
concerts and more recently with theater at Madison Square Garden, 
Radio City Music Hall and the Theater at Madison Square Garden. As 
for Forstmann, he said turning around troubled businesses is what 
he does for a living _ why not a Broadway show? His leveraged buyout 
company, Forstmann Little &AMP; Co., has reversed the fortunes of 
companies like the Gulfstream Aerospace Corp. and Dr Pepper/Seven-Up 
Cos. ``Conceptually, this is not foreign to me at all,'' Forstmann 
said. ``Let's say a company has a good product and there's something 
wrong. So you step in and you try to fix it. Here I wouldn't have 
put my money into it to begin with if I hadn't thought the idea was 
great.'' Nevertheless, now that Forstmann is in deep, he said he was 
eager to see the ``Pimpernel'' pay off. If it does, the original producers 
stand to benefit as well. In addition to Forstmann, they include Pierre 
Cossette, Bill Haber, Hallmark Entertainment and Kathleen Raitt. ``Our 
investors are now in a position to get their money returned,'' Cossette 
said. ``This is terrific for all.'' In remaking the show, the new 
producers turned to Tim Hawkins, the senior vice president of Radio 
City Entertainment who became an executive producer on ``Pimpernel,'' 
and to Robert Longbottom, who became the show's director and choreographer, 
replacing Peter Hunt, the original director, and Adam Pelty, the original 
choreographer. Longbottom has directed the ``Radio City Christmas 
Spectacular'' for four years and he directed ``Sideshow'' on Broadway 
last season. Longbottom said he had tried to emphasize the heroic 
aspect of the play. ``We've focused on the adventure of this and what 
it means to get involved, what ultimately will push our buttons to 
take a stand,'' he said. ``That's the part that really spoke to me.'' 
The producers replaced two of the leads, Christine Andreas and Terrence 
Mann, ostensibly because of scheduling conflicts. In August Ms. Andreas 
told Playbill Online: ``The producers have come in with new ideas 
about the role of Marguerite that don't include me. And that is fine.'' 
Before going forward, Checketts said, he and Forstmann met with Sills 
and made sure he would stay with the show. ``I said, `We don't want 
to be in the rowboat alone,''' Checketts said. ``He's got such great 
energy and leadership, I don't think we could have done it without 
him.'' Sills said their commitment was compelling: ``I think that 
is the future of Broadway.'' Radio City did some market research _ 
focus groups and phone surveys _ and found that a key problem with 
the show was that the general public did not know what it was about. 
``The challenge was, how do you change a communications strategy about 
a show so this time people understand what it is you're doing?'' Checketts 
said. ``You can't call it, `Scarlet Pimpernel II,' but it is a different 
show.'' They enlisted the advertising agency Kirshenbaum Bond &AMP; 
Partners, which developed the ``Broadway's Most Intriguing Musical'' 
campaign for the show that is already blanketing billboards and television. 
A sample: ``Blackmail. Murder. Seduction. Bring Your Mother!'' The 
play's creative people say they are grateful for the rare opportunity 
to improve on their mistakes in real life, rather than merely in retrospect. 
``It was unfortunate that we never got the chance to have an out-of-town 
gig and had to open cold in New York,'' said Frank Wildhorn, the composer. 
``It's great now to take the knowledge learned from the audience and 
apply that.'' As the anchor of the show (he's onstage almost constantly), 
Sills faced perhaps the most challenging transition. In September, 
he was rehearsing the new version of ``Pimpernel'' during the day 
and performing the old version at night. There were some close calls. 
One evening, for example, he momentarily forgot the words to the song 
``The Creation of Man,'' which has been moved from the start to the 
end of the first act. ``It was panic city for the first 10 seconds,'' 
he said. Perhaps the greatest risk lies with ``the suits'' who have 
gambled on saving a struggling show. But at the moment, they sound 
pretty confident. ``If we're right and the music is good and the thing 
really works and people like what we think they like, this is going 
to be a big success,'' Forstmann said. ``If we're wrong, it isn't. 
We will not be wrong.''
