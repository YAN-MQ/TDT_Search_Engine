The Israeli prime minister says there is no chance his country will 
sign a peace agreement with the Palestinians this week. Benjamin Netanyahu 
made his comments in a statement issued a few hours after an Israeli 
man was killed and another wounded in a Jerusalem forest near the 
West Bank. Police say the assailant may have escaped to Palestinian 
controlled territory. Netanyahu is scheduled to hold meetings with 
Palestinian leader Yasser Arafat beginning Thursday outside Washington. 
He has been pressing Arafat to do more to prevent attacks against 
Israelis before turning over more of the West Bank to the Palestinians.
