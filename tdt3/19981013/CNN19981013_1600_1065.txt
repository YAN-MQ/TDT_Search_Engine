Safeway, the second-largest food and drug retailer in the country, 
is buying Chicago-based Dominick's supermarket chain. Safeway is paying 
$1.2 billion in cash. If the deal goes through, Safeway would have 
nearly 1,500 stores in 18 states and western Canada. Some analysts 
say more consolidation could follow. Bigger is definitely essential 
in the grocery industry. The major players are positioning themselves 
to take advantage of the economies of scale, and as they become bigger 
and bigger, the rivals are going to have to follow suit. So we believe 
this consolidation trend is going to continue, so that the sales and 
the economies of scale are going to be even better. Wall Street's 
reaction to the deal was mixed.
