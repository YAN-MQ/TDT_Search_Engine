President Clinton is warning Yugoslav president Slobodan Milosevic 
he must quickly implement an agreement on ending fighting in Kosovo 
if he wants to avoid NATO air strikes. Speaking at the White House, 
Mr. Clinton made clear Mr. Milosevic's promises are not enough. Mr. 
Clinton says the international community will be looking for concrete 
actions. Over the past few days, NATO's resolve moved President Milosevic 
from the battlefield to the bargaining table. The commitments he has 
made could lead -- and I emphasize the word "could" -- to the peaceful 
resolution of a crisis that threatens stability in the Balkans and 
the lives of tens of thousands of refugees, many of them homeless. 
But President Milosevic turns his commitments into concrete realities. 
First, the cessation of hostilities must continue. Second, the troops 
President Milosevic recently sent to Kosovo must begin to move out, 
and those already there must begin to come to garrison. Third, the 
international monitors must be allowed to enter and be given full 
freedom of movement. Fourth, humanitarian relief agencies must be 
able to bring help to the hundreds of thousands of displaced persons. 
And fifth, serious autonomy negotiations with the Kosovars must begin 
to go forward. As I said last night, we will not rely on what President 
Milosevic says, but on what he does for the whole world to see. To 
that end, a key component of the commitments he has made is an intrusive 
on-the-ground and in-the-air verification system. It will include 
about 2,000 international inspectors in Kosovo who will serve as watchdog 
to ensure that the cease-fire holds and the Serb forces withdraw while 
building confidence among Kosovars to return to their homes. And it 
will involve unrestricted NATO aerial surveillance to monitor compliance 
and quickly detect violations. The international community prefers 
compliance to conflict. But in voting to give our military commanders 
the authority to carry out air strikes against Serbia, NATO sent a 
clear message to President Milosevic. NATO is ready to act. It is 
up now to the president of Serbia to follow through on his commitments.
