Doctors are studying patients suffering from lupus to see if they 
might find treatments for other diseases. Linda ciampa explores the 
possible link. Cathy McSherry suffers from lupus, a disease in which 
the body's immune system attacks its own organs. You let me know if 
any areas that I'm touching hurts you. The same drugs that help keep 
McSherry alive, corticosteroids, may be speeding up the aging process 
of her bones, threatening her with osteoporosis. And it's important 
to measure your height every year to make sure that you are not losing 
any bone. Researchers at northwestern University are studying patients 
with lupus to see whether they can help prevent corticosteroids from 
weakening bones. There are over 1 million fractures that are probably 
related to osteoporosis in the United States, and the cost of that 
is over $10 billion a year. Doctors also prescribe corticosteroids 
for a number of other inflammatory diseases, including asthma and 
rheumatoid arthritis. But there, too, weak bones can result. If we 
can come up with a program to counterbalance at least a portion of 
the osteoporosis that might be related to the corticosteroids, how 
we can counterbalance that Negative effect for lupus patients, perhaps 
those strategies could be used for other patients. McSherry is trying 
to strengthen her bones with exercise, such as walking, and with a 
diet rich in calcium. When we started this study, they had us fill 
out a survey form, and then after going over that I realized that 
I probably wasn't getting as much calcium as I should have. McSherry 
says she's happy to be part of research that could not only help better 
her bones, but also help millions of others who depend on corticosteroids.
