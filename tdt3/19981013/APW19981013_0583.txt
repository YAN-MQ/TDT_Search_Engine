Buffeted by conflicting calls on how to shore up the continent's flagging 
growth, Europe's central bankers gathered Tuesday to discuss how to 
merge financial policies. In spite of pressures building from global 
financial turmoil, central bankers are determined to ensure a stable 
launch for the common currency on Jan. 1, and are not expected to 
make any sudden moves, such as cutting rates. The central bankers 
from 11 European nations adopting the single currency, or euro, must 
set a single European interest rate before the launch, which will 
bring down rates in most countries in any case. But the bankers don't 
want to react hastily to the global crisis or the decision last week 
by U.S. officials to cut the rate there, and will likely keep Europe's 
unified interest rate the same as Germany's core rate of 3.3 percent. 
``I haven't yet seen any evidence that any of the bankers are panicking,'' 
said Stefan Bergheim, economist at U.S. investment bank Merrill Lynch 
in Frankfurt. ``Europe's central bankers have been accused of being 
too naive about the international situation, but I don't think that's 
so. For now, it's `steady hand-politics','' said Bergheim. Speculation 
about a possible cut has grown since the United States cut its rate 
last week. Germany's incoming finance minister, Oskar Lafontaine, 
for one, wants rates cut to stimulate growth. Economists and Germany's 
central banker, Hans Tietmeyer, disagree. Speaking Monday, Tietmeyer 
called for Germany's key rate, a low 3.3 percent, to stay steady. 
About half of the countries launching the euro already have rates 
higher than Germany's, meaning those rates will almost certainly have 
to come down to match. Potentially more serious than the interest 
rate dispute are concerns that Germany's Social Democrats, who will 
form a government at the end of October, will try to exert political 
influence on the new bank, which is modeled closely on Germany's own 
Bundesbank. Lafontaine has made clear his desire for a political counterweight 
to the European Central Bank. For now, analysts think the bank will 
resist any pressures. Greater political influence could begin next 
July, when the term of Bundesbank president Hans Tietmeyer expires 
and the Social Democratic-led government will choose a replacement. 
Tietmeyer sits on the European Central Bank's governing council, and 
his deputy, Otmar Issing, is a member of the bank's six-member executive 
board.
