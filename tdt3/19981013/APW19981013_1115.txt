The church that formed the religious backbone of apartheid denounced 
white rule as ``sinful'' Tuesday and considered integrating with its 
non-white counterpart. The integration of the Dutch Reformed Church 
_ which once told its members that biblical teachings ordained white 
minority rule _ would mark a big step in South Africa's march toward 
racial reconciliation. After gathering in the capital Tuesday for 
its national meeting _ which is held only every four years _ church 
officials adopted a resolution rejecting ``apartheid as wrong and 
sinful not simply in its effects and operations but in its fundamental 
nature.'' ``The theological justification (of apartheid) is a travesty 
of the gospel and, in its persistent disobedience to the word of God, 
a theological heresy,'' the resolution said. The resolution also asked 
for the church to be readmitted into the World Alliance of Reformed 
Churches, from which it was expelled in 1982 during apartheid. Despite 
the strongly worded repudiation, there was resistance to a proposal 
_ to be voted on Wednesday _ for the church to merge with its non-white 
counterpart, the Uniting Reformed Church. Some delegates said they 
objected because by merging, the all-white church would then be adopting 
a theological creed held by the Uniting Reformed Church which maintains 
that God is on the side of the underprivileged. Delegate Jacobus Gerber 
of Pretoria said the creed was objectionable because of the anti-apartheid 
atmosphere in which it was adopted. But he denied race was an issue. 
``There is no racial tension,'' he told a reporter. ``This is not 
a black and white issue.'' However, there were unconfirmed reports 
that the integration proposal has angered provincial branches and 
that they are threatening to break away from the church to keep their 
religion segregated. Last month, the 164,000-member Free State provincial 
branch was reported to have opposed the merger because it objected 
to worshipping with blacks and people of mixed race. Starting in 1982, 
the church gradually renounced its hardline position but kept separate 
branches for blacks and mixed-race congregants. In 1994, the black 
and mixed-race branches merged to become the Uniting Reformed Church.
