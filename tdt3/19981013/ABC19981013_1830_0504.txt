Merrill Lynch today, the first big brokerage house to make cuts in 
staff, 3400 jobs up and down the street, there is a great deal of 
uncertainty now about what lies ahead for the people who work there. 
Here's ABC's Betsy Stark. The fear this gloomy day on Wall Street 
is that layoffs at Merrill Lynch are just the beginning. Other brokerage 
giants, including Salomon Smith Barney, banker's trust, and Prudential 
securities are also expected to announce cutbacks as early as next 
week. Wall Street hired thousands as the market soared and now that 
it's tumbled -- Revenues are down and therefore the firms can't remain 
profitable and they've got to cut employees and they've got to cut 
other expenses and hence you have layoffs. Layoffs will not affect 
most of Wall Street's big spenders -- the traders and investment bankers 
who earned in average $180,000 last year. Let's say they are not going 
to spend $250 for a bottle of wine. They just tell me the maximum 
I am going to be able to spend on a bottle of wine is $75. But even 
cutting back a little worries the hundreds of businesses street's 
millions. What we are afraid of is that people will begin to experience 
psychological poverty. The stakes are especially high for New York 
City. While Wall Street directly employs just 5% of the local workforce, 
a state study suggests it's recently accounted for more than half 
the job growth in the region -- everything from limo drivers to restaurant 
workers. Analysts expect ripples outside New York as well. Both Boston 
and San Francisco are home to major mutual funds and money management 
companies and the betting is pink slips are inevitable there, too.
