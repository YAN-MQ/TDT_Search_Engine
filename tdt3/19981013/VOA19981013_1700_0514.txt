UN secretary-general Kofi Annan says he will send a special mission 
to Kosovo over the next few days to follow up on international efforts 
to end violence in the Yugoslav province. VOA's United Nations correspondent 
Max Ruston reports. UN spokesman Fred Eckhard says Mr. Annan warmly 
welcomes news of a breakthrough in efforts to end the Kosovo crisis. 
But Mr. Eckhard says the UN secretary-general still considers it highly 
important that both sides in the conflict comply with Security Council 
resolutions concerning Kosovo. It is of paramount importance. He feels 
that both side in Kosovo honor their commitments and fully comply 
with the provisions of the two Security Council resolutions on Kosovo. 
He says Mr. Annan will send a mission to the region in the coming 
days in response to Security Council requests. The council has asked 
Mr. Annan to report regularly on compliance with its Kosovo resolutions. 
The most recent Security Council resolution concerning Kosovo, Number 
1199, demands an immediate cease-fire, the withdrawal of Yugoslav 
forces recently sent to the province, immediate access to the area 
by humanitarian relief agencies and agreement on a timetable for autonomy 
negotiations with ethnic Albanians in Kosovo. Mr. Annan was active 
in supporting U.S. envoy Richard Holbrooke's negotiations this week 
with Yugoslav president Slobodan Milosevic. On Monday, Mr. Annan telephoned 
Mr. Milosevic. He urged the Yugoslav president to comply with Security 
Council resolutions and encouraged him to work with Mr. Holbrooke.
