Good evening. During the long run of good times on Wall Street right 
up to mid-July of this year, everyone kept saying, "this can't last," 
but of course, they hoped it would. Well, it didn't. And there was 
never a stronger signal of that than the announcement out of Merrill 
Lynch today. The world's largest stock brokerage is laying off thousands 
of employees. As NBC's chief financial correspondent Mike Jensen tells 
us, this is about a lot more than Merrill Lynch. The announcement 
by Merrill Lynch, that it's eliminating 3,400 jobs is the first in 
what's expected to be a wave of layoffs by stock brokers and investment 
banking firms. Why the cutbacks? We began to see a downturn in the 
business in early August, and it was a direct result of the Russian 
default. It's a sudden end to an incredible boom. Three months ago 
Wall Street was racking up record profits, hiring new brokers and 
analysts, promising huge bonuses. Then the global economy fell apart, 
and now Wall Street is reeling. There are a lot of people worried 
about their jobs. They're worried because profits are plunging. Last 
year, Merrill Lynch made a profit of more than $500,000 in July, August 
and September. This year, in those same three months, Merrill Lynch 
lost $164 million, and its stock price plunged from $109 a share all 
the way down to $42. Does trouble on Wall Street mean problems down 
the road for main street? It certainly does in New York. An early 
casualty -- the booming real estate market. Prices for the most expensive 
apartments cut by 10%. Those prices are being cut simply because Wall 
Street's not doing well. Wall Streeters get a big part of their income 
from year-end bonuses, and this year they're expected to be slashed 
by as much as 25%, $3 billion. So brokerage house employees, whose 
paychecks average more than $170,000 a year, are already cutting back 
in what they buy at fancy stores, on $90 theater tickets on Broadway 
and on $75 meals at expensive restaurants. We're reducing our dinner 
price by 20% in one of our dining rooms. Should other businesses be 
worried about widespread layoffs? So far, most experts say no, not 
unless there's a recession. And that depends on whether the turmoil 
overseas can be contained. Mike Jensen, NBC news, New York.
