Anna Kournikova served up a massive 17 double-faults Tuesday, handing 
eighth-seed Dominique Van Roost a straight-sets victory in the first 
round of the European Championships. Becoming the first Belgian man 
or women ever to enter the world's top-10 rankings on Monday, an assertive 
Van Roost needed just 56 minutes to dispatch the faltering Russian 
6-3, 6-1. ``It makes a huge difference when you know you've entered 
the top-10 and you've beaten some really great players,'' said Van 
Roost, who ended Martina Hingis's reign as world No. 1 when she toppled 
the Swiss in the quarterfinals in Filderstadt last week. ``It made 
a huge difference on my side and on the other side because she knew 
it, too.'' Van Roost showed only a momentary lapse in the first set, 
allowing Kournikova to break and go up 3-2. But the Belgian displayed 
the same determination which allowed her to defeat Hingis, winning 
the next four games to take the set. Struggling with her service game, 
the 17-year-old Russian labored in the second set to retain her opening 
serve, before losing her next three and literally handing Van Roost 
the win. ``I think she was nervous and under pressure,'' said Van 
Roost. ``She's probably the most famous player at the moment, even 
more than Martina. ``With people around her all the time, being in 
every newspaper, being the the star, she has to win a tournament. 
She needs to prove she's deserving of her status.'' Van Roost was 
quick to acknowledge Kournikova had talent and predicted the Russian 
would be back in the top-10 before long. Kournikova, who fell out 
of the top-10 after tearing ligaments in her right thumb in a fall 
in Eastbourne, is currently ranked 12th in the world. She has not 
lost to anyone ranked outside the world's top-15 since the start of 
1997. ``I was a bit nervous but I'm not feeling pressure from anybody,'' 
denied Kournikova, who repeatedly looked over to her coach Pavel Slozil 
after losing a point. ``I was just getting uptight as the match went 
on.'' With Hingis withdrawing due to an ankle injury, it was fifth-seed 
Patty Schnyder who kept the Swiss crowd happy, beginning her campaign 
with a 6-2, 6-3 victory over Italy's Silvia Farina. Schnyder, who 
needed just 54 minutes to dispose of the Italian, won five titles 
this season and reached the final of the Grand Slam Cup before losing 
to Venus Williams. American qualifier Corina Morariu posted a 6-3, 
2-6, 6-4 win over France's Sandrine Testud, who beat out Lindsay Daveport 
in the final of Filderstadt on Sunday. Sixth-seed Amanda Coetzer advanced 
to the second round with a 7-5, 6-4 win over Natascha Zvereva of Belarus. 
American Lisa Raymond, who reached the semifinals last year after 
upsetting Hingis in the quarterfinals, advanced to the second round 
with a 6-4, 6-4 victory over lucky-loser Catalina Cristea of Romania. 
Wednesday, new world No. 1 Davenport begins the defence of her crown 
with a second round match against French qualifier Julie Halard-Decugis. 
The 22-year-old American officially took over as the world's top player 
from Martina Hingis on Monday morning, bringing to an end Hingis's 
80 week stay at the top of the rankings, which dated back to March 
1997.
