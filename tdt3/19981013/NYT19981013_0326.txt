The Security Council called on Iraq on Tuesday to resume cooperation 
with U.N. weapons inspectors, alluding to prospects for faster progress 
on easing economic sanctions against Baghdad if it heeds the call. 
That and several somewhat conciliatory statements by various members 
of the 15-member Council followed a periodic review Tuesday of Iraq's 
compliance in eliminating its weapons of mass destruction. Such encouragement 
was clearly aimed at giving Baghdad some way of climbing down from 
a confrontation with the United Nations after Iraq suspended arms 
inspections Aug. 5, and as President Saddam Hussein contemplates his 
next move. Talks to resume cooperation failed last week when Baghdad 
charged that several Council members, notably the United States and 
Britain, were bent on maintaining sanctions. Speaking at the end of 
Tuesday's four-hour review, the president of the Council, Sir Jeremy 
Greenstock of Britain, said that in the matter of Baghdad's chemical 
weapons and missiles, ``there are not many items still to be resolved 
if that cooperation is forthcoming.'' He was preceded by Mohammed 
Baradei, head of the International Atomic Energy Agency, who said 
his Vienna-based organization had ``no indications that Iraq has nuclear 
weapons, or nuclear-weapons-usable materials or the capability to 
produce such items.'' But Baradei emphasized that the U.N. assessment 
was ``credible'' but ``not absolute,'' asserting that it depended 
on the resumption of Iraq's opening its factories to monitoring. For 
its part, the United States appeared lonely in its insistence that 
nothing should change. The U.S. representative to the Council, Peter 
Burleigh, said that despite the qualified clean bill of health given 
Iraq by the atomic energy agency on nuclear weapons, the U.S. position 
on the need for continued intrusive searches ``has not changed.'' 
Last week's attempt here to resolve the dispute failed when a high-level 
Iraqi delegation headed by Deputy Prime Minister Tariq Aziz left after 
two weeks of negotiations. Secretary General Kofi Annan had suggested 
a compromise solution by which the United Nations would conduct a 
``comprehensive review'' of Iraq's efforts, which Baghdad favored 
in the belief that the review would demonstrate that it had gone a 
long way toward eliminating its chemical and nuclear weapons and its 
missiles and in return should have some of the sanctions modified 
or lifted. France, China and Russia have expressed considerable sympathy 
with that position. But Iraq remains mired in a dispute over its elimination 
of biological weapons, particularly the nerve gas VX, and the question 
of whether it has installed the gas on some of its missiles. That 
issue will be the subject of another U.N. review set for Oct. 22 and 
23, when France, Switzerland and the United States are to submit the 
results of examinations conducted on the missiles. The United States 
has asserted that its scientists found evidence that Iraq loaded the 
gas onto some of its missiles. Switzerland said it had found no proof, 
and France has yet to deliver the results of the testing of samples 
that it has examined. Richard Butler, who heads the U.N. Special Commission, 
charged with disarming Iraq, also gave the Council a confidential 
report. And a senior U.N. official, Prakash Shah of India, is due 
in Baghdad this week to try to resolve the dispute as a special envoy 
of Annan.
