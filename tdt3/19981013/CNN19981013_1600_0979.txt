Stocks on Wall Street succumb to more losses. That ends a two-day 
win streak. Kitty pilgrim is in New York with all the closing numbers. 
Kitty? Thanks, Chuck. The day began with only modest declines and 
finished that the way as well. We did have disappointing earnings 
that gave investors the jitters. The Dow industrials fell 63 points, 
7938 was the level a drop of 11 in Eastman Kodak shares to 72 1/2.
