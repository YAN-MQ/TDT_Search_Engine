The director of the International Monetary Fund's Asia-Pacific operations 
stressed Tuesday that Malaysia needs additional reforms if its unorthodox 
move into currency controls is to work. ``Whether their present policy 
course, which is different from the other countries, will succeed, 
you have to wait and see,'' Hubert Neiss told reporters on the sidelines 
of the World Economic Forum's seventh annual East Asia Economic Summit. 
``But a lot depends on what other policies are carried out,'' said 
Neiss, noting that Malaysia's banking system is in need of repair, 
and many corporations also require restructuring. Malaysia imposed 
strict controls Sept. 1, pegging the currency to the U.S. dollar, 
banning the trade of Malaysian companies' shares in foreign markets, 
and restricting the flow of domestic and foreign capital into and 
out of the country. The surprise measures, which took immediate pressure 
off the beleaguered local currency and stock markets, is anathema 
to IMF and Western economic free-market orthodoxy. Some of Malaysia's 
closest neighbors have described the moves as a step backward for 
free trade in the region, and other critics have cautioned that it 
could lead Malaysia into a false sense of security. Malaysian officials 
attending the economic conference in Singapore this week have described 
the changes as minor, and said they would affect less than 5 percent 
of foreign investors, specifically speculators who are interested 
in short-term profit, not long-term investment. The Malaysians say 
that the forced return of the currency, the ringgit, has helped the 
economy, spurring housing construction and car purchases. They have 
described the controls as providing breathing space to insulate the 
economy from the effects of foreign speculation. It was not the first 
time a country has resorted to market controls for quick relief from 
a falling currency and stock market. ``What Malaysia did was not unique. 
Other countries have imposed controls, and usually there have been 
some problems,'' Neiss said. ``After a while, it didn't work out ... 
because controls themselves created new distortions, and controls 
were circumvented,'' he warned. He said that although Malaysia entered 
the regional crisis in a somewhat better state than other Asian countries, 
its problems were essentially the same, and required many of the same 
painful reforms. However, he said that if things go well for Malaysia, 
other countries may try to follow suit.
