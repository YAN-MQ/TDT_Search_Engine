In our report last night we pointed out after the explosion in managed 
care, which we've had with us for 20 years now, 80% of Americans say 
they are satisfied with what they're getting. That leaves, of course, 
20% who are not. As you may have heard, there are doctors who are 
not happy either. ABC's Erin Hayes on some of the doctors. Go right, 
go right. They deal every day with life and death decisions. But thousands 
of doctors say they're being second guessed, forced to cut back on 
patient care, pressured by HMOs and other managed care companies. 
We as doctors feel that we're living with a Devil that we have to 
talk about. In Dallas, guy culpepper is one of hundreds of doctors 
who just quit one of that city's biggest HMOs, fed up. We're forcing 
people through the system so quickly, you don't have time to make 
that kind of human connection. And spending too much time, they say, 
phoning managed care companies -- I have a prescription.rt of like 
calling to sayt. Many the process difficult on purpose. Every dollar 
that they spend for patient care is less for them and every dollar 
that they can delay or deny is more for them. In St. Louis, When I 
called the company -- The city's medical society started a managed 
care grievance committee. Insurance companies deny what patients really 
need. You get worn down. You just don't have the resources or the 
time to constantly go back or constantly write letters or constantly 
protest the denials. There's a real problem out there. Many doctors 
acknowledge they've lost money because of managed care, but say the 
fight now is over something much more important -- their independence 
to make decisions that are right for their patients. We did not take 
this course of training to look after the interests of a group of 
stockholders. Heather sowell and Jonathan sheldon have declared their 
Denver practice off-limits to HMOs. They call it "hm-no." There was 
no other way to practice medicine, in our opinion, ethically, for 
us. Bucking managed care is risky business, though. When Dr. culpepper 
finally told that Dallas HMO to take a hike, the HMO walked away with 
nearly one-third of his patients. He's slowly rebuilding his practice 
-- Right now, I believe she's considering becoming a physician. -- 
but like many doctors, worries that the pressures of managed care 
have damaged the practice of medicine. Erin Hayes, ABC News, St. Louis.
