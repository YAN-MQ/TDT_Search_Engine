President Oscar Luigi Scalfaro offered toppled Premier Romano Prodi 
an opportunity to get his job back Tuesday, giving Italy's second-longest 
government since World War II a chance to keep going. Prodi's center-left 
government fell five days earlier when he lost a vote of confidence 
in the Chamber of Deputies by a single vote. He initially appeared 
to rule out a return, saying he would take the job back only if he 
could stick to the cost-cutting programs that cost him the support 
of hard-line Communists. ``I never changed my mind,'' he insisted 
after Scalfaro asked him to see if he could now command a majority 
in Parliament. ``What is needed is an examination of policy and an 
examination of the situation in Parliament.'' Party members said earlier 
they had persuaded him to try again to preside over passage of the 
1999 budget. Prodi's center-left coalition collapsed Friday after 
the Communist Refoundation Party withdrew its support over the budget, 
which it said fell short in job creation. Scalfaro has been meeting 
with political leaders since then to try to form a new government. 
Two key leaders _ Francesco Cossiga, a centrist leader, and Armando 
Cossutta, leader of a breakaway faction of the Communist Refoundation 
_ indicated Tuesday they were falling in line behind a new term for 
Prodi. Earlier Tuesday, Italy's opposition forces, led by former Premier 
Silvio Berlusconi, called for early elections _ something few but 
him want. ``When a government loses its majority it must give the 
power of choice back to the citizens,'' Berlusconi said. He later 
expressed disgust at what was a day of political wrangling, declaring, 
``This is a farce.'' Prodi had governed for 2 1/2 years, making his 
the country's second-longest serving since World War II.
