The White House says budget negotiators are nearing agreement on the 
Clinton administration's request for $18 billion for the International 
Monetary Fund, but that there are still some issues to work out. Congressional 
negotiators are placing conditions on the U.S. contribution to the 
fund. President Clinton insists the IMF money is essential in efforts 
to stabilize troubled economies in Asia, Russia and in Latin America. 
The federal government is operating under an emergency spending bill 
while a final budget deal is worked out. I'm Robert Burns, VOA News.
