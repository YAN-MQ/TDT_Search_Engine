Charles Aznavour may well be the only person who remembers his first 
visit to New York, in 1948. He was 24, poor, and spoke no English, 
but he was eager for adventure. Edith Piaf had invited him to accompany 
her to the United States _ as a friend, not a lover, he insists _ 
and the ``little sparrow'' helped him find a few gigs of his own. 
More important, this short, wiry Frenchman entered a world of music 
in which he felt immediately at home. He already knew the work of 
Cole Porter, George Gershwin and Jerome Kern, and now he discovered 
Louis Armstrong, Duke Ellington and Dizzy Gillespie. When he next 
visited New York, in 1963, Aznavour had already made it as a singer, 
songwriter and actor in Europe, but he was still largely unknown in 
the United States. This time, he was determined to be noticed. He 
rented Carnegie Hall and, helped by a television appearance on the 
Jack Parr show and by his starring role in Francois Truffaut's hit 
movie ``Shoot the Piano Player,'' his concert was a sellout. ``No 
one knew me, except they had seen the film and they thought I played 
the piano,'' he recalled with amusement. ``I don't play the piano.'' 
This week, as Aznavour embarks on a new American tour, public recognition 
is the least of his problems. Having sold close to 100 million albums 
(his latest is ``Plus Bleu ...''), he now enjoys the magical status 
of international musical legend. Indeed, after the death of Frank 
Sinatra, he may well be the last practitioner of a song tradition 
that dates back to the 1940s. Yet he is no relic from the past. At 
74, as energetic and good-humored as ever, he remains a performer 
extraordinaire. Starting Tuesday, he will be appearing through Nov. 
1 at the Marquis Theater on Broadway. He will take the same show to 
the Wilshire Theater in Los Angeles from Nov. 19 through Nov. 24. 
For all his world travels, though, Aznavour's American tours are special 
to him, not least because they always raise a teasing question: Would 
he also have become a celebrity if, as was almost the case, he had 
been born an American? When his Armenian parents _ his singer father, 
Micha, and actress mother, Knar _ arrived in Paris in 1920, their 
intention was to travel on to the United States. And if their visas 
had come through quickly, Charles Aznavourian (his original surname) 
would no doubt have been born in the New World. Instead, he became 
a Frenchman, and his family settled here. Eventually, he learned English 
(through the songs of Fred Astaire, Mel Torme and Frank Sinatra, he 
notes), but as a third language. Nonetheless, his upbringing in Paris 
was as cosmopolitan as it would have been in the New York of the 1920s 
and 1930s. His parents, already part of the Armenian diaspora provoked 
by Turkish persecution, were born in Georgia and his father spoke 
Yiddish as well as Russian and Armenian. Further, in Paris, where 
his father ran a small Armenian restaurant to supplement his earnings 
as a singer and where Charles went to French primary school to learn 
of ``our ancestors, the Gauls,'' the family lived in the heart of 
the Jewish community of the Marais. ``All my childhood friends are 
Jews,'' Aznavour said in a recent interview in his son's office at 
Editions Breton, one of several music publishers that Aznavour now 
owns. ``I was brought up among them. I finished up having the same 
gestures, the same way of talking, the same way of joking. During 
the German occupation, I was arrested several times for being Jewish. 
Shall we say, I don't have a very Catholic appearance. They'd take 
me to the command post. I'd show my baptism certificate, but they 
didn't believe me. They'd make me take down my trousers. As I tell 
my friends, I am the only Ashkenazi goy in France.'' Aznavour's musical 
education, albeit informal, was no less international. His father 
taught him Russian, Jewish, gypsy, Italian and Armenian songs. He 
felt drawn to American music _ Josephine Baker had led an invasion 
of Paris by black American musicians and entertainers _ and he loved 
the tangos of Carlos Gardel. Years later, he discovered Arab, Iranian 
and Spanish music. And, in time, he concluded that his highly distinct 
tenor voice, with its raspy nasal color, had a Mediterranean quality 
that appealed to a variety of audiences. ``I think Jews like my voice 
because it has a bit of the cantor,'' he mused. ``I have North African 
followers because my voice also has something of the muezzin. It's 
an Eastern voice. I have an Eastern voice and a Western way of writing 
songs. Not that I have a particular musical style. In fact, I don't 
think there is a French musical style. The rhythms have always come 
from abroad _ tango, rock, jazz, samba, bossa nova. Perhaps only the 
French accordion is special.''
