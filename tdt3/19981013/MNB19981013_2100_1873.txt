Important to remember where the pieces all fall in this. 0% of Kosovo's 
two million people are ethnic Albanians and many want nothing less 
than full independence from Serbia. Kevin Tibbles walks us through 
that tonight and why Serbia is so determined to prevent that. A Serb 
couple celebrates their wedding this week near Pristina, the capital 
of Kosovo. Serbs make up only 10% of the population here but to them 
Kosovo is the heart of their nation. The Serbs really believe that 
it's very important to them. Without Kosovo, no Serbia, and Mr. Milosevic 
has used this to get to power. A decade ago, Kosovo was the flash 
point for the breakup of Yugoslavia. Slobodan Milosevic told Serbs 
living there they would never be defeated by the Albanian majority. 
Seeing Milosevic flex his muscles worried the rest of goslavia. That 
was the spark which led to the disintegration of Yugoslavia because 
the other slaffs, the nonserbs decided they couldn't risk it any longer. 
First Slovenia declared independence and after a brief civil war managed 
to break away. Croatia then followed. It, too, wanted out of Yugoslavia 
and its people went to war to ensure that wouldn't happen. Then it 
was Bosnia's turn to break away. The war between Serbs and Muslims 
shocked with its atrocities before NAto soldiers were dispatched to 
keep the peace. Now 10 years after his saber-rattling in Kosovo, Slobodan 
Milosevic has once again resorted to force, this time to keep Kosovo's 
Albanian jority to join other parts of the former Yugoslavia in independence. 
E fighting has already claimed more than 1,000 lives and left some 
300,000 people homeless just when winter is looming and once again, 
western powers led by negotiator Richard Holbrooke stand poised to 
unleash their sophisticated weaponry to keep Milosevic at bay. We 
have come full circle. The whole crisis started in coicecose in 91980's 
and it's going to end here. This mass grave, discovered this week 
in a field in Bosnia, holds nearly 300 bodies, a brutal reminder of 
past horrors in the former Yugoslavia. Kevin Tibbles, NBC news, London.
