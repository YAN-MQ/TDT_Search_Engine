In Washington today, the Supreme Court has let stand a controversial 
amendment to the Cincinnati city charter. It's an amendment that bans 
ordinances that protect gay people from discrimination. The court's 
refusal to hear the case is confusing because the Cincinnati amendment 
is similar to one in Colorado that the justices ruled was unconstitutional.
