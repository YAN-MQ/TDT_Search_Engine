In Afghanistan, Taliban supreme leader Mullah Mohammad Omar has banned 
the use of land mines, saying they violate Islamic law. He has called 
on opposition leaders to do the same. Meanwhile, his Taliban forces 
reportedly have gained ground in the Gorban Valley, the last opposition 
stronghold, and opposition rocket attacks have killed three civilians 
and seriously wounded several others in Kabul.
