First tonight, the headlines in "the New York Times," a paper not 
normally given to sensationalism, have read "confidence buckling as 
markets plunge" and "Wall Street's gloom has New York tense." It has 
more than Wall Street tense tonight with word today that a major company, 
a big brokerage house is making big cuts. Big nazz for -- news for 
what was a chugging company a short time ago. NBC news chief financial 
correspondent Mike Jensen will start us off tonight. The announcement 
by Merrill Lynch that it's eliminating 3,400 jobs is the first in 
what's expected to be a wave of layoffs by stock brokers and investment 
banking firms. Why the cutbacks? We began to see a downturn in the 
business in early August and it is a direct result of the Russian 
default. It's a sudden end to an incredible boom. Three months ago, 
Wall Street was racking up record profits, hiring new brokers and 
analysts, promising huge bonuses. Then the global economy fell apart 
and now Wall Street is reeling. There's a lot of people worried about 
their jobs. They're worried because profits are plunging. Last year, 
Merrill Lynch made a profit of more than $500 million in July, August, 
and September. This year in those same three months, Merrill Lynch 
lost $164 million. And it's stock price plunged om $109 a share all 
the way down to $42. Does trouble on Wall Street mean problems down 
the road for main street? It certainly does in New York. An early 
casualty, the booming real estate market. Prices for the most expensive 
apartments cut by 10%. Those prices are being cut simply because Wall 
Street's not doing well. Wall Streeters get a big part of their income 
from year-end bonuses and this year they're expected to be slashed 
by as much as 25% -- $3 billion. Brokerage house employees, whose 
paychecks average more than $170,000 a year, are already cutting back. 
In what they buy at fancy stores, on $90 theater tickets on Broadway, 
and on $75 meals at expensive restaurants. We are reducing our dinner 
price by 20% in one of our dining rooms. Should other businesses be 
worried around the country about widespread layoffs? So far most experts 
say no, not unless there's a recession and that depends on whether 
the turmoil overseas can be contained.
