A former code-breaking analyst at the top-secret National Security 
Agency was charged Tuesday with spying for Moscow for the last three 
years of the Soviet Union's existence. David Sheldon Boone, a 46-year-old 
former enlisted man who worked for both Army intelligence and the 
NSA during his 21-year Army career, was arrested by FBI agents on 
Saturday at an airport hotel outside Washington, and made an initial 
appearance Tuesday in federal District Court in Alexandria, Va. The 
government charged that from 1988 until 1991, Boone passed top secret 
documents to a KGB officer he knew as ``Igor,'' revealing, among other 
things, what the United States knew about the capabilities of Soviet 
tactical nuclear weapons. In return, he was paid more than $60,000 
by the KGB, the government said. Boone was arrested after he was lured 
back to the United States from Germany by FBI agents posing as Russian 
spies. Through an intermediary who met Boone in London, the FBI had 
convinced him that Moscow wanted him to resume his espionage career. 
Boone fell for the FBI's favorite method of trapping inactive Cold 
War spies who now find themselves on the wrong side of history, the 
government said. Since the Soviet collapse in 1991, most FBI investigations 
of Moscow's old spies have been prompted by leads provided by Russian 
defectors or informants in Russia. That information is almost never 
enough to make an arrest, so the bureau often sets up a sting in which 
agents pose as Russians renewing old contacts. They then get the suspect 
to explain exactly what he did for Moscow in the old days. The affidavit 
said Boone, a native of Flint, Mich., joined the Army in 1970, and 
was trained in code-breaking and so-called ``signals intelligence,'' 
which means eavesdropping on enemy communications and then analyzing 
the data. He worked in an Army intelligence station in Augsburg, Germany, 
as well as at NSA headquarters at Fort Meade, Md. But in 1988, the 
affidavit said, after 18 years in a series of highly sensitive posts 
in the Army, Boone's life began to unravel. His marriage broke up 
and his wife gained custody of their children, while he became mired 
in debt and increasingly angry that so much of his Army pay was going 
to his wife. Just before his transfer from NSA headquarters back to 
Augsburg in 1988, Boone walked into the Soviet Embassy in Washington, 
showed officials there his Fort Meade and Army photo badges, and turned 
over a classified document in return for $300, the government affidavit 
said. In Germany, he began meeting four times a year with his KGB 
handler, ``Igor.'' He handed over secrets at bargain basement prices, 
including one document he later described to the FBI as revealing 
``the targeting of U.S. nuclear weapons against Soviet targets.'' 
He received just $5,000 to $7,000 from Igor at each meeting, according 
to the affidavit. But a 1990 security investigation had disclosed 
to the Army his new relationship with a German woman and his mounting 
debts, the affidavit said. His job evaluations had declined, and so 
his access to classified information was suspended. He retired from 
the Army the next year, just as the Soviet Union was collapsing. Moscow 
seemed to lose interest in Boone. When the FBI caught up with him, 
he was remarried and living in Germany, where he had been working 
at a succession of computer-related jobs.
