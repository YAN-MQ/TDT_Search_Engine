The self-proclaimed messenger to the virgin Mary says today's appearance 
in Conyers, Georgia is her last. An estimated 100,000 people came 
to Nancy fowler's farm to hear her convey messages she says she has 
received from the virgin Mary. Fowler says she has received hundreds 
of visions from the virgin Mary over the years. My dear children, 
I have come to be with you today and as your loving mother, to instruct 
you. Children, please live your life in full union with God.
