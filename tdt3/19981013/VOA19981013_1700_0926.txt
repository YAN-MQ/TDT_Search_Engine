And unrest in Sri Lanka has resulted in Sri Lankan police and the 
army joining forces in an operation to arrest the deserters. Reporter 
Vandanna Chopra in Colombo says they cast a wide net, scooping up 
more than 2,000 people. The military spokesperson says within a few 
days following an operation to apprehend security service deserters, 
more than 2,100 people have been arrested. Army officials say stringent 
action will be taken against those institutions which harbor or provide 
employment to deserters. The government information department said 
in a statement the incidence of theft crimes and looting has increased 
as a result of such people who are trained and armed being at large. 
About 15,000 soldiers are listed as deserters. Last May, 13,000 deserters 
were arrested or returned during a government amnesty. Military officials 
say various campaigns to attract new soldiers have met with a poor 
response. The military says it needs more recruits to fight Tamil 
Tiger rebels. Hundreds of soldiers are reported killed or missing 
after Tiger rebels took control of the northern town of Kilinochchi, 
forcing government troops to retreat. The Tiger guerrillas have been 
fighting for autonomy for 15 years in Sri Lanka's north and east, 
where the minority Tamil community is concentrated. This is Vandanna 
Chopra for VOA News, Colombo.
