Despite the rush to implement the Kosovo accord, officials admitted 
Tuesday it could take weeks before the full complement of 2,000 international 
observers is in place to make sure Slobodan Milosevic lives up to 
the agreement. Milosevic's acceptance of the ``verification mission'' 
-- both NATO aerial reconnaissance flights and the monitors on the 
ground -- was a key concession in talks between the Yugoslav president 
and U.S. envoy Richard Holbrooke to defuse the Kosovo crisis and avoid 
NATO airstrikes. ``They are not monitors, not observers,'' Holbrooke 
insisted Tuesday in the Yugoslav capital Belgrade. ``They are compliance 
verifiers. They will be stationed with the Yugoslav government's full 
support ... security guarantees and freedom of movement.'' President 
Clinton also underscored the importance of the mission, saying ``we 
will not rely on what President Milosevic says, but what he does for 
the whole world to see.'' He said allowing the international inspectors' 
unfettered access _ including unrestricted surveillance by NATO aircraft 
-- was a test Milosevic must pass in the next four days to avoid strikes. 
But the Vienna-based Organization for Security and Cooperation in 
Europe, which is responsible for the ground component, lacks a large 
permanent staff. It will have to turn to its 54 member states, including 
the United States, Russia, Canada and European Union countries, to 
provide people with the necessary training and skills. ``We are still 
in the very early planning stage,'' OSCE spokesman Mons Nyberg said. 
``Over the coming weeks, we hope to see the mission fully activated 
down there.'' The current chairman of the OSCE, Polish Foreignm Minister 
Bronislaw Geremek, said he was expecting formal offers from contributing 
countries next week. Geremek, speaking to reporters in Stockholm, 
Sweden, noted that the Kosovo operation will be the largest ever undertaken 
by the organization. ``It's a question of the future of the OSCE,'' 
he said. ``It will give proof that the OSCE has a place in the international 
structures.'' As a stopgap measure, OSCE officials plan to use the 
Kosovo Diplomatic Observer Mission, which was activated July 6 under 
arrangement worked out between Milosevic and Russian President Boris 
Yeltsin. For four months, members of the mission -- Americans, Canadians, 
Russians and Western Europeans -- have been traveling around Kosovo, 
providing their governments with first-hand reports on the fighting 
and the suffering of the nearly 300,000 refugees driven from their 
homes. But the diplomatic mission numbered only about 50 people. They 
were all evacuated this week to neighboring Macedonia, largely because 
of fears of reprisals by angry Serbs if NATO launched air attacks. 
Under the agreement with Holbrooke, Milosevic promised to guarantee 
the safety of the verification mission. Meantime, representatives 
of the 54 OSCE member states will meet Thursday in Vienna to give 
their formal approval for the verification mission. Geremek will then 
fly to Belgrade to sign the agreement with Milosevic to establish 
the mission.
