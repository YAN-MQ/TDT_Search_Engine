A word of warning tonight from the consumer product safety commission 
-- check the fire sprinklers in your home. They could be among some 
10 million now being recalled by the federal government. Here's NBC's 
Robert Hager. For more than a decade they have been among the most 
widely installed fire sprinklers in America. But tonight, the government 
says they don't work and has forced the sprinkler's manufacturer to 
agree to a recall, a $40 million program to replace them. Sold under 
the brand name Omega, the sprinklers had been installed in the White 
House, the U.S. capitol, Washington's Smithsonian museum and across 
the country, in hundreds of thousands of homes, apartment buildings, 
schools, hospitals, prisons and other buildings. Ann brown, chairman 
of the government's consumer product safety commission -- They simply 
don't work. They don't activate in a fire. And if a fire sprinkler 
doesn't pour water on a fire, you know that people are in grave danger 
and don't even know it. a properly operating sprinkler is supposed 
to go off like this when exposed to the heat of a fire. But the government 
says in its tests, Omega sprinklers failed to go off 30% to 40% of 
the time. Government investigators say they know of at least 17 fires 
caused by Omega sprinklers that failed, including this huge one that 
raced through a boat yard near Pensacola, Florida. The government 
says the 17 cases it knows of resulted in more than $4 million damage 
and several injuries. A cook described one fire. You were able to 
look up and see the sprinklers still intact. They didn't work. They 
were just sitting there waiting for a fire. Some of these fires went 
back as far as 1990. So the company was not being forthright with 
us, although they knew about the fires in telling the commission about 
them. They initially argued the sprinklers were not defected but afreed 
to the recall because they want their customers to be sure of their 
products. There were more than 8 million of these Omega sprinklers 
installed. Now the company says it's prepared to replace all of them.
