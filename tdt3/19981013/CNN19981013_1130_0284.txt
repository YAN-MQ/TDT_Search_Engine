Mike Tyson is mentally and physically fit to return to the boxing 
ring. According to the associated press, that's the conclusion of 
a psychological report prepared for the Nevada athletic commission 
and released a short time ago. The report should bolster Tyson's chance 
of getting his boxing license back. The report says he has problems 
with self-esteem and depression. His license was rerescinded 15 months 
ago when Tyson bit off a chunk of Evander Holyfield's ear during a 
heavyweight title bout.
