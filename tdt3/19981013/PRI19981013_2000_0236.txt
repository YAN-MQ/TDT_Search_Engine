The FBI has begun to make its National DNA database available to state 
and local law enforcement officials. Police say it will enhance crime 
fighting, but some worry the database information could be misused. 
NPR's Eric Westervelt reports: Law enforcers say the National DNA 
database could cut down on the number of serious crimes including 
rape and violent assault by catching repeat offenders sooner. Matching 
DNA analysis with evidence left at a crime scene will allow police 
to cross check convicted criminals in every state. But civil libertarians 
are raising constitutional and privacy concerns. The FBI says the 
database will be limited to convicted felons. But Jim Dempsey with 
the Center for Democracy and Technology worries that that pool will 
expand. Let's keep it to convicts only. Let's limit the kind of information 
that is stored long term and before this is expanded, we really need 
to see a track record. FBI officials counter that there have been 
no known abuses of the database so far and they say they will be available 
only to trained and screened police experts. Eric Westervelt, NPR 
News, Philadelphia.
