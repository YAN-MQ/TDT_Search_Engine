The Braves are still alive after five. I'm Anthony Keith James, and 
this is "Headline Sports." Like a cat with nine lives, the Braves 
just won't die. Last night Atlanta rallied for a 7-6 win over San 
Diego in game five of the nlcs. Starter Kevin brown making a relief 
appearance trying to protect a 4-2 lead, but served up a three-run 
shot to Michael Tucker. Greg Maddux in relief picked up his first 
major league save. The padres' lead in the best of seven has been 
cut to 3-2.
