Protesters in southeastern Nigeria say they will continue to disrupt 
oil production operations in the region until their political demands 
are met by the government. And last week, demonstrations have shut 
down several production facilities, cutting Nigerian oil exports by 
25 percent. VOA's John Pitman reports from our West Africa bureau. 
The protesters have targeted the network of pipelines and pumping 
stations which allow oil companies to extract hundreds of thousands 
of barrels of crude oil a day from the earth beneath the Niger River 
delta. In a week of sit-ins and hostage-taking, protesters have shut 
down 15 flow stations and forced the country's largest foreign oil 
company, Shell, to reduce its output by more than 350,000 barrels 
a day. On Monday, the protesters warned they would continue their 
protest until their demands for greater political and economic autonomy 
are met by the government. This round of protests has been led by 
members of the Ijaw ethnic group. Earlier this year, the discovery 
of a large oil deposit on land shared by the Ijaw and Ilonje ethnic 
groups sparked a wave of inter-ethnic violence. Official reports say 
hundreds of civilians have been killed in the fighting. On Monday, 
a statement from the Ijaw leaders warned that foreign oil workers 
in the region could also be caught up in the violence. The statement 
said the safety of foreign workers could no longer be guaranteed. 
The Nigerian government, for its part, has released a statement saying 
it is concerned about developments in the southeast. The statement 
said the government is worried about the breakdown of law and order 
in the region. However, it remains unclear what steps the government 
may take to resolve or meet the protesters' demands. John Pitman,
