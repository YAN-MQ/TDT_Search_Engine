One is caught in a horrendous Catch-22 situation,'' is the way Prince 
Edward, the youngest of Queen Elizabeth's three sons, once described 
the overwrought burst of attention that greeted him here in 1993 when 
he announced that in a distinctly unroyal move he was starting his 
own film production company, Ardent Productions. ``If we devote all 
our time to public duties, we are criticized for being spongers,'' 
he said, speaking of his family. ``If we go off and do our own thing, 
they say we wouldn't be doing any business at all if we weren't who 
we were. It's a no-win situation, so it doesn't matter which side 
of the fence you jump off.'' Five years later, the 34-year-old prince 
(who calls himself Edward Windsor professionally) has begun to prove 
himself financially, if not always critically, with a series of lighthearted 
historical programs on royal-related subjects _ subjects that are 
embedded in his genes and close to his heart. And although competitors 
in Britain's television industry complain that he is shamelessly trading 
on his connections to advance his career (in a way, who would blame 
him?), he has managed to insure new-found respect for Ardent by crossing 
the all-important continental divide and selling a number of his programs 
to the United States. The first of these, ``Crown and Country,'' which 
was shown in part last month and is being rebroadcast in an expanded 
format on Public Television in six 30-minute segments over the next 
five weeks (the first segment begins at 7 Sunday night, Oct. 18), 
is a whistle-stop tour, written and narrated by Windsor, of various 
English spots and their relationship to the monarchy. Among other 
things, viewers get an insiders' tour of Windsor Castle from the prince, 
who more or less grew up in the castle and thus gains access to places 
``not usually attainable by the public,'' according to Public Television 
press releases. They are taken through Winchester, England's ancient 
capital (and, according to legend, the original home of King Arthur), 
and told the story of King Edmund the martyr, in a segment on St. 
Edmundsbury, where he lived. Next month (Nov. 1 at 8 p.m.), the Learning 
Channel is to broadcast another Windsor effort, ``Tales From the Tower,'' 
a three-hour encapsulation of hundreds of years of history at the 
Tower of London that takes in the stories of Guy Fawkes, Richard III 
and Rudolf Hess, among countless others. The three-part program is 
presented as ``drama documentary,'' Windsor said, meaning that the 
narrative is enlivened by the presence of nontalking actors in period 
costume who enact some of the scenes, while a narrator (Samuel West, 
rather than Windsor himself) describes the action. Windsor, who studied 
history at Cambridge, brings an amateur's enthusiasm to the research 
involved (research that doesn't always bear out, unfortunately: the 
review tape of the first episode of ``Tales From the Tower'' identifies 
Ann Boleyn, Henry VIII's second wife, as his third wife). He loved, 
he says, the chance to travel around the country as a regular person, 
delving into the nooks and crannies of its history. ``In all these 
programs, we're trying to find a balance between presenting the history 
and making it entertaining,'' Windsor said recently, interviewed in 
his handsome office at Ardent, in a converted stable on the 87-acre 
estate in Surrey that he is currently refurbishing as his principal 
residence (he also gets a rent-free apartment in Buckingham Palace). 
``To me, it's the stories _ not the camera angles or the technical 
tricks or trying to be frightfully with-it in the way it's filmed 
_ that make it entertaining. We don't want something that's frightfully 
dry, that's like a history lecture.'' Windsor is such a familiar figure 
in a country obsessed with royalty that it's impossible to forget, 
when talking to him, that he is, in fact, a prince (even if you did 
forget it, his signet ring, stamped with a crown over the initial 
E, would be a dead giveaway). But as the third son (he is seventh 
in line for the throne), he has an eager-to-please ease of manner 
that would not be associated with, say, Prince Charles, his eldest 
brother and the heir to the throne. His work has not been particularly 
well received in Britain, where he is sometimes cheekily referred 
to as ``the Edward formerly known as prince.'' The Evening Standard, 
for instance, said that ``Crown and Country'' was ``cheesy and pompous'' 
and too reverential toward the monarchy. The Guardian, however, took 
a more forgiving view. ``Edward cut a surprisingly telegenic figure: 
relaxed, informal, handsome even,'' the paper wrote. ``His intellectual 
credentials may have been overstated, but the series was a success.'' 
Mean comments about his work, Edward says with an insouciant shrug, 
are par for the course. In Britain, he told a group of television 
reporters recently, ``If you've got a title, than you also don't have 
any brains.'' (The British news media were not amused by his mini-rant, 
calling him ``the prince of petulance.'') In truth, Edward does seem 
to spend a depressingly large percentage of his time trying to prove 
that he is not a chinless royal dolt playing at having a job. ``People's 
perceptions of these things are very strange,'' he said, describing 
what it means to compete as a royal in a nonroyal world. ``It takes 
a very, very long time to shift people's minds and how they generate 
these perceptions. And by continuing to perpetuate these stereotypes, 
the news media doesn't help.'' He continued, speaking of Britain: 
``There's probably more baggage here, more age-old perceptions here. 
It's possible to be able to get a foot in the door but then you have 
a much deeper climb. If one of the stations is going to commission 
you to do a program, than Ardent has got to be 10 times better than 
anyone else.'' His public relations campaign has not been helped by 
the fact that early on, he announced that he didn't plan to produce 
a ``rush of royal programs.'' It is a remark that has come to haunt 
him. After racking up nearly $2 million in losses in its first three 
years, Ardent began moving increasingly toward royal programs, programs 
that depend explicitly on the producer's impeccable connections. These 
include a documentary on the 1992 fire and subsequent restoration 
of Windsor Castle, which used special footage from the Royal Collection, 
free of charge, and a film called ``Edward on Edward,'' in which Windsor 
examined the strange and sad life of his uncle, King Edward VII, who 
abdicated and lived the rest of his life as the Duke of Windsor. Windsor 
rejects the notion that he has become the in-house filmmaker for the 
royal family, pointing out that Ardent has made a number of nonroyal 
programs, including a drama, ``The Cater Street Hangman,'' based on 
a Victorian murder mystery by the novelist Anne Perry (to be shown 
on A&AMP;E in December). ``It's more balanced than it seems,'' he 
said, ``but the royal programs are the ones that attract the press 
and publicity.'' At the same time, he acknowledged, he does bring 
a singular perspective to the subject. ``The nation measures its life 
in terms of reigns, and the kings and queens provide the thread that 
runs through history,'' he said of his ancestors. ``What I want to 
do is to no longer see them just as extraordinary people in terms 
of history but to see them as real people, often thrown together by 
a twist of fate into extraordinary circumstances. Some are very good 
at it, some are dreadful, and the majority just get by. At the heart, 
they're ordinary people.''
