"Living longer, living better" tonight. As folks grow older they're 
understandably anxious about losing the freedoms they enjoyed in their 
younger years, and one of the most important is the freedom to drive 
their own vehicle. We know we've heard from a lot of seniors on this 
subject. Well, tonight, some good news. The automotive business is 
beginning to think about this, as well. NBC's Anne Thompson. 24-year-old 
Patrick Garrett dresses for work. He puts on knee braces, elbow pads, 
gloves and glasses. All this so the young Ford engineer can understand 
the problems older drivers encounter behind the wheel. Even reaching 
back with my right hand to grab the belt is pretty difficult because 
your arm doesn't bend and it's tough to turn. Ford puts its engineers 
and designers in this special suit so they can experience the effects 
of aging 30 years. The glasses mimic cataracts, creating glare, making 
it hard to see the controls. Wrist restrictors simulate stiffness 
and arthritis footpads slow reflexes on the brake pedal. What we really 
try to do is understand what the fundamental needs are and then work 
with our engineers and designers to come up with as creative way as 
possible of meeting those needs. There are more than 59 million drivers 
over 50 and they make up 40% of the new car buyers. And their numbers 
are growing. That's why automakers are starting to pay attention to 
these consumers. Ford recently redesigned the radios in the Lincoln 
town car and Mercury grand Marquis, making knobs and displays bigger 
adding thicker door handles, easier for older hands to grab, making 
latches for the trunk and gas tank more accessible. But if you don't 
have a new model, you can learn to adapt as you age. Jim wall is one 
of 600,000 Americans each year who take what's called the "55 alive" 
class sponsored by the American association of retired persons. Little 
things like hearing and not being able to see as well at night are 
the important changes I've noticed about me. The class teaches you 
how to respond to those changes, to keep more distance between you 
and other cars. And if you take the classes, you can get discounts 
on insurance premiums in 34 states and the district of Columbia. To 
know what steps to protect yourself, researchers have come up with 
a new test to measure your ability to see the road. And coming soon, 
new designs like glare-reduce ing windshields, and improved 1/2 gags 
systems. To help older drivers stay behind the wheel, "living longer, 
living better." Anne Thompson, NBC news, Chicago.
