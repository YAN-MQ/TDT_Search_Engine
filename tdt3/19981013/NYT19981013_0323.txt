Stock prices fell Tuesday as the flow of third-quarter corporate earnings 
reports began to intensify. Many companies have prepared investors 
with preannouncements about a slide in profits, but investors showed 
Tuesday that they were looking at more than just the bottom line. 
Shares of Eastman Kodak were pounded after the company reported a 
10 percent drop in revenues, due largely to a decline in sales to 
consumers in emerging markets like Russia and China. Even though revenues 
sagged, Kodak's net income figures beat analysts' expectations, due 
in part to cost reductions. That sort of report might have cheered 
Wall Street at other times, but these are not other times. ``People 
are suspicious when companies can't pull out top-line growth,'' said 
Henry Herrmann, chief investment officer at Waddell &AMP; Reed, a 
mutual fund company in Overland Park, Kan., with $26 billion in assets 
under management. Kodak's stock fell by 11 3/16, or 13 percent, to 
72 3/8. That result was responsible for 73 percent, or 46.1 points, 
of a 63.33 point decline in the Dow Jones industrial average, which 
closed at 7,938.14. It also contributed to a much smaller 2.91 point 
fall in the broader Standard &AMP; Poor's 500-stock index, which closed 
at 994.80. ``Two or three years ago, if a company showed improving 
earnings growth through lower costs, the market rejoiced,'' said A. 
Marshall Acuff, an equity strategist at Salomon Smith Barney. ``Now 
the market senses that the world economy is slowing down, and is focused 
on growth in the top line, as well as on profits. Kodak gave the market 
a kind of smack in the face.'' Sagging computer share prices dragged 
down the Nasdaq composite index, which fell 36.63 points, or 2.37 
percent, to 1,509.45. Monsanto was another big contributor to the 
decline in the Standard &AMP; Poor's 500 index. Shares of Monsanto 
fell 13 3/8, or 26.55 percent, to 37, after it said its proposed $35 
billion merger with American Home Products had been canceled. American 
Home Products fell 5, to 45. Nasdaq stocks were dragged down by computer 
companies like Dell Computer, which lost 3 1/16, to 53. Not every 
company that reported earnings Tuesday saw its stock price head lower. 
Johnson &AMP; Johnson rose 1 5/16, to 77 3/4, after a solid earnings 
report. And Merrill Lynch, which has been clobbered in recent weeks, 
rose 1 1/16, to 44 15/16, after it reported a net loss of $164 million 
and said it would lay off 3,400 employees. ``It is hard to imagine 
things getting a lot worse in the financial sector,'' Bob Gasser, 
head of block trading at J.P. Morgan &AMP; Co., said. Some market 
analysts, a group that includes Acuff at Salomon Smith Barney, said 
conditions have improved over the last week or so, and that the Dow 
is not likely to successfully test its Aug. 31 low. But Herrmann said 
he could be happier. ``We have been doing some buying, especially 
in small capitalization stocks, but nothing wholesale,'' he said. 
To feel better, Herrmann said he would like to see long-term bond 
yields rise above short-term interest rates. ``That would allow the 
banking sector to reliquify itself by extending credit rather than 
just holding bonds,'' he said. ``I would also like to get a sense 
that the hedge fund world, which includes big money center banks, 
has finished unwinding its money-losing trades.'' But even those accomplishments 
would not do much to help corporate earnings. ``No matter what we 
do there is going to be material pressure'' on earnings, he said. 
``There is such an incredible excess of supply that companies don't 
have any pricing power. It will take us a while to work through that.''
