Several countries under U.N. or U.S. sanctions or both have signed 
up to speak Wednesday at the General Assembly's seventh straight non-binding 
vote to urge an end to the U.S. embargo on Cuba. The Cuba-sponsored 
resolution is expected to pass with a large margin, as it has in past 
years. Iraq, Libya, Myanmar and Cuba itself _ represented by Foreign 
Minister Roberto Robaina _ are on the speakers' list, as well as countries 
such as Vietnam, which were once under U.S. sanctions. Austria is 
also expected to address the 185-member assembly on behalf of the 
European Union, which has criticized the nearly 4-decade-old U.S. 
embargo and 1996 U.S. legislation that tightened it by punishing foreign 
companies that invest in property confiscated from Americans after 
the 1959 revolution. European nations believe the law violates World 
Trade Organization rules governing international trade and infringes 
on their sovereignty. Last year, 143 U.N. member states voted in favor 
of the resolution which calls for the United States to lift the embargo. 
Seventeen states abstained. Only Israel and the former Soviet republic 
of Uzbekistan voted with the United States against the resolution, 
which is non-binding, unlike those passed by the Security Council. 
In 1996, a similar resolution was approved 137-3 with 25 abstentions. 
U.N. sanctions have barred Iraq from selling its most crucial commodity, 
oil, on the open market since its 1990 invasion of Kuwait. U.N. sanctions 
that forbid air travel to and from Libya were imposed to force the 
country to turn over two suspects accused in the 1988 Pan Am bombing 
over Lockerbie, Scotland. The United States imposed economic and trade 
sanctions against Myanmar in April 1997, to punish it for its repression 
of democracy activists and alleged failure to curb heroin trafficking.
