Although high school girls have been catching up to boys in math and 
science achievement over the last six years, there is a serious gender 
gap in technology, according to the latest report on girls' education 
by the American Association of University Women Educational Foundation. 
The report, ``Gender Gaps: Where Schools Still Fail Our Children,'' 
found, for example, that in 1996 girls made up only 17 percent of 
the high school students who took that advanced placement computer 
science exam, about the same percentage as in the previous year. ``While 
there are more girls taking computer classes, they tend to be in data 
entry, while boys are more likely to take advanced computer applications 
that can lead them to careers in technology,'' said Janice Weinman, 
executive director of the association. ``And it's not just what courses 
they take,'' Ms. Weinman said. ``What we've learned through the studies 
is that girls feel much less comfortable with technology than boys, 
that they see computers primarily as a matter of word processing rather 
than as an opportunity for a different kind of problem solving.'' 
The association's 1992 report, ``How Schools Shortchange Girls,'' 
which found that girls were often ignored in the classroom and neglected 
in the curriculum, and generated a nationwide debate on gender equity 
in education. But that report also came under fire for its failure 
to address the overall cultural and educational issues that left boys 
receiving lower grades, dropping out of high school and underperforming 
girls in English, social studies and foreign languages. The new report 
rejects the view of boys as advantaged top performers and girls as 
victims who need to catch up. It argues that true gender equity would 
benefit all students, giving both sexes encouragement to excel in 
every subject area. Still, the report focuses mostly on girls' progress. 
For example, it found good news in girls' increased presence in advanced 
mathematics and science classes. In 1990, boys made up a higher percentage 
of pre-calculus, trigonometry, statistics and calculus classes, while 
in 1994 there was an equal, or higher, percentage of girls in all 
those classes except calculus; and even in calculus, the gap had narrowed. 
In science, girls are predominant in every subject except physics, 
and that gap, too, is narrowing. But it does little to resolve a basic 
conundrum in the debate about gender equity. Even in areas where girls 
historically outperform boys, they tend to get lower scores on standardized 
tests like the Advanced Placement Exams, Scholastic Assessment Tests 
and Preliminary Scholastic Assessment Tests, which play a large role 
in determining merit scholarships and college entrance. Generally, 
the report found, boys do better on multiple-choice questions and 
girls on essays. And, with the addition of an essay question on the 
PSAT in 1997, girls' overall score was just 2.7 points lower than 
that of boys, compared to a gap of 4.5 points the previous year. ``Now 
that we see what the writing sample does on the PSAT, I think that 
clearly needs to be addressed on the SAT,'' Ms. Weinman said.
