Ford Motor Co. announced plans Tuesday for mass production of a new, 
gearless car transmission to be produced in a joint venture that could 
also become a new model for labor relations in the auto industry. 
The new transmission, which uses a system of pulleys instead of gears, 
allowing many subtle gradations of power to speed, improves fuel economy 
by 10 percent to 15 percent, Ford said. Large-scale installation of 
the new transmission would help Ford meet federal fuel-economy regulations 
in the United States and compete in foreign markets where gas prices 
are high and fuel economy is important to car buyers. Ford said that 
it would form the joint venture with ZF Friedrichshafen AG of Germany, 
which had patented a design for a so-called continuously variable 
automatic transmission. Ford will own 49 percent of the venture and 
ZF will own 51 percent. The two companies said they would begin installing 
the transmissions in 2001 model-year cars and would install a million 
of the new transmissions annually by 2005 at a Ford transmission factory 
in Ohio. The transmissions would be installed mainly in small Ford 
cars in the United States and abroad. But Ford also planned to sell 
some to other automakers overseas, said Jacques Nasser, the president 
of Ford's worldwide automotive operations, who will become Ford's 
chief executive at the end of the year. Ford's choice of a joint venture 
to build the new transmissions also opened the door for it to make 
the first use of an unusual provision in all of the Big Three's labor 
contracts since 1996. The provision allowed the automakers to pay 
lower wages in any new auto parts businesses that they enter through 
joint ventures. Nasser said that all current employees at the company's 
transmission factory in Batavia, Ohio, would remain Ford employees. 
But any future hires would be employees of the new joint venture, 
and Ford would eventually like to have a separate labor agreement 
at the factory, he told reporters Tuesday.
