Investigators in laramie, Wyoming, say the fatal beating of a gay 
college student wasn't a hate crime. A sheriff's department spokesman 
says there were multiple motives in the killing of Matthew shepard. 
Shepard died yesterday, five days after he was pistol whipped and 
lashed to a fence post. The attack has sparked national outrage and 
renewed calls for hate crime laws. The charges against the two men 
accused of killing shepard have been upgraded to first-degree murder. 
Authorities say Aaron McKinney and Russell Henderson were arraigned 
last night.
