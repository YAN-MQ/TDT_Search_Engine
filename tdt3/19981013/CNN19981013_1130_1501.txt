Bake-offs and cooking contests are also a big part American culture. 
Some eager contestants recently took part in the "Baker of the year" 
contest. But these wanna-be cooks are barely out of elementary school 
and the ovens they used weren't exactly high-tech. Jeanne Moos reports. 
There they were, taking a stab at the title Baker of the year on their 
easy bake ovens. But sometimes baking ain't so easy. Whoops. Though 
it's amazing what you can whip up in an oven heated by nothing more 
than a 100-Watt bulb. I've never had to replace a light bulb. Maybe 
that's the secret to scrumptious orange nut cake. Hope the baking 
is better than the spelling. Well, the body parts need ten minutes. 
Not those kind of body parts. These aren't serial killers, they're 
serial bakers. I'm a better Baker at desserts. Better than your mother? 
Better desserts than mommy? Do I have to admit it? Five finalists, 
four girls and a boy, gathered in New York for the bake-off, their 
written recipes chosen from hundreds submitted. I don't need to look 
at that at all. Chopped pecans are next? no, no. Hey, even on an easy 
bake some of us are half-baked. Are you trying to say is this batter? 
'cause it isn't. What is it? Topping mix. Remember the old jingle? 
I like to lick the batter. I like to watch it bake. Well, here, you're 
likely to get battered for asking to lick the batter. Can I lick the 
bowl when you're done? No, 'cause I'm gonna have to use it again. 
Can I have more? Sure. You don't sound like you mean it. This is the 
35th anniversary of the easy bake oven. Remember when ovens were avocado? 
From 1963 to 1998, and the easy bake is still cooking in popular culture. 
A bb gun or an easy bake oven? hmm. Hot food is tempting, but I just 
can't say no to a weapon. Given the same choice, our finalists split 
along gender lines. Easy bake oven. Bb gun. What do you want to be 
when you grow up? Football player. Then when I get a reputation, open 
my own restaurant, then go back to school to become an astronaut. 
Not so easy to bake up there. The judges poked, prodded and tasted. 
Baker of the year, Lindsey Thompson, Little Rock, Arkansas. When it 
got down to the last two, I was like uh-oh. Lindsey won the $5,000 
prize with her toffee trifle cake -- so sweet even she can't eat a 
whole piece. As for the easy bake, one thing hasn't changed. Light 
bulb not included. Jeanne Moos, CNN, New York.
