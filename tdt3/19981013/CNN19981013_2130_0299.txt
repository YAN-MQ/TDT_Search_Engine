Emergency crews are searching for survivors of an explosion at a fireworks 
factory outside Mexico city today. It destroyed several city blocks. 
Killing at least ten people. At least 50 more are hurt or missing. 
A red cross official says the main explosion probably set off a chain 
reaction among dozens of illegal makeshift factories in the area.
