Acting Prime Minister Romano Prodi said Tuesday night that he would 
try to form a government, four days after he was ousted after narrowly 
losing a confidence vote. Prodi, who was offered a second chance by 
President Oscar Luigi Scalfaro, must now cobble together a majority 
in Parliament. He called that process ``delicate.'' He will most likely 
seek to form an alliance with a small center-right party to make up 
for Communist votes that split away last week, causing him to lose 
the confidence vote. The center-left majority that brought him to 
power in 1996 splintered after a hard-line Communist leader withdrew 
his party's support over the 1999 budget and unemployment policy. 
That defection split the Communist ranks, as the more moderate wing 
left to form its own party, unwilling to be held responsible for defeating 
a leftist government. But their votes are not enough to give Prodi 
a majority in Parliament. A formal union between Prodi and the center-right 
party of Francesco Cossiga, which is in the opposition, will require 
highly delicate maneuvering by both men. Prodi has often said he will 
govern only with the majority that elected him two and a half years 
ago _ and he repeated it most vehemently the day after his defeat. 
On Tuesday, he said that he would govern only if allowed to pursue 
the same policies he espoused in his first incarnation as prime minister. 
``The possibility of forming a new executive will depend on the possibility 
of keeping to the program presented to the electorate,'' Prodi said 
after his meeting with Scalfaro. ``I will get down to work immediately.'' 
While the onetime center-right allies of Cossiga mocked his sudden 
shift of allegiance, he sought to paint his support for a new Prodi 
government as a patriotic sacrifice. Italy, Cossiga warned, cannot 
afford to be without an authoritative government just when it is preparing 
to enter the single European currency. ``The consequences on internal 
markets, on our economy and on our international image will be gravely 
affected if we find it impossible to pass a budget,'' he said. While 
budget disputes pushed Prodi's government over the brink, widespread 
concern that the budget might not be approved in time to meet the 
Jan. 1 start date of the European currency has helped push Prodi back 
to the brink of being in office. The Italian central bank has said 
that it will not cut lending rates _ a requirement for membership 
in the European currency _ until Italy has a budget that includes 
$9 billion in spending cuts. Some political leaders have said they 
want Prodi to return to power long enough to pass the budget, then 
face another confidence vote. Even if Prodi does not formally agree 
to that condition, there is little question that the stability his 
government had come to represent _ it was the second-longest in Italy 
since World War II _ has been badly weakened. Even many Italians unenamored 
of Prodi, a low-key former economist, have expressed concern about 
a return of the chronic instability that marked Italian politics for 
decades. If Prodi manages to succeed himself in office, that victory 
could nevertheless be clouded by memories of past revolving-door governments.
