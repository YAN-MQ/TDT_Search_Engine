Well, finally, a South Korean company owned by the Unification Church 
whose followers are known as the moonies says it struck a deal with 
North Korea to build a luxury tourist resort for foreigners there. 
The company, The Tong Hill Group says it is to set up a hotel and 
ski resort in the tourist zone on Mt. Kum Yang. It is the second South 
Korean firm to make such a deal with North Korea, which is suffering 
a severe famine and is short of foreign currency. That's our look 
at global business this Tuesday for The World. I'm Richard Griffis 
in New York.
