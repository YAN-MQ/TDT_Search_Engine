I've never quite understood the term ``beer drinker.'' Does it mean 
someone who drinks only beer, or can you qualify if you also drink 
water, wine, coffee, tea and milk? And more, is there another, new 
category, the boutique-only beer drinker? Michael Jackson's book ``Ultimate 
Beer'' (DK Publishing, $29.95) should appeal to all three types. Jackson, 
an engaging British writer, has already established himself as a _ 
perhaps THE _ hops authority, through a number of books and television 
programs. Burly and bearded, he has an enthusiasm that is infectious; 
one would follow him into a pub or tavern anywhere. Another in the 
large-format, visually stunning Dorling Kindersley series of food 
and beverage books, ``Ultimate Beer'' is chock full of almost-life-size 
color photographs of beers from around the world, and text that is 
equally cosmopolitan. The author gives brew-by-brew descriptions of 
hundreds of beers by aroma, flavor and finish _ ``look, swirl, sniff, 
sip'' _ not just as something to order bellied up to a bar, but as 
a beverage to match with food. His descriptions are so vivid I can 
understand how well La Choulette _ a light, spicy beer made in Northern 
France _ would go with lamb, or how pleasant it would be to wind up 
a cold winter's night with a nightcap of Old Knucklehead, a barley 
wine-style ale from the Pacific Northwest. There are beers for almost 
every food and each season, Jackson contends. Now in his mid-50s, 
he has spent years pursuing the perfect match. The current book includes 
an intriguing section on cooking with beer. In the way that recipes 
often specify a particular wine, Jackson's recipes call for a particular 
type of beer. And just as one might use burgundy in a red-wine stew 
from that region, Jackson often matches foods and beers by geography. 
A ham basted with dark lager, for instance, calls for a rich, malty 
dark lager in the German dunkel or schwarzbier style. (In a basting 
liquid of dark lager, the malt sugars caramelize, creating a crust 
and sweet flavor.) A fruitcake recipe calls for a spicy dark beer, 
which contributes both moisture and flavor. One for mussels in India 
pale ale steams the mussels in a dry, savory and acidic brew from 
a shellfish region, the Pacific Northwest. And a recipe for dark-chocolate 
truffles with an equally dark rich porter should convince any doubters. 
Chocolate and beer? It's astoundingly good. The author's close attention 
to complementary flavors not only is intriguing, but also makes a 
big difference in the final result. (Don't bother trying the truffles 
with a lightweight American lager, as I did.) Jackson, incidentally, 
seems to enjoy cooking as much as he does drinking. Instead of joining 
him at a pub, maybe you'd rather follow him home around supper time. 
MUSSELS IN INDIA PALE ALE Adapted from ``Ultimate Beer'' by Michael 
Jackson Time: 15 minutes 4 pounds mussels, cleaned 5 tablespoons butter 
1 clove garlic, peeled and crushed 2 medium-size red onions, finely 
chopped 1 teaspoon fresh thyme 1 1/3 cups India pale ale 3 tablespoons 
chopped flat-leaf parsley Pinch of salt Pinch of sugar Freshly ground 
black pepper French bread, for serving. 1. Buy mussels cleaned if 
possible; if not, scrub and rinse them thoroughly and pull off any 
barnacles and ``beardy'' attachments. Make sure mussels are closed. 
2. In a large heavy pot, melt butter and, over medium heat, cook garlic 
and onions until soft, about 5 minutes. Add the thyme, a cup of the 
ale, a third of the parsley, a pinch of salt and sugar, and some grinds 
of pepper. Add mussels, and simmer for 10 minutes or less, until the 
mussels half open. Remove mussels with a slotted spoon and set aside. 
Strain the broth through a sieve, and return strained broth and mussels 
to the pan. Add the rest of the ale, and cook a minute longer, until 
mussels are fully open. Scoop out mussels with the slotted spoon, 
and keep warm. 3. Add the rest of the parsley to the liquid in the 
pan. Reduce just a little, then pour the liquid over mussels. Serve 
in individual soup bowls with plenty of French bread. Yield: 4 servings.
