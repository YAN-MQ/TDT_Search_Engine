Here is an easy question. Are you fed up with daily traffic grind? 
Well, if you thought road rage was a problem on your commute, try 
getting through traffic in today's geography quiz. It's bumper to 
bumper and spoke to spoke. See, instead of the usual parade of cars, 
semis, and utility vehicles, here you have thousands of rickshaws, 
ringing their bells, as they fight their way through the crowded streets. 
The cycle rickshaw is the mode of transport in this Bangladeshi capital. 
Estimates are that there are about 100,000 of them, unofficially. 
The number though, is much higher. Known as baby taxis, the many rickshaws 
are a sight for sore eyes, often decorated in rainbow colors and covered 
in decals. Hire a cycle rickshaw for the day if you are interested 
in seeing some of the city's notable sights including its premier 
attraction, Lalbag Fort. An unfinished fort dating from 1678. So, 
what is the name of this rickshaw capital of the world? Stay tuned, 
and we will give you the answer in just a minute.
