In one of his sharpest attacks yet on Sen. Alfonse D'Amato's ethics, 
Rep. Charles Schumer, the Democratic nominee for the Senate, accused 
his opponent Tuesday of ``lining his pockets'' with $390,000 in speaking 
fees from large corporations and other special-interest groups that 
had legislation pending before Congress between 1981 and 1991. The 
assertion represented a new line of attack for Schumer and came as 
he appeared on the defensive from D'Amato's accusations that he had 
become a ``part-time'' congressman who had missed 110 floor votes 
in the last year while campaigning in New York. D'Amato, a Republican 
seeking his fourth term, drummed on that theme again Tuesday morning 
in appearances on Staten Island with Staten Island Borough President 
Guy Molinari. ``You can't win a fight if you're not there,'' the senator 
said under drizzly skies near the South Beach boardwalk. Just an hour 
later, Schumer, speaking at a news conference in Washington, where 
he had returned Monday afternoon to cast votes as Congress rushed 
toward adjournment, said the $390,820 that D'Amato received in honorariums 
from tobacco, banking, insurance and other industry groups over 10 
years was ``not illegal, but it sure was wrong.'' ``The voters of 
New York should have somebody representing them who doesn't personally 
benefit from groups that they are legislating,'' said Schumer, adding 
that he has not accepted any honorariums during his 18 years in Congress. 
In 1991, Congress prohibited its members from keeping speaking fees 
after concerns were raised that special-interest groups were using 
paid speaking engagements to buy access in both houses. Between 1981 
and 1991, according to a list released by the Schumer campaign, D'Amato 
accepted $6,000 from the American Institute of Certified Public Accountants, 
$6,000 from the Federal National Mortgage Association, $6,000 from 
General Electric Co., $4,000 from Merrill Lynch, $3,000 from Metropolitan 
Life Insurance Co., $6,000 from the New York State Bankers Association, 
and $2,000 from U.S. Tobacco Co. During much of that time, D'Amato 
was a member of the Senate Banking Committee, which regulates banks, 
insurance companies and other finance companies. His annual Senate 
salary during that period rose from $69,900 in 1982 to $125,100 in 
1991. D'Amato did not dispute Schumer's figures but called his criticism 
``the act of a desperate man'' who was trying to deflect public attention 
from his poor attendance record in the House this year. Schumer's 
lifetime voting record is more than 90 percent. ``That was permissible,'' 
D'Amato said about the speaking fees. ``What you have here is someone 
who can't stand up to the fact that he has the worst attendance record 
in Congress from the New York delegation. Only five in the entire 
country have missed more votes. And now, in an act of desperation, 
he's trying to becloud the issue.'' Schumer's comments at his Washington 
news conference continued the rapid attack-counterattack rhythm of 
the contest _ which is considered one of the tightest Senate races 
in the nation _ and fit into his overall effort to portray D'Amato 
as untrustworthy. But his suggestions that D'Amato has personally 
profited from his elected office added a new dimension to the tactic. 
It also showed that Schumer, under fierce attack by D'Amato, was willing 
to embrace more fully a strategy he had seemed to be shying away from 
before. At the beginning of the campaign, Schumer said Democrats had 
erred by making D'Amato's ethics a central issue in the 1992 campaign. 
Since then, Schumer has retreated somewhat from that position, saying 
that ethics should be one part of a broader assault on D'Amato's 18-year 
Senate record. But until Tuesday, he had done little to suggest that 
D'Amato has used his office for personal gain. At events Tuesday at 
South Beach and a senior center on Staten Island, D'Amato and his 
allies said Schumer, who is from Brooklyn, would work against the 
interests of Staten Island residents. The borough has overwhelmingly 
voted for D'Amato in the past. ``If Chuck Schumer is elected to the 
Senate, whose side is he going to take?'' Molinari asked at the Giuseppe 
Mazzini Center. ``Ours? Or Brooklyn's? The answer is obvious.'' Molinari 
predicted that, if elected, Schumer would work against closing the 
Fresh Kills landfill, which handles Brooklyn garbage, and would try 
to end the one-way toll collection system at the Verrazano-Narrows 
Bridge. That system has reduced air pollution from idling vehicles 
on the Staten Island side, D'Amato said. Howard Wolfson, a spokesman 
for Schumer, said the congressman supports closing Fresh Kills but 
favors keeping the one-way tolls in place. Just hours after Molinari 
raised the specter of Brooklyn political power, a prominent Brooklyn 
community organization, the Bedford Stuyvesant Restoration Corp., 
gave D'Amato an award Tuesday night at its annual gala dinner at the 
New York Hilton Hotel. Rocky Mitchell, president of the corporation, 
a nonpartisan housing and economic development organization that was 
founded by Sen. Robert F. Kennedy in 1967, said D'Amato had played 
a pivotal role in assuring that the group's $800,000 in deposits at 
the Freedom National Bank in Harlem were fully insured by the federal 
government after the bank collapsed in 1990. D'Amato is also a member 
of the group's board, as is the state's Democratic senator, Daniel 
Patrick Moynihan.
