Marty Reisman hunkered down and inspected the table tennis net. Wearing 
a purple shirt, red pants and a Panama hat, he looked like a retiree 
going to the deli for a nosh. But the hundred-dollar bill he held 
in his hand made it clear he wasn't about to retire anywhere. He folded 
the bill and held it against the net to check its height. It had to 
be exact. The old man with the C-note was about to risk losing 100 
of them in a high-stakes table-tennis match in Hell's Kitchen on Saturday 
night. Scores of spectators lined up two rows deep to watch Reisman, 
68, play Jimmy Butler, a table-tennis champ in his 20s, in a $10,000 
challenge match. Reisman, a legendary player who has held 18 national 
and international titles, wanted to prove that the hard-rubber racquet 
he grew up with was superior to the spongy racquets that now dominate 
the sport. He was unshakable in his belief that he could beat ``the 
kid'' if both of them used the old-style racquets that emphasized 
skill rather than the sponge racquets that provide pingpong pyrotechnics. 
Saturday night's battle was a grudge match, and not just because he 
had lost $5,000 to Butler a few months before. He has carried a grudge 
against the sponge racquet since the 1952 world championship, when 
a Japanese player first trotted out the new racquet to beat him with 
razzle-dazzle. ``The match against Jimmy is the culmination, the peak 
game of all the bitter feelings that accumulated in me over the years,'' 
he said in a rapid, gravelly voice. ``To have the rug ripped out from 
under me was a very frustrating experience, to be reduced and swamped 
by a racquet.'' There is a bit of drama in this, which is typical. 
Reisman will tell you that he is known for bringing excitement to 
the game that he learned to play in parks and settlement houses on 
the Lower East Side. He discovered he had a natural gift for the game, 
which came in handy at first by earning him dimes and quarters. Later, 
the money got serious, as did he. He estimates that he has circled 
the globe three times in search of games. He and his onetime partner, 
Doug Cartland, even used to play at halftime shows for the Harlem 
Globetrotters. They used frying pans as racquets and beat out the 
notes to ``Mary Had a Little Lamb'' as they traded shots. The musicians' 
union objected and forced them to stop. The only racquet Reisman hates 
is the sponge kind. The hard rubber ones, he said, were an extension 
of a player's skill. The sponge racquets, in contrast, give a mechanical 
advantage that allows players who may be slow on their feet to slam 
and spin the ball. ``Before, there was a dialogue between two players, 
wherein a 6-year-old child could understand the dialogue between offense 
and defense,'' he said. ``Today a point is made or lost with an imperceptible 
twist of the wrist. For the most part, 90 percent of the time the 
game is ridiculous and 10 percent it's sublime because they can do 
some incredible things with the sponge. Sometimes.'' For Saturday 
night's match, Butler spotted Reisman 4 points in each 21-point game. 
Butler also agreed not to hide the ball or stamp the floor during 
his serves, common ploys in today's game. But while the serves were 
silent, Reisman was not. Soon into the match, he grew irritated at 
some spectators who clapped when he missed a shot. ``Let's not have 
any hysterics,'' he scolded them. ``It's unwarranted. It's a normal 
shot to me.'' When Butler missed and the crowd reluctantly clapped, 
Reisman nodded his head. He kept up the patter during the match, apologizing 
to Butler when he scored a point. Other times, he stole a few more 
seconds to recover his breath by pretending to be in a fog while looking 
for the ball. Between games, his wife, Yoshiko, acted like a cut man 
in his corner, busily patting down his face and arms and adjusting 
the cuffs on his pants. ``Drink,'' his friends urged him from the 
sidelines. ``Concentrate. Breathe.'' The game resumed, as Butler slammed 
a volley of orange blurs toward Reisman. He deftly returned them in 
a slow, graceful arc. But it was not enough. He lost the match in 
the fifth game of the third seven-game set. Afterward, he was $10,000 
poorer but still surrounded by friends. ``You played a nice game,'' 
one said. ``Take a little water. You're a little cold.'' ``Nah,'' 
Reisman replied. ``I'm ready to go again.'' ``This isn't sex,'' another 
friend reminded him. ``I'm not finished,'' Reisman insisted. ``I'm 
coming back here. One way or another, I'm coming back.''
