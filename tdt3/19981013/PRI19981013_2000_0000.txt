This is The World. A co-production of the BBC World Service, PRI and 
WGBH Boston. It's Tuesday, October 13. I'm Tony Kahn. Today, an agreement 
with Slobodan Milosevic that may end the Kosovo crisis. We'll hear 
from Pristina now where ethnic Albanians are skeptical from Brussels 
where NATO remains ready to act and from Belgrade where some Serbs 
think Milosevic has done it again. Many analysts expected Milosevic 
to do this. Which is shortly to make the situation insufferable, internationalize 
it, and then appear as the savior of the nation. That is what he is 
actually in the process of doing right now. - First, this news.
