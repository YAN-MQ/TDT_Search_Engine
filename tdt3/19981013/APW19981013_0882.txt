Leaders of the environmentalist Greens party on Tuesday warned against 
interpreting any Greens' votes against German participation in threatened 
NATO strikes against Yugoslavia as trouble for the future coalition. 
The likely junior partner in a new government led by Chancellor-elect 
Gerhard Schroeder officially supports Germany's role in any NATO strikes, 
but is urging its members to vote their conscience when parliament 
votes Friday. Greens spokesman Juergen Trittin said lawmakers will 
have to weigh the necessity of punishing Yugoslav President Slobodan 
Milosevic against the lack of a clear U.N. mandate for military action. 
``I don't think there will be any unified vote among the parliamentary 
factions representing the future government,'' Trittin said. With 
Schroeder's approval, Helmut Kohl's outgoing Cabinet on Monday approved 
deployment of 14 Tornado jet fighters to participate in threatened 
air strikes against Yugoslavia, if necessary. Milosevic signaled agreement 
Tuesday to terms avoiding air strikes _ including armed monitors and 
aerial surveillance of compliance. Defense Minister Volker Ruehe said 
the western allies' united position _ including the Cabinet's decision 
to send German soldiers _ was key to winning the agreement. As an 
additional signal, Ruehe on Tuesday ordered eight Tornado fighters 
based in Germany to Italy, where they will carry out normal exercises 
and be available should Milosevic fail to keep up terms of the deal. 
The German jets would be key to any NATO action, taking out sophisticated 
Yugoslav air defenses. Milosevic has four days to comply, a deadline 
that expires the same day the outgoing German parliament meets in 
special session to vote on deploying German fighters. Even if Greens 
lawmakers vote against the deployment, parliamentary approval seems 
assured because both major parties, the Social Democrats and Kohl's 
Christian Democrats, largely support committing German troops. Germany's 
role in any air strikes has been in question since the left's Sept. 
27 election victory. And the decision to have the sitting government 
to act allows the future governing partners to skirt a potentially 
divisive issue. Schroeder has emphasized that no matter how Greens 
lawmakers in the outgoing government vote, ``there are absolutely 
no doubts about the Greens' reliability in foreign policy.'' Both 
parties, he said, have agreed on continuity in foreign policy, including 
a commitment to NATO that the Greens have rejected in the past.
