Israel's prime minister says there is no chance of signing an interim 
peace deal with the Palestinians at this week's summit in the United 
States unless the Palestinians honor their security commitments. Benjamin 
Netanyahu's office made the statement after an Israeli man was shot 
to death and another was wounded west of Jerusalem. Israeli police 
believe the attackers were Palestinian.
