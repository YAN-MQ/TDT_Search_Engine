Peace talks aimed at ending Burundi's five-year civil war were to 
open Tuesday in northern Tanzania. Sonya Lawrence Green reports this 
is the third time Burundi's warring sides have sat down for talks, 
but analysts hold out little hope much progress will be made. This 
latest round of peace talks brings together Burundi's Tutsi-led government, 
Hutu rebel groups and the two major political parties, Fudebu and 
Duprona. Some radical factions on both sides of the spectrum have 
refused to attend, but all the major players are present for the talks 
in Arusha, Tanzania, mediated by former Tanzanian president Julius 
Nyerere. The main issue is tough -- how to end an ethnic conflict 
which has claimed over 150,000 lives in five years of fighting between 
the majority Hutus and minority Tutsis. The agenda for the talks will 
include debate about democracy and governance, inclusion of all groups 
in Burundi's power structure, as well as the nature of the conflict 
and discussions on genocide. Delegates have been holding separate 
informal talks with mediator Nyerere, who also met with special envoys 
from the European Union and the United States. But analysts do not 
foresee much progress at the talks, and even Burundi's president told 
Reuters New Agency he did not expect anything very spectacular. Though 
ethnic violence has a long history in Burundi, the latest crisis was 
sparked in October 1993, when Tutsi soldiers assassinated Hutu president 
Malchior Endedia. Hutus immediately embarked on reprisal killings. 
Tutsis fought back and eventually seized the government, installing 
former Tutsi president Pierre Buyoya back in office in July 1996. 
After that coup, regional leaders imposed strict travel and trade 
sanctions on Burundi in the hope of forcing its leaders to solve the 
crisis. But instead, the ethnic conflict has dragged on, and Burundi's 
economy has suffered a steep decline. Given the problems, Burundi's 
factions finally agreed to the current peace talks, which kicked off 
in June this year. A second round ended inconclusively in July. And 
this third round is expected to last two or three weeks. Sonya Lawrence
