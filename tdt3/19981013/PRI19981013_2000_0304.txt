Authorities in Laramie, Wyoming have formally charged two mean in 
the murder of a gay college student who died yesterday from the effects 
of a beating last week. Charges against Arthur Hendersen and Aaron 
McKinney were upgraded late yesterday and charges against their girlfriends 
were upgraded to accessory after-the-fact of first degree murder. 
Funeral services for the murdered men have been set for Friday, but 
they are already embroiled in controversy. A Kansas minister who frequently 
leads demonstrations against homosexuals has said he is planning a 
demonstration at the funeral of Mathew Sheppherd.
