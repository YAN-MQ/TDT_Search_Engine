In Washington, there's continued wrangling between the White House 
and Congress about the $500 billion spending Bill to keep the government 
running. Midnight tomorrow is the deadline and the sticking point 
between them has been big dollars for education. The question is why 
education and why now? ABC's Sam Donaldson is at the White House. 
sam? Peter, the president's eleventh hour battle over education is 
about both money and votes -- money for the schools, yes, but votes 
for the democrats this November. In his state of the union address 
last January, President Clinton called for more spending on education. 
I propose the first ever -- Including $1.1 billion more to hire 100,000 
more elementary school teachers and a trigger to free up $21.8 billion 
in bond money for new school construction. The republican Congress 
responded with its own education initiatives only to see the president 
veto them. Helping kids learn to read he vetoed. Low-income scholarships, 
he vetoed that. Yes, because the republicans had private school voucher 
proposals to which the president objected. There matters stood until 
last Friday when, at a big democratic White House pep rally, education 
was moved, suddenly, to the front burner. Politics should stop at 
the classroom door. It is not too late. Politics indeed. Polls show 
education resonates with the voters and democrats need help now in 
such place as Illinois where democratic senator Carole Mosely Braun, 
a sponsor of the construction money, is behind. And California where 
senator Barbara boxer, who proposed after-school programs, is in a 
tight race. So, today, another big democratic pep rally convened at 
a suburban Maryland elementary school with almost no notice to the 
principal. We found out about the visit last evening. This school 
chosen because of the good TV visuals of classroom trailers, a perfect 
backdrop for presidential passion. We are shouting loudly to the heavens. 
To which the republicans are now responding "Hallelujah," vowing at 
their own hastily arranged pep rally on Capitol Hill to gladly provide 
the $1.1 billion for more teachers, if it goes directly to local districts, 
without passing through federal programs as the president wants. He 
wants it to go to bureaucrats. We want it to go to teachers. Both 
sides say education is too important to play politics with, but politics 
is what drives these election year budget battles. The president clearly 
hopes his last-minute push will win favor with the voters. Peter, 
the republicans clearly fear he may be right. Thank you, Sam. Sam 
Donaldson at the White House tonight.
