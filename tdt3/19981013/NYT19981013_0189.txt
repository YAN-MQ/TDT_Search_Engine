There is something rather touching about Ian McKellen's new enthusiasm 
for cinema. During a long stage career, he has won all the honors 
(including a knighthood) that are the due of great English actors. 
His interpretations of such roles as Macbeth, Iago, Richard III and 
Uncle Vanya are considered generational benchmarks. Yet now, at 59, 
he has acquired an appetite to work in movies, to do what for the 
best part of four decades he found unappealing. Is it fame that he 
is after? Although long a favorite of London theatergoers, McKellen 
has neither the name nor face recognition that movies and television 
bring. Yet this slim, good-natured actor insists that he is not yearning 
for greater fame or fortune. An enhanced reputation, he says, has 
just one purpose at this juncture of his life: to help him obtain 
good screen roles. This fall, he is on the right track with the release 
of two new movies in which he plays the lead role. In Bryan Singer's 
``Apt Pupil,'' which opens Friday, he appears as a Nazi war criminal 
hiding out in an American town in the early 1980s in a story based 
on Stephen King's novella of the same name. In Bill Condon's ``Gods 
and Monsters,'' which opens Nov. 4, he portrays James Whale, the Hollywood 
movie director best known for making ``Frankenstein'' and ``The Bride 
of Frankenstein'' in the 1930s. ``When I did the movie of `Richard 
III,' I thought, this has an excitement that I have not felt before,'' 
McKellen said during an interview here in Leeds, where he is rehearsing 
the first of three successive stage roles at the West Yorkshire Playhouse. 
``And I wanted to do more. I have only come back to theater now because 
I was enjoying movies so much that I thought, maybe I won't act again 
in the old way. I wasn't missing theater, and I wanted to know if 
I still enjoyed it. I do _ but I'm now missing films.'' While McKellen 
had previously played small roles in big films and big roles in small 
films, it was Shakespeare's most villainous English monarch that led 
him to discover the joy of moviemaking. Richard Loncraine's 1995 film 
version of ``Richard III'' was inspired by Richard Eyre's 1992 stage 
production, in which McKellen also appeared (in London and at the 
Brooklyn Academy of Music) as the kind of uniformed 1930s tyrant who 
might have seized power in Britain had Naziism crossed the Channel. 
But the film was different. ``I'm very proud of the film because it 
was cinema,'' McKellen said, puffing on a cigarette. ``It was not 
the play and was never intended to be. I was credited as co-writer 
with the director, but it was a film written by William Shakespeare 
_ just that he didn't know he had written it. But I was not going 
to do anything that I didn't think Shakespeare would have approved 
of had he been making the film. If it didn't work, it was my fault; 
if people liked it, they liked it because it was by Shakespeare.'' 
The film won McKellen a Golden Globe nomination for best actor and 
a Felix Award as best European actor of the year, although he might 
well have worried about typecasting when he took the part of the fugitive 
Nazi, Kurt Dussander, in ``Apt Pupil.'' Had his Richard III escaped 
to America? Living under the assumed name of Arthur Denker, the octogenarian 
Dussander is a heavy-drinking recluse whose dark past is discovered 
by Todd Bowden (Brad Renfro), a high school student with an obsessive 
interest in the Holocaust. Todd's purpose, though, is not to denounce 
Dussander but rather to blackmail him into recounting in detail the 
atrocities that he committed and witnessed in German death camps. 
Todd even rents a theater costume of an SS uniform and forces Dussander 
to wear it. But the old Nazi is not bereft of cunning, and he gradually 
draws the young man into his own net of evil. ``It's the fate of most 
middle-aged actors, particularly with my background, that you get 
asked to play Nazis or villains or odd-ball characters,'' McKellen 
noted, ``or else you become an ersatz American, as Tony Hopkins, Gary 
Oldman and Tim Roth occasionally do. In other words, I don't get sent 
that many scripts with leading parts in them. In this case, it was 
directed by Bryan Singer, riding high from `The Usual Suspects.' There 
was also the challenge of being convincingly 25 years older than I 
am and having an Essen-cum-Southern California accent. It just seemed 
too good a treat.'' So he enjoyed playing this personification of 
diablerie? ``It was great fun,'' he said with a laugh. In contrast, 
his role in ``Gods and Monsters'' has echoes of the real Ian McKellen: 
James Whale had also been an actor on the London stage, became an 
Englishman-in-Hollywood and was openly gay. Not that McKellen had 
heard of Whale before he read ``Father of Frankenstein,'' a 1995 novel 
by Christopher Bram. The book imagines the weeks before the director's 
death in 1957 when he was found at the bottom of his swimming pool; 
it was adapted by Condon for ``Gods and Monsters.'' But when this 
gay English actor looking for a Hollywood role read what he called 
a ``beautifully written'' screenplay, he felt the part had been written 
for him. Now, of course, he knows a great deal more about Whale, who 
made no fewer than 21 films between 1930 and 1941. The Frankenstein 
movies keep his name alive today, but Whale also directed ``Journey's 
End,'' ``Show Boat'' and ``The Man in the Iron Mask'' (four of his 
horror films will be shown at the Film Forum in New York Oct. 30 through 
Nov. 12 as part of a series called ``Universal Horror''). After falling 
out with Universal Studios in the early 1940s, Whale then retired 
to a mansion in Pacific Palisades, where he painted and partied until 
shortly before his suicide at the age of 61. In ``Gods and Monsters,'' 
which played recently at the New York Film Festival, an elegant white-haired 
Whale, weakened by a stroke, is captivated by a hunky former Marine-turned-gardener, 
Clayton Boone (Brendan Fraser), whom he persuades to sit as a model 
for sketching. With Hannah the housekeeper (Lynn Redgrave) constantly 
fussing around, the unsophisticated _ and heterosexual _ Clayton gradually 
understands that Whale is gay and must have ulterior motives. But 
when he sees ``Frankenstein'' on television, he comes to appreciate 
Whale's talent, which Condon exhibits through flashbacks to the making 
of the horror films. Above all, though, ``Gods and Monsters'' is a 
poignant character study of an old gay artist looking back on his 
life. In a review in The New York Times, Janet Maslin wrote that McKellen's 
performance ``richly deserves to be remembered at the end of the year.'' 
And she added: ``What especially elevates (the movie) is the razor-sharp 
cleverness of McKellen's performance, which brings unusual fullness 
and feeling to a most unusual man.'' Did it worry McKellen to be playing 
a sad old gay? The question was intentionally provocative because, 
although McKellen's sexual preference was never a secret in theater 
circles, he went public with his homosexuality 10 years ago and has 
since campaigned vocally for gay rights and sexual equality in Britain. 
So, the question implied, was he reinforcing a stereotype by playing 
a ``sad old gay''? ``No,'' he said firmly. ``Ten years ago, this might 
have been true. But Whale's character rings true. He was a fighter. 
He got out of his industrial hometown in the Midlands, he survived 
World War I, he trained himself as a graphic artist, he had a good 
career as an actor in London, he was Hollywood's most famous director 
for 15 years, so I think that he had a really good life.'' And, no 
doubt, the same could be said of McKellen, who also fought his way 
out of a Lancashire mill town to win a place at Cambridge University, 
then moved quickly through regional repertory companies to become 
a pillar of the English theater, with stretches at the Royal Shakespeare 
Company and the Royal National Theater and a yearlong run in 1978 
on Broadway as Salieri in ``Amadeus.'' He jokes that when the likes 
of Albert Finney and Peter O'Toole opted for movie careers, they allowed 
him and Derek Jacobi to assume the great Shakespearean roles. Now, 
younger actors play Hamlet and Romeo, but McKellen continues to grow. 
``His peers and the critics perceive new depths, a finer sensitivity,'' 
Robert Chesshyre wrote in a profile of him for the London Daily Telegraph 
some years ago. ``He has tempered his intermittent weakness, the tendency 
to dramatic pyrotechnics, with a more emotional vein that comes from 
somewhere near his soul.'' For this, McKellen has a simple explanation. 
Coming out, he said, enabled him to ``enter the world'' and contribute 
something to society, to try to practice his preacher grandfathers' 
belief that ``you are in this world to make it a better place for 
other people.'' But it also changed his approach to acting. ``I don't 
fake emotion any longer as an actor,'' he explained. ``I don't pretend. 
I actually experience it. I've been trying to do that all my life, 
but I find it easier now to go straight into the emotion. I can be 
angry. For years I couldn't be angry. I could be angry with myself, 
but I couldn't feel real anger _ and now I can. That's why it's so 
good for people to come out. Being `in a closet' is a good image: 
you're in there, you're enclosed, you can't express yourself. Now 
I even have a Web site. I'm more voluble than ever.'' Indeed. When 
he recently moved to Leeds to perform at the West Yorkshire Playhouse 
in ``The Seagull,'' ``Present Laughter'' and ``The Tempest,'' he publicly 
bemoaned the ``impersonal audiences'' of London theaters and celebrated 
the chance to act before a local community. Suddenly British newspapers 
were speculating about McKellen's ``plan'' to boycott London, and 
Peter Hall, the veteran theater director, was expressing admiration 
at the actor's ``expert'' manipulation of the media. ``Sir Ian will 
not appear on the London stage again,'' Hall noted, ``until he appears 
on the London stage again.'' Still, by early spring, after he has 
spoken Prospero's Epilogue here for the last time, McKellen seems 
far more likely to head to Hollywood than London. Or at least that 
is his wish, because that is where his new challenge lies. ``It's 
much easier to have a long career in the theater,'' he said. ``It's 
almost expected of you. After 30 years, the respect begins to flow. 
But in cinema, there's a ranking that changes almost month by month, 
and very odd people are not on the list. Well, I'd like to be on the 
list of the bankable screen actors so that any part that I want to 
play might come my way. Life doesn't begin at 40; it begins at 50. 
At least it did for me. I've got a whole new lease on life.''
