Another round of rain showers will push across the northeastern United 
States, with a few lingering over the Great Lakes region as well. 
Meanwhile, cooler air pushes into the southeast. We'll see some showers 
and storms over Florida, and wet weather will persist across the northwest. 
Highs on Wednesday -- just 40s around the northern Great Lakes, 50s 
and 60s in the northern half of the country, 70s and 80s in the south, 
with a few 90s through the desert southwest. Looking ahead to Thursday 
-- some snow in the northern Rockies with rain showers pushing across 
the lower elevations. We'll see rain showers in New England as well. 
Friday, rain showers push to the northern plains states. Some thunderstorms 
will move into south Texas. We'll see some cool air over the northern 
Rockies. And for Saturday, look for scattered showers and storms through 
the plains. A few showers in the northwest. Temperatures about the 
same. A little warmer, though, through the southern Great Lakes. Don't 
forget, you can find four-day forecasts for 6,100 cities on CNN interactive 
at CNN.com.
