WASHINGTON _ I've always loved stories about parallel universes. The 
notion is in vogue in Hollywood. In ``Sliding Doors,'' Gwyneth Paltrow 
played out two possible futures _ one if she caught a subway, then 
met a cute guy on the train, and then got home in time to catch her 
boyfriend cheating. The other, if she missed the train and ended up 
staying with her loutish boyfriend. Demi Moore is filming ``Passion 
in Mind,'' in which she plays Marie, a widow and literary critic in 
France with two children and a lover, who dreams of Marty, a New York 
literary agent afraid to settle down. Or is she Marty, dreaming of 
Marie? Lifetime will air ``Twice Upon a Time,'' with Molly Ringwald, 
in which Molly, unsuccessful at work and bored with her boyfriend, 
snaps a Thanksgiving wishbone and wakes up the next day successful 
and married to a glamorous ex-boyfriend. Washington is so vile now, 
so filled with sulfurous partisan revenge tactics, so devoid of principle 
and accomplishments, that the idea of escaping to a parallel universe 
is more alluring than ever. I look through my mail. It's hard to tell 
if the letters from liberals or conservatives are more foul. Since 
I'm a woman, both sides dwell on my sex life. Both sides suggest I 
crave the president for myself. (I don't.) One liberal wrote that 
I was ``a frigid man-hater'' who was jealous of Monica. A Democratic 
woman from Texas railed, ``You remind me of my goody-two-shoes, unattractive, 
good Catholic sister Eileen, quick to judge and she the worst offender.'' 
One Greenwich conservative thoughtfully reasoned that ``There has 
been speculation as to who has been servicing the president now that 
Monica is not available ... the answer is you!'' Another penned, ``So 
do your lips have anything in common with Monica's?'' This from Louisiana: 
``You and other swooning females ... feel a need for mentally snuggling 
up to your slimy hero.'' Remarkably, they all sign their names. As 
I read, I yearn to metamorphose into a tango instructor at a smoky 
club in Buenos Aires. Or a neurosurgeon with eight kids and a border 
collie in New Mexico. Or a champagne farmer in France in love with 
a neighboring cognac farmer. Or an archeologist in the Yucatan who 
flies her own plane and owns a supper club called The Fuzzy Slipper. 
Anything, as long as I am not a Washington journalist in the era of 
Clinton and Gingrich and Starr, covering this horrible grudge match 
between the right and the left that has been building since Watergate. 
It's not enough for the Republicans just to prove the president morally 
unfit. He must be Nixon. People keep talking about redemption when 
they just want revenge. This great capital, once a place of gravity, 
has been reduced to a keyhole. The Starr prosecutors spill all the 
mud into the street, and then flatter themselves that they are discreet 
just because they black out a few lines here and there. The president, 
by turning his White House into a war room and a bachelor pad, began 
the shame-spiral that has so cheapened the presidency and the capital. 
The city is at once completely sexualized and completely Puritanized. 
The city is dizzy and salacious and careerist and TV-mad and full 
of fake morality and real hypocrisy. No one is willing to make distinctions. 
My indelicate correspondents do not understand how I could criticize 
Bill Clinton for lying and for turning his White House into a place 
of lying and ugly tactics, and still not want to see him impeached. 
I'm not being inconsistent. I'm just trying to make distinctions in 
a complicated case. What Clinton did was reprehensible. But he doesn't 
deserve to die for it. His presidency is already ruined _ he is the 
Andrew Johnson of the counterculture _ and he can be penalized in 
any of a number of ways that will not rend the nation. But Republicans 
have lost all sense of proportion. They are absolutists, set on destroying 
the situationist in the White House. By releasing his secret grand 
jury testimony, Newt &AMP; Co. have already enjoyed the sadistic pleasure 
of seeing Clinton squirm about sex and cigars on TV for four hours. 
They should not also have the sadistic pleasure of holding hearings 
on TV for the rest of his tenure. You can't punish someone twice. 
This is still America. I think.
