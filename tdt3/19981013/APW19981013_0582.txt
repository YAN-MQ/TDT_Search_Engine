Ukraine's negative foreign trade balance reached dlrs 1.47 billion 
over the first eight months of this year, the State Statistics Committee 
said Tuesday. Ukrainian exports totaled dlrs 8.178 billion in January-August 
1998, while imports amounted to dlrs 9.650 billion, it said. Despite 
the economic crisis in Russia, Moscow remained Ukraine's largest trade 
partner, accounting for 24.8 percent of its exports and 48.4 percent 
of imports. Ukraine exported 6.2 percent of its produce to China, 
another 5.8 percent to Turkey and 5 percent to Germany. Germany accounted 
for 8.5 percent of the imports, followed by the United States with 
4.3 percent, and Poland with 3.4 percent, the committee said. It noted 
that 7.9 percent of export deals and 6.5 percent of import deals so 
far in 1998 were in the form of barter arrangements that involve exchanges 
of goods and services without actual payments.
