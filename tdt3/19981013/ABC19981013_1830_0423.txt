The basketball association has canceled the first two weeks of its 
season. The season was supposed to begin at the beginning of November. 
The owners and players are still paralyzed about their differences 
about money. It's the rich versus the rich. The talks were cordial, 
but no deal. This is not a very pleasant announcement. No agreement 
on the core issue, players' soaring salaries. Kevin Garnett in the 
league only three years signed a six-year contract for $126 million, 
$36 million more than the owner paid for the team. The teams are paying 
out too much money in salaries in relation to the team's revenues. 
The owners claimed half the 29 teams actually lost money last season. 
Their solution -- a hard salary cap on player's salaries. We feel 
with a hard cap, we as players cannot survive. These issues sank major 
league baseball in 1994. It has taken that league four years to recover, 
a timetable the NBA may not fined so palatable. John Frankel, ABC 
News, New York.
