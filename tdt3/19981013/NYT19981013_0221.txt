If you love the theater, or are part of it, or even writing about 
it, then everything's a drama. When I joined The New York Times as 
a drama critic in 1980, I had no idea that there would be so many 
offstage events that would be part of my beat. I couldn't have imagined 
that director Gower Champion's death would be announced from the stage 
by the producer David Merrick on the opening night of ``42nd Street.'' 
Or that Joseph Papp would lead a fierce protest two blocks from my 
office to try (unsuccessfully, of course) to halt the demolition of 
three theaters, including the Morosco (hallowed site of the premiere 
of ``Death of a Salesman''), to make way for a towering Marriott hotel. 
Or that the theatrical community would be decimated by an epidemic, 
as yet unnamed and unremarked, like AIDS. When 13 years later I moved 
on, somewhat sadder and (I hope) more than somewhat wiser, the landscape 
was unrecognizable _ and not just because of the vanished old theaters. 
The hottest play in town was a two-part, eight-hour ``gay fantasia'' 
known as ``Angels in America,'' Disney was toying with sticking its 
first toe (``Beauty and the Beast'') into Broadway, and Neil Simon, 
whose plays for better and worse had defined Broadway for three decades, 
was being exiled by economic realities to a small playhouse dozens 
of blocks from Times Square. Now nearly another five years have passed, 
and the American theater seems poised for an even more dramatic and 
far more rapid shift _ perhaps the most momentous systemic change 
since the rise of off-Broadway and the regional theater movement in 
the 1950s, or even since the onslaught of television in the decade 
before that. And again, the biggest story is happening offstage. After 
generations of being a backwater to the big-money, mass-audience show 
business mainstream of movies, television and the recording industry, 
the American theater is no longer secluded in its own idiosyncratic 
world where it can be entirely the master (however erratic and self-destructive) 
of its own fate. Like book publishing before it _ until the last decade, 
another quaint holdout against the forces of media consolidation _ 
the theater is now becoming ``content'' suitable for synergistic annexation 
and exploitation by our new entertainment conglomerates. What prompts 
me to take stock of the theater's recent past and looming future is 
the time I recently spent compiling ``Hot Seat: Theater Criticism 
for The New York Times, 1980-1993,'' an anthology of the drama reviews 
I wrote for The Times. Confronting an avalanche of old clippings for 
the first time in years, I re-encountered some great nights and artists 
that remain indelible, as well as some fabulous fiascoes, like ``Moose 
Murders'' and ``Carrie,'' that linger almost as brightly as triumphs 
like ``Sunday in the Park With George'' and ``Glengarry Glen Ross.'' 
I also discovered that other plays, including some I had praised, 
had vanished entirely from memory. My editor suggested that I acknowledge 
this new perspective by adding retrospective afterthoughts to my reviews 
and, for fun, create an appendix with lists not just of bests and 
worsts but also of plays that I now feel I had overestimated (starting 
with Sam Shepard's ``Lie of the Mind'') and underestimated (``Nicholas 
Nickleby'') the first time around. Rocco Landesman, the rare Broadway 
producer who is actually a reformed drama critic, has long griped 
that one of the worst things about critics is that they never admit 
to making mistakes. He's right. It was certainly liberating to admit 
to mine, now that I had some historical distance that allowed me to 
look at the record fresh and recognize them. (Though some of that 
historical perspective is simply the vicissitudes of age; in another 
20 years, maybe I'll even look back fondly on ``Aspects of Love.'') 
But the biggest, most humbling mistake I discovered _ and I feel only 
slightly defensive about it, since everyone else in or around the 
theater made it, too _ was my utter failure to anticipate the single 
most important change on Broadway in decades: the arrival of Disney 
as a redevelopment force, which led in turn to the happy revival of 
42nd Street and the entire Times Square neighborhood but, less happily, 
to the impending corporatization of the American theater, on Broadway 
and beyond. From this discovery it was only a sobering moment until 
I realized that, whatever my lists of bests and worsts, there was 
only one candidate for the honor of ``most influential'' production 
during my time as drama critic. The winner, without question, is ``Cats.'' 
I am not talking about the quality of this musical or lack of same 
_ a mirthless debate even in 1982 _ or its marathon run, now and perhaps 
forever the longest in Broadway history. Rather, ``Cats'' is ``most 
influential'' in terms of its mega-influence on the national theatrical 
culture. ``Cats'' outlasted its critics, outlasted umpteen casts, 
outlasted English-speaking audiences, even outlasted the career of 
its principal creator, Andrew Lloyd Webber, who hasn't had a hit in 
more than a decade. But now, 16 years after its New York opening, 
the new world that the American theater is entering _ the world typified 
but not exclusively represented by Disney _ is the one that ``Cats'' 
has made. ``Cats'' proved as no production had before that there was 
an infinite tourist audience for a theatrical attraction (as opposed 
to, say, a circus, Las Vegas revue or Radio City Music Hall pageant) 
in which spectacle trumped (or perhaps Trumped) content and no English 
was required for comprehension, whether by young children or foreign 
visitors. In conjunction with the rise of ticket prices into the stratosphere 
during its run, ``Cats'' soon made it difficult for adult, conventionally 
scaled musicals to compete in the commercial theater's marketplace. 
Why pay the same high ticket price for a show, consumers asked, that 
didn't have a levitating spaceship or a falling chandelier but only 
good songs, compelling characters or provocative drama? A very few 
smaller-scale musicals, like ``Rent'' and ``Bring In da Noise, Bring 
In da Funk,'' have bucked the odds, but they are anomalies. Straight 
plays, already an endangered species when ``Cats'' opened, have fared 
even worse. Drama on Broadway now pretty much means exclusively British 
imports and one-person shows. There is no major (or even semi-major) 
American playwright with a new work scheduled for Broadway this season 
_ and it's not because American playwrights aren't writing. The lasting 
influence of ``Cats'' is felt not just in the ascendancy of spectacles. 
With its environmental set and audience-pawing performers, ``Cats'' 
(and its immediate Lloyd Webber sequel, the roller-skating ``Starlight 
Express'') also anticipated the kind of national theatrical franchise, 
from ``Tony and Tina's Wedding'' to ``Late Nite Catechism,'' in which 
the ``interactive'' theatrical experience becomes virtually indistinguishable 
from theme parks and theme restaurants. Most of all, ``Cats'' is the 
show that led indirectly but inexorably to Disney's arrival on Broadway 
a decade later by proving, first, that Broadway musicals could be 
marketed in a big-budget, Hollywood-style ``branding'' blitz (previously 
unknown in an industry that was suspicious of television commercials 
until the 1970s) and, second, that there was a huge profit to be made 
in exploiting animated characters on a Broadway stage. The characters 
of ``The Lion King,'' at the gorgeously restored Ziegfeld palace the 
New Amsterdam, are literally descendants of the cats of ``Cats,'' 
with the gifted director Julie Taymor providing the illusion of highbrow 
gloss to the kiddie show that British director Trevor Nunn and (involuntarily) 
T.S. Eliot lent to their feline ancestors at another former Ziegfeld 
roost, the Winter Garden. There is nothing wrong with a ``Cats'' or 
a ``Lion King'' as part of the Broadway mix _ if it actually were 
a mix _ but what ``Lion King'' helped bring to Broadway (as ``Cats'' 
did not) is a corporate sensibility in the work itself, not just its 
marketing. Whatever its merits, ``Cats'' was produced by individuals 
as an original piece for the theater, while ``Lion King'' is but the 
stage incarnation of an already existing product line (the movie, 
the tchotchkes, the video, the Disney World representations, etc.) 
manufactured by the most sophisticated entertainment giant on the 
planet. The corporate mentality extends to the ``Lion King'' score, 
which is by an assembly line of disparate songwriters (``Cats'' had 
only Lloyd Webber and his unacknowledged alter ego, Puccini). The 
performances at the New Amsterdam are often unspontaneous, as if they 
were audio-animatronic carbons of the animated movie's prototypes. 
There is synergistic cross-product-plugging not just in the Disney 
store off the lobby but onstage (a gag promoting ``Beauty and the 
Beast''). Disney is not alone in bringing a corporate approach to 
the theater. It is merely the corporation with the biggest marquee 
name, deepest pockets and, in truth, the most skill. A similar sensibility 
infuses ``Ragtime,'' the product of Livent, the first publicly traded 
company to devote itself to theater. Though based on a nuanced, indisputably 
adult novel by E.L. Doctorow, this musical has the same look and feel 
as the previous Livent product, ``Show Boat'' _ even though the shows 
have different authors and were staged by very different directors 
(Frank Galati and Harold Prince, respectively). ``Ragtime,'' like 
``Lion King,'' comes to a halt for a gratuitous corporate plug (a 
number about Ford Motor Co., whose cash donation bought it the name 
of the new theater where the show is playing). And, like ``Lion King'' 
as well, ``Ragtime'' is suffused with a bland political correctness 
designed to appeal to all markets and offend no one. (In retrospect, 
the vulgar sexism of ``Cats,'' with its whore-kitty-with-a-heart-of-gold 
heroine, seems almost daring.) Since Disney still (rightly) regards 
theater as a small-potatoes part of its empire, and Livent is on the 
ropes in the midst of declining revenues and rising fraud investigations, 
they may actually end up as relatively minor players in the new corporate 
theater. The real power could turn out to be a newcomer few have heard 
of: SFX Entertainment. The brainchild of radio mogul Robert F.X. Sillerman, 
the publicly traded SFX has swallowed up a bevy of pop-music concert 
presenters and venues, now controlling more than half the national 
market, including 31 of the country's 37 amphitheaters. Late last 
year, it bought Pace, the leading producer of theatrical touring shows 
in the country, then went shopping for other theatrical properties 
across the map. Since theater on the road is now a far larger business 
than Broadway, SFX is de facto the most powerful theater producer 
in the country. We have come a long way from impresarios like David 
Merrick and Joseph Papp, who produced both high art and schlock but 
who ventured from theater only to dabble in movies or television. 
SFX's nontheatrical enterprises include not just pop concerts but 
the staging of monster-truck rallies, demolition derbies and the career 
management of Michael Jordan. On the new road dominated by SFX, not 
only are straight plays extinct but even a Disney or Livent musical 
may prove to be a relatively rarefied theatrical offering. Much of 
the schedule at gargantuan touring houses around the country is filled 
out by what Variety has called ``pseudo'' theatrical attractions: 
multiple companies of ``Riverdance,'' ``Stomp,'' ``Tap Dogs'' and 
their many imitators and variations. Meanwhile, Broadway more than 
ever tailors itself to this same huge and lucrative market. This explains 
not only why there are no major American plays on Broadway's schedule 
this season but why most of the announced shows are chestnuts with 
familiar, instantly saleable titles (``Footloose,'' ``Peter Pan,'' 
``Annie Get Your Gun,'' ``You're a Good Man, Charlie Brown''). The 
only antidote to this new commercial theater, which has more in common 
with the values of special-effects American movies and network television 
than did even old Broadway at its most commercial, remains the nonprofit 
theater of off-Broadway and resident theaters nationwide. As has been 
true since the 1970s, the most exciting new plays originate in such 
companies _ but now they are ghettoized there. Nonprofit theater hits 
like ``How I Learned to Drive,'' ``Wit'' and ``The Dying Gaul'' _ 
which once might have moved to Broadway (and from there, possibly, 
to the road), as ``Glengarry Glen Ross,'' ``Driving Miss Daisy'' and 
``Angels in America'' once did _ now remain in small houses for their 
entire runs. An occasional ``Side Man'' notwithstanding, they rarely 
transfer to Broadway and their only hope for national dissemination 
is if they are mounted in new productions by local companies around 
the country. On its face this seems a workable system: a two-tiered 
theater just as there is a two-tiered film culture divided between 
Hollywood blockbusters and independent art-house films. But nonprofit 
theaters don't have the reach or the financial clout of even the movie 
industry's small fry; the most successful of these theaters still 
need serious philanthropic subsidies (public or private) just to meet 
costs. Now, the new corporate theater giants are knocking at their 
door with bigger and bigger checks. This season alone three major 
nonprofit theaters _ Lincoln Center Theater in New York (Livent's 
``Parade''), the Alliance Theater in Atlanta (Disney's ``Elaborate 
Lives: The Legend of Aida''), the Alley Theater in Houston (SFX/Pace's 
``Civil War'') _ are collaborating with the new behemoths, exclusively 
on musicals. Are these Faustian bargains that will lead to other commercial 
collaborations that will change the character of such theaters and 
ultimately wipe tough new plays off their schedules, too? Or are they 
benign, one-shot deals? It is too early to tell. An even larger open 
question is how corporate theater will affect nonprofit theaters indirectly 
_ by shaping the taste of their future audiences. If the new generations 
of theatergoers coming up now are mostly weaned on the esthetics of 
``Lion King'' and ``Riverdance,'' will they want the same limited 
theatrical diet when they become the new audience pool for the Roundabout 
Theater Company or the Goodman Theater in Chicago or Arena Stage in 
Washington? A new Theater Development Fund survey released last month 
reported the good news that the under-18 theater audience is increasing 
for the first time in more than a generation. But there is chilling 
news buried in the fine print: almost all of these new theatergoers 
were attending ``Beauty and the Beast'' and the like, with the under-18 
component of straight-play audiences numbering a minuscule 1.1 percent. 
(Even for 25-year-olds, the figure rises only to 6.4.) But what keeps 
me optimistic about the theater, and always has, is that the influx 
of talent never stops. If companies that were vital when I was a drama 
critic, like the Circle Rep and Negro Ensemble Company, vanish, new 
ones like the Atlantic, New York Theater Workshop and Drama Dept. 
still come along to take their place. These are the theaters that 
find and nurture the individual voices that produce our best plays 
and musicals _ and they are the antithesis of the new corporate theater, 
which is run by committee. No corporation is ever going to create 
a ``Death of a Salesman'' or a ``How I Learned to Drive `` or a ``Bring 
In da Noise'' or a revival that makes you look at Shakespeare or Williams 
or Ibsen anew. But will the nonprofit theaters that do this work be 
heard against the forbidding din of giants like Disney and SFX and 
the other media conglomerates certain to follow? At this point, as 
I recall, a drama critic ritualistically reminds readers that the 
theater is a fabulous invalid, destined to rise once more from its 
deathbed. But our theater, a bigger business than ever as measured 
in dollars, is hardly dying. The real question about a theater overrun 
by cartoon characters and scripted by marketers is what, over the 
long haul, will be its quality of life. I never would have guessed 
as I watched a defiant Joe Papp, the great O'Neill actress Colleen 
Dewhurst beside him, fight big commercial interests to save hallowed 
old playhouses in the early 1980s that his struggle was quixotic. 
Even if he had saved those theaters, what would he have been saving 
them for? Not for the theater of language and intimacy and passion. 
Not for anything he or many of the rest of us back then would have 
recognized as plays.
