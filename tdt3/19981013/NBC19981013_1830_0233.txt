Merrill Lynch may be the first big Wall Street player to take a hit. 
Other industries have already laid off thousands, some of those as 
a result of corporate mergers that eliminated jobs. Overall, a total 
of more than 430,000 people have been laid off so far this year. Some 
of the biggest job cuts have come from -- Motorola, 15,000, and Raytheon, 
14,000 over the next two years. Also laying off -- Gillette, 4,700 
workers. And high-tech giant Intel, 3,000 jobs gone.
