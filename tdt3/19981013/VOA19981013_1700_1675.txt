programming. Beginning in Italy, where Wednesday, pharmacies in Italy 
will begin prescribing the anti-impotency drug Viagra. One Italian 
drug store will not stock the medicine -- the Vatican pharmacy. The 
pharmacy is open to the public and is considered to be one of Rome's 
best drug stores. Without explanation, a store employee said Tuesday

The store also does not sell contraceptives. Many Catholic theologians 
have endorsed Viagra.
