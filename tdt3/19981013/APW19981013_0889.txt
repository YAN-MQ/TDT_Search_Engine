Anna Kournikova served up a massive 17 double-faults Tuesday, handing 
eighth-seed Dominique Van Roost a straight-sets victory in the first 
round of the European Championships. Becoming the first Belgian women 
ever to enter the world's top-10 rankings on Monday, an assertive 
Van Roost needed just 56 minutes to dispatch the faltering Russian 
6-3, 6-1. ``It makes a huge difference when you know you've entered 
the top-10 and you've beaten some really great players,'' said Van 
Roost, who ousted former world No. 1 Martina Hingis in the quarterfinals 
at Filderstadt last week. ``It made a huge difference on my side and 
on the other side because she knew it, too.'' Van Roost showed only 
a momentary lapse in the first set, allowing Kournikova to break and 
go up 3-2. But the Belgian displayed the same determination which 
allowed her to defeat Hingis, winning the next four games to take 
the set. Stuggling with her service game, the 17-year-old Russian 
labored in the second set to retain her opening serve, before losing 
her next three and literally handing Van Roost the win. ``I think 
she was more nervous and under pressure,'' said Van Roost. ``She's 
probably the most famous player at the moment, even more than Martina. 
``With people around her all the time, being in every newspaper, being 
the the star, she has to win a tournament. She needs to prove she's 
deserving of her status.'' Van Roost was quick to acknowledge Kournikova 
had talent and predicted the Russian would be back in the top-10 before 
long. The Russian, who fell out of the top-10 after tearing ligaments 
in her right thumb in a fall in Eastbourne, is currently ranked 12th 
in the world. She has not lost to anyone ranked outside the world's 
top-15 since the start of 1997. ``I was a bit nervous but I'm not 
feeling pressure from anybody,'' denied Kournikova, who regularly 
looked over at her coach Pavel Slozil after losing a point. ``I was 
just getting uptight as the match went on. ``I just need to get back 
to where I was before I was injured.'' Sixth-seed Amanda Coetzer advanced 
to the second round with a 7-5, 6-4 win over Natascha Zvereva of Belarus. 
The two traded serves twice in the first before Coetzer won the last 
three games to clinch the set. In the second set, the two players 
again traded sets early, but Coetzer once again prevailed when she 
took Zvereva's serve at 5-4 to wrap up the match. American Lisa Raymond, 
who reached the semifinals last year after upsetting Hingis in the 
quarterfinals, advanced to the second round Wednesday with a 6-4, 
6-4 victory over lucky-loser Catalina Cristea of Romania.
