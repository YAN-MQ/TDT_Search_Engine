A court on Tuesday dismissed a case by a lawyer seeking to shut down 
the first Egyptian peace group that aims at improving ties with Israelis, 
police said. The court said that Mamdouh Nakhla, the lawyer who filed 
the case, had no direct interest in the issue and that his petition 
to the court was therefore invalid, police said, speaking on customary 
condition of anonymity. Nakhla had argued that Egyptian law does not 
allow groups set up as associations to promote political issues. The 
Cairo Peace Movement, which was launched by a group of Egyptian intellectuals 
in April, works to promote peace with Israel. The group has about 
120 members, including journalists, lawyers and former diplomats. 
The group is critical of the government of Prime Minister Benjamin 
Netanyahu, which it says has been blocking efforts to achieve peace. 
Egypt in 1979 became the first Arab state to sign a peace agreement 
with Israel. Relations, however, have been cool. Until recently, Egyptians 
couldn't travel to Israel except with a special permit. There has 
been a virtual boycott in Egyptian media of Israeli officials.
