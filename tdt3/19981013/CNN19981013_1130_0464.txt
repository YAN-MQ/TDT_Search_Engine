This is Orelon Sidney from the CNN weather center with your "Headline 
News weather" update. Showers are possible early this morning across 
Washington and Oregon, southern Texas and southern Florida. As a cold 
front moves on shore in the northwest, look for increasing chances 
of rain and snow in the higher elevations. Also, look for a chance 
of rainfall and snow across portions of lake huron and northward, 
and into portions of New England. Mostly rainfall through Wednesday, 
as a low-pressure storm tracks to the east. High pressure will build 
across portions of the south, and we continue to see pleasant temperatures 
in your forecast. Honolulu today will see a high of 87. Look for 46 
degrees at Juneau, with highs in the mid 80s across the virgin islands. 
Most of the nation will see 40s and 50s in the north. 60s, 70s and 
80s in the south, with 90s still holding onto the desert southwest. 
On the extended forecast, snow showers, rain and wind expected across 
the northern tier states on Thursday, with thunderstorm chances increasing 
for southern Texas on Friday. A few showers will continue across the 
puget sound, with scattered thunderstorms in the central plains for 
the weekend. The forecast for more than 6,000 cities is at CNN.com.
