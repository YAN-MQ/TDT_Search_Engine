This week on the "cold & flu report," for most of us, the flu means 
a miserable few days in bed. But for the elderly and the very young 
and others who may have weakened immune systems, the flu can be deadly. 
Experts say in a normal year, about 20,000 Americans die from the 
flu. Sometimes the flu itself does the damage, and sometimes it opens 
the way for pneumonia or other secondary infections. Experts say the 
best way to prevent the flu is to get a yearly flu vaccine.
