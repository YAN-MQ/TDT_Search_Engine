This year's nobel prize in physics goes to three professors all working 
at U.S. universities who made a major breakthrough in the understanding 
of Quantum physics. American Robert laughlin, German horst stoermer 
and Daniel tsui, a Chinese native who is now an American citizen, 
discovered how subatomic particles can act like a fluid. The men will 
share the nearly $1 million prize.
