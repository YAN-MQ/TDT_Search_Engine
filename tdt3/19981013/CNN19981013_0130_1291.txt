baseball's postseason continues and the braves are hanging in there. 
michael tucker drove in five runs, including a three-run homer in 
the eighth inning that gave atlanta the lead as the braves beat the 
padres 7-6 monday night. greg maddux pitched the ninth inning for 
his first career save. san diego still leads the national league championship 
series three games to two heading back to atlanta. i guess tonight 
was my night, and hopefully we can get back to atlanta and somebody 
else can do it and pick it up. it was galarraga last night. we've 
been getting pretty much hits every opportunity i think the guys are 
stepping up a lot. in the american league, the yankees will try to 
finish off the indians tuesday night in new york. charles nagy will 
face david cone with the yankees up three games to two.
