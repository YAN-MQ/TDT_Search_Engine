A retired U.S. Army sergeant has been arrested on charges of spying. 
VOA's Jim Randle reports from the federal court in Alexandria, Virginia, 
on the man who's accused of giving the Soviets highly secret information 
about American intelligence efforts. Federal officials say retired 
First Sergeant David Boone was arrested after he gave highly secret 
information to an FBI agent posing as a Russian spy. Mr. Boone is 
accused of passing many pages of highly classified information to 
the KGB and to its Russian successor agency. Court papers allege the 
documents included information about U.S. knowledge of Soviet tactical 
nuclear weapons. Mr. Boone was an analyst who studied information 
gleaned from U.S. electronic eavesdropping efforts. Court papers say 
Mr. Boone may have been motivated by financial problems and a failed 
marriage. Officials say he collected $60,000 for his information.
