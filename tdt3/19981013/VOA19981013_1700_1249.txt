Top seed Marcelo Rios of Chile has won his first round match at the 
Singapore Open tennis tournament. David Luddy is there and has more. 
Rios, the world number three and a million-dollar winner at the recent 
Grand Slam Cup, destroyed Canadian Sebastian Lareau 6-2, 6-0. His 
punishing drives from both flanks made it a humiliating experience 
for his opponent in this Heineken Open. Last year, Rios reached the 
quarters. This year, he's expected to sprint into Sunday's final. 
Meanwhile, Chang and Ivanisevic, who contested the rain delayed Shanghai 
final won by Chang, are in the other half of the draw. Chang is reportedly 
being paid over $400,000 American in appearance money. David Luddy 
for VOA in Singapore.
