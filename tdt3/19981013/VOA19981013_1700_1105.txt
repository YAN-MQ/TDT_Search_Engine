Time now for sports. Jim Stevenson is here, and he's serving up baseball 
on his sports menu. That's right, Tom. You know, no team in Major 
League Baseball playoff history has recovered from a 3-0 deficit to 
win a playoff series. In fact, no team behind 3-0 has ever won the 
next two games. Well, the Atlanta Braves now have, and they keep their 
hopes alive of coming all the way back as they battled from behind 
to beat host San Diego Monday 7-6 in game five of the National League 
Championship series. The unlikely hitting star was outfielder Michael 
Tucker, who drove in five runs. His big blow was a three-run homerun 
in the eighth inning when the Braves scored five runs to take a 7-4 
lead. Atlanta manager Bobby Cox says you never know who will become 
a hero in the postseason. People are always asking when you start 
the series, you know, who's going to play? Who's going to do this? 
Who do you think will be the star? And my answer has always been, 
you know, somebody that you may not even expect. Talk about unexpected. 
Manager Bobby Cox sent his starting pitcher Greg Maddux in to throw 
in the ninth inning to help preserve the lead. That's because reliever 
Kerry Ligtenberg gave up a two-run homerun in the ninth to pinch-hitter 
Greg Myers that cut Atlanta's lead to one run. Maddux retired the 
three hitters he faced for his very first career save. San Diego still 
holds the best of seven series 3-2, but the teams now head to Atlanta 
for game six on Wednesday and, if necessary, game seven.
