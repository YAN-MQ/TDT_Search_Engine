Many hotels that cater to business travelers are taking steps to make 
it easier to stay in touch with the office while on the road. Lori 
Waffenschmidt has the story in this edition of "working ahead." American 
express reports two-thirds of business travelers surveyed have laptops 
in tow. Road Warriors used the computers much more frequently than 
in the past. They were very high-productivity tools. The downside 
-- getting information quickly. Typically, business travelers traveling 
with laptops are used to kind of chunka, chunka, chunking along. Now 
hotels are installing high-speed Internet connections. At the Hyatt 
San Jose, guests can log in via an I-port hook-up. Most of our guests 
are used to high-speed, either for isdn or through T1 line, in their 
office. They don't want to be stalled out on a 28.8 modem, sitting 
there waiting for their -- their office to come online. Some rooms 
have just the I-port connection with free Internet time. Other business-plan 
rooms have PCs hooked up to the Internet, and guests pay to surf the 
web by the day or the minute. But corporate firewalls, in place for 
online security, may block access from your hotel. Most traveling 
professionals really need to access their proprietary corporate E-mail 
and also obtain data and information from their internal corporate 
networks. And right now, in most cases, that's almost impossible to 
do from public access Internet. Other hotels, such as Hilton, are 
also testing high-speed Internet connections. Lori Waffenschmidt, 
CNN, reporting.
