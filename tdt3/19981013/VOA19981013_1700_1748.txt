That's right. We have just a very brief frequency announcement for 
us. If you're listening in Oceani or the Pacific, you can consider 
switching over right now to 9.705 MHz short wave, which we're now 
broadcasting on from 2100 to 0000 Universal Time. And if you send 
us your name and address, we will mail you a VOA frequency schedule. 
Just send it off to VOA News Now, Voice of America, Washington, D.C. 
20547 USA. It's 2130 Universal Time, and this is VOA News Now. President 
Clinton says the Yugoslav president must move quickly on an agreement 
to end fighting in Kosovo. Congolese rebel leaders call for direct 
talks with President Kabila following a rebel victory at a strategic 
eastern town. And what happens when neighboring nations become enemies? 
That's the question we examine on "Dateline." All that and more in 
our next half hour of VOA News Now. First, the latest world news.
