From National Public Radio News in Washington, I'm Kory Flintoff. 
President Clinton says he is satisfied that the deal between NATO 
and Yugoslavia's President, Slobodan Milosevic is good if Milosevic 
honors his commitments. NPR's Mara Lyosan reports. President Clinton 
says NATO is determined to move Serbian President Slobodan Milosevic 
from the battlefield to the bargaining table. He says the situation 
in Kosovo could be resolved peacefully if Milosevic pulls out his 
troops from Kosovo, lets relief agencies in and starts autonomy negotiations 
with the Kosovar Albanians. We will not rely on what President Milosevic 
says, but on what he does for the whole world to see. Americans could 
be among the 2,000 unarmed civilian inspectors who would make sure 
the cease fire holds, but the monitoring force will not include any 
U.S. ground troops. NATO has put a deadline of Friday for Milosevic 
to make serious progress toward complying with the deal. Mara Lyosan, 
NPR News, The White House.
