In a fast-consolidating supermarket industry, Safeway is buying Dominick's 
supermarkets for $1.2 billion in cash. Dominick's has more than 100 
stores in the Chicago area. While Safeway, the nation's second largest 
food and drug retailer, has more than 1,400 stores around the country. 
Safeway and Dominick's hope to complete the deal by the end of the 
year.
