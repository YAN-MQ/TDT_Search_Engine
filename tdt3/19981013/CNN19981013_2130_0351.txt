Two days before a mideast summit in Maryland, Israeli prime Minster 
Benjamin Netanyahu is saying no agreement is possible unless the Palestinian 
authority enforces its security commitments against terrorism. He 
made those remarks after an Israeli was killed and another was wounded 
in a shooting outside Jerusalem. In a statement, Netanyahu says -- 
"in light of this gloomy reality, there is absolutely no chance, at 
this stage, of signing a peace agreement." In return for Palestinian 
security guarantees Netanyahu has agreed, in principle, to withdraw 
forces from an additional 13% of the West Bank.
