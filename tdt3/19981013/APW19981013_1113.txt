Kosovo Albanians and Serbs breathed a sigh of relief Tuesday that 
NATO missiles and bombs wouldn't be exploding around them right away. 
But few expressed any real optimism about the future. Slate-gray skies 
and a steady, day-long rainfall seemed fit accompaniment for the mood 
in Pristina, capital of the poor southern province of Serbia, the 
dominant force in the two remaining states of the Yugoslav Federation. 
Mirko, 50, a Serb refugee who fled the Krajina region of Bosnia during 
the three-year conflict there, was depressed about the deal American 
negotiator Richard Holbrooke struck with Yugoslav President Slobodan 
Milosevic. ``He will sell Kosovo in the same way he sold Krajina,'' 
said Mirko, who wouldn't give his last name. ``I have no idea where 
I'm supposed to go now. If I have to run once again, I'll kill myself.'' 
Stevo, a Serb pensioner in his 70s sitting at the same restaurant 
table in central Pristina, said agreement was better than bombardment. 
Milosevic ``couldn't fight the whole world,'' said Stevo, who gave 
only his first name. ``This is all an American plot. They want to 
destroy small nations.'' Atifete Celaj, 23, an ethnic Albanian refugee 
driven from her home and now living outdoors near Kishna Reka, (30 
kilometers) 20 miles southwest of Pristina, said she doesn't have 
much faith in the unarmed observer force that is supposed to verify 
Serb compliance. ``Until observers come here and give us security, 
and not just any security, we are not going back home,'' she said. 
Milosevic ``is saying that I am going to be secure, but we don't believe 
him any more.'' Ethnic Albanian political leaders agreed the key now 
was whether Milosevic complied with the agreement. ``We welcome NATO's 
dedication to stop the genocide in Kosovo, but we have had very bitter 
experiences in the past with this regime. So we have to wait and see 
if compliance is going to take place or not,'' said Alush Gashi, foreign 
affairs secretary of the ethnic Albanian LDK party. The Kosovo Liberation 
Army, the loosely organized rebel force that has been struggling against 
Serbian forces since its founding in 1996, declared a unilateral cease-fire 
last week. But it said in a statement Tuesday that Serbian forces 
continue to shell, burn and raid ethnic Albanian villages. The statement, 
signed by the KLA main headquarters, called on all political parties 
``to create a government of national salvation to lead the negotiations 
for the independence of Kosovo.'' ``We will not accept that one party 
decides the fate of the nation of Kosovo,'' the statement in Albanian 
said. ``The existing group is unacceptable and we insist on their 
withdrawal from the negotiations.'' Adem Demaci, a politician who 
says his views reflect those of the KLA, said Kosovo was entering 
``a new day, a new situation, new circumstances,'' but said he couldn't 
guarantee the KLA cease-fire would continue. ``It is the turn of the 
(Serb) police and military forces to prove'' they will also adhere 
to a cease-fire, he said. Not surprisingly, the most optimistic note 
was struck by Veljko Odalovic, the Serb governor of the Kosovo region 
around Pristina. ``NATO and the international community are knocking 
on an open door,'' he said. ``There are no clashes. We are employing 
our utmost effort to normalizing conditions. Displaced persons are 
going back to their homes. Through humanitarian centers and other 
efforts we are trying to enhance the return of life in villages which 
people have fled.''
