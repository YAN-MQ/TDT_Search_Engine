Seven months and a lot of accounting problems after Cendant Corp. 
beat out the big insurer, American International Group, in a bruising 
battle to buy American Bankers Insurance Group, Cendant announced 
Tuesday that the $3.1 billion deal was off. For its trouble, American 
Bankers, which specializes in life insurance on credit card balances, 
will get $400 million as a breakup fee, the companies said. Henry 
Silverman, chief executive of Cendant, a franchising and discount 
shopping company, said the deal ``no longer made strategic or financial 
sense.'' The breakup was clearly the result of terrible times for 
Cendant, which disclosed in April, a month after its successful bid 
for American Bankers, that its earnings reports had been greatly inflated 
by improper accounting procedures. Just last week Cendant called off 
its $219 million purchase of Providian Auto and Home Insurance Co., 
a unit of Aegon NV. By the close of the market Tuesday, shares of 
Cendant, which owns brands like Century 21 real estate and Avis car 
rentals, were trading at $9.4375, down from a high of about $42 when 
it was in the midst of its battle for American Bankers. Moreover, 
Moody's Investors Service had only the day before lowered Cendant's 
financial ratings a notch so that borrowing would become more expensive 
for Cendant. ``What we're looking at here is a company with a broken 
story, pressure on its financial ratings and an uncertain future,'' 
said Kenneth Zuckerberg, an analyst at Keefe, Bruyette &AMP; Woods. 
After American International Group had signed an agreement to pay 
$47 a share for American Bankers, Silverman came in with a hostile 
bid of $58. Maurice Greenberg, chief executive of American International 
Group, matched the $58 bid. But he gave way when Silverman raised 
his offer to $67 a share; 51 percent in cash, the balance in stock. 
To go through with the deal at Tuesday's prices, Silverman would have 
had to give American Bankers three times more Cendant shares than 
originally anticipated or a lot more cash. He would have been constrained 
from giving more shares, analysts said, because the effect would have 
been to further dilute Cendant's sagging earnings per share. ``Cendant 
could afford to do the deal when it had a high-octane stock,'' Zuckerberg 
said. ``Now they would have to use more cash and with the cost of 
funds going up, that would have been very expensive for them.'' The 
accounting problems were discovered in what had been parts of a company 
known as CUC International, with which Silverman merged his former 
company, HFS Inc., to form Cendant last December. CUC, which specialized 
in discount shopping clubs, sold its products through lists of credit 
card holders just as American Bankers does. So Silverman saw a good 
strategic fit. But as more details of the accounting problems became 
public, Walter Forbes, chairman of Cendant, and eight other executives 
who had essentially created CUC, resigned from Cendant, changing what 
Silverman referred to Tuesday as the ``strategic premise'' for the 
American Bankers acquisition. Some analysts said they thought that 
American International might make a renewed bid for American Bankers. 
But a spokesman for American International would not comment. Barbara 
Blanco, an investor relations representative for American Bankers, 
said senior executives were traveling and not available to discuss 
the breakup or the company's future. Its shares, which had risen to 
$66.16, closed Tuesday at $36. On Sept. 30, Cendant reported that 
after a reexamination of its books, the company lost $217.2 million 
in 1997 instead of the $55.5 million in profits it reported before 
the accounting problems surfaced. After the close of the market Tuesday, 
Cendant and American Bankers issued a two-paragraph announcement that 
the deal was off. Then Cendant issued a second, lengthy statement 
saying it planned to buy back $1 billion of its own stock, a step 
often taken to bolster share prices and investor confidence. Silverman 
has rapidly expanded his business empire through a series of acquisitions. 
But, at least for the moment, his days as a flamboyant buyer seem 
over. ``We have articulated to the equity and credit markets that 
we are no longer going to be a seller of shares and a buyer of companies,'' 
he said, ``but a seller of companies and a buyer of our own shares.''
