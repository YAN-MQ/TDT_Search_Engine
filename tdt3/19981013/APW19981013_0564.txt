Faced with an almost blanket international ban on euthanasia, advocates 
of assisted suicide are trying to promote their demands that terminally 
ill people be allowed to ``die with dignity.'' Delegates at the biennial 
conference of the World Federation of Right to Die Societies say they 
expect no quick legal or medical solutions because of opposition from 
most church groups and political leaders. But they maintain that it 
is outdated and unjustifiable to insist that patients in dire pain 
and with no hope of a cure should carry on living. ``If you want to 
have a good death at the end of a good life, that choice should be 
open to you,'' said Jean Davies Wright, from Britain's euthanasia 
society, at a press conference Tuesday. ``People are prevented from 
dying from causes like they would have done a generation ago. They 
are dying slowly and they don't like it,'' she said. ``Dogs wouldn't 
be allowed to suffer like this.'' European pro-euthanasia groups plan 
to lobby the European Parliament for a resolution that the ``right 
to choose a dignified death should be a basic human right,'' Davies 
Wright said. Within Europe, the Netherlands has the most relaxed legal 
approach. Voluntary euthanasia _ whereby the physician administers 
a lethal injection to a patient _ and assisted suicide _ where the 
patient takes drugs prescribed by the doctor _ are technically illegal. 
But as long as doctors follow established guidelines, they escape 
prosecution. According to Dutch government figures, some 3,200 deaths 
were due to euthanasia in 1995 _ out of a total of 138,000 from all 
causes. This was the same level as five years previously. In Switzerland, 
it is illegal for doctors to administer fatal injections. But doctors 
and _ uniquely _ lay persons can assist suicide and there have been 
no cases of prosecution. The Swiss right to die society _ or Exit 
_ helps about 120 terminally ill people each year to die. The majority 
of them are cancer sufferers. The applicant has to be at least 18, 
mentally competent and suffering from intolerable health problems. 
According to the Exit manual, an Exit counselor visits the applicant 
on the appointed date, accompanied by a close relative. Patients are 
given a barbiturate dissolved in water which they drink themselves. 
In most other European countries the legal waters are muddier. Two 
doctors in the United Kingdom and Norway go on trial this week for 
helping in the death of terminally ill patients.
