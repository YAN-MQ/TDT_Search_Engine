As is always the case, now is the time members of Congress are trying 
to slip in specific spending items to benefit their own districts. 
Here are a couple of examples tonight. $10 million to subsidize the 
sale of tobacco overseas. Good for tobacco farmers. Senator Faircloth 
from North Carolina wants this. Trent Lott and his Mississippi colleague 
Thad Cochran want $300 million to reimburse exporters of frozen chickens. 
The chickens were shipped to Russia, but the Russians couldn't pay 
for them. And, senators Lott and Cochran also want money to extend 
their state's duck hunting season. Special time.
