Capitol Hill is working through triple overtime to finalize the federal 
budget. Negotiators are trying to piece together the eight remaining 
spending bills before the latest funding extension runs out Wednesday 
night. The two sides have agreed to spend an additional $1.1 billion 
on education, but they still disagree on who should control the spending. 
Republicans want the money sent directly as block grants to school 
districts. President Clinton and the democrats want the money to go 
through federal education programs. I don't really relish education 
as a partisan debate, because over the long run, that's not good for 
America. I don't have a clue whether these kids are democrats, republicans 
or independents. Frankly, I could care less. I want them to have the 
best. I want America's future to be the best. We are here fighting 
this fight because we have no other way, no other recourse, to prevail 
on this important issue. I guess I'm a little disappointed in the 
president. Who says unless you're willing to do everything my way, 
I will characterize you as being unwilling to do anything. Those are 
not the fair terms for a debate, and quite frankly, I have to say, 
Mr. president, you know better than that. You know how much our heart 
is in educating these children.
