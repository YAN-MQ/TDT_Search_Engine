It's time now for business news. Stock prices in New York moved somewhat 
lower Tuesday amid concerns about corporate earnings reports for the 
third quarter of the year. VOA's Joe Chapman is in New York and has 
the numbers. The Dow Jones Industrial Average closed down 63 points, 
less than 1 percent, at 7938. A more representative Standard & Poor's 
500 finished almost unchanged, down 2 points at 995. But the NASDAQ 
Composite, which includes many high-technology stocks, closed down 
36 points at 1509, as investors took profits from two days of gains. 
Eastman Kodak, one of 30 stocks in the Dow Jones Industrials, closed 
14 percent lower, exerting a strong downward pressure on the index. 
The big photography company exceeded Wall Street profit estimates 
by 1 cent a share. But analysts say investors expected more profit 
growth and continue to be concerned about the company's market share 
and revenues. Another factor in the negative cinema was the collapse 
of a merger between Monsanto, a biotech and chemical company, and 
American Home Products, a pharmaceuticals firm. Joe Chapman, VOA News, 
New York.
