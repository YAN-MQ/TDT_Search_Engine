Forest fires raged for a fourth straight day in northern and central 
Israel Tuesday, temporarily closing a major highway and forcing thousands 
of residents to leave their homes. Fires in the Carmel forests blazed 
out of control near the northern port city of Haifa and residents 
of three nearby villages evacuated the area, some for the second time 
in two days. Hundreds of prisoners were evacuated from two large jails 
in the north. In the Western Galilee, fire destroyed 25 acres (100 
dunams) of forest, Israel radio said. Israeli fire fighters worked 
non-stop with little success to quell the blazes. Three fire fighter 
planes from Greece were to arrive Wednesday to help, Israel TV said. 
In the hills near Jerusalem, fires smoldering since Monday intensified, 
sending thick clouds of smoke toward the Jerusalem-Tel Aviv highway 
on Tuesday and briefly forcing the closure of the major thoroughfare. 
Meanwhile, a court on Tuesday extended the arrest of three Israeli 
Arab youths being held on suspicion of having set fire to wilderness 
areas near Wadi Ara in northern Israel. Earlier this month, Wadi Ara 
was the site of clashes between Israeli Arabs and police over a land 
dispute. Officials said most of the other blazes were started accidentally 
by picnickers who left coals burning in the forest while visiting 
during the Jewish holiday of Sukkot that ended Monday. Unseasonably 
hot, dry conditions and strong winds in the region also helped the 
fires to spread.
