General Motors Corp. lost $809 million in the third quarter, mainly 
because of a nearly eight-week-long strike that ended on July 29 and 
crippled GM's production in North America, the automaker announced 
Tuesday. GM's loss of $1.28 a diluted share was slightly better than 
analysts' expectations. The company's North American operations continued 
to cut costs aggressively, paying less for auto parts and making factories 
more efficient. But Tuesday's report also showed that the company 
had been discounting its vehicles heavily in North America while its 
foreign operations were beginning to suffer from economic troubles 
overseas. Auto analysts said that the strike at two GM auto parts 
factories in Flint had caused so much disruption that it was hard 
to draw firm conclusions from the quarter's results. ``The best thing 
about the third quarter is it's over,'' said Michael Ward, an analyst 
at Paine Webber. ``Going forward, the news should get more positive.'' 
GM said the strike cost it $1.2 billion in the third quarter, the 
same amount it lost to the strike during the second quarter. Michael 
Losh, GM's chief financial officer, said in a telephone interview 
that the $2.4 billion in after-tax losses from the strike should be 
pared to roughly $2 billion by the end of the year as factories continue 
to work overtime to make up lost production. GM earned $1.04 billion 
during the third quarter of 1997, or $1.34 a share, but those figures 
included aerospace operations that GM has since sold. Excluding the 
aerospace operations, the strike and a $271 million after-tax charge 
for the disposal of some auto parts factories, GM's profits fell 28.4 
percent during the third quarter, to $697 million, compared with $973 
million in the quarter a year earlier. GM's sales in the third quarter 
plunged to $34.42 billion, from $41.89 billion in the quarter a year 
earlier, partly because some operations were sold but mainly because 
of the strike. Losh said that with the third quarter behind it, GM 
was well positioned for the fourth quarter. The introductions of new 
pickup trucks in North America and the new Opel Astra sedan in Europe 
were expensive during the third quarter but should start helping the 
automaker's results, he said. While GM spent an unusually high average 
of $1,732 a vehicle in discounts in the North American market during 
the third quarter, that figure fell to $1,400 for sales at the end 
of September, Losh said. Full-sized pickup trucks require virtually 
no discounts to sell, and GM had very few of them until the end of 
the quarter because it was changing the design. The weakening of the 
dollar this month may also make it harder for foreign automakers to 
offer discounts, easing the pressure on GM to provide large discounts. 
``One of the things that ought to help us is the yen is not 135 or 
145'' to the dollar, Losh said. The dollar was trading at 119.15 yen 
late Tuesday in New York. Financial analysts generally accepted GM's 
predictions that with the strike more than two months in the past, 
discounts might dwindle. ``Once you get your '98 models cleared out 
and your floor traffic back, then you can cut the incentives,'' said 
Greg Salchow, an auto analyst at Roney &AMP; Co., a brokerage house 
here. Investors had little reaction Tuesday to GM's results. Shares 
of GM fell 87.5 cents, to $51.0625, in a falling market. GM announced 
plans in August to sell or spin off a 20 percent stake in Delphi Automotive 
Systems, its huge auto parts subsidiary, early next year, and Losh 
reaffirmed those plans Tuesday. GM's longstanding intention to wait 
until next year may allow enough time for financial markets to settle 
down, he said. The strike pushed GM's cash reserves down to $11.5 
billion on Sept. 30 from $14.6 billion a year earlier and $12.1 billion 
on June 30. Losh said that GM expected the reserves to rebound soon 
to the company's target of $13 billion. When that happens, GM will 
resume the $4 billion share buyback program that it announced in March 
and suspended last summer in response to the strike, he added. One 
of the sharpest tumbles in GM's earnings occurred in the unit handling 
automotive operations in Latin America, Africa and the Middle East. 
Mainly because of the high interest rates and weak economy in Brazil, 
previously one of GM's most profitable markets, the division reported 
a loss in the third quarter of $64 million after a $165 million after-tax 
profit a year earlier. GM automotive operations in Europe earned $50 
million in the third quarter after losing $21 million in the quarter 
a year earlier. GM's tiny Asian automotive division made $2 million 
in profits in the last three months after losing $7 million in the 
third quarter of last year. General Motors Acceptance Corp., which 
makes car loans and leases, earned $313 million in the third quarter, 
virtually unchanged from a $312 million gain in the quarter a year 
earlier.
