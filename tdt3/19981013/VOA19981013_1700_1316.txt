A fight is planned for early next year to unify the major world heavyweight 
boxing titles held by American Evander Holyfield and Britain's Lennox 
Lewis. Holyfield's promoter, Don King, met in London with Lewis's 
manager, Frank Maloney, and the two confirmed an agreement. Maloney 
said the bout would probably be staged in Las Vegas in February or 
March. Holyfield holds the World Boxing Association and International 
Boxing Federation titles, while Lewis owns the World Boxing Council 
championship. The last undisputed world heavyweight champion was American 
Riddick Bowe nearly six years ago. Holyfield is expected to make $20 
million, while Lewis is set to earn $8 million. The boxers still have 
to agree to the terms. That's sports. I'm Jim Stevenson.
