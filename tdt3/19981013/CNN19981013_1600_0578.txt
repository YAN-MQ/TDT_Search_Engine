kohn of U.C. Santa Barbara for developing density-functional theory. 
Kohn shares the award with British citizen John pople of northwestern 
University, who developed computational methods in Quantum chemistry. 
The laureates in physics are Robert laughlin, Daniel tsui and German 
citizen horst stoermer. The professors are cited for discovering how 
electrons can change their behavior. In each case, they will share 
the $978,000 prizes.
