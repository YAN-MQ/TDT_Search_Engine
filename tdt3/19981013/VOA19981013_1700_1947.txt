Israel's prime minister says there is no chance of signing an interim 
peace deal with the Palestinians at this week's summit in the United 
States unless the Palestinians honor their security commitments. Benjamin 
Netanyahu's office made the statement after an Israeli man was shot 
dead and another was wounded west of Jerusalem. Israeli police believe 
the attackers were Palestinians. State Department spokesman James 
Rubin says there are no guarantees this week's summit will produce 
an agreement. There are a large number of hurdles that have to be 
overcome if we're going to get an agreement, and we do believe we've 
put ourselves in a better position to get that agreement as a result 
of the work that we've done in the last week. But such an agreement 
is, by no means, a sure thing. State Department spokesman James Rubin.
