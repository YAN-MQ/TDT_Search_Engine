the day's top stories are next. still ahead in consumer news -- a 
carmaker is ending its tenure as a solely u.s. company with a financial 
bang. and later -- one of the world's best known music stars gives 
opera a try. after his heart attack, ed's doctor told him to exercise 
and take aspirin regularly. so he takes genuine bayer aspirin to help 
prevent a second heart attack. but then there are those days when 
ed's muscles ache and ed could use extra strength bayer. nothing is 
stronger for pain. you don't need tylenol, because... how are your 
legs? great! race you home!
