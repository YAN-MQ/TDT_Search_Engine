The Philippines has begun evacuating Filipino citizens and their dependents 
from Yugoslavia in anticipation of NATO air strikes, the Philippine 
foreign office said Tuesday. Foreign Secretary Domingo Siazon said 
he has instructed Philippine posts in Austria and Hungary to accept 
evacuees from Yugoslavia as Friday's deadline for Yugoslav President 
Slobodan Milosevic over Kosovo nears. The 16-nation alliance is urging 
Milosevic to end his crackdown against ethnic Albanians and cooperate 
in efforts to restore normalcy to the southern Serbian province. Siazon 
said there are 20 Filipinos in Yugoslavia and they will be brought 
to the Yugoslav-Hungarian border. They will be led out by a Filipino 
refugee volunteer working in Kosovo. He said the Filipinos will be 
flown back to the Philippines. Most foreign missions in Belgrade have 
been scaling down their embassy staff.
