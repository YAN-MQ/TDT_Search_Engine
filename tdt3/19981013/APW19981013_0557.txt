Rupert Murdoch may be negotiating a multimillion book and television 
deal to get Monica Lewinsky to tell all about her relationship with 
President Bill Clinton _ but the media magnate says Americans could 
care less about politicians. ``As far as the American political scene 
goes, people are doing so well they don't really want to know about 
politicians,'' Murdoch said Tuesday after the annual general meeting 
of his Australian-based News Corp. Murdoch, who renounced the citizenship 
of his native Australia to become a U.S. citizen, said he predicted 
a record low voter turnout for congressional elections in November. 
Asked if Clinton should resign or stand aside as a result of the saga 
involving Lewinsky, Murdoch said: ``I never thought whether he ought 
to or not. I'm sure he won't.'' News Corp. subsidiary Fox TV confirmed 
last week it was in discussion with representatives of Lewinsky, but 
refused to confirm details. Trade newspaper Daily Variety reported 
that News Corp. had offered Lewinsky a deal for a ``multimedia tell-all 
package,'' involving a television interview and a book that was worth 
dlrs 3 million. The talks were reported on the day the U.S. House 
of Representatives authorized an impeachment inquiry of Clinton. The 
consequences of the inquiry range from a rebuke to removal from office. 
Murdoch also said he accepted increased media interest in his own 
private life, saying: ``I think it goes with the territory.'' Murdoch 
has been subjected to Paparazzi-like scrutiny since he reportedly 
began a relationship with Wendy Deng, a vice-president of News Corp.'s 
Hong Kong-based Star TV satellite network. Murdoch and Deng were recently 
photographed together on a yacht owned by the billionaire on the Italian 
island of Sardinia. The reports follow the collapse of his 30-year 
marriage to novelist and philanthropist Anna Murdoch, who filed for 
divorce in April citing irreconcilable differences. News Corp. owns 
the Twentieth Century Fox studio, Fox network, the Los Angeles Dodgers, 
New York Post, the HarperCollins book publisher and newspapers in 
Britain and Australia.
