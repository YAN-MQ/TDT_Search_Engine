New research indicates girls may be closing the gap with boys in math 
and science. The American association of University women issued a 
report today that shows girls are taking more courses in those fields 
and enrolling in more advanced placement courses in English, biology, 
and languages. But the organization warns girls are lagging in computer 
skills. It says many girls are taking computer classes that don't 
teach as many skills as the ones chosen by boys.
