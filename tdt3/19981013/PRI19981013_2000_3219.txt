A clean and well-groomed cow, as most of us already know, is a happy 
cow, and a happy cow gives more milk. That is the thinking behind 
a new German invention, The Bovine Massage Machine. The head of the 
team which developed the device, Dr. Yorkst Vollenborg, says it is 
just a mechanical version of what comes naturally. When you are looking 
into nature what an animal is doing, you will see that they are doing 
their massage by themselves. They are going to and doing that with 
the head and with the legs, with the body and so on. And why not doing 
that in the barns? And one of the parts of the barn is for this massage 
and for the cleaning and so on. The machine acts a little like a car 
wash and it is installed in the barn for the cows to use at their 
leisure. Some go in there five to ten times a day and some are going 
two times a day. Cows are very individual animals and some are going 
more and some are going less. The team at the Hosenberg Agricultural 
Research Center has also developed a cow waterbed. So, how is all 
this going down in the field? Farmer Peter Yanshawer and his heard 
say it is, brace yourself, udderly divine. The cows are happier, they 
are more contented, they do not itch any more, and they do not just 
wander into the machine by chance, they are queuing up to get in there. 
And while they are in the machine, their eyes are sparkling and they 
are jigging around. It is almost as if they are dancing a samba.
