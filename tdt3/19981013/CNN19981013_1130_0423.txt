NASA's Mars global surveyor is sending back images of a violent planet. 
The spacecraft orbiting Mars has clocked winds at 350 miles an hour. 
It's also seen evidence of flooding a thousand times greater than 
any on earth. Planetary scientists say the water may have resulted 
from an asteroid impact. They say photos show that floodwaters exploded 
from craters at 100 miles per hour and carved canyons in a matter 
of weeks.
