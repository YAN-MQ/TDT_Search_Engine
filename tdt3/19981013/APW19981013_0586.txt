Russia's state arms exporter will make dlrs 1.2 billion more in sales 
this year than in 1997, the company's director said Tuesday. Rosvooruzheniye 
chief Yevgeny Ananyev also said the 1998 revenues will be dlrs 1.7 
billion more than in 1996, the Interfax news agency reported. He refused 
to provide the total figure. Although well down from Soviet levels, 
Russia is one of the world's top four arms exporters, supplying relatively 
inexpensive weapons with a reputation for reliability. With the Russian 
economy in crisis, arms exports are among the country's few steady 
sources of hard currency and one of the few sectors where Russian 
industry continues to operate efficiently.
