Most parents of small children know the painful stressful toll of 
ear infections all too well. What if there was a way to prevent them? 
Researchers are studying an experimental vaccine that may protect 
children from a type of bacteria called pneumocaucus, the most common 
cause of ear infections of children. The vaccine isn't perfect. There 
are over 80 types of pneumocaucus. The vaccine covers seven. Those 
seven types are responsible for about 85% of severe diseases and about 
65% of middle ear infections. So it will help enormously, but it's 
not going to eliminate all infections. Studies on the vaccine continue 
and it could be available in two to five years.
