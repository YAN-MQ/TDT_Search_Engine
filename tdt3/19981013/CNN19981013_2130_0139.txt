In Washington, budget talks could continue through the night. So far, 
lawmakers have agreed on just 5 of the 13 spending bills to fund the 
government. Jonathan Karl has more on the last-minute wrangling. Both 
congressional republicans and the White House now say they are not 
optimistic about striking a speedy budget deal. I hope late tonight 
we'll be done. But these are serious policy issues, and we're going 
to stay until we get it done. There are big philosophical differences 
on how this budget should be spent. But negotiators have tentatively 
agreed to most of the White House's demands, including U.N. funding 
and $1.1 billion in added educational spending, although significant 
differences remain on how that education money will be spent. Negotiators 
have also tentatively agreed on a number of major points, including 
more than $15 billion in emergency funding for agriculture, the Y2K 
computer problem and defense. To pay for some of the new spending, 
the White House presented Congress with $4.3 billion in off-setting 
spending cuts. But even as negotiators came to agreement behind closed 
doors, the partisan attacks continued before the cameras. This is 
the worst Congress that's ever been in the building. They have not 
done their work and now they want to get everything done in one Bill 
in the last five minutes. Once a spending deal is finalized, Congress 
will leave Washington with a number of top priorities for both parties 
undone, including -- enacting an $80 billion tax cut, reforming managed 
health care, rewriting bankruptcy and campaign finance laws, and enacting 
legislation to reduce teen smoking. The signature achievement for 
both the White House and Congress is the $70 billion budget surplus. 
But republicans say that at least $15 billion of that will now be 
erased to pay for the emergency spending measures. The major sticking 
point continues to be education. Although both sides have agreed to 
$1.1 billion in added spending, they disagree over who should control 
it. The White House wants it to pay for 100,000 new teachers. Republicans 
are insisting on some state control over the money. Jonathan Karl,
