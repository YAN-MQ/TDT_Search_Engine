At 30 minutes after the hour, our coverage continues. Most of the 
troops are from the U.S. army base at fort Stewart, Georgia. Kenley 
Jones, what's going on there this evening? About 3,000 members of 
the third infranty division are ready to move out as soon as they 
get orders to deploy. They have not come yet, but are expected. A 
trip-off is that the army chief of staff is scheduled here tomorrow 
morning to talk to the troops. He's not coming for a social call. 
Presumably, he will tell them what their mission will be when he reach 
the persian gulf. Soldiers have been getting ready to leave the past 
couple of days, get yg field equipment ready. A lot of heavy equipment 
there is not much that will be needed to be transported. This mainly 
will be transporting men. The tanks and Bradley fighting vehicles 
and one 55 millimeter are already in the Persian gulf. There are others 
already in Kuwait. They have been there on an ongoing training exercise. 
Number one, it gives experience in desert warfare and serve as protection 
of Kuwait in the event of Iraqi attack. These extra troops will bolster 
that protection. Not only in Georgia, but all over the country, troops 
have been getting ready to move out to perform a variety of jobs, 
radar surveillance technicians, communications technicians, even troops 
who are getting ready to give the troops there E-mail capability, 
modern-day warfare is employing cyberspace. As far as the aircraft 
that are going over, about 12 B-52's are going over. Then about the 
same number of stealth fighters have been moved over there they are 
capable of those pinpoint strikes which they were so successful with 
in 1991. During the gulf war, this base, fort Stewart, was the home 
of the 24th infrantry division, mechanized. They were one of the key 
elements in the pove on Baghdad toward the end of the war. They were 
well within striking distance when the war ended and they were pulled 
back. Many military men here still are convinced in they had gone 
ahead then thrks trip now would not have been necessary. Brian? Kenley 
Jones at fort Stewart, Georgia. The site of a lot of activity tonight 
and tomorrow morning.
