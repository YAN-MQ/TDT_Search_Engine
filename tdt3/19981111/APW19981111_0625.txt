Switzerland's embassy in London on Wednesday handed over a formal 
request for the extradition of former Chilean dictator Augusto Pinochet, 
the Swiss Office of Police Affairs said. The office last week said 
Switzerland had prepared the official request but was awaiting a similar 
move from Spain before passing it on to Britain. Switzerland says 
the Spanish effort to extradite Pinochet should be given priority. 
Pinochet was arrested at a London clinic last month on an arrest warrant 
from Spanish magistrate Baltasar Garzon, who is seeking his extradition 
on charges of genocide, torture and terrorism during his 17-year rule 
which ended 1990. Switzerland subsequently requested Pinochet's arrest 
with a view to extradition on charges of murder, kidnapping and torture. 
The move followed a criminal complaint filed in Geneva by the widow 
of Alexis Jaccard, a student of Swiss-Chilean dual nationality who 
disappeared in Argentina in May 1977. Britain's highest court, the 
House of Lords, is considering an appeal against an Oct. 28 ruling 
by the High Court that Pinochet has diplomatic immunity as a former 
foreign head of state.
