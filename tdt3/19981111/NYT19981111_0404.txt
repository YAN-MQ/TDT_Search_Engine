Financial turmoil makes every meeting of the Federal Reserve an occasion 
for frenzied speculation about interest rate cuts. Wall Street turns 
out daily tomes of advice, mostly calling on the Fed to knock rates 
down a few pegs. ``Don't stop treatment until the patient is cured,'' 
Robert Barbera and Jose Rasco of Hoenig &AMP; Co., for example, recently 
warned the Fed. ``We see additional ease as absolutely necessary to 
prevent deflationary pressures.'' Strong words. But the simple fact 
is that nothing the Fed decides at its next meeting, on Tuesday, will 
matter very much. Not that the Fed isn't very important in setting 
the monetary climate for the economy. But if it moves at all, it will 
surely move very little. No one need lose sleep worrying about whether 
the Fed will stand pat or drop short-term interest rates another quarter 
percentage point. The Fed's basic problem is that economists never 
know whether a recession is around the corner. Nor can they pinpoint 
the impact of cuts in short-term interest rates _ the only ones the 
Fed controls _ even on long-term rates, much less on spending, prices 
and employment. That puts Fed Chairman Alan Greenspan and his colleagues 
in the position of guessing a lot. No wonder Greenspan's testimony 
invariably retreats into amorphous conversation about balancing of 
risks. In an unpredictable world, the Fed deliberates which course 
of action _ in next week's case, a small easing or standing pat _ 
poses the graver economic risk. The case for cutting rates starts 
with the fact that the economy is slowing and could use a nudge. Exports 
of tractors and other manufactured goods are plummeting. Employment 
in manufacturing fell by 50,000 jobs last quarter, and has shrunk 
by more than 200,000 since January. Service jobs are picking up the 
slack, but growth is expected to fall to around 1.5 percent. Meanwhile, 
productivity rose at a gaudy annualized rate of 2.3 percent last quarter, 
meaning that companies can raise wages without having to raise prices 
_ a brake on inflation that gives the Fed room to ease. The best case 
for easing is made by Professor Alan Blinder of Princeton, a former 
vice chairman of the Fed. Blinder concedes that the Fed's two earlier 
rate cuts this year have calmed financial markets. A measure of investor 
fear _ the gap between interest rates that investors charge risky 
corporate borrowers and safe government borrowers _ has shrunk since 
Greenspan by word and deed told investors he would not allow the economy 
to starve for credit. But the gap, Blinder says, remains well above 
the historical norm for an economy that continues to grow respectably. 
Blinder focuses on the ``real'' federal funds rate, which subtracts 
the expected rate of inflation from the interest rate that banks charge 
each other for overnight loans. Today, the real funds rate is, by 
Blinder's analysis, quite high, in excess of 2.5 percent. ``That puts 
a mild tug on growth,'' he said. The tug made sense when the economy 
was roaring along. But ``now that the economy is visibly slowing,'' 
Blinder said, ``it is appropriate to turn the Fed's mild tug on the 
economy into at least a neutral stance whereby monetary policy is 
no longer holding the economy back.'' Still, Blinder is not calling 
on the Fed to do anything bold. He notes that there is a risk of too 
much monetary ease, primarily in the fueling of a still-overheated 
stock market. Professor Benjamin Friedman of Harvard University makes 
the best case for standing pat. He does not strongly oppose a quarter-point 
rate cut. But neither is he enthusiastic. ``The problem of the American 
economy _ investors that are too scared to lend _ will not be cured 
by modest interest rate cuts,'' he said. Friedman fears that investors 
are coming to depend on a steady diet of rate cuts, in which case 
the Fed risks trapping itself either in meeting those expectations 
or touching off a harsh response on stock and bond markets if it disappoints 
them. ``If one cut leads to another,'' he added, ``the Fed will wind 
up cutting rates by a percentage point or more, satisfying the expectation 
of bond traders along the way but risking overstimulating the economy 
and driving the stock market to unrealistic new highs.'' Frederic 
Mishkin of Columbia University says that rising stock prices and low 
unemployment rates weaken the case for easing. He applauded Greenspan 
for moving early to ward off the impact of financial turmoil abroad, 
thus proving ``that the Fed would not repeat the mistakes of Japan, 
where monetary authorities have sat back while the economy sank.'' 
But, he warns, the threat of inflation should not be casually dismissed. 
``The Fed has sometimes overly stimulated the economy when it was 
weak and triggered rising inflation that eventually forced the Fed 
to crack down hard, sending the economy into reverse,'' he said. Using 
Greenspan's terminology, Mishkin concluded that ``the current balance 
of risks is balanced.'' The upshot is that the case for further cuts 
next week is tentative on either side of the ledger. Indeed, even 
the Wall Street experts who call on the Fed to cut rates to save the 
economy may exercise a different judgment when they invest. Based 
on bets that investors are making on the course of federal funds rate 
in the next several weeks, Bridgewater Associates calculates that 
investors set the probability of a Fed easing next week at about 50 
percent. Apparently, when Wall Street experts vote with money, they 
judge the case for Fed easing a tossup.
