We take another look at genetic engineering. What can be done, already 
is in many case as stonding. The drug company chyron said it is testing 
a genetically engineered protein which they believe will enable them 
to make new blood vessels. It might be enormously effective against 
heart disease. The drug companies in general have a huge stake in 
genetics. Here's ABC's Bill Blakemore. Millennium pharmaceuticals 
is part of a modern day gold rush, find the genes that cause disease. 
All the way from cancer to osteoporosis to asthma to schizophrenia, 
depression. It's a scramble by the world's drug companies. They're 
spending billions of dollars and creating some of the highest technology 
known to science. Robots that can sort out thousands of different 
genes from one diseased organ in a matter of hours. And other machines 
that can read those genes. So this describes a specific Gene? This 
is a specific Gene. It's represented here. a-g-c-t. You're reading 
a Gene. When they find a Gene that triggers a disease, they rush to 
claim it. The potential profits are so great, drug companies have 
swamped the U.S. patent office with thousands of applications for 
sole rights to genes they've discovered. But the business risks are 
also great. It can take three years and many millions of dollars to 
find a Gene that causes disease. And even when they find one, they're 
still only halfway there. They now have to find a drug to affect that 
Gene. In these freezers, they have samples of more than 2 million 
different chemicals. Dozens of those chemicals may be the basis of 
cures for our worst diseases. The challenge is to match the right 
chemical to the right disease. So they test each chemical on the guilty 
Gene, hoping one will have an effect on it. We have a great hit right 
here. The hit, if we're lucky, will become a drug. Producing just 
one successful drug may take 10 to 15 years and cost $500 million. 
Not even one genomic drug is on the market yet. But the companies 
are lured by a vision of medicine transformed. Some day we're all 
going to be able to walk into the doctor's office, they're going to 
have our genome on a chip and they're going to say that you have certain 
tendencies toward certain diseases. Then, the hope is, drug companies 
will produce exactly the medicine you need. With great rewards for 
the companies, and all of us, if it works. Bill Blakemore, ABC News, 
Cambridge, Massachusetts.
