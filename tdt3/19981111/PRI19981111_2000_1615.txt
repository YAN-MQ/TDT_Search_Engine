The Dow Jones Industrials closed today down 40 points to 8824. The 
NASDAQ, down 3 points to 1862. If you thought the global economic 
crisis would keep companies for looking for profits outside the United 
States, think again. The World's Patrick O'Connel has the story from 
our business desk in New York. While investors have been running for 
shelter from the global financial storm, big companies appear to be 
setting records in the amount they are investing overseas. The research 
by the United Nations Conference on Trade and Development has found 
a significant increase in the number of companies expanding beyond 
their national borders. The author of the report is George cal. Big 
corporations continue to invest even in those countries which are 
most affected by the financial crisis. Foreign product investment 
has continued to grow. It has now exceeded the $400 billion level 
in terms of outflows. And we predict that for this year, this figure 
will even by surpassed further. United States is still the number 
one spot so far this year. It has attracted $91 billion worth of foreign 
investment. Most comes from the European union with Germany, France, 
Switzerland and the Netherlands topping the lead. But it is also number 
one in the other direction, too. U.S. companies spent more than $100 
billion expanding globally this year. So, what does it all mean for 
the consumer? George Cal believes it is good news. Just having more 
options to locate production different places and putting benefits 
associated with location or advantages that reduces costs to some 
extent that is being passed on to consumers. According to the report, 
all this activity is continuing despite the global economic crisis. 
Although in the long-term, George Cal believes the focus of investment 
is expected to shift with firms looking again towards developed countries 
rather than the Asian and Pacific regions. For The World, I am Patrick 
O'Connel at the Business Desk in New York.
