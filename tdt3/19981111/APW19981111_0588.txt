The Indonesian government is preparing to offer a tax holiday for 
investors in refinery projects, especially outside the main island 
of Java, a senior official said Wednesday. ``Indonesia wants to encourage 
foreign investors, particularly those from the Middle East countries, 
to develop refineries in Indonesia,'' Minister of Investment Hamzah 
Haz said after a meeting with President B.J. Habibie. He said the 
plan, expected to be finalized by the end of this month, will provide 
tax reductions for 10 to 12 years. Hamzah said 16 investors from the 
Middle East have expressed interest so far but only one, from Kuwait, 
has declared a serious intent, to develop a refinery on Selayar Island 
in southeastern Sulawesi. He quoted the Kuwaiti investor as saying 
the prices of his refinery's products could be 30 percent lower than 
those of Indonesia's state-owned Pertamina oil company. Hamzah said 
he has agreed to review monopoly rights given to Pertamina to sell 
fuel in the country.
