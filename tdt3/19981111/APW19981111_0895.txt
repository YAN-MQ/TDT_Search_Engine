A bus rolled down a mountain in a remote northeastern state Wednesday, 
killing at least 40 passengers, a domestic news agency reported. The 
bus fell down a gorge near Pachin Koto village in Arunachal Pradesh 
that borders China and Myanmar. The accident occurred when the bus 
was making a sharp turn on the narrow mountain road, Press Trust of 
India news agency reported. Details of the accident were sketchy because 
of poor communications in the area, which is about 1,750 (1, 085 miles) 
southeast of New Delhi.
