After a warning from the United States that a military strike on Baghdad 
may be imminent, the United Nations abruptly evacuated more than 230 
foreign staff members from Iraq on Wednesday, including all weapons 
inspectors. Another 41 people from various agencies will depart on 
Thursday, leaving only essential officials behind. Russia, angry that 
there had been no consultation with all Security Council members before 
a decision was made to withdraw the arms inspectors, called a meeting 
of the council to demand an explanation from the chief inspector, 
Richard Butler. Secretary-General Kofi Annan _ who went to Baghdad 
in February and persuaded Iraq to back down in the face of an earlier 
American threat _ said in Morocco Wednesday that he was cutting short 
a North African trip to return to New York on Thursday. But Annan 
has no plans to go to Baghdad or meet Iraqi officials here, his spokesman, 
Fred Eckhard, said. In Marrakesh, the secretary-general said that 
he was ``saddened and burdened by Iraq's decisions not to cooperate 
with U.N. weapons inspectors.'' Eckhard said that for now Annan's 
role would be ``to monitor the Security Council's deliberations, to 
confer with members of the council and basically to stay on top of 
what is developing as a crisis situation.'' Annan discussed the Iraqi 
crisis with a high-level Clinton administration official within the 
last 24 hours, his spokesman said. But the secretary-general has not 
been in direct contact with President Saddam Hussein, who agreed after 
meeting with Annan in February to give full access to inspectors. 
Annan's special envoy to Iraq, Prakash Shah, is staying in Baghdad. 
He was told again Wednesday by Deputy Prime Minister Tariq Aziz that 
the Iraqis would cooperate only when the Security Council acts to 
lift sanctions. The council is now unified in responding that this 
cannot happen until unfettered inspections resume. Butler, who is 
leaving behind a skeletal Iraqi staff, said he was confident that 
the equipment and documents that the inspectors left behind were safe. 
The monitoring center, on the edge of Baghdad, is lightly guarded. 
Inspectors from the International Atomic Energy Agency were also withdrawn, 
leaving the Baghdad monitoring center ``dead,'' an official said here 
Wednesday. The arms inspectors _ 92 from Unscom and 11 from the IAEA 
_ flew to Bahrain Wednesday morning on a U.N.-chartered C-130 aircraft. 
Iraq had tried to drive a wedge between the IAEA, which follows nuclear 
developments, and Unscom, which looks for biological, chemical and 
prohibited missile activity. Wednesday, the United Nations also withdrew 
from Iraq 130 staff members from agencies like Unicef, the World Health 
Organization, the U.N. Development Program and the World Food Program, 
as well as the staff of the ``oil for food'' office. Benon Sevan, 
the New York-based director of the Iraq oil for food program, said 
in a statement that in the Kurdish areas of northern Iraq, the 231 
foreign staff, which actually distributes goods, will remain in place, 
Sevan said.
