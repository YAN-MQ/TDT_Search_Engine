Within three seconds of logging on to America Online from her room 
on the Upper East Side in Manhattan, Debbie Shapiro, a junior at Stuyvesant 
High School, got an instant message from her best friend's brother's 
college roommate, who was on his dormitory room computer. ``Hey there, 
Deb,'' the message flashed, as the twinkle sound that accompanies 
every instant message alerted her to check her screen.``Hey,'' she 
fired back, rolling her eyes. ``This guy is always bugging me,'' she 
said to a companion. ``I don't know why. I have nothing to say to 
him.'' Before long, Debbie's computer screen was peppered with several 
more instant messages _ one from a friend wanting to know if any jocks 
had been at the party Debbie went to the night before, one from a 
classmate inquiring about math homework and one from a friend just 
wondering what was up. For the next half-hour, Debbie performed an 
epistolary juggling act that had her holding four different online 
conversations simultaneously. When Debbie's best friend called, Debbie 
picked up the cordless phone next to her computer, cradled it between 
her ear and shoulder to talk and continued typing. In the age of the 
household with a computer and multiple phone lines, the teen-ager 
who years ago would have secreted herself away in the closet with 
her Princess phone now has vastly expanded communications, thanks 
to America Online or other instant-message services. AOL began offering 
instant messages as soon as it signed up its first members, in 1985. 
But the service has now moved as far into the mainstream as MTV because 
it has been letting people outside AOL sign up for Instant Messenger 
since May 1997. At that point, 100 million instant messages were being 
sent by AOL members each day. Now that the service is open and free 
for anyone, AOL says, the number of daily messages is 200 million. 
Interviews with scores of teen-agers showed that AOL's Instant Messenger 
is indeed popular among that age group. And although adults debate 
whether impressionable adolescents should have unregulated Internet 
access, the main thing teen-agers seem to do when they log on for 
instant messages is use their keyboards to talk to their friends. 
It is difficult to move beyond anecdotal evidence of this phenomenon 
to specific numbers. AOL does not track the way teen-agers use the 
service. But many parents can testify that all of a house's telephone 
lines can be monopolized for hours at a time by teen-agers chatting 
on computers and telephones. ``Our peak hours are 8 to 11 p.m.,'' 
said an AOL spokeswoman, Pam McGraw. ``But we do know that when kids 
get home from school, they have a tendency to sign on and chat with 
their friends, just like they normally would have talked on the phone 
in the past.'' AOL added its Buddy List to Instant Messenger in February 
1996, and that has contributed to the huge increase in instant messaging 
among the under-18 set. Your Buddy List includes the online names 
of the people you want to exchange instant messages with; you are 
notified each time a person on your list goes on line, and those on 
your list are told when you go on line. Before the advent of the Buddy 
List, you had to type in someone's name to find out if that person 
was on line. Similar lists are now offered by other chat and instant-message 
services, like those offered by Yahoo, Excite, ICQ, Internet Relay 
Chat and Pow Wow. One reason for AOL's popularity among teen-agers 
may be the fact that a majority of parents with Internet access have 
AOL accounts. What urgent missives are imparted via instant messages 
that can't wait until the next school day? ``We complain about school 
mostly, and teachers and guys,'' said Sara Mulnix, a high-school sophomore 
from Herndon, Va., whose Buddy List runs 83 names long. She said she 
spendt two to three hours a week on line with friends. Jacob Scott, 
16, from Reading, Mass., said: ``I I-M friends about various social 
dilemmas, and all other kinds of craziness. It's a quicker way to 
get answers than calling someone on the phone.'' Some teen-agers use 
instant messages strictly to keep in touch with friends from summer 
camps or catch up with friends from old neighborhoods. ``I go on, 
read my mail, write back a couple of sentences and get off,'' said 
Sara Shepard, a sophomore at Trinity High School in New York City. 
``I used to be much more into it, but I don't have the time anymore.'' 
For other teen-agers, however, AOL's Instant Messenger system is nearly 
as important as the telephone. ``It's a big social tool,'' said Jocelyn 
Nubel, 15, of Northport, N.Y., adding that virtually everyone she 
knew at school and in her town had access to AOL's Instant Messenger. 
``To some extent, it takes the place of the phone. We'll all be at 
a party and when we leave, we say, `Bye, see you guys on AOL.' Then 
when I get home, at like 1 o'clock, I'll go on line and get all these 
instant messages. People asking me, `Did you have fun tonight?' `Who 
did you go with?' and `Did you hear about so-and-so?' '' Jocelyn said 
it was easier to approach boys on line than on the phone. ``You don't 
have to deal with the awkwardness of phone silence when you instant-message 
someone,'' she said. ``When you call someone, it's more personal. 
If I I-M someone, it's not such a big deal because that's what everybody 
does. You can get the general stuff about each other out of the way 
so when you see him, it's easier to start talking.''
