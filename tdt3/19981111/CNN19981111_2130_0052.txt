A military strike is growing more likely with every moment Iraq refuses 
cooperation with U.N. weapons inspectors. The United States is sending 
129 additional aircraft to the Persian gulf to join 170 already there. 
3,000 more U.S. troops are also on the way. That will bring U.S. troop 
strength in the gulf to more than 26,000. 23 ships already are there. 
The aircraft being sent to the gulf include -- electronic warfare 
planes designed to jam enemy radar and communications. President Clinton 
says a failure to respond to the standoff could send the wrong signal 
to Iraq. If the inspectors are not permitted to visit suspect sites 
or monitor compliance at known production facilities, they may as 
well be in baltimore, not Baghdad. That would open a window of opportunity 
for Iraq to rebuild its arsenal of weapons and delivery systems in 
months -- I say again, in months, not years.
