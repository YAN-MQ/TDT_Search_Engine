Alberto Tomba used to race for Olympic medals and World Cup titles. 
Now he'll be racing for kids. Tomba, who retired last summer after 
a 13-year World Cup career highlighted by 50 victories and five Olympic 
medals, will begin the Tomba Tour in the United States this winter. 
It is designed to raise money for junior racing programs, the same 
path Tomba took on the way to becoming a three-time Olympic champion. 
``I like good performers, things that accelerate fast, like me,'' 
he said. At Deer Valley in Utah (Jan. 23-24), Stratton, Vermont, (Jan. 
30-31) and Squaw Valley, California, (March 6-7) Tomba will race along 
with individuals and four-member teams. The best from each stop will 
join Tomba and several TV and movie personalities for the finals March 
20-21 in Aspen, Colorado. In December, Tomba will be in Palm Springs, 
California, to play in the Lexus Challenge golf tournament. ``I was 
a good player, but I haven't played golf in four years,'' Tomba said. 
``But I will practice for an hour, two hours before starting and maybe 
I'll be great.''
