Poor Pakistan, scrambling to raise funds to pay off its huge debt, 
resumed stalled talks Wednesday with the International Monetary Fund, 
an IMF official said. ``An IMF team has arrived Islamabad and will 
resume the talks with Pakistan today,'' said Ahsan Mansur, the IMF 
resident director. But Mansur refused to say more. Pakistan is seeking 
a bailout package worth dlrs 5 billion from global donor agencies 
to avoid a default on the repayment of a whopping dlrs 32 billion 
debt. Pakistan is optimistic of a breakthrough following a decision 
last week by U.S. President Bill Clinton to waive some sanctions, 
imposed after last May's underground nuclear tests, as well as his 
offer of one-time support to Pakistan for this bail out package. Without 
it Pakistan will be forced to default on its debt, its imports would 
dry up and the country would be ruined economically. Already Pakistan 
is behind dlrs 1.4 billion and is currently on a 30 day grace period 
after which time the bill has to be paid or a default declared. The 
IMF package is said to include dlrs 2 billion of debt rescheduling 
and dlrs 3 billion in loans. Talks with the IMF and World Bank stalled 
last month over a dispute between the Pakistan government and privately 
run power companies. The government is accusing some of the country's 
biggest power companies of brokering deals with former prime minister 
Benazir Bhutto to charge inflated power rates. Prime Minister Nawaz 
Sharif accused the companies, many owned and financed by foreign companies 
and guaranteed by the World Bank, of paying massive kickbacks to Ms. 
Bhutto's government. Both Ms. Bhutto and the power companies deny 
the charge. A government decision to slash power rates by 30 percent 
also caused the talks to stall. According to several sources the IMF 
wants Pakistan to end its feud with the power companies, revamp its 
ailing state power utility which means increasing, not decreasing 
rates. Last week Sharif changed his economic team, appointing Ishaq 
Dar as Finance Minister and ousting technocrat Hafeez Pasha from the 
post of financial advisor. But finance ministry officials, who didn't 
want to be identified, said the changes won't effect negotiations. 
``The main outlines of the program have already been chalked out. 
We hope to wrap up talks in the coming few days,'' he said.
