Stock prices fell broadly Wednesday, reversing an early advance, as 
investors pondered what now seems little better than an even chance 
that the Federal Reserve will cut short-term interest rates again 
next week. The third consecutive session of declines was brightened 
by Intel's projection of stronger-than-expected revenue for this quarter, 
which lifted some technology stocks, and by enthusiastic receptions 
for three initial public offerings. But mostly this was a day in which 
the tone seemed to be set by investors cashing profits following a 
month of large gains amid uncertainty not only about the Fed's meeting 
next Tuesday but about the possibility of military action against 
Iraq. ``We've had a very powerful rally in a very short amount of 
time,'' said Philip Orlando, chief investment officer at Value Line 
Asset Management. At a time when many believe that foreign instability 
seems at least to be getting no worse, he called the Fed's decision 
whether to make a third round of rate reductions ``a very close call.'' 
The Dow Jones industrial average closed with a loss of 40.16 points, 
at 8,823.82. It was up as much as 72 points in early trading. The 
much broader Standard &AMP; Poor's index of 500 stocks shed 7.29 points 
to close at 1,120.97. Even the Nasdaq market, which is dominated by 
technology stocks and had posted five consecutive advances, closed 
3.51 points lower, at 1,862.11, and the Russell 2000 index of smaller 
issues fell 3.39 points, to 393.47. ``It was a little surprising that 
the Intel rally didn't take the Nasdaq higher,'' said Warren Epstein, 
head trader at Richard Rosenblatt &AMP; Co. Intel surged 6 1/8, to 
103 11/16, while Texas Instruments rose 5 9/16, to 69 7/16, and Micron 
Technology was up 3 3/8, to 47 5/8, after hitting a 52-week high. 
But most Internet stocks slumped, with Yahoo dropping 11 9/16, America 
Online 7 3/8 and Ebay 14 15/16, part of what Epstein called ``pretty 
good profit-taking'' after sharp run-ups. Some speculative money might 
have been redeployed into the new issues, especially Earthweb, which 
sold 2.1 million shares at 14 and saw them soar as high as 59 before 
closing at 48 11/16, a 247 percent increase and the second-biggest 
first-day rise ever, according to Securities Data. The record was 
Broadcast.com's offering in July, which went from 18 to 74 before 
settling at 62 3/4, a 250 percent gain. And in what was the third-largest 
initial offering on record, News Corp. sold a 20 percent stake in 
Fox Entertainment Group, a 124.8-million-share deal that was priced 
late Tuesday at 22 1/2. The shares traded as high as 25 5/8 Wednesday 
before closing at 24 1/2, an unusually big premium for a multibillion-dollar 
offering. The other issue to trade for the first time was MONY Group, 
the insurance company formerly known as Mutual of New York, now owned 
by shareholders instead of policy-holders. The shares, priced at 23 
1/2, finished at 28 1/8. The bond market, from which stocks sometimes 
take their cue, was closed in observance of Veterans Day. Stocks were 
mixed overseas, closing up 4.28 percent in Hong Kong, 2.27 percent 
in Tokyo and less than 1 percent in London and Frankfurt. The main 
declines were 2.97 percent in Rio de Janeiro and 1.13 percent in Paris. 
Despite the latest skittishness over Iraq, the usual demand for oil 
shares was missing, with most fractionally mixed. Arco fell 1 15/16, 
to 66 5/8, and Phillips fell 1 1/4, to 43 1/4. Drug stocks were among 
the prominent losers Wednesday, with Merck, Pfizer and Schering-Plough 
more than two points lower and Lilly and Abbott down more than one. 
In a soft financial sector, BankAmerica was down 2 5/16, to 57, the 
main loser, but J.P. Morgan jumped 1 3/16, to 98 13/16, amid continuing 
takeover rumors and word that it won Phelps Dodge's 401(k) business. 
American Express lost 1/2, to 92 9/16, despite news that Warren Buffett 
bought 1.08 million shares in early October, the first time the multibillionaire 
investor had raised his Amex stake since 1995. Chrysler edged up 1/8, 
at 47 1/16, in its last week of trading before the company's shares 
disappear because of its merger with Germany's Daimler-Benz. Analysts 
said index funds may already have disposed of their Chrysler shares. 
Safeway, taking Chrysler's place in the S&AMP;P 500, climbed 1 3/16, 
to 49 3/16. On the New York Stock Exchange, volume was 715.8 million 
shares, up from 667.5 million Tuesday. There were 33 new highs against 
19 new lows, but 1,797 issues declined while only 1,215 rose.
