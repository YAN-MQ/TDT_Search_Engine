ZURICH, Switzerland (AP) _ FIFA on Wednesday moved to calm a dispute 
over the release of players for next week's rescheduled European Championship 
qualifier between Yugoslavia and Ireland in Belgrade. A FIFA committee 
suggested clubs make their players available to the national sides 
after this weekend's round of league matches, the world governing 
body said in a statement. It called for a ``flexible approach'' from 
the two associations ``by discussing with (the clubs involved) a reduction 
of the release period.'' Ireland manager Mick McCarthy on Tuesday 
named a 20-man squad for the match and invoked the five-day rule on 
the release of players for competitive international games. That plan, 
which would see players assembling in Dublin on Saturday, would mean 
none of the squad would be available to their clubs for this weekend's 
English Premier League and First Division games. The clubs of players 
involved asked FIFA to treat the game as a special case. The Group 
Eight match was originally scheduled for Oct. 10 but was postponed 
because of the crisis in Kosovo and threat of NATO air strikes. With 
the easing of tensions, UEFA last week gave the go-ahead for the match 
on Nov. 18. English Premier League club Charlton said it wouldn't 
release two of its players _ one each from Ireland and Yugoslavia 
_ until after its league game Saturday. It claimed the two countries 
had breached FIFA regulations by not providing it with the required 
written notice.
