In an unusual move, a prominent nonprofit human rights organization 
has developed and will sell to the public an Internet filter that 
blocks access to several hundred Web sites that the organization says 
advocate bigotry. The organization, the Anti-Defamation League, unveiled 
the filter Wednesday at its annual national meeting in Boston. The 
device is intended for use by parents and is called the ADL Hatefilter. 
Most Internet filters have been created and marketed by businesses. 
Although many of those products block sites espousing intolerance, 
the devices are generally used to screen out online pornography. The 
ADL filter bans sites that preach anti-Semitism, racism, homophobia 
and other forms of bigotry. Among the off-limits Web pages are Ku 
Klux Klan sites and the white supremacist Aryan Nations site. Abraham 
Foxman, national director of the Anti-Defamation League, said the 
project had been undertaken to bring his 85-year-old organization's 
experience in fighting anti-Semitism and other forms of prejudice 
to the Internet. Foxman said the ADL ``stands with a certain reputation 
and credibility on this subject.'' ``Hate out there is rampant,'' 
he said. ``You used to have to make an effort to get hate. Now it 
comes into your home unsuspected.'' Some critics of filtering devices 
have questioned whether they are appropriate shields against offensive 
material or high-tech censorship. Karen Schneider, a librarian who 
has written a book about Internet filters, said the Anti-Defamation 
League's effort was misguided because she believed that it sought 
to fight prejudice with an electronic version of eye-averting. ``I 
find it disturbing that the Anti-Defamation League thinks that the 
way to prevent anti-Semitism is to hide it from the people who care 
about anti-Semitism,'' Ms. Schneider said. But Foxman said it was 
appropriate for parents to try to keep hate speech from their homes. 
``If I as a parent decide I don't want access to this or I don't want 
my child to have access to this, that's not censorship,'' he said. 
`That's exercising my constitutional right.'' But as of Tuesday, the 
device was not foolproof. When a user working on a computer with the 
filter running tried to reach three sites likely to be caught by the 
filter _ her access was blocked. But when she tried to reach a white 
nationalist site called rahowa, standing for for ``racial holy war,'' 
she was still able to view the group's home page even though she was 
denied entry to most of the site. When the problem was pointed out, 
it was corrected shortly afterward. Jonathan Wallace, a founding member 
of the Censorware Project, a group that opposes filtering, said filtering 
technology was still so crude that it was always imperfect, and that 
it ended up either blocking legitimate material, missing objectionable 
sites, or both. ``People market these products as if they protect 
a child 100 percent,'' Wallace said. ``What if it protects a child 
40 percent?'' When the filter is in place, a user who tries to call 
up a proscribed site instead sees a page that says: ``Hate Zone. Access 
Restricted.'' There is also a button that takes the user to an ADL 
``Stop Hate'' Web site, with information about bigotry. The filter 
is based on technology developed by Cyber Patrol, a popular filtering 
product made by The Learning Company in Cambridge, Mass. It costs 
$29.95 for the first three months, and $29.95 for every year afterward. 
A spokeswoman for the Anti-Defamation League said the price was meant 
to offset the costs of developing and maintaining the filter, not 
to generate a profit.
