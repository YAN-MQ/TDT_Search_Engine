Pete Sampras took a wild card entry to the Stockholm Open to bolster 
his top tennis ranking and instead endangered it by losing an opening-round 
match to Australian Jason Stoltenberg on Wednesday, 7-6 (7-5), 4-6, 
6-4. ``What went wrong? That's not an easy question to answer,'' he 
said afterward. ``I had some opportunities I didn't capitalize on.... 
He (Stoltenberg) played some good tennis. I give him credit.'' Sampras 
will lose 630 points from his No. 1 ranking. That's more than the 
605 that separate him from No. 2 Marcelo Rios, who this week is playing 
a tournament in his home country Chile. In a thrilling match that 
lasted 2 hours 16 minutes, Sampras fended off seven match points in 
the final two games. ``I thought it was at least 15,'' quipped a jubilant 
Stoltenberg, world No. 29 and loser of his four previous matches with 
Sampras. ``I thought it was slipping away at the end. I held on.'' 
Sampras lost in the finals of the Paris Open last week to Briton Greg 
Rusedski. He said that _ and his desire to finish a record sixth straight 
year ranked No. 1 _ weighed on his mind. ``I felt I needed the best 
chance possible to try and finish No. 1,'' he said. ``I must admit 
I'm a little bit exhausted.... I'm going to try and get out tonight,'' 
and not wait for a Thursday flight home to the United States. Both 
players received a standing ovation from the Royal Tennis Hall audience 
after the match. In earlier matches, Britain's Tim Henman and Rusedski 
both advanced. Henman reached the quarterfinals with a straight-set 
victory over Wayne Ferreira of South Africa, 7-6 (7-3) and 6-4. He 
started fast, breaking Ferreira's serve in game two, but then lost 
five of the next six games, and had to scramble to break Ferreira's 
serve to force a tiebreak. ``It was an up-and-down first set,'' Henman 
said. ``My serving was erratic at that point.'' Rusedski demolished 
Tommy Haas, 6-1, 6-4, in a quick 52 minutes. The German failed to 
hold his first four service games, winning just two points along the 
way. ``I couldn't be playing much better tennis if I tried,'' Rusedski 
said after the match. Asked if he had ever won every point of an opponent's 
service game in an entire set, he joked, ``It must be my new improved 
returns.'' Henman and Rusedski, ranked Nos. 10 and 11 in the world, 
are trying to qualify for the last spots in the ATP Tour Championships 
in Hanover, Germany, later this month. Sampras already is in. Rusedski 
is on a roll. His victory over Sampras last week in Paris was ``probably 
my greatest accomplishment in tennis, by far.'' In other matches Wednesday, 
American Todd Martin defeated Australia's hard-serving Wayne Arthurs, 
6-4, 6-3, to join Henman in the quarterfinals. Arthurs, a 27-year-old 
doubles specialist from Adelaide, on Tuesday upset tournament second 
seed and world No. 7 Karol Kucera of Slovakia. He started sharp with 
three aces in his first game, but the more experienced Martin broke 
his serve in game three of each set, and wore him down. Arthurs, ranked 
No. 168, notched at least one ace in every service game except one, 
and had 15 overall. Martin's play was business-like. He rarely fell 
behind in the count, won the big points including service breaks early 
in each set, and never lost his serve.
