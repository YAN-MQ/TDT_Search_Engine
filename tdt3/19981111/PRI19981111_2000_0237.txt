Tipper Gore arrived today in Managua, Nicaragua bearing the message 
that the U.S. has a long-term commitment to aiding the victims of 
hurricane Mitch. The wife of Vice President, Al Gore, said the international 
community has now pledged some $40 million in aid to Central American 
along with the 80 already promised by the United States. The economic 
damage from the storm is estimated to be far higher, including about 
$3 billion worth in Honduras and $1 billion in Nicaragua. The storm 
killed at least 11,000 people in Central America with thousands more 
missing and feared dead.
