At least 400 weapons inspectors and other U.N. staff left Baghdad 
Wednesday and the United Nations began withdrawing ``nonessential'' 
staff amid preparations for a possible U.S. military strike. A convoy 
of 11 buses and vans carrying more than 100 arms inspectors and their 
luggage rolled out of the U.N. Special Commission's headquarters Wednesday 
morning. About 300 other U.N. staff _ apparently humanitarian workers 
_ departed four hours later. Many of those leaving hugged U.N. workers 
_ including Iraqi staffers _ who remained behind. None of U.N. employees 
would speak with reporters as they boarded the gold, pink and blue 
buses. As the vehicles left, U.N. workers were putting screens up 
over the windows of the headquarters _ a move apparently aimed at 
preventing glass shattering into the building if there were a military 
strike. The U.N. special envoy to Iraq, Prakash Shah, told reporters 
in Baghdad the world body had decided to withdraw its personnel because 
of a possible military strike. Eric Falt, spokesman for U.N. humanitarian 
programs in Iraq, specified that the withdrawal of all nonessential 
personnel was ``precautionary.'' ``In view of uncertainties surrounding 
the current situation and following instructions from the U.N. headquarters 
in New York, it has been decided to temporarily relocate nonessential 
U.N. staff to Amman, Jordan,'' Falt said. The United States and Britain 
have warned that military force may be used to try to force Baghdad 
to back down from its decision to freeze all cooperation with the 
U.N. Special Commission in charge of arms inspections. U.S. President 
Bill Clinton met Tuesday with senior Pentagon officials to explore 
options for a military attack, and Washington has stepped up the movement 
of U.S. ships into the region. Iraq has said it will not cooperate 
with inspectors until the U.N. Security Council begins moving to lift 
an embargo imposed after Iraqi forces invaded Kuwait in 1990, sparking 
the Gulf War. The Security Council maintains the embargo won't be 
lifted until U.N. inspectors certify that Iraq has eliminated its 
weapons of mass destruction. Shah said when he discussed the withdrawal 
with Iraq's deputy prime minister on Wednesday morning, Tariq Aziz 
had told him Iraq officials would not change their position. ``They 
will not be able to desist from their position unless the Security 
Council takes some action in regard to the sanctions on Iraq,'' Shah 
said, summing up Aziz's views. Before Wednesday's departures, there 
were about 120 UNSCOM and IAEA personnel in the country. There were 
about 450 humanitarian workers. Those pulled out Wednesday included 
not only all UNSCOM staff but monitors for the International Atomic 
Energy Agency and other U.N. workers who run the oil-for-food program 
supplying aid to the Iraqi people. The arms inspectors flew to Bahrain, 
while others were traveling aboard five buses on the nine- or ten-hour 
trip across the desert to neighboring Jordan. The current crisis began 
in August when Iraq said it would not cooperate with the Special Commission. 
It let some personnel continue long-term monitoring, but on Oct. 31 
it stopped even that work. Despite warnings of a military strike by 
the United States and Britain, Iraqi officials have said they will 
not back down from their decision to bar the inspectors from working. 
Iraq appeared to be turning to other Arab states to head off any attack. 
On Tuesday, Iraq's foreign minister, Mohammed Saeed al-Sahhaf warned 
that ``any use of military force against Iraq would lead to destabilizing 
the region.'' The United States and Britain maintain they have backing 
in the Middle East for a military strike, but Arab officials have 
offered no public support for using force. Jordan's Prime Minister 
Fayez Tarawneh, after meeting Wednesday with Saudi Arabia's Kind Fahd 
and Crown Prince Abdullah, said the two countries ``are in agreement 
that the crisis ... should be solved diplomatically.'' But he added: 
``It appears that attempts to defuse the crisis could be late.'' In 
New York, Nizar Hamdoon, Iraq's ambassador to the United Nations, 
said Tuesday that ``we have to prepare ourself for a strike obviously 
_ this does not mean that we don't encourage diplomacy.'' U.N. chief 
weapons inspector Richard Butler, interviewed on U.S. television, 
urged Iraq to face up to the fact that disarmament is connected to 
sanctions. ``The key is in its hands _ and it's called full disclosure 
to us,'' he said.
