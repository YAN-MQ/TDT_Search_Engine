A Communist lawmaker resumed his virulent anti-Semitic attacks Wednesday, 
and Russia's Communist Party leader refused to speak out against a 
proposal for introducing quotas on the number of Jews in government 
jobs. Several prominent businessmen and politicians have called for 
banning the Communist Party because it would not censure lawmaker 
Albert Makashov for anti-Semitic remarks. In speeches last month, 
Makashov, a retired general, blamed the country's problems on ``zhidy'' 
or ``yids,'' a slur against Jews. Makashov was at it again Wednesday, 
telling a Russian journalist with the NTV television station he was 
``acting worse than the worst of the yids.'' Makashov has also told 
the Italian newspaper La Stampa that he wants quotas introduced on 
the number of Jews in Russia's state organizations. Communist Party 
leader Gennady Zyuganov, who had tried to smooth over the harshest 
of Makashov's earlier attacks, refused to comment on the call for 
quotas. Many of the Communist Party's voters hold anti-Semitic views. 
Also, Zyuganov's party considers itself the main successor to the 
Soviet Union's Communist Party, which imposed such quotas on Jews 
in the government and other jobs. Meanwhile, the speaker of the lower 
house of parliament, Gennady Seleznyov, a moderate Communist, tried 
to play down the controversy Wednesday, saying Makashov's statements 
were ``his personal view.'' ``This has nothing to do with the Communist 
party or its parliamentary faction,'' Seleznyov said. Communists in 
parliament blocked a resolution last week condemning Makashov's comments, 
and several of his Communist colleagues defended him in speeches this 
weekend celebrating the 81st anniversary of the 1917 Russian revolution, 
which brought the Communist Party to power. Several leading politicians 
and business people have said the incident showed the party had evolved 
into fascism and have called for the party to be banned. A prominent 
political commentator and former ambassador to Israel, Alexander Bovin, 
said in a column published Wednesday that Russia should ``thank comrade 
Zyuganov ... because he let everybody see the true face of his party.'' 
President Boris Yeltsin condemned the party for its stance on Makashov, 
but Prime Minister Yevgeny Primakov strongly opposed the calls for 
a ban on the party. Facing mounting opposition from the Communist-dominated 
parliament as the economy began collapsing this fall, Primakov invited 
some prominent Communists into his government and is unwilling to 
antagonize the party. Meanwhile, a poll released Wednesday showed 
that 51 percent of Muscovites were outraged by Makashov's remarks, 
while 15 percent approved of them. Another 24 percent said they were 
unaware of the remarks. Also, 30 percent of those polled said they 
believed Makashov should be prosecuted, while 29 percent said he should 
face no repercussions. Makashov enjoys immunity from prosecution as 
a lawmaker. The Interfax news agency, which carried results of the 
poll conducted by the independent All-Russian Center for the Public 
Opinion Study over the weekend, gave no margin of error.
