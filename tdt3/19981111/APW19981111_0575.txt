Niklas Luhmann, a well-known German sociologist who also taught in 
the United States, has died after a long illness, the local university 
said Wednesday. He was 71. Luhmann, born on Dec. 8, 1927 in Lueneburg 
in northern Germany, died at home on Friday in Oerlinghausen, near 
Bielefeld. The delay in the announcement was made at the request of 
his family, Bielefeld University said. No exact cause of death was 
announced. Appointed to the chair of sociology at Bielefeld in 1968, 
Luhmann taught at many other universities during his career, including 
Frankfurt, the New School for Social Research in New York and Northwestern 
University in Chicago. Luhmann's interest in the functioning of societies 
was explored in 40 books and 250 essays, many of them translated into 
foreign languages. He summarized his theory in a 1984 book stating 
that societies were living organisms defined by the way people communicated 
within them. He explored the model in books dealing with topics such 
as trust, power, religion, education and love. Luhmann was controversial 
in academic circles. His works formed the basis of a theoretical dispute 
with German philosopher Juergen Habermas and the so-called Frankfurt 
School for much of the 1970s. Luhmann is survived by three children, 
Joerg, Veronika and Clemens. Funeral arrangements were not immediately 
announced.
