In ``The Faculty,'' which opens on Christmas Day, Famke Janssen plays 
a timid, bespectacled high school teacher, a woman whose voice quavers 
when she urges a promising but wayward student to apply himself. Since 
the movie is a thriller directed by Robert Rodriguez (``Desperado'') 
and written by Kevin Williamson (``Scream''), it is safe to expect 
that the shy educator will undergo a radical shift in personality 
and appearance before the final reel. Then it should be easy to recognize 
Ms. Janssen as the confident actress who has given a series of witty, 
engaging performances in relatively small parts: the Russian-born 
owner of a gambling joint in ``Rounders,'' the bitter, alcoholic ex-wife 
of a Southern lawyer in ``The Gingerbread Man'' and a tough, blue-collar 
Bostonian in ``Monument Avenue.'' In ``Celebrity,'' a Woody Allen 
film that opens on Nov. 20, she plays a sophisticated editor in love 
with a neurotic, on-the-make writer played by Kenneth Branagh. ``I'm 
trying to fight typecasting as hard as I can, while I have time,'' 
says Ms. Janssen, who lives in Manhattan with her husband, the director 
and screenwriter Todd Williams. Though she earned good notices in 
1995 for her performance as a lethal Russian spy named Xenia Onatopp 
in ``Goldeneye,'' Ms. Janssen says that the international publicity 
she earned from being a Bond Girl led her to reject offers to play 
glamorous, cartoonlike leading women and to seek out more intriguing 
supporting roles. ``Once you achieve a certain level of success or 
fame, it becomes really difficult to go against type. This is a good 
time for me to experiment.'' Though it is hard to imagine Ms. Janssen 
blending into a crowd _ she is 5 feet 11 inches, and her exotic beauty 
has been compared to that of 1940s stars like Hedy Lamarr _ her colleagues 
praise this very quality, as well as her dedication and humor. Denis 
Leary, who acted with Ms. Janssen in ``Monument Avenue,'' says he 
didn't recognize Ms. Janssen when first saw her in the film's Boston 
production office. ``She came dressed in character, in leather pants 
and denim, and I walked right by her,'' he says. ``I thought she was 
someone from the neighborhood, auditioning for a small role,'' he 
says. ``She spent a few days hanging around, and within a few days 
she had the accent down. I was really impressed.'' Ms. Janssen's ability 
to adopt a convincing regional accent _ Slavic by way of Brooklyn, 
Savannahian, or blue-collar Bostonian, to name a few _ is all the 
more surprising because English is not her native language. The 34-year-old 
was born in Amsterdam, and she did not move to the United States until 
she was in her early twenties. By that time, she had dropped out of 
her Dutch university, where she was studying economics, and spent 
several years working in Europe as a fashion model. She arrived in 
New York with enough money saved to join an acting workshop and re-enroll 
in college _ this time as a creative writing and literature student 
at Columbia University. Though Ms. Janssen now sounds thoroughly American, 
an agent urged her to change her name to avoid being perceived as 
foreign. (Her first name, unusual even in her native country, means 
``little girl'' in the Friesland dialect.) ``I know actors do it all 
the time, but I felt I'd be losing my identity,'' Ms. Janssen says. 
``Instead, I worked harder on losing my accent.'' She did, however, 
make one concession for her career: convinced that she would have 
a better chance at getting film work, she spent five unsatisfying 
years as a struggling actress in Los Angeles, playing a crime-fighting 
supermodel in a television movie, and an object of desire in a ``Star 
Trek: The Next Generation'' episode called ``The Perfect Mate.'' At 
this stage of her career, she says, her success is tied to the director. 
``It's really in the director's hands, and I've tried to work with 
directors who consistently do their own thing. If you do well as an 
actor, a good director will pick up on it, and keep it in the film.''
