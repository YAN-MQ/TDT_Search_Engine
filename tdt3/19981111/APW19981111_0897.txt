The committee overseeing memorials to Princess Diana announced Wednesday 
that it has scaled down plans for an elaborate project in Kensington 
Gardens after angry protests from area residents. British treasury 
chief Gordon Brown, the committee's chairman, said the original proposal 
for an elaborate 2.7-acre site costing 10 million pounds (dlrs 16.5 
million) had been replaced by a more understated plan involving a 
smaller garden and memorial walk. The most significant aspect will 
be a walkway connecting four of London's great parks _ Kensington, 
Hyde, Green and St. James's _ but the walkway no longer will follow 
Diana's funeral procession route, Brown said. The parks will be connected 
in a figure-eight shape, with Hyde Park in the center, allowing people 
to start and finish the walk however they choose. ``This will be one 
of the most magnificent urban parkland walks in the world,'' Brown 
said. A cost estimate for the new project was not provided. Residents 
and local legislators had overwhelming opposed the original plans 
centering on Kensington Gardens _ located outside the palace where 
Diana had lived _ fearing the damage inflicted on the neighborhood 
by the millions of extra visitors expected each year. Brown said the 
committee's other three main proposals were on track, including a 
commemorative 5-pound coin (worth about dlrs 8.35) that will be released 
for general circulation next July 1, which was Diana's birthday. The 
other two projects are community children's nursing teams, dubbed 
Diana's Angels, and the Diana, Princess of Wales Memorial Award, to 
be given to youths between the ages of 11 and 18 for community service 
or overcoming personal problems. ``The memorial committee feels that 
together these will form a fitting, long-lasting tribute to Diana, 
Princess of Wales which will recognize her unique contribution and 
the example she set,'' Brown said. The committee members include Diana's 
sister, Lady Sarah McCorquodale, and her butler, Paul Burrell.
