The sky cleared, but the wind was gusty across the Midwest and Plains 
states today as the first severe winter storm of the season blew east. 
Mark Moran reports from De Moines. The storm that blanketed the region 
with snow and buffeted the Plains states with hurricane-force winds 
gave way to a clearer sky but gusty winds continued to blow snow over 
side streets and major interstates in Minnesota and South Dakota. 
The fronts stretched from Michigan south to Louisiana. And churned 
up waves on Lake Superior to a record height. It was responsible for 
severe thunderstorms across the Plains and Midwest; caused power outages 
in Arkansas, and rain in Louisiana. In Iowa, subzero winds stripped 
roofs off of school buildings. No one was injured. The storm system 
set a record for low barometric pressure. Which weather experts say 
was responsible for the storm's voracity. For NPR News, I'm Mark Moran, 
in Des Moines.
