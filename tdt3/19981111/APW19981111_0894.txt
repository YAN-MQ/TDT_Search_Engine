Most Greek newspapers left out ads for phone sex lines and escorts 
Wednesday after authorities threatened prosecution for notices deemed 
linked to prostitution. At least one newspaper, the Athens daily Apoyevmatini, 
defied the ban and ran over 150 ads. The paper called the threats 
of prosecution a blow to press freedom. Many daily newspapers usually 
carry several pages of ads for escorts, phone sex lines and massages. 
Athens' chief prosecutor Tuesday sent an order to police demanding 
the arrest of the publisher and editor of any newspaper that prints 
advertisements encouraging ``another's vice.'' Greek authorities are 
struggling with a growing corruption scandal that includes allegations 
of police protection for prostitution rings. Some government opponents 
have called for a moral crusade in the traditionally conservative 
nation. Prostitution is legal in Greece at state-sanctioned brothels. 
But there are an estimated 20,000 unregistered prostitutes.
