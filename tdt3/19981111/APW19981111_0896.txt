Russia's Communist Party chief and other hard-liners have asked the 
Cabinet to introduce censorship of Russian television, which they 
called ``the main destabilizing force in the society,'' news reports 
said Wednesday. Communist leader Gennady Zyuganov and leaders of two 
allied parties in parliament have sent a letter to Prime Minister 
Yevgeny Primakov urging him to set up ``public observatory councils'' 
at ``every television station, without exception.'' These boards ``should 
have the necessary powers to control and regulate the contents of 
all TV programs in the interests of the majority of the population,'' 
the Interfax news agency quoted the letter as saying. Communists in 
the Russian parliament earlier this year blocked a bill that would 
have banned fascist propaganda, because they said the bill would infringe 
on freedom of speech. Yet the Communists have long called for more 
control of the media, which they say is too pro-government. The calls 
have flared up in the past few days, after Russian television channels 
gave much coverage to criticism of the Communist Party for its failure 
to condemn a member's outspoken anti-Semitism. Communists in parliament 
blocked a resolution last week condemning lawmaker Albert Makashov's 
slurs against Jews, and several of his Communist colleagues defended 
him in speeches this weekend. In the letter to Primakov, the party 
leaders accused television stations of ``cynically manipulating public 
opinion against the interests of the state'' and becoming ``the main 
destabilizing force in the society,'' Interfax reported. The head 
of Russia's ORT public television station, Igor Shabdurasulov, lambasted 
the calls, saying that if Communists ``want to get jurisdiction over 
the mass media, let them introduce changes in the law on the media 
and ... announce to the country and the whole world the establishment 
of censorship in the country.'' Any legal amendments would need to 
be approved by President Boris Yeltsin, who has sharply criticized 
the Communists' calls for censorship and is certain to veto any such 
bill. Responding to the Communists allegations of TV's ``destabilizing'' 
influence, Shabdurasulov also said that ``it is some of the deputies 
of (parliament) who really introduce a significant element of destabilization 
in the country,'' Interfax reported.
