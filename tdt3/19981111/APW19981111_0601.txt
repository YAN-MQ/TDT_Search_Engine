Trying to dispel persistent rumors, Israel's Foreign Ministry announced 
Wednesday that two Israelis arrested in Cyprus last week as suspected 
spies were not working for Turkey. The statement did not say who had 
employed the two. ``The two Israelis that were arrested in Cyprus 
didn't act against Cyprus and didn't act on Turkey's behalf,'' the 
statement said. The arrests have strained relations between Israel 
and Cyprus, which has grown increasingly suspicious of Israel's military 
pact with Turkey. Cypriot police had said they suspected the Israelis 
were spying on behalf of Turkey, which invaded and occupied the northern 
third of Cyprus in 1974. But the Foreign Ministry said it would work 
to maintain good relations with the island country. ``The friendly 
relations between the two countries, expressed recently by the Israeli 
president's visit to Cyprus, will continue and will be tightened,'' 
the statement said. Cypriot government spokesman Christos Stylianides 
said he would not comment on the Israeli statement while the case 
was still under investigation.
