After repeated delays, the Israeli cabinet today ratified the wye 
river interim agreement. The parliament could vote on it Monday. Under 
the accord, Israel will transfer 13% of the West Bank to the palestinians 
in a 12-week period, in exchange for security guarantees. The initial 
troop withdrawal is to begin Monday. Prime minister Benjamin Netanyahu 
says Israel remains prepared to protect its own security during the 
transition. Let's say if the Palestinians declared the establishment 
of a Palestinian state, then we reserve the right to apply Israeli 
law to the security areas, to the Jerusalem area, to the areas of 
settlement and other matters which were accepted as vital national 
interests of the government and state of Israel.
