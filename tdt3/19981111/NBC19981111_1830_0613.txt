Now to central America where in the days since hurricane Mitch devastated 
that region, the overwhelming imagines of the tragedy have sent Americans 
by the thousands rushing to help. More tonight from NBC's Anne Thompson. 
a 12-year-old in California today already making a difference in the 
world. I just thought about how sad and lonely and hungry everyone 
looked. Like thousands of Americans moved by the images of suffering 
in central America, this week, 6th grader mykala hedberg organized 
a food drive at her suburban Los Angeles school, recorded by her mom 
on videotape. Her classmates brought 200 canned goods for the victims 
of hurricane Mitch. Just one of many relief efforts across the country. 
In Portland, volunteers load medical supplies on military transport 
planes. In Dayton, a high school Spanish class collects lunch money 
from classmates. In cash, we have $150 in just one day. And in Illinois, 
from the vast shelves of the greater Chicago food depository that 
feeds the hungry here, 28 pallets of cereals and snack foods are on 
the way to Honduras. Also on the way to central America tonight -- 
560 tons of food from save the children. 10,000 pounds of medicine 
and emergency supplies from Catholic charities. Already there -- chemicals 
from the red cross to purify 15 million gallons of water. American 
red cross President Elizabeth Dole, on the scene in Honduras. A lot 
of people are just seeing this and really related to what a terrible 
tragedy this is. But along with widespread sympathy, there is a bond 
of kinship, especially within the Hispanic-American community. At 
St. Anthony's church in Virginia. Hurricane Mitch didn't just hit 
in central America. It hit here in our community. Americans tonight 
reaching out and making a statement. It goes to the heart of the values 
in this country. And the things that we stand for. Help in donations 
large and small, like mykala's 200 cans, to repair the $3 billion 
in damage left by Mitch. Anne Thompson, NBC news, Chicago. And for 
those looking for ways to help, here's now to contact several major 
international relief agencies. Those are the numbers you should be 
calling at the American red cross and also at care, doctors without 
borders. Those numbers will get you in touch with the people who can 
direct you on how you can help.
