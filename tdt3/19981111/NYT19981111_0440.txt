Investors holding the bonds of Barings PLC, the failed British bank, 
Wednesday rejected a proposed settlement seeking to recover their 
losses, saying the amount was only a fraction of $1.3 billion lost 
in 1995 during a wild and unauthorized trading spree by one of the 
bank's Singapore traders. The bondholders sued the bank, former executives 
and the accounting firms that audited the bank's financial statements 
after unauthorized trading by Nicholas Leeson led to the collapse 
of the 232-year-old British merchant bank, which was then acquired 
by a Dutch company. Leeson is serving a 6{-year prison sentence in 
Singapore for illegally covering up the trading losses. After months 
of negotiations, Barings and the other defendants offered to pay the 
holders of the bank's secured bonds about $100 million, or 63.5 percent 
of the bonds' face value, said Wilbur Ross Jr., senior managing director 
at Rothschild Inc., the Wall Street firm that is advising the majority 
of the bondholders. The proposed settlement, he said, represented 
far less than even 10 percent of the trading losses caused by Leeson. 
``We don't think that's enough,'' Ross said. He said it was not clear 
whether the defendants would make another settlement offer or allow 
the case to go to court. The bondholders have retained David Boies, 
the lawyer now representing the government in its antitrust case against 
Microsoft Corp., to represent them if a settlement cannot be reached, 
Ross said. If the court rules that the defendants must pay the bondholders, 
they would also have to pay the bondholders' legal costs under British 
law. The defendants had also offered the holders of the bank's unsecured 
bonds about 23 percent of the face value of those bonds. Because of 
the bondholders' rejection of the settlement, the investors holding 
the secured bonds and those holding the unsecured bonds must now renegotiate 
how they will split any settlement, Ross said. The two largest holders 
of the secured bonds are Mutual Shares, a mutual fund overseen by 
Michael Price, and Halcyon Partners, another investment firm. The 
two accounting firms that audited Barings' books were Deloitte Touche 
Tohmatsu and Coopers &AMP; Lybrand, which merged with another accounting 
firm this year to become PricewaterhouseCoopers. In 1995, Leeson wiped 
out Barings with his unauthorized trading of securities linked to 
Japanese stock and bond prices. The losses led to the bank's takeover 
by the ING Groep N.V. of the Netherlands. Leeson's lawyers later argued 
that some of the bank's executives knew about the financial problems 
piling up on the books of the Singapore office. In 1996, British regulators 
sanctioned at least five former bank executives by suspending them 
from securities work for as long as three years. Ernst &AMP; Young, 
the accounting firm hired as the bank's liquidator, is trying to recover 
as much money as possible to pay the bondholders.
