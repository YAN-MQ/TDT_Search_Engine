In Baghdad, where periodic attacks by the U.S. have become a way of 
life, saddam has cranked up his propaganda machine and he is staying 
out of sight. NBC's Ron Allen is there tonight. ron? What's going 
on there? Tonight, strong signs Iraq's government is finally taking 
the threat of airstrikes seriously. For the first time since the crisis 
erupted, Saddam Hussein, openly preparing his country for war, trying 
to reassure his people everything is under control. The escalating 
tensions now dominate Iraq's government-controlled news programs, 
Saddam's deputies accusing the United States of forcing the U.N. weapons 
inspectors to pull out. For Saddam, a day of urgent meetings. A broadcast 
from a secret location -- Saddam with his cabinet, making preparations 
in case of an attack. Then, Saddam with his top military commanders, 
discussing how to retaliate should the U.S. strike. So far, no signs 
of an Iraqi military buildup or call-up of military reserves. In Baghdad 
tonight, the players in this cafe game believe Saddam will win his 
test of wills with the U.S. "all you want is to force Saddam to quit." 
"why?" He asks. "If you attack Iraq," he warns, "we'll kill U.S. soldiers 
in Arab countries like Kuwait and Saudi Arabia." Even though airstrikes 
could be imminent, the streets are busy with shoppers, and it's business 
as usual at places like nuri's Barber shop. "We're used to America's 
threats," he says. "That's nothing new." Tonight, unlike previous 
standoffs, no sign of Iraqis being used as human shields as possible 
bombing targets. Tonight, Iraq has many doubts that America has the 
will to carry out its threats. tom? An railen tonight.
