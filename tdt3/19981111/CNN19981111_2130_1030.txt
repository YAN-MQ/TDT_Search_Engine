Traveling can be stressful, especially for your pets. In this edition 
of "working ahead," Kalin Thomas-Samuel offers some tips to help ease 
your pet's anxiety. a plane trip and an unfamiliar destination can 
fill pet and owner with anxiety. Dr. Cheryl schwartz, holistic veterinarian 
and pet columnist for "healthy living" magazine, says alternative 
treatments can help animals travel comfortably. We can help give them 
herbal calming essences to help them with their journey and to help 
the fear. Schwartz says tranquilizers can make pets feel disoriented. 
She recommends massage on the front part of the head. Really light 
pressure in a counter-clockwise direction. Then behind the ears in 
the little notch, the two dimples at the base of the neck. And don't 
forget the ears themselves. The "pets welcome" book and Internet site 
list pet-friendly hotels across the country. If your pet's not welcome 
at a hotel, a "best friends pet resort" may be close by. We will pick 
up the pets from the hotel and bring them here for boarding. And when 
the client is ready to leave out of town, we will bring them back 
to the hotel. Jim Ward's dogs are regular "best friends" guests. His 
travel tip -- take a care package. Bring their own food and treats 
so that they don't have a change in diet and a couple of their own 
toys so they tend to feel a little better, like it's more like home. 
And having your pet with you may make you feel more at-home on your 
trip. Kalin Thomas-Samuel, CNN, Atlanta.
