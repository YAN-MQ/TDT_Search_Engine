Shoring up ties with its African allies, Taiwan will play host to 
Gambian President Yahya Jammeh on an eight-day visit beginning Nov. 
18, the Foreign Ministry announced Wednesday. Jammeh, a 32-year-old 
retired colonel, will be the third African head of state to visit 
Taiwan in 1998, a year that has brought Taiwan a series of setbacks 
in its rivalry with China for diplomatic recognition. During the visit, 
Jammeh's second since winning power in the former British colony in 
a bloodless 1994 coup, the Gambian will meet Taiwan President Lee 
Teng-hui and other officials. Jammeh also plans to visit agricultural 
stations, fisheries and small business workshops. Taiwan fetes visiting 
allied heads of state as major world leaders, and relies heavily on 
providing aid to their countries as an incentive for maintaining diplomatic 
ties. Gambia, a cigar-shaped country with a population of 1 million, 
is the smallest in Africa, and one of just 26 nations that recognize 
Taiwan, the island stronghold of Chiang Kai-shek's Nationalists, who 
fled here amid civil war in 1949. China regards Taiwan as a breakaway 
province with no right to international relations, and refuses to 
recognize countries that have diplomatic links with the island. Charging 
ahead in its campaign to isolate Taiwan, China has poached away four 
of Taiwan's former allies this year alone, most recently Tonga on 
Nov. 2. Switches in relations are usually precipitated by lavish Chinese 
offers of aid, loans and investment.
