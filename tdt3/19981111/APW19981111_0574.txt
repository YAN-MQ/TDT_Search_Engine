Hundreds of journalists protested Wednesday after troops and police 
beat three Indonesian news photographers covering a student demonstration. 
The journalists rallied briefly at a sitting of a special session 
of the People's Consultative Assembly at the national Parliament building. 
The 1,000-member assembly is currently the focus of protesting students, 
who fear it won't deliver on promises to introduce sweeping democratic 
reforms. The journalists threatened to boycott coverage of the session 
unless the military and the government apologize for the violence 
and promise to protect members of news organizations. Violence erupted 
late Wednesday in downtown Jakarta after a group of students rammed 
a car into a cordon of riot police. Security officers retaliated with 
warning shots and a baton charge. ``I saw one female student trampled 
on the head by a soldier. Then suddenly they beat me, though I told 
them I was a newsman,'' said Saptono, a photographer with the official 
Antara news agency. He was hospitalized with a broken leg and a hand 
injury.
