Good evening. Tonight, American planes, ships, troops and the world's 
most sophisticated weapons are moving into place in the Persian gulf, 
and they have one target -- Iraq. Despite repeated warnings, there 
is no sign tonight that Saddam Hussein will back down from his position 
that U.N. weapons inspectors are no longer welcome. Today the Pentagon 
ordered the deployment of 84 additional combat aircraft, 3,000 army 
troops joining the 1,500 ground forces already in Kuwait, and two 
additional patriot missile batteries to the region. We begin our coverage 
with NBC's David Bloom at the White House. David, what's the latest 
there? Tom, in seeking to prepare the American people for possible 
military strikes, President Clinton today warned that if the U.S. 
fails to respond to Iraq's latest provocation, it will only embolden 
Saddam Hussein to act recklessly and with impunity. Tonight, as the 
president's national security team met on Iraq for a fourth straight 
day, White House aides insisted Mr. Clinton has made no final decision 
authorizing the use of force. But, at Arlington cemetery, after laying 
a wreath at the tomb of the unknowns, President Clinton made his intentions 
clear. We continue to hope -- indeed, pray -- that Saddam will comply. 
But we must be prepared to act if he does not. Today, more than 400 
United Nations weapons inspectors and relief workers evacuated Baghdad. 
U.N. officials say chief weapons inspector Richard Butler was warned 
by the United States that his team members could be targets of reprisal 
or potential hostages if the U.S. strikes. I took a decision based 
on safety. And, in my view, it was best that there be no delay. Why 
might Iraq threaten the weapons inspectors? NBC news has learned that 
within the past year, some specific U.S. military targets in Iraq 
were selected with the help of one or more of the weapons inspectors. 
Contrary to the U.N. team's claim of neutrality. Today there was a 
letter that the weapon inspection team "coordinates its actions with 
the United States." But tonight as the U.N. security council met in 
an emergency session, there was no sign of Iraq backing down. And 
the United States state department warn Americans in Israel and Kuwait 
to leave as soon as possible. David Bloom tonight.
