A powerful storm roared into the northeastern United States today. 
It left chilling memories for people in the midwest and plains. Heavy 
winds brought down power lines and left 73,000 people in Wisconsin 
with no electricity. Hurricane-force winds tipped over trucks, ripped 
off roofs, and forced administrators to close 22 Milwaukee public 
schools for the day. In Minnesota, the winds carried with them up 
to ten inches of snow, causing vehicles to slide along the highways 
and forcing others to be abandoned. Authorities closed more than 600 
miles of highway across the plains yesterday. Some of them remain 
closed today. In Missouri, governor Mel carnahan has declared a state 
of emergency for areas hit by the storm. 50-mile-per-hour wind gusts 
tore through a Columbia subdivision. More than 20 homes were destroyed 
and another 100 were damaged.
