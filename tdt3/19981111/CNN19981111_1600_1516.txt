This year's national oreo-stacking champion is Andrea Sherman of jerseyville, 
Illinois. The 12-year-old won the title yesterday, when she piled 
up 29 oreos in a Tower in 30 seconds, without glue or any other aid. 
Nabisco started the oreo-stacking competition last year to Mark the 
cookie's 85th anniversary.
