National Public Radio's governing board announced Wednesday that Kevin 
Klose, a former Washington Post reporter and editor and the current 
head of the federal government's overseas radio broadcasts has been 
named the new president and chief executive of the public radio network. 
The appointment comes as the public radio network has largely weaned 
itself from dependence on the federally financed Corporation for Public 
Broadcasting, but it remains under control of its biggest customers, 
the country's local public radio stations, which took effective control 
of the network after bailing it out of a financial crisis that emerged 
in 1983. Klose is also taking over in an era of far greater competition 
among the electronic media, as cable news networks and Internet news 
sites proliferate. For the past few years, NPR's audience, now at 
13.5 million, has continued to grow. The quirky, discursive style 
of news broadcasts like ``All Things Considered'' and ``Morning Edition'' 
and the off-beat humor of the popular weekend program ``Car Talk'' 
have propelled the popularity of the network, but network executives 
like Jeffrey Dvorkin, the vice president for news, say more programming 
like the new news-and-irony offering, ``Wait, Wait, Don't Tell Me,'' 
are needed if the audience is to continue expanding. The continuing 
competition from commercial radio remains a worry. ``They know the 
kinds of people who listen to us,'' Dvorkin said. ``This is a demographic 
that is clearly appearing to everyone in radio. We have to be vigilant 
that our news programming remains of the highest quality _ and that 
we remain distinct.'' In the fiscal year that ended in September 1997, 
the most recent year for which figures are available, the 604 local 
stations that use NPR programming paid the network about $40 million 
in programming, membership and connection fees. These fees, which 
account for two-thirds of the network's budget, are set by the network's 
16-member board, which includes 10 members selected by the member 
stations. Another $21 million of the $70 million budget comes from 
direct and indirect support from listeners and underwriters like the 
Ford Foundation and the agricultural products conglomerate Archer-Daniels-Midland. 
Government grants accounted for $3 million. ``The biggest problem 
facing us is the structure of the organization,'' said Paul Delaney, 
a columnist and editorial writer for The Baltimore Sun who is one 
of the NPR board's six public members. ``How are we going to approach 
the future as an organization in which you have the users also running 
it? We've got to come to terms with that in some equitable way.'' 
Klose, who replaces Delano E. Lewis, a lawyer and former telecommunications 
executive who retired in August, said the network's job ``in an increasingly 
competitive information world'' was to ``look at the challenge of 
the multimedia, multichannel world,'' and use new opportunities ``for 
keeping our extraordinary listenership and adding to it.''
