After an emergency session, the United Nations Security Council has 
reiterated calls for Saddam Hussein to cooperate with weapons inspections. 
But it took no stand on possible military action against Iraq. Russia 
called for the emergency meeting and its ambassador, Sir Gay Lavorof 
said attacking Iraq is a bad idea. Our position is that the use of 
force in this particular situation is going to be very dangerous from 
the point of the UN ability to keep a monitoring capacity in Iraq. 
The plans to use force are not supported by calculation of what might 
happen next. Washington is stepping up the pressure on Iraqi leader, 
Saddam Hussein, over arms inspections. President Clinton says Saddam 
must back down or face military action. The UN pulled most of its 
personnel out of Baghdad today prompting speculation military action 
is imminent.
