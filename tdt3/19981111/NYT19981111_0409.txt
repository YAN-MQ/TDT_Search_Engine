As President Clinton ponders a military strategy against Iraq, and 
the Pentagon once more picks its targets and programs its cruise missiles 
for an attack, the debate at the White House is whether to simply 
punish President Saddam Hussein, or to try to change his political 
course by force, U.S. officials say. The United States prepared Wednesday 
to send enough military firepower to the Persian Gulf to batter Iraq 
for weeks. No battle plans have been selected yet, but nothing short 
of a sustained assault involving hundreds, perhaps thousands of bombs 
and missiles can break the Iraqi leader's will and stop Baghdad's 
defiance of the United Nations and the rebuilding of its arsenals, 
the officials say. ``What would be required is very substantial bombing, 
lasting for weeks,'' said Zalmay Khalizad, a former senior Pentagon 
and State Department official. ``But you cannot be certain that even 
that will do the job.'' ``You may have to go get Saddam Hussein to 
force him to change his mind,'' he said. ``It will either require 
a lot of bombing or a lot more than bombing to coerce him. Without 
that, we may simply acquiesce to his possession of these weapons and 
to his presence for a long time.'' If Clinton wants to punish Saddam 
for defying U.N. weapons inspectors, that is easy: He can bomb Iraq 
for days, pounding the leader's palaces and weapons depots into dust. 
But this may not end the threat posed by a ruler who knows how to 
build biological and chemical weapons, and has hidden away the wherewithal 
to make them. ``The problem of Iraq is a very difficult one and it 
will not be solved magically by an air campaign,'' said John Deutch, 
the former director of Central Intelligence. Bombs alone, he said, 
cannot ``destroy all the stock of biological or chemical agents or 
missiles that Saddam Hussein has,'' or alter the Iraqi leadership. 
No one in Washington believes that friendly persuasion will force 
Iraq to resume cooperating with the United Nations weapons inspectors, 
who for nearly seven years have sought to discover and destroy Iraq's 
capacity to make war. Defense Secretary William Cohen says the United 
States may try ``degrading his capability of manufacturing the weapons 
of mass destruction'' with cruise missiles and smart bombs. But without 
intensive inspections, these capabilities can be rebuilt over time. 
And the inspections regime has collapsed. Nine months ago, U.S. commanders 
publicly identified likely targets of a new attack in response to 
Iraq's rejection of inspections. They include the Special Republican 
Guard, a 26,000-strong military unit that protects the Iraqi leader 
and his weaponry, and the suspected weapons sites themselves. Forewarned, 
Iraq has taken measures to safeguard those targets. So it now appears 
that nothing short of an attack greater than any the United States 
has launched since the Persian Gulf war in 1991 could permanently 
damage the institutions that shore up Saddam and shield his secret 
arsenals. Iraq says the crisis will end only if the United Nations 
ends the harsh economic sanctions imposed after the gulf war. Those 
sanctions contribute to the deaths of up to 7,000 children a month 
and are embittering the Iraqi people, according to Deniam in power. 
In 1996 the United States again hit Iraq with cruise missiles, attacking 
targets in the south to punish the Iraqi military for invading opposition 
strongholds in the north. The missiles achieved little of lasting 
military or political consequence. In fact, in the judgment of U.S. 
intelligence officials, the Iraqi leader emerged stronger politically. 
But without a likely successor who might lead Iraq, a U.S. effort 
to undermine Saddam could could reap a whirlwind. Gen. Anthony Zinni 
of the Marines, commander of U.S. forces in the Persian Gulf, warned 
Congress last month, ``A weakened, fragmented, chaotic Iraq _ which 
could happen if this isn't done carefully _ is more dangerous in the 
long run than a contained Saddam is now.''
