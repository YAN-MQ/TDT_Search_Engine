No deadlines have been set, but the United States warns time is running 
out for Iraq to comply with U.N. weapons inspections. The state department 
says there are no plans to negotiate with Iraqi President Saddam Hussein 
because talks are not necessary. Defense secretary William Cohen ordered 
the "USS enterprise" aircraft carrier to arrive in the Persian gulf 
ahead of schedule. It will replace the "USS Eisenhower." Cohen says 
Iraq is responsible for a flagrant violation of U.N. mandates and 
that President Clinton is weighing various options. The security council's 
credibility is on the line. The U.N.'s credibility is on the line, 
and I think the U.S. credibility as well in terms of simply allowing 
him to flout his obligations. And I believe that most people now recognize 
that. And if it becomes necessary to take military action, I would 
expect that there would be certainly more support than before.
