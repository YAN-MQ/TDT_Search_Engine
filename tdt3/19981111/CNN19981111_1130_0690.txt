Fall and binter are the peak seasons for roto-virus, a common bug 
that can result in diarrhea, vomiting and plenty of worried parents. 
It's usual lit not too serious, but rote dough virus sending up to 
100,000 children to the hospital each year in the United States. Studies 
show children who attend day care are most at risk. It's spread what's 
known fecal oral route, essentially, someone with dirty hands who 
may be just changed a diaper. Almost every child in the world gets 
the virus by age 4. fortunately, it doesn't last more than a week. 
And now there may be a way for small children and their parents to 
avoid the ordeal all together. A roto-virus vaccine. It is given to 
babies by mouth at 2, 4, and 6 months of age. The vaccine won't prevent 
all roto-virus, but it should protect against the most severe cases.
