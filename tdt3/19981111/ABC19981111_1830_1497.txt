As we said, tomorrow is veteran's day. It is the 80th anniversary 
of world war I. it is argued by some historians that in the last half 
century, the horror of war has not been clear enough. ABC's Jim Wooten 
tonight on the effect that a movie is having on a famous american 
cemetery overseas. Each new tide erases more traces of that long-ago 
yesterday, when here on this beach some many Americans, not much more 
than boys, waded into france, into history. And thousands never left. 
We are trying to keep in posterity the memory of all these airmen, 
soldiers buried here. For years, superintendent Phil rivers has watched 
over the 9,000 graves in the cemetery above Omaha beach, has watched 
the visitors come and go, but this year, something different. Because 
of a movie, "saving private Ryan," this gritty story of the invasion, 
more Americans are coming to Normandy now. Six weeks after the film 
came out, we started noticing an increase of american tourists. The 
film provoked their visit. This place blows you away. I mean, it's 
pretty moving. I think the movie brought the war that our fathers 
fought down to a real personal level. Beth jimenez saw it back home 
in North Carolina. And since I saw the movie, I've been wanting to 
come. I realized how many died and a little better about what that 
was all about than I had before. It is a powerful place, this place, 
it speaks to thousands of men who did their duty and more. However 
they are remembered in cemetery or song or flag or film they are worth 
remembering. There's not wherein why but to die do and die. The movie 
remembers them as young men and it is that quality, the ordinary American's 
extraordinary sacrifice, that seems to have attracted so many, not 
only to the fictional story, but here to the reality of its setting. 
The generation that was born after the war and have seen the film 
look at the uncle, the father, the grandfather in a different way 
now. They understand why he never talked about it. Who would have 
believed it? Tomoow'shild But, for those who survived that unbelievable 
day, 20,000 days ago, no movie is required. Jim Wooten, ABC News, 
Omaha beach.
