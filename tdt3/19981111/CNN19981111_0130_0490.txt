This is meteorologist Valerie Voss with your "CNN Headline News Weather" 
forecast through Wednesday. Our strong storm in the eastern United 
States moves northward into Canada, taking the snow and wind with 
it. We will see some rain or snow showers moving through the northeast. 
Thunderstorms will move across the east coast and off the coast, also, 
into the gulf of Mexico. Look for a few rain or snow showers along 
the front through the north-central U.S. and an area of low pressure 
pulls in across California through the southwest, with some rain and 
mountain snow as well. Highs on Wednesday anywhere from 30s north, 
to 60s and 70s south, with some 80s in southern Florida. Looking ahead 
then to Thursday, rain in the northwest around the Great Lakes and 
in the south-central part of the country. On Friday, we'll see snow 
around the Great Lakes, showers in the northwest and some showers 
and thunderstorms developing in the western gulf of mexico. For Saturday, 
it will be wet in much of the east, with rain and wind in the northwest 
as well. Don't forget, you can find four-day forecasts for more than 
7,200 cities at cNN.com.
