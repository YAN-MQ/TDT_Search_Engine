In Washington today, the Dalai Lama, the spiritual leader of Tibetan 
buddhists, who lives in exile, has had a series of high-level meetings 
with U.S. officials. Though there were only limited pictures allowed, 
he saw the president and mrs. Clinton, "old friends" he called them. 
He also saw the vice president and the secretary of state. The Dalai 
Lama, who has many admirers here, has lived in exile since the late 
1950s, when an uprising against the Chinese occupation of Tibet failed. 
Today, he said there is too much distrust between him and the Chinese 
leaders to have a meaningful dialogue.
