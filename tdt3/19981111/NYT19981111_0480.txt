Now that Bobby Bo is back in the Mets' uniform as an outfielder who 
will be age 36 by opening day, maybe he will fit that uniform better 
this time. Maybe. In a trade of two players that neither team wanted, 
the Mets reacquired Bobby Bonilla, their $29 million crybaby in 1992, 
from the Los Angeles Dodgers in exchange for Mel Rojas, a right-handed 
reliever who threw so much gasoline on so many fires he was utterly 
useless late last season. Ideally, the Mets obtained Bonilla to hit 
behind the cleanup batter Mike Piazza, but he must prove he's more 
mature in dealing with Noo Yawk expectations and that he's capable 
of playing right field or left field, depending on which free-agent 
outfielder (B.J. Surhoff?) the Mets sign. ``Bobby comes with some 
risk,'' Bobby Valentine, the Mets' manager, said in a conference call 
from Naples, Fla., where the major league general managers are meeting, 
``but also with a lot of reward, and I think the Met fans will be 
rewarded.'' According to Valentine, the risk is ``whether he catches 
the ball when it comes down.'' Even more of a risk is how much Bonilla 
has left as a slugger after a season with the Florida Marlins and 
the Dodgers when he wasn't always able to play because of a damaged 
left wrist and an intestinal infection. When he did play last season, 
Bonilla didn't hit anywhere near the way he did in other years with 
the Pirates, the Mets and the Orioles. After earning a 1997 World 
Series ring as the Florida Marlins' third baseman when he hit 17 homers 
and drove in 96 runs, he arrived at spring training following surgery 
on his left wrist and left Achilles' tendon. In 100 games with the 
Marlins and the Dodgers, he batted .249 with 11 homers and 45 runs 
batted in. Ever since Davey Johnson was hired last month as the Dodgers' 
new manager, the whispers were that Johnson, who had Bonilla in Baltimore, 
demanded that Bonilla be traded. Johnson denied that Wednesday, saying: 
``I hate to lose Bobby, he's a great hitter. He helped me get to a 
league championship series in Baltimore.'' Johnson also blamed the 
Baltimore news media for the turmoil over Bonilla's wanting to play 
right field rather than being the Orioles' designated hitter in 1996. 
``That was over in two weeks,'' Johnson said. ``I finally put him 
in right field and left him alone. He caught everything he got to.'' 
But if Bonilla is such a ``great hitter,'' why were the Dodgers so 
quick to trade him? Especially for such a disaster as Rojas was? The 
reality of this trade is that the Dodgers, for whatever reasons, didn't 
want Bonilla, and the Mets, for obvious reasons, were delighted to 
deal Rojas. In the confusion, the Mets reportedly will receive from 
the Dodgers the $1.4 million differential in their 1999 salaries _ 
$5.9 million for Bonilla, $4.5 million for Rojas. According to Frank 
Cashen, the Mets' interim general manager, he completed the deal that 
had been ``principally engineered'' by Steve Phillips, the general 
manager now on a leave of absence. Bonilla, then baseball's highest-paid 
player, had signed his five-year, $29 million Mets contract in 1992 
when Al Harazin was the general manager. Cashen, the architect of 
the 1986 World Series champions, had retired, but Cashen is aware 
of Bonilla's problems with Met fans as well as the Noo Yawk news media. 
On his arrival that off season, Bonilla, who grew up in the Bronx, 
said that nothing would ``wipe the smile'' off his face. ``I'm from 
New York, I've got tough skin,'' he said then. ``I just want to do 
what's on the back of my bubble-gum cards.'' Bonilla's famous smile 
soon disappeared. To escape the boos, he wore earplugs. He loudly 
disputed official scorers' calls. In an ugly clubhouse scene with 
a reporter, he snapped: ``I'll show you the Bronx right here. I will 
hurt you.'' The next day he publicly apologized. ``He's matured since 
that time,'' Cashen said. ``He understands what he's getting into.'' 
According to Bonilla, his maturation as a Met occurred when a newspaper 
cartoon had him wearing a diaper. Annoyed, he showed it to his wife, 
Millie, but when she laughed, he laughed. But on Bobby Bo's second 
time around with the Mets, laughing won't mean much unless he hits 
and he catches those fly balls.
