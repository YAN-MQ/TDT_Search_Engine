Secretary of State Madeleine Albright on Wednesday welcomed the Israeli 
Cabinet's approval of the Middle East accord ``as an important step 
forward in the peace process,'' State Department spokesman James Rubin 
said. ``With that decision having been made, she believes all concerned 
must now proceed to implement the agreement as quickly as possible,'' 
he said. But he made no reference to the conditions set by the Israeli 
Cabinet. Other American officials said the Israeli conditions did 
little more than state understandings already reached at the talks 
in Wye, Md. They expressed relief that Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu 
of Israel succeeded in getting the accord through his Cabinet without 
the need to call new elections now. And they said that a formula for 
a vote by the Palestinian National Council, and other Palestinians, 
to change the Palestinian charter and formally remove clauses calling 
for Israel's destruction would be forthcoming. The vote will take 
place with President Clinton himself in attendance. ``There will be 
a clear and unambiguous reaffirmation that will satisfy the needs 
of both sides,'' said National Security Council spokesman David Leavy. 
A senior Israeli official in Washington, briefing reporters, said 
that Israel understood at Wye that there would be some form of vote 
by a quorum of the Palestine National Council. But he refused to define 
what sort of vote might satisfy Israel, implying that a voice vote 
might be enough, or to say how many members would be a quorum. In 
general, Leavy said, the Cabinet vote, despite the delays, ``is certainly 
a positive step forward.'' The Wye agreement ``is in Israel's security 
interests and in the interests of the peace process,'' he said. ``The 
tough challenge now is to get down to final-status issues and we're 
eager to do it.'' About suggestions that Netanyahu might restart construction 
of housing at Har Homa, within Jerusalem's boundaries, Ms. Albright 
``said clearly that we don't want actions to be taken that undermine 
or harm the environment in which the implementation of Wye and the 
final-status talks must take place,'' Rubin said.
