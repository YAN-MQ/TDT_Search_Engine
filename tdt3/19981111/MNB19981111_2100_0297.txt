We go to the Pentagon, Jim miklazewski, where he can update us on 
preparations for significant air strikes against Iraq. That's right. 
Today secretary defense William Cohen said any air strikes would be 
significant. We're told that there are hundreds of targets in the 
mix. The military buildup tonight continues. More fighter bombers, 
more bombers, more troops on their way to the Persian gulf tonight, 
but there's a new concern that's been raised once again, brian. There's 
fear that aircraft strikes alone may not be able to do the job. Sailors 
at Norfolk naval base said they were tired of being pushed around 
by Saddam Hussein. Cohen assured the troops this time the U.S. won't 
back down. We're not playing games with Saddam Hussein. We're saying, 
"comply" more war planes headed to the gulf in preparation for possible 
air strikes. NBC news learned a C.I.A. assessment given to President 
Clinton this week makes it clear how difficult it will be to take 
out the chemical and biological weapons. The report identifies four 
potential targets believed to produce raw materials for chemical weapons. 
They also produce medical vaccines. Because the plants produce medicine, 
the president wants to take them off the target list. The president 
also wants to avoid other targets that might hurt the Iraqi people, 
like power plants. Would it hand the Iraqis a powerful issue that 
could turn international opinion in Saddam's favor. Air strikes would 
target air strips, planes and missiles. Anything could be used to 
launch Saddam's deadly weapons. White House officials deny tonight 
that President Clinton is taking any targets off the list. We're told 
a lot of those targets he doesn't want to hit aren't going to be put 
on the list in the first place. There is growing concern here that 
whater the plan is, it may not be enough. Jim miklazewski at the Pentagon 
for us this evening.
