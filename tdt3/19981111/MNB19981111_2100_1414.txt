More to tell you as we continue, including more about the timing of 
a Possible attack here, how it's tied to a potential threat from space. 
It was one of those moments in life you want to keep. My husband thought 
he was getting dinner. My daughter...A new friend. Time to cook the 
lobster! When the moment came, I didn't have to worry about the light 
being low hey! That's my lobster! Or them turning out blurry because 
they were moving. With Kodak Max, I knew I'd get my picture. Low light, 
sunlight, action or still Kodak Max is all you need to know about 
film.
