The day of referring to America's big three automakers came to an 
end. Chrisler's merger with Daimler-Benz became official and Chrysler 
corporation stock ceased training with today's closing bell. Jim Avila 
has more on the end of an era. Now it's the big two. Cliceler, America's 
third largest automaker joins Mercedes Benz, forming a New company, 
Daimler Chrysler. Taking orders from Germany. At the Wall Street close 
this afternoon, Chrysler and its company system bol "C" were taken 
off the big board. The end of a remarkable turn around for a company 
that nearly went bankrupt in the 1980's that recovered with mini vans 
and jeeps and the marketing of lee Iacocca. Because of its size and 
speed, streamlined, designing cars faster than american competitors 
and making more profit per vehicle than G.M. or Ford. The key advantage 
Chrysler had is they're very nimble and very smart. Professor David 
Cole at the University of Michigan's automotive transportation department 
says cliceler makes more profit in a $20,000 car than Mercedes in 
a $43,000. Mercedes is interested in learning how to be more flexible 
and adaptable. Ought other experts point to quick decisions that take 
a car from computer drawing to show room in two years. The best in 
the industry. What that means is you're closer to the market, so you're 
closer to trends and closer to customer taste. Design teams are closer 
to each other, too. One huge building, 2/3 the size of Pentagon. 10,000 
workers side by side in constant contact with a new car. They can 
put in it a wind tunnel, test noise reduction, drive on test tracks. 
The latest car here 300-M. With a new partner as America's remaining 
big two watch closely. Jim Avila, NBC news, Chicago.
