Armed with automatic rifles, anti-narcotics police stopped a truck 
Wednesday packed with 5,000 kilograms (11,000 pounds) of hashish destined 
for markets in Europe and the United States, officials said. They 
said the truck was stopped just 10 kilometers (six miles) outside 
Peshawar, at the foot of the Khyber Pass that links Pakistan to neighboring 
Afghanistan _ one of the largest producers of opium, which is used 
to make heroin. It was the biggest hashish seizure by Pakistan's Anti-Narcotics 
Task Force, said Brig. Bharamand Shah, regional director of the force. 
''The fine quality hashish was hidden in sacks in the truck,'' he 
said. While the hashish was grown in Pakistan's tribal area that borders 
Afghanistan, Shah told a news conference that there is more heroin 
coming across the border from Afghanistan. Since gaining control of 
much of northern Afghanistan, the Taliban religious army has tried 
to seal its borders with neighboring Central Asian states. That is 
bad news for Pakistan because Central Asia had become the preferred 
route of smugglers to move heroin out of Afghanistan, said Shah. ''... 
The route has shifted once again to Pakistan via the tribal areas,'' 
he said. About 200 heroin labs that refine raw opium into heroin are 
operating in Afghanistan's eastern Nangarhar province, which neighbors 
Pakistan. ''There was a bumper crop of poppies this year and the narcotics 
are being dumped in Peshawar and moved to the Punjab and then to Karachi,'' 
where it is loaded on ships, said Shah.
