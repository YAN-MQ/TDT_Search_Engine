President Boris Yeltsin ordered his prime minister Wednesday to step 
up efforts to attract private funding to help Russia destroy its massive 
stockpile of chemical weapons. Yeltsin's decree came amid mounting 
concerns about the costs of destroying Russia's 44,000 tons of deteriorating 
chemical weapons _ the largest stockpile in the world _ which it promised 
to get rid of when it ratified the international Chemical Weapons 
Convention last year. On Tuesday, a prominent analyst warned that 
Russia's cash-starved government may resort to burning the chemical 
weapons if it cannot come up with the money for more environmentally 
safe and internationally condoned methods of dismantling and disposal. 
The cost of destroying the weapons is estimated at dlrs 5.7 billion. 
The United States has given Russia dlrs 200 million to help. Yeltsin 
ordered Prime Minister Yevgeny Primakov to ``step up work to attract 
Russian and foreign investments in the construction of plants where 
chemical weapons are disposed of.'' Russia says it stopped producing 
chemical weapons in 1987.
