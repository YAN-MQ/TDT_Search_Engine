One bellwether stock leading the advance today is Intel. The company 
late yesterday forecast strong computer sales will boost revenues 
8% to 10% above the last quarter. Fn's Bruce Francis has more. Intel's 
business is so hot right now, dealers can resell some chips for more 
than Intel charges for them, a rare occurrence. Intel says it's not 
any single factor, all products are selling well in all parts of the 
world. That's one reason why Intel is predicting that the fourth quarter 
will be 8% to 10% better than the third. Analysts like Dan niles had 
been told to expect just a slight increase. This quarter's preannouncement 
is more driven by the macroeconomic picture just being a lot better 
overseas, combined with the spillover effect we saw in q-3. And Q-4 
is going to be a pretty good season as far as holiday sales. Intel 
is not only taking in more money, it's keeping more of it. Profit 
margins are expected to increase as well. That may finally propel 
Intel out of its trading range after attempting a Breakthrough many 
times. Niles sees $125 a share in 12 months. Intel's got an analyst 
meeting on Friday, and then they're out marketing after it. If this 
stock's not at its 52 week by then I'd be very surprised. The bottom 
line -- many of factors that caused Intel to disappoint investors 
have reversed. PC prices look more stable, inventories are now much 
lower and some Asian markets may be stabilizing. Bruce Francis, "CNN 
Financial News," New York.
