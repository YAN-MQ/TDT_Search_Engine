Israel's cabinet has narrowly approved the latest peace accord with 
the Palestinians. The Y River Accord passed with the support of just 
eight of the 17 Israeli cabinet members. Israeli Prime Minister, Benjamin 
Netanyahu, sought to make the accord more palatable to his ministers 
by attaching extra conditions, including one that requires separate 
cabinet approval for each stage of the Israeli pull pack. Israel is 
scheduled to redeploy its troops from another two percent of the West 
Bank on Monday. But senior Israeli officials have been saying the 
redeployment may be delayed by as much as a week.
