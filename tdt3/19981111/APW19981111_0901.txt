The northern town of Shkodra was calm but tense Wednesday, a day after 
armed men shot in the air and entered a government building in protest 
of several arrests. The unrest in Shkodra, 85 kilometers (50 miles) 
north of Tirana, and a stronghold of the opposition Democratic Party, 
began late Tuesday after police arrested three men _ all members of 
an anti-Communist union _ on charges of theft. Two of the men were 
later released, but a third, identified as Marjan Zef Gryka, 27, remained 
in custody. Local media reported Wednesday that Gryka was a former 
bodyguard of Azem Hajdari, a popular opposition leader who was killed 
Sept. 12. Hajdari's death sparked a week of violent protests in the 
capital. The reports said Gryka was arrested for confronting President 
Rexhep Mejdani during a visit to Shkodra last week while carrying 
weapons. But an Interior Ministry spokesman later said he was only 
charged with theft. A crowd of anti-Communists gathered in the town's 
main square late Tuesday, demanding the detained be released. They 
blocked off part of the town and started shooting into the air. State 
television later said some of the men had gained entry into the main 
local government building. The Organization for Security and Cooperation 
in Europe said its office in Shkodra had been looted of computers 
and other equipment and a vehicle had been stolen during the violence. 
Nobody was injured, said the organization. Late Wednesday, the OSCE 
condemned the theft and lootings, saying they ``raise serious concerns 
about the security situation in northern Albania.'' By Wednesday Shkodra 
appeared calm. Shops opened and people moved freely through the streets. 
Interior Ministry officials said special police units have were sent 
from Tirana to reinforce local officers. But the situation remained 
tense, with anti-Communist unions demanding Gryka's release by Wednesday 
evening as well as the replacement of Shkodra's police chief and several 
local government officials.
