When last we saw Tom Hanks with Meg Ryan, they fell in love before 
ever setting eyes on each other. ``What if someone you never met, 
someone you never saw, someone you never knew was the only someone 
for you?'' asked the advertisements for what seemed like a far-fetched 
fairy tale, ``Sleepless in Seattle.'' Five years later, people are 
falling in love with strangers across a crowded chat room, and e-mail 
has woven itself into the fabric of our day-to-day lives, an adult 
equivalent of passing notes in grade school. ``You've Got Mail,'' 
the new romantic comedy opening on Dec. 18 from Hanks, Ms. Ryan and 
Nora Ephron, the trio who made ``Sleepless in Seattle,'' close-focuses 
its camera on the care and feeding of an e-mail romance. When the 
producer Lauren Shuler Donner set her sights on updating the 1940 
classic ``The Shop Around the Corner,'' she had an inspiration: we'll 
use e-mail, she said. In Ernst Lubitsch's film of Nikolaus Laszlo's 
Hungarian play, James Stewart and Margaret Sullavan are feuding co-workers 
who correspond in eloquent epistles unaware that each is the other's 
secret pen pal. Nora Ephron, along with her sister and co-screenwriter, 
Delia, transformed this premise into ``You've Got Mail.'' Speaking 
by phone from her apartment on the Upper West Side in Manhattan, Ms. 
Ephron said: ``You couldn't really have done this 10 years ago. In 
that era of the 20th century, when mail had ceased to be a means of 
communication, you couldn't really have done a new version of `The 
Shop Around the Corner.' E-mail manages to bring back something that 
is old-fashioned.'' ``You've Got Mail'' not only brings back something 
old-fashioned; it also seizes on the spirit of the times. Peopled 
with New Yorkers knocking back Starbucks lattes while bemoaning the 
malling of America, the film encapsulates a late-20th-century ambivalence 
about progress and technology. Joe Fox, played by Hanks, owns and 
operates a chain of cappuccino-brewing mega-bookstores whose comfy 
chairs beckon browsers to idle away an hour. When he decides to open 
a branch on the Upper West Side, the small children's bookstore nearby, 
owned by Ms. Ryan's Kathleen, is threatened with extinction. Inherited 
from her mother, the 40-year-old business, called the Shop Around 
the Corner, so defines Kathleen that her on-line pseudonym is Shopgirl. 
At the start of the film, Kathleen's boyfriend, a typewriter-collecting 
neo-Luddite played by Greg Kinnear, proclaims that the computer heralds 
the end of Western civilization. As soon as he is out the door, Kathleen 
hurries to her laptop with a rush of guilty pleasure. Next we hear 
the familiar song of modems connecting as she logs on to America Online: 
Kathleen has met a special someone in cyberspace. As trend-spotters 
have spotted, e-mail has, in its way, revived the lost art of romantic 
letter-writing. In the film, an elderly character reminisces about 
his correspondence with a former sweetheart. ``She had beautiful penmanship,'' 
he muses, reminding us of a now irrelevant virtue. In electronic courtship, 
it is witty wordsmithing that wins hearts. Hanks and Ms. Ryan are 
engaged in a meeting of minds without bodies. Amorous e-mailers who 
have met in cyberspace ``feel that their relationship grew from the 
inside out instead of the outside in, as face-to-face relationships 
do,'' said Esther Gwinnell, author of ``Online Seductions: Falling 
in Love with Strangers on the Internet.'' She notes that such intimacy 
results from a feeling of security. ``You are in the safety of your 
own home,'' she said, ``where you can sit around in your ratty bathrobe 
and bunny slippers. You don't have the kind of social anxiety that 
you would have meeting people in person.'' Poring over her e-mail, 
Kathleen is enchanted by Joe's language. ``I would send you a bouquet 
of newly sharpened pencils if I knew your name and address,'' he writes. 
``On the other hand, this not knowing has its charms.'' Dr. Gwinnell 
acknowledges the charm: because the Internet offers virtually no information 
about a person, he or she becomes a ``tabula rasa,'' she said. ``You 
are able to fill in all the blanks from your imagination and fantasy.'' 
Sherry Turkle, author of ``Life on the Screen: Identity in the Age 
of the Internet,'' concurs. ``E-mail raises the possibility of projection 
to a higher power,'' she said. ``All you have are the other person's 
words. A great deal is left to the imagination.'' On-line conversation 
allows a suitor to perfect his personality. We see Hanks struggling 
with his words, backspacing, deleting and starting again until they 
are just right. As the book baron bares his softer side on line, the 
movie makes another point, one also made by Richard Booth in ``Romancing 
the Net: A Tell-All Guide to Love Online.'' ``Men tend to open up 
faster and divulge more of their thoughts and feelings on line,'' 
he said. While such attributes may jump-start an infatuation, a recent 
study from Carnegie Mellon University found that cyberspace is hardly 
an emotionally satisfying sphere. The study, ``Internet Paradox: A 
Social Technology That Reduces Social Involvement and Psychological 
Well-Being?,'' published in the September issue of American Psychologist, 
found that even moderate use of the Internet was associated with increased 
depression and loneliness. Internet use was also associated with a 
decline in the amount of time spent with family members and the size 
of one's social circle. In making the film _ renamed ``Sleepless in 
Cyberspace'' in a recent AOL chat room _ Ms. Shuler Donner was concerned 
about how to tell a story that transpires mostly under the fingertips 
of its two stars. ``It potentially could be static,'' she said. Delia 
Ephron added: ``We are very lucky that Tom Hanks and Meg Ryan are 
the two people writing the letters. Watching me compose e-mail would 
not be as riveting.'' Movies like ``The Net'' feature fancy computer 
graphics that enhance the visuals. ``We don't have anything going 
on on our computers but words,'' said Nora Ephron, ``which is what 
the movie is essentially about anyway.'' While the film offers less 
traditional action, otherwise workaday gestures take on new meaning. 
An index finger hovering hesitantly above the send button becomes 
a moment of high tension. Nora Ephron recalls that in a preview screening 
in Los Angeles, members of the audience called out, ``Delete it!'' 
when Hanks's character typed, ``Do you think we should meet?'' Not 
only is ``You've Got Mail'' the first film to document cybercourtship, 
it is also perhaps the first film to take the computer for granted. 
Its characters are not engaged in high-tech identity annihilation 
(``The Net'') or complex hackery (``Sneakers''). They are simply living 
their lives at the turn of the 20th century, meeting in one of AOL's 
16,000 chat rooms. And when they decide to meet, Joe and Kathleen 
experience all the anxieties that are part of love with a perfect 
stranger. Sure, they may look good in an attractive font, but what 
in the world will they be like f2f (that is, face to face)? Her friends 
tease Kathleen that NY152, as Joe calls himself on line, may well 
be the rooftop killer stalking the Upper West Side. What might that 
handle mean anyhow _ 152 pockmarks? 152 felonies? If this were (italics)not(end 
italics) a Nora Ephron film, he just might be the rooftop killer. 
In forthcoming movies like ``Net-Napped'' and ``Every Mother's Worst 
Fear,'' the Internet is exploited for all its electrical faults. But 
for many of us, the scariest part of the e-mail experience is the 
absence of new mail. As the Internet becomes a player in more lives, 
boy meets girl will become boy e-mails girl, and more and more movie 
couples undoubtedly will fall in love sight unseen.
