In this edition of "tech trends" we examine how computers are helping 
some inner-city residents live the American dream. Ann Kellan reports. 
This used to be all vacant lots and trash and weeds and rats. Tony 
alves and kelby mendes say living in the inner city of boston wasn't 
always easy. I grew up in Roxbury, Massachusetts. It's a pretty rough 
neighborhood to grow up in. I find that there aren't as many opportunities 
in the neighborhood as if you were to go to another neighborhood. 
Kelbe started college but wasn't able to continue. Tony was thinking 
about becoming a cop. Then Nick gleason sparked their interest in 
computers. I knew a lot of people in inner city areas who were good 
friends of mine who could clearly be doing this work but didn't have 
the network, didn't have the connections. Nick gleason along with 
Jim picorolo started this sew. First, they found places like this 
right in the inner city where kids could learn computer programming, 
specifically about how to design web pages. With five months training 
they were assigned to work at the Boston globe newspaper's web site. 
I cut foets off the Internet. We publish them on to their web site. 
It was weird. I enjoyed it right away. It automatically blows the 
picture up for you and allows you to rotate it. They love that they 
are now role models in the neighborhood where they grew up, where 
they have decided to stay. It is kind of like radical to be from urban 
neighborhoods and really fluent in computers and technology and stuff. 
So people kind of -- they kind of look up to me in a way. A lot of 
individuals see what I'm doing right now and they hear about citysoft 
through the media. They know what I do. And they say, I want to do 
that, too. Ann Kellan, CNN, Boston, Massachusetts.
