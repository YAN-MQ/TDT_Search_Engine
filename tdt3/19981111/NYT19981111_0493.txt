In the doorway of the room that houses ``The Letter Writing Project,'' 
a graceful, meditative installation by the 34-year-old Taiwan-born 
artist Lee Mingwei, you duck under a noren curtain. The noren _ a 
common feature in Japanese architecture _ is a translucent white scrim 
that lowers the height of the doorway by about a foot. Your head nods, 
your back bends, and suddenly you are bowing. Westerners don't expect 
to bow at an exhibition. But throughout Buddhist Asia, bowing is more 
than common courtesy. It signifies acceptance of the way of the universe: 
the importance of setting aside ego, of acknowledging the web that 
unites all beings, and of expressing gratitude for this miraculous 
gift of life. Bowing, it turns out, is integral to Lee's exhibition, 
on view here at the Fabric Workshop and Museum through Saturday. Lee, 
who lives in New York City, has minded the teachings he received for 
six summers, beginning at age 6, in a Chan monastery. (Chan is the 
Chinese ancestor of Zen.) Sent by his dissident parents, who were 
busy demonstrating for Taiwanese independence, Lee rose for meditation 
at 3 a.m. and learned the simple power of concentrating on daily activities 
at the side of his Chan master, Mou-chan. Before he became subject 
to the draft _ and possibly to the ``accidents'' that had claimed 
the lives of sons of dissidents _ his parents packed him off to San 
Francisco, to a high school run by Benedictines. College and graduate 
school followed. ``The Letter Writing Project'' is about bending to 
the mysterious necessity of loss: the commonplace transfigurations 
of death and passage. Three booths _ with walls of blond wood and 
frosted glass, akin to shoji screens _ offer stationery and envelopes 
on small tables. You are invited to express the unsayable to those 
who are beyond reach. (Next fall, letters will be ceremonially floated 
down a river on paper lanterns and burned, in accordance with Asian 
Bon festival practice.) Slats in the walls display previous efforts 
_ envelopes addressed `To my father which I will never see'' or ``In 
memory of Jamal,'' testaments to the shared difficulties of letting 
go. When you take up the pen, the act of writing gives thoughts a 
curious weight. Some words seem to obstruct the pen, others to encourage 
it. The actuality of having written changes the writer subtly. Something 
is made real, then given away. In Lee's view, this ``emptying out'' 
is a healing. To that end, he has varied the height of the table, 
obliging you to assume one of the three meditative postures of Buddhism: 
standing, sitting, kneeling. Each posture has its mental correlate: 
gratitude, insight, forgiveness. Thus the three components that create 
karma _ body, speech and thought _ are all activated as you write. 
The karma has been great for Lee ever since he arrived at Yale, from 
which he earned a master of fine arts degree. Knowing no one, he put 
up notices all over campus promising to cook an intimate dinner for 
anyone who signed up. His mother asked what he was doing in school, 
and he said, ``Hanging out at Stop &AMP; Shop.'' He explains: ``My 
interest was to find a connection with a community through food. My 
grandmother used to do this.'' Dinner became Lee's first gallery show, 
``The Dining Project,'' which opened at Lombard-Fried Fine Arts in 
SoHo on May 31, 1997, a week after his graduation from Yale. On an 
elegant tatami-mat platform, Lee served one person a night, chosen 
by lottery. Among the guests were David A. Ross and Eugenie Tsai of 
the Whitney Museum. Ms. Tsai's ancestors, like Lee's, came from mainland 
China, though they bypassed Taiwan and settled in the United States. 
At dinner, Ms. Tsai was initially nervous but quickly charmed. ``I 
found myself talking about very personal things,'' she says, ``although 
I had just met this person.'' Ms. Tsai took ``The Dining Project'' 
to the Whitney last May; it was Lee's first museum show. Photographs 
of Lee serving dinner on tatami mats at the museum recently occupied 
half an issue of the French art magazine Ninety. The Whitney installation 
included the first two booths of ``The Letter Writing Project.'' Lee's 
grandmother had recently died, and he had been composing long epistles 
to her containing everything he could not say during life to this 
forceful woman who studied Western medicine and lived in Japan (hence 
Lee's love of things Japanese). In its completed form at the Fabric 
Workshop, ``The Letter Writing Project'' is his tribute to her, and 
to the strange power of releasing strong emotions to the air and water.
