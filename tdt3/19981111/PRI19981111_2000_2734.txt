Battlefields and Mel Gibson are clues to today's geography stumper. 
Our mystery spot is on a peninsula in Southeast Europe near the Aegean 
Sea and it is the site of one of the bloodiest battles of World War 
I. British, Australian, and New Zealand military forces stormed this 
site in April 1915 attempting to force the Turks out of the war. More 
than 300,000 casualties were reported. Today a Turkish national park 
covers this former battleground and a final clue for movie buffs, 
the name of our spot was the title of a 1981 film which launched a 
young 25-year-old Mel Gibson into international stardom. What is this 
site? Of one of World War I's deadliest battles? The answer in a few 
minutes.
