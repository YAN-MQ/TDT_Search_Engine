England and Liverpool star Michael Owen was set to learn Wednesday 
the extent of the hamstring injury he suffered in the Reds' 3-1 home 
defeat to Tottenham in the League Cup. The 18-year-old striker, who 
shot to international stardom with his goal-scoring exploits at the 
World Cup in France, was injured while scoring Liverpool's only goal 
in Tuesday night's fourth-round game at Anfield. Owen fell down in 
pain after stretching to shoot with his left foot into an open net 
in the 81st minute. He was helped off the pitch and watched the rest 
of the match holding an ice pack to his hamstring. Owen is doubtful 
for Saturday's Premier League game against Leeds and England's international 
friendly against the Czech Republic at Wembley next Wednesday. Liverpool 
received another injury blow Tuesday when midfield star Steve McManaman, 
who missed the Tottenham game, was told to rest for up to six weeks 
because of a recurrent Achilles injury. He may not return until early 
January. The injuries are the latest setback to a Liverpool club which 
is in crisis following two straight home defeats, with speculation 
mounting that co-manager Roy Evans is on the way out.
