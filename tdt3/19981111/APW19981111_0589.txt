Support for the governing African National Congress has dropped to 
an all-time low since it won elections in 1994 that ended white minority 
rule, an opinion poll released Wednesday said. The most comprehensive 
independent survey so far in the lead-up to 1999 elections also showed 
that apartheid's ruling group, the National Party, has lost many of 
its former backers. If the elections were held tomorrow, only 51 percent 
would vote for the ANC, down from 64 percent in 1995, the poll found. 
The National Party would claim 10 percent of the vote, down from 16 
percent shortly after the election. The tiny Democratic Party was 
the only party to show a gain, going from 1 percent in 1994 to 7 percent. 
Undecideds rose from 12 percent to 21 percent. The poll, which queried 
2,200 eligible voters, was conducted in September by Markinor research 
group with the backing of the nation's public broadcaster, SABC, and 
the Institute for Democracy in South Africa. The pollsters cited a 
margin of error between 0.95 percent and 2.1 percent. The ANC aims 
to increase its majority in Parliament to two-thirds in 1999, up from 
the 60 percent it now holds.
