Professor Milton Handler, a leading antitrust expert and drafter of 
some of the nation's best-known laws, died on Tuesday. He was 95. 
Handler suffered a stroke on Thursday, said his daughter, Carol E. 
Handler. Handler, who taught at Columbia University Law School for 
nearly half a century, ranged far beyond the classroom. He was President 
Franklin D. Roosevelt's chief adviser on antitrust matters, served 
as the first general counsel to the National Labor Relations Board 
and helped to draft such landmark statutes as the Federal Food, Drug 
and Cosmetic Act of 1938, the National Labor Relations Act and the 
GI Bill of Rights. In the 1950s and 1960s, he became one of the top 
antitrust litigators in the country. An ardent Zionist, he was close 
to the founders of the Israeli state and participated in the legal 
brief submitted to the United Nations in support of the 1947 partition 
plan. His proudest legal achievement, he often said, was securing 
Albert Einstein's papers for Hebrew University. ``In the realm of 
trade regulation he was a colossus and in all respects he lived grandly 
in the law,'' said Justice Ruth Bader Ginsberg of the United States 
Supreme Court, who is among the many prominent jurists who studied 
under Handler and later became friends. The youngest of seven children, 
he was born in the Bronx in 1903. His father died when he was 2, and 
the family moved to Brooklyn. He graduated from Columbia College in 
1923 and briefly dreamed of teaching literature before he became captivated 
by the law. He graduated from Columbia Law School in 1926 with top 
honors. For one year he was a clerk for Justice Harlan Fiske Stone 
of the Supreme Court, for whom he developed a lifelong admiration, 
and then was invited by the dean of the Columbia Law School to teach 
trade regulation in the summer session. That marked the beginning 
of a 45-year teaching career. One of his first assignments at the 
Supreme Court had been to help Stone draft his landmark opinion in 
Trenton Potteries vs. the United States, a ruling that held that price-fixing 
agreements always violated the Sherman Act, whether or not the prices 
charged were reasonable. From then on, Handler focused his intellectual 
energies on antitrust issues, a scholarly endeavor that became, as 
he later put it, ``the essence of my life.'' As a teacher who taught 
by the Socratic method, he was diligent, even daunting. ``By working 
day and night I was able to amass enough knowledge for each class 
session, generally being one day ahead of the class,'' he later wrote. 
In 1932, while still in his 20s, Handler was drafted by the Roosevelt 
campaign to work on the Democrats' antitrust message and stayed on 
as the administration's chief antitrust adviser. In 1937, he helped 
create the Temporary National Economic Committee. The summary of antitrust 
law that he wrote for the committee has since because part of the 
legal canon. During World War II, Handler served on the Lend-Lease 
Administration. He was also a key organizer of a government emergency 
board to rescue Jews from the Holocaust. In January 1944, Handler 
drafted the executive order creating the War Refugee Board, but only 
after an uphill battle for support. ``One cannot but wonder how many 
lives might have been saved if the board had been set up in the early 
war years,'' he later said. After the war, Handler prepared amendments 
to the Social Security Act that later became the foundation for Medicare. 
He was especially proud of his role in creating the GI Bill of Rights. 
``Nothing is more important than providing people with the skills 
that they get from an education,'' he later wrote. By the 1950s, Handler 
was developing one of the most successful private antitrust practices 
in the country. He became a partner in a leading New York law firm, 
Kaye, Scholer, Fierman, Hays &AMP; Handler. As counsel and litigator, 
he represented some of the nation's biggest corporations, including 
Xerox, Pepsico, the American Tobacco Co. and Texaco, and he argued 
many cases before the Supreme Court. By then, Handler's reputation 
as a scholar was so stellar that judges, many of whom had been his 
students or were devotees of his published lectures, frequently consulted 
him. ``He had an extraordinary presence in the courtroom,'' recalled 
David Klingsberg, chairman of Kaye, Scholer, who worked closely with 
Handler starting in the early 1960s. ``Judges listened to what he 
had to say.'' Prolific well into his 90s, Handler published numerous 
articles, casebooks and texts, including classics on trade regulation, 
labor law and antitrust. His annual series of antitrust lectures, 
published in three separate collections, have long been considered 
required reading for anyone interested in the field. On antitrust 
matters, Handler's philosophy was distinctively centrist. ``He stood 
for balance,'' said his daughter, who is also an antitrust lawyer. 
His philosophy was that the principle of economic competition was 
as fundamental to American democracy as the freedom to express competing 
ideas. In the ``big is bad'' 50s and 60s, Handler criticized the government 
control of business issues preferred by Justices William O. Douglas 
and Hugo L. Black. But in the 80s, he also said the Reagan and Bush 
administrations brought too few antitrust cases. Human nature had 
not changed, he liked to point out. Handler was granted numerous prizes 
and honorary degrees. Last May, he received the prestigious John Sherman 
Award from the antitrust division of the Justice Department. Elegant 
and urbane, Handler lived on Park Avenue and had a second home in 
Palm Beach and closets so full of suits and elegant shoes that house 
guests were hard pressed to find an empty hanger or shelf. A lover 
of music, interesting people and dinner parties, he could talk intelligently 
on subjects ranging from the law and politics to philosophy and biography. 
Handler enjoyed excellent health until almost the end. Indeed, he 
had just been host at a dinner for some of New York's leading legal 
lights at the Four Seasons a few nights before he suffered a stroke, 
dominating the conversation with witty anecdotes. Handler's first 
wife, Marion Winter Kahn, whom he married in 1931, died in 1953. His 
second wife, Miriam Adler, whom he married in 1955, died in 1997. 
In addition to his daughter, he is survived by two granddaughters, 
Alisa Marion Schoenbach and Ilana Abigail Schoenbach.
