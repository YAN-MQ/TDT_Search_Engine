The seizure in the United States of a Colombian air force plane stocked 
with over a ton of cocaine is another blot for a military already 
beleaguered by leftist rebels and human rights investigations. The 
incident is also an embarrassment for President Andres Pastrana, who 
has assured the United States he will strengthen Colombia's commitment 
against drug trafficking. Colombia's air force commander resigned 
Tuesday after U.S. customs authorities found 1,639 pounds (743 kilograms) 
of cocaine in the cargo compartments of a Colombian air force C-130 
Hercules that landed Monday at Fort Lauderdale's international airport 
on a weekly supply run to pick up military equipment. Pastrana accepted 
the resignation of Gen. Jose Manuel Sandoval, though no arrests or 
criminal charges have been announced. U.S. and Colombian officials 
said the incident was unlikely to affect relations, which improved 
dramatically after Pastrana took office in August, replacing Ernesto 
Samper. The United States revoked Samper's visa in 1996, convinced 
he knowingly accepted dlrs 6 million in campaign contributions from 
the Cali drug cartel. By contrast, U.S. officials hailed Pastrana's 
election as a new opportunity for cooperation with the country that 
supplies over 80 percent of the cocaine sold in the United States. 
In Colombia, the incident was seen as the latest symptom of a military 
in decay. ``There has been a moral deteroriation of huge proportions 
with the Colombian armed forces, '' said Javeriana University political 
scientist Andres Franco. ``This deserves a more profound discussion, 
much more than the rhetoric saying that heads should roll.'' The discovery 
of cocaine in the air force plane could be the just a small fraction 
of the criminal activity within the Colombian security forces. ``If 
this is what we know, what don't we know?'' he said. Two weeks ago, 
news leaked that a former army colonel who headed a now-disbanded 
army intelligence unit was wanted for planning the 1995 assassination 
of a top conservative leader. Four soldiers are already under arrest 
in the killing of Alvaro Gomez. Numerous other investigations have 
linked the army to Colombia's feared paramilitary groups _ right-wing 
death squads who massacre civilians suspected of collaborating with 
rebels. Military leaders are also struggling to explain their faltering 
performance against the rebels, who now control about one-third of 
the country. The guerrillas, who held a remote state capital for three 
days last month, have been piling up military victories since 1996 
and now hold nearly 300 soldiers and police prisoner. The armed forces 
chief, Gen. Fernando Tapias, was grilled in Congress on Tuesday by 
lawmakers demanding explanations for both the air force incident and 
the army's mounting losses. This week's scandal isn't the first implicating 
Colombia's 12,000-member air force in drug trafficking. In the most 
embarrassing incident, Colombian authorities found 8 pounds (3.6 kilograms) 
of heroin in the nose and luggage compartment of then-President Ernesto 
Samper's official airplane. Three former air force mechanics were 
convicted last week of stashing the drugs on the plane, which was 
getting ready to take Samper to the U.N. General Assembly in New York.
