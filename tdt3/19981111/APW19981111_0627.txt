Rival monks hurled trash, furniture and curses Wednesday on the eve 
of an election to choose the new head of Chogye Chong, South Korea's 
largest Buddhist denomination. ``Hey! You dirty monks! Are you monks 
or hoodlums?'' several housewives shouted while watching the clash 
at Chogye Temple in central Seoul, which houses headquarters of the 
denomination. As worshipers urged them to end their brawling and shoving 
matches, the rival monks turned the usually serene temple into a battleground 
strewn with trash and broken chairs. For years, Chogye has been plagued 
by internal conflicts. The simmering conflicts erupted again ahead 
of Thursday's election to select the next head of Chogye's General 
Secretariat, a powerful post in charge of naming chief monks at the 
denomination's 1,700 temples across the country. Incumbent General 
Secretary Song Wol-joo is seeking a third consecutive four-year term. 
This week, Wol Ha, the supreme monk of the Chogye denomination, urged 
Song to step down, but Song ignored him. Song hired dozens of black-clothed 
bodyguards to prevent rival monks from storming the five-story pagoda-shaped 
concrete building where he and his followers were holed up. Outside 
the building, about 300 monks and worshipers gathered to demand Song's 
resignation and a postponement of the election. They used ropes to 
rip off steel-framed windows and doors. Song's followers sprayed fire 
extinguishers and used water hoses to stymie several monks trying 
to crawl inside the building on ladders. Hundreds of riot police were 
dispatched with batons and shields, but did not intervene. The monks 
did not shout slogans and refused to be interviewed by reporters. 
But their leaflets accused each other of corruption. Chogye claims 
8 million worshipers. South Korea has a population of 44 million.
