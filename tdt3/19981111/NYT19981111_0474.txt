Last year's teen slasher smash, ``I Know What You Did Last Summer,'' 
proved that each generation of adolescents is new to the genre's creaky 
conventions. The formula calls for invincible, barely visible villains 
(Jason of ``Friday the 13th,'' Michael Myers of ``Halloween,'' Freddy 
Krueger of ``Nightmare on Elm Street'') shrouded in malevolent headgear 
(goalie mask, Halloween mask, felt brim fedora) and wielding sharp, 
shiny implements (hunting knife, carving knife, razorlike Lee press-on 
nails). The most important convention is the sequel, the ceaseless 
serializing of serial killing. ``Friday,'' ``Halloween'' and ``Nightmare'' 
have spawned 20 unholy offspring. And last week, the inevitable first 
sequel to ``Summer'' opened. In the original, an angst-riddled angler 
named Ben Willis (Muse Watson), wearing a black sou'wester and brandishing 
an ice hook, terrorizes the teen-age townies Julie James (Jennifer 
Love Hewitt), Ray Bronson (Freddie Prinze Jr.) and their innumerable 
soon-to-croak cronies in a North Carolina seaside burg. Julie and 
Ray live to see the sequel, and so does _ surprise! _ Fisherman Ben. 
This time the three are joined in the Bahamas (don't ask) by Karla 
Wilson (the mononamed pop star Brandy). The film concludes with the 
sine qua non of sequeldom, an ambiguous ending. With that in mind, 
we asked two of Hollywood's hottest young screenwriters to plot out 
endless ``Summer'' sequels. When they turned us down, we did it ourselves. 
``I Know What You Did in the Summer of '42'' In this prequel to ``I 
Know What You Did Last Summer,'' the grandparents of Julie and Ray 
cope with the horrors of World War II by playing beach volleyball, 
catamaran-sailing and lawn bowling in East Hampton with Hermie and 
Oscy, teen-age heroes of the 1971 crypto-classic ``Summer of '42.'' 
The older movie's Older Woman, Jennifer O'Neill, seduces a young beachcomber 
(Jonathan Taylor Thomas) who boasts of his conquest to multinamed 
classmates Jennifer Love Hewitt, Jennifer Jason Leigh, Mary Elizabeth 
Mastrantonio, Mary Stuart Masterson, Mary Louise Parker, Sarah Jessica 
Parker and Sarah Michelle Gellar. ``I Know What You'll Do Next Summer'' 
Julie and Ray are transported to 23d-century Los Angeles, where the 
only living link to the city's past is Bob Hope, whose 392rd annual 
NBC Christmas special is as fresh as ever. The great-great-great-great-great 
grandson of Fisherman Ben (Freddie Prinze Jr. Jr. Jr. Jr. Jr.) is 
not casting crankbait _ he's casting movies! When he asks, ``Where's 
the hook?'' he's in a pitch meeting! As president of 24th Century 
Fox, Ben is still looking for fresh ideas. He tells his idea people 
to stop living in the 2200s, and the studio releases the only non-sequel 
in the last 200 years. Alas, Romulo Ebert of The Mars Daily Planet 
gives the movie three thumbs down. ``I Know What Hugh Did Last Summer'' 
Fisherman Ben washes ashore on a private beachfront in Malibu, where 
Westec security guards frog-march him off the property, the summer 
rental of Hugh Grant and Liz Hurley. Grant tells Hurley he's popping 
out for a Brandy. When Hurley finds him 72 hours later at the L.A. 
County Jail, Grant is performing ``A Midsummer Night's Dream'' with 
his cellmates Willis, Robert Downey Jr., Sean Penn and Christian Slater. 
A bootleg copy of the surveillance video turns up at the Chichester 
offices of Merchant Ivory, who turn it into ... ``I Dreamt What You 
Did Last Midsummer'' In a well-intentioned homage to the 1935 Max 
Reinhardt masterwork (which featured Mickey Rooney as Puck and Jimmy 
Cagney as Bottom), the director Kenneth Branagh brings nothing new 
to this familiar standard. Helena Bonham Carter quits in pre-production, 
cattily calling the film little more than ``I Know What You Did Last 
Summer Stock.'' Preview audience response cards are hardly kinder, 
and Branagh hastily tacks on a new ending set in a Viennese sleep 
disorder clinic. Rex Reed writes, ``Oscar's napping if he doesn't 
come calling on Kenneth!'' ``I Know You Took the Last Dim Sum'' Fisherman 
Ben orders Chinese takeout in Manhattan. When the deliveryman (Jackie 
Chan) arrives with larceny in his heart and duck sauce in his beard, 
all hell breaks loose. John Woo directs. ``Lst Sjommer Zum Zum Vlit 
Kjlmmer'' Death (Joe Piscopo) visits Stockholm, but is thwarted when 
Lufthansa loses his scythe. So Death takes a holiday. To the familiar 
Bergman themes _ godlessness, life's emptiness, the thin line between 
sanity and madness _ the Swedish auteur adds a new one: the utter 
hopelessness of finding a decent mochaccino around Stallmstaregrden 
Norrtull. ``I Know What You Did Last Summer, but Enough About You: 
Let's Talk About What I Did Last Summer'' This $400 million epic from 
the writer-director James Cameron goes wildly over budget when the 
egocentric King of the World summons to the set the perceived rivals 
Larry King, Alan King, Don King, Billie Jean King and King Vitaman, 
the cereal. Insiders describe the increasingly paranoiac Cameron as 
a royal pain. No animals were harmed in the making of the movie, set 
in an Azerbaijani abattoir, though Amnesty International decries the 
tortured soundtrack by Celine Dion. ``I Know What You Did, Miss Sommer'' 
Jonathan Winters summers on Cape Cod. Suzanne Somers, Pat Summerall 
and Elke Sommer winter in Aspen. On the first day of spring, all four 
connect at O'Hare, where bomb-sniffing dogs determine that this movie 
will be one. Undercover FAA officials _ working in tandem with the 
Transportation Secretary Rodney E. Slater and the Academy of Motion 
Picture Arts and Sciences poobah Jack Valenti _ shut the production 
down and order a cessation of any and all ``Summer'' sequels.
