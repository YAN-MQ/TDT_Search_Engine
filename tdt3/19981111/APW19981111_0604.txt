ROME (AP) - Europe needs to invest more in job creation and reward 
the people who tightened their belts so their countries could get 
into the European Monetary Union, Italian premier Massimo D'Alema 
said in an interview published Wednesday. D'Alema, a former Communist 
who became premier three weeks ago, urged the monetary union to relax 
its rules so that investments in job creation from government budget 
deficit calculations. ``This is not being scandalous or heretical,'' 
D'Alema told the International Herald Tribune. ``I am not proposing 
that we print money. All I am saying is that if necessary, Europe 
could decide to interpret the stability pact.'' The eleven countries 
selected to participate in the single currency, the euro, had to meet 
strict economic criteria, and are required to maintain that rigor. 
But D'Alema, like some officials in Germany's new center-left government, 
insists it is time to worry more about the people. D'Alema, who heads 
a center-left government, says he wants to reduce the country's 12 
percent unemployment rate and stimulate the economy to counteract 
a looming recession. ``We have been very, very well-behaved,'' said 
D'Alema. ``We did all the homework... Now the European Union and the 
European people deserve to be rewarded.''
