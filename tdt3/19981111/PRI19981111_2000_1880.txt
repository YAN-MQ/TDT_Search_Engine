The Israeli cabinet has given conditional approval to the peace deal 
signed with the Palestinians last month. But Israel is warning it 
will halt implementation if the Palestinians do not stick to their 
security commitments. Israeli government spokesman, Moshi Fogel. We 
are giving this process a chance, and at the same time. We are clarifying 
that at every step along the way, we are going to make sure that the 
Palestinians are honoring their part of the deal before we go ahead 
with our part of the bargain. Moshi Fogel.
