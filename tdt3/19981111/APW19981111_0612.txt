Thailand will ask the World Trade Organization to urge member countries 
not to use arsenic levels in chicken as an excuse to put up trade 
barriers, an official at the commerce ministry said Wednesday. The 
move is in response to a ban on imports of Thai chicken imposed by 
the Czech Republic because it found arsenic levels in the poultry 
exceeded the benchmark level of 0.1 parts per million, said the official, 
speaking on condition of anonymity. Though member countries have the 
right to set their own standards for health reasons, the issue should 
not be an excuse to put up trade barriers, he said. Thailand permits 
a maximum arsenic content of one part per million in all food products, 
an official from the medical science division at the health ministry 
told The Associated Press. The official, who also asked for anonymity, 
said it was impossible to define what is an acceptable arsenic level 
because the average amount of chicken consumed by people in each country 
varies greatly. Another health expert was quoted in the newspaper 
Bangkok Post as saying setting up benchmarks for arsenic is very complicated 
because it involves a number of factors. ``For Thais, one PPM is not 
considered dangerous because we don't consume a whole chicken a meal, 
like people in the West, and we don't eat it every day,'' Charnphen 
Choopraphawan, an official at the National Health Foundation, was 
quoted as saying.
