A national gambling commission is meeting in Las Vegas this week. 
It is the sixth and final city to be visited by the group, which was 
formed last year. Jim hill explains its goal. People are rolling the 
dice, feeding the slot machines and playing state lotteries like never 
before. With recent voter approval of expanded riverboat gambling 
in Missouri and native American gaming in California, forms of legal 
gambling exist in 47 out of 50 states. Gaming, if properly done, if 
properly regulated, if law enforcement is involved, can be a very, 
very desirable entertainment choice. a national gambling impact study 
commission is reviewing the incredible growth in legal gaming, which 
in Nevada alone generates more than $2 billion a year in taxes. We 
aren't necessarily saying it should work exactly the same in every 
other state, but we want the commission to look at a location where 
it has been beneficial. But the underside of gaming can be ugly. Compulsive 
or problem gambling takes a high toll on people and their families. 
Michelle schlichter's ex-husband, former NFL quarterback art schlichter, 
is now in prison after bouts with compulsive gambling. It really cost 
us everything financially. You know, we had nothing. But more than 
that, it just took such a huge emotional toll on our family. I haven't 
met anyone on the commission or anyone who's testified before the 
commission that doesn't want to do something about that. Network sports 
commentator Bob Costas testified about the potential dangers of sports 
wagering. As sports gambling spreads more and more toward athletic 
contests, there is the real or perceived threat about the integrity 
of those contests. But the benefits of gaming as a source of jobs 
and government tax revenue can be convincing. Catholic priest William 
Kenny is a Las Vegas native. Yes, Las Vegas, even with its gambling 
industry, is a family town. Again, I grew up here, and I turned out 
pretty good. In June, the commission submits recommendations to the 
president, congress and state governors on how to balance the pluses 
and minuses of legalized gambling. Not an easy job, since gambling 
wouldn't be gambling, if everyone came out a winner. Jim hill, CNN, 
Las Vegas, Nevada.
