Israeli troops arrested five Palestinians on Wednesday in connection 
with a West Bank shooting ambush in which two Israeli soldiers were 
wounded. The arrests were made in the village of Raboud, south of 
the West Bank town of Hebron. The army placed the village under curfew. 
The ambush took place at about 11:30 p.m. (2130 gmt) Tuesday near 
the Jewish settlement of Otniel. Soldiers said the attackers waited 
by the roadside and then escaped into nearby Palestinian-run territory, 
out of the army's reach. Palestinian security officials said they 
were cooperating with their Israeli counterparts in tracking down 
the gunmen. A crackdown by the Palestinian Authority on groups who 
carry out such acts is a key demand by the Israeli government in order 
to go through with a Wye land-for-security deal signed on Oct. 23.
