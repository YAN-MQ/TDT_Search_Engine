Tipper Gore arrived in Honduras Tuesday with the first official U.S. 
delegation to visit since hurricane Mitch nearly destroyed the region. 
The wife of vice President Gore says the United States will give an 
additional $10 million in aid to raise its total relief package to 
about $80 million. And she promised further long-term support. The 
storm killed more than 10,000 people and left about 3 million homeless.
