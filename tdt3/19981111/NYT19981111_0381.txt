British soccer louts they are not, but Beijing's boisterous fans have 
provoked a public campaign against their increasingly flagrant use 
of obscenities to berate opposing teams, referees and poorly performing 
members of their hometown professional team. One phrase in particular 
is screamed by Beijing fans with startling abandon, with hundreds 
of people sometimes chanting it in unison. Long used as an insulting 
epithet in the streets, it includes a crude reference to female anatomy. 
For purposes of public discussion and earnest condemnation, the press 
here has called it the ``Beijing curse.'' ``Recently the `Beijing 
curse' has filled the Workers' Stadium, and increasing numbers of 
Beijingers feel ashamed about this,'' said the first of many articles 
in the widely read newspaper Beijing Youth Daily, published by the 
local Communist Youth League. ``Every fan must assume personal responsibility 
for driving the `Beijing curse' out of the stadium.'' Another article 
said the head coach of the Beijing team, the National Guardians, was 
so upset by the curse that he had proposed resigning. Players, fans, 
teachers and parents, who said they feared bringing their children 
to matches, have chimed in to plead with the offending fans to clean 
up their language. But if a match Nov. 4 was any indication, the once-great 
power of official exhortation in China has diminished to nothing. 
The Guardians played a South Korean team in the Asian Champions Cup 
series, a contest for also-rans in the Asian Cup competition. From 
the moment the teams took the field, the shouts of the Beijing curse 
began, along with the blowing of fiendishly well-engineered plastic 
horns that create a deafening din. The Beijing team performed poorly, 
losing 2-0, and most curses were scornfully aimed at its players. 
The traditional cheer for sports teams in China _ equivalent to ``Go, 
team!'' _ translates literally as ``Step on the gas!'' In the stadium, 
curses easily outnumbered that phrase by 10 to 1. Many fans are disdainful 
of the media campaign. ``We just do it to let off steam,'' said Liu 
Bin, 30, who said he was a government worker. ``It's not really directed 
at anybody. People who go to see sports want to hang loose.'' The 
curse has been shouted for years, said his friend, who gave only his 
family name, Wu. ``Now that they've started making such a big deal 
out of it, there are people who will deliberately say it more, and 
it will start getting organized,'' Wu predicted. In desperation, one 
writer in the Beijing Youth Daily proposed that the only answer was 
to come up with some non-obscene phrase that would pack equal punch 
with the fans. ``Everyone says that the Beijing vocabulary is very 
rich,'' he wrote, ``but up to now I still haven't been able to think 
of a fresh word.'' Ning Jing, 20, a hotel clerk and enthusiastic perpetrator 
of the curse, said it would be all but impossible to eradicate. ``It's 
part of our soccer culture,'' he said. ``It's not really swearing. 
It just kind of blurts out.''
