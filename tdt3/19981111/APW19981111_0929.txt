Kurdish rebels ambushed Turkish troops and village guards in the southeastern 
province of Sirnak, Turksih newspapers reported Wednesday, killing 
up to 22 people. A Kurdish group based in Brussels confirmed that 
rebels of the Kurdistan Workers Party (PKK), fighting for autonomy 
in Turkey's southeast, killed 22 soldiers and village guards who are 
helping troops fight Kurdish rebels on Mount Gabar near Sirnak. Another 
30 members of security forces were injured, said a member of the Kurdish 
Committee which includes members of the PKK. It was unclear when the 
operation took place. Military sources refused to comment on the reports. 
According to daily Hurriyet, the ambush occurred in the early hours 
of Tuesday. The rebels killed 13 soldiers and six village guards, 
Hurriyet said. Meanwhile, two homemade bombs exploded in the eastern 
city of Dogubeyazit Wednesday, the Anatolia news agency reported. 
A couple was severely injured when they opened a bag left unattended 
in the street, the report said. The man reportedly lost an arm in 
the explosion and both were rushed to hospital. An alleged rebel was 
killed in the same town as he manipulated a second makeshift device, 
Anatolia said. Close to 37,000 people have died since the Kurdish 
insurgency erupted in 1984. Turkish forces are currently engaged in 
an operation against the rebels in neighboring northern Iraq.
