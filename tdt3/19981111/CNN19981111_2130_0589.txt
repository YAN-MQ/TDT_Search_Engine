Secretary of state Madeleine Albright is calling today's decision 
by the israeli cabinet an important step in the mideast peace process. 
The cabinet approved the land-for-security deal struck last month 
between israeli prime minister Benjamin Netanyahu and Palestinian 
leader Yasser arafat. It calls for Israel to withdraw its troops from 
13% of the West Bank in exchange for security guarantees.
