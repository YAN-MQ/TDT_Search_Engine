You are listening to The World, and you can join us any time, 24 hours 
a day on-line at www.theworld.org. This is PRI. Programming on 91 
FM is supported by WHYY Store of Knowledge, offering people of all 
ages thousands of things to pick up, play with, and explore. With 
locations in Cherry Hill, Willow Grove, the Court of King of Prussia, 
and the Depwood Mall. I am Tony Kahn. Coming up, the last best chance 
to overt war in Kosovo and from a Londonderry father and his children, 
a welcome change in Northern Ireland. This has come maybe too late 
for so many people in our land, but hopefully for Mattie, things are 
going to be a lot better. And music from Senegal. But first, this 
news. For The World, this is Pamela McCall in the BBC Newsroom in 
London.
