UNITED NATIONS (AP) _ U.N. Secretary-General Kofi Annan appealed to 
Iraqi President Saddam Hussein on Wednesday to immediately resume 
cooperation with U.N. weapons inspectors for the good of the Iraqi 
people and the world. Saying he was ``saddened and burdened'' by Iraq's 
decision to halt dealings with the inspectors, the U.N. chief reiterated 
that economic sanctions against Baghdad can only be lifted if Iraq 
fully cooperates with the U.N. Security Council. Iraq barred the U.N. 
Special Commission, known as UNSCOM, which is charged with eliminating 
its weapons of mass destruction, from carrying out spot inspections 
on Aug. 5. After the council offered Baghdad a comprehensive review 
of its compliance with U.N. resolutions _ without linking it to the 
possible lifting of sanctions _ Iraq halted all dealings with UNSCOM 
on Oct. 31. A statement from Annan, who is traveling in north Africa, 
was issued at the United Nations shortly after more than 400 personnel 
from UNSCOM, the International Atomic Energy Agency, and other U.N. 
agencies were pulled out of Baghdad amid preparations for U.S. air 
strikes. Annan, who helped defuse the last crisis with Iraq in February, 
said he wants to see sanctions lifted ``so that Iraq can regain its 
place among the community of nations.'' The Security Council's offer 
of a comprehensive review was the way forward, he said. ``I firmly 
believe that this offers Iraq a genuine opportunity. The comprehensive 
review will map out the remaining steps, provided Iraq cooperates, 
thus allowing them to see light at the end of the tunnel,'' Annan 
said. ``I strongly urge President Saddam Hussein and the Iraqi government 
to rescind its decision and resume immediate cooperation with UNSCOM 
and IAEA inspectors,'' he said. The secretary-general said he was 
surprised at the Iraqi leadership's decision not to cooperate with 
UNSCOM at a time when the Security Council was discussing a comprehensive 
review. ``I therefore appeal once again to President Saddam Hussein 
and the Iraqi leadership to take this opportunity to resume cooperation 
with UNSCOM and the IAEA. This would be good for the Iraqi people, 
for the region and for the world,'' he said.
