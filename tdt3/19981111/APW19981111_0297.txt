The United States and Britain have planned a three-phase strike against 
Iraq that could involve deploying troops in the country, a leading 
Arabic newspaper quoted diplomats as saying. After each phase of military 
action, the allies would present Iraq with a list of demands pending 
further strikes, the London-based daily Al-Hayat in its Wednesday 
edition. The diplomats did not specify the demands, but they would 
certainly include Iraq's reversing its Aug. 5 decision to freeze all 
cooperation with the U.N. inspectors charged with overseeing the elimination 
of Baghdad's weapons of mass destruction. Al-Hayat said the diplomats 
spoke on condition of anonymity from Amman, Jordan, citing as the 
source of the plan briefings to Arab leaders by U.S. Defense Secretary 
William Cohen during his tour of the Middle East last week. U.S. officials 
have not specified what action they might take against Iraq. But Pentagon 
planners have prepared deployment orders that could put tens of thousands 
of U.S. ground troops, 100 more warplanes and additional ships into 
the Gulf should President Clinton order sustained attacks against 
the country. The U.S. force in the Gulf is now about half the size 
it was in February during the most recent standoff over weapons inspections. 
The report, leaked to Al-Hayat, the Arab world's leading newspaper, 
could be a warning to Iraq that an attack would not be merely a retaliatory 
strike but instead a sustained campaign. The London-based newspaper 
did not say how Arab leaders viewed the reported plan, but publicly 
all Arab governments have called for a peaceful solution to the standoff. 
There is widespread feeling in the Arab world that the sanctions imposed 
on Iraq after its 1990 invasion of Kuwait have inflicted too much 
suffering on ordinary Iraqis. The sanctions, which cover the sale 
of oil, have devastated the Iraqi economy. The Security Council has 
said the embargo will not be lifted until the weapons inspectors give 
Iraq a clean bill of health. Al-Hayat outlined the following steps 
in the plan: _In the first phase, U.S. and British jets would attack 
bases of the Iraqi Republican Guards for four days, the newspaper 
said. The guards are the elite of the Iraqi army and regarded as the 
mainstay of President Saddam Hussein's government. The United States 
and Britain would then issue an ultimatum to the Baghdad government, 
Al-Hayat reported. _In the second stage, if Baghdad does not respond 
to demands, the American and British air forces would hit presidential 
palaces and Iraq's infrastructure, including the bridges that were 
destroyed in the 1991 Gulf War but repaired since. After the second 
phase, ``a harsher list of demands'' would be delivered to Iraq. _ 
Finally, if Baghdad did not respond satisfactorily, the U.S. and British 
forces would land troops in Iraq to attack ``sensitive sites.'' America 
and Britain drew up the plan during the earlier crisis, it said. That 
standoff ended in February when U.N. Secretary-General Kofi Annan 
visited Baghdad to broker a compromise.
