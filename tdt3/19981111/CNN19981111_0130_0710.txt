A study published in "the journal of the American medical association" 
tries to separate fact from fiction when it comes to alternative medicine. 
The findings aren't too surprising -- researchers found some treatments 
work and others don't. Example, researchers say an herb can reduce 
the risk of a breeched birth, and yoga might help carpal tunnel syndrome. 
An estimated 88 million Americans try alternative treatments. That 
is up 25% since 1990.
