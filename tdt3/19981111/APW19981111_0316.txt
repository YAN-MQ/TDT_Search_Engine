Families of sailors lost in Hurricane Mitch are suing a Miami cruise 
company for dlrs 1 million apiece, accusing it of sending a crew on 
a suicide mission in an attempt to save the pride of its fleet. Windjammer 
Barefoot Cruises Inc. said it believed it did everything possible 
to save the crew and its 71-year-old Fantome, a four-masted, 280-foot 
(85-meter) vessel once owned by Aristotle Onassis. On Oct. 27, a day 
after rushing to deposit 100 passengers in Belize City, the Fantome 
said in its last message that it was being buffeted by 115-mph (185-kph) 
winds and 40-foot (12-meter) waves. Rescuers gave up their search 
Nov. 5, after finding only some life vests, life rafts and part of 
a staircase. At least six lawsuits asking for dlrs 1 million per family 
have been filed by relatives in Honduras, Antigua, Guyana and Jamaica, 
``and there are probably going to be many, many more,'' Nelson Ayala, 
an investigator for the Miami law firm Huggett and Scornavacca, said 
Tuesday. ``We believe Windjammer attempted to save their 10 or 15 
million-dollar vessel instead of worrying about the crew members. 
Low-income, low-paid Third Worlders were instructed to save the vessel 
no matter what,'' he said. ``Basically, it was a suicide voyage.'' 
James Canty, vice president of corporate development for Windjammer, 
described the allegations as ``false accusations from a self-serving 
personal-injury attorney.'' ``This storm was a tragedy to all the 
family members of Windjammer and thousands of people in Central America,'' 
Canty told The Associated Press. He pointed out that it was standard 
practice for ships to ride out storms, and said the company believed 
it had done everything correctly. As Mitch approached, Fantome was 
ordered from the Honduran port of Omoa, north to Belize City. There, 
it dropped off its 100 passengers and 10 nonessential crew. Another 
31 crew members stayed aboard, planning to head north toward Mexico's 
Yucatan Peninsula to get away from Mitch. But the storm changed course 
and the ship was caught. Several Miami lawyers flew to countries of 
victims last week, about the same time Windjammer sent representatives 
to discuss compensation. British captain Guyan March commanded a crew 
from Guyana, St. Vincent, Jamaica, Honduras, Antigua, Nicaragua, Panama, 
St. Lucia, Trinidad and Romania. Ayala said the company paid relatives 
two months' salary, amounting to dlrs 300 for kitchen helpers and 
dlrs 500 for an engineer. Canty said those figures sounded ``very 
possible,'' and that Windjammer has set up a trust fund to help families 
of the sailors. Some relatives, including Sanita Dindiall, 30, of 
Guyana, have said they believe ethnicity played a role in Windjammer's 
decisions. ``The owners of the vessel couldn't care less about these 
Caribbean people,'' said Dindiall, whose husband Maxell Bhikham was 
a crew member. ``They should have put off everybody, not just the 
white passengers.''
