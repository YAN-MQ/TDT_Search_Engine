Emergency workers battling floods in western Ukraine have found another 
dead body, bringing the death toll to 10, officials said Wednesday. 
The water level in the flooded Zakarpattia region, which has suffered 
from heavy rains for more than a week, has finally stopped rising, 
allowing repair work to proceed, the Emergency Situations Ministry 
said. About 9,500 emergency workers were sent to the region where 
118 cities, towns and villages have been hit by the floods, destroying 
hundreds of buildings and severely damaging roads and railways. The 
Ukrainian government has appealed for assistance to the United Nations, 
European Union and individual countries. The Cabinet so far has allocated 
10 million hryvna (2.9 million) dollars for the relief effort following 
orders from President Leonid Kuchma, who visited the region last week. 
Environment Minister Vasyl Shevchuk said Tuesday no official estimates 
of the losses incurred by the floods could yet be provided. Rains 
in Zakarpattia are expected to continue for another week, but they 
are not expected to inundate more settlements, the Ukrainian Meteorological 
Center said.
