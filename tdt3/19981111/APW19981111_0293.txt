Rebels attacked a village in northern Uganda and abducted 14 people, 
and were defeated in a separate raid on military barracks, a newspaper 
reported Wednesday. Lord's Resistance Army rebels on Sunday kidnapped 
the Ugandans from near Gulu, about 360 kilometers (225 miles) north 
of the capital, Kampala, the independent Monitor newspaper said. Later 
that day, an unspecified number of rebels were captured during their 
raid on Agoro barracks, about 520 kilometers (325 miles) north of 
Kampala, the Monitor reported. Security sources said a ``fierce and 
decisive'' battle at the barracks lasted for two hours. They provided 
no casualty figures. The LRA usually attacks soft targets such as 
schools, markets and villages. Defense Minister Stephen Kavuma, who 
has been designated as army spokesman on rebel activities, could not 
be reached for comment Wednesday. Early this week, the government-owned 
New Vision newspaper quoted the army as saying between 200 and 300 
LRA rebels had entered Uganda from bases in southern Sudan. New Vision 
quoted the army as saying a captured rebel had said the rebels were 
accompanied by women who were to act as porters. The rebels normally 
use abducted schoolgirls as porters and concubines, while boys are 
trained as fighters. Sudan has admitted supporting the LRA in retaliation 
for Uganda's assistance to the Sudan People's Liberation Army, which 
has been fighting the Islamic government in Sudan for 15 years to 
press for increased autonomy and development in the country's south. 
Uganda is also fighting two other rebel groups in western and northwestern 
border areas.
