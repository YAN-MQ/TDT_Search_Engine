Police fired tear gas to disperse demonstrators and shot a rioter 
dead in the eastern border city of Mutare during a one-day national 
strike to protest price increases Wednesday. State radio said police 
fought running battles with about 25,000 strikers in townships around 
Mutare, 270 kilometers (168 miles) east of Harare on the border with 
Mozambique. Police also fired tear gas to disperse strikers in the 
farming center of Marondera, 75 kilometers (45 miles) east of Harare, 
witnesses said. Witnesses said mobs stormed a farmhouse near Marondera, 
torching it and killing the single occupant, a middle-aged woman. 
There was no official confirmation of the incidents. State radio said 
most other provincial centers, including the second city of Bulawayo, 
were brought to a standstill by the national strike. In Harare, most 
factories and businesses shut down and police and army troops, backed 
by helicopters, patrolled township suburbs around the capital, where 
riots erupted last Wednesday because of a 67 percent rise in gasoline 
prices. Workers across the nation appeared mostly to be heeding a 
call by the main labor federation to stay home and not take part in 
protest marches. In Harare's townships, a few small groups of workers 
gathered on street corners, trying to hitch rides into Harare. A state-owned 
bus company scaled back services after some of its crews joined the 
strike. Strikers scuffled with police in the western Harare township 
of Kuwadzana when police were clearing makeshift barricades put up 
by strikers, witnesses said. There were no immediate reports of arrests 
or injuries there. Troops set, 5th graf pvs
