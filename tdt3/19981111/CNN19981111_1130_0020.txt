As Americans honor U.S. veterans today, the White House is weighing 
whether to send more troops to the Persian gulf. President Clinton 
is attending a veterans day ceremony at this hour at arlington national 
ceremony. Mr. Clinton is expected to meet with his national security 
advisers to discuss Iraq's refusal to cooperate with U.N. weapons 
inspectors. The order could come do to spend more than 50 warplanes 
and ground troops into the area. B-52 bombers with cruise missiles 
could be included in the deployment. 23,000 troops already are in 
the gulf, including 23 ships and 173 aircraft. U.S. officials say 
that military intervention is not inevitable, but Saddam hussein must 
comply with U.N. guidelines. I think the purposes of any military 
action would be taken as you've clearly stated, would, in fact, be 
to degrade his capabilities, his ability to threaten his neighbors. 
And this is an area that is a vital strategic interest to the United 
States. It's an area in which we have 23,000 men and women deployed 
to at this time. And have had for a number of years, as you know. 
And, so, his ability to threaten them, either militarily or through 
weapons of mass destruction, is something that we take seriously.
