Charges have been preferred against two U.S. citizens after police 
investigation of a private American school in Moravia revealed students 
were held there against their will and were often inadequately punished, 
police said Wednesday. Spokeswoman Dagmar Bartonikova said the two 
were charged Tuesday with cruelty to persons in their custody and 
with curtailing the students' freedom of movement, charges that can 
entail eight years in prison under Czech law. She refused to identify 
the two by name and to specify what function they held in the school, 
but said one of them is a woman. According to media reports, the school 
is run by U.S. citizen Glenn Roach and her husband Steven. A judge 
now must rule whether the two will remain in police custody, Bartonikova 
said. Last Friday, police searched the school located in Brno, 200 
kilometers (125 miles) southeast of Prague, and interviewed some of 
the students after former employees of the school complained that 
the children were being unduly punished and were forbidden to leave 
the premises. Martin Pilka, the co-owner of Morava Academy agency 
that runs the school, told The Associated Press last week that the 
school is a regular boarding school for American teenagers who were 
neglecting school at home and also had problems to get along with 
their families. He ruled out any harsh methods, saying the children 
were being regularly taken out for walks and excursions. Pilka said 
that the school has 60 students aged 15-18. The first students arrived 
in Brno in March. The course takes 8 to 10 months, he said. But he 
claimed the school is accepted in the United States as part of the 
U.S. educational system. He said that Ralph Atkin from St. George, 
Utah, is the majority owner of Morava Academy. Czech television said 
late Tuesday that a first group of students already left for the United 
States and the rest will leave by the end of the week. According to 
media reports, parents paid dlrs 60 per day for each child. Nobody 
was answering the phone at the school on Wednesday, and the U.S. Embassy 
in Prague was closed due to a national holiday.
