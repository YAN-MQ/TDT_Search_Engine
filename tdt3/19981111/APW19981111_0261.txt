Lebanese President Elias Hrawi has suffered a mild heart attack but 
is in a stable condition, hospital officials said Wednesday. A statement 
issued by Sacre Coeur Hospital in suburban Beirut said the life of 
the 73-year-old statesman was not in danger. ``He is recuperating 
steadily,'' the statement said. Hrawi is due to step down as president 
on Nov. 24. Hrawi fell ill at the presidential palace in Baabda on 
Tuesday night and was taken to the hospital for medical tests. He 
spent the night in intensive care, with his wife Mona at his bedside, 
presidential aides said. The presidential palace said in a statement 
that Hrawi's condition ``does not warrant any worry.'' Media reports 
said the president would return to his residence within 48 hours. 
The heart attack came less than two weeks before he hands over to 
President-elect Emile Lahoud at the end of an extended nine years 
in office. Hrawi appeared on television Tuesday evening awarding a 
decoration to a Lebanese bank executive for his community work. Three 
days ago, Hrawi traveled to Damascus for a farewell meeting with his 
ally, Syrian President Hafez Assad.
