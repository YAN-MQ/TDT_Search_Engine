Actress Mary Millar, a television star and veteran of the London musical 
stage, has died at age 62 after a long battle with cancer. She died 
Tuesday at her home in southeast London, her husband, Rafael, said 
Wednesday. In the 1990s, Mary Millar was known to millions of television 
viewers as Rose in the BBC comedy series ``Keeping up Appearances.'' 
But her musical talents had also led to a long and successful career 
on the London stage, appearing in ``The Phantom of the Opera'' as 
the original Madame Giry, and most recently in Disney's ``Beauty and 
the Beast.'' Her illness had forced her to withdraw in recent months 
from ``Beauty and the Beast,'' in which she played Mrs. Potts, the 
teapot, and sang the show's love theme. On the straight play front, 
she won acclaim as Judi Dench's replacement in 1984 in the hit West 
End drama, ``Pack of Lies.'' Mary Millar was the second actress to 
play Hyacinth Bucket's flashy, man-chasing sister Rose in ``Keeping 
Up Appearances.'' She won the role, which called for thigh-skimming 
skirts, when she was in her 50s. ``I bought a mini-skirt for the audition 
and sat on the Tube (subway) feeling the biggest fool, but I got the 
job,'' she once remarked. Her first television success, in a show 
called ``Those Were the Days,'' came when she was 17. She went on 
to work on stage and in television and also understudied for Julie 
Andrews in the Broadway production of ``Camelot'' in the 1960s. ``She 
was also a committed Christian and her faith was very important to 
her,'' her husband said. ``In recent years she went to Malawi for 
the charity World Vision. She used to sponsor children in Malawi,'' 
he said. The actress is survived by her husband of 36 years, and their 
daughter Lucy, 26. Funeral plans were not announced.
