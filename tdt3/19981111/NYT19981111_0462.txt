c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service LOS ANGELES _ When ``Playing by Heart'' 
opens on Dec. 18, audiences are meant to exit the theaters drying 
their eyes. Here, after all, is a multi-generational, multi-character 
drama depicting numerous love stories in various stages of peril. 
But Hollywood will be keeping its eyes wide open. The film, which 
managed to entice actors like Sean Connery, Gena Rowlands, Dennis 
Quaid, Angelina Jolie, Ryan Phillipe, Madeleine Stowe, Anthony Edwards 
and Gillian Anderson for $50,000 apiece, a fraction of their usual 
fees, may represent something vaguely threatening to studios yet potentially 
exciting for moviegoers: the mini-mainstream movie. Neither a major 
studio picture (big budget, big noise, flimsy plot) nor an independent 
one (offbeat, quirky, fringe audience), it is a hybrid made possible 
by a new kind of entertainment company, one that does not make movies 
but rather allows them to happen. The company defying convention here 
is Intermedia, which first made its mark this year with ``Sliding 
Doors.'' Formed by Nigel Sinclair, a former entertainment lawyer (with 
a stellar list of clients including Mel Gibson, who thanked Sinclair 
first upon winning his Oscar for ``Braveheart'') and Guy East, past 
president of Majestic Films (``Driving Miss Daisy''), the company 
operates more like a packager than a producer. With offices in Los 
Angeles and London and a staff of about 40, Sinclair and East develop 
film projects, but always with a production partner who is actually 
responsible for the filmmaking. While independent filmmakers must 
usually scramble for financing and partnerships at each juncture in 
a film's progress from script to screen, Intermedia lines up the complete 
package up front. The company uses distribution partners in Europe 
as well as numerous capital investors to handle all costs of a movie 
_ development, pre-production, worldwide financing, marketing _ before 
it even starts shooting. Sometimes the company just fills in the particular 
needs of a project. With Woody Allen's ``Deconstructing Harry'' and 
David Mamet's ``Spanish Prisoner,'' for example, it provided the foreign 
distribution. ``Sliding Doors,'' with Gwyneth Paltrow, which cost 
around $10 million and earned nearly $60 million, was considered its 
first start-to-end feature. (Its producing partner was Sydney Pollack's 
Mirage Enterprises.) While it often sounds more Wall Street than Sunset 
Boulevard _ ``Intermedia Film Equities U.S.A.,'' its telephone recording 
announces _ the company wants to be a haven for creative filmmakers 
with more than grosses on their minds. ``Knowing most of us cannot 
_ or don't want to _ compete with the `Armageddons,' we are determined 
to make movies about content,'' Sinclair says. ``We try to stay small 
but bring first-class marketing and distribution. We want our films 
to be the kind you'd never ask yourself, `Why did they make this?' 
'' The recipe seems to be working: actors like Paul Newman, Kevin 
Costner and Linda Fiorentino are making films for Intermedia. The 
company has signed partnership deals with the directors Ridley Scott, 
Tony Scott, Francis Ford Coppola, Kevin Costner and Pollack. And it 
has joined forces with Kenneth Branagh for a projected series of Shakespeare 
films. ``They aren't just about looking at the marketplace,'' says 
the producer Sarah Pillsbury (``Desperately Seeking Susan,'' ``Eight 
Men Out''). ``Their reputation is that they value relationships with 
filmmakers, they have excellent taste and they respond to material 
on an emotional level. They manage to have the clout of a large company 
or studio, but the sensibility of a boutique.'' Still, the proof is 
in the product, and Intermedia's other 1998 releases _ ``Clay Pigeons,'' 
starring Vince Vaughan, and ``Land Girls,'' about women in England 
during World War II _ did not rock the industry. The company has a 
lot at stake with ``Playing by Heart,'' but it is confident that what 
began as a charmed project will remain so. It was a Friday night a 
year and a half ago that Rosalie Swedlin, one of the top literary 
agents in Los Angeles, gave Sinclair a script with the intriguing 
title ``Dancing About Architecture.'' It was written by Willard Carroll, 
whose earlier credits, like ``The Brave Little Toaster'' (1987), hardly 
promised a bold treatment of adult themes. But when Ms. Swedlin calls, 
people listen, and Sinclair read the script late that Saturday night. 
By Sunday, he was reading it aloud to his wife. His company bought 
it the following Tuesday. The project was moving forward with Carroll's 
Hyperion Productions when Sinclair ran into Miramax's co-chairman 
Harvey Weinstein, who asked if there was anything interesting on which 
they might collaborate. Weinstein was given Carroll's script that 
night, read from midnight till 2:30 a.m., and quickly struck a deal 
to co-finance the film and co-distribute it domestically. Miramax, 
which used to be the little guy in town, now had the muscle to expand 
the project _ whose title has changed several times _ from a modest 
$6 million labor of love to one costing three times as much, and to 
hire crew members like the Oscar-winning cinematographer Vilmos Zsigmond. 
Miramax is already touting the film as a ``Good Will Hunting'' for 
1999, a break-out sleeper worthy of Oscar nominations. (Of course, 
the company is known for its award-hungry hyperbole.) If the men at 
the top were dreaming of Oscars, the one who did most of the work, 
Willard Carroll, who also directed, says such thoughts were far from 
his mind while shooting. ``I'd been given 40 days to make this happen, 
and that was quite enough pressure,'' says Carroll, whose encounter 
with a quote from Clara Wieck Schumann _ ``Talking about music is 
like dancing about architecture'' _ inspired the script. ``I wanted 
to write a character-oriented piece that deals with subjects people 
don't usually talk about in movies _ and not even in real life,'' 
Carroll says. What was never a problem was attracting actors to fill 
the many roles. ``People were literally begging me to be in this movie,'' 
says the casting director (and producer) Meg Liberman. Angelina Jolie, 
one of the most sought-after young actresses after her double Emmy 
nominations for ``Gia'' and ``George Wallace'' last year, recalls 
arriving the first day of shooting: ``I looked around, and there were 
some of my lifetime idols and all these great actors, and I thought, 
`How did I crash this party'?'' There were moments when Carroll felt 
the same, admitting he was especially in awe of Connery. But he said 
the veteran actor eased the way. ``He wasn't intimidating,'' Carroll 
says. ``We met right after he signed on, and I did a rewrite overnight 
based on his ideas. Sean likes to be very sure of his dialogue, that 
it fit his speech patterns. I think he also appreciated being part 
of an ensemble, and acting opposite a real equal.'' The equal to whom 
he refers is Gena Rowlands, the first of the stars to read the script. 
``I put it down and called my agent and said, `Yes, I'd be delighted,' 
'' says Ms. Rowlands, who plays a television personality and great 
cook (``Let us not call her Martha Stewart right out loud,'' she says 
with a laugh) whose marriage is suddenly threatened by an old photograph. 
The actress, who has made three other films this year, reveled in 
the idea of a senior-citizen couple capable of such passionate emotions. 
Although she signed on without knowing who would play her husband, 
she admits the choice pleased her. ``Because Sean and I come out of 
the same era, our processes are similar,'' she said. ``We don't rehearse 
that much. We're prepared, and we like to see what happens.'' It's 
expected that Ms. Rowlands and Connery will bring in audiences who 
can relate to relationships tempered by good years and bad. But it 
is Ryan Phillipe (``54,'' ``I Know What You Did Last Summer'') and 
Ms. Jolie, whose characters have relationships numbered in days, with 
whom younger audiences will identify. Their parts were originally 
conceived for actors in their mid-30s, but Carroll decided it was 
more touching, and contemporary, to see 20-year-olds dealing with 
adult issues. For Ms. Jolie, who plays a chatty, in-your-face partygoer, 
the part came as a relief after the tortured, drug-addicted model 
she played in ``Gia.'' ``That was so dark that I longed to grasp a 
lighter side of life,'' she says. ``There is an art to being light. 
It was a stretch, but I learned that I like being happy. And I learned 
that if someone told me they were sick or dying, it wouldn't change 
a thing about my love for them.'' That possibility colors another 
of the film's relationships, between a sympathetic mother portrayed 
by Ellen Burstyn and the critically ill son played by Jay Mohr. Their 
scenes all take place in a hospital room, yet the word AIDS is never 
spoken. ``His having AIDS and being gay is not even the issue,'' Carroll 
says. ``Their story is really about how we often underestimate our 
parents. It turns out the mother is completely cool about her son 
being gay.'' The director says he was constantly working against the 
maudlin _ ``I tried to write the story with a lack of sentimentality'' 
_ and much of the comic relief in the film is provided by Quaid's 
character, Hugh, a man of many moods. Like the others, the actor took 
one read and said yes. He says one reason was the film's depiction 
of women _ not a prostitute or a bimbo among them. ``We have so many 
great actresses not getting enough work,'' says the actor (who is 
married to one who does, Meg Ryan). ``Willard has a really good bead 
on women. Good women's roles make men's roles better because we have 
something to play against.'' Carroll says: ``I worked hard to make 
them complex rather than neurotic. I just felt it was really important 
not to have them come off like whiners _ just as it's about family, 
but not necessarily dysfunctional families.'' Hollywood, which has 
been accused of being pretty dysfunctional itself, may, in this film, 
be looking at one solution: not too big, not too small, allowing one 
person's vision to make it to the finish line, understanding that 
good people are often willing to do interesting work for less. Still, 
predicting a film's outcome is like, well, dancing about architecture. 
``It's really the archetypical film for us,'' says Nigel Sinclair 
of Intermedia. ``It would have probably cost $45 million to $50 million 
if a major studio had made it, but we've managed to keep it relatively 
small, market it well and, by the way, take a late-20th-century look 
at relationships.''
