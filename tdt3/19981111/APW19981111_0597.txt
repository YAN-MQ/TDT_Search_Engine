A woman carrying 240,000 dollars worth of drugs was arrested Wednesday 
at Madrid airport for shoplifting perfume at a duty-free store, news 
reports said. The woman was wearing a belt holding 2.4 kilos (5 pounds) 
of ecstasy tablets, half a kilo (one pound) of hashish and 110 grams 
(4 ounces) of heroin, the state news agency Efe reported. Staff at 
a duty-free shop spotted her stealing perfume and other cosmetics 
and reported her to Civil Guard officers who arrested the woman later 
as she waited to board a flight to Buenos Aires. Airport customs officials 
said the drugs had a street value of 34 million pesetas (dlrs 240,000). 
The woman's age and nationality were not given. A spokesman for the 
Civil Guard at the airport declined to comment.
