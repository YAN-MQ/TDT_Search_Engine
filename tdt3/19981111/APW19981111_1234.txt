Canada is offering emergency aid to Russia's vast Arctic regions, 
which are facing possible food and fuel shortages because of the latest 
economic crisis, visiting Canadian Foreign Minister Lloyd Axworthy 
said Wednesday. The offer came days after the United States pledged 
dlrs 625 million in food aid and loans to help Russia through its 
worst economic crisis since the Soviet collapse. Russia is also negotiating 
with the European Union for aid. ``We have offered to provide humanitarian 
assistance during this very severe crisis,'' Axworthy said after meeting 
Russian Prime Minister Yevgeny Primakov in Moscow. ``There was an 
understanding that, in the North in particular, there are some real 
gaps that need to be filled.'' Russia has been struggling with the 
high costs of distributing food and fuel to its far-flung regions, 
especially in the north. Axworthy wouldn't say how much Canadian aid 
would be provided or when. A Canadian official accompany Axworthy 
said the aid might include warm clothing, medicines, heating equipment 
and grain. Axworthy discussed Russia's economic woes and international 
problems during his meetings with Primakov and Foreign Minister Igor 
Ivanov. Axworthy had originally been scheduled to lay the groundwork 
for a visit by Canadian Prime Minister Jean Chretien, who was to lead 
a delegation of Canadian business executives to Russia in January. 
But Chretien's visit was put off because of Russia's economic crisis. 
Axworthy also met with Russian regional leaders and the government's 
economic officials during his one-day stay in Moscow. Axworthy and 
Ivanov discussed the problems in Iraq and Kosovo, and Canada's upcoming 
two-year term on the U.N. Security Council. ``This circumstance gives 
additional importance to Canada's position in the international arena,'' 
Russian Foreign Ministry spokesman Vladimir Rakhmanin was quoted as 
saying by Interfax. Axworthy left later Wednesday for a summit in 
Malaysia.
