Lynne Strauss has purchased at least $10,000 worth of antiques in 
the last three months. There was an 1870s Royal Doulton pitcher and 
wash basin from Southampton, N.Y., a marble bust from New Jersey and 
an art-glass lamp from Florida. Her pride and joy, a $3,300 carpenter's 
sample of a child's dresser, came from Chester, Conn. ``It's absolutely 
wonderful,'' said Ms. Strauss, who lives in Juneau, Alaska, and bought 
everything based on photographs she found on the Internet. Ms. Strauss 
is among thousands of antiques hunters who prefer the thrill of the 
mouse to the thrill of the chase. She spends four hours a day in front 
of her computer, and does not for one minute miss the pleasure of 
stroking and circling a piece before she buys it. ``The chase has 
changed now,'' she said. ``Feeling and touching is fine, but it's 
hard to find good stuff anymore. There's more to pick and choose from 
on the Net, so I can be more selective.'' In this country, the Internet 
is revolutionizing the tradition-bound antiques business. What began 
three years ago as a trickle of sites hawking Pez dispensers and Mom's 
old Fiestaware has quietly grown into a steady flow of $3,000 Zuni 
water jugs, $9,000 folk art and $25,000 French candelabra _ all in 
``perfect condition,'' if you are to believe everything the sellers 
tell you, though that may not be a good idea. With wares ranging from 
computers and cars to Art Deco consoles and Barbie dolls, Ebay, a 
virtual auction house with headquarters in San Jose, Calif., lays 
claim to being ``the great online souk,'' said James Griffith, a customer 
support superviser there. The company said it received 340,000 bids 
a day before it went public in August. Add on the tens of thousands 
of people across the world who are clicking on other auctions, as 
well as sites where retail shops are grouped, and it's easy to see 
why dealers from flea markets to Madison Avenue say the impact of 
the Web cannot be ignored. Dozens of dealers in the East, where most 
antiques in this country are sold, report that attendance at some 
shows, like those held in Brimfield, Mass., is down, that group shops 
have empty booths and that some dealers and buyers are considering 
letting their fingers do the traveling on the Internet rather than 
hauling their gilded mirrors, cloisonne vases, Battersea boxes and 
Eames chairs from show to show. Irene Stella, founder of Stella Show 
Management Co., which runs the Triple Pier Expo in New York, said 
she did not notice much effect on attendance at last weekend's show. 
But she added: ``It scared me a little when I heard one dealer tell 
another: `I'm doing $3,000 a week online. If I get it up to $5,000 
a week, I won't have to do shows anymore.''' Mark Marsh, general manager 
of the Heritage Antiques Center in Southbury, Conn., said he had seen 
``at least a dozen dealers leave because they can sell as much, if 
not more, on the Net.'' On the Internet, they can reach amateurs and 
collectors from around the world, rather than just from neighboring 
states. Even the venerable bible of the antiques business, The Maine 
Antiques Digest, is mixing church and state: It recently bought 10 
percent of the Ehammer auction site, which gets 10,000 bids a day. 
``If I were a dealer, I would be shaking a little,'' said Dr. Richard 
Winters, a plastic surgeon in New Bern, N.C. ``If I were an auction 
house, I would be shaking a lot.'' Winters bought a rare 19th-century 
lion signed by Noah Weiss, a master carver, for $9,000 on the Internet, 
even though he doesn't even know how to turn a computer on. An auctioneer 
friend in New York told him the work was coming up on Ehammer. Winters 
stayed on the phone while his friend bid for him. Many people express 
shock that anyone is willing to send a check for hundreds of dollars, 
much less thousands, to someone they have never met, for merchandise 
they have never examined. Online auctions seem to combine the ``see 
it, got to have it'' mentality that has made a success of QVC, the 
home-shopping network, with the instincts required to play arcade 
video games. ``Sometimes people are too trusting,'' Griffith of Ebay 
admitted. A bidder can send in a check and never receive the merchandise 
_ or get a shock when the box is opened. ``It's kind of like Christmas,'' 
said Ms. Strauss, the Juneau collector. ``Except you are afraid it 
won't meet your expectations. But most of it does.'' She generally 
buys expensive pieces from online shops with names and addresses that 
can be confirmed. She turns to the auctions for less expensive things. 
Paul Luehr, an assistant director of marketing practices in the Bureau 
of Consumer Protection at the Federal Trade Commission, said: ``Complaints 
about person-to-person online auctions is one of the largest categories 
of Internet complaints we receive.'' Complaints include goods not 
received and the sale of copies as the real thing. Many auction sites 
bar people who have a history of complaints, but it's difficult to 
check out a seller. Antiques and auction sites are available to anyone 
with a computer and Web access. Some sites emulate shops rather than 
auction houses; they sell items for a set price and are frequently 
grouped under an easy-to-find address like Antique Alley (www.antiquealley.com). 
Other sites, like Ebay (www.ebay.com), eHammer (www.ehammer.com), 
Auction Universe (www.auctionuniverse.com) and the Interactive Collector 
(www.icollector.com), solicit bids on items while a clock counts the 
time remaining. The sites usually offer photos and a list of bidders; 
the sellers provide information about the provenance of the pieces, 
but unlike actual auction houses, there is no decorative arts expert 
around to verify the information. (The Auction Universe site was acquired 
Wednesday by Classified Ventures, whose owners include New York Times 
Co., Washington Post Co. and Times Mirror Co.) Watching the bidding 
can be as addictive as the bidding itself. ``I was on sabbatical all 
last year, and that's when I developed my bad online habits,'' said 
Richard Abrams, an English professor at the University of Southern 
Maine, who is currently bidding at the Ehammer site on a 19th-century 
wax bust of Shakespeare based closely, he said, on a limestone bust 
at Trinity Church in Stratford-on-Avon, England. The bidding, which 
ends Thursday morning, was focused in the low three figures. Despite 
the Web's larger pool of buyers and merchandise, no pricing pattern 
has yet emerged. In some instances, serious collectors and people 
far from the East Coast seem willing to pay more than an item's estimated 
worth. At the Triple Pier Expo on Pier 88 in Manhattan last Sunday, 
Robert Rozycki, 38, a dealer from Royal Oak, Mich., whose shop, Vertu, 
specializes in postwar design, said ``people in Oklahoma City or Maine 
may be buying items that are hard to find in their regions, but it 
floors me.'' ``I've raised my prices as a result of prices on Ebay,'' 
Rozycki said. Another dealer, Thomas Perry, who owns One of a Kind 
Antiques in Chester, Conn., said that online auctions are leveling 
the playing field. ``Prices will go up and prices will go down,'' 
he said. ``People will find out that what they think is rare isn't. 
And what they think isn't rare is.'' Like any souk, the rule is buyer 
beware. ``The Web is a superb place to sell bad stuff,'' said Robert 
Nichols, owner of the Robert Nichols Gallery in Santa Fe, N.M., which 
specializes in contemporary Indian pottery. ``Auctions are a way to 
get rid of things you can't sell any other way _ something that has 
damage or has been repaired, or is a fake.'' Because the Internet 
draws many lower-priced offerings _ the average bid on Ehammer is 
around $175 _ it is now competing with the flea markets. Dealers are 
concerned that this reliable source of small, inexpensive items is 
drying up. ``There was very little to buy this fall at the flea market 
here in Portland,'' said Burt Warren, who owns Lisbon School-house 
Antiques in Lisbon, Maine. ``The people have eliminated the middleman, 
and they are selling their items on Ebay.'' So are ``pickers,'' who 
roam the countryside, knocking on doors in search of items they can 
sell to dealers, who in turn sell them at retail. ``The pickers who 
used to sell to me now save the stuff and put it on Ebay and get more 
money,'' said Robert Prozzo, a dealer and auctioneer in Rutland, Vt. 
Like many smart dealers, Emanuel Jenkins is adjusting. The owner of 
E. Jenkins Collectibles on Long Island, he has attended the Atlantic 
City antiques and collectibles show each fall for three years. This 
year his sales of art glass were down 50 percent, which he attributed 
to Internet competition. ``It's the worst show I've ever had,'' he 
said. ``The people coming to shows are not coming to buy, but to find 
out what prices are so they can sell their things on the Internet.'' 
Jenkins, who normally travels to 20 shows nationwide, is planning 
to cut down to ``about nine'' next year _ and devote more time to 
selling online. Now, Web sites are starting to sell big-ticket items. 
A little over a month ago, Bruce Newman, president and owner of the 
upscale Newel Art Galleries in New York City, put his entire inventory 
online _ 20,000 photographs of what he says is the largest collection 
of antiques in the world. Through it he has already sold merchandise 
worth ``in the middle six figures'' to two people from the West who 
came to check it out. ``We sell furniture perfectly satisfactorily 
from catalogs, so we can do it on the Internet,'' said David Redden, 
an executive vice president of Sotheby's. Especially if the customer 
already has a relationship with the company selling the piece and 
knows it can be returned. Sotheby's has just announced that the Barry 
Halper collection of baseball memorabilia _ 100,000 pieces, with an 
estimated worth of more than $10 million _ will be sold in a live 
auction and in online bidding that is expected to last six months, 
starting next spring. Recently, C.G. Sloan's, an auction house in 
Rockville, Md., sold what was described as an ``obscure'' 20th-century 
landscape painting for $145,000 to an Austrian collector. The painting 
had an estimated value of $50,000 to $70,000. Without the Web, no 
one in Austria would ever have seen it. ``Internet calls have now 
surpassed calls from print ads,'' said Reimund Kocinskas, Sloan's 
Internet coordinator. Those who predict the disappearance of shops 
and auctions should remember that radio did not disappear when television 
arrived, nor did movie theaters when VCRs became popular. Antiquing 
luddites can take heart from Griffith of Ebay, a former owner of an 
antiques shop himself, whose partner is about to open another shop 
in Rutland, Vt. At the pier show on Sunday, Rozycki, who has not yet 
bought anything on the Web, watched a browser reach for a hand-decorated 
Rookwood pottery blue vase, circa 1910, examine the signature and 
check for repairs. Another woman touched a Georg Jensen silver cake 
server. Shows and shops will always be strong draws, he said. ``There 
will always be people who savor the tactile experience, seeing the 
objects' true color, to see them up close, and want to hear about 
them and their history,'' Rozycki said. ``The free-flowing way people 
converse, you can't do that on an e-mail message, when you have to 
pause and type.'' Besides, he added, ``we're all always looking for 
an excuse to get out of the house.''
