Word came today that top man at the U.S. secret service will be leaving 
his post to take a job with the Cleveland browns football organization. 
This news could have two deeper menings. First of all, it's widely 
believed his resignation stems from deep frustration over the Starr 
investigation and the precedent, now assured by the Supreme Court 
of being allowed to force agents to testify about what they learned 
on the job. Lewis Merletti is leaving behind 24 years of seek ress 
service. He spent several years as the head of President Clinton's 
personal protection detail. He is becoming vice president and director 
of stadium affairs for the now-spanks Cleveland browns. One of his 
duties will be to monitor the dawg pound, the browns' rowedy fear-drinking 
fans, known to wear dog masks in the end zone and throw dog biscuits 
at football games.
