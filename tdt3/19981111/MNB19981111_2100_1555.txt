If and when the U.S. strikes Iraq, the first weapon of choice will 
almost certainly be the tomahawk cruise missile. The U.S. seems to 
have fared them so much of late, there is a formal name, tomahawk 
I did preliminary sifment here is Robert Hager. Cruse missile punishes 
dramatically without putting lives on the line. At a cost of about 
$1 million each, it uses rocket power to launch, but to reach the 
target at 500 miles per hour, an engine like a jet plane takes over. 
Wings pop out. In front, the war head and TV camera that compares 
the target to computer image to help with accuracy. As for the war 
head -- Two main once. One is a unitry war head, which is a single 
explosive war head, and another is fragmented bomblet war head. First 
used in the gulf war, the U.S. fired them since at Iraq, bons that 
and at Sudan. The Pentagon uses the idea of a football field. If the 
target were the 50-yard line. Have the missiles would hit within 15 
yards, most of the rest on the field and a few in the stands or outside 
the stadium. It doesn't go through the thinned window in the third 
building on the third floor. It doesn't do that it is good enough 
to take the building out. There is a better version under develop. 
The Nicks generation will have a better camera another in the nose, 
able to send pictures back to controllers far away on the ground. 
The missile will be able to circle for up to two hours while target 
specialists on the ground study the pictures and decide precisely 
where and when to hit. In the gulf tonight, those 300 cruse missiles 
are ready to deliver punishment or diplomatic message. Robert Hager,
