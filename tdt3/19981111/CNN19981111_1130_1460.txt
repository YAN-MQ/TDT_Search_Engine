It's a day of honor and remembrance, a day to pay tribute to those 
who fought in world war I. in Paris, French President Jacques Chirac 
took part in a solemn ceremony at tomb of the unknown soldier, beneath 
the arc de triomphe. Today marks the 80th anniversary of the end of 
world war I. the war left more than 8 million soldiers dead. 1.5 million 
were French. Peter Humi has the story of one veteran who survived 
the ordeal. There are less than 1,000 veterans of the first world 
war still alive in France. One of the oldest is Raymond abescat. Abescat 
is 107 years old. On the outskirts of Paris, he gave the memorial 
speech on this armistice day. The youth of France was decimated by 
the war. He says we can never recover from such a terrible loss. Abescat 
was due to finish his military service in September 1914. But when 
war broke out one month earlier in August that year, his unit was 
sent to Belgium. It was our first contact with the Germans. Another 
company attacked first. Out of 250 men, only 7 survived. Then it was 
my company's turn to attack. After, only 85 of us out of 250 were 
left alive. I thought, "well, if it's going to begin like this, how's 
it going to end?" Abescat was luckier than most of his comrades in 
arms. He was wounded at verdun in 1916 and showed us the piece of 
shrapnel that was removed from his leg. He also survived a gas attack 
in the days before troops were issued gas masks. It was chlorine gas. 
Our officer told us to urinate on our handkerchiefs and put them over 
our mouths. Abescat holds no grudge against the Germans and recalls 
an incident when, for once, they weren't trying to kill each other. 
The Germans and ourselves used to get our water from the same stream 
in the forest. We were all unarmed, we let each other wash and drink 
in peace. Fussed over by his daughters at home, abescat now has several 
great, great, great-grandchildren. He doesn't talk about the war to 
the children much, he says, although his decorations, including the 
legion D'honneur, are proudly displayed. After abescat and his fellow 
veterans are gone, the last living link with the great war will be 
severed. Their memories will become part of history. Peter Humi, CNN, 
puteaux, near Paris, France.
