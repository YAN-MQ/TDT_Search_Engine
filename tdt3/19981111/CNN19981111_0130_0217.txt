Baghdad says it will comply with the inspections only if trade sanctions 
are lifted. Jane arraf examines how the restrictions have affected 
the country economically and psychologically. These teenagers are 
part of the cost of sanctions that Iraq says it has to have stopped. 
In a country that prided itself on providing health care and education 
to all its citizens, it's a long way to fall. Iraq says the eight-year-old 
trade embargo is robbing it of its future. As for its past, officials 
say with sanctions in place, they have nothing to show for years of 
accepting weapons inspections. Why do you squeeze and hit and kill 
the Iraqi people which they have being suffered for eight years. For 
what reason? It's that message that's helped Iraq gain sympathy from 
the region and hardened its resolve in the standoff. When we asked 
them if they fear any military strikes from abroad, they reply that 
they have suffered a lot and any military strike would not be at the 
level of their former suffering. As the U.S. sent a second aircraft 
carrier to the gulf, a Friendlier kind of craft came into Iraq's southern 
harbor -- a Ferry on its inaugural voyage from Dubai, Iraq's first 
link to the gulf states since before the war over Kuwait. "We promised 
our brothers we would do this," said 1 of the 42 passengers who made 
the day and a half long journey. Baghdad says it wants a peaceful 
solution to the standoff. But it also says it won't put up with sanctions 
any longer. And for that, it may be willing to face a military attack.
