And finally, remember that interview I did with the authors of Man-eating 
Bugs. Well, let us give you a taste. Crunchy, a little salty, um, 
really not bad. And with an aftertaste that lingers, too. That is 
right. Insects as delectable snacks. Well, Kathy George of San Francisco 
writes, I usually enjoy the show but today I worshipped it. She writes 
how she leaned breathlessly toward the radio to capture every detail 
of that worm. "it was like a long lost friend suddenly called from 
some foreign land to describe what they were having for breakfast." 
Wish you had been with me, Kathy.
