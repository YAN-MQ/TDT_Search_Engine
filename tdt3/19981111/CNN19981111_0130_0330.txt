Louisiana congressman Bob Livingston, in line to become the next house 
speaker, met with Newt Gingrich Tuesday to discuss a transition to 
power. Livingston calls himself a hardworking, pragmatic conservative 
who will make saving social security top priority. At the same time, 
other republicans are jockeying for another leadership post. Majority 
leader Dick Armey is facing challenges from Jennifer Dunn of washington 
and Steve Largent of Oklahoma. Members of Armey's staff say they're 
confident he'll be re-elected, but largent says Armey's claim of 100 
votes is exaggerated.
