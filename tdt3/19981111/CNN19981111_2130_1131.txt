Who was named the national league manager of the year? Find out, next 
in "Headline Sports." Taz! taz! Looks like taz just got his AT&T phone 
Bill. Taz, don't you make a lot of calls on Sunday? Yes, taz call, 
taz call. Then use MCI five cent sundays. It's just five cents a minute 
every Sunday. AT&T charges three times as much. Uh-oh. taz! Just call 
1-800-sundays and become an MCI customer. Yeah! Hey, you morty breskend? 
Who's asking? I had a hard time finding this place. Harvard man: dear 
Mort, you have been accepted to Harvard university and awarded a scholarship. 
Congratulations on all your accomplishments. You must respond, however, 
by May 1978. Better late than never. Cch, cch! Next time... don't 
just send it, send it FedEx. Harvard man: "see you in September!" 
Duane Walker, "CNN Headline Sports."
