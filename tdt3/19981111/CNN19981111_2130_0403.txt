Hurricane Mitch is no longer here, but the problems caused by the 
devastating storm are still mounting in Honduras. Lucia Newman reports. 
Patients fill the hallways at Honduras' largest hospital, a Hospital 
where there's no longer running water, where sanitary conditions are 
so appalling that all but the most urgent surgeries have been canceled. 
The lack of water means that we've had to have water tanks outside. 
And everyone, from doctors to nurses and patient's relatives have 
had to get their own water in plastic bags to clean the patients. 
In the capital, the absence of clean water caused by the rupture of 
pipelines during the hurricane has become the single worst problem, 
a Sanitary nightmare. Desperate residents bath and wash clothes in 
rivers contaminated by corpses and chemicals from a factory upstream 
which was destroyed in by the storm. Skin infections abound as a result. 
Worse yet is the lack of clean drinking water. Our biggest concern 
is that the consumption of our water can lead to epidemics, especially 
of cholera. The water crisis is also responsible for the increase 
in hemorrhagic dengue fever which is endangering the lives of victims 
like this little boy. Doctors say the incubation period for some of 
the worst diseases such as cholera, dengue fever and gastroenteritis 
is several weeks. That's why they say that the worst is yet to come.
