The first person to tell Tom Vilsack that he had been elected governor 
of Iowa _ the first Democrat to hold that office in three decades 
_ was not his campaign manager, not the state party chairman, not 
even his wife, Christie. It was the vice president of the United States, 
Al Gore. Now that the jockeying for the White House has begun in earnest, 
Vilsack finds himself sought after by every would-be presidential 
contender. He is presiding over the state that traditionally holds 
the first presidential caucuses. The last Democrat elected governor 
of Iowa was Harold Hughes, who served until January 1969. Thus, the 
inordinate attention from Gore and a host of others who want to succeed 
President Clinton. Wednesday night, Vilsack was Gore's guest at the 
vice president's residence for a one-on-one dinner. Earlier in the 
day, Vilsack, a state senator who triumphed over Jim Ross Lightfoot 
in an upset, offered a play-by-play account of how Gore and his potential 
rivals paid homage election night. ``Vice President Gore actually 
told me that I was elected,'' Vilsack told reporters gathered at Democratic 
Party headquarters. ``I was not watching the results. I was by myself. 
I was watching `All the President's Men.' It's a great movie. And 
I was watching it and the phone rang. And I picked it up. And they 
said, `One minute for the vice president.' ``The vice president got 
on and he said, `Congratulations.' And I said, `for what?' And he 
said, `You won!' '' Vilsack said the vice president told him that 
CNN was calling the election based on exit polls. ``It was sort of 
shocking because it was only 10 after nine,'' Vilsack said. ``We had 
expected to be there for some time.'' House Minority Leader Dick Gephardt, 
who is mulling a run for president, waited until around midnight for 
his congratulatory call, according to Vilsack. He said former Sen. 
Bill Bradley, D-N.J., called the next morning. He also said he received 
a call from Sen. Paul Wellstone, D-Minn., and has been trading messages 
with Sen. Bob Kerrey, D-Neb., both of whom are also contemplating 
presidential runs. Vilsack wasted no time in picking up the mantle 
from outgoing Gov. Terry Branstad, a Republican, in aggressively defending 
Iowa's early spot in the political calendar. ``Let me suggest to you 
that it is important for the nation,'' he said. ``Iowa is a good barometer 
of political candidates: They have to come into our living rooms. 
They have to go into the cafes. They have to go into coffee shops. 
They have to stand the test of time.'' While Gephardt was not as swift 
as Gore in telephoning Vilsack last Tuesday night, the House Democratic 
leader said Wednesday that he was still seriously weighing whether 
to run for president. He sought to dampen speculation that after the 
Democrats' better-than-expected gain of five House seats that he would 
concentrate on trying to win back the House _ and becoming speaker 
_ in 2000. ``I'm actively looking at the presidential race,'' Gephardt 
told reporters at a lunch in perhaps his most explicit remarks thus 
far about his intentions. ``I obviously have been through this a number 
of times and have made this decision before. So I know the mechanics 
of it and what it all entails.'' He said he would have no trouble 
raising the millions of dollars necessary to mount a competitive race. 
Gephardt insisted that he was not particularly worried about Texas 
Gov. George W. Bush, who is often mentioned as a potent contender 
for the Republican nomination. ``Folks like George Bush give all the 
Happy Talk,'' he said. ``I don't know how he's going to deal with 
the hard right.'' Asked whether he could try to lead House Democrats 
to victory and still run for president, Gephardt said he would do 
one or the other. ``It's important to make the decision early,'' he 
said, explaining that he would decide by January. ``I do think that 
either goal is a very daunting goal,'' he said. ``I've always believed 
in life that you have to set a goal and then throw yourself completely 
into winning that goal.'' But if Gephardt is serious about the White 
House, he has some catching up to do with Gore in trying to make Vilsack 
his new best friend. While the vice president had dinner with the 
incoming governor, Gephardt met him Wednesday as well, but only for 
coffee, in his Capitol Hill office.
