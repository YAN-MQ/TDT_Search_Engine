Three legal experts appointed by Secretary-General Kofi Annan are 
scheduled to go to Cambodia to study documents on Khmer Rouge atrocities 
and recommend how and where a tribunal should judge those crimes. 
The United Nations' chief human right monitor on Cambodia, Thomas 
Hammarberg of Sweden, said at a news conference last week that the 
United Nations estimated that about 1.7 million people died under 
Khmer Rouge rule between April 1975 and early January 1979. Many were 
executed by the radical communist movement for ``crimes'' as trivial 
as wearing eyeglasses; many others died in forced labor or from dislocation, 
disease and starvation. ``There hasn't even been an apology, even 
by those who have defected to the government side,'' said Hammarberg, 
who has served as the secretary- general's special representative 
for human rights in Cambodia since 1996. He added that no contrition 
had been expressed by Ieng Sary, one of the highest-ranking Khmer 
Rouge leaders still alive, who was given amnesty by the Cambodian 
government two years ago and moves freely around the country. The 
legal panel, which is going to Cambodia on Saturday, consists of Sir 
Ninian Stephen, a former governor general of Australia; Steven Ratner, 
an American expert on international law and war crimes from the University 
of Texas and the Foundation on Interethnic Relations at The Hague, 
and Rajsoomer Lallah, a former chief justice of Mauritius. They are 
expected to report to Annan by the end of January. ``There's a lot 
of documentation on what actually happened,'' Hammarberg said. ``Like 
the Nazis, the Khmer Rouge did take notes.'' The panel will consider 
what international charges might be applied to the Khmer Rouge. Some 
scholars question whether genocide is the correct charge, or whether 
the broader charge of crimes against humanity would be more appropriate. 
The panel will also recommend whether any tribunal that may be set 
up should be based in Cambodia or elsewhere. According to Hammarberg, 
all Cambodian political leaders have said they favor the establishment 
of a tribunal, including Acting Prime Minister Hun Sen, who was a 
Khmer Rouge official when the movement came to power. He was later 
installed as head of government when the Vietnamese occupied the country. 
Members of the U.S. Congress, led by Rep. Dana Rohrabacher, R-Calif., 
have passed an unopposed resolution asking that Hun Sen be put on 
trial. Hammarberg said King Sihanouk, who was first a figurehead for 
the Khmer Rouge and then their prisoner, was eager for a tribunal. 
Cambodia is now without an elected government. Hun Sen seized total 
power in 1997 in a coup that ousted his coalition partner, Prince 
Norodom Ranariddh. Since a disputed July election left him short of 
a parliamentary majority, Hun Sen has been unable to persuade the 
prince and other opposition leaders to join in forming a government. 
Hammarberg reported to the General Assembly on Friday on human rights 
in Cambodia over the last tumultuous year. Despite some steps by the 
government to deal with institutional abuses, the picture was bleak. 
``The main problem as I see it is the continuous problem of impunity,'' 
Hammarberg said. ``Serious crime, often with a political connotation, 
including killings, takes place without anyone being arrested or prosecuted.''
