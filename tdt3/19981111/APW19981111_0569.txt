Thailand's deputy prime minister said Wednesday that dealing with 
the Asian economic crisis has provided valuable experience in his 
bid to lead the World Trade Organization. Supachai Panitchpakdi told 
reporters the trade watchdog's leader should be ``more dynamic and 
more involved'' in its activities although members should have the 
final say. The new director-general should combine private and public 
sector experience, knowledge of developed and developing countries 
and of the ``process of boom and bust,'' he added. Supachai, 52, is 
also Thailand's commerce minister and is a former president of the 
Thai Military Bank. More clarity is needed on the proceedings for 
complying with WTO rulings, he said. ``We have to work on that ... 
to see how we can make it work out more satisfactorily.'' The organization 
needs as wide a membership as possible for forthcoming trade negotiations, 
possibly considering transitional arrangements, he added. Some 30 
countries have applications under consideration. Supachai was the 
second candidate for the post to face trade delegates in Geneva this 
week as the process of choosing a successor to Italy's Renato Ruggiero, 
who will step down by the end of April, gets underway. The contest 
will be decided by consensus rather than a vote and the WTO general 
council hopes to confirm the appointment by the end of this year. 
Also running are former Moroccan trade minister Hassan Abouyoub, Michael 
Moore, former prime minister of New Zealand, and former Canadian trade 
minister Roy Maclaren.
