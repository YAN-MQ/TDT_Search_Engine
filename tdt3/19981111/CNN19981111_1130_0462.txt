I'm meteorologist Dave Hennen with your "CNN Headline News Weather." 
The forecast calls for much of the same, more wind and wet weather 
in portions of the northeast through the afternoon. By tomorrow morning, 
though, the winds should begin to subside in the northeast and extending 
back in through the Great Lakes. Look for the wet weather by tomorrow 
to be most likely along the Texas gulf coast and extending into Louisiana 
and in the pacific northwest. Temperature highs for the remainder 
of today, it is going to be cold on the fresh snow through the dakotas 
and Minnesota. Cold, too, through the Rockies with forecast high temperatures 
back only into the 30s. A look at the extended forecast. As we take 
look at the weather maps on Friday. Showers and storms will continue 
in parts of the gulf coast region. We'll find temperatures cold again 
through the upper midwest and warming in the southwest. On Saturday, 
the best chance for rain in the southeast, with showers continuing 
in the pacific northwest. And showers will be spreading into the Great 
Lakes. Could be mixed with snow at times there. And as we head into 
Sunday, again, showers and thunderstorms along the eastern seaboard 
as the wet weather continues in the pacific northwest. For even more 
weather information, log into CNN.com.
