After repeated delays, Israel's cabinet is meeting today to discuss 
and ratify the wye river peace agreement. Israeli prime minister Benjamin 
Netanyahu reportedly will add several stipulations to the agreement 
in an effort to win support of hard-liners opposed to the agreement. 
If the majority of 17 ministers approves the accord, the Israeli parliament 
could vote on it Monday. Under the accord, Israel is to hand over 
13% of the West Bank over 12 weeks in exchange for security guarantees 
from Palestinians. The initial troop withdrawal is to begin Monday.
