Canadian Pvt. George Lawrence Price, killed two minutes before the 
Armistice, was honored Wednesday by allied forces for his role in 
liberating the city of Mons. His 101-year-old countryman, Pvt. Fred 
Evans, frail yet alert, was wheeled into Mons' ornate Grand Place 
on Wednesday to lay a wreath under a bronze plaque marking Canada's 
Nov. 11, 1918 liberation of the city. ``Here was fired the last shot 
of the Great War,'' the plaque reads. Evans also paid respects to 
Pvt. Price, who at 25 was one of the last victims of four years of 
unprecedented bloodshed. Sixteen-year-old Torrey Swan of Calgary, 
Alberta, was especially impressed when Evans joined the ceremonies 
in Mons. ``I don't want the memory to die with their generation,'' 
Swan said as the veterans were seated outside Mons city hall. The 
remains of Pvt. Price are buried in the third row of an unassuming 
plot of the military cemetery here along with those of 528 enemy German 
and allied British, Canadian and Irish soldiers. Illuminated by a 
milky, early morning light coming in through the trees, Price's headstone 
was surrounded by Belgian Prince Laurent, Canada's Minister of Veterans 
Affairs Fred J. Mifflin and Allied military officials, who listened 
as a military bugle played Taps. ``It made it even more tragic that 
Pvt. Price was killed by a sniper at 10:58, two minutes before the 
Armistice,'' Mifflin said. Crowds stood on the banks of a German and 
Canadian war memorial alongside Price's grave, which was covered in 
wreathes, including one from Price's sister. Belgian Geert Leeuwerck 
took his three children to Price's grave and told them about the futility 
of war. ``It's better to think first than to start shooting at one 
another,'' said his 9-year-old son Gregoire. A group of 17 Canadian 
veterans, many past 100, are nearing the end of a weeklong tour of 
the French and Belgian battlefields where they fought and canceled 
the visit to Price's grave because of fatigue. They did attend the 
ceremonies in Mons, where they were the center of attention _ especially 
Evans. Evans was a runner for the 23rd Reserve Battalion, carrying 
messages to and from the front-line. In November 1918 he was part 
of the Pursuit to Mons, as the Germans quickly withdrew with the allies 
in hot pursuit. Then, as now at Price's cemetery, silence dominated 
on November 11. ``It was nice to hear the shelling stop,'' Evans said 
Wednesday. But ``we didn't dare rejoice too far.'' Of the 650,000 
soldiers Canada sent into Europe to fight with the allies, one out 
of ten died.
