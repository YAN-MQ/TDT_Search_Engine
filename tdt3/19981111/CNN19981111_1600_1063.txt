Oil giants mobil and Unocal announced plans to sharply curtail capital 
spending and promised further savings. They say the move is necessary 
because of persistently low oil prices. Exxon, Chevron and Texaco 
all warned earlier this week that weak oil prices would cut into future 
earnings. Mobil, the nation's second largest oil company, said it 
did not expect major layoffs would be part of the savings plan. Oil 
prices are slightly higher today, as tensions rise in the Middle East.
