Consumers seem to be flocking to the Internet to make their purchases. 
And that has investors buying up stocks of the Internet retailers. 
Bill Tucker has a few caveats. It's Internet Redux. And what's fueling 
investor passions this time around is shopping, known online as "E-tailing." 
The online development and marketing firm of channelseven.com this 
week released a report forecasting retail revenues from online shopping 
will increase 784% over the next four years. And visa released a study 
showing that 46% of shoppers intend to do at least some of their shopping 
online this Christmas. Investors are basically placing a pretty big 
bet that there's going to be a Large group of consumers that rather 
stay at home and shop online this christmas season than try to find 
a parking spot at the local mall. The gains were stunning. Goldman 
sachs put a $150 price target on ebay, an online auction site, and 
the stock shot up almost $28 to $131, this stock up almost 50 points 
in the last two trading sessions. Yahoo!, up better than 11 for the 
second day in a row. K-Tel -- yes, that K-Tel -- doubling its price 
in one day. And excite, which announced a plan to simplify shopping 
on the web, up 4, gaining more than 11 so far this week. Be prepared 
to have a terrific loss, too, if they don't go your way, because there 
will be a day of reckoning in these stocks. We had one, a day of reckoning, 
very recently. People lost a lot of money in them. Now, they're going 
up again. But they're for people with very strong stomachs and big 
wallets. Before E-tailers can live up to investor expectations, some 
changes may be in order. Jupiter communications recently surveyed 
125 major web sites and found them seriously lacking in customer service. 
Oh, and one more thing -- while online sales are expected to top $4 
billion this year, that's dwarfed by catalog sales, which last year 
racked up $51 billion in sales. Bill Tucker, "CNN Financial News,"
