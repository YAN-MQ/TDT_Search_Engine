The Army and the Central African state of Burundi is admitting that 
its soldiers killed dozens of civilians. It blames a mistake during 
an operation to hunt down rebels south of the capital, Butchenbura. 
But survivors say the Army killed many more people than it is saying. 
Kathy Jenkins reports. The Burundian Minister of Defense admitted 
that soldiers had killed some 30 civilians during an operation to 
hunt down rebels. The statement, which said that the deaths have been 
due to confusion during the operation, came only after survivors told 
an independent radio station of the killings. But the survivors said 
the army had killed more than 100 people. A figure, which, if confirmed, 
would make this the worst incident since peace talks between the Tootsie-dominated 
government and Hutu rebel groups began last June. Kathy Jenkins, BBC 
News, Nairobi.
