This is The World, a co-production of the BBC World Service, PRI and 
WGBH Boston. It is Wednesday, November 11, I am Tony Kahn. Today the 
United Nations pulls its weapons inspectors out of Baghdad while the 
United States turns up the heat on Saddam Hussein. Also, Canadians 
fear that person shooting abortion providers in their country comes 
from south of the border. It seems such an un Canadian way to stalk 
somebody and shoot them in their own home. It seems sort of what we 
Canadians as a stereotypical American you know. Live free and die, 
you know. And in Northern Ireland, we cross a bridge that divides. 
First, this news. From national public radio news in Washington, I'm 
Kory Flintoff.
