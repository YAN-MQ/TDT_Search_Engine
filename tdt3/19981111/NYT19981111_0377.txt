President Clinton on Wednesday ordered substantial new forces to the 
Persian Gulf, including B-1 and B-52 bombers, and warned President 
Saddam Hussein of Iraq that he was prepared to strike without further 
warning. He also dispatched 4,000 ground troops to defend Kuwait in 
case of an Iraqi attack. Clinton said in a Veterans Day speech that 
the United States would be compelled to act unless Iraq immediately 
permits the resumption of United Nations inspections of its weapons 
facilities. ``A failure to respond could embolden Saddam to act recklessly, 
signaling to him that he can with impunity develop these weapons of 
mass destruction or threaten his neighbors,'' Clinton told several 
hundred military officers and veterans at Arlington National Cemetery. 
The President said that inaction in the face of continuing provocation 
from Saddam would permanently damage the credibility of the United 
Nations, which on Wednesday withdrew virtually all of its inspection 
officers from Iraq in anticipation of a major American attack. The 
President delivered his most extensive remarks on the current impasse 
with Baghdad as part of a concerted Administration effort to portray 
the United States as resolute and prepared to act at any time to punish 
Saddam. William Cohen, the secretary of Defense, announced a major 
buildup of air and ground forces in the region, including the ground 
troops being sent to defend Kuwait. The secretary of state and the 
chairman of the joint chiefs both delivered public warnings that military 
action was imminent if Saddam did not back down. Clinton said that 
if Iraq were permitted to resume work on chemical, biological and 
nuclear weapons, it could quickly restore its capacity to imperil 
its citizens and its neighbors with weapons of mass destruction. ``If 
the inspectors are not permitted to visit suspect sites or monitor 
compliance at known production facilities, they may as well be in 
Baltimore, not Baghdad,'' Clinton said. ``That would open a window 
of opportunity for Iraq to rebuild its arsenal of weapons and delivery 
system in months _ and I say again _ in months, not years.'' As Clinton 
spoke, more than 230 U.N. inspection agents left Baghdad for their 
personal safety; an additional 41 officials from other agencies were 
scheduled to leave on Thursday. The State Department withdrew non-essential 
personnel from Israel and Kuwait to protect them from possible Iraqi 
retaliation for an American military strike. Secretary of State Madeleine 
Albright delayed for a day, until Friday, her scheduled departure 
for an Asian-Pacific economic summit in Malaysia. She also switched 
from her usual airplane to a special Department of Defense flying 
command center known as the Doomsday Plane, capable of secure communications 
with U.S. forces anywhere on the globe. She used the same airplane 
in August when she traveled to Africa at the time the Administration 
was in the final stages of planning missile strikes in retaliation 
for embassy bombings in Kenya and Tanzania. Clinton earlier this week 
pushed back his departure for the economic conference, giving him 
more time to participate in deliberations on the Iraq crisis. White 
House officials said that the President could cancel his trip if he 
decides to use force against Baghdad. Albright said that even as additional 
forces flow into the region, the United States is ready to act at 
any time. In addition to the attack planes and ground forces ordered 
to the gulf Wednesday, the aircraft carrier Enterprise and its battle 
group are en route to the region, and are expected to arrive Nov. 
23. ``We see no need for further warnings,'' Ms. Albright said in 
an interview with reporters and editors of The New York Times. Clinton 
said that although he is willing to mount a punishing military attack 
against Iraq, he still would prefer a peaceful solution to the current 
crisis. He said that intrusive inspection of Iraqi weapons sites is 
more effective than bombing in corralling Saddam's military ambitions. 
``We continue to hope _ indeed, pray _ that Saddam will comply,'' 
Clinton said. ``But we must be prepared to act if he does not.'' The 
chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, Gen. Henry H. Shelton, said 
Wednesday that Saddam has been sufficiently warned of the consequences 
of continuing to defy the United States and the U.N. ``He understands 
that all options remain on the table today,'' Shelton said on NBC's 
``Today'' program, ``that we have tried over the years to get him 
to comply with U.N. resolutions and to honor these commitments; that 
he does, in fact, pose a threat to an area that is a vital national 
interest to the United States, and that he poses a threat not only 
to his neighbors but to the 20,000 men and women of the United States 
that serve in that region.'' American officials said that the aim 
of any military strike would be to destroy Iraq's weapons plants and 
depots, weaken its offensive capability and persuade Saddam to submit 
to international inspections once more. Officials have said that Saddam 
would not be specifically targeted for death because assassination 
of foreign leaders is prohibited by presidential order. But Albright 
said pointedly on Wednesday, as she has in the past, that the United 
States ``would look forward to working with a successor regime'' in 
Baghdad. Despite the threats and the growing American military strike 
force in the region, there is no assurance that military action will 
accomplish the administration's goals. The Persian Gulf war of 1991 
did not curtail Saddam's weapons programs, even though more than 500,000 
American troops and 2,000 aircraft were employed in a campaign that 
inflicted serious damage on Iraq and its army. Two small-scale American 
military strikes, in 1993 and 1996, likewise did not significantly 
degrade Saddam's military capability. In fact, American intelligence 
analysts said that they believed that American attacks had strengthened 
Saddam's political position within Iraq. Shelton said that the attacks 
being contemplated this time would be more effective than past efforts 
because the United States today has better weapons, better technology 
and better intelligence than it had even eight years ago. Shelton 
also defended the conduct of the gulf war, even though it left Saddam 
in power and in a position to resume work on his arsenal. ``I would 
also say that the objectives of the Gulf war were met,'' he said. 
``We did, in fact, reduce the threat that Saddam Hussein posed. We 
stopped that war only after he agreed to the commitments that he now 
is failing to honor.'' Administration officials said that they felt 
a sense of urgency about acting against Iraq for several reasons. 
The United States and its allies do not want to let Saddam go unpunished 
for long for halting weapons inspections on Oct. 31, a senior administration 
official said, speaking on the condition of anonymity. The United 
Nations, including such normally balky allies as France and Russia, 
refuses to defend Saddam in this latest crisis or negotiate some way 
out for him. But many countries are increasingly sensitive to the 
human suffering caused by the harsh sanctions regime imposed on Iraq 
after the Gulf war and are seeking some honorable way to lift the 
limitations on trade with Baghdad. Clinton on Wednesday repeated the 
longstanding administration policy _ that the United States will support 
the end of sanctions when Iraq is certified to be free of weapons 
of mass killing and the missiles to deliver them. ``Now if Saddam 
Hussein is really serious about wanting sanctions lifted, there is 
an easy way to demonstrate that. Let UNSCOM do its job without interference; 
fully comply,'' Clinton said at Arlington, referring to the U.N. special 
commission responsible for the weapons inspections. ``The international 
community is united that Saddam must not have it both ways by keeping 
his weapons of mass destruction capability and still getting rid of 
sanctions.''
