After 27 locked-out players met here Wednesday to discuss labor strategy 
and reaffirm their solidarity, Billy Hunter, the executive director 
for the National Basketball Players Association, stood at a microphone 
to announce the union had no intention of detonating the season. ``It's 
not our desire or intent to blow up the season,'' Hunter said. ``We 
don't want to damage the NBA.'' But with 29 owners firmly entrenched 
in their position, the league's labor dispute plods on toward an unofficial 
mid-December deadline for reaching an agreement before losing the 
season. With no new negotiations scheduled and a sixth week about 
to be stricken from the 82-game schedule, a 50-game season is looking 
more likely. The union's negotiating committee and several team player 
representatives met for more than five hours to discuss the lockout 
and whether to alter their proposal to the owners. Hunter said he 
planned to speak to NBA commissioner David Stern on Wednesday night 
or Thursday morning to set up either a one-on-one meeting or a full 
bargaining session. With major differences on how to implement an 
escrow system and limit the escalation of high-end salaries, both 
parties have about a month to compromise on their current positions. 
And the longer a deal is not reached, the mechanics of putting the 
season back together become more problematic. Hunter also said Stern 
informed him last week that the NBA may soon be submitting a new proposal 
to the players. But deputy commissioner Russ Granik replied, ``We 
have no idea what he's talking about.'' Stern said: ``As you get into 
month in December, you are flirting with the complete loss of the 
season. We refuse to put a deadline on it, because we want to make 
a deal. But there are different timetables involved, including the 
gap between the time you shake hands over a deal and actually reduce 
it to writing.'' But lawyers working around the clock to hash out 
details is the least of the NBA's worries. Both sides have agreed 
that a three-to-four-week period would be needed for training camps 
and at least one exhibition game for each team before the start of 
the season. If an agreement were signed Thursday, the New York Knicks, 
for example, would be reduced to a 60-game schedule. While many observers 
have penciled in NBC's Christmas Day doubleheader featuring the Knicks 
versus the Chicago Bulls and the Phoenix Suns against the Los Angeles 
Lakers as a watershed for beginning the season, the network's entertainment 
division is already working on alternate programming for that day. 
One league official, who requested anonymity, said, ``Those games 
are pretty much gone, unless something happens in the next few days.'' 
What's more, the NBA has released some of its hotel and meeting rooms 
for the All-Star Game in Philadelphia for Feb. 14. Although the event 
is not a huge revenue supplier for the league, the city stands to 
lose as much as $30 million. Stern has been on the telephone weekly 
with Mayor Edward Rendell. ``If we have a season of any kind, we would 
try and save the All-Star Game,'' Stern said. The other option may 
be awarding Philadelphia the All-Star Game in 2002. Golden State won 
the bid to host the 2000 game. The 2001 game has not been announced 
yet, but the MCI Center in Washington has all but been promised the 
event. The doomsday scenario has not been discussed at length by either 
side, and with a month to go, it is possible to salvage much of the 
season. Stern has said he plans to reschedule some of the lost games. 
``If there is a season, you look at open dates and travel schedules 
and see if you can add dates,'' he said. ``But as you lose more games, 
you lose the opportunity to reschedule some of those games because 
your base gets smaller.'' Meanwhile, the only professional basketball 
taking place in December may not take place in an NBA arena. Hunter 
confirmed that an all-star exhibition game scheduled for the first 
week in December for Las Vegas is close to being put together. The 
game, organized by David Falk, Arn Tellem and other agents with prominent 
clients, would benefit financially strapped players and would most 
likely be televised by a national cable outlet. Hunter added that 
Michael Jordan may play. ``Whether or not he will play won't be known 
until the last moment,'' Hunter said of Jordan. ``If he doesn't play, 
he'll coach. But he'll be physically present.'' Despite the lack of 
progress, Hunter expressed some optimism that a deal could be struck. 
``We think what we've put out there is a pretty fair proposal,'' he 
said. ``We're prepared to negotiate from that proposal, but only if 
they're willing to do the same. When they demonstrate a willingness 
on their part to sit down and strike a deal, then we're prepared to 
strike one.'' But he added: ``I think it's sort of crunch time. We've 
already missed about two weeks of the season. Sooner or later, they're 
going to have to decide it's time to make a deal. But I think what 
you do, at this stage of the game, is do whatever you have to do if 
you're not inclined to back off from your position.''
