Hundreds of golf caddies in Bangkok, Thailand, have reached an uneasy 
truce with government officials after a golf course became a virtual 
war zone. Last week, the government bought the course and planned 
to make it a public park. But when officials tried to evict the caddies 
Monday, they pelted riot police with Molotov cocktails and stones. 
Four city workers were slightly injured. After talks yesterday, city 
officials offered to relocate caddies to other jobs.
