A spate of copycat incidents has prompted the government's mental 
health department to caution the media to be more sensitive in coverage 
of suicides. The warning, in a press statement received Wednesday, 
came two days after a woman who had been threatening for several hours 
to jump from a rooftop accidentally fell to her death after a misguided 
rescue attempt. The incident, in Hat Yai, 950 kilometers (590 miles) 
south of Bangkok, was captured by television news cameras and broadcast 
repeatedly. On Tuesday, in what mental health experts fear was a response 
to the explicit broadcasts, four people in and around Bangkok were 
reported to have threatened to jump off buildings. One did jump, and 
died. The mental health department is calling for an urgent meeting 
next week with foreign and local news organizations to discuss news 
coverage, a department spokesman said. A report compiled by the department 
suggested that there is a parallel between the amount of news coverage 
of suicides and the number of attempts. About 4,000 people a year 
commit suicide, the department's deputy director general, Dr. Somchai 
Chakrabhand, was quoted as saying by the newspaper Bangkok Post Wednesday. 
The authorities were criticized for their handling of Monday's incident 
in Hat Yai. Aside from the abrupt attempt to grab the 25-year-old 
woman, Sripraphai Cheoyphiew, no nets had been placed to break her 
fall and no ambulance was standing by, even though she was on a roof 
ledge for several hours. After she fell, she was taken to hospital 
by a pickup truck belonging to a local charity that normally collects 
bodies from car accidents. She died two hours later from internal 
bleeding.
