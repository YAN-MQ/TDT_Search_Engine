Across the United States today, Americans are honoring their servicemen 
and women on this veterans day. In Washington, President Clinton laid 
a wreath at the tomb of the unknowns. He told Americans to remember 
that, in his words -- "our achievements in peace are built upon the 
sacrifices of our veterans in war." In New York mayor Rudy Giuliani 
joined veterans in a March down fifth avenue. The parade ended at 
Madison square, where veterans raised a large American flag.
