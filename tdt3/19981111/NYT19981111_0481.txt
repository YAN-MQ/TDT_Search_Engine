William Luers, a former diplomat who has been president of the Metropolitan 
Museum of Art since 1986, is to be the next chairman and president 
of the United Nations Association of the USA, the association announced 
Wednesday. In a bold move for the organization, which does research 
and organizes chapters of U.N. supporters around the country, Luers 
will combine the two top jobs, chairman and president, when he takes 
office in February. He succeeds John Whitehead as chairman and Alvin 
Adams as president and chief operating officer. Adams, a retired career 
diplomat, will leave the association. Whitehead plans to stay on as 
one of two vice chairmen, to be joined by Richard Voell, chairman 
of the Business Council of the United Nations, a corporate group that 
is likely to be combined with the United Nations Association this 
year. Luers, who is retiring from the Met on Jan. 31, said in an interview 
Wednesday that he was first asked five or six months ago to serve 
as chairman, but that the proposal to combine the top jobs emerged 
only a few weeks ago. ``The more I got involved, the more intriguing 
I thought it was,'' he said, ``both in terms of what could be done 
at this difficult stage in the United States' relationship to the 
United Nations, specifically on the debt issue, and generally. ``This 
is an organization that has enormous potential,'' said Luers, who 
association officials hope will considerably improve the group's fund-raising 
and its public profile. ``Off and on, it has realized some of it, 
but maybe there's more that can be done.'' Luers, a former State Department 
official and ambassador to Czechoslovakia and Venezuela, said he has 
been watching the association from the sidelines for years and is 
fascinated by its roots in the American people and what they think 
about the world. He has also stayed in touch with the United Nations. 
``I'm a very close friend of Kofi Annan and Dick Holbrooke and Tim 
Wirth, some of the key actors,'' he said. Kofi Annan is secretary 
general; Richard Holbrooke is the administration's choice to become 
the next American representative; Timothy Wirth is president of the 
United Nations Foundation, which was established by Ted Turner. Wendy 
Luers, William Luers' wife, is founder and president of the Foundation 
for a Civil Society, which aids democracy-building movements in the 
Czech Republic and Slovakia. She has also formed an organization to 
promote art and preservation at American embassies. ``Foreign affairs 
has always been my primary interest,'' Luers said. But he added that 
he could not resist a management challenge. ``I like running things,'' 
he said.
