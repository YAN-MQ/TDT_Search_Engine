A California judge has ordered a new hearing to determine the custody 
of o.J. Simpson's two youngest children. The decision reverses an 
earlier court ruling that awarded custody to simpson. Greg LaMotte 
reports. It would seem impossible to imagine what Sydney and Justin 
simpson must be going through -- their mother brutally slashed to 
death in front of their home as they slept. Their father, accused 
of killing her. The two were then forced to leave their home and stay 
with their mother's parents as their father stood trial on murder 
charges. When O.J. Simpson was acquitted and went to court seeking 
to regain custody of his children, he talked about them during a church 
service. I just wish my young kids were with me, but probably next 
week, I'll be in here with my young kids. And your prayers -- Nicole 
brown Simpson's parents sought permanent custody of the kids, but 
O.J. Simpson's children were eventually ordered back into his custody. 
The judge in the case ruled to do so would not be detrimental to the 
children's well-being. An attorney for the parents of Nicole brown 
Simpson thought otherwise. I believe the children are at substantial 
risk with Mr. Simpson. Lou and juditha brown appealed the lower-court 
ruling, and now the issue of where Sydney and Justin Simpson will 
live is again in question. A California appeals court has ordered 
a new custody trial. You simply look at the fact that there's grandparents 
who two years ago had to send children back to a man that they believe 
and know in their hearts killed their daughter, you look at that and 
you'll know exactly why they want those children back. Lawyers for 
the browns argued that had murder evidence been allowed in the custody 
case, the outcome might have been different. Simpson was later found 
responsible for the deaths of his ex-wife and Ron goldman during a 
civil trial. For now, the children will remain with Simpson at least 
until after the new trial is concluded. However, it is not known when 
the new custody case will get under way. Greg LaMotte, CNN, Los Angeles.
