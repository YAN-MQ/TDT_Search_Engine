The wine industry in California has turned into sour grapes this year. 
Winemakers say they likely will lose tens of millions of dollars in 
revenue after this year's harvest. The crop yield is down 30% to 50% 
because of mildew, insects and rain. By comparison, north coast growers 
in California took in a record $619 million last year.
