The national weather service says this winter will be cooler than 
normal over the northern U.S. and wet. Meaning there will be snow, 
ice and rain. It will be particularly wet in the northwest and in 
the grate lakes region. Warm and dry weather is expected in the mid-atlantic 
states and in Texas and California.
