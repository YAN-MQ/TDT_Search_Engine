Cholesterol drugs can save the lives of even those heart patients 
whose only cholesterol problem is too little HDL, the good stuff that 
keeps arteries clean, a study found. Doctors often recommend cholesterol-lowering 
drugs for people whose so-called bad cholesterol, or LDL, is off the 
charts. However, about one-quarter of all people with heart disease 
have ordinary amounts of LDL, while their HDL, or good cholesterol, 
is low. In a Veterans Administration study released Wednesday, doctors 
gave these people a relatively old generic medicine that slightly 
increases HDL. They found it lowered the risk of a heart attack or 
death from heart disease by 22 percent. The study used a drug called 
Lopid, known generically as gemfibrozil. This medicine has been overtaken 
in recent years by a newer class of medicines, called statins, that 
are available only in more expensive brand-name versions. ``It works. 
It's cheap. It's well-tolerated,'' said Dr. Hanna Rubins, who directed 
the study at the Veterans Administration Medical Center in Minneapolis. 
The study was presented at a meeting in Dallas of the American Heart 
Association, along with another report showing that unusually aggressive 
treatment with one of the statin drugs can forestall the need for 
angioplasty. The statins typically cost dlrs 900 to dlrs 1,800 a year. 
In her study, Rubins said gemfibrozil cost the Veterans Administration 
dlrs 48 per patient annually, although the typical drugstore cost 
is likely to be several times higher. In the study, 1,264 men were 
randomly assigned to take gemfibrozil, while 1,267 others got placebos. 
At the start, average LDL levels were an unremarkable 111, while HDL 
was 31.5 _ well below the healthy level of 45 or higher. The treatment 
raised HDL just two points, while LDL was unchanged. Nevertheless, 
after five years, 21 percent of patients taking gemfibrozil had died 
or suffered heart attacks, compared with 17 percent in the comparison 
study. Side effects of gemfibrozil can include intestinal upsets and 
gallstones. Statins are easier to take, but they have not been specifically 
studied in heart patients with normal LDL and low HDL. Some heart 
specialists said they doubt that gemfibrozil will gain on the statins, 
even though it is cheaper. ``We've got to get the LDL down, the lower 
the better,'' said Dr. Gerald Fletcher of Mayo Clinic in Jacksonville, 
Florida. ``We shouldn't take the emphasis off of LDL. All of my patients 
are on statins.'' Dr. Bertram Pitt of the University of Michigan described 
the results of a study with one of the statin drugs, known as atorvastatin, 
or Lipitor, on 341 people with mild heart disease who were scheduled 
to undergo balloon angioplasty to reopen their clogged heart arteries. 
Half got their angioplasties and other usual treatment, while the 
rest were put on higher-than-usual doses of Lipitor. After 18 months 
of follow-up, there was no statistically meaningful difference in 
heart problems between the two groups. Lipitor cut their LDL almost 
in half _ from an average 140 to 77. And 87 percent of these people 
were able to avoid angioplasty or bypass surgery during the follow-up 
period. ``We can delay or prevent the need for angioplasty'' with 
aggressive statin treatment, Pitt said.
