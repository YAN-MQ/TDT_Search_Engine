What can be achieved this time when other strikes have punished Saddam 
but never shut him down. Jim Miklaszewski is at the Pentagon tonight. 
Tonight, U.S. military forces in the Persian gulf have been put on 
alert. It's the strongest warning yet that airstrikes could soon be 
on their way. Today at FT. bliss, Texas, patriot missile crews got 
their orders to ship out for the gulf. The additional firepower now 
headed toward Iraq, B-52s, B-1 bombers, stealth fighters, is an ominous 
sign the U.S. is preparing for a massive, sustained bombing campaign. 
They begin arriving in 48 hours, but U.S. forces don't have to wait 
that long to strike. Cruise missiles launched from Navy ships already 
in the gulf would lead the attack, then pinpoint bombing runs. Military 
officials also report this time Baghdad would be a primary target. 
Baghdad will be struck much more violently, much more comprehensively 
than iraq believes. But during the gulf war, 60,000 combat airstrikes 
failed to make a dent in Saddam Hussein's weapons program. Now armed 
with information from seven years of U.N. weapon inspections, the 
U.S. military has a better idea of what targets to hit and where. 
But military officials admit there's still no chance airstrikes alone 
can wipe out Saddam's weapons of mass destruction. But there's more 
at stake here than punishing Saddam. U.S. credibility is also on the 
line. And that could prove a very powerful incentive for President 
Clinton to launch airstrikes and soon. tom? Jim, what's the thinking? 
Do you think we'll have air attacks by the weekend? That's very likely, 
Tom. U.S. officials tell us that there's no need to wait for all those 
additional aircraft to get there sometime this weekend. And now that 
the forces in the gulf have been put on alert, those airstrikes could 
come at any time. Okay. Thank you very much. Jim Miklaszewski at the 
Pentagon.
