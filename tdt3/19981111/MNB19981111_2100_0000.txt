There is no need for further warnings to Iraq. We've been at this 
a long time. They understand our seriousness. This is a grave situation. 
Is the United States by its policy against Iraq. It has all been said 
now. The president is making his final calls to the hill as carkte 
and ships gear up for possible action. What the Pentagon says could 
be hours away in the Persian gulf. Stayedside, more men, women and 
material are moving out tonight, shipping out overseas for what could 
be another attempt to punish Iraq. A bizarre component in all this 
attack planning no one at the Pentagon has any control over. A meteor 
shower is on the way, perhaps with devastating effects on the satellites 
aimed at Iraq.
