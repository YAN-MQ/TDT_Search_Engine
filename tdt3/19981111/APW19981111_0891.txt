VILNIUS, Lithuania (AP) - A poverty-stricken Lithuanian couple has 
been arrested on charges of murdering two of their newborn children 
by burying them alive in a forest, a prosecutor said Wednesday. Police 
discovered the bodies of two newborns buried in a forest near the 
town of Prienai, about 100 kilometers (60 miles) west of the capital 
city, Vilnius, Vincas Bisikirskas, a local prosecutor, told The Associated 
Press. He identified the couple as Ruta Alaburdiene, 37, and her 36-year-old 
husband Rimas Alaburda, and said they had admitted the killings. The 
murders occurred in 1994 and 1995. In each case, the couple went to 
the woods near their home, where the mother gave birth and the father 
buried each of the newborns in a ditch, where they died, said the 
Lithuanian Lietuvos Rytas newspaper. According to the newspaper, the 
couple, who already had two children, claimed they were too poor to 
care for the infants. It was not clear why they did not offer the 
infants for adoption, or resort to abortions, which are legal and 
affordable in Lithuania. Bisikirskas, the prosecutor, said the father 
will be charged with murder, and could face the death penalty if convicted. 
He said the mother will be charged as an accomplice, and could face 
up to five years in prison. Police did not rule out the possibility 
that the couple had killed more infants in the same way, the newspaper 
report said. The couple's two living children had been placed with 
relatives.
