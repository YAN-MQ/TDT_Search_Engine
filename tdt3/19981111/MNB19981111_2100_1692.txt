When we come back, we'll go to where they are shipping out tonight 
heading toward the Persian gulf to various posts in the United States. 
There are certain things... your body is going through-- that the 
chemo is doing to you. I was tired. Very, very tired. One time, my 
grandchildren were all over, and they all went out and got ice cream. 
And they're all lined up on the Porch-- all with ice cream. They start 
from the age of three... all the way up to 18 years of age. What a 
photograph that had to be. I did not have the energy... to go upstairs 
to grab the camera. I missed the photograph-- to me, a once in a lifetime 
opportunity. Go out. Live your life. That's what I'm doing now.
