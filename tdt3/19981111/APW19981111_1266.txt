Venerated former FC Barcelona coach Johan Cruyff on Wednesday added 
his weight to the pressure bearing down on fellow Dutchman and current 
coach of the struggling Spanish soccer giant Louis Van Gaal. Cruyff 
told reporters in this northeastern city ``I do not enjoy the football 
played by Barcelona at the moment, which means I feel the same as 
the majority of the fans,'' the state-owned news agency EFE reported. 
Van Gaal's disciplined style is viewed as a colorless sequel to the 
flair of the Cruyff years, with stars such as Romario and Michael 
Laudrup, or the spectacular season with Ronaldo under Cruyff's successor, 
Bobby Robson. But matters of style are easier to forgive than bad 
results, and Barcelona is currently reeling from three consecutive 
defeats. The last came Tuesday with a 2-0 loss in a friendly against 
Swedish team Helsingborgs with Barcelona still suffering from losing 
2-1 to Oviedo at its weekend Spanish league game. That result, leaving 
Barcelona at No. 4 in the domestic table, came hot on the heals of 
a 2-1 drubbing by Bayern Munich that raised the specter of elimination 
from the prized European Champions League. According to Cruyff, such 
failures were in part due to reliance on a strategy of counterattack, 
a failure to get the best out of quality players by placing them in 
inappropriate positions on the field, and lack of knowledge about 
the nature of the club. This last, the former Dutch star said, was 
demonstrated by Van Gaal's dependence on foreign players, particularly 
the inclusion of six Dutchmen in his side. Although Barcelona won 
last season's league and King's Cup, traditional rival Real Madrid 
stole the limelight by claiming a record seventh European Champions 
Cup. Now Barcelona fans face the possibility of Madrid clinching an 
eighth Champions Cup in Barcelona's very own Camp Nou, after the stadium 
was chosen as the site for the next final. Although Van Gaal had admitted 
the recent results are disappointing, he has stressed he has the backing 
of club chairman Jose Luis Nunez, something that Cruyff finds far 
from convincing. ``When the chairman comes out to support you, you 
should start getting nervous,'' he said. This weekend, Van Gaal and 
Barcelona face struggling Tenerife in the Spanish league before going 
on to host Manchester United in a decisive Champions League bout. 
These games could also be decisive for Van Gaal's future at Barcelona. 
According to Cruyff his job in the end ``will depend on results and 
the fans,'' although some appear to have ruled out redemption. Barcelona-based 
daily El Mundo Deportivo covered its front page on Wednesday with 
a picture of a bank check made out to Van Gaal for 800 million pesetas 
(dlrs 5.7 million). ``This is how much its would cost to sack Van 
Gaal,'' read the headline.
