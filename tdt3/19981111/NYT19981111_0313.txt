Brisk breezes will persist from the Great Lakes to the Northeast, 
though winds will not be as strong as Wednesday. A second surge of 
chilly autumnal air will advance across the eastern Lakes Thursday 
afternoon. Only spotty showers will precede this cold front, given 
the lack of moisture in the air. Friday, in the wake of the front, 
temperatures from the Middle Atlantic states to New England will be 
5 to 10 degrees lower than Thursday. High pressure will move toward 
the Middle Atlantic coast by Thursday night. Sinking air currents 
associated with the high will prompt abundant sunshine from the interior 
Southeast to southern New England. Some high clouds will arrive Thursday 
afternoon from Virginia northward as a cold front approaches from 
the northwest. A moistening jet stream disturbance will move through 
the Southwest Thursday. Ahead of this pocket of cold air near 18,000 
feet, surface winds will turn onshore across Texas and Louisiana. 
Patches of rain and drizzle will then develop near a stalled front 
from eastern New Mexico to the Gulf Coast. Heavier rain with embedded 
thunderstorms will expand eastward Thursday night across eastern Texas 
and the lower Mississippi Valley. Given the disturbance's slow movement, 
areas of heavy rain will linger into Friday. A surge of mild air from 
the Pacific Ocean will spread across the Northwest. A moist, onshore 
flow will deliver rain to northwest Washington, with scattered showers 
elsewhere along the Washington and Oregon coasts. Periods of snow 
will fall in the Cascades with lighter snow expected farther east 
in the Bitterroots. Focus: Record Low Pressure The storm that raked 
across Minnesota on Tuesday was the most intense disturbance on record 
to move through the region. The atmospheric pressure fell to 28.43 
inches of mercury at Albert Lea airport in southern Minnesota, marking 
the lowest pressure on record in the state. Several other sites in 
Minnesota also measured record low barometric pressures. In addition, 
the storm brought 70 mile an hour wind gusts and heavy snow to western 
sections of Minnesota. In comparison, the lowest pressure during the 
Blizzard of 1993 on the East Coast was nearly identical at 28.42. 
inches.
