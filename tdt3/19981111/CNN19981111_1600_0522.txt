This look at your "CNN Headline News Weather" begins with our forecast 
weather map. And you can see the bad storm that rolled through the 
midwest yesterday off the east coast by Thursday morning. Meanwhile, 
another cold front drops in from Canada. Could be a little bit of 
snowfall associated with that in the Great Lakes area. It will bring 
in some colder weather. We'll turn our attention to a weak area of 
low pressure moving through the southwest and rainfall in Texas. As 
we put our map in motion, you can see the area of rainfall in Texas 
expanding and may spread across the southeast as we head through the 
weekend. Your forecast for high temperatures indicates we're looking 
at that cold weather in the upper midwest, but it warms in parts of 
the south with the highs in the 60s and 70s. On now to your extended 
forecast -- on Friday, showers in Texas spreading through the southeast. 
On Saturday, we're looking at moderate temperatures for much of the 
nation. Rainfall scattered about in the southeast up toward the Great 
Lakes area. And on Sunday, we're looking at rain showers in many places 
in the east. For more weather information, log on to CNN.com.
