U.N. weapons inspectors and most other U.N. personnel have left Iraq. 
However, joint chiefs of staff chairman general Hugh Shelton says 
that does not necessarily mean a decision on a military strike has 
been made. Jane arraf has more on the evacuation from Baghdad. For 
the first time in the last eight years, the U.N. pulled virtually 
all its staff out of Baghdad. The evacuation of all the U.N. weapons 
inspectors and most humanitarian workers left only local staff and 
top officials facing the prospect of a U.S. attack. Well, the staff 
was relocated as I said, temporarily relocated in consultation with 
New York in the background of possible military action against Iraq. 
U.N. sources said UNSCOM chief Richard Butler gave the word early 
wednesday morning that an attack could be coming. His people left 
within hours. Officials say other U.N. programs will continue. But 
without international staff, one of the cornerstones of the U.N.'s 
role, monitoring food and medicine distribution, will be nearly impossible. 
There will be a slowdown. There will be quite a slowdown, but we are 
trying to make the best out of a Very difficult circumstance. The 
U.N. special envoy for Iraq briefed diplomats on Baghdad's position, 
that it won't lift its ban on weapons inspections without the prospect 
of lifting sanctions. Meanwhile, President Saddam Hussein was briefed 
by military leaders and cabinet ministers on preparations for an American 
attack. But many Iraqis ignored the latest news. They've seen it all 
before. While U.N. staff left to safety, an unseasonal storm drenched 
Baghdad. But as Iraqis say, somebody who's already soaked doesn't 
fear the rain. Iraqis are used to the unexpected. But with the U.S. 
ready for a strike and Iraq refusing to back down, there seems little 
hope for a surprise diplomatic solution. Jane arraf, CNN, Baghdad.
