The Consultative Group of the Paris Club of donor nations will meet 
in Uganda next month to discuss the East African nations' financial 
needs, a World Bank official said Wednesday. The one-week meeting 
beginning Dec. 7 will mark the first time the club, which is comprised 
of developed nations, will meet in a Third World country, said Agnes 
Birinobwa, a spokeswoman for the World Bank in Uganda. The Consultative 
Group chose Kampala as a venue to discuss the country's financial 
needs for development in order to involve as many interested parties 
as possible, she said. ``The participants will include Ugandan officials, 
the World Bank, donor agencies, representatives of the civil society 
and all stockholders,'' Birinobwa said. Normally, the Consultative 
Group involves representatives of the donor and borrowing nations, 
and multilateral lenders, including the World Bank and the International 
Monetary Fund.
