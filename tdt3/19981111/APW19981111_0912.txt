Formula One boss Bernie Ecclestone has joined forces and resources 
with Boris Becker and a German media mogul in a renewed attempt to 
gain control of the men's tennis tour, a German magazine reported 
Wednesday. Their plans have been rejected by the ATP Tour and major 
tournament directors, according to the tour's chief executive officer. 
The idea would be to create a Formula One-like tennis circuit, with 
fewer events and a No. 1 at the end of the season, the Sport-Bild 
weekly said. In addition to Ecclestone and Becker, the third partner 
is the London-based Prisma marketing agency, a subsidiary of the German 
media mogul Leo Kirch, a pioneer in Germany of pay TV and digital 
subscription TV. The ATP Tour, which runs the men's circuit, said 
it had talked to Ecclestone, Becker and Prisma but decided not to 
pursue their plans ``for a variety of reasons.'' The alliance is ready 
to invest more than 300 million marks (dlrs 180 million) in the project 
and has approached the directors of the top-tier ``Super 9'' tournaments, 
Sport-Bild said. Prisma officials have rejected reports that their 
deal was based on pay-per-view telecasts, according to Sport-Bild. 
But ATP sources, speaking on condition of anonymity, said Becker and 
Prisma had failed to come up with a guarantee for minimum viewing 
time on free TV. The directors of the four Grand Slam events rejected 
the deal when they were approached by Becker and Prisma, according 
to news reports this summer during Wimbledon. Becker, a three-time 
Wimbledon champion, is winding down his career and is increasingly 
turning to his business interests. During Wimbledon, the ATP Tour 
announced four-year marketing agreements with ISL, a Swiss company 
that handles World Cup marketing, and Octagon, a London business involved 
in sports marketing. The deals will increase revenue for men's tennis 
by about 30 percent, the ATP said. The agreements, reportedly worth 
dlrs 25 million a year, are less lucrative than Prisma's proposal. 
Sport-Bild said the directors of the Super 9 events have told ATP 
chief executive officer Mark Miles that they will switch sides unless 
he is able to renegotiate a better deal by the end of November. Miles 
denied that. ``The ATP Tour flatly rejects suggestions ... that there 
is any deadline for its negotiations with tournament directors, or 
that there is no solidarity between the tournament directors and the 
ATP Tour,'' Miles said in a statement faxed to The Associated Press. 
Since Wimbledon, Becker and Prisma ``have twice tried to pursue their 
plans, failing firstly at Wimbledon with the ITF and the Grand Slam 
committee and more recently at a meeting with tournament directors 
and the ATP Tour in London, where the Prisma proposal was unanimously 
rejected,'' Miles said. He said the Tour was working closely with 
ISL/Octagon and the Super 9 directors to ``refine and finalize'' plans 
for 2000 and is ``unconcerned about proposals from any other parties 
about plans for any new `tour.''' The ATP Tour has announced more 
modest changes in its format starting in the year 2000, with a streamlined 
calendar and a simplified ranking system. Sport-Bild's report came 
two weeks after another German magazine, Der Spiegel, reported that 
Becker and Prisma have failed in their plan. But their partnership 
has landed a three-year deal television deal with Wimbledon for 30 
million marks (dlrs 18 million), Spiegel said.
