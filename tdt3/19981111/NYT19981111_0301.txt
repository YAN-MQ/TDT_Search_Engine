For the moment, anyway, John Nagamichi Cho's new book has a category 
unto itself at the Library of Congress. His Internet-derived collection 
of haiku- like verse inspired by Spam, the popular processed-pork 
product, is the sole listing under the subject heading ``Canned meat 
_ poetry.'' With the deaths last year of the Beat poets Allen Ginsberg 
and William S. Burroughs, Cho crowed, ``I'm the first in a generation 
of `meat poets.' '' For ``Spam-ku: Tranquil Reflections on Luncheon 
Loaf'' (88 pp., HarperCollins, $7.95), Cho sliced 162 prime examples 
of porcine poetry out of the Spam Haiku Archive (pemtropics.mit.edu/jcho/spam/), 
a Web site he launched as a lark in June 1995. To date, about 1,500 
online poets have submitted more than 11,000 entries to the site. 
All refer in some manner to the rosy-toned Hormel Foods Corp. product, 
and most follow the three-line, 5-7-5 pattern of syllables that schoolchildren 
learn is the classic haiku form. The Spam-ku range from earnest, often 
ham-fisted efforts at evoking a mood to such swinishly punny entries 
as Cho's own Kafkaesque ``Gregor Spamsa woke./ In horror he sees that 
he's/ Now a pink pork cube.'' Cho, 34, a research scientist at MIT, 
attributes part of Spam-ku's popularity to the simple fact that it 
is a short, silly-sounding word. ``It's hard to compose haiku about 
Vienna sausage or Canadian bacon. They take up too many syllables,'' 
he explained. He noted that contributors like to play with the tension 
between the nostalgia invoked by Spam's rich history _ introduced 
in 1937, it was a staple of many wartime diets _ and its anachronistic 
status today as prefab pork in a fresh-meat era. Francis Heaney, 28, 
has authored about 230 Spam-ku for the archive. ``They're not all 
gems,'' he conceded. His favorite (``Moon rises,/ White as two slices 
of bread,/ Sunset pink as Spam within'') did not make it into Cho's 
paperback. Although he has since abandoned the form, Heaney, a puzzle 
writer and editor in Manhattan, said, ``I do my best writing under 
constraints, so the constraint of a haiku, plus the fact that it has 
to be about Spam, is very limiting. To do things within that is fun.'' 
Cho's slim volume represents a burgeoning breed of books that were 
sired in cyberspace. Jeremie Ruby-Strauss, who edited ``Spam-ku'' 
for HarperCollins and who also has published a compendium of martini 
recipes that were siphoned from a Web site, approached Cho after stumbling 
upon his archive. Realizing he had already seen Spam-ku swapped with 
gusto elsewhere on the Internet, Ruby-Strauss, who now uses an unopened 
Spam can as a paperweight, thought, ``Here's a product that's been 
marketed but there's no product, so let's make a product.'' At his 
publisher's insistence, Cho sent his selections to Hormel for approval. 
He omitted those he feared might raise objections, so the book's illustrations 
received the toughest inspection. One that showed a mouse sniffing 
at a tin of Spam was rejected by the Austin, Minn., firm. ``They said, 
`Please, no rodents associated with Spam,' '' Cho recalled. ``We just 
decided to can that one.'' Hormel officials declined to comment, but 
the company does maintain a rather tongue-in-cheek Web site for its 
product (www.spam.com/). In addition to offering a Spam mouse pad 
for sale, the site contains a dissertation that strives to distance 
the company from ``spam,'' Internet slang for unsolicited e-mail (the 
term was derived from a Monty Python comedy routine in which the word 
is repeated ad nauseum). A few weeks ago, at the bidding of a friend's 
daughter who enjoyed the book and wanted to sample its salty, spicy 
subject, Cho consumed Spam for the first time in nearly 20 years. 
Despite his seven-syllable description of the sensation _ an ``elastic, 
rubbery feel'' _ he said the experience had not prompted him to craft 
a haiku about the moment. After penning 200 entries for the online 
archive, Cho lost his appetite for the verse form in early 1996. ``It 
was like an addiction,'' he recalled. `When it was over, it was completely 
over. I went cold turkey.''
