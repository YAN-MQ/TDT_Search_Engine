David Cone waited in his Connecticut home Wednesday night, pondering 
his future, waiting to see whether the Yankees would agree to his 
latest proposal. He had until midnight to decide whether he would 
immediately work out a one-year deal with the Yankees or opt for free 
agency. ``I'm just real hopeful something will get done,'' Cone said. 
``I'm trying to bend over backwards to get something done.'' Just 
hours before the deadline, the bending ended. Cone signed a one-year 
deal with the Yankees for an $8 million salary that, with incentives, 
might push the value of the deal to about $9.75 million. ``I always 
made it clear that my first choice was the Yankees,'' the right-hander 
said in a conference call Wednesday night. ``That's where I want to 
be, where I want to end my career.'' Cone was well aware that other 
teams, such as the Baltimore Orioles, the Los Angeles Dodgers and 
the Mets, would have been willing to offer him contracts of either 
two or three years, for about $7 million to $8 million annually. But 
he said he thought he had received his ``fair market value'' in the 
deal with the Yankees, for whom he has won 48 games in three and a 
half seasons, including 20 this past season. ``Some people might second-guess 
me for not testing the free-agent waters,'' he said, ``but I'm satisfied.'' 
Staying with the Yankees allows Cone, who turns 36 in January, to 
remain in a stable environment in which he was comfortable, even though 
staying with the Yankees also will cost Cone millions at a point in 
his career when he has already made more than $40 million. The Yankees 
are also moving closer to reaching a final agreement for 1999 with 
Darryl Strawberry, the outfielder who is recovering from the effects 
of colon cancer. That deadline, also for midnight, was extended to 
Nov. 20, the team announced Wednesday night. And the Yankees are monitoring 
what teams are pursuing the free-agent center fielder Bernie Williams 
_ a group that seems to be shrinking. Cone compiled a 20-7 record 
for the Yankees in 1998, the most victories on the team, and Manager 
Joe Torre and club officials have deep respect for the pitcher's competitiveness 
and leadership; he has been among those players who Torre has relied 
upon for clubhouse stability. General Manager Brian Cashman was pleased 
with the signing. ``We are extremely happy to retain such a vital 
part of our championship club and one of the best pitchers in baseball,'' 
he said. Cone had twice agreed to delay the deadline by which he was 
supposed to reject or accept the option for the 1999 season. The Yankees 
were clearly concerned about his physical well-being. The pitcher 
had surgery to repair an aneurysm in 1996 and needed shoulder surgery 
after the 1997 season. When he pitched poorly at the beginning of 
the 1998 season he had fleeting thoughts of retiring; the Yankees 
were concerned when Cone said he had trouble throwing his breaking 
pitches in cold weather. But he rebounded strongly and was dominant 
into late August, before he seemed to wear down. Cone began his rehabilitation 
late last year and has felt that his late-season struggles this year 
were because he did not have the benefit of a full off season of rest, 
and that he tried to make all his scheduled starts as he tried to 
reach the 200-inning mark that gave him the 1999 contract option. 
There is no similar provision in the new deal, Cone said, because 
reaching the 200-inning mark ``became somewhat of a distraction to 
me.'' The Yankees, who have a full accounting of Cone's condition 
from their own doctors, may disagree, and they have relied heavily 
on the advice of their doctors in the past. After the 1996 season, 
the team's doctor, Stuart Hershon, advised the Yankees that they should 
not give Jimmy Key a two-year deal, and the Yankees instead signed 
David Wells to a three-year offer. Wells is a Cy Young award candidate, 
Key broke down. Technically, the Yankees had until midnight Wednesday 
night to decide to exercise the $2.5 million option on Strawberry. 
But they agreed to another extension of the deadline, this one until 
a week from Friday. Williams was in Arizona Wednesday meeting with 
Jerry Colangelo, chairman of the Arizona Diamondbacks, as well as 
with Buck Showalter, the Diamondbacks' manager. Before the meeting, 
Colangelo said he would not engage in a financial war for Williams, 
contesting speculation the Diamondbacks were preparing a deal for 
Williams somewhere in the neighborhood of $90 million to $100 million. 
``I'm not interested in bidding up players at this stage,'' Colangelo 
said. The Los Angeles Dodgers and the Colorado Rockies were expected 
to be involved in the bidding on Williams, but they have already signed 
center fielders. The Yankees have not yet made an offer to Williams, 
but insist they will at some point.
