Now to Tom Aspell in Tel Aviv, where Israelis are taking the possibility 
of air strikes seriously at this hour. Tom, how is it there tonight? 
Brian, Israel is playing down the possibility that it could again 
be a Target for Iraqi missiles. People are preparing just in case. 
Today the government opened more than 100 24-hour distribution centers 
for gas masks against chemical and biological weapons. We don't take 
any chances. We don't want to be surprised. We want to be ready. Iraq 
fired more than 30 Scud misses at Israel during the gulf war in 1991, 
causing wide spread property damage. Under intense U.S. pressure, 
Israel did not retaliate. A decision many Israelis feel was a mistake. 
This time, most people believe there's no cause for alarm assentment 
is encouraged by the government. We will inform the public on preparations 
necessary, as and if they become necessary. At the back of everyone's 
mind here is the thought that arch enemy Iraq may still have the capability 
to hit Israel. If Israel is targeted, there's no guarantee that Benjamin 
Netanyahu will sit this one out. Rounding out our correspondents tonight, 
Tom Aspell reporting live for us this evening.
