Peru's economy will grow by less than 2 percent in 1998, sharply down 
from earlier projections, government officials said. The government 
had projected the gross domestic product to grow by 5 percent in 1998, 
but lowered it to 3-4 percent in mid-1998 as the damage from the global 
economic crisis and the El Nino weather phenomenon to Peru's economy 
became apparent. Finance Minister Jorge Baca announced the lower growth 
figure late Tuesday at a meeting of investors in Brussels, Belgium. 
Newspaper reports of his comments were confirmed Wednesday by officials 
at Peru's Finance Ministry. Economic analysts in Peru said they were 
not surprised by the new growth projection, which is in line with 
private sector estimates. With Peru's population growing by 2.1 percent 
in 1998, the low growth rate means per capita income will contract 
this year, analysts said. ``The average people in Peru will be a little 
worse off this year than they were last year,'' said Javier Noriega, 
senior analyst at Hildebrandt and Ferrar stock brokerage house. Despite 
high economic growth rates over the past six years under President 
Alberto Fujimori's free market program, unemployment and poverty remain 
high, with one in two Peruvians living below the poverty line. Peru's 
exports have been badly hurt by El Nino, which reduced its fish catch 
and devastated its road infrastructure, and the global economic crisis, 
which has led to falling metals prices. Mining and fishing are Peru's 
top two exports.
