Iraq is sticking to its position on arms inspection, despite heightened 
pressure by a U.S. military buildup in the region. UN Secretary General, 
Kofi Annan, appealed to Baghdad to cooperate with UN weapons inspectors. 
Gail Gaflak reports from Cairo. At least 400 UN weapons inspectors 
and humanitarian workers left Baghdad as a precautionary measure. 
Onscom and International Atomic Energy Agency monitors are in Bahrain 
while the UN humanitarian staff has temporarily relocated to Jordan. 
Core UN officials remain in Baghdad. The UN special envoy to Iraq, 
Prakash Shah said the world body decided to withdraw its personnel 
because of possible military strikes. Iraqi Deputy Prime Minister, 
Tariq Aziz told Shah Iraq wouldn't change its position on arms inspections 
unless the security council takes steps on lifting sanctions. Shah 
countered the remark. He emphasized the need to for Baghdad to comply 
with Security Council resolutions in order for a comprehensive sanctions 
review to begin. For NPR News, I am Gail Gaflak in Cairo.
