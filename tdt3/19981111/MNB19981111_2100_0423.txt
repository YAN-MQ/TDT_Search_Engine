Now to Linda Vester in Baghdad where the yarky people are preparing 
tor what could be at this hour inevitable. Linda? Brian, tonight there 
is a notable dramatic change in the atmosphere here. Most importantly 
now as of today, Saddam Hussein, the Iraqi government ordered Iraqi 
troops on a high, high alert. Certain units have been ordered to scatter. 
Troops ordered to scatter certain assets like airplanes. That is to 
prevent them from getting hit by air strikes. It shows the Iraqi government 
has finally taken ahold of the possibility that air strikes are imminent. 
As for civilians, I told you last night, watch for the gas stations. 
That if civilians starto perceive air strikes are coming soon, they'll 
line up at the fuel pump. Sure enough today, that is what happened. 
At gas stations in downtown Baghdad, Iraqis waited in long lines today, 
a Sign they expect air strikes soon and a cut-off of fuel. You see 
what's happening from America? At a hospital, people lined up for 
medicine, expecting this, too, will be cut off if their country comes 
under attack. At a grade school, teachers led children in a patriotic 
show of defiance. We hope there is no direct hit on our school thrks 
teacher said. That will be a cat as fee. The most serious sign this 
situation is coming to a head? Tonight, Iraq's deputy prime minister 
Tariq Aziz made a last-ditch appeal to the world on TV, blaming the 
U.S. for this crisis. If this crisis is comboge to escalate to an 
aggression, it's their decision and it's not the responsibility Iraq. 
Well, now that news conference from Tariq Aziz followed a day of titanticic 
phone calls by him to U.N. secretary Kofi Annan. We're told that the 
answer from Annan was no despite what was asking, please come to Baghdad 
and defuse this crisis. He said, the only way I would come is if you 
resolve it yourselves. I don't look for Kofi Annan to fly to Baghdad 
to fix these things. Linda Vester, thank you.
