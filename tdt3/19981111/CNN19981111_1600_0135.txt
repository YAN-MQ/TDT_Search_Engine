Chief U.N. arms inspector Richard Butler says he pulled most weapons 
inspectors out of Iraq today on the strong recommendation of the United 
States. U.N. secretary general Kofi Annan is cutting short a trip 
to north Africa to return to New York to monitor the situation. At 
the request of Russia, the security council is holding closed-door 
consultations on the matter this afternoon. Jane arraf has more from 
Baghdad. For the first time in the last eight years, the U.N. pulled 
virtually all its staff out of Baghdad. The evacuation of all the 
U.N. weapons inspectors and most humanitarian workers left only local 
staff and top officials facing the prospect of a U.S. attack. Well, 
the staff was relocated -- as I said, temporarily relocated -- in 
consultation with New York and the background of possible military 
action against Iraq. U.N. sources said UNSCOM chief Richard Butler 
gave the word early wednesday morning that an attack could be coming. 
His people left within hours. Officials say other U.N. programs will 
continue. But without international staff, one of the cornerstones 
of the U.N.'s role here, monitoring food and medicine distribution, 
will be impossible. There will be a slowdown. There will be quite 
a slowdown. But we are trying to make the best out of a very difficult 
circumstance. The evacuation appeared to signal the failure of diplomacy. 
The U.N. special envoy for Iraq briefed diplomats on the pullout and 
on baghdad's position that it wouldn't lift its ban on weapons inspections 
without the prospect of having sanctions lifted. Many Iraqis were 
hoping that U.N. secretary-general Kofi Annan would return to Baghdad 
and defuse this crisis as he did the last one. While U.N. staff left 
to safety, a storm drenched Baghdad. But somebody who is already soaked 
doesn't fear the rain, they say. With the U.S. ready for a strike 
and Iraq refusing the back down, there seems little hope for a diplomatic 
solution.
