They tried, but in the end, stocks couldn't hold onto an early rally. 
Stocks jumped at the open after a bullish report from chip-giant Intel 
sent tech stocks soaring. The bond market was closed in observation 
of the veteran's day holiday. One analyst said he expects the market 
to perk up just in time for the holidays. The holiday season will 
be pretty good. The reason why I say that is because the country is 
awash in money. Money supply growth has been in double digits in the 
last 13 weeks for the first time in 12 to 15 years. So, there is a 
host of cash around, and when there's that much cash around, people 
like to go shopping.
