Yesterday's interview with economist Lester Thoreau urked a number 
of listeners. Thoreau's belief that debt relief for countries devastated 
by Hurricane Mitch would only benefit a few rich Central Americans 
is wrong, according to Professor Mark Adleman of City University of 
New York. In an e-mail he wrote, debt relief would allow governments 
to use money for reconstruction rather than to pay foreign lenders 
and that, he ways would put Central America back on its feet much 
sooner.
