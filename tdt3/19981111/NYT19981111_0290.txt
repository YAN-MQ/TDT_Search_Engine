EVERYBODY needs somebody sometime to help with balky hardware or software. 
But there may be ways to avoid calls for technical support. REGISTER 
Sending in your registration cards puts you on the list for bug alerts, 
and helps you negotiate for free help. BACK UP THE ESSENTIALS Keep 
the product names and the telephone numbers of the companies that 
make them. Keep on hand a copy of the disk that contains your operating 
system. Make a ``boot disk'' to start your computer from the floppy 
drive when Windows will not start from the hard drive. With a floppy 
disk in the drive, right-click My Computer on the desktop, left-click 
``Open,'' right-click on the floppy drive, and left-click ``Format.'' 
Left-click ``Copy system files only'' and ``Start.'' Keep all your 
system disks together. SEARCH FOR VIRUSES An antivirus utility checks 
for problems when you start your computer. You should back up your 
files weekly _ daily for important, current ones _ and scan your disk 
for errors once a month. WATCH FOR UPDATES Make regular visits to 
sites that report bugs and how to fix them, especially when you are 
about to upgrade or install something new. Programs like Quarterdeck's 
TuneUp and RealHelp and Cybermedia's Oil Change will compare your 
system to a Web-based archive of fixes, find what is missing, and 
show you how to download it. A free Web-based service called Catch-UP 
is available at www.catch.com. LOOK BEFORE YOU LOAD ``If it ain't 
broke, don't upgrade it,'' advises Joel Diamond, technical director 
of the Windows User Group Network. Bug fixes may have bugs of their 
own. And stick with responsible sites, like Download.com.
