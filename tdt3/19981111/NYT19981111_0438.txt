With the resignation of the second House speaker in a decade, the 
first is hoping that historians will now come to see him as prophetic, 
rather than fallen and sullied. Not that Jim Wright, a Democrat who 
resigned as speaker in 1989 after an ethics investigation kicked off 
by Newt Gingrich, would permit himself to exult now that Gingrich 
is leaving. Certainly not publicly. ``It would ill become me to gloat 
or to say, `I'm glad you're gone, you rascal, you,' '' he said in 
a late afternoon interview at his office here on the campus of Texas 
Christian University. No, that would be the sort of behavior that, 
in measured words, he decries. But Wright is quite willing to recall 
his warning in his resignation speech on the House floor that Gingrich 
himself would be consumed by his own ``mindless cannibalism.'' Gingrich, 
Wright said, echoing comments he made in a book several years ago, 
``reminds me of an arsonist who sets fire to his building without 
stopping to realize the flames are going to consume his own apartment.'' 
Neither did it escape Wright's notice that in notifying Republicans 
last Friday night that he was resigning, Gingrich said, ``I'm not 
willing to preside over people who are cannibals.'' The results of 
the last election and the likely choice of Rep. Robert Livingston 
of Louisiana as the next speaker give Wright confidence that a new, 
more constructive tone will finally prevail. Judging from the comments 
of friends who served with Livingston on the Appropriations Committee, 
Wright said, ``I have the impression that Bob Livingston will be more 
an agent of unity than polarization.'' But Wright grants that the 
public and the Congress took years longer to reject the scandal-mongering 
style that Gingrich and, yes, many members of his own party practiced. 
He thought his own resignation _ from the leadership and, like Gingrich's, 
from the Congress _ would be cathartic. He thought that civility and 
collegiality would be restored. ``But you might as well have been 
trying to siphon off the Gulf of Mexico with an eyedropper,'' he said. 
Instead, he witnessed years when budget disputes shut down the government, 
campaigns became sharply negative and trading accusations took the 
place of improving health care or education.
