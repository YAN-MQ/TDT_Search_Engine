Thai police said Wednesday they have made their biggest heroin seizure 
this year in the northern province of Phrae, arresting a man allegedly 
carrying 44.5 kilograms (98 pounds) of the drug. Peng Phimphisarn 
was arrested Tuesday when police stopped and searched his pickup truck, 
said Prakob Panyawansiri, director of the Northern Narcotics Control 
Office. Peng told police that he had been hired to transport the drug 
from Chiang Rai, Thailand's northernmost province, to Bangkok. He 
would not say who hired him, Prakob said. Conviction on a charge of 
trafficking in heroin can result in a life sentence or the death penalty. 
Northern Thailand is part of the infamous Golden Triangle region where 
the borders of Thailand, Laos and Myanmar _ also called Burma _ meet. 
The area is one of the world's major producers of opium and its derivative, 
heroin.
