NBC news "in depth" tonight, O.J. Simpson. It's been 4 1/2 years since 
his ex-wife Nicole was brutally murdered. And the legal battle is 
still going on. The former in-laws are trying to regain custody of 
their two children. They just won a big round in court. More on that 
from Dan Lothian. An appeals court ruling giving the children's grandparents 
and former guardians, Lou and juditha brown, another chance at custody. 
We're absolutely convinced that it would be in the best interest of 
the children to be with their grandparents. For the past two years, 
O.J. Simpson has been caring for his two children, 13-year-old Sydney 
and 10-year-old Justin. Supporting them on his $25,000 a month NFL 
pension. The children's attorney says, "they love their grandparents, 
but they want to stay with their father." And adds, they are disappointed 
by the latest ruling. Four years of their mother's death, Simpson 
family members say Justin and sydney are happy where they are. The 
children are doing great. But the appeals court found mistakes were 
made in the last custody battle when evidence about whether Simpson 
killed wife, Nicole, and ron Goldman and his possible violent tendencies 
were left out. Author and clinical psychologist Louis nightingale, 
who's dealt with many custody issues, says stability is what's important 
for the children. Children need to have a sense of continuity in their 
lives even if the adults in their lives feel that it's important to 
change that situation. What's legally right and what's right for the 
children, she argues, sometimes conflict. But family law expert sorrell 
trope says, law is law, It is appropriate for the trial court to hear 
evidence of the events that were presented during the civil trial 
against Mr. sempson where he was found culpable of the wrangful death. 
Simpson now faces a court hearing and what amounts to another trial, 
where some legal experts say he will have to prove again that he's 
a Fit parent. Dan Lothian, NBC news, Los Angeles.
