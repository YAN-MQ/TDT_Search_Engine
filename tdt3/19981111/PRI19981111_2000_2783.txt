Well, listeners seem to have an easy time locating us. We received 
a number of letters and phone calls about our interview last week 
with Honduran Episcopal Bishop, Leo Frave, who expressed his anger 
at God for the devastation of his country. Jonathan Peterson of Grand 
Rapids, Michigan writes he was deeply moved by the Bishop's honesty 
and emotions. "I came away for the first time in all the media reports 
I had heard, really understanding and feeling the destruction and 
turmoil of Hurricane Mitch, and for the first time, prayed for the 
victims."
