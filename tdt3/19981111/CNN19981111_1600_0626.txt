Some abortion providers in the northeast and Canada have taken today 
off. In the past four years around veteran's day, Canada's remembrance 
day, five doctors who perform abortions have been shot. And as Norman 
hermant reports, a Canadian newspaper which has received anti-abortion 
threats in the past, just got another one. The latest package received 
at the Hamilton's spectator has abortion clinics across the country 
even more on edge. Yesterday the paper received another message along 
with a possible threat. For those of us who have to worry about who 
these people are and what the risks are, it's created a huge amount 
of tension. This latest package has all the hallmarks of the last 
ones. Police suspect they may be linked to James kopp, linked to another 
murder. A task force is also seeking him in connection with the shootings 
of three doctors who performed abortions in this country. Those shootings 
happened over the last four years. Some clinics have closed for security 
reasons. With employees making sure they're not identified. The way 
things have happened, I don't think we can give ourselves 100% protection. 
We are more alert and concerned an anxious this week than any other 
time. Despite a reward, police haven't been able to find kopp, and 
they don't know for sure who's behind the shootings. Norman hermant, 
Toronto.
