A leading republican senator is calling for an end to the house Judiciary 
committee impeachment inquiry against President Clinton. Pennsylvania's 
Arlen specter says the proceeding will tie up the government for months. 
And he says the GOP will not get the 67 votes in the Senate to remove 
the president from office. But specter adds President Clinton should 
be prosecuted after he leaves office.
