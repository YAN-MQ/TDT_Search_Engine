Jason Stoltenberg scored a stunning victory in the first round of 
the Stockholm Open on Wednesday, upsetting top-ranked Pete Sampras 
7-6 (7-5), 4-6, 6-4. Stoltenberg, an Australian ranked 29th who had 
lost all four previous matches to Sampras, needed seven match points 
before wrapping up the victory in 2 hours, 14 minutes. ``I thought 
it was at least 15,'' Stoltenberg said. ``I thought it was slipping 
away at the end. I held on.'' Sampras' early exit could jeopardize 
his chances of finishing the season as world No. 1 for a record sixth 
consecutive year. Marcelo Rios, playing a clay court tournament in 
his native Chile this week, could overtake him. Earlier, Britain's 
Tim Henman advanced to the quarterfinals with a straight-sets victory 
over Wayne Ferreira of South Africa. Henman's countryman, Greg Rusedski, 
was more convincing with a 52-minute victory over Tommy Haas, 6-1, 
6-4. ``I couldn't be playing much better tennis if I tried,'' said 
Rusedski, who defeated Sampras in the finals of the Paris Open last 
weekend. ``It must be my new improved returns.'' Henman was much more 
evenly matched. He started fast, then struggled before breaking Ferreira's 
serve to force a tiebreak. He won 7-6 (7-3), 6-4. ``It was an up-and-down 
first set,'' Henman said. ``My serving was erratic at that point.'' 
Henman and Rusedski, ranked Nos. 10 and 11 in the world, are trying 
to qualify for the last spots in the ATP Tour Championships in Hanover, 
Germany, later this month. Sampras is already in that event. ``I think 
I've got to get to the finals,'' Rusedski said. ``I'm just thinking 
about my tennis and everything else will take care of itself.... If 
it works, it works. If it doesn't, it doesn't.'' Rusedski is on a 
roll. He called last week's victory over Sampras, ``probably my greatest 
accomplishment in tennis, by far.'' In other matches Wednesday, American 
Todd Martin defeated Australia's hard-serving Wayne Arthurs, 6-4, 
6-3, to join Henman in the quarterfinals. Arthurs, a 27-year-old doubles 
specialist, had upset second seed and world No. 7 Karol Kucera of 
Slovakia on Tuesday.
