In Jacksonville, Florida, a week-long search for a missing 8-year-old 
girl has come to an end. Police found her body encased in the waterbed 
of a 14-year-old boy who lived across the street. The sheriff says 
the boy confessed killing the girl and has been charged with murder. 
The boy's mother says she became suspicious after she detected an 
odor coming from her son's bedroom. We followed up on over 250 leads, 
some as far as Greenville, Indiana. We had searched that house three 
previous times and the reason we didn't find maddie is because of 
the way she was encased in the bed. The sheriff would not discuss 
a motive for the killing.
