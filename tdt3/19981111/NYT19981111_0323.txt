Fireplace tools have gone minimal this fall. Reduced to their bare 
essentials, they're leaving the big show to the fire. There's a fireplace 
screen from France _ a simple wisp of wave-shaped stainless-steel 
mesh that holds one basic brass tool _ and a set of tools from Denmark 
so minimalist that it looks like a line drawing on the wall. 1. A 
four-piece iron tool set includes a hollow rod that functions as a 
bellows when air is blown through it. The set, called Mace-Line, was 
designed by Ann Maes, an American, and made in the Netherlands. It 
is $395 at Moss, 146 Greene St. (Houston Street). 2. A wrought-iron 
fireplace log-and-tool holder is $149 from the Pottery Barn catalog; 
(800) 922-5507. 3. A hand-forged iron poker and shovel hang on a shapely 
stand. The set is by Alchemy Metalworks of San Francisco. It is $195 
at Modern Stone Age, 111 Greene St. (Prince Street). 4. This four-piece 
set of brushed-stainless-steel tools with wood handles was made in 
Portugal. It is $340 at Troy, 138 Greene St. (Houston Street). 5. 
A canvas-trimmed jute carry-bag holds 16-inch logs and folds for storage. 
It is $42.50 at Ad Hoc Softwares, 410 West Broadway (Spring Street). 
6. This curved fire screen of stainless-steel mesh was made in France 
and has a hand-forged brass poker. It is $285 at Modern Stone Age. 
The Swiss-made brushed-aluminum log holder is $240 at Troy. 7. The 
most minimal tool set hangs on the wall. It includes tongs and a poker 
that can be used as a bellows. The set, made of steel, was designed 
by Nils Ollgaard in Denmark. It is $79 at the MOMA Design Store, 44 
W. 53rd St.
