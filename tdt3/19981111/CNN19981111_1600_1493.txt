A spokesman for Rick James says a long recuperation period will be 
needed before the funk singer can walk again. He suffered a stroke 
Monday, and was rushed to cedars-Sinai medical center in Los Angeles. 
According to James' spokesman, doctors say the singer's wild neck 
gyrations during performances caused a blood vessel in his neck to 
rupture, resulting in the stroke. James is best known for his 1981 
hit "super freak."
