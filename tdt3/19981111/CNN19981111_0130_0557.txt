Advertisers have long known that sex sells. Now, some anti-smoking 
forces hope to use that maxim to their advantage. They've unveiled 
public service announcements that warn smoking can contribute to impotence. 
Smoking adversely impacts the circulatory system in the small blood 
vessels which are essential for erection. And the studies show that 
men who smoke are twice as likely to have impotence as men who do 
not smoke. Smokers also have erections which are less frequent, poor 
in quality and shorter in duration than nonsmokers. Anti-smoking activists 
says the habit kills 400,000 Americans each year.
