The five Nordic countries on Wednesday jointly condemned Iraq's refusal 
to cooperate with U.N. inspectors searching for weapons of mass destruction 
and demanded that the country immediately reverse its position. Hundreds 
of U.N. weapons inspectors from UNSCOM and other staff left Baghdad 
on Wednesday, amid preparations for a possible U.S. military strike 
against Iraq. The country has said it will not cooperate with inspectors 
until the U.N. Security Council moves to lift an embargo imposed after 
the 1991 Gulf War. The foreign ministers of Norway, Sweden, Denmark, 
Finland and Iceland, gathered in Oslo for a regular meeting of their 
Nordic Council, ``condemn, as totally unacceptable, Iraq's decision 
of Oct. 31 to stop all cooperation with UNSCOM,'' a joint statement 
said. The Nordic ministers said they fully supported a U.N. Security 
Council resolution of Nov. 5 demanding that Iraq immediately resume 
cooperation with UNSCOM and inspectors from the International Atomic 
Energy Agency. The Nordic statement did not say whether the countries 
supported possible military action against Iraq. The U.N. resolution, 
which the five ministers fully endorsed, warned Iraq of ``severest 
consequences'' if it failed to allow inspectors unfettered access 
to suspected weapons sites.
