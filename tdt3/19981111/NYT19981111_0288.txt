Even that cool photograph-analysis machine that Harrison Ford used 
in the futuristic science-fiction classic ``Blade Runner'' couldn't 
change the perspective of a photograph so that it could be viewed 
360 degrees by 360 degrees. But a new technology, now being offered 
to consumers, can do just that, tilting an image and circling around 
it as if the viewer were standing at the center of a panorama. Interactive 
Pictures Corp. is a leading developer of what its executives call 
immersive photographic image technology. ``For 130 years, a picture 
basically was a flat panel shot,'' said James Phillips, chairman and 
chief executive of the company, based in San Jose, Calif. With these 
new photographs, called IPIX (www.ipix.com), ``we literally allow 
you to step inside of every picture,'' he said. The photographs, taken 
with specially outfitted conventional cameras or digital ones, are 
created with a special software program. On a personal computer, the 
software combines two 180-degree photographs, taken with a fish-eye 
lens, of a scene or object. When the two images are melded into one, 
viewers can use the mouse to navigate within the photograph and beyond 
its borders, left, right, up or down. For example, on the company's 
site, an IPIX photograph of Frank Lloyd Wright's Fallingwater can 
be seen conventionally, as an image of a house nestled in the woods 
of Pennsylvania. But viewers can also change their vantage point, 
so that it seems as if they are standing in front of the house, looking 
into the woods. If they move the mouse up, the image reveals the sky. 
If they move it down, they see the ground. Viewers can also zoom in 
and out of the photograph with a click of the mouse. ``It is one of 
the unique things you can do,'' Jeff Garrard, executive editor of 
Cable News Network, said of IPIX images. For more than a year, CNN 
and a number of companies, including hotel chains, automobile makers 
and entertainment businesses like MTV and other news operations like 
The New York Times on the Web, have been using IPIX images on their 
Internet sites. CNN also used the technology to explore the cockpit 
of the Space Shuttle during its coverage of the recent mission involving 
John Glenn. For millions, it was the first time they had seen IPIX 
images. Now more may view them. Until recently, IPIX technology was 
sold mostly to photography enthusiasts and Web developers. But last 
week, IPIX kits, including the fish-eye lens, software and a rotating 
tripod, were packaged with consumer-friendly digital cameras from 
Kodak, Olympus and Nikon. The sets range in price from $600 to $2,000. 
``This,'' Phillips said, ``will totally reshape photography.''
