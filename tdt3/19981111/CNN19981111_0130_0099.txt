The federal emergency management agency is trying to cut costs in 
its flood insurance program. Property losses from floods have gone 
up to an estimated $4 billion a year. FEMA plans to deny flood insurance 
to owners of high-risk buildings who refuse to either elevate them 
or accept a buyout. We must all ask ourselves, should we be rebuilding 
roads and infrastructure where we know they will be destroyed again? 
By rebuilding this infrastructure are we putting people back in harm's 
way? FEMA says if approved by Congress, the plan will save nearly 
$1 billion over the next ten years.
