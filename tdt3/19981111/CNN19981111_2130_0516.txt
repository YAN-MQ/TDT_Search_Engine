Now the extended weather forecast. This look at your "CNN Headline 
News Weather" begins with a look at your forecast weather map and 
rainfall in Texas and a low pressure center in the southwest. The 
storm in the southwest moved in through California bringing in rainfall 
and some snowfall as it moved inland. But it is a weak area of low 
pressure. We'll continue to monitor its progress. The moisture in 
Texas may spread to the north and eventually across parts of the southeastern 
United States. Meanwhile, a bad storm that plagued parts of the east 
coast moves away. Here is your forecast weather map for high temperatures 
tomorrow. And as you can see, cold air slides in behind a cold front 
coming in from the north. Moderate temperatures in most other places. 
Extended forecast calls for showers throughout Texas and parts of 
the southeast. Temperatures will be only in the 30s in the upper midwest 
on Friday. As we move on into Saturday, we see some rain showers through 
parts of the east. The southeast may see some thunderstorm activity. 
And on Sunday, we're looking at rain showers and thunderstorms covering 
much of the east. For more weather information, log on to CNN.com,
