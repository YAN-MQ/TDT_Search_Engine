Balkan nations do not have enough strength on their own to solve the 
Kosovo crisis, so an international cooperation is vital, Bulgarian 
Premier Ivan Kostov said Wednesday. ``We, the neighboring countries, 
must have a fire extinguisher in our hands when dealing with the Yugoslav 
issues,'' Kostov told reporters after talks with his Hungarian counterpart, 
Viktor Orban. Kostov said the breakup of the Yugoslav Federation created 
a bad image of the Balkans abroad and the region has suffered from 
this for too long. ``We hope a peaceful and lasting solution will 
be found to the (Kosovo) crisis, with a strong international pressure 
on Milosevic,'' he said. ``There is a realistic danger that, unless 
this crisis is solved, the Balkans would be even further divided,'' 
Orban said. During discussions, the two premiers agreed to intensify 
bilateral relations, the first step of which was the overwhelming 
majority of votes in the Hungarian Parliament Monday to allow Bulgaria 
to become member of the Central European Free Trade Agreement (CEFTA). 
Kostov said Bulgaria conducts a very rigorous fiscal policy, pointing 
out that without this they couldn't have pressed down the 670 percent 
hyperinflation rate in 1996 to a current 2.6 percent, and a 300 percent 
interest rate to 5 percent. Bulgaria hopes to begin European Union 
admission negotiations by the year 2001, and Kostov noted that entering 
CEFTA is good training for future EU membership. Bilateral trade between 
Hungary and Bulgaria has increased by 25 percent this year, and a 
further solid growth is expected, Orban said.
