Here in the U.S., President Clinton helped honor American veterans 
by signing new legislation. Before making the traditional speech and 
laying a wreath at the tomb of the unknowns in Arlington national 
cemetery, he released $1 billion approved by congress to improve military 
readiness. He also signed laws that increase veterans' disability 
payments and extend priority health care to gulf war vets.
