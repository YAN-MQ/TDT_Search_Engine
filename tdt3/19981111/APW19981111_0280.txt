Britain's queen and France's president presided Wednesday over an 
occasion both grand and poignant _ the last major anniversary of the 
Great War likely to include actual veterans of the carnage. At 11 
a.m., Queen Elizabeth II, wearing a bright lavender coat and hat, 
arrived at Paris' grandest military site, Napoleon's Arc de Triomphe, 
where she and President Jacques Chirac laid a huge wreath at the Tomb 
of the Unknown Soldier. Both were presented to four World War I veterans 
_ 101-year-old Gen. Maurice Bourgeois, a lieutenant at Verdun; Abramo 
Pellencin, 102; Guy Cohen, 101, and Georges Rideau, 101. France's 
oldest survivor from the war _ Raymond Abescat, 107 _ was unable to 
attend. The 80th anniversary of when the guns fell silent _ at the 
11th hour of the 11th day of the 11th month of 1918 _ was being marked 
with pomp and ceremony under sunny skies. ``I prefer not to talk about 
it,'' an emotional Rideau told reporters. ``There are good and bad 
memories. I did my duty.'' He said that it was ``painful'' that today's 
youth did not seem interested in the Great War. Bruno Manfrini, an 
84-year-old World War II veteran, was first to jump to attention when 
the French national anthem, the Marseillaise, began to play at the 
Arc de Triomphe, saluting with his white-gloved hand. ``It's a magnificent 
moment for France to have the queen here on this occasion,'' Manfrini 
said. Pointing to the blue sky, he added: ``The good Lord was thinking 
of us today.'' It was supposed to be a quick war, and a ``war to end 
all wars,'' but of course it wasn't. It was a four-year nightmare 
of unimaginable brutality, one that killed millions and changed Europe 
forever. Precious few are still alive who fought in World War I. And 
yet fascination with the conflict remains, evident in the countless 
grainy, black-and-white photos gracing newspaper and magazine covers 
in France and Britain as the anniversary approached. Chirac and the 
queen were to place another wreath at a statue of Georges Clemenceau, 
France's deeply respected World War I leader. There were echoes of 
World War II as well: the queen planned to unveil a statue of Sir 
Winston Churchill, on an avenue renamed the Avenue Winston Churchill. 
Later in the day, the queen was to travel to Ypres in Belgium, where 
she was joining Belgian King Albert II in remembering the appalling 
losses from a four-year war of attrition against the Germans in the 
trenches there. There was one major figure missing from the ceremonies: 
Germany's new leader, chancellor-elect Gerhard Schroeder, who informed 
Chirac he could not attend because his calendar was already full with 
creating a new government. Schroeder dismissed as ``rubbish'' reports 
that he wasn't attending because he wanted to avoid the past. The 
Great War killed 13 million civilians and 8.5 million fighting men. 
Germany lost an estimated 1.7 million soldiers; Britain lost more 
than 900,000; Italy 650,000; the United States 116,000. France was 
proportionally the hardest hit, with 1.3 million dead. The sheer devastation 
wrought on France can partly be measured by the 30,000 or so monuments 
in cities, towns and villages across the nation. Some villages list 
more war dead than their current populations. As if there were any 
doubt about the enduring wound left by the war, a bitter dispute broke 
out between the political right and left just days before the anniversary. 
Socialist Prime Minister Lionel Jospin, visiting the site of a suicidal 
offensive against the Germans at Chemin des Dames, asked that 49 mutineers 
executed ``as an example'' be ``fully reintegrated today into our 
national collective memory.'' Chirac, a rightist, called Jospin's 
remarks ``inopportune.'' And a political ally of the president's, 
former Interior Minister Jean-Louis Debre, said Jospin's remarks were 
``of a nature to justify acts of mutiny in the future.'' The same 
debate has taken place in Britain, where last week, some 306 men executed 
for cowardice or desertion were not included in a memorial led by 
the queen. Many are believed now to have been suffering from post-traumatic 
stress disorder after enduring the horrors of the trenches for months.
