Private pain and public hopes came together in a Berlin mansion last 
week when the new American Academy was opened on a site marked by 
Nazi terror and now dedicated to the trans-Atlantic partnership that 
raised Germany from the ruins of war. Speaking at what was once the 
lakeside house of a prominent Jewish banking family, former Secretary 
of State Henry Kissinger described Hitler's rule as ``an aberration, 
but not an organic aspect of German society'' and said the academy's 
existence showed how the wounds of ``the 12-year interregnum'' could 
be overcome. Much of the founding grant for the academy was provided 
by the descendants of Hans Arnhold, a Jewish banker who fled the mansion 
before it became the wartime home of Hitler's chief economic adviser, 
Walther Funk, and later a recreation center for Americans stationed 
on the Cold War's eastern frontier. Richard von Weizsacker, the former 
German president, called the Arnhold family's endowment of the academy 
an act of ``unbelievable magnanimity,'' dedicated to overcoming ``the 
evil of the past'' through ``a generous gift for the future.'' Behind 
von Weizsacker, sailboats passed on the waters of the Wannsee lake, 
on whose banks stands another villa where the destruction of European 
Jewry was decided by Nazi bureaucrats on Jan. 20, 1942, a decision 
later described by Adolph Eichmann as ``the final solution of the 
Jewish question.'' The Arnhold family escaped, but as she recalled 
the lost places of her childhood, Anna-Maria Kellen, Arnhold's daughter 
and now a New York philanthropist, battled her emotions. The staircase 
where she once played was gone, she said, but not her hope that the 
mansion would now be a ``staircase leading to higher levels of understanding 
and closer degree of cooperation.'' The academy was conceived four 
years ago as a symbol of enduring American commitment to Germany after 
the end of the Cold War, a demonstration that even in the absence 
of a common enemy a relationship at the heart of the NATO alliance 
would not be allowed to erode. But Kissinger, an honorary chairman 
of the academy, and Michael Naumann, the chief cultural official in 
Germany's new Social Democratic government, both expressed concerns 
about the state of German-American relations. ``A new generation of 
German and American leaders must redefine the creative purpose of 
this period,'' Kissinger said. ``America and Europe no longer have 
clearly defined common paths.'' Naumann, a former chief executive 
of the publisher Henry Holt in New York, lamented a loss of ``Germany's 
political importance in the United States'' and said he detected the 
``quiet emergence of a cultural anti-Americanism'' in Europe driven 
by negative reaction to ubiquitous American television and the effects 
on incredulous Europeans of the Clinton sex scandal. By holding seminars 
and by awarding fellowships to American, German and central European 
scholars in the fields of the arts and humanities, the academy aims 
to promote understanding between Germany and the United States. While 
Richard Holbrooke, chairman of the academy, talked of Funk and the 
Nazis, who built a bunker in the basement of the house, a sudden gust 
blew in from the Wannsee. It forced open the glass door behind Holbrooke 
and sent a sudden rush of cold air through the house. ``The ghost 
of our former occupants,'' Holbrooke said.
