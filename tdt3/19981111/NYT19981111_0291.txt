I have a very promiscuous computer. In the seven months since I bought 
my Micron Millenia, I have introduced it to no fewer than 100 new 
software programs _ including about three dozen shareware applications 
_ and nearly a dozen hardware gadgets. Electronic books, printers, 
digital cameras: if someone invented a computerized toothbrush, I'd 
probably try to hook that up, too. Or I would have, until the other 
day, when my computer let me know that it had had enough. At first, 
its message was subtle: it crashed. I rebooted. Crash. I rebooted. 
That time, everything seemed fine _ until I clicked on the My Computer 
icon on the desktop. Then it crashed again. ``This is odd,'' I said 
to my husband in the same unconcerned tone I use when the cats have 
deposited yet another decapitated mouse on the living-room rug. ``Do 
you think I should uninstall the beta version of that new printer 
driver?'' ``Or maybe the computer doesn't like that home-networking 
card I put inside it,'' my husband replied in the same reasonable 
tone he uses to inform me that he plans to scoop up mouse organs with 
a dustpan. ``I'll just take it out.'' A half-hour later, the printer 
software had been removed, the home network was history, and I was 
rebooting my computer. Smugly, I thought to myself, there, that wasn't 
so bad. This, of course, is what armchair psychiatrists like to refer 
to as a classic response. When the familiar Windows desktop filled 
my screen and I clicked on My Computer, the computer froze. My husband 
and I looked at each other and tried not to speak. I was dying to 
blame him for his home-networking card and he was dying to blame me 
for infecting my machine with a buggy, throw-a-pie-in-Bill-Gates'-face 
freeware screen saver. Blaming someone else for your own problems 
is another classic response. So my husband said bravely, ``If you 
watch the baby for the next few minutes, I'll phone Micron tech support 
and ask them if they've ever heard of this problem before.'' An hour 
and a half later, he called down the stairs, ``Do you know where the 
Windows boot disk is?'' That, I admit, is the first moment that reality 
hit: we were in a state of techno-despair. My computer was fried. 
So much junk had been added to and removed from it over the months 
that there was no telling what caused the problem. It could have been 
a flawed driver, a device conflict or a turf war between the computer 
and the printer. Micron's tech support staff had recommended a clean 
installation of the Windows 98 operating system. I also recognized, 
belatedly, that I had ignored the early symptoms. First, you notice 
a problem, like the fact that the My Computer icon doesn't snap to 
attention when you address it. Next, you kid yourself. Oh, this will 
only take a minute to fix. An hour later, you're invested. It's similar 
to the same phenomenon that overtakes bidders at the antiques auctions 
that I attend every few months at the American Legion Hall in Huntington, 
N.Y., where I live. If bidders knew they would have to cough up $1,000 
for a rickety table, they would never raise their paddles in the first 
place. But they get swept up gradually, their bids growing. Then they 
get invested in the process _ and whip out their checkbooks. ``Let's 
just buy another computer,'' I said, which, as my husband well knew, 
was code for ``Could you fix it for me?'' Then I took the baby downstairs. 
An hour and a half later, my husband had reinstalled the operating 
system, following some complicated instructions from the Micron tech 
support staff that he will not be able to remember in the event that 
he ever has to do it again. A half-hour after that, he had found the 
necessary modem driver on the U.S. Robotics site in a remote spot 
he will not be able to find in the event he ever has to do that again. 
An hour later, we had located _ after hunting behind the desk and 
under the rug and in the crawlspace behind our office _ the disks 
necessary to reinstall the Eudora e-mail program, Microsoft Word and 
all my online services' software. An hour later, I had tweaked my 
desktop settings, recreated all the shortcuts to open my favorite 
programs and amazingly found my Winzip shareware program still lurking 
on my hard drive. After more than six hours FROM TIME OF FIRST CRASH, 
my computer was back (more or less). The moral seems to be this: if 
you love only what you can do with computers, you don't really love 
computers. To really love them, you have to love the process of computers. 
Fortunately, my husband has learned to love process. An old friend 
of ours _ a former teen-age hacker who spent time in federal prison 
after messing around with the phone company's equipment _ once confided 
that the thing he loved above all else about computers was that no 
matter what went wrong, you could always fix it. ``How many other 
problems can you know for sure you can fix?'' my husband said. He 
felt justifiably proud. A classic response. e-mail address: Slatalla(AT)nytimes.com
