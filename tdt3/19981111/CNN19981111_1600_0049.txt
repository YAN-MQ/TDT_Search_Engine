President Clinton is upping the ante in the standoff with Iraq over 
U.N. weapons inspections. He's sending more U.S. military hardware 
to the Persian gulf, including 129 warplanes and 3,000 additional 
troops. That includes 12 stealth fighter jets and 18 bombers. These 
moves would give the United States a force of 23 ships and more than 
23,000 troops in the gulf. 173 planes are already deployed in the 
region and that number will jump to 375 when the aircraft carrier 
"USS enterprise" arrives on November 22nd. Iraq says it won't allow 
weapons inspections until sanctions are lifted. President Clinton 
says Baghdad must first show the world it isn't trying to build another 
arsenal of weapons of mass destruction. Now, if Saddam Hussein is 
really serious about wanting sanctions lifted, there is an easy way 
to demonstrate that. Let UNSCOM do its job without interference. Fullly 
comply. The international community is united that Saddam must not 
have it both ways by keeping his weapons of mass destruction capability 
and still getting rid of the sanctions.
