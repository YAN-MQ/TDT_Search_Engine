Police in St. Joseph, Missouri, say they'll use fingerprints to identify 
a Sniper who opened fire downtown Tuesday evening. A police officer 
was killed and at least three others were wounded. Authorities cornered 
the gunman behind a church and killed him in a Shootout. Police say 
initial reports that he began firing from the window of an apartment 
building are untrue. Witnesses say he was just shooting at people 
randomly on the sidewalk.
