On this veterans day here at home, across Europe, commemorations marked 
armistice day. It was 80 years ago today that the guns of world war 
I fell silent. And as it happened then, at the 11th hour of the 11th 
day of the 11th month, big Ben sounded the news. All over Europe, 
a minute of silence brought activity to a standstill as the war dead 
were remembered. Queen Elizabeth traveled to Belgium, where thousands 
died in trenches just before the end of the war. In tribute, poppy 
petals filled the air -- a reference to the poem about the place they 
were buried. "In flanders field the poppies blow, between the crosses 
row on row."
