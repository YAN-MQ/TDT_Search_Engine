More than 200 investors bilked in a futures swindle mobbed China's 
official news agency Wednesday, demanding that the government take 
responsibility and help retrieve their losses. The protesters marched 
to the front gate of the Xinhua News Agency in central Beijing, where 
they were held back by 20 to 30 police officers. Another 50 or so 
people looked on. After about four hours, the number of protesters 
dwindled to about 50 and police moved through the crowd, ordering 
them to disperse, which they did. The protesters, investors in the 
failed Xinguoda Futures Brokerage Co. Ltd., were upset with a Xinhua 
report on the company's collapse because it evaded official responsibility. 
They demanded a new account to pressure the government. A leaflet 
distributed by the protesters noted that Xinhua made no mention of 
alleged investments by the People's Armed Police and Xinguoda's regulatory 
approval by the China's Securities Regulatory Commission, the central 
bank and other agencies. ``Who ought to take responsibility for these 
consequences?'' the leaflet said. ``We believe this report was a prelude 
to allowing these agencies to skillfully escape _ like a cicada sloughing 
off its skin _ and ultimately put the responsibility on the investors,'' 
the leaflet said. The protesters requested a meeting with Premier 
Zhu Rongji and the regulatory agencies to resolve their claims. ``The 
relevant departments are dealing with the matter,'' said Xinhua spokeswoman, 
Xie Dan. Xinguoda's collapse underscores the problems the Chinese 
government has in policing its fledgling, freewheeling free markets. 
Unscrupulous operators have moved into everything from financial securities 
to door-to-door sales, often preying on China's struggling working 
class. Police have arrested the once-missing chairman, Ni Wenliang 
_ a 41-year-old native of central China who lives in Taiwan and carries 
a Belize passport _ and two other accomplices, according to the Xinhua 
report that the protesters questioned. The report gave the following 
details: The three lured investors with promises of high returns and 
conducted trades on a ``fake exchange'' in eastern Shandong province. 
As of Nov. 5, Xinguoda had taken in 532 million yuan (dlrs 64 million) 
from 4,121 investors and paid out 169 million yuan (dlrs 20 million) 
in profits and interest. Police have traced 162 million yuan (dlrs 
19.6 million), some of it invested in cash, cars and property and 
the rest spirited abroad or hidden inside China. That left more than 
200 million yuan (dlrs 24 million) still unaccounted for.
