Iraq's state-run newspapers were full of telegrams of support Wednesday 
for Saddam Hussein in the latest crisis with the United Nations. But 
the official radio and TV made no mention of the surprise evacuation 
of U.N. workers. Many Iraqis said they did not fear a new U.S. military 
strike, adding they could do little about it. Streets were full, and 
there was no sign of people rushing to stock up on food. Hussein Ali 
Kadhim, a vendor in Baghdad's commercial hub of Shorja, said he believed 
most Iraqis were fed up with crises over U.N. arms inspectors and 
hoped a flare-up of hostilities would lead to some change. ``How many 
times will America come and unleash its missiles and go as if nothing 
happened. It must be a game and we the ordinary people do not understand,'' 
said Kadhim. Unlike in past crises, the Iraqi dinar did not dive in 
value, staying steady at 1,750 to the dollar. Grocers also said prices 
were stable despite the realization that a new U.S. missile strike 
could come soon. ``I have not seen anything extraordinary today. It 
is like any other day,'' said grocer Nizar Khalifa. That may be because 
the government is sending a different message this time from that 
in past confrontations with the United Nations. It has not announced 
any measures to ward off a possible military strike, nor has it rationed 
gasoline _ which usually set off runs on filling stations in the past. 
While reports outside Iraq spoke of war preparations _ the London-based 
Al-Zaman newspaper said key military and security headquarters were 
evacuated _ none of this was apparent in Baghdad. In the past, the 
government publicized that it was dismantling factories to protect 
them against attack and sent units of military police into the streets. 
Not this time. Instead there were the messages of support for Saddam 
in newspapers from tribal leaders and trade unions. And although weapons 
inspectors and other U.N. personnel had pulled out by afternoon _ 
giving a possible U.S. attack as the reason _ Iraqi radio and TV still 
had not broadcast the news hours later. Despite a heavy downpour that 
turned Baghdad streets into swamps, all was normal. Shops remained 
open in the market area of Shorja into the evening. Rasheed Avenue, 
Baghdad's main thoroughfare, was congested with cars and pedestrians 
strolled along the colonnaded sidewalk, some drinking tea and others 
looking at shop windows. Residents in Shorja said they were not aware 
the inspectors were pulled out. Nizar Abdulkhalifa noted that the 
United Nations withdrew inspectors in 1997 as well, after Iraq ordered 
the removal of Americans from the team. ``We have passed through this 
before and I personally I am not afraid at all,'' Abdulkhalifa said. 
Salem Jarjees, who sells nylon sheets, said he would open his shop 
on Thursday even if the Americans attacked on Wednesday. ``I hope 
we the civilians will be spared but mind you their so-called smart 
weapons hit residential areas in the past,'' he said.
