Nissan Motor Co., Japan's ailing No. 2 automaker, is negotiating with 
the Japan Development Bank for a loan to help it write off some of 
its high-interest debt. The Kyodo news service reported that the government-backed 
bank would lend Nissan _ which has had difficulty raising money from 
private lenders in the midst of a severe credit squeeze here _ 100 
billion yen, or $823 million, one of the largest loans ever to a single 
company. Nissan confirmed Wednesday that the bank would lend it money 
but said the amount, terms and timing of the loan had not yet been 
determined. Analysts said the loan's importance would depend on the 
specifics, particularly its size. The analysts disagreed over what 
the loan meant in terms of Nissan's financial health, which has been 
shaky for the last several years. Some regarded the company's turn 
to the development bank as a sign of dire financial straits. ``It's 
an undeniable fact that the company is short of cash and wants to 
do anything to accumulate it,'' said Koji Endo of Schroders Securities. 
Nissan is shouldering debt of 4.3 trillion yen, or about $35 billion, 
and is trying to reorganize amid the worst economic downturn since 
World War II. Car sales in Japan fell 14 percent last year and a further 
8 percent in the first half of this year, and Nissan announced Tuesday 
that it expected to post yet another loss for the full fiscal year, 
which ends on March 31. It has also suffered from bloated inventories 
in the United States, some of that caused by supplies of used vehicles 
turned onto the market as leases ended. Nissan had provided heavy 
incentives for Americans to lease, leading to this year's glut. It 
has lost money in six of the last seven years, and Endo thinks that 
company debt ratings will fall to junk-bond status by the end of the 
year because of the expected loss. ``If that happens, there will be 
almost no way they can raise cash,'' he said. But Steve Usher, an 
analyst with Jardine Fleming Securities, cautioned against interpreting 
the negotiations as a sign of desperation. ``The situation Nissan 
is facing at this point would not necessarily imply a cash squeeze,'' 
he said. ``There is a deterioration in its profitability, but virtually 
all companies here are having that deterioration.'' He noted that 
the bulk of the losses announced on Tuesday _ $266 million for the 
six-month period ending on Sept. 30 _ were related to securities Nissan 
holds and were thus largely paper losses. ``They're in a position 
at this point, given their cash flow, to meet their requirements,'' 
he said. Analysts were also puzzled over how the company would get 
around laws stipulating that at least 50 percent of loans from the 
Japan Development Bank be devoted to specific development projects. 
The government has been discussing ways to use the development bank 
to ease the credit squeeze, which has resulted in a record high bankruptcy 
rate and high borrowing costs for even the biggest borrowers. But 
no official plans have been proposed. The Kyodo report said that the 
government and the ruling party were considering ways to make the 
development bank's money available to companies for financing their 
operations and redeeming their debt. Endo said Nissan's borrowing 
costs had sharply risen since August, when Moody's Investors Service 
lowered its credit ratings, which now hover one notch above junk-bond 
status. Its usual lenders, the Industrial Bank of Japan and Fuji Bank, 
have problems of their own and can ill afford to extend further loans 
to the company _ although they can afford its demise even less. The 
company does have access to a credit line of 500 billion yen it obtained 
last month from 10 banks to protect it, should it have difficulties 
raising money. But Nissan's parts suppliers and affiliates are also 
experiencing credit constraints and need its help. Usher said the 
company had increased its borrowing last year and in the first half 
of this year to support its group companies rather than finance its 
own operations.
