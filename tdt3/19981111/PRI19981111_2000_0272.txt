a federal appeals court in Virginia has refused to rehear a case involving 
the federal government's jurisdiction over tobacco. NPR's Debbie Elliot 
reports. The Fourth Circuit Court of Appeals will not reconsider a 
ruling that prevents the Food and Drug Administration from regulating 
cigarettes and other tobacco products like it does drugs. The three-judge 
panel of the Virginia Appellate Court ruled in August that Congress 
did not intend to give FDA jurisdiction over tobacco. The ruling was 
hailed as a victory for tobacco companies who had challenged the agency's 
1986 restrictions on the sale and distribution of cigarettes and smokeless 
tobacco to minors. The FDA wanted the full Fourth Circuit to rehear 
the case, but the Court refused to reconsider. That clears the way 
for the FDA to appeal the ruling to the U.S. Supreme Court. Federal 
officials were not available for comment because of the Veteran's 
Day holiday. Debbie Elliot, NPR News.
