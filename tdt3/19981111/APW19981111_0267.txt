Unemployment in Britain stayed at 4.6 percent for the third consecutive 
month in October, although the number of people claiming welfare rose 
slightly. The government reported Wednesday that the number claiming 
welfare increased by 6,800 to about 1.3 million, partly because of 
fewer students leaving welfare rolls at the end of the summer compared 
with last year. The 4.6 percent unemployment rate, which has held 
steady since August, is the lowest since the summer of 1980. Unemployment 
stood at 4.7 percent in July. The number of people in jobs in Britain 
increased by 124,000 between July and September, the government reported. 
Employment Minister Andrew Smith said the number of full-time employees 
is at its highest level since spring 1981. ``Young people have had 
a better deal in the last 18 months than at any time during the preceding 
18 years,'' Smith said. ``The number of young people claiming benefit 
for more than six months has halved since April 1997, and is now at 
its lowest level since 1976.''
