The world can say hello to a new litter of Bengal Tiger cubs. The 
Australian foursome was born 2 1/2 weeks ago. Today, they made their 
public debut, as they were moved into a new nursery so they can bond 
with their human handlers. They'll go back to their mother in a few 
weeks. Part of what makes the litter special is this cub, which is 
Australia's first white Bengal Tiger.
