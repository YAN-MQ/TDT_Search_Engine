Tonight "the home of the brave." On veterans day. Commemorating when 
world war I came to an end. It was the war to end all wars. But it 
was followed by others. In all of those wars, some of the most eloquent 
thoughts came in letters home, letters collected by Andy Carol in 
a book called "letters of a Nation." World war II, erwin blonder, 
age 23, forward artillery observer in France. A letter to his father 
and brother back in Ohio. "Saturday, September 30, 1944. Dear dad 
and Jerry. As I now write, the guns are booming, sending their missiles 
of death to the enemy. I have experienced and seen things I have never 
dreamed of seeing. I have been in artillery barrages where you sit 
and wait for each shell to burst, waiting for the uncertain future 
to come. I used to be afraid of dead people, but they don't bother 
me anymore. You don't stop to think if it's right of wrong, but know 
the more Germans you kill, the quicker this war will be won." World 
war II. Arizona. Rose price was a teenager when her boyfriend, Wilson, 
sent her a letter from the front. "Dear rose. I know it is pretty 
hard to say this. I really don't know what I mean to you. Why don't 
you just forget me and find someone else. I am not saying this because 
I dislike you. No, that's not it. It's for you. I sure hate to see 
you worrying. You might never see me again the way this war has been 
going." The Vietnam war. John Campbell wrote to a good friend who 
fought next to him and died in vietnam. He wrote it 15 years later. 
"Dear Eddie. I'll never forget being awakened at 3:00 that morning 
by the hysterical crying, 'one of our guys is dead!' I can remember 
demanding an answer. 'oh, god. why? Why any of us? Why Eddie?' for 
years, I have felt your life, as well as the other 58,000 lives, were 
wasted and that anyone who was not there could not or would not understand 
what we went through. That is changing now. People are beginning to 
realize that we were doing our jobs and doing them well. My only thought 
is to get home safely to my wife, so she and I can live our lives 
the way we have always dreamed." "Good-bye and so long. God will care 
for you. Love, price." "I love you, brother. I pray someday we can 
welcome each other home. Peace." A day to remember the veterans of 
all the wars.
