Hormones released during pregnancy and nursing enrich parts of the 
mother's brain involved in learning and memory, a study of animals 
suggests. The findings, released Tuesday at a Society for Neuroscience 
meeting, may help in understanding the effects that higher hormone 
levels have on the brain during childbearing. The results of the study 
of mice, however, are inconsistent with research at the University 
of Southern California indicating that pregnant women perform poorly 
on cognitive tests designed to test memory, perceptual speed and learning 
ability. Some researchers have attributed feelings of fuzzy-mindedness 
among many expectant mothers to emotional stress from pregnancy, which 
provokes higher levels of a hormone called cortisol that interferes 
with memory. The new animal study by neuroscientists at the University 
of Richmond and Randolph Macon College in Virginia suggested that 
a pregnant animal's behavior changes because of a permanent shift 
in the brain. ``We are seeing significant changes,'' said Richmond 
neuropsychologist Craig Kinsley, who conducted the study with Randolph 
Macon psychologist Kelly Lambert. ``Pregnancy, a perfectly natural 
biological experience for the female, appears to mark the brain for 
a lifetime.'' Special brain cell structures called dendrites _ necessary 
for communication between neurons _ doubled in pregnant and nursing 
lab mice, the research indicates. At the same time, the number of 
the brain's glial cells, which act as scaffolding and communication 
conduits, also doubled. The pregnant mice were bolder, more curious 
and energetic. They learned mazes more quickly, made fewer mistakes 
and retained their new knowledge longer. And the effects appeared 
to be long-lasting, researchers found. ``In a way, the brain of a 
late-pregnant female resembles a toy factory at Christmas time, receiving 
orders and gearing up for the increased demands about to be placed 
on it,'' Kinsley said in Tuesday's Los Angeles Times.
