The highest organ of Bulgaria's Orthodox Church removed incumbent 
Patriarch Maxim from his post, church officials announced Wednesday. 
At a two-day extraordinary Convention of Clergy and Laity, aimed to 
overcome the years-long rift that has plagued the church, the 796 
delegates voted unanimously in favour of Maxim's replacement. Maxim 
has no chance to appeal the decision. Priests who attended the convention 
said a patriarch should be elected next January. The delegates were 
not unanimous as to who should head the church prior to election of 
a new primate. The meeting was called by lower-rank clergymen angered 
by the crippling conflict in the church that has disappointed many 
of the faithful in this post-communist country. Since 1991, Bulgaria's 
main church has been split between supporters of Patriarch Maxim, 
who served as church leader under Communist rule, and Pymen, whose 
followers seceded in 1991 and proclaimed him patriarch in 1996. Maxim 
then promptly declared him expelled from the church. But Patriarch 
Maxim and his supporters boycotted the convention, and a statement 
of the Patriarch's office, issued after the meeting, calls its decisions 
``a spiritual coup.'' The statement calls on state leaders ``to reject 
and distance themselves from these unprecedented anticanonical actions 
of the forum for the sake of the unity of the Bulgarian Orthodox Church 
and the unity of the Bulgarian people.'' The convention follows a 
meeting of church leaders of the Orthodox world who gathered last 
month in Sofia. trying to bring together the two feuding wings, but 
the result was just a fragile compromise. The seven year-old power 
struggle has seriously damaged the image of the Orthodox Church and 
prevented it from being a moral authority in post-Communist Bulgaria. 
The vast majority of Bulgaria's 8.5 million people come from an Orthodox 
background, even if they don't practice religion.
