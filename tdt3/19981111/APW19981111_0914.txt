Gunmen who massacred 19 people in a northern Mexican town were employed 
by a drug gang sought by authorities in the United States and Mexico, 
prosecutors say. Gen. Guillermo Alvarez, who coordinates antidrug 
efforts for the Federal Judicial Police, said Tuesday that the gunmen 
have connections to Ramon Arellano Felix, an alleged drug trafficker 
on the FBI's list of 10 most wanted crime suspects. American and Mexican 
officials believe that Arellano Felix and his brothers, based in the 
border city of Tijuana, have killed dozens of people in recent years 
to protect their drug-trafficking empire. On Sept. 17, gunmen rousted 
from bed an alleged drug trafficker and 18 members of his family _ 
including eight children _ and lined them up against a wall and shot 
them near the Baja California beach resort of Ensenada. The gunmen's 
intended target, a Pei Pei Indian named Fermin Castro, died two weeks 
later of complications from two bullet wounds. Three suspects had 
been arrested, said Deputy Attorney General Jose Luis Ramos Rivera. 
Warrants have been issued for 10 others, one of whom may be hiding 
in the United States, he said. Alvarez said the gunmen were members 
of a gang led by a man known as Lino Quintana, who works for Arellano 
Felix. U.S. federal authorities have offered a dlrs 2 million reward 
for information leading to Arellano Felix's arrest. Authorities say 
he and three of his brothers are fugitives who control major routes 
for smuggling cocaine, marijuana and other drugs across the border 
into California. Mexican authorities have sought the brothers since 
1993. Alvarez and federal prosecutors said Quintana's gang killed 
Castro to stop his marijuana-smuggling operation from becoming too 
competitive with theirs. Authorities said they solved the case after 
two people were killed Oct. 29 by gunmen wearing the same military-style 
uniforms as those worn by the gunmen in the massacre near Ensenada. 
Descriptions gathered from survivors of the two attacks led to the 
arrest of Armando Villegas, who said he was present during both killings. 
Villegas directed authorities to a ranch in Rosarito, Baja California, 
where investigators found guns and uniforms allegedly used by the 
gunmen at Ensenada. Alvarez insisted that Mexican soldiers were not 
involved in the Ensenada massacre, as local media have speculated. 
Five soldiers held under house arrest during the investigation have 
been cleared of any involvement in the killings and released, he said.
