Police on Wednesday arrested a deputy train driver and two railway 
officials accused of negligence that led to a train crash that killed 
47 people last month, officials said. The arrest came one day after 
the release of a report that said the accident, in which a train flew 
off its tracks and smashed into a town square in the Nile Delta, was 
caused by human error. The report said the train was speeding and 
that brakes were faulty or missing when it crashed in Kafr el-Dawar, 
30 kilometers (20 miles) southeast of the port city of Alexandria. 
Police arrested the train's assistant driver, Hosni Mohammed Abdel-Latif, 
and two railway officials in the town, Hamdi Ibrahim Faqr and Mohammed 
Sayed Ibrahim, police officials said. Following the accident, the 
government suspended five top railway officials, including the national 
head of railways and the managers in the province where the accident 
occurred.
