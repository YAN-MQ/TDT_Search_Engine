The U.S. diplomat leading an effort to carry out a peace deal in Kosovo 
declared Wednesday that the mission may be the last chance to avert 
more violence in the restive province. The diplomat, William Walker 
traveled the Pristina, the provincial capital to plan the startup 
of the mission of 2,000 verifiers appointed by Europe's security and 
human rights watchdog. Walker said he was hopeful that inspectors 
from the Organization for Security and Cooperation in Europe can create 
a climate for the people of Kosovo ``to choose the way of moderation, 
the way of sanity, the way of peaceful resolution.'' Serb forces in 
February launched a crackdown on ethnic Albanian separatists fighting 
for independence for Kosovo, which is 90 percent ethnic Albanian. 
Hundreds have died. As many as 300,000 have been driven from their 
homes in the province in southern Serbia, the dominant republic of 
Yugoslavia. Violence continues despite an Oct. 12 peace deal, in which 
Yugoslav President Slobodan Milosevic agreed to sharply reduce his 
forces. Several incidents have been reported since then. Both sides 
claim self-defense. Three Serb policemen were wounded Tuesday night 
in Glogovac, 20 miles (30 kilometers) west of Pristina, when ethnic 
Albanians attacked a police station, the pro-government Serbian Media 
Center in Pristina reported. NATO expressed concern about the surge 
in violence in Kosovo and condemned the increasing number of incidents, 
alliance officials said Wednesday. While the situation on the ground 
is better than it was prior to the agreement, alliance officials speaking 
on condition of anonymity said they are worried that tit-for-tat attacks 
could rekindle the fighting that originally broke out in February. 
Unwilling to blame either side, one NATO official said Serb special 
police forces maintain a heavy presence in some sensitive areas of 
the province and that it was clear the KLA has been trying to exploit 
the situation and making provocative attacks. Nonetheless, the official 
stressed, the Serbs are still largely in compliance with the agreement 
struck by Milosevic and U.S. envoy Richard Holbrooke. Walker said 
his ambitious mission ever ``might be the last, best chance to avert 
an irrational spiral of more violence, more human suffering.''
