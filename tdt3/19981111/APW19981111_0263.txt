The government's chronic debt problems kept some schools closed in 
Russia's Far East because they lack heat, and wage arrears also prompted 
several protests in the region Wednesday. In Vladivostok, the main 
city on Russia's east coast, authorities have shut several schools 
or reduced the duration of classes because of the energy shortage. 
Alevtina Belik, the local education chief, said it was the first time 
in memory that schools had not received heat before the arrival of 
the first snows, the ITAR-Tass news agency said. In the eastern Siberian 
region of Buryatia, an unpaid worker shot himself to death while 200 
of his colleagues digging a railway tunnel continued their underground 
strike that started more than a week ago. Nikolai Zaigrayev, who was 
taking part in the protest, came to the surface and fatally shot himself, 
the ITAR-Tass news agency reported, quoting local officials. His fellow 
workers remained in the 15-kilometer (nine-mile) tunnel near the town 
of Severomuisk, close to the Lake Baikal, about 4,400 kilometers (2,700 
miles) southeast of Moscow. They were demanding that the government 
pay off its seven-month wage debt. Meanwhile, about 120 workers at 
an aircraft plant in the eastern city of Ulan-Ude also launched a 
protest over back wages, claiming that they haven't been paid in 15 
months, ITAR-Tass said. Millions of Russians nationwide have gone 
without pay for months, the result of the government's inability to 
collect taxes. The situation has grown worse since an economic crisis 
hit in August.
