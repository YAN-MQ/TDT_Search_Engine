What was Simpson have to say about all of this. He talked at length 
with MSNBC's Chris jansling and here is some of what he had to say. 
I think the kids are doing fabulously well. I don't anybody expected 
them to be doing as well as they're doing. To me that justifies all 
those court-appointed therapists who I'm forced to pay with no money. 
Who all came to the same decision two years ago, all of them caucasian, 
I hate so point out, because the first trial was supposed to be a 
black decision, all of them, no matter what they thought about me 
going in. When they looked into my profile through all their tests, 
they all unanimously, unanimously came to the same conclusion, the 
kids are better off with their father. And the last two years have 
proven it. My kids are active in their school activities here. They 
have a lot of friends. Both of them are active on school teams. I 
go to all the games. We eat out at least two or three nights a week. 
And our life is as normal as any kid can be under these circumstances. 
And if you were to see us, we don't look any different than anyone. 
O.J. Simpson tonight on msnbc99 MSNBC.
