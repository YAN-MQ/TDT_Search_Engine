Those recent mideast peace talks in Maryland nearly brought about 
the resignation of CIA director George tenant. "The New York Times" 
reports, tenant threatened to quit if president clinton agreed to 
release convicted spy Jonathan pollard. Israeli prime minister Netanyahu 
claimed pollard's release would help him gain support back home for 
the wye river accords. Tenant insisted the move would destroy his 
credibility in the agency. Mr. Clinton declined to release pollard, 
but agreed to review the case.
