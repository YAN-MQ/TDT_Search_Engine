To an every day activity that turns out to be a "fleecing of America." 
Have you ever called directory assistance to get a telephone number 
and found you got the wrong number. It turns out that even when you 
get that bad information, it costs you. Here's NBC's Fred Francis. 
You would think that Phyllis pazen's class reunion business would 
rely on finding people through long distance information. It doesn't. 
I'm trying to locate dorothy fleshman. Do I have the right number? 
In fact, the wrong number is given to an estimated 1 million callers 
a day. That's as much as 15% of all long distance directory assistance 
calls, costing consumers $250 million a year. I called for a name 
and a telephone number of someone that I knew was listed and was told 
that there was no number. No listing. More than 6 million times a 
day, someone calls an area code and 555-1212 for a long distance number. 
That is an incorrect number. Let me see if I can get a correct number 
for you. The problem -- some long distance companies giants like AT&T 
want you to deal only with them so they can make money on both your 
information query and your subsequent call. We and the local companies 
are in competition for each other's customers, so it made sense to 
us to offer our own competitive service. The long distance carriers, 
the locals say, could solve the problem. They have this opportunity 
to go right to the local companies and buy those names and they can 
be regularly updated for just pennies. But companies say the locals 
are charging too much and AT&T insists its lists are very accurate. 
The result -- people like Phyllis pazen get not only frustrated, but 
fleeced. It's just an annoyance. It takes time, which none of us have. 
And it's only 75 cents a call, on average, so few people realize that, 
call by call, it adds up to a long distance "fleecing of America."
