Simultaneous police raids across the island of St. Croix netted 23 
drug suspects, authorities said Wednesday. Police said three minors 
were among those arrested during the raids at housing projects and 
drug-selling points on Monday. Some of the arrests had been planned 
for months, with police spending more than dlrs 1,800 on drug buys 
and sting operations, police commissioner Ramon Davila said. The defendants 
face charges ranging from drug trafficking to drug use. Authorities 
confiscated an unspecified amount of cocaine and crack cocaine, Davila 
said. Agents from the Federal Bureau of Investigation, the U.S. Drug 
Enforcement Agency and the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco and Firearms 
aided in the raids, police said.
