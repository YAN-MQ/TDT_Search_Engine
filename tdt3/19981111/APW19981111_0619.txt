After receiving no attractive offers for its Thai exploration and 
production subsidiary, Shell announced Wednesday that it had decided 
to retain its interest in the company. The subsidiary operates an 
offshore concession in the Gulf of Thailand and an onshore concession. 
``While we received considerable interest following our announcement 
last February to approach the market, Shell has not been able to secure 
an offer in line with our expectations,'' Thai Shell Executive Director 
Martin Bradshaw said in a statement. Thai Shell reported a 50 percent 
increase in onshore oil reserves over the last year, and said total 
oil production has risen to more than 24,000 barrels of crude oil 
a day. The Anglo-Dutch petroleum giant's branch in Thailand forecast 
similar production levels in coming years. ``We have consistently 
maintained that if we did not receive the right offer from the right 
buyer we would be happy to continue to own and operate (the local 
subsidiary),'' Bradshaw said.
