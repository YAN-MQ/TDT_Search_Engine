Catherine, back to you. Thanks, Valerie. "CNN Headline Sports" coming 
your way next. A lot of financial companies can make you feel awfully 
small and unimportant. I was hoping to get some... down the hall. 
Ask her. Do you have an appointment? Can you come back... excuse me, 
I was wondering... I'm sorry, I can't help you. But you won't feel 
that way talking to a MetLife financial professional. You'll get personal, 
face-to-face advice and information on mutual funds and annuities, 
as well as insurance. And no matter what size your portfolio, you'll 
have a friend for life.
