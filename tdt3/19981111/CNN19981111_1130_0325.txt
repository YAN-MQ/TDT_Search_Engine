The first winter storm of the season has moved north into Canada, 
but winds in the Great Lakes area are still gusting at 60 miles an 
hour. The winds, ice and snow brought down power lines, leaving thousands 
of people in at least six states without electricity. At the peak 
of the storm, blizzard conditions closed hundreds of miles of interstate 
highways. At least seven storm-related deaths are reported.
