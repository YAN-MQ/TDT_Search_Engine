Syrian dissident Nizar Nayouf could die in a Syrian jail unless his 
government relents and allows him immediate medical attention, a Copenhagen-based 
human rights group said Wednesday. The 36-year-old journalist, writer 
and activist is serving a 10-year jail sentence in Syria for ``practicing 
his internationally recognized right to free expression,'' the Euro-Mediterranean 
Human Rights Network said in a statement said. The group claimed that 
Syrian authorities have refused medical treatment for Nayouf ``unless 
he pledges to refrain for political activities and renounces alleged 
'false statements' he made about the human rights situation in Syria.'' 
``He may die unless he receives immediate treatment for Hodgkin's 
disease, a form of cancer that can be cured with proper treatment,'' 
said group, which also asked to be allowed to visit Nayouf in jail. 
Nayouf was a founding member of the Committee for the Defense of Democratic 
Freedoms and Human Rights in Syria, according to an earlier statement 
by the New York-based Human Rights Watch. Nayouf was arrested in January 
1992 as part of a Syrian government crackdown on the country's nascent 
human rights movement. Three months later, he was sentenced by the 
Supreme State Security Court to 10 years in prison and has been incarcerated 
at the Mezze military prison in the Syrian capital Damascus, Human 
Rights Watch recently said.
