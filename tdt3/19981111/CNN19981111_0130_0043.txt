From the northern plains to the northern Mississippi valley, people 
are feeling the fury of the season's first major snowstorm. Tens of 
thousands of people are without electricity after strong winds and 
heavy snowfall knocked down power lines across the region. The storm 
also is making for treacherous road conditions. Hundreds of miles 
of highway have been closed from Nebraska to Minnesota, as have schools 
across the region. At least two storm-related deaths are reported. 
In Chicago, the winds and rain are weakening. Utility crews battled 
all day Tuesday against the gusts, some as strong as 65 miles an hour. 
Some airlines canceled morning flights at O'hare and Midway airports. 
The storm has already dumped up to two feet of snow in the Rockies, 
knocking out power for thousands of people in Colorado and New Mexico. 
Outages are reported from Nebraska and South Dakota, into Illinois 
and arkansas. Officials in the dakotas say there are hundreds of stranded 
vehicles along the interstate, and people are being warned to stay 
off the roads.
