Like children elbowing one another for their parents' attention, Hollywood 
studios are vying for the holiday box office. The number of films 
targeting family audiences has set off the most intense competition 
among studios in years. The first wave _ two animated films, ``The 
Rugrats Movie'' and ``A Bug's Life,'' and the sequel ``Babe: Pig in 
the City'' _ will open around Thanksgiving. Even seasoned Hollywood 
veterans are bracing for the worst. ``At first, much of the family 
audience will go to all three films,'' predicted Joe Roth, chairman 
of Walt Disney Studios, which is releasing ``A Bug's Life.'' ``But 
after that, it will come down to who has the highest-quality film.'' 
Come December, the second wave of family films bows: the animated 
Bible story ``The Prince of Egypt,'' the live-action and puppetry 
drama ``Jack Frost'' and the special-effects drama ``Mighty Joe Young.'' 
By the middle of the month, studios will be scrambling to retain theater 
bookings for pictures released at Thanksgiving. For films shouldering 
heavy budgets, holding on to screens over the holiday period could 
make the difference between profit and loss. Complicating things this 
year is an unprecedented number of animated films. ``It's a car wreck 
waiting to happen,'' said Terry Press, the Dreamworks executive marketing 
``The Prince of Egypt'' for a Dec. 18 release. ``The only question 
is, who will drive their car into the other car first?'' Universal 
Pictures' chairman and chief executive, Casey Silver, said, ``It will 
be survival of the fittest.'' Richie Fay, president of marketing for 
the AMC Theaters chain, based in Kansas City, Mo., concurs. ``It's 
going to be tough,'' he said. ``What it really comes down to is how 
they market these films.'' Executives at Paramount are trying to start 
a franchise with their ``Rug-rats Movie,'' hoping to expand beyond 
its Nickelodeon audience. To that end, artists like Mark Mothersbaugh 
of Devo and Jakob Dylan perform on the soundtrack. A ``Rugrats'' music 
video is also in heavy rotation on MTV, which is owned by Viacom, 
the parent company of Paramount and Nickelodeon. Similarly, Warner 
Brothers wants to attract teen-agers by using the rock group Hanson 
on its ``Jack Frost'' soundtrack. In the movie, which features Jim 
Henson puppets, Michael Keaton plays a musician who gets a second 
chance to prove himself as a father. Two of the three Thanksgiving 
films have enlisted help from corporate America. Paramount Pictures 
has signed with Burger King, Lincoln-Mercury, Post Cereal and others 
for promotions that will add approximately $50 million in advertising 
to the ``Rugrats'' campaign. Disney's marketing machine is selling 
``A Bug's Life'' as another ``Toy Story,'' helped by $50 million from 
promotional partners led by McDonald's. Universal Pictures is taking 
a different tack with ``Babe,'' betting that the original film's audience 
will turn out again for the sequel. As Silver puts it: ``You can't 
really have a fast-food partner when you're selling a film about a 
pig.'' Instead, Universal is joining with theater owners to sell ``Babe'' 
plush toys with the popcorn and soda. The offer is enticing for theater 
owners, who generate most of their income from concession sales. Another 
battle front is in theater lobbies. Paramount is asking theaters to 
participate in a contest that entails parking 15{-foot Mercury Villager 
vans inside. And Dreamworks' elaborate ``Prince of Egypt'' display 
includes a 50-inch DVD monitor. ``We're literally running out of space,'' 
said one theater executive, who spoke on condition of anonymity. Shoppers, 
meanwhile, will see less movie-based merchandise in stores. ``Retailers 
are being far more selective because they've gotten burned over the 
years by the studios,'' said Ira Mayer, publisher of The Licensing 
Letter. So far, ``Rugrats'' seems to be generating the most interest, 
said Michael Patrick, president of Carmike Cinemas in Columbus, Ga., 
the nation's third largest theater chain. ``We've been getting calls 
from our customers asking for `Rugrats' since early October,'' he 
said. Patrick also expects ``A Bug's Life'' to do well. ``Disney's 
advantage is that their pictures are parent-friendly,'' he said. ``Parents 
don't dread sitting in a theater for an hour and a half on Disney's 
family films like they did with Barney.'' ``The Prince of Egypt,'' 
which does not lend itself to toys or promotional partners, recently 
embarked on a retail promotion with Wal-Mart. Asked how Dreamworks 
expected to compete in such a crowded marketplace, one of the company's 
principals, Jeffrey Katzenberg, said, ``I'm counting on the hope that 
Someone up there has a bigger agenda for the movie than me.''
