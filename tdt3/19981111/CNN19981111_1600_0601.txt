A train derailment in Ohio has shut down a major midwest rail route. 
The train derailed off a bridge, sending 13 cars into sandusky bay 
and three dozen others are blocking the tracks. No one was hurt and 
the train wasn't carrying any hazardous materials. Officials believe 
the strong crosswinds above the bridge blew the train off the tracks. 
The bridge, which connects Erie and Ottawa counties, is a main rail 
line between Chicago and the east coast.
