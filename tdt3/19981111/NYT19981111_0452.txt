Monsanto Co., which for the last few years has aggressively pushed 
into biotechnology and pharmaceuticals, said Wednesday that it planned 
to raise about $5 billion by restructuring its operations, reducing 
its work force as much as 9 percent, or 2,500 jobs, and selling additional 
shares to the public. The company said that the plan, which comes 
just a month after its failed merger with American Home Products, 
a giant pharmaceutical producer with large reserves of cash, is expected 
to help finance Monsanto's recent acquisitions of a number of large 
seed businesses and prepare the company to develop a number of promising 
new products. Monsanto announced the plan after the close of trading 
on the New York Stock Exchange on Wednesday, where its shares closed 
at $38.6875, down 50 cents. But Wall Street analysts say that without 
the American Home Products deal, which some think broke down because 
of a dispute over who would run the new company, Monsanto found itself 
in desperate need of cash. ``They paid big bucks for their seed businesses, 
and they also have a lot of drug products in the pipeline,'' said 
Richard O'Reilly, an analyst with the Standard &AMP; Poor's Equity 
Group. ``Right now, they have a lot on their plate, and so they have 
to pay some of the bill until the drug pipeline comes to fruition.'' 
Executives at Monsanto evidently agree. ``What it really means for 
the company is that we will get the financing issues behind us and 
we can focus our energies on bringing the pharmaceutical pipeline 
and the agricultural and biotechnology products to the market,'' said 
Gary Crittenden, chief financial officer at Monsanto, which is based 
in St. Louis. ``We are on the brink of launching one of the largest 
pharmaceutical products of all time.'' That product, Celebrex, has 
been described by Monsanto as a promising new arthritis drug, which 
is under review by the Food and Drug Administration. It is also a 
symbol of the new path that Monsanto has taken in recent years, shifting 
its focus from the chemicals business, which tended to be cyclical, 
to the high-growth pharmaceutical and futuristic biotechnology businesses. 
That shift has sent shares of Monsanto soaring in recent years, more 
than tripling in worth. And the deal with American Home Products, 
which analysts expected to benefit both companies, seemed to have 
offered a solution to backing Monsanto's huge bet on what it calls 
the ``life sciences'' business _ an approach to integrating the businesses 
of agriculture, health care and nutrition. The life sciences business, 
the company says, is creating more efficient crop yields, cotton that 
can be protected against insects and healthier foods. But Wall Street 
analysts say that without American Home Products, Monsanto found itself 
without the cash required, particularly after it made huge investments 
in the seed and biotechnology business. In the last year, Monsanto 
has spent more than $8 billion on the seed business, including the 
acquisition in June of Cargill Co.'s international seed business. 
Some deals are still pending. The company recently announced plans 
to acquire the 60 percent of DeKalb Genetics Corp. of DeKalb, Ill., 
that it does not already own for $2.3 billion. DeKalb is one of the 
nation's largest seed-corn companies. Monsanto's other big seed deal, 
valued at $1.9 billion, is a proposal to buy Delta and Pine Land Co., 
the largest domestic cotton-seed producer. ``They have a lot of opportunities, 
but they need cash,'' said Timothy Meyer, an analyst with Equity Advisers 
in Chicago. ``So their first choice was American Home Products, which 
is a cash cow. But if they're not going to get it, they're going to 
have to go to the public markets. But it's good; it relieves a lot 
of uncertainty.'' According to the plan announced Wednesday, Monsanto 
would issue about $1 billion in new common stock, about $500 million 
in debt that is convertible into stock, $2.5 billion in long-term 
debt, and about $1 billion from the sale or divestiture of some of 
its assets. The company also plans to restructure its operations in 
ways that will eliminate as many as 1,000 of its more than 28,000 
jobs, and cut as many as 1,500 more through the sale of assets. By 
1999, Monsanto expects administrative costs to be reduced by 20 percent. 
But marketing and technology spending will rise as it brings products 
to market, and hopes to move aggressively into new biotechnology ventures. 
``The actions today continue a long-term process,'' Monsanto chairman 
and chief executive Robert Shapiro said in a statement. ``From 1992 
to 1995, we developed our strategy to transform Monsanto into a leading 
life sciences company. From 1995 to the present, we've been putting 
together the resources and capabilities _ business portfolio, people, 
technologies and infrastructure _ to carry out that strategy.''
