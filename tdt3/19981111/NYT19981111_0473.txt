Rep. Bill Thomas, R-Calif., has decided not to enter the race for 
House majority leader, the No. 2 leadership position, leaving three 
candidates to battle it out. Aides to Thomas said he would support 
Rep. Dick Armey of Texas, the current majority leader. Armey is fending 
off challenges from Rep. Steve Largent of Oklahoma and Rep. Jennifer 
Dunn of Washington. Several Republican handicappers said Wednesday 
that while Armey might so far have an advantage in commitments for 
the Nov. 18 secret-ballot election, he had not yet achieved a dominance 
that would allow him to claim victory in the initial round of voting.
