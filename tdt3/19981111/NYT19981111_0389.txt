The campaign to succeed Rep. Newt Gingrich as the congressman from 
Georgia's 6th Congressional District began taking shape Wednesday 
as Johnny Isakson, the chairman of the state school board and a fixture 
in state Republican politics, announced his candidacy and instantly 
became the presumptive front-runner. Among other political assets, 
Isakson, 53, has the blessing of the outgoing House speaker, who issued 
a statement Tuesday encouraging him to run. ``He is a very close personal 
friend,'' Gingrich said, ``and I believe he would do a great job of 
representing Georgia's 6th District.'' Gingrich announced last Friday 
that he would step down from the speakership and resign his House 
seat because of Republican losses in last week's elections. The party 
lost five seats in the House, and, counting Gingrich, now holds 223 
seats to the Democrats' 211 and one independent. The Republican majority 
is six. Isakson's announcement is likely to keep some prospective 
Republican candidates out of the race. State Republican chairman Russell 
Paul said Wednesday that he would no longer consider running and joined 
other party leaders in the district in handicapping Isakson as a heavy 
favorite. The 6th District, which spans an arc of affluent suburbs 
north of Atlanta, is considered one of the most Republican congressional 
districts in the nation. Its politics are driven primarily by economic 
conservatism, but social issues also play a role and that could cause 
problems for Isakson. He is a social moderate who took the unusual 
step of highlighting his support for abortion rights during a Republican 
primary campaign for the U.S. Senate two years ago, alienating many 
religious conservatives. Paul said Isakson had already started to 
repair that damage by contacting Christian conservative leaders. ``He 
won't make them all happy,'' Paul said, ``but he's working to shore 
up his right flank.'' In his announcement in the Marietta town square, 
Isakson emphasized his Republican credentials, saying he and Gingrich 
``were Republicans when Republican wasn't very cool.'' A real estate 
executive, Isakson has served in the state General Assembly and run 
two unsuccessful statewide races, for governor in 1990 and for the 
U.S. Senate in 1996. Isakson focused his remarks Wednesday on economic 
issues; he but did not mention social ones. ``I believe in the principles 
of economic conservatism,'' he said. ``I believe in the principles 
of local control. And I believe in a manageable government that takes 
less out of the pockets of the taxpayers and enlightens the life of 
all of us.'' One social conservative, state Rep. Mitchell Adam Kaye, 
a Republican who gained national attention this year for proposing 
that teachers be allowed to carry guns in schools, has said he will 
run against Isakson. Several others are still considering their options. 
On the Democratic side, Michael Coles, an entrepreneur and former 
state party chairman who lost a campaign for the U.S. Senate last 
week, is considering entering the race. Because Gingrich has yet to 
formally notify Gov. Zell Miller of his resignation, no date has been 
set for a special election to fill his seat. It also remains unclear 
whether the election would be nonpartisan, with Democrats and Republicans 
running together, or whether a general election would be preceded 
by party primaries. Some Democratic officials said Wednesday that 
they would like to see partisan primaries because Isakson might be 
challenged from the right. Although the district is considered strong 
Republican turf, the Democrats believe they have a chance to win in 
a race against an extreme social conservative. ``The district can 
be won with the right combination of Republican candidates,'' said 
state Democratic chairman David Worley. ``There's a real possibility 
that the Republicans will choose as their leading candidate a radical 
nut, for lack of a better term.''
