several stipulations to the land-for-security agreement that could

a slim majority of the 17 ministers approves the accord, as is expected, 
by Wednesday evening, parliament could begin its debate on Monday 
and hold a vote by Tuesday. Despite the renewed ratification efforts, 
a Netanyahu adviser said it was unlikely Israel would meet its first

not take place until parliament has approved the deal. In a new possible 
snag, Israel radio quoted Netanyahu as telling the ministers that 
the Cabinet would be asked to approve each stage of the 12-week agreement
