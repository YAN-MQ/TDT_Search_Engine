Central American leaders held a summit Monday to coordinate efforts 
to rebuild their countries in the wake of hurricane Mitch. Lucia Newman 
looks at how those who survived are dealing with the misery. Wylie 
Wooten, a fireman who's been recovering the bodies of the victims 
of hurricane Mitch all week, wades into this house following reports 
that a corpse floated in and is trapped inside. A particularly difficult 
entry, because this was his house. Keep going. Keep going. You got 
it. Wooten finds no one but does recover something of strong sentimental 
value. One of my mother's Flowers. Wooten was lucky. At least all 
his relatives in the house survived. The house was built by my grandmother 
in 1929. And my mother grew up here, I grew up here. What can I tell 
you? It's -- you know, it's -- it's hard. It's difficult for everyone 
hit by the hurricane. But especially those who are losing hope of 
ever finding their missing loved ones as the task becomes more difficult. 
It's very hard. Especially when you have the surviving members there. 
You know, begging us to get their family out. And it's impossible. 
As you can see, I mean, the street, if you see the water level there, 
that water level is probably four feet right now. The sanitary emergency, 
the health hazards are growing by the day, and the problem is not 
just physical. People who have lost their homes, their jobs, are feeling 
the psychological impact. "We have headaches, our brain hurts, because 
more than anything, we feel traumatized," says this woman who's waiting 
to see the doctor. Here, at this semi-destroyed marketplace, a team 
of Cuban doctors has set up an emergency clinic to attend to patients, 
many of whom are suffering from hypertension caused by stress. "They've 
lived through very difficult times," says the doctor, "and their life 
will continue to be very difficult because of the hurricane." There's 
no consolation. No one can tell people here when life might even approach 
normality. Lucia Newman, CNN, Honduras.
