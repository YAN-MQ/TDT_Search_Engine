And in other political news, coming out of Washington, U.S. Justice 
Department officials have questioned President Clinton as a part of 
their probe into the Democratic Party's campaign financing practices. 
The questioning yesterday was part of a preliminary investigation 
into whether the Democrats misused money that had been allocated for 
political advertising during the 1996 election campaign. U.S. Attorney 
General Janet Reno is to determine by early December whether an independent 
counsel should be appointed to probe the matter further.
