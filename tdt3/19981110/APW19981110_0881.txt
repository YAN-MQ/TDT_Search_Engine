Palestinian leader Yasser Arafat on Tuesday invited Queen Elizabeth 
II and Prince Philip to visit the Palestinian areas in honor of the 
millennium. Arafat delivered the invitation during a meeting with 
Britain's Duke of Kent, a cousin of the queen, who is on a three-day 
trade mission to Israel and the autonomous Palestinian areas. Arafat 
said in his halting English that he asked the duke to ``make a favor, 
to carry my best regards and thanks from my heart to her majesty.'' 
The Palestinian leader said he has invited the queen and her husband 
``for the 2000 celebrations'' in the Holy Land. The Palestinians hope 
to attract a large number of tourists to the festivities, especially 
in Palestinian-run Bethlehem, the traditional birthplace of Jesus. 
The duke said that he knew of no plans by the queen to visit.
