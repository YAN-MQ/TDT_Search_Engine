And here in the United States, outgoing speaker of the U.S. House 
of Representatives Newt Gingrich has endorsed his likely successor, 
Louisiana Congressman Bob Livingston. And Mr. Gingrich urged the Republican 
Party to unite behind him. Addressing loyalists at a Washington D.C. 
dinner Monday night, Mr. Gingrich said he decided to retire because 
his presence had become an excuse for Republican divisiveness. He 
also indicated that he has no plans to seek future public office. 
Mr. Gingrich's decision to step down came after last week's election 
which cost the Republicans five seats in the House.
