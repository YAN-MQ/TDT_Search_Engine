For years, Justin G. Schiller, a New York dealer in children's books, 
was certain that he knew most everything about the publishing history 
of ``Alice in Wonderland.'' The story had intrigued him since childhood, 
and so in 1960 when he became a bookseller while still in high school, 
he began buying and selling early printings of the book. Then, in 
1974, he became a founding member of a collectors' group, the Lewis 
Carroll Society of North America. In 1980, he bought a rare copy of 
the first edition of ``Alice,'' printed in 1865 by Clarendon Press 
at Oxford University, an edition that had been suppressed when Carroll, 
the pseudonym used by Charles Lutwidge Dodgson, and John Tenniel, 
the illustrator, found imperfections in the printing. Schiller had 
seen the book once in an exhibition but had never had a chance to 
inspect it closely until then. ``When I finally had the book in my 
hands, I was puzzled by the purple ink markings of circles, lines 
and a few word changes, seen throughout the text,'' he said. ``Long 
identified as Lewis Carroll's copy, bibliographers studied the book 
and assumed that the markings were the changes Carroll had in mind 
for the second edition and later printings.'' Schiller was dismayed 
to find that the changes were not included in the second edition, 
which was published in London in October 1865 but dated 1866, or in 
later printings. Even more perplexing was the color of the ink in 
the markings. ``Lewis Carroll did not begin using purple ink until 
1870,'' Schiller said. ``That's when Christ Church Oxford gave him, 
and all members of the faculty, purple ink to use to mark students' 
papers.'' The mystery notwithstanding, he now owned what for him was 
his greatest treasure. He had been willing to pay $200,000 _ his entire 
savings _ for the book, but he was luckily able to buy it at an auction 
in Paris for $56,000. Of the original 48 copies of the first edition, 
23 survive, 16 of them in libraries. But none of the other copies 
is as distinctive as the one Schiller bought: it includes 10 of the 
work's original pencil drawings by Tenniel, each of which is signed 
with his monogram. The drawings were combined with the marked pages 
when they were bound as a book for the first time in 1899. Another 
uncommon aspect of the book is that the pages were left untrimmed 
and never gilded. Because of the purple ink, Schiller was convinced 
that Carroll was not responsible for the markings. In a monograph 
that he published privately in 1990, Schiller wrote, ``Since 1928, 
these markings have been misattributed as being in Lewis Carroll's 
handwriting.'' Curiously, a footnote in the monograph provided a clue 
that just a month ago helped solve the mystery, when the book was 
being prepared to be auctioned at Christie's in New York on Dec. 9. 
``What happened to Alice in the story happened to me,'' Schiller said. 
``Alice prides herself on being logical. She looks at the evidence 
directly in front of her and confronts it head on; she then follows 
the road of logical assumptions, making twists and turns and getting 
lost along the way, to an ultimate conclusion. I did this too, using 
the evidence of the date that the book was published, the aspect of 
the purple ink and the advice of bibliographers. However, I ignored 
other possibilities and came to a narrow conclusion that was all wrong.'' 
In July, Francis Wahlgren, who heads the books and manuscript department 
at Christie's, suggested to Schiller that he auction his copy of ``Alice'' 
this year, during the centenary of Carroll's death while the market 
was hot for his books. Another 1865 copy of ``Alice'' was sold privately 
a year ago for about $800,000, to a collector, John Lindseth, a Cleveland 
industrialist. He included it in an exhibition of his Lewis Carroll 
collection at the Grolier Club last spring. Wahlgren added another 
inducement: ``Alice'' could become the last book sold at Christie's 
Park Avenue before the auction house moved to Rockefeller Center next 
year. Schiller agreed. The price expected is between $1.5 million 
to $2 million. The day before the catalogue went to press, Wahlgren 
decided to check the footnote on Carroll in Schiller's monograph. 
``My instinct told me that Schiller's explanation for the purple markings 
did not add up,'' Wahlgren said. ``So I went to the Morgan Library 
to check whether the information was correct in a footnote to a 1956 
article, that Schiller had cited in his book.'' In the footnote, William 
H. Bond, a curator who became the librarian at the Houghton Library 
at Harvard University, wrote that the purple-ink markings in ``Alice'' 
were made by Carroll ``possibly in preparation for `The Nursery Alice,' 
'' the version for very young children published in 1889. (Schiller 
said that he had underestimated the importance of that statement because 
of the word possibly.) Wahlgren found that the changes suggested by 
the markings corresponded almost perfectly to the text of the ``Nursery 
Alice.'' ``Francis became my White Rabbit,'' Schiller said. ``He retraced 
my steps but then took another path and solved the mystery of the 
purple ink markings. Whenever Alice was lost, she followed White Rabbit 
and found her way.''
