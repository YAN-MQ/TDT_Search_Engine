Hundreds of civilians have fled their homes in diamond-rich southeastern 
Sierra Leone to avoid heavy fighting between rebel forces and a pro-government 
militia, a military spokesman said Tuesday. Fighting began Monday 
and heavy gunfire continued to echo through the streets of Tongo Field, 
about 350 kilometers (220 miles) east of the capital, Freetown, the 
spokesman said. Rebels forces and their allies from Sierra Leone's 
ousted military regime were battling with a civil defense force militia 
backed by West African intervention force soldiers. A Nigerian-led 
West African coalition force, known as ECOMOG, has been fighting on 
behalf of President Ahmed Tejan Kabbah since February. ECOMOG troops 
drove Sierra Leone's military junta from power to clear the way for 
Kabbah's return to power. Kabbah himself was ousted from power in 
a May 1997 coup. Although Kabbah and the ECOMOG force are firmly in 
control of the capital, rebels forces still control parts of the country 
and have been waging a terrorist campaign against the civilian population. 
ECOMOG spokesman, Squadron Leader Paul Aghimen, said the latest fighting 
was centered around Tongo Field and the nearby town of Samia, in the 
heart of Sierra Leone's diamond belt. There were no immediate reports 
on casualties, Aghimen said.
