Thirty-five players are scheduled to attend a strategy meeting Wednesday 
in New York to decide whether to present a new proposal to the owners. 
Among several economic issues, the league and union are deciding how 
to divide the $2 billion in annual revenues. The players, who received 
57 percent last season in salaries, want 60 percent. The league is 
offering a 50-50 split. Both figures are said to be negotiable, though 
neither the players nor the owners have moved off those figures in 
two weeks. If a labor agreement were signed this week (highly unlikely), 
the earliest the season could start would be Dec. 15. If the more 
than 4-month-old lockout has taken its toll on teams and fans, it 
has also cost the players. More than 200 of the league's players under 
contract are scheduled to lose their first paychecks on Sunday. For 
the union president, Patrick Ewing, whose $18.5 million annual salary 
is the highest in the National Basketball Association, the first two 
weeks will cost him nearly $1.5 million. The union issued some relief 
last Friday, releasing $20,000 group-licensing checks to many of its 
members.
