On Day 2 of Frank Cashen's temporary return as general manger, the 
Mets didn't make any moves, but they apparently have been focusing 
on free agent B.J. Surhoff, the Baltimore Orioles' left fielder last 
season. Tuesday morning, Greg Clifton, Surhoff's agent, said that 
he had held in-depth discussions with Steve Phillips before Phillips' 
leave of absence went into effect on Sunday; since then, Clifton said 
he had not heard from the Mets. Clifton said he did not see that as 
a negative, however, and was anticipating that the Mets would be in 
contact with him soon. Cashen, speaking from the National League general 
managers meeting in Naples, Fla., said Tuesday that he had not talked 
to Clifton yet. ``But he called here today and one of our guys talked 
to him.'' Cashen said that Surhoff ``seems to be interested in playing 
in New York. And we're interested in talking to him.'' The Mets vice 
president David Howard said that he, Cashen and the rest of the Mets' 
personnel team went through a hectic day of meetings as Cashen attempted 
to pull together a front office shaken by Phillips' sudden departure 
following an allegation of sexual harassment from a former Mets employee. 
The agent for Mike Piazza said he hoped that Phillips would get his 
job back. ``We'd like to see him back as general manager,'' the agent, 
Dan Lozano, said Tuesday. ``Steve sold us on a vision. And we want 
to be part of that vision.'' That vision apparently included an effort 
to sign the 34-year-old Surhoff, a left-handed hitter who in all probability 
would bat behind Piazza if he is signed by the Mets. Surhoff batted 
.279 last season with 22 homers and 92 RBIs. And Surhoff plays a position 
_ left field _ that the Mets sorely lacked production from last season. 
Cashen said Tuesday that he was well versed in the particulars of 
Surhoff's career, beginning with his high school playing days in Rye, 
N.Y., through his college career at the University of North Carolina 
and his 12-year major league career _ the last three of which have 
been spent with the Orioles. Surhoff began his career as a catcher, 
just like one of the players the Mets attempted to make a left fielder 
of this past season: Todd Hundley. Hundley's 34-game experiment in 
the outfield was deemed a failure, and now the Mets are are trying 
to trade him. Hundley spoke to Mets co-owner Fred Wilpon on Tuesday 
night, and Wilpon assured Hundley that the Mets would abide by Phillips' 
promise that the Mets would trade him to a contending team. There 
are other free agents the Mets are apparently interested in, among 
them right fielder Brian Jordan and third baseman Robin Ventura. The 
Mets also have contacted representatives of their free-agent reliever 
Dennis Cook in the hopes of re-signing him. Cook said Tuesday that 
he wants to see what his value is on the open market. The Mets are 
also hoping they can resuscitate a proposed deal with the Dodgers 
that would send Mel Rojas to Los Angeles in exchange for former Met 
Bobby Bonilla. And Cashen Tuesday acknowledged that the Mets have 
talked about trying to acquire another former member of their organization, 
second baseman Fernando Vina, from the Milwaukee Brewers. And then, 
of course, there is Surhoff, who played for what many regarded as 
the most overpaid, underachieving team in baseball last season. Surhoff, 
however, was not viewed as being that type of player. And that may 
be one more reason why the Mets are interested in signing him.
