Spain's jobless claims rose to 11.11 percent of the active population 
in October from 11.02 percent the previous month, the Labor Ministry 
said Tuesday. At the end of October, about 1.8 million people had 
filed for unemployment insurance, up 15,277 from September, the ministry 
said. Analysts tend to watch the National Statistics Institute's quarterly 
unemployment data more closely than the Labor Ministry's monthly jobless-claims 
data. In the second quarter of 1998, the figure was at 18.9 percent. 
The quarterly data includes information on people out of work, rather 
than just on those eligible for unemployment benefit payments.
