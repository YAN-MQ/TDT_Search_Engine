Guerrillas, soldiers and refugees are among those to be questioned 
in a massive survey aimed at improving respect for humanitarian law 
in times of armed conflict, the international Red Cross said Tuesday. 
The dlrs 1 million survey, titled People on War, has already been 
launched in Colombia. It will also cover Bosnia, Somalia, Nigeria, 
South Africa and El Salvador. In each country, Red Cross volunteers 
will ask at least 1,000 people their views on whether international 
law has helped curb the excesses of war and how to improve compliance 
with the Geneva Conventions and other humanitarian treaties. Displaced 
civilians, former hostages, soldiers, guerrillas, security detainees 
and medical personnel, as well as the general public, will be targeted. 
There will also be a parallel survey in peaceful countries, starting 
with France. The project is meant to increase awareness of rules that 
exist for people's protection in war time and encourage discussion 
of humanitarian law and modern-day conflicts. Results of the survey, 
and personal stories of those involved, will be published next year 
to mark the 50th anniversary of the Geneva Conventions. The conventions 
are overseen by the International Committee of the Red Cross and are 
meant to guarantee protection for wounded soldiers, prisoners of war 
and civilians. One of their main failings is that they cover only 
state parties and international wars whereas many of today's conflicts 
are civil wars or involve guerrilla forces. ``For the ICRC, the anniversary 
is an opportunity for the world to reflect on what has occurred in 
the half-century since the conventions were adopted, to take stock 
of the present and to consider the future of international law and 
humanitarian action,'' an ICRC statement said.
