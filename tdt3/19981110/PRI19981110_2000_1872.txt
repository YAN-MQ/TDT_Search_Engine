Washington is warning Iraq could rebuild its weapons program in months 
unless action is taken to stop it blocking weapons inspections. State 
Department spokesman James Rubin says the world cannot allow Saddam 
Hussein to continue the standoff indefinitely. If he continues to 
block UNSCOM and we do not respond, he will be able to reconstitute 
his weapons of mass destruction in a matter of months, not years. 
And if we fail to act, he will feel emboldened to threaten the region 
further, armed with weapons of mass destruction. James Rubin. President 
Clinton has been meeting with senior advisers in Washington to discuss 
military options against Iraq.
