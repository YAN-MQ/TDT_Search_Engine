NBC news "in depth tonight" -- the search for the killer of the New 
York doctor who performed abortions. The justice department has put 
up $500,000 for information leading to the arrest and conviction of 
the gunman. And right now, authorities are searching for one man wanted 
for questioning. NBC's Pete Williams beginsp our "in depth" reporting 
with the latest on the manhunt. Since issuing a warrant for James 
kopp's arrest, investigators have seen no trace of him -- not at his 
home in Burlington, Vermont, thoroughly searched, or at the home of 
his sister in Delaware, who posted a Note on her house, insisting 
that kopp is a peaceful man, not capable of violence. And not in Buffalo, 
New York, where his car was spotted in the weeks before dr. Barnett 
slepian was killed at home by a sniper's bullet. But since investigators 
named kopp as a key witness, new details have emerged about hids anti-abortion 
background. Relatives say a religious objection hardened into a passionate 
hatred of abortion while kopp was a student at the University of Texas 
and a Girlfriend had the procedure without telling him. A group that 
tracks says kopp then dedicated his life to the anti-abortion movement. 
This was a man who's traveled the country, more or less from coast 
to coast and border to border, to protest at various clinics. NBC 
news has identified at least ten times that kopp was arrested for 
illegal protests at abortion clinics, including at least once in canada. 
And law enforcement officials tell NBC news that border records show 
kopp's car crossing into Canada at times corresponding to a series 
of shooting attacks on doctors there. But authorities say they have 
no evidence that kopp himself was in the cities where those attacks 
took place. Employees at a Canadian newspaper about 90 miles from 
Buffalo, say they think it was kopp who delivered two anti-abortion 
letters to the paper in the past six months. The FBI has responded 
to dozens of tips from people claiming to have seen kopp. But so far, 
his whereabouts and what he knows remain a mystery. Pete Williams,
