Baghdad is reaching out for Arab support in its dispute with U.N. 
weapons inspectors in hopes of leaving the United States isolated 
in its campaign to rally backing for the use of force against Iraq. 
Iraq's foreign minister, Mohammed Saeed al-Sahhaf, chose an Arab television 
station _ Qatar's Al-Jazeera _ for his first interview on the dispute. 
The crisis began Oct. 31 when Iraq halted cooperation with U.N. weapons 
inspectors. Al-Sahhaf warned that ``any use of military force against 
Iraq would lead to destabilizing the region.'' Raising a similar theme, 
Iraqi Trade Minister Mohammed Mehdi Saleh said Tuesday that America 
``will lose from any strike that takes place, and Iraq will gain.'' 
Asked how, Saleh said ``politically.'' It reflected Iraq's thinking 
that sympathy for the Iraqis _ especially on the Arab streets _ would 
leave the United States isolated in its campaign against the Baghdad 
regime. The United States and Britain have threatened military action 
to force Iraq to resume cooperate with the weapons inspectors. The 
monitors must certify that Baghdad is rid of weapons of mass destruction 
before the sanctions can be lifted. Saleh made his comments at the 
closing ceremony of a 10-day trade fair in Baghdad that drew delegations 
from 30 countries, 17 of them Arab or Muslim. ``The presence of Arab 
companies represents the trend toward normalizing and increasing relations,'' 
Saleh said in an interview with The Associated Press. The tactic of 
appealing to the Arabs is one indication of how differently the current 
dispute is unfolding compared with the last one. At the start of the 
year, when Iraq refused U.N. inspectors access to President Saddam 
Hussein's palaces, Russia, France and Turkey rushed envoys to Iraq 
to try to head off a military strike by the United States. The dispute 
was resolved on Feb. 23 when U.N. Secretary-General Kofi Annan traveled 
to Baghdad and reached an 11th hour agreement with Saddam to open 
the palace compounds. This time, no foreign envoys have been dispatched, 
in part because Iraq's defiance is not over a technical issue such 
as whether palaces were subject to inspection but over the very essence 
of the U.N. inspection program. Iraq has said it will not resume cooperation 
with the U.N. Special Commission until the Security Council begins 
to move toward ending the trade sanctions. There already are hints 
Iraq is prepared to go further in spite of the U.S. and British threats. 
Al-Thawra, a newspaper published by Saddam's ruling Baath Party, said 
in an editorial on Monday that ``the language of threats will make 
it legitimate for Iraq to review everything concerning its relations 
with UNSCOM and the Security Council.'' Western diplomats said this 
implied that Iraq could reject long-term U.N. monitoring of its weaponry 
or payments of war reparations, as required under U.N. resolutions. 
Iraq _ and some other Arab countries _ apparently hope Annan will 
again step in. Prakash Shah, Annan's special envoy in Baghdad, told 
reporters on Monday that ``a number of foreign ministers in this region 
and outside have suggested that the secretary-general visit'' to seek 
an end to the impasse. Iraq so far has allowed UNSCOM experts to stay 
in the country, although they are not allowed to do field work. UNSCOM 
on Saturday began reducing its staff from 130 to about 100, but said 
those remaining here could resume inspections quickly if Iraq changes 
its position. Iraq's Oct. 31 decision exempted nuclear experts, and 
teams from the Vienna-headquartered International Atomic Energy Agency 
have gone into the field almost every day. On Tuesday, five teams 
visited five sites _ the highest number this month.
