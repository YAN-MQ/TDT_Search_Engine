You may not know all the words to the kingsmen's "Louie Louie" but 
almost everyone's heard the song. On Monday, the Supreme Court ruled 
the band owns the rights to the 1963 hit. Casey wian reports. If you've 
ever been to a fraternity party or even seen a movie about one, you 
know this song. Louie Louie For more than 30 years, the kingsmen have 
not collected royalties for their version of "Louie Louie," despite 
a 1968 contract that was supposed to pay the group 9% of the profits 
or licensing fees from their songs. In 1993, the kingsmen sued gusto 
records, which owned rights to their music but had refused to pay 
royalties. Now, the Supreme Court has upheld the kingsmen's lawsuit, 
allowing the group to collect five years of back royalties and recover 
control of their master tapes. Kingsmen attorney Scott edelman says, 
for now, the group will collect only a few hundred thousand Dollars. 
It may not mean huge bucks, knock on wood, hopefully it will, but 
what it means is that the music that they've made and for which they're 
so well known and which has become such a part of the national fabric 
of this country, is now in their control. And that could mean big 
money from future TV, film or commercial deals. Kingsmen leader Dick 
Peterson told "CNN Financial News" the victory will mean a comfortable 
retirement for band members who still perform nationwide. "Louie Louie" 
caused a sensation in the 1960s because many believed its mumbled 
lyrics were obscene. After an FBI investigation, a judge ruled the 
lyrics were unintelligible at any speed, and the song became a hit. 
The song was originally written as a jamaican love ballad by Richard 
Berry in the 1950s. In 1986, he collected about $2 million in back 
royalties. Casey wian, "CNN Financial News," Los Angeles.
