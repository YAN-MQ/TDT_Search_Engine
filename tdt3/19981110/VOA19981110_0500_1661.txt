In other news coming out of China, police have arrested more than 
140 Christians in two separate incidents in Central Hanon Province. 
Members of the Christian group say it's a new crackdown against underground 
churches in China. In a letter, a spokesman for the banned churches 
said the worshipers were arrested during meetings in house churches 
during the past two weeks. He added that at least 11 group leaders 
were beaten. Human rights groups have long accused Beijing of abuses 
against religious dissidents.
