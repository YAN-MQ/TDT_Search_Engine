A new study is split on the benefits of alternative medicine. Some 
doctors say it works. Others say certain treatments promise more than 
they deliver. Steve Salvatore reports. Vanessa scotto uses alternative 
therapies like herbs and acupuncture to treat her sinus infections. 
I used to get them about seven times a year. I haven't gotten one 
in over two years. Vanessa is one of millions of Americans turning 
to alternative remedies to treat their medical conditions. Alternative 
medicine is so popular, the prestigious "journal of the american medical 
association" has devoted this week's entire issue to the subject. 
One major study found -- four out of ten adult Americans used these 
therapies in 1997. That's an estimated 83 million adult Americans. 
For over 5,000 years, the Chinese have used herbal remedies to treat 
a Variety of conditions. Now the medical community has decided to 
test these remedies against western standards. What they found is 
that some work and some don't. Dr. Steve heymsfield was the author 
of one of the studies. The herbal product garcinia cambogia failed 
to produce significantly more weight loss than a placebo tablet. But 
other studies did show some promise. One study found that moxibustion, 
the application of heat from burning herbs to an acupuncture point 
on a pregnant woman, can help babies in breech position turn to a 
more favorable head down position. Researchers say very few people 
discuss the alternative therapies with their doctors and that could 
be dangerous. It's not in anybody's best interest. Experts emphasize 
before any type of medical therapy can be accepted, it must be scientifically 
tested. And all sides agree this trend is going to continue. And it 
will take all segments of the medical community to make it safe. That's 
doctors, drug companies, insurance companies, and patients. Dr. Steve 
Salvatore, CNN, Washington.
