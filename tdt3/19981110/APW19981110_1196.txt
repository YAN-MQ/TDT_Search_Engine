France's finance minister confirmed on Tuesday that France is canceling 
the debt of Nicaragua and Honduras, a gesture to ease the devastation 
those countries have suffered from Hurricane Mitch. Dominique Strauss-Kahn 
made the announcement during a question-and-answer session in parliament. 
The confirmation came a day after Prime Minister Lionel Jospin called 
for the move. It also came a day before President Jacques Chirac leaves 
for the region devastated by Mitch. Honduras and Nicaragua had appealed 
for help with their foreign debts during a summit of Central American 
presidents Monday to discuss a response to Hurricane Mitch, which 
they say killed some 10,000 people. Nicaragua's debt to France is 
392 million francs (dlrs 71 million), out of a total foreign debt 
of dlrs 6 billion. Honduras' debt to France is 166 million francs 
(dlrs 30 million) out of a total foreign debt of dlrs 4.2 billion. 
U.S. President Bill Clinton last week requested a global relief effort 
and issued orders boosting U.S. emergency aid to dlrs 70 million. 
Chirac had long planned to visit Mexico and Guatemala. But he decided 
this week to expand his visit to include Honduras, Nicaragua and El 
Salvador, so he could view the damage firsthand and judge the kind 
of help needed. The president intends to meet with his counterparts 
in those nations and ``evaluate with them the urgent needs and the 
more long-term aid that Paris can bring to these countries,'' said 
Chirac's spokeswoman, Catherine Colonna. He will be accompanied by 
Foreign Minister Hubert Vedrine. In Mexico and Guatemala, he intends 
to focus on the economic role France can play in the region. Chirac 
is scheduled to address the Mexican parliament, and to meet with President 
Ernesto Zedillo. ``Mexico for us is a land of opportunity, because 
it is a country three times the size of ours,'' Colonna said Tuesday. 
Chirac also plans to sign a number of accords with Mexico, including 
one strengthening cooperation in the field of education.
