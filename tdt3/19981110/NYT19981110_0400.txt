In baseball's first major post-season trade, the Atlanta Braves on 
Tuesday took their first step in trying to reverse their post-season 
fortunes. ``We want to win six more games next year,'' said Braves 
general manager John Schuerholz, alluding to the reason the Braves 
fell short of the World Series championship for the sixth time in 
the seven seasons they have been in the playoffs in the '90s. The 
Braves sent Denny Neagle, a member of their vaunted starting pitching 
rotation, to the Cincinnati Reds in a five-player trade that brought 
them Bret Boone, the second baseman they coveted. The Braves also 
received a pitcher, Mike Remlinger, while the Reds acquired Atlanta's 
primary right fielder, Michael Tucker, and a minor league pitcher, 
Robby Bell. The trade could have implications negative and positive 
for the New York Mets. The trade put the Braves in position to seek 
a right fielder, and they will very likely pursue Brian Jordan, in 
whom the Mets have interest. But the deal left the Mets in the running 
for Fernando Vina, the Milwaukee Brewers' second baseman, whom the 
Braves has also discussed. ``We had an understanding,'' Brewers general 
manager Sal Bando said of Schuerholz. ``He had to make a decision 
which way he wanted to go, left-handed or right-handed.'' Schuerholz 
chose the right-handed-hitting Boone over the left-handed-hitting 
Vina, who is 10 days younger than Boone. The Brewers want pitching 
and/or right-handed power for Vina. ``He is somebody we have certainly 
talked about,'' said Mets interim general manager Frank Cashen. Schuerholz 
said the Braves felt Neagle was expendable because of the development 
of Kevin Millwood, who won 17 games for them this season, and Bruce 
Chen, who pitched impressively in the latter stages of the season. 
``We needed a second baseman and we wanted to get an excellent second 
baseman,'' Schuerholz said. ``Bret provides us with more offense and 
stellar defense at second base.'' He said Gerald Williams would replace 
Tucker in right field but added that he would seek another player 
for the position, either as a regular or to platoon with Williams. 
Jim Bowden said the Reds were reluctant to trade their Gold Glove 
second baseman but explained: ``We wanted to upgrade our starting 
pitching. With Neagle, Pete Harnisch and Brett Tomko, we want to see 
how competitive we can be in the Central Division.'' Neagle, who was 
a 20-game winner in 1997, had a 16-11 record this year. Tucker batted 
.244 in 130 games. Boone, son of the former major leaguer Bob Boone, 
reached career highs with a team-leading 24 home runs and 95 runs 
batted in. Remlinger had an 8-15 record in 28 starts and 7 relief 
appearances. Bowden said Pokey Reese will replace Boone at second. 
Aaron Boone, Bret's brother, will very likely be the Reds' third baseman. 
``Bret probably was the most popular player in Cincinnati,'' Bowden 
said. ``We really didn't want to trade him.'' Asked if Neagle's departure 
would prompt the Braves to go after Kevin Brown, a high-priced free 
agent, Schuerholz said any such signing would have to be offset with 
the shedding of salary. ``We do have a finite payroll,'' he said. 
``It doesn't have a bottomless pit.''
