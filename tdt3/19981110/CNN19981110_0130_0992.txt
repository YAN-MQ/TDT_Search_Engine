Women who say their Dow corning silicone-gel breast implants caused 
health problems may soon start receiving some money. A $3.2 billion 
settlement deal was filed in federal bankruptcy court on monday. 140,000 
women have filed suit against Dow corning. Under the proposal, each 
would receive $2,000 to $300,000. A judge, the plaintiffs and a group 
of creditors must approve the deal. If they do, the women could start 
receiving the money by next summer.
