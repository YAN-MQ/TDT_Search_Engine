There have been very bad test marks released today for more than 90% 
of small sport utility vehicles. The crash tests were done by the 
insurance institute for highway safety. And they find that in a controlled 
crash, only one out of ten deserved a Good rating. That was the 1999 
Subaru forester, the 1999 Isuzu amigo was rated poor. All the other 
small SUVs were judged to be only acceptable or marginal.
