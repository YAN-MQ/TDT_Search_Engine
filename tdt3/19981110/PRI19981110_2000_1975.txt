Prosecutors in Italy are to exhume the body of the man known as God's 
banker, Roberto Calvi. Calvi, whose business contacts were said to 
extend from the Mafia to the Vatican was found hanged under a London 
bridge 16 years ago. Prosecutors want to determine once and for all 
whether Calvi's death was murder or suicide. From the BBC Newsroom 
in London, this is Pamela McCall. You're listening to THE WORLD.
