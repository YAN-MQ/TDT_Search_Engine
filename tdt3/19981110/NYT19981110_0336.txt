The holiday season is a scary time in Hollywood. ``Am I nervous? Is 
the sun going to come out tomorrow?'' said Jeffrey Katzenberg, the 
Dreamworks partner who has overseen ``The Prince of Egypt,'' the animated 
biblical musical opening Dec. 18. ``I'm not quite panicked yet, but 
that'll come, too.'' The chairman of Fox Filmed Entertainment put 
it somewhat more bluntly. ``It's nerve-racking,'' said William Mechanic, 
whose studio is releasing ``The Thin Red Line,'' a big-budget World 
War II drama directed by Terrence Malick, on Dec. 25. ``Everyone else 
is having a good time and you're wondering whether you'll die or not.'' 
Mechanic will, in all probability, survive the holidays. So will Katzenberg. 
But setting aside Hollywood hyperbole, the season that begins just 
before Thanksgiving and ends with the New Year is not only the busiest 
time of moviegoing in the nation. It's also when studios and independent 
companies roll the dice and release films whose box office tally can 
spell the difference between success or failure for the year. (The 
nearly 100 films released over the next six weeks will account for 
as much as 20 percent of the 1998 box office). ``Does this mean that 
some pictures that really deserve an audience will get hurt in this 
brief period of time?'' said Sherry Lansing, the chairman of Paramount. 
``Of course it does. It not only makes me absolutely nervous; it saddens 
me.'' But ask a top studio executive or producer to define a holiday 
film and the responses are blurry. A feel-good movie. A women's film. 
A children's comedy. An Academy Award contender released just before 
the end of the year so voters can easily recall the film at nomination 
time early next year. ``There is no such thing as a holiday film because 
moviegoers come in all sizes and shapes,'' insisted Joe Roth, the 
chairman of Walt Disney Studios, whose slate over the Thanksgiving-Christmas 
period underscored his point. That studio is releasing ``I'll Be Home 
for Christmas,'' a Jonathan Taylor Thomas pre-teen-age film whose 
title alone guarantees a holiday release; ``Enemy of the State,'' 
a splashy Tony Scott-directed drama with Will Smith and Gene Hackman, 
being issued because it's one of the few films for action audiences 
over the holidays and two movies for families, a remake of ``Mighty 
Joe Young,'' with Bill Paxton, and ``A Bug's Life,'' an animated film 
by the computer whizzes who created the hit ``Toy Story.'' And there's 
an Academy Award hopeful, ``A Civil Action,'' adapted and directed 
by Steven Zaillian from the nonfiction best seller by Jonathan Harr. 
The drama stars John Travolta as a lawyer obsessed with proving two 
corporations responsible for the leukemia deaths of five children 
and one adult in Woburn, Mass. The film will have a limited release 
on Dec. 25, to qualify it for Oscar consideration. What are Roth's 
concerns about the holidays? ``I'm critical of all of us,'' he said. 
``We end up putting too many movies aimed at women over 30 into this 
season, year in and year out, when women in fact are the least available 
moviegoers.'' The conventional wisdom in Hollywood is that in the 
pre-Christmas rush of shopping and family activities, women have no 
time to see movies. That changes on Christmas Day and in the week 
that follows. Among the loosely defined women's films due this year 
are such expensive comedies as Nora Ephron's ``You've Got Mail,'' 
about an online romance between Meg Ryan and Tom Hanks. There are 
also several comedy-dramas: one is ``Stepmom,'' directed by Chris 
Columbus, in which Susan Sarandon plays a divorced mother with cancer 
who forms a bond with her ex-husband's girlfriend, played by Julia 
Roberts. Another is ``Meet Joe Black,'' inspired by the 1934 classic, 
``Death Takes a Holiday.'' Directed by Martin Brest, the three-hour 
film stars Brad Pitt and Anthony Hopkins. Even more competitive are 
the animated films, notably ``The Prince of Egypt,'' a direct challenge 
to Disney's hegemony in animation _ and a sign of the intense competition 
between Katzenberg and his former boss, Michael Eisner, the Disney 
chairman who ousted him. Katzenberg said the idea for ``The Prince 
of Egypt'' came during discussions with Steven Spielberg, another 
Dreamworks partner, while the company was being formed. ``I said I'd 
love to do a story in animation like `Indiana Jones,' a big action 
story, or a science-fiction film like `Terminator,' a film with grandeur 
and spectacle,'' recalled Katzenberg. ``And Steven said, `Why don't 
you do the Ten Commandments?' I looked at him for a half-second, blinked 
and said, `Great idea.''' Besides ``A Bug's Life'' and ``The Prince 
of Egypt,'' the other large-scale animated film is ``The Rugrats Movie,'' 
opening Friday. Albie Hecht, president of film and television entertainment 
at Nickelodeon, said there was no question about when to release the 
Rugrats film. ``We are really differentiated from the competition 
because we deal with contemporary family issues like sibling rivalry 
and loyalty and friendship.'' In contrast to the plethora of animated 
and women's films _ and movies in both those genres will succeed only 
if families and couples show up too _ the studios also shoot for unpredictability. 
Two years ago, Miramax surprised Hollywood by releasing a teen-age 
horror film, ``Scream,'' just before Christmas. Until then, it had 
been unthinkable for a company to distribute a scary movie at a time 
of good cheer. ``We were ridiculed for putting it out over Christmas,'' 
said Mark Gill, who runs the Los Angeles office of Miramax. ``What 
they didn't understand is that people under the age of 25 want a little 
nihilism and attitude over Christmas.'' The nihilism and attitude 
award this year goes to ``Psycho,'' Gus Van Sant's remake of the Alfred 
Hitchcock classic. Vince Vaughn is Norman Bates (the Anthony Perkins 
role) and Anne Heche steps into the shower in the Janet Leigh part. 
Brian Grazer, one of Hollywood's most successful producers, who decided 
to remake ``Psycho,'' said the film was opening before Christmas (on 
Dec. 4) mostly because there was no comparable film around. ``It's 
so much about differentiation. It's neither an Oscar movie, like some 
of the others, nor a real soft `I love you movie.''' As for those 
Oscar movies, in addition to ``The Thin Red Line'' and ``A Civil Action,'' 
the hopefuls include ``Patch Adams,'' directed by Tom Shadyac, in 
which Robin Williams plays a medical student who discovers the healing 
power of humor, and Sam Raimi's ``A Simple Plan,'' a dark drama based 
on Scott Smith's novel about two brothers who find a downed plane 
loaded with $4.4 million. Similarly, ``Elizabeth,'' a lavish costume 
drama starring Cate Blanchett as the English Queen who took the throne 
in 1558, will expand its release around Thanksgiving to seek Academy 
Awards attention. Miramax has been especially successful opening films 
late in the year _ ``The English Patient,'' ``The Piano'' and ``Good 
Will Hunting'' _ and turning them into Oscar contenders. This year 
the company has hopes for ``Shakespeare in Love,'' a comedy-drama 
with Gwyneth Paltrow, and ``Little Voice,'' a poignant comedy with 
Jane Horrocks and Michael Caine. Gill, the Miramax executive, said 
that busy as studios are preparing for the holiday rush, everyone 
is looking ahead. Far ahead. ``Studios are already setting up their 
Thanksgiving and Christmas for (italics)next(end italics) year,'' 
he said. ``We have `Scream 3' coming out in the holiday season, 1999. 
And I hear there's a new James Bond film.''
