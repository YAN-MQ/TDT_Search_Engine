Helped by a sharp rebound in bond markets worldwide, Long-Term Capital 
Management has earned a small paper profit for the banks and brokerage 
firms that saved it from bankruptcy in September, people close to 
the hedge fund said. The turnabout in the fund's fortunes is modest, 
the people said. The portfolio's value has risen no more than 1 percent 
since the 14 banks and brokerage firms invested $3.6 billion six weeks 
ago. ``We are ahead by a nose,'' one person, who spoke on the condition 
of anonymity, said. But the situation has greatly improved from the 
days just after the rescue, when many of Long-Term Capital's bets 
looked like long shots. The value of the fund's portfolio fell sharply 
in late September and early October, just after the rescue, but began 
to improve late last month. The recovery picked up pace this month, 
with the fund earning back all it had lost since late September, as 
markets rallied globally. ``We are not out of the woods yet, and the 
operative word is caution,'' one person close to the hedge fund said. 
``But there is a sense of relief.'' The improved results are good 
news for Wall Street firms, including Merrill Lynch, Goldman, Sachs, 
Morgan Stanley, J.P. Morgan and Citigroup, that saved Long-Term Capital 
in an unusual effort brokered by the New York Federal Reserve. Many 
of those firms were reluctant to risk their own shareholder funds 
_ $100 million to $300 million apiece _ to prop up a speculative portfolio. 
But if the good news continues, it would seem to support the view 
that it was better to rescue the fund and manage its trading positions 
over months or years than to plunge it into bankruptcy and sell its 
holdings all at once, which Fed officials feared could worsen global 
market turmoil. ``We believed for some time that there was value in 
the positions if we could get past the market crisis,'' said an executive 
from a firm that participated in the bailout. The stabilization of 
the fund has not greatly benefited its original investors, whose money 
was committed well before it nearly collapsed. Long-Term Capital was 
down more than 90 percent for the year before the rescue, and the 
recent rebound makes up only a small fraction of that earlier loss. 
The fund tries to profit by exploiting temporary price differences 
between related types of bonds, like Treasury bonds and corporate 
bonds. The price gap between such bonds widened to unusual levels 
in the summer. Since the Federal Reserve twice cut interest rates 
in October, that price gap has narrowed.
