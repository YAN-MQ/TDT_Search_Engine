A new study of arts education in U.S. schools paints a troubling picture. 
The study found about 20% of schools offer no music or art classes. 
Education secretary Richard Riley says that's wrong, and he calls 
it a Serious mistake to short-change children's instruction in the 
arts. Riley says music and art can help young people learn to think 
creatively and solve problems. Many school districts have cut back 
on art and music classes because of tight budgets.
