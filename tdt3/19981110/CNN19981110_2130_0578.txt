A California judge has ordered a new hearing to determine the custody 
of o.J. Simpson's two youngest children. Tonight's decision reverses 
an earlier court ruling that awarded custody to simpson. The appeals 
court ruled the lower court failed to consider the civil court decision 
that found Simpson responsible for the killing of his ex-wife. The 
children, Sydney and Justin, were asleep when their mother Nicole 
brown was killed outside their Los Angeles condominium in June 1994.
