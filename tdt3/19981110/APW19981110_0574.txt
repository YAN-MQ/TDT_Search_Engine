Despite its crackdown on Islamic militants, the Palestinian Authority 
has renewed a high-level dialogue with Hamas and Islamic Jihad, apparently 
trying to prevent a violent backlash, participants said Tuesday. Hamas 
and Islamic Jihad representatives met separately Monday with Tayeb 
Abdel-Rahim, the secretary general of the Palestinian Authority and 
one of Yasser Arafat's closest advisers. Abdel-Rahim would not comment 
Tuesday on the meetings. However, Imad Falouji, a former Hamas activist 
and member of Arafat's Cabinet, suggested the aim was to work out 
a relationship in which Hamas and Islamic Jihad would be recognized 
as legitimate opposition groups. In exchange, the two groups would 
stop trying to sabotage the Israeli-Palestinian peace accords. ``We 
are not against the opposition, but they should respect Palestinian 
law and respect the commitments of the Palestinian Authority,'' Falouji 
said in an apparent reference to the peace agreements between Israel 
and the Palestinians. It was not clear whether Hamas and Islamic Jihad 
would agree to such a trade, which would require calling a halt to 
attacks on Israelis. Such violence is a key element of the ideology 
of both groups. The latest crackdown began Oct. 29, in response to 
a suicide attack by Hamas on an Israeli convoy in the Gaza Strip. 
In a second bombing, two Islamic Jihad activists blew themselves up 
Friday in Jerusalem's outdoor market. The violence prompted Israel 
to suspend ratification of the Oct. 23 land-for-security agreement 
under which Israel was to withdraw from 13 percent of the West Bank, 
in exchange for tougher Palestinian measures against Islamic militants. 
In response to the bombings, Arafat's security forces detained hundreds 
of suspected Hamas and Islamic Jihad followers and placed the spiritual 
leader of Hamas, Sheik Ahmed Yassin, under house arrest. Mahmoud Zahar, 
a Hamas leader, said that in his Monday meeting with Abdel-Rahim, 
he demanded the release of all detainees against whom there was no 
evidence of involvement in attacks. Zahar said the Palestinian Authority 
must also release Yassin. ``Our demands were clear that no one should 
be arrested just for belonging to Hamas,'' Zahar told Associated Press 
Television News. Zahar said the group wanted to continue the contacts. 
``We are talking about a dialogue in which each side's needs can be 
addressed in order to reach common ground,'' he said. Nafez Azzam, 
an Islamic Jihad leader, refused to discuss the meetings. The renewed 
talks were likely to anger the Israeli government which has made an 
uncompromising campaign against the militants a key condition for 
implementing the peace accord. However, Arafat is faced with a possible 
violent backlash if he takes the crackdown too far. Hamas, especially, 
is strongly rooted in Palestinian society, providing badly needed 
social services with a network of clinics, schools and kindergartens.
