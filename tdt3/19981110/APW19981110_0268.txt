The Singapore International Monetary Exchange issued a thinly veiled 
criticism of the Hong Kong Stock Exchange on Tuesday, warning that 
exchanges that fear competition will ultimately lose business. ``Exchanges 
that adopt an enlightened approach to competition find that there 
is a bigger pie to share,'' SIMEX president Ang Swee Tian said at 
an international futures industry seminar. But exchanges that pursue 
anti-competitive practices invariably find they are powerless to prevent 
business migrating elsewhere, Ang warned. Hong Kong's stock exchange 
has said it will block real-time price data from being used by Singapore's 
monetary exchange for futures trading of a stock index that is virtually 
identical to the special administrative region's benchmark index. 
Singapore's monetary exchange plans to launch the Morgan Stanley Capital 
International Hong Kong Stock Index Futures contract Nov. 23. Officials 
from the Hong Kong exchange have argued that the SIMEX product might 
steal away trading business, and could be used by outside parties 
to manipulate the Hang Seng Index. Also speaking at the Tuesday seminar, 
Hong Kong Stock Exchange chief Alex Tsui said he questioned the value 
of another exchange using ``information to offer a certain product 
that competes with my product that I trade on my exchange.'' Tsui 
added that Hong Kong's agreements with information vendors state that 
if information is supplied to a third party to create a competitive 
product, then the exchange has to give its consent. ``So far no one 
has come to ask any consent whatsoever,'' Tsui said. ``I'm still waiting 
for any proposal from anybody saying that it is good for both parties; 
I haven't seen any so far.'' Executives from the feuding exchanges 
met in Hong Kong last week, but made no progress in resolving the 
dispute. On Tuesday, Ang denied allegations that by relaunching the 
contract _ which was originally listed in Singapore in 1993 but scrapped 
last year because of lack of interest _ SIMEX was trying to win business 
away from Hong Kong. He said SIMEX seeks to maintain close working 
relationships with other exchanges to promote collective market integrity.
