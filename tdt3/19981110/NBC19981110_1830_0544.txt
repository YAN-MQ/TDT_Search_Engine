Russia is getting some help tonight. The European union has reached 
an agreement that should help beef up russia's dwindling food supplies. 
And joining the United States in sending shipments of food immediately. 
Russia is in danger of a long winter of starveation, brought on from 
a bad winter and economic collapse. Hunger is stalking Russia. The 
poor, the elderly, scavenge farm fields, desperate for something to 
eat. She tells us "go away. People are dying of hunger. Maybe we'll 
die tomorrow." With the economy in meltdown, food prices have tripled. 
A 50% increase in the numbers of those lined up at charity kitchens 
on the streets of Moscow. A fierce summer drought produced the smallest 
harvest in 35 years. But even under good conditions, farmers can't 
feed Russia. Imports count for 60% of the food Russia eats. In ivanovo, 
250 miles from Moscow, there is no more imported food, virtually no 
meat. Fruit experts fear it will slowly grow into a severe health 
crisis. This is a human catastrophe because what we are seeing is 
a silent disaster. At the town's orphanage, the daily diet is noodles 
and bread. So little food, the freezer has been turned off. There 
are problems getting fruit, fish, wheat. No flour. I worry about the 
children's health. Starvation is feared in some parts of Russia this 
winter. Malnutrition is already a serious problem. The red cross says 
50% of the children in Russia are underdeveloped. Like these orphans, 
fed, but not what they need. Across town, Irina korbatov feeds her 
baby boy potatoes and soft drinks. She can't afford baby formula or 
milk. She and her husband live on what they grow in their garden, 
selling cabbages for a few cents a head. It's terrible. Such awful 
conditions. No money. In their refrigerator? Not food. Just storage 
for a broken radio. And with the fierce winter only now settling in, 
Russia's hunger pains are just beginning. Dana Lewis, NBC news, ivanovo, 
Russia.
