Building on their success organizing relief efforts for victims of 
Hurricane Georges on the island of Hispaniola, a group of Dominican 
taxi drivers are now working to aid people in Central America whose 
lives were uprooted by Hurricane Mitch. Wednesday and Thursday, about 
3,000 livery-cab drivers will begin collecting clothes, food and water 
from houses and apartments across the city to send to people in Nicaragua, 
Honduras, Guatemala and El Salvador. The hurricane devastated entire 
villages and cities and caused more than 10,000 deaths. ``I come from 
a poor country, so I know what these people are going through,'' said 
Carlos Morban, a driver from the Dominican Republic. ``I understand 
that as poor as we are here, we have it better than many other people, 
so we have to give to them in time of need.`` This push will supplement 
efforts already under way from various community groups around the 
region. Last week, dozens of churches, schools, community centers 
and travel agencies were serving as makeshift warehouses for goods 
awaiting distribution in Central America. The efforts were slowed 
by concerns about whether the aid would actually reach the truly needy. 
This week, however, community leaders have been able to speak to church 
groups in Central America to insure that the goods will reach those 
in need. Fernando Mateo, president of the New York State Federation 
of Taxi Drivers, most of whose members are Dominican, is leading this 
drive, and said the devastation caused by Hurricane Mitch in Central 
America was considerably worse than what Georges caused in the Caribbean. 
Still, he said, New Yorkers have not given any sign of being unwilling 
to donate as much as they did last month. So far, more than 12 tons 
of goods _ including canned food, used clothing, medicine and first 
aid kits _ have been collected. ``It's fortunate that everyone we're 
working with has gotten a second wind,'' said Mateo, who joined other 
veterans of the Hurricane Georges relief effort at a news conference 
Tuesday on the Intrepid Sea-Air-Space Museum to announce the new drive. 
``They understand that what happened in Central America is much greater 
than in the Caribbean.'' The goal is to collect about 200 tons of 
goods by this weekend and haul it by trucks to Dover Air Force base 
in Delaware where military C-5 planes are to fly the aid down to Central 
America. Once the U.S. planes turn the cargo over, it is to be flown 
to villages and cities with the most need. ``It's hard to distribute 
by roads when the roads have been washed down,'' said Gen. Charles 
Wilhelm, of the Marine Corps. ``This aid is really dispersed based 
on the guidance we've received from various countries.''
