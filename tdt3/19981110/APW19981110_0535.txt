National Steel Corp., the Philippines' largest steel manufacturer, 
has been granted an indefinite debt moratorium by its creditors, a 
bank official said Tuesday. National Steel has encountered problems 
meeting its maturing obligations due to the weaker peso and higher 
interest rates. Creditors decided to give National Steel an indefinite 
debt moratorium since all of the company's 12 billion pesos (dlrs 
300 million) in loans are covered by assets, Philippine National Bank 
chairman Edgardo Angara said. The moratorium covers principal payments 
only. ``Everyone is adequately covered,'' Angara said. PNB has the 
largest loan exposure among National Steel's creditors, estimated 
at 5 billion pesos (dlrs 125 million). National Steel officials were 
not immediately available for comment. Earlier this year, National 
Steel's 14 creditor banks granted the company a 60-day debt moratorium 
while studying the financial viability of the company and evaluating 
its assets. Prime lending rates, currently at 14 to 20 percent, rose 
sharply after the onset of Asia's currency crisis. In the third quarter 
of last year, prime lending rates rose as high as 35 percent. Prior 
to the economic crisis, prime lending rates averaged 13 percent.
