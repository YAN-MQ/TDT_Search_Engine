The situation in Tibet is taking center stage here in Washington as 
the Dalai Lama visits the White House today. China is once again leveling 
criticism at the exiled Tibetan leader. Beijing officials also are 
accusing the United States of supporting what China calls the Dalai 
Lama's divisive activities. VOA's Stephanie Ho has more from Beijing. 
The Dalai Lama's aides have suggested he will use his trip to the 
United States to offer Beijing concessions that might secure dialogue 
with the Chinese government. But while presenting a human rights award 
in Washington on Monday, the exiled religious leader who fled Tibet 
in 1959 made a statement that infuriated Beijing officials. He said 
Tibetans in his Himalayan homeland are victims of human rights violations. 
The Nobel Peace Prize winner accused Chinese authorities of jailing 
and torturing monks and nuns for publicly seeking more freedom. In 
Beijing Tuesday, Chinese foreign ministry spokesman Zhu Bang Xao had 
equally harsh words for the Dalai Lama. Mr. Zhu, speaking through 
an interpreter, said Beijing's position alone has been that the exiled 
Tibetan leader is a separatist. The Dalai has never activities in 
speaking and advocating Tibetan independence. Mr. Zhu said any meetings 
between senior U.S. leaders and the Dalai Lama will, in his words, 
constitute the U.S. government's connivance and support of the Dalai 
Lama's splittest activities. The Chinese spokesman said the U.S. government 
recognizes Tibet as part of China and so should not show support for 
Tibetan independence. U.S. failed to act in strict accordance with 
its commission, particularly U.S. leaders resumed for a meetingso 
as not to cause damage to China-U.S. relations. The remote Himalayan 
region of Tibet in Western China, Borish Napal, Futon, and India.
