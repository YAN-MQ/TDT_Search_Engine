And "living better" tonight. Some more health information that might 
surprise you. Despite the conventional wisdom about their high cholesterol 
content, eggs may not be bad for you at all. Here's NBC chief science 
correspondent Robert Bazell. a major health message for decades, most 
of us take it as scientific fact -- to protect your heart, eat fewer 
eggs. That's why egg consumption in this country dropped almost 25% 
over the last four decades. But wait a minute. I think the public 
would believe that there had been many studies which had shown that 
people who ate eggs had higher risks of heart disease. And actually, 
there have never been any such studies. No studies? Dr. Walter willett 
is one of the top researchers in the highly respected harvard nurse's 
health study which has followed the eating habits of 120,000 women 
for 22 years. He says he understands why people might believe eggs 
could increase the risk of heart disease. More than any other food, 
egg yolks are crammed with cholesterol -- the same chemical that makes 
up the sticky substance called "plaque" that blocks the arteries to 
the heart. That may be logical, but it doesn't automatically mean 
that eating egg cholesterol clogs your heart. There's really no body 
of evidence that shows that people who eat more eggs have higher risks 
of heart disease. In fact, willett says he has strong evidence from 
the nurse's health study that eggs do not increase risk of heart disease 
and yet, he is having trouble publishing the findings scientific journals. 
Because there is so much resistance among elements of the scientific 
counity, and they think the public should not be confused. So here's 
what you should know. Eggs may have no impact at all on your cholesterol, 
but, to prevent heart disease, you should still do whatever you can 
to lower your cholesterol. On a population basis, there's a direct 
relationship between blood cholesterol levels and the incidence of 
cardiovascular disease. But the results from the nurse's health study, 
one of the biggest investigations of diet and health ever, suggest 
that the danger from eggs is not all it's cracked up to be. Robert 
Bazell, NBC news, Boston.
