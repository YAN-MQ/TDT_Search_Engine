There's further proof that Britain's monarchy is modernizing: Prince 
Charles has launched his own Internet website. Spread across 354 pages, 
it contains biographical information about the heir to the throne, 
who turns 50 on Saturday, and will be updated regularly with news 
and pictures, his office announced Tuesday. The site is divided into 
sections covering Charles' life, his work and an Online Forum page 
which highlights issues of particular interest to Queen Elizabeth 
II's eldest son. His speeches and a schedule of upcoming appearances 
are also included. In its first day, the site attracted a stream of 
e-mails from around the world, with website visitors from Australia 
to the United States writing in reaction to the prince's views on 
topics such as architecture and genetically modified foods. E-mailers 
also sought his opinion on issues ranging from the modernization of 
the monarchy to environmental protection and alternative medicine.
