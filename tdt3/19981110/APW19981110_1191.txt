Hall of Famer Hal Newhouser, the only pitcher to win consecutive Most 
Valuable Player awards, died Tuesday after a long illness. He was 
77. A native of Detroit, Newhouser pitched for his hometown Tigers 
from 1939-53 and led them to a World Series championship over the 
Chicago Cubs in 1945. In the decisive seventh game, he pitched a complete 
game. Newhouser was the American League's MVP after going 29-9 in 
1944. He won the honor again in 1945 when he was 25-9 with eight shutouts. 
Newhouser, elected to the Baseball Hall of Fame in 1992, was on seven 
All-Star teams, led the American League in wins four times and in 
strikeouts and earned run averages twice. After spending the final 
two years of his career with Cleveland, Newhouser retired in 1955 
with a 207-150 record and 3.02 ERA. In July 1997, he became the only 
pitcher to have his uniform number retired by the Tigers. His No. 
16 is painted on the facing of Tiger Stadium's third deck in right 
field. ``I am very pleased,'' Newhouser said at the ceremony where 
his number was retired. ``And I have to say if it wasn't for the players 
that played in back of me, I would've never stood here today.'' Several 
of Newhouser's surviving teammates from Detroit's 1945 world champions 
as well as other former Tigers stars were in attendance. ``It was 
much more fun playing with him than against him,'' Hall of Fame third 
baseman George Kell said. ``If you wanted one pitcher to start the 
seventh game of the World Series, which he did in 1945, you'd pick 
Hal Newhouser.'' Newhouser was only the fourth player to have his 
number retired by the Tigers. The others were Charlie Gehringer (2), 
Hank Greenberg (5) and Al Kaline (6). Detroit also retired No. 42 
in honor of Jackie Robinson. Following his retirement, Newhouser went 
into banking for 20 years, then returned to baseball as a Michigan 
area scout for the Houston Astros.
