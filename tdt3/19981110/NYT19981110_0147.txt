When it was all over, when he had finished choreographing ``The Lion 
King,'' won his Tony Award and returned home to Rochester, Garth Fagan 
was relieved to be back with his dance company. Yes, his ``Lion King'' 
experience had been wonderful, but Fagan welcomed the opportunity 
to choreograph for bodies without having to worry about how they would 
balance with elaborate puppets on their arms and cumbersome masks 
on their heads. To move dancers around without having to worry about 
dodging tracks in the floor and large pieces of scenery. ``It was 
heaven,'' said Fagan, 58. ``Suddenly I'm using an empty space to dance 
on, clear space that I can carve. Critics have always commented on 
the physical condition of my dancers. It was a joy to see that without 
anything covering, so you can see the movement with more clarity.'' 
Fagan's 13-member modern-dance company is back in New York this week 
for a 12-day run at the Joyce Theater. In its 28th season, the company 
has been widely acclaimed for Fagan's signature style, which combines 
African, Caribbean, modern and classical influences. Fagan said he 
liked to create movement with a purpose and a meaning. In his ``Two 
Pieces of One: Green,'' which is having its world premiere this week, 
Fagan said he had tried to explore the idea of ``two different perspectives 
making one unified position.'' As a result, the work is set to the 
music of a contemporary jazz musician, Tony Williams, and a 16th-century 
composer, Cristobal de Morales. ``I like jazz, I like Gregorian chant,'' 
Fagan said. ``Why not investigate them all?'' It is Fagan's inventive 
iconoclasm _ evident in pieces like his celebrated ``Griot New York'' 
(1991) _ that has earned him forceful critical praise over the years. 
In 1994, Anna Kisselgoff wrote of Fagan in The New York Times: ``As 
a choreographer, Fagan goes his own way. His works can refer to serious 
social issues (AIDS, urban ills). But he has none of the self-awareness 
of his contemporaries in modern dance, and he is willing to follow 
his fancy to the point of oddity, in both vocabulary and structure.'' 
P.J. Pennewell, who has danced with Fagan's troupe for 19 years, said 
the choreographer often incorporated other creative forms. ``He's 
always researching different art exhibits or architectures or poetry 
readings,'' Pennewell said. ``He likes to use a lot of those past 
experiences as reference points.'' This dramatic, daring quality of 
Fagan's dances got him the attention of Peter Schneider and Thomas 
Schumacher at Walt Disney Theatrical Productions, which produced ``The 
Lion King,'' and Julie Taymor, who directed the wildly successful 
musical. ``We were not looking for traditional choreography because 
the show was so outside the definition of a traditional Broadway show,'' 
Schumacher said. ``It really had to be a fusion of contemporary and 
of indigenous. Mr. Garth was a great candidate for that. It seemed 
to come very easily to him.'' After considering the work of several 
choreographers, Ms. Taymor said, she went to see Fagan's company perform, 
and that made her decision easy. ``I could really see how the isolation 
movements of the bodies would really lend themselves to the animal 
moves,'' she said, adding that ``his own particular interest in the 
flexibility of the torso would really be great for mask work and the 
needs of `The Lion King.''' Fagan had worked on a couple of theatrical 
productions before: ``A Midsummer Night's Dream'' at the Public Theater 
in 1988 and Duke Ellington's musical, ``Queenie Pie,'' which he also 
directed, at the Kennedy Center in 1986. But ``The Lion King,'' he 
says, was a show of a different order. First, there were the logistical 
complications of dealing with the puppets and large headdresses that 
the dancers manipulate as they move. ``When a dancer does a leap, 
that's one thing,'' Fagan said. ``But when you leap with a gazelle 
on your head and two on your arms, you've got to be prepared.'' In 
addition, Fagan said he wanted his choreography to work on several 
levels _ conveying a clear sense of character, furthering the plot, 
bringing the animals to life. ``I had to come up with new things that 
gave the effect of natural animals, at the same time keeping the duality 
of animal and person alive throughout,'' Fagan said. ``In concert 
dance you can abstract, you can meander, you can go away from. Here, 
you had to tell the story.'' Because, for example, the dance of the 
lionesses early on in the show is pivotal in establishing their role 
in the jungle, Fagan said, it was crucial to get the choreography 
just right. ``It sets up the lionesses as being the moving forces, 
the ones who hunt and the ones who keep the pride while the male lions 
fight,'' he said. ``So it was a very important metaphor for contemporary 
women.'' Similarly, Fagan said, the hyenas had to be murderous and 
treacherous and human at the same time. And then, of course, he had 
to keep the children in the audience interested. ``In using every 
type of dance that was available to me _ modern, African, ballet and 
regular childlike horseplay,'' Fagan said, ``I wanted every kid to 
plug into something as being familiar from classes or different cultures 
and make that universal.'' Fagan's interest in dance grew out of his 
experience with gymnastics. His father, the chief education officer 
of Jamaica, where Fagan was born, initially did not approve. ``My 
father was an Oxford graduate, and he didn't understand that dancing 
could go this far,'' Fagan said. ``He wanted me to be one of the lawyer-doctor 
types, an educator like he was. I just knew I wanted to do this, and 
I couldn't explain to him that it was more than fat girls running 
around the room.'' Fagan began his professional career in high school, 
touring Latin America with Ivy Baxter and the Jamaican National Dance 
Company. After graduating from Wayne State University in Detroit, 
he performed with several dance companies in Detroit before moving 
to Rochester in 1970 to teach at the State University of New York 
at Brockport, where he is now a Distinguished University Professor, 
and start his company. He has been honored with awards before. But 
winning the Tony _ along with the Drama Desk Award, the Outer Critics 
Circle Award and the Astaire Award _ for ``The Lion King'' was, Fagan 
said, particularly momentous. ``As a modern-dance choreographer from 
the not-for-profit world, I felt very proud and honored,'' he said. 
``To represent the integrity of artists like myself, who worked for 
pennies for years.''
