Formal impeachment hearings against President Clinton are set to begin 
next week. As a prelude to that, a house Judiciary subcommittee opened 
a hearing monday on what constitutes an impeachable offense. 19 scholars 
shared their opinions about whether President Clinton's conduct in 
the Monica Lewinsky matter can be construed as "high crimes and misdemeanors." 
Committee members also are reflecting on whether the republican leadership 
struggle in the house will impact on the impeachment inquiry. I would 
not expect whoever may be elected speaker to come in and try to change 
the course of the hearings and what we are doing. I wouldn't expect 
any impact of them, but again I can be surprised. We have a constitutional 
responsibility. We have the same evidence that we had before the election. 
We have the same law and precedent that we had before the election, 
and we are positive proceed in a logical and thoughtful way to bring 
these allegations to a conclusion.
