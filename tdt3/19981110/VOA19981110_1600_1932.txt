Israel's Cabinet is to meet Wednesday to ratify a new peace agreement 
with the Palestinians after two weeks of delays. Ross Dunn has the 
report from Jerusalem. The Office of the Israeli Prime Minister, Benjamin 
Netanyahu, says he will convene the Cabinet Wednesday to approve the 
accord with the Palestinians signed at the White House last month. 
Mr. Netanyahu stated in his statement Tuesday that he is reconvening 
the Cabinet after receiving reports that the Palestinian authority 
has decided to take practical steps against Palestinian terror groups 
and their infrastructure. Discussion of the agreement had been scheduled 
for last Friday but was canceled after two suicide bombers killed 
themselves and injured 21 Israeli shoppers at Jerusalem's main open 
air market. It has since been confirmed that the bombers were members 
of the militant Islamic Jihad group which opposes any peace deal with 
Israel. Ross Dunn for VOA News, Jerusalem.
