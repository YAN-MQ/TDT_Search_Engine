U.S. authorities have seized a Colombian Air Force cargo plane after 
discovering more than 630 kilograms of cocaine on board. Customs officials 
detained the aircraft in Ft. Lauderdale, Florida just north of Miami. 
State Department spokesman James Rubin says the plane's crew agreed 
to let customs agents conduct a search for drugs. He says the Colombian 
government has been notified and is fully cooperating.
