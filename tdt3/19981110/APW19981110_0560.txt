After conceding 15 goals in the last two games, the Bundesliga club 
Borussia Moenchengladbach fired coach Friedel Rausch on Tuesday. Once 
one of the most glorious Bundesliga clubs with five national titles 
and two UEFA Cup crowns in the 1970s, Moenchengladbach is languishing 
at the bottom of the league and faces an uphill battle to avoid relegation. 
In its last two games, Moenchengladbach was crushed 8-2 by Bayer Leverkusen 
and 7-1 by Wolfsburg. Rausch, 58, was hired in April and under his 
guidance the club escaped demotion in the final round last season. 
So far this season, Moenchengladbach has won one and lost eight of 
11 games, conceding 34 goals, by far the worst defensive record in 
the 18-team league. When it dominated the Bundesliga 20 years ago 
with its flamboyant, attacking style, Moenchengladbach produced such 
stars as Guenter Netzer, Rainer Bonhof, Jupp Heynckes and Berti Vogts, 
who resigned as national team coach after this summer's World Cup. 
Bonhof, who worked as Vogts' assistant and now is in charge of Germany's 
junior team, was named Rausch's successor. Bonhof was a member of 
Germany's team that won the 1974 World Cup title.
