The national highway traffic safety administration is reviewing whether 
more protection is needed for side-impact car crashes. An advocacy 
group says the current federal standard is too weak and petitioned 
the agency to impose tougher measures. The group says more than one-third 
of the serious injuries in accidents last year happened in side impact 
crashes. It's calling for better testing and side air bags in more 
American vehicles.
