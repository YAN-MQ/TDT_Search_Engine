Australian qualifier Wayne Arthurs upset second-seeded Karol Kucera 
of Slovakia 7-6 (7-5), 7-6 (7-4) in the dlrs 825,000 Stockholm Open 
Tuesday. In the second round, Arthurs, a doubles specialist, will 
face Todd Martin, a 6-1, 6-2 winner over Swiss qualifier Ivo Heuburger. 
Arthurs, ranked 168th in the world, stunned the seventh-ranked Kucera, 
who already has qualified for the ATP Championships in Hanover, Germany, 
this month. In the first-set tiebreaker, Arthurs took a 4-1-lead, 
before winning on his first match point. Arthurs appeared to falter 
early in the second set, dropping his service, giving Kucera a 2-0 
lead. But he recovered and won the second tiebreaker for the biggest 
singles victory of his career. ``My plan was to serve well, attack 
on Kucera's second serve and win at the net,'' the left-hander said. 
``I had nothing to lose. If I lost, nobody would care. If I won, everybody 
would be very surprised.'' Martin has played impressively the past 
few weeks. ``This is a good surface for me,'' said Martin, ranked 
22nd in the world. ``If I can repeat the level of play I have achieved 
in the last few weeks, I will certainly move up in the rankings next 
year.'' Martin reached the final in the 1996 Stockholm Open before 
losing to Thomas Enqvist. In other matches, France's Cedric Pioline 
defeated wild-card entry Andreas Vinciguerra of Sweden 6-3, 7-5 and 
Daniel Nestor of Canada beat Johan van Herck of Belgium 6-3, 7-6 (7-2). 
On Wednesday, top-seeded Pete Sampras begins play against Jason Stoltenberg 
of Australia.
