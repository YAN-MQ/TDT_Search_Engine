Cyprus urged the European Union Tuesday to push Turkey into helping 
end the division of the Mediterranean island and not obstruct the 
EU membership drive of the Greek Cypriots. Opening formal membership 
talks with the EU, Cypriot Foreign Minister Ioannis Kasoulides stressed 
his government's commitment to the ``search of a viable and just solution.'' 
Reunification of the island communities will also improve Greek-Turkish 
relations, he said. The EU also opened membership talks with Poland, 
Hungary, the Czech Republic, Slovenia and Estonia. All candidates 
must meet EU norms in 30-odd areas, the toughest being agriculture, 
environment, industrial policy and internal market. Cyprus' problems 
overshadowed Tuesday talks. The tone was set Monday with a joint statement 
by the Dutch, German and French governments questioning the wisdom 
of admitting Cyprus unless the Mediterranean island is first reunified. 
Kasoulides said the three should have addressed themselves to Turkey 
which has been criticized for hampering United Nations efforts to 
reunify Greek and Turkish Cypriots. Hungarian Foreign Minister Janos 
Martonyi said his country intends to join in 2002. ``There are no 
genuine points of dispute. This gives us hope that (entry in 2002) 
is possible.'' Though the EU is at pains to avoid fixing dates, conventional 
wisdom has it that first candidates will not join before 2004. Poland 
aims for Dec. 31, 2002, entry date. Its foreign minister Bronislaw 
Geremek, speaking of a Greek veto threat of other candidates if Cyprus 
is frozen out, told reporters: ``This must not become a European problem.'' 
He was ``optimistic ... there is a possibility for dialogue'' to resolve 
the Cyprus problem. The Netherlands, Germany and France said the division 
of Cyprus weighed on the island's membership chances as evidenced 
by the fact Greek and Turkish Cypriots have been unable to form a 
joint EU membership negotiating team. Turkey invaded the northern 
one-third of Cyprus in 1974 and installed a government, backed by 
30,000 troops. The government is only recognized by Turkey. ``I wish 
to reiterate once again that the government of Cyprus, despite the 
absence of positive developments and the hardening of the Turkish 
position, ... devotes all its powers and exerts all its efforts in 
search of a viable and just solution,'' Kasoulides told the EU foreign 
ministers. Sources said there was a fear in the EU of importing Greek-Turkish 
rivalry by admitting Cyprus and that once inside the EU Greek Cypriots 
_ the only government the international community recognizes on the 
island _ may hamper reunification and keep Turkish Cypriots out of 
the union. The EU ministers met in one-on-one sessions with their 
colleagues from the six candidate nations. ``The political will to 
push ahead with enlargement is shared on all sides,'' said German 
Deputy Foreign Minister Guenther Veheugen. Germany assumes the EU 
presidency in January. ``I reassured (the candidates) the new German 
government will push ahead with the enlargement process energetically.'' 
Other would-be EU members are Lithuania, Latvia, Slovakia, Romania 
and Bulgaria but they have been put in a second group of less-ready 
nations. On Monday, the leaders of Latvia, Lithuania and Estonia complained 
the EU moved so slowly it could destabilize the Baltic region. Lithuanian 
Prime Minister Gediminas Vagnorious warned of ``unnecessary tensions'' 
that could complicate relations with Russia.
