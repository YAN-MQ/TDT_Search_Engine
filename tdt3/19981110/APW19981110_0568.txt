Two of the Irish Republican Army's senior female prisoners were freed 
Tuesday in accordance with the historic Northern Ireland agreement. 
Martina Anderson of Londonderry and Ella O'Dwyer of Tipperary both 
received life sentences in 1985 in connection with bomb attacks on 
London and English seaside towns. Gerry Kelly, a senior figure in 
the IRA-allied Sinn Fein party, embraced both of the freed inmates 
outside Maghaberry prison west of Belfast, where women convicted of 
terrorist crimes are kept in their own unit. Kelly was convicted of 
London car bombs in 1972 and led a mass escape from Northern Ireland's 
Maze prison in 1983. More than 200 of an eligible 450 prisoners _ 
from both the IRA and outlawed pro-British paramilitary groups _ have 
already been paroled early as part of April's agreement on how Protestants 
and Catholics should jointly govern Northern Ireland. The releases 
are conditional on each group maintaining a cease-fire.
