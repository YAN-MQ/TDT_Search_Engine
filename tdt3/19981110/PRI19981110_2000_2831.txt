For today's Geography Quiz, we're off to the Pacific. Today's mystery 
country comprises 150 islands east of Fiji and ruled by a king. King 
Taufaa Hau Tupo IV is a royal heavyweight, though not quite so heavy 
as he was a couple of years ago when he tipped the scales at almost 
400 pounds. The king's gone on a diet since then, even inviting his 
subjects to join him in his belt tightening endeavor. King Tupo has 
shed some pounds but he still likes to throw his weight around. Today, 
for instance, he filed a legal protest against a Japanese travel agency 
for using his photo in an ad. Using the king's image for publicity 
purposes is illegal in his own country, and he doesn't much like it 
done overseas either. One last clue: This nation, also called the 
Friendly Islands, will be one of the first to welcome in the year 
2000. But you don't have to wait that long for our answer. We'll have 
it in a few minutes on PRI, Public Radio International.
