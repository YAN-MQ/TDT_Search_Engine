This look at your "CNN Headline News" weather begins with our forecast 
weather map for north America. And you can see the bad storm that's 
been producing blizzard conditions in the upper midwest, rainfall 
and severe weather all along the cold front as it moves through the 
east. As we go through the day tomorrow, that storm system continues 
to move rapidly through the east. And by tomorrow evening, most of 
the precipitation will be off the east coast. Windy conditions will 
move out of the Great Lakes area. But moving in behind this storm, 
some very cold weather. Some places in the Rockies, daytime highs 
only in the teens, 20s and 30s for much of the upper midwest, the 
plains states into parts of the far west. As far as the extended forecast 
is concerned, you can see on Thursday few snow showers linger in the 
Great Lakes area. Another storm system rolls in through the northwest, 
temperatures moderate somewhat, however. Rain showers continue to 
spread through the south as we move on into the weekend. And on Saturday, 
you can see rainfall, at least the threat of such, throughout much 
of the east. For more weather information, log on to CNN.com, four-day 
forecasts for 7,200 cities.
