After 17 years of tasting and testing mail-order food for the holidays, 
I think I have gotten choosing favorites down to something of a science. 
This year, more than 100 items arrived at my house (none were ordered 
under my own name). To make it into the finals, the food had to arrive 
when promised, be fresh, and intact. Of course, it had to taste great. 
And especially at these prices, the ingredients had to be real. Things 
made with margarine that are supposed to be made with butter were 
automatically eliminated. So were those that contain additives. This 
year, some Southern pulled pork was dropped because it contained monosodium 
glutamate. Products from 24 companies made the cut. Over the years 
I have learned that, with few exceptions, the best food tends to come 
from companies that are run by individuals whose personal reputations 
rise and fall on what they produce. The large companies often had 
some of the worst shipping problems. The final test came when 40 guests 
were invited to sample the finalists. Some of their favorites were 
no surprise: one was richer than the next _ a deep-dish apple-walnut 
sour-cream cake, and a handsome, intense chocolate truffle cake. Oh, 
someone complained that the salmon, cream cheese and caviar cake was 
messy to cut, but that didn't stop people from inhaling it. The unexpected 
favorite in this year's tasting was _ of all things _ maple fudge. 
Donna E. Shalala, the secretary of Health and Human Services, gave 
it her highest rating and then took home the leftovers. Here are some 
winners from 24 companies. The last date orders are accepted for Christmas 
delivery is included. The last date orders are accepted for Christmas
