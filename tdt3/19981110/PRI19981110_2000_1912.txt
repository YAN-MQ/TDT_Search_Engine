The International Red Cross is issuing another warning about the dangers 
of imminent famine in North Korea. Red Cross president, Astrid Hyberg, 
has just visited the country. She says the growth of many children 
has been impaired because of malnutrition. When we saw somewhat older 
children, and by that I mean children between the age of five to ten 
or maybe three to ten, quite many of them are dramatically stunted. 
A ten-year-old would look like a five-year old, and a five-year-old 
would look like a three-year-old. Astrid Hyberg. She says many in 
North Korea are now living on substitute foods made from acorns and 
grass, which have no nutritional value. She's warning diseases are 
likely to spread over the coming winter.
