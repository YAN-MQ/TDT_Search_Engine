the scramble for leadership is on among house republicans. last night 
newt gingrich had words every encouragement for the man likely to 
be his replacement as speak heer of the house. bob franken has more 
now. there they were, the outgoing speaker of the house newt gingrich, 
posing with appropriations committee chairman bob livingston, the 
man who helped push him out. in all probability, livingston's the 
incoming speaker. but they were at the gopac dinner, definitely newt 
gingrich turf. the gingrich message -- "no hard feelings, bob." let 
me say, without apology, that as speaker, i sought to aggressively 
lead toward our goals and our vision. if every republican will pull 
together with bob livingston, these big ideas will continue to move 
us forward. as gingrich sets sail into the private sector and livingston's 
effort to replace him seems to have clear sailing, the focus shifts 
to the other leadership races, particularly the battle against dick 
armey, the number two man as majority leader. army says he's way ahead, 
but ex-wide receiver steve largent isn't ready to take a pass. and 
jennifer dunn just got into the game. we have such a great opportunity 
now with to re-arrange the top leadership to pull in somebody like 
me who's been a leader, who is a communicator and can touch base with 
a lot of folks out there, the moms and dads out there in america, 
trying to hold down a job and balance their life by taking care of 
their kids. that's the kind of person we need, somebody who connects 
and translates our republican party principles into how they affect 
folks' everyday lives. others might jump in, but a key in dunn's planning 
may well have been a decision not to run by powerful deputy whip dennis 
hastert. ohio representative john boehner's job may also be in jeopardy. 
he's number four on the leadership ladder. j.c. watts, another former 
pro football player and the only african-american house republican, 
is among those who would like to knock him off. things are beginning 
to settle down a little, but for a while there in the last few days, 
one of the few house republicans who was not considering a run for 
a leadership post was newt gingrich. bob franken, cnn, capitol hill.
