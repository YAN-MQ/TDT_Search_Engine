If you're a certain age in America, say from 16 to 66, no doubt you've 
made a fool of yourself at some time to the beat of "Louie, Louie," 
one of the great all-time party songs. Okay so now name the group 
that recorded it. Well, at least you know they made lots of money, 
right? Wrong again. Here's NBC's Bob Faw. Louie, Louie Ah, yes, "Louie, 
Louie." You remember "Louie, Louie." Louie, Louie John Belushi performed 
it, so did at least 700 other groups. It was background music for 
the '60s, an anthem for party time everywhere. Musically, it's not 
much, but, said one critic, "leave it to your ears, your feet and 
emotions, and it's one of the greatest records ever made." It's completely 
inept. And it is also completely brilliant. In its conception. And 
"Louie, Louie" became a sensation back in 1963, mostly because the 
recording by four friends in Portland, Oregon -- the kingsmen -- Was 
so slurred, everybody figured it just had to be obscene. Indiana's 
governor actually tried to ban it. The garbled lyrics of our recording 
was interpreted by fraternities and various universities who came 
up with what they thought were the lyrics. An FCC official finally 
concluded "Louie, Louie" was "Indecipherable at any speed," but it 
went on to generate millions in sales. Trouble is, record companies 
saying ownership was unclear refused to pay the kingsmen any royalties 
until this week, when a Supreme Court decision awarded the group all 
future profits from the song. The decision sent shock waves through 
the recording industry. It sends a message to record companies, that 
when an artist knocks on their door and says "I'm owed royalties, 
you better investigate before you say no." No one knows how much money 
this means to the kingsmen, but as one of them put it, "we'll all 
have a very nice retirement." It's worth millions, folks. Three chords, 
a funky beat, nothing tricky. Just the sweet sound of justice, 30 
years late. Bob Faw, NBC news, Washington. That's right. That's the 
same song you heard all those mornings after. All those mornings with 
those hangover headaches.
