And when we come back -- NBC news "in depth." Wanted for questioning 
-- what does this anti-abortion activist know about the murder of 
a doctor who performed abortions. This is Max. He's a mighty dog. 
Pound for pound, he uses more energy than most dogs twice his size. 
That's why he gets new mighty dog carved beef in gravy. With the perfect 
balance of nutrients. Tender slices in savory gravy to give Max all 
the energy he needs. It'll make your dog... a mighty dog. New mighty 
dog carved beef and carved beef with pasta. Mighty dog... from friskies. 
One 3 layer wedding cake. Done! 3? Should be 6. Bayer can relieve 
arthritis inflammation. Tylenol can't. And taken regularly, Bayer 
can help save your life. ta da! Ask your doctor.
