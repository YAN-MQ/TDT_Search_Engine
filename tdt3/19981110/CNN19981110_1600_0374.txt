The Pentagon says thousands of national guard troops may join army 
forces helping to rebuild central America after hurricane Mitch. It 
says the national guard troops already were scheduled to go to Honduras 
in January for military exercises. Presidents of four central American 
countries are asking that their debts be forgiven and that the international 
community help them rebuild. Mitch is blamed for the deaths of at 
least 10,000 people.
