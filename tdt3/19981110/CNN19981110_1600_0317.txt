Safety experts say the increasingly popular "small" sport utility 
vehicles don't offer very good protection for their occupants. The 
insurance institute for highway safety put ten models through a 40

That was the Subaru forester. Four models were deemed acceptable -- 
Jeep wrangler, Suzuki vitara and grand vitara and Chevrolet tracker.
