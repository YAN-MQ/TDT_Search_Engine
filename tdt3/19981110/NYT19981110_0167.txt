NATIONAL FORECAST Hurricane force winds were recorded Tuesday on Mackinac 
Island near the juncture of Lake Huron and Michigan as an extraordinary 
strong storm bore through the Great Lakes and Upper Middle West. The 
potent autumn storm also brought blizzard conditions to the northern 
Plains and isolated tornadoes to the Mississippi Valley. Wednesday, 
very gusty winds from the west will import much cooler and drier air 
into the region as the formidable low pressure center moves into central 
Canada. Scattered morning showers will accompany the passage of a 
cold front moving through New England and the coastal Northeast on 
Wednesday morning. Behind the front, gusty winds from the southwest 
drying on descent from the Appalachians will cause skies to clear 
from Washington to Boston. Meanwhile, sinking air currents associated 
with high pressure will promote abundant sunshine and seasonable temperatures 
across the interior Southeast. Humid air impinging a slow-moving front 
will cause spotty showers and thunderstorms in northern Florida and 
along the Gulf coast. Partly to mostly sunny skies and ample sun will 
occur south of the front over south Florida. Clouds and a few flurries 
will form near a weak low pressure system over North Dakota on Tuesday 
while dry and sunny conditions occur farther south in the central 
and southern Plains. Farther west, valley showers and mountain snow 
will surround a jet stream disturbance moving through the southern 
Rockies. Behind the disturbance, intervals of clouds and sun with 
little risk for rain will prevail along the West coast. Focus: Power 
of Wind Early Tuesday, sustained winds of 85 mph buffeted the Mackinac 
Bridge, which connects Michigan's lower and upper peninsulas across 
the Straits of Mackinac. Peak gusts were clocked at 94 mph. In the 
morning, building gales associated with a powerful low pressure system 
forced the Mackinac Bridge Authority to escort high-profile vehicles 
across the bridge because the force of the wind on vans and sports 
utility vehicles was dangerously great. For each square foot of area 
of a high-profile vehicle that was exposed to a wind of 85 mph, nearly 
300 pounds of force were exerted.
