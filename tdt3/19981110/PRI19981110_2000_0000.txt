It's Tuesday, November 10th. I'm Tony Kahn. Today from Capitol Hill, 
thoughts about air strikes against Iraq. Also, second thoughts of 
debt relief for Central America, and unprecedented thoughts about 
violence in Northern Ireland. I think the children. I don't even think 
about that anymore. It's always in the back of our minds because we 
grew up with it. But the children don't have that fear. The troubles 
have stopped, and they're all looking forward. And from Martinique, 
concrete zuke to zuke love. First, this news.
