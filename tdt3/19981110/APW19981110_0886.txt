The bodies of a 4-year-old girl and her 64-year-old grandmother were 
found Tuesday after they went missing during the last weekend's floods 
in villages around Zagreb, the HINA news agency reported. The rains 
swelled the river Sava, which runs through Croatia from Slovenia to 
the northwest, and other local rivers, and water flooded fields and 
entered houses and barns in villages along the Sava. The girl, Josipa 
Jaglic, and her grandmother, Katarina, went missing on Sunday, as 
the river Kupcina flooded the village of Cagalj, 20 kilometers (12.5 
miles) southwest of Zagreb. The two went to harvest corn. Special 
police and divers were engaged in a two-day search. The two are the 
first known casualties of the floods. A 9-year-old girl also went 
missing in the same area, but no body has been found.
