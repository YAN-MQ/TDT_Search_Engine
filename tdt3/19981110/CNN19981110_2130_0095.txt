Folks in the midwest and the northern plains have their hands full 
with the first major snowstorm of the season. Blizzard-force winds, 
sub-zero temperatures and heavy snowfall have forced the closure of 
more than 600 miles of major highways. In Minnesota, the national 
guard is helping rescue stranded motorists in the southwestern part 
of the state, where as much as seven inches of wet snow has fallen. 
No travel is advised in southwestern or west-central Minnesota. And 
officials across the region are advising people to stay off roads, 
because of the treacherous driving conditions. At least two storm-related 
deaths are reported. The storm has knocked out power to thousands 
of people in Illinois. 65-mile-an-hour winds ripped roofs off homes 
tipped over mobile homes and forced flight cancellations at O'hare 
international. Temperatures in New Mexico are making both humans and 
animals shiver. More than a foot of snow fell across that state overnight 
causing numerous accidents and road delays. I-90 is shut down all 
the way from Ellsworth airforce base in South Dakota to Worthington, 
Minnesota, about 400 miles. All 252 miles of I-29 are also closed. 
To the south, the storm has turned to severe thunderstorms. Warnings 
are in place for Detroit, Chicago, cincinatti, Nashville, Memphis, 
birmingham and New Orleans.
