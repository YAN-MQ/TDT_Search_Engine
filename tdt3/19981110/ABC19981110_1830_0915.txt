The justice department is now offering a $500,000 reward for information 
leading to the sniper who killed Dr. slepian. The FBI's focusing on 
one man at the moment. Here's ABC's John Miller. In the computers 
and data bases that track most of us, Jim kopp barely exists. No credit 
cards, no property, no permanent home. For the past ten years, investigators 
say James Charles kopp has lived in the underground of the most radical 
fringes of the anti-abortion protest movement. But in police computers 
you can find kopp everywhere. He can be traced from city to city, 
and town to town, by his arrest record. All the charges are minor, 
and all stem from anti-abortion demonstrations. It was classic American 
nonviolent civil disobedience. Kopp with other protesters would chain 
himself inside abortion clinics. But the FBI believes he was also 
part of a much more sinister and violent group called the army of 
God. Kopp's car was also spotted by a neighbor near Dr. slepian's 
home two weeks before the doctor was murdered. Since then, investigators 
have been looking for clues that might link to acts of violence. I 
would ask you to please part away so the employees may enter this 
building without being obstructed. Police do know kopp was one of 
hundreds arrested in anti-abortion demonstrations in 1988. Police 
believe the most militant core of the demonstrators formed the army 
ogod in jail. The FBI says kopp took the name atomic dog, the name 
that police found listed in the army of God handbook. In Canada, three 
abortion doctors have been wounded by sniper fire. The army of God 
claimed responsibility for one of the shootings. Was kopp in Canada? 
Reporters at the Hamilton spectator believe kopp is the same man who 
hand-delivered disturbing anti-abortion literature to the paper for 
nine months. The paper received another package after Dr. slepian's 
murder. That one contained a picture of Dr. slepian's face that had 
been exed out. Yesterday, the Hamilton spectator received that has 
also been -- in two countries. John Miller, ABC News, New York.
