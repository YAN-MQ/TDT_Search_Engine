Thank you very much, Breck. Two more banks have failed in Kenya, bringing 
to five the number of banks that have gone under in the past two months 
because of cashflow problems. Sonya Lawrence Green reports from Nairobi. 
Kenya's Central Bank has frozen the operations of two small banks: 
City Finance Bank and Prudential Bank. In September, three other banks 
were closed or put in receivership: Bullion Bank, Reliance Bank, and 
one of Kenya's 20 biggest banks, Trust Bank. The five banks failed 
to meet their financial obligations to depositors and to the clearinghouse 
which handles transactions between banks. Most of the banks have made 
bad loans and were having severe cash flow problems. The Central Bank 
was forced to step in and has now appointed managers for all five 
failed banks. It set out tough conditions if any of troubled banks 
want to reopen. First, the bank must hire a new director, new chief 
executive, and replace most of its senior management. Then 80 percent 
of depositors must agree in writing to a rescue package for the bank. 
The depositors will join the Central Bank and shareholders in choosing 
a new board of directors. The bank must also employ independent financial 
auditors, repay all overnight borrowing from other banks, repay insider 
loans, and raise enough cash to operate properly. The bank failures 
have caused a mini-crisis of confidence among Kenyans. They started 
a run on deposits at the City Finance Bank, hastening its collapse. 
Just a few years ago, several other banks closed down. They were the 
so-called political banks, those with corrupt ties to politicians. 
In a special report, the Central Bank said African countries must 
make some changes to avoid a crisis like the one in Asia. They must 
streamline their economies and open their markets. They must eliminate 
corruption, free exchange rates and interest rates, and make sure 
that banks are run openly and honestly, and authorities must go out 
of their way to calm investors and the public to avoid panic. Sonya 
Lawrence Green for VOA News, Nairobi.
