A German woman who was sought as a terrorist in Germany, was killed 
by Turkish troops on Oct. 22, after she was caught with a group of 
39 Kurdish People's Freedom Army members, a Kurdish information office 
said Tuesday. According to a statement from the Kurdish Information 
Center in Cologne, Andrea Wolf was captured along with 24 other members 
of the Kurdish group and shot after short questioning that revealed 
she was a German. The Foreign Ministry in Bonn said Sunday it was 
investigating reports by Der Spiegel and Focus magazines that said 
Wolf had been captured and killed in southeastern Turkey. Kurdish 
rebels have been fighting in southeastern Turkey for over a decade 
for autonomy. Spiegel of Hamburg said this weekend that Wolf, 33, 
had been killed on Oct. 24. While Focus of Munich said she had been 
captured in September. German authorities were seeking Wolf as a suspect 
in the 1993 bombing of a prison by the leftist Red Army Faction gang 
at Weiterstadt south of Frankfurt.
