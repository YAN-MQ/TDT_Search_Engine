Ask a studio mogul, top producer or agent for the names of the superior 
screenwriters in Hollywood, and Steven Zaillian will be near the top 
of the list. ``He's one of the two or three best screenwriters in 
town, and I'm being liberal when I say that,'' said Joe Roth, chairman 
of Walt Disney Studios, which made ``A Civil Action,'' the newest 
film written and directed by Zaillian. ``There's an economy and clarity 
to his writing that's always entertaining.'' Zaillian, who won an 
Academy Award for his adaptation of ``Schindler's List,'' is a surprisingly 
diffident, almost modest and entirely un-Hollywood figure. In contrast 
to other screenwriters, who may earn lavish sums but complain all 
the way to the bank about their plight at the hands of producers, 
stars and executives, Zaillian, 45, shrugs off any problems he has 
faced over his 18-year career. ``Maybe I've been lucky,'' he said 
one recent morning as he sat drinking coffee on the patio of a house 
in Mandeville Canyon where he and his small staff were editing ``A 
Civil Action.'' ``I mean, not every script I've worked on has turned 
out the way I've wanted them to turn out,'' added Zaillian. His screenplay 
for ``Awakenings'' (1990) earned him an Academy Award nomination, 
and he also wrote such films as ``The Falcon and the Snowman,'' ``Mission 
Impossible'' and ``Clear and President Danger.'' But, he went on, 
``If you're going to write and not control it then, somehow, you've 
got to expect that sometimes it's going to turn out different than 
you thought. Sometimes worse. And sometimes better, if the director 
is, like, really good and brings something to it,'' Zaillian said. 
``A Civil Action,'' adapted by Zaillian from the Jonathan Harr nonfiction 
legal drama that was on The New York Times best-seller list for two 
years, opens in New York and Los Angeles on Dec. 25, in order to qualify 
for Academy Award nominations, and then will open nationwide in January. 
The movie deals with an eight-year fight by working-class families 
in Woburn, Mass., who claimed that two large corporations had contaminated 
their town's drinking water with chemicals, causing the deaths of 
five children and one adult. The central figure in the film is Jan 
Schlichtmann, a self-possessed personal injury lawyer who becomes 
consumed with the case at the cost of virtually everything else in 
his life. The film stars John Travolta as the lawyer and Robert Duvall 
as his highly skilled adversary. Also in the cast are William H. Macy, 
Tony Shalhoub, Zeljko Ivanek, Kathleen Quinlan, John Lithgow, Sydney 
Pollack and Kathy Bates. Zaillian said he had first read the book, 
in manuscript form, when one of the producers, Rachel Pfeffer, sent 
it to him. ``I didn't know if it would make a movie at all,'' he said. 
``I had to write the script to see if I could make sense of what was 
1,200 pages of manuscript. It was a wonderful book, but what was troubling 
about it for a movie was the sheer length of it, the number of characters, 
and it wasn't a whodunit. It was more about the process of the law 
_ and is that dramatic?'' Zaillian smiled. ``Also, there was the fact 
that everybody loses, at least on the face of it,'' he said. ``That's 
not usually the typical movie fare. It's a tragedy. I mean, that was 
the thing that we all had to keep in mind. I mean, it's really kind 
of remarkable that the studio let us do it.'' Zaillian said he had 
handled the adaptation much the way he had dealt with ``Schindler's 
List,'' the Thomas Keneally novel based on the Holocaust. For both 
screenplays he rigorously concentrated on the main character and avoided 
the pitfalls of trying to tackle the enormity of the historical circumstances. 
In ``Schindler's List,'' for example, about a German profiteer who 
saves the lives of more than 1,000 Jews during World War II, Zaillian 
would have been overwhelmed as a screenwriter if he had decided to 
take on the Holocaust. ``I wanted to focus on Schindler, and Schindler 
alone, and imagine events almost entirely through his eyes,'' Zaillian 
said. ``It's such an imposing subject that you can be overwhelmed 
by trying to tell too much of it and having too many angles on it. 
The point was to follow him, just follow him, stick with him, and 
what he learns about the subject, you learn. The same is true of this 
one.'' In shaping the script for ``A Civil Action,'' Zaillian said, 
the environmental drama and the legal story, and even the human tragedies, 
were secondary to the story of one man's obsession with the case. 
``It's ultimately his story,'' he said. Zaillian is far more ambivalent 
about directing than screenwriting. His directorial debut, in August 
1993, was a gentle family drama with an unfortunate title, ``Searching 
for Bobby Fischer,'' which was far less about chess than about a family's 
relationships. Few films opened that summer with higher critical praise, 
but it proved a box-office disappointment. Zaillian shrugged. ``Sure, 
it's a bit depressing,'' he said. ``It's sort of like you work really 
hard on something for a long time and it lasts two or three weeks 
and you think, `I'm going to kill myself.' It's too much work not 
to have people see it, although the funny thing about `Bobby Fischer' 
is, almost everybody I meet has seen it, and not just people in the 
industry. Maybe it's the bargain matinee. Maybe it's the video.'' 
He said the sheer difficulty of being a director had surprised him, 
and that was why it took him so long to take over another project. 
``I wasn't prepared for how hard it was _ I was spoiled by the life 
style of a writer,'' he said. ``Being a director you face the pressure, 
the hours, the staying focused for six straight months or much longer 
on one thing, just so focused with a lot of money being spent. It 
took a lot out of me, and I didn't want to do it again. I just wanted 
to write a couple of scripts after that.'' Zaillian does not see screenwriting 
as something to be taught with specific rules. ``It's the same as 
any other kind of writing: it just has to be good, the ideas have 
to be clear and the writer has to convey them in a way that's interesting, 
and it doesn't matter whether it's a screenplay or novel,'' he said. 
And he is loath to analyze what makes a great screenplay. ``You hear 
about these books and courses on screenwriting,'' he said. ``On page 
20 something has to happen. The character arc and all that stuff. 
I have no idea. I don't think about those things. Every time I do 
it, it feels like the first time and I'm scared and I don't know if 
it's going to turn out. And if I get to page 50 or so and I'm not 
enjoying it, then I know it's not working.'' ``The tone of the movie 
is the magic thing for me,'' he said. ``That's like the big battle. 
The tone and the voices and how people sound. The level of realism. 
That's what matters to me.'' Scott Rudin, one of the producers of 
``A Civil Action,'' said of him: ``There's not one wasted moment in 
the way he tells a story. And there's a compassionate strain in his 
writing that most people don't come close to. The way he directs is 
exactly the way he writes. It's about the accumulation of detail; 
it's very methodical, very empathetic and very compassionate.'' Zaillian, 
who is married and has two sons, grew up in Los Angeles. His father, 
Jim Zaillian, who died in 1980, was a radio news reporter. After he 
graduated from San Francisco State University in 1975, an interest 
in making documentaries led him to a series of low-level film editing 
jobs. Then a script he wrote in 1979 called ``Bad Manners,'' about 
high school boys in the late 1960s, caught the attention of Ray Stark's 
producing company. Soon, Zaillian was being hired to write scripts. 
``For a long time I wouldn't call myself a writer, it was so hard 
to say the word,'' he recalled. ``I would say, `I write.' But I didn't 
consider myself a writer until I did three or four. I kept thinking 
it was going to end and it wouldn't last.'' Asked about his unfortunate 
experiences, Zaillian said without hesitation, ``Jack the Bear.'' 
This strange 1993 comedy-drama starring Danny DeVito was about the 
unraveling of a television horror show host whose psychopathic neighbor 
poses a threat to children. ``People got hired and it just got taken 
away from me,'' he said. ``I don't want to bad-mouth anybody; these 
things happen. But it so upset me that I said to Scott Rudin, who 
I've known for a long time, `I want to do this again, write another 
thing about kids, but do it right.' And that's how `Bobby Fischer' 
happened.'' Besides being relatively modest, Zaillian is also surprisingly 
loyal, at least by Hollywood standards. Although any of the major 
talent agencies would welcome the high-priced Zaillian as a client, 
he has remained loyal to Harold Greene, his first agent, who is now 
in his mid-80s and who runs a one-man agency in Marina del Ray, Calif. 
``If I'm missing something, I don't know what it is,'' Zaillian said, 
smiling: ``I always think I'm working on the best things that are 
being done out there. I haven't worked on anything because I needed 
the money or done something that I didn't believe in.''
