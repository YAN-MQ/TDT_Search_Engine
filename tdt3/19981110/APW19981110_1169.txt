Brazilian superstar Ronaldo will be on the starting lineup of Internazionale 
Sunday as his latest knee injury was not as serious as initially feared. 
Club doctors said Tuesday that the young Brazilian striker, who limped 
off the field with a bruised left knee during last Sunday's Inter-AC 
Milan Serie A match, is going to resume training Wednesday and will 
play the next league game against Sampdoria of Genoa. He will miss, 
however, Wednesday's third-round second-leg of the Italian Cup against 
Castel di Sangro. ``Medical examinations showed Ronaldo's knee did 
not suffer any serious damage,'' doctor Piero Volpi said. The Brazilian, 
who has been off to a troubled season because of tendinitis in both 
knees, was injured following a tackle by AC Milan Danish midfielder 
Thomas Helveg. Before leaving the field, at the end of the first half, 
Ronaldo scored the opening goal in the 2-2 draw between the two crosstown 
rivals. It was Ronaldo's third goal in two and a half league games. 
Ronaldo's uncertain form has been cited as one of the major problems 
affecting Inter Milan, currently seventh in the 18-team league standings, 
seven points behind leader Fiorentina.
