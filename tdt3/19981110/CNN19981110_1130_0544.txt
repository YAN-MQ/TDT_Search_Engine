the international red cross says north korea could face an even greater 
catastrophe if something isn't done soon about the food shortage. 
floods and drought have devastated the country's crops since 1995. 
the result -- famine, malnutrition and disease. rebecca mackinnon 
reports. the grain harvest in north korea is almost finished, but 
the hunger continues. these pictures were taken by a team from the 
international red cross, who recently traveled to north korea to inspect 
the harvest. to prevent starvation, north koreans are making what 
they call "substitute food" -- biscuits and noodles made from grain 
mixed with husks, grass, and acorns, usually fed to cattle. this contains 
50% cattle food, and this contains 70% of cattle food. and really, 
you wouldn't produce this and this has been produced for years now, 
if there was not a dire need. the red cross team found that malnourishment 
remains common. the harsh diet wreaking havoc on people's digestive 
systems. hospitals are relying on traditional korean treatments like 
acupuncture and herbal medicines. they have nothing else. they don't 
even have enough food. this woman is too malnourished to produce milk 
for her child. the harvests have been if i can't say catastrophic, 
then at least very bad also this year. this is a long-term problem, 
and it needs a long-term solution. it's not something that is being 
changed in a year or two. if there's a light at the end of the tunnel, 
it's still very faint, and far away. international aid agencies say 
this year's harvest will cover only two-thirds of what north korea 
needs to feed its people, which means the cycle of famine looks set 
to continue. rebecca mackinnon, cnn, beijing.
