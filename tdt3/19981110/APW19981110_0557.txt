Dutch farmers whose slow-growing cucumbers have been causing them 
headaches may have found a solution _ aspirin. For the cucumbers, 
that is. Scientists with the respected Dutch research institute TNO 
have discovered that feeding aspirin to young cucumber plants helps 
prevent thickening of the root walls. Plants with thick root walls 
absorb water and minerals less easily than those with thin root walls, 
leading to slower growth. ``Aspirin doesn't remove the cause of the 
thickening, but it reduces the level of damage,'' plant physiologist 
Sjoukje Heimovaara told the Algemeen Dagblad newspaper for Tuesday's 
edition. Aspirin contains an acid also made naturally by plants to 
protect themselves. No trace of the aspirin, which was fed to plants 
in a solution, was found in the cucumbers themselves. A Dutch farmers' 
organization is investigating whether the active ingredient in aspirin 
can be registered for use to protect their cucumbers. Until it is, 
farmers won't be allowed to prescribe it to their plants. Researchers 
also are planning to extend their experiment to eggplants, tomatoes 
and peppers.
