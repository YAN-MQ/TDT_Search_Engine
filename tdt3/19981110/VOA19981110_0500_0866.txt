Major league baseball pitcher Carrie Wood is probably singing that 
song that comes around the holidays in the United States, "It's the 
Most, Wonderful Time of the Year." All right, break out your Andy 
Williams collection, dust it off, I know. Nobody plays records anymore. 
I like the cracks and popples. But anyway, Carrie Wood was named Rookie 
of the Year in the National League. The Chicago Cubs' right-handed 
pitcher tied a Major League record with 20 strike outs in just his 
fifth start this past season. He edged Colorado Rockies first baseman 
Todd Helton in the annual balloting of baseball writers and broadcasters. 
Wood received 128 points from 16 first place votes and was the only 
player listed on all 32 ballots. Wood says that he's very honored 
to be included with some of baseball's best pitchers. I'm glad to 
be a part of that group. It's a great honor, you know, the guys that 
have won this award in the past and they're great players and they 
had great carriers. And, you know, hopefully I can continue my career 
and have a good one. Wood finished the season with 13 wins and six 
losses and a 3.40 earned run average. A sprained right elbow ended 
his regular season on August 31st.
