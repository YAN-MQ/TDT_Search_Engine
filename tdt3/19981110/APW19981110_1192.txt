Rolling Stone Mick Jagger would like his 14-year-old daughter to give 
up her budding modeling career and stick to her homework, his wife 
Jerry Hall says. This summer, some fashion writers wondered aloud 
if Elizabeth Jagger was old enough to be on the catwalk as she appeared 
in shows by top designers like Thierry Mugler and Vivienne Westwood. 
She makes her cover debut on the front of the December issue of the 
upmarket British magazine Harpers and Queen, to be published Thursday. 
In an interview in the same issue, her mother said Jagger is ''furious'' 
about Elizabeth's modeling and wants her ''to concentrate on her schoolwork.'' 
''He says it's really silly as she doesn't need the money,'' said 
Ms. Hall, herself a model. ''But I tell him, almost every schoolgirl 
wants to be a model,'' Harpers and Queen quoted her as saying. The 
tall blonde Texan said she put off letting Elizabeth model as long 
as possible _ but gave in after model scouts ''who had no idea who 
she was kept coming up to her and giving her cards.''
