And in other U.S. news, a federal appeals court has upheld the dismissal 
of a civil lawsuit filed by victims of the Oklahome City bombing, 
who had sued the company that made fertilizer used to make the deadly 
bomb. Plaintiffs had alleged that ICI explosives had failed to safeguard 
against their ammonium nitrate product used by terrorists. Last year, 
a U.S. district court ruled there was insufficient evidence to prove 
the company was negligent. The ruling came after company officials 
testified they had sold their product legally and that no one could 
have foreseen the deadly events of April 19th, 1995.
