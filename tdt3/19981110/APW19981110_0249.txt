Chinese police have arrested more than 140 members of underground 
Protestant churches and beat their leaders in what a church campaigner 
warned is a new crackdown on worship outside state control. The worshipers 
were arrested at meetings in underground, or house churches _ so-called 
because they often use private homes _ on Oct. 26 and Nov. 5 in two 
separate places in central Henan province, according to a letter from 
a church campaigner. After jailing the worshipers, police ``cruelly 
beat'' at least 13 identified as leaders, and their fate was unknown, 
said the letter dated Monday and released Tuesday by the New York-based 
Human Rights in China. ``These two acts of religious persecution are 
not isolated. Even greater religious persecution will unfold over 
the next two months,'' said the letter, written by David Zhang, a 
self-styled spokesman for China's house churches. A police official 
in Wugang County _ site of 40 of the arrests on Oct. 26 _ said police 
moved to shut down an illegal meeting and began hauling people away 
only when they resisted. Some even shot at the officers with homemade 
rifles, said the official, who gave only his surname, Wang. Officials 
in Nanyang city, where the other arrests were made, refused to comment, 
as did China's Religious Affairs Bureau, which oversees religious 
policies. Although Chinese leaders have shown a willingness to discuss 
religious tolerance with U.S. President Bill Clinton, U.N. human rights 
chief Mary Robinson and other Western dignitaries, police intimidation 
of house churches persists. China forbids worship outside of institutions 
approved by the state _ in the case of Protestants, the China Christian 
Council. But as two decades of free market reforms discredited communist 
ideology and loosened the Communist Party's hold over people's lives, 
the number of religious believers has soared. Although the China Christian 
Council claims worshipers number 11 million, estimates by missionaries 
and members of the unofficial church run as high as 80 million. While 
many Chinese Protestants and state-ordained ministers worship in both 
legal and house churches, the underground church movement tends to 
be more evangelical. The meetings in Henan attracted followers from 
all over China, said the letter released by Human Rights in China. 
In Wugang, police arrested people from 16 provinces, said county police 
official Wang. According to the letter, police surrounded the gathering 
at night on Oct. 26 in Liuwan village outside Wugang city and then 
suddenly attacked, taking away Han Rongqin, Cheng Meiying and nine 
other leaders of the house church movement. On Nov. 5, 100 kilometers 
(60 miles) to the northeast, police in Nanyang city broke up a house 
church service and arrested leaders Lu Lianquan and Zhang Fushan along 
with more than 100 worshipers, said the letter. Despite the persecution, 
``we believe the Chinese government will one day realize that Christianity 
is a stabilizing effect on Chinese society, that the faith of China's 
house churches is pure and its believers are patriotic,'' the letter 
said.
