A massacre in September in which 19 men, women and children were fatally 
shot in a driveway in Baja California was a result of a drunken argument 
between the chieftains of two rival marijuana-smuggling gangs that 
turned violent, the authorities said Tuesday. In the murders on Sept. 
17 in a seaside suburb of Ensenada, the authorities had previously 
identified a victim, Fermin Castro, as head of a gang that specialized 
in guiding drug planes to desert airstrips. The officials added that 
he was the main target. Tuesday, in their most ambitious effort to 
clarify the killings, the authorities said witnesses had told them 
that a rival of Castro who headed another smuggling group, Lino Quintana, 
visited Castro's house Sept. 17, intending to collect a drug debt 
and steal a load of marijuana stored there. Quintana and his armed 
colleagues were drunk and high on cocaine, their talk with Castro 
turned violent and the gunmen dragged Castro's family and two neighboring 
families from their beds, said the federal attorney for Baja California, 
Gen. Jose Luis Chavez, said at a news conference. The victims were 
piled in a heap in the driveway and shot to death. Beyond asserting 
that the killers were intoxicated, the authorities did not try to 
explain what had provoked the attack, one of the bloodiest drug-related 
killings in Mexico. But Jose Luis Ramos, a senior aide to Attorney 
General Jorge Madrazo, said the government's account ``completely 
clarified the crime.'' Three people have been arrested, Chavez said, 
but Quintana is at large.
