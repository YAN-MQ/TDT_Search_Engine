The head of the Colombian Air Force, General Jose Manuel Sandoval, 
has resigned. That's after nearly $13 million worth of cocaine was 
found in a Colombian military transport plane at Ft. Lauderdale airport 
in Florida. The plane had more than six hundred kilos of cocaine hidden 
in its fuselage when it arrived from a military airport near Bogata.
