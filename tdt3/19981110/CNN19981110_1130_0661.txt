do you find yourself reaching for soda with every meal? the center 
for science in the public interest says soft drinks have become the 
standard beverage for millions of americans. this consumer watchdog 
group says when american teens consume too many soft drinks it can 
affect their health. soda pop is the quintessential junk food. candy 
in a can. liquid candy, call it what you will, it is junk. it is devoid 
of nutrients except for calories. the national soft drink association 
says there's no reason to stir up consumer alarm about a product it 
calls "perfectly safe and enjoyable." the cspi says an occasional 
soft drink is fine. but making soda the only thing you drink just 
isn't nutritious.
