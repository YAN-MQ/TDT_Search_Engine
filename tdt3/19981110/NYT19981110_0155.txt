Almost all the rice grown in California is ``sticky rice,'' the mostly 
short-or medium-grain varieties that clump together when cooked. Besides 
being the appropriate rice for sushi and other Japanese dishes, sticky 
rices make ideal rice cakes and add a heftier texture to rice salads. 
Like all members of the subspecies japonica, these rices contain high 
levels of the starch amylopectin and low levels of amylose, the other 
starch in rice. Rices like Basmati or Southern-style long-grains, 
also known as indica rices because they originated in India, have 
low levels of amylopectin and high levels of amylose, meaning they 
cook up drier. In their cookbook ``Seductions of Rice'' (Artisan, 
1998), Jeffrey Alford and Naomi Duguid offer instructions for making 
Japanese-style rice. First, rinse the rice with cold water several 
times before cooking to remove excess starch; otherwise the rice will 
be too sticky. When the water runs clear, let the rice sit in a sieve 
for 20 to 30 minutes, absorbing the water that clings to it. Using 
one and a sixth cups water for each cup of rice, put the rice and 
water in a heavy medium-size pot, uncovered, and turn the heat to 
high. When the water reaches a vigorous boil, cover and reduce the 
heat to medium-low. Cook for 5 minutes, then reduce the heat to very 
low and cook 10 more minutes. Remove from the heat, and let stand 
for 10 minutes before serving. Do not uncover or stir the rice at 
any point before serving. Sticky rice should feel tacky _ that is, 
adhesive enough to form a convenient clump when herded by a pair of 
chopsticks, but not gooey or mushy. Each grain should be plump, shiny 
and distinct. ``It should be toothsome,'' said Rocco DiSpirito, executive 
chef at Union Pacific in Manhattan. ``You want it slightly chewy, 
with a little springiness in it.''
