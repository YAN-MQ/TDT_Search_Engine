Two longtime creative executives who worked at big agencies producing 
campaigns for big brands such as Diet Coke and Kentucky Fried Chicken 
have quietly opened their own small shop. Frank DeVito and Betty Fitterman, 
who held senior positions at Young &AMP; Rubicam Advertising, SSC&AMP;B, 
Lintas Worldwide and Ammirati Puris Lintas from the 1970s through 
the mid-1990s, are now partners at DeVito Fitterman Advertising in 
New York. The fledgling agency is handling accounts and projects with 
billings equivalent to an estimated $35 million for clients of all 
sizes: large (Johnson &AMP; Johnson), medium (Franklin Electronic 
Publishers Inc.) and small (the American Society of Composers, Authors 
and Publishers, or Ascap). The opening of DeVito Fitterman seems an 
exception to the pervasive trend that has been reshaping Madison Avenue: 
agencies becoming bigger to serve their continuously growing clients. 
But advertising sometimes follows physics in that an action can generate 
an equal and opposite reaction. DeVito Fitterman represents ``a counterflow,'' 
said DeVito, an art director, ``in that while major corporations are 
thinking globally, at the same time they're asking for fresh thinking.'' 
``Some big marketers are establishing separate, special funding for 
projects,'' he added, which are often awarded to ``people like us, 
who can bring big thinking to them separate from their roster agencies.'' 
And small can be beautiful in other ways, according to DeVito. ``I 
like it,'' he said, smiling, ``when the client calls and says `What 
happened to our ad?' and you know what ad he's talking about.'' Even 
so, said DeVito, 60, he remains respectful of the dominance that large 
shops can assert over their smaller counterparts. ``Don't ever count 
out the big guys,'' he said, adding that competing against them ``is 
what makes it fun.'' Ms. Fitterman, 51, a copywriter, listed what 
she called the ``many benefits'' of working at a big agency. ``You 
get a broad view, you work on lots of accounts and the idea you have 
in the shower on Sunday morning can go around the world,'' she said. 
``That's exciting.'' ``But we felt it was time to move on and do our 
own thing,'' she added. Ms. Fitterman left Ammirati Puris in 1996, 
a year after DeVito. She had been a senior vice president and executive 
creative director and he had been a vice chairman and the chairman 
of the agency's worldwide creative council. ``I was not getting the 
personal reward out of the job that matched the monetary reward,'' 
DeVito said, adding: ``The last year, I was in 38 countries. It was 
fun and exciting, but often lonely, waking up in the morning in a 
hotel room where you don't know where you are and don't know where 
the bathroom is.'' Ms. Fitterman said that after leaving Ammirati 
Puris, ``I decided never to go back into advertising again.'' She 
paused, then added, ``That lasted between six and nine months.'' ``One 
day the phone rang,'' Ms. Fitterman continued, ``and it was Frank. 
He said `Let's do this,' and I said `Yes.' And he said, `Do you mean 
it?''' The start-up of DeVito Fitterman was smoothed, DeVito said, 
by the fact that both principals were ``financially secure'' after 
departing Ammirati Puris. ``And thank you, Mr. Geier, who helped us 
do that,'' he added, laughing. The reference was to Philip H. Geier 
Jr., chairman and chief executive of Interpublic Group of Cos. in 
New York, which owns Ammirati Puris and directed the skein of mergers 
that created the agency from shops including SSC&AMP;B and Lintas 
Worldwide. DeVito and Ms. Fitterman discussed their agency in a recent 
interview, the first they have given since incorporating DeVito Fitterman 
in June 1997. Their initial client, Johnson &AMP; Johnson, hired them 
to create corporate brand advertising. The two ``met over a J&AMP;J 
ad'' at Y&AMP;R in the late '60s, Ms. Fitterman recalled; DeVito left 
for SSC&AMP;B in 1984 and she followed a year later. DeVito Fitterman 
continues to handle the corporate J&AMP;J assignment, which has so 
far included emotional print advertisements for a special issue of 
Newsweek magazine devoted to ``Your Child from Birth to 3'' as well 
as warm and fuzzy television commercials focused on events like Mother's 
Day and Father's Day. The campaign is centered on the word ``touch,'' 
carrying such themes as ``Your touch and Johnson &AMP; Johnson, all 
the care in the world.'' In contrast, sassy humor is the hallmark 
of a campaign introduced last month for Franklin, which awarded DeVito 
Fitterman the consolidated assignment to develop product advertising 
that also burnishes the Franklin brand image. For example, print ads 
for Rex, a line of small electronic organizers, compare Rex with oversized 
electronic and paper organizers by urging consumers to ``Lose weight 
... fast!'' And a poster showing a Rex tucked into a bikini bottom 
describes the gizmo as a ``hip new organizer.'' Andy Cross, president 
and chief executive at Franklin in Burlington, N.J., praised DeVito 
and Ms. Fitterman for offering ``big-company sophistication in a small-company 
package.'' ``The campaign just started to break,'' Cross said in a 
telephone interview, ``but we're already getting calls and e-mail 
from people saying they love the ads.'' ``I've admired Frank's work 
for a number of years,'' he added. ``He used to do Diet Coke advertising 
and I used to be vice president of marketing at Pepsi.'' DeVito said 
a soft-drink account is high on the list of wannahaves for DeVito 
Fitterman; the self-described ``beverage junkie'' has worked on brands 
like Canada Dry, Dr Pepper and Heineken in addition to Diet Coke. 
``You pour it,'' he said, ``I've done it.'' The agency is also pursuing 
accounts in such categories as airlines, financial services and health 
care.
