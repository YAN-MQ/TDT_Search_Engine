The word is perhaps any time the pieces are in place now, the threats 
have been issued, the Iraqi people have been warned to expect a possible 
U.S. air strike anywhere from the next several hours to days. We'll 
have complete coverage here this evening. A bizarre series of on-air 
phone calls to MSNBC by O.J. Simpson defending himself on air after 
coverage of his own custody battle. And meet the new C.I.A. recruiting 
on college campuses, advertising for help out in the open. The not 
so secret spy business boldly entering the 1990's. Tonight, a first 
of its kind look inside the agency. Good Wednesday evening to you. 
As we go on the air, a formidable collection of military hardware 
is heading to the Persian gulf for another in what has become sporadic 
series of attacks to Iraq. This time it's for real, and that the order 
could go out at any time. How will this time differ from the last 
time? What have the Iraqi people been told? Was President Clinton's 
warning today his final word on the subject? We will have the answers 
to those questions during this broadcast tonight. In addition, we 
will take a look at what's being reported for tomorrow morning's newspapers 
around the world.
