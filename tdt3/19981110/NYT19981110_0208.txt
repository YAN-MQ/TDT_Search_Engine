At a glance, the just-released four-CD ``John Lennon Anthology'' looks 
very much like an ambitious collectors' trawl. Lavishly packaged and 
copiously annotated, this ``Anthology'' (Capitol) brims with studio 
outtakes, concert performances, private composing tapes and assorted 
spoken bits _ 94 selections in all. The thriving bootleg market has 
proved that the Beatles, collectively and individually, have a following 
that voraciously snaps up material of this kind. But satisfying the 
quasi-musicological obsessions of collectors is not the primary purpose 
of this set. ``Anthology,'' compiled by Yoko Ono, Lennon's widow, 
is less a freestanding record release than an installment in a continuing 
multimedia biography. It joins a mountain of CDs, videotapes, material 
for film documentaries and radio series, picture books, collections 
of Lennon's writings and art works _ that Ms. Ono has released, overseen 
or sanctioned since Lennon was murdered on Dec. 8, 1980. This body 
of posthumously released work is an object lesson in the building, 
polishing and maintenance of the myth that envelopes a cultural icon. 
Outside the world of pop music, one sees similar treatment accorded 
to Lennon's neighbor at the Dakota apartments, Leonard Bernstein. 
Soon after Bernstein's death in 1990, his children and his production 
company, Amberson, began arranging commemorative concerts and documentaries, 
reissuing classic television appearances and encouraging performances 
of newly published, authoritative editions of his works. An official 
Web site and a newsletter keep the world abreast of these developments. 
Many pop stars fare less well. Since the death of Elvis Presley in 
1977, RCA has reissued his recordings by the boxful, the Postal Service 
has memorialized him on a stamp, and there have been several books 
and documentaries, not all of them sympathetic. But he left no legacy 
of self-defining interviews, and with no one seeing to his posthumous 
image, he has become an amorphous figure _ an overdeveloped larynx 
attached to an increasingly dissolute body. On Lennon's behalf, Ms. 
Ono has projected a carefully defined picture of a musician, peace 
campaigner, husband and father, a man with a complex temperament and 
an equally complex sense of humor. In her liner notes for the ``Anthology,'' 
in fact, Ms. Ono begins with an almost novelistic physical description: 
``In person, John was a much more attractive man than the one you 
saw in photos and films. He had very fair, delicate skin and soft, 
sandy hair with a touch of red in it when the light hit it a certain 
way.'' Then, after describing the moles on his forehead, the gracefulness 
with which he carried himself, and his personal magnetism, she adds: 
``His slumming, clowning and acting the entertainer was just a kind 
of play acting he enjoyed. But it was obvious to anybody around him 
that he was actually a very heavy dude: not a prince, but a king.'' 
This is hagiography, certainly; yet Ms. Ono pointedly avoids making 
Lennon into a plaster saint. Even if she were so inclined, his life 
was too thoroughly documented for that, and doubtless Lennon would 
have loathed the idea. So her notes discuss bad times as well as good, 
and touch on his angry, stubborn, indiscreet and remarkably inconsiderate 
sides. She describes, for example, an incident in which Lennon had 
sex with another woman at a party while Ms. Ono and the other guests 
waited in the next room. Telling that story follows a principle of 
myth-making that goes back to ancient times: an iconic figure's flaws 
put his virtues in high relief. Granted, as popular culture icons 
go, Ms. Ono has plenty to work with: Lennon's work with the Beatles 
guarantees him a constituency. But it is Lennon's post-Beatles work 
that Ms. Ono is most vigorously promoting, and the audience for that 
has always been shakier, because the work itself was uneven. At its 
worst _ the batch of topical broadsides that made up the ``Sometime 
in New York City'' double album _ it is workaday and expendable. Even 
Lennon regarded it that way. His best music, though, is incisive, 
abrasive and hard-hitting. Many of the songs on his best albums, ``John 
Lennon/Plastic Ono Band,'' ``Imagine'' and ``Double Fantasy,'' are 
also intensely personal. It is not lost on Ms. Ono that for the personal 
songs to live, listeners must remain curious about the circumstances 
that led Lennon to write them. Hence the constant stoking of the Lennon 
story: if either his music or myth were not constantly in the public 
eye and ear, his post-Beatles music might fade into 1970s oldiedom. 
This is why Ms. Ono has not opposed the use of Lennon's music and 
image in advertisements, to the chagrin of Lennon's most ardent and 
idealistic fans. Hearing him sing ``Revolution'' in a Nike ad or seeing 
him portrayed, along with Einstein, Gandhi and Bob Dylan, in Apple 
Computer's ``Think Different'' pantheon, serves a purpose beyond the 
hawking of someone else's product. Lennon himself was a championship-level 
promoter of his work and ideas. When world peace became his pet project, 
in 1969, he turned his honeymoon with Ms. Ono into a Bed-In for Peace, 
news media invited. To reporters who asked why, he said that since 
the news media were reporting on his marriage anyway, he might as 
well use the occasion to get his message out. Thereafter, he periodically 
promoted his albums with interviews that were so expansive that several 
were published as books, in question-answer form. Lennon's volubility 
on a range of issues, and his uncanny ability to tap into the the 
spirit of the times made him a spokesman for his generation. But his 
pronouncements and his penchant for elaborate self-explanation have 
been equally useful in death: however much has been written about 
him, his image is now not radically different from what it was during 
his life. Still, images of the famous are rarely permanently fixed. 
As time passes and biographers a generation or two removed take up 
the story, the focus inevitably shifts. Even now, Ms. Ono is hardly 
the only shaper of Lennon's myth. A raft of insiders has weighed in 
with books, among them Lennon's sister (Julia Baird's ``John Lennon: 
My Brother''), his closest childhood friend (Pete Shotten's ``John 
Lennon In My Life''), his lover during an 18-month separation from 
Ms. Ono in the early 1970s (May Pang's ``Loving John''), his tarot 
card reader (John Green's ``Dakota Days'') and two of his personal 
assistants (Anthony Fawcett's ``One Day At a Time'' and Frederic Seaman's 
``Last Days of John Lennon''). Independent biographies have ranged 
from the scholarly (Jon Wiener's ``Come Together'') and the respectfully 
balanced (Ray Coleman's ``Lennon''), to the openly hostile (Albert 
Goldman's ``The Lives of John Lennon,'' which portrays Lennon as a 
violent, musically inept junkie). Judging from the discussion of Lennon 
and his music on the Internet in recent years, most readers touch 
on these extremes and either reject one outright or create a dialectic 
of their own. What does ``Anthology'' add to the Lennon story? Breadth 
of detail and sharpness of focus, mainly. We've known since the Beatles' 
first news conferences that Lennon had a quick wit, but here a selection 
of parodies (several of which skewer Dylan) offer a more private view 
of how Lennon's humor functioned. A series of alternately jokey and 
tense exchanges with record producer Phil Spector, recorded during 
the sessions for the 1975 ``Rock-and-Roll'' album, convey the ambiguities 
in that peculiar relationship. One of the unreleased songs, ``Serve 
Yourself,'' eviscerates the born-again religious sentiments of Dylan's 
``Gotta Serve Somebody.'' Given the number of comparatively tame, 
expletive-free versions of this song available on bootlegs, it is 
striking that Ms. Ono has released this one, by far the best, but 
also the harshest and most cutting version Lennon recorded. Also among 
the home tapes are Lennon's unadorned recording of ``Real Love,'' 
a song the other former Beatles fleshed out for their own ``Anthology,'' 
and ``Life Begins at 40,'' a country tune that was one of several 
here that Lennon wrote for Ringo Starr. The studio outtakes, along 
with some shaky early run-throughs, include a seemingly inebriated 
Lennon doing his version of the Ronettes classic ``Be My Baby,'' a 
discarded take of ``I'm Losing You'' with Cheap Trick as Lennon's 
backing band, and a lovely account of ``Imagine,'' in which a harmonium 
supports the piano. The four disks divide Lennon's work along mostly 
chronological lines, beginning with sessions recorded in England soon 
after the Beatles' breakup, then moving through the heavily political 
New York years, the ``lost weekend,'' as Lennon called his separation 
from Ms. Ono, and a group of recordings made in 1979 and 1980, as 
he prepared to return to public life after five reclusive years. (For 
non-archivists, most of the best material is included on a highlights 
disk, ``Wonsaponatime.'') This will not be Ms. Ono's last word on 
Lennon. There is a sufficient supply of outtakes and home recordings 
_ some more interesting than those included here _ to draw on for 
future releases. There is also some unreleased performance video, 
and Ms. Ono recently signed a contract to tell their story (again) 
in a film. One hopes, though, that she is also thinking in grander 
terms. However unvarnished her portrait of Lennon may be, so long 
as it remains the official portrait, there will always be questions 
about its completeness. There was talk, a decade ago, of a Lennon 
museum, a rock star's version of a presidential library, where researchers 
would have access to correspondence, recordings and other memorabilia. 
Ms. Ono must at some point loosen her hold on this material, and when 
she does _ when biographers have these resources at their disposal 
_ the Lennon myth will take on a life independent of her. It will 
still be an interpreted myth, of course: biographers decide what to 
include and what to leave out, just as Ms. Ono has. But distance, 
emotional and temporal, often brings clarity. THE PACKAGING OF AN
