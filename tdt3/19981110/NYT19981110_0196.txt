In a classic comedy routine long ago, Mel Brooks and Carl Reiner theorized 
that the original seven astronauts parading before the public were 
actually male models, hired by a PR-minded NASA to camouflage the 
fact that it had such ``ugly little astronauts.'' In the aftermath 
of its election disaster, the Republican Congress seems to be trying 
out the same strategy. ``I have a smile on my face,'' declared Steve 
Largent, the football star turned Oklahoma congressman as he told 
Larry King of his aspiration to topple Dick Armey as House majority 
leader. ``What the Republican Party needs so desperately is ... new 
fresh ideas, fresh faces. ...'' Well, Largent is a fresh face, and 
he is smiling, and he has a better chance of landing in a J. Crew 
catalog spread than Armey does. But there is no more difference between 
his political ``ideas'' and Armey's than there is between those of 
Newt Gingrich and his milder successor, Robert Livingston. As recently 
as July, Largent was on TV railing against homosexuality as a ``sin'' 
and saying ``there is no middle ground'' on abortion. Does he really 
think no one will go to the videotape? Largent's views are precisely 
those that helped cost his party the year's key races. Religious-right 
candidates backed by Gary Bauer and Ralph Reed couldn't win even in 
the Deep South. On the coasts, the victors Chuck Schumer and Gray 
Davis successfully impaled Al D'Amato and Dan Lungren on their efforts 
to reverse Roe vs. Wade. It was also in California, always a snapshot 
of the political future, that Matt Fong's campaign against a vulnerable 
Barbara Boxer went into meltdown after the revelation of his contribution 
to the homophobic Traditional Values Coalition. John Ashcroft, the 
Missouri senator aspiring to be the religious right's presidential 
candidate, stumped for candidates in four primary states this year 
_ and all four lost. In Colorado, home to James Dobson's Focus on 
the Family, even a supposedly slam-dunk ballot initiative outlawing 
``partial birth abortion'' went down to defeat. The happier, slimmer 
faces of the new GOP leadership, all of them talking about ``pragmatism'' 
and ``compassionate conservatism,'' are giving only new form to this 
same old content. Trent Lott and Tom DeLay, both to the right of Newt, 
remain in place. The token woman running against Largent, Jennifer 
Dunn, has a far worse record on abortion rights than her predecessor 
in that role, Susan Molinari. The sole black face that may join the 
team, J.C. Watts, is not for nothing a perennial favorite of Pat Robertson's 
Christian Coalition. Over at the Republican Leadership Council _ the 
organization that champions New Republicans exemplified by the GOP's 
many successful, socially moderate governors _ the feeling is that 
it may take another election to sort their riven party out. In 2000, 
the Ashcroft-Bauer-Forbes right will go up against the McCain-Alexander 
middle, and George W. Bush, for now a telegenic tabula rasa who is 
all things to all people, will have to define himself far more clearly, 
one way or the other, if he chooses to stand in the crossfire. Al 
Gore _ or any Democrat _ will push the GOP candidate to the wall on 
cultural issues just as Davis and Schumer did Lungren and D'Amato. 
Meanwhile, these issues are hardly going to go away. Like the far 
left of the '60s, the far right of the '90s has an active terrorist 
wing. Anti-abortion and anti-gay crimes are rising. The '98 campaign 
took place against the backdrop of the murders of Matthew Shepard 
and Barnett Slepian, as well as the manhunt for Eric Rudolph, charged 
with bombing abortion clinics and a gay nightclub along with Atlanta's 
Olympic Park. ``The leaders of the party will have to find a way to 
lower the rhetoric and dismantle the hate apparatus'' of this fringe, 
said Lewis Eisenberg, the Republican Leadership Council's chairman. 
Yes they will, but the new faces trotted out in Washington, however 
prettier than Armey and Newt, can't do it. The story of this election 
is not in the old, soundly defeated ideas hiding behind the Ken-doll 
grin of Steve Largent but in the upset victory of former wrestler 
Jesse (the Body) Ventura. Surely it wasn't his looks that attracted 
large numbers of women and young voters, but it may have been in part 
his muscular libertarian stands for both gay and abortion rights.
