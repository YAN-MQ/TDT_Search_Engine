Coming up, a new South African nightmare on PRI. You're listening 
to Public Radio, 91 FM, WHYY. Later tonight at on TV 12, Public Television, 
you'll see part one of the two part documentary by filmmaker Ken Burns 
about the life of Frank Lloyd Wright. The Burns documentary explores 
the life of one of America's greatest architects hated by some and 
worshipped by others. That's at 9:00 tonight, part one of Frank Lloyd 
Wright on WHYY, TV 12. That's followed at on TV 12 by "Crown and Country, 
Sandringham, A Royal Home." Edward Windsor goes home to Norfolk where 
the royal family traditionally spends Christmas. So that's the lineup 
for TV 12 starting at 9:00 tonight on Public Television, WHYY.
