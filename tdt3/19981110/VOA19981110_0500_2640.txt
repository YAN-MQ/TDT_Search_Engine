That's right, Barbara. You know, I'm just looking at the ticker and 
Intel is up 1-1/8th but it's not following the rest of the market. 
It is following with the NASDAQ composite is doing. That's up about 
two points. But the big blue chips, they're down 30 points on the 
Dow Jones Industrial Average, and the Standard & Poor's 500 is down 
about 3-1/2 points just a small fraction of a change in the S&P. The 
dollar is mixed in New York trading but it continues to strengthen 
against the Japanese yen. It's now passed the 122 mark. You may remember 
just a couple of weeks ago, it was trading at 112 to the dollar. One 
big third quarter profit report expected today and it's now out. Wal-Mart, 
a Dow Jones component stock, one of those 30 big blue chips, reports 
profits more than $1 billion for the second quarter in a row.
