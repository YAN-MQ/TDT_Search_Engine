There was another urgent warning today about the year 2000 computer 
bug. The problem is even more complicated and will be more expensive 
to fix than anyone had expected. The warning results from a worldwide 
survey done by the biggest computer consulting firm in Europe. Here's 
ABC's Ned Potter. With only 416 days to go, the new survey says it's 
too late to head off all the problems. All we can do now is make sure 
that the essentials, such as vital phone systems, don't crash, that 
assembly lines are not stopped by the computers that control them, 
that power companies not only have plans to keep running, but have 
tested them. What really matters to us on January 1, 2000, is that 
the lights go on, and central heating works. The survey says U.S. 
and European firms will have to spend $858 billion updating their 
computer systems. That's half the economy of Germany, and the number's 
gone up 20% in just six months. Economists say the U.S. is far better 
prepared than other countries. But in today's wired world, one computer 
crashing on new year's day, 2000, can take many others down with it.
