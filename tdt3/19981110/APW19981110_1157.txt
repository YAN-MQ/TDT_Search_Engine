As Fiorentina officials were preparing to appeal the team disqualification 
from the UEFA Cup, renowned movie director and Fiorentina supporter 
Franco Zeffirelli called for a nationwide protest against the decision 
of Europe's highest soccer authority. ``It was an unfair decision 
... and all Italian soccer fans should take a strong stand against 
UEFA, which took a wrong decision,'' Zeffirelli told the Italian news 
agency ANSA. The Florentine team, the current league leader, was kicked 
off the European competition Sunday as a punsihment for the explosion 
that injured a match official and caused the suspension of the Fiorentina-Grasshoppers 
UEFA Cup game in Salerno last week. The game was suspended at half 
time, with Fiorentina leading the second-leg 2-1 and 4-2 aggregate. 
Fiorentina officials are appealing the UEFA decision on the grounds 
the team was playing on a neutral field and that the device was thrown 
into the field by a Salerno resident, in hate for the Florentine team. 
Fiorentina's appeal is likely to be heard by UEFA this weekend. ``By 
qualifying Grasshoppers, UEFA has sent a message to many crazy minds: 
that you can embezzle a sport with a criminal act ... Fiorentina can't 
be punished for the behavior of a rival fan,'' Zeffirelli told ANSA.
