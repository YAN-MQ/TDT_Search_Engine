Sales of passenger cars and commercial vehicles in the Philippines 
in this year's first 10 months fell 55 percent from a year earlier 
to 29,493, an industry association announced Tuesday. The Chamber 
of Automotive Manufacturers of the Philippines Inc. attributed the 
sharp decline to tight credit. Banks have raised interest rates and 
become very selective with loan approvals since the regional financial 
crisis began in July 1997. In October alone, sales of passenger cars 
and commercial vehicles fell 57 percent to 1,981, the association 
said.
