The White House says the message to Iraq leader Saddam Hussein is 
that all options remain open and that he should cooperate fully with 
the U.N. inspectors. Iraq says it wants a diplomatic solution to the 
crisis, but White House spokesman Joe Lockhart says there is nothing 
to negotiate. I think that there are both public and private channels. 
I would repeat, though, that this is not a situation where we're looking 
for negotiation. There's nothing to negotiate. Meanwhile, Iraq says 
it will not bow to U.S. threats of force.
