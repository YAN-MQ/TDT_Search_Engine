In a much-anticipated event, Newt Gingrich spoke to his supporters 
Monday night at go-pac, an organization he once headed. It was his 
first speech explaining his decision to resign as speaker of the house. 
Bob Franken has the details from Washington. There they were, the 
outgoing speaker of the house Newt Gingrich, posing with appropriations 
committee chairman Bob Livingston, the man who helped push him out. 
In all probability, Livingston's the incoming speaker. But they were 
at the go-pac dinner, definitely Newt Gingrich Turf. The Gingrich 
message -- "no hard feelings, Bob." Let me say, without apology, that 
as speaker, I sought to aggressively lead toward our goals and our 
vision. If every republican will pull together with Bob Livingston, 
these big ideas will continue to move us forward. As Gingrich sets 
sail into the private sector and Livingston's effort to replace him 
seems to have clear sailing, the focus shifts to the other leadership 
races, particularly the battle against Dick Armey, the number two 
man as majority leader. Army says he's way ahead, but ex-wide receiver 
Steve Largent isn't ready to take a pass. And Jennifer Dunn just got 
into the game. We have such a great opportunity now with Newt Gingrich's 
deciding to step down to put together a team that is going to show 
some fresh faces to folks out there that wonder what republicans stand 
for. Others might jump in, but a key in Dunn's planning may well have 
been a decision not to run by powerful deputy whip Dennis Hastert. 
Ohio representative John boehner's job may also be in jeopardy. He's 
number four on the leadership ladder. J.C. Watts, another former pro 
football player and the only african-American house republican, is 
among those who would like to knock him off. That was CNN's Bob Franken 
reporting.
