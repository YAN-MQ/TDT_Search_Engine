Tibet's exiled spiritual leader, the Dalai Lama, who is seeking to 
open talks with China on autonomy for his homeland met a few hours 
ago with President Clinton. Correspondent Debra Tate reports the White 
House visit was kept low key to avoid angering Beijing with Mr. Clinton 
dropping in on a meeting between the Dalai Lama and first lady Hillary 
Clinton. Following the meeting, the Dalai Lama told reporters Mr. 
Clinton briefed him on his talk with Chinese President Jiang Zemin 
in Beijing last June during which Mr. Clinton appealed to Mr. Jiang 
to open talks with the Dalai Lama. The White House visit came despite 
a warning from Beijing just hours earlier that it could damage U.S.-China 
relations. The Chinese foreign ministry issued a statement saying 
the Dalai Lama is intent on gaining independence for Tibet. It is 
an argument the Dalai Lama denied in a written statement, but he said 
he supports autonomy for the Tibetan people. Speaking to reporters, 
he kept his comments to a minimum. It is sometimes, you see, more 
open discussion is useful. Sometimes more silence is useful. So I 
feel that it is better to remain low key. The Dalai Lama expressed 
his appreciation for Mr. Clinton's efforts toward peace and reconciliation 
on the Tibetan matter. Debra Tate, VOA News at the White House.
