This is meteorologist Valerie Voss with your "CNN Headline News" weather 
forecast through Tuesday. An area of low pressure will move through 
the western Great Lakes region, actually in a northward direction, 
drawing cold air behind it, pulling warm air up in front of it. Meanwhile, 
behind it, several inches of snow are in the forecast for the upper 
midwest. It will be windy throughout this system. A second system 
pushes into the west, with more rain and mountain snow as well. Tuesday's 
highs will range from the 30s over the northern Rockies and northern 
plains, to 70s and 80s across the far southeast. Looking ahead to 
Wednesday, rain moves into the northeast, with some thunderstorms 
farther south, with rain and snow in the west again. On Thursday, 
a rain and snow mix through the Great Lakes, with some thunderstorms 
out into the southern plains. Friday, it's pretty wet in the eastern 
half of the country and still cold through the north central U.S.
