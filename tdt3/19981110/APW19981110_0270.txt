Iraq has executed 125 political prisoners arrested during and after 
a failed uprising in southern Iraq following the 1991 Gulf War, a 
human rights group said Tuesday. The executions, which included those 
of three Egyptians, took place in the infamous Abu Ghraib prison west 
of Baghdad in early October, said a statement from the London-based 
Center for Human Rights of the Iraqi Communist Party. The group listed 
the names of the executed prisoners which included 29 military men, 
some in the elite Republican Guards and the Iraqi air force. The others, 
it said, are mostly from the southern Shiite Muslim towns or Kurds 
from the north. Southern Shiites and Kurds staged an unsuccessful 
uprising against President Saddam Hussein's regime after the Gulf 
war. In a statement faxed to The Associated Press in Cairo, the human 
rights group listed the names of two colonels, one lieutenant colonel 
and a major in the Republican Guards. It gave the names of 13 Iraqi 
air force officers with ranks up to lieutenant colonel. The group 
said the three Egyptians, Isam Awadallah Hamdi, Mubarak Rushdi Makawi, 
both from Assiut, and Fathi Abdel-Saheb Matlab of Cairo, were executed 
for ``supplying information to an enemy country.'' There was no way 
to independently confirm the report. There have been repeated reports 
of executions and widespread arrests by Saddam's regime to silence 
its opponents. In April, the U.N. human rights commissioner responsible 
for Iraq, former Dutch Foreign Minister Max van der Stoel, said as 
many as 1,500 people may have been executed in Iraqi prisons and elsewhere 
last year. ``The new massacre is another chain in a series of executions 
and mass killings which the ruling regime started since last autumn 
in what it termed the campaign for cleansing the prisons,'' the group's 
statement said. Iraq's former labor minister, Abdel-Aziz Mohammed 
Saleh al-Sayegh, in the first public admission of prison overcrowding, 
told a Baghdad newspaper in March that Iraqi prisons hold five times 
their capacity of inmates. Al-Sayegh was fired by Saddam on May 11 
with no reason given. The London-based group also said another Egyptian, 
Hamed Marai Abdel-Aziz, is waiting a similar fate in cell number 31 
in the prison. Prison authorities have handed the bodies of only three 
high-ranking officers to their families for burial, while the rest 
were buried by the Abu Ghraib municipality in a mass grave on October 
8 near the dairy factory in the area, the statement said.
