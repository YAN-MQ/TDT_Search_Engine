House majority leader Dick Armey is facing a challenge for his seat. 
Representative Jennifer Dunn declared her candidacy yesterday. She 
joins Oklahoma representative Steve Largent in a bid for the seat. 
Dunn, a Washington state republican, says she plans to bring a new 
face to house leadership and focus on the country's needs. Out of 
this last election, the one thing we picked up is the people didn't 
know what we stood for. What is the message? So I think we have a 
bright opportunity to rearrange the top leadership of the house, to 
pull someone in like me who's been a leader, who understand teamwork, 
who is a communicator, who can touch base with a lot of folks out 
there, the moms and dads out there in America who are trying to hold 
down a Job and balance their life by taking care of their kids. Today 
California representative Howard Buck McKeon will not enter the race 
for house majority leader and he's backing Dick Armey army.
