matt yallof, "cnn headline sports." kordell stewart used the monday 
night stage to perform like a champ at three rivers. the steelers 
qb threw for a touchdown and ran for another as pittsburgh built a 
24-0 halftime lead on green bay. the pack made it interesting late, 
scoring the final 20 points of the game before falling short 27-20. 
it was just one of those nights, man. you would love to have the opportunity 
to play like that way every week. he came out from the word go. you 
know, he was poised, confidant. and he threw the ball real well. and 
i think that's really what set everything up.
