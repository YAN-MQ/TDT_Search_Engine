This look at your "CNN Headline News" weather begins with our forecast 
weather map for Wednesday morning. The bad storm that's been producing 
blizzard conditions in the upper midwest rapidly moves off to the 
north and east and the cold front associated with it, that's been 
producing severe weather, moves very rapidly towards the east coast 
of the United States. During the day on Wednesday, that front should 
be moving off the east coast. However, by late in the day, still scattered 
showers from Maine to Florida. Behind it, much cooler air sliding 
in in association with the high-pressure center. In the west, a much 
weaker storm comes moving through. Your forecast for high temperatures 
tomorrow indicates very chilly conditions behind the storm. You can 
see that some places in the Rockies will see highs only -- only in 
the teens. We move ahead and take a look at your extended forecast. 
On Thursday, temperatures moderate. Some rain is possible in parts 
of Texas. As we move on to Friday, that rain in the south spreads 
eastward. And as we head on into Saturday, you can see rainfall is 
expected in the eastern portion of the country and in the great northwest.
