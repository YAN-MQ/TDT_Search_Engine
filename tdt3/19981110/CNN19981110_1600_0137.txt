It's still fall, but much of America is already getting a full dose 
of winter weather. A storm armed with strong winds, snow and rain 
is making for treacherous road conditions in the midwest and central 
plains. Hundreds of miles of highway have been closed from Nebraska 
to Minnesota, as have schools across the region. Nearly 1 foot of 
snow has fallen in Minnesota, which officials say has caused nearly 
200 traffic accidents, one of them fatal. Another storm-related death 
was reported in South Dakota. The storm dumped up to two feet of snow 
in the Colorado Rockies, and knocked out power for thousands of people 
around Durango. In the extreme southwest corner of Colorado. Outages 
are also reported from Nebraska and South Dakota, into Illinois and 
arkansas. Officials in the dakotas say there are hundreds of stranded 
vehicles along the interstate, and people are being warned to stay 
off the roads. A 400-mile stretch of interstate 90 has been shut down 
from western South Dakota to Worthington, Minnesota. We'll have more 
on the winter - storms in the extended weather forecast at eight past 
the hour.
