This is PRI, Public Radio International. Wouldn't it be great if you 
knew who was going to be on "Fresh Air" tomorrow, not to mention "Radio 
Times," "Talk of the Nation," "Morning Edition," and more? Well, your 
wishes have been answered, because now 91 FM will send you that information 
automatically every day by electronic mail. To subscribe, visit the

The Web site is located at whyy.org. Once again, that's whyy.org. 
I'm Tony Kahn. Ahead on THE WORLD, in Northern Ireland, breaking with 
the past, a drive to bring Catholics and Protestants together in the 
workplace. In South Africa, breaking in. An epidemic of home burglaries. 
And in Martinique, breaking out. A new wave of zuke music gets them 
dancing cheek to cheek. First, this news.
