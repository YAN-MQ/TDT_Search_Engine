The Baltimore Orioles increased their payroll by 14 percent to a baseball 
record $71.86 million this year but staggered to a losing record. 
The New York Yankees raised their payroll by 1 percent and won the 
World Series. These and other economic and on-field developments were 
reflected in a payroll report the owners' Player Relations Committee 
presented Tuesday to the general managers at their annual meetings. 
The report did not paint a pretty picture for most of the teams. The 
Orioles' position at the head of the salary standing was not enough 
to catapult them into the playoffs. What it did, however, was make 
them the biggest underachievers in major league history. No one has 
ever spent so much and received so little in return. The Yankees, 
on the other hand, had the best year any team could hope to have with 
their 125 total victories, and they did it by increasing their payroll 
from $65 million to $65.6 million. They also paid $8.2 million for 
other players whom they traded, acquired or released, but that money 
is not included in the traditional method of payroll tabulation used 
by the owners and the players, who will release their report next 
month. Besides the Orioles, the Florida Marlins and the Montreal Expos 
showed the most remarkable figures. The Marlins slashed their payroll 
from $53,515,000 last year, when they won the World Series, to $15,141,000 
this year, a drop of 72 percent. The Expos plummeted 55 percent to 
a major league-low $8,317,500, a payroll unheard of in this day of 
escalating salaries. The overall escalation was not steep. With some 
post-season award bonuses still to be added, the average major league 
salary was $1,377,196, a 4.78 percent increase from last year, when 
the $1,314,420 average represented a 19.33 percent increase. The clubs 
spent more than $1.23 billion on their payrolls this year. The salary 
standing did not differ greatly from the won-lost standing. Teams 
that spent the most generally had winning records; those that spent 
the least generally had losing records. More specifically, of the 
13 teams that had payrolls over $48 million, the Orioles were the 
only one with a losing record. Of the 17 teams with payrolls under 
$48 million, only St. Louis and Toronto had winning records. Commissioner 
Bud Selig has acknowledged that this payroll disparity is the biggest 
problem facing baseball. It is a topic the general managers have been 
discussing at their meetings this week. The Mets were one of the high-spending 
teams with a winning record. Their payroll soared by 49.6 percent, 
to $58.66 million. They have already committed $47.56 million for 
next year. The Yankees have committed $42.95 million for 1999. The 
Indians' payroll for next season already stands at $62.67 million, 
more than this year's $59.54 million. Looking ahead to salary arbitration, 
which always sends salaries soaring higher, the Player Relations Committee 
and the Players Association determined the players with two to three 
years of major league service who will be eligible for arbitration, 
which otherwise requires three years of service. The player among 
the 13 fortunate players who will benefit the most is Rick Helling, 
the Texas pitcher, who was a 20-game winner this year. He earned $216,500 
while winning those 20 games but can expect at least a $3 million 
salary next year.
