From National Public Radio News in Washington, I'm Corey Flintoff. 
The first big storm of the year swept across the northern plains in 
the Midwest today bringing snow, rain, and high winds. The winds knocked 
out power to thousands of homes and businesses. Joyce Russell reports 
from member station WOY in Ames, Iowa. Meteorologists say the low 
pressure located over Southern Minnesota is the strongest reported 
in 25 years and it's causing wind gusts of near hurricane strength. 
Across Iowa, roofs were blown off buildings and the wind has made 
north/south travel on some roadways nearly impossible for high profile 
vehicles. The storm produced snow in much of Iowa, Minnesota, and 
Nebraska, and that's continuing to create blizzard conditions. The 
high winds are now beginning to reach Wisconsin and Illinois. Highway 
authorities are discouraging travel. Some roadways have been closed 
because of reduced visibilities due to blowing snow. Forecasters predict 
the storm will strengthen as it moves into Southern Canada. For NPR 
News, I'm Joyce Russell in Ames, Iowa.
