Central American nations ravaged by Hurricane Mitch should be granted 
a moratorium on international debt payments, Britain's top treasury 
official said Tuesday. Gordon Brown, the chancellor of the exchequer, 
also said Britain was prepared to contribute 10 million pounds (dlrs 
17 million) to a proposed World Bank trust fund. ``The needs of the 
central American countries are now being heard throughout the world 
and we want to do what we can and play our full part with the rebuilding 
of the economies,'' Brown said. ``We are proposing to the World Bank 
that a new trust fund be set up to help the central American economies 
and we are prepared to contribute 10 million (pounds). ``We also believe 
a new facility should be created to help rebuild the shattered economies 
and that what we proposed for post-conflict economies in Africa we 
want also done for these economies as well.'' Britain was also proposing, 
in a letter to the World Bank, ``suspension of world debt payments 
so that countries are given the best chance to rebuild,'' Brown said. 
Backing Brown's plea for a debt moratorium, the government of the 
Irish Republic said it was doubling its emergency funding for Central 
America, to 400,000 pounds (dlrs 640,000). ''The capacity of heavily 
indebted countries such as Nicaragua and Honduras to meet their debt 
obligations is now hopeless,'' said Liz O'Donnell, a government minister 
responsible for overseas development. She said total debt in the region 
now is some dlrs 17 billion. The Disasters Emergency Committee Appeal 
for Central America, representing 11 British aid agencies, said members 
had already received aid requests from the region in excess of 5 million 
pounds (dlrs 8.5 million). Britain's Ministry of Defense said 1,400 
Royal Navy and Royal Marines personnel were helping distribute aid 
in Nicaragua and Honduras.
