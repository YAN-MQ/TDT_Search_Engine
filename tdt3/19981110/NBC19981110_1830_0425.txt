U.S. warships are on the move toward the Persian gulf tonight, in 
yet another sign that a military strike against Iraq may happen, and 
soon. Joining me with the very latest from the White House is NBC's 
David Bloom. David? What are you hearing there? Tom, tonight at the 
White House, the Drums of war are starting to beat a little louder. 
Today, the secretary of defense explicitly warned Iraq that "time 
is running out." Tomorrow, in a veteran's day speech, President Clinton 
plans to make the case for why a "very substantial" attack on Iraq 
may be in the offing. After meeting again today for an hour and a 
half with his national security team, the president telephones world 
leaders to gauge their support. White House aides insist Mr. Clinton 
has not yet given the go-ahead for cruise missile and airstrikes. 
But defense secretary Cohen orders a second U.S. aircraft carrier 
and 2,200 marines to speed their deployment to the gulf. The military 
option is certainly still on the table. But in the ten days since 
Saddam Hussein ordered U.N. weapons inspectors to stop their work, 
U.S. officials have given conflicting signals. Some insist an military 
attack is not imminent. NBC news has learned President Clinton has 
asked the CIA to answer, among other questions, these two -- is Iraq 
amassing civilians to act as human shields, and if so, where? And, 
is Iraq making any threatening moves to take U.N. personnel hostage 
in the event of an attack, U.S. officials say the answer to both of 
these questions appears to be no. But that may be because Iraq is 
not taking them seriously. David Bloom at the White House tonight.
