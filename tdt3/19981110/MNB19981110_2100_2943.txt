When we come back here tonight, prompted mostly by an emotional movie 
and an nostalgia for half a century ago, this field of headstones 
is increasingly a touch stone for those who made it out alive. The 
scratchy throat he left with this morning is raw so sore it hurts 
to swallow. Teddy gibbs toughs it out through a cough that gets more 
and more ragged. Now he's desperate for relief. New theraflu sore 
throat and cough. With the first sip of that soothing cherry hot liquid 
he feels comfort on contact. Soon he feels the soreness melting away 
-- his cough calmed. New maximum strength theraflu sore throat and 
cough.
