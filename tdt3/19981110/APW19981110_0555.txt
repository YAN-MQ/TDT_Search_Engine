The Constitutional Court rejected Tuesday a defense argument raised 
by lawyers for a Kuwaiti editor sentenced to prison for publishing 
a joke deemed insulting to Islam. The attorneys for Mohammad al-Saqar, 
editor of the independent daily Al-Qabas, claimed that the 1961 publications 
law under which he was convicted contradicts the constitution. In 
the joke printed in Al-Qabas, a teacher asks his students: ``Why did 
God kick Adam and Eve out of heaven?'' A student answers: ``Because 
they hadn't paid the rent.''
