It has been almost three weeks since Binyamin Netanyahu and Yasser 
Arafat signed the wye river peace deal as it's known, although the 
Israeli cabinet finally ratified it today. The ministers added a string 
of conditions even with those conditions attached, the deal won approval 
from only eight of 17 ministers. It's seen as a political blow for 
Netanyahu. The Israeli parliament is expected to vote on the deal 
next Tuesday. His attempts to make Jonathan pollard part of the peace 
deal almost cost President Clinton his C.I.A. director. An administration 
official says that when Netanyahu asked for the release of pollard, 
George Tenet became concerned that Mr. Clinton might actually say 
yes, and a source close to Tenet tells NBC news that he threatened 
to quit. Pollard, a former U.S. naval intelligence officer, is serving 
a life sentence for stealing thousands of top-secret documents for 
Israel back in 1984 and 1985, stories on the front page of today's 
"New York Times."
