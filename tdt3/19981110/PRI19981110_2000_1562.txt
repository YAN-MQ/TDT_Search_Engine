Hurricane Mitch wiped out thousands of jobs in Central America. U.S. 
banana giants, Dole and Chiquita, have announced that they'll lay 
off their entire work force in Honduras because plantations there 
were destroyed. And today, there was more bad news for America's banana 
producers. A dispute between the United States and the European union 
over banana imports threatens to escalate into a full blown trade 
war. Liz George has more on that story from our business desk in New 
York. The Office of the U.S. Trade Representative has today published 
a list of goods on which it may suspend trade concessions. That means 
European imports such as wine, cheese, leather goods, and even pens 
may become more expensive to U.S. consumers as a result of this action. 
The U.S. has proposed the measure in protest over the E.U. policy 
on banana imports. The U.S. argues it discriminates against American 
companies while favoring European importers. That complaint was upheld 
by the World Trade Organization, which has given the European Union 
until January the 1st to change. But so far, European efforts to meet 
that demand have not satisfied the U.S. Peter Sherry is Washington 
special trade ambassador for agriculture. The U.S. has companies which 
have exported Latin American bananas to Europe for over a hundred 
years. There are five other countries which have also exported Latin 
American bananas, and it is the proposal that the E.U. has put forward 
to implement on January 1st continues to discriminate against the 
interest of the United States and the interest of several Latin American 
countries and we believe is inconsistent with the European's obligations 
under the World Trade Organization. European officials have retaliated 
angrily saying any action could damage trans-Atlantic trade relations. 
The list of sanctions announced today in Washington is not the final 
one. U.S. officials say a final and shorter list will be made public 
in December. And if no progress is made in negotiations with the European 
Union, sanctions will go into effect early next year. For THE WORLD, 
I'm Liz George in New York.
