The national highway traffic safety administration says it will review 
whether more protection is needed for side-impact crashes. An advocacy 
group says the current federal standard is too weak and petitioned 
the agency to impose tougher measures. The group says more than one-third 
of the serious injuries in accidents last year resulted from side-impact 
crashes. It 's calling for better side-impact testing and side air 
bags in more american vehicles.
