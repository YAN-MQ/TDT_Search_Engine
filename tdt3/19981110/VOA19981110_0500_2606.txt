Fourteen hours, 48 universal time. Here's the major news story we're 
following this hour. China has repeated its criticism of Tibet's exiled 
spiritual leader, the Dalai Lama, who is in Washington for talks with 
senior U.S. officials. We'll have an update on that story in about 
11 minutes at 15 hours universal time. Well, that music is meant to 
echo the phonetic activity on Wall Street where Joe Chapman is standing 
by in New York to bring us the latest, as we are, what, 19 minutes 
into trading today.
