Coming up tomorrow night, a long distance "fleecing of America." Have 
you ever tried long distance directly assistance and wound up with 
the wrong number? You still pay for it. What's going on? We'll have 
some answers tomorrow night. I'll be right back to explain what a 
party song was doing at the U.S. Supreme Court. First, a look at "Louie, 
Louie" at the movies. When they said the world didn't need another 
nose strip we said, "oh, yeah?" How about making one that's contoured, 
for a good fit giving it a centering bump so you know where to place 
it and using a skin-friendly adhesive? Introducing ClearPassage an 
ergonomically advanced nose strip designed to relieve the symptoms 
of nasal congestion. Oh, and one last thing-- how about having it 
made by the maker of Afrin nasal spray the people who know more about 
the nose than anyone? New ClearPassage.
