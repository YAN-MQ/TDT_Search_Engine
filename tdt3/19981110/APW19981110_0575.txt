Two Sudanese have been killed in an attack on the Mboki refugee camp 
in the Central African Republic, a spokesman for the U.N. High Commissioner 
for Refugees said Tuesday. UNHCR staffers and some private relief 
workers were threatened in the attack, apparently by Sudanese rebels, 
last Friday, said Kris Janowski. After gunfire was heard in the area 
again Monday, several relief workers were flown by U.N. military observers 
to Bangui, the republic's capital, but other relief workers stayed 
at the settlement, Janowski told reporters. At UNCHR's request the 
republic flew in 30 government troops Monday to reinforce the one 
police officer who was present at Mboki at the time of the raid, he 
said. Janowski said the incident was similar to an Oct. 3 assault 
on a refugee center in Congo by the Sudanese People's Liberation Army, 
which looted UNHCR offices and chased refugees across the border back 
into Sudan, Janowski said. Some 35,000 Sudanese refugees live in the 
Central African Republic settlement at Mboki, which is spread over 
40 square kilometers near the Sudanese and Congolese borders. According 
to humanitarian workers in southern Sudan, 17,000 of the 61,000 refugees 
in Congo have returned to the Yambio area since the raid Oct. 3. Janowski 
said the agency also is ``extremely concerned'' about another potential 
source of instability in central Africa _ the disappearance of ``significant 
numbers'' of Rwandan men from refugee camps in the Republic of Congo. 
``We fear they may take up arms'' in neighboring Congo, he said. New 
fighters would add to the turmoil in the country, where the government 
and its allies face a rebellion supported by other African countries. 
``UNHCR has condemned the recruitment of refugees and asylum seekers 
for military action in the past, and has appealed to states to take 
all necessary measures to prevent activities which could further destabilize 
the region,'' Janowski said.
