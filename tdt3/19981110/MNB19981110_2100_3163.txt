A lot of Americans remember world war II today by visiting France 
and the beaches of Normandy, where U.S. soldiers landed on D-day. 
As NBC news correspondent Ron Allen reports, interest in the historic 
battle has increased since a movie made it known to a whole new generation 
and reminded an older generation what it had done. Another invasion 
of Normandy. Americans depending on the historic site of world war 
II's most famous battle, D-day. Storming the beaches to liberate Europe 
from the Nazis. The landing so vividly portrayed in the movie "saving 
private Ryan." I'll seal you on the beach. Scenes so real they moved 
John and carleton Davis to explore Normandy for themselves. It's unbelievable 
what these people did. We don't even appreciate it. Fire! I contempt 
thinking, what if my son had been sent there? My son could have been 
the one going up that beach. It just was very emotional. The legendary 
stories of heroism and sacrifice on this battlefield with its bomb 
craters and bunkers have a powerful attraction. Now, the movie magazine 
my fries that impact, drawing visitors here by the thousands, especially 
Americans who never really understood what happened at Normandy. They 
probably had lots of German machine guns all along there. Don and 
Ann king's fathers fought in world war II, but rarely talked about 
it. More of that family history was lost when Don's father recently 
passed away. After seeing "private Ryan," the kings decided to bring 
their children to normandy and its American cemetery, nearly 10,000 
gras for a lesson about courage. They were in the war, and they died. 
Every person that died died trying, you know? Yeah, yeah. so -- Well 
-- I'm more proud of them. Now they want Julia, just 13, to see the 
movie. It will be hard, but I think it's OK for her to have a greater 
understanding of what went on here and what her grandfathers went 
through. Get out! The movie inspiring Americans to retrace the footsteps 
of another generation. Marsha Andrews and her sister Pam Lane came 
here from North Carolina to pay their respects to men lost from their 
father's division, the 82nd airborne. Our dad made it. So many others 
didn't. I don't know if he could come back here and see this. I think 
it would be very hard. A difficult journey for many veterans at Normandy. 
A place now visited with a much deeper sense of respect. Ron Allen, 
NBC news, Normandy.
