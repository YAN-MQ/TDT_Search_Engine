Chancellor Gerhard Schroeder pledged Tuesday during his first major 
policy speech to put Germans back to work and give the nation a new 
optimism about the future. In his inaugural address to parliament, 
Schroeder said he would modernize Europe's biggest economy and promote 
private initiative but also put new emphasis on a government that 
provides for society's weakest members. That theme, touted by some 
in Europe's new left as the ``Third Way'' between pure capitalism 
and a strong social welfare state, helped the younger Schroeder unseat 
longtime leader Helmut Kohl in September. ``People in Germany don't 
lack creative forces,'' Schroeder declared. ``We will help make them 
unfold.'' He accused Kohl's government of leading the nation into 
stagnation and pessimism during its 16 years in office and called 
for a new push of German industriousness. ``We are going turn this 
country into a place on the move again,'' he said. ``The only thing 
we need to fear is getting stuck in blockades of our own making.'' 
While repeating campaign promises to rescind cuts in social programs 
passed by Kohl's conservative government, he warned that the time 
of government largesse was over. He promised ``resolute consolidation'' 
of federal spending. The new chancellor went before the new parliament 
armed with a 15 billion mark (dlrs 8.9 billion) cut in Germany's high 
taxes that he says will lower unemployment, stuck above 10 percent. 
Lawmakers are to take up the legislation Friday. Rejecting criticism 
by business, he insisted the tax plan would lighten the burden on 
small and medium-size companies that hurts German competitiveness 
and spur the economy by leaving more money in the average wage earner's 
pocket. ``Unemployment remains our most pressing and most painful 
problem,'' Schroeder said. With the left in power in most European 
countries, Schroeder said there was a ``unique chance'' for a common 
fight against unemployment. ``Our goal is a European jobs pact,'' 
he said. Stressing a campaign promise, he said he will start talks 
with industry and labor next month on ways to create jobs, reviving 
a consensus model that helped turn Germany into an economic powerhouse 
after World War II. He pledged continued government aid to economically 
struggling eastern Germany, blighted by four decades of communist 
rule that ended with German unification in 1990. Schroeder outlined 
other goals set by his Social Democrats and their junior coalition 
partner, the ecology-minded Greens, for parliament's four-year term: 
weaning Germany off nuclear energy, easing citizenship rules to integrate 
foreigners, and streamlining the bureaucracy. The coalition has a 
21-seat majority in parliament. In relatively brief remarks on foreign 
policy, he said Germany would remain a loyal U.S. ally and partner 
in NATO while seeking to raise Europe's profile in international affairs.
