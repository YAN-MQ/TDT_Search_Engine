Ike Quartey's reaction when he was told his Nov. 21 fight against 
Oscar De La Hoya was off was short and to the point like a sweetly 
thrown combination. ``Damn ... again,'' the native of Ghana said. 
He now has to wait until Feb. 13 to challenge WBC welterweight champion 
De La Hoya, who was cut over the left eye while sparring Oct. 31. 
It was the third time this year that a lucrative fight for Quartey 
fell through and means he will go into the February match without 
having fought since Oct. 17, 1997. In April, Quartey was supposed 
to defend the WBA welterweight title against Pernell Whitaker, but 
the fight didn't happen because Whitaker tested positive for cocaine 
after another fight. Then he was supposed to have a November bout 
with IBF champion Felix Trinidad, but Trinidad got tied up in litigation 
with promoter Don King. ``It's affected my life and my career,'' said 
Quartey, who relinquished the WBA title to challenge De La Hoya. ``It's 
not fair. I'm not making any money.'' As for De La Hoya being cut, 
Quartey said Tuesday, ``I didn't believe it because I heard he wasn't 
doing well in the gym. He wasn't ready. I heard he was knocked down 
in the gym.'' ``Not true at all,'' De La Hoya said at a news conference 
at the Original All-Star Cafe. ``If you're not 100 percent inside 
the ring, don't fight because you're risking everything,'' said De 
La Hoya (29-0, 24 knockouts), boxing's biggest attraction outside 
the heavyweight division. ``I was training hard and ready to fight, 
but I couldn't spar for the last two weeks and it would be difficult 
to be in top shape. ``This guy can fight. It's the toughest fight 
of my career.'' Quartey has a 34-0-1 record, with 29 knockouts. The 
site of the TVKO pay-per-view match remains the Thomas &AMP; Mack 
Center in Las Vegas.
