New York City and New York State agreed Tuesday to pay $49 million 
to settle a civil lawsuit brought by a whistle-blower who charged 
that New York fraudulently collected hundreds of millions of dollars 
in federal funds between 1990 and 1994 for required foster care services 
that were not provided. The settlement, approved on Tuesday by Judge 
Denny Chin of U.S. District Court for the Southern District, includes 
no admission of wrongdoing, but requires the city and the state to 
give federal officials access to foster care computer records over 
the next three years so they can determine whether the city is providing 
mandated services to children in foster care. Nicholas Scoppetta, 
the city's commissioner of the Administration for Children's Services, 
criticized the terms of the settlement. ``By taking back $49 million, 
the United States is penalizing the city and state for what is essentially 
a record-keeping failure by overburdened foster care workers,'' he 
said Tuesday. But Mary Jo White, the U.S. attorney for the Southern 
District of New York, issued a sharp retort. ``It is unfortunate that 
the city seeks to minimize and blame others for the serious conduct 
and failure'' that led one of its own child welfare officials to file 
the lawsuit, Ms. White said. The city will pay $14 million and the 
state, which oversees the city's system and collected most of the 
federal money, will pay $35 million. The services at issue include 
caseworker visits to foster homes, interviews with foster children, 
the monitoring of birth parents and foster families, and long-term 
planning reviews every six months. ``We would hope that the city would 
expend its efforts in establishing a system, as mandated by Congress, 
that insures that children promptly receive the critical social services 
necessary for their welfare,'' Ms. White said. Besides requiring the 
city and state to provide these services to receive foster care reimbursement, 
the federal government offers ``incentive funds'' to child welfare 
systems that can demonstrate that more than 90 percent of their foster 
care cases are in compliance with these legal requirements. Federal 
prosecutors contended that New York misled federal officials to collect 
these incentive funds during the administration of Mayor David Dinkins 
and the first year of the Giuliani administration. If prosecutors 
had prevailed in a trial, New York risked having to return $100 million 
in foster care money, Lorna Goodman, an assistant corporation counsel 
for the city, said Tuesday. Ms. Goodman said the charges of fraud 
were baseless. Bracha Graber, the whistle-blower, will receive $4.9 
million under the settlement. Ms. Graber, a former midlevel employee 
of the city's child welfare agency, said she would use a substantial 
portion of the award to establish a foundation to provide scholarships 
for foster children. Carl H. Loewenson Jr., Ms. Graber's lawyer, said 
Ms. Graber had repeatedly refused to participate in the falsification 
of computer records and brought the activity to the attention of her 
superiors to no avail. She finally turned to federal prosecutors, 
suing the city and state under the whistle-blower law known as the 
False Claims Act for triple the amount of actual damages, estimated 
in the complaint to be at least $37.4 million. But in June, Judge 
Chin ruled that neither a state nor a municipality could be named 
as a defendant under the False Claims Act. That issue is pending in 
an unrelated case before the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Second 
Circuit.
