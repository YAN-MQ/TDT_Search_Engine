the former producer of the beatles is retiring, but not before overseeing 
one last album. dennis michael has that. let me hear some of that 
rock 'n' roll music any old way you choose it sir george martin, whose 
50-year career in the music industry included working as the beatles' 
producer from "love me do" through "the beatles anthology," is now 
retiring as a producer and celebrating by producing an album, "george 
martin, in my life." i set out to do an album with, first of all, 
with my friends. and then -- and widen it a bit, and had my heroes 
then as well. come together right now over me robin williams, for 
example, who always been one of my -- i think he's such a terrific 
guy. and i thought, "i think i could persuade him to work with me." 
i am the walrus goo goo gajoob jim carrey -- i needed -- i needed 
someone to do a zany version of "i am the walrus," i couldn't think 
of anybody better. and he went along with it and gave such a wonderful 
performance. he sings so good, so well. knowing that love is to share 
sir george convinced celine dion to perform paul mccartney's ballad 
"here, there and everywhere." golden slumbers fill your eyes and phil 
collins to do the "golden slumbers" medley from "abbey road." is it 
sacrilege to put new voices on some of the most revered music of the 
20th century? sir george says nonsense. a lot of people regard beatle 
music as the holy grail that should never be touched except with, 
you know, with incense and whatever. i don't hold with that. i think 
having been part of it, i feel it's my music, too. at a recent hollywood 
party celebrating "in my life," quincy jones gave sir george martin 
an accolade more valuable than a knighthood. you are the fifth beatle, 
that's for sure. but was he? there were five voices on the studio 
floor. and every one of them was respected and listened to. and whoever 
wrote the original song that we were working on, obviously, their 
voice would be heard above everyone else. but it's -- we worked very 
well. it was a very collaborative effort. and, of course, we were 
great friends. sir george martin will continue to do concert tours 
and run his studio complex and radio station, but the end of his producing 
career, he says, means he might have a little more time for his boat.
