a new study shows the nation's kids are doing more work and less play 
these days. university of michigan researchers say kids' free time 
-- what's left after eating, personal care, sleeping or attending 
school -- is declining. the study found that children on average spent 
just 30% of their time playing last year. that's down from 40% in 
1981. researchers say play time is important for kids because it helps 
them learn and develop social and mental skills.
