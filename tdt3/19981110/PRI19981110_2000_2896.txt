You're listening to Public Radio, 91 FM, WHYY. I'm Joe Presudo Pamaco. 
Thanks a lot for tuning in. And stay with us. After THE WORLD at, 
it's NPR's "Talk of the Nation" with Ray Suarez. We'll examine the 
year 2000 computer problem and whether your life will be affected 
if that problem isn't fixed. Then more technology at 10:00 on "Tech 
Nation" with Moira Dunn. The president and CEO of Software.com, John 
MacFarland, discusses the state of E-mail worldwide. And Moira will 
also speak with Matt Goldhaver, the founder and CEO of Cybergold about 
what it means to have a patent on the Internet. That's coming up at 
10:00 on "Tech Nation." At 11:00 on the "Charlie Rose Show," scheduled 
guests include journalist Robert McNeil, author of "Breaking News," 
and the music director of the National Symphony Orchestra, the conductor, 
Leonard Slatkin. So that's the line up for the next several hours 
on 91 FM. Please stay tuned.
