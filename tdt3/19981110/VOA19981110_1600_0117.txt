Israel's prime minister will convene his Cabinet Wednesday to vote 
on the new accord with the Palestinians. The Cabinet suspended discussion 
last Friday after a bombing in Jerusalem and it had delayed debate 
on the deal several times before the attack. Palestinian leader Yasir 
Arafat complained today that Israel was willfully wasting time before 
implementing the agreement. It calls for Israel to hand over 13 percent 
of the West Bank to Palestinian control in return for tougher Palestinian 
action against anti-Israeli violence.
