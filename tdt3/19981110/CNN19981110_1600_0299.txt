The postal service has issued three new stamps in honor of U.S. veterans. 
The stamps commemorate world war II veterans. One features "Rosie 
the riveter," in honor of the women who supported the war effort. 
Another stamp is in commemoration of the 1944 Gi Bill, which allowed 
thousands of service members to obtain higher education.
