When we come back, why abortion providers fear the calendar. I love 
being out in the sun. It makes me feel so alive. Now I really enjoy 
being outdoors because I've discovered this new lotion... that's been 
awarded the skin cancer foundation seal, designed for women our age. 
This SPF 15 formula with intense vitamin-enriched moisture... helps 
protect maturing skin from future U.V. damage. It minimizes, even 
helps prevent, age spots. And the name? Provital protective moisture 
lotion from oil of Olay. Proven to help you look revitalized.
