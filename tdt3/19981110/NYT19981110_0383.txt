President Carlos Saul Menem returned from London last week without 
making any progress toward his goal of retaking the Falkland Islands. 
But if the gossip columns here are on to something, he may eventually 
come away with something else: a British son-in-law, none other than 
Prince Andrew. Never mind that Prince Andrew, Queen Elizabeth's second 
son, served as a helicopter pilot in the Falkland war. Never mind 
that Menem's only child, Zulema Maria Eva, is Muslim and was named 
in part for Eva Peron, who hated all things English. And never mind 
that the prince and Miss Menem need an interpreter to communicate. 
These are, after all, only rumors. But the reports of a blooming romance, 
while most likely highly exaggerated, are being taken here as a sign 
that the two countries are finally putting the 1982 war behind them. 
Perhaps that is why President Menem appears to be encouraging the 
gossip. Or maybe he is just relieved that his daughter recently stopped 
dating a motorcycle racer. The rumors began when the prince, 38, and 
Miss Menem, 27, were seated together at a state dinner held in President 
Menem's honor. Photographs in the weekly gossip magazine Gente show 
the two sharing hearty laughs, toasting and looking deeply into each 
other's eyes. ``It seemed incredible to me that they did not stop 
talking,'' Menem told the magazine in an interview. ``They almost 
didn't eat. They seemed to laugh spontaneously, and that made me very 
happy.'' The president was asked in a radio interview whether Miss 
Menem and the prince would marry. ``That makes me laugh,'' he said. 
``Maybe they are friends.'' The president's tepid denial of a romance 
made the front page of Pagina 12, a leading Buenos Aires newspaper, 
under a dry headline, almost understatedly British: ``Friends.'' The 
new media attention given Miss Menem, who has escorted the president 
on all his trips since her parents separated several years ago and 
then divorced, is something of a carryover from the British press. 
The Daily Mail of London reported that she was a ``firecracker,'' 
made much of her short skirts and declared in one headline, ``All 
Eyes on the Divine Miss Menem.'' Miss Menem became a symbol of reconciliation 
in London when she was photographed wiping tears from her eyes in 
St. Paul's Cathedral as her father laid a memorial wreath to the 225 
British soldiers and sailors who died in the Falkland war. On his 
trip Menem and British Prime Minister Tony Blair agreed to disagree 
on the Falklands, but pledged closer cooperation on economic and trade 
matters. The better tone in relations may even eventually carry over 
to military affairs. Gen. Charles Guthries, chief of the British Defense 
Staff, proposed on a visit to Argentina last week that a joint Argentine-British 
force finally remove land mines laid by Argentine soldiers in 1982 
after they landed on the islands. Such an operation, he suggested, 
might lead to other joint maneuvers.
