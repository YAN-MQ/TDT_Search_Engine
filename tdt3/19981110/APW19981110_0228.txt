Serb police threatened to beef up their patrols in Kosovo following 
the slayings of two officers that Serbs blame on ethnic Albania guerrillas. 
Ethnic Albanians accuse Serbs of opening fire first on a group of 
their men _ and of violating a U.S.-brokered cease-fire intended to 
halt hostilities between Serbs and the ethnic Albanians who make up 
90 percent of Kosovo's population. Violence by both sides has increased 
in the past week, including at least three incidents in which police 
reported killing KLA fighters who shot at them first. The two policemen 
disappeared Friday, the same day Serb police shot to death five ethnic 
Albanian guerrillas, including a commander of two divisions. Both 
of the slain policemen had gunshot wounds to the head, indicating 
they had been killed execution-style. Serb police spokesman Bozidar 
Filic said the executions showed the Kosovo Liberation Army's disregard 
for the U.S.-sponsored cease-fire. He warned Monday that unless ```international 
representatives'' secure two main roads running through Malisevo by 
Wednesday, police will increase their patrols and ``allow safe passage'' 
_ indicating a possible new Serb action. In a statement reflecting 
new pressure on international diplomats to calm the situation, Belgrade 
allies of President Slobodan Milosevic said Tuesday they were horrified 
by the ``criminal, cunning murder.'' The pro-communist Yugoslav Left 
demanded a tough international response and pledged that state authorities 
will ``prevent acts of terrorism ... and protect their citizens,'' 
the official Tanjug news agency reported. David Scheffer, the roving 
U.S. ambassador on war crimes issues, viewed the bodies in Malisevo, 
a devastated central village, as he toured the area with the Kosovo 
Diplomatic Observer Mission. ``This represents one of the problems 
that is being experienced here with the cease-fire, and that is that 
there are violations of the cease-fire by both sides,'' Scheffer said. 
Serb authorities suspect the killed policemen were kidnapped by the 
KLA in retaliation for the shootings of the five guerrillas. The rebels 
say police shot at the five as they drove in two vehicles from Opterusa 
village, while police claim the guerrillas opened fire first. A KLA 
official said the killing of the five guerrillas violated a de facto 
cease-fire in Kosovo. Under a 4-week-old agreement between Milosevic 
and U.S. envoy Richard Holbrooke, Milosevic's forces were supposed 
to cease hostilities. Dozens of Serb police were killed before and 
after the start of a Serb crackdown on ethnic Albanian separatists 
last February in Kosovo, a majority Albanian province. Several hundred 
other people, mostly ethnic Albanians, have been killed, and as many 
as 300,000 driven from their homes.
