iraq's foreign minister is calling for a political solution to the 
latest dispute over u.n. weapons inspections. he says military action 
threatened by the united states and britain could destabilize the 
region. iraq announced ten days ago it would no longer cooperate with 
the u.n. teams. the inspectors must certify iraq has destroyed its 
weapons of mass destruction before the u.n. security council will 
lift sanctions imposed at the end of the persian gulf war.
