France's finance minister confirmed on Tuesday that France is canceling 
the debt of Nicaragua and Honduras, a gesture to ease the devastation 
those countries have suffered from Hurricane Mitch. Dominique Strauss-Kahn 
made the announcement during a question-and-answer session in parliament. 
The confirmation came a day after Prime Minister Lionel Jospin called 
for the move. It also came a day before President Jacques Chirac leaves 
for the region devastated by Mitch. Honduras and Nicaragua had appealed 
for help with their foreign debts during a summit of Central American 
presidents Monday to discuss response to Hurricane Mitch, which they 
say killed some 10,000 people. Nicaragua's total foreign debt reaches 
dlrs 6 billion. Honduras owes dlrs 4.2 billion. U.S. President Bill 
Clinton last week requested a global relief effort and issued orders 
boosting U.S. emergency aid to dlrs 70 million.
