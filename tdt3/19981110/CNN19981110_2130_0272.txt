A community in Jacksonville, Florida, is stunned after the search 
for a Missing girl came to a gruesome conclusion. Aram Roston has 
the story. The frantic week-long search for a missing 8-year-old girl 
spanned several states. It ended at a house across the street. Police 
say maddie Clifton's killer was a 14-year-old playmate of hers, joshua 
Phillips. She knew him and there was probably no reason for her to 
be afraid of him. Police say they found her stabbed and bludgeoned 
body in the boy's bedroom hidden under the mattress of his waterbed. 
She was entombed securely and there were clothing that were put around 
the corner and the back to make sure the odor stayed in. Police had 
searched the house three times in the past week. Joshua had been a 
focus of the investigation but it wasn't till Tuesday morning that 
his mother smelled the odor and checked the bed. Pulled out the corner 
of the bed right here. When she pulled that open, she could see the 
feet of the victim. Holy Mary, mother of God. The highly publicized 
search for the girl had captured the heart of the Jacksonville. Prayers 
for her safe return changed to confusion and horror at the apparent 
circumstances of her death. Yellow ribbons tied throughout the city 
were replaced with purple ribbons of remembrance. Friends and strangers 
gathered near her home. It just tears my heart out. This is awful. 
Police say the young suspect admitted that he killed her. He is being 
held at a juvenile detention center and is charged with murder. As 
for motive, investigators are not saying what the 14-year-old suspect 
may have told them. Aram Roston, CNN, Jacksonville, Florida.
