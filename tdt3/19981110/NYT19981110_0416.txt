Bill Gates, chairman of Microsoft Corp., confidently told a group 
of industry executives in 1995 that the government's antitrust investigation 
of his company would ``blow over'' with scant effect, an executive 
who attended the private meeting testified in court Tuesday. And although 
Microsoft had signed a consent decree with the government a year earlier 
agreeing to alter its software licensing deals with personal computer 
makers, Gates was also quoted as saying that the company had not really 
changed its business practices. ``This antitrust thing will blow over,'' 
Gates said, according to the handwritten notes of an executive of 
Intel Corp. that were introduced Tuesday in the trial of the Microsoft 
antitrust case. ``We haven't changed our business practices at all,'' 
Gates was quoted as telling a group of Intel executives at the meeting 
on July 11, 1995, at Intel's headquarters in Santa Clara, Calif. The 
notes were taken by Steven McGeady, a vice president of Intel, who 
is a witness for the government. Gates' comments about not having 
altered Microsoft's business practices could be significant because 
they might suggest that the company was not complying with the legally 
binding consent decree. If the government wins the antitrust case, 
legal experts say, Gates' comments could help the Justice Department 
argue that sweeping remedies _ perhaps even breaking up the company 
_are required to restore competition in the computer software business. 
The Justice Department, these experts say, could point to the Gates 
remarks as evidence that Microsoft had shown no restraint even when 
operating under an agreement with the government. A federal court 
approved the consent decree in 1995, but Microsoft had agreed to its 
strictures when it signed the agreement in 1994. Microsoft viewed 
the government's pointed focus on the Gates comments as a ``further 
personal attack on Bill Gates'' and ``another example of the Justice 
Department's tactic of trial by excerpt,'' said Mark Murray, a company 
spokesman. Murray pointed to other comments quoted by the Intel executive 
_ that the computer business was ``unbelievably competitive'' and 
``healthy'' _ as evidence Gates was speaking in the broader context 
of an industry leader who was optimistic the Justice Department would 
eventually agree that Microsoft's business did not require government 
intervention. Besides, Murray added, Gates' remarks probably focused 
mainly on the Justice Department's inquiries in 1995 about whether 
to allow Microsoft to bundle a new online service, Microsoft Network, 
with Windows 95. The notes of Gates' comments were introduced during 
the second day of testimony by McGeady, the government's fourth witness 
in the trial. Late Tuesday morning, Microsoft began cross-examining 
him. Steven Holley, a lawyer for Microsoft, used internal Intel e-mail 
and the videotaped deposition of another Intel executive to try to 
raise doubts about McGeady's assertion that Microsoft had forced Intel 
to shelve some multimedia and Internet software development work and 
to curb its support for such Microsoft software rivals as Sun Microsystems 
Inc. and Netscape Communications Corp. The government contends that 
Microsoft was so concerned about any challenge to its dominance of 
desktop software that it threatened even its close partner, Intel, 
by saying it would withhold software support for Intel's new microprocessor 
products unless Intel sided with Microsoft. Much of the cross-examination 
focused on an Intel software initiative called ``native signal processing,'' 
or NSP, which was intended to improve the ability of personal computers 
to play high-quality audio and video. McGeady was deeply involved 
in the development of NSP, a program that was sharply pared back after 
Microsoft protested in 1995. In court, Microsoft argued that Intel 
began marketing NSP to personal computer makers and did so when Microsoft 
was focused on bringing out Windows 95, even though NSP was tailored 
for an earlier version of the operating system, Windows 3.1. When 
asked why Intel had not given Microsoft more advance notice of its 
work on NSP, McGeady replied that Intel's software engineers had feared 
that Microsoft would try to ``stomp it out of existence.'' And, he 
added, ``It was the fear that was eventually realized.'' Yet under 
cross-examination, McGeady admitted that in retrospect ``it was a 
mistake'' to target its multimedia software for Windows 3.1 instead 
of Windows 95. The reason, he explained, was that Intel thought that 
the release date for the next-generation operating system might well 
slip into 1996. Microsoft also showed parts of a taped deposition 
from Ron Whittier, an Intel executive who was McGeady's boss. Whittier 
said that pressure from Gates to table NSP was ``a factor'' in Intel's 
decision not to ship the software. But, he said, Intel was mainly 
``looking out for our own best interests'' because if NSP slowed the 
adoption of personal computers using Windows 95, that could damage 
Intel's main business _ microprocessor sales to PC makers for use 
in new machines. Viewing the tape, McGeady said, ``I'd say Microsoft 
helped enlighten us about about what our best interests were.'' He 
then characterized Whittier's emphasis on Intel's self-interest instead 
of any threat from Microsoft as ``PR spin.'' ``At his deposition?'' 
asked Holley, the Microsoft lawyer. ``Yes,'' McGeady replied.
