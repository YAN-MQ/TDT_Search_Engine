A Dutch forum planning the introduction of the single European currency 
is split over whether to phase in the euro over a month or replace 
the guilder in a single-day switch. The National Forum for the Introduction 
of the Euro sent a proposal to parliament Tuesday to ease the euro 
into Dutch wallets over a four-week period at the beginning of 2002. 
The forum is made up of representatives from major trade unions, the 
finance and economics ministries, Dutch companies and the Amsterdam 
stock exchange. But representatives of retailers and small businesses 
boycotted the meeting at which the proposal was drawn up because of 
remarks from Nout Wellink, the president of the Dutch Central Bank. 
Wellink believes it is unrealistic for the new currency to be introduced 
nationally in just one day. Commercial banks also have expressed doubts 
that a so-called ``big bang'' introduction would be possible. But 
retailers are firm supporters of the one-day implementation. An organization 
representing small businesses has estimated that adapting machinery 
to cope with the two currencies side-by-side for four weeks will cost 
retailers about 1 billion guilders (dlrs 535 million). Although the 
new currency official debuts on Jan. 1, 1999, euro coins and notes 
will come into circulation in the 11 euro-zone nations between Jan. 
1, 2002 and June 30, 2002. During the transition period, it is planned 
that national tender will be accepted as payment alongside euros, 
but only euros will be returned as change. ``The social cost can be 
significantly reduced if the E.U. maximum of six months for the dual 
period is drastically shortened,'' the Dutch forum concluded. In France, 
Finance Minister Dominique Strauss-Kahn has proposed a transition 
period of 10 weeks while Germany plans to change over between Jan. 
1, 2002, and February 28, 2002. In that period, both Deutsche marks 
and euros will be accepted as payment, but banks, retailers and vending 
machines will all give change only in euros. Belgium, Spain, Italy, 
Austria and Ireland haven't decided on transition details yet. Details 
of arrangements in Finland, Luxembourg and Portugal were not immediately 
available.
