Estonian authorities on Tuesday turned off the sole water supply to 
the Russian border city of Ivangorod because the city has not paid 
its water bill. Officials in the Estonian city of Narva, where the 
region's main water utility is located, said that Ivangorod, a city 
of 12,000, had failed to pay water bills totaling more than dlrs 1 
million. Non-payment of Ivangorod's water bill has been an ongoing 
problem that has been exacerbated by Russia's worsening economic crisis. 
The cash-strapped Russian town says it doesn't have the money to pay. 
Estonia's government last year paid part of Ivangorod's water bill, 
but on Tuesday refused to say whether it was willing to pay the debt 
again. Estonian government spokesman Daniel Vaarik said the problem 
involved national and municipal governments and also privately owned 
companies, which made finding a solution more difficult. ``This is 
a serious situation and very complicated to solve,'' he told The Associated 
Press. ``But someone has to pay the bill or the Narva Water Company, 
which is partly private, will go bankrupt. That would be a huge problem 
for Narva and all of Estonia.'' Narva and Ivangorod, about 200 kilometers 
(120 miles) east of Tallinn, have had a common water system since 
before World War II, when Ivangorod was part of Estonia. After Estonia 
was annexed by the Soviet Union in 1940, their infrastructures became 
more intertwined. With the Soviet collapse in 1991, Ivangorod fell 
under the jurisdiction of Russia and Narva remained part of Estonia, 
which is considered the most successful free-market reformer of the 
15 former Soviet republics. Under Russia, Ivangorod's economy has 
fallen into near ruin, while Narva's economy has thrived by comparison.
