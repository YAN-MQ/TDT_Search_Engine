Well, now, let's see what kind of weather we have in the continent 
of Africa. I bet it's going to be fairly nice, fairly warm for most 
of us. In Algiers, it's going to be rather moderate, clouds and sunshine, 
a high of about 20 degrees expected. Mostly sunny and pleasant in 
Rabat, Morocco, a high of 26. And in Tripoli, Libya, look for sunny 
skies, very pleasant, a high of 24 degrees. Well, in Tunis, it will 
be almost as pleasant with partly cloudy skies, a high of 20 degrees 
on Wednesday. Abuja, Nigeria, 32 for your high and mostly sunny, and 
partly sunny and warm in humid and a high of 30 in Accra, Ghana. Partly 
sunny skies are predicted for Adis Abuba. It will be warm there with 
a high of 26 degrees. Partly sunny and pleasant in Asmara, Iritrio 
with a high of 22. Very warm in Bamako, Mali with sunny skies, hot 
weather, 35 degrees again there. It's going to be warm. Well, a little 
variation in Bujumbura, Burundi. You'll have showers on Wednesday. 
Your high temperature, 28. Partly sunny and very windy in Cape Town, 
South Africa, 21 degrees for your high. And Dakar, Senegal, 30 degrees 
for your high, humid, and sunny. Dar es Salaam, partly sunny, breezy, 
and humid, high of 31 degrees. Look for some clouds drifting by in 
Durban, South Africa, some sunshine peeking through. It will be all 
together pleasant with a high of 25 degrees. And a high of 30 is predicted 
for Inugu, Nigeria, partly sunny, warm, and humid. Freetown, Sierra
