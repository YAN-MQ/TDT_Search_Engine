Well, we were up for most of the day, but some late session selling 
wiped out the gains. The Dow Jones Industrial Average closing down 
34 points at 8863. Standard & Poor's 500 Index closed at 1128, that 
was down two points. But NASDAQ performed quite well. It was actually 
up 4-1/2 points. Despite the general decline, analysts say there was 
a lot of buying interest from many individual investors. And a lot 
of Internet-related stocks soared today. EBay, an online auction company, 
gained more than 30 percent. K-Tel, which sells recorded music on 
the Internet and Amazon, which sells books, were also both up strongly. 
Wal-Mart, the largest retail chain in the United States, says its 
quarterly earnings exceeded $1 billion; that was well beyond Wall 
Street expectations. General Motors is going to invest $1.5 billion 
to streamline its engineering unit. The idea is to speed up development 
of new vehicles. Once again, Dow Jones Industrial Average closing 
down 34 points. This is Breck Ardery.
