League champion Juventus will start a Croat defender as centerforward 
and some players from its junior teams in Wednesday's Italian Cup 
round to make up for a streak of injuries which have sidelined key 
players and severely cut an original 23-man roster. Igor Tudor, who 
usually teams with Uruguayan Paolo Montero and Italian veteran Ciro 
Ferrara in defense, will lead La Juve offense in the third-round second-leg 
game of the Italian Cup against low-ranked Venezia. Coach Marcello 
Lippi said Tuesday that Tudor, who's tall and good in headers, will 
team in front with Uruguayan forward Daniel Fonseca and with 18-year-old 
Marco Rigoni, making his debut on the major team. La Juve, which will 
be playing Venezia on the road following a disappointing 1-1 draw 
at home, will be without star-forward Alessandro Del Piero, sidelined 
through March with a bad knee injury, French midfielder Didier Deschamps, 
striker Filippo Inzaghi, No.1 keeper Angelo Peruzzi, defender Mark 
Iuliano and midfielders Antonio Conte and Alessio Tacchinardi. Internazionale 
of Milan will miss its Brazilian superstar Ronaldo in Wednesday's 
match against underdog Castel di Sangro but will start Italian veteran 
star Roberto Baggio, recovered from a knee tendinitis. Baggio, signed 
by Inter in the offseason, has played a few games with his new team. 
Inter, which tied AC Milan 1-1 Sunday following three consecutive 
losses in league games, starts from a 1-0 first-leg lead against Castel 
di Sangro, a third-division team. Ronaldo, repeatedly off and on the 
team in his troubled season start, is sidelined with a light left 
knee injury. However team doctors said he will be on the starting 
lineup in Sunday's league match against Sampdoria. Other Italian Cup 
games Wednesday, with the qualifiers moving into the quarterfinals, 
include Parma vs. Bari, AC Milan vs Lazio, Bologna vs. Sampdoria and 
Vicenza vs. Udinese. League leader Fiorentina played second-division 
Lecce Tuesday night. AS Roma will take on Atalanta of Bergamo in the 
game completing the third round Thursday.
