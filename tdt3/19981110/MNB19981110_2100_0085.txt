First, though, we begin at the White House tonight with NBC's David 
Bloom. Tonight, as the president's national security team met on Iraq 
for a fourth straight day, White House aides insisted Mr. Clinton 
has made no final decision authorizing the use of force. But at Arlington 
national cemetery, after laying a wreath at the tomb of the unknowns, 
President Clinton made his intentions clear. We continue to hope, 
indeed pray, that Saddam will comply, but we must be prepared to act 
if he does not. Today, several hundred United Nations weapons inspectors 
and relief workers evacuated Baghdad. U.N. officials say chief weapons 
inspector Richard Butler was warned by the United States that his 
team members could be targets or potential hostages if the U.S. strikes. 
I took a decision based on & safety, and in my view, it was best that 
there be no delay. Why might Iraq threaten the weapons inspectors? 
NBC news has learned within the past year, some potential U.S. military 
targets in Iraq were actually selected with the help of one or more 
of the weapons inspectors. Contrary to the U.N. teams' claim of neutrality. 
Today, Iraq's deputy prime minister complained that the weapons inspection 
team, "coordinatesits actions" with the United States, and that any 
claim to the contrary is "mere false cover." Tonight, as the U.N. 
security council met in emergency session on Iraq, there was no sign 
of Saddam Hussein backing down, and the U.S. state department is urging 
Americans in Israel and Kuwait to leave the region as soon as possible. 
David Bloom, NBC news, the White House.
