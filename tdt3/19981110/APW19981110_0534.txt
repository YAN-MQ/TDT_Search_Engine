Villagers from southeastern Nigeria's Ogoni region were holding rallies 
Tuesday to commemorate the 1995 hanging of Ogoni activist and writer 
Ken Saro-Wiwa. The Movement for the Survival of the Ogoni People, 
which Saro-Wiwa led until his execution, called for the rallies, which 
follow a Monday night vigil in the late activist's home village of 
Bana. Processions are also planned in the university town of Ile Ife 
as well as the cities of Owerri, Port Harcourt and Lagos. Saro-Wiwa 
and eight other Ogoni environmental and human-rights activists were 
hanged on Nov. 10, 1995. They were accused of treason and involvement 
in a string of killings, though activists say the nine were executed 
because of their anti-government activities. The executions sparked 
international anger against the former military regime of Gen. Sani 
Abacha and brought calls for an international boycott against the 
Anglo-Dutch oil giant Shell, which has been accused of devastating 
the Ogoni environment and turning a blind eye to human-rights abuses 
in Nigeria. Shell has since pulled out of the Ogoni region, pledging 
not to return without a broad agreement that includes the Ogonis. 
Shell asked its non-essential staff not to come to work Tuesday at 
its Lagos headquarters, fearing demonstrations planned there could 
block access. On Monday, meanwhile, three Nigerian human rights groups 
went to court requesting that the convictions of the nine be invalidated 
and the bodies be released for proper burials. The Committee for the 
Defense of Human Rights, the Eastern Nigerian Unity Association and 
the Movement for the Survival of Eastern Nigeria and the Niger Delta 
made the request to the federal high court in the southeastern city 
of Port Harcourt. Abacha, who died in June, has been replaced by Gen. 
Abdulsalami Abubakar, who has pledged to return Nigeria to democracy 
next year.
