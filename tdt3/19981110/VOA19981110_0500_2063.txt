In Bangladesh, a nationwide general strike has burst into violence 
for a second day and has crippled the country. Several explosions 
rocked the capital, Dhaka, today but there were no reports of injuries. 
The streets of the capital were largely deserted as most businesses 
remained closed and residence stayed indoors. Three people died and 
more than 100 were wounded on Monday, the first day of the strike 
called by the opposition.
