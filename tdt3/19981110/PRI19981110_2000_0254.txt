The United Nations' top refugee official is calling for amnesty for 
refugees returning to the Serbian province of Kosovo. Linda Fesulo 
reports from the U.N. During a Security Council debate on refugee 
crises, U.N. High Commissioner Sadato Ogata recommended that Yugoslavia 
grant amnesty to young ethnic Albanian men returning to Kosovo. And 
she proposed that legislation be adopted to prevent them from being 
arrested unless they were war criminals. Belgrade has generally assumed 
that the young men who left the area became fighters with the Kosovo 
Liberation Army. Ogata also called for the withdrawal of Serbian forces 
and urged that European monitors be deployed before winter sets in. 
Finally, she reported that while better shelter was needed for the 
refugees, few were still living out in the open. For NPR News, I'm 
Linda Fesulo at the United Nations.
