Bobby Holik of the New Jersey Devils was suspended for two games without 
pay and fined $1,000, the maximum allowed under the players' contract 
with the league, as a result of a tripping incident against Paul Laus 
of the Florida Panthers on Saturday. Holik had already served one 
game of his suspension when he was ordered to sit out Sunday's game 
at Tampa Bay and will complete his suspension by sitting out Wednesday 
night's game against the visiting Montreal Canadiens. The suspension 
and fine were announced Tuesday afternoon by Colin Campbell, the league's 
senior vice president and director of hockey operations, after a conference 
call with Holik, Devils president and general manager Lou Lamoriello 
and Holik's agent, Mike Gillis. ``I was completely honest with them,'' 
Holik said. ``The tape didn't lie. I think it justified the fact that 
I didn't try to hurt anyone.'' Asked whether his suspension was fair, 
Holik said, ``To tell you the truth, I'd rather not be in this situation 
than say whether it was fair or not.'' Lamoriello said, ``We felt 
good that they recognized the fact that Bobby did not intend to injure, 
hurt or slew-foot the player.'' Slew-footing, or bringing someone 
down by taking his legs out from underneath him, is the latest rule 
the league is trying to enforce and Holik is one of the first victims 
to pay for the infraction. ``A few years ago, it was the stick above 
the shoulder; now they have this slew-footing,'' Bob Carpenter, a 
veteran center, said. ``It's something they want to call and bring 
to everyone's attention.'' Along with Holik, it appears that the Devils 
will also be without Dave Andreychuk's services for the game against 
Montreal. Andreychuk missed Tuesday's practice to nurse a bruised 
sternum he sustained in the late stages of the 3-1 loss to Tampa Bay 
on Sunday.
