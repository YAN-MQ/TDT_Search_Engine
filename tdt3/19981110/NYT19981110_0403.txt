The executive who has led Microsoft Corp.'s difficult foray into the 
world of interactive media and Internet content is taking a leave, 
and the company said Tuesday that he would return to a different job 
next year. Pete Higgins, 40, vice president of the Interactive Media 
Group at Microsoft since late 1996, has been one of the closest lieutenants 
of William Gates, the chairman. But his most recent assignment, to 
try to make the company a dominant player in the world of new media, 
has had disappointing financial results. Microsoft executives stressed 
that Higgins' decision to take a leave was a personal one. In a statement, 
Higgins said he had decided to take time off to spend more time with 
his family. ``I look forward to coming back and immersing myself in 
the next challenge,'' he said. Several analysts said, however, that 
the company had continued to struggle in its effort to gain financial 
momentum in several content areas. The Interactive Media Group has 
also gone through shake-ups and has had some layoffs. In September, 
the company reorganized its Internet business under a single brand 
strategy based on its MSN label. Despite heavy investment, however, 
the company has stopped giving out numbers on its subscriber base 
for the MSN service. Higgins was originally the product manager for 
the company's popular Excel spreadsheet program and later oversaw 
the growth of the company's integrated Office suite of applications.
