President Clinton has signed a law implementing a global agreement 
to end business-related bribes abroad. The United States is one of 
the few countries that prohibits its companies from using bribes to 
advance business deals overseas. American executives have complained 
for years that it puts them at a Disadvantage. It's cost us a lot 
of business over the last 20 years to do the right thing. But it is 
clearly the right thing. American companies deserve a level playing 
field, and now with this legislation, and this international agreement, 
we will have it. President Clinton says bribery is inconsistent with 
democratic ideals. The agreement is expected to go into effect at 
the end of the year.
