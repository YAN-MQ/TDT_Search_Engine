The U.N. Refugee Agency, UNHCR, says it's concerned by reports of 
significant numbers of Rwandan men leaving refugee camps in Congo 
Brazzaville to join the fighting in neighboring Congo Kinshasa. If 
this is true, the men would be violating at least two treaties that 
prohibit refugees from going to war. Lisa Shlime reports from Geneva. 
The U.N. Refugee Agency says it believes between 3- and 5,000 Rwandan 
refugees in Congo Brazzaville have left their camps to fight in the 
civil war in Congo Kinshasa. The refugee agency says the departures 
began ten days ago from a number of camps along the Congo River which 
are home to an estimated 11,000 Rwandan refugees. UNHCR spokesman 
Chris Unovsky says observers report several boat loads of Rwandans 
have arrived in Congo Kinshasa. He says there also are reports of 
Rwandans arriving in Kinshasa. Mr. Unovsky says if the Rwandans join 
the fighting in Congo Kinshasa, they will be in violation of an international 
refugee treaty and a similar treaty enacted by the Organization of 
African Unity. Both treaties forbid refugees to take up arms. Mr. 
Unovsky says another alarming incident occurred at a refugee camp 
in the Central African republic. He says Rwandans at a camp 300 kilometers 
north of the capital, Bangwe, threatened U.N. and local aid workers 
with violence if they were not allowed to leave the country. Two gan 
dams were killed by rundents in an incident at the site last March. 
The government declines to separate individuals who are recognized 
as refugees but the National Eligibility Committee from others, they 
say that they have inadequate resources to do it and to control the 
group. Mr. Unovsky says authorities in the Central African republic 
have begun transferring more than 900 Rwandan refugees from the camp 
to a site closer to the Congo River. He says the refugee agency is 
concerned because this puts the refugees closer to the fighting in 
Congo Kinshasa. He says aid workers cannot stop the Rwandans from 
leaving but he says the refugee agency hopes to relocate all Rwandan 
refugees in the two countries into one camp. Lisa Shlime for VOA News,
