Dutch farmers whose slow-growing cucumbers have been causing them 
headaches have found a solution _ aspirin. For the cucumbers, that 
is. Scientists with the respected Dutch research institute TNO have 
discovered that feeding aspirin to young cucumber plants helps prevent 
thickening of the root walls. Plants with thick root walls absorb 
water and minerals less easily than those with thin root walls, leading 
to slower growth. ``Aspirin doesn't remove the cause of the thickening, 
but it reduces the level of damage,'' plant physiologist Sjoukje Heimovaara 
told the Algemeen Dagblad newspaper for Tuesday's edition. Aspirin 
contains an acid also made naturally by plants to protect themselves. 
No trace of the aspirin was found in the cucumbers themselves. Researchers 
are now planning to extend their experiment to eggplants, tomatoes 
and peppers.
