On another legal front, justice department lawyers questioned president 
clinton about fund-raising during his 1996 re-election campaign. One 
of the president's lawyers says the subject of the interview was democratic 
national committee issue ads. The investigation is looking into whether 
Mr. Clinton circumvented legal spending limits through the $40 million

were completely appropriate and were vetted beforehand by lawyers.
