A lot more to tell you about this Wednesday evening, including our 
conversation tonight with a man who has been there and done that, 
where weapons inspections in Iraq are concerned, Scott Ritter on the 
prospect of a U.S. air strike after this. D now a story of life and 
death. John was brilliant. We'll miss his brilliant conversations. 
John knew everything. We'll miss his knowledge. John wrote that consolidated 
contract. He didn't even tell us where he put it. Now they're really 
consumed with grief. If only they knew John scanned all of his documents... 
into the Xerox document center. He made them digital and put every 
last one of them on the company website. I wonder what John would 
do in this situation. He'd check your website to see if the Xerox 
document center... scanned in the consolidated contract. Hey, I just 
had a thought. Oh, there's a good place to start. You don't think 
John scanned the contract into the, uh, the-- the Xerox document center. 
Xerox document center, do you? John was smart, but he wasn't that 
smart. Ooohhh! I don't think John liked that.
