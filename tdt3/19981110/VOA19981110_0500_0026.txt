Republican Louisiana Congressman Bob Livingston is poised to become 
the next speaker of the U.S. House of Representatives, as his only 
rival dropped out of the race. Congressman Chris Cox of California 
withdrew his candidacy Monday citing the need for party unity. The 
race for the speaker's job got underway last week when Mr. Gingrich 
announced his resignation from the post.
