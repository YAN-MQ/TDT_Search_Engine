Countries must increase funding of the World Health Organization to 
avoid cutbacks in its activities, the agency's new director-general 
told its members Tuesday. Freezes have led to a 22 percent cut in 
real terms of WHO's budget over the last 10 years, said Brundtland, 
who was presenting a restructured agency after her first three months 
in the post. ``This trend cannot continue,'' she added. More money 
is needed to ``keep pace'' with diseases such as HIV/AIDS, Brundtland 
told reporters. The former Norwegian prime minister took over the 
50-year-old WHO in July, promising to address criticism that it was 
preoccupied with internal problems and lack of focus. The agency has 
now raised around half of a planned dlrs 10 million ``renewal fund'' 
to be spent over three years, Brundtland said. Its 50 programs have 
been reduced to 35 and reorganized under nine new senior managers. 
WHO has also launched new programs to combat smoking among young people 
and malaria. The agency has a two-year budget for this year and next 
of some dlrs 835 million. Voluntary contributions from governments 
should be in line with priorities identified by WHO itself, Brundtland 
said. ``It could happen that we may say no, thank you,'' to funding 
offers that don't meet those criteria, she added. WHO organizes massive 
vaccination efforts, coordinates global response to epidemics and 
fosters the widespread distribution of medicines. It has more than 
3,500 staff worldwide, some 1,300 of them based in Geneva. Staff were 
not laid off in the restructuring exercise.
