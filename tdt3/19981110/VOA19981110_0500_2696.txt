In Asia, stock prices fell in most markets. All seven percent Bangkok 
and the Nikkei 225 closed down 86 points at 14,108. That's about a 
half a percent. Hong Kong stocks, though, off more than one percent. 
That comes on the heels of yesterday's three percent loss. It's down 
130 points on the Hang Seng at 9721.
