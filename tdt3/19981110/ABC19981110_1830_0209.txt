There are strong indications tonight that the United States is getting 
ready to attack Iraq sooner, rather than later. For more than a week 
now, Saddam Hussein has been refusing to allow United Nations weapons 
inspections until economic sanctions are lifted against iraq. We go 
to Washington again for ABC's John McWethy. The U.S. is rushing more 
ships to the Persian gulf, a tomahawk cruise missile shooter and a 
Marine group. The actions and words seem so familiar. Time is running 
out on this. It can't go on forever. In fact, there are many indications 
that this time is different, that air strikes against Iraq are now 
probable, and may come soon. What is different is a much greater sense 
of frustration on the part of our allies, both in the security council 
and in the region and in Europe. There are no loud protests from either 
the French or the russians, who vehemently objected the last time 
the U.S. threatened to strike Iraq in February. There are no high-profile 
diplomatic initiatives aimed at heading off military action This is 
not a situation where we are looking for a negotiation. There is nothing 
to negotiate. It all seems to point unmistakeably towards use of force 
and doing it quickly could provide real tactical advantage. For example, 
intelligent sources say that Iraqi anti-aircraft missile batteries 
are still parked in Garrison, making them easy targets. John McWethy,
