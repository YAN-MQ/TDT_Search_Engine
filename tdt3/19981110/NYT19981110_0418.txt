Mayor Rudolph Giuliani on Tuesday defended his policy of delaying 
the distribution of food stamp and Medicaid applications to the poor 
and denied that his welfare commissioner had ever said the policy 
would change. Giuliani's remarks came as federal officials from the 
Agriculture Department and the Health Care Financing Administration 
continued their inquiry into the city's welfare policies. The federal 
officials have said the city appeared to be violating the law by delaying 
applications in an effort to discourage the needy from applying for 
welfare. Welfare Commissioner Jason Turner told The New York Times 
on Sunday that he planned to speed up the distribution of applications 
as an ``extra precaution'' to mollify federal officials. ``Our new 
policy is just to hand them a food stamp application,'' Turner said 
in the telephone interview, calling the change ``an improvement.'' 
But Tuesday, Giuliani denied that Turner had ever made that statement. 
The mayor did not explain why he did not dispute those comments Monday, 
the day when Turner's comments appeared. Colleen Roche, a spokeswoman 
for Giuliani, declined to elaborate Tuesday. Turner was not available 
for comment Tuesday, according to his press secretary, Debra Sproles. 
``The commissioner didn't say that,'' Giuliani said during a news 
conference Tuesday, referring to the comments published in The Times. 
``Sometimes, things aren't reported exactly the way somebody says 
something because there is an emotional or ideological bias that drives 
the way something is reported.'' Joyce Purnick, the metropolitan editor 
of The New York Times, dismissed Giuliani's accusations. ``Our reporter 
had two extensive conversations with Mr. Turner on Sunday, took detailed 
notes, and never got a subsequent complaint from him saying he was 
quoted incorrectly,'' Ms. Purnick said. ``We do not make things up, 
nor are our reporters politically motivated.'' Giuliani's remarks 
were the city's latest response to questions about the federal inquiry 
into his welfare policies. The topic is highly sensitive for the Giuliani 
administration because the mayor has repeatedly described his tough 
welfare policy as one of his administration's primary accomplishments. 
The mayor is particularly proud of his decision to convert welfare 
offices into ``job centers,'' where the needy are encouraged to rely 
on jobs, relatives and food pantries instead of government checks. 
In the job centers, the vast majority of people receive applications 
only on their second visit, the practice that touched off the federal 
inquiry. Federal law requires city officials to distribute food stamp 
and Medicaid applications on the first day that anyone walks into 
a welfare office. Turner said Sunday that the city would expedite 
the distribution of applications. Monday, city officials appeared 
to reverse themselves, saying they would not speed the process after 
all. Anthony Coles, a senior adviser to Giuliani, said the Agriculture 
Department had decided to judge the city's programs based on the 1996 
federal welfare law, which allows states and cities to delay welfare 
applications. The current law governing food stamps and Medicaid, 
however, requires city officials to distribute applications without 
delay. And officials from the Agriculture Department and Health Care 
Financing Administration said those existing laws still applied. Friday, 
Medicaid officials will meet with state health officials, who are 
responsible for monitoring the city's Medicaid program. The federal 
officials, who have requested copies of the city's application and 
referral procedures, hope to determine whether the city's program 
complies with federal law.
