not just the governance of East Timor that's in dispute in Asia. China 
is criticizing the Philippines for Manila's angry response to what 
Beijing is simply calling its repair of fishermen's shelters on a 
disputed reef in the South China Sea. VOA correspondent Roger Wilkison 
reports China's dismissal of Philippine protests came as Manila stepped 
up military patrols to discourage Chinese fishing boats from entering 
the area. The dispute centers around Mischief Reef in the Spratly 
Island chain that is contested in whole or in part by China, the Philippines, 
Taiwan, Vietnam, Malaysia, and Brunei. Last month, the Philippines 
accused Beijing of sending ships, including armed naval vessels, to 
the reef to beef up its facilities there. Earlier this week, Philippine 
Defense Secretary Orlando Magaval, charged China with carrying out 
what he called a creeping invasion and said the matter should be brought 
to the attention of the United Nations. But Chinese Foreign Ministry 
spokesman Zhu Bang Xao, speaking through an interpreter Tuesday, said 
his country is only repairing wind shelters for fishermen. Because 
of unresistable natural property of Chinese fishermen. Mr. Zhu says 
Beijing informed the Philippines that it would repair the shelters 
well in advance of the actual work. Philippine officials have admitted 
that China did inform them of its intentions but that a computer glitch 
delayed the message's arrival in Manila. Mr. Zhu criticized the Philippine 
reaction. The reaction by Philippine is not appropriate. is completely 
waiving China's sovereign rights. Still, the Philippines continues 
to express its displeasure. It says China is enhancing its facilities 
on Mischief Reef not repairing them. In announcing stepped up naval 
and air patrols in the area, Philippine presidential spokesman, Jerry 
Barikan, says they should not lead to any confrontation with China. 
Philippine President Joseph Estrada says he will take up the matter 
with Chinese President Jiang Zemin at an Asia Pacific Summit in Malaysia 
next week. Roger Wilkison, VOA News, Beijing.
