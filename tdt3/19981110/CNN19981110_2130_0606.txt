Winter storms are not created equal. Like hurricanes, they vary in 
severity. But unlike hurricanes, they don't have a rating system. 
A forecaster thinks they should. Rick Lockridge has more in "tech 
trends." Winter storms take lives and destroy property every year. 
There's no way to rate them, the way hurricanes are rated. One forecaster 
says it's time to change that. We are getting better at forecasting 
elements. It's hard to communicate that. Joe Sullivan's skate would 
give flurries a 1. What you do is you say, what is the impact on this 
area? Two inches of snow in Kansas city would be a higher category 
than two in duluth. It's more of what we call an impact scale. The 
impact of the weather on the area will define that number. Such a 
scale might help people prepare and help authorities to mobilize resources. 
Unlike a hurricane, where wind speed and barometer are indicaters 
of strench, winter storms have variables. It could be hard to get 
two meteorologist to agree. Not earn weather forecasters are awash 
in technology from satellite views to local readings. They are looking 
for ways to make more precise local forecasts. This new rating system 
could help. It will be tested by the national weather service this 
season in parts of nebraska and Wyoming. Rick Lockridge, CNN.
