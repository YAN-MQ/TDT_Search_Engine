A spokesman for Kosovo's separatist Albanian guerrillas on Tuesday 
accused Serb police of provoking fights and said any violence committed 
by his side is purely in self-defense. Adem Demaci, spokesman for 
the Kosovo Liberation Army, did specifically comment on Serb accusations 
that two of their police officers were kidnapped and summarily shot 
by the Albanian fighters. Ethnic Albanians accuse Serbs of opening 
fire first on a group of their men _ and of violating a U.S.-brokered 
cease-fire intended to halt hostilities between Serbs and the ethnic 
Albanians who make up 90 percent of Kosovo's population. Violence 
by both sides has increased in the past week, including at least three 
incidents in which police reported killing KLA fighters who shot at 
them first. The two policemen disappeared Friday, the same day Serb 
police shot to death five ethnic Albanian guerrillas, including a 
commander of two divisions. Both of the slain policemen had gunshot 
wounds to the head, indicating they had been killed execution-style. 
Serb police spokesman Bozidar Filic said the executions showed the 
Kosovo Liberation Army's utter disregard for the U.S.-sponsored cease-fire. 
He warned Monday that unless ```international representatives'' secure 
two main roads running through Malisevo by Wednesday, police will 
increase their patrols and ``allow safe passage'' _ indicating a possible 
new Serb action. David Scheffer, the roving U.S. ambassador on war 
crimes issues, viewed the bodies in Malisevo, a devastated central 
village, as he toured the area with the Kosovo Diplomatic Observer 
Mission. ``This represents one of the problems that is being experienced 
here with the cease-fire, and that is that there are violations of 
the cease-fire by both sides,'' Scheffer said. Serb authorities suspect 
the killed policemen were kidnapped by the KLA in retaliation for 
the shootings of the five guerrillas. The rebels say police shot at 
the five as they drove in two vehicles from Opterusa village, while 
police claim the guerrillas opened fire first. The KLA claims the 
killing of the five guerrillas violated a de facto cease-fire in Kosovo. 
Under a 4-week-old agreement between Milosevic and U.S. envoy Richard 
Holbrooke, Milosevic's forces were supposed to cease hostilities. 
Demaci, speaking in Pristina, sounded the same argument. He said the 
violence was due to provocations by the Serbian side ``to make international 
monitors believe it was the KLA violating the cease-fire.'' The guerrillas 
``are compelled to defend themselves whenever Serb forces try and 
reenter Albanian villages,'' he added. Speaking about last week's 
encounter between U.S. mediator Christopher Hill and KLA representatives, 
and Hill's presentation of a U.S.-sponsored draft peace plan for Kosovo, 
Demaci called the meeting ``a great and fruitful step forward.'' But 
he said the guerrillas had no comment yet on the plan. The guerrillas 
have grudgingly accepted the de-facto cease fire in Kosovo that calls 
for a large-scale cutback of Serb police and Yugoslav army forces 
in the province. But they refuse to agree to any plan that falls short 
of independence, and in past comments have rejected the draft, which 
calls only for a restoration of autonomy for Kosovo, a province of 
Serbia, the dominant Yugoslav republic. Demaci has been long at odds 
with Ibrahim Rugova, the Kosovo Albanian leader supported by foreign 
powers in his efforts at a peaceful accommodation with the Serbs. 
In an indirect slap at Rugova, Demaci on Tuesday criticized ``those 
in power (who) now refuse to relinquish even the tiniest part of that 
power.'' He said any chance of agreement between him and Rugova ``had 
passed by now.'' And he urged Rugova's people to stay out of plans 
to form an independent, predominantly Albanian police force for Kosovo, 
saying that role was reserved for KLA fighters. Dozens of Serb police 
were killed before and after the start of a Serb crackdown on ethnic 
Albanian separatists last February in Kosovo, a majority Albanian 
province. Several hundred other people, mostly ethnic Albanians, have 
been killed, and as many as 300,000 driven from their homes.
