For THE WORLD, this is Pamela McCall in the BBC Newsroom in London. 
France is canceling debts owed to it by Nicaragua and Honduras. The 
two countries took the brunt of floods unleashed by Hurricane Mitch, 
and Britain is also calling for suspension of its debt payments. The 
BBC's Andrew Walker has details. There's growing momentum in Europe 
for rapid action to ease the debt burden faced by these two countries 
whose economies have been devastated by the floods. The French decision 
is a unilateral one. It does not account for a large proportion of 
Central American debt, but it creates an important precedent which 
other lending countries may consider following. Germany and Spain 
have already expressed support for various measures to remove some 
of the immediate financial pressure on Central American countries. 
The British chancellor Checker Gordon Brown has proposed a suspension 
of all foreign debt payments by these countries. Andrew Walker reporting.
