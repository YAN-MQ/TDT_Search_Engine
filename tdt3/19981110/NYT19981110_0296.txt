NEW YORK _ ``Can I have your autograph?'' The request, from a New 
Jersey man awaiting his car at a parking garage near Times Square, 
seemed to hit Stephen DeRosa like a slap in the face. ``Are you crazy?'' 
screeched DeRosa, who had just finished another breakneck performance 
in ``The Mystery of Irma Vep,'' Charles Ludlam's Gothic romp at the 
Westside Theater/Downstairs. ``Surely you must be mistaken.'' Ah, 
fame. After years of temping, working in a video store and living 
off the kindness of his mother, DeRosa is unaccustomed to life as 
an actor with a recognition factor. He signs the man's Playbill: ``You're 
silly!,'' and ducks inside his own red Mercury Mystique, visibly unnerved 
by the brush with celebrity. Six weeks after the revival of ``Irma 
Vep'' opened to gushing reviews and packed houses, DeRosa is still 
adjusting ``to life in the theah-tah,'' he said, with an Olivia De 
Havilland flourish. He already has a budding fan club _ well, mostly 
retired teachers from his days at P.S. 193 in Whitestone, Queens. 
And even though his performance thrusts him into four disguises, strangers 
do occasionally recognize him on the street. ``It must be the nose,'' 
said DeRosa, a slight, shamelessly self-deprecating 30-year-old with 
thinning hair and basset-brown eyes who seems to take great pleasure 
in talking about psychotherapy, his mollycoddling mother and ``the 
dark years'' he spent as an underemployed actor. Not that a steady 
paycheck has affected his style of life. He still lives at home in 
Yonkers, dreams of the day he can afford to move to Manhattan, and 
carries an unshakable fear of the minimum wage. ``The best thing about 
the job so far is being able to see my therapist twice a week,'' he 
said before a recent show, sipping a decaffeinated espresso at a restaurant 
on Theater Row and venting feelings of guilt for having ordered two 
appetizers, a main course and dessert. His frenetic personality is 
tailor-made for the whirligig of ``Irma Vep,'' a cross-dressing sendup 
of both highfalutin and cheap horror films. He alternates as Jane 
Twisden, a prim, tight-jawed chambermaid, and Lord Edgar Hillcrest, 
a stodgy Egyptologist whose first wife, Irma Vep, has died under mysterious 
circumstances. He also makes a brief appearance as ``the intruder,'' 
a homicidal ghoul who looks like a cross between a werewolf, the Phantom 
of the Opera and ``someone with a really bad thyroid condition,'' 
as the actor described it. DeRosa's characters dart in and out after 
the instant costume changes that are the play's hallmark. In one scene, 
he struts offstage as the tweedy Lord Edgar and is back six seconds 
later as Jane, in flannel nightgown and five-foot-long auburn braid. 
The secret? ``Velcro, Velcro and more Velcro,'' DeRosa said. ``That 
is the real mystery of `Irma Vep.''' His onstage sparring partner 
and the director is Everett Quinton, who played DeRosa's roles 14 
years ago when Ludlam first produced and starred in ``Irma Vep'' in 
Greenwich Village. Ludlam, who died in 1987, was both companion and 
mentor to Quinton, and DeRosa said he was ever mindful of the author. 
``Sometimes, the legacy of Charles Ludlam can be overwhelming,'' he 
said. It is a legacy so weighty that DeRosa said he was still afraid 
to watch a videotape of Ludlam's performance. From the look of the 
current revival _ and according to those who have seen both it and 
the original _ DeRosa and Quinton are well matched for this tightly 
choreographed farce that would surely crumble under the weight of 
clashing egos. ``Charles had this incredible generosity that's necessary 
to make such an intense play work,'' Quinton said. ``Stephen has that 
generous spirit and a real respect for the play. And that's not just 
spin.'' About his co-star, DeRosa says simply, ``I feel like I'm working 
with Sid Caesar or Milton Berle.'' Not that DeRosa is dead wood. He 
can provoke laughter with a flash of Jane's brittle smirk or with 
lines like ``Here's your toddy,'' delivered in an accent that he admits 
he stole from the English maid on ``Frasier.'' Writing in The New 
York Times, Peter Marks called DeRosa ``Tim Conway to Quinton's Harvey 
Korman'' and described his performance as ``consistently smashing.'' 
Offstage, DeRosa is a volley of cartoonish voices, one-liners and 
goofy facial expressions. ``He's one of the most wildly funny people 
I've ever met,'' said the director Mark Lamos, who worked with the 
actor in ``Love's Fire,'' a series of one-acts by well-known American 
playwrights based on Shakespeare's sonnets. DeRosa made his acting 
debut at 12, when he starred as Tevye in his elementary school production 
of ``Fiddler on the Roof.'' The show's producer, Sally Berkowitz (who 
was also his sixth-grade teacher and forms the core of his fan club), 
still insists that young Stephen was better than Zero Mostel. ``So 
many people wanted to come see him, that we had to do the show twice,'' 
she crowed. Louisa DeRosa, his mother, couldn't agree more. ``Stephen 
began acting right after he was born,'' she said without a hint of 
exaggeration. ``At six weeks, he was posing for photos with his hand 
on his chin.'' Mrs. DeRosa was often so busy running her fast-food 
restaurant in Rockefeller Center that the babysitter for her only 
child was often the family television set. ``His first words were 
actually from a commercial,'' she said. As a boy, he spent his free 
time chatting with customers at his mother's restaurant or exploring 
midtown. Mrs. DeRosa called him the Mayor of 48th Street because he 
would roam the block and conduct mock interviews with strangers. ``Try 
to imagine a fat, annoying 8-year-old with a tape recorder,'' DeRosa 
said. ``That was me.'' He describes his parents as theatrical, larger-than-life 
people, ``the kind of folks who live for today, even if it's a little 
bit reckless.'' His father, a storefront lawyer in the Bronx, was 
a cigar-smoking, wisecracking man with a penchant for gambling and 
martinis. ``He was more Joe Pesci than `Father Knows Best,' '' DeRosa 
said of the elder DeRosa, who died when his son was 15. ``My mom is 
sort of like Auntie Mame,'' he added. ``She's very self-dramatizing 
and she believes that vanity is a virtue. For a long time, she was 
obsessed with me getting a toupee.'' He may have been acting all his 
life, but it was only two years ago that DeRosa actually got paid 
to perform _ in the Acting Company's well-received ``Love's Fire.'' 
DeRosa got himself noticed in the play by Tony Kushner, the massively 
titled ``Terminating, or Lass Meine Schmerzen Nicht Verloren Sein 
or, Ambivalence,'' in which he was cast as a neurotic gay man who 
desperately wants to sleep with his former therapist, a lesbian. ``When 
I read through the script, I thought, `Tony Kushner must have consulted 
my therapist,' '' DeRosa said. In more serious moments, he talks about 
the frustrating years he spent looking for acting work or trying to 
get by as a clerk at Blockbuster Video. After graduating from the 
Yale School of Drama in 1995 _ he applied three times before getting 
accepted _ he was unprepared, he said, for the endless rejections 
from casting directors. ``I figured I'd come out of Yale and they'd 
be clamoring to hire me,'' he said. In 1996, he put together a cabaret 
act at a piano bar in Greenwich Village and called it ``Wake Up and 
Smell DeRosa, or How I Learned to Stop Worrying and Love Unemployment.'' 
The title turned out to be a cruel joke on its author, who fell into 
a deep depression when the show closed. ``I call it my Dostoyevsky 
period,'' he said. ``It really made me question my decision to go 
into acting, and at that point I almost quit.'' He credits his mother 
with persuading him to stick with it. ``She would make me some food 
and say, `There's always tomorrow.'''
