Turning to another sport with a bat and a ball, cricket. The West 
Indies captain Brian Lara has apologized for the delay to the start 
of his team's first post apartheid tour of South Africa. Lara and 
his teammates arrived in Johannesburg Tuesday morning after resolving 
their dispute over pay and conditions with the West Indies Cricket 
Board in London on Monday. The late arrival forced the opening fund-raiser 
match against the Nicky Oppenheimer 11 to be canceled. Lara said he 
hoped people would be sympathetic. Lara said the West Indians thank 
South African President Nelson Mandela for the letter he sent them 
in London during the discussions urging the cricketers to resolve 
their differences.
