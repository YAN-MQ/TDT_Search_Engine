Iraq is reaching out for Arab support in its dispute with U.N. weapons 
inspectors. It says the use of military action will destabilize the 
region, but the United States is rejecting that. The U.S. state department 
says there are no plans to negotiate with Iraqi President Saddam Hussein. 
Defense secretary William Cohen has ordered the "USS enterprise" aircraft 
carrier to arrive in the Persian gulf ahead of schedule. It will replace 
the "USS Eisenhower." Cohen says Iraq is reponsible for a flagrant 
violation of U.N. mandates and that President Clinton is weighing 
various options. The security council's credibility is on the line. 
The U.N.'s credibility is on the line, and I think the U.S. credibility 
as well in terms of simply allowing him to flout his obligations. 
And I believe that most people now recognize that. And if it becomes 
necessary to take military action, I would expect that there would 
be certainly more support than before. The state department says if 
Iraq continues to block U.N. weapons inspectors it will be able to 
replenish its weapons of mass destruction in a matter of months.
