Estonian authorities on Tuesday turned off the sole water supply to 
a Russian border city because Ivangorod municipal authorities had 
not paid water bills totaling more than dlrs 1 million. Officials 
in the Estonian city of Narva, where the region's main water utility 
is located, said that non-payment of Ivangorod's water bill has been 
an ongoing problem that has been exacerbated by Russia's economic 
crisis. The cash-strapped Russian town of 12,000 residents says it 
doesn't have the money to pay. Estonia's government last year paid 
part of Ivangorod's water bill. Government spokesman Daniel Vaarik 
said the problem involved Estonian as well as municipal governments 
and also privately owned companies, which made finding a solution 
more difficult. ``This is a serious situation and very complicated 
to solve,'' he told The Associated Press. ``But someone has to pay 
the bill or the Narva Water Company, which is partly private, will 
go bankrupt. That would be a huge problem for Narva and all of Estonia.'' 
Narva and Ivangorod, about 120 miles (200 kilometers) east of Tallinn, 
have had a common water system since before World War II, when Ivangorod 
was part of Estonia. After Estonia was annexed by the Soviet Union 
in 1940, their infrastructures became more intertwined. With the Soviet 
collapse in 1991, Ivangorod fell under the jurisdiction of Russia 
and Narva remained part of Estonia, which is considered the most successful 
free-market reformer of the 15 former Soviet republics. Under Russia, 
Ivangorod's economy has fallen into near-ruin, while Narva's economy 
has thrived by comparison.
