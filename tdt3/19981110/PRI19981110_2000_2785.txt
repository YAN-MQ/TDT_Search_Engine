Tomorrow, Lisa takes us to a Fruit of the Loom plant in Londonderry 
to introduce us to a Protestant worker who feels completely comfortable 
visiting Derry Side, the Catholic side of town. Ten years ago, I wouldn't 
have went over to the Derry Side to drink in a bar at night or anything. 
There's just no way I could have done it. But now I go over, no problem. 
I would never have done that before I started. The Northern Ireland 
peace process goes to work tomorrow on THE WORLD.
