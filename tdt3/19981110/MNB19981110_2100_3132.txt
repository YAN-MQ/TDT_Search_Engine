Today in Paris, they marked the end of the world war II. Queen Elizabeth 
II and France's President Jacques Chirac led a ceremony that could 
be the last major anniversary to include veterans of what was supposed 
to be the war to end all wars. Hours after the ceremony, Chirac and 
her majesty also honored the memory of world war II, with the unveiling 
of a statue of Winston Churchill. The statue is modeled on a photograph 
of Churchill marching down the champs-elysees on this day in 1944.
