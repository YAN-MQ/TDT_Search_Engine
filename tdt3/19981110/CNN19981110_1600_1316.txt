Chiefs coach Marty schottenheimer made it perfectly clear how he feels 
about his team's quarterback situation. With the team struggling having 
lost four in a row, Elvis is out for now and rich is in. Elvis Grbac 
is the quarterback of the future of the Kansas city chiefs. I have 
no doubt about that, none whatsoever. Rich gannon is the quarterback 
for the Denver Bronco game. The two AFC west rivals square off Monday 
night in Kansas city.
