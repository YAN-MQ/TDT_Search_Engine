David Cone and Darryl Strawberry, longtime fixtures in New York's 
baseball panorama, could each work out the details on one-year contracts 
with the Yankees on Wednesday. Brian Cashman, the Yankees' general 
manager, acknowledged that he was in contact with Cone's agent Tuesday. 
Cone, who went 20-7 this season, can accept a $5.5 million option 
for the 1999 season by midnight Wednesday or reject it and become 
a free agent. Cone has twice extended the deadline, a strong indication 
that he is intent on working out a contract with the Yankees. Cone's 
preference is for a high-paying, two-year guaranteed contract, but 
the Yankees _ who may be leery of the condition of Cone's pitching 
shoulder _ may not be willing to guarantee a second year. According 
to an official with knowledge of the negotiations, the Yankees have 
offered to increase Cone's 1999 salary, to perhaps as much as $8 million, 
and could be open to the idea of giving Cone an option for the 2000 
season. Cone could not be reached for comment, and Cone's agent, Steve 
Fehr, indicated late Tuesday that he had nothing to say about the 
discussions. The Yankees hold a $2.5 million option for the 1999 season 
on Strawberry, and under normal circumstances the Yankees probably 
would not retain him. Strawberry is recovering from cancer surgery, 
however, and the Yankees' principal owner, George Steinbrenner, has 
made it known that he will exercise the option and keep Strawberry, 
the left-handed slugger, in the fold. But in negotiations with Eric 
Grossman, Strawberry's representative, Yankee officials are trying 
to structure a contract that would help the team financially in case 
Strawberry's return to the majors is delayed because of his rehabilitation 
from cancer. ``We know that it's going to get done,'' Grossman said 
Tuesday. ``Hopefully, it will be done by tomorrow, but we're not going 
to place an artificial deadline. ``He's going to be a Yankee next 
year. George is committed to him; he's committed to George.'' The 
Yankees must either conclude a deal Wednesday or agree to another 
extension that would give both sides more time to negotiate. Cashman 
has been in contact with the agent for pitcher Randy Johnson, but 
he would not comment Tuesday on whether the Yankees had formally extended 
an offer to Johnson, a left-handed free agent. Either way, conventional 
wisdom among executives with other teams is that the Yankees have 
little chance of landing him. The Yankees formally announced the signing 
of the third baseman Scott Brosius on Tuesday, about a week after 
he and the team agreed to a three-year, $15.75 million contract. Brosius 
batted .300 with 98 RBIs during the regular season and was the most 
valuable player of the World Series, making him an attractive free 
agent. Because he was intent on re-signing with the Yankees, however, 
he never really gave his agent, Tony Attanasio, a chance to field 
bids from other teams. ``My guess is that if we waited a little bit 
longer,'' Brosius said, ``there would have been at least as much and 
probably more'' money in an offer from another team. ``But New York 
was my first choice. They made a fair offer and there was no reason 
to check out others.'' His post-season heroics prompted endorsement 
offers, according to a team official, but Brosius returned almost 
immediately to his Oregon home. ``I just felt like the season was 
over and I wanted to get back,'' Brosius said. ``I could have stuck 
around and done some things and had some fun with it. But I have a 
wife and three kids and I wanted to get back to them.'' The signing 
of Brosius will allow the Yankees to dangle Mike Lowell, the team's 
most developed infield prospect, in trade talks for a center fielder. 
In July, the Yankees declined to make Lowell available in a possible 
deal for Johnson. The Yankees have explored the possibility of making 
a trade for Rondell White, Montreal's center fielder, and although 
the Expos do not seem interested now in making a deal, Lowell almost 
certainly would be involved if the two sides rekindled talks.
