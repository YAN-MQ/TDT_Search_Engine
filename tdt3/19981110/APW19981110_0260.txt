A South African boxer was recovering in intensive care Tuesday after 
collapsing following his knockout in a lightweight bout. George Mbatha 
underwent emergency surgery for blood on the brain at Eugene Marais 
Hospital, said hospital spokeswoman Hybie de Jager. ``He's OK. He's 
out of danger,'' said Heim Klopper, a spokesman for the Carousel Casino, 
where the amateur bout took place Monday evening. During a tournament 
at the casino, Mbatha was knocked out in the fifth round of the six-round 
bout by an uppercut from Kenyan Athanas Nzau. He walked out of the 
ring but collapsed in the dressing room, Klopper said.
