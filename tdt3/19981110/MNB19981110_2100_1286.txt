In a bizarre television turn of events, O.J. Simpson, who's been back 
in the news of late, placed a series of phone calls to MSNBC late 
today, two of which were live on the air. After a lengthy first call, 
Simpson called again after 7:00 eastern time to talk about the coverage 
of his first phone call. He spoke with anchors Chris jansing and John 
Gibson about the custody battle for his kids, Sydney and Justin. Yesterday, 
a California appeals court said no to custody for Simpson for now, 
pending another hearing, citing a question of violent tendencies. 
This time, unlike last time, the judge will allow evidence about the 
murder of the children's mother, Nicole brown Simpson. Here now some 
of what O.J. Simpson had to say to anchor Chris jansing. The body 
of your ex-wife was found right outside of her apartment, where the 
children were sleeping, where they could have found the body. And 
the justices questioned, if a person could perpetrate this crime, 
and he could do something, leave the body where the children could 
find it, he would be an unfit father. I mean, do you understand that 
reasoning? I would have to agree with them on that. You would agree 
with them on that. To me, to commit murder, is an unfit thing to do. 
So would you agree -- People have done it, were relatively good people 
have done it, and it unfortunately punctuated their entire lives. 
I do recognize that in a situation like that can happen. But I'm innocent. 
I didn't do it, and I went to court. To me, was proven in a criminal 
court of law that I didn't do T. my whole life is my kids. I take 
them to school, I play golf, I pick them up, and that's what I do. 
I don't think there's a parent in America that can spend more time 
with their kids than I spend with my two kids. I'd like to thinkhere's 
very few 10 and 13-year-old kids who are as well adjusted as my two 
are now. I wish America would get over it, leave us alone. If you 
leave use lone, we'll be fine. As we mentioned, a long, wide-ranging 
conversation, more of a one-way conversation with O.J. Simpson, much 
of it available on the web site tonight, MSNBC.com.
