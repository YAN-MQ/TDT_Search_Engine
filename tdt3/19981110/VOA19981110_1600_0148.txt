A spokesman for ethnic Albanian guerrillas fighting for the independence 
of Serbia's Kosovo province says his group should be included in talks 
on ending the violence. Adem Damache says talks that do not include 
the Kosovo Liberation Army have no chance of success. Yugoslav authorities 
have at times met with moderate Kosovo Albanian leaders but rejected 
all contact with guerrilla representatives calling them terrorists. 
Mr. Damache also accused the Serbians of provoking the latest violence 
in the area.
