Many of our local and FM medium wave affiliates are about to take 
a two-minute break, but we'll be back with you then. This is VOA News 
Now. Well, we're coming up on 15 hours universal time, which means 
that if you're listening to us in South or East - I guess you can't 
be in South and East Asia... Not at the same time. Unless you're on 
the border, but nobody knows where the border is. Right. Well, if 
you're listening in South Asia or if you're listening in East Asia, 
we are offering you a choice. You can stay tuned now for news and 
features in special English coming up in 15 hours universal time on 
short wave, 6.11, 9.76, 9.845, 12.05, and 15.46 megahertz short wave, 
or on 1575 kilohertz medium wave. Or you can stay with us in South 
Asia as VOA News Now continues on our current frequencies. And coming 
up two hours from now will be "Talk to America," VOA's daily call 
in and talk show. Let's find out what today's discussion will be. 
For almost 60 years, Hollywood has been recreating the battles, the 
passions, and the tragedies of World War II. Steven Spielberg's epic, 
"Saving Private Ryan," is one of the latest in this genre. No longer 
is war glorified or romanticized. This day on "Talk to America," movie 
critics Richard Fitzwilliams and Allan Silverman discuss the latest 
trends toward realism. That's Tuesday at 17 hours universal time for 
"Talk to America." That sounds appropriate to this week of remembrance 
for so many people around the world. That's coming up two hours from 
now on "Talk to America." Well, I'm Russ Woodgates with Barbara Kline. 
Stay with us. There's more VOA News Now still to come. It's 15 hours 
universal time. From Washington, this is VOA News Now...
