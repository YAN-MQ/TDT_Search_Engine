Well, as we heard in our news summary, the big story out of Indonesia 
today was the long-awaited start of talks by the Consultative Assembly 
aimed at creating a structure for Democratic elections. But while 
that was going on, in the much trouble province of East Timor, the 
Indonesian military said three of its soldiers were killed in a clash 
with separatists. From Jakarta, Jenny Grant reports that tension is 
rising in the territory in advance of this week's anniversary of a 
1991 massacre. Military officials say three soldiers and a civilian 
were killed when rebels attacked a military post in East Timor. The 
attack happened Monday in Alaf, some 200 kilometers south of the capital, 
Dele. Local residents say separatist guerrillas also stole guns from 
the military post. Tension is rising in East Timor in advance of the 
seventh anniversary of the Santa Cruz massacre, which falls on Thursday. 
Officials say 50 people were killed in the Santa Cruz cemetery on 
November the 12th, 1991 when Indonesian soldiers opened fire on a 
crowd of mourners at a funeral for an independence protester. Church 
and human rights groups say 200 people were killed in the massacre, 
which has become a symbol of Indonesia's military grip on the territory. 
Students in Dele plan a large but peaceful demonstration in the seaside 
capital to remember those who died in the massacre. The Monday attack 
against Indonesian soldiers follows a spate of killings last week. 
The government says groups opposing integration with Indonesia killed 
two soldiers, a policeman, and a civil servant in unprovoked attacks. 
The military has denied reports from pro-independent sources it's 
building up troop levels in the territory. The United Nations is hosting 
talks on the future of the former Portuguese territory, which Indonesian 
invaded in 1975. Indonesian President B.J. Habibie has offered special 
autonomy to East Timor. In exchange, he has asked the Hafilan territory 
be recognized as part Indonesia. This is Jenny Grant reporting for 
VOA News, Jakarta.
