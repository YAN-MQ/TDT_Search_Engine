Stocks slipped again Tuesday, as sellers emerged late in the day to 
push prices down for a second straight session. Traders and analysts 
cited a variety of reasons for the selloff. There is continuing concern 
about a slowdown in the growth of corporate earnings. Doubt persists 
that the Federal Reserve's policy-making committee will cut interest 
rates at a meeting Nov. 17. Renewed weakness in Asian markets, as 
well as heightened awareness that hostilities may soon break out again 
in Iraq, increased the jitters. And after rocketing higher for eight 
straight sessions, the market apparently still needed a breather. 
``This was a continuation of the consolidation that started on Monday,'' 
said Marshall Acuff, an equity strategist at Salomon Smith Barney. 
``Our market has come a long way _ it got some support early in the 
session but then faded at the end.'' The Dow Jones industrial average 
fell 33.98 points, to close at 8,863.98. More than 669.7 million shares 
were traded on the New York Stock Exchange, up from slightly less 
than 600 million Monday. Among broader market measures, the Standard 
&AMP; Poor's 500-stock index slipped 1.94 points, to 1,128.26. The 
Russell 2000 index of small capitalization stocks fell 1.57 points, 
to 396.86. But the Nasdaq composite index, aided by gains in several 
Internet stocks and Intel, the big semiconductor manufacturer, rose 
by 4.57 points, to 1,865.62. The Dow was hurt by continued weakness 
in oil and financial company stocks. Shares of J.P. Morgan &AMP; Co. 
fell again Tuesday, losing 2 1/2, to 97 5/8. American Express slid 
2 1/8 to 92 3/4. Chevron and Exxon, also Dow components, weakened 
as well. Chevron lost 1 15/16 a share, to 80 1/2. Exxon fell 1 11/16, 
to 70 5/16. DuPont, the nation's biggest chemical company, was the 
Dow's biggest loser. The stock fell 2 3/4, to 59 1/4, after BASF AG, 
Europe's biggest chemical maker, said that its business in the third 
quarter fell short of expectations, with little prospect for improvement 
this year. The declines in those stocks more than offset strong performances 
from IBM and McDonald's, other Dow components. Riding a wave of optimism 
about computer sales, IBM hit an all-time high Tuesday, rising 3 15/16 
a share, to 155 5/16. McDonald's rose 4 1/8, to 71 3/16, after the 
company told analysts that sales are improving here and abroad. Technology 
shares were broadly higher, and were helped in no small measure by 
wild, nearly manic buying of Internet stocks. For the second straight 
day, stocks in companies like Yahoo and Ebay rallied on speculation 
that holiday shopping using the Internet will jump. Online companies 
represented half of Tuesday's top 20 most-active issues. Yahoo shares 
rose 11 13/16, to 176 9/16. Amazon.com rose 4 7/8, to 131 3/4. And 
Ebay, an online auctioneer that went public in mid-September at $18 
a share, gained 27 7/8 a share, to 130 7/8, after analysts at Goldman 
Sachs, the firm that led its initial public offering, raised their 
target price to $150 a share. ``There is a lot of retail interest 
in the stocks, and some foreign money is going into them, because 
we have been active in them,'' said Ed Collins, a trader at Daiwa 
Securities. ``It's almost like a feeding frenzy.'' Optimism about 
the upcoming Christmas season also helped to push up Intel shares 
1 9/16, to 97 9/16. After the market closed, the company said that 
fourth-quarter results would exceed expectations.
