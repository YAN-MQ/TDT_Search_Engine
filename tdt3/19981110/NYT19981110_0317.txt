Ralph Fiennes devotees will recall that the 1992 television film, 
``A Dangerous Man: Lawrence After Arabia,'' more or less introduced 
the actor to the United States. It's unlikely, however, that viewers 
also caught the fleeting presence of a younger Fiennes, Joseph, playing 
Ralph's onscreen brother. (So tiny is the part that the lesser-known 
Fiennes does not make the credit roll.) Six years, and many more substantial 
parts later, 28-year-old Joseph Fiennes is emerging as a name to reckon 
with on his own. His role next month as Gwyneth Paltrow's Bardic suitor 
in ``Shakespeare in Love'' is expected to clinch him as a separate 
but equal talent to that of his Tony-winning, Oscar-nominated brother. 
Not that Fiennes particularly welcomes comparisons, however inevitable. 
Although he talks freely about his family _ he and Ralph are two of 
seven children _ Joseph wants recognition for his merits, not his 
surname. (At least he is spared the pronunciation issue: after the 
success of Ralph _ as in `Rafe' _ everyone knows Fiennes is pronounced 
fines.) ``I've put in a lot of work, and I just get a bit concerned 
when people think, `Oh, he's got the job because of x, y and z.' '' 
said Fiennes recently at a trendy West London ``gastro-pub.'' Those 
worries will likely recede once more people see the younger actor's 
work. Joseph can be thought of as putting a kinder, gentler _ OK, 
cuter _ face on Ralph's well-known intensity. Just as it is hard to 
imagine the doe-eyed Joseph playing the SS officer Amon Goeth in ``Schindler's 
List'' _ his brother's career-making part _ it is equally hard to 
envision Ralph bringing the same innocent ardor to ``Shakespeare in 
Love'' or ``Martha _ Meet Frank, Daniel, and Laurence,'' the English 
romantic comedy due in the United States this spring. Indeed, the 
single Fiennes seems to have cornered the young swain market. This 
fall, one could not navigate the London Underground without seeing 
his face advertising the new film ``Elizabeth,'' in which he plays 
Robert Dudley, Earl of Leicester, with the single word ``Lover'' emblazoned 
across the poster. In context, it's little surprise that his other 
credits include a Romeo for the complete spoken-word Shakespeare recorded 
by Arkangel as well as the smoldering young haberdasher in the Peter 
Whelan play ``The Herbal Bed'' for the Royal Shakespeare Company in 
1996. Charles Spencer wrote of the performance in The Daily Telegraph 
that Fiennes conveyed ``raw anguish as the self-tormenting lover.'' 
(That character's name, incidentally, was Rafe.) ``His passion is 
very hot, I think,'' said Adrian Noble, artistic director of the RSC, 
who had watched Ralph emerge within the same company nearly a decade 
before. ``I wouldn't call Joe a cuddly actor. He's not warm in that 
sense; he's warm in the heat of passion.'' As for the charm he projects 
in ``Shakespeare in Love,'' playing a heartsick young Elizabethan 
poet-playwright named Will Shakespeare, ``I don't think Joe plays 
it,'' said the film's director, John Madden (``Mrs. Brown''). ``I 
think he simply has it. There's an openness there, and a kind of vulnerability, 
too.'' That may be why Fiennes speaks of wanting to be cast against 
type _ of playing Mercutio, say, instead of Romeo. In the London production 
of Nick Grosso's play ``Real Classy Affair,'' he played a smooth-talking 
hipster whose shiny suits hide a malevolent spirit. A forthcoming 
film, ``Rancid Aluminum,'' casts him as a psychopathic Irish bookkeeper. 
Early next year, Fiennes will travel to Miami to make his first American 
film, ``Forever Mine,'' directed by Paul Schrader. ``I have to age 
up 15 years, and get shot in the face,'' said Fiennes, sounding pleased. 
``It's character acting again. You can't beat it.''
