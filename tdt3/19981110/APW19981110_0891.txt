A British expert on performance-enhancing drugs expressed optimism 
Tuesday that tests for human growth hormone, and possibly EPO, will 
be ready in time for the 2000 Sydney Olympics. Professor David Cowan, 
director of the Drug Control Center at King's College London, said 
the doping lab in Sydney was prepared to institute any new testing 
procedures at short notice. ``We are optimistic we will be able to 
do some things in Sydney,'' Cowan said in a telephone interview. ``I'm 
more optimistic about HGH (human growth hormone) than EPO (erythropoietin) 
at the moment.'' No valid tests exist for detecting HGH and EPO, banned 
drugs which are believed to be the doping products of choice among 
many athletes. Growth hormone helps build strength, while EPO _ the 
drug at the center of this summer's Tour de France scandals _ is an 
endurance-boosting hormone. Research to develop tests for the two 
drugs has been proceeding in labs in London and other cities. The 
International Olympic Committee says it will only introduce new tests 
if they are 100 percent foolproof. Cowan, whose lab has done research 
on HGH administration, said he believes blood samples would be required 
if reliable HGH and EPO tests were used in Sydney. ``If we are to 
detect growth hormone by the year 2000, then blood samples will be 
necessary,'' he said. ``I believe that blood is the necessary medium 
in the time span we are talking about.'' Cowan said progress on finding 
an EPO test has been more limited because of a lack of research funds. 
``If I was pinned down about EPO, I would say there is a bit more 
chance of using urine than blood,'' he said. ``But by the year 2000, 
blood is necessary if a test will work.'' Standard drug testing is 
done on urine samples only. Some experts oppose blood testing on practical, 
moral and even religious grounds. Cowan sought to clarify remarks 
he made athe Olympic Games (SOCOG) said Tuesday the IOC does not test 
blood samples and has said it won't do so until 100 percent reliable 
tests are found for EPO and HGH. ``Our understanding is that research 
is still continuing into finding a totally reliable test for these 
substances but it hasn't been achieved yet,'' the spokesman said. 
SOCOG doping officials have consistently said they are ready to implement 
blood tests if scientists find the answers and the IOC gives them 
the green light.
