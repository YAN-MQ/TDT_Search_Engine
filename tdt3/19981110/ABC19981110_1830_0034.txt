Good evening. This time of year it's always a matter of sooner or 
later. And it's sooner for the most part this year. A massive snow 
storm, which began in the rocky mountains and has now taken a first 
real whack at the midwest. There's the computer driven reality. The 
storm is on its way east. Everything you see in orange or yellow is 
inclement weather to say the least. Very often, thunderstorms from 
Canada all the way to the gulf. But in the midwest, it is snow. Lots 
of snow. ABC's Jim Williams starts off with the dakotas. In much of 
the uper midwest visibility was so poor, is was slow going or no going 
at all. It was the first whiteout of the season. More than 600 miles 
of major highways in the dakotas, Minnesota and nebraska had to be 
shut down. Up to a foot of snow and ice and 60 mile an hour winds 
made it too dangerous to drive anyway. Hundreds of motorist who did 
slid into ditches or overturned. Conditions are deteriorating. Hundreds 
of schools were closed and crews worked to repair power lines in the 
muck. It's all clay around here. The bad weather stretched from the 
grate lakes south to the gulf of Mexico. It has been one of the strongest 
low pressure systems in the last 25 years. By having the pressure 
this low, the upper level support and the dynamics for this system 
were strong enough to create a circulation around a pattern that was 
essentially like an inland hurricane. In Missouri it destroyed homes. 
And in fayette, Tennessee, E storm system spawned a tornado. The winter's 
first storm is far from over. Tonight it's headed northeast. Jim Williams,
