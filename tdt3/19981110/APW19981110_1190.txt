In an unprecedented move that could lead to a showdown on press freedoms, 
Athens' chief prosecutor Tuesday put the country's newspapers on notice 
that executives face arrest for publishing what authorities deem as 
sex-for-hire advertisements. ``It hits freedom of the press and includes 
all newspapers,'' said Fotis Siumburas, chief editor of the Athens 
afternoon daily Apoyevmatini. The move comes as Greek authorities 
struggle with a growing corruption scandal that includes allegations 
of police protection for prostitution rings. Some government opponents 
have called for a moral crusade in the traditionally conservative 
nation. Prosecutor Giorgos Koliokostas sent an order to the country's 
security police demanding the arrest of the publisher and editor of 
any newspaper which prints advertisements encouraging ``another's 
vice,'' according to police and judicial sources. Trial could come 
within 24 hours. The order gives the police latitude to determine 
whether there was a violation of the ban on sex-for-hire advertisements, 
which apparently could include the many massage and escort notices 
that fill pages in some newspapers. Editors say it is not the first 
time that prosecutors have tried to crack down on what many consider 
to be sex-for-hire ads. But in the past, authorities could only act 
if someone complained. ``Until now if there was something, if would 
be prosecution after a complaint. We were acquitted of something like 
this a few days ago,'' Siumburas said. Prostitution is legal in Greece 
in state-registered brothels, but an estimated 20,000 unregistered 
prostitutes _ most from Eastern Europe _ are working in Greece. The 
last time such a blanket order was issued against the media was in 
1991, when the conservative government then running Greece issued 
a law banning the publication of statements issued by terrorist groups. 
A number of publishers was arrested at the time for defining the ban, 
which was repealed shortly afterwards.
