The family of Nigeria's late dictator, Gen. Sani Abacha, has handed 
back to the government more than dlrs 750 million in state funds illegally 
amassed by the former leader, a government spokesman said. The money 
has been deposited into a special account at the Central Bank of Nigeria, 
government spokesman Mohammed Haruna told reporters Monday. During 
his five-year military dictatorship, Abacha diverted hundreds of millions 
of dollars in government funds to his personal accounts. Since his 
death in June, Abacha's family has returned vast sums of money. The 
government has put pressure on family members to return the money, 
confiscating the passports of Abacha's wife and some of his children, 
and keeping some family members under surveillance Others in Abacha's 
government also allegedly siphoned money from the state to amass personal 
fortunes. Nigeria's former finance minister, Anthony Ani, said Abacha's 
national security adviser Ismail Gwarzo channeled about dlrs 1.3 billion 
worth of foreign reserves into private accounts. Although accustomed 
to military rule and conflict, Nigeria suffered enormously under Abacha, 
whose leadership was marked by divisive policies, endemic and institutionalized 
corruption and brutal repression. Abacha was replaced by another military 
leader, Gen. Abdulsalami Abubakar, who has vowed to hand power over 
to an elected civilian government. Abubakar has been working to free 
political prisoners and redress the financial mismanagement that marked 
Abacha's tenure.
