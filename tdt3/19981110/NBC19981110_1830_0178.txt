These ferocious winter storms are so dangerous, national weather officials 
have decided to adopt the model of the national hurricane center and 
rank them as part of an early warning system. More on that tonight 
from NBC's Jim Avila. Today's plains blizzard -- powerful winds, heavy 
snow -- until now, no clear way to rank how bad it really is. But 
now a new pilot program at the national weather service will rank 
the storms on a scale from 1 to 5, like hurricanes. That storm would 
be rated as a category 5 in my book. Starting December 1st, William 
Parker, government meteorologist in Cheyenne, will issue warnings 
to 15 counties in Wyoming and Nebraska. Clear, concise, numbered weather 
alerts that measure storm factors from wind speed and temperature 
to wind chill and snowfall. Labeling the storm in advance from wx 
1 to wx 5. categories 1 to 3 are inconveniences, but 4 and 5 are serious 
stay-inside weather. We're hoping by reading this system we're preventing 
people from making stupid decisions. These strong winds will continue 
today. Cattle rancher Ed weppner, constantly glued to his weather 
radio, likes the idea of a clear, ranked storm scale. It's a lifesaver 
for his 850 cattle. So this numerical rating, I think, will make things 
much simpler. The storm season got an early start. A severe test for 
the new system. El Nino is gan replaced by La Nina, the tropical pacific 
weather pattern that features temperatures seven to ten degrees keerl 
than normal. Cooled ocean air from the jet stream rushes over the 
U.S., making for a Colder, rougher winter. This winter will certainly 
feel like a more old-fashioned winter than last year. The national 
weather service predicts heavier snowfall and colder temperatures 
than normal -- a perfect winter to test storm warnings. Jim Avila,
