Now turning to American style football, Pittsburgh Steelers quarterback 
Cordelle Stewart benched last week for ineffective play returned to 
the lineup Monday night to pass and run his team past the visiting 
Green Bay Packers 27 to 20. Stewart completed 15 of 22 passes for 
231 yards and ran for 41 more, while the Pittsburgh defense stifled 
Green Bay quarterback Brett Favre for three-quarters. Stewart says 
it was the kind of game he always wanted to play. It was fun. This 
is my first time actually having fun the way I'm used to having. And, 
yes, it was my best game to go out and not throw any fakes and to 
actually get out there and complete the passes with a touchdown and 
score one, jumping over the top. Opposing quarterback Brett Favre 
finished with 22 of 39 passes for 234 yards and one interception. 
However, he was held to 71 passing yards in the first half while the 
Pittsburgh offense ran roughshod over Packers defenders.
