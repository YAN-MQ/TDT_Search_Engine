Now some interesting news from Germany. The German government is set 
to outlaw tax deductions for bribes paid to foreign officials. And 
that falls in line with a U.S.-led drive to fight corruption and promote 
in overseas markets. And that's part of a package of proposed tax 
reforms presented by the government of Chancellor Schroeder. And Barbara, 
Russ, that pretty well wraps it up. That could actually raise competitiveness 
with some American companies 'cause American businessmen get into 
trouble if they pay bribes and the government finds out about it. 
That's right. It's been a real sore spot in the international community 
about having to pay bribes in some countries.
