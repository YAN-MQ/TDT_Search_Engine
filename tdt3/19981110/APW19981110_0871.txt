In an ongoing purge of Serbia's independent media, the government 
Tuesday took control of a popular radio station, and police impounded 
all 100,000 copies of a leading daily. Radio Index, a student-run 
Belgrade radio, was first shut down last month for allegedly broadcasting 
without a license. On Tuesday, the Belgrade university board, complying 
with government demands, announced it was replacing the station's 
team of editors, B-92 radio reported. The editor-in-chief of Radio 
Index, Nenad Cekic, who already faces criminal charges, disputed the 
board's decision. He said the state-run body had given up any editorial 
control over the radio a long time ago. Radio Index later issued a 
formal statement saying they reject the decision. Earlier, police 
raided the headquarters of Dnevni Telegraf daily and confiscated its 
Tuesday edition. The action came after the daily failed to pay a fine 
of 1.2 million dinars (dlrs 120,000) to the state for allegedly breaching 
a restrictive media law. Despite the crackdown, the owner of Dnevni 
Telegraf vowed to keep publishing. The moves against the two media, 
known for their criticism of President Slobodan Milosevic's autocratic 
regime, are the latest in a series of crackdowns against Serbia's 
fledgling independent media following the adoption of the restrictive 
information law last month. A Belgrade district court ruled Sunday 
that Dnevni Telegraf (Daily Telegraph) chiefs would have to pay the 
steep amount for ``publishing information inciting destruction of 
the constitutional order.'' Dnevni Telegraf owner and chief editor 
Slavko Curuvija said he would continue printing his newspaper in Bulgaria, 
Hungary, Bosnia or the Yugoslav republic of Montenegro. ``They will 
have to keep their policemen on all these countries' borders if they 
want to continue confiscating my paper,'' Curuvija said. Responding 
to the crackdown, opposition leader Zoran Djindjic said Tuesday his 
Democratic Party had initiated legal proceedings against the state-run 
Politika daily for publishing ``lies and slander'' about Djindjic.
