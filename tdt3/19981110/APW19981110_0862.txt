In a trial about clashing cultures as well as laws, a Muslim couple 
from Morocco was convicted Tuesday of abducting their daughter because 
they felt she had become too Norwegian. The daughter, identified only 
as 19-year-old Nadia, grew up mostly in Norway and like many Norwegian 
teens liked to go out dancing and drinking alcohol _ in violation 
of Islamic religious teachings _ with her friends. In trial at Oslo 
City Court, she claimed her parents found such behavior appalling, 
and forcibly brought her to Morocco in hopes of changing her views. 
The trial was avidly watched by native Norwegians and immigrants alike. 
It was seen as setting a legal benchmark for tolerance of traditional 
customs and religious beliefs that can conflict with what activities 
and attitudes commonly accepted in liberal Norway. In its ruling, 
the Oslo court found the parents guilty of abducting their daughter. 
It sentenced the father to 15 months and the mother to one year in 
prison, plus fines and court costs totaling 75,000 kroner (dlrs 10,000). 
However, the court suspended the jail sentences. The public prosecutor 
who filed the case said sending the parents to jail would make family 
reconciliation more difficult. During the trial, Nadia testified she 
was drugged, handcuffed and driven in a van for five days before arriving 
in Morocco in August 1997. ``Mama said the house was on fire, and 
that we had to get out. She helped me put on clothes and make it down 
the stairs,'' Nadia testified. ``When I looked around, there was no 
fire. I shouted for help once, but then mama put her hand in front 
of my mouth and pushed me in the van.'' Norwegian officials discovered 
what happened after Nadia's employer at a grocery store reported her 
missing when she failed to show up at work. Norway's ambassador to 
Morocco, Arne B. Honningstad, managed to track her down in her parents' 
hometown of Nador. In court, he said Nadia told him by phone that 
she was being held against her will. He spoke with her parents on 
her behalf. Honningstad quoted Nadia's mother as screaming, ``All 
Norwegian women are whores. I don't want Nadia to be Norwegian,'' 
according to an account of the trial published by the Oslo newspaper 
Aftenposten. After a month, Nadia's father gave in and allowed his 
daughter to return to Norway, where she went into hiding and would 
only appear in court. Norwegian police then charged the parents with 
kidnapping. The parents claimed Nadia had travelled with them willingly. 
``There were never any problems between me and Nadia about religion 
or her lifestyle,'' the father said in court. The parents said they 
would appeal the ruling to a higher court. Neither their names nor 
Nadia's last name were reported, in keeping with Norwegian practice.
