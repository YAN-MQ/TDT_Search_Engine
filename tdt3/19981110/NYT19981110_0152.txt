Both Neiman Marcus and Williams-Sonoma have made their reputations 
offering high-quality products. Now each company is offering an impressive 
mail-order catalog devoted to food. The companies' size and prestige 
make them hard to ignore in a roundup of mail-order food for the holidays. 
But the results from both companies point up the inevitable problems 
when ordering from large companies. Using another name, I ordered 
six items by phone from Williams-Sonoma. The catalog explains that 
merchandise is only delivered on Thursdays and must be ordered by 
6 p.m. on Wednesday of the previous week. I asked if I could order 
two weeks in advance and was assured that I could. So I was surprised 
to find that some of the food arrived one week before I wanted it. 
When I called the company, the customer service representative apologized 
but could not explain why part of the order had come early without 
the rest of the items (which arrived at the right time). A supervisor 
explained that orders could only be placed one week in advance and 
that the person who had taken my order had been mistaken. She, too, 
apologized, credited my account for the full amount and sent out a 
$100 Williams-Sonoma gift certificate. Such a system is hardly customer-friendly: 
If food can only be delivered on Thursday, obviously anything you 
order for a Tuesday party will be five days old. The quality of some 
of the food was also surprising, especially considering the prices. 
Eight three-ounce crab and scallop cakes for $48 had more filler than 
seafood; two three-ounce cheese rounds at $28 were so hard they could 
not be cut with a knife, and four 14-ounce stuffed pork chops at $55 
were dry and tasteless. (None of these prices include shipping.) Neiman 
Marcus requires seven business days to deliver. Of the three perishable 
items I ordered, one arrived on the day specified, a Friday. I called 
about the others and asked to have them shipped again on Saturday 
for Sunday delivery. I was assured that the company would if possible, 
but that in any case someone would call me on Saturday. On Saturday, 
the second item arrived from the original shipment, a day late and 
too warm to be safe to use; the promised phone call never came. The 
following Monday the third item arrived (again from the original shipment), 
three days late and certainly not edible. Still no phone call. When 
I called customer service on Monday, I received an apology and a refund 
_ but neither of those things helped my party.
