For something really spectacular, take a look at Internet stocks today. 
Optimism that online shopping will grow sharply this holiday season 
sent online auctioneer E-bay to a stunning gain of 28 3/16. E-bay 
went public in September at just $18 a share. Other double digit gainers 
-- one analyst cautions investors to take a cold shower if they catch 
the Internet stock fever. I think we've had the bear market. Now this 
rebound makes me uncomfortable. This is just too much too soon. I 
would expect to consolidate. But if Internet stocks become the play 
of choice because its momentum play and you figure well I can put 
some money to work there, because they're popular trading vehicles, 
I'd be very, very cautious.
