The Intel Corp. said Tuesday that its fourth-quarter results will 
be above expectations. Intel said stronger-than-anticipated demand 
for personal computers across all market segments and global regions 
will increase revenues and profit margins for the quarter. Intel's 
announcement came after the close of the market, but its shares had 
already risen in anticipation of strong PC sales, together with those 
of the Dell Computer Corp. Shares of Intel closed at $97.5625, up 
$1.5625, while Dell rose $1.3125, to $70.3125, both in Nasdaq trading. 
In after hours trading, Intel rose to $100.25. Intel reported stronger-than-expected 
earnings last month, but said then that it expected fourth-quarter 
revenue to be up only slightly relative to the third quarter's $6.7 
billion. On Tuesday Intel said it expects revenue to be up about 8 
percent to 10 percent from the third quarter, and that profit margins 
would be up a couple of points from 53 percent in the third quarter. 
Higher margins reflect both higher sales, and the mix of products 
sold during the quarter. Although Intel did not specifically say that 
earnings would exceed the consensus estimate, Wall Street analysts 
said they would be raising their numbers. Analysts had expected Intel 
to earn 95 cents a share in the quarter. Intel earned 98 cents a share 
in the fourth quarter of 1997. ``PC demand is solid; it's seasonally 
strong, and Intel has been in an extremely strong position to benefit 
both from the uptick in demand and the end of a pretty severe inventory 
correction,'' said Mark Edelstone, an analyst with Morgan Stanley. 
Noting that Intel had reduced inventories at the end of the last quarter 
to their lowest level in a dozen years, he said, ``You have to believe 
their factories are running flat out, and that is always good for 
margins.'' Intel said it expects expenses in the fourth quarter to 
be about 8 percent to 10 percent higher than third-quarter expenses 
of $1.4 billion, up from its earlier guidance of 3 to 5 percent higher. 
Expenses are dependent in part on the level of revenue. Intel said 
that it expects to be within a few hundred people of its previously 
announced staff reduction goal of approximately 3,000 employees by 
the end of the year. For the third quarter, ended Sept. 26, Intel 
reported earnings of $1.56 billion, or 89 cents a diluted share, down 
slightly from $1.57 billion, or 88 cents a share. Per share figures 
reflect an increase in the number of shares outstanding. Revenues 
grew 9 percent, to $6.73 billion.
