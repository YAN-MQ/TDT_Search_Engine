I'm Dave DeForest, VOA News. The United States is speeding up the 
deployment of U.S. warships as it consults with other nations on actions 
against Baghdad. The action is being taken in response to Iraq's refusal 
to allow U.N. weapons inspections. Secretary of Defense William Cohen 
is ordering two groups of warships to speed their arrival in the Persian 
Gulf. VOA's Jim Randle reports the change will boost the number of 
warplanes and cruise missiles available for a strike on Iraq. Mr. 
Cohen is ordering an aircraft carrier battle group and an amphibious 
ready group to make their way to the Persian Gulf as quickly as possible. 
The change adds 50 strike aircraft from the U.S.S. Enterprise and 
a large number of cruise missiles from the smaller escort ships to 
the combat power already deployed in the Gulf. One aircraft carrier 
and 20 other ships are already on station in the Gulf. Mr. Cohen says 
he does not plan to keep both carriers in the Gulf at the same time 
for very long. The secretary says the president has not decided to 
use force but time is running out. The military options certainly 
still are on the table. We would prefer and he would much prefer to 
see this resolved peacefully. Secretary Cohen says the change will 
get most of the ships to the Gulf on November 23rd instead of the 
26th as previously planned. Jim Randle, VOA News at the Pentagon.
