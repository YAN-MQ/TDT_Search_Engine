Few British people have kind things to say about the city of Birmingham, 
England. Its architecture is brutal concrete. Its mediocre soccer 
team tries the patience of even the most die hard fans. As if they 
didn't have enough problems, now Birmingham's two million inhabitants 
are losing Christmas. The city council has decided to rename the holiday 
Winterval, as in winter and festival. Birmingham has a multi-cultural 
population which includes Hindus, Muslims, Seiks and Jews. Local leaders 
say they've given the season a secular name so that non-Christian 
residents won't feel excluded. But the bishop of Birmingham, the right 
Reverend Mark Santa - that's his real name - says Winterval is ridiculous. 
Making up a name like this doesn't really excite the imagination very 
much, and it seems to me a way of avoiding talking about what everybody 
knows it is, which is Christmas. I mean, Christians have Christmas, 
Hindus have the Warly, Muslims have Ede, Jews have Hanukkah, and I 
don't think you should beat about the bush. As for the citizens of 
Birmingham, they're not too happy at the prospect of singing, "We 
wish you a merry Winterval." I think it's rather foolish to be honest. 
I don't see the point; political correctness really isn't the right 
thing to do. It just isn't right. It's Christmas and well, it's Christ's 
birthday. There should be more traditional. Obviously they're forgetting 
the fact that, you know, where the tradition started. I don't know 
why they're changing it. To be fair to Birmingham's leaders, they 
insist that Christmas will still exist, just as a part of Winterval. 
But perhaps they might look back at the time five years ago when they 
had to scrap a plan to call their Christmas lights festive lights. 
The locals greeted that idea as if it were a lump of coal in their 
Christmas stocking.
