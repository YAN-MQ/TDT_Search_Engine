In the meantime, an annual survey shows American women are making 
slow but steady progress and gaining top executive positions at U.S. 
corporations. Yes, but be that as it may, as correspondent Breck Ardery 
tells us from New York, women executives are still earning significantly 
less than men when it comes to those big salaries and even bigger 
bonuses. The survey was conducted by Catalyst, a research group which 
specializes in women's issues. It shows American women now occupy 
more than 11 percent of top U.S. corporate positions rising from 10-1/2 
percent last year. But Catalyst president Sheila Wellington says women 
executives earn far less than their male counterparts. Even at the 
very apex of corporate leadership, women, top earning corporate officers 
earn 68 cents in salary and bonus to every dollar earned by the top 
men. The research also shows that of the 500 largest corporations 
in the United States, only two - the Mattel Toy Company and Golden 
West Financial - have women chief executive officers. Ms. Wellington 
says the lack of women corporate chiefs is caused primarily by the 
fact that women tend to be concentrated in staff or support positions 
while men dominate the line or strategic positions. Line jobs are 
the jobs that generally lead to the fairly upper most ranks of executive 
leadership. So if women aren't in those jobs, and as I said, 94 percent 
of all line officer positions are held by men, then the pipeline in 
and of itself is not going to push women to the top. Ms. Wellington 
says the research demonstrates that despite progress, the so-called 
glass ceiling which limits women's advancement in American corporations, 
continues to exist. However, she also says that compared to corporations 
based in Asia and Europe, American companies are world leaders in 
promoting women to top positions. Breck Ardery, VOA News, New York.
