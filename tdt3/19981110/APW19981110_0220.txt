The defense ministry is urging young men to join the Sri Lankan army, 
saying its war against Tamil Tiger separatists had entered a decisive 
stage and it was in need of heroes. ``All patriotic youths of this 
country are hereby invited to come forward as heroes of the land to 
engage in this national endeavor ...,'' the ministry said in an advertisement 
appearing Tuesday in the state-run newspaper the Daily News. Fourteen 
recruitment centers will open island-wide for three weeks beginning 
Nov. 18 to take applications from unmarried males between the ages 
of 18 and 24. The 100,000-personnel Sri Lanka army is besieged by 
desertions and general lack of enthusiasm among able-bodied men to 
serve in the battlefield. The army, which has been fighting Tamil 
Tiger separatists since 1983, estimates the number of deserters at 
between 8,000 to 12,000. Three amnesties were declared this year under 
which deserters could return without risking punishment. An estimated 
10,000 responded, but other soldiers continued to desert. The government 
launched its last nationwide campaign to bring back deserters after 
heavy battles in September left at least 1,800 soldiers and rebels 
dead or missing. Tamil rebels are fighting for a homeland in the country's 
north and east, claiming that they are discriminated against by the 
majority Sinhalese who control the government and the military. The 
government denies the charge. More than 55,000 people have died in 
15 years of fighting.
