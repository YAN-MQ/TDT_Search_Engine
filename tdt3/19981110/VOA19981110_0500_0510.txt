Delegates from 161 nations are nearing the end of their work in Buenos 
Aires, Argentina trying to establish clear mechanisms aimed at reducing 
worldwide air pollution. But as VOA's Greg Flakus reports from Buenos 
Aires, there are few signs of progress being seen as the United Nations 
Conference enters its final days. Although they are scheduled to wrap 
up by the end of this week, the delegates to the fourth United Nations 
Conference on climate change had yet to resolve many of the larger 
questions they brought to the gathering last week. The task before 
them is to establish specific guidelines and action plans to carry 
out what they agreed to last year in Kyoto, Japan. Under the Kyoto 
protocol, 38 industrialized nations committed to five percent reductions 
in greenhouse gas emissions from 1990 levels by the year 2015. But 
disputes over some details of that protocol have dominated a large 
part of the discussions here. Japanese ambassador for economic and 
environmental affairs, Takayuki Kimura, told reporters Monday that 
he is disappointed by the slow progress so far here in Buenos Aires. 
We are looking for to have a few days more of intensive discussion, 
and we are willing to do the utmost in making sure that we can have 
the kind of achievement which will lead to the entry into force of 
the protocol. Ambassador Kimura said he would like to maintain the 
momentum established at Kyoto and that at a minimum, this meeting 
should produce a schedule for implementation of the various items 
included in the protocol. Even some environmentalist group representatives 
have scaled back their expectations for this meeting. Some say they 
would be pleased if delegates could at least achieve some working 
plans to go forward. The political realities are such that many participants 
in this meeting seem resigned to dealing with thornier questions at 
the next conference, which will likely be held in Morocco next year.
