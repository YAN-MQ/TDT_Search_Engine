Bristol-Myers Squibb Co., long known for its well-mannered culture, 
may soon see a battle royal for its top office. In a move intended 
to give several top managers more responsibilities, Bristol-Myers 
announced a series of high-level executive appointments Tuesday that 
immediately raised questions on Wall Street. There is no clear line 
of succession at Bristol-Myers, though Charles Heimbold Jr., chairman 
and chief executive, plans to retire in 2001, and Kenneth Weg, the 
company's executive vice president, plans to leave a year earlier. 
Tuesday's announcement not only failed to answer the succession question, 
but also appeared to create a race among several Bristol-Myers executives. 
``It does look like there is no heir apparent,'' said David Saks, 
a managing director at Gruntal &AMP; Co. ``What Heimbold is doing 
is raising a lot of people's titles, giving them more responsibility 
and then letting the field sort itself out for the chief executive's 
job.'' As in the Kentucky Derby, this race is a crowded field. The 
new responsibilities are effective Dec. 1. Donald Hayden Jr., who 
was president of the intercontinental, worldwide pharmaceuticals group, 
was named president of the company's worldwide medicines group. Richard 
Lane, president of U.S. medicines, will assume new responsibilities 
for worldwide franchise management and for the consumer medicines 
businesses in this country and Japan. Christine Poon, one of the highest-ranking 
women in the pharmaceuticals industry, who was president of the medical 
devices group, will become president of international medicines, reporting 
to Hayden. John McGoldrick, the company's general counsel, was also 
named president of the medical devices group. And Michael Mee, chief 
financial officer, will assume additional responsibilities for global 
business services. Analysts were quick to peg Hayden, McGoldrick and 
Mee as front-runners, with disclaimers attached to each. At 42, Hayden 
is young to run such a large company, but his pharmaceutical position 
may be preferred by the board. Analysts say McGoldrick has a bad assignment 
because Wall Street has frequently prodded the company to sell the 
medical devices group. Adding to the odds against McGoldrick and Mee, 
analysts say, are their reputations for being confrontational, unusual 
for Bristol-Myers' genteel ranks. While Wall Street will keep a close 
watch, Heimbold is not amused by the mention of an executive race 
for his job. He contended that he was merely giving his executives 
an opportunity to gain more experience. ``These executive changes 
are one way for us to increase our growth rate and shareholder value,'' 
Heimbold said. ``We do focus on competitive superiority. But our goal 
is to beat our competition.'' The naming of Heimbold's successor may 
become more exciting than expected. Analysts noted that Bristol-Myers 
has no mandatory retirement age for its chairman, which would allow 
Heimbold to remain in the post longer than expected. Heimbold said 
Tuesday that he would not leave the company until a successor was 
in place. ``A race of this kind is good for the company and good for 
the shareholders,'' Saks said. ``At least we know everyone who is 
involved will be working a little harder.''
