The Vancouver Canucks said Tuesday they had lost dlrs 21.6 million 
last year and blamed it on the weak Canadian dollar and high taxes.' 
The loss has forced the team to seek additional funding from John 
McCaw, owner of Orca Bay Sports and Entertainment, which owns 86 per 
cent of Northwest Sports Enterprises Ltd. ``Most of our revenues are 
earned in Canadian dollars, while players' salaries, which continue 
to increase, are denominated in U.S. dollars,'' said Stephen Bellringer, 
the Canucks president and CEO. The dlrs 21.6 million loss is in U.S. 
money. The Canucks, who have a payroll of around dlrs 27 million, 
have a 6-5-1 record this season but have played before small crowds 
at home. Only 13,906, the smallest crowd ever at the 18,422-seat GM 
Place, watched Vancouver lose 4-3 to Los Angeles on Monday night.
