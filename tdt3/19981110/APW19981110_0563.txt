Members of a conservative political group returned to Germany on Tuesday 
after their trip to Tel Aviv was aborted. Israeli officials had said 
they would deny entry to the group's leader, a right-wing extremist 
once convicted for inciting racial hatred. Joachim Siegerist, head 
of the Hamburg-based German Conservatives, was not on board Monday's 
Frankfurt-Tel Aviv flight, information Israel's Foreign Ministry said 
it learned only after notifying Lufthansa that it suspected he was. 
The German airline made an unscheduled landing Monday night in Istanbul, 
Turkey, and ordered the group off the plane. The other passengers 
continued to Tel Aviv. Siegerist is booked on a flight for Tel Aviv 
on Sunday, and said he intends to make the trip. In a statement, he 
said his group wants to foster friendship between Germans and Jews 
and denied accusations of anti-Semitism. Israel's Foreign Ministry 
said it would recommend that the Interior Ministry refuse his entry. 
``He's a person who participated in extreme racist activities. Not 
only that, but his activities are known to all, in Germany and in 
Israel and in other countries as well,'' Aviv Shiron, an Foreign Ministry 
spokesman said Tuesday. The 33 passengers who returned to Germany 
were traveling as part of a church-organized tour of Israeli holy 
sites, the German Conservatives' statement said. Among them was the 
group's honorary president, Heinrich Lummer. ``I cannot understand 
why the Israeli authorities did this. I find it unbelievable and unacceptable,'' 
Lummer told Associated Press Television Network on Tuesday in Turkey 
before returning to Germany. ``I expect our government to find out 
why this happened, and ultimately we expect an apology.'' Germany's 
Foreign Ministry declined to comment, saying they didn't have details 
of the incident. Siegerist, 51, was sentenced to 18 months in prison 
in 1995 for incitement to racial hatred because of a mass mailing 
describing gypsies as a ``criminal bunch.'' His sentence was lightened 
to probation on appeal last year.
