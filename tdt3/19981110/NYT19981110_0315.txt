I've been meaning to lobby this newspaper for a series on secret vices. 
Critics, staunch in their advocacy of the pure and upstanding, would 
confess what they listen to, read or look at when no one is paying 
attention. It would be like Sottha Khunn eating Mars bars after a 
night cooking at Le Cirque 2000, or Oscar de la Renta sitting at home 
in his underwear. The profound and the worthy can be tiring, and there 
is nothing like a little smallness to ease our passage from one Bach 
B minor Mass to the next Elliott Carter Double Concerto. Weakness 
of this sort applies also to the performances we like: ones that we 
know are ``wrong'' but that are irresistible nonetheless. Stokowski's 
Bach, jacked up for 100 musicians, makes the musicologist's hair curl 
but makes mine stand on end. ``Dialogues and Discoveries: James Levine: 
His Life and His Music,'' by Robert C. Marsh, new from Scribner, tells 
of a young Levine shyly confronting that most scrupulous of musicians, 
George Szell, with the sin of conducting in 4/4 a Mozart andante that 
is explicitly two to the bar. ``It is something Viennese that is very 
hard to explain,'' Szell answers almost apologetically. Bruno Walter, 
when asked why he ignored an apparently obligatory repeat in the Brahms 
Third Symphony, confessed simultaneously to his incorrectness and 
his compulsion to keep going at the double bar. Subsequent information 
alters our memory of first impressions, but elements never leave us. 
How can anyone who grew up on Rimsky-Korsakov's lapidary version of 
``Boris Godunov'' abandon it, even knowing how much the integrity 
of Mussorgsky's original has been compromised? The two versions are 
like separate works, each to be cherished. A colleague and opera expert 
I know falls prostrate before the Saint-Saens Trumpet Septet. No one 
plays the Scriabin Piano Concerto these days, if anyone ever did, 
but its softly wandering slow movement still haunts me. Why, indeed, 
do the small and the wayward hypnotize us when the Beethoven ``Hammerklavier'' 
Sonata and the Mahler Third Symphony stand nearby? Explain, in particular, 
the attractions of Federico Mompou, a determinedly minor composer 
of piano music and the occasional song, who in the wash of 20th-century 
history is a tiny ripple at low tide. Mompou, who lived from 1893 
to 1987, divided his long life between Paris and his native Barcelona, 
Spain. He shared friendships with Ravel and all the major French composers, 
but his name is rarely mentioned by their biographers. Stephen Hough, 
an English pianist with an inquiring mind, has evidently caught the 
Mompou virus, too, and has recorded 32 of his little pieces for Hyperion. 
Hough, an escapee from the competition wars, has never burst into 
flame, but his deep curiosity and affection for the out-of-the-way 
gives significant new credibility to historical footnotes like Hummel 
and Scharwenka. He also, in his program notes, has a way with words: 
``In the light of Artur Schnabel's quaint yet charming generalization, 
`Mozart is a garden; Schubert is a forest _ in sunlight and shadow; 
Beethoven is a mountain range,' perhaps Mompou is a window box.'' 
``Songs and Dances,'' ``Magic Songs,'' ``Preludes,'' ``Dialogues,'' 
``Charms'' and ``Landscapes'' inhabit this CD. Simple tunes and dances 
are often linked, and then there are mood pieces like ``The Lake,'' 
with its motionless broken chords and softly tolling treble notes. 
Mompou's piano music is usually as easy to play as it is to understand, 
and for the amateur player beaten down by an evening of Mahlerian 
grandeur at Carnegie Hall, I recommend it as a late-night restorative. 
In one, isolated way, Mompou is like Kurt Weill, who wrote accessible 
songs made durable by their hidden complications. Mompou adds compromising 
notes to diatonic chords, creating states of ambiguity. The shape 
of the tune is unequivocal, but the indeterminate harmonies are like 
softly spoken, unanswered questions. For a listener whose formative 
years were the 1940s and 50s, the link between Mompou's extended chords 
and those of bebop is natural. The pull of youth is strong, and this 
may be why a heart that understands the rectitude of hard-edged 1920s 
Gershwin still gravitates toward the Gershwin of Nelson Riddle. Can 
we explain Mompou's charm? One clue is this: In almost all of these 
pieces there is a turning point, a modulation or melodic alteration, 
that directs the expected toward the better than expected. We know 
precisely when it will arrive, but it never fails to please. These 
points are like hinges on which the naive and the sophisticated are 
made to swing. Hough, in general, plays this music very well. He is 
especially good at resisting the virtuoso's tendency to think big 
in small spaces. Beginning the recital with the E major ``Song and 
Dance'' (``Cancion y Danza'' No. 7) makes a splendid advertisement 
for what is to come, but I deeply regret Hough's rubato hesitations 
in what is clearly straightforward melody. I remember Mompou on an 
ancient Angel LP giving the same note values their literal worth, 
and to magical effect. Does my memory play tricks? The record, anyway, 
is so worn from use as to be unintelligible. The inevitable sins of 
Hough's Mompou are those of omission. One hopes he will find enough 
extra material, and sufficient public interest in it, to do another 
Mompou recording, one that will include the ``Intimate Impressions'' 
and its irresistible ``Gitano'' at the end. Maybe he can find a singer 
for the equally magical three songs of ``Combat del Somni.'' Perhaps 
Mompou's work takes up too little space for such added ventures. But 
then, lack of size is its attraction.
