Ben Grieve easily won the American League Rookie of the Year award 
on Tuesday, highlighting a season in which his sweet left-handed swing 
made an immediate impact. The 22-year-old right fielder for the Oakland 
Athletics was the only candidate named on all 28 ballots. He received 
23 first-place votes and five seconds to finish with 130 points in 
balloting by the Baseball Writers' Association of America. ``It means 
a lot after a long season to get recognition like this,'' Grieve said. 
``But at the same time it doesn't change anything. It's just an award. 
I can't get too much of a big head next year.'' Tampa Bay pitcher 
Rolando Arrojo earned four first-place votes and 61 points. Chicago 
shortstop Mike Caruso was third with 34 points, followed by New York's 
Orlando ``El Duque'' Hernandez who finished with 25 points and the 
other first-place vote. Grieve, whose father Tom played in the major 
leagues and was the former general manager of the Texas Rangers, led 
AL rookies with 168 hits, 18 home runs, 94 runs, 41 doubles and 89 
RBIs. He led the club in on-base percentage, at-bats, hits, doubles, 
walks and was second in runs. He batted .288 and made only two errors. 
Grieve is the fifth A's player to win the award, joining Walt Weiss 
(1988), Mark McGwire (1987), Jose Canseco (1986) and Harry Byrd (1952). 
A September call-up by the A's in 1997, Grieve hit three doubles and 
drove in five runs in his major league debut against San Francisco. 
In 24 games that year, he batted .312 with three homers and 24 RBIs, 
making him the early favorite for this year's rookie award. Arrojo 
and Hernandez, both Cuban defectors, were the top rookie pitchers 
in the AL. Arrojo, who defected during the 1996 Olympics, went 14-12 
with a 3.56 ERA and made the All-Star team. Hernandez, who fled Cuba 
on a raft last December, went 12-4 with a 3.13 ERA after being called 
up June 3. Caruso led AL rookies with a .306 average, but made 35 
errors.
