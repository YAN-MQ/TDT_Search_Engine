And tomorrow, some people in the U.S. and Canada will also be concerned 
with a terrorist campaign. It is being waged against people who provide 
abortions. Since 1994, there's been at least one violent attack and 
sometimes more, on abortion providers right at this time of year. 
In northern New York state a sniper got Dr. Barnett slepian a few 
weeks ago. This year other doctors are being very careful. Here's 
ABC's Bill Redeker. I have a vest that I wear, I have a gun that I 
carry. At an abortion clinic in the south, and another in the northeast, 
doctors, nurses and administrators fear for their lives. Sometimes, 
I think when I Kiss my kids good-bye, it's the last time I'm going 
to see them and that's difficult. The murder of Dr. slepian near Buffalo, 
New York, has heightened anxiety that the sniper is about to strike 
again. Last year, there were two attacks just weeks apart. When you 
have snipers out there that haven't been caught, I do worry about 
my safety as well as patient safety. So he is taking extraordinary 
precautions. Eight surveillance cameras ring his clinic. Videotape 
machines record everything and everyone 24 hours a day. He pays for 
an armed guard to escort him to and from work, and check for bombs 
that could be hidden under his car, his guard has even told him to 
mix up his daily routine. What we do is make sure the physician hardens 
his target which means that he varies his routine, he gives an aggressor 
nothing to pattern with. On the day that funeral services were held 
for the doctor in New York, the FBI warned abortion clinics nationwide 
to be on alert. But doctors say it up to them to look out for their 
own safety and fight intimidation. Is abortion a cause worth dying 
for? Abortion is a cause worth dying for. Still with seven abortion 
providers killed in the last five years, the intimidation is having 
an effect, with fewer doctors now willing to provide the procedure.
