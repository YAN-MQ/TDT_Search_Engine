U.S. customs service authorities have seized a Colombian air force 
cargo plane after agents found 1,400 pounds of cocaine on it. The 
plane was on a routine visit to FT. Lauderdale, Florida, yesterday, 
to pick up military supplies. Drug-sniffing dogs were brought on board 
after agents noticed unusual rivets and fresh glue on metal cargo 
pallets. The cargo plane makes several trips to Florida each month. 
This is the first time drugs were found. The crew was questioned and 
released.
