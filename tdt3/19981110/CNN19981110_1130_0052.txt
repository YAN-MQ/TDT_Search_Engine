a major winter storm is battering the rockies the plains and the upper 
midwest. on the calendar, winter is still five weeks away. but try 
telling that to folks in colorado. up to two feet of snow fell in 
the rockies, knocking out power to 10,000 people. icy roads and blowing 
snow are causing a nightmare in south dakota. a large section of interstate 
0 is shut down today because of ice and low visibility. south dakota 
governor bill janklow says "you can't see a thing." farther south, 
the storm caused severe thunderstorms. in st. louis, missouri, more 
than 30,000 people are without power. utility officials say power 
lines were downed by high winds and falling trees. forecasters are 
predicting severe weather in detroit, chicago, cincinnati, nashville, 
memphis, birmingham and new orleans. let's go to jeff flock joining 
us from chicago with the latest on the conditions there. it looks 
awfully windy. that's right, catherine. they told to us expect serious 
within. a lot of water and rain earlier this day. but the front has 
come through and it's really getting windy. they say potentially, 
hurricane-force wind before this blow is done. right now in chicago 
and the chicago lan area, about 68,000 people without power. at o'hare 
airport, gusts up to 40 miles an hour. delays there. a lot of flights 
cancelled as well. a few schools closed as well in chicago. nasty 
weather headed this way. it won't be snow. the worst will be the wind. 
again, gusts perhaps as high as 70 or 75 miles an hour, they're saying 
out along the lake. that brings to mind, when you look out at that 
lake, this is lake michigan, if you remember perhaps 23 years ago 
to this day a boat carrying iron ore, an freighter called the edmond 
fitzgerald, it sank in similar conditions on this day 23 years ago. 
we'll continue to watch the conditions out here along the lake in 
chicago and let you know how bad it gets. buckle down, jeff. thanks. 
jeff flock reporting from chicago.
