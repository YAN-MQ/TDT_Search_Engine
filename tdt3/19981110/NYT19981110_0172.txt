In a gesture intended to advance the Northern Ireland peace effort, 
Prince Philip visited both parts of Ireland on Tuesday and said he 
hoped for an end to the ``rather artificial divisions'' separating 
the people of the Irish Republic and the British province of Ulster. 
The prince's visit is widely seen in the Irish Republic as a precursor 
to a visit within the next year by his wife, Queen Elizabeth II. Her 
visit would be the first to Ireland by a reigning British monarch 
since the country became independent in 1922. The queen's grandfather, 
King George V, visited Dublin in 1911. A royal visit to the Irish 
Republic was unthinkable until the new peace effort began five years 
ago. In 1979, the queen's cousin Lord Mountbatten was killed in an 
Irish Republican Army attack on his yacht off County Sligo, on the 
west coast. But Tuesday, as the prince was shaking hands and chatting 
with Irish President Mary McAleese and Prime Minister Bertie Ahern, 
two prisoners convicted of conspiring to attack British security forces 
were released early from a prison in the North as part of the peace 
agreement approved in the North and the Republic in the spring. President 
McAleese is to join Queen Elizabeth on Wednesday in a ceremony in 
Belgium honoring soldiers who died in World War I, in which more than 
200,000 Irishmen fought in the British army. At that meeting, the 
queen and the president are expected to discuss a royal visit to Dublin. 
The prince's visit included poignant ironies: his meeting with President 
McAleese was at the presidential mansion in Phoenix Park, the former 
residence of the island's British colonial rulers. He also attended 
a ceremony at Dublin Castle, the seat of British colonial power. And 
when he visited the prime minister at government buildings in central 
Dublin, Union Jacks flew in the brisk wind. The prince gave no interviews 
and did not mix with people to shake hands. Irish national radio reported 
that he said he hoped for the end of the ``rather artificial divisions'' 
separating north and south. In Belfast, Roman Catholic and Protestant 
leaders continued to disagree over the issue that has slowed the peace 
effort, the disarmament of the IRA. The Catholic guerrilla organization 
has observed a cease-fire for 16 months, but wants to hold on to its 
weapons and explosives.
