I'm Carol Castial, VOA News. President Clinton has met with senior 
military officials to discuss Iraq amid signals he might cancel or 
scale back the Asia trip he is to begin Saturday because of the inspection 
standoff with Saddam Hussein. Correspondent David Gullis reports from 
the White House. Officials here say the strategy session included 
discussion of both military and diplomatic options in dealing with 
Saddam Hussein, but the lineup of participants was heavy with Pentagon 
chiefs, and Clinton spokesman Joe Lockhart insisted that compliance 
with the weapons inspections is not something Saddam Hussein is in 
a position to bargain over. This is not a situation where we're looking 
for a negotiation. There's nothing to negotiate. Spokesman Lockhart 
said the president had begun a series of telephone consultations with 
world leaders on the Iraq crisis with calls to British Prime Minister 
Tony Blair and Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu. He also 
would not rule out canceling or scaling back the Asian trip Mr. Clinton 
begins late this week because of the situation, but he said the plan 
for now is to go ahead with the ten-day mission. David Gullis, VOA 
News, the White House.
