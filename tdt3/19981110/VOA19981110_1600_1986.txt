A spokesman for ethnic Albanian guerrillas fighting for the independent 
Serbia's Kosovo province says his group should be included in talks 
on ending the violence. He says the talks have no chance of success 
unless they include the Kosovo Liberation Army. Yugoslav authorities 
have at times met with moderate Kosovo Albanian leaders but rejected 
all contact with guerrilla representatives calling them terrorists.
