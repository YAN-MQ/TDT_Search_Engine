And Australia's cricket team has defeated Pakistan by six wickets 
to sweep a three mag series of one day internationals in La Jore. 
The Aussies reached a new world record by scoring 316 runs with the 
loss of four wickets. That's the highest total ever scored by a team 
in a one-day international. Pakistan batted first and scored 315 for 
eight with Century's Fraheshovs Ahmed and Yosef Yuhana. Ricky Ponting 
hit an unbeaten 124 for the Aussies and Gilchrist added 103 for the 
Tourists. Australia won the first match in Carachi by 96 runs, the 
second in Peshuwar by five wickets. And that is sports. I'm Dave Byrd.
