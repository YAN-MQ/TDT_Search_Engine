One of Mayor Rudolph Giuliani's proudest possessions, temporarily 
displayed on the mantel in his City Hall office, is the baseball bat 
given to him by Sammy Sosa after his parade on lower Broadway last 
month. The trophy bat was the one that Sosa used to hit his 66th, 
and last, home run of the season _ or at least that's what Giuliani 
said Sosa told him. And since then, that is what the baseball-idolizing 
mayor has been telling anyone else who would listen. But now the National 
Baseball Hall of Fame and Museum is disputing that claim, saying that 
it not only owns the actual bat that hit homer No. 66 but has had 
it on display for the last six weeks in its museum in Cooperstown, 
N.Y., far from City Hall. ``I can tell you that we have that bat here,'' 
said the Hall of Fame's communications director, John J. Ralph. He 
said that he had traveled with Sosa and collected the bat after Sosa 
signed, dated and numbered it as the one used for homers 64 through 
66. Ralph said he took two other Sosa bats for display. ``We're confident 
our bats are legitimate,'' he said. Sosa, a right fielder for the 
Chicago Cubs, had a record-setting year, along with Mark McGwire, 
breaking Roger Maris' single-season record of 61 home runs. McGwire, 
of the St. Louis Cardinals, set the new mark, at 70. Sosa was in Japan 
on Tuesday as part of a team of major leaguers touring the country, 
and could not be reached immediately to shed any light on the bats. 
Ralph called Sosa ``a super guy'' who would never intentionally deceive 
anyone. ``I can only speculate that he was misinterpreted,'' he said. 
The mayor seemed puzzled by the dispute as he showed off the bat _ 
a black Louisville Slugger with a silver-toned inscription _ when 
asked about it at a news conference Tuesday. ``Sammy presented it 
to me, and I thought he was giving me a bat, and I asked him is this 
actually the bat that you hit the home run with, and he told me yes,'' 
the Mayor said. ``It says `To Giuliani, Best Wishes, God Bless, No. 
21 Sammy Sosa, Home Run No. 66, 1998.'' The mayor plans to put the 
bat on public display, along with the Yankees' World Series trophy 
and some other memorabilia, in the Tweed courthouse behind City Hall 
starting on Tuesday. Eventually, he said, the city will send the bat 
_ whatever its provenance _ to the Hall of Fame. ``I realize that 
if this is the bat, it has tremendous value, and the best thing is 
for the public to be able to enjoy it,'' the mayor said. Musing about 
the bat's authenticity in a lighter vein, he said, ``Well, I haven't 
sold it yet, so I can't go to jail for fraud.''
