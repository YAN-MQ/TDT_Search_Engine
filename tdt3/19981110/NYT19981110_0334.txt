In a new sign of fracturing within the nation's largest Protestant 
denomination, Southern Baptists in Texas split Tuesday when a group 
of strict theological conservatives voted to break away from the state's 
established Southern Baptist organization, the Baptist General Convention 
of Texas. The vote marked the second time in two years that a state 
organization in the 16-million-member Southern Baptist Convention 
had ruptured, a result of a decades-old struggle between conservative 
and moderate Baptists over differences in how to interpret the Bible 
and what stands to take on certain social issues. The new organization, 
the Southern Baptists of Texas Convention, was created by several 
hundred conservatives at a Houston church Tuesday, said the Rev. Gerald 
Smith, the organization's treasurer. In September 1996, a conservative 
group pulled out of the Baptist General Association of Virginia, creating 
two bodies in that state. But the break in Texas is more significant. 
The state's established Baptist organization, the 2.7-million-member 
Baptist General Convention of Texas, is the largest state organization 
within the Southern Baptist Convention. The conservatives' decision 
does little for now, however, to weaken the older Texas Baptist organization. 
Those who created the new organization represented about 150 congregations, 
said people who were present, and adopted a $903,000 budget for 1999. 
In contrast, the General Convention claims 5,700 affiliated congregations 
and, at its own annual meeting in Houston Tuesday, adopted a $50-million 
budget.
