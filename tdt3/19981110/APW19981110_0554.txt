Russia insisted Tuesday that the main threat to peace in Kosovo comes 
from ethnic Albanian separatists, not the government of Yugoslav President 
Slobodan Milosevic. Ethnic Albanians accuse Milosevic's Serb-led police 
of resuming attacks in violation of a U.S.-brokered cease-fire intended 
to halt hostilities between Serbs and the ethnic Albanians. Albanians 
make up 90 percent of the population of Kosovo, a province in Serbia. 
Milosevic withdrew his troops after NATO threatened airstrikes on 
Yugoslavia if he continued attacks on Kosovo's Albanians. Russia opposed 
the strikes, and has long been sympathetic to Serbia, a fellow Slavic, 
Orthodox Christian nation. ``We believe that in the current situation 
the main threat to the process of a political settlement in Kosovo 
comes from Albanian extremists ... because they are trying to take 
advantage of the situation, furthering their own aims,'' Russian Foreign 
Ministry spokesman Vladimir Rakhmanin was quoted as saying by the 
ITAR-Tass news agency. Violence by both sides has increased in the 
past week, but ethnic Albanians accuse Serbs of being first to open 
fire.
