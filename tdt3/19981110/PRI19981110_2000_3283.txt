For our closer today, we cruise down the Antilles to Martinique to 
sample the islands two most popular types of music these days. THE 
WORLD's Marco Worman tells us about the styles and the fans. Be prepared 
to encounter a musical generation gap on this Caribbean island. It's 
not too different from the divide in the United States that lies between 
Gen X alternative music on the one hand and adult contemporary on 
the other. Martiniquens, who are over 30 and upwardly mobile, are 
more often than not devotees of a dance music called zuke. Mason Deza 
Jette, a deejay with Sun FM Radio in Far de France says zuke has mellowed 
since its first wave. In the '80s, concrete zuke was really popular. 
It was more rapid than what we're hearing today. Back then, concrete 
zuke worked really well on the dance floor. In the last ten years, 
the big thing is zuke love. Like concrete zuke, it's dance music but 
it's slower. With zuke love, dancers get more of a chance to get really 
close. And these days, zuke love has become so fashionable that hardly 
anyone dances anymore to concrete zuke. One of the leading practitioners 
of zuke love is the duet, Du Blajour, which borrows a riff or two 
from the jazz standard, "Autumn Leaves." The planetary web of rap 
and hip-hop has caught Martinique's younger listeners but in a more 
tropical incarnation. We have what we call ragamuffin, which is distilled 
from Jamaican reggae and American dance hall. Young musicians in Martinique 
have formed bands like the Caro Cara Sound System. But the biggest 
group at the moment is called The Rough Neg Mareaux. In terms of sales 
and radio air play, The Rough Neg are number one. Rough Neg Mareaux, 
Cat Sonzeaux, 400 years is filled with illusions to the history of 
slavery on Martinique and the rest of the Caribbean. For THE WORLD, 
is Marco Worman. Music from Martinique ends this edition of the program. 
Our series on Northern Ireland is produced by Rebecca Martin. In Boston, 
I'm Tony Kahn. Join us again tomorrow for another spin of THE WORLD.
