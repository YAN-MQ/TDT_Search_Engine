A two-day conference on Islam and human rights marks a start in efforts 
to promote greater understanding between Muslim and Western ideals, 
participants said Tuesday. ``There is no incompatibility between Islam 
and human rights,'' said Sahib ben Cheikh, an Algerian scholar and 
mufti _ interpreter of religious law _ of Marseille, France. ``The 
dream is to introduce Islam as a heritage of all humanity,'' ben Cheikh 
said at the close of the session on Islamic perspectives on the Universal 
Declaration of Human Rights. The meeting, which grouped 20 experts 
of Islamic law, was criticized by some human rights organizations 
because they had no chance to participate. U.N. High Commissioner 
for Human Rights, Mary Robinson, convened the meeting in a bid to 
break down cultural barriers. It was decided that only selected scholars 
should be allowed to speak in order to avoid polemics. U.N. officials 
say they hope to have follow up seminars with wider participation. 
``The fact that there has not been an exchange where non-Muslims could 
put questions to these experts is very regrettable,'' said ben Cheikh. 
Kamel al-Sharif, secretary general of the International Islamic Council 
for Daw'a (religious calling) and Relief, said he agreed with Mrs. 
Robinson that it was better to have a closed meeting of experts first. 
``This is the beginning of a process, not the end of it,'' said al-Sharif.
