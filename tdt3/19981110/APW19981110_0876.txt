Hand-to-hand combat in trenches piled with German cadavers _ but not 
French ones. Soldiers looting the rubble of cities reduced to ruin 
_ but only Germans. A valorous unarmed French soldier overpowering 
his knife-wielding enemy. Those images are among 110 artworks that 
go on display Wednesday for the first time since they were created 
by French World War I military artists. The works have been taken 
out of storage to commemorate Wednesday's 80th anniversary of the 
end of the Great War. The artists were sent to the front to paint 
what they wanted, but they produced some very sanitized results. ``The 
most horrific scenes were censored, not by the military, but by the 
artists themselves,'' said Frederick Lacaille, curator of ``Peindre 
La Grande Guerre'' (Painting the Great War) at the Army Museum in 
Paris. He said the purpose of sending the best-known artists of the 
day to the front lines _ most were too old to fight _ was to bring 
home glorified images of war to families of soldiers stuck in the 
trenches. ``The paintings always depicted dead Germans, never French,'' 
Lacaille said. The works also had another purpose: they toured the 
United States in 1916 as part of a French propaganda campaign to convince 
the Americans to join the war. The artworks were the only war images 
available in color _ photography at the time was mostly in black and 
white. The French tradition of glorifying military operations on canvas 
dates back to King Louis XIV, who decorated his royal residences with 
huge murals portraying French valor in battle. ``The paintings of 
the Great War are the last examples of this tradition,'' Lacaille 
said Tuesday. ``After World War I, photography and film took over 
and it was no longer possible to censor the horrors of war.'' Among 
the works on display are paintings by Charles-Jules Duvent showing 
the Reims cathedral aflame and the city of Arras reduced to rubble. 
A generation of French children grew up on the images. They include 
soldiers reading mail in a country church, a military funeral, women 
nursing the wounded and ashen-faced, bandaged soldiers peering out 
of the trenches at twilight. The works were widely published in newspapers, 
especially the popular L'Illustration, a Life Magazine-style weekly. 
Military officials would exhibit the originals, which range in size 
from small pastels to large oils, at army headquarters in Paris. Editors 
were then invited to pick whichever ones they wanted to reproduce. 
The show runs through March 7.
