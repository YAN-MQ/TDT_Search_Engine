In New Delhi, Indian and U.S. experts have finished 1-1/2 days of 
talks on export control programs, programs to limit nuclear proliferation. 
We have more from Douglas Bakshun in the Indian capital. A U.S. Embassy 
statement on the talks praised India for its commitment to nonproliferation 
as shown through its system of effective export controls and said 
controls are a critical element of nonproliferation policy. The statement 
did not give details, however, the United States has been concerned 
with the spread of nuclear technology in the wake of the nuclear tests 
by India and Pakistan in May. Brama Chilani, a strategic expert with 
the Center for Policy Research in New Delhi says U.S. priorities are 
clear. The U.S. concerns are that India should have a formal export 
control regime in place. In other words, that India should be adhering 
to to leak from within its borders. Mr. Chilani says India has a different 
concern. It has lnog been blocked from receiving sensitive U.S. technology 
that has civilian as well as military uses. Such technology is needed 
in the civilian space industry and civilian nuclear energy. Mr. Chilani 
says India would like barriers in these areas eased. The issue really 
is this, that India has been a target of U.S. inspired export controls 
over the last quarter century, and those export barriers against India 
have grown steadily over the last couple of decades at least most 
recently. The would like the U.S. to ease some of these technology 
controls and they are insisting on lowering of the technology barriers. 
The talks came just after President Clinton decided to waive some 
sanctions imposed on India and Pakistan because of their nuclear tests. 
Washington is pressuring both nations to sign the Comprehensive Test 
Ban Treaty. The U.S. technical team next holds talks in Pakistan.
