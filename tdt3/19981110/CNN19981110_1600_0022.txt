The state department is calling Iraq's latest defiance of U.N. weapons 
inspections "A grave situation." Spokesman James Rubin says if Iraqi 
President Saddam Hussein doesn't resume cooperation with UNSCOM, he 
may be able to reconstitute his weapons of mass destruction within 
a matter of months, not years. That is, unless the U.S. responds. 
David Daniel has the latest. The U.S. military is getting into place 
in case an attack against iraq is ordered. The aircraft carrier "enterprise" 
is now speeding up its deployment to the persian gulf. It's due to 
arrive November 23rd, three days ahead of schedule. Defense secretary 
William Cohen says time is running out for Iraq to comply with United 
Nations arms inspections. It can't go on forever. Diplomacy always 
should have every opportunity to dance. But at some point, a dance 
has a beginning and an end. President Clinton met with senior military 
and national security advisers at the White House to discuss the Iraqi 
situation. Iraq has steadfastly refused to retreat from its position 
of stiffing the u.N. security council. So the president is looking 
at what our range of options are right now and discussing those with 
our allies. Iraq accuses the U.N. arms inspectors of spying for the 
United States and Israel. It wants sanctions lifted before resuming 
cooperation with U.N. officials. There is no hope for cooperation 
with any special commission unless there is concrete evidence that 
sanctions are going to be lifted. The United States, though, says 
negotiating with Saddam Hussein is out of the question as it continues 
to give indications it has no plans to back down from this latest 
standoff with Iraq. David Daniel, "CNN Headline News."
