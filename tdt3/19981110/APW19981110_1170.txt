MARRAKECH, Morocco (AP) _ U.N. Secretary General Kofi Annan met Tuesday 
with Morocco's King Hassan II and other leaders to discuss the bitter 
dispute over the fate of the Western Sahara. Annan is making a North 
African swing to discuss the dispute, which has been bogged down by 
disagreement over who would be eligible to vote in a referendum on 
the territory's future. The United Nations has been working since 
1991 to hold the referendum on the vast desert area along the Atlantic 
Ocean, which Morocco claims is part of its kingdom. Polisario Front 
rebels seek the territory's independence. The region was colonized 
by Spain until 1975. Annan, visiting Marrakech after a trip to the 
territory, met with Hassan alone for a half hour. Then the two presided 
over a larger meeting of their aides. No details were divulged from 
the closed-door meeting. Annan also met with Moroccan Prime Minister 
Abderrahmane Youssoufi, who expressed only his ``optimism'' on the 
future of the Western Sahara, as well as the foreign and interior 
ministers, and the heads of both chambers of parliament. On Monday, 
Annan told reporters that neighboring countries, like Mauritania, 
could contribute to resolving the nearly quarter-century-old dispute. 
``The voice of neighboring countries is necessary and useful,'' Annan 
said. ``I am going to ... encourage them to work with us.'' Annan 
visited Mauritania before going to the Western Sahara. He travels 
next to Tunisia and Algeria, which once actively backed the Polisario 
and is the site of refugee camps in the south. Last month, Annan suggested 
that the referendum _ originally scheduled for next month _ be held 
in December 1999. To date, 147,249 people have been declared eligible 
to take part in the referendum. But the eligibility of another 65,000 
is contested.
