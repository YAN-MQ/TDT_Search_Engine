MIAMI _ U.S. customs officials seized about 1,600 pounds of cocaine 
from a Colombian air force cargo plane that landed on Monday at Fort 
Lauderdale International Airport, prompting Colombia's air force chief 
to resign on Tuesday. Raymond Kelly, commissioner of the U.S. Customs 
Service, called the case ``disturbing'' and said investigators were 
trying to sort out who loaded the plane in Colombia and who had access 
to it before it arrived at 2:30 p.m. with a crew of six and five passengers. 
Kelly said that foreign military airplanes regularly flew into the 
United States with supplies and personnel for embassies and consulates, 
or for specific missions, and that his agency routinely asked permission 
for random searches. Monday was the first time that the searches had 
discovered drugs on a Colombian government plane, Kelly said. In Colombia, 
the air force chief, Gen. Manuel Sandoval, offered his resignation 
to President Andres Pastrana, who accepted it, said Otto Gutierrez, 
a presidential aide. At a news conference on Tuesday, Sandoval said 
that the plane, a C-130, had gone to Florida to pick up ``logistical'' 
material and that it had been searched by drug-sniffing dogs before 
it left a military air base in Bogota, the Reuters news agency reported. 
Sandoval, who said that as commander of the air force he had to take 
responsibility for the incident, denied any widespread involvement 
of the military in the drug trade. However, he acknowledged the possibility 
that ``a small number of people are committing crimes inside the air 
force.'' Monday's discovery comes just weeks after the first state 
visit by a Colombian president to the White House in more than 20 
years. Pastrana, 43, has pledged full commitment to trying to rid 
his country of cocaine and heroin production and has received $280 
million in new aid from the United States for anti-drug efforts and 
economic development. In August, he succeeded President Ernesto Samper, 
who Washington said had financed his election with $6 million from 
drug traffickers. The State Department spokesman, James Rubin, said 
on Tuesday that the Colombian government was fully cooperating with 
the investigation and that ``this incident need have no effect whatsoever 
on our views of President Pastrana's determination to work with us 
to fight the export of drugs from Colombia.'' Customs officials said 
inspectors found the cocaine after noticing that several pallets of 
cargo on the plane had unusual rivets and smelled of fresh glue. A 
drug-sniffing dog confirmed the inspectors' suspicions. After drilling 
the pallets and extracting white powder that tested positive for cocaine, 
the inspectors dismantled the pallets and found 1,639 pounds of the 
drug, the officials said. Customs Service officials questioned the 
crew and the passengers, a family of five they said included an unidentified 
retired Colombian air force officer, but no arrests have been made 
while the investigation continues. Kelly, the customs chief, said 
it was possible that the cocaine had been placed on the plane without 
the involvement of anyone in the military. But he said the case was 
still troubling, adding: ``It's disturbing a military aircraft was 
used. We're talking something close to a ton of cocaine on an official 
aircraft.''
