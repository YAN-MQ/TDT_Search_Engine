Meanwhile, the Indonesian military says three of its soldiers have 
been killed during a clash in the troubled territory of East Timor. 
Military officials say one civilian was also killed when a mob attacked 
a military outpost on Monday. Last week officials accused East Timorees 
activists or murdering two soldiers, a police, and a government employee. 
The violence comes as East Timor prepares to mark the seventh anniversary 
of the Deley massacre when Indonesian troops fired at a funeral procession.
