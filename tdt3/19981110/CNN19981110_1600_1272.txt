Matt Yallof, "CNN Headline Sports." It's grieve in a landslide. Oakland 
outfielder Ben grieve was the overwhelming choice for A.L. Rookie 
of the year. The sweet-swinging lefty received 23 of 28 first place 
votes. And based on how he stacked up with other rookies in the junior 
circuit, he certainly deserved the honor. Now, defensively, grieve 
made just two errors all season. Devil Rays pitcher rolando arrojo 
finished a distant second, followed by chicago's Mike Caruso and the 
Yankees' Orlando Hernandez. Speaking of the Yankees, look for the 
world champs to officially join in the Randy Johnson sweepstakes. 
Johnson's agent told the "New York daily news" he expects George steinbrenner 
to make a contract offer to the astros lefty sometime today.
