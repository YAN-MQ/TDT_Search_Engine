Chicago Cubs baseball pitcher Carrie Wood is that National League's 
Rookie of the Year. The right-hander tied a Major League record with 
20 strike outs in just his fifth start this past season. Wood edged 
Colorado Rockies first baseman Todd Helton in the annual balloting 
of Baseball Writers Association of America. Wood says it's a great 
honor. Well, it's the guys that have won this award in the past. It's, 
you know, I'm glad to be a part of that group. It's a great honor, 
you know, the guys that have won this award in the past and they're 
great players and they had great carriers. And, you know, hopefully 
I can continue my career and have a good one. Carrie Wood finished 
the year with a 13 and 6 record before a sprained right elbow ended 
his season August 31st. But Wood helped the Cubs reach the post season 
playoffs for the first time in nine years. The American League will 
name its Rookie of the Year Award within the next hour or so.
