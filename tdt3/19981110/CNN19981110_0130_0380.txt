The American heart association is issuing new guidelines for monitoring 
children and teens taking ritalin and other psychotropic drugs. It 
says the drugs may cause increased heart problems. And there have 
been some reports of sudden death. Ritalin is commonly used to treat 
attention deficit disorder. The new guidelines call for a medical 
history before prescription, an electrocardiogram and a complete physical. 
Doctors should know about any medications the patient might be taking 
which could react with ritalin.
