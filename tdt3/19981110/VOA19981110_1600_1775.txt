The news is next on most of these frequencies as VOA News Now continues. 
It's 2130 universal time and this is VOA News Now. The United States 
is speeding up the deployment of American warships as it consults 
with other nations on action against Baghdad. A senior Palestinian 
official says the Palestinian authority might stop implementing the 
new peace accord with Israel if the Israeli government further delays 
its approval. And on Dateline, personal privacy in the age of the 
Internet. All that and more on our next half hour of VOA News Now. 
First, a summary of world news.
