All right, thanks a lot, Barbara. Pittsburgh Steelers quarterback 
Cordelle Stewart benched last week for ineffective play, returned 
to the lineup Monday to pass and run his team pass the visiting Green 
Pay Backers 27 to 20. Now slashed Stewart completed 15 of 22 passes 
for 231 yards. He ran for 14 more, while the Pittsburgh defense stifled 
Green Bay quarterback Brett Favre for three quarters. Favre finished 
22 of 39 for 234 yards and one interception. However, he was held 
to 71 passing yards in the first half, while Pittsburgh offense led 
by Jerome Bettis ran roughshod over the Packer defenders. Pittsburgh 
coach Bill Cower says that his team did what it needed to win the 
game. It may have been as good a first half that we've played since 
I've been here. We certainly made it interesting in the second, but, 
hey, you know, that's a good football team we played, and we hung 
on. But, you know, I thought we did some good things tonight. Packers 
coach Mike Holmgren meanwhile says his team never recovered from getting 
behind early in the game. We were very disappointed. We had not played 
well on Monday night this season. Prior to this time, we had. And 
really against a good team like Pittsburgh and you play a first half 
like we played, and it's almost over. Green Bay did make a run in 
the fourth quarter after defensive end Keith McKenzie returned to 
Pittsburgh fumble 88 yard to close the gap 27-17. After scoring on 
a 37-year field goal late in the game, the Packers never got the ball 
back.
