European Union foreign ministers have held their highest level talks 
so far on membership for six new countries: Cypress, the Czech Republic, 
Estonia, Hungary, Poland, and Slovinia. But the division of Cypress 
is threatening to derail the entire process. Turkey and the Turkish 
Cypriates object to the inclusion of Cypress in the negotiations without 
a resolution to the Cypress division. However, Greece says it would 
block the admission of any new members if the addition of Cypress 
is held up. George Popendrayu is the Greek Deputy Foreign Minister. 
If in the end this is put as a presupposition, I can be sure that 
no great parliament will ratify other exceptions of other countries 
if this unjust principle is kept for Cypress. Earlier this week, four 
powerful members - Germany, France, Italy, and the Netherlands - questioned 
letting Cypress into the union before its division is resolved.
