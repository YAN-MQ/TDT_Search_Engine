Iraq's foreign minister said the American and British threat of a 
military strike was reckless and called for a political solution to 
the dispute over U.N. weapons inspections. The minister, Mohammed 
Saeed al-Sahhaf, said in an interview late Monday with Al-Jazeera 
Television that military action would destabilize the region. He called 
on the U.N. Security Council to respond to Iraq's demand that a planned 
review of Iraq's compliance with U.N. resolutions lead to the lifting 
of punishing sanctions, imposed eight years ago after Iraq invaded 
Kuwait. Al-Sahhaf said the Security Council should be ``given a genuine 
opportunity _ free from all Anglo-Saxon pressures _ to conduct a comprehensive 
review of the situation that is acceptable to all parties.'' This, 
al-Sahhaf said, should ``lead us to start the process of lifting the 
embargo on Iraq.'' ``As for those screaming and threatening the use 
of force, this is nothing but a reckless act in the region,'' al-Sahhaf 
told the Qatari television station. In using the phrase ``Anglo-Saxon 
pressures,'' al-Sahhaf referred to threats by the United States and 
Britain to use military action after Iraq announced on Oct. 31 that 
it was halting cooperation with the U.N. Special Commission. The commission 
is responsible for overseeing the destruction of Iraq's chemical and 
biological weapons as well as long-range missiles. UNSCOM must certify 
that Iraq has eliminated its weapons of mass destruction before the 
Security Council will lift the sanctions, which limit Iraq's sale 
of oil, its economic mainstay. Iraq acted just one day after the Security 
Council agreed to review the country's compliance with U.N. resolutions. 
But it did not accede to Iraq's demand that this be linked to lifting 
the sanctions. Al-Sahhaf said ``intensive contacts'' were under way 
_ including with Prakash Shah, the special envoy of U.N. Secretary-General 
Kofi Annan _ to resolve the impasse. Ireland's former prime minister, 
Albert Reynolds, left Iraq on Monday after a three-day visit pledging 
to lobby Britain and the United States to avoid using force and seek 
a negotiated settlement. ``There is no solution but the diplomatic-political 
solution,'' Al-Sahhaf insisted. British Defense Secretary George Robertson 
warned during a visit to Kuwait on Monday that the patience of the 
international community was ``drifting away'' and that ``the option 
of force is there, is real.'' U.S. President Bill Clinton met Sunday 
with his top security advisers but put off a decision on whether to 
use force against Iraq. Meanwhile, the state-run daily Al-Qadissiya 
reported Tuesday that Iraq's vice president, Taha Yassin Ramadan, 
told a visiting journalist that Iraq's Oct. 31 decision is ``a logical, 
just and legal right'' of the country and that Iraq would not reverse 
it. He accused the United States of ``hollow threats'' and said military 
action would only strengthen Iraq's determination to end the embargo. 
Also Tuesday five teams from the Vienna-headquartered International 
Atomic Energy Agency went into the field, the largest number so far 
this month, U.N. spokeswoman Caroline Cross said. Iraq's decision 
on Oct. 31 to suspend cooperation with U.N. weapons monitors exempted 
the IAEA, which is close to declaring Iraq free of nuclear weapons. 
UNSCOM technicians have been allowed into the field from time to time 
to check cameras and sensors, but they are banned from on-site inspections. 
UNSCOM has begun reducing staff in Baghdad because the inspectors 
cannot work. Twenty inspectors already have left and another 10 are 
to depart later this week, leaving about 100 at the U.N. headquarters 
on the outskirts of Baghdad.
