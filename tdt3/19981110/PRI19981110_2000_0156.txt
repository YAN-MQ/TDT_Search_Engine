Now that Newt Gingrich has endorsed House Appropriations Chairman 
Bob Livingston to succeed him as speaker, Republicans are focusing 
on some other leadership races. The contest to replace Majority Leader 
Dick Armey continues to simmer. NPR's Peter Kenyan has more. It takes 
112 votes to win, and Armey's office says the Texas Republican has 
over a hundred votes nailed down to hang on to the number two spot 
in the leadership. But this is a secret ballot, and Republicans say 
that means the votes can change, especially in a three-way race. Oklahoman 
conservative Steve Largent has a team working the phones as does Jennifer 
Dunn of Washington, who's seen as slightly more moderate. In a boost 
for Armey, California Republican Buck McKeon today decided not to 
get into the race, throwing his support to Armey. GOP conference chairman 
John Baynor faces a challenge from J.C. Watts of Oklahoma. In addition, 
since Dunn was the conference vice chairwoman, that seat is open. 
Representatives Fowler of Florida, Northup of Kentucky, Myrick of 
North Carolina, and Hoekstra of Michigan are vying for that post.
