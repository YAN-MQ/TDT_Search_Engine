Zimbabwe's cricket team has defeated Sri Lanka by 24 runs in the Char 
Jot Champions Trophy in the United Arab Emirates. Neil Johnson and 
Andy Flowering hammered a team record 148 for the fourth cricket to 
lift Zimbabwe to 259 for seven and 50 overs. Johnson made 72 and Flowering 
95. That was after Sri Lanka had reduced Zimbabwe to 24 for 3 in the 
seventh over. Needing a comprehensive win to keep its hopes alive 
of making the final in the three-nation event, the Sri Lankans were 
bowled out for 235 and 48.5 overs. Zimbabwe will play India in Friday's 
final.
