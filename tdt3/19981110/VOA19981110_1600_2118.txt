President Clinton has defied China's wishes and has met with Tibet's 
exiled spiritual leader, the Dalai Lama, at the White House. Mr. Clinton 
and his wife, Hillary, gave the Dalai Lama what was described as a 
warm welcome. In a written statement, the Dalai Lama said he is encouraged 
by Chinese President Jiang Zemin's apparent willingness to open a 
dialogue on Tibet.
