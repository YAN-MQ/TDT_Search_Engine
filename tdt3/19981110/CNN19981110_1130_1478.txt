the beatles' white album is making a comeback of sorts. capitol records 
plans to celebrate the 30th anniversary of its release with a limited 
edition cd version. the 1968 double album included a collage of photos 
and artwork, as well as lyrics to songs, and four glossy photos of 
the beatles. the cd version will re-create that in a more scaled-down 
version.
