President Clinton met today with his senior advisers to discuss a 
possible military attack on Iraq. At the same time, Defense Secretary 
William Cohen ordered the carrier, USS Enterprise, and other ships 
to speed their arrival in the Persian Gulf in case the U.S. chooses 
a military option. Cohen told reporters that the U.S. will consider 
attacks that could cause a significant degradation of Iraq's ability 
to make war. State Department James Rubin said there are no plans 
for negotiations with Saddam Hussein. The administration has said 
in the past that Saddam knows what he needs to do to avoid military 
action, and that is to resume cooperation with United Nations weapons 
inspectors.
