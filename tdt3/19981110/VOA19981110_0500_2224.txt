Here in the U.S., Republican Louisiana Congressman Bob Livingston 
is poised to become the next speaker of the U.S. House of Representatives, 
as his only rival dropped out of the race. Congressman Chris Cox of 
California withdrew his candidacy yesterday, Monday, citing the need 
for party unity. The race for the speaker's job got underway late 
last week when Newt Gingrich announced his resignation from the post 
following Republicans losses in the November 3rd election.
