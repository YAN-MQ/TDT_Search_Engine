These threats against doctors have forced many to go to extreme lengths 
to protect themselves. It is a frightening problem that crosses international 
borders. NBC's Mike Boettcher continues our "in depth" reporting from 
Canada. In Phoenix, Dr. Brian finkel, who performs abortions, reaches 
for protection. why? Two of his colleagues were shot in New York. 
I usually carry at least a Colt .45 with me. Half a continent away, 
in Calgary, Canada, empty beds in an abortion clinic. The facility's 
two doctors are out of town -- coincidence and good timing. Since 
1994, police say Canadian doctors have been shot by an unknown sniper 
during this period of November. Across north America, abortion clinics 
are on alert following the unsolved sniper attacks on abortion providers. 
Celia posniak, the director of the Kensington clinic in Calgary, is 
careful these days, asking that her face be blacked out for this interview. 
It's just the uncertainty. We're very on-guard now. Abortion providers 
will be most cautious tomorrow, November 11th, canadian remembrance 
day. That's because this holiday to honor Canada's war dead is used 
by anti-abortion activists to commemorate aborted fetuses. Calgary 
abortion opponent Michael O'Malley, who's been arrested 14 times during 
nonviolent protests, says the wave of shootings and assassinations 
has been bad for him, too. It's hurting us tremendously -- curtailing 
our civil rights, preventing people from joining us. There is fear 
and paranoia on both sides of the border. Today in Phoenix, Dr. finkel's 
wife is briefed by police on how to protect their home. But Dr. finkel 
maintains he will not be intimidated. It doesn't frighten me to the 
point that I'd quit. But frightening enough to upset both sides of 
the abortion debate on both sides of the border. Mike Boettcher, NBC 
news, Calgary.
