A newly repaired helicopter crashed Tuesday, seriously injured the 
two army officers aboard, an army aviation control officer said. The 
helicopter crashed in Lopburi province, 115 kilometers (71 miles) 
north of Bangkok, about an hour after taking off for an engine test, 
said the officer, speaking on condition of anonymity. The helicopter 
was usually used for training, he told The Associated Press. The injured 
men were taken to a provincial hospital, where they were in critical 
condition, he said. A safety team from the Army Aviation Office in 
Lopburi went to the crash site to investigate the cause of the accident, 
he added.
