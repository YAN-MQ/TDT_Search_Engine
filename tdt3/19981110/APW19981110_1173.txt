Seven anti-British activists being interrogated about possible involvement 
in an Irish Republican Army dissident gang have been freed without 
charge, police said Tuesday night. An eighth person arrested Sunday 
following the annual conference by Republican Sinn Fein _ a fringe 
political party opposed to April's peace accord on Northern Ireland 
_ remained in custody under Ireland's recently strengthened anti-terror 
laws. Republican Sinn Fein, founded in 1986 by defectors from the 
mainstream Sinn Fein party, denies having any formal link to an outlawed 
group called the Continuity IRA, which has claimed responsibility 
for several car bombs in British-ruled Northern Ireland since 1996. 
It has refused to join the 15-month-old truce being observed by the 
IRA. Among those freed Tuesday was the son of the party's president, 
Ruairi O Bradaigh, who was Sinn Fein's leader until being dethroned 
by the party's current chief, Gerry Adams. O Bradaigh criticizes Adams' 
acceptance of the peace accord on the grounds that it doesn't achieve 
the abolition of Northern Ireland, a fundamental IRA objective.
