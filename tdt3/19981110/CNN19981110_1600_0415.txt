Truckin' down the highway may cost more next year. The new transportation 
spending Bill passed by Congress allows some states to charge tolls 
on their interstates. But states must first submit a proposal showing 
they can't afford to maintain highways, bridges, or tunnels through 
tax revenues alone. The interstate system is presently funded by federal 
and state gas taxes. The trucking industry says the addition of tolls 
amounts to double taxation.
