Palestinian leader Yasser Arafat on Tuesday accused Israel of willfully 
wasting time before implementing the land-for-security agreement with 
the Palestinians. A senior Palestinian negotiator said the Palestinians 
might stop fulfilling their commitments under the accord if Israel's 
Cabinet did not ratify the U.S.-brokered agreement in the next few 
days. A test of the Palestinians' intention could come Nov. 21 when 
the 110-member Palestinian Central Council is to take a step toward 
revoking provisions in the PLO charter calling for Israel's destruction. 
Arafat did not refer Tuesday to holding up implementation, but sharply 
criticized Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu who has four 
times in the past two weeks postponed or broken off Cabinet sessions 
to ratify the accord. ``We expect that Netanyahu will waste a lot 
of time and he's not going to implement the agreement honestly and 
quickly at all,'' Arafat said after meeting with Britain's Duke of 
Kent. Palestinian negotiator Hassan Asfour said that in response to 
the delays by Israel, the Palestinians are considering ``whether to 
put on hold its implementation of their commitments.'' ``Implementation 
cannot be unilateral. It must be mutual and reciprocal,'' Asfour told 
reporters. As part of the 12-week accord, Israel is to withdraw from 
13 percent of the West Bank, in exchange for tougher Palestinian measures 
against Islamic militants. U.S. officials have said the clock began 
ticking on Nov. 2, or 10 days after the Oct. 23 signing of the agreement 
at the White House. In a first step, the Palestinians submitted a 
detailed anti-terror plan. In a second stage on Nov. 6, the PLO Executive 
Committee reaffirmed a letter by Arafat to U.S. President Bill Clinton 
in which the Palestinian leader listed the clauses of the PLO charter 
that were no longer valid. In exchange, Israel was to withdraw from 
2 percent of the West Bank on Nov. 16, but Netanyahu adviser David 
Bar-Illan said this week that it was likely the pullback would be 
delayed. Netanyahu has said he cannot implement the agreement until 
it has been ratified by the Cabinet and Israel's parliament. Netanyahu 
has not decided whether to convene the ministers this week.
