Richard Mock has so much money scattered about his studio in the Red 
Hook section of Brooklyn that it looks as if an armored car exploded 
inside the cluttered space. Bags of the green stuff are tossed on 
the floor next to piles of magazines and videotapes. More is scattered 
in clumps atop tables. It dangles from three slender cables between 
the cages where his parakeets jump and chirp. And every last greenback 
is torn to bits. If Mock had the patience of the revolutionary Iranian 
students who overran the American Embassy in 1979 and pieced together 
reams of shredded top secret documents, he could fill his battered 
truck with a fortune and dump it at the bank. Instead, he has wrapped 
the mangled money around wires and fishhooks, decorated them with 
bug-eyed fish heads and turned them into amulets he calls ``money 
lures.'' His friends swear the lucre is lucky. Their testimonials 
are enough to get Mock to the bank after all. In January, he will 
hang the lures at the Red Hook branch of the Independence Savings 
Bank, where they will be on exhibit in its community gallery. The 
bank is new to the neighborhood, and Mock figured it could use a lift. 
If he's really lucky, maybe he'll make a few deposits himself. He 
has already sold four lures for $1,000 each. ``In the ritual of making 
them I attempted to attract money,'' said Mock, 54, who is an editorial 
cartoonist and a teacher. ``The absurdity of this thing is the money 
is worth as much this way as if it was not cut up. I think that's 
a statement, too, about looking at art and thinking how much it's 
worth than just having art and experiencing it for what it is.'' In 
case federal types get curious, Mock explained that he doesn't actually 
destroy the money (though an artist pal of his once sliced up some 
dollar bills and pasted them over a Statue of Liberty model). He buys 
it already shredded from a scientific supply house. He was using it 
in an art class that he teaches in Manhattan when he was impressed 
by the creative abandon his young students showed in making money 
trucks, money dogs and money people. Back in Brooklyn, he combined 
the deconstructed dough with some fishhooks. He gave one of his first 
lures to Pat Toomay, a friend and collector who soon came into a $20,000 
windfall. Unfortunately, Toomay had to return the cash, since it resulted 
from a mistake in a financial transaction. ``The money lure being 
a pagan instrument, it doesn't pay attention to morality,'' Toomay 
said. ``It works with what's at hand.'' The Red Hook bank could use 
a hand, not to mention a hook. Charles Hamm, Independence's chief 
executive, wouldn't mind if the money mojo spurred new business or, 
better yet, led to regulatory changes that now bar his thrift from 
receiving deposits from city agencies. ``Better lucky than smart,'' 
he said. ``We don't like giving money back. But we sure like getting 
it.'' Money isn't a big thing for Mock. But he knew that for some 
people, it is an object of affection that alienates them from what 
they really need in life. People follow the market as if they were 
monitoring their pulse, with the Dow as a measure of self-esteem. 
``The lures are an expression of this phenomenon of acquiring money 
as a cultural obsession,'' he said. ``When money becomes too big a 
focus of life, it takes over other areas that could have been emotionally 
rewarding. Money itself has no emotion connected to it. To value it 
as you would a life companion is absurd.'' His unkempt garret is proof 
of his beliefs. He moved to Red Hook in the late 1970s, after having 
lived on the Lower East Side and in SoHo. Those Manhattan neighborhoods 
were once home to struggling artists. Now they are home to people 
who are starving only for attention or boutiques with price tags like 
Lotto numbers. Red Hook, a waterfront neighborhood that was left alone 
after a highway severed it from the rest of Brooklyn, is affordable 
and boasts of bonds among artists and neighbors who share materials 
and encouragement. Away from the rest of the city, artists follow 
their muses without a muss. Straight to the bank, too. ``It's damn 
near an anarchist community, in a positive sense,'' Mock said. ``I 
used to hassle galleries to let me do something like this. How often 
do you get the opportunity to put something so meaningful together 
with an environment that's perfect?'' For the man putting the hook 
in Red Hook, that's the best lure.
