The U.N. special envoy to Angola warns of a return to civil war as 
the government and the former rebel group, Unita, continue to violate 
their peace accord. Ysa Dialos says the four-year-old peace process 
is in deadlock. The U.N. diplomat says compliance with the terms of 
the pact is the only way to bring lasting peace to Angola. He made 
his comments in South Africa after talks about Angola with Deputy 
Foreign Minister Aziz Pahad. Angolan officials now say 24 people were 
killed in an assault by bandits Sunday on a diamond mine in North 
Eastern Angola. In addition, 27 people are missing and feared kidnapped 
in the attack by armed assailants on a Canadian-owned mine in Lunda 
North Day Province. Earlier, reports had said only five people were 
killed. Some reports say the attackers may have been members of the 
Unita rebel movement, but there has been no independent confirmation 
of this.
