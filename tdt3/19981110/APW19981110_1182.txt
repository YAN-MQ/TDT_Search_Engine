Are you willing to give up your sex life for cigarettes? For years, 
scientists have been warning that smoking can contribute to impotence 
as well as fertility problems in men. Now anti-smoking forces have 
seized on that finding as a potentially powerful new way to get people 
to kick the habit. In California, a dlrs 21 million campaign launched 
in June includes a commercial showing a cigarette drooping limply. 
The message: ``Cigarettes. Still Think They're Sexy?'' In Thailand, 
the health ministry ordered the nation's tobacco monopoly to print 
a new warning on cigarette packs: ``Cigarette smoking causes sexual 
impotence.'' In England, public health activists are lobbying for 
a similar warning label. The impotence risk _ and strategy _ are attracting 
media attention, too. Last Sunday, CBS's television news show ``60 
Minutes'' devoted a segment to the subject. Activists are hoping the 
message will get through to people who weren't deterred by the generations 
of warnings about slow-developing threats such as cancer, emphysema 
and heart disease, which altogether kill 400,000 smokers in the United 
States annually. ``What a terrible problem for the man because he 
is so physically addicted,'' said Elizabeth Whelan, director of the 
American Council on Science and Health, which opposes tobacco companies. 
``It will be interesting to see if this motivates men _ especially 
young men _ to disassociate themselves from that image of impotence.'' 
Statistician Steven J. Milloy, who regularly contradicts what he regards 
as ``junk science'' and frequently sides with the tobacco industry, 
said anti-smoking forces are distorting a 1994 study by the Centers 
for Disease Control and Prevention that concluded that smokers are 
twice as likely as nonsmokers to be impotent. Milloy adjusted the 
CDC data to consider blood vessel disease, hormone imbalances and 
other risk factors. As a result, he said, the link between smoking 
and impotence became statistically insignificant. The impotence-and-smoking 
message has been boosted, in part, by the runaway popularity of Viagra. 
Pfizer Inc. reported that three of four men who participated in its 
clinical trials for Viagra were smokers. And, Pfizer found, 21 percent 
of men with erectile dysfunction have underlying conditions such as 
high blood pressure, heart disease and diabetes _ all of which can 
be caused or complicated by smoking. Urologists say smoking can diminish 
erections by reducing blood flow in the penis, just as it can clog 
blood vessels to the heart. In studies published since 1989, between 
39 percent and 82 percent of the men suffering from vascular impotence 
were smokers. Smoking can reduce fertility in men, too. Chemical compounds 
in cigarette smoke can change levels of hormones and enzymes that 
affect the number, shape and mobility of sperm _ all important factors 
in conception. Clive Bates, director of the London-based Action on 
Smoking and Health, said the warnings about smoking and impotence 
are shockingly effective because cigarettes are so often associated 
with the after-sex experience. ``The advantage of the penis from a 
communications point of view is that it is easy to imagine it shriveled 
up and shrunken,'' Barnes said, ``whereas damage to other vital organs 
such as the heart is much less obvious.''
