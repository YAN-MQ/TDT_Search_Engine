Germany's defense minister said Tuesday he fears fresh warfare in 
Kosovo unless international pressure is kept up on Yugoslav President 
Slobodan Milosevic and ethnic Albanian rebels to honor an Oct. 12 
peace deal for the province. Rudolf Scharping cited signs that the 
current truce was being used for ``preparations for new military actions'' 
after the winter. Speaking during a debate in parliament, he did not 
elaborate. ``There is only a very narrow window for a political solution,'' 
he said. He said it would be unacceptable for unarmed peace monitors 
or a military force being set up to intervene if the observers face 
danger because of a lack of diplomatic pressure on both sides in the 
conflict. The deal calls for up to 2,000 international observers to 
go to Kosovo to make sure Milosevic reduces security forces in Kosovo 
and stops attacks on civilians. Germany has contributed observers 
and is also offering soldiers for the rapid intervention force, to 
be based in neighboring Macedonia.
