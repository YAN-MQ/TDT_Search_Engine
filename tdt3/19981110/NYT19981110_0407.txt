The News Corp. on Tuesday completed the third-largest initial public 
offering in American history, raising about $2.8 billion with the 
sale of 124.8 million shares of Fox Entertainment Group Inc. The shares, 
representing an 18.6 percent stake in the new company, were priced 
at $22.50 each, midway in the range of anticipated prices. The News 
Corp. said earlier this year that it planned to sell about 18 percent 
of its entertainment businesses to the public. Those include the 20th 
Century Fox Film Corp., the Fox Network, and Fox's various cable-programming 
operations, including Fox News, the Fox Family Channel and a group 
of cable services called the Fox-Liberty Sports Network. By selling 
a portion of its assets to the public, the company hopes to highlight 
the value of those assets. That, in turn, can improve the price of 
the News Corp.'s own stock. The new entity represents businesses that 
in the most recent fiscal year, which ended June 30, generated $7 
billion in sales and $600 million in operating earnings. The Fox Entertainment 
offering ranked third behind the recent initial public offering of 
Conoco Inc., which raised $4.4 billion, and last year's offering of 
Lucent Technologies, which raised $3.3 billion. The News Corp. had 
planned to sell 85 million shares, but a person close to the deal 
said demand was so great that the company decided to expand the offering, 
raising more money and creating a more liquid market for the stock. 
The deal put an equity value of $15.1 billion on all of the new company. 
The person involved in the deal said the News Corp. expected to transfer 
$1.8 billion of its $9.3 billion in debt to the new company. The company 
is expected to use some of the proceeds to pay down debt. Merrill 
Lynch was the sole underwriter of the deal.
