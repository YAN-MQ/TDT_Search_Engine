Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu has won new assurances from the 
Palestinians about their antiterror campaign, and will convene his 
Cabinet Wednesday to resume debate on the Wye peace accord, the government 
announced. Cabinet ratification, which has been postponed four times 
in two weeks, would finally pave the way for the implementation of 
the land-for-security accord under which Israel would withdraw from 
13 percent of the West Bank over 12 weeks. An Israeli official said 
Tuesday that the 18 ministers would meet Wednesday morning. U.S. officials 
have urged Netanyahu to stick to the timetable that requires Israel 
to hand over 2 percent of the West Bank on Monday. Palestinian leader 
Yasser Arafat complained Tuesday that Netanyahu was willfully delaying 
implementation. ``We expect that Netanyahu will waste a lot of time 
and he's not going to implement the agreement honestly and quickly 
at all,'' Arafat said before Israel announced the reconvening of the 
Cabinet. Palestinian negotiator Hassan Asfour said the Palestinians 
might stop fulfilling their commitments under the accord if Israel's 
Cabinet did not ratify the U.S.-brokered agreement in the next few 
days. ``Implementation cannot be unilateral. It must be mutual and 
reciprocal,'' Asfour told reporters. In the past two weeks, Netanyahu 
postponed the Cabinet debate three times, saying he needed more clarifications 
from the Palestinians about their campaign against Islamic militants. 
Last Friday, the ministers had just begun their second day of meetings 
on the peace accord when two members of the Islamic Jihad group blew 
up their rigged car in a Jerusalem market, killing themselves and 
wounding 21 Israeli shoppers. In response, the Cabinet dispersed and 
Netanyahu said he would not reconvene the ministers until the Palestinian 
Authority outlined how it would prevent future attacks against Israelis. 
Netanyahu said in a statement Tuesday that he decided to reconvene 
the Cabinet after ``receiving reports that the Palestinian Authority 
decided to take practical steps against Palestinian terror groups 
and their infrastructure.''
