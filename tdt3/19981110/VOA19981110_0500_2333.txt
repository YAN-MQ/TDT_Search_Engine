Well, at 14 hours, 44 universal time, that's a look at the major news 
stories of this hour. We'll have an update in about 16 minutes at 
15 hours universal time. And there's more lined up for the rest of 
this hour, including a check on business and financial news with a 
stop by New York City's Wall Street for early stock trading activity. 
And later, the latest solo album from folk singer Susan Warner. I'm 
Russ Woodgates with Barbara Kline. Stay where you are, as VOA News 
Now continues.
