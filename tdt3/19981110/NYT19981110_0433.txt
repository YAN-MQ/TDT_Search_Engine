Florence L. Walsh, a fast-rising executive at Lucent Technologies 
Inc. who helped engineer that company's split from the AT&AMP;T Corp. 
in 1996, died on Saturday at Morristown Memorial Hospital in New Jersey. 
Ms. Walsh, who lived in Bernardsville, N.J., was 37. The cause was 
toxic shock syndrome resulting from an infection during pregnancy, 
a Lucent spokeswoman said. The infection also caused the death of 
Ms. Walsh's unborn son on Oct. 31. Ms. Walsh, who was known as Meg, 
was vice president and treasurer of Lucent, one of the world's biggest 
makers of advanced communications equipment. While reporting to the 
company's chief financial officer, Ms. Walsh managed Lucent's $35 
billion pension fund and the company's lending and borrowing. She 
demonstrated acumen in her relationship with financial markets. Earlier 
this year, she raised about $300 million for Lucent by issuing 30-year 
bonds that paid the lowest effective interest rate on such bonds issued 
by a company with Lucent's credit rating in almost 30 years, according 
to Securities Data, which tracks bond offerings. Ms. Walsh graduated 
from Johns Hopkins University in 1984 and from the Wharton School 
of the University of Pennsylvania in 1988. After leaving Wharton, 
Ms. Walsh joined the General Motors Corp. in New York City, rising 
to director for corporate finance and capital markets. She joined 
AT&AMP;T in 1994 as assistant treasurer. In that job, she helped establish 
the financial framework for Lucent's split from AT&AMP;T. She joined 
Lucent as treasurer a few months before the companies formally separated. 
Ms. Walsh is survived by her husband, Mark; a son, Carter; her parents, 
Mollie Bucy of Baltimore and David Long of Crownsville, Md.; a brother, 
David Long Jr. of St. Petersburg, Fla., and her maternal grandparents, 
Robert and Florence Roy of Ruxton, Md.
