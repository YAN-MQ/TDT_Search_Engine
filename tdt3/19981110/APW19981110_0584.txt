The family of Nigeria's late dictator, Gen. Sani Abacha, has handed 
back to the government more than dlrs 750 million in state funds illegally 
amassed by the former leader, a government spokesman said. The money 
_ including about dlrs 625 million, 75 million British pounds and 
dlrs 3 million worth of Nigeria naira _ has been deposited into a 
special account at the Central Bank of Nigeria, government spokesman 
Mohammed Haruna told reporters Monday. During his five-year military 
dictatorship, Abacha diverted hundreds of millions of dollars in government 
funds to his personal accounts. Since his death in June, Abacha's 
family has returned vast sums of money. Others in Abacha's government 
also siphoned money from the state to amass personal fortunes. Nigeria's 
former finance minister, Anthony Ani, said Abacha's national security 
adviser Ismail Gwarzo had channeled about dlrs 1.3 billion worth of 
foreign reserves into private accounts. Although accustomed to military 
rule and conflict, Nigeria suffered enormously under Abacha, whose 
leadership was marked by divisive policies, endemic and institutionalized 
corruption and brutal repression. Abacha was replaced by another military 
leader, Gen. Abdulsalami Abubakar, who has vowed to hand power over 
to an elected civilian government. Abubakar has been working to free 
political prisoners and redress the financial mismanagement that marked 
Abacha's tenure.
