If you want to take your pets with you the next time you fly, there 
are some airline rules you'll need to know. Kalin Thomas-Samuel has 
details in our "working ahead" report. Pets can travel on airlines, 
either as a carry-on, or in cargo, as checked luggage. One exception, 
no pets are allowed on southwest, except for assistance animals. Rules 
for pet travel vary, but there are a few basics. First, you'll need 
advance reservations. Most airlines allow one pet per plane in the 
passenger cabin but permit more animals in cargo. Pets must be 8 weeks 
old and fully weaned, with a clean Bill of health from the vet. And 
they must be carried in usda-approved hard or soft animal kennels. 
The cost is $50 to $100 per pet one way. Airlines didn't always let 
pets fly. Gayle martz, a former flight attendant, persuaded airlines 
to change pet travel rules. I knew the anxiety that people went through 
that wanted to take their pets with them. Martz also designed the 
"Sherpa bag," an alternative to hard kennels, approved for carry-on. 
The Sherpa bags all conform to underneath the seat dimensions on an 
airplane so the animal can have more room. They've got the mesh panels 
for ventilation. It's lightweight. And it gives them a private den 
that they can travel in where they're safe and secure. United and 
Delta airlines banned shipping animals in cargo this past summer due 
to extreme heat. American and northwest restrict pet travel in cargo 
when temperatures rise above 85 degrees or fall below 45 degrees. 
Tomorrow -- tips to make traveling easier on pets, and a place for 
them to stay once you arrive at your destination. Kalin Thomas-Samuel,
