First, hurricane Mitch in the Caribbean and now a nameless blizzard 
with hurricane force winds in the midwest. It's a part of America 
accustomed to ferocious weather, but this early november storm stunned 
everyone. It covers a wide area of the central states and it's disrupting 
life everywhere. We begin with NBC's Anne Thompson. Columbia, Missouri, 
this morning. The middle of America. Winds so fierce -- some as powerful 
as a hurricane -- tear apart a Subdivision. 20 homes destroyed. Another 
50 heavily damaged. 16 people injured, none seriously. Adam Smith 
returns to what's left of his home, shattered by wind gusts up to 
81 miles per hour. I ran over here crossing the corner and the roof 
decided to go, I guess. The stormy skies across the great plains brought 
all kinds of miserable weather. Snow caused accidents in Sioux city, 
Iowa, shut down parts of Minnesota and South Dakota. Driving virtually 
impossible. 600 miles of highways closed in those two states. This 
is turning into a very dangerous weather system. In minot, North Dakota, 
11 inches of snow. Agony for drivers, but good business for body shop 
owner Bruce nibocken. Any time there's a lot of ice and snow at one 
time, you get 40 wrecks all at once instead of just a few, and it 
becomes very hectic. And along the shores of lake superior, predictions 
of waves 18 feet to 20 feet high -- on the very day, 23 years ago, 
a similar storm sank the "edmund Fitzgerald," killing 29 sailors. 
For this storm? Two already dead. Power outages another big problem. 
Winds tearing down lines in Nebraska, Iowa and Illinois. Here in the 
Chicago area, 118,000 homes and businesses are without power. An umbrella 
-- no defense in the windy city against the storm now whipping up 
lake Michigan and burying central Minnesota in ten inches of snow. 
Don't be traveling. Good advice for those still in the storm's path, 
now hovering over Wisconsin and headed on a northeast track. Anne 
Thompson, NBC news, Chicago.
