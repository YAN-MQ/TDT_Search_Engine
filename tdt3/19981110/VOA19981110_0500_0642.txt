Greg Flakus, VOA News, Buenos Aires. And you're tuned to the Voice 
of America broadcasting from Washington. I'm Russell Woodgates with 
Barbara Kline, and we're bringing you this hour of VOA News Now. At 
1416 universal time, here's the major news story we're following on 
VOA News Now. China has renewed its criticism of Tibet's exiled spiritual 
leader the Dalai Lama. We'll have more on that and the rest of the 
hour's top news in our next summary coming up about 13 minutes from 
now. And business news turns your way in about 31 minutes or so, including 
our first report on today's stock market trading on Wall Street, which 
opens for business in about 13 minutes. Also, hear the next installment 
in our week-long examination of the problems of urban sprawl. Later, 
we hear about an Iowa farm girl who has now become one of the rising 
stars on the American country music scene. So stay with us for that 
and more as VOA News Now continues. Right now, it's time for a sports 
update. Dave Byrd joins us with that.
