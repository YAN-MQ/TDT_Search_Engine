The Kansas city chiefs are making a switch at quarterback. Coach Marty 
schottenheimer says rich gannon will start mondays game against unbeaten 
Denver in place of Elvis Grbac. In the last three games, Grbac has 
been erratic, throwing seven interceptions and losing a fumble. Elvis 
Grbac is the quarterback of the future of the Kansas city chiefs. 
I have no doubt about that. None whatsoever. Rich gannon is the quarterback 
for the Denver Bronco game.
