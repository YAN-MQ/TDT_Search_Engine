Third-seeded Goran Ivanisevic of Croatia fired eighteen aces to defeat 
Carsten Arriens of Germany in the second day of play in the dlrs 1.1 
million Kremlin Cup tennis tournament Tuesday. Defending champion 
Yevgeny Kafelnikov of Russia, seeded second, outlasted his countryman 
Andrei Cherkasov, a wild card, 6-3, 6-4. Kafelnikov holds the eighth 
position on the ATP rankings and still has a chance to win a berth 
for Hannover. It took the heavy-serving Ivanisevic, the 1996 Kremlin 
Cup champion, an hour and twenty minutes to struggle through against 
Arriens. Ivanisevic failed to break a single serve and won both sets 
on a tiebreaker 7-6 (7-5), 7-6 (7-3). Top-seeded Alex Corretja of 
Spain defeated John van Lottum of the Netherlands, 6-3, 7-6 (7-2). 
Corretja, who is No.6 on the ATP Tour, won four titles this year and 
has already qualified for the ATP Championship in Hannover, Germany, 
later this month. ``It's better to play on clay, but I have to improve 
my game on hard courts, and that's why I'm trying to work,'' Corretja 
said. ``I think the most important thing is just to win, no matter 
6-3 or 7-6.'' Marc Rosset of Switzerland, twice Kremlin Cup champion 
and seeded sixth, eliminated Jeff Tarango of the United States in 
straight sets 6-4, 6-4.
