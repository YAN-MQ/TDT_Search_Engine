On the eve of U.S. President Bill Clinton's arrival, Israeli troops 
opened fire on hundreds of Palestinian stone throwers Friday during 
a protest against Israel's refusal to release prisoners, witnesses 
said. Two were killed and 32 injured. The violence and Israel's tough 
positions concerning the peace agreement Clinton is coming to promote 
raised new concerns that the presidential visit will be plagued by

release of Palestinian prisoners and also affirmed it will not withdraw 
troops in the West Bank unless the top Palestinian decision-making 
body holds a vote to annul clauses of the PLO charter calling for 
Israel's destruction. Friday's violence erupted just outside the West 
Bank town of Qalqiliya. Palestinian witnesses said about 500 Palestinians 
threw stones at Israeli soldiers who fired tear gas, rubber-coated 
steel pellets and live ammunition to disperse the crowd. Two 18-year-old 
Palestinians, Mohammed Suleiman and Kamal Adwan, were killed by live 
bullets in the head, said Dr. Ramsey Abu Yaman at the U.N. clinic 
in Qalqiliya. Thirty protesters were hurt by rubber bullets, two by 
live rounds and 40 were treated for tear gas inhalation, hospital 
officials said. The Israeli army said a preliminary investigation 
indicated that soldiers did not use live rounds, but that the circumstances 
of the two deaths would be checked further. The Palestinian protesters,

faction, had gathered after Muslim noon prayers to press for the release 
of Palestinian prisoners _ a key point of contention between Israel 
and the Palestinian Authority. Israel has, 7th graf pvs
