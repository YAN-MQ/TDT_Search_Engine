Former Chilean leader, Augusto Pinochet, made his first public appearance 
Friday since his arrest nearly two months ago. He arrived in a London 
court to hear the charges against him. VOA correspondent Laurie Kassman 
reports from London. The former general says he refuses to recognize 
the jurisdiction of any court outside his own country. The 83-year-old 
former general arrived at the court in a four-car police convoy with 
a helicopter escort overhead. Inside, Mr. Pinochet told the judge 
he dismissed saying charges against him as lies and said he does not 
recognize the jurisdiction of any court outside Chile. The Spanish 
judge, who requested his extradition, has formally charged Mr. Pinochet 
with crimes against humanity during his 17-year rule in Chile. The 
court set the extradition hearing for January 18th and said Mr. Pinochet 
would be allowed to go outside his rented villa in the English countryside 
to exercise, but he cannot leave the grounds of the estate. Mr. Pinochet's 
lawyers have already started the legal battle to block extradition 
to Spain. Laurie Kassman, VOA News, London.
