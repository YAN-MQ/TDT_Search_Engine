To one set of lawmakers, the allegation against President Clinton 
detailed in the first article of impeachment was a model of coherence 
and sufficiently precise detail. To the other, it was an untenably 
vague word jumble. To one group, the allegation perfectly qualified 
as an impeachable offense under the high standard set by the Constitution. 
To the other, it fell absurdly short. As Republicans and Democrats 
on the House Judiciary Committee bickered furiously Friday, studying 
the same facts and phrases to draw opposite conclusions, they often 
seemed not merely to be worlds apart, but to be occupying alternate 
universes. If a cow had lumbered into the hearing room, members of 
one party might have called it a horse; members of the other, a pig. 
But on one somber point, there was consensus. Both Republicans and 
Democrats agreed, in grave voices and freighted words, that the decisions 
before them were as important as any they would ever make, and that 
history would sit in judgment of what they did. ``This vote says something 
about us,'' said Rep. Henry Hyde, R-Ill., the 74-year-old chairman 
of the committee. ``We vote for our honor, which is the only thing 
we get to take with us to the grave.'' The hearing Friday presented 
something of a paradox, colored as it was by both an acknowledgment 
of the momentousness of the occasion and by intense acrimony between 
Republicans and Democrats. While members of both political parties 
summoned the memories of famous leaders from George Washington and 
Daniel Webster to Winston Churchill and Dr. Martin Luther King Jr., 
they drew starkly different inspiration from these ghosts. While members 
of both political parties said they were listening not to opinion 
polls or party leaders but to their own hearts, every Republican heard 
one set of instructions; every Democrat, another. ``If this is a vote 
of conscience, and I believe it is, it is going to come down to a 
Republican conscience versus a Democratic conscience,'' observed Rep. 
Lindsey Graham, R-S.C. ``And I don't know how to characterize that. 
I don't know what that means.'' `` I would suggest that one is not 
better than the other,'' Graham said. ``I would suggest that there 
is a very unique nature about this case that we need to look at long 
after this case is over. And only time will tell who got it right.'' 
It was the four-hour debate over the first article of impeachment, 
charging President Clinton with lying under oath about his relationship 
with Monica Lewinsky, that triggered the most heated crossfire. Rep. 
Charles Schumer, D-N.Y., complained that he was being muzzled; Rep. 
Chris Cannon, R-Utah, shot back that Schumer tended to go on ``ad 
nauseum.'' The central disagreement was a somewhat technical one over 
whether the first article should spell out each statement by President 
Clinton that Republicans say they believe constituted perjury. Rep. 
Jerrold Nadler, D-N.Y., said the absence of such a list exposed the 
impeachment process ``for the farce it is.'' Rep. Bob Barr, R-Ga., 
called that line of complaint ``very clever, but very disingenuous.''
