Unlike Coke, shares of Amazon.com have soared beyond the most optimistic 
prodictions in our ongoing series of reports on the top ten business 
stories of the year. Peter vials looks at the company at the center 
of the Internet height. It is a gold rush, every bit as real as what 
happened in california in 1849. But this year's gold was in cyberspace 
and no one found more of it than jeffrey basos, founder of Amazon 
dot kochl. He sells books via the Internet but he's worth $4 billion 
because investors believe he's building the Wal-Mart of the web. Time 
is the most precious commodity in the 20th century. The fact you don't 
have to drive, park, do all those things that make things complicated 
is a huge advantage of online shopping. Despite a lack of profits 
Amazon loses money, investers have been true believers and drove the 
stock from $30 to above $200, driving the value of the company to 
$11 billion, more than Delta airlines, more than kmart and in the 
eyes of many analysts, more than any Internet retailer is truly worth. 
I think those companies are being played by the momentum players and 
people out there who want to be in them because they see them going 
up. Investors fell in love with other Internet stocks in 1998, ebay 
anda Hue. As the year wore on, the gold rush mentalityty seemed to 
feed on itself. The prospectors were young investor whose did their 
stock trading over the internet. Peter vials, "CNN Financial News", 
New York.
