The New York Times said in an editorial for Saturday, Dec. 12: The 
choice of a judge for the state's highest court is among the most 
important decisions a governor makes. This week Gov. George Pataki 
chose well, nominating Albert Rosenblatt, a widely respected New York 
state Appellate Division judge to a seat on the state's Court of Appeals. 
Pataki's harsh attacks on the court during his first term for decisions 
he viewed as too sympathetic to the rights of criminal defendants 
raised concern he would appoint blindly pro-prosecution judges. But 
in selecting Rosenblatt as his second appointment to the seven-member 
bench, Pataki opted for a moderate whose background includes stints 
as a Dutchess County prosecutor and as the state's chief administrative 
judge. Though more conservative than Justice Vito Titone, the fierce 
defender of civil liberties he is to replace, Rosenblatt has produced 
a string of well-written opinions that suggest a thoughtful approach 
not captive to any rigid ideology. Rosenblatt's imposition of the 
death penalty in 1983 under provisions of the state's old capital 
punishment statute no doubt helped him gain favor with Pataki, an 
ardent death penalty supporter. But the judge's regrettable ruling 
in that case does not necessarily foretell how he will vote 15 years 
later on issues concerning the state's new death penalty law or other 
criminal justice matters. While Titone's principled voice will be 
missed, the selection of Rosenblatt adds a fair and capable jurist 
to a court that decides the vast majority of its cases by unanimous 
decisions.
