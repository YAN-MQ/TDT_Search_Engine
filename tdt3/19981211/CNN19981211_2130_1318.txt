Well, the NFL playoffs haven't started, but don't tell that to the 
Bucs and the steelers. Both teams face a must-win Sunday when the 
square off in Tampa. Tampa bay has never beaten Pittsburgh in four 
meetings. We gotta stop "the bus." You know, everybody get outside, 
and put your stop sign up. We gotta stop "the bus." I need to read 
the defenses well, and at the same time, in order for that to happen, 
I just need to prepare myself well during the week and just go out 
ready to have some fun. Rob Ticktin, "CNN Headline Sports."
