And you know, Paul, we have another really remarkable development 
in the medical field coming to us today. The world's first hand transplant 
recipient says he has regained a sense of touch and can bend his new 
hand at the wrist. French doctors gave the 48-year-old Australian 
businessman Clint Hallum the right hand of a brain-dead man last September, 
replacing one Mr. Hallum lost in a saw accident 10 years ago. He told 
reporters at a hospital in Lyons, France, that sensation is starting 
to return to his fingertips. He said muscle strength is still restricted, 
but he believes he will eventually regain full use of that hand. The 
delicate 13-hour-long operation last September involved attaching 
the bone of the donated hand and the forearm to Mr. Hallum's severed 
limb. Let's not forget, of course, the veins, the nerves, the tendons, 
the muscles and the skin. Isn't that remarkable? That is remarkable. 
It really is; a wonderful, wonderful development in medical science. 
Universal time. This is VOA News Now.
