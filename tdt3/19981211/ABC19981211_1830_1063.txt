The California school system has made another very deliberate decision 
to emphasize the basics in education. California had already decided 
to emphasize phonics again, in reading. Now it's decided the new way 
of doing math isn't working. Here's ABC's Jane Clayson. This is called 
graph paper. In California, students are not learning basic math -- 
how to add, subtract, multiply and divide. The state board of education 
says calculators are the reason why. A lot of them just play with 
the buttons and get easy answers and, therefore, don't bother to even 
think about 36 divided by 6 equals whatever. They find it's just a 
crutch. The decision is a sharp reversal from seven years ago, when 
the board declared all students should use calculators for homework 
and tests. But most are not doing well in math class. Half math students 
score below the naonal average on standardized tes.D of e California 
math teachers admit kids are struggling, but they say it's because 
of language barriers and poverty issues, not calculators. We're hurting 
children in the state of California. We need to have our chdren use 
gy heir education. Not anymore, not until students prove they can 
calculate the basics on their own. Jane Clayson, ABC News, Los Angeles.
