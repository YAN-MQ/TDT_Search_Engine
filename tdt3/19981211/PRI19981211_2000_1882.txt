Two Palestinians were killed today in clashes with Israeli troops 
over the release of Palestinian prisoners in Israeli jails. The violence 
has erupted on the eve of President Clinton's arrival in the Middle 
East. Paul Adams reports from Jerusalem. The issue still threatens 
to wreck this weekend's pivotal visit by President Clinton. Efforts 
to reach a compromise seemed to have faulted. Israel's Cabinet Secretary, 
Danny Navet, said the government would not accept an American proposal 
to set up a committee to discuss the status of Palestinian prisoners. 
In an angry response, the Palestinian negotiator, Sat Adakat, said 
Mr. Navet's remarks showed the peace process was as good as over. 
Israel, he said, was looking for excuses not to implement the Wye 
agreement. Paul Adams, BBC, Jerusalem.
