The doctor treating Joe DiMaggio says the baseball legend is near 
death. Dr. Earl Barron says the hall of famer remains in a coma and 
has stopped responding to antibiotics being given to treat a lung 
infection. DiMaggio entered a Florida hospital October 12th to have 
a cancerous tumor removed from his right lung. Since then, his condition 
has at times improved and then worsened. Barron says the DiMaggio 
family is preparing for the worst. The family is meeting OT the hospital 
to discuss the possibility of do not resuscitate. Let me explain what 
do not resuscitate is. It's not withdrawing support. What it is is 
if his heart should stop, there would be no external cardiac massage 
nor defribulation, just a measure to allow the patient to die with 
dignity if that should come. DiMaggio turned 84 in the hospital November 
25th.
