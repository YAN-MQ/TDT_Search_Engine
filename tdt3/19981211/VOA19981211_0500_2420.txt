The Central Committee of the Palestine Liberation Organization has 
reconfirmed the cancellation of clauses in its charter calling for 
the destruction of Israel. The vote was 81-7 with 7 abstentions. But 
factions opposed to the peace agreement did not attend Thursday's 
Gaza City meeting. The vote fulfills a promise to Israel to nullify 
the anti-Israeli clauses in the PLO charter. Next Monday, the Palestine 
National Council is supposed to reaffirm that vote in President Clinton's 
presence.
