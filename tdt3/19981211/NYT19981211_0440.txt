Led by a conservatively oriented board of trustees, the State University 
of New York appears ready to overhaul its undergraduate education 
by adopting a new core curriculum for all students. For a generation 
or more, many colleges have allowed their students wide latitude in 
fashioning their own course work. But on Tuesday, the SUNY trustees 
are expected to adopt a well-defined core curriculum _ roughly a year's 
worth of courses _ that they deem necessary to produce a well-educated 
student. Ten individual courses will be required _ not only standards 
like math, natural science, foreign language, Western civilization, 
humanities and the arts, social sciences and American history, but 
also less traditional requirements like ``basic communications and 
reasoning,'' information technology and world civilizations other 
than Western. The policy will apply to students entering the university 
in the fall of 2000. Conservative groups applauded the measure as 
adding rigor to SUNY's education, but opponents, including leaders 
of the university's faculty senate, attacked it as overly restrictive. 
They also criticized the board for failing to hold public discussion 
on the specifics of the policy, which were decided this week. SUNY 
officials at the Albany headquarters said they had been troubled that 
students could take easy and narrowly defined courses and graduate 
without huge swaths of knowledge. ``The most common way students escape 
broad exposure is by choosing what they will take,'' said Peter Salins, 
SUNY's provost, in support of the new requirements. ``That is why 
we need a tight set of requirements.'' Each college will define its 
own specifics, but the colleges will be assessed on their programs, 
and financing from the central university administration will be tied 
to how well they do. Some private institutions, like Columbia University, 
have clearly designated core requirements that all students must pass, 
but SUNY officials say they could not find any other public university 
system that had prescribed such a core for all of its colleges. Columbia's 
``great books'' curriculum requires undergraduates to spend nearly 
half of their freshman and sophomore years studying landmark works 
in Western civilization. The University of Chicago has a similarly 
rigorous core. But now, after attacks by the conservative National 
Association of Scholars about the lack of rigor in public higher education, 
the issue of a core curriculum for state universities has been raised 
in several states, including Pennsylvania and Virginia. ``There is 
no doubt that SUNY is a leader here,'' said Tom Carroll, chairman 
of the Center for Excellence in Higher Education, a conservative research 
organization in the Albany area. Randy Daniels, a trustee and co-chairman 
of the subcommittee that developed the new policy, said the trustees 
``are committed to raising academic standards.'' ``Employers, parents 
and students deserve no less,'' he said. SUNY officials said Friday 
that the 15-member board appeared to have more than enough votes to 
pass the new curriculum policy at its monthly meeting on Tuesday. 
``I think it will pass,'' said Candace de Russy, another trustee who 
has pressed for the core requirements. Advocates of a tightly prescribed 
curriculum applauded SUNY's direction, saying that it was the only 
way to insure that students learned what they needed to become educated 
citizens and skilled workers. ``Under the current system, what the 
students learn is hit or miss,'' said Carroll, who wrote a study in 
1996 that criticized SUNY standards. ``SUNY's new general-education 
standards would help insure that all of its graduates are broadly 
educated.'' But some critics said the policy as drawn up was overly 
specific and did not leave enough leeway for the colleges or their 
students. ``This just flies in the face of the principle that the 
board has set out that each campus should develop its own distinct 
mission and academic program,'' said Vincent Aceto, president of SUNY's 
University Faculty Senate. ``And it clearly reaches over into areas 
that have traditionally been the prerogative of the faculty.'' He 
and others were also incensed that the specific policy was not available 
for discussion before being put to a vote Tuesday. ``There's been 
a lack of discussion of the policy with the affected campuses,'' said 
Arnold B. Gardner, a longtime trustee who often disagrees with the 
Pataki-appointed trustees, who he says are trying to micromanage the 
university. ``There are monetary consequences. There are academic 
policy issues. And none of this has been discussed.'' The policy would 
apply initially to 29 senior college and university campuses, but 
SUNY's 30 community colleges would be strongly encouraged to go along 
so that their students could transfer more easily to the four-year 
colleges.
