When Rhonda Tallant of Euless, Texas, decided recently to buy some 
fishing equipment for her husband, Curtis, and a vacuum cleaner for 
their home, she headed toward her computer. ``I've never been one 
to go to the malls and spend six hours looking for two or three gifts 
when I can spend an hour at home in my chair and get everything I 
need,'' she said. She is far from alone. Analysts say that as many 
as 20 million people have made at least one purchase on line. On the 
Thanksgiving weekend, daily visits to Web sites that sell toys, for 
example, jumped 56 percent, to 832,000, from the average before the 
holiday, according to Media Metrix, a company that measures Internet 
traffic. Forrester Research, a consulting firm, estimates that Americans 
will buy almost $8 billion worth of merchandise on the Internet this 
year, up from $3 billion last year, and that holiday sales will account 
for $3.5 billion of the total. While these figures represent less 
than 1 percent of all retail sales, said Kate Delhagen, an analyst 
at Forrester, she expects Internet sales to reach $108 billion, or 
6 percent of total sales, by 2003. That would be twice the 3 percent 
share now made through direct mail and telemarketing. ``This is going 
mainstream,'' she said. ``We are in a momentum-building stage right 
now.'' Consumers are already facing an ever-widening array of Web 
shopping choices _ and not just for books, CDs and toys. There are 
also sites for buying cooking supplies (cooking.com), furs (furs.com) 
and pets and pet supplies (acmepet.com). And traditional retailers, 
like Macy's and Nordstrom, and catalogue merchants like L.L. Bean 
and Land's End, now have Web sites, too. If all the on-line choices 
are bewildering, shopping guides, including Shopguide.com, Bottomdollar.com 
and Mysimon.com, can track down things like an 8-foot Fraser fir Christmas 
tree ($100 from Garden.com). And if you are looking to sell items 
as well as find possible bargains, there are on-line auctions (Firstauction.com, 
Ebay.com). Lou Richman, finance editor of Consumer Reports, has called 
the Internet ``the world's largest mall.'' In that mall, however, 
Forrester Research expects consumers to confine about half of their 
purchases to two areas: travel services (about $3 billion) and computer 
equipment ($1.2 billion). Among Internet shoppers who were asked what 
they were likely to buy on line this season, 47 percent said computer 
software, 44 percent mentioned CDs and 43 percent said books, according 
to Greenfield Online, an Internet marketing research firm. Book shopping 
made a convert of Tina Robichaux, a programmer who lives in Duluth, 
Ga. Recalling her first attempt at shopping on line about five years 
ago, when modems were much slower, she said, ``It was such a pain 
in the neck.'' But having looked everywhere in stores for a book she 
wanted, she gave Internet shopping a second chance and found the book 
at Amazon.com. Now Mrs. Robichaux often shops on the Internet, buying 
airline tickets as well as books, making reservations at bed-and-breakfasts 
(``I love it because you can tell what a place looks like'') and ordering 
fabric from a small company in Alaska. This holiday season, she plans 
to buy at least half her presents on line. With new technology, she 
said, it is easier than ordering by phone. With on-line competition 
growing, many retailers are attracting shoppers by offering incentive 
programs or affiliating themselves with popular Web sites: _ At Women.com, 
a site directed at women, about 30 companies, including, Amazon.com; 
Hallmark; Sears, Roebuck, and Office Max, sell products in an on-line 
store. _ Netcentives.com offers frequent-flier miles on various airlines 
for buying products from any of its three dozen partners, including 
1-800-Flowers, Broderbund Software, Barnesandnoble.com and J. Crew. 
_ Consumers who visit Shop2give.com and buy from an affiliated retailer, 
like Brookstone, Omaha Steaks or Outpost.com, have a portion of their 
spending donated to the charities of their choice. To gauge on-line 
buying, Consumer Reports asked 30 consumers with varying degrees of 
Internet shopping experience to each buy a CD, a polo shirt, a computer 
game and a gift basket on line. ``There were few bargains,'' Richman 
said, adding that prices were similar to those in stores. So far, 
on-line shopping has not made a significant economic impact on traditional 
retailers, but analysts say it eventually will. At some companies, 
Internet profits may be gained at the expense of other businesses. 
``The primary point of cannibalism is catalogue sales,'' said Nicole 
Vanderbilt, an analyst at Jupiter Communications. ``People who are 
willing to shop by catalogue are also willing to shop on line.'' But 
on-line shopping will probably never fully replace brick-and-mortar 
stores. ``For me, you have to try on clothes,'' Mrs. Robichaux said. 
``You don't know the quality of certain things until you see them.''
