Tens of thousands of workers, peasants and students in India have 
begun a 1- day strike to protest the government's free-market policies. 
Authorities have tightened security across the country to prevent 
violence, and several train schedules have been canceled. Trade unions 
organized the strike to demand guaranteed minimum wages and an end 
to the privatization of public-sector companies. About 10 opposition 
political parties have expressed solidarity with the workers citing 
India's grave economic situation and the coalition government's failure 
to control spiraling prices for basic commodities.
