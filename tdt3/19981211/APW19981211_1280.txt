Citing insufficient evidence, a Swiss court on Friday cleared a wealthy 
Russian businessman and alleged mafia boss, Sergei Mikhailov, of charges 
that he belonged to an criminal organization. The surprise outcome 
was a blow to Geneva state prosecutors, who had said that Mikhailov 
posed a threat to western society and should be jailed. He had faced 
a maximum 7 1/2 years in jail if found guilty. The defense had demanded 
his acquittal. ``This is the most important day of my life,'' Mikhailov 
told the four men and two women on the jury. ``You have told Switzerland 
and the whole world that in this country there is democracy, law and 
equality,'' he said in a low calm voice. His comments in Russian were 
translated by the court interpreter. ``I would like to send each of 
you a letter and in each line of this letter I will write `I love 
you, I love you, I love you,''' he declared before leaving the court. 
He was taken back to the prison where he had been held for the past 
two years and was then expected to leave for a secret destination.. 
Mikhailov, 40, was allegedly the leader of the Russian Solntsevskaya 
mafia organization. He was arrested in Switzerland two years ago on 
charges that included the more serious one of money laundering. That 
was dropped because of the problems of gathering evidence in Russia. 
He consistently protested his innocence, although conceded that he 
was ``very, very rich.'' After day-long deliberations, the jury found 
there was insufficient evidence to prove that he did belong to a criminal 
organization. The trial lasted two weeks under unprecedented security, 
with some of the 90 witnesses under police protection. Those most 
at risk were allowed to testify by video from an adjacent room to 
protect their identity. Mikhailov was brought to the court each day 
in a bullet-proof vest and armored vehicle. The Russian was also cleared 
of charges that he forged documents. He was found guilty of a lesser 
charge that he violated strict Swiss property laws restricting foreign 
ownership by buying a villa near Geneva. The judge and jury took into 
consideration the fact he had spent two years in custody and so imposed 
no sentence. Defense lawyer Alec Reymond praised the jury for ignoring 
widespread media coverage of the case _ much of it focusing on Mikhailov's 
supposed mafia connections. ``The jury thought very precisely and 
very strictly,'' Reymond said. ``From now on he's a free man and he's 
been in jail for nothing for two years.''
