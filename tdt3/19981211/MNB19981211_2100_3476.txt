We have some extraordinary firsts of their kind, videotaped pictures 
to show you tonight. The view from a rocket pictures taken today onboard 
NASA's latest mission to Mars. The earth is that thing in the distance 
disappearing as the various stages go off. It goes right through the 
clouds. An amazing view. Shortly after 2:00 today when it took off 
from the cape, beginning a 416-mile trip.
