And Typhoon Faith has rolled into the Philippines dumping heavy rain 
on the eastern islands, knocking out power and forcing the evacuation 
of dozens of families to higher ground. The storm, packing winds of 
up to 150 kilometers per hour, struck the eastern island of Samar 
Thursday night. It's expected to move westward into the South China 
Sea by Saturday. Disaster officials have not received any reports 
of deaths or injuries so far.
