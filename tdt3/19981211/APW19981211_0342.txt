About 200 student protesters gathered near Parliament on Friday to 
demand a fair election and a trial of former President Suharto on 
corruption charges. The rally followed one of the biggest days of 
protest in recent months, when 10,000 students marched on Thursday 
to demand swift democratic reform and legal action against Suharto. 
But the protesters appeared willing to give a reprieve to President 
B.J. Habibie, who has promised to hold general elections in June 1999 
and dismantle the authoritarian legacy of his predecessor. ``We just 
want a just and fair election,'' said student leader Firman Bafo. 
``The only way to form a legitimate government is to wait until the 
next general election.'' Many other students have called for the resignation 
of Habibie. The president, however, has ignored student demands that 
Suharto be tried for allegedly amassing a fortune at the expense of 
state resources during his 32 years in power. Habibie, who replaced 
his former mentor in May after riots and protests, has launched an 
investigation of Suharto's wealth that critics dismiss as cosmetic. 
The protesters on Friday first demonstrated outside the Jakarta police 
headquarters before moving on to Parliament. On Thursday, angry students 
threw stones and bottles at the building. Also Friday, some 250 government 
supporters demonstrated against a human rights commission that has 
criticized the military for its conduct in clashes with students. 
The National Commission on Human Rights was founded by the government 
but has developed a reputation for independence. The government supporters 
complained that the commission ignored human rights violations against 
Muslim groups. Indonesia is predominantly Muslim. ``(The commission) 
should treat everybody the same way,'' said Ranni Zarman, a protester 
wearing an Islamic shawl.
