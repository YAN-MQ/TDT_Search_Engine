President Clinton is going to the Middle East tomorrow. The trip was 
originally set up so he could share some of the credit on the ground 
for getting the Palestinians and Israelis to take another step toward 
a permanent peace. But since that agreement was signed two months 
ago, the Palestinian/Israeli relationship has become worse. And in 
the West Bank today, Israeli troops killed two more Palestinians. 
More than 50 were hurt. The president is also going to go to Gaza. 
And our Middle East correspondent Gillian Findlay is tonight. Ordinarily, 
this would be a welcome image. In Gaza, they are making American flags, 
not burning them. Palestinians are excited. Not just at the presint 
of the United States is coming, he's flying into their new international 
airport. And here, there's no debate over what that means. America, 
Palestinians believe, wants them to have a country. We are a nation 
that deserves a state on equal footing as any other nation in the 
world. And that is precisely what has Israel so concerned. President 
Clinton's visit to Gaza was designed to assure Israelis that the palestinians 
were living up to the peace deal they signed. That's not how Israelis 
see it now. The Israelis are afraid that a unilateral declaration 
of statehood spells bloodshed and they see this being the first step 
down that road. President Clinton thought he was coming to celebrate 
a peace agreement. Now he's trying desperately not to offend the Israelis. 
He's agreed air force one will not fly to Gaza's airport. He'll go 
by helicopter instead. And a visit to the Palestinian city of Bethlehem 
to light the Christmas tree will be balanced by a presidential tour 
of masada, where Jews died resisting the Romans. In the meantime, 
the peace agreement is in trouble. All week, Palestinians have been 
battling Israeli soldiers. Gaza has been quiet. Preparing for the 
visit. This is still one of the poorest places on the planet. But 
for one day, they'll have an American president here. That's a source 
of enormous pride for Palestinians, especially since it has so many 
Israelis upset. Gillian Findlay, Gaza.
