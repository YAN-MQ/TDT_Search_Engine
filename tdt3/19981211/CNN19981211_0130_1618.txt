A pizza place in Clayton, California, may really guarantee "delivery." 
Women across the country claim the "prego" pizza at skipolini's restaurant 
induces labor. Some customers just call it the "pregnant pizza." One 
mom-to-be in New York even ordered it by federal express. The hand-tossed, 
New York-style Pie comes with extra garlic, extra onions, oregano 
and parmesan cheese. It's topped with layers of salami, sausage, pepperoni, 
garlic sausage, olives, mushrooms and bell peppers.
