Former Chilean dictator augusto Pinochet left a London courtroom today 
after telling the magistrate he did not recognize the jurisdiction 
of any court outside Chile. At the hearing formal charges of murder, 
torture and kidnapping were read to Pinochet. It was his first public 
appearance since his arrest in October on a warrant issued by Spain. 
Supporters in Chile released a letter in which Pinochet proclaims 
his innocence and expresses his pain for the lives lost during his 
regime.
