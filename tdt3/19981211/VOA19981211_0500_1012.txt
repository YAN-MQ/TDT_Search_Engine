You're listening to the Voice of America. VOA News Now is broadcasting 
live from Washington. I'm Paul Westfieling along with Charlene Porter. 
Have you talked about your child's health today? Millions of children 
are dying or severely disabled, not from war or drugs, but from a 
less noticeable threat: malnutrition. Malnutrition can cause intellectual 
and physical defects and make it harder for a child to fight off illness. 
Awareness about malnutrition must begin before a child is born. Expectant 
mothers should discuss the foods they need with a health worker to 
give their babies the best possible start. Find out from a health 
worker about the best foods to feed growing children. Your child's 
health is your family's future. It is Universal time. The top news 
story of the hour: the House Judiciary Committee continues its debate 
today on whether President Clinton should be impeached. We'll have 
an update on that story and other news in about 12 minutes. Stay tuned.
