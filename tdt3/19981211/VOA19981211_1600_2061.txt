European Union leaders ended the first day of the year-end summit 
in Vienna Friday with no agreements on an economic policy. Ron Pemstein 
reports the leaders agreed on defense but disagreed about money. The 
Vienna summit is not venue where the European Union's budget battle 
will be settled. That will probably happen in late March here in Brussels 
where the leaders will be on a deadline to reform their finances for 
the next decade. As German foreign minister Yoshka Fisher put it, 
"There is no new money here." That means the last summit of the Austrian 
presidency has all sides defending their current positions. Germany, 
Austria, Sweden, and the Netherlands complain they pay a larger share 
of the European Union's budget than they receive back in benefits. 
They want to reduce costs by cutting the European Union's funds to 
support poorer regions. Spain, along with Greece, Portugal, and Ireland 
defend their aid funds fearing they will disappear in the next century 
when even poor countries from central and eastern Europe join the 
union. On the first day of their two-day summit, the leaders supported 
the British-French defense plans for Europe to take military actions 
when the United States does not want to participate. Ron Pemstein, 
VOA News, Brussels.
