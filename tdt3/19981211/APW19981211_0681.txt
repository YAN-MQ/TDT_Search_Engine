British Prime Minister Tony Blair and his Irish counterpart, Bertie 
Ahern, said they would push ahead Friday with efforts to persuade 
parties in Northern Ireland to overcome differences holding up the 
peace process. ``We will obviously work as hard as we can to get the 
parties together,'' Blair told reporters. ``The people in Northern 
Ireland want progress to be made, and it can be made.'' Blair and 
Ahern met for head-to-head talks in the Austrian capital ahead of 
the year-end summit of European Union leaders. Blair planned to take 
time out from the EU talks to phone Northern Irish leaders. Ahern 
and Blair expressed frustration that the Northern Irish parties could 
not over come the last hurdles to a political solution to the conflict. 
``We've lost an enormous amount of very valuable time,'' Ahern told 
the British Broadcasting Corp. ``We've been negotiating for four, 
five weeks and there's been so little progress _ quite frankly it's 
astonishing.'' Hopes of a deal have snagged on details of power-sharing 
arrangements between Protestant and Catholic parties, the powers of 
cross-border institutions that will give the Irish government in running 
the North, and when, if ever, the outlawed IRA will give up its weapons. 
Reflecting the British and Irish government's attempt to wrap up a 
deal by Christmas, Ahern said the Northern Irish parties ``should 
be coming back on Monday with some hard thinking concluded, rather 
than just playing this back and forward. It's too serious for that.''
