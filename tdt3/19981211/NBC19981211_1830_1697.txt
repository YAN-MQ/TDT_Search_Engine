voting on articles of impeachment against the president. NBC's David 
Bloom is at the White House. David, what's the latest? So far tonight 
for the first time in 24 years, the house judiciary committee has 
voted two articles of impeachment against the president. A third on 
obstruction of justice could come later this evening. A fourth on 
abuse of power could come tomorrow. In 1974, Nixon resigned just ten 
days later. Like Andrew Johnson, Mr. Clinton has vowed to fight. His 
last words today were, all I can do now is the work of the American 
people. tom? David Bloom at the White House tonight. The president 
leaves tomorrow for the Middle East.
