Europe's struggling womens' golf tour has named Tim Howland as its 
new chief executive. The European Ladies Professional Golf Association 
offered a schedule of only 10 major events in 1998 and has had problems 
since the controversial departure last year of Terry Coates and his 
assistant Gill Wilson. The tour, which announced the move Thursday, 
was run this year by managing director John Mort and chairman Trevor 
Kirkpatrick. Howland agreed to take the job while continuing in his 
role with the European Sport Group, which will jointly manage the 
commercial activities of the tour. ESG is a subsidiary of the World 
Sport Group, whose sister companies manage the Asian and Australian 
PGA tours. ``Our first priority will be to develop a coherent schedule 
and more importantly to work closely with existing sponsors,'' Howland 
said. ``The tour has to compete in the commercial marketplace for 
sponsorship support and media exposure.''
