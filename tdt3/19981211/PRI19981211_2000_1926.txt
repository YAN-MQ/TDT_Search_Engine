A rocket carrying an unmanned space craft to Mars has blasted off 
from Cape Canaveral. As THE WORLD's David Lavalley reports, it's the 
latest sign that space science is in top gear. There are currently 
six astronauts orbiting the Earth at work on the International Space 
Station. They're expected to perform more space walks over the next 
few says as they complete their mission before the Space Shuttle Endeavour 
returns home. Another rocket carrying the unmanned Mars Climate Orbiter 
lifted off today from Cape Canaveral and is bound for deep space. 
Scientists are hoping the orbiter, together with another craft to 
be launched next year, will chart unmapped areas of the planet and 
will help answer two scientific mysteries: What happened to water 
that once flowed on the planet's south poll? And did life on the Red 
Planet ever exist? For THE WORLD, I'm David Lavalley.
