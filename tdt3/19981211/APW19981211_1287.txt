BAGHDAD, Iraq (AP) _ U.N. weapons inspectors carried out searches 
again Friday, despite a dispute with the authorities over entry to 
an office of the ruling party. Gen. Hossam Mohammed Amin, who runs 
the National Monitoring Directorate, said three U.N. teams ``carried 
out 14 surprise visits to sites,'' the official Iraqi News Agency 
reported Friday night. Inspectors' spokeswoman Caroline Cross said 
there were fewer inspectors than usual as Friday was the Muslim sabbath. 
But, she added, the teams were carrying on ``with their program of 
work'' and would conduct searches through the weekend. This week's 
searches in and outside the capital, Baghdad have been the most intensive 
since U.N. teams were allowed to resume work last month. Visiting 
teams of weapons experts, who were flown in to conduct the more intrusive 
searches, are scheduled to leave Iraq by Monday. The inspectors must 
certify that Iraq has dismantled its chemical, biological and nuclear 
programs and long-range missiles. Until then, the U.N. Security Council 
will not lift an oil embargo and other sanctions it imposed after 
Iraq invaded Kuwait in 1990. Neither the Iraqis nor the U.N. inspectors 
have spoken of any bid to return to an office of the ruling Baath 
Party, to which a team of 12 inspectors was refused access Wednesday. 
A party leader, standing on the steps of the two-story, stucco building, 
has declared that inspectors will be barred if they try to return. 
The official, Latif Nsayyif Jassim, said the building is private property 
and contains no materials wanted by the inspectors. The U.N. inspectors 
insist they have the right under U.N. resolutions to examine any site 
in Iraq without conditions. Richard Butler, the chief weapons inspector, 
has said the office in the neighborhood of Adhamiya contains ``materials 
of significance.'' U.S. Secretary of State Madeleine Albright warned 
Iraq on Friday that if it did not honor its promise to cooperate with 
U.N. inspectors, ``the military option remains on the table.'' But 
Albright told reporters in Washington that the United States was reserving 
judgment until Butler files his report on Iraqi cooperation to the 
U.N. secretary general early next week. On Thursday, U.N. inspectors 
tried to search what Iraqis called a private home, the official Iraqi 
News Agency reported. The Iraqis insisted, however, that the inspectors 
first get permission from the home's owners. Two women inspectors 
entered ``amid surprised faces of the residents of the house'' and 
got approval, the agency said, quoting Gen. Amin of the monitoring 
directorate. Eight U.N. teams checked 12 sites on Thursday, with two 
teams using helicopters, Amin was quoted as saying. The inspectors 
resumed work last month after a nearly three-month hiatus after Iraq 
banned them from visiting any new suspected weapons sites. Iraq backed 
down on Nov. 14 and pledged full cooperation as the United States 
and Britain were preparing to launch military strikes. The United 
States has said the disputes over the inspections could lead it to 
attack Iraqi without warning.
