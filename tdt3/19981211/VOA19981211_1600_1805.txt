The Judiciary Committee of the U.S. House of Representatives has just 
approved one article of impeachment against President Clinton for 
perjury in the Monica Lewinsky affair. The Republican-controlled committee 
voted along party lines moments ago, 21 to 16, to approve one count 
of perjury for Mr. Clinton's testimony before a grand jury in August. 
The committee is moving forward to vote on three other articles of 
impeachment: obstruction of justice, abuse of power, and one more 
count of perjury. The full House is now poised to take up the impeachment 
issue next week.
