A computer-science expert from Princeton University says he has done 
what Microsoft Corp. insists is impossible: extricated Microsoft's 
Internet Explorer Web-browsing software from its Windows operating 
system. The expert, Dr. Edward Felten, who will take the stand in 
federal court on Monday as a witness for the government in its antitrust 
suit against Microsoft, was asked by the Justice Department to puncture 
a central argument in Microsoft's defense _ namely that browser and 
operating system are inextricably integrated. In direct written testimony 
made public Friday evening, Felten said that ``Microsoft could have 
produced a version of Windows 98 without Web browsing in a way that 
did not adversely affect'' users or developers of other software programs. 
Microsoft, in a statement issued Friday evening, said that Felten 
did not actually remove Internet Explorer from Windows. ``He only 
hid some of the functionality it provides, which does not benefit 
consumers,'' the statement said. ``You can surgically remove someone's 
right arm, but the arm was certainly a useful part of the person's 
body before it was removed.'' The government contends that Microsoft 
illegally tied Internet Explorer to its industry-standard Windows 
operating system to stifle competition in the market for Web browsers, 
the software used to navigate the World Wide Web. Microsoft asserts 
that its browser is not a separate product but an integrated feature 
of its operating system that cannot be removed. If the company can 
convince the judge that Internet Explorer is not a separate program, 
he will be unable to find that Microsoft illegally tied the browser 
to the operating system. Felten, an assistant professor of computer 
science with a Ph.D in computer science and engineering, said he had 
studied the programmers' original instructions, or source code, for 
both Windows 95 and Windows 98 with two graduate-student assistants. 
He and his students found that Internet Explorer was ``hard wired'' 
to the operating system so that it was invoked in many circumstances, 
even if the user had designated another program as the computer's 
default Web browser. So they wrote what he called a ``prototype removal 
program'' that deleted some files and altered others to clip the ``hard 
wire'' connections so that users could not gain access to Internet 
Explorer by any means. Microsoft says that removing Internet Explorer 
will ``break'' Windows 98. But Felten testified: ``The prototype removal 
program does not prevent Windows 98 from booting properly, nor does 
it affect the stability of Windows 98 under ordinary use. Microsoft 
could have produced a version of Windows 98 without Web browsing in 
a way that did not adversely affect the non-Web-browsing features.'' 
After running the removal program, Felten said, he installed the major 
competing Web browser, Netscape Communications Corp.'s Navigator. 
``A computer that has undergone these procedures suffers no apparent 
loss of stability or functionality and provides the user the full 
Web-browsing experience offered by Navigator,'' he wrote. At the government's 
request, Felten also studied the versions of Internet Explorer that 
Microsoft had developed for other operating systems, including Apple 
Computer's Macintosh Mac OS and Sun Microsystems' Solaris, a Unix 
operating system. Microsoft has stated that these other versions of 
the browser are completely different programs and, as such, their 
existence does not bolster the assertion that Internet Explorer is 
a stand-alone application that is distinct from Windows. Felten, however, 
testified that his review of other versions of Internet Explorer ``leads 
me to the conclusion that the user's Web experience with each version 
is substantially similar to the other versions.'' The court was not 
in session Friday, but Felten's testimony had been the subject of 
considerable discussion in court earlier this week, with Microsoft's 
lawyer asserting that all the professor had really done was to delete 
one small ``stub'' file whose only purpose was to trigger the other 
Internet Explorer files scattered through the Windows program. Felten 
acknowledged that most of the ``shared program libraries'' from which 
programs call features and functions from Windows were ``left substantially 
unchanged'' by his removal program. He could have deleted program 
code for Internet Explorer from some of these files, he said, but 
decided not to ``because the limited changes performed by the prototype 
removal program achieve the same results.'' Microsoft, in its statement, 
warned that the scenario Felten described would lead to a world in 
which consumers would have to choose among ``dozens or hundreds of 
incompatible versions of Windows.'' But Felten testified that his 
purpose was to show that Microsoft, despite its arguments to the contrary, 
could have produced a version of Windows that allowed users to choose 
which Web browser they wanted to install.
