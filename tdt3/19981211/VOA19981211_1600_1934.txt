In other news, Israeli troops have killed two Palestinians during 
renewed clashes with protesters in the West Bank. Palestinians were 
demonstrating for the release of political prisoners. The United States, 
meanwhile, is telling Israel and the Palestinians to carry out their 
obligations under the latest peace accord, as President Clinton is 
preparing to visit the region. Secretary of State Madeleine Albright 
says Israel must carry out a promised redeployment of troops in the 
West Bank, which is due next Friday, and she says the Palestinians 
can do more on security issues. Both sides need to move forward to 
implement the second phase. The Wye agreement must be implemented 
as signed. President Clinton is to visit Israel and the Palestinian 
territories starting on Sunday.
