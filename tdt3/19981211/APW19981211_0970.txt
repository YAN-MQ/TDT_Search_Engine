Bruno Roussel and Willy Voet will be banned from professional cycling 
for five and three years respectively for their part in the Festina 
doping affair that overshadowed the Tour de France, the French Cycling 
Federation said on Friday. The FFC banned Roussel, Festina's former 
sporting director, and ex-physiotherapist Voet after the team admitted 
to systematic doping of cyclists. The bans cover competition in France, 
but will likely be endorsed by the International Cycling Union (UCI), 
federation spokesman Christophe Lavagne told The Associated Press. 
That means Roussel and Voet would not be able to take part in professional 
cycling anywhere in the world. The decision came after a meeting Thursday 
of the federations' five-man disciplinary committee. ``I am disgusted. 
I am really mad,'' Voet told French sports newspaper L'Equipe. ``I 
am 53 years old and it is not easy to find a job at my age. I have 
been the scapegoat since the start of this affair.'' The scandals 
surrounding the Tour de France began July 8, three days before the 
first leg, when French customs officials caught Voet was a stash of 
anabolic steroids and erythropoietin (EPO). Festina was expelled from 
the race after Roussel admitted to systematic use of banned drugs. 
By the end of the famous race, six out of the 21 teams had pulled 
out of the Tour, citing police tactics, leaving fewer than 100 riders 
from the original 189. Richard Virenque, who split with Festina after 
being the team's top cyclist, was recently forced to quit the sport 
after being unable to find a new team. But Roussel and Voet have in 
general been treated more harshly than the cyclists themselves. The 
Swiss federation only handed out eight month bans to Alex Zuelle, 
Laurent Dufaux and Armin Meier - allowing them to compete in next 
year's Tour - and fines of 3,000 Swiss franc (dlrs 2,164) fines.
