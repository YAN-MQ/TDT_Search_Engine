Many of our stations, our F.M. and medium-wave affiliates, are going 
to be taking a break from our programming, but we hope you'll return 
to us in 2 minutes on News Now. Just in case you haven't noticed, 
it is Friday, the 11th day of December, 1998. Let's take a stroll 
back in history now. On this date in 1961, 33 United States Army combat 
helicopters and their support crews arrived in South Vietnam. The 
Pentagon said the 400 soldiers would operate the aircraft for the 
South Vietnamese army in its war against the Communist guerrillas. 
The delivery of helicopters was the first indication of direct U.S. 
involvement in South Vietnam's war against the Viet Cong. The United 
States' ultimately unsuccessful commitment to South Vietnam eventually 
included about one-half million American troops and billions of dollars 
worth of military supplies.
