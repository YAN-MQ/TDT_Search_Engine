Undaunted by the resistance of House Republicans to President Clinton's 
plea for an alternative to impeachment, a covey of Cabinet secretaries, 
business leaders and former congressional Democrats continued their 
lobbying of House Republicans to make the arguments against impeachment. 
``We're certainly talking to friends around the country about the 
importance of this matter and how the case that's been made by the 
committee doesn't reach the standards of impeachment,'' the White 
House spokesman, Joe Lockhart said. In recent days, Geraldine Ferraro, 
the former congresswoman from New York and vice presidential candidate, 
has contacted three female Republicans _ Tillie Fowler of Florida, 
Marge Roukema of New Jersey and Deborah Pryce of Ohio _ to sound out 
the views of House Republican women and to urge the lawmakers to oppose 
impeachment. ``She asked what I was thinking, and I told her I would 
vote for impeachment, and she spent the next 15 minutes telling why 
that was the wrong decision,'' Mrs. Fowler said in an interview. ``She 
said it didn't amount to perjury and it wasn't an impeachable offense. 
Then she said, a man is a man is a man, and said that other presidents 
have done this kind of thing before.'' Other undeclared Republicans 
continued Friday to wrestle with their decision. Rep. Jay Dickey of 
Arkansas, the only Republican to vote against the Republican impeachment 
inquiry, is still undecided. But the phone calls, e-mails and letters 
to his offices have intensified dramatically in the last three days, 
running 3-to-1 in favor of impeachment. More importantly, Dickey said, 
the tone of callers has become much more threatening. ``Before, people 
were calling to say, `This is my opinion,''' Dickey said. ``Now they're 
saying, if you don't impeach him, you'll get a primary challenge.'' 
Rep. Frank Riggs, a California Republican who is retiring this year, 
is leaning in favor of voting for at least the perjury articles. But 
Riggs said he has pulled back on his position after listening to the 
debate of the past three days. ``What's influenced me the most over 
last 24 to 48 hours is the notion that the vote to impeach is a vote 
to remove,'' Riggs said. ``Prior to that, I was favorable to the view 
that impeachment is censure. I've raised the bar. That's reinforced 
the gravity of the situation.'' The hardening position against censure 
by House Republican leaders did deal a setback to the White House's 
flat-out campaign to sway Republican House moderates before next week's 
vote on the House floor. Right now, both sides say the vote is too 
close to call.
