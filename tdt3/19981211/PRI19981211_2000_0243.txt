Doctors in South Africa have come under fire at a report published 
today by the truth and reconciliation commission. It says a majority 
of white medical professionals covered up the torture of black patients 
and even denied them emergency care during the Apartheid era. Co-editor 
of the report is Leonard Rubinstein of the American Association for 
the Advancement of Science and Positions for Human Rights. Doctors 
were involved in supporting the regime and security forces in covering 
up torture, breaching confidentiality, the medical education system 
was grossly discriminatory against blacks. Wherever you looked, the 
system failed to promote or protect medical ethics. Leonard Rubinstein.
