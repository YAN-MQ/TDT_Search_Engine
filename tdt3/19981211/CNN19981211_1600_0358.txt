It was a perfect liftoff this afternoon for NASA's Mars climate Orbiter. 
The craft was launched into space from cape Canaveral, Florida, by 
an unmanned Delta II rocket. It should reach the red planet in September 
of next year. It will study the Martian atmosphere, and look for signs 
of water. It will also serve as a communications relay system for 
the Mars polar lander which NASA plans to launch next month.
