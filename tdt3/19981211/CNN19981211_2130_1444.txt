For 20 years, a Vermont man has been turning 19th century abandoned 
barns into big business. He converts the dilapidated buildings into 
beautiful homes. Katharine Barrett has the story. It's been decades 
since they raised a barn in this part of vermont. The Crane helps, 
but it's still hard work -- work that requires precision and patience, 
a job for the barn people. This job is an easy one. What makes it 
easy, it's a very small barn, number one. Number two, it's right here 
in Vermont. Number three, it's not going to be a barn. The owners 
simply want the frame to build a two-bedroom house around its yellowed 
timbers. We looked for a long time to find a barn that would fit our 
size and budget and couldn't find one all summer. And Ken called me 
up one day and said, "I got the barn for you and I already took it 
down." For more than 20 years, Ken epworth and his company, the barn 
people, have saved dozens of vintage Vermont barns. Epworth, who's 
known around these parts as the barn man, takes them down, cleans 
them up and rebuilds them for a tidy profit. Abandoned barns are a 
common sight in Vermont. A century ago, the state had 34,000 dairy 
farms. Today, there are fewer than 2,000. It all starts on the road. 
The barn man scours the back roads of Vermont like an experienced 
Hunter, always looking for a killer bargain. For me, it's one of my 
favorite parts of being barn man, is going to look at barns. You can't 
beat it. Every time you take a turn, it's a surprise. His newest project 
will be turning this English-style hay barn into a new home. Made 
mostly of Hemlock, it was built in 1820, and has been sitting empty 
for years. You could not talk this man who owns this barn into a putting 
a new roof on this. You can see what it's doing, nothing. It's a liability 
to him. But it's an asset to the barn man. He sees great potential 
here. I'm trying to keep the purchase price of the structure about 
10%. So in the case of this one, this is a 30" x 40" with a 13.7 salt 
box addition. This will go for $67,500. Back at the site, it's time 
to raise the barn. The barn people charge about $45 per square foot 
to reassemble a barn on a Pre-existing foundation. The average price 
is $30,000, just for the barn frame. Despite the trappings of late 
20th century technology, the barn people work in ways reminiscent 
of 19th century life. I'm very receptive to how hard people lived 
who built these barns and used these barns. Life was hard for them. 
And most of them left the farm to go to church or to go to the county 
fair at the end of the year. The rest of the time, they were just 
dawn to dusk. And you see it everywhere in the barn. And when the 
building is complete, the barn speaks for a time that's been lost.
