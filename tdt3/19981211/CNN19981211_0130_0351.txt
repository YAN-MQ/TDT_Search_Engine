In Iraq, the ruling party says U.N. weapons inspectors will not be 
allowed to search its headquarters in Baghdad. U.N. monitors hoping 
to make a surprise inspection were turned away from the ba'ath party 
offices Wednesday. The U.N. says normal inspections are continuing. 
Defense secretary William Cohen says Iraq still is subject to U.S. 
military attack at any time, but the Clinton administration intends 
to wait until the inspections are finished before it decides what 
to do.
