In a surprise ending to one of Rhode Island's biggest corruption cases, 
former Gov. Edward DiPrete pleaded guilty Friday to 18 charges of 
corruption, admitting that he accepted bribes and extorted money from 
contractors while in office. Despite a long history of corruption, 
Rhode Island has never seen a governor go the prison. DiPrete, 64, 
said he made the plea in exchange for leniency for his son, a co-defendant 
in the case, which was to have gone to trial next month. Judge Francis 
Darigan of Superior Court in Providence sentenced DiPrete to one year 
in a minimum security prison. As a first-time offender, he will be 
eligible for a work-release program, allowing him to work outside 
the prison in the day. The former governor's son, Dennis DiPrete, 
40, pleaded guilty Friday to a campaign finance violation while on 
his father's election committee and was fined $1,000. In a statement, 
Edward DiPrete said he regretted taking the money. ``The pressures 
of raising money for campaign spending obviously clouded my perspective,'' 
he said. ``However, I can assure every citizen of Rhode Island that 
you received the very best.'' DiPrete was governor from 1985 to 1991. 
He and his son were indicted in 1994 on bribery, racketeering, extortion 
and perjury charges. He was accused of taking nearly $300,000 in bribes 
from engineers, architects and others in exchange for state contracts. 
In 1994, Thomas Fay, the former chief justice of the state Supreme 
Court, was convicted of violating ethics laws. Embezzlement in credit 
unions caused the state's banking system to collapse in 1991. In 1984, 
more than 30 Providence workers and contractors were indicted in conspiracy 
and fraud; 16 went to prison.
