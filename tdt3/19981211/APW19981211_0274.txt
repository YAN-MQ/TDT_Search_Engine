Kazakstan's economy is expected to drop by 1.5 percent to 2 percent 
next year as the country feels the impact from the economic turmoil 
in Russia, a news report said Friday. Karatai Turysov, head of the 
country's economics committee, made the forecast during a parliament 
session in the Central Asian nation on Friday, the Interfax news agency 
said. Kazakstan has large oil reserves, but low world prices are also 
expected to contribute to an economic slowdown next year. Like most 
former Soviet republics, Kazakstan's economy has struggled throughout 
the 1990s.
