Initial reports say at least 50 people have survived the crash of 
a Thai airways jet in southern Thailand today. 146 people were on 
board. Police say they've recovered as many as 26 bodies. Officials 
say the Airbus went down while trying to make an emergency landing 
in a heavy rainstorm. The weather and swampy conditions have made 
it difficult for ambulances to reach the crash site. Thailand's transportation 
minister says some members of the country's parliament were among 
those on board.
