President Boris Yeltsin ventured into his Kremlin office Friday to 
meet with several top aides and sign orders, and then retreated again 
to a country residence, his spokesman said. It was the first time 
Yeltsin had gone to the Kremlin since Monday, when he fired his chief 
of staff and a number of other aides. On Friday, the president met 
with his new chief of staff, Nikolai Bordyuzha, to discuss ways to 
improve the administration's work, presidential spokesman Dmitry Yakushkin 
said at a news conference. Yeltsin also met with Vladislav Sherstyuk, 
new chief of the government's agency in charge of classified communications, 
or FAPSI, whose previous boss was fired in the Monday reshuffle. Brief 
television footage of Friday meetings showed Yeltsin alternately smiling 
and gesticulating animatedly, and staring glumly at his aides. Like 
most footage of Kremlin meetings, the Friday tape had no sound of 
the president speaking. The president on Friday spoke by telephone 
with Prime Minister Yevgeny Primakov to discuss the next year's budget, 
which was to be sent to the parliament Friday. Yeltsin also recorded 
a radio address to the nation that was to air Saturday to mark the 
fifth anniversary of the approval of Russia's constitution, and signed 
a decree awarding a medal to writer Alexander Solzhenitsyn _ a former 
Soviet dissident and Nobel laureate who turned 80 on Friday. The president 
``had a very active day today, which demonstrates properly the state 
of his health,'' Yakushkin said. Yeltsin has been at the Rus country 
residence, 100 kilometers (60 miles) north of Moscow, since Wednesday, 
when he was released from the hospital after a two-week stay to recover 
from pneumonia. After his trip to the Kremlin on Friday, Yeltsin went 
to the Gorky-9 residence just west of the capital, Yakushkin said. 
``The president needs to go through a rehabilitation period, and doctors 
believe this can be done at a country residence ... with periodic 
examinations at the Central Clinical Hospital,'' Yakushkin said. He 
refused to speculate how long the recuperation will last, however, 
saying only it would take ``as long as necessary.'' Next week, Yeltsin 
is expected to meet with visiting Swiss and Belarusian presidents, 
Yakushkin said. The president, who insists he is still fit to lead 
the country, has spent little time at the Kremlin in recent months 
because of various illnesses. He has handed over responsibility for 
solving the country's economic problems to Prime Minister Yevgeny 
Primakov.
