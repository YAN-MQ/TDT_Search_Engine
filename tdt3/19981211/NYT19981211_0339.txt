Whose Number to Use On Credit Card Debt? Earlier this year, when the 
credit card industry lobbied Congress to toughen bankruptcy laws for 
individuals, Visa USA and Mastercard International commissioned a 
study that said 10 percent of debtors could repay some card debt. 
Legislation, passed by the House but not taken up in the Senate, would 
have required a single person making $17,900 or more, or a family 
of four making $51,000 or more, to repay 30 percent of credit card 
debts in bankruptcy. If the debtor failed, he risked being pursued 
for the rest of his life for the full debt and penalties. Now comes 
a study that rebuts the finding. According to the American Bankruptcy 
Institute, a nonpartisan, nonprofit research group in Washington, 
only 3 percent of those filing for Chapter 7 bankruptcy can repay 
even a small part of their credit card debts. Chapter 7, under which 
virtually all debts are erased, is used for 70 percent of all personal 
bankruptcies. The study is sure to affect the debate when Congress 
again takes up bankruptcy legislation next year. The institute's study 
was based on people making at least a third more in annual income 
than those in the industry study. That suggests that at the income 
levels the industry reviewed, it would have found almost no one able 
to repay a portion of their credit card debts. Philip Corwin, the 
industry's chief lobbyist, said he was ``skeptical of the study findings,'' 
adding that there was ample evidence that many people understated 
income in bankruptcy filings. David Cay Johnston Charging It, to the 
Tune Of $145 Million an Hour Speaking of credit cards, the holiday 
season is when the plastic gets hot enough to melt. Americans will 
put an estimated $97.3 billion on credit cards, and an additional 
$13.2 billion on debit-check cards, between Thanksgiving and Christmas, 
according to Cardweb Inc., a research firm in Gettysburg, Pa. Those 
figures would be up sharply from the same 28-day period last year, 
when Cardweb estimated $88.2 billion in credit card spending and $8.8 
billion in debit card spending. For credit cards, this year's estimate 
means an average of $3.5 billion a day _ or $145 million an hour. 
But more than $80 billion should be paid off by Jan. 31, Cardweb said. 
Daniel M. Gold Tax Value in the Attic By donating clothing and household 
goods to charities this month, you can get into the holiday spirit, 
accomplish some early spring cleaning and take a tax deduction for 
this year. A booklet by Client Valuation Services, auditors in Lincoln, 
Neb., lists deductions for hundreds of household items. Valuations 
are based on audits of thrift and consignment shops. Values for selected 
items in fair condition include: for men, a long-sleeve dress shirt, 
$8; a two-piece suit, $50; a leather jacket, $60. For women, a long-sleeve 
blouse, $10; a dress, $22; a wedding dress, $122.50; a leather purse, 
$14. An IBM SX 386 computer is valued at $150; an upright vacuum cleaner 
at $24. A caveat: Give away more than $500 of goods and you must fill 
out Form 8283; for more than $5,000, you need an appraisal. The booklet, 
at $15.95, is available by calling (800) 875-5927. Dylan Loeb McClain
