Much more ahead as we continue in our next half-hour here this evening. 
We'll be joined by NBC's chip Reid for a look at the most dramatic, 
the most controversial moments of this day-long debate here on the 
hill. Plus, what America's newspaper opinion pages are saying. What 
the readers seem to be saying right back to them. But first, another 
day. Can your camera take three different picture sizes whenever you 
want? Is your film as easy to load as this? And are your favorite 
pictures as easy to find as this? Advantix. Drop-in film loading, 
index print, and three picture sizes. The Kodak advantix camera. Advantix 
cameras start at under $40.
