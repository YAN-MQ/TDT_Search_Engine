Puerto Rican music has also been in two places at one time: in the 
rootsy world of Mambo, and the slick world of American pop. THE WORLD's 
Marco Worman tells us about a duo that's in two places at once. "Masters 
at Work" is the producing, composing, and arranging team of Bronx-born 
Little Louie Vega and Brooklyn-bred Kenny Dote Gonzales, going by 
the alias of New Yorican Soul, Vega and Gonzales were weaned on reggae, 
disco, and old school rap as much as Latino music. New Yorican Soul 
is taking the two Puerto Rican music camps of Mambo and pop and cooking 
them together as on this track featuring Timbale master Tito Puente 
and Hilton Ruiz on Hammond organ. Louie Vega and Kenny Gonzales admire 
the black and Puerto Rican musicians of the '70s, who they say are 
too often discarded into the musical pile known as disco. That's why 
New Yorican Soul proudly puts Puerto Rican diva, India, out front 
on this track. Cue up the strings, please. "Runaway," New Yorican 
Soul, brought to us by THE WORLD's Marco Worman.
