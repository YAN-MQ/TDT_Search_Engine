The House Judiciary Committee has voted to recommend the impeachment 
of President Clinton on charges of perjury. The second article of 
impeachment was passed just a few minutes ago. Committee members will 
continue to debate changes to the remaining two articles. Minutes 
before the committee started to vote, President Clinton addressed 
the nation and repeated his profound apologies for his behavior over 
his affair with Monica Lewinsky. What I want the American people to 
know, what I want the Congress to know is that I am profoundly sorry 
for all I have done wrong, in words, in deeds. I never should have 
misled the country, the Congress, my friends, or my family. Quite 
simply, I gave in to my shame. President Clinton.
