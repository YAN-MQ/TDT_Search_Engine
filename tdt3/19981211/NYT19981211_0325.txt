Breaking with House Republicans, Gov. George Pataki says he believes 
that President Clinton should be censured, a punishment that he says 
would permit Congress to ``put this behind us and focus on a positive 
agenda for change.'' In a 45-minute interview in his Manhattan office 
Thursday, the Republican governor offered his most detailed remarks 
to date on the impeachment proceedings, describing censure as an ``attractive 
and appropriate'' alternative, provided that Congress finds it constitutionally 
sound. Censure has been a subject of some debate among scholars of 
the Constitution, although a substantial number of officeholders, 
Democrats and Republicans alike, have embraced it. The remarks by 
the newly re-elected Pataki coincide with efforts by both sides in 
the struggle leading up to impeachment votes on the House floor next 
week to win the support of undecided moderate Republicans, many from 
the Northeast. Pataki said he would not call fellow Republicans to 
lobby them on behalf of censure. He described their decision as a 
personal one that should be based on their own beliefs and on their 
view of the kind of precedent a censure vote might set. Nonetheless 
his newly stated position, similar to one taken earlier this week 
by a close ally, Sen. Alfonse D'Amato, R-N.Y., could make it easier 
for House Republicans from New York to vote against impeachment. Although 
the governor is entering the fray rather late, he has influence with 
a few upstate Republican lawmakers who have yet to announce any decision. 
Asked her own view, New Jersey Gov. Christie Whitman took a different 
tack, arguing that Congress should first vote on impeachment before 
even considering censure. Whitman, who earlier in this scandal-ridden 
year called on the president to resign, said she had not followed 
the debate closely enough to offer an opinion on how the House should 
vote on impeachment. At City Hall in New York, meanwhile, Mayor Rudolph 
Giuliani reiterated his opposition to impeachment. ``I believe that 
impeachment should only occur when a president just about can't function 
anymore,'' the Republican mayor said, adding, ``I think there are 
a lot of serious issues about the president's conduct, but I don't 
think it rises to the level of removing the president from office.'' 
Pataki is among a group of Republican governors who have maintained 
that congressional Republicans' focus on impeachment contributed to 
the party's weak showing in the November elections. That was particularly 
the case in New York, he has said, where D'Amato lost his re-election 
bid. But Pataki said in the interview that his support for censure 
was based not on political calculation but rather on what he views 
as an appropriate response to Clinton's wrongdoing. ``I don't think 
you look at the vote in the Judiciary Committee from a strategic standpoint 
or the impact it will have on the party,'' Pataki said. ``It's just 
too important. This is just something that you have to put aside and 
vote based on your true belief.'' Pataki is by nature cautious; he 
tends to delay taking a position on difficult issues. He has previously 
signaled his concern about the behavior of Washington Republicans, 
but declined to say what he thought should happen. Pataki said that 
perjury before a grand jury is a ``major, major matter,'' but that 
it was mitigated in Clinton's case because ``it was about his personal 
behavior.'' Censure, Pataki said, ``is an attractive and appropriate 
step because it does allow us to put this behind us and focus on a 
positive agenda for change _ and yet at the same time publicly and 
officially take an action saying that Bill Clinton did something wrong.'' 
``I really want to see Congress focus on issues that affect people's 
lives, policies that affect people's lives, as opposed to this. I 
just would hope they would act quickly and try to act in a non-partisan 
a way as possible, based on what they view as right,'' Pataki said. 
And the governor was critical of Republicans and Democrats for their 
handling of the issue. ``I think on both sides you have people who 
are approaching it strictly as politics: It's `I want to get this 
guy' or `He's our guy and I want to defend him.' ''
