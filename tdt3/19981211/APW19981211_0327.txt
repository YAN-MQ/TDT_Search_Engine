Thailand's boxing team at the Asian Games is certain to win at least 
two gold medals, and rising stars could add two more, the team manager 
said Friday. Thailand is counting on light-flyweight Suban Punnon 
and boxing hero Somluck Kamsing, who won Thailand's first Olympic 
gold medal in Atlanta in 1996, said Thawatchai Sajjakul. Thawatchai 
expects to see Suban reach the final, where he will have his hands 
full with either a North or South Korean fighter. ``As for Somluck, 
there is nobody out there who is strong enough to snatch his gold 
away,'' Thawatchai added. Winning would give Somluck his second Asian 
Games gold medal. Meanwhile, pressure has been mounting on two rising 
stars. ``We still have one strong boxer in the lightweight, which 
is Pongsit (Wiangwesas), and another one, Parkpoom (Jangphonak) in 
the welterweight,'' said Thawatchai, who manages the country's soccer 
team as well. The two have a good chance to win gold, though it will 
not be easy, he said. For the rest of the team, it's a 50-50 chance, 
he said. Suban won his quarterfinal by defeating Kazakstan's Meity 
Ismilov in a close match Wednesday. The Thai squad suffered its first 
defeat Wednesday night, when super-middleweight Sayidkhan Kulamahmad 
lost by two points to Uzbekistan gold medal hopeful Dilshod Yarbekov. 
``We have lost only one match. The way I see it, we still have a very 
strong team,'' Thawatchai said. Elsewhere, Thailand also is having 
a successful games, with seven gold medals by the end of the fourth 
full day of competition Thursday.
