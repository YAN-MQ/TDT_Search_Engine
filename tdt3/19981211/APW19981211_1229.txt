Three ethnic Albanians were killed Friday in central Kosovo, Serb 
sources reported amid Albanian accusations that Serbian authorities 
are reneging on international commitments. The three Albanians _ all 
known to be loyal to the Serbian regime _ were shot while repairing 
a power station near the central town of Glogovac, the Serb-run Media 
Center in the provincial capital Pristina said. In a separate incident, 
a group of armed Serb civilians reportedly held up six humanitarian 
workers on their way home from delivering aid a village near Urosevac, 
30 kilometers (18 miles) south of Pristina late Friday, said Palok 
Berishaj, a representative of the Kosovo-based Mother Teresa humanitarian 
group. Berishaj said the group included five ethnic Albanians and 
one German national. No further information regarding the whereabouts 
of the six was immediately available. Neither report could be independently 
confirmed. The latest incidents further risk the fragile peace in 
the strife-torn Serb province came as Kosovo's leading ethnic Albanian 
party accused Serbian authorities of reneging on international commitments 
by blocking the first European probe into atrocities here. ``The Belgrade 
regime is in clear breach of its international obligations,'' said 
Alush Gashi, a spokesman for the Democratic League of Kosovo. On Thursday, 
Serb police using armored vehicles prevented a team of Finnish forensic 
experts from reaching the graves of 22 ethnic Albanians allegedly 
massacred at a site in central Kosovo, insisting they accompany the 
Finnish group. Gashi said this was ``proof that the Serbian regime 
is obstructing an international impartial investigation.'' Serbs rejected 
the accusations, saying the Finns had earlier agreed to visit the 
site only in presence of Serb authorities. The Finnish team, working 
under a European Union mandate, was to begin exhumations at the site 
_ the first in a series of six Kosovo locations to which Belgrade 
had previously granted access. Gashi said if the probe is to include 
Serb officials, (ethnic) Albanian experts should also be present _ 
a demand the Serbs flat out refuse. ``There is a legally established 
court of law and the state's institutions are the only ones authorized 
to carry out such investigations,'' Serbian Judge Danica Marinkovic 
said in response. Tino Lahelma, a member of the Finnish team, said 
Friday his group was also aware of the request by the Kosovo Albanians. 
``We are still involved in discussions with Serbian authorities in 
trying to find a pragmatic solution to all this,'' Lahelma said. Lahelma 
did not know when his team would begin exhumations. Hundreds of, 13th
