A U.S. envoy and the U.N.'s resident representative here met Friday 
to coordinate efforts on reducing regional tensions over Cyprus' decision 
to deploy Russian missiles. Thomas Miller, the State Department's 
coordinator for Cyprus, said in a statement on arrival Thursday that 
``the missiles clearly are a problem.'' Miller and the U.N. official, 
Dame Ann Hercus, refused to talk to reporters after their 90-minute 
meeting at the U.S. Embassy. Turkey has warned it will use force to 
prevent the deployment of the Russian S-300 antiaircraft missiles 
ordered by the Greek Cypriot government. The threat has raised the 
specter of a war with Greece, which has a joint defense pact with 
this east Mediterranean island nation. Cyprus has said the missiles 
will be deployed in the next month or two, and has rejected suggestions 
by Greece that it set up them on the Greek island of Crete instead. 
However, the proposal is still being pushed. Cyprus has been split 
into a Greek Cypriot controlled south and a Turkish occupied north 
since 1974 when Turkey invaded and seized its northern third in the 
wake of an abortive coup by supporters of union with Greece. A breakaway 
Turkish Cypriot state in the north is only recognized by Turkey which 
maintains 35,000 troops there. Miller is not seeing any Cypriot officials 
as both President Glafcos Clerides, the Greek Cypriot leader, and 
Turkish Cypriot leader Rauf Denktash, are currently abroad. Clerides 
insists on deploying the missiles unless Turkey accepts his proposal 
to demilitarize the island, or if there is progress toward the reunification 
of the island. U.N.-sponsored reunification talks have been deadlocked 
since August 1997 when Denktash walked out demanding recognition of 
his breakaway state and the cancellation of Cyprus' entry talks with 
the European Union as preconditions for his return. Miller will fly 
to Athens later Friday on his way to Istanbul, Turkey, where he will 
join Richard Holbrooke, the U.S. special presidential envoy on Cyprus. 
On Dec. 12 and 13 Holbrooke and Miller will participate in a meeting 
of Greek and Turkish Cypriot businessmen, part of a Holbrooke initiative 
to promote closer cooperation between the Cypriot sides. The two will 
fly to Athens Dec. 14 for talks with senior Greek officials.
