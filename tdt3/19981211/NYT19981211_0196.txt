After 10 years of work, Oxford University Press is publishing the 
24-volume American National Biography next month. With 17,450 biographies 
written by 6,100 scholars and writers, the publishers of the Biography 
aim to create a comprehensive portrait of American history (priced 
at a mere $2,500). How to navigate such a massive collection? You 
could try looking up entries under subject matter, contributor or 
place of birth. But the most interesting index by far is the one organized 
by ``Occupation and Realms of Renown.'' There you can, of course, 
find the usual suspects _ Presidents, Financiers, Explorers, Diplomats, 
Inventors and so on. But if you're searching for the more uncommon 
protagonists of American history, you can find them, too _ Chanters, 
Blind People, Christian Converts, Fluegelhorn Players, Smugglers, 
Gurus, Gangsters, Undertakers and Murder Victims (Crazy Horse makes 
this list). You can even find ``alleged'' protagonists, under Alleged 
Heretics (like Algernon Sidney Crapsey, who was brought up on heresy 
charges by the Episcopal church), Alleged Traitors (like Nicholas 
Bayard, who was charged with treason by the Dutch for siding with 
the English in 1702) or Alleged Murderers (like Lizzie Borden or Sacco 
and Vanzetti). Many people end up cross-indexed under a number of 
headings. John Jacob Astor IV, for example, turns up as a Business 
Leader as well as a Shipwreck Victim (RMS Titanic). Here are some 
of the entries: Adventuresses Although you might expect her to be 
found under famous divorcees or duchesses, Wallis Warfield Simpson 
_ the woman for whom Edward, the Prince of Wales, gave up the throne 
of England in 1936 _ is considered both a `socialite'' and an ``adventuress.'' 
What earns her that title? Maybe what the American National Biography 
calls her lack of ``passion'' for Edward. Brothel Keepers Sally Stanford 
was not only one of San Francisco's most prominent madams in the 1940s, 
but also a restaurant owner and eventually the mayor of Sausalito 
in 1976. She entered politics after a disagreement with city officials 
over an electric sign over her restaurant. ``Her platform included 
support for a ferry system to get people out of their cars and acquisition 
of waterfront property for public use.'' After her term ended in 1980, 
she was elected vice mayor for life. Comb Player Red McKenzie was 
a bellhop at the Claridge Hotel in St. Louis during the early 1920s 
when he began humming jazz melodies into a comb wrapped in newspaper. 
He formed a trio, and went on to make blues recordings, play vaudeville 
houses and sing; later he became a talent scout and promoted other 
jazz musicians. ``It may be difficult for some to take his `blue-blowing' 
seriously, but as an extension of the human voice it is no less valid 
a means of expression than the growling effects of Pee Wee Russell 
on clarinet or Bubber Miley on cornet.'' Eccentrics Known as the ``Witch 
of Wall Street,'' Hetty Green, a banker and private money lender, 
was the richest woman in America when she died in 1916. She was so 
obsessed with money that after her son injured his leg in an accident, 
she disguised herself and him so they could get into charity clinics 
instead of paying for a doctor. The leg eventually turned gangrenous 
and had to be amputated. She wore the same black dress and bonnet 
for years and constantly moved from cheap boardinghouses to cold-water 
walkups to avoid assassins and tax collectors. Hatters John Batterson 
Stetson headed West in 1860 in the hopes of regaining his health after 
contracting tuberculosis. In the course of searching for gold fields 
in Colorado he noticed that people needed more protective headgear. 
So when he returned to Philadelphia he developed ``The Boss of the 
Plains, '' a hat with a wider brim and a high crown to keep out the 
sun and rain and keep the head cooler. It was, as John Wayne said, 
the ``hat that won the West.'' Lighthouse Keeper Ida Lewis, who maintained 
the Lime Rock light in Newport, R.I., was the first female lighthouse 
keeper in the United States. A heroic rescuer of those in need, she 
saved 18 people, altogether, and one sheep. The editor of Harper's 
New Monthly Magazine declared in 1869 that only a ``donkey'' would 
call her actions unfeminine. Military Deserter David Fagen was one 
of the African-American soldiers sent to the Philippines when Spain 
gave the United States the islands after the Spanish-American War. 
Once there, he defected from the U.S. Army and joined the guerrilla 
war against the Americans, becoming a captain in the Filipino national 
army. ``Fagen's actions in the fall of 1899 mark the beginnings of 
an extraordinary expression of African-American solidarity with Filipino 
nationalist aspirations for independence.'' Seamstresses Although 
Betsy Ross is the legendary designer and creator of the first American 
flag, the official biography says there is ``little contemporary evidence'' 
to support the story. George Washington was with his army in New York 
when he supposedly met with Ross in her upholstery shop in June of 
1776. Actually, the first American flag used by the army is believed 
to be the ``Bennington Flag,'' first carried into battle in 1777, 
with 9 stripes and 13 stars over the number 76. Betsy Ross did make 
flags _ just not the famous ``Stars and Stripes.'' ``In May 1777, 
the Pennsylvania State Navy Board paid Betsy Ross almost 15 pounds 
for making `ships colors &AMP; c.''' Teratologist Although most people 
might be unfamiliar with the occupation (a student of ``biological 
monstrosities and malformations''), they know Virginia Apgar for the 
scale _ or Apgar score _ that she developed in 1952 to test the health 
of newborn children. It remains the world's standard assessment. The 
first American to hold a faculty position devoted to the study of 
congential disorders, she can also be found on the 20-cent stamp.
