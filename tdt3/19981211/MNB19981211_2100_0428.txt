and as you heard David mention, already someone is floating out the 
notion at least that the president upon returning from the Middle 
East might say something yet again on this topic. Tonight on "NBC 
nightly news" Tim russert, moderator of "meet the press," ran through 
some of the options that remain for this president. There are three 
cards left to play. The Clinton card -- will the president go farther 
and finally say he lied under oath? That would help. The censure card 
-- can the White House build public opinion to force the republican 
leadership to -- allow a vote of censure along with impeachment next 
Thursday? That would give some republican moderates the out they want. 
A safe vote for censure and then vote no on impeachment, and third, 
the Henry Hyde card -- will Henry Hyde play a passive role after he 
gets done chairing the hearings or will he become an active lobbyist 
for the impeachment of the president? Henry Hyde has enormous influence 
with these wavering moderate republicans. If Henry Hyde decides to 
push hard for impeachment, it's very bad news for the president. Tim 
russert earlier this evening on the political layout of the land.
