Germany's Green party, born out of protest against establishment politics, 
wants to become more professional now that they're in power. The party 
opened a three-day convention Friday aimed at overhauling the party's 
structure so it can hold its own as the junior partner in the new 
Social Democratic-led government. Another goal is to avoid public 
squabbles over policy. ``People expect the Greens to show professionalism 
and consistency as a governing party, and rightly so,'' party co-leader 
Gunda Roestel told the Leipziger Volkszeitung newspaper. Still, many 
Greens cherish the party's traditionally loose style, and proposals 
to give national leaders more power to direct policy are expected 
to trigger controversy at the convention in the eastern city of Leipzig. 
Party leaders are asking delegates to approve creating a new 21-member 
body to coordinate among Greens lawmakers, the national leadership 
and local activists. For the new council, leaders also want to waive 
a time-honored Greens rule excluding lawmakers and ministers from 
holding party posts. Once radical, the Greens won power at the national 
level for the first time in September elections, snaring three Cabinet 
posts when they agreed to join the Social Democrats in a coalition. 
Leaders say the Greens must bolster their success by strengthening 
internal organization and discipline. Antje Vollmer, a top Green lawmaker, 
said the party in recent years had ``tended to lose punch because 
of our complicated rules.'' Some 750 delegates also are choosing a 
new party leadership, including an executive council slimmed down 
to five members from nine. A new party co-chair will be elected to 
replace Juergen Trittin, who became environment minister in the new 
government. Antje Radcke, a party left-winger like Trittin, is running 
for the post.
