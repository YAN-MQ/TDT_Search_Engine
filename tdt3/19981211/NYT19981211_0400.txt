HEMPSTEAD, N.Y. _ ``So these two guys are sitting at a bar,'' said 
an old gambler who gave his name only as Kenny to his friend Bobby 
Hingard, a New York Jets fan who was sitting at that same bar in the 
Double H Pub, by the Mineola train station. ``It was during the football 
strike in '82,'' Kenny continued after a sip of Budweiser. ``They 
got nothing to bet on. There ain't no football. Nothing. So they start 
watching the trains go by. With lack of anything better to do, they 
start betting money on the last number painted on the end of the last 
train. And it wasn't nickel and dime stuff. They were betting a couple 
hundred bucks, and that was back in '82.'' Bobby laughed and gagged 
on a smoke. ``Thank God we don't have to do that anymore. We have 
the Jets. J-E-T-S. Jets. Jets. Jets. You a Jets fan, Kenny?'' ``Jets? 
I am now that Parcells is coach. Couldn't say I was a couple a years 
ago.'' So the conversation goes here in the middle of Jets country 
on Long Island. For the first time in a long time there is something 
to cheer about. In the '90s, the Jets have been terrible, really terrible. 
December used to mean the end to another losing season. Now it means 
something, a potential playoff spot. A place the Jets haven't been 
since 1991. Sunday night, the Jets take on their archrivals, the Miami 
Dolphins, in Florida. It is Dan Marino, the Dolphins' quarterback, 
vs. the Jets' Vinnie Testaverde. Bill Parcells against Jimmy Johnson. 
With a victory, the Jets walk into the playoffs. A loss could mean 
another winter of woulda-coulda-shoulda. As of Friday night, the Dolphins 
were favored. Jets fans figure that means easy money. ``Finally, we 
got a lock,'' Kenny said. Even last season, after years of futility, 
the Jets could have made the playoffs by beating Detroit in the final 
regular season game. But a couple of tough calls by the officials, 
a disastrous quarterback switch by Parcells, and with Detroit running 
back Barry Sanders running over them like a one-man stampede, the 
Jets spent January at home. Another disaster in a long line of disasters. 
This year it's different, they are saying here in Long Island. The 
Jets fans have finally returned. The Giants belong to Manhattan, they 
say. The Jets are for Long Island. After all, Gang Green used to play 
at Shea Stadium in Queens. The team up and left for the swamp in 1984. 
The Meadowlands. And that broke everyone's heart, considering that 
it was a two-hour round trip to New Jersey. Hardships piled up. The 
double-overtime playoff loss to the Cleveland Browns in 1987. The 
playoff shutout by Miami in 1983, when lineman A.J. Duhe ran back 
an interception 35 yards in the mud for a touchdown. Dan Marino rubbing 
salt in their wounds again when he pretended to spike the ball but 
instead threw for a touchdown in 1994. The next two seasons, with 
Rich Kotite as coach, when the Jets posted a cumulative record of 
4-28. Last year's Detroit loss. The flop of the false-messiah quarterbacks: 
Boomer Esiason, Neil O'Donnell, Glenn Foley. It got so bad that Long 
Islanders began buying cable and satellite dishes to watch other teams, 
so their Sunday dinners would not be ruined by having to watch Jets 
games on regular television. ``There's a lot of fair-weather friends, 
that's for sure,'' said Tank Passuello, 59, the former owner of Bill's 
Meadowbrook, now Bogart's, the old-time watering hole of the Jets 
players, across the street from their practice field at Hofstra University. 
``I started getting tired of the bar business, especially when the 
Jets started getting lousy around '76. But I've always been a Jet 
fan. Go to the games every year, yes I do.'' Passuello has been a 
fan since the Jets were known as the New York Titans of the old American 
Football League. He claims that Joe Namath first guaranteed victory 
to him, two nights before the team left for Super Bowl III in Miami 
in 1969. At 6 feet 2 inches and 285 pounds, Passuello got his nickname 
when as a freshman center at Hofstra, he was hit by a Renault. The 
car was destroyed. The Tank ripped his pants. ``Being a football fan 
is a lot like being a football player,'' he said. ``Longevity requires 
perseverance. Us old-time fans are finally getting our due.'' And 
Long Islanders are drunk on the sweet nectar of success. Men of the 
cloth lead their congregations in prayer. ``We asked God to help them 
climb the mountain,'' said the Rev. Alan Ramirez of the Brookville 
Reform Church. Law students take time from their exams to present 
their case for why Jets fans deserve a championship. ``I used to think 
there were eight Jets fans in the whole world,'' said Steve Tretola, 
23, of Hofstra Law School, having a drink Friday at Bogart's bar. 
``We suffered. Now? Forget about it.'' About the only negative word 
comes from Joe Gardi, the football coach at Hofstra and a former Jets 
defensive coordinator, who said he was annoyed to hear ``that the 
Jets have always been losers.'' ``In '82, we were a game from the 
Super Bowl,'' he said, ``and we were the toast of the town.'' Even 
children have put the Jets on their wish lists. At the Double H Pub, 
the story is told of Joey Leamy, 9, who asked Grandpa if Santa prays. 
Yes, Santa prays, his grandfather, Michael Leamy, told him. In his 
Christmas letter to St. Nicholas, Joey wrote: ``Dear Santa. Please 
pray for the Jets.'' ``Have him pray for me,'' said Kenny, the old 
gambler. ``I got money on this one.''
