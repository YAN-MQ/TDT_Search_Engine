Earlier today, committee chairman Henry Hyde summarized Republican 
arguments that Mr. Clinton assaulted the rule of law and subverted 
the U.S. system of government. We are following a process wisely set 
down as a check and balance on executive over reaching by our founding 
fathers. This vote says something about us. It answers the question: 
Just who are we and what do we stand for? Is the president one of 
us or is he a sovereign? We vote for our honor, which is the only 
thing we get to take with us to the grave. Democrats say the president's 
behavior is not sufficient grounds for impeachment, and many Democrats 
advocate a formal censure of Mr. Clinton instead.
