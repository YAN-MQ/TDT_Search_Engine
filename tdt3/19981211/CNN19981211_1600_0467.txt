A nonprofit institute which performs research on issues of reproductive 
choice says the abortion rate in the United States is at its lowest 
level in 20 years. The study concludes more people, especially teenagers, 
are using more effective methods of birth control. It found 23 of 
every 1,000 women of child-bearing age had abortions in 1996 compared 
to the rate of 22 per 1,000 in 1975. The group says the total number 
of abortions declined by 100,000.
