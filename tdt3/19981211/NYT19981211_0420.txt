The New York Times said in an editorial for Saturday, Dec. 12: Albany's 
recent back-room negotiations about the New York state Legislature's 
desire for a pay raise and Gov. George Pataki's list of quid pro quos 
would normally be dismissed as another episode of the state's dysfunctional 
lawmaking. But these talks shoved his plan for charter schools to 
the fore. As it turns out, his bill is not so much a well-thought-out 
blueprint for innovation in public education as it is a catalog of 
problematic proposals. Under the governor's plan, for instance, taxpayer-financed 
charter schools would be ``encouraged'' to admit pupils ``at risk 
of academic failure'' but could ``refer a student with disabilities'' 
to the regular school district for evaluation and placement. This 
might be an orderly process, or it could be misused as a license to 
dump the hard to educate in regular public schools. Charter schools 
could also issue bonds. But the bill does not spell out who pays bondholders 
if the school defaults. The lenders, Pataki aides say, would assume 
the risk. Sound legislation can only emerge from public hearings with 
open debate, not the secret bargaining to which governors and legislative 
leaders have long been addicted. Evidence of the need for hearings 
comes from the governor's Republican allies in the Senate. Disturbed 
by the Pataki plan, they passed a bill containing major revisions 
to still the fears of favored supplicants. Under one provision backed 
by Joseph Bruno, the Senate majority leader, no more than five teachers 
on a charter-school faculty could be instructors who are not state-certified. 
The Pataki bill has no such limit. Another clause placates 300 rural 
school districts in which the 1997-1998 enrollment was ``less than 
1,500 pupils.'' It permits school boards of these districts to vote 
to ban charter schools. This is a haphazard way to decide eligibility 
for insulation. More than 30 states have charter school laws. Expanding 
New York's range of experimental offerings is fine, provided that 
it is fair to charter schools and to struggling public schools, which 
will continue to educate most children. In that regard, the experience 
of California, home to more than 100 charter schools since 1992, is 
sobering. A new study of California's charter schools by researchers 
at the University of California at Los Angeles found a large gap between 
promise and performance. It found no evidence to support the mantra 
that most of these schools do more with less. Often, it found, the 
community's wealth and ``well-connected leaders'' determine whether 
a school has sufficient funds. When the nearby public schools were 
overcrowded, ``competition'' from a charter school does not force 
improvements in traditional schools, the study found. The interlude 
between now and New Year's Day is no time for the governor, Bruno 
and Assembly Speaker Sheldon Silver to draft an important bill. The 
triumvirate should decouple charter schools from the pay-raise issue 
and other one-dimensional fare, and hold hearings in early 1999.
