Toymaker Hasbro says it will pay $6 million in cash and toy donations 
to settle an antitrust suit. New York's state attorney general sued 
Hasbro, Mattel, little tykes company and toys 'R us last year. He 
claims toys 'R us pressured its suppliers not to ship Hasbro's toys 
to discounters like Sam's club and B.J.'s wholesale club. 43 other 
states joined the suit. Hasbro denies any wrongdoing, but says it 
wanted to avoid lengthy litigation.
