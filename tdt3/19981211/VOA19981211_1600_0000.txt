House of Representatives Judiciary Committee is about to vote on one 
of the articles of impeachment against President Clinton. The president 
is also preparing to make a statement. The leader of France's extreme 
right National Front Party expels his deputy and four other top officials. 
Continuing clashes between Israeli and Hezbollah forces take a toll 
on the local civilian population in Southern Lebanon. Voters in Ganaya 
will choose a president Monday, but the Ganayan opposition is alleging 
massive fraud in the voter registration process and wants the vote 
postponed. Hello, I'm Victor Morales. And I'm Erin Brummett. Details 
of those stories, sports, business, and a visit to a store that supplies 
items for those battling cancer in this hour of VOA News Now. First, 
the news. I'm John Birchard, VOA News.
