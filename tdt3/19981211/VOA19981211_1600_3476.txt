An inventor in South Africa has created a flame thrower, appropriately 
called the blaster to deter potential car hijackers. The blaster fires 
a human-sized fireball simultaneously from both front doors. Sounds 
kind of dangerous. The inventor says the flame thrower, which has 
been fitted to 25 South African vehicles since its market debut last 
month would definitely blind an attacker but is not lethal. The inventor 
says demand for the $655 device is huge. The blaster hasn't been deemed 
illegal in South Africa, which last year alone suffered more than 
13,000 car hijackings. The inventor says he filed an international 
patent application and expects thousands of orders from around the 
world.
