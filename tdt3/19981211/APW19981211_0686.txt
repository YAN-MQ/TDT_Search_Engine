Swiss dealers and collectors played a major part in World War II trafficking 
in Nazi-looted art, but no one was ever punished, a government-commissioned 
report said Friday. In fact, some prominent collectors and dealers 
were even compensated by the Swiss government when, in a fraction 
of the cases, they were forced to return the art, said the report. 
``What happened during and after the war in the art-trading world 
is a scandal,'' said historian Thomas Buomberger, who for two years 
coordinated the report on Switzerland's role in the dealings. The 
report was commissioned long before plans were laid for the U.S.-sponsored 
conference in Washington earlier this month to gain an overview of 
what happened to the art, much of which was stolen from Holocaust 
victims. Buomberger said that his view of the Swiss involvement was 
limited mainly because many vital archives _ including that of the 
highest Swiss court _ remained closed to him. But he said what he 
was able to examine made it clear that hundreds if not thousands of 
art objects passed through Switzerland. A 1946 U.S. government report 
listed more than 2,000 people in a number of countries who trafficked 
in Nazi-looted art. Buomberger said he found Switzerland's handling 
of victims' claims for the stolen art after the war was similar to 
the treatment of the heirs of Holocaust victims who tried to recover 
bank deposits: great obstacles were placed in their way. Under a special 
law that lapsed in 1947, the Federal Tribunal, Switzerland's supreme 
court, reviewed 77 cases that grew out of a report by the victorious 
Allies who had searched Europe for an estimated 200,000 looted artworks. 
``In every case the Federal Tribunal accepted that the buyers of looted 
property acted in good faith,'' said Buomberger. No one was ever charged 
with theft, extortion or receiving stolen property. As a result, the 
Swiss government compensated the Fischer Gallery in Lucerne, the dealer 
that handled the most looted art in Switzerland, with some 200,000 
Swiss francs (then about dlrs 50,000), he said. Buomberger said he 
was convinced that Theodor Fischer and his main buyer, industrialist 
and weapons dealer Emil Georg Buehrle, had known exactly where the 
artworks came from. He said it was ``the crowning touch'' that the 
court awarded Buehrle two-thirds of what he had paid near the end 
of the war for a looted picture. A prime source for Fischer's purchases 
was Walter Andreas Hofer, head of the art collection of top Nazi Reichsmarshal 
Hermann Goering, added Buomberger. He praised the current management 
of the Fischer Gallery for giving him full access to its archives, 
but he said the Buehrle family let him see nothing and that he also 
encountered some problems with Swiss museums. The Swiss government 
announced that in mid-January it will open a claims office in Bern. 
It has been instructed to provide sensitive help to heirs of Holocaust 
victims looking for art looted from their families.
