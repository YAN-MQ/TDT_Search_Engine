This is meteorologist Valerie Voss with your "CNN Headline News Weather" 
forecast for Friday. An area of low pressure is moving slowly along 
the gulf of Mexico coast, producing generally rain, but along the 
northern and western edges, it could be cool enough for some snow 
at some points. Meanwhile, another system will push into the northwest, 
producing rain and snow as well. Friday's highs, looking relatively 
like what they should for this time of year. 60s and 70s across Florida 
and parts of the gulf coast. Some 50s and 60s in the southwest. Looking 
ahead to Saturday, rain and thunderstorms move slowly eastward through 
the southeast with rain and snow once again in the northwest. Sunday, 
rain showers in the northwest with snow north and some thunderstorms 
south along the east coast. And on Monday, look for scattered showers 
and windy conditions in the northwest. Temperatures, 30s and 40s north. 
50s, 60s and some 70s across the south. Don't forget, four-day forecasts 
for more than 7,200 cities at CNN.com.
