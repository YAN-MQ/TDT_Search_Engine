A pair of famous fingers is walking off the job and being replaced. 
The association of companies that publish the yellow pages plans to 
introduce a new logo next year. It will feature a light bulb and the 
slogan, "get an idea." The fingers were first used in 1961 with the 
slogan, "let your fingers do the walking." It is one of the world's 
most recognized advertising campaigns.
