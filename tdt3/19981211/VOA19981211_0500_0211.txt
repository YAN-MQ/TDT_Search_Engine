The U.S. space shuttle Endeavor crew entered the international space 
station on Thursday, the first time people have been inside the fledgling 
outpost in orbit. VOA science correspondent David McAleary reports 
that the actual work that the crew did inside seemed to have less 
significance than the fact that they were there. Wielding search lights, 
U.S. shuttle commander Bob Cabana and Russian cosmonaut Sergei Kriekelyov 
led the way into the darkened station in a display of international 
cooperation. Commander Cabana became the first to use the call sign 
International Space Station when radioing U.S. Mission Control in 
Houston, Texas. I just can't tell you what a great moment this is 
bringing all these countries together, us working together in space 
for everybody's benefit. It's just -- it's fantastic. Their task Thursday 
was to continue to outfit the station for future use. They installed 
lights, fans and communications gear in the U.S. Unity Module. In 
the adjoining Russian-built Zareyev section to which Unity was mated 
Sunday, they checked video conferencing equipment and replaced filters 
in the malfunctioning battery charger. David McAleary, VOA News, Washington.
