A severe cash shortage is crippling Russia's ability to defend itself. 
The defense minister reports 30% of Russian weapons are no longer 
fit for combat. More than 70% of its naval vessels need repairs, and 
only one-third of its warplanes can fly. Military leaders are seizing 
on the report to push for ratification of an arms treaty with the 
United States. Communist party leaders say that could threaten Russian 
security.
