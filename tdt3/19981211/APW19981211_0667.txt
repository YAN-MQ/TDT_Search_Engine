New Zealand rugby superstar Jonah Lomu has been offered a role as 
a bad guy in the next James Bond movie, according to his manager Phil 
Kingsley-Jones. Lomu, the world's most recognizable rugby player, 
was visiting Britain last month when he was invited to meet producers 
planning the 19th Bond movie. After a 10-minute meeting at Pinewood 
Studios, Kingsley-Jones, received a call offering Lomu the part opposite 
Pierce Brosnan. Kingsley-Jones said Lomu was interested in the role 
but could not agree to a film deal before consulting the New Zealand 
Rugby Football Union. ``Jonah is a big James Bond fan and it is very 
exciting news. But until we talk to the rugby union nothing has been 
decided,'' Kingsley-Jones said. ``Jonah's main goal is to play for 
the All Blacks in next year's World Cup and nothing comes before that. 
`But the Bond people are dead keen to give him a major part. It's 
a lovely feeling and will do wonders for promoting rugby around the 
world. If it goes ahead he will play a big baddy.'' Kingsley-Jones 
said Lomu kept a cool head while meeting movie bosses and was not 
nervous about playing opposite Brosnan, despite never having acted. 
He would first have to join the British actors' union to get an Equity 
card. The movie, tentatively called The World is Not Enough, will 
also feature Scottish actor Robbie Coltrane. American actress Denise 
Richards, who starred in the space epic Starship Troopers, is tipped 
to be the next Bond girl.
