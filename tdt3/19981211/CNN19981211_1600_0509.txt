This is Valerie Voss with your "CNN Headline News Weather forecast" 
for saturday. We'll continue to see wet weather along the gulf coast 
in the lower mississippi river valley, the Tennessee river valley, 
as an area of low pressure moves very slowly along the coast. Could 
be a few rain or snow showers along a cold front, upstate New York 
and northern New England. And of course, the northwest continues to 
be windy, wet, with mountain snow. Saturday's highs, most of the country 
will see somewhere between the 30s and 50s. It will be a little warmer 
in the southeast and southwest. Looking ahead to Sunday, snow showers, 
thunderstorms on the east coast with rain and wind in the northwest. 
For Monday, that rain and mountain snow moves inland across the northwest. 
On Tuesday, some snow showers around the Great Lakes, rain showers 
in the northwest, and temperatures pretty typical for this time of 
year. Remember, you can find four-day forecasts for more than 7,200 
cities on CNN interactive. The address is CNN.com.
