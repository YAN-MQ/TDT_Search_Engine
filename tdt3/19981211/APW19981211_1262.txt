Boris Yeltsin ventured into his Kremlin office on Friday to meet with 
top aides and sign orders before retreating back to his country residence, 
his spokesman said. It was the first time Yeltsin had gone to the 
Kremlin since Monday, when he fired his chief of staff and a number 
of other aides. On Friday, the president met with his new chief of 
staff, Nikolai Bordyuzha, to discuss ways to improve the administration's 
work, presidential spokesman Dmitry Yakushkin said. Yeltsin also met 
with Vladislav Sherstyuk, new chief of the government's agency in 
charge of classified communications. Brief television footage of the 
Friday meetings showed the 67-year-old president either smiling and 
gesticulating animatedly or staring glumly. Like most footage of Kremlin 
meetings, the tape had no sound of the president speaking. Yeltsin 
also called Prime Minister Yevgeny Primakov to discuss the next year's 
budget, which the Cabinet passed Thursday and was heading shortly 
to parliament. Yeltsin also recorded a radio address to air Saturday 
marking the fifth anniversary of the approval of Russia's constitution, 
and signed a decree awarding a medal to writer Alexander Solzhenitsyn 
_ a former Soviet dissident and Nobel laureate who turned 80 on Friday. 
The president ``had a very active day today, which demonstrates properly 
the state of his health,'' Yakushkin said. Yeltsin, 67, has been at 
his Rus country home, 60 miles north of Moscow, since Wednesday, when 
he was released from the hospital after a two-week stay to recover 
from pneumonia. After his trip to the Kremlin on Friday, Yeltsin went 
to his residence just west of the capital, Yakushkin said. ``The president 
needs to go through a rehabilitation period, and doctors believe this 
can be done at a country residence ... with periodic examinations 
at the Central Clinical Hospital,'' Yakushkin said. He refused to 
speculate how long the recuperation will last. Next week, Yeltsin 
is expected to meet with visiting Swiss and Belarusian presidents, 
Yakushkin said. Yeltsin, who insists he is still fit to lead the country, 
has spent little time at the Kremlin in recent months because of various 
illnesses. He has handed over responsibility for solving the country's 
economic problems to Primakov. Yeltin had heart bypass surgery in 
1996.
