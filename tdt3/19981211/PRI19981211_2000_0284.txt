Engineering experts have begun a new battle to save Italy's most endangered 
landmark, the Leaning Tower of Pisa. The BBC's Olla Garen reports. 
The plan is controversial and not without risks. Critics claim it 
could destabilize the fragile structure even further, but the international 
experts behind the project insist that the tower will not survive 
without it. They say it could collapse completely within 20 years. 
This plan aims merely at a correction of half a degree. Trying to 
achieve even this much will take years, but if it works, the experts 
say it will safeguard the tower for centuries to come. Olla Garen 
reporting.
