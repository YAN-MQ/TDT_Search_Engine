Here's a really "cool" Christmas gift. Ben & Jerry's is offering a 
sneak peek at its new ice cream and frozen yogurt flavors months before 
they hit store shelves. The six pack will cost $65 dollars and be 
delivered overnight. Ben & Jerry's says its "world's best vanilla" 
will be included, but the other five flavors will be a total surprise. 
The new flavors won't be unveiled until February or March.
