Highlighting the moribund state of the cash-strapped and disorganized 
military, Defense Minister Igor Sergeyev on Friday said at least 30 
percent of Russia's weapons were no longer fit for combat. The situation 
is especially alarming in the air force, where only one third of aircraft 
can now take to the air, Sergeyev said in a speech before the parliament. 
The inadequate repairs and lack of training have contributed to an 
increasing number of crashes of military aircraft. Earlier this week, 
an Su-27 fighter jet crashed in the Far East, killing its pilot. ``The 
state of airfields continues to deteriorate and the potential to defend 
the nation's airspace has substantially decreased,'' Sergeyev said 
in the parliament's lower house, the State Duma. In the Russian navy, 
over 70 percent of ships need repairs, he said, according to the Interfax 
news agency. The military modernization program has been crippled 
by the government's severe cash shortage, further exacerbated by the 
economic crisis that hit in August. So far this year, the armed forces 
haven't received a ``single new nuclear submarine, tank, combat plane, 
helicopter or cannon,'' Sergeyev said. As a result, only 28 percent 
of all military hardware in the armed forces inventories are of modern 
design, he said. He did not explain what weapons the military considers 
state-of-the-art. In the Strategic Missile Force, 60 percent of missiles 
on combat duty have already served twice their service time, Sergeyev 
told the lawmakers. The military periodically test-fires the missiles 
to check their condition and insists they remain combat-ready. Sergeyev 
and other military leaders have called on parliament to speed up long-stalled 
ratification of the START II arms reduction treaty with the United 
States that would allow Russia to reduce its stockpiles and save money 
for new weapons. However, Communists who dominate the Duma together 
with their hard-line allies have balked at ratification, claiming 
the treaty would hurt Russia's security. No date for the ratification 
debate has been set yet, despite strong pressure from the government.
