Iraq has directly challenged U.N. weapons inspectors saying they will 
not be allowed inside the Baghdad headquarters of the ruling Bas party. 
Inspectors failed to gain access on Wednesday, and party officials 
say if inspectors come back they will be blocked again. The officials 
say the party headquarters contains nothing related to banned Iraqi 
weapons programs; however, Chief U.N. Weapons Inspector Richard Butler 
says he has evidence that the site does contain significant materials.
