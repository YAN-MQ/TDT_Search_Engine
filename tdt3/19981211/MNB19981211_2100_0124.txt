We're going to begin with congressional correspondent Gwen Ifill after 
an exhausting day. The house Judiciary committee voted tonight to 
impeach the president on two counts of perjury. After hours of debate, 
lawmakers recommended the removal of a sitting president for only 
the third time in history. It is an assault on the rule of law. It 
cheapens the oath. It is a breach of promise to tell the truth. We 
have calculated lawlessness which takes us for fools. Article one 
that Mr. Clinton gave false and misleading testimony to the grand 
jury investigating his relationship with Monica Lewinsky. As expected, 
approved along party lines. 21 republicans for -- I believe the case 
we are discussing today has been a small manifestation of President 
Clinton's utter and complete disregard for the rule of law. 16 democrats 
against. They have trivialized the founding fathers' standards of 
treason, bribery or other high crimes and merchandises. It came after 
only 10 minutes after President Clinton appeared in the garden saying 
he would accept rebuke and censure. The president's remarks appeared 
to change few minds on Capitol Hill. Not in the Judiciary committee. 
This simply cannot be wished or censured away. And not for two moderate 
republicans who told NBC news that the president did not go far enough. 
Democrats complained about the wording of the charge which they say 
is too vague. That same tactic used 24 years ago, but it was the opposite 
then, republicans arguing against the impeachment of Richard Nixon 
but this committee is preparing to go even farther. These impeachment 
articles bar the president from ever holding office again. The White 
House has enlisted corporate leaders, lobbyists and former members 
of Congress to contact lawmakers with the -- but the president himself 
-- with the president himself calling for advice. Earlier this evening 
the committee voted out a second perjury charge, this one a civil 
charge having to do with the president's testimony in the Paula Jones 
sexual harassment case. Later tonight they plan to vote on obstruction 
of justice charges and decide whether the president abused power.
