Earning "elite" frequent flyer status means a lot to many travelers. 
And some are willing to go to great lengths to get it. Stephanie Oswald 
explains in this edition of "working ahead." How many flights have 
you flown this year? I've got a ways to go to become one of the elite 
members. There's still time to qualify, or requalify, for "elite" 
status in your airline's frequent flier program. The airlines these 
days are really paying attention to people who can prove that they 
are indeed frequent travelers, taking in excess of ten trips per year. 
It's not the miles elite Flyers are after, it's the perks. Preferred 
check-in and boarding. Priority upgrades, bonus miles. Privileges 
like airport club lounges and things like that are one of the ways 
that just makes travel so much easier. In order to stay elite you 
need to hop on a plane.
