Max Streibl, who led the southern German state of Bavaria from 1988-93, 
died in a Munich clinic early Friday after suffering a heart attack. 
He was 66. Bavaria's parliament observed several minutes of silence 
Friday in his honor. ``Streibl was a passionate Bavarian, a convinced 
federalist and a champion of a regions-based Europe,'' said parliamentary 
president Johann Boehm. A native of Oberammergau and a lawyer by training, 
his political career began in 1962 when he was elected to the Bavarian 
state parliament for the ruling Christian Social Union, the Bavaria-only 
sister party of the conservative Christian Democrats. Streibl quickly 
rose to prominence, appointed secretary general of the CSU in 1967. 
He became state finance minister in 1977 and state premier 11 years 
later after the death of Franz Josef Strauss. He resigned in 1993 
under the cloud of the so-called ``Amigo affair,'' with allegations 
surrounding government loans to an aviation entrepreneur of millions 
of marks (dollars) for a fighter plane project. Streibl was a frequent 
guest on the entrepreneur's Brazilian ranch. Streibl is survived by 
his wife, Irmingard, and three children: Martin, Florian and Monika. 
Funeral arrangements were incomplete.
