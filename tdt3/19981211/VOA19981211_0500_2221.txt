Universal time. U.S. and Russian astronauts have entered the new international 
space station for the first time. Shuttle Endeavor commander Bob Cabana 
and cosmonaut Sergei Kriekelyov led the way into the two-module block 
that was assembled in orbit earlier this week. The astronauts installed 
air ducts and fans aboard the station. They worked on some inside 
wiring. And they're also planning to bring on supplies of clothes 
and tools for use by future space station dwellers. The U.S. space 
agency NASA called the birth of the station a milestone of space travel 
resulting from unprecedented international cooperation among 16 nations. 
The Endeavor crew will finish its work aboard the station today, and 
tomorrow the astronauts will undertake a third and final space walk 
of their mission. Endeavor is scheduled to return to Earth on Monday.
