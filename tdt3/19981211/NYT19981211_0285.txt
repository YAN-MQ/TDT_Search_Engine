``Like Richard Nixon going to China,'' he said, ``you uniquely are 
in a strong position to successfully change the course of Social Security.'' 
And on Monday night, the Clintons held the annual ``Congressional 
Ball'' at the White House. The Marine Band played swing music, and 
about a thousand guests _ Democrats and Republicans _ ate shrimp, 
drank eggnog, and admired the hand-made ornaments from across the 
country that decorate the Christmas tree in the Blue Room. The chatter 
among the knots of politicians, according to some people who were 
present, returned again and again to impeachment, as Clinton's guests 
handicapped his prospects. The president was downstairs, on the ground 
floor, in his usual posture at such affairs: smiling, shaking a hand, 
exchanging a few words, posing for a picture, and then reaching for 
the next hand. ``I got to visit with him for a hot second,'' said 
Rep. J.C. Watts, the Oklahoman who is Republican conference chairman. 
``I got to remind him that the Razorbacks are having a pretty good 
football season this year.'' Watts said that he did not discuss impeachment 
with the other guests. Even two Republican members of the House Judiciary 
Committee _ Bill McCollum of Florida and Elton Gallegly of California 
_ turned up for the party. They did not, however, stand in line for 
a presidential photograph.
