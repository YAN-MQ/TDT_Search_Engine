I'm David Chadwick, VOA News. The U.S. House of Representatives Judiciary 
Committee resumes debate today ahead of an expected vote on proposed 
articles of impeachment against President Clinton. Republican lead 
investigator David Schippers spelled out charges. It is my sorrowful 
duty now to accuse President William Jefferson Clinton of obstruction 
of justice, false and deliberately mis -- misleading statements under 
oath, witness tampering, abuse of power and false statements to and 
obstruction of the Congress of the United States in the course of 
this very impeachment inquiry. The committee began deliberations Thursday 
after lawyers for the minority Democrats and majority Republicans 
summarized arguments. The battle is split along party lines with no 
indication that members are likely to change their views. California 
Republican representative Elton Gallagly says he is prepared to vote 
for impeachment. This is about a president of the United States lying 
under oath, undermining our legal process and violating his oath of 
office. Democrats deny the charges which were drafted by Republicans. 
They say the president's conduct was reprehensible but not impeachable. 
Some have proposed censure as an alternative. New York congressman 
and senator-elect Charles Schuber is among those who believe Mr. Clinton 
should be censured but not removed from office. The American people 
know that being evasive about an extramarital relationship is worlds 
apart from being evasive about matters that go to the core of running 
this republic. Most Republicans feel censure is not enough. Florida 
Representative Charles Cannady says President Clinton must be held 
accountable. He must be impeached and called before the Senate to 
answer for the harm he has done. He must be called before the Senate 
to answer for the harm he has caused by undermining the integrity 
of the high office entrusted to him by the people of the United States. 
Political observers says they expect at least one article of impeachment 
to be approved and sent to the full House of Representatives. Speaker 
Newt Gingrich has notified lawmakers they should be ready for a possible 
vote on the matter next week.
