Coca-Cola Co. disclosed Friday that its fourth-quarter performance 
was proving even more dismal than the company had indicated a few 
weeks ago, because of weakening markets abroad. But in an affirmation 
of its goal to gain more global power in the beverage industry, the 
company also announced a $1.85 billion purchase of overseas rights 
to the soft drinks of Cadbury Schweppes PLC. At an abruptly scheduled 
meeting with securities analysts in New York, Coke officials said 
they expected that volume sales would rise 3 percent but that earnings 
would be 20 percent lower than originally estimated for the current 
quarter. They said a combination of currency devaluations, higher 
marketing expenses and continuing economic turmoil abroad cut into 
earnings, which the company said would be 24 cents to 25 cents a share. 
Many analysts had been estimating 30 cents a share for the quarter. 
The numbers steepened the recent turn to bleaker times for Coke, which 
had been the prototype of the high-flying global growth company. ``It's 
an uncertain situation,'' said Emanuel Goldman, a global consumer-products 
analyst for Merrill Lynch. ``In some of these markets they think they've 
seen the worst, but they don't know how long the worst will stay the 
norm.'' Friday was the second time in three months that Coke's management 
deemed it necessary to manage the company's earnings news in person. 
The 8 a.m. meeting was arranged barely 12 hours earlier. While Coke's 
determination to be a global beverage power might seem to be the source 
of its problems, the company underscored its commitment to that strategy 
by announcing at the same time the Cadbury Schweppes deal. The $1.85 
billion price, which includes $100 million in debt, buys the international 
rights to Dr Pepper, Crush, Schweppes and Canada Dry, and a range 
of juice drinks and bottled water. Sales of those brands totaled 600 
million cases last year, compared with 10.5 billion for Coke outside 
the United States. The juice drinks and bottled water included in 
the purchase make Coke's offerings a little more like those of Pepsico, 
which has pledged to be ``a total beverage company.'' But Wall Street 
seemed more concerned with the short-term numbers than with the acquisition, 
which is not expected to help earnings for at least a year. Investors 
drove Coke shares down $3.0625, to $62.875. In addition, Standard 
&AMP; Poor's lowered its rating on the company. Cadbury's American 
depository receipts, in contrast, rose $4.75, to $66.125. Coke executives 
said that the fourth-quarter slowdown was a result of continuing economic 
turmoil in various parts of the world, including Russia, Japan, Germany 
and Brazil. The company's chairman and chief executive, Douglas Ivester, 
referred to Russia at one point during the meeting Friday as ``just 
a mess.'' Profits were affected as well by higher marketing expenses 
and weakened currencies in many countries. Profits made in the weakened 
currencies translate into lower profits when converted to dollars. 
It is unclear when the company might see improvement. ``There isn't 
a thing in the world I can do about that,'' Ivester said in an interview, 
referring to exchange rates and other economic problems. He added, 
``There's nothing about our performance in the last quarter or the 
last six months that alters our long-term view of this business.'' 
As for the stock price, he said: ``I'm not worried about the stock 
today. I'm not going to retire for years. The people who have taken 
the long view of the company or our bottlers or the stock, they've 
always prospered.'' One analyst, Jennifer Solomon of Salomon Smith 
Barney, rated the stock a ``buy'' for the first time in 18 months 
on Friday. ``We think all the bad news is in the stock right now,'' 
she said. ``It's underperformed the market since the market rallied.'' 
Others remained cautious. Andrew Conway, a beverage analyst for Morgan 
Stanley, said he projected the company's growth at 6 percent for next 
year, slightly lower than Coke's projection of 7 percent to 8 percent, 
without the Cadbury acquisition. The Cadbury purchase covers all the 
120 countries where Cadbury sells its products, except the United 
States, France and South Africa. But Coke could face problems in some 
markets, like Australia, where regulators might consider the combined 
market share of Coke and Cadbury too large. And overall, the Cadbury 
brands represent a niche market for Coke, which derives most of its 
global sales from its cola drinks. John Brock, Cadbury's managing 
director for global beverages, said the decision to sell reflected 
a desire to expand the brands in a way that Cadbury could not achieve, 
and to improve shareholder value. At the same time, selling the international 
business will enable Cadbury to focus on its beverage business in 
the United States, which has long been weakened by its dependence 
on a patchwork of Coke, Pepsi and third-tier bottlers. ``It's not 
that we have a problem,'' Brock said in an interview. ``We have a 
great set of brands that can be more valuable to somebody else than 
to us.'' The agreement requires Coke to hire the 450 Cadbury employees 
in the overseas business. The Coke-Cadbury deal represents a twist 
in the cola wars with Pepsi, which had agreed earlier this week to 
continue distributing Cadbury brands in the United States. In several 
countries, among them Chile, Canada and parts of Eastern Europe, Pepsi 
bottlers package and distribute Cadbury products. Now they will be 
working for Coke and buying concentrate from their archrival. ``Clearly, 
we're planning to take a close look at every aspect of this deal,'' 
a Pepsi-Cola spokesman, Brad Shaw, said.
