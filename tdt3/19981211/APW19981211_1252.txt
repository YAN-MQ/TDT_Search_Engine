Three ethnic Albanians were killed Friday in central Kosovo, Serb 
sources reported amid Albanian accusations that Serbian authorities 
are reneging on international commitments. The three Albanians _ all 
known to be loyal to the Serbian regime _ were shot while repairing 
a power station near the central town of Glogovac, the Serb-run Media 
Center in the provincial capital Pristina said. In a separate incident, 
a group of armed Serb civilians held up six humanitarian workers on 
their way home from delivering aid to a village near Urosevac, 30 
kilometers (20 miles) south of Pristina late Friday, said Palok Berishaj, 
a representative of the Kosovo-based Mother Teresa humanitarian group. 
Berishaj said the group included five ethnic Albanians and one German 
national. No further information regarding the whereabouts of the 
six was immediately available. Neither report could be independently 
confirmed. The latest incidents further risking the fragile peace 
in the strife-torn Serb province came as Kosovo's leading ethnic Albanian 
party accused Serbian authorities of reneging on international commitments 
by blocking the first European probe into atrocities here. ``The Belgrade 
regime is in clear breach of its international obligations,'' said 
Alush Gashi, a spokesman for the Democratic League of Kosovo. On Thursday, 
Serb police using armored vehicles prevented a team of Finnish forensic 
experts from reaching the graves of 22 ethnic Albanians allegedly 
massacred at a site in central Kosovo, insisting they accompany the 
Finnish group. Gashi said this was ``proof that the Serbian regime 
is obstructing an international impartial investigation.'' Serbs rejected 
the accusations, saying the Finns had earlier agreed to visit the 
site only in presence of Serb authorities. The Finnish team, working 
under a European Union mandate, was to begin exhumations at the site 
_ the first in a series of six Kosovo locations to which Belgrade 
had previously granted access. Gashi said if the probe is to include 
Serb officials, ethnic Albanian experts should also be present _ a 
demand the Serbs flat out refuse. ``There is a legally established 
court of law and the state's institutions are the only ones authorized 
to carry out such investigations,'' Serbian Judge Danica Marinkovic 
said in response. Tino Lahelma, a member of the Finnish team, said 
Friday his group was also aware of the request by the Kosovo Albanians 
to attend the exhumations. ``We are still involved in discussions 
with Serbian authorities in trying to find a pragmatic solution to 
all this,'' Lahelma said. Lahelma did not know when his team would 
begin exhumations. Hundreds of people have been killed and up to 300,000 
forced from their homes in Kosovo, a southern province in Serbia dominated 
by ethnic Albanians. Serbia, together with Montenegro comprises Yugoslavia. 
Also Friday, the Albanian side accused the Serbs of preparing new 
offensives, claiming they had brought in new military and police reinforcements 
in the past week. Meanwhile, the Contact Group of nations concerned 
with the Balkans said in Paris on Friday ``time was running out'' 
and urged direct talks between the two sides. So far U.S. envoy for 
Kosovo, Christopher Hill has been shuttling between the two. On Friday, 
Hill said that he will ``intensify'' his efforts to find a peaceful 
solution for the Serbian province. He indirectly denied reports that 
he will no longer shuttle between ethnic Albanians and Serbs, but 
added there should be ``less traveling and more negotiating,'' in 
the future, independent B 92 radio reported.
