After a passionate debate that was by turns solemn with history, fiercely 
partisan and at times sorrowful, the House Judiciary Committee voted 
along party lines Friday to impeach President Clinton and remove him 
from office for perjury. The Republican-controlled committee, voting 
21 to 16, late Friday afternoon charged Clinton in one article of 
impeachment with providing ``perjurious, false and misleading testimony'' 
last Aug. 17 before a grand jury investigating the Monica Lewinsky 
matter. A few hours later, one Republican _ Rep. Lindsey O. Graham 
of South Carolina _ broke with his party as the committee voted 20 
to 17 to approve a second article of impeachment on perjury, this 
time for Clinton's deposition in the Paula Corbin Jones sexual harassment 
case. Graham had long said he would not support impeachment for a 
lie in a civil case. So what began with a civil sex harassment suit 
by an obscure Arkansas civil servant and was transformed into a criminal 
investigation of sex and mendacity by the president, left Clinton 
Friday as the third president to confront impeachment, with a House 
vote scheduled for next week. Andrew Johnson was spared removal from 
office by one vote in the Senate after the House impeached him in 
1868. Richard Nixon resigned in disgrace in the Watergate scandal 
24 years ago after the Judiciary Committee approved three articles 
against him, but before the House voted. On Friday Rep. Henry Hyde 
of Illinois, the chairman, brought the Judiciary Committee's ten-week 
inquiry towards a close, insisting on the gravity of the case. ``When 
the president performs the public act of asking God to witness his 
promise to tell the truth, the whole truth and nothing but the truth, 
that is not trivial,'' the Illinois Republican said. ``Whether it's 
a civil suit or before the grand jury the significance of the oath 
cannot or must not be cheapened if our proud boast that we are a government 
of laws and not of men is to mean anything.'' Clinton himself commented 
for the first time since the committee began televised proceedings. 
Just minutes before the committee was to take its first vote, the 
president walked into the Rose Garden and spoke once again of his 
remorse for his affair with Ms. Lewinsky. For the first time he publicly 
said he would accept a rebuke or censure. ``Mere words cannot fully 
express the profound remorse I feel for what our country is going 
through and for what members of both parties in Congress are now forced 
to deal with,'' he said. ``These past months have been a torturous 
process of coming to terms with what I did,'' he said. ``I understand 
that accountability demands consequences and I'm prepared to accept 
them. Painful though the condemnation of the Congress would be, it 
would pale in comparison to the consequences of the pain I have caused 
my family. There is no greater agony.'' But Clinton stopped well short 
of the admission that some undecided Republicans were looking for 
that he had in fact lied under oath. At the Judiciary Committee, most 
members left the debate to watch the president on television. Then, 
minutes later, in the same cavernous hearing room where Nixon's fate 
was weighed 24 years ago, they voted to approve the first article 
of impeachment and moved on to the second. The committee is to vote 
by Saturday on articles of impeachment accusing the president of obstruction 
of justice and abuse of power. House Democrats argued that Clinton 
had deceived the nation, but said he did not deserve removal from 
office for lies about an extra-marital affair. ``Wake up America'' 
implored Rep. Robert Wexler of Florida, calling for the nation, which 
polls show overwhelmingly opposes impeachment, to make its feelings 
known. ``They are about to impeach our president. They are about to 
reverse two national elections. They are about to discard your votes.''
