Let's look quickly at some morning papers around the country. Peach 
dominates the front pages. "The Philadelphia inquirer" has their own 
member of the congressional delegation they're following. Congressman 
Jon fox, a republican, one of the few Jewish members of the G.O.P. 
caucus, a former schoolmate of Netanyahu going with the president 
to the Middle East. The international Herald tribune talks about G.I.'s 
and north Koreans said to mingle in the most dangerous boarder in 
the world. A reminder, NBC news will continue its gavel-to-gavel coverage 
of the peach hearings which will begin tomorrow morning. That is our 
broadcast for this Friday night. From the nation's capital I'll see 
you here in Washington tomorrow night on "NBC nightly news." We hope 
you to see you here at this same time Monday evening. I'm Brian Williams. 
Good night, everybody.
