The New York State Board of Regents Friday barred local public libraries 
from charging people from neighboring communities for library cards. 
The move is meant to help the 1.3 million New Yorkers who live in 
towns or rural areas without a public library and must pay fees to 
take out books in a library in a nearby town. The board, which charters 
public libraries, banned such fees by approving an amendment to the 
state's 50-year-old public library system regulations. The new rules 
will go into effect Jan. 29. The Regents will, however, allow libraries 
to limit use by residents of neighboring communities who pay little 
or no taxes to support library services, said Janet Welch, the state 
librarian. ``For example, a library might limit borrowing in popular 
areas like best sellers, videos and books on tape,'' she said. ``But 
it cannot charge individuals for cards. Libraries must continue to 
provide free access to the educational and informational resources 
New Yorkers need.'' The Regents chancellor, Carl Hayden, said that 
allowing libraries to limit their services was an interim measure 
to help them cope with the financial burden of accommodating nonresidents 
who will no longer pay fees for cards. He said a recently appointed 
Regents commission has taken up the issue and will propose solutions 
by June 2000. ``We want to ensure the broadest access to information 
for all, not just those who can afford to buy a library card,'' Hayden 
said. Based on a 1997 survey, the State Education Department estimated 
that 90 percent of libraries were providing nonresidents with free 
library cards. Most of the 10 percent that charged fees were on Long 
Island, with others scattered throughout the state. The state is divided 
into 23 public library systems. The new rules will require each system 
to include in its service plan a provision guaranteeing free use of 
its libraries to people residing within its boundaries. And in order 
for the system to continue to receive state aid, the State Education 
Department must approve the plan. Andrew Geddes, acting director of 
the Nassau County Library System, which receives $3 million annually 
from the state, said Friday that he was already working with the state 
on the problem. Many of the 54 libraries in the Nassau system have 
been charging nonresidents fees ranging from $25 to $300. The new 
rules will have little impact on such libraries as the Bayville Free 
Library, which serves only one out-of-town resident, from neighboring 
Mill Neck. Others, however, will be hard hit. For example, the public 
library in Valley Stream, in Nassau County on the Queens border, serves 
several hundred nonresidents who this year paid fees that contributed 
$20,000 to the library's $860,000 budget. The director of the library, 
Marshal Botwinick, said he expected the loss of the income would be 
a harsh blow.
