Austria's Alexandra Meissnitzer led after the first run of a women's 
giant slalom Friday, setting up a sweep of the weekend's events. Meissnitzer, 
who won Thursday's Super-G as the World Cup returned to European snow, 
twisted her way around the classic Piste-G course in 1 minute, 8.53 
seconds to take the lead, ahead of Liechtenstein's Brigit Heeb and 
Olympic champion Deborah Compagnoni. Heeb, who has never won a World 
Cup race, crossed second in 1:08.78, edging Compagnoni, the winner 
of the giant slalom at this French resort last year. Compagnoni, who 
has 13 career giant slalom victories, sits .56 back. Sweden's Anna 
Ottosson clocked the fourth best time in 1:09.10, ahead of Austria's 
Anita Wachter, fifth in 1:09.18. A costly mistake mid-way down the 
course left reigning World Cup giant slalom champion Martina Ertl 
back in 11th place with a 1.14 deficit.
