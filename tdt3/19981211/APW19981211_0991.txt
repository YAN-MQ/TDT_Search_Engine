VIENNA, Austria (AP) - European Union leaders hacked their way through 
the jungle of EU budget reform Friday, but made no real headway at 
their year-end summit in readying the Union's finances for enlargement 
over the next decade. Prospects were better for progress on plans 
for a common defense strategy, which would permit Europeans to assume 
a greater role in continental defense independent from the United 
States but still in the NATO framework. The heart of the talks on 
the first day of their two-day summit, however, was how the 15-nation 
EU will finance its expansion by as many as a dozen new countries 
over the next decade. Rich countries like Germany and Britain already 
feel they are paying too much into EU coffers. German Chancellor Gerhard 
Schroeder, whose country is still paying the costs of absorbing East 
Germany, made it clear that Europe's enlargement problems are not 
going to be solved with a German checkbook. ``There ... is a growing 
understanding that fairness in payments also has something to do with 
strengthening European integration,'' Schroeder said in a television 
interview. The EU has begun membership negotiations with six countries 
- Poland, Hungary, the Czech Republic, Slovenia, Estonia and Cyprus. 
Preliminary talks are also underway with Latvia, Lithuania, Romania, 
Bulgaria, Slovakia and possibly Malta, but they are considered far 
from ready. Eighty percent of the EU's dlrs 100 billion budget already 
goes to farm subsidies. Taking on half a dozen poor East European 
countries along with their millions of uneconomical farmers in the 
next five or six years would break the budget unless serious reforms 
are undertaken. ``There must be compensation for farmers, but they 
can't be compensated forever,'' said Alastair Campbell, spokesman 
for British Prime Minister Tony Blair. ``We'll be focusing on very 
much on stabilization of spending.'' Germany and the other rich countries 
want to freeze spending at current levels so they do not have to pay 
more. Poorer EU countries, for their part, don't want to see their 
subsidies cut in favor of even poorer new members. ``There is no new 
money here,'' said German Foreign Minister Joschka Fischer. ``The 
same goes for the budget question. It's not a matter of finding more 
money but doing more with the money you have.'' Spain is leading a 
group of poorer EU members who want to see the budget expanded. That 
group is insisting on an increase that will add dlrs 24 billion to 
the EU budget by 2006. Germany takes over the rotating presidency 
of the EU for six months, starting Jan. 1. Leaders hope to have the 
entire budget question resolved under the German presidency. Less 
contentious are plans for a common defense strategy, launched by France 
and Britain earlier this month at a mini-summit in St. Malo, on France's 
Normandy coast. The two countries, Western Europe's only nuclear powers, 
issued a statement saying the EU should have the ability to act independently 
with a ``credible military force.'' Any such military action would 
come within the framework of NATO, the French and British leaders 
insisted, but would allow Europeans to launch military action without 
waiting for the United States to take the lead. The United States 
says it favors any European action that will strengthen security on 
the continent.
