MANILA, Philippines (AP) - Philippine Airlines said Friday its decision 
to fire 1,400 flight attendants in July has been upheld by the government 
agency overseeing labor disputes. Philippine Airlines said the National 
Labor Relations Commission agreed to its right to cut its work force, 
especially at a time when the airlines faces collapse because of financial 
difficulties following years of losses, labor strikes and the regional 
financial crisis. ``The free will of management to conduct its own 
business affairs to achieve its purpose cannot be denied,'' the commission 
said in a document furnished to media by Philippine Airlines. A division 
of the commission earlier imposed an injunction order against the 
job cuts following a complaint from the airlines' flight attendant 
union. In June, PAL sought relief from payment of dlrs 2.1 billion 
in debts due to cash flow problems, which it attributed to financial 
losses from operations and costly workers strikes. The airline has 
lost money in most of the past 15 years. It posted a net loss of 8.08 
billion pesos (dlrs 205 million) in the fiscal year ended March, its 
biggest loss in its 57-year history.
