Other news -- initial reports say at least 50 people have survived 
the crash of a Thai airways jet in southern Thailand today. 146 people 
were aboard. Police say they've recovered as many as 44 bodies. They 
say the Airbus went down as it tried to make an emergency landing 
in a Heavy rainstorm. The weather and swampy conditions have made 
it difficult for ambulances to reach the crash site. The Thailand 
transportation minister says some members of the country's parliament 
were among those aboard.
