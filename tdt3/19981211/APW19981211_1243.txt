The president of Utah Valley State College is traveling to Egypt to 
advise government and education leaders on how to merge their country's 
academic and vocational-training college. At the request of Egypt's 
Consul General Hagar Islambouly, Kerry D. Romesburg and two aides 
will fly to Cairo for three days of meetings next week. A wealthy 
Middle Eastern industrialist who visited the Orem campus with Islambouly 
this summer is paying for the trip. ``While they were here, they came 
to campus and were impressed with what we are doing,'' Romesburg said. 
``They were very impressed with how we combine vocational training 
in an academic setting.'' Islambouly and millionaire Ibrahim Kamel, 
chairman of an aerospace-technology company that leases planes powered 
by Rolls-Royce engines to Russian and Egyptian airlines, were attending 
Utah's Russia Days, sponsored by UVSC's Utah-Russia Institute in June. 
Kamel, who is hosting the education summit with Romesburg, also is 
chairman of the Egypt-U.S. partnership for development, created by 
Presidents Clinton and Mohammed Hosni Mubarak in April 1995. Members 
of the partnership's committee are charged with working to enhance 
economic relations between the two countries. Egyptian committee members 
also work to attract attention of U.S. investors toward opportunities 
in the Middle East. Meetings have been scheduled next week with Egypt's 
ministers of education, higher education, finance and industry. Romesburg 
has been asked to explain how UVSC handles both trade-training courses 
and a growing number of liberal-art programs leading to four-year 
degrees. Egypt's education system does not mix trade and academic 
programs at institutions of higher education _ but that may change 
if officials believe such education models are efficient. Romesburg 
said he is not receiving a fee for the consulting work. Rusty Butler, 
head of UVSC's Russia Institute, and Brad Cook, a Brigham Young University 
professor and former UVSC aide, will attend the consulting sessions 
with Romesburg and his wife, Judy, a former teacher.
