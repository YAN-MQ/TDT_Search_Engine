In a fresh blow to the Northern Ireland peace process, the IRA has 
announced it will not hand over any of its weapons. Sources within 
the paramilitary group have told the BBC the decision by the IRA not 
to decommission its weapons, was made at a recent meeting of the organizations 
ruling body. From Belfast, Gary Duffy reports. This is the third occasion 
this year that the IRA has maintained that it will not move on the 
crucial question of decommissioning weapons, but the timing could 
not be more sensitive. IRA sources have told the BBC that other meeting 
of the organization's ruling body, this was firmly ruled out, a blow 
to those who are hoping that in the week of the Nobel Peace Prize, 
there might be a boost to the peace process. Gary Duff in Belfast.
