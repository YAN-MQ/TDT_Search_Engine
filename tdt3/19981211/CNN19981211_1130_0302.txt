I'm meteorologist Dave Hennen with our "CNN Headline News" weather. 
Temperatures today, fairly seasonable in most locations. 40s will 
cover the plains in through the Great Lakes and into the northeast. 
Some 80s are likely though south Florida cool. Back through the southern 
Rockies with highs only in the 30s. Still have some wet weather to 
deal with in Texas and along the gulf coast as low pressure moves 
very slowly through the weekend along the gulf coast. So tomorrow, 
much of the southeast will see some wet weather. High pressure continues 
to build in through the west for fair conditions in through the northern, 
central Rockies. Back into the pacific northwest, though, a new storm 
pushing inland will bring rain along the coast, and some mountain 
snows are expected. A look now at the extended forecast -- on Sunday, 
showers will continue along the east coast. Some snow possible in 
sections of the northeast. And another wet day in the pacific northwest 
is anticipated. By Monday, temperatures really beginning to warm up 
in the plains and the southeast back into the 60s and the 70s. Snow 
is expected to continue, though, in the northern Rockies. On Tuesday, 
the warming trend continues in the south, but turning colder into 
the Rockies. For more weather information, you can log into CNN.com.
