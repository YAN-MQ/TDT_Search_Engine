Now to a special health report, with "the Wall Street Journal" -- 
trial and error. How far would you be willing to go to test a new 
medical procedure? Would you subject yourself to surgery that may 
not provide any medical benefit? Volunteering for experiments is a 
Noble thing to do, but how risky is it? How much do we know? Here's 
NBC's chief science correspondent Robert Bazell. Imagine you are Ruth 
Ashley. You have Parkinson's disease. You sign up for a promising 
experimental procedure, then find out, even though you had surgery, 
four holes drilled in your head, you did not get the treatment. I 
was completely upset for a while. It is a controversial new trend 
in medicine -- placebo or sham surgery. To test experimental treatments, 
surgeons perform the actual operation on some people, but on others 
they only cut the skin or, in some cases, drill holes without giving 
any real therapy. Some doctors say it is the only way to know for 
sure that a new treatment actually works. We have to have that alternative 
to judge whether a treatment is good or bad. Ruth Ashley admits she 
knew what she was getting into. She got a letter clearly spelling 
out that -- but after the operation, she thought she was getting better. 
And so did her doctors, who also were not told whether she received 
the treatment. But then they learned the truth -- she got the sham 
surgery. The doctors running the experiment point out that Ruth Ashley's 
experience is precisely why they need the sham surgery. Some people 
get better just because they think they have had a treatment. This 
positive response is called the placebo effect. So the only way to 
find out whether a treatment really works is to compare it to a placebo. 
But some medical ethicists object, saying sham surgery puts experimental 
subjects at too much risk. It has upped the ante and led people to 
believe now that almost anything goes in scientific research. But 
Ruth Ashley is not complaining. The same letter inviting her to join 
the experiment guaranteed that if she got the sham surgery, she would 
have -- and today, after the operation, she is doing much better. 
When the experiment is completed next year, doctors say that, thanks 
to ruth Ashley and others who agree to risk the sham surgery, they 
will have scientific proof whether important new treatments are truly 
effective. Robert Bazell, NBC news, New York.
