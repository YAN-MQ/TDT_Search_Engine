The Japanese baseball team accused of stealing catchers' signs said 
Friday it found no evidence of wrongdoing, but the club's league is 
planning a separate investigation. Daiei Hawks manager and home run 
king Sadaharu Oh said he was relieved that the team's 10-day internal 
investigation had turned up nothing. ``It is good that what the team 
has been asserting all along was backed up,'' he said in a nationally 
televised interview. The Hawks said Friday that they ``could not confirm'' 
the sign-stealing after viewing videotapes and questioning the three 
accused players along with other team employees. But Pacific League 
Chairman Kazuo Harano said an emergency meeting of top league officials 
was called for Monday to discuss the scandal and a league investigation 
was in the works. According to the charges, a Daiei employee monitored 
a TV camera in Fukuoka Dome that was focused on the opposing catcher. 
The employee picked up his signs and relayed them by walkie-talkie 
to a youngster in the stands, who used a megaphone to tell the Daiei 
batter what pitches were coming. Holding a megaphone in front of his 
face signaled a fastball. Holding it to the right meant a curve or 
a slider, and to the left a forkball. The team said it recreated the 
scenario and found that it was extremely difficult to pull off. ``We 
must do our utmost to never allow such suspicions to emerge again 
in professional baseball, whose mission is to offer dreams and hope 
to the young, as well as joy to the work place and families,'' it 
said in a statement. Oh, who hit a record 868 home runs, was not directly 
implicated in the scandal. But he has also said he feared a lifetime 
ban if his team was found to be behind the scandal. The three players 
have all denied wrongdoing. Sign-stealing is common in Japanese baseball, 
but the reported scheme is so elaborate and blatant officials are 
taking the allegations seriously.
