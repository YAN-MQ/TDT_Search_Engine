What a year it's been for Burt Reynolds! This past spring he received 
his first academy award nomination, and Ron tank reports, the veteran 
movie actor has recently been testing his talents both in front of 
and behind the camera. Burt Reynolds is back on the small screen as 
Logan McQueen in the three-episode series called "hard time." How 
many times has the complaint board spanked you for being a bad-ass 
cop? He's been decorated five times. Spanked six. Not a bad record. 
He's a very prejudiced cop who is kind of a dirty Harry kind of mentality, 
who changes in the second show a great deal. Okay, here we go. Reynolds 
had previously directed numerous episodes of his TV series "evening 
shade" and several of his films. So it was no stretch for him to both 
star in and direct the TNT series. Whenever we'd blow a take, I'd 
just move the camera ten feet so it looked like it was another setup. 
Burt Reynolds in "boogie nights." It was just ten months ago when 
Reynolds' role as a porn director in the film "boogie nights" earned 
a nomination for best supporting actor. Jack horner, filmmaker. It 
was his first nomination in a career that spanned more than 50 films, 
including the critically acclaimed "deliverance" and the box office 
success "smokey and the bandit." He didn't win the Oscar, but the 
nomination reignited his flickering career. Changed everything. I 
mean, it went from being offered some things, being thought of as 
"that's an interesting idea" to "we have to have him." That, Reynolds 
says, is what happened with his next starring role, "mystery Alaska," 
due out next spring from Disney. I was behind a couple of guys who 
are working way too much, and I thought, "I'll never get it," and 
then the nominations came out and I was suddenly in first place and 
they were suckin' wind. Reynolds got a little winded himself in "hard 
time." Braces on both knees from college football injuries forced 
him to forgo his stunt double. Really wonderful guy and a terrific 
stuntman, but he didn't move the same way because he didn't have as 
many operations. So you could tell when it cut from me to him. So 
I kind of had to stay with this guy with the hitch in his giddy-up. 
At 62, Reynolds may be slowing down, but his career is once again 
in the fast Lane. I think I'll just hopefully be allowed to get better, 
and that's what's important. Ron tank, "CNN Entertainment News," Hollywood.
