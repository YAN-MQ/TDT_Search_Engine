The stage is set for a huge showdown next week on the floor of the 
House of Representatives. The house Judiciary committee has approved 
a third article of impeachment against President Clinton. The committee 
approved two other articles today. All will be sent to the full house, 
which is expected to vote next week on whether Mr. Clinton should 
be tried in the Senate. The Judiciary committee is in recess until 
9:00 tomorrow morning. The third article of impeachment alleges President 
Clinton obstructed justice in his attempts to conceal his relationship 
with former White House intern Monica Lewinsky. Debate today was heated 
and highly partisan. There is no evidence whatsoever connects the 
efforts to find miss Lewinsky a job with her submission of an affidavit 
of testimony. She testified that no one ever promised her a job. The 
suggestion to tie that together came from Linda Tripp. We know that 
from the tapes. We know if the president was clearly intent on getting 
her a job, he could have done that. He is, after all, quite a powerful 
person. This went from a back-burner effort by a third-rate employee 
of the government to a very accelerated effort involving a flurry 
of activity by mr. Jordon, the CEO of a major corporation, involving 
indeed the U.S. ambassador to the United Nations. All set into motion 
after it became known -- not before, but after it became known that 
miss Lewinsky would indeed be a witness in and provide testimony in 
the Paula Jones case.
