After hitting the jackpot in innovative real estate lending during 
the mid-1990s and then watching most of its gains evaporate in a month, 
Nomura Holding America, the U.S. arm of Japan's biggest brokerage 
house, plans to get out of the business it helped pioneer. Nomura 
has decided that San Francisco-based Capital Company of America, its 
once highly profitable real estate finance subsidiary, will cease 
making new loans and devote itself exclusively to selling a record-setting 
inventory of existing loans, estimated by the company Friday at more 
than $10 billion. The Japanese firm also plans to lay off about half 
of Capital America's 400 employees and centralize operations in New 
York, shutting most branch offices. American operations of Nomura 
Securities lost $1.16 billion in the March-September period, dragging 
the Tokyo-based parent company into the red. Much of that loss came 
from write-downs of the value of Capital America's real estate portfolio, 
a collection of loans that financed shopping malls, hotels and other 
developments around the country. The company thrived by lumping such 
loans into packages and selling them to investors, but the market 
turned sour in August and September. The change of fortune for Nomura 
has already led to the resignation of Ethan Penner, Capital America's 
founder and vice chairman. He made the company one of America's leading 
commercial real estate lenders and in his heyday had compensation 
packages that ranked among the highest in Wall Street history. But 
Nomura executives from London and Tokyo who reviewed the U.S. operation 
over the last six weeks determined that the business _ in which the 
company sometimes held billions of dollars in loans on its own books 
before selling them as securities _ was too risky, people involved 
in the review said. They also concluded that the huge profits of the 
once cutting-edge business were unlikely to return soon. ``We had 
a good run for six years,'' said Michael Hurdelbrink, Capital America's 
new chief executive and a member of the review team. ``But we asked 
whether this business can continue to generate the returns we want 
in the future, and the answer is no.'' The closing will affect commercial 
real estate developers, who will lose one of their most eager lenders. 
In six years, Capital America made more than $32 billion in loans, 
sometimes to customers who were turned away from big commercial banks. 
Analysts said Nomura's exit would not seriously harm the business 
of turning real estate loans into commercial mortgage-backed securities. 
But developers will have fewer choices, said Gale Scott, a managing 
director in real estate finance for Standard &AMP; Poor's. ``We will 
probably see the loan volume drop and there will be fewer originators,'' 
she said. ``The tables are turning in the industry and it's becoming 
more of a lender's market.'' Nomura's decision to stop new lending 
is good news for some other major players in that market. Many securities 
firms, including Goldman, Sachs; Morgan Stanley Dean Witter, and Lehman 
Brothers piled into the commercial mortgage-backed securities market 
in recent years _ many of them tempted by Penner's early success. 
Some are now cutting jobs and reducing the capital they devote to 
the business. Hurdelbrink, 55, a veteran of Nomura's operation in 
London before being appointed to head Capital America late last month, 
said he would spend the next several weeks developing a new business 
plan and deciding about staff cuts. He said in a telephone interview 
that the firm's main task would be selling off the inventory of real 
estate loans, which analysts described as easily the largest in industry. 
Some of Nomura's commercial mortgage-backed securities now trade at 
a discount to comparable securities from rival firms because Nomura 
was perceived to be a big risk taker, industry rivals said, making 
it harder for the Japanese company to reduce inventory quickly. Hurdelbrink 
said there would be no fire sale. ``Nomura has the capital and the 
patience and discipline to carry the assets,'' he said. ``Let's face 
it: We are not without negative attention recently and we need to 
stabilize the company first.''
