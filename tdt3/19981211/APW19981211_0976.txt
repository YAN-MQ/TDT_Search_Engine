Ukraine's parliament on Friday granted tax breaks for the Chernobyl 
nuclear plant and introduced measures to ease the effects of the plant's 
planned closure on its workers. A total of 273 deputies in the 450-seat 
legislature voted to approve a bill that would exempt funds allocated 
for Chernobyl's closure from profit tax. Ukraine pledged to close 
Chernobyl by 2000 following international concerns that its further 
operation could lead to another accident, like the 1986 explosion 
at one of the plant's reactors, the world's worst nuclear disaster. 
However, Chernobyl needs hundreds of millions of dollars to safely 
shut down its three reactors for good, and to prevent the spread of 
radiation from beneath the concrete shelter built hastily over the 
destroyed reactor soon after the 1986 accident. Ukraine says it will 
not be able to close Chernobyl in time unless the West comes up with 
promised aid funds to help complete two new nuclear reactors in Ukraine 
and provide social protection to thousands of Chernobyl workers. The 
measure approved Friday also introduced five-year tax breaks for businesses 
that would be started in the Chernobyl area to provide former plant 
employees with new jobs. In addition, foreign-made equipment needed 
for the plant's closure may be imported tax-free until 2004. Former 
Chernobyl workers would be eligible for special financial assistance 
from the state for more than a year while they are looking for new 
jobs, the law said. The Chernobyl plant has operated only one reactor 
since 1996, when another reactor was shut down. A third reactor has 
remained inactive since it was damaged in a 1991 fire.
