At this hour, President Clinton is supposed to make what is being 
called a Statement of contrition on impeachment. We hope to bring 
it to you live, when Mr. Clinton approaches the podium at the rose 
garden. The historic debate on proposed articles of impeachment against 
the president has turned into a bitter political clash between democrats 
and republicans on Capitol Hill. The debate on four articles of impeachment 
began four hours ago, but it has bogged down in arguments over the 
specifics of the first article of perjury. Democrats want it to spell 
out the precise statements made by the president that allegedly constitute 
perjury. California democrat Zoe lofgren says the articles of impeachment 
against President Andrew Johnson were specific, point-by-point. But 
Judiciary committee chairman Henry Hyde says details were outlined 
yesterday by GOP chief counsel David schippers. Several republicans 
are accusing democrats of stalling in hopes of derailing the process. 
In order to impose the Burden of an impeachment trial upon the Senate, 
the president, the Supreme Court and the American people, each member 
of the house -- not just the members of this committee -- needs to 
satisfy themselves that there is sufficient evidence, that it's sufficiently 
specific and it meets the clear and convincing Burden. The article 
summarized the allegation that is to go to the Senate and provides 
with it voluminous portions of records that sustains the main allegations 
in the article. And that is not so far fetched or so far removed from 
what happened in watergate.
