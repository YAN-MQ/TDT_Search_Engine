Israeli legislators said Friday they will stage a street protest during 
U.S. President Bill Clinton's visit to press for the release of convicted 
Israeli spy Jonathan Pollard who is serving a life term in a U.S. 
jail. Dozens of demonstrators, including a Cabinet minister and four 
legislators, will wait for Clinton outside the residence of Israeli 
President Ezer Weizman in Jerusalem, organizers said. Clinton is to 
meet with Weizman on Sunday afternoon as part of his three-day visit 
to Israel and the Palestinian areas. Pollard has been imprisoned for 
13 years. Successive U.S. administrations have turned down Israeli 
requests for Pollard's release. After Israel had claimed for years 
that Pollard was part of a rogue operation run without the knowledge 
of the government, Pollard was recognized as an Israeli agent several 
months ago. In October, the wrangling over Pollard led to a last-minute 
crisis in the Wye River Mideast summit. On the last day of the summit, 
Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu demanded Pollard's release 
as a condition for release of Palestinian prisoners from Israeli jails. 
CIA Director George Tenet threatened to resign if Pollard were freed. 
Clinton promised he would review the Pollard case, but said at the 
time he was not making promises to Israel about the outcome. A Clinton 
administration official said Wednesday the Pollard case would not 
be on the agenda during Clinton's visit. The support in Israel for 
the release of Pollard cuts across political divides. Ofir Pines, 
a Labor Party lawmaker and enthusiastic supporter of the Mideast peace 
process, said Israelis cannot understand why Pollard is still in jail 
when Washington has released other American spies after shorter periods. 
``It is hard to believe that Pollard still possesses secrets after 
all this time,'' said Pines who plans to join the protesters. ``We 
think that the real motive of the American intelligence community 
is pure revenge.''
