Baghdad's Central High School, a dreary building where three Iraqi 
presidents received an education, is a symbol of the myths and realities 
that are so jarring in Iraq. On the wall is a badly faded mural of 
Iraqi soldiers and their rifles. Across the playground is a painting 
of Iraqi President Saddam Hussein with three dutiful young men in 
camouflage. And near the entrance reads a slogan, ``A student in school 
is like a soldier in battle defending the nation.'' But in classrooms 
with peeling paint, ramshackle desks and broken windows, the students 
have one thought that outweighs the symbols of patriotism: how to 
get out of Iraq. ``Anyone that has the opportunity, he'll go abroad,'' 
said Mohammed Aboud Hassan, a 19-year-old student. When Iraq's Baath 
Party came to power in 1968, Saddam coined a popular slogan that encapsulated 
the party's vision of its tenuous future: ``Take them young.'' Saddam 
himself was recruited into the party as a teen-ager and, at just 22, 
he tried to kill Prime Minister Abdel-Karim Qassem. But if the disenchantment, 
frustration and hopelessness that run rife among Iraqi youth in the 
streets and schools are any indication, the young aren't coming. It 
is a reality that may pose a mounting threat to the party's ruthless 
three-decade grip on Iraq. The poor are consumed by a struggle to 
survive, and the rich seek a way to leave the country. There's no 
middle class left. ``I don't have any ambition. We earn to live and 
that's it. There's nothing else,'' said Ali Hussein, an 18-year-old 
standing on a corner in the neighborhood of Bab el-Sheik, a warren 
of narrow streets, crumbling buildings and pools of milky sewage. 
That desperation is evident everywhere amid a generation born at the 
start of the Iran-Iraq War in 1980, raised amid the 1990 invasion 
of Kuwait and the ensuing Gulf War, and matured during eight years 
of U.N. sanctions that have wrecked the country. More than 1 million 
Iraqi students _ a stunning 20 percent of the total _ failed to enroll 
in school this year in a country that once boasted literacy of 97 
percent or more, the government says. Those youths who drop out are 
lucky to make dlrs 5.60 a week. Few of them talk politics _ they don't 
have time _ and even fewer say they take part in government-staged 
protests during frequent bouts of tension with the United States. 
In Saddam City, a slum named after the president, young men toil in 
a market of tattered plastic bags strung over rickety stands. Younis 
Ghazi is one. He operates a popcorn machine that he bought in 1990 
with all he had: the equivalent of dlrs 1,250. He now makes maybe 
80 cents during a day that can last from 7 a.m. to 11 p.m. His father 
is blind, and he has eight brothers to support. ``I'm the best off 
of all of them. At least I work,'' he said. The government rarely 
acknowledges the problem of its lost generation. But its leaders, 
aged cadres whose paunches often stretch their olive drab uniforms, 
are increasingly worried that the party's ranks are being depleted, 
said Western diplomats who spoke on condition of anonymity. In one 
sign of that concern, Saddam has put his son Odai in charge of the 
institutions that try to lure youth: the National Olympic Committee, 
the Iraqi Soccer Federation, the Iraqi Youth Federation, the Iraqi 
Students Union and even a youth-oriented TV station. Their target, 
even more than the poor youth in places like Saddam City, is the best 
and the brightest, the diplomats say. Some can be found at the Institute 
for Languages and Translation _ but the government wouldn't like what 
goes on there. Hanging in its lobby are a map of France and brochures 
about Indonesia and Bali. The institute offers classes in English, 
French, Turkish, German, Russian and Spanish as well as courses in 
computers. One of about 20 that have sprung up in Baghdad in the past 
few years, the institute is meant to make it easier for students to 
live abroad _ an almost unthinkable idea a generation ago. ``People 
have the desire to travel, so they need our courses in language,'' 
said the director, Jalal Safa el-Din. He pulls out a postcard from 
San Diego, California, showing sailboats on a bay girded by palm trees 
and mountains. It was sent in May by Hikmat Suleiman, who received 
a certificate from the institute. ``He used it to find opportunity,'' 
Safa el-Din said.
