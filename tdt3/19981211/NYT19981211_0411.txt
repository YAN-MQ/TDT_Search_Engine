Michael Doran, a strapping, seemingly fearless freshman at Yale University, 
once felt safe walking at night along the narrow, oak-shrouded streets 
near the campus in the heart of this economically rebounding but still 
troubled city. ``I used to think that maybe people were just exaggerating 
about the crime in New Haven,'' said Doran, who stands 6 feet 5 inches 
tall and hails from Austin, Texas. ``But I guess it's true about everything 
they said,'' he added, mulling over the death, one week ago, of Suzanne 
Jovin, 21, a senior from Germany, in the mostly middle-class East 
Rock neighborhood, not far from the university. Doran, 18, said he 
had even begun to ``start looking over my shoulder'' when walking 
around town. ``It makes you realize you're not hidden within the walls 
of the ivory tower,'' he said. ``You're in the real world.'' The murder 
of Ms. Jovin, a well-liked political student best known, perhaps, 
for her volunteer work with the mentally retarded, has stunned Yale 
and New Haven. The violent death _ Ms. Jovin was found lying on a 
East Rock street with her throat slashed _ has been all the more disturbing 
to students because no arrests have been made. Annie Eure, 19, of 
Roanoke, Va., a resident of Saybrook College, one of Yale's 12 undergraduate 
dormitories, said she used to run in the East Rock neighborhood. Now, 
she said, ``I've started working out at the gym.'' Nicole Derbyshire, 
19, a sophomore from Brentwood, N.Y., added, ``I have the pepper spray 
with me, but still I'm constantly looking around, making sure nobody 
suspicious is following me.'' Even before the murder, some students 
were on guard. In October, shots were fired in the middle of the afternoon 
at an intersection on the edge of campus. No one was injured, but 
no one has been arrested. Not all of the Yale students looking over 
their shoulders are gazing off campus, though. There were news reports 
that a Yale teacher was being questioned in Ms. Jovin's killing. The 
slaying came in the wake of the arrest last month of Antonio Lasaga, 
a geology and geophysics professor and master of Saybrook College, 
who faces federal charges of possession of child pornography. Lasaga 
was arrested again on Wednesday, accused of violating a condition 
of his release by allegedly being near the home of a minor involved 
in the case, according to the office of the U.S. attorney in New Haven. 
Although she thinks the Lasaga case and the murder are just ``an uncanny 
coincidence,'' Ms. Derbyshire said, ``I'm getting calls from family 
members from other states saying, `What's going on?''' But even though 
the police said again Friday that they have no suspects in Ms. Jovin's 
killing and that Lasaga has not been convicted, some students here, 
among the brightest in the nation, seem to be rushing to judgment 
and believing the worst. ``I'm starting to think, `Wow, what's the 
criteria for getting on the faculty here?''' said Eric Lee, a sophomore 
from Los Angeles. ``I mean, I understand you don't want to run a police-record 
check on everyone, but ...'' Lee, 20, said he was not much more worried 
about his safety after Ms. Jovin's murder, but his girlfriend was 
concerned. ``Now, I walk with her just about wherever she goes,'' 
he said. ``I'm wondering how it's going to affect people applying 
here,'' he added. Applicants, he said, might be reluctant to attend 
Yale after hearing of the speculation that a professor was involved 
in the slaying and the child-pornography arrest. Yale officials said 
the death of Ms. Jovin and the arrest of Lasaga have had no discernible 
impact on admission applications, interview appointments or visits 
to the campus by prospective students and their parents. The killing 
of Ms. Jovin was the first slaying of a Yale student since 1991, when 
Christian Prince, a sophomore from Chevy Chase, Md., was shot to death 
by a nonstudent at the base of the steps of St. Mary's Church on the 
Yale campus. Thomas Conroy, deputy director of public affairs for 
the university, corrected reports that after Prince's death, applications 
to Yale were down 9.5 percent for the 1991-92 school year. ``That 
is false,'' he said. Ms. Jovin's death comes as New Haven is enjoying 
something of a long-awaited renaissance. Although hers was the 14th 
murder in the city this year, there were 22 murders last year in New 
Haven, and city officials have said that serious crime has been declining 
since 1990. The numbers, though, are little solace to students still 
shaking over a colleague's killing. ``At first, I thought it was a 
freak accident,'' said Jennifer Bayot, 18, a freshman, from Jersey 
City. ``We were trying to rationalize it _ well, she must have been 
out late at night, she must have been really far off campus. ``But 
then we found out she wasn't that far off from where I work,'' said 
Ms. Bayot, who works at a community-service center for girls a few 
blocks from where Ms. Jovin's body was found. ``It's a nice neighborhood,'' 
she said. ``At least that's what I thought.''
