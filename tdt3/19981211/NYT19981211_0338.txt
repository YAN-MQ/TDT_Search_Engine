Kenneth C. Brugger, a self-effacing amateur naturalist who made an 
unforgettable discovery, died on Nov. 25 at his home in Austin, Texas. 
He was 80. If the Purepecha Indians of central Mexico had been a shade 
less sophisticated, they might have regarded him as a god, and not 
because the man from Kenosha, Wis., who appeared in their remote mountaintop 
villages in 1975 was a brilliant textile engineer whose proudest achievement 
was his work in perfecting the unshrinkable undershirt. It was because 
he solved an ancient mystery. Brugger had long been lionized by lepidopterists 
in the United States and Canada as the discoverer of the wooded mountain 
slopes in Mexico where hundreds of millions of North American monarch 
butterflies spend the winter. But to the Indians, who already knew 
that, Brugger was the man who brought the news of where their beloved 
monarchs fly off to in the spring: virtually the entire eastern United 
States and the eastern regions of southern Canada. From either perspective, 
Brugger's was a transforming discovery, one that settled an issue 
that had been puzzling scientists for generations, that touched off 
a stampede of butterfly lovers and that transformed the Indian culture. 
Their mountain homeland, 80 miles southwest of Mexico City, was turned 
into a tourist attraction. And this created a campaign to protect 
the monarchs' sanctuaries from loggers and other modern encroachments. 
For Brugger, a modest man who talked little about his achievements, 
the discovery of the monarch butterfly's winter home was a satisfying 
twist to a life of intellectual adventure. A man whose mechanical 
aptitude and mathematical brilliance surfaced early in his life, Brugger, 
who never obtained a college degree, worked as a mechanic in his father's 
garage until World War II. Then the Army saw his test scores and assigned 
him to the Signal Corps at Fort Monmouth, N.J., where he worked in 
cryptography and developed a lifelong interest in homing pigeons; 
at his death he had 13 birds. Returning to Kenosha after the war, 
Brugger went to work as a junior supervisor for Jockey International. 
By the time a divorce led him to pull up stakes in 1965 and start 
a new life as a textile consultant in Mexico City, he had risen to 
chief engineer for Jockey's worldwide knitting operations, designing, 
installing and tinkering with innovative textile machines. Among them 
was the compactor, which compresses cotton fibers so much that when 
they spring back in the wash it compensates for the inevitable shrinkage. 
Rugger's achievements may have been limited to underwear if he had 
not picked up a Mexican newspaper one day in 1973 and seen an advertisement 
placed by Fred Urquhart, a University of Toronto scientist who was 
seeking volunteers to help him track the annual migration of monarchs. 
Since 1940, when he began the project, Urquhart had enlisted 3,000 
volunteers who had systematically tagged thousands of butterflies, 
faithfully reported sightings of their annual flights south, and learned 
much about the world's only insect migration _ one that is especially 
remarkable because the monarchs that swarm out of Mexico in the spring 
are not the ones who return in the fall. In a sustained and unparalleled 
sexual frenzy, monarchs mate themselves into oblivion in a matter 
of weeks, and it is generally their great-grandchildren or great-great-grandchildren, 
hatched out on milkweed leaves from Texas to Canada, that make the 
return trip for what turns out to be a lazy, celibate winter, an abstinence 
that allows them to live long enough to begin the flight back north 
the next spring. The one thing Urquhart had not learned is exactly 
where the monarchs spend the winter. Recalling that he had once driven 
through a sudden storm of monarch butterflies during a trip through 
the volcanic mountains west of Mexico City, Brugger wrote to Urquhart 
and was persuaded to return to the area to search for them. And that 
is how it happened that on Jan. 2, 1975, a date that lepidopterists 
hold dear, Brugger and his wife, Catalina, made their way through 
a forest of Oyamel firs until they reached the 10,000-foot level and 
suddenly realized that the trees were covered with monarchs, as many 
as four million an acre, according to later estimates. As thousands 
of ecstatic tourists have since discovered, the massed orange and 
black monarchs make a breathtakingly beautiful sight. It was a beauty 
that was largely lost on Brugger, who is survived by three children, 
Carl, of Racine, Wis., Katharine Carroll of Kenosha, and Kenneth Jr., 
of Austin; a brother, Robert, of Kenosha; three grandchildren, and 
three great-grandchildren. A man who once came home with a new sports 
jacket with an orange stripe he thought was green, Brugger was totally 
colorblind _ he saw the monarchs as shades of gray.
