What about those members of Congress who haven't decided how to vote 
on impeachment? "New York Times" Washington correspondent James Dow 
has written an article for tomorrow's paper exploring the factors 
that may influence the vote of one member of Congress in particular. 
James Dow is with us tonight from our NBC news bureau here in the 
capital and James, as it happens, the member you chose to profile 
is going to be cornered or fuselaged more exactly on air force one 
all the way to the Middle East and lobbied heavily. Tell us who excess 
what he's expecting. Well, it's Rick Lazio from New York, and I don't 
know what he's expecting. I don't think he's expecting to get lobbied 
heavily. Though I'm sure he's going to have a few conversations with 
the president along the way. He said to me, even a day or so ago, 
that he thought he might even talk a little bit to the president about 
what he would like the president to say further on this entire issue, 
if he gets the opportunity. But he is going as a representative of 
the house leadership to -- to -- to talk about Israel and Israeli 
policies so I think that's what he's mainly expecting. We mention 
on the broadcast last night, Jim, that this almost seems like the 
nafta fight, like a highway Bill, a budget Bill. They're going after 
votes. It's interesting you mentioned nafta, because Lazio mentioned 
that the vote, the upcoming vote on impeachment is not unlike the 
pressure he faced during the nafta vote. He was lobbied heavily. It 
was -- it was an issue where he felt that his political future might 
be at stake, and he ended up voting for nafta, and I think he angered 
a lot of unions along the way. He's in the -- a similar boat here, 
and not necessarily just because of the lobbying. It's also just because 
of what's at stake. It's very difficult for him to really come out 
a political winner in this. If he votes for impeachment, he's certainly 
going to please a lot of die hard republicans, but if he votes against 
it, it raises a lot of problems with moderate or liberal voters in 
New York, and he is thinking of running for Senate in the year 2000, 
and democrats outnumber republicans in New York by 3-2. So it's a 
very difficult situation for him and there's not an easy way out. 
James Dao of "the New York Times," thank you for making time to come 
on the broadcast tonight.
