Workers at a Russian poultry factory have been arrested for locking 
seven colleagues in a meat freezer after accusing them of stealing 
six tons of chicken legs, a news report said Friday. Four security 
officials at the Novosibirsk Poultry Plant first questioned the seven 
workers, then beat them with a bat, then locked them in the freezer, 
police told the ITAR-Tass news agency. ITAR-Tass said the accusations 
of theft were unfounded. Police in Novosibirsk, a city about 2,800 
kilometers (1,750 miles) east of Moscow, freed the frozen workers 
and detained four security officials. The report did not say when 
the incident occurred or how long the workers were in the freezer, 
or what happened to the six tons of chicken legs.
