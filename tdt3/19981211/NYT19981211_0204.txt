After assuring its allies that it represents continuity, the new government 
of Chancellor Gerhard Schroeder is using a bold, often challenging 
directness that is a radical departure from other postwar German administrations. 
Gone are the unquestioning solidarity with a European Union seen as 
the guarantor of German stability, the reluctance to challenge NATO 
on basic points of doctrine and the deference to the United States 
that reflected both a historic debt and an enduring sense of vulnerability. 
In their place Schroeder has bitterly attacked what he called Germany's 
unfairly high contributions to a wasteful European Union budget. Foreign 
Minister Joschka Fischer has suggested that NATO change its nuclear 
policies. And Finance Minister Oskar Lafontaine has made clear that 
American-style global capitalism is not to his taste. ``Strange sounds 
can be heard from Germany these days,'' the influential Munich newspaper 
Suddeutsche Zeitung said on its editorial page this week. ``Where 
is Fischer's humility toward our big American ally? Where are Schroeder 
and Lafontaine's consideration and sensitivity toward their European 
partners? Where, in fact, is the feeling for history?'' The answer, 
perhaps, is that Germany's feeling for history has shifted with the 
arrival in power of a new generation that, as Schroeder has said, 
believes that the country should show ``the self-confidence of a nation 
that has come of age.'' In a sense, the government's directness is 
a refreshing liberation, a breath of fresh air for Germany's ponderous 
political culture. Young Germans, particularly, felt stifled in the 
latter years of Schroeder's predecessor, Helmut Kohl, and many are 
enthusiastic about the new government's freewheeling style. But the 
shock to the United States, and to European allies gathered Friday 
for a summit meeting in Vienna, has been palpable. ``What the government 
fails to realize is that when Germany raises questions about NATO 
strategy, people raise questions about Germany,'' said one Western 
official. ``They are begging us not to make too much of Fischer's 
remarks, but the fact is he is not building trust and he is causing 
irritation.'' Schroeder's ``Red-Green'' coalition of Social Democrats 
and Greens is still finding its feet, and there have been repeated 
indications of confusion in the coalition's ranks. The ministers' 
statements may be scattershot attempts to satisfy important party 
constituencies as much as coordinated government policy. Fischer, 
for example, is facing a Green Party congress in Leipzig this weekend, 
and his call for NATO to renounce the first use of nuclear weapons 
is certain to go down well there. ``Fischer warmed up a rather shallow 
green soup just enough to let it bubble through the weekend,'' said 
one government official, ``but the coalition does not want to push 
this idea with any lasting conviction.'' But whatever the follow-up 
to Fischer's stand, American officials are concerned that his call 
for a review of nuclear policy will prove a distraction as NATO grapples 
with other aspects of redefining its post-Cold War mission. There 
is also widespread concern in Western capitals that Schroeder appears 
unable or unready to assert his authority _ particularly over his 
bustling finance minister, Lafontaine _ and so give a single voice 
to the coalition. But the Social Democratic chancellor seems determined 
to support the various statements from his ministers. His consistent 
message has been that Germany should no longer bear any complexes. 
``Today,'' Schroeder said last month, ``we are democrats and Europeans, 
not because we have to be, but because we want to be.'' In a speech 
this week about Germany's place in Europe, though, he seemed to break 
startling new ground, adopting an almost Thatcherite tone as he lambasted 
the European Union for draining Germany's resources. ``We cannot and 
do not want to continue a policy that buys the good will of our neighbors 
with net payments that will become a burden to our country,'' Schroeder 
declared. ``We cannot solve Europe's problems with the German checkbook.'' 
His attack was focused on Germany's net contribution of $13.2 billion 
to the European Union budget, far more than those of other countries, 
many of which receive large net payments every year in the form of 
various subsidies. Why, Schroeder asked, should Germany pay when rich 
countries like Luxembourg, Denmark and Belgium receive money from 
the $100 billion European budget? The unspoken answer, for a long 
time, was precisely that Germany should buy the good will of its neighbors 
and consider that natural, because it had a historic debt to them 
and because the European Union provided Germans with an environment 
in which to grow rich again without appearing threatening. Several 
allies, including France, are certain to be troubled by Schroeder's 
words, even as another ally, Britain, has been angered by calls from 
Lafontaine for a harmonization of European tax levels to reflect the 
imminent introduction of a European currency, the euro. After a storm 
of protest in London, Lafontaine retreated a little, calling for the 
``coordination'' of taxes rather than their ``harmonization.'' Many 
in Britain see the latter term as a faint disguise for the imposition 
of uncompetitive tax levels by the European Union. But the German 
finance minister has stuck to calls for ``target zones'' for international 
currencies and for greater controls in what he has called the ``casino'' 
of international capitalism. American officials, in general, have 
not been pleased. Schroeder has offered measured support to Lafontaine, 
saying he would work during Germany's approaching presidency of the 
Group of Seven wealthy industrial nations for a ``financial architecture'' 
that ``should prevent entire economies being ruined by financial speculation.'' 
All this amounts to a marked change, but it was for change, after 
all, that Germans voted 10 weeks ago. In the same article that alluded 
to the ``strange sounds'' from Germany, Suddeutsche Zeitung applauded 
the government's readiness to confront problems long concealed behind 
``facades of harmony.'' But those facades, if that is what they were, 
also constituted central elements in Germany's relations with its 
allies. Nobody today believes that Germany is turning its back on 
America or the European Union. But an adjustment of those relationships 
appears to be under way, and it may eventually involve far-reaching 
shifts in the European and trans-Atlantic order.
