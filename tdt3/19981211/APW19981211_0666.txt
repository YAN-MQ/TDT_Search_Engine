Germany's highest court approved the extradition Friday to the United 
States of a suspected top aide to Osama Bin Laden, the Saudi millionaire 
accused of masterminding deadly bombings at U.S. embassies in Africa. 
The Federal Constitutional Court voted unanimously not to hear an 
appeal by Mamdouh Mahmud Salim, who argued the extradition violated 
his rights. The court called the appeal baseless. Extradition of suspects 
also requires federal government approval. Bernhard Boehm, spokesman 
for the Justice Ministry, said he expected a decision next week once 
the court papers are reviewed and the U.S. government gives its assurance 
that Salim will not face the death penalty. Germany's constitution 
forbids extradition if the suspect could face the death penalty _ 
but Boehm said he did not expect that would be the case for Salim. 
Salim, 40, has been held in Germany since his arrest in Bavaria three 
months ago on a U.S. warrant. A state court in Munich first approved 
his extradition on Nov. 27. U.S. officials claim he is Bin Laden's 
finance chief and have charged him in New York with murder conspiracy 
and use of weapons of mass destruction in an international plot to 
kill U.S. citizens. Three other alleged accomplices of Bin Laden already 
are jailed in the United States. The Aug. 7 bombings in Kenya and 
Tanzania killed 224 people, including 12 Americans.
