And we're rolling around to sports time. Once again, here's Ray Cougal. 
One of major league baseball's premier relief pitchers over the last 
two decades is retiring. Dennis Eckersly of the Boston Red Sox decided 
to end his 24-year career after Boston would not offer him the option 
of salary arbitration. The 44-year-old right-hander is third on the 
all time saves list with 390, and holds the American League record 
with 324 saves. Eckersly says leaving the game is tough. You know, 
when I look back over all the years, all I can say is that, you know, 
the only thing that comes to me, I was thinking on the way to the 
ballpark, is how much I love baseball and how much I'm going to miss 
it. Eckersly was considered baseball's most dominant closer from 1988 
until 1993 when he saved 256 games for the Oakland As. Eckersly won 
both the American League Sy Young and Most Valuable Player awards 
in 1992 when he saved a career high of 51 games for Oakland, going 
7-1 with a 1.9 earned run average. Eckersly also played for Cleveland, 
the Chicago Cubs and St. Louis.
