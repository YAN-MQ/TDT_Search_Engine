So what are people across the country thinking about the impeachment 
debate? A CNN/"USA today" Gallup poll of 550 adult Americans indicates 
most americans surveyed believe President Clinton committed the offenses 
mentioned in the proposed articles of impeachment. But the majority 
of those polled do not think the president should be impeached for 
committing those offenses. All interviews were conducted Thursday 
evening while the house Judiciary committee was still in session.
