NATIONAL FORECAST Despite high pressure near the nation's capital, 
clouds will spread across much of the middle Atlantic region on Saturday 
in advance of a disturbance moving through the Southeast. While low 
pressure forms along a front in the Gulf of Mexico, a jet-stream disturbance 
in Arkansas will send a veil of high and middle clouds from the southern 
Great Lakes to New Jersey. A chilly rain will advance from the lower 
Tennessee Valley to the west-central Appalachians. Dull, cool weather 
is expected in the Southeast with showers developing along the coast 
and in the mountains. More showers will dampen the Gulf states from 
Alabama to Louisiana. A few thunderstorms may form in mild air along 
the Gulf shores. Florida will be partly to mostly cloudy and rather 
humid. A tropical disturbance from the northwest Caribbean will trigger 
a few gusty showers along the west coast. Low clouds and drizzle will 
persist from the Ozarks to the Red River Valley. Fog will cover the 
western Gulf Coast as cool winds blow in from the north. High pressure 
cresting over the central Rockies will lead to some sun and warmer 
weather in the Plains. Gusty winds from the west will boost readings 
to near-record levels in eastern Montana and the western Dakotas, 
while cold air stays trapped in the valleys of Utah and Nevada. Rain 
and gales will resume in northwest Washington as a cold front approaches. 
Clouds and showers will spread into western Oregon and a surge of 
mild air will raise snow levels in the Cascades. Meanwhile, much of 
the Southwest will be bright and noticeably warmer. Focus: Snowless 
Syracuse Residents of Syracuse, N.Y., were forgetting what snow looked 
like. Finally, flakes fell on the city early Friday, accumulating 
0.2 inches. This marks the latest the city has gone into the winter 
season without snow. The unusually late start to the snow season comes 
after the earliest end to the previous snow season. The last time 
snow was measured in Syracuse, which boasts an average annual snowfall 
of 114 inches, was on March 23. Hence, the city sustained 263 consecutive 
days without snow, which is the longest stretch without snow since 
records began in 1902.
