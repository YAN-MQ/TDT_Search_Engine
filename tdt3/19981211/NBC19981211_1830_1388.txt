out half the world. Enterprise rent-A-car for my trip? Looks expensive. 
It's not expensive, mom. They pick us up?ppSOUNDS expensive. Pickup's 
free, mom. Well, if it's not expensive, why didn't I get a convertible? 
Pick enterprise: how are we gonna get all these kids to even look 
at each other? I think abby's afraid nobody's gonna ask her to dance. 
I think Brad is just afraid. hmm. Sometimes moms can use a little 
help. That's where sunny delight comes in. It's got the taste kids 
love... and vitamins you can feel good about. Um, aren't we in social 
studies together? I'd love to dance! Reach for the good stuff. With 
the dremel rotary tool system, you can create a sign, cut drywall, 
clean gunky faucets, reslot a stripped screw, add a drain hole, debarb 
a Fish hook, remove old grout and more. The dremel rotary tool. for 
more than 65 years, it's been the one tool to count on. Did I mention
