European leaders paid tribute Friday to Helmut Kohl, hailing the former 
German chancellor for the vision and commitment with which he guided 
Germany and Europe through years of historic and peaceful change. 
The leaders took a break from a year-end summit to declare Kohl, 68, 
an Honorary Citizen of Europe for managing Germany's painful unification 
in 1990 and anchoring it in the European Union. Moved to tears, Kohl 
thanked Europe's leaders for the tribute and injected a light note 
into the solemn event. ``I am not a monument yet,'' said Kohl. ``What 
happens when the party is over is that birds come and sit on you and 
do something and then other animals come and do something.'' The honor 
was awarded for only the second time. The first was in 1976 when it 
went to former French Foreign Minister Jean Monnet, a driving force 
for European integration in the 1950s. ``Helmut Kohl made a crucial 
contribution to the further development of Monnet's construction,'' 
Austrian Chancellor Viktor Klima said at a ceremony in the National 
Library, part of the spectacular former imperial Hofburg Palace in 
the heart of Vienna. ``He has often spoken of the opportunity for 
this generation of politicians to build a peaceful and stable Europe 
together,'' said Klima, the chairman of the summit that debated plans 
for the biggest expansion in the EU's history _ admitting a dozen 
newcomers in the next decade. Kohl was chancellor for 16 years. His 
last day in office was Oct. 26, a month after his Christian Democratic 
Party lost in general elections to the Social Democrats of his successor, 
Gerhard Schroeder. Kohl took office in 1982, when Germany and its 
western neighbors were locked in a Cold War debate about deploying 
ever more nuclear missiles aimed at the Soviet Union. When he left, 
the Berlin Wall had vanished, Germany had been reunited and the EU 
had agreed to issue a single currency. During the Kohl years, the 
EU twice enlarged its ranks, thrice rewrote its founding treaty and 
took the road to membership talks with Cyprus and 10 East European 
neighbors. These events bear the Kohl imprint, especially the euro 
that becomes legal tender in 11 of the 15 EU nations next month. If 
he failed anywhere, it was in pushing Germany's partners into a coherent 
political union. The consequences of that failure became visible in 
the Balkan wars and crises of recent years. As German leader, Kohl 
was at pains to present Germany as a trusted ally, committed to European 
integration. He showed himself to be an inveterate supporter of trans-Atlantic 
ties, who developed a close relationship with U.S. President Bill 
Clinton.
