The World Council of Churches said Friday 300,000 children are fighting 
in wars around the globe and appealed to African churches in particular 
to help end the recruitment of child soldiers. Most of the children 
engaged in armed conflicts were from poor or ``marginalized'' communities, 
said the group, which represents 450 million non-Catholic Christians 
from more than 300 churches. The WCC, which is holding a conference 
here, said many children were lawfully recruited but others were kidnapped 
or coerced into fighting in wars. Child soldiers fight or assist front-line 
fighters in most African conflicts. In a statement, the WCC appealed 
to churches to press their governments to ratify and enforce the African 
Charter on children's rights that prohibits children under 18 being 
recruited for military duties. The world council also asked churches 
to assist in the rehabilitation of child soldiers, especially young 
girls, traumatized by their experiences in national armies or irregular 
armed forces or rebel groups. Christian doctrine condemned war and 
sought the overall ``delegitimization of war and violence and...to 
overcome the spirit, logic and practice of war,'' the churches said. 
Children have fought in conflicts in Angola, Burundi, Congo, Liberia, 
Rwanda, Uganda, Sierra Leone, Somalia and Sudan in the past decade.
