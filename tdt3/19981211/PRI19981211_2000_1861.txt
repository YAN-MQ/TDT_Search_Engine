Germany's constitutional court has ruled Osama bin Laden, suspected 
finance chief, can be extradited to the United States to face charges 
of terrorism. A final decision on the fate of Mamdu Mahmoud Salim 
rests with the German government now. That decision is expected next 
week. Germany says Mr. Salim will only be handed over if Washington 
promises he won't face the death penalty.
