The government confirmed Friday that the adjusted unemployment rate 
for September was 4.5 percent, almost double June's 2.3 percent. The 
Manpower Ministry issued the final figures in its quarterly report, 
confirming preliminary figures given in late October by Minister Lee 
Boon Yang. The city-state of 3.1 million is suffering from one of 
its worst economic downturns in its history, and layoffs have risen 
to record levels. The number of workers fired in the first nine months 
of 1998 totaled 21,073 people, more than the 19,529 cut during Singapore's 
last economic recession in 1985, said the ministry. Layoffs would 
likely rise to between 25,000 and 30,000 by the end of the year, Permanent 
Secretary for Manpower Tan Chin Nam told reporters Friday. Currently, 
only three job openings are available for every 10 workers in Singapore, 
compared to an average 25 jobs for every 10 workers over the last 
four years. ``The outlook for employment is rather gloomy,'' said 
Tan.
