Austria's Alexandra Meissnitzer won her second World Cup race of the 
week on Friday, with a convincing victory in the women's giant slalom. 
After winning Thursday's super-G by a wide margin, the 25-year-old 
Austrian this time dominated the women's technical field, including 
Olympic champion Deborah Compagnoni and reigning World Cup champion 
Martina Ertl. Flying down the foggy, bumpy Piste-G course in a two-run 
combined time of 2 minutes, 17.34 seconds, Meissnitzer built up a 
massive .82 ahead of runner-up Compagnoni. Quickest down the opening 
run in 1:08.53, Meissnitzer's second-fastest time of 1:08.81 in the 
final leg was enough to secure her the win. It was the Austrian's 
fourth win of the season, her second in the giant slalom. Meissnitzer, 
who also won a pair of super-G races, has reinforced her lead at the 
top of the overall World Cup standings where she sits with 625 points. 
Compagnoni, who won four World Cup giant slalom races last year as 
well as the Olympic gold, has yet to win a race this season. The 28-year-old 
Italian finished third in the season-opening giant slalom in Soelden, 
Austria, her best result so far this year. In a successful comeback 
from injury, Austria's 31-year-old former World Cup overall champion 
Anita Wachter finished third. Wachter, whose career appeared to be 
over after a crash at the Olympics last season left her with severe 
knee injuries, crossed in an aggregate time of 2:18.31. Norway's Andrine 
Flemmen, who won the season-opener in Austria, finished fourth in 
2:18.59, ahead of France's Leila Piccard. Seventeenth after the first 
leg, Piccard delighted the home fans crowded at the foot of the course 
as she posted the fastest second-run. Blistering down in 1:08.48 for 
a total time of 2:18.62, Piccard held the lead until Flemmen beat 
her chrono. In her first season on the World Cup circuit, the 16-year-old 
Croatian sensation Janica Kostelic finished a respectable sixth, crossing 
in 2:18.73, a mere .01 ahead of Switzerland's Corinne Rey-Bellet. 
Second after the opening leg, Liechtenstien's Birgit Heeb squandered 
her chance for a first World Cup win, a cautious second run leaving 
her tied for eighth with Sweden's Anna Ottosson in 2:19.26. A costly 
mistake mid-way down the course threw reigning World Cup giant slalom 
champion Ertl off course.
