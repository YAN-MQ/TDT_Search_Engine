In other business news, Coca-Cola, the world's largest soft drink 
manufacturer, is about to get larger. THE WORLD's Liz George has details 
from our business desk in New York. Coca-Cola is buying part of Capri 
Schweppes soft drinks business for $1.85 billion. The deal includes 
brands like Dr. Pepper, Canada Dry, and Crush, but it excludes Schweppes 
operations in the U.S., France, and South Africa. Still, why does 
a giant like Coca-Cola need to buy anything more? George Thompson, 
beverage analyst with Prudential Securities, believes when you're 
so big within your core market, you've got to branch out. This company 
is now viewing themselves as being a beverage company as opposed to 
just a carbonated soft drink company. And by doing that and by including 
juice products as an example, they offer themselves a much wider market 
in which to sell their products in. Historically, when you've looked 
at Coca-Cola outside of the U.S. in particular, they had been very, 
very focused on the Coca-Cola brand. And I think now the management 
recognizes the fact that their volume could go well beyond that Coca-Cola 
brand and into other segments, in fact. But is now the right time 
for Coca-Cola to be on a spending spree? It's just issued a profits 
warning saying sales have been hit by the economic slump around the 
world. George Thompson believes this is a long-term buy. This is not 
something that's going to put them in any sort of financial jeopardy, 
not at all. The opportunity was there, and they took advantage of 
it, and it's a great long-term decision, and therein lies one of the 
real strong reasons, in my opinion, that Coca-Cola's likely to make 
a great investment. Eighty percent of Coca-Cola sales are generated 
outside the U.S. It's one of the world's best known and most dominant 
brands, operating in nearly 200 countries. This deal adds another 
600 million cases of drinks to a production line of 15 billion and 
their five percent increase in volume. For THE WORLD, I'm Liz George 
in New York.
