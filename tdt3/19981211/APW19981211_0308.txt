Spanish coast guards on Friday were searching the narrow stretch of 
the Mediterranean Sea that separates North Africa from Europe for 
30 missing would-be Moroccan immigrants, a spokesman said. The prospective 
illegal immigrants went missing Wednesday when the makeshift boat 
in which they were crammed went down because of bad weather, spokesman 
Francisco Cantizano said. A Turkish merchant ship spotted two of the 
passengers clinging to part of the wrecked boat and alerted the Spanish 
maritime authorities who picked up the two survivors who were suffering 
from hypothermia, Cantizano said. Rescue services have also recovered 
two bodies and held out little hope of finding more survivors, Cantizano 
said. Every year thousands of North Africans attempt the treacherous 
crossing over the Strait of Gibraltar seeking to slip unnoticed into 
Europe. Most travel in overcrowded single-motor boats, and many are 
believed to drown. Those seized during the trip or once they have 
arrived in Spain are repatriated.
