The Torray engineering company and Mitsubishi Corporation of Japan 
have jointly won a $1.2 billion order from China's largest petro chemical 
company to build two synthetic fiber plants in Central Hunan province. 
The project is part of China's National Petro Chemical Corporation's 
five year plan which began in 1996. The Japanese firms will supply 
the two synthetic fiber plants to a petro chemical complex in Luwayang.
