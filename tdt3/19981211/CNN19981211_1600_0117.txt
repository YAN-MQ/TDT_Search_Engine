This morning, committee members finished their opening statements. 
Some republicans, including Mary Bono of California, renewed calls 
for Mr. clinton to resign. Committee chairman Henry Hyde says Mr. 
Clinton's behavior cheapens the oath of the presidency and disputes 
arguments his actions don't rise to the level of a high crime or misdemeanor. 
Some democrats say that's nonsense. The private acts of William Jefferson 
Clinton, no matter how reprehensible, do not, do not constitute the 
intent of the framers by the above language which suggests acts to 
undermine or subvert the government. What we have here are not proven 
facts established like a court of law by the give and take of questioning 
witnesses to what happens through a Legally constituted jury that 
has handed down a guilty verdict. What we have are mere allegations 
brought to the Judiciary committee by what appears to be a determined 
independent counsel.
