On West 42nd Street, imaginary Greek gods and goddesses with names 
like Candora, Pectorus and Hernia are dancing and singing. In the 
East Village, conflicted young Jewish men named Steve and Nick are 
dancing, singing and praying that they can resolve their relationships 
with two non-Jewish women. Visits to the two shows in which these 
characters appear _ ``Delphi or Bust'' and ``Jews and Jesus'' _ give 
very different impressions of the current state of the original off-Broadway 
musical. The lamentable ``Delphi or Bust'' supports the contention 
that New York is filled with seriously talented performers who will 
do virtually anything to get on a stage, and that all the talented 
writers must be growing up and moving somewhere else. The lovable 
``Jews and Jesus'' is a reminder that terrific original work _ by 
composers, lyricists and performers alike _ often comes from a strong 
point of view and a willingness to take chances. Take one of the early 
scenes in ``Jews and Jesus,'' in which Steve (Kevin Merritt) meets 
a young woman on a bus, headed for a singles weekend in the Catskills. 
She asks what he does for a living. ``Real estate,'' says Steve. ``So 
you work for your father,'' she replies. ``No,'' he says. He takes 
a pause. ``We work together.'' And another pause. ``For his father.'' 
Merritt has great timing. So do the show's director, Anthony Patellis, 
Sean Power (who plays Nick, a rabbinical student living in Israel 
and struggling against the temptation of premarital sex) and just 
about everybody connected with this production. Teddy Coluca and Mary 
Ann Conk, in multiple ``older person'' roles, are great. But then 
Oren Safdie, who wrote ``Jews and Jesus,'' and Ronnie Cohen, who wrote 
the music and lyrics, have given the cast a lot of great irreverent 
material to work with. The important word here is ``irreverent.'' 
``Jews and Jesus'' is no serious examination of Jewish-Christian intermarriage 
or of religious beliefs. Several of the characters, in fact, are practically 
atheists. ``It has nothing to do with God,'' Steve says of his Jewishness. 
``It's tribal.'' The show poses musical questions like ``The Messiah: 
Would he eat a ham and cheese?'' and refers to King David's ``rolls 
in the hay.'' It challenges the belief that tradition can be recaptured 
``by wearing a black suit in a desert.'' It even has the nerve to 
question Israel's safety as a vacation destination (including the 
lyric ``Come to Israel: You'd better say your prayers''). ``Delphi 
or Bust,'' on the other hand, has nothing to challenge. It has an 
impressive cast with strong voices and lots of energy, but they're 
saddled with a silly plot and decidedly lame humor. The show is entirely 
in rhyme, much of it simple-minded. One character, poisoned, says: 
``I have such cramps. You tramps.'' Another example: ``You pass. Fair 
lass.'' The story is about three women who are candidates for the 
job of the new oracle at Delphi. They are Candora (Tia Riebling), 
who seems to be dressed as a chicken, perhaps because her mother was 
seduced by Zeus when he was disguised as an owl; Nebula (Jill Geddes), 
who looks strangely like a leprechaun, and Zircony (Colleen Hawks), 
a Jayne Mansfield look-alike whose only real talent seems to be screaming. 
John Simeone as Asphodel (Narcissus' more self-involved brother) manages 
to overcome the script and make his constant mirror-gazing entertaining. 
And Darren Lee Frazier as Cy the Cyclops turns ``Even if I'm Not Your 
Type'' into the only moving song in the production. (Other numbers 
include ``We Greeks Have a Myth for It All'' and ``Fate Can Be Funny.'') 
But then all the cast members may have noteworthy performances in 
them; they just aren't going to happen in this show. ``Jews and Jesus'' 
continues at La Mama E.T.C. through Dec. 23. ``Delphi or Bust'' continues 
at the Theater Row Theater, Wednesdays through Sundays, through Dec.
