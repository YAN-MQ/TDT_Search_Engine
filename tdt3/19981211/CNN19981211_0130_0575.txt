The Supreme Court has delayed an execution scheduled in Texas Thursday 
night. The high court says it needs more time to consider a Canadian 
man's claim that his rights were violated under international law. 
Joseph faulder was convicted of murdering a Texas woman in 1975. Faulder 
says he was not told of his right to contact the Canadian consulate 
when he was arrested. Another execution date can't be scheduled for 
at least 30 days.
