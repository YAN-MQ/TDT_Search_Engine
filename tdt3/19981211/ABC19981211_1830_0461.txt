So, let's go to the country now. The majority of Americans, as the 
polls continue to indicate, do not want to see the president impeached, 
even while they agree that he is guilty of perjury and obstructing 
justice and abusing his power. Whatever it is, many people's minds, 
as of this week, are simply elsewhere. Here is ABC's dean Reynolds. 
Debate will resume shortly on four articles of impeachment against 
the president. Dramatic words, to be sure, but across the country, 
they seem to be having a less-than-dramatic effect. Congress is about 
to vote on the impeachment of the president of the United States. 
Is this an important matter to you? No, it's not. Why not? We have 
other important things going on in the world besides this. In interviews 
from New York to California and places in between, there seemed to 
be more impatience with the babbling pundits and the squabbling congressmen 
than outrage over the president's actions. It's like two little kids 
in a playground and mom hasn't broken it up yet. I think it's a total 
waste of the government's time and of the taxpayers' money. why? Because 
there are a lot of other things that are going on that the money needs 
to be spent on, in my opinion, mostly education. Many people say they 
have simply tuned out, even now as the process nears a finish. It's 
over. It's done. He's apologized and it's time to move on. Some said 
they were not interested in the proceedings because they believe there 
is no chance that the Senate would actually vote to remove the president 
from office. To be sure, there are those who believe the president 
should go. You have to uphold the rule of law or we'll be in chaos. 
If the president was impeached, I would take it as a good sign that 
not all the moral fiber in this country has completely degenerated. 
Those views may be in the majority in the House of Representatives, 
but apparently not so in the households of most Americans. And so 
as the impeachment train moves along, most of the public, it seems, 
is not on board. Dean Reynolds, ABC News, Chicago.
