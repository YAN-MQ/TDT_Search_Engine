The House Judiciary Committee has voted to recommend the impeachment 
of President Clinton on charges of perjury. The vote came only minutes 
after the president again publicly expressed his remorse about his 
behavior in the Monica Lewinsky affair. THE WORLD's Emily Harris reports 
from Washington. President Clinton said he is profoundly sorry for, 
quote, "All he's done wrong in words and deeds." He said he is ready 
to accept rebuke and censure from Congress. He did not comment on 
his reaction if he were to impeached. Moments later, the House Judiciary 
Committee passed along party lines the first of four possible impeachment 
articles. It accuses Clinton of committing perjury in his August testimony 
before Ken Starr's grand jury. Prior to votes, committee Democrats 
had argued that the accusation was too vague. They wanted to amend 
the article to include the specific statements Republicans claim constitute 
perjury. For THE WORLD, I'm Emily Harris in Washington.
