Julio A. Bofill, 42, owner of Infinity Photo Studio in Manhattan, 
began studying photography a few years ago at LaGuardia Community 
College in New York City. The experience, he says, ``turned my whole 
life around.'' When he entered LaGuardia, he said, it was as part 
of a work-release program after serving five years in prison for drug 
possession. Because the college has a mandatory cooperative education 
program that requires students to gain experience in jobs related 
to their studies, Bofill began taking pictures for the school during 
special functions. The co-op work confirmed his career choice, put 
a job on his resume and helped pay for photography supplies he needed 
after transferring to New York University, where he earned a degree 
in studio art. To be sure, not everyone's experience with cooperative 
education is so dramatic. But even a negative experience can have 
long-term benefits. Another former LaGuardia student, Ximena Grimaldi, 
26, wanted to become an occupational therapist. But when she got a 
job assisting therapists, she found working with injured people emotionally 
draining. ``It was heartbreaking,'' she said. ``I decided I wanted 
to stay in the medical field, but in a slightly different environment.'' 
Now she plans to become a registered dietitian. Co-op programs help 
college students figure out what to study and give them experience 
that can lead to better jobs and higher salaries after graduation 
than they might receive otherwise. And they earn income to help with 
college costs. Annual tuition, fees and room and board during the 
1998-99 academic year averaged $22,533 at four-year private institutions 
and $10,458 at four-year public institutions, according to the College 
Board's Annual Survey of Colleges. Tuition averaged $7,333 at private 
two-year colleges and $1,633 at public two-year colleges. A participant 
in a co-op program can typically earn $2,500 to $14,000 a year, according 
to the National Commission for Cooperative Education, based in Boston.

Students may find financial aid pared as they earn the extra money, 
but the income is theirs to manage. ``Earnings go directly to students, 
who can use it for anything they want,'' said Gary Hamme, a dean at 
Drexel University in Philadelphia. Georgia Tetlow, 26, a pre-med major 
at Antioch College in Ohio, had a co-op job at the National Institutes 
of Health in Washington, where she trained monkeys that were being 
used in learning and memory experiments. ``I saved enough to buy my 
own car,'' she said. Antioch is one of the few liberal arts schools 
with a co-op education requirement. Co-op programs are different from 
the work-study jobs provided with federal aid, which may have little 
to do with a student's studies, and from internships, which may be 
related to career choices but are often unpaid. Many schools have 
found co-op programs to be a big draw. LaGuardia, the first community 
college in the country to require co-op education, opened with 500 
students in 1971. It now has 10,000 students in degree programs and 
an additional 25,000 in continuing education programs, said Harry 
Heinemann, its dean in charge of cooperative education. Drexel, which 
also requires students to do co-op work, saw its freshman class jump 
from 950 in 1995 to 2,100 this year. A survey of the entering class 
found that 95 percent enrolled because of the co-op program, Hamme 
said. About 900 colleges and universities now offer co-op programs, 
and about 200,000 students are participating in them this year, according 
to the cooperative education commission. Co-op programs are either 
``alternating,'' in which students work full-time and then go to school 
full-time, or ``parallel,'' in which students work part-time while 
going to school. Participants usually earn bachelor's degrees in four 
or five years. Students typically must apply and interview for the 
co-op jobs. In some cases, they integrate work experience with classroom 
studies by completing work-related academic projects or writing reports. 
``A lot of my friends at other colleges are very worried about getting 
a job after they graduate,'' said Jennifer Strausser, 21, a junior 
and computer science major at Drexel. She has worked in co-op jobs 
at an Internet development company and an insurance company. ``I feel 
I have a real leg up,'' she said. Employers are also enthusiastic. 
The Cigna Corp. in Philadelphia hires about 50 Drexel students each 
year, and about 10 return to Cigna full-time after graduation. ``This 
is a good opportunity to get students into our organization early,'' 
said Joseph Braunstein, a senior vice president at Cigna Group Insurance. 
His experience with co-op programs is personal as well as professional. 
He began working at Cigna 27 years ago as a Drexel co-op student and 
never left.
