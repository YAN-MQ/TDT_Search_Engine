Chile's former military leader, General Augusto Pinochet, has issued 
a defiant statement. He says he'll refuse to recognize the jurisdiction 
of any court outside his own country to try him for alleged human 
rights crimes. Earlier General Pinochet appeared in court in London 
for the first time since his arrest. The appearance marks the beginning 
of formal hearings to extradite the former dictator to Spain. The 
BBC's Joshua Rosenberg reports from the courthouse. Even sitting in 
his wheelchair, General Pinochet had a military bearing. He was clearly 
in command. Asked for must his name, he told the magistrate he was 
Augusto Pinochet Ugarte, commander in chief of the army, captain general 
of Chile, president of the Republic, and now senator of the Republic. 
He told the magistrate, "With respect to Your Honor, I do not recognize 
the jurisdiction of any other court except in my country to try me 
against all the lies of Spain." His lawyers maintained he was only 
challenging the powers of the court to try him, not to extradite him, 
but that was not how it sounded to those of us in court. Joshua Rosenberg 
reporting.
