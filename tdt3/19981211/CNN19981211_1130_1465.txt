United airlines made the wishes of some children come true this holiday 
season. The airline took more than 230 children on an imaginary flight 
from Miami to the North Pole to meet Santa claus. The children and 
their families boarded a plane that stayed parked on the runway. They 
played and Sang Christmas carols with Santa and a group of clowns 
and elves.
