In a diplomatic swipe at Britain for its detention of the former Chilean 
dictator, Gen. Augusto Pinochet, the Chilean government moved Friday 
to suspend all flights between Chile and the Falkland Islands, cutting 
off commercial air links between the British colony and the outside 
world. The initiative fell well short of breaking relations with London, 
as some senior members of the armed forces have advised the government 
of President Eduardo Frei to do. But senior government officials said 
the action was intended to force Britain into the embarrassing position 
of having to consider asking Argentina to begin flights with the islands. 
The measure is also intended to show appreciation to Argentina, which 
lost the 1982 Falkland war to Britain, for its support of Chile's 
claim that Britain has no right to hold Pinochet for possible extradition 
to Spain to stand trial for murder, torture and other human rights 
violations. Currently, the only commercial flights to the Falklands 
leave once a week from the southern Chilean city of Puntarenas. Chile 
is also the base for daily supply flights to the islands. Argentina, 
which continues to claim sovereignty over the islands, has been pressing 
London to resume Argentine air links with the Falklands for years. 
``We're trying to look for measures to show that we have been hurt, 
but we don't want to permanently damage relations with Great Britain,'' 
said John Biehl del Rio, Frei's chief of staff. But in a veiled threat 
that stronger diplomatic measures, including an ultimate break, could 
come, Biehl added, ``If this lasts too long, you never know how this 
will end.'' Foreign Minister Jose Miguel Insulza announced Friday 
that the government was suspending all diplomatic contacts with Britain 
and Spain. On Wednesday Chile recalled its ambassador to London to 
protest the decision by Home Secretary Jack Straw to allow extradition 
hearings to move forward. Insulza also said the government would begin 
pressing private carriers to cease flying to the Falklands. Officials 
said Lan Chile, the dominant Chilean carrier, agreed on Thursday night 
to suspend flights to the Falklands. Smaller charter lines will be 
pressed to follow suit, officials said, and no resistance is expected. 
``It became impossible for us to keep our flights going there,'' Biehl 
said. ``The British will have to rely on Argentine planes, and they 
will hate that.'' Frei's decision is designed to show his government's 
dismay with the British government for moving forward with extradition 
hearings and to reassure the Chilean military that it is trying to 
defend Pinochet as strongly as possible. Officials said the president 
made the decision on Thursday night in preparations for a meeting 
with top military commanders Friday. At the same time, with the Chilean 
economy slowing, officials said Frei did not want to jeopardize economic 
relations with Britain. Britain is the third leading source of foreign 
investment here. It is also a leading provider of military equipment 
to Chile, especially ships for the navy.
