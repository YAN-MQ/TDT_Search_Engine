Tropical storm Faith swept across the central Philippines Friday before 
moving out over the South China Sea, the Manila weather bureau said. 
At least two persons were reported dead in the central island of Iloilo, 
but there have been no report of damage so far. At 5 p.m. (0800 GMT), 
the storm was packing sustained winds of 105 kilometers (66 miles) 
per hour and gusts of up to 135 kilometers (84 miles) per hour, the 
Atmospheric, Geophysical and Astronomical Services said. It was moving 
west southwest at 26 kilometers (16 miles) per hour towards Vietnam, 
the bureau said. Residents of coastal areas in the central Philippines 
have been advised to move to safer grounds due to the possibility 
of flooding. Signal No. 3, the country's second highest storm alert, 
was issued in several islands near the storm's center. The 11th large 
storm to hit the country this year was carrying typhoon-strength winds 
late Thursday when it came ashore near Borongan town on Samar island. 
It weakened as it sliced through islands in the central Philippines. 
It is expected to reintensify back to typhoon-strength now that it's 
back over open sea.
