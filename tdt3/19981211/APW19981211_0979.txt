Nicaragua has filed suit against U.S. tobacco companies in federal 
court, modeled after the lawsuit filed by U.S. state attorneys general. 
The suit, filed Thursday in the U.S. District Court in the U.S. commonwealth 
of Puerto Rico, names several cigarette companies including Philip 
Morris, Liggett Group and British American Tobacco. Guatemala, represented 
by the same Houston law firm that represents Nicaragua, has filed 
a similar suit and a Brazilian official said Thursday his country 
is also considering legal action. ``This is very similar to cases 
filed by the U.S. attorneys general and we anticipate using a number 
of documents used throughout the United States in (related) litigation 
matters and many of the witnesses we anticipate using at trial are 
in U.S. jurisdiction,'' said lawyer D'Lisa Simmons of the Houston-based 
law firm of Fleming, Hovenkamp and Grayson, which is representing 
Nicaragua and Guatemala. Simmons said the lawsuit did not seek a specific 
amount because Nicaraguan officials were still working on an estimate 
of how much the Central American country has spent on treating smoking-related 
illnesses. The suit filed in May for Guatemala in Washington, D.C., 
seeks about dlrs 300 million. In Brazil, a health ministry official 
said Thursday that his country was also consulting with lawyers about 
filing a suit in U.S. federal court. Brazil's National Institute of 
Cancer says the South American country has approximately 31 million 
smokers, or 33 percent of the population over age 15. The institute 
estimates that smoking kills 80,000 people each year and is responsible 
for 90 percent of lung cancer deaths. Last month 46 states agreed 
to a dlrs 206 billion settlement with the tobacco industry over health 
claims. The settlement ended a suit filed by attorneys general for 
several of the 50 U.S. states.
