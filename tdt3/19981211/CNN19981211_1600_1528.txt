Being a frequent flyer used to mean simply saving points for free 
flights. But as Stephanie Oswald reports, the new goal for many travelers 
is to earn something called elite status. How many flights have you 
flown this year? I've got a ways to go to become one of the elite 
members. There's still time to qualify, or requalify, for "elite" 
status in your airline's frequent flier program. The airlines these 
days are really paying attention to people who can prove that they 
are indeed frequent travelers, taking in excess of ten trips per year. 
It's not the miles elite Flyers are after, it's the perks. Preferred 
check-in and boarding. Priority upgrades, bonus miles. Privileges 
like airport club lounges and things like that are one of the ways 
that just makes travel so much easier. In order to stay elite you 
need to hop on a plane. I'm like that much being a two million-miler. 
Miles earned by using charge cards or certain phone companies, or 
through hotel stays and car rentals won't get you there. Qualifying 
miles come only from actual miles, or segments flown. Depending on 
the airline, you'll need a minimum of 25,000 miles, or 30 flight segments, 
earned within a calendar year. It's not unusual for elite fliers to 
get on a plane, go to a neighboring city, never get off, never leave 
the airport and just come right back. Just to accumulate the miles 
they need. And some fliers break up nonstop trips into connecting 
flights to get more segments. All to stay elite. Stephanie Oswald, 
CNN, reporting.
