As if it's not stressful enough that people are judged by their looks, 
their jobs and their addresses and even where their children go to 
school, with the holidays approaching there is one more item to add 
to the list: Christmas and Hanukkah cards. What you send, when you 
send it, even what stamp you use _ all have a dispiriting tendency 
to come under scrutiny. Do you enclose a family picture? How about 
a letter boasting of your year's events? Whatever choices you make, 
understand that the ritual of keeping in touch at year's end has become 
competitive, one more measure by which acquaintances and even friends 
and family will measure your status. ``Here's a picture of my brother 
and his tacky new wife,'' one Manhattan businessman said about the 
card sent by a middle-aged sibling and his second wife, who was wearing 
angel wings. Not wanting to cause a family uprising, he spoke on condition 
of anonymity. He added: ``They think they're social. They look ridiculous.'' 
Taylor Stein, a real estate agent in her late 20s who lives on the 
Upper East Side, was addressing her cards last Thursday night. ``I'm 
getting a stomachache over sending them out,'' she said. ``I am so 
nervous about what people will think.'' Ms. Stein's card has a picture 
of herself dressed as Hillary Rodham Clinton on it. ``I wanted to 
be Pamela Anderson, but my father wanted me to change my image,'' 
she said. At Smythson of Bond Street, which supplies stationery to 
the British royal family, and to well-heeled New Yorkers from its 
showroom on Third Avenue near 29th Street, customers typically agonize 
for as long as three hours in choosing among the very simple engraved 
cards. The cards, recognizable by the Smythson name embossed on the 
left shoulder of the envelope, start at $385 for a box of 100. In 
the 1984 edition of her etiquette book, Emily Post said that engraved 
Christmas cards should be sent only by people who are prominent in 
public life (Jacqueline Kennedy Onassis favored Smythson writing paper). 
But now their appeal has spread widely. ``It's definitely the busiest 
season we've ever had,'' said Ann Patron, Smythson's president in 
the United States. ``People are ordering more cards than before and 
asking for traditional Christmas cards with a Santa Claus or wreath. 
People who ordered 150 last year ordered 400.'' She speculated that 
her clients were sending expensive cards instead of gifts, which would 
fit in with an overall trend in holiday spending: in a nerve-racking 
year for the stock market, consumers are looking for the aura of luxury 
without paying too high a price. Similarly, engraved cards at $3 to 
$4.50 apiece are selling out at Tiffany and Cartier, spokeswomen for 
the stores say. But those tempted to indulge might want to remember 
that the first thing many recipients will do is to peruse the cards 
to see if they come from William Arthur or Mrs. John L. Strong, the 
old-line stationers that were once purveyors to ``the 400.'' ``I think 
engraved stationery is beautiful if it comes to you naturally and 
you were born and raised with it,'' said Marjorie Gubelmann, a venture 
capitalist, who was (she divides her time between Palm Beach and New 
York). ``But if you're doing it to one-up the Joneses, it's not appropriate.'' 
In Palm Beach, one custom is to send cards with a picture of oneself 
standing in front of the tree pasted on the front. ``It's all to show 
their latest face lift and how young they look at 75,'' Ms. Gubelmann 
said. Another custom of the natives: engraving on the cards the names 
of their pets _ ``Bugsy, Boo-Boo and Bebe,'' as Ms. Gubelmann put 
it. Among many families, particularly in the suburbs, the custom is 
to send pictures of children (but not adults) in a card with a cutout 
frame or on cards supplied by a photo processor. But even that simple 
ritual has become competitive. Lately, studied casualness seems to 
be in vogue, using unposed pictures of the children on vacation, for 
example. The beach on Nantucket is big this year, the message being 
``We're not pretentious, but we do take a nice family vacation.'' 
Courtenay Khoury, who lives in Darien, Conn., and sends out 150 cards 
with unposed pictures of her two children, Virginia and Philip, says 
she doesn't take the ritual too seriously. ``It's a chance to keep 
in touch with those people you never talk to,'' she said. ``You send 
a few words. It's like it keeps you up to date. You're still alive, 
and this is what the children look like.'' But for some of her neighbors, 
there may be more at stake, and black-and-white, not color, photos 
are in vogue: ``Some think that just shows you're a cut above the 
standard colored picture. It gives it an artsy twist. When I receive 
a black-and-white from someone, I say, `Uh oh, they switched over.''' 
But for Dr. Leonard LaManna and his wife, Renee, who live in Bay Ridge, 
Brooklyn, and who sent a black-and-white photo of their two children, 
they simply thought the old-fashioned picture looked better than a 
color version, and they wanted their card to be different from everyone 
else's. Whether it's a photograph or simply a card, it's all big business 
and getting bigger. Americans will send 2.6 billion cards this holiday 
season, a number that is up significantly from last year, said Marianne 
McDermott, the executive vice president of the Greeting Card Association, 
a trade group in Washington. If the average card costs $2, the total 
spent on holiday cards is about $5.2 million, the association says. 
``We've added more types of cards, and more and more ethnic cards 
are appearing like Kwanzaa,'' she said. Another possible explanation 
is that card buyers are warming up for the millennium, sure to be 
a bonanza for card-sending. At Kate's Paperie in SoHo, a sellout this 
year was a card that reads like a mathematical equation: ``2000 - 
1 (EQ) 1999.'' And at Kate's three branches in Manhattan, ``sales 
are up 30 percent from last year,'' Violet Brandwein, the merchandise 
manager, said, adding, ``It's unbelievable.'' For Joan Scribner, a 
professional ice skater in her 70s, whose late husband, Charles Scribner 
Jr., used to run the Scribner publishing house, Christmas still makes 
her feel like a little girl. Mrs. Scribner, who plans to skate in 
the Holiday on the Hudson ice show this month at Chelsea Piers, sends 
out 200 cards every year. Her only prerequisite: The cards must have 
an ice skater on the front. Where does she get them? Hallmark.
