Rescue workers found the bodies of three mountain climbers, and were 
still searching for a fourth, who went missing in an avalanche in 
central Macedonia, police said Friday. The four Macedonians were training 
for a Himalayan expedition, when they disappeared in a blizzard last 
Sunday on Mount Jakupica, 2,540 meters (8333 feet), near the town 
of Veles. After an extensive helicopter search, the bodies of Ognjen 
Filipovski, 38, Vlatko Gocevski, 31, and Branislav Kistovski, 38, 
were found buried under deep snow. The search for Predrag Tomasev, 
19, was continuing despite heavy snow, but he is also feared dead, 
police said. All four were experienced mountain climbers.
