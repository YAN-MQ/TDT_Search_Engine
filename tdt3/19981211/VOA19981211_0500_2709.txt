On Tuesday, AT&T, a major provider of long-distance telephone service 
in the United States, announced plans to purchase a global data network 
belonging to computer manufacturer IBM. The deal, which will cost 
approximately $5 billion, includes IBMs Internet service which is 
more than a million individual subscribers in 59 countries, and serves 
more than 30,000 medium and large businesses around the world. Lewis 
Kirschner, Jr., IBM's chief executive officer, says that his company, 
which supplies hardware and software to several telecommunications 
companies, including AT&T, does not want to compete with its customers. 
C. Michael Armstrong, head of AT&T, says that the purchase is another 
important step in his company's strategy to expand from being a national 
to becoming a global communications leader. The deal is expected to 
be completed some time next year.
