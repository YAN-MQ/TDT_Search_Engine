Thursday, a Russian cosmonaut joined the crew of space shuttle "endeavour" 
as the first guests aboard the international space station. Miles 
O'Brien has the story. At the threshold of a new era, shuttle commander 
Bob cabana and russian cosmonaut Sergei krikalev popped the Hatch 
and simultaneously floated into the infant international space station. 
It's really outstanding hardware. It's just so nice inside. It's really 
nice to be in a new home. It will be home for krikalev. He is a member 
of the first full-time crew to live aboard the space station, beginning 
in January of 2000. This first visit was about more than platitudes, 
pats on the back and ear-to-ear grins. The six-member crew of "endeavour" 
brought tools, parts and checklists along with them. They spent the 
day installing electronics, removing bracing bolts, activating systems 
and installing ductwork. As busy as they were, they took time to pause 
and savor the moment. We just can't wait to see the outcome of what 
we started. It started with the joining of the U.S.-built unity connecting 
module to the Russian power plant called zarya, or "sunrise." NASA, 
the Russian space agency and 14 other nations are hoping their orbiting 
outpost will look like this in about five years. To assemble the $60 
billion sprawling structure in low-earth orbit, it will take at least 
43 more successful launches and 160 space walks. Nothing like this 
has ever been attempted, but after years of political wrangling and 
international intrigue over funding the international space station, 
NASA managers here may wonder if working effectively in space is the 
easy part. Miles O'Brien, CNN, at the Johnson space center, Houston.
