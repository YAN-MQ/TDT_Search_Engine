The president's future in the house is in the hands of a small collection 
of moderate republicans. And for this most important vote of their 
careers, they're keeping their own counsel. NBC's Tim russert, our 
Washington bureau chief and moderator of "meet the press." Tim, what's 
the latest count? The president needs 14 republican votes to hold 
on impeachment. Only 5 have publicly said they would vote no on impeachment. 
There are three cards left to play. The Clinton card. Will the president 
go father and finally say he lied under oath? That would help. The 
censure card. Can the White House build public opinion to force the 
republican leadership to allow a vote of censure along with impeachment 
next Thursday? That would give some republican moderates the out they 
want. A safe vote for censure and then vote no on impeachment. Third, 
the Henry Hyde card. Will Henry Hyde play a passive role after he 
gets done chairing these hearings or he will he become a lobbyist 
for the impeachment of the president? He has enormous influence with 
these moderate republicans. If Henry Hyde decides to push hard for 
impeachment, it's very bad news for the president. Thanks very much, 
Tim Russ ert tonight. Washington bureau chief for NBC news.
