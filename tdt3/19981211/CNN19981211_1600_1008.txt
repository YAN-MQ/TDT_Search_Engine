The nation's biggest soft drinkmaker loses some of its fizz. I'm Jan 
Hopkins in New York with this edition of "Dollars & Sense." Coca-Cola 
warns that its earnings will fall short of Wall Street expectations. 
The company blaming economic volatility around the world for those 
lower expectations. Despite bottom-line woes, Coke went on a buying 
spree, the company spending nearly $2 billion to buy cadbury schweppes 
soft drink brands in more than 120 countries, but not including the 
U.S. the deal covers schweppes and canada dry mixers, as well as Dr. 
pepper and crush soft drinks. It should also be an important step 
in cadbury's goal to gain a more secure distribution system for its 
soft drinks.
