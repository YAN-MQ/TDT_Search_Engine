Isolated in the high Rocky mountains, this elegant old mining town 
of 600 people stands only a mile from its sister village of Black 
Hawk, population 150. But, in this old gold rush landscape, modern 
greed over gambling is plunging the two villages into a municipal 
feud worthy of the Hatfields and the McCoys. The rivalry between the 
two villages dates back a century or more, when workers from Black 
Hawk's sulphurous smelters were encouraged to take a bath and change 
their clothes before coming up to Central City. When flush toilets 
came to the finer homes here, Central City residents knew where the 
waste went when they pulled the chain _ downstream toward Black Hawk. 
And because of the deforestation around the Central City's gold mines, 
floods routinely swept down Clear Creek canyon, covering Black Hawk's 
streets with mud and rocks. But ever since limited stakes gambling 
started here and in Black Hawk in 1991, Central City, which once billed 
itself as ``The Richest Square Mile on Earth'' is not so central anymore. 
Gamblers who make the 45-minute drive on a winding canyon road from 
Denver to play slot machines reach Black Hawk first. ``Gamblers are 
basically lazy,'' fumed Gary Kragenbrink, who served as a councilman 
in Central City. ``I bet Black Hawk is really enjoying sticking it 
to Central now.'' To cut Black Hawk out of some of the gambling action, 
Central City started buying and annexing land in a daring plan to 
extend an eight mile city ``street'' across some of the roughest mountain 
terrain in America. This $64 million, four-lane ``street'' would drop 
gamblers directly at an interchange for Interstate 70. In a counter 
attack, Black Hawk unveiled blueprints for its own secret weapon: 
a $50 million tunnel punched through solid granite. Funded by casinos, 
this four-lane tunnel would speed gamblers 1.3 miles through a mountain, 
depositing them on a road leading to Black Hawk's busy gambling halls. 
Undeterred, Central City unveiled maps last month that showed it planned 
to annex land to block Black Hawk from building a cutoff to their 
planned road. In response, Black Hawk revealed that they had secretly 
paid an 85-year-old widow $50,000 to buy mining rights along the route 
of Central City's proposed casino road. ``We've got a big bag of tacks, 
and I have just just taken out a handful and spread them out on their 
road,'' chortled Medill Barnes, executive director of the Black Hawk 
Casino Owners Association. ``This is war, nuclear war.''
