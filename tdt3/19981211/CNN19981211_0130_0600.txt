The man who offered Paula Jones $1 million to settle her sexual harassment 
suit against President Clinton has been released from jail on his 
own recognizance. Police accuse abe hirschfeld of hiring a hit man 
to kill a former business partner. Tony Guida has the story. Nothing 
about abe hirschfeld surprises people who know him, not even the charge 
he paid to have a former business partner killed. A charge, not surprisingly, 
the 79-year-old New York City tycoon shrugs off. I never hired nobody 
to kill him. And I never tried to kill him. And killing him gives 
me no benefit at all because if he kills me, my family gets the money. 
If I kill him, his family gets the money. I don't get one penny benefit 
by killing him. Hirschfeld is currently under indictment for state 
tax fraud. The comedian Jackie Mason is suing him for falsely promising 
Mason would appear at a New York club. Hirschfeld, who made millions 
from New York City parking lots, real estate and health clubs, burst 
onto the national stage when he offered paula Jones $1 million to 
settle her lawsuit against President Clinton. The offer was withdrawn. 
Now another headline -- hirschfeld is accused of making a $75,000 
down payment on a contract hit against his real estate investment 
partner of 40 years. The two men had a falling out over several properties 
they owned. Hirschfeld says it's a frame. Every charge is a falsified 
lie. Neither the charge nor hirschfeld's version of the story surprise 
"New York post" columnist Jack Newfield. But one thing about this 
case does. And the only thing that surprises me in this whole new 
development is that one of abe's partners didn't shoot him first. 
In court, hirschfeld, ever the showman, pulled out the million-dollar 
check he made out to Paula Jones and offered to post his bond with 
it. The judge shook her head and released hirschfeld anyway on the 
promise he will pay up by Monday. Tony Guida, "CNN Financial News,"
