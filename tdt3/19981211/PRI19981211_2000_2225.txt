For this Friday's Geography Quiz, we're going to head to Europe, or 
to be more precise, the region some have dubbed Mittel Europa, or 
Middle Europe. Now we're going to need a boat because we're taking 
a long journey down a river, Europe's longest river, which wends its 
way through eight countries before it dumps into the Black Sea. We'll 
pass through several capital cities, Bratislava in the Slovak Republic, 
Belgrade in Serbia, Budapest in Hungary, and Vienna in Austria. This 
river starts its journey in Germany where it's known as the Donau, 
but the Hungarians know it as Aduna. There's also a famous waltz named 
after this river, but, well, we can't tell you its title because that 
would give it away, two, three, four. So, what's the English name 
of this river? Stay afloat. Just a few more minutes and we'll give 
you the answer.
