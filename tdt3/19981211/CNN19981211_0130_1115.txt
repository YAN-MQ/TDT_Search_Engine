Tiger and company and hitting the links "down under." President's 
cup results, next in "CNN Headline Sports." And later -- the inside 
scoop on Burt Reynolds' latest project. Another nokia discovery: small 
words are hard to read. Which is why at nokia we makes wireless phones 
with screens that are... big. So they're easier to read. Inspired 
technology with a human touch. Keep it going. O.K., that's enough. 
Bayer can relieve joint inflammation and stiffness. Tylenol can't. 
and taken regularly, Bayer can help save your life. Ask your doctor. 
Duane Walker, "CNN Headline Sports."
