It has the trappings of a memorable game, one of the most memorable 
in the long history between the New York Jets and the Miami Dolphins. 
Yet, Jets coach Bill Parcells is concerned that an itty-bitty play, 
a turnover, a miscalculation, will end up leading to either victory 
or defeat in the first-place battle between these two teams Sunday 
night in Miami. Here was his statistic for the week that he shared 
with his players: in the last seven meetings between the Jets and 
Dolphins, the team that won the turnover battle won the game as well. 
To make sure they are sharp and aggressive _ and knowing that they 
have a game on the road against Buffalo only five days after returning 
from Miami _ Parcells put his upwardly mobile Jets through a final 
practice Friday without pads. He had had them practice in the body 
armor at least two days a week for the last month. This week, though, 
it was practically sleep-away camp by Parcells standards. No pads. 
``I'm just trying to get guys feeling the best for this game they 
can feel,'' he explained. Parcells did not add, though, that he also 
turned up the heat to 75 degrees in the practice bubble this week. 
It was even hotter on the artificial turf under the dome. Then again, 
why not try everything? It has been a rivalry that has often been 
defined by the big play and by record offensive shootouts. Sunday 
night's meeting could easily be decided by a fumble or an interception, 
as defining games often are. The Jets enjoyed that turnover advantage 
in their first game this season, when they used a Victor Green interception 
of Dan Marino to position a touchdown drive. It was one of only two 
Jets touchdowns in a 20-9 victory. Even more significant than what 
the Jets may do on defense is what they have not done on offense this 
season, which is to give up the ball easily. Thus, the odds go down 
that Miami can win a turnover battle when they face the Jets, even 
though the Dolphins have created 32 fumbles and interceptions, a number 
unsurpassed in the league. With Vinny Testaverde as the starting quarterback 
in 10 games, the Jets have lost the ball a total of only 12 times. 
Testaverde has produced a 9-1 record while being intercepted only 
five times. There have been seven fumbles. So while Miami's defense 
averages 2.4 turnovers a game, the Jets' offense is guilty of exactly 
half that number when Testaverde is calling the signals. ``That's 
what makes this game so interesting,'' Testaverde said Friday. Miami, 
meanwhile, has had trouble with the type of team the Jets represent. 
The Dolphins' four losses _ to the Jets, Jacksonville, Buffalo and 
New England _ were at the hands of teams that hold on to the ball 
better than most. ``Turnovers are certainly the most significant statistic 
in football,'' Parcells said Friday. ``A turnover almost always represents 
a substantial loss of field position. It's a very big play in game 
momentum.'' Parcells says a team that has one more turnover than its 
opposition will win 68 percent of the time. That number is increased 
to 74 percent with a two-turnover advantage, and soars to 87 percent 
when a club has three more. ``I don't think there's any question that 
Jimmy Johnson is a turnover-conscious coach,'' Parcells said of his 
Dolphins rival. Johnson, too, believes that turnovers are the key 
factor in most games and is noted for his getting-to-the-ball drills. 
``I've never been around a coach who stressed turnovers as much as 
Jimmy does,'' said punter John Kidd, who played for Johnson the last 
two years before winding up a Jet. ``We had one drill in which the 
linebackers and defensive linemen would run back and forth knocking 
the ball out, causing fumbles,'' he said. ``It's a key to winning 
on the road. On Sunday, the Dolphins will have a noisy, energized 
crowd. You don't like to face that. A turnover changes the atmosphere.'' 
In the Jets, the speedy Miami defense will face a club that has played 
four fumble-free, interception-free games. Testaverde's interception 
percentage of 1.5 is third best in the league among active starters. 
The Dolphins, meanwhile, have more interceptions than any other team 
_ 26. No wonder Testaverde thinks this is such an interesting game. 
EXTRA POINTS _ Jets guard TODD BURGER said he was not nervous about 
this big game. ``But my wife asked me last night, `Are you OK?' She 
said I wasn't eating as much, and I've had an upset stomach.'' Burger 
has been under pressure all year from coach BILL PARCELLS. ``That's 
the least of my worries now,'' Burger said. ``A week like this, I 
find myself watching a little more film, studying the playbook a little 
more.'' _ The Jets had gone eight straight games without a starter 
being sidelined by injury. But Parcells concedes that cornerback AARON 
GLENN, who has a sprained ankle, will not play Sunday and that fullback 
KEITH BYARS seems unlikely to play with a break in his arm.
