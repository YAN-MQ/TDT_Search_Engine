The family of a dissident Iranian writer reported Friday that he has 
gone missing, the third government critic to disappear over the past 
month. The other two writers were later found dead, one of them apparently 
strangled _ the latest in a series of unexplained murders of government 
critics. Mohammad Jafar Pouyandeh, a 45-year-old writer and translator, 
left his workplace Wednesday and has not been heard of since, his 
daughter, Nazanin Pouyandeh, said. ``We have contacted the morgues, 
the coroner's office, and the police, but have gotten nowhere,'' said 
the 17-year-old Nazanin. ``After what has recently happened to other 
writers like my father we fear the worst,'' she told The Associated 
Press. Tehran's Hamshahri daily reported Thursday that the body of 
Mohammad Mokhtari, another dissident writer who went missing last 
week, was found dumped on the outskirts of the capital. The New York-based 
Human Rights Watch said marks on Mokhtari's head and neck indicated 
that he had been murdered, possibly by strangulation, although no 
autopsy has yet been carried out. Mokhtari and Pouyandeh were among 
eight government critics who had been trying to establish a writers' 
association. They were summoned to a court about two months ago to 
answer questions about their activities. Increasingly, hard-line rivals 
of moderate President Mohammad Khatami are resorting to violence to 
deal with opponents. Over the past year, vigilantes have attacked 
dissidents, liberal newspapers and even a reformist Cabinet minister. 
Nobody has been charged in any of the attacks, leading to suspicions 
that the campaign is being backed by powerful hard-line clerics like 
spiritual leader Ali Khamenei and Ayatollah Mohammad Yazdi, the head 
of the judiciary. Last month, Majid Sharif, another writer, went missing 
and was later found dead but his family said he may have died of a 
heart attack. Also last month, the head of an Iranian opposition group, 
Dariush Foruhar, and his wife Parvaneh were stabbed to death in their 
home. Police said they've made several arrests in the murders of the 
Foruhars after Khatami condemned the killings and ordered an investigation. 
But the findings have not been made public. Human Rights Watch has 
demanded an investigation into ``these killings,'' saying they are 
part of an ``increasingly sinister pattern of harassment and persecution 
of government critics in Iran.''
