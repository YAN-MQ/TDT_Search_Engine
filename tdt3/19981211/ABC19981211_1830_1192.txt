When we come back -- the lasting power of rock 'N' roll. May irritate 
your stomach, while others won't? no. I just know aspirin can do that 
sometimes. Different kind of medicine? Good guess. There are two kinds 
of over-the-counter pain relievers. One type is called NSAIDs, which 
include aspirin, ibuprofen, naproxen sodium-- to name a few. And every 
single nsaid, to varying degrees, including even ibuprofen, can sometimes 
irritate your stomach... by interfering with the production of the 
substance... that lines and protects the stomach. And surprisingly, 
this irritation can occur at the stomach lining... without you even 
feeling it. The other type of pain reliever is the medicine in Tylenol. 
Tylenol won't irritate your stomach the way NSAIDs, like aspirin or 
even ibuprofen, sometimes can. That's one reason why doctors recommend 
it most. So take care of your pain, and take care of your stomach.
