Eli Lilly stocks surging today. That follows a report that the company's 
drug, Evista, used to treat osteoporosis, has been able to reduce 
the risk of breast cancer in clinical trials by 55%. Results will 
officially be presented over the weekend. "The Wall Street Journal" 
says that Lilly is working with the food and drug administration to 
make changes in Evista's package label that would reflect the new 
data on breast cancer risk.
