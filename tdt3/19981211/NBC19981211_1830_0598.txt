Even with an impeachment vote hanging over him, the president still 
will go ahead with his trip to the Middle East -- an attempt to save 
the peace agreement between Israel and the Palestinians. That he had 
such a major role in working out. Mr. Clinton will walk into utter 
chaos. A week of deadly violence -- 4 dead, almost 300 wounded. The 
West Bank has made this a very dangerous trip. NBC's Martin Fletcher 
is in Israel tonight. The risks are high. Israel on high alert and 
taking no chances. The biggest security operation in Israel's history. 
15,000 soldiers and police -- hitting the streets to protect against 
the threat of a terrorist attack. 500 police alone will guard Clinton's 
hotel. The fear -- the violence that rocked the violence will disrupt 
a triumphant moment for the president. Benjamin Netanyahu and Arafat. 
Now net and na Ru and Arafat have ordered a halt to the rioting. For 
the chief negotiator, the fighting would not stop in time. I have 
seen nothing in the past years of my life except suffering and death. 
Now death has struck his family. His cousin, nasser, a 21-year-old 
college student. He was at home when soldiers clashed with youths. 
The family says nasser was on this roof studying when he heard shooting 
and shouting. He went over here to have a look. He leaned over and 
was shot in the head. He would lay in the hospital brain dead for 
two days. Many could not understand, how could nasser's cousin, the 
Palestinian dedicated to peace, really believe peace could ever happen? 
Nasser's father. Where is the peace? They come here and kill my son 
-- that's peace? It's very painful. I'm hurt. I feel hurt. I'm sure 
that many here question what you are doing in the peace process. Is 
that what you promised us? They don't have to say it. I can see it 
in everyone's eyes. Erakaat's mission to deliver on the promise of 
peace not only for his own family but for Palestinians and Israelis, 
too. The challenge he shares with President Clinton. Martin Fletcher,
