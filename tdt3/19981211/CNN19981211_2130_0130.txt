The first article, alleging perjury before the federal grand jury, 
passed along a straight party vote. The second, alleging perjury in 
the Paula Jones case, also passed along party lines. But one republican, 
congressman Lindsey Graham, voted against it. Moments before the first 
article was put to a vote, the president appeared before the nation 
saying he was prepared to accept rebuke and censure. He admitted no 
specific wrongdoing. He did apologize again for his actions. What 
I want the American people to know, what I want the Congress to know 
is that I am profoundly sorry for all that I have done wrong in words 
and deeds. I never should have misled the country, the Congress, my 
friends or my family. Quite simply, I gave into my shame. The committee 
should finish and take up the fourth and final charge, abuse of power 
in the moment. Democrats also hope to debate a censure motion.
