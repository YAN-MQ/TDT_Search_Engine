Russia's Parliament passed a bill today limiting the amount of money 
the government can print to pay off its massive debts, an effort to 
halt inflation that is at 70 percent and threatening to go higher. 
President Boris Yeltsin's government has been adding to the money 
supply in recent months to help revive ailing banks and pay off millions 
of state workers whose wages are months overdue. But increasing the 
money supply also stokes inflation. Economists warn that printing 
too much money will spark the kind of hyperinflation that plagued 
Russia for several years in the early 1990s. Despite its huge obligations, 
the government can print only 25 billion additional rubles ($1.3 billion) 
in the final quarter of this year, according to the bill that won 
overwhelming approval in parliament's lower house, the State Duma. 
Central Bank Chairman Viktor Gerashchenko told parliament he endorsed 
the plan and would seek to maintain ``the stability of the ruble,'' 
which has fallen sharply since the country's economic crisis hit in 
August. The Duma passed the bill on its second reading. It must be 
approved one more time before going to parliament's upper chamber, 
where it also is expected to win passage. In another development today, 
the government said the economic crisis had virtually halted the sale 
of major state assets to private investors, and revenues this year 
were only a fraction of those forecast. The government had hoped to 
earn $400 million by auctioning off state property, but it has earned 
only $70 million through October, the Finance Ministry said. The country's 
economic downturn has chased away foreign investors, and the government 
has decided to put off auctions of two large companies, the Rosneft 
oil company and the Svyazinvest communications firm. The government 
is still planning to auction off a 2.5 percent stake in the gas monopoly 
Gazprom later this month, the Interfax news agency reported. The cash-strapped 
government approved a draft budget Thursday and sent it to parliament 
today. In previous years, the government and parliament have wrangled 
over the budget for months. But Prime Minister Yevgeny Primakov has 
good relations with all the leading parliamentary factions and has 
said that rapid passage is necessary to deal with the economic crisis. 
Russia's economy is expected to contract 5 percent this year and has 
been shrinking throughout this decade in one of the worst depressions 
ever suffered by an industrialized nation.
