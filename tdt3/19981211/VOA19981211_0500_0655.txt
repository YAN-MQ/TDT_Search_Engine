The leaders of several Central American countries are in Washington 
pressing their case for a comprehensive reconstruction plan for the 
region following the devastation caused by Hurricane Mitch. As VOA's 
Bill Rodgers reports, the leaders have received pledges of support 
from U.S. lawmakers as well as from the World Bank. The leaders of 
Costa Rica, El Salvador Honduras, Nicaragua and the vice president 
of Guatemala attended a post-hurricane reconstruction conference Thursday 
at the Interamerican Development Bank and then met with a bipartisan 
group of U.S. lawmakers. Later at a Capitol Hill news conference, 
Salvadoran President Armundo Caldedonsol told reporters the leaders 
outlined to the lawmakers the extent of the damage. Speaking through 
an interpreter, Mr. Caldedonsol said they also discussed Central America's 
need for a comprehensive development package comprising trade and 
debt forgiveness. We would like this initiative to have some components 
such as immigration, trade, funds for reconstruction and recovery, 
and also to have special treatment for our debt. Republican Senator 
Paul Coverdale, who hosted Thursday's meeting, expressed support. 
While no one and none of these presents would expect after having 
a session like this for every T to be crossed and I to be dotted, 
there's certainly a very receptive understanding on both sides of 
the aisle. The Georgia senator and other lawmakers present indicated 
they would work together in a bipartisan manner to move such an initiative 
forward. The Central American leaders will meet Friday with President 
Clinton who is expected to announce a substantial increase of U.S. 
emergency aid to the region. Such aid now totals $250 million, but 
White House officials say it will be increased by $120 million to 
$370 million. They also say President Clinton will ask Congress to 
forgive most of the government-to-government debt of Nicaragua and 
Honduras, the two nations hardest hit by Hurricane Mitch. Nicaragua 
now owes the U.S. Government $94 million, while Honduras owes $144 
million. Hurricane Mitch, which struck Central America last month, 
left at least 9,000 people dead and caused extensive damage totaling, 
according to some estimates, billions of dollars. Bill Rodgers, VOA 
News, Washington.
