Joe DiMaggio's doctors say the baseball great has awakened from that 
coma. That's a dramatic turnaround from this morning, when they said 
he was near death. DiMaggio is said to be moving his head and able 
to grab and squeeze hands. Doctors say there is no medical explanation 
for the surprising change, and they caution the situation still is 
dire. He is 84 years old. He developed pneumonia after lung cancer. 
He still is on a respirator tonight.
