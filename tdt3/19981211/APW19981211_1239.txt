Indian scientists are proceeding on schedule in the development of 
a longer range version of the nuclear-capable Agni missile, a parliament 
report was quoted as saying Friday. India is also developing a naval 
version of its other nuclear-capable missile, Prithvi, with a strike 
capability of 250 kilometers (155 miles), Press Trust of India reported, 
citing the report of parliament's standing committee for defense. 
``(The) government has already approved the next phase of Agni for 
the development of longer range system using state-of-the-art technologies 
developed indigenously and development work is progressing as per 
schedule,'' said the report. The surface-to surface version of the 
Prithvi, being developed for the army, will have a range of 150 kilometers 
(93 miles), the report said. Chief of Naval Staff Admiral Vishnu Bhagwat 
this month set Jan. 26 as the deadline for arming an unspecified number 
of ships with the Prithvi missiles. Jan. 26 is the national holiday 
on which India celebrates the day in 1950 when its constitution came 
into effect. India and neighbor and rival Pakistan both set off underground 
nuclear test explosions in May and declared themselves nuclear weapons 
powers. Analysts say the next step will be developing delivery systems 
for their weapons. The medium-range Prithvi and the long-range Agni 
are expected to be the mainstay of India's nuclear delivery system, 
according to Jane's Intelligence Review. While the Agni is still in 
the development stage, India's Prithvi force is considered to be in 
the range of 20 to 50 missiles, the magazine says.
