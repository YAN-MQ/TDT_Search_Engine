NATO has officially opened a base in Macedonia where forces can be 
deployed rapidly to Serbia's Kosovo province to ensure the safety 
of international monitors. Speaking at the formal activation of the 
base, NATO commander, U.S. Admiral James Ellis, said he hoped the 
force would never have to go into action. He says the so-called extraction 
force would go into Kosovo only in an emergency situation. The Organization 
for Security and Cooperation in Europe plans to have a 2,000-strong 
verification mission on the ground in Kosovo by mid- January.
