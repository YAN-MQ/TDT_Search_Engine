It is not often that a world championship fight does not get top billing 
on a card, but convention is tossed out when Arturo Gatti fights. 
So, when Fernando Vargas challenges Yory Boy Campas for his International 
Boxing Federation junior middleweight championship at Trump Taj Mahal 
in Atlantic City Saturday night, it will take second billing to Gatti's 
rematch against Ivan Robinson. Anyone who saw the first Gatti-Robinson 
bout on Aug. 22 _ a 10-round split decision by Robinson _ would understand. 
No one understands more than the programmers at HBO, which will broadcast 
the bouts as part of its ``Championship Boxing'' series beginning 
at 10 p.m. Gatti is a human highlight reel. One second he is out on 
his feet. The next second he is knocking out his opponent. Because 
of his great television appeal, Gatti may be the only boxer other 
than Mike Tyson who can be 0-2 in his last two bouts and headline 
a boxing show. Another loss will put Gatti (29-3), who weighed in 
at 135 pounds, further from the lightweight championship picture and 
jeopardize his television clout. Another victory by Robinson (26-2) 
will plant him firmly in the championship field. Gatti calls this 
the most important fight of his career. He said he had taken his training 
very seriously, moving his camp from Virginia Beach, Va., to Vero 
Beach, Fla., to avoid all the temptations _ late night partying _ 
that had plagued his training in the past. Gatti, of Jersey City, 
promises a different performance this time around. ``This will be 
the fight I was supposed to fight back in August,'' he said. ``This 
fight will wash away that performance in August.'' Gatti said he was 
not in top physical condition for that fight. He said he knew it from 
the first round on, after he had thrown several punches. ``Because 
I was out of shape, he was on my level with me being out of shape,'' 
Gatti said. Robinson, of Philadelphia, who weighed in at 133} pounds, 
said that was nonsense. It does appear implausible, considering that 
Gatti was strong enough to trade a significant number of punches with 
Robinson over 10 rounds, knocking Robinson down in the fifth and nearly 
knocking Robinson out in the 10th round. Robinson said he was not 
looking to repeat the performance from the first fight. ``It's going 
to be better than the first fight,'' Robinson said. ``It's going to 
be a lot of action. He's going to make me fight.'' Robinson said the 
first three rounds would be crucial, because he thought Gatti would 
try to take him out early. In the last fight Robinson could sense 
that Gatti kept waiting for him to make a mistake, but Robinson did 
not until the fifth round, when Gatti caught him. But by that time, 
Gatti did not have enough sting on his punches to take Robinson out. 
The Campas-Vargas bout is compelling, because Vargas (14-0) is giving 
away a great deal of experience to Campas (72-2). Many people believe 
Vargas is in over his head. ``That's from people who don't know boxing 
and know that styles make fights,'' Vargas said. ``Yory Boy Campas 
is tailor-made for me. He's a straight-ahead brawler. He'll take 100 
punches to give one. I feel very confident about this fight. I've 
been training very hard. I've sparred 131 rounds getting ready for 
this fight.'' Both fighters weighed in at 151 pounds.
