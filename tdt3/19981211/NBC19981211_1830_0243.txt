Obviously, President Clinton and his White House team are watching 
all of this closely and with a growing sense of anxiety. The president 
-- scheduled to leave for the Middle East tomorrow morning -- did 
make one more public attempt to head off impeachment, saying he would 
accept censure. But did he go far enough? NBC's David Bloom at the 
White House. David? What's the thinking there? Tom, the president 
today ignored the advice of some of his closest advisers who argued 
forcefully that this was his last chance, that he should have gone 
further, that he should have said in effect, "I lied under oath." 
Mr. Clinton refused to do so, because, to quote one top aide, "he 
doesn't think he did." The rose garden apology was a last-minute decision 
-- a belief, aides said, that if the president waited until he returned 
from the Middle East next tuesday, it might be too late. What I want 
the American people to know, what I want the Congress to know, is 
that I am profoundly sorry for all I have done wrong in words and 
in deeds. I never should have misled the country, the Congress, my 
friends or my family. Quite simply, I gave into my shame. White House 
aides said Mr. Clinton's goal was to show his personal pain, to directly 
apologize to Congress and to say publicly, for the first time, that 
he is prepared for their condemnation. I must make my peace with that. 
I must also be at peace with the fact that the public consequences 
of my actions are in the hands of the American people and their representatives 
in the Congress. Should they determine that my errors of word and 
deed require their rebuke and censure, I am ready to accept that. 
From the republican leading the impeachment charge, a predictable 
response. Congressman Tom DeLay saying that, the president's refusal 
to admit he lied under oath is an insult to the intelligence of all 
Americans. The White House had written off DeLay. They are hope ing 
moderate republicans are listening. Tonight one of the president's 
closest advisers said there is's Erie silence out there. It's unknown 
where the president will survive next week's house vote. They said 
more than one of them that we may not have heard the last word from 
Mr. Clinton. tom? Thanks, very much, David Bloom at the White House 
tonight.
