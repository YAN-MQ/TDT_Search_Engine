Cuban authorities have blocked a demonstration to mark the 50th anniversary 
of the Universal Declaration of Human Rights. Members of Cuba's internal 
opposition tried to stage a protest march in a Havana park Thursday, 
but were confronted by plain clothes security agents and Communist 
party supporters. The situation turned violent when foreign journalists 
tried to interview some of the dissidents. Earlier, relatives of four 
jailed opposition activists held a news conference that called for 
the release of the estimated 300 political prisoners held in Cuban 
jails.
