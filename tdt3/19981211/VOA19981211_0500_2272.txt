And for a second straight day Thursday, Iraq denied U.N. weapons inspectors 
access to the Baghdad headquarters of the ruling Bas socialist party. 
VOAs Larry Froind reports there was a second incident as the inspectors 
tried to carry out their duties. One day after Iraq refused to allow 
U.N. weapons inspectors to enter the Baghdad offices of Iraq's ruling 
Bas party. The UNSCOM inspectors were stopped at another site for 
about 45 minutes before they were allowed to enter. United Nations 
spokesman Fred Eckhart says the Iraqi officials at the site describe 
the site as sensitive. It's a difference of views over the procedure 
to inspect the sensitive site; however, this was resolved eventually 
with the Iraqi side accepting the UNSCOM view, and the team was allowed 
to inspect the site. An official of Iraq's Bas party told reporters 
the U.N. inspectors would be turned back again if they tried to enter 
the party's offices. He said there are no materials in the building 
related to the weapons inspection process. U.N. officials say they 
have a right under U.N. resolutions to search any site they wish in 
their hunt for evidence about Iraq's weapons programs. In a weekly 
report, the U.N. inspectors say there is evidence the Bas party offices 
contain materials of significance to the commission's disarmament 
band-aid. In that same report, the inspection commission says Iraq 
interfered with the biological weapons inspection team and a chemical 
weapons inspection team. Both incidents, according to the report, 
occurred last Friday. The United States has warned that a United Nations 
review of U.N. sanctions against Iraq will not take place unless Iraq 
gives its full cooperation to the inspectors. The inspection commission 
is expected to give a full report of its work to U.N. secretary general 
Coulfey Ennen next week. Meanwhile, U.N. spokesman Fred Eckhart confirmed 
a published report that secretary general Ennen said the chief weapons 
inspector Richard Butler has sometimes spoken undiplomatically because 
of the pressure under which he works. Mr. Eckhart said the general 
thrust of the story is correct, but he added that Mr. Ennen and Mr. 
Butler work very closely together and had discussed the 45-minute 
delay in allowing inspectors to enter a site. Larry Froind, VOA News,
