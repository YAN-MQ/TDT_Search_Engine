Two quick program notes. We want to remind our viewers we'll have 
the entire president's speech later on in this hour. Number two, by 
way of preview of tomorrow's "New York Times," we're going to profile 
one of the republican members of Congress on air force one on the 
trip to the Middle East. That is the most important lobbying ground 
available in Washington. It sure is. Congressman Rick Lazio is traveling 
with the president to the Middle East. He might be considering a Senate 
bid in the year 2000. Not only does he have to weigh what his constituents 
in his district want him to do, he may be worrying about what will 
happen in the year 2000. Again he'll be on the plane with the president 
and you can expect some discussion there. Much of official Washington 
is still at it tonight. Nora O'Donnell thank you very much for the 
late information this evening. Thank you, Brian. A lot more to tell 
you about this Friday night. We'll take a closer look at the more 
dramatic moments of the day from the hill to the street to the White 
House as the impeachment effort seems unstoppable. Margy brown, a
