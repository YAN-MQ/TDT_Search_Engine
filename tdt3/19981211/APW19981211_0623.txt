A Thai airliner carrying about 140 people crashed near an airport 
in southern Thailand Friday night, police said. Officers in Surat 
Thani province said there were some survivors from the crash, three 
to five kilometers (two to three miles) from the Surat Thani airport, 
but they did not know how many or what condition they were in. They 
said Thai Airways flight 261 had been on its way to Surat Thani from 
Bangkok when it crashed in Boon Pin district at 6:45 p.m. (1145 GMT). 
An officer, speaking on condition of anonymity, said the plane made 
three turns around the airport in a heavy storm before attempting 
to land. Visibility remained bad on the final approach, he said. Initial 
reports said one engine had exploded, but police said it was unclear 
if the plane had engine trouble before it crashed.
