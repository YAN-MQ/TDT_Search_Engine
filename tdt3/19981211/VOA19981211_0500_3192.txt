Since her recording debut more than 35 years ago, Dionne Warwick has 
been one of America's most successful pop singers. During the 1960s 
her voice not only helped to make her famous, but it also boosted 
the popularity of two songwriters. Tomorrow, she celebrates her 57th 
birthday, and VOA's Ray Freeman has a profile. Dionne Warwick grew 
up in a family of gospel singers and attended college in Hartford, 
Connecticut. After singing background on some recording sessions, 
her talents were discovered and she was signed to a contract of her 
own, to work with the writing team of Burt Bachrach and Hal David. 
Don't Make Me Over was the first of many Bachrach/David compositions 
Dionne Warwick would record. This song became a big hit in 1963, and 
Dionne left college to devote more time to her career. A long list 
of hits followed, written especially for her by Burt Bachrach and 
Hal David, songs like Walk On By, You'll Never Get to Heaven, Message 
to Michael, Alfie, and the million-selling song from 1967: I Say a 
Little Prayer. Dionne Warwick's hit records like I Say a Little Prayer 
continued through the late 1960s. The early 1970s marked a turning 
point in her career. The Bachrach/David team disbanded and Dionne 
Warwick left her original record label to sign with the Warner Brothers 
Company. Curiously, her only major success during the five years with 
Warner turned out to be her biggest selling single: Dionne Warwick 
and the Spinners. Dionne Warwick continues to perform and has also 
pursued a range of business interests outside music including an interior 
design firm, a fragrance called Dionne, the Psychic Friends Network 
and a television production company. She's also involved in a number 
of humanitarian causes. This past October, Dionne Warwick released 
another new CD called Dionne Sings Dionne, which gives a new treatment 
to many of her classics hits of the past. This is Ray Freeman.
