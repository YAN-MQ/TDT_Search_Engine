The House of Representatives Judiciary Committee is hotly debating 
articles of impeachment against President Clinton, only the third 
U.S. president ever to face such proceedings. The committee deeply 
divided on party lines is preparing to vote on four impeachment articles: 
obstruction of justice, abuse of power, and two counts of perjury. 
The Republican-controlled committee is now considering the first impeachment 
article alleging perjury before a grand jury. For Republican Mary 
Bono of California, the issue is clear. I'm sure that every husband 
or wife knows in their heart that their spouse would consider what 
he did sex. And certainly, even young children recognize that he lied 
about. But for the Democrats like Charles Schumer of New York, the 
charge must be more specific. When you are indicted for perjury, the 
actual perjury words be included in the indictment. The charges stem 
from Mr. Clinton's efforts to conceal his affair with former intern, 
Monica Lewinsky.
