Shirley Jackson, a physicist who is the chairwoman of the federal 
Nuclear Regulatory Commission, was named Friday as president of Rensselaer 
Polytechnic Institute, Troy, N.Y. As head of the NRC, Jackson worked 
to restore the agency's credibility and improve its monitoring of 
nuclear-power plants in the aftermath of several emergency shutdowns. 
She will move to the school on July 1, succeeding R. Byron Pipes, 
who left office in April. Neal Barton has been serving as acting president 
of the 6,400-student university. Jackson, 52, will be the first African-American 
woman to head a leading technological university. All her life she 
has set precedents. She was the first black woman to earn a Ph.D. 
at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology; in 1973, she was also 
the first to become an NRC commissioner. Jackson describes herself 
as a ``change agent.'' As an undergraduate at MIT, for example, she 
was a founder of the Black Students Association, and helped increase 
the number of African Americans entering the university to 57 from 
two in just one year. MIT President Charles Vest said Jackson had 
been one of his close advisers. ``That calm, reasoned voice on the 
other end of the telephone has been a source of strength and wisdom 
for me,'' he said. ``She will be a truly outstanding university president.'' 
Jackson joined the NRC, an agency with about 3,000 employees and a 
budget of $500 million, in 1995, shortly before it acknowledged ignoring 
its own safety regulations in overseeing Northeast Utilities' Millstone 
nuclear station in Connecticut. ``To her credit, she's helped to re-legitimize 
the agency,'' said James Riccio, a staff attorney at Public Citizen, 
an advocacy organization. ``Unfortunately, it seems she is leaving 
before that mission is accomplished.'' In her new post, Jackson said, 
she hopes ``to position Rensselaer not only as an excellent university, 
but as one of the truly great technological institutes of the 21st 
century.'' Although most of her career has been spent in the private 
sector _ she worked for many years as a researcher at Bell Laboratories 
_ she taught from 1991 to 1995 at Rutgers University and has served 
as a trustee of both Rutgers and MIT, where she was also on the board 
of directors and the board's executive committee. Before entering 
government, Jackson was also on the boards of Corestates Financial 
Corp., the Sealed Air Corp., the New Jersey Resources Corp. and the 
Public Service Electric and Gas Company and its parent company, Public 
Service Enterprise Group. Jackson grew up in Washington, D.C. Her 
father was a postal supervisor, and her mother was a social worker. 
At a time when it was unusual for women to receive advanced degrees, 
she and her two sisters earned graduate degrees.
