As the impeachment vote neared, oddly bipartisan tinges of sadness 
glimmered at times along the House Judiciary Committee. A hurriedly 
jotted note of consolation _ ``Don't worry, this is a strong country.'' 
_ was quietly dispatched in mid-debate by a sympathetic Republican 
to a Democrat agonizing across the aisle. The gravity of the lawmakers' 
action in proposing the removal of President Clinton seemed to be 
sinking in. Much of the long day's struggle over the fate of the president 
was consumed in the laborious trench warfare of lawyers, with Democrats 
demanding precise details of the charges they were voting on against 
``the accused,'' as one Republican put it. But through another grueling 
day there were occasional personal truces to be seen, as if called 
for by the grave occasion of voting the impeachment of the president. 
Steve Chabot, Republican of Ohio, walked over to the other side as 
the debate wore on and in the touchy-feely rites so important in the 
political jungle patted the shoulder of a Democratic friend in a private 
exchange of words. ``This is a very sad thing, but it's our duty,'' 
Chabot later explained to a questioner during a break before fervidly 
opposing his Democratic friend in the showdown vote count. Some long 
absent grace notes were to be found even as a party-line vote for 
impeachment was approaching. Members showed every appearance of listening 
closely to one another, even if no minds were changed. Melvin L. Watt, 
a North Carolina Democrat doggedly fighting for Clinton, took a break 
and sat in the general audience, listening to a Republican whose five-minute 
speaking allotment ran out in mid-sentence. ``Unanimous consent to 
grant the member extra time,'' Watt gently requested of the chair, 
gaining a few minutes more for Lindsey O. Graham, South Carolina Republican, 
to speak dolefully of President Clinton. ``His fate is in his hands,'' 
Graham said of the president, then closed in direct address to the 
chief executive: ``Don't bite your lip; reconcile yourself with the 
law.'' For all the partisanship on display on television in the arguments, 
the mood within the room was noticeably gentler at times, with no 
committee members waxing skeptical of the sincerity of their counterparts, 
despite their differences regarding the matters on the table. Chairman 
Henry Hyde's only acknowledgment of the historical moment of the day 
was a light announcement that he would be wielding a series of ceremonial 
impeachment gavels to commemorate the occasion, much the way bill 
signings are honored at the White House. Beyond the hearing room, 
the House Rayburn Building seemed a hushed theater awaiting the final 
act. ``I was here for Nixon,'' said the House barber, Joe Quattrone, 
cutting a customer's hair as the hearing sounded from a television 
in his shop below the committee room. ``And this is very different. 
Even if it gets to the Senate, it won't pass. They should stop right 
now for the benefit of the country,'' he insisted grimly after 29 
years of discussing Capitol politics at the napes of members' necks. 
Outside his shop, holiday toys were piled in Capitol boxes. Stacks 
of furniture were in sight in the corridors as the winners and losers 
of last month's election resituated themselves in life. The Rayburn 
balcony was crammed and buzzing with television operations worthy 
of a presidential nominating convention, anchor people talking endlessly 
on camera in the sunny breeze that cut across the Capitol dome behind 
them. ``I don't want to talk about this at all,'' said one of the 
president's lawyers encountered in a sudden corridor turning, looking 
almost frightened as the voting approached. In the committee room, 
Robert Wexler, Florida Democrat, was sounding a final alarm. ``Wake 
up, America, they are about to impeach our president!'' he shouted. 
``If you're sick of all-Monica, all the time, you ain't seen nothin' 
yet,'' he said of the specter of a long Senate trial ``showcasing 
America at its most absurd'' with ``the chief justice of the Supreme 
Court swearing in Lucianne Goldberg! Linda Tripp!'' And Asa Hutchinson, 
Arkansas Republican, braced the pro-impeachment side: ``Our nation 
has survived the failings of its leaders before.'' The middle ground 
of censure for ``this political morality play,'' was urged by Tom 
Barrett, Democrat of Wisconsin. Suddenly, a 35-year-old video clip 
of John Kennedy, Clinton's boyhood hero, was being presented by Christopher 
B. Cannon, Utah Republican. He played and replayed Kennedy's warning 
that all presidents must strictly uphold the law or ``we would begin 
to unwind this most extraordinary Constitutional system.'' And the 
first vote came: At 4:20 p.m., the committee voted 21 to 16 along 
party lines for the first article of impeachment accusing the president 
of perjury before the grand jury. ``Wherefore, William Jefferson Clinton, 
by such conduct, warrants impeachment and trial, and removal from 
office and disqualification to hold and enjoy any office of honor, 
trust, or profit under the United States,'' the resolution read. Minutes 
earlier down Pennsylvania Avenue, Clinton, was again apologizing to 
the nation. ``I am profoundly sorry,'' he said. But the committee 
was soon into the debate on the second perjury article of impeachment, 
with Bill McCollum, Florida Republican, rapidly flipping page by page 
through a memo, announcing at a dozen places, ``He lied. He lied.'' 
The lawmaker added, ``He should be impeached, unfortunately and sadly.'' 
The article was approved. Almost businesslike, the committee moved 
on to the next article proposing the president's removal from office. 
The votes signaled House members across the nation to head here to 
the final debate next week on whether Clinton should be put on trial 
in the Senate.
