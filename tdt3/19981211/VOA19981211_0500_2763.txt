In what the communications industry's report calls the first of a 
kind, a motion picture recently had its American premier in five theaters 
across the United States without the need for film. The national release 
of the Last Broadcast was made possible using technology developed 
by two companies: America's Texas Instruments and Britain's Digital 
Projection. Mike Levy, president of Digital Projection's North American 
operations, says that instead of using traditional celluloid, the 
new process takes advantage of existing computer technology. The reason 
Last Broadcast's premier was actually a film that was produced digitally. 
It was shot on 8-millimeter videotape. All the post- production was 
done on a desktop, a computer desktop, and then after that was done, 
it was transferred to videotape. The tape was transmitted to satellites 
and distributed electronically from there to theaters in Rhode Island, 
Pennsylvania, Florida, Minnesota and Oregon. No reels of film were 
involved. Again, Mike Levy. At the theaters, you have two options. 
It could've been played live, but normally most people would shy away 
from that because if you have a glitch in the satellite, you have 
a glitch while you're watching the film. So in this case, the Last 
Broadcast was actually downloaded via satellite to servers at each 
theatrical location. These computerized servers in the various theaters 
captured the digital signals and played them back on a projection 
screen. Mike Levy of Digital Projection says that the quality of the 
digital technique is comparable to that of film. We believe that the 
enabling technologies to deliver electronic cinema already exist. 
The key, though, is that the cinema industry has been built around 
celluloid, and at a certain moment we believe the folks from Hollywood 
will say all right, we think it's better, let's start the transition. 
It's hard to predict exactly when that'll happen, though.
