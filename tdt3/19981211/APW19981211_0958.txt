After dominating the women's speed skiers, Austria's Alexandra Meissnitzer 
overwhelmed the World Cup's technical field Friday, taking the giant 
slalom to collect her fourth win of the week. Just 24 hours after 
winning the super-G by a wide margin, the 25-year-old Austrian proved 
her superiority over the circuit's strongest giant slalom skiers, 
including Olympic champion Deborah Compagnoni and reigning World Cup 
champion Martina Ertl. Flying down the foggy, bumpy Piste-G course 
in a two-run combined time of 2 minutes, 17.34 seconds, Meissnitzer 
built up a massive .82 lead ahead of runner-up Compagnoni down the 
opening run in 1:08.53. Meissnitzer's second-fastest time of 1:08.81 
in the final leg was enough to secure her fourth win of the season, 
her second in giant slalom. ``I knew I had to risk everything,'' said 
Meissnitzer. ``I only had a .20 lead after the first run so I couldn't 
be too tactical about it. I just went for it and it worked.'' Meissnitzer, 
who also won a pair of super-G races, has reinforced her lead atop 
the overall World Cup standings where she sits with 625 points. Winner 
of four out of nine women's races so far this season, Meissnitzer's 
results have only served to fuel her ever growing confidence. ``When 
I stand at the start I just feel nothing can go wrong,'' said Meissnitzer, 
who also won at Park City last month, winning a super-G and a giant 
slalom. ``My confidence is thriving. I have no doubts in my head.''
