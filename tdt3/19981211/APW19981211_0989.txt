ATHENS, Greece (AP) _ EFG Eurobank, one of Greece's biggest banks, 
will merge with the smaller Bank of Athens, it was announced Friday. 
A number of Greek banks have been consolidating in recent months to 
better prepare for Greece's expected entry into European Monetary 
Union on Jan. 1, 2001. Greece is the only country of the 15-member 
EU that failed to qualify for the first round of the single currency. 
Britain, Denmark and Sweden opted out of joining. Eurobank, an unlisted 
bank, bought the Bank of Athens, which is listed, last summer. Under 
a proposal by both banks' boards of directors, unlisted Eurobank will 
be absorbed by the Bank of Athens. The new bank will be named EFG 
Eurobank S.A.
