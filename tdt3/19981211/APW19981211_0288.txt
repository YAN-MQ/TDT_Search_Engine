Three separate bombing incidents shattered the peace in Budapest's 
residential areas early Friday, but no one was wounded, police said. 
A few minutes after midnight, an explosive went off under a Daewoo 
car in the capital's 18th district, causing extensive damage to the 
car, Budapest police spokesman Zoltan Petoe was quoted by state television 
as saying. The car was reported to have belonged to the wife of a 
Malev Hungarian Airlines pilot. The other two explosions occurred 
a few minutes apart, at around 5:00 am (04:00 GMT). In the 14th district, 
a Molotov cocktail was thrown to the door of a house. The door caught 
fire, but the fire brigade soon extinguished it. Almost immediately 
afterward, in the neighboring 15th district, a Molotov cocktail was 
thrown into the garden of a house, burning the grass. There have been 
more than 140 bombings and grenade attacks in Hungary between 1991 
and early 1998, targeting people, houses, bars, restaurants and cars. 
Police theorize that most are part of a gangland war for turf, or 
are a means of settling accounts among rival criminal gangs. However, 
politicians and police officials recently noted that the explosions 
had stopped after May's general elections, when the Young Democrats 
of new Prime Minister Viktor Orban beat the ruling Socialist Party. 
Before Friday's explosions, the last incident had occurred July 2 
in downtown Budapest, when a remote-controlled bomb killed a police 
informer and three passers-by, and wounded 24 people.
