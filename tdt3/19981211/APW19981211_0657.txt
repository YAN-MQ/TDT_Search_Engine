MOSCOW (AP) _ U.S. Deputy Secretary of State Strobe Talbott met with 
Russia's prime minister and other top officials Friday to discuss 
the flow of weapons technology to the Middle East. One of Talbott's 
key concerns with Russia in the past has been disarmament and arms 
control, including U.S. fears that Russia is not doing enough to prevent 
weapons technology from going to countries such as Iran. The issue 
was raised during Talbott's meeting with the chief of Russia's Security 
Council and of President Boris Yeltsin's staff, Nikolai Bordyuzha, 
said presidential spokesman Dmitry Yakushkin. Non-proliferation of 
weapons technology was also expected to be discussed during Talbott's 
meeting Friday with Russia's Foreign Minister Igor Ivanov. But no 
details were available about the closed-door talks. Later in the day, 
Talbott met with Russian Prime Minister Yevgeny Primakov. ``We understand 
what place the United States occupies in the modern world,'' Primakov 
said at the start of the talks. ``We would like for our partners also 
to know more about modern Russia, to know more about our intentions,'' 
Primakov said. Talbott arrived in Moscow on Wednesday night, leading 
a group of officials planning to discuss Russia's economic crisis 
and other issues. U.S. Deputy Treasury Secretary Lawrence Summers, 
who was traveling with Talbott, met Friday with Russian Economics 
Minister Andrei Shapovalyants. They discussed Russia's economic turmoil 
and investments in Russia, the Interfax news agency reported.
