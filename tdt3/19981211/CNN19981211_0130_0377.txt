President Clinton observed world human rights day by announcing steps 
to protect human rights. They include new rules for child asylum seekers 
in America and a genocide early warning center to be run by the state 
department and the CIA. Wednesday's ceremony marked the 50th anniversary 
of the United Nations adoption of the universal declaration of human 
rights. This document did reaffirm faith in humankind, it is really 
the magna Carta of our humanity. Article one states that all human 
beings are born free and equal in dignity and rights. They are endowed 
with reason and conscience and should act toward one another in a 
spirit of brotherhood. There are no commas or parentheses in this 
sentence. No qualifications or exceptions just the power of affirmation.
