The Haitian government is encouraging efforts by expatriates living 
in France to bring former dictator Jean-Claude Duvalier to court. 
``Justice Minister Max Antoine has urged people to file suit. Our 
government has certain documents relative to Duvalier's situation 
and will do everything in its power'' to assist the victims, Interior 
Minister Jean Moliere told the private Radio Haiti-Inter on Friday. 
Encouraged by the arrest in Great Britain of former Chilean military 
ruler Augusto Pinochet, Haitian-born photographer Gerald Bloncourt 
founded a committee a week ago to bring Duvalier to trial for crimes 
against humanity. Named president for life at age 19 following the 
death of his father in 1971, Duvalier, 47, has lived in France since 
February 1986, when a popular uprising forced him into exile. His 
father, Francois, known as ``Papa Doc,'' had ruled Haiti with an iron 
hand since 1957 with the help of the Tontons Macoutes, his private 
militia. Tens of thousands of people were massacred and tortured to 
death during the 31-year father-and-son dynasty.
