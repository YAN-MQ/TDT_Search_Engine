Ivan Slavkov, son-in-law of late communist strongman Todor Zhivkov, 
was reelected Friday as head Bulgaria's Soccer Union. Slavkov defeated 
Sofia's popular mayor, Stefan Sofiyanski, 283-128 in a ballot at a 
Union congress Friday. Despite increasing criticism following Bulgaria's 
poor performance at the World Cup finals in France last July, Slavkov 
_ who was married to Zhivkov's late daughter Lyudmila _ still had 
enough supporters in the soccer establishment to retain his post. 
He also heads his country's Olympic Committee. Bulgaria's team of 
aging stars and inexperienced youngsters has been disappointing since 
it qualified fourth in the world in 1994 after defeating former world 
champions Germany and Argentina. The Soccer Union is currently locked 
in a legal battle with the government committee on sports, to repeal 
a September ban on it running the soccer teams. The ban came as a 
result of a doping scandal, that the committee blamed the Union of 
mishandling. In June, the Union suspended league player Ilia Gruev 
from competition for three months, after he tested positive of a banned 
drug in April. The committee says the punishment was delayed and insufficient. 
Sofiyanski has pledged to help overcome the setback in Bulgaria's 
soccer and warm up strained relations between the Union and the government.
