The concept of franchising, where companies sell individuals the right 
to operate stores that bear the firm's name, originated in the United 
States in the '40s. Now, it's an international phenomenon. Linda Kashton 
reports. Improvements in technology are facilitating the trend. Marcel 
Portman, international director of the U.S. Franchise Association, 
says the increased availability of communications devices like faxes, 
wireless telephones and electronic mail has made it easier for businesses 
to expand to other countries. And franchising is a highly effective 
expansion tool, Mr. Portman says, because when you sell your idea 
to someone in another country, you're getting a business partner who 
understands the foreign market and its customs. The new partner, Mr. 
Portman says, is getting the chance to market an idea that has already 
been proven a success. Basically, the franchiser is giving you a puzzle 
where they have all the pieces and you have to put it together with 
them. If you want to go into the pizza business, you -- and you've 
never even done a pizza even at home, with a franchise it's an achievable 
goal because they will train you from what -- how a pizza is made 
to how to sell it, how to market it, how to distribute it, how to 
package it, even. Franchises not only spread business, Mr. Portman 
says; they spread ideas. He says an Australian franchise called Cash 
Converters has introduced U.S. shoppers to a novel way to save antique 
valuables. He says the U.S. packaging franchise, Mail Boxes, Etc, 
has facilitated postal service in many parts of the world. It's a 
way of improving standards of living in many countries because a lot 
of countries can use a good concern like Mail Boxes, Etc. Personally, 
when I was in Chile -- I was raised in Chile -- and the hamburger 
business was terrible until McDonald's came in. They came to Chile 
and they showed people how a burger can be nicely wrapped and nice 
restaurant, clean floors, clean bathrooms, nice big sign, everybody 
with uniform, and everybody started catching up to it. And those that 
didn't catch up to them are no longer there. In Chile, Mr. Portman 
says, McDonald's hamburgers are served with avocado. Franchisers may 
spread new ideas, he says, but if they want to be successful, they 
will adapt to old customs as well. Linda Kashton, VOA News, Washington.
