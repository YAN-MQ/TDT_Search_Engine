It has happened only three times in American history, to only three 
presidents. It happened here today, and Bill Clinton is now only the 
third president in American history to be the target of articles of 
impeachment. The single most extraordinary power given to Congress 
by the constitution. The day proceeded with high drama at two separate 
locations a few miles apart here. Here on the hill the debate was 
withering if not all high minded as it became clear a vote was indeed 
nearing. Just miles away, the president chose to move late in the 
afternoon, delivering a speech from the rose garden issuing another 
apology, but his statement was dead on arrival here on the hill, because 
of what he did not say. Tonight, actual articles of impeachment are 
in the books. Whatever the outcome, Bill Clinton's name as of today 
will forever be linked to impeachment in the history books, preceding 
any accomplishments in office by this oddly otherwise popular two-term 
president. Tonight NBC news White House correspondent David Bloom 
is standing by for us on the north lawn.
