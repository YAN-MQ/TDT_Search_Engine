NASA is hoping a multi million dollar spacecraft helps them learn 
more about the surface of Mars. Allard beutel reports. The Mars climate 
Orbiter is the first of two spacecraft that make up NASA's Mars 98 
mission. Scientists hope this $328 million project will help them 
better understand how the red planet's climate has changed over time 
and where water is located now on Mars. This mission won't directly 
search for life. But NASA says water is the key to finding it. If 
you want to look for life, either fossilized life or other life on 
another planet, you have to follow the water. The Orbiter is scheduled 
to arrive at Mars in September, 1999. Once in orbit, it will use a 
technique for several weeks called "Aerobreaking." In this tricky 
maneuver, the spacecraft dips into the planet's upper atmosphere and 
the resulting friction helps reduce its speed and put it into a more 
circular orbit. After it's in position over the planet's poles, the 
Orbiter will await the arrival of its counterpart, the Mars polar 
lander, which is scheduled to launch January 3rd and touch down on 
Mars next December. The Orbiter will spend the first three months 
of its mission serving as a Radio relay satellite for the lander. 
After that, it'll spend two years taking images of the surface to 
look for daily and seasonal weather patterns. It will also scan the 
atmosphere and monitor its changes. The Orbiter will basically track 
the movement of water vapor and dust in the atmosphere of Mars over 
the whole globe. It's sort of like a satellite, a weather satellite. 
It can observe how the water evaporates from the ground, how it moves 
up into the air, how it dissipates, the roll that dust plays in that 
process and it can do it over the whole planet. After its mapping 
mission is over, the Orbiter will serve up to two years as a communications 
relay for future Mars Landers. Allard beutel, "Headline News."
