Why on earth would a bank want to turn itself into a savings and loan? 
It happened in Tulsa, Okla., on Dec. 1. State Bank &AMP; Trust Co., 
owned by the Walton family of Wal-Mart Stores, took the rare legal 
step to clear the way to open four branches in the state, including 
two in Wal-Mart stores. Some competitors worry that there is more 
to the move than meets the eye. Oklahoma law limits banks to two branches 
each, though the rule can be bent by acquiring another institution, 
including one chartered expressly for the purpose. Oklahoma's largest 
banks have grown to as many as 70 branches that way, usually paying 
for the acquisitions with stock. But State Bank, a subsidiary of the 
Walton-owned Arvest Bank Group, is privately held and generally had 
to pay cash for acquisitions. It managed to grow to 12 branches, including 
two in Wal-Mart stores, but its latest expansion plans ran into stiff 
resistance. So State Bank became the first major national bank to 
convert directly to a savings and loan _ State Federal Savings &AMP; 
Loan Association, and thus became exempt from the branching law. ``It 
will give us the ability to go where we want to go,'' said the bank's 
executive vice president, Larry Choate. And that is seen as a threat 
by the state's Community Bankers Association. There would be ``an 
unbelievable impact if they decide to put a branch in every store,'' 
said James McKeown, the group's executive director. Bank branches 
in discount stores and supermarkets are generally leased by the retailer 
to the highest bidder. The Walton family tie is what makes State Bank 
worrisome to McKeown's group. ``They will change those banks to their 
own banks,'' he predicted. State federal officials dismissed McKeown's 
concern, calling the rechartering a last resort. ``We did not want 
to do it,'' said the bank's president, Donald Walker, ``but you cannot 
serve Tulsa with just five locations.'' He said the bank gets no advantage 
from the Walton family connection and must still compete for branch 
leases. And Choate said Arvest chief executive Jim Walton ``could 
care less if we put a branch in a Wal-Mart.'' Oklahoma Banking Commissioner 
Mick Thompson said that to escape the branching limits, other Oklahoma 
banks might follow the lead of State Federal and a state savings and 
loan, Mid-First, which switched to a federal charter last year.
