Imagining the brief celebrity he might achieve if he showed up on 
``Baywatch,'' Neal Thomas, a New York banker, leaped into the bidding 
at a charity auction for the Franciscan Sisters of the Poor Foundation 
last week at Mickey Mantle's Restaurant. On the block was a walk-on 
part on the television show, which concerns itself with lifeguards 
and skimpy beach wear. ``Maybe they'll put me in a role where I'm 
a drowning victim,'' Thomas said with excitement the day after he 
successfully clinched the part for $2,300. ``Maybe they'll get a shot 
of me with water blowing out of my nose.'' While he is eager to have 
his family and friends catch his close-up when it is shown sometime 
next season, he was not certain he really wanted to display himself 
in a bathing suit. ``I'm not exactly in the best shape,'' he said. 
Whether it means putting on a Speedo for ``Baywatch'' or lying there 
like a corpse for ``General Hospital,'' a cameo television appearance 
is just one of the fantasy moments now tempting bidders at charity 
auctions. As the fund-raising season reaches its height, the question 
is not what's for sale for a good cause, but whether anything isn't 
_ from a wild-boar hunt in France to an arctic mountain-climbing expedition 
to a date in Paris with Claudia Schiffer and some of her supermodel 
friends. At last week's fund-raiser for the Franciscan sisters, which 
was also held to benefit the Brooklyn Sports Foundation, an audience 
with the pope was on the block as well. With some six fund-raising 
auctions a week this month in New York alone, charities have to compete 
hard to capture donors and dollars. And so increasingly, organizers 
are replacing traditional goods with exotic or extraordinary experiences. 
Some gimmicks are more gritty than glamorous: Earlier this year, the 
Nightingale-Bamford School in Manhattan offered an insider's visit 
to a Manhattan criminal court to watch a trial and meet the judge. 
And in the Seattle area, a popular auction item is a trip to Alaska 
on a Totem Ocean Trailer Express cargo ship as the only guest, with 
the crew and containers full of livestock and lumber. (Next chance 
is in March, to benefit the St. Andrew's Housing Group in Bellevue, 
Wash.) Thomas, of future ``Baywatch'' fame, said he was just looking 
for a good excuse to contribute to the building of an amateur sports 
complex in Coney Island, his old neighborhood. But the offbeat items 
on the block had him splurging. In addition to buying his big moment 
on ``Baywatch,'' he spent $600 for three rounds with a professional 
boxer, Kathy Collins, at a Long Island gym. ``A charity auction is 
almost like a television game show _ it's got to be entertaining and 
original,'' said Christopher Hartop, the director of specialist departments 
for Christie's in New York and a charity and commercial auctioneer 
for the last 20 years. ``Sometimes organizers think we must get expensive 
things and make it like a serious art auction, but they never seem 
to be as successful as the ones that are just fun.'' At the Robin 
Hood Foundation, an educational and social-services charity in New 
York City, celebrity benefactors make its auctions among the most 
spectacular in town. Last June, one bidder bought visits to the New 
York and Milan fashion shows, four designer outfits and a private 
dinner with Giorgio Armani for $160,000. Bids for a lunch with Ms. 
Schiffer, Elle MacPherson and Naomi Campbell closed at $100,000. ``Tiger 
Woods was in the audience, and he was bidding feverishly for it,'' 
said David Saltzman, executive director of the foundation. ``But he 
lost out to a guy from Merrill Lynch.'' Also for the Robin Hood Foundation, 
Ronald Perelman, the chairman of Revlon, successfully offered $100,000 
for a lesson with the hockey legend Wayne Gretzky, as well as a trip 
to a closed practice and introductions to members of the team. (Perelman 
is donating the lesson to New York City schoolchildren.) Celebrities 
are unpredictable commodities, however. When the Association to Benefit 
Children, in New York, offered a play date in the park with Mia Farrow 
and some of her children in 1992, they couldn't anticipate that the 
Woody Allen and Soon-Yi Previn relationship would go public before 
the auction. Rather than cancel the item, organizers let it go to 
the block. Of course, the scandal only added to its value. The fierce 
bidding reached $5,000. The benefit-auction tradition dates to the 
Victorian era, but it has become a fund-raising staple only since 
the early 1970s. Special-events experts say its popularity in New 
York dates from 1971, when the Lenox Hill Neighborhood Association 
offered a half-interest in a horse belonging to Charles Engelhard, 
a multimillionaire owner of thoroughbreds. Now such auctions have 
spread throughout the United States. And prepackaged action adventures 
often command top bids. On the West Coast, mock dogfights in military-style 
aircraft are a hot ticket. You can snag an hour in an Italian-made 
fighter plane and conduct midair attack maneuvers, complete with fake 
smoke and real nose dives. ``They teach you how to make a kill,'' 
said Kip Toner, a charity auctioneer in Seattle who hawks dozens of 
dogfights each year. Larry Hand, a Seattle tax lawyer, said he bid 
about $1,000 for his chance to co-pilot a fighter plane at an auction 
for his children's private school, the University Preparatory Academy 
in Seattle. ``It was great,'' he said, after exchanging air fire with 
a petrified-looking woman in the next plane. Dan Ortolani, who organizes 
fund-raisers for Grenville Christian College, in the Thousand Islands 
region of Canada, recently auctioned a hiking trip above the Arctic 
Circle on Baffin Island to four bidders for $25,000 apiece. There 
were rifles on hand in case of polar-bear attack, and the group did 
the 20-hour climb in a single day. ``We sort of stumbled comatose 
down the mountain,'' he said. ``But we did it.'' Even people who aren't 
thrill seekers can be tempted by the allure of a dangerous expedition 
when they hear ``Going, going ....'' At the Landon School in Bethesda, 
Md., Patti and Bruce Mackey found themselves the winners of the wild-boar 
hunt in the French countryside, even though the pair prefer blood-free 
vacations. After arriving, Ms. Mackey said, they were offered a stag 
hunt instead. On their own they peered into the woods for some boar 
but saw none. They happily went antiquing instead. Not all items require 
steely resolve and foul-weather gear. In New York, benefit-goers can 
bid on a touch of immortality. At an Authors Guild auction in the 
city last year, the novelist Barbara Taylor Bradford agreed to write 
the name of the highest bidder into her next book. That is how the 
name Dina Zuckerberg achieved its cameo mention in Mrs. Bradford's 
``A Sudden Change of Heart,'' due out in February. The character is 
a career woman who orders pizza for a dinner party. ``I thought Dina 
Zuckerberg was a good name,'' said Mrs. Bradford, who plans to do 
this again in February for the New York charity Literacy Partners. 
Can there be anything left to top these items on the block? Ortolani 
at Grenville Christian College is planning a Mount Kilimanjaro climb 
on New Year's Eve, 2000, complete with a documentary on the bidders 
who make the mission. ``You better bring your credit card,'' he warned. 
``This one won't come cheap.''
