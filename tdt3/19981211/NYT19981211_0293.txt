I happened to be in a secondhand bookstore a while ago and came across 
a copy of ``Climate of Eden,'' by Moss Hart, a play I didn't know 
by a writer I admire. The play had a short run on Broadway and was 
therefore deemed to be a ``failure.'' What turned out to interest 
me more than the play was the author's introduction, in which he listed 
all the things that ailed the Broadway theater at that time (the early 
1950s). I was astonished to note that nothing, nothing has changed. 
Rising ticket prices. Dwindling audiences. Cantankerous critics. Overworked 
authors. Boorish producers. To that should be added unlikely subject 
matters for musicals. Ever since ``Show Boat'' and probably ever since 
the Greeks, people have been talking about how certain subjects seem 
``inappropriate'' for Broadway musicals. It seems to me that virtually 
everything is appropriate to the musical form. When you think of it, 
the most unlikely gallery of subjects has been the basis for most 
of our great musicals. Let's face it: Most shows sound ridiculous 
when boiled down to a few descriptive sentences. A musical about the 
settling of the Oklahoma territory? Ugh. A musical about a barber 
who slits his customer's throats? Yuk. A musical (two actually) about 
a Jewish man who leaves his wife for another man who eventually dies 
of AIDS? Forget it. A musical about the sinking of the ``Titanic''? 
Oh please. What next? A musical about the signing of the Declaration 
of Independence? You must be nuts. Yet ``Oklahoma!,'' ``Sweeney Todd,'' 
``Falsettos,'' ``Titanic,'' ``1776'' and about a zillion other shows 
are part of the rich and moving legacy of 20th-century American theater. 
I suspect that people do not really mean unlikely or inappropriate 
when they address this perennial topic; they really mean serious. 
For reasons that are baffling, one still hears people remark that 
such and such a topic doesn't really seem ``appropriate'' for a musical. 
This, after almost a century of beautiful, successful, serious musicals! 
Certainly we have heard this about ``Parade,'' the musical about the 
Leo Frank case. Just the other day a very nice woman told me she assumed 
``Parade'' was a play and not a musical, because she couldn't imagine 
the story set to music. I hope she will feel differently after she 
sees it. But ``Parade'' is not so much a musical about the Leo Frank 
case as it is a musical about two mismatched people _ Leo Frank and 
his wife, Lucille _ who grow to depend on, appreciate and eventually 
love each other because of the Frank case. A good love story is, after 
all, the centerpiece of many musicals. It's no surprise then, and 
it is clear why Jason Robert Brown, Alfred Uhry, and Hal Prince (our 
composer-lyricist, book writer and director) were drawn to musicalize 
this complex couple trapped by a horrifying example of American injustice. 
Indeed, no matter how unusual, kinky or subversive the subject may 
seem at first glance, at the heart of most musicals is something quite 
common and traditional: our shared humanity. A final thought: if people 
persist in feeling that the Broadway musical must be light and undemanding 
(something that history belies) then it is up to the nonprofit or 
institutional theaters of this country to produce serious musical 
work. For years I have felt that nonprofit theaters must support and 
produce the work of American composers and lyricists and give them 
a home, just as they have given homes to so many American playwrights. 
This is difficult work, demanding and costly. But if the hundreds 
of institutional theaters will follow the example of the few like 
the Playwrights' Horizons and Public Theater in New York, the American 
Musical Theater Festival in Philadelphia and the Goodman Theater in 
Chicago that have attempted to take on the American musical in the 
last 20 years, we may all live to read an essay in a newspaper or 
journal that celebrates our musical theater because it has always 
embraced unlikely subject matters. In the meantime we have to hope 
that if a show ``sings'' to its creators, they in turn will write 
a show that will ``sing'' to us.
