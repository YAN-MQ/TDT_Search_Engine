President Clinton leaves Saturday for a three-day trip to the Middle 
East to try to salvage a land for peace agreement between Israelis 
and Palestinians. On the eve of his visit, Secretary of State Madeleine 
Albright appealed to the parties to move ahead with their obligations 
under the Wye River accord. VOA's Debra Tate reports. What had been 
planned as a presidential visit to celebrate the progress toward peace 
now appears to be a mission to rescue the process. The trip comes 
amid renewed violence in the region with the parties exchanging recriminations. 
Israel has frozen implementation of the Wye agreement accusing Palestinians 
of violating clauses in the accord. Secretary of State Albright says 
there was never any question the road toward peace would be bumpy. 
While welcoming progress that has been made so far, she called on 
the Palestinians to do more to guarantee security and on the Israelis 
to move ahead with a second troop withdrawal from the West Bank. Both 
sides need to move forward to implement the second phase. The Wye 
agreement must be implemented as signed. That will be Mr. Clinton's 
message when he visits Israel and Palestinian controlled territory 
in the coming days. Debra Tate, VOA News at the White House.
