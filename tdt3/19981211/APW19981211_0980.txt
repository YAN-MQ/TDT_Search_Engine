British Prime Minister Tony Blair battled Friday to persuade his European 
Union colleagues to overturn the planned abolition of tax-free shopping 
in the EU. At a year-end summit dominated by weighty issues like defense 
and reform of the EU's dlrs 100 billion budget, Blair lobbied to reprieve 
the duty-free perks which the 15-nation Union is due to scrap June 
30. Duty-free shopping is immensely popular among Britons who flock 
in their millions to ferry boats crossing the English Channel to buy 
cheap supplies of liquor, cigarettes and perfume. Foreign Secretary 
Robin Cook this week called the proposed ban ``the most visible and 
high-profile (EU) decision'' for the British public. In continental 
nations with lower domestic taxes on alcohol, the duty-free issue 
is less contentious. However, support for saving it is growing among 
EU nations, although Blair does not have the required backing of all 
15. ``I think it is going our way, but it requires unanimity to get 
it changed,'' Blair said. ``That's a pretty tall order and that's 
why I don't give any promises or guarantees.'' France, Germany, Ireland, 
Spain and Luxembourg expressed support for a stay of execution. Denmark 
and the Netherlands stood firmly behind the abolition plan, backed 
by Belgium and Italy. Swedish Prime Minister Goeran Persson reflected 
a commonly held view among other nations. ``I've nothing against duty-free 
being abolished, but there are better causes to fight for,'' he told 
reporters. The EU voted unanimously in 1991 to abolish tax-free shopping, 
claiming it was incompatible with the notion of a borderless EU market. 
Since then, governments have changed in many EU nations and airlines, 
shipping companies and labor unions have lobbied intensely to save 
it. They claim scrapping the dlrs 6.4-billion-a-year duty-free industry 
will push up the cost of travel and throw some 150,000 people out 
of work. Supporters of abolition counter that duty-free operators 
effectively enjoy a subsidy of dlrs 2.2 billion a year by not paying 
duties on their sales, giving them an unfair advantage over other 
retailers. The ban only affects sales for travelers within the EU. 
Those traveling to or from the Union will still be able to enjoy tax 
free shopping.
