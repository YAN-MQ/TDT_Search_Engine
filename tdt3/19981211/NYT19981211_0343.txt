Isolated in a high Rocky Mountain fastness of snow and pine trees, 
this elegant old mining town of 600 people stands only a mile west 
of its blue-collar sister village, Black Hawk, population 150. But 
in this old gold-rush landscape, modern greed over gambling is plunging 
the two villages into a municipal feud worthy of the Hatfields and 
the McCoys. After Colorado voters in 1990 approved limited-stakes 
gambling, which caps bets at $5, Central City residents discovered 
that many gamblers would not drive the extra mile for a slot machine. 
People here grumble that their Black Hawk neighbors erected traffic 
lights and took down highway signs in an underhanded campaign to siphon 
off gamblers who make the 45-minute drive on Route 119, the winding 
canyon road from Denver to Central City. ``Gamblers are basically 
lazy,'' said Gary Kragenbrink, who recently served as a councilman 
in Central City. ``Black Hawk is really enjoying sticking it to Central 
now.'' As the number of casinos has dropped by half in Central City 
and as tiny Black Hawk has embarked on about $500 million in casino 
construction, a 140-year-old municipal rivalry has erupted, pitting 
plans for a ``casino road'' against plans for a ``casino tunnel,'' 
and coming between the two mayors, who happen to be cousins. ``We 
try to stay out of their business,'' said Mayor Don Mattivi of Central 
City, who also said he avoided talking politics with Mayor Kathryn 
Ecckert of Black Hawk. ``We wish they would stay out of ours.'' Although 
Central City once surpassed Black Hawk in gambling revenues, Black 
Hawk has decisively taken the lead. For the year ending in September, 
Central City had $92 million in gambling revenues; Black Hawk had 
$258 million. Taxes from slot machines pay for almost the entire budget 
of Central City, but the number of machines has dropped by a third 
in the last four years, to about 3,000 today. Black Hawk is scheduled 
to open three casinos in the coming months, and should have 9,000 
slot machines by the end of 1999. With a ruthlessness that the gold 
miners might have admired, Black Hawk's casinos have gouged into mountainsides 
for parking, digging at one site below the level of Clear Creek to 
create a watertight garage. When Colorado banned children from casinos, 
Black Hawk responded by making room for a day-care center for the 
children of gambling parents, a commercial exception in a town with 
no gas station, bank or grocery store. In Central City, residents 
now look enviously down Gregory Gulch, where building is under way 
on Las Vegas-style casinos with names like Riviera, Mardi Gras and 
Isle of Capri. Gambling has become so popular that Route 119 has recorded 
the fastest growth of any road in the state in the 1990s, quintupling 
its traffic since 1991, the first year of gambling. In a daring plan 
to clip Black Hawk's wings, Central City started buying and annexing 
land to extend a city ``street'' eight miles across some of the roughest 
mountain terrain in the United States. The $64 million, four-lane 
road would cross county lines to the southeast at 8,500 feet, descend 
1,000 feet on a steep grade and drop gamblers at Interstate 70. It 
would be a safer and shorter alternative to the existing interstate 
link, a dirt road marked on most maps as ``Oh My God Rd.,'' presumably 
for its divine views and unholy hairpin turns. In a counterattack, 
Black Hawk unveiled blueprints for its own secret weapon: a $50 million 
tunnel punched through solid granite. Financed by casinos, the four-lane 
tunnel would speed gamblers 1.3 miles north through a mountain, depositing 
them on a road leading to Black Hawk's busy gambling halls. Undeterred, 
Central City retaliated last month, unveiling maps of land it planned 
to annex to isolate its road from any effort by Black Hawk to build 
a cutoff. In response, Black Hawk revealed that it had secretly paid 
an 85-year-old widow $50,000 to buy mining rights along the route 
of Central City's proposed casino road. ``We've got a big bag of tacks, 
and I have just taken out a handful and spread them out on their road,'' 
chortled Medill Barnes, executive director of the Black Hawk Casino 
Owners Association. With a wink, he declined to reveal if he had bought 
other mining rights along the route, saying only, ``This is war, nuclear 
war.'' The Gilpin Gazette-Crusader, a Central City newspaper that 
broke the mining-claims story last week, used words like ``venal,'' 
``fraudulent'' and ``sham'' to editorialize against ``the last-minute 
land deal.'' The rivalry between the villages dates to 1864, when 
they incorporated within a day of each other. Central City, a mercantile 
and mining center that billed itself as ``the Richest Square Mile 
on Earth,'' encouraged workers from Black Hawk's sulphurous smelters 
to take baths and change their clothes before going to Central City 
to attend church, the Opera House or the Gilpin County courthouse. 
When flush toilets came to the finer homes and hotels here, Central 
City residents knew full well that the waste flowed downhill to Black 
Hawk when they pulled the chain. Because of deforestation around Central 
City's gold mines, floods routinely swept down Gregory Gulch, covering 
Black Hawk's streets in mud and rocks. But now, Central City, which 
once had ambitions to become the capital of the Colorado Territory, 
finds that it is not so central. To some, the proposed eight-mile 
road is Central City's equivalent of a Hail Mary pass in football. 
To pay off municipal bonds, Central City taxes slot machines at a 
rate 50 percent higher than the rate in Black Hawk. But the daily 
yield here, $72 a machine, is almost half the yield in Black Hawk. 
Assessed real-estate values have dropped to $48 million, one-third 
less than the $64 million needed to pay for the road. Mattivi is unfazed, 
saying, ``An extra five-buck drop per machine pays for the road.'' 
Accusing Black Hawk of ``taking advantage of a little old lady with 
three mining claims,'' he vowed: ``They have only succeeded in delaying 
the road for one year. We will condemn the right of way.'' Caught 
in the middle is Luella Thomas, a fifth-generation Central City resident 
who sold Black Hawk the mining claims that her late husband stopped 
working half a century ago. ``I had no idea when they purchased them 
what they were going to do with them,'' Mrs. Thomas fretted. ``I love 
both towns. But I am afraid that in Central City now my name is mud.''
