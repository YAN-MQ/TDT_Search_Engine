From Public Radio International, this is THE WORLD, a co-production 
of the BBC World Service, PRI, and WGBH Boston. It's Friday, December 
11th. I'm Tony Kahn. Today, President Clinton prepares to leave behind 
the mess in Washington for the mess in the Middle East. Also, Augusto 
Pinochet appears in a British court. I think that in that court, invisible, 
intangible but real, are many of the victims; many of my friends are 
there, the people who died in my stead, the people who were killed. 
They're there in that courtroom. And fast food threatens the coffee 
house way of life in Vienna. First, this news. For THE WORLD, this 
is Alan Dow in the BBC newsroom in London.
