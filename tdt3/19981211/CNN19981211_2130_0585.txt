The space shuttle "endeavour" astronauts have wrapped up work on the 
international space station. They closed the last of six hatches between 
the U.S.-made Module unity and russian-built zarya today. The space 
station will stay empty until another construction crew arrives in 
six months. It will take five years and more than 40 shuttle flights 
to complete the project.
