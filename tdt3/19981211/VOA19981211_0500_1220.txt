The United States' attempt to win its third straight President's Cup 
golf title against a non- European international squad got off to 
a rocky start today in Australia. The international squad jumped out 
to a 3-1/2 to 1-1/2 lead as five alternate shot matches were played 
in the hot, wind- blown conditions at the Royal Melbourne Golf Club. 
International's Frank Navelo and Greg Turner defeated Americans Mark 
O'Meara and David Duvall 1 up. Australian Greg Norman, who was instrumental 
in bringing the tournament back to his home country, teamed with Steve 
Elkington to beat Jim Furrick and John Houston 2 up. Norman says playing 
with Elkington worked quite well. It's very, very difficult to get 
in the rhythm in a foursome, but Steve and I know each other's games 
so well; you know, we know when to help each other. We know when just 
to back off and let him -- we'll let each other go. And, you know, 
if we feel, you know, like in certain shots, I say Steve, how far 
do you want it, and you just dial that shot in. Americans Davis Love, 
III and Justin Leonard have their match against Nick Price and Stuart 
Appleby. Leonard says the first round was a learning experience. and 
one this morning, I think off the tees is the critical thing, and 
with a different wind today, we all learned a little bit. In other 
matchups, the U.S. team of Tiger Woods and Fred Couples overpowered 
Ernie Ells and Vijay Singh 5-4. International Sugenki Moriama and 
Craig Perry beat Lee Jansen and Scott Hope 3-2.
