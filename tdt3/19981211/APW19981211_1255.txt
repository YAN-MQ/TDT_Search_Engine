President Boris Yeltsin tried to honor literary giant Alexander Solzhenitsyn 
on his 80th birthday Friday, but the veteran of the Soviet gulags 
refused Russia's highest cultural award. Solzhenitsyn, a longtime 
critic of Yeltsin, thanked the president but said: ``In today's conditions, 
when people are starving and striking just to get their wages, I cannot 
accept this award.'' ``Maybe, maybe, in a long, long time, when Russia 
overcomes its insurmountable problems, my sons may be able to accept 
such an award,'' he said at a Moscow performance of the play ``Sharashka,'' 
based on an adaptation of his novel ``The First Circle.'' Yeltsin 
granted Solzhenitsyn the Order of St. Andrew for ``outstanding service 
to the fatherland and great contributions to world literature,'' presidential 
spokesman Dmitry Yakushkin told reporters. Yeltsin's deputy chief 
of staff, Oleg Sysuyev, told Russia's ORT television station that 
the writer had the right to decline the award. But it is the president's 
duty to ``honor such an outstanding person on his birthday,'' Sysuyev 
said. Solzhenitsyn did accept an award from the Russian Academy of 
Sciences, Russian news agencies reported. He is the author of such 
renowned works as ``One Day in the Life of Ivan Denisovich'' and the 
three-volume ``The Gulag Archipelago,'' which chronicled the atrocities 
in the Soviet prison camps. The reclusive Solzhenitsyn attended a 
party Thursday night at the Swedish Embassy for Nobel laureates and 
chatted amicably with former Soviet leader Mikhail Gorbachev, a man 
he criticized in the past. Solzhenitsyn was held in prison camps for 
eight years, and he turned his experiences into his life's work, winning 
him international fame. Soviet authorities exiled him in 1974 and 
he lived in seclusion in Vermont before returning to post-Soviet Russia 
in 1994. He has continued writing and makes occasional speeches, but 
his influence has waned since the 1960s and 1970s, when he was one 
of the best-known opponents of the Soviet system.
