The perils of American journalism in recent years -- the big, embarrassing 
mistake or outright fraud. It's happening more and more as the world 
of news expands. And now one of broadcast journalism's best known 
programs has been caught in the trap as well -- "60 minutes" and a 
dramatic documentary that was a Full-blown fake. NBC's Ron Allen. 
"60 minutes" made a deal to air excerpts of a British documentary 
-- An inside look at how columbian drug cartels get heroin to London. 
Tonight, a rare glimpse of an age-old smuggling method. In the report, 
the cameras closely follow a drug smuggler, supposedly swallowing 
60 packages of heroin. He then boards a plane bound for London. But 
much of it was fake. We all know that the camera can be made to lie. 
And in this case, it has. British reporter Michael gillard uncovered 
what really happened. The researcher on the original documentary told 
him the smugglers are actors. She hired them. And the heroin is, in 
fact, candy. She claims it was all the idea of documentary producer 
Mark debeaufort. But he stands by much of the story and claims he 
was duped by people working for him. When debeaufort and his crew 
got to Colombia, they couldn't deliver the real thing. And that's 
when the faking began. In the "60 minutes" report and in the documentary, 
this scene is described as an interview with a top Colombian drug 
lord in a secret location. In fact, he is an actor. The secret location 
is debeaufort's hotel room. A British investigative panel concludes 
the program is so untrue, it never should have been broadcast. As 
for "60 minutes," which aired part of the documentary, executive producer 
Don Hewitt also blames the British producer debeaufort and himself 
for getting conned. We brought him to New York. We talked to him. 
He -- we got snowed. We believed this guy. They're not the only ones 
fooled. Millions of viewers saw the same documentary in 14 countries 
-- so convincing, it won eight international awards even though it 
was full of deception. Even a gold-plated newsmagazine like "60 minutes" 
has fallen into the trap of letting outsiders do some of its work, 
work that has now proven to be horribly embarrassing. So embarrassing 
that coming up on next Sunday's "60 minutes," hewitt will make his 
first appearance ever on the program -- to apologize. Ron Allen, NBC 
news, London.
