Eliza Petrescu, an eyebrow designer, doesn't stand on ceremony, or 
even bother with hello. ``We are going to have to let those eyebrows 
grow!'' she said, greeting a new client who seemed to be expecting 
a more genial ``good morning.'' But then, eyebrow grooming as practiced 
by Ms. Petrescu is not for the faint of heart. She can strip, pluck 
and prune brows to bonsai perfection in seven minutes flat. For that 
skill, clients are willing to overlook a manner that can be as sharp 
as her flashing metal tweezers. On a sunny morning recently _ Ms. 
Petrescu's first at the newly opened Avon Centre Spa in Trump Tower 
_ anxious women passed through her wax-sticky fingers at an alarming 
clip. Ms. Petrescu had been on vacation since defecting from the John 
Barrett Salon a month earlier, and her followers had been getting 
shaggy. She sees 40 to 60 people a day, with a celebrity roster that 
includes Jennifer Grey, Madonna, Vanessa Redgrave, Natasha Richardson 
and Ms. Richardson's husband, Liam Neeson. She also plucks fashion 
editors and models and pays house calls on socialites like Denise 
Rich. New clients often wait three months for a 10-minute appointment. 
The smart ones book monthly visits a year in advance. With the help 
of hot wax, curved scissors and a pair of tweezers, Ms. Petrescu, 
an energetic former accountant who emigrated from Romania in 1981, 
is capable of giving arch to a brow that's as flat as the plains, 
or shadowing in a meager line. She can compensate for lopsidedness 
caused by plastic surgery, or advise on subtle matters of coloration. 
(Lighter hair, she maintains, demands brows that are a shade darker.) 
She can make a long face fuller or a round face thinner, and can open 
up eyes that have been hooded for years. And she is fair in her tyranny, 
scolding the bushy and the bald alike if they tamper at home with 
her work. Ms. Petrescu, 46, who has been compared to both a pussycat 
and Saddam Hussein, makes no apologies for being an eyebrow bully. 
``I am strict,'' she said, her manner as crisp as her lab coat. ``I 
know best. Why should I discuss what a client wants with her? When 
you go to a doctor, you don't tell him how to treat you. It's the 
same. I know about this.'' Clients put up with Ms. Petrescu's dictates 
because she is no ordinary aesthetician. ``I've been going to her 
for years,'' Ms. Richardson said. ``Now I'm addicted. Having had people 
take off half my eyebrow in one quick rip, I know how easy it is to 
do it badly. But she's fast, and she takes her work very seriously. 
She's simply the best.'' That's why, on Ms. Petrescu's first day at 
the Avon Centre _ which began, as all her workdays do, at 7:45 a.m. 
_ there was palpable relief in the air. ``Oh, thank God I found you!'' 
said one customer, a wine importer, who declined to be named lest 
her employer discover her real motive for visiting midtown at midday. 
``I had to call four different people to track you down, but you're 
back. That's all that matters.'' Ms. Petrescu smiled tightly. ``Did 
you touch your eyebrows while I was away?'' she asked in accented 
English, peering down at the woman's forehead with raptorlike intensity. 
``Are you kidding?'' the woman answered, laughing nervously. ``I did 
nothing. Like I want to get yelled at?'' To stay on her good side, 
clients woo her with flowers, theater tickets, and baskets of fancy 
food. One woman even stationed herself on the street outside the Avon 
Centre while it was still under construction, hoping to speak to someone 
who could assure her that the appointments she made at Ms. Petrescu's 
former salon would be honored at the new salon. ``It isn't easy getting 
in here,'' said Lauren Malis, who works for the state Economic Development 
Department, after being upbraided by Ms. Petrescu for plucking out 
two hairs deemed crucial to the arch of her left brow. ``But when 
I have my eyebrows done, people really think I look different. They 
don't know why, but they notice.'' Like a podiatrist who sees his 
patients in terms of their feet, Ms. Petrescu is a miniaturist, perceiving 
the spectrum of human types through the fur above their eyes. ``I 
can see personalities in a woman's eyebrows,'' she said while making 
corrections on a client whose eyebrows were thin and uneven. ``When 
they overpluck, they are nervous. When they have hair everywhere, 
it means they are laid back. When I see a manicured brow, I see a 
balanced person.'' ``If you have a good eyebrow,'' she continued, 
brushing and trimming a new client, ``you don't even need much makeup. 
What I look at is the distance between the brows, the shape of the 
arch, and the end of the brow. I keep it natural, but also clean and 
elongated. It's all about the geometry of the face. You have to have 
an eye for it.'' Her geometry lessons aren't cheap. She charges $60 
for an initial shaping, $34 for return visits. Some patrons complain 
of a hidden cost. ``It hurt like hell!'' said one, reached by telephone, 
who asked not to be named for fear she might not be given another 
appointment. ``Afterwards, there were tears streaming down my face, 
and when Eliza saw me crying she just said, `Oh, the little baby's 
crying.' ``She was half joking, but the weirdness of it all struck 
me. I mean, this person _ I didn't know she was famous then _ was 
very brusque. She made fun of me. But it made a huge difference to 
the way I look. I would actually do it again.'' Amy Taran Astley, 
the beauty editor at Vogue, said Ms. Petrescu's highhandedness is 
not unusual in her field. ``All high-profile beauty people behave 
like that,'' she said. ``Eliza can be forceful. But you do look better 
afterwards, so I think women feel it's worth it.''
