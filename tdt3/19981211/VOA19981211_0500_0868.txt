First lady Hillary Rodham Clinton has condemned human rights abuses 
against women and girls in Afghanistan. She made her comments during 
a White House observance of International Human Rights Day, and VOA's 
Deborah Tate reports. Ms. Clinton, who has long worked to advance 
the rights of women, offered a stinging rebuke of Afghanistan's ruling 
Taleyban militia for its treatment of the country's female citizens. 
Perhaps the most egregious and systematic trampling of fundamental 
human rights of any person is taking place in Afghanistan today against 
women under the iron rule of the Taleyban. Where women used to make 
up 40 percent of Afghan doctors, they are now forbidden to practice 
medicine. Where women were once half the teachers, they are now barred 
from teaching. Where girls used to go to school, the school doors 
are now slammed shut. With President Clinton standing by her side 
preparing to present awards to several human rights campaigners, Ms. 
Clinton recalled anecdotes about women dying because of a lack of 
medical care and beaten for exposing their ankles in violation of 
the Taleyban's conservative Islamic dress code. She said such abuses 
must not be tolerated. We cannot allow these terrible crimes against 
women and girls, and truly against all of humanity, to continue with 
impunity. We must all make it unmistakably clear this terrible suffering 
inflicted on the women and girls of Afghanistan is not cultural; it 
is criminal, and we must do everything we can in our power to stop 
it. Ms. Clinton says the United States is committed to expanding its 
support for education and health training for Afghan women and girls, 
programs for which Washington contributed $3.9 million this years.
