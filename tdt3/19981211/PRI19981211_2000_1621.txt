Whether it's business or pleasure, praise or complaint, let us know 
what you think of our coverage here on THE WORLD. You can call us 
at 617-868-5750. That's 617-868-5750. And reach us in cyberspace if 
you prefer. Our e-mail address is theworld, that's one word, @pri.org. 
Once again, theworld@pri.org. And you can always join us online at 
www.theworld.org. Again, www.theworld.org. Up ahead, today's top headlines 
on PRI, Public Radio International. I'm Tony Kahn. Ahead on THE WORLD, 
the disappearing writers of Iran. And New Yoricans, the New Yorkers 
who come back home to Puerto Rico. I'm so happy to be here facing 
all these cold shoulders from the home boys, sort of -- the people 
who live here who think that I'm not Puerto Rican enough. First, this 
news. For THE WORLD, this is Alan Dow in the BBC newsroom in London.
