Far-right leader Jean-Marie Le Pen on Friday further punished his 
longtime lieutenant and heir apparent for defying him, suspending 
his party membership. The National Front leader also appealed to his 
party's rank-and-file not to fall into the ``trap'' his rival, Bruno 
Megret, has laid with his appeal for an urgent congress to determine 
the party's future. ``I have never lied to you, never abandoned you, 
never betrayed you,'' Le Pen said. He asked National Front members 
across the country not to sign petitions calling for the congress. 
Already this week, Le Pen had dismissed Bruno Megret from his job 
as No. 2 man, stripping his title of general delegate. On Friday, 
at party headquarters in Saint-Cloud, he announced: ``At my request, 
the executive bureau has suspended the membership (of Megret and four 
others), and is waiting for them to appear before our disciplinary 
institution.'' The leadership feud has split the National Front into 
two warring camps. Megret's camp _ which has moved into its own building 
_ claims it has almost all the 10,000 signatures necessary to hold 
a congress. According to party rules, 20 percent of the 50,000 or 
so members is enough. ``This is not just about the National Front 
_ this is about France,'' Le Pen said. ``France is in danger. Yes, 
she is in grave danger.'' He noted that last year he was elected president 
of the party for three years, and denounced the ``scandalous campaign 
of disinformation'' that is seeking to destabilize him. Among the 
others Le Pen suspended was Serge Martinez, a former Le Pen loyalist 
who on Monday made the original call for a party congress and was 
immediately fired as chief of personnel. Also suspended was Philippe 
Olivier, the companion of Le Pen's daughter, Marie-Caroline Le Pen, 
who has been accused by her father of betraying him.
