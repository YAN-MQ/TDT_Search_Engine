After the Judiciary committee gets done with deciding whether or not 
to recommend impeachment, what does the full house do with the matter? 
Charles Bierbauer takes a look. Mr. Clinton renewed his lies -- The 
impeachment charges have been laid out -- perjury, obstruction, abuse 
of power. If this isn't enough, what is? How far can the standard 
be lowered without completely compromising the credibility of the 
office for all time? But the role of the house in impeaching a president 
is still subject of debate. Contrary to having the house be a mere 
rubber stamp for sending allegations of wrongdoing to the Senate, 
the constitution actually requires that the house, as well as the 
Senate, look to the same evidence with the same standard. The democrats' 
argument against impeachment focuses on the likelihood that even if 
the house impeaches, the Senate will not convict, though the evidence 
may be the same. I am sorry to say that we've fallen far short of 
carrying out our constitutional duties. The majority have simply rubber 
stamped the uncross-examined, untested, double hearsay, yes, triple 
hearsay, and conclusions of the independent counsel. The constitution 
tends to tell Congress what to do, though not always how to do it. 
The house shall have the sole power of impeachment, the Senate to 
try all impeachments. Assigning to one the right to accuse, and to 
the other, the right to judge. The framers of this constitution were 
very astute. They did not make the accusers and the judges the same 
person. Democrats argue the result may be neither removal from office, 
as some republicans seek, nor punishment of the president, as even 
many democrats want. Impeachment is not a means to punish the president. 
Impeachment is not a means to send a message to our children that 
the president isn't above the law. There are better ways to do that. 
Democrats prefer censure as a punishment suited to president clinton's 
past actions. But they argue impeachment is a constitutional protection 
against a President not fit to govern in the future. Charles Bierbauer, 
CNN, Washington.
