A group of 150 Serb civilians marched to an ethnic Albanian rebel 
headquarters in Kosovo Thursday to ask for information about dozens 
of their missing family members. Philip Smucker reports from the town 
of Dragelbelia that the demonstration resulted in an unusual face-to-face 
meeting between Serbs and Kosovo's ethnic Albanians. About 1,000 Serb 
demonstrators set out from the town of Haravaha early Thursday, but 
Serb police and international monitors convinced many of them to turn 
back for safety reasons. British peace monitors have been told by 
commanders in the rebel Kosovo Liberation Army, KLA, that it was too 
dangerous for the Serbs to march to Dragelbelia. The crowd of 150 
Serb civilians led by the police arrived at 2 o'clock in the afternoon. 
KLA fighters poised their guns over stone walls as the Serbs stopped 
on top of a hill. The Serb police left the civilians to negotiate 
between themselves. British and American monitors helped shuttle Serb 
and ethnic Albanian representatives to a burned out gasoline station 
a few hundred meters from the rebel base. Serb representatives told 
the Albanians that they believed Serb hostages are being held in Dragelbelia. 
The Albanians denied that any Serb civilians are being held. They 
also said that ethnic Albanians have nothing against the Serb civilians, 
only against the Serbian government. The Albanian representatives 
asked about 1,000 male ethnic Albanians who have been seized by Serbian 
police and remain in detention. The face-to-face meeting about missing 
people was one of the first of its kind in Kosovo, and a senior British 
monitor called the meeting a major step towards helping to resolve 
the question of detained and missing persons in the Serb province.
