Meanwhile, the president has made what observers were calling a last 
ditch effort to head off that vote by the House of Representatives 
Judiciary Committee. Speaking just moments ago at the White House 
rose garden, Mr. Clinton expressed his profound sorrow for his actions 
in the Monica Lewinsky sex and cover up scandal. What I want the American 
people to know, what I want the Congress to know is that I am profoundly 
sorry for all I have done wrong in words and deeds. I never should 
have misled the country, the Congress, my friends, or my family. Quite 
simply, I gave in to my shame. Mr. Clinton admitted doing things that 
are wrong, but he specifically did not admit to breaking the law.
