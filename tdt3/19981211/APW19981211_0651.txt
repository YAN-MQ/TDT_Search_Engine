Authorities are preventing supporters of hard-line Palestinians from 
leaving for neighboring Syria to attend a meeting aimed at countering 
Yasser Arafat's peacemaking efforts with Israel, a hard-line official 
said Friday. Authorities have turned back at the border at least 15 
of the 67 Jordanians who had announced plans to attend the meeting 
in Damascus, Bahat Abu-Gharbiyeh, a spokesman for delegation, said. 
He said officials at the Ramtha border checkpoint ``have been turning 
away our colleagues,'' claiming they are banned from leaving the country 
because of various charges pending against them. Government officials 
were not immediately available for comments. Abu-Gharbiyeh said less 
than five managed to cross the border. Among those blocked was Layla 
Khaled, a Palestinian woman activist who had hijacked several civilian 
planes in the 70s in an attempt to bring the world's attention to 
the plight of the Palestinian people. Most of the delegates from Jordan 
are Jordanian hard-liners who also opposed King Hussein's 1994 peace 
treaty with Israel. The Saturday meeting in Damascus was called by 
10 hard-line Palestinian factions opposed to a settlement with Israel. 
The meeting will urge other Palestinian officials to boycott the Monday 
session of the Palestinian National Council, or parliament, in Gaza 
City at which mainstreams Palestinians are expected to nullify those 
parts of the Palestinian National Charter that call for the destruction 
of Israel. On Thursday, another decision-making body, the Palestine 
Central Council, voted to remove the clauses. The amendment is required 
by the Israeli-Palestinian peace accord of Wye River between Palestinian 
leader Arafat and Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu.
