Declining food and energy costs led to a surprising drop in producer 
prices last month. We know manufacturing is quite weak. In fact, it's 
in decline. And to see weak producer numbers in that kind of environment's 
really not surprising. But we're also seeing soft cpi numbers, particularly 
in the service sector, and that's unusual when you're operating so 
close to full employment as we are today. That cpi report, by the 
way, comes next week.
