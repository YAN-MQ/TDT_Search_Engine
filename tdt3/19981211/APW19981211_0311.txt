Russia's economic crisis has brought the privatization of major state 
assets to a virtual halt, and revenues this year are only a fraction 
of those forecast, the government said Friday. The government had 
hoped to earn 8.1 billion rubles (about dlrs 400 million) by auctioning 
off state property, but it has earned only 1.4 billion rubles (dlrs 
70 million) through October, the Finance Ministry said. The country's 
economic downturn has chased away foreign investors, and the government 
has decided to put off auctions of two large companies, the Rosneft 
oil company and the Svyazinvest communications firm. The government 
is still planning to auction off a 2.5 percent stake in the gas monopoly 
Gazprom later this month, the Interfax news agency reported. The delay 
in selling state assets has contributed to the government's chronic 
cash shortages. It owes billions of rubles (dollars) to workers, pensioners 
and foreign creditors. The government is currently working out an 
austere budget for next year, when the economy is expected to continue 
shrinking. Russia's draft budget provides for repaying only dlrs 9.5 
billion of the dlrs 17.5 billion in foreign debt that falls due next 
year. That means the country will seek restructuring of the additional 
dlrs 8 billion. ``Without the debt burden being eased, Russia in 1999, 
2000 and the following years really just cannot exist. It's as simple 
as that,'' Finance Minister Mikhail Zadornov said Thursday. ``We are 
counting on understanding by creditors and investors in restructuring 
both domestic and foreign debts,'' Zadornov said. But creditors have 
not yet expressed a willingness to rework the debts Russia already 
has, and the prospect for more foreign loans is hazy at best. A dlrs 
22.6 billion loan package put together by the International Monetary 
Fund has been frozen since August's debt default and ruble devaluation. 
The IMF has demanded that Russia draw up a sound budget as a requirement 
for more loans, and specifically warned against factoring in foreign 
loans that had yet to materialize. The 1999 budget is a key test for 
Prime Minister Yevgeny Primakov, who was appointed in September after 
the previous government devalued the ruble and defaulted on some debts, 
sending the economy into a freefall. The budget was also drawn up 
in the near-total absence of President Boris Yeltsin, who has frequently 
been ill in recent months and has not been involved in the day-to-day 
business of government.
