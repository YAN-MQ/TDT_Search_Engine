Aid workers said Friday that Senegalese troops were blocking convoys 
carrying food and medicine from crossing the border into Guinea-Bissau, 
where thousands of people were in need of relief aid due to a five-month 
conflict. Some 3,000 Senegalese troops have been deployed in the tiny 
West African country of Guinea-Bissau since June, when they arrived 
to help President Joao Bernardo Vieira contain a military rebellion. 
``The Senegalese won't let us through,'' said Serafim Jorge, a spokesman 
for International Medical Assistance, or AMI, a Portuguese relief 
group working in Guinea-Bissau. ``It's faster and easier to fly (supplies) 
from Dakar or Lisbon,'' Jorge said in Lisbon. AMI recently flew six 
tons of food and medicines from Portugal's capital, Lisbon, into the 
town of Gabu in eastern Guinea-Bissau, some 50 kilometers (30 miles) 
from the Senegalese border, he said. About Guinea-Bissau's 1 million 
inhabitants were displaced by fighting which started in June 7 when 
disenchanted colonial war veterans rebelled against Vieira's allegedly 
corrupt regime. Vieira and rebel leader Brig. Ansumane Mane recently 
agreed to cease hostilities and form a government of national unity. 
The pact also called for the withdrawal of Senegalese troops and the 
deployment of a West African peacekeeping force, due to arrive later 
this month.
