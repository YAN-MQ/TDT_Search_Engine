Recent flops at the box office will drag universal studios' film division 
to a $65 million loss for the current second quarter. That's according 
to universal's parent company, seagram. Industry analysts blame the 
losses on disappointing performances by the recently released film 
"meet Joe black." It has grossed only $39 million. And by this past 
weekend, "babe: pig in the city" had grossed just over $11 million. 
The budgets for both films are believed to have been in the $80 million 
to $90 million range.
