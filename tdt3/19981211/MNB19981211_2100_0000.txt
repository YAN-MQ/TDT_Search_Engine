What I want the American people to know, what I want the Congress 
to know is that I am profoundly sorry for all I have done wrong in 
words and deeds. But apparently that was too little and it came too 
late to stop whafts happening in the house. Minutes after a dramatic 
speech by the president here in Washington today, the house committee 
votes to impeach him. Tonight, there are three -- President Andrew 
Johnson, Richard Nixon, and now Bill Clinton in all of U.S. history, 
a short list of presidents who have been targets of the most sweeping 
power Congress has at its disposal. And good evening to you from Capitol 
Hill.
