American David Ishii shot a 3-under-par 68 Friday to hold on to a 
share of the lead after the second round of the season-ending Okinawa 
Open. Ishii, seeking his first victory in four years, scored three 
birdies in a bogey-free round at the 6,359-yard (5,787-meter), par-71 
Daikyo Country Club course. Takashi Kanemoto shot the day's best round 
_ a 65 _ to move into a tie with Ishii. Kanemoto, who has yet to win 
a tour title in five years as a pro, sank six birdies and no bogeys 
to join Ishii at 135 after two rounds. Akihito Yokoyama was one stroke 
behind the leaders at 6-under after he carded a 67 Friday. Australian 
Brad Andrews was a further stroke behind along with Japan Open champion 
Hidemichi Tanaka. Richard Backwell, also from Australia, was tie for 
sixth with Masayuki Kawamura at 138. A total of 62 players will advance 
to the final two rounds of the 80 million-yen (dlrs 680,000) tournament. 
The winner will collect 14.4 million yen (dlrs 123,000).
