This is how it is to be Bill Clinton these days: --Describing your 
desolation over the damage you have done in the office you dreamed 
of from boyhood _ only minutes before being dismissed as a liar and 
becoming the third president recommended for impeachment by the House 
Judiciary Committee. --Giving baseball's Iron Man, Cal Ripken Jr., 
and his wife and kids a tour of your treasured Oval Office on a bright 
Friday afternoon, while congressmen a few blocks away debate precisely 
how _ in those same rooms _ you touched a young woman not your wife. 
--Giving an address on your hopes for peace in Northern Ireland and 
Cyprus, then pulling a Republican House member aside to ask how you 
can stay the full House from delivering the historic blow of impeachment. 
--Holding a round of cheery Christmas parties where your guests gobble 
your baby lamb chops and speculate, out of your earshot, whether you 
will keep your job. --Attending a private viewing with old friends 
of ``Enemy of the State,'' even as you are being accused of being 
just that. Clinton is as famous for compartmentalizing duty and scandal 
as he is notorious for having to do so. For eleven months, he has 
resolutely plugged away at his job and smiled for the cameras as the 
details of his affair with Monica Lewinsky seeped and then streamed 
out. This week _ in the holiday season, on the cusp of the second 
presidential impeachment vote ever in the House _ the polar ends of 
Bill Clinton's presidency stretched farther apart than they ever had. 
Friday, in the Rose Garden, he abruptly brought them together when 
he addressed the nation. ``There is no greater agony,'' he said of 
the pain he has caused his family he said in the brief address he 
decided on Thursday night to address doubts that he was preoccupied 
by anything except budget meetings and Christmas shopping. A trip 
backward through the week, however, suggests that the possibility 
of impeachment has been the thread binding his busy days together. 
Clinton attended two funerals, one for a mentor in Arkansas and one 
for his vice president's father; he gave an award to Bill Cosby and 
accepted one for his work in Northern Ireland. He beamed for hundreds 
of grip-and-grin photographs, and sang along _ ``ParrUM-pah-pah-pum'' 
_ to ``The Little Drummer Boy.'' All the while, Clinton's friends 
and associates say, he was fretting about the judgment of the House, 
and of history. Late last week, he was deeply discouraged _ as down 
as he had ever been seen, one Clinton associate said _ but his spirits 
rebounded somewhat as he came to believe his fortunes were improving. 
``Obviously he's concerned about the whole impeachment question,'' 
said Rev. Philip J. Wogaman of the Foundry United Methodist Church, 
who has been providing spiritual advice to Clinton. ``And he's distressed 
about his own behavior that led to it, there's no fudging on that.'' 
But, he added, ``Even if the worst comes, and of course he hopes it 
doesn't, his life will go on, and he feels that, too.'' On Thursday, 
as Republican and Democratic lawyers presented their final arguments, 
Clinton's distinct worlds seemed to touch, if glancingly. He had gone 
to the Department of Agriculture to unveil a portrait of his old friend 
and former cabinet secretary, Michael Espy. Espy has said Clinton 
made him a promise when he resigned as agriculture secretary four 
years ago, but he and the White House have refused to disclose it. 
After the prayers and gospel singing, Clinton stepped up to the microphone. 
He referred to Espy's acquittal this month by a jury on corruption 
charges brought by an independent counsel. ``With his head held high, 
he persevered and he triumphed,'' the president said. He quoted Isaiah: 
``Be not afraid. I have redeemed you.'' And, not incidentally, Clinton 
made a point of thanking Espy's lawyers. ``They did a heck of a job,'' 
he said, and the audience applauded. ``So here he is,'' one of those 
lawyers, Reid Weingarten, said later. ``Up on the Hill they're saying 
all kinds of horrible things about him, and he was so happy for Mike. 
I mean, who knows with Clinton, but I had a sense that for that moment 
he was believing and feeling everything he was saying, and that must 
be what gets him through the day.'' That night, Clinton decided to 
make another public apology, and began making notes at the White House 
residence for the remarks that he delivered in the Rose Garden Friday 
afternoon. Otherwise, Clinton left it to his lawyers to defend him 
publicly. He received regular briefings on the progress of his defense, 
and he questioned aides who were not involved in damage control about 
how they thought he was doing. But he has no television in the Oval 
Office, and he did not watch the hearings during the day, associates 
said. On Wednesday, as the White House began its second day of defense, 
Clinton brought the family of an old friend, Sen. Dale Bumpers, into 
the Oval Office. ``We were in there a solid 30 minutes on a day like 
that and you'd never know anything was wrong,'' said Bumpers' son, 
Brent Bumpers, a Little Rock lawyer. He said that the president let 
all six grandchildren sit in his chair and ``spent five minutes telling 
us the story of his desk, the whole history of the ship that brought 
over the wood that made the desk.'' ``Three, two, one,'' the president 
counted later that evening, even as the House Judiciary Committee 
was toting up four draft articles of impeachment against him. ``Light 
the tree!'' On Tuesday _ one of several late nights for him this week 
_ Clinton gave two speeches. In one, at a ``Peace on Earth'' gala 
held by a group called Peace Links, he offered a wistful recollection 
of small town life in Arkansas. There, he said, ``people knew about 
you, all about you. And they loved you anyway.'' In the second speech, 
an acceptance of the peace award, he said: ``As long as I am president, 
I will do everything I can to advance the cause of peace, democracy 
and human rights.'' He later pulled aside Rep. Peter T. King, a New 
York Republican who opposes impeachment, to talk about Northern Ireland 
_ and to ask what he needed to do to rally support in the House. ``If 
I didn't know any better or didn't know the topic we were talking 
about, I wouldn't have realized how important it was,'' King said. 
``He was very calm and very controlled. He was genuinely concerned, 
but he was not showing any panic.'' One person familiar with their 
half-hour conversation said, ``King told him, he had to reach out 
to other Republicans to find out what they wanted, that he had to 
contact any of them that he had a relationship with.'' This person 
said that King told the president that many Republicans were upset 
at his answers to 81 questions submitted to the House Judiciary Committee 
and that he ``had to work on them.'' Some Republicans seemed to compartmentalize 
his troubles as much as the president himself. Speaking Tuesday at 
a conference convened by the White House to discuss fixing the Social 
Security system, Rep. Clay Shaw, a Republican who says he's undecided 
on impeachment, compared Clinton to President Nixon. In a good way.
