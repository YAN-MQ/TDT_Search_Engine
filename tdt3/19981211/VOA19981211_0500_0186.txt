Russian President Boris Yeltzin has returned to the Kremlin for the 
first time since a short working visit Monday when he fired his long-time 
chief of staff. The Kremlin said today the president may hold several 
meetings, but offered no other details of his first day back from 
2 days at his country residence outside Moscow. Mr. Yeltzin has been 
recovering there since Wednesday's release from the hospital where 
he spent 2 weeks in treatment for pneumonia.
