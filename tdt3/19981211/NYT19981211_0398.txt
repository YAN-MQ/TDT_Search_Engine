At this time two years ago, Gary Brown was doing nothing. He had quit 
pro football, and he had no job, no ambition and no recriminations. 
Fortunately for him and the New York Giants, he also was bored. Fast 
forward to Friday, with the Giants (5-8) preparing for Sunday's game 
here against the Denver Broncos (13-0). The Giants' running back will 
be the same Gary Brown, who has 736 yards rushing this season, ninth 
best in the National Football Conference. Brown has his priorities 
in order. He is 29 and a seventh-year pro from Penn State. At 5 feet 
11 inches and 230 pounds, he is at the top of his game. He showed 
that in the Giants' 23-19 victory over the Arizona Cardinals last 
Sunday, when he rushed 25 times for 124 yards, the most by a Giant 
in three years. ``I like him,'' Giants coach Jim Fassel said after 
Friday's practice. ``I like the way he's coming along. I like what 
he's done here.'' Fassel also likes what an alert front office did 
in acquiring Brown. For a time, Brown seemed like a lost cause. He 
played five seasons for the Houston Oilers, including a 1993 season 
in which he rushed for 1,002 yards. But he injured his right ankle 
in 1994 and his left knee in 1995, and his career screeched to a stop. 
``Those injuries washed out two seasons,'' Brown said. ``I was frustrated, 
so in 1996 I just sat it out. I just wasn't enjoying football. It's 
odd, but those things happen. Everybody goes through letdowns during 
their life. Sometimes you've got to go through adversity before you 
know what to do. ``I sat around the whole season. I wasn't working, 
just relaxing, and toward the end it got boring. So before the playoffs, 
I told my agent, Tony Agnone, that I wanted to play again. He got 
me to San Diego, and I rushed for 945 yards there last year, but they 
wanted to do something else this year. Dallas, Cincinnati and the 
Giants were interested in me, and I chose the Giants because they 
were close to my home in Williamsport, Pa., and it was a good opportunity.'' 
The Giants needed help at running back. Tiki Barber was erratic and 
not built for heavy duty. Tyrone Wheatley, who had the size, was often 
nicked, and the coaches questioned his dedication. So during April's 
draft, the Giants moved. They agreed with Agnone on a modest contract 
for Brown of $325,000 for one year. One reason for Brown's success 
has been his fumble-proof game. Since December 1993, after the last 
carry of his last game for the Oilers, he has had 728 rushes and 59 
receptions without a fumble. After this season, he becomes a free 
agent. ``I can't give you any reason why I wouldn't want him back 
next year,'' Fassel said. And Giants executive vice president John 
Mara said: ``He's someone we're interested in keeping. He has had 
a productive year, in a year when the offense hasn't been productive.'' 
Brown said he wanted to remain a Giant. ``Of course I want to come 
back,'' he said. ``I enjoy it here. I enjoy being close to home.'' 
If a new contract is worked out, as everyone thinks it will, the Giants 
will retain their premier runner. How good is Brown? In the words 
of Tito Wooten, the safety who plays against him every day in practice, 
``When he runs, the first man who reaches him is going to take punishment.'' 
Brown agrees. Listen to this autobiographical scouting report: ``On 
the field, I'm a strong inside runner, with a lot of power inside. 
People underestimate my quickness. I can take chunks of yardage if 
you give the ball to me. Off the field, I'm just a laid-back, easy 
guy, not complicated. This is my life. I love to play the game.'' 
EXTRA POINTS --JIM FASSEL downgraded defensive tackle ROBERT HARRIS 
(strained left calf) and running back TYRONE WHEATLEY (strained hip 
flexor) from questionable to very doubtful for Sunday's game. CHRISTIAN 
PETER will start for Harris. Wheatley has been inactive for much of 
the season. --After Friday's practice, MIKE CHERRY, a backup quarterback, 
threw passes to JOHN FASSEL, the coach's 6-foot-4{-inch son. The younger 
Fassel, soon to graduate from Weber State, is a wide receiver who 
will play in the Blue-Gray game Christmas Day in Montgomery, Ala.
