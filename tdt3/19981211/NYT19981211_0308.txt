The first of two NASA science probes embarked Friday on a 416-million-mile 
voyage to Mars, catapulted from Earth by a Boeing Delta 2 rocket. 
The spacecraft, called Mars Climate Orbiter, is programmed to make 
the first full-scale study of Martian weather. It should settle into 
a Mars orbit 260 miles above the planet in September, followed closely 
by a companion spacecraft, Mars Polar Lander, which is scheduled to 
be launched on Jan. 3 atop an identical Delta 2 rocket. Their $356 
million mission: Find water. The orbiter was to have been launched 
on Thursday, but engineers needed a day to solve an on-board computer 
software problem that was discovered in a routine pre-flight test. 
``We have acquired the spacecraft signal,'' Bruce Buckingham, a space 
agency spokesman, said when the probe escaped Earth's gravity about 
50 minutes after it was launched at 1:56 p.m. from the Kennedy Space 
Center here. ``Climate Orbiter is on its way to the red planet.'' 
The orbiter is the third in a series of nine probes to be launched 
by the National Aeronautics and Space Administration through 2005, 
with the goal of returning a sample of Martian soil to Earth. The 
first two probes, Mars Global Surveyor and Mars Pathfinder, which 
carried a rock-exploring rover, arrived on Mars last year. NASA tentatively 
plans eight dual-spacecraft missions over the next 15 years to search 
for living organisms and to scout suitable landing sites for a human 
expedition. Together, Mars Climate Orbiter and Mars Polar Lander will 
look for water in the Martian soil and atmosphere. ``If you want to 
look for life, either fossilized life or extant life, on another planet, 
you have to follow the water,'' said Edward Weiler, NASA's associate 
administrator for space science. ``That's what these two missions 
are all about.'' Unlike earlier NASA probes, which gathered weather 
information over limited regions of the planet, Mars Climate Orbiter 
will look at the entire planet. The orbiter will track seasonal changes 
as well as the movement of water vapor and dust, observing how moisture 
evaporates from the ground and migrates through the air for an entire 
Martian year _ 687 Earth days. Before it begins its work as a weather 
satellite, the orbiter will act as a radio relay for Mars Polar Lander. 
The lander is designed to parachute lightly to the Martian surface 
in December 1999 after releasing two basketball-sized probes that 
will crash-land and drill beneath the surface near the planet's south 
pole. The lander itself will use a robot arm to dig up soil and measure 
its water content. For about three months _ longer, if it is able 
_ the lander will beam images and data through the orbiter back to 
Earth.
