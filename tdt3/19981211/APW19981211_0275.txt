An ethnic Albanian in Kosovo, who reportedly was a member of the rebel 
Kosovo Liberation Army, was sentenced Friday to 13 years in prison 
for ``terrorism,'' the Tanjug news agency reported. The district court 
in the town of Pec said Naim Zejnaj, 23, took part in an armed attack 
on a police convoy in western Kosovo in May in which eight Serbian 
policemen were wounded, Tanjug said. The gunmen, belonging to the 
KLA rebel group fighting for secession of Kosovo, used automatic rifles, 
machine guns and mortars in the attack. Similar KLA attacks on Serbian 
police prompted a massive crackdown against the rebels earlier this 
year in which hundreds of people were killed and up to 300,000 left 
homeless. Hundreds of ethnic Albanians in Kosovo are awaiting trials 
on charges similar to those faced by Zejnaj.
