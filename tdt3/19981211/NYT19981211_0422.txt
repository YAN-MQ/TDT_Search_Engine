The corporate earnings pre-announcement season is opening on a sour 
note with bad news from the likes of Merck, Coca-Cola, Boeing, Newell 
and Sears, Roebuck, as well as from several utility companies that 
have been hurt by the unseasonably warm weather. The financial crisis 
in Asia and elsewhere is an aggravating problem for some, like Boeing. 
But for others, like Newell, a maker of consumer products, it may 
be that the slowdown is finally emerging in the United States. Newell 
said last week that sales had slumped for its Calphalon cookware and 
Rolodex files. But investors are going to have trouble sorting out 
how Wall Street analysts think fourth-quarter profits will finally 
shake out when the earnings announcements are made early next year. 
As of now, they can get two distinctly different signals from the 
most closely watched firms that collect Wall Street earnings forecasts. 
IBES International says that the analysts' earnings forecasts it compiles 
for the 500 companies in the Standard &AMP; Poor's index indicate 
that overall operating profits will fall 0.5 percent in the fourth 
quarter, compared with the period in 1997. With the decline of 6.2 
percent in the third quarter, this would be the first two-quarter 
decline in earnings since 1991. But the First Call Corp. says the 
analysts it tracks predict that overall operating earnings will grow 
by 4.5 percent in the fourth quarter. That would not be a bad rebound 
from the 3.1 percent decline that First Call calculated for the third 
quarter. Charles Hill, First Call's research director, expects the 
final number to be lower, but still around 4 percent. (Coke's own 
earnings downgrading Friday is in the IBES number and will lower First 
Call's this week.) One reason for the gap is that some of the analysts 
are different. First Call, for example, does not use earnings estimates 
from analysts at Standard &AMP; Poor's. The policies at each firm 
are different for updating forecasts when analysts change their numbers. 
But the main difference seems to be how each firm compares the current 
quarter with the previous one. IBES compares the earnings estimates 
for the 500 companies now in the S&AMP;P to the earnings for the 500 
companies that were in the index a year earlier. First Call adjusts 
the year-earlier S&AMP;P 500 to reflect the makeup of the current 
index. There have been 43 changes in the S&AMP;P 500 index this year. 
Chrysler is gone. BankAmerica and Nationsbank merged and Union Planters 
was added. MCI and Worldcom merged and RJR Nabisco was added. ``There 
are a record number of changes because of mergers,'' said David Blitzer, 
chairman of the index committee at S&AMP;P. ``The fact that they are 
dealing with a different composition would make a difference.'' Unfortunately, 
all these reasons do not explain fully the gap between the estimates, 
and it might take a lot of computer time _ and cooperation between 
the two firms _ to find an explanation. But there is little doubt 
that the divergence is not helping the credibility of the data. ``It 
worries me that we are three percentage points off in the third quarter 
and almost five percentage points off in the fourth quarter,'' Hill 
said. ``I wouldn't have a clue of where we could be doing something 
wrong on this.'' What do investors do? First Call is comparing apples 
to apples, and that is probably better. But all investors should remember 
that there is a bigger problem with the analysts who make the forecasts 
that the two companies compile. Year in and year out, they are virtually 
always too optimistic and spend most of their time scaling back earlier 
predictions. This means that both the IBES and First Call earnings 
forecasts for the first and second quarters of 1999 are likely to 
be revised downward. That is even a surer bet than usual given the 
new signs of a slowing American economy. The Federal Reserve's current 
regional economic survey showed that retail sales were weaker than 
expected, manufacturing was ``generally softer'' and growth slowed 
in five regions. And American exports dropped $1.2 billion in the 
third quarter, reflecting the disappearance of demand from the rest 
of the world as Asian and developing economies slow down or sink into 
recessions. ``My boss asked me what will happen to the earnings forecasts 
in the first and second quarter,'' said Joseph Abbott, United States 
research manager at IBES. ``I told him I was sure they were going 
to go down. But I don't know how much.''
