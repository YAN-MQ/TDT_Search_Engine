People who work in seagram's film division aren't the only ones who 
may be feeling a little nervous these days. The company says it plans 
to lay off up to 20% of its music industry workforce. Casey wian reports. 
Seagram's new universal music group overnight becomes the biggest 
name in the business, with about 25% of the world's music market. 
It combines the domestic strength of universal with the global clout 
of polygram to create a music giant with artists as diverse as Pavarotti 
and u2, Bon jovi, boyz II men, Shania Twain and Marilyn manson. I 
think it makes a tremendous amount of sense. You have a classic hand-in-glove 
fit here between two companies. One is a very strong international 
operation, one has strong U.S. operations. They eliminate significant 
redundancies, and that allows them to generate a Lot of cost savings 
and increase the profitability of the two companies. Seagram CEO Edgar 
bronfman Jr. says he expects the deal to generate $300 million in 
cost savings. Most of that will come from a 20% workforce reduction. 
That means the elimination of about 3,000 jobs at universal's record 
labels, which now include island, Mercury, mca, motown, A&M, interscope 
and def jam. The whole trend that we've noticed in this industry is 
consolidation, sharing resources and combining, so I know that's something 
that we've been eyeing and discussing. So those possibilities exist, 
but at this time we've just got our head down in terms of keeping 
our focus on our music. Also driving the merger, a worldwide slowdown 
in record sales that has put a premium on cost-cutting, and seagram's 
desire to reduce its exposure to the film business. Its universal 
studios unit is struggling through a string of box office flops, and 
this week admitted it will lose money in its current fiscal year. 
Still undecided, what happens to polygram's film business. Seagram 
wants to sell, it but has been unable to find a Buyer. For now it 
will operate as part of universal pictures, but remain for sale. Casey 
wian, "CNN Financial News," Los Angeles.
