Interim head coach Jim Jones of the National Football League's San 
Diego Chargers has accepted the head coaching job at the University 
of Hawaii. Jones played for Hawaii in 1974 and was the school's quarterback's 
coach in 1983. Hawaii fired Fred Van Apten last week after Hawaii 
finished the season winless in 12 games. Jim Jones previously served 
as head coach of the NFL's Atlanta Falcons.
