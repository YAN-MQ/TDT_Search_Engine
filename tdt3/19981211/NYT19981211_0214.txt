Rep. Rick Boucher, a southern Virginia Democrat on the Judiciary Committee 
with a deportment as temperate as his politics, seems a poor fit on 
a committee where members with an overdeveloped sense of outrage have 
few inhibitions about expressing their feelings. But Boucher's understated 
manner made him an ideal candidate to serve as ambassador to moderate 
Republicans, a job for which Minority Leader Dick Gephardt has tapped 
him. Boucher, co-author of the Democratic censure measure, has been 
phoning his moderate Republican friends to win their support for his 
compromise. Boucher appears to know that the best way to change someone's 
mind is not to announce one's intentions, however apparent they may 
be. And so Boucher said he is trying to establish a ``basis for a 
partnership, '' rather than working to persuade Republicans to vote 
a certain way. To Republican leaders, though, ``partnership'' sounds 
more like ``wedge,'' and they say they believe Boucher may be wielding 
a sledgehammer to split their party. Boucher responds that he is trying 
to unify the country by preventing a Senate trial. ``There are divisions 
within the nation now, but they are not deep,'' he said. ``If a trial 
occurs they will become deep.'' After the Republicans lost five house 
seats in the November election, the party's leadership hardened its 
position on impeachment and ended efforts among Republican moderates, 
including some on the Judiciary Committee, to try to find a compromise 
position short of voting to remove the president. Two weeks ago, in 
an effort to restart the search for a compromise, Gephardt called 
a meeting of Democratic moderates to discuss reaching out to Republicans 
who might support a censure resolution. At that meeting, Boucher, 
who wrote the Democratic impeachment inquiry plan, was chosen to lead 
the outreach to Republican moderates, with whom Clinton's fate would 
seem to rest. While admitting he has yet to change any minds, Boucher 
says his strategy is to try to get moderate Republicans to see the 
issue as he has. Boucher, who before the impeachment inquiry dealt 
mostly with telecommunications reform, has spent no time thinking 
about who touched whom in the Clinton-Monica Lewinsky affair. He has 
eschewed the details of the report by Kenneth Starr, the independent 
counsel, and instead examined the House Judiciary Committee's report 
on Watergate. That report, Boucher said, argues mere misconduct by 
a president is not enough to impeach; it must be misconduct that threatens 
the nation. ``The facts in this case don't meet that high standard,'' 
he said. Boucher said he expects his rounds of phone calls to intensify 
next week after the debate moves from the Judiciary Committee to the 
floor of the House. He has little pride of authorship over his censure 
motion and he said Democrats will tweak it in almost any way the Republicans 
want, if that might win their support. ``We are prepared to go where 
they need to be,'' Boucher said.
