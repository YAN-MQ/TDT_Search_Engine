As a junior executive in the circulation department of Time Inc. in 
the early 1980s, Jake Winebaum peppered his bosses with ideas for 
new magazines. One idea was aimed at ambitious yuppies: Advance, ``the 
magazine for moving ahead.'' Though Time rejected the magazine, Winebaum 
himself certainly moved ahead. Now, as head of the Buena Vista Internet 
Group, he has a spot on the Walt Disney Co.'s organizational chart 
that is parallel to those of the heads of the company's movie studio 
and ABC television network. Throughout his career, Winebaum has been 
filled with entrepreneurial ideas, but has mainly stayed at established 
companies. He moved from Time to U.S. News &AMP; World Report and 
finally struck out on his own to start Family Fun magazine in 1991. 
After two issues, Winebaum sold the magazine to Disney, a move that 
started him on a rapid ascent through its management ranks _ first 
in publishing, later in its dalliance with starting an all-news cable 
channel (it decided to pass), and by 1995 in its nascent Internet 
efforts. He started the family-oriented Web site, Disney.com, and 
a profitable online store that sells Disney-brand merchandise. And 
he has become an Internet evangelist in the corporation. ``I spent 
a lot of my time all over Disney helping them understand what the 
Internet is and why it's important to their business,'' Winebaum said 
recently, slouched in an easy chair in his office. With his corduroy 
shirt untucked over a white T-shirt, and with his brown suede shoes 
plopped on the coffee table, he looked more like a wayward teen-ager 
than a 39-year-old new-media mogul. But Winebaum works hard to make 
the right impression. One former colleague recalls how, in preparation 
for a visit by Michael D. Eisner, Disney's chairman, Winebaum held 
two separate rehearsals of his staff, blocking out where Eisner would 
walk and what people would say to him. A current colleague, Michael 
Slade, the chairman of Starwave, the Internet production company recently 
bought by Disney, said, ``The best way to understand Jake is that 
he's a great athlete.'' Winebaum was a ski racer at Dartmouth and 
now wind-surfs and runs marathons. ``He is very competitive and wants 
to win,'' Slade said. ``Two years ago, he worked for someone who worked 
for someone who worked for Eisner. Now he works for Eisner.''
