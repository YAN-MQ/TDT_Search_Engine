As Gary C. Wendt steps down as head of GE Capital Services, the financing 
arm of General Electric, he leaves behind a financial services juggernaut 
involved in everything from credit cards to equipment leasing. But 
a recent flurry of advertisements shows that GE Capital is working 
hard to raise its profile in another business _ mutual funds. ``GE 
is already a household name,'' said Michael J. Cosgrove, president 
of the investment services group for GE Financial Assurance, a unit 
of GE Capital. ``We have the advantages of two views of life _ the 
Main Street, because of our consumer business, and the Wall Street 
viewpoint.'' GE, based in Fairfield, Conn., already offers eight stock 
and four bond funds to the public and plans to start 12 others next 
year. Four of them, including junk-bond and European stock funds, 
will be available in January. As of Oct. 31, the company had $13 billion 
in mutual fund assets, according to the Financial Research Corp., 
a consulting group in Boston. That places it 53rd among fund companies. 
But GE's chief executive, John F. Welch, is known for his directive 
that the company not remain in a business unless it can be one of 
the top two players in the market. The industry leaders, Fidelity 
Investments and the Vanguard Group, have $460.2 billion and $349.3 
billion in assets, respectively, according to Financial Research. 
So how big are GE's plans? Cosgrove is optimistic. He expects to have 
$20 billion under management within five years and $100 billion within 
10 years. Still, it is difficult to imagine GE muscling its way past 
Vanguard. Cosgrove said that it all had to do with how you define 
a market. ``When you look at mutual funds, you look at the segment 
that you want to service,'' he said. He declined to identify that 
segment, but he said the 401(k) market and the so-called retail intermediary 
market _ funds sold by brokers, bankers and financial planners _ were 
``clearly very important.'' Those are the channels through which GE 
Capital sells its funds today. Over all the funds' records are pretty 
good, but not great. Most equity funds performed above the average 
of their category based on three year returns, according to Morningstar 
Inc., the financial publisher in Chicago. Among the bond funds, some 
have had superior performance and others have lagged behind their 
peers. GE's history in the fund business goes back to 1935, when it 
started managing what were called the Electric funds, intended for 
middle and upper management at the company who performed charitable 
work. Those funds, now the Elfun funds and still for GE employees, 
have $4.5 billion in assets. A fund group started in the 1950s, the 
Savings and Security Program funds, are now part of GE's 401(k) plan. 
That group has $6.8 billion in assets. The GE funds _ the ones now 
being promoted to the public _ were started in 1993 and include many 
clones of funds from the first two groups. They carry steep sales 
charges: 5.75 percent for stock funds and 4.75 percent for bond funds. 
While GE does not disclose the revenues of its mutual funds, it is 
presumably just a drop in the bucket for the company, which had total 
revenue of $90.8 billion last year. ``It's a small slice of the business 
and not something I spend a lot of time on,'' said Jeffrey Sprague, 
an analyst with Salomon Smith Barney. In general, analysts were not 
terribly optimistic about GE's fund prospects. ``It's small potatoes 
for them,'' said William E. Fiala, an analyst with Edward Jones &AMP; 
Co. GE could build a strong presence, but only ``in time, and only 
through acquisitions,'' Fiala said. ``They didn't have a good experience 
with investment banking,'' he added. ``The Kidder Peabody acquisition 
left a sour taste in their mouths.''
