The rush to send online holiday Greetings has clogged up AT&T worldnet's 
computer servers. An overload of graphics and audio on one of the 
nation's largest Internet providers caused delays of up to 45 minutes 
for delivery of E-mail on wednesday. And the problem continued into 
Thursday. AT&T says the extra multimedia elements involved in many 
online holiday greetings makes messages much larger. About 10% of 
worldnet's 1.3 million users were affected.
