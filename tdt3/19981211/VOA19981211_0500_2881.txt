And it's hard to predict the outcome of the Microsoft antitrust trial 
that's underway here in Washington, D.C. Among the evidence presented 
are various e-mail messages including those sent by Bill Gates, Microsoft's 
chairman. The USA Today newspaper reports that the trial illustrates 
how lawyers are finding electronic messages, often written with more 
candor than a formal document, are powerful tools in lawsuits. Michael

in terms of their importance in litigation. He says that people will 
begin to realize e-mail is as important as a piece of paper. And that's
