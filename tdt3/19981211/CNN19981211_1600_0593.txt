A Canadian who's been on death row in Texas for more than 20 years 
is still alive thanks to last-minute action by the U.S. Supreme Court. 
Anna Maria tremonti has more. The witnesses were already inside, prepared 
to watch Stan faulder's execution by lethal injection. But what they 
call "the five-man tiedown team" never walked him into the death chamber. 
Instead, 15 minutes before the execution time, the U.S. Supreme Court 
ordered a stay. His reaction was, "far out! That suits me." He was 
generally surprised. He did say that he thought this was only a temporary 
thing. He wanted me to thank the Canadian people. He is very grateful 
and was very moved by the support that he's received, the letters 
that he's received from Canadians. For all her delight at the sudden 
reprieve, faulder's lawyer, sandra babcock, was scathing in her criticism 
of the Texas justice system that took this case right to the wire. 
I have mixed feelings. I'm delighted, I'm ecstatic. I'm really, really 
happy. But about an half an hour ago, I had to go and say good-bye 
to my client for the last time. He has had to say his good-byes to 
his sister, to his niece, who has been here. This has been a very 
emotional time for him. He believed he was going to die. I think that's 
cruel and unusual punishment. Guards transferred faulder here to the 
so-called "death house."
