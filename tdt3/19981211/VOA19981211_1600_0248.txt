The United States is issuing a fresh warning to Iraq. It could face 
military attack if Baghdad continues to block work by United Nations 
weapons inspectors. Earlier this week, U.N. weapons experts were prevented 
from making a surprise visit to an office used by Iraq's ruling party. 
We get the latest from correspondent Nick Simeone who's at the White 
House. The Clinton administration is watching the situation in Iraq 
very carefully and waiting for a full read out on Iraq's cooperation 
with weapons inspectors from UNSCOM chief Richard Butler. But in a 
briefing for reporters preceding President Clinton's trip to the Middle 
East, members of the president's top foreign policy team reiterated 
the military option remains very much on the table if Iraq does not 
live up to a pledge to resume full cooperation in the search for banned 
weapons. National Security adviser Sandy Berger. If UNSCOM can't do 
its job, then we're left to take our own action, and that continues 
to be our position. We're going through a process that is now taking 
place - Chairman Butler and we will make a judgment as to whether 
UNSCOM can do its job. Iraq agreed to resume inspections last month 
narrowly averting a U.S.-led military attack, but Baghdad has since 
backtracked, blocking inspectors from carrying out at least one surprise 
inspection and denying UNSCOM personnel weapons-related documents.
