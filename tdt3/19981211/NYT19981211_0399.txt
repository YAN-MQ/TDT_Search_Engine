After lapsing into a coma overnight, Joe DiMaggio revived Friday afternoon, 
moving his head and squeezing his doctor's hand. But the doctor said 
DiMaggio's condition remained very serious and could change at any 
time. ``It's still a very dire situation,'' Dr. Earl Barron said. 
This is the fourth time DiMaggio's condition has been termed critical, 
and Barron described DiMaggio's status as a ``roller coaster ride.'' 
He said that on three previous occasions, the Hall of Famer rebounded 
with the help of antibiotics and the suctioning of an infected lung. 
Early Friday morning, Barron offered little hope of recovery as he 
made his bluntest assessment of DiMaggio's condition since the former 
Yankee center fielder entered Memorial Regional Hospital here on Oct. 
12. He said DiMaggio had a temperature of 102 and deepening pneumonia. 
``We did a chest C.T. _ that's a special X-ray of the chest _ showing 
the pneumonia has actually worsened,'' Barron said. ``It's just unfortunately 
resistant to our antibiotics, and his general debilitated condition 
has contributed to the fact that he can't fight it.'' Asked about 
DiMaggio's chance of recovery, the doctor said: ``Our outlook is very, 
very poor. I mean, we're talking about not a very long time, I don't 
think.'' Barron, a cardiologist for 33 years, said that DiMaggio had 
been his most noteworthy case of resilience. ``I've had a lot of tough 
cases over the years,'' he said, ``but not one who continues to survive 
like he has. He's been amazing in that he's survived all the things 
he's gone through. But I think that he's finally met his match.'' 
Barron said he and several other doctors treating DiMaggio thought 
about trying a different procedure on the 84-year-old on Thursday, 
but decided against it. ``There is nothing really to be done,'' he 
said. ``In evaluating the C.T. scan, thinking there was some extra 
fluid in his lung we could remove, we saw there was not enough that 
would make any difference, and we could end up aggravating him by 
trying.'' He said DiMaggio's blood pressure and heart and kidney functions 
were good, but that his lungs were in poor condition and were ``causing 
us major problems.'' He also said DiMaggio's pneumonia was more severe, 
which had raised his temperature. On whether DiMaggio's latest setback 
was more dire than the other three, Barron said Friday morning, ``This 
is about as low as you can get.'' He said that on a scale of 1 to 
10, with 10 representing a complete recovery, DiMaggio moved from 
a 0.5 in the morning to a 1 in the afternoon. Barron has been with 
DiMaggio daily now for 61 days, day and night. He said it has been 
hard not to be emotional, with DiMaggio such a beloved figure around 
the world. ``It's just one of those things,'' he said. ``You've got 
cancer and you develop pneumonia post-operatively and unfortunately 
you get one of the horrendous organisms, and that's what happens.'' 
DiMaggio underwent lung cancer surgery on Oct. 14 and has since dealt 
with pneumonia and precipitous, life-threatening drops in his blood 
pressure on three occasions _ Nov. 16, Nov. 28 and last Monday. Barron 
advised on Monday that DiMaggio's family and close friends be called, 
with the apparent end in sight. From California came his two granddaughters 
_ Paula and Cathy _ along with their husbands and two children each. 
Joe Nachio, who says he has been DiMaggio's friend for 56 years, came 
from Panama. DiMaggio's brother Dom, two years younger than Joe and 
a daily visitor, made yet another trip down from Boynton Beach, a 
45-minute ride from here. Morris Engelberg, DiMaggio's friend for 
15 years, rounded out the inner sanctum. The family was contemplating 
whether to sign a D.N.R. consent form _ standing for do not resuscitate 
_ in case DiMaggio's heart stops beating. He remains on life support 
systems, and Barron said he would live about 30 minutes without them. 
DiMaggio's family has asked doctors to keep him on life support. ``It's 
pretty much down to the power of prayer,'' Engelberg said.
