The leader of Japan's delegation to the Asian Games said Friday the 
athletes' village and competitions in Bangkok exceed those in the 
last games four years ago in the Japanese city of Hiroshima. ``We 
sent an advance team of officials in September who made a number of 
requests and suggestions. ... We did have some concerns whether Bangkok 
could pull off the games,'' Teruji Kogake said at a news conference. 
Bangkok's slow early preparations also had worried the games' governing 
body, the Olympic Council of Asia, which talked at one point of moving 
them elsewhere. Then the Asian financial crisis handicapped Bangkok's 
efforts to catch up. ``However,'' Kogake added, ``the athletes' village 
and competitions here are excellent and exceed those at the 12th Asian 
Games held in Hiroshima. We recognize Bangkok's great efforts in hosting 
the games.'' Japan's team had 21 gold medals, 23 silver and 28 bronze 
after the fourth full day of competition Thursday, second to China's 
50, 35 and 22. Kogake said Naoko Takahashi's victory in near-world 
record time on the opening ceremonies day Sunday inspired other Japanese 
athletes, who picked up six golds on the first full day of competition 
_ the best first day ever for Japan. Kogake's deputy, Nobuyki Sato, 
said competition levels have been high. In judo, he said, Central 
Asia was gaining ground in what had been a sport dominated by East 
Asians and Europeans ``We are looking to the latter half of the games 
to athletics, karate and bowling to see if we can match the medals 
won at Hiroshima,'' he added. In Hiroshima, Japan won 59 golds, behind 
China's 135 and South Korea's 63.
