LAUSANNE, Switzerland (AP) _ UEFA's Executive Committee wrapped up 
a two-day meeting Friday with a revamped Champions League in place 
but final details of its financing still unclear. The committee on 
Thursday unanimously approved the start next season of a new 32-team 
Champions League and a single competition _ called the UEFA Cup _ 
to merge the existing UEFA Cup and Cup Winners Cup. ``It makes the 
rich richer, but the poor are not getting poorer, and that's quite 
a good result,'' UEFA President Lennart Johansson told a news conference. 
As UEFA's plans stand, a major club winning the new Champions League 
would earn a maximum of between 65 and 70 million Swiss francs (dlrs 
46.5 million and 50 million). The competitions were restructured to 
counter the threat of a breakaway ``Super League,'' proposed by Milan-based 
marketing firm Media Partners, which said new pay-per-view TV rights 
would boost annual revenues for Europe's leading clubs. UEFA set up 
a task force, involving senior executives of European leagues and 
clubs as well as UEFA officials, to examine the future of European 
club competitions. It came up with a new Champions League format which 
it expects will generate some 800 million Swiss francs (dlrs 570 million), 
with three-quarters of the proceeds being distributed to clubs. Although 
that falls far short of the Super League's promised revenues, the 
European governing body insists it is confident of the projected revenue 
from television and sponsors. But it left unclear to what extent the 
new format will involve pay-per-view television. ``We have always 
said that priority will be with free TV; we may and will make use 
in certain countries of the pay TV market,'' UEFA General Secretary 
Gerhard Aigner said. ``I don't see at the moment that pay-per-view 
is on the agenda but I wouldn't exclude that,'' he added. Of the 600 
million francs (dlrs 430 million) that would be distributed to clubs, 
some 30 million francs (dlrs 21 million) would go to the leagues of 
participating clubs, Aigner said. ``There are more meetings to come'' 
over the next two to three months regarding finances, Aigner said. 
Each club in the first phase, where teams will pay in eight groups 
of four, will receive 1.5 million francs (dlrs 1.1 million). Additional 
payments would be made for matches played and won, with the winner 
getting 10 million francs (dlrs 7.2 million). That would leave 250 
million francs (dlrs 180 million) to be distributed according to a 
system of market values which hasn't yet been finalized, Aigner said. 
UEFA's share of the money will go to administrative costs and a variety 
of other payments, including those to teams which are eliminated in 
the qualifying rounds. Aigner said UEFA is ``not particularly worried'' 
about further pressure on the European body from the clubs in future. 
``It is not so much the clubs who have developed the ideas, it is 
the television market which has developed ideas,'' he said. ``I think 
the clubs are very comfortable to stay with us.'' The new Champions 
League will involve some teams who finish fourth in the major European 
leagues, but UEFA kept its ``very good branding.'' ``I think we are 
playing for the European champion and therefore it is the Champions 
League,'' Aigner said.
