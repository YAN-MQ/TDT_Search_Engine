If anyone could have made sense of the doings at the Solomon R. Guggenheim 
Museum last Thursday, it was Eve, the top half of Brancusi's wooden 
sculpture ``Adam and Eve.'' With African features, a Hebrew name and 
a French-Romanian creator, she touched more cultural bases than a 
Benetton advertisement. What better emblem for the museum's new exhibition, 
``Rendezvous: Masterpieces from the Centre Georges Pompidou and the 
Guggenheim Museums,'' and for a fizzy panel discussion dedicated to 
the proposition that art, design, fashion, television and everything 
else were converging into one huge fabulous cultural goo ball. Joan 
Juliet Buck, the editor in chief of French Vogue, served as ringmistress 
for the discussion. A bouncy woman with a barking laugh, she fired 
questions at Andree Putman, the interior designer; Suzanne Slesin, 
the interior-design editor of House &AMP; Garden, and Michael Kors, 
the fashion designer. A very tony museum-fund-raiser audience _ including 
the likes of Carolina Herrera, Mica Ertegun, Diane Von Furstenberg 
and Kenneth Jay Lane _ listened. Amorphously titled ``A Celebration 
of Style,'' the symposium may have been related to ``Rendezvous,'' 
which parades the major artistic styles of the 20th century along 
the Guggenheim's spiral catwalk, or it may have been attached to the 
Guggenheim Museum SoHo's French-American show, a theory-laden exercise 
fetchingly called ``Premises: Invested Spaces in Visual Arts, Architecture 
and Design From France: 1958-98.'' But who could tell? Maybe the topic 
had more to do with a $12,000 Cartier watch that was given away as 
a door prize after lunch, and the chorus line of jewel-bedecked models 
in white cat suits who circulated among the tables. As Thomas Krens, 
the Guggenheim's director, reminded the audience: ``Culture is no 
longer a narrow thing. It's not just painting and sculpture. It's 
about everything that contributes to the texture of everyday life.'' 
And how. Krens does not just talk the talk. This is the man who this 
year opened the museum to ``Show,'' a performance in which 20 professional 
models teetering on stiletto-heel Guccis and wearing either rhinestone 
Gucci G-strings or nothing at all, stood and did nothing for three 
hours. Krens has led the way in inviting sizzling-hot talents like 
Gae Aulenti and Frank Gehry to install exhibitions. It was Ms. Putman, 
recovered from her labors designing Morgans Hotel, who did the installation 
for ``Rendezvous.'' Think of the Guggenheim not as an austere temple 
of modernism, but as Thomas Krens' House of Style. All parties agreed 
that a millennial mega-convergence of cultural languages and styles 
has arrived, and that interior design and fashion, in particular, 
seemed to be infatuated with each other, whipped on by a fashion and 
design press that has speeded up the trend cycle and created a picky, 
very impatient customer population. ``People have gotten smarter,'' 
said Kors, a militantly casual figure in chinos, a black sweatshirt 
and black laced shoes with no socks. ``They look in the mirror, stamp 
their feet and say, `Skip it, I'm not going there,' although we do 
still have people dressed like cakes and things like that.'' Ms. Putman, 
a regal figure who spoke in a Lauren Bacall baritone, limited her 
remarks to a series of deadpan aphorisms. ``There are no more fashion 
victims, and there used to be tons of them,'' she said. ``Now there 
are only design victims.'' Well, yes, said Ms. Buck, dressed like 
a one-woman manifesto for gray as the new black. ``Design is hard,'' 
she said. ``Fashion is easy, because it's based on your body.'' Easy 
for the customer, perhaps, but hard for the fashion business, Kors 
said, lamenting the now almost invisible gap between the emergence 
of a trend and its descent into cliche. Like gray as the new black. 
Ms. Buck flinched. ``Don't say you're sick of gray,'' she protested. 
``Not today.'' With ``Rendezvous'' perhaps in the panelists' minds, 
the dialogue between French and American style loomed large in the 
discussion. Ms. Putman found it cheering that the French seemed to 
be breaking free of ``the Versailles syndrome'' _ the national impulse 
to invoke Louis XIV when decorating their homes. Like a solvent, American 
culture, especially American television, has been melting the thick 
patina of traditional French style. Ms. Buck noted that French mothers 
are now as likely to name their daughters Tiffany as Marianne, and 
in style matters, French youth seem to waver between South Central 
Los Angeles and the San Fernando Valley. ``I think the biggest influence 
on the French view of themselves is the set designers in Burbank who 
create those television shows,'' she said. Kors nodded emphatically. 
``French people used to tell me, `You're so American, so casual.' 
So when I went to France, I expected to see women in pink mink suits 
walking pink poodles.'' It wasn't quite like that. Shopping is still 
a languorous seduction in France, in sharp contrast to the 20-minute 
quickie that prevails in New York, he said. But Kors did see evidence 
of the backward-looking impulse when he arrived in Paris a year ago 
to take over as the designer for Celine. ``We had people in the atelier 
who had never seen anyone wearing shower clogs on the street,'' he 
said, genuinely appalled. France still has much work to do. ``France 
is the 40-watt bulb,'' Ms. Buck said. ``America is the 100-watt bulb, 
if not the three-way bulb.'' This was a point she was not willing 
to let go. Why, she asked Ms. Putman, did France not have the three-way 
bulb? Ms. Putman gave the matter some thought. ``I believe we invented 
the dimmer,'' she said.
