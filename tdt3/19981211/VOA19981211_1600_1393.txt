there are 21 ayes and 16 nos. And article one is agreed to. The committee 
will now consider article two. Are there any amendments to article 
two? There you have it at in the afternoon here in Washington D.C., 
history being made. The House of Representatives Judiciary Committee 
voting an article of impeachment against President William Jefferson 
Clinton. For the first time in 24 years, a president of the United 
States now faces an impeachment charge in the House of Representatives. 
I believe our correspondent out there, Paula Wolfson, is standing 
by. Paula? Jim, as expected, this vote came down along straight party 
lines; all 21 Republicans voting for this, all 16 Democrats voting 
no. And it's of note here that this happened about ten minutes after 
President Clinton finished his address to the nation and about, oh, 
half the members of the committee were in the room, maybe a little 
less than half were in the room during that address, and they still 
hadn't heard it, did not know what the president said when they cast 
this vote. We expect, of course, votes on there more articles of impeachment, 
Paula. Is there any indication the votes might be different? On those 
articles? They may be? This is the article of impeachment, this one 
dealing with lying to the grand jury on August 17th during the president's 
testimony. This is the count that has the most support on the committee. 
There are few who have some reservations among the Republicans about 
some of the other counts. We knew this one was going to past. The 
other ones, shades of doubt about some of them, but I don't think 
anybody would be surprised on Capitol Hill if all four are eventually 
sent to the House. In effect, the president has been indicted. Is 
that... Not yet. Not yet. Not yet. Indicted by the committee but now 
it must go to the full House for a vote. ok. Let's be clear what happens. 
If it goes to the House, a simple majority votes to impeach. That 
is not the end of the process. There must be a trial in the Senate. 
The Senate would require 67 of the 100 senators, two-thirds to convict 
the president of what the Constitution refers to as high crimes or 
misdemeanors. At that point, he would be removed from office. And 
I should hasten to add there are very few people who think the Senate 
would convict him at this point. Now, Jim, we have a new Congress 
coming in the middle of January. How much is the current Congress 
pushing to get all this done or at least most of it before that time? 
Well, you know, let me put that question to Paula, because it is interesting, 
Paula, that they were going to have the House will vote on impeachment. 
If they succeed, a different Senate, in effect, will take up the trial. 
That's correct. And some say that constitutionally, this could be 
a problem, that normally, legislation does not pass over from one 
session of the Congress to the next, although researchers and experts 
say in a case of impeachment that would be possible. It is interesting. 
I think there are two reasons why they're trying to get this through. 
One, Chairman Henry Hyde promised that he would complete their investigation, 
their inquiry, get rid of this matter by the end of the year. The 
other is that the new Congress that comes in in January, the Republican 
majority is smaller. They lost several seats in the last election 
though kept their majority in Congress. And it's going to be far more 
difficult for them to get the votes needed to impeach the president 
once the new Congress is sworn into session on the 6th of January. 
So we've had the vote in committee, which was expected. Now the president 
of the United States perhaps - faces perhaps his most important vote 
of his career next week in the House of Representatives. This will 
affect his legacy, his place in history. It's an extremely important 
vote. Jim Malone, thank you for joining us. We're going to take a 
short break here on VOA News Now as we have seen just the culmination 
of an incredible series of events today.
