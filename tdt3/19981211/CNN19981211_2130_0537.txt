A research group says more women and girls are being arrested for 
drug offenses. The Washington-based group, drug strategies, says women 
are abusing more legal and illegal substances, and treatment programs 
for them are not getting enough funding. It says girls should surpass 
boys in tobacco and alcohol abuse in less than five years. And they 
are expected to be even with males in illegal drug use at about the 
same time.
