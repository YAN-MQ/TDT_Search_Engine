Oil prices will not rise unless members of the OPEC cartel reduce 
their production, Libyan Petroleum Minister Abdalla Salem el-Badri 
said Friday. Moreover, Libya's revenues will be dlrs 2 billion lower 
this year than in 1997 because of the fall in the world price, Planning 
Minister Gadallah Azouz al-Tolhi told the Libyan parliament. This 
week the benchmark oil price of Brent futures fell to below dlrs 10 
- a 12-year low. Analysts have put the fall down to a glut in the 
market caused by overproduction and depressed demand owing to the 
economic recession in Asia and the warm winter in the West. ``Oil 
prices will not go up unless the Organization of Petroleum Exporting 
Countries reduces production, because asking non-OPEC members to reduce 
production is impossible,'' el-Badri told the General People's Congress, 
or parliament, which is holding its annual five-day meeting in the 
coastal town of Sirte, 400 kilometers (250 miles) east of the capital, 
Tripoli. Egypt's official Middle East News Agency quoted el-Badri 
as saying Libya had lost a lot of money because of the collapse of 
oil prices. El-Badri did not give a figure, but later Friday Libyan 
television showed al-Tolhi telling legislators that the country's 
income from oil would be dlrs 2 billion lower this year. OPEC President 
Youcef Yousfi said last month that member states should reduce their 
combined production by up to 1.5 million barrels a day in order to 
boost oil prices. The members of OPEC are Algeria, Indonesia, Iran, 
Iraq, Kuwait, Libya, Nigeria, Qatar, Saudi Arabia, the United Arab 
Emirates and Venezuela.
