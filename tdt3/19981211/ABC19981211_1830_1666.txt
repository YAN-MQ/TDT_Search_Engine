Just a brief review of the top story today. It's an important one 
fl the middle of the impeachment battle on Capitol Hill, President 
Clinton went to the rose garden to say again that he's sorry for everything 
he's put the nation through and that he would accept -- This was for

to avoid being impeached, but a few minutes later, the house judiciary 
committee, by passing that first article of impeachment, there are

week.
