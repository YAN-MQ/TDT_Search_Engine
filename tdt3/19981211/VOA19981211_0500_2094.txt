Four opposition leaders in Malaysia who were arrested by police during 
the celebration of Human Rights Day have been released. The Universal 
Declaration of Human Rights was adopted in Paris on December 10, 1948. 
It details civil, political and economic rights the world community 
believes each individual is entitled to. As Limshu Lin reports from 
Kuala Lumpur, activists condemn the arrests that took place. The celebrations 
were being held around the world. Four senior opposition leaders were 
released Friday after being arrested for distributing pamphlets calling 
for reform and the protection of democracy. The leaders were detained 
Thursday as the world marked the 50th anniversary of the Universal 
Declaration of Human Rights. They were held for several hours and 
then released on police bail. The four may be charged for illegal 
assembly. The arrest was condemned by opposition parties in Malaysia. 
Parliamentary opposition leader Lin Kip Jeung said it was shocking, 
that while the world was focused on human rights, the Malaysian government 
was arresting political activists for exercising their rights to freedom 
of expression. The arrests follow the detention of another opposition 
leader Tam Tra. Mr. Tra heads the Coalition of Opposition and Non- 
governmental Organization formed after the arrest of former deputy 
premier Anwar Ibrahim. Mr. Tra was released last week after being 
held for 14 days, and may be charged with sedition. He says police 
arrested him to intimidate him. Calls for reform have been growing 
in Malaysia following the dismissal and arrest of ex-deputy premier 
Anwar. He has been charged with sodomy and corruption, but says he 
is innocent. Mr. Anwar says that it's a political conspiracy to topple 
him because he was fighting corruption and cronyism. His supporters 
have held several street demonstrations in Kuala Lumpur since his 
arrest. Mr. Anwar's case has also attracted international concern 
over the state of human rights in Malaysia. I'm Limshu Lin for VOA 
News in Kuala Lumpur.
