General Manager Steve Phillips of the Mets is not scheduled to arrive 
at the first winter meetings in major league baseball since 1992 until 
Saturday morning. But by Saturday evening, Phillips could finally 
have Rickey Henderson signed, most likely to a one-year deal with 
an option for a second. And Kevin Brown could be signed by someone 
else for six years or more. Phillips is scheduled to meet with Henderson's 
representatives at the spacious _ and chaotic _ Opryland Hotel shortly 
after his arrival here. When asked Friday if Henderson could come 
to an agreement with the Mets by Saturday, one of Henderson's agents, 
Dan Horwits, replied, ``We might be able to.'' If so, the Mets might 
be able to fill their needs for an everyday left fielder and leadoff 
hitter. In an interesting twist, Tony Phillips, 39, who played left 
field and batted leadoff for the Mets for the final two months of 
last season, agreed Friday to a one-year deal with the Oakland Athletics, 
the team for which he played the first eight seasons of his 18-year 
career and for whom Henderson stole a major league high 66 bases last 
season. The As had been interested in re-signing Henderson, who turns 
40 in two weeks, but once they chose not to offer him salary arbitration, 
they lost the right to negotiate with him until May 1. The Seattle 
Mariners had also expressed interest in Henderson, but that apparently 
evaporated before these meetings. Manager Lou Piniella said Friday 
that Seattle had expressed interest in Yankee left fielder Chad Curtis. 
All of which leaves the Mets as Henderson's only suitor. Earlier this 
week, Steve Phillips offered him a one-year contract in the neighborhood 
of $1.7 million with performance bonuses and an option for a second 
year that would automatically kick in if Henderson meets certain requirements. 
When Horwits was asked today if Henderson was amenable to playing 
for the Mets, the agent said, ``Absolutely.'' He may have no other 
choice. That is not the case for Brown or Roger Clemens. ``I can't 
see how we can leave here without a deal being done,'' Toronto General 
Manager Gord Ash said in reference to Clemens, the five-time Cy Young 
Award winner who has demanded a trade from Toronto. Ash said that 
five teams were still in the running and that nothing had changed 
from Thursday. The five teams are believed to be Houston, Texas, the 
Yankees, Anaheim and Cleveland. And although the Yankees are considered 
a long shot, their owner George Steinbrenner has reversed his position 
and ordered his general manager, Brian Cashman, to be here either 
late Saturday night or Sunday morning. As for Brown, his agent, Scott 
Boras, said Friday night that he had already met with four teams and 
had two more meetings scheduled Froday night and two others Saturday 
morning. ``I would say that we certainly had enough conversations 
that we're very close to making a decision,'' Boras said. ``It could 
come together as soon as tomorrow, certainly by Sunday.'' The Los 
Angeles Dodgers, the Baltimore Orioles, the St. Louis Cardinals and 
the Colorado Rockies are believed to be competing for the 33-year-old 
right-hander. And Kevin Towers, the San Diego general manager, said 
Friday night that he was doing all he could to re-sign Brown, even 
though Brown would apparently like to sign for the highest average 
annual amount in baseball, somewhere around $14 million. Aside from 
Phillips going to Oakland, the only other move today saw the Cincinnati 
Reds sign the left-hander Steve Avery to a one-year deal for $1.5 
million, with another million in performance bonuses. With the newly 
acquired Denny Neagle and Avery, the Reds have obtained two former 
Atlanta Braves left-handers for their starting rotation. Avery, 10-7 
for the Boston Red Sox last year, was happy to be back in the National 
League. ``I like hitting and I like the National League cities,'' 
he said. ``That's not a knock on the American League, but I think 
if you're a pitcher, you like the National, and if you're a hitter, 
you like the American.''
