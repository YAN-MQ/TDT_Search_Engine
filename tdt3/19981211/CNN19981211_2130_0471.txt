This is meteorologist Valerie Voss with your "CNN Headline News Weather 
forecast" for Saturday. A very slow-moving low pressure center will 
keep clouds and wet weather across the southeast into the Tennessee 
and Ohio river valleys. Meanwhile, a front will move rather rapidly 
from the Great Lakes into upstate New York and northern New England, 
producing a few rain showers. Another system in the northwest will 
keep it wet and windy with mountain snow. High temperatures on Saturday 
will be mostly in the 30s to 50s. Florida will be warmer -- in fact, 
some 80s in the south. It'll be a little warmer in the southwest, 
as well. Looking ahead to Sunday -- we'll see snow across New England, 
with rain showers and thunderstorms along the southeast coast. It'll 
be wet and windy in the northwest once again, as well. On Monday, 
rain, mountain snow and wind across that northwest quarter of the 
country, with a few showers in southern Florida. For Tuesday, snow 
showers around the Great Lakes, rain showers in the northwest. It'll 
be windy in the southwest. Don't forget, you can find four-day forecasts 
for more than 7,200 cities. The address is CNN.com.
