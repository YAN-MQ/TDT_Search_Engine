The title of the program was provocative: ``How Jewish Do I Want to 
Be?'' And the timing was deliberate: one week before Hanukkah. The 
afternoon of panel discussions and small-group conversations at the 
Jewish Theological Seminary in Manhattan last Sunday took up a major 
theme of the eight-day celebration, which begins Saturday evening. 
That theme is, of course, resistance to assimilation, since Hanukkah 
celebrates the Maccabees' victory, in 165 B.C., over the foreign Hellenizing 
regime of Antiochus Epiphanes. Ever since a 1990 study showed that 
the intermarriage rate among Jews had recently gone over 50 percent 
and that many younger Jews were staying aloof from organized Jewish 
life, American Jews have been immersed in discussions of ``Jewish 
continuity.'' That study has provoked a ``profound reorientation'' 
for Jewish organizations, John Ruskay, chief operating officer of 
the UJA-Federation of New York, said at Sunday's gathering. They have 
shifted from an ``external agenda'' of combating anti-Semitism and 
mobilizing support for Israel to an ``internal agenda'' of confronting 
``the full challenge of emancipation.'' He summed up that challenge 
with the dictum that ``it is no longer rape that threatens us but 
seduction.'' In giving word of Sunday's program, a helpful aide at 
the Jewish Theological Seminary noted the topic's relevance to the 
well-known ``December dilemma'': the strain felt by intermarried Jews 
and Christians, whose families are tugged between rival religious 
observances, or simply the sense of not belonging felt by many Jews 
amid the vast Christmas glitter and hubbub. But there was virtually 
no mention of the ``December dilemma'' during Sunday's discussions, 
which drew some 200 participants. More surprising, for each reference 
to an intermarriage between a Jew and a gentile there were many more 
references to ``intermarriages'' between Jewish spouses whose attitudes 
toward Jewishness and Judaism were strikingly different. ``I'm a cultural 
Jew married to a spiritual Jew,'' went one instance of such testimony. 
``I do things that please him and don't offend me.'' Another woman 
described her husband as a ``sentimental Jew'' who spoke Yiddish and 
considered this more than sufficient for a Jewish identity. In searching 
for a more religious Jewish identity, she was on her own. If one of 
the day's small-group discussions was any guide, the spiritual rivals 
to Judaism were far more likely to be Asian traditions like Buddhism 
or yoga than Christianity. No one mentioned the lure of Jesus or his 
Gospel; the leading stumbling blocks to Jewish identity appeared to 
be basic questions about God and prayer on the one hand and dissatisfaction 
with Jewish institutions on the other. David Roskies, a professor 
of Jewish literature at the seminary, which has long been the scholarly 
center of Conservative Judaism, eloquently described the lifelong 
``art of becoming a Jew'' in modernity as a process of rebellion, 
loss, reclamation and renegotiation. That much of this negotiation 
must occur within the group rather than with the surrounding society 
was dramatized when the moderator of a panel of Jewish authors asked 
whether, in their writings or their personal lives, they had ever 
felt under pressure to disguise or de-emphasize their Jewish identity. 
The only instance volunteered came from Nessa Rapoport, an editor, 
novelist and poet. And it was surely an ironic one. She recalled being 
in Berkeley, Calif., for a conference of Jewish writers from the United 
States and Israel. Being fluent in Hebrew, she was guiding the Israelis, 
who like the majority of Israeli Jews were distinctly secular in their 
outlook, around Berkeley on a Friday when she realized that it would 
soon be sunset and the Sabbath. She wanted to return to her hotel 
and divest herself of money she was carrying and make last-minute 
phone calls, activities prohibited by traditional standards once the 
Sabbath began. ``I did not find myself able to tell them I had to 
get to the hotel because I was observant,'' Ms. Rapoport said. In 
the minds of the Israeli visitors, she felt certain ``it would typecast 
me'' and block effective communication with them at the conference. 
Her story only underlined what other groups anxious about defining 
and maintaining their distinctive identities _ whether Catholic, Muslim, 
Mormon or mainline Protestant _ could also remember, to their advantage: 
It is a gross simplification to imagine the struggle to claim and 
maintain a distinct identity as the resistance of an undifferentiated 
``us'' to an undifferentiated ``them.'' Both worlds, although they 
can seem like a simple inside and a simple outside, are more likely 
to be complex and intricately interwoven. Sometimes it's enough to 
make one long for the days of Antiochus Epiphanes.
