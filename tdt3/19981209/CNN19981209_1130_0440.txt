The 11th anniversary of the Palestinian intifada, or uprising, against 
israeli occupation is being marked with violence and protests. In 
Jerusalem, Palestinian demonstrators clashed with Israeli security 
forces. The protesters are angry over Israel's refusal to free Palestinian 
prisoners as called for in the wye river peace accord. Violence also 
erupted in parts of the West Bank. Palestinians staged a general strike 
and threw rocks at Israelis.
