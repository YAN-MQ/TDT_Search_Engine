Now to a medical breakthrough that is saving the lives for victims 
of what is often a grim prognosis. Here's NBC's chief science correspondent 
Robert Bazell. It's a boy baby. An astounding, life-saving technology 
that begins with the birth of a child. Blood from the umbilical cord, 
a lifeline between mother and child for nine months. Usually, simply 
discarded after birth. But now, used as an alternative to bone marrow 
transplants. I think it is going to have a very big impact on saving 
people's lives. We first told you the story of tarah kammerzell two 
years ago. She was facing death from leukemia, cancer of the bone 
marrow. Drugs did not work. Her main hope, a transplant of someone 
else's healthy marrow. But neither of her parents marrow offered a 
genetic match, so they decided on an experimental transplant with 
cord blood. We had no choice. We had to take the risk. Because without 
the transplant, tarah would have died. So it was definitely worth 
the risk. Today tarah camer Zell is a thriving 4-year-old. For tarah 
and others who need a bone marrow transplant, the 4 million babies 
born in the U.S. every year offer an almost unlimited pool of genetic 
matches with their cord blood. The procedure spares the difficult 
process of taking marrow from another person. Here's how it works. 
Scientists extract key cells called stem cells from the cord blood. 
They inject the stem cells into the patient's body, where they multiply 
to rebuild a healthy new marrow. It will change the nature of bone 
marrow transplantation eventually, in that it will be possible to 
do transplants to people who otherwise would have no, no chance at 
all. Doctors prove the deck neek worked so well, they now want to 
government to finance a bank of frozen cord blood that everyone could 
use. How many samples do doctors want to store? In order to have a 
bone marrow match for everyone in the country who might need one, 
researchers would need 200,000 units of placental cord blood, that 
could be stored in about 200 freezers like this one. It would be a 
bank that could save thousands of lives like tarah's every year with 
blood that is usually simply thrown away. Robert Bazell, NBC news,
