Astronauts Jerry Ross and Jim Newman have attached two 100-pound antennas 
to each side of unity, the American-made part of the international 
space station. It was a bit of a struggle getting them out of "endeavour." 
The astronauts had to back out of the tunnel that leads to the shuttle's 
cargo bay feet-first while carrying the antennas. They will allow 
the crew of the space station to communicate with colleagues on earth.
