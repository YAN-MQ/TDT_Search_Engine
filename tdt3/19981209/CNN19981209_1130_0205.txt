Americans who want to watch the impeachment proceedings can't turn 
to the major networks for live coverage. They're not carrying it. 
Anne McDermott tells us why. Last week, several Los Angeles TV stations 
interrupted their regular programming to report on a police chase 
of a suspected burglar. Yes, a suspected burglar. This week, it was 
back to talk shows and game shows. Impeachment hearings? Well, you 
could turn to PBS or cable. Which seemed to suit most folks just fine, 
like this woman, who didn't care to watch. I think the whole thing 
is ridiculous. And this man was on the run. I don't have a lot of 
time. And he just didn't care. Overall, I'm not really that interested. 
It seems a world away from the Judiciary hearings on Watergate. A 
historic event that was carried by the big three networks in rotation. 
As for the current impeachment hearings, the broadcast networks say 
they'll carry the actual vote. But in the meantime, well, some TV 
executives say there's not an overwhelming interest in the matter. 
A journalism professor sees it this way. Television stations are in 
it for money, for business. They're not gonna put anything on the 
air that the public isn't interested in seeing. But, some of the public 
is interested. This Los Angeles man wants to see more than just highlights. 
I don't think it's helpful, I don't think sound bites are helpful. 
Some New York college students were watching. If it weren't for the 
media, if it weren't for the coverage, the average citizen would not 
know what's going on. And yet, a lot of people were simply bemused 
by it all. I can't believe it's actually still going on after the 
last elections. but it is. Anne McDermott, CNN, Los Angeles.
