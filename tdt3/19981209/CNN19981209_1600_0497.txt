Strong winds are lashing much of southern California today. Speeds 
of up to 80 miles per hour were reported in some spots. The winds 
were so bad, they blew over semirigs on interstate 15, causing traffic 
snarls there. Another Lane was closed by plywood and boards, blown 
off an overpass under construction.
