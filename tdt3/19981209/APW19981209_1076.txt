South Korea harvested three judo gold medals Wednesday at the Asian 
Games, while Olympic bronze medalist Wang Xianbo ended China's drought 
with a dramatic victory over Kimoto Nami of Japan. Wang, 22, dominated 
Kimoto throughout the final bout of the women's 63-kilogram category. 
But at the ring of the bell, Kimoto cleanly threw Wang and the referee 
immediately pronounced the Japanese the winner. Wang, who said she 
had believed the match over and let down her guard, knelt and wept 
with her head in her hands as the Chinese team protested the decision. 
After 10 minutes, the arbitration panel agreed, overruled the referee 
and awarded her the gold. Kim Hwa-soo of Korea and Mei-ling Wu of 
Taiwan shared the bronze. South Korea took the other three gold medals 
at stake. Yoo Sung-yeon upset the third of Japan's famed Nakamura 
brothers competing in the Asian Games, 1993 world champion Yoshio, 
in the 90-kilogram category. The bronze was shared by D. Purevsuren 
of Mongolia and Kamol Murodov of Uzbekistan. In the men's 81-kilogram 
category, Cho In-chul beat North Korea's Kwak Ok-chul. Sharing third 
were Kazem Sarikhani of Iran and Ruslan Seilkhanov of Kazakhstan. 
The women's 70-kilogram class gold was taken by Lim Jung-sook, who 
defeated Miki Amao. The bronze went to Song Jianfeng of China and 
Chen Chiu-ping of Taiwan. Nakamura's defeat mirrored his Olympic champion 
brother Kenzo's loss Tuesday to Haliun Boldbaatar of Mongolia in the 
73-kilogram class. Yukimasa Nakamura, an Olympic silver medalist, 
was the only of the brothers to strike gold, on Monday. (pm-tjh)
