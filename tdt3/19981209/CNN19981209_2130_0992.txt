Economic growth is slowing for much of the country. The federal reserve 
says growth in 5 of its 12 regions has weakened, and strengthened 
in only one -- New York. The five districts with slower growth are 
-- Atlanta, Boston, Dallas, kansas city and St. Louis. Analysts blame 
a dip in consumer spending and fallout from Asia's economic crisis 
for the drop. The other four districts -- Chicago, Minneapolis, Richmond 
and San francisco remained unchanged.
