The White House used the final day of its defense to echo earlier 
assertions that Mr. Clinton's actions were wrong, but are not impeachable 
offenses. The president knows that what he did was wrong. He's admitted 
it. He suffered privately and publicly. He is prepared to accept the 
-- obliguy that flows from his misconduct. And he recognizes that, 
like any citizen, he is and will be subject to the rule of law. But, 
Mr. chairman, the president has not committed a high crime or misdemeanor. 
His conduct, although morally reprehensible, does not warrant impeachment, 
does not warrant overturning the mandate of the American electorate. 
White House spokesman James Kennedy is attacking the tactics of Judiciary 
committee republicans. He says it is unfair that republicans released 
the draft articles before White House lawyers had finished making 
their case.
