Trans world airlines is opening up its pocketbook. The St. Louis-based 
airline signed letters of intent today to buy 125 new aircraft over 
the next decade, with an option to buy another 125 in coming years.

allows the airline to assemble one of the youngest and most advanced 
fleets in the business.
