A still wine from a small lakeside village with a famous French name 
was proving Wednesday to be the last major stumbling block in tough 
negotiations between the European Union and Switzerland. At issue 
is French displeasure over Swiss winemakers' use of the prestigious 
Champagne name for their unbubbly white, which sells around 50,000 
bottles each year. But the Swiss vintners protest that they are only 
following the Swiss practice of naming their wine after their village, 
which has been called Champagne, with variations on the spelling, 
since the earliest documents in 885 A.D. Swiss Champagners, who tend 
their vines above Lake Neuchatel in Western Switzerland, have been 
making wine since the 10th century. The French region began producing 
its famous sparkling wine at the end of the 17th century. ``We are 
agreed on all questions except one,'' senior Swiss foreign ministry 
official Jakob Kellenberger told Swiss radio after an overnight session 
with EU representatives, admitting the Swiss Champagne was the sticking 
point. The French say the name can only be used for the famous sparkling 
white wine made in the Champagne region of France. And until the situation 
is sorted out, the French are holding out against a set of bilateral 
trade agreements with Switzerland. Last week, the EU and Switzerland 
struck a deal on transport, concluding four years of tough negotiations. 
The agreement cleared the way for a wider agreement covering areas 
like air transport and labor. The Swiss electorate voted six years 
ago against joining a loose European free trade grouping. Fearful 
of another snub at the ballot box, the government has frozen an application 
to join the more closely knit 15-nation EU trade bloc, which now surrounds 
the country, and has concentrated on the bilateral deals. The villagers 
of Champagne themselves are resigned to losing their right to use 
the name. ``If the Swiss confederation gives in, it will have to look 
at financial compensation,'' vineyard manager Albert Banderet was 
quoted as saying in the daily Le Matin newspaper. A compromise solution 
which would involve the Swiss wine being named ``Champagne Village'' 
was thought to be under discussion Wednesday. Swiss President Flavio 
Cotti told lawmakers the overnight talks made ``very important'' progress.
