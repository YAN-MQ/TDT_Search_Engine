A preliminary hearing is under way on the latest charges against Dr. 
Jack kevorkian. A judge will decide whether he should stand trial 
on charges of murder, assisted suicide and delivery of a controlled 
substance. The judge could dismiss some or all of the charges. The 
case drew national attention after the CBS program "60 minutes" played 
a videotape of the man's death. Portions of the tape were played today 
in court.
