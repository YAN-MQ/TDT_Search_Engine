Education officials on Wednesday suspended a small-town teacher who 
kicked a 12-year-old pupil hard enough to force removal of the boy's 
spleen. The Dec. 3 incident at the middle school in Monterotondo, 
outside Rome, became public only this week, making front-page headlines 
Wednesday and drawing condemnation from the Vatican's Osservatore 
Romano. Enrico Landi, 45, kicked the boy as he stood in a line with 
his classmates. The child later fainted and was taken to a hospital, 
where doctors removed his damaged spleen. The teacher said he had 
meant it only to be a light blow, but said the child turned abruptly 
and took the full force of the blow. ``It happened accidentally,'' 
Landi said, appearing on RAI state television Wednesday almost in 
tears. ``It was a 1-in-1 million thing. The important thing is that 
the boy's OK now.'' Colleagues defended the teacher, calling him an 
even-tempered man who was a friend to his pupils. ``It was a freak 
accident, even though it shouldn't have happened,'' said the school's 
vice principal, Maria Grazia Ricciotti. The Vatican newspaper condemned 
the action, saying it was unacceptable for a teacher to hit a pupil. 
``It seems a resurgence of archaic villainy, surfacing in absurd violence,'' 
Osservatore Romano said. Education authorities in Rome suspended the 
teacher pending the outcome of a criminal investigation.
