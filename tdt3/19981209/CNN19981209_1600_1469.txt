An old adversary of farmers has returned to the tuscany region of 
Italy. Gary Strieker reports on the problems wolves are causing. In 
corfino and other villages in tuscany, some believe there's a New 
reason to pray to their patron saints for protection from a new threat 
lurking in the mountains. "We should get rid of them," he says, "before 
they're too many and too dangerous." Wild wolves that had been exterminated 
here generations ago, and have now returned. A success story for conservationists 
who made it their mission to save the wolves in Italy. In 20 years, 
we increased the number of wolves from 100 to 500, and increased the 
range at least three times. a success for some. But for others, a 
disaster. He says he can no longer let his sheep graze freely in the 
field. He has to stay with them always. If he turns his back, the 
wolves will strike. This Shepherd says there used to be 20,000 sheep 
in this area, but now there are few. "Young people today," he says, 
"don't want to spend day and night with sheep, watching for wolves." 
In Italy, wolves are protected by law. But the cost of that protection 
has steadily increased. Regional governments now pay some $2 million 
a year to livestock owners as compensation for damage caused by wolves. 
And there's mounting political pressure to find some way to cut the 
costs. We have to be ready to accept that wolves cannot live in certain 
areas. There's some support for a zoning system for wolves, allowing 
them in zones with abundant wild prey like deer and wild boar. But 
in other areas where their main food supply could only be domestic 
livestock, they would be legally hunted and killed. Conservationists 
say wildlife authorities in other European countries are watching 
Italy's experience with wolves, because wolves are also making a Comeback 
in other parts of Europe in some areas like France and switzerland, 
arriving from Italy along the mountain ranges of the apennines and 
pyrenees. This park and other protected areas on the apennines are 
like staging points for wolves along a line that's like a virtual 
highway for them, heading north right into the middle of western Europe. 
Experts say poachers kill about 20% of the wolves in Italy every year, 
but that the wolf population here is still growing, with an expanding 
range a Testament to the adaptability of wolves and a sign they could 
once again become a common predator in the mountains and forests of 
Europe. Gary Strieker, CNN, in central tuscany, Italy.
