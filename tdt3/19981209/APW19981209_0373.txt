Cathay Pacific Airways took a big hit when Hong Kong's new airport 
opened, and faces continued turbulence amid Asia's economic turmoil, 
a top executive said Wednesday. Cathay Pacific lost some 400 million 
Hong Kong dollars (U.S. dlrs 51.3 million) in revenue in the months 
after the Chek Lap Kok airport's disastrous opening in July, just 
as Asia's airlines were running into troubles brought on by the economic 
crisis. ``When you have an economic downturn, air travel goes down 
as well,'' Philip Chen, the airline's chief operating officer, told 
reporters. Chen would not comment on the carrier's future business 
or earnings prospects. But he said the tough times have put pressure 
on Cathay Pacific managers, who are now struggling ``to make every 
single dollar pay.'' Chen added that the airline will be under pressure 
to cut costs for at least another year. Cathay Pacific's shares fell 
by 4.4 percent Wednesday on the Hong Kong Stock Exchange. The airline 
recently announced its first-ever losses of 175 million Hong Kong 
dollars (U.S. dlrs 22.4 million) for the first half of 1998, compared 
with a profit of 1.07 billion Hong Kong dollars (U.S. dlrs 137 million) 
in January-June last year. Cathay suffered badly when the showcase 
airport at its hub opened with big troubles on July 6. Computer breakdowns 
and system problems crippled both passenger and cargo services, with 
the cargo problems persisting for weeks. But despite the current financial 
constraints, Chen said Cathay Pacific was determined to make Hong 
Kong Asia's ``aviation hub,'' adding that the airline hasn't ruled 
out the possibility of expanding into Asia with an investment into 
the ailing Philippine Airlines. Chen disputed suggestions that Cathay's 
announcement last week that it had called off negotiations with PAL 
was a negotiating tactic. Chen added that although talks with PAL 
were over for now, Cathay was keeping ``informal channels'' open with 
the Philippine government. The talks fell apart as the two airlines 
wrangled over management control and possible job cuts in PAL's bloated 
payroll. Despite those difficulties, Chen acknowledged options to 
buy into a rival carrier ``don't come during the good times.'' ``We 
can never say never,'' Chen said. While admitting that ``the extent 
of management control was one of the concerns,'' Chen said the airline 
``never had specific plans on the number of PAL staff to be retrenched.'' 
Cathay Pacific laid off nearly 800 staff members in January to cut 
costs, and Chen did not rule out the possibility of further layoffs 
or pay cuts. ``We have to be realistic and go through this hardship 
period together,'' Chen said. Chen said, however, that Cathay Pacific 
planned no more job cuts as severe as those from January. He added 
that some 1,000 jobs have been trimmed off the payroll either through 
layoffs or attrition, and that the airline will continue to freeze 
hiring and cut staff through natural attrition.
