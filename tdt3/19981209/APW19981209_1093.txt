Senior Serbian officials on Wednesday formally rejected an American 
plan for Kosovo, reiterating support for a Serb draft which keeps 
the majority ethnic Albanian province firmly within the republic. 
In a statement issued after a meeting between President Milan Milutinovic, 
top government officials and representatives of some of Kosovo's minor 
ethnic groups said the U.S. plan for the region was ``not acceptable.'' 
The statement carried by Tanjug news agency offered little detail 
of the rejection, but said the American draft ``does not rely upon 
key elements'' from the Serb plan, in an indication it envisages loosening 
of Serbia's grip over Kosovo. ``Numerous remarks and suggestions have 
been adopted, which present response to the paper and a constructive 
contribution to further coordination of the framework for the political 
solution,'' the statement added, again without elaboration. Serbia's 
top politicians welcomed ``good hearted ideas'' in finding solution 
for Kosovo, but reiterated the solution can only be found in direct 
talks. ``The form for solving the problem in Kosovo is widest possible 
democratic self-rule within the legal system of Serbia and Yugoslavia,'' 
and with equal rights for all ethnic groups in the province, as envisaged 
in the Serb proposal, the statement said. A top Serbian official in 
Kosovo, Veljko Odalovic, said Wednesday the U.S. plan, drafted by 
envoy Christopher Hill, was unacceptable because it ``brings into 
question'' the territorial integrity of Serbia and Yugoslavia. Earlier 
this week ethnic Albanian politicians in Kosovo also rejected the 
American plan saying it was pro-Serb. The Serbian officials also called 
for a census in Kosovo as soon as possible.
