Peggy Cantelou, a grandmother of seven whose Southern accent is as 
soft and sweet as divinity candy, carries a baseball bat when she 
steps out to get the morning newspaper. Since the killings of three 
older people in this drowsy Mississippi city in just seven weeks, 
she seldom goes anywhere alone. Like other, older people in Columbus, 
a city of 23,000 people just across the Alabama border, she has learned 
much about home security systems, neighborhood watches and looking 
over her shoulder. In a city where it was once considered polite to 
speak to strangers, a simple ``hello'' can draw a quick, hard stare. 
``I used to think nothing of going into my storeroom in my house,'' 
said Mrs. Cantelou, 65. ``Not now. It's changed our lives. People 
just aren't as carefree anymore.'' Columbus police have been reluctant 
to use the words ``serial killer'' _ investigators have said there 
may be more than one killer _ but in this changed city, that is little 
comfort to older people. Three of their friends and neighbors have 
been taken from them, not by sickness or accident or by other things 
that people here could understand, but in gruesome fashion. All three 
victims were bound, gagged and strangled in their homes in quiet, 
middle-class neighborhoods, as sane, normal life went on just outside 
their walls. The dead, who had all lived in this city's northern section, 
were well known in the tight community of elderly residents. Betty 
Everett, 67, had been a beautician at the Trinity Retirement Center. 
Louise Randall, 80, was the retired owner of a corner grocery. Robert 
Hannah, 61, had often been seeing strolling the sidewalks of the north 
side. The murders appear to be linked, but police here are saying 
little else about them. They were not the first. Two more elderly 
people were killed in similar fashion in 1996 and 1997. Those crimes, 
too, are unsolved. Both victims, elderly men, were also strangled, 
although police have said the slayings might not be linked to the 
the latest killings. The only thing anyone seems sure of is that someone 
is killing the older residents of Columbus, and the investigation 
has not produced a firm suspect. ``We have a couple of prime suspects,'' 
said Mayor George Wade, but ``not to the point'' of charging anyone. 
The city has offered a $45,000 reward in the case. Older people are 
buying locksmith shops out of deadbolts and other locks and have installed 
security systems in houses that they once thought nothing of leaving 
unlocked. Pistol sales have tripled at least, and a firearms instructor 
at a city gun range is teaching a class for elderly residents. In 
a city where people used to wave, even at strangers, people spend 
a lot of time looking hard at people they do not know, and some they 
do know. No one seems to go out much after dark unless they are in 
a group, and many carry weapons of some kind, even if it is just a 
baseball bat, like Mrs. Cantelou. ``That sounds like a good idea,'' 
said Mary Francis Edmondson, who will be 80 on her birthday. Columbus 
is a landscape of old-money mansions and small frame homes, like other 
small Southern cities. Highway 82, a strip-mall-lined main artery, 
ferries traffic away from a pretty, tree-lined downtown dominated 
by the huge courthouse. ``We've never had anybody go into somebody's 
house and kill them,'' said Jackie Ball, a city councilman. ``We have 
no way of comprehending that. We're just hoping and praying this comes 
to an end.'' The killings started in 1996, when Mack Fowler, 78, was 
found dead in his kitchen on July 8, stabbed and strangled. Then, 
on Nov. 2, 1997, George Wilbanks, 75, died the same way. Both had 
lived alone. Then, on Oct. 13, Hannah, a retired employee at a hospital 
cafeteria, was found bound, gagged and strangled. On Oct. 21, Mrs. 
Randall was strangled in her house. She was found days later, also 
bound and gagged. ``They stuffed a sock in her throat,'' said Mrs. 
Edmondson, who had known her for decades. Then, on Nov. 17, police 
found the body of Mrs. Everett, a gentle and very religious woman 
who was beloved for her work as a beautician at the retirement home 
because she did perms for the women when they were going out for church 
functions or family reunions. ``If they were going somewhere special, 
she gave them something nice,'' said Amanda Hartel, the food service 
director at the retirement home. ``She was a wonderful person.'' All 
five victims lived within a three-mile radius in the northern part 
of Columbus. Residents described their neighborhoods as middle-class 
and religious, with many of the houses owned by elderly people. At 
the Trinity Retirement Center, the residents are protected by employees, 
and by each other. ``They're still afraid,'' Ms. Hartel said. ``Everybody 
is.'' With police reluctant to say anything about the cases, residents 
have been left to speculate on whether there is one killer or two. 
``From all I heard, there are some distinct similarities,'' said Jack 
Marshall, chief operations officer for the city of Columbus, ``but 
we have not been able to officially say that the murders were committed 
by the same person or persons. We don't have anything major at this 
point.'' Robbery did not seem to be the motive in any of the slayings, 
city officials have said. That, residents said, is more frightening 
that anything else. A killing done in the course of a robbery, as 
evil as that seems, is easier for the elderly people here to accept 
than the notion that someone is murdering their friends and neighbors 
for some twisted satisfaction. One of the most disturbing things about 
it, the people say, is how it upsets the natural order of living, 
and dying. ``When an older person dies in their 70s or 80s, we like 
to say, `Well, they lived a good life,''' said Roger Short, assistant 
director of the Lowndes County-Columbus Parks and Recreation Department, 
and one of the many here who are enraged and frightened by the killings. 
The killings have stolen the end of a life of the victims. ``It makes 
you sick, because you don't know what life they had left, or how they 
might have relished it,'' said Short, whose father died from black 
lung disease from decades of working in the coal mines near Cordova, 
Ala. ``These people,'' he said, ``are like the people who raised us.'' 
The loss seems greater, somehow, because people who have lived a long 
time just naturally leave more of themselves in the collective memory 
of a community. Mrs. Edmonson, whose husband owns a gas company, remembers 
when she used to chat with Mrs. Randall at her store, ``back in those 
days when they delivered your groceries,'' she said. ``I had a house 
full of children, and I was so busy, back then,'' Mrs. Edmonson said. 
``One day Louise told me, `You know, Mrs. so-and-so came in with some 
of these little green butter beans.' And I said I'd love to have them, 
but I didn't have time to shell them. When the boy brought my groceries 
home, there was a sack of little green butter beans, already shelled.'' 
Police have told reporters they are searching for links between the 
victims that could pinpoint a suspect, and a criminal profiler with 
the FBI has been helping them identify the kind of criminal they are 
looking for. But Scott Lilienfeld, an assistant professor of psychology 
at Emory University in Atlanta, said the killer could be preying on 
the elderly for the simplest of reasons: that they are often weaker 
and more helpless. Mrs. Randall could barely walk. Her house has a 
wheelchair ramp outside. ``It might have just been the easiest thing 
to do,'' Lilienfeld said.
