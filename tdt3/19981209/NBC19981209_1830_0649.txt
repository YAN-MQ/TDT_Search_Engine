All of this developed as secretary of state Madeleine Albright is 
on her european tour working on NATO and human rights problems. Before 
she left, I talked to her at the state department about foreign policy 
problems facing the U.S., including the prospect that Saddam Hussein 
will break his latest promise as he always has before. The United 
States has said no more warnings, no more consultations. We will take 
whatever action militarily we need to. But we've said that all before. 
And always, at the last moment, he dodges the bullet. I really do 
think that we have done all the diplomacy that is possible to do. 
The military option is there on the table. And he knows that. Your 
critics are saying you've reversed the Teddy Roosevelt dictum, that 
you speak loudly but carry a small stick. People forget that using 
the military is a means, it is not the end. The bottom line is, how 
do we get compliance? Not just bombing for the sake of bombing. As 
madame secretary, Madeleine Albright, often repeats the saying of 
one of her predecessors, "foreign policy problems are not like headaches. 
They don't go away by taking a pill." On her watch, Kosovo has become 
another war waiting to happen. And no one expects the temporary peace 
to last long. Do you think that you can avoid putting NATO forces, 
including American units, into Kosovo some time in 1999? We are trying 
to make sure that both sides abide by the cease-fire. We've solved 
the immediate humanitarian catastrophe, but we have not solved the 
political crisis. Her trip this week with the president to the Gaza 
strip. Are there fears? We're all anxious all the time. Obviously, 
if there are security concerns, we will worry about those and take 
care of them. Russia. The administration has made a big bet on Yeltsin. 
He is collapsing and so is his country. We will continue to work the 
problem. I don't think it requires a new strategy. I think it requires 
us to be realistic about what is going on there and support the reformers. 
But candidly, hasn't it proved to be more vexing than you anticipated? 
Yes, it is more difficult. But that doesn't mean we give up. Let me 
ask you as a former professor, to grade your tenure as secretary of 
state. I would give myself probably a "B." And good effort. Hard work. 
Needs to have more results.
