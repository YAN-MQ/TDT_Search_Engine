Angered and insulted by an exhibition game designating one of its 
two charities as financially struggling players, a National Basketball 
Association player agent Wednesday criticized his peers and the all-star 
players involved in the game. Keith Glass, who represents five players 
making the league's minimum annual salary of $272,500, said he was 
insulted over how fellow agents and the game's promoters, David Falk 
and Arn Tellem, were planning to divide the proceeds from the Dec. 
19 game. The exhibition, scheduled in Atlantic City, will benefit 
Unicef and the NBA players who have been hurt financially by the league's 
five-month-old lockout. ``The game is troubling me to a tremendous 
degree,'' Glass said. ``I support it in a way that shows the unity 
of the union and to show the owners that their game is not the only 
one in town. But for them to say this will benefit NBA players as 
a charity is wrong. ``None of my players has ever asked me for money 
and will not accept money from this game. The entire portion should 
go to charity. The idea that a player making $275,000 can't manage 
his money, and needs the fans to bail him out, is absurd and insulting. 
If that's the break between the agents, so be it.'' Glass was one 
of more than 70 player agents who took part in a conference call Wednesday 
with the union's executive director, Billy Hunter. The call was mainly 
to assuage fears that the NBA season would be canceled. Hunter did 
his best to soothe their concerns. He told the agents, some of whom 
were more than skeptical, that the two sides in the league's labor 
dispute were not as far apart as many believed and that if the players 
remained unified, a deal would be struck in the next few weeks. But 
other agents echoed Glass' concern over a public backlash that arose 
after a news conference on Monday in New York to announce the exhibition 
game, which will be televised by Showtime. Aside from Falk and Tellem 
via satellite from Los Angeles, the union's president, Patrick Ewing, 
Alonzo Mourning, Allan Houston, Glen Rice and Dominique Wilkins also 
participated in the news conference. Though they tried to preface 
their statements by saying that fans should not feel sorry for the 
players, comments from Mourning and Ewing about players in need were 
roundly criticized. ``We are taking the beating on this thing,'' one 
agent said Wednesday. ``Let's just make sure we keep these guys out 
of the casinos.'' The union's last general session was held in Las 
Vegas, Nev., which also drew the public's ire. Except for the involvement 
of its players, the union is not involved in the promotion or the 
organization of the game. Whether Hunter was upset with some of the 
charity game's proceeds going to players was unclear. The union declined 
comment on the matter Wednesday night. But there apparently is growing 
support to make sure that all revenues from the game _ courtside tickets 
are said to be priced at $1,000 _ go to charity, said one player agent, 
who requested anonymity. ``I don't know what David and Arn are thinking, 
but that's not our agenda,'' Glass said. ``This is everything I'm 
against. Why in the world, if you knew there was going to be a problem 
with a lockout, would you not prepare for it? ``I was absolutely taken 
aback. We ask the fans to wait for our season to start so they can 
start paying exorbitant prices for tickets again. Now, we're going 
to turn around and ask them for money?''
