Private health clubs in the Boston area are calling on the IRS to 
investigate statewide YMCAs. The international health, racket and 
sports club association says that the ymca's tax exempt status is 
affecting competition, particularly when the Ys target wealthy customers.

status in addition to special funding and other perks. Ymca contends 
that it only charges what certain communities can afford.
