There is, of course, another judge and jury in this case the American 
public. And for some time, that public has been saying no to the idea 
of impeachment. But as NBC's David Bloom reports, it is not a Ringing 
endorsement of the president who tonight is facing fewer and fewer 
options. Tom, tonight the contrast could not have been more striking. 
At the very moment the republicans were releasing their four articles 
of impeachment, the president and first lady were lighting the national 
christmas tree, festive, seemingly unconcerned. But in private, phone 
calls to undecided republicans, White House aides are telling lawmakers 
the president would accept a steep fine or some other form of punishment 
if they would in turn back a censure resolution and save mr. Clinton 
the embarrass mnts of being impeached. Judiciary committee democrats 
condemn the president saying he is "violated the trust of the American 
people and dishonored the office of the president." And today one 
of Mr. Clinton's own witnesses, former Massachusetts governor william 
weld, a republican, proposed that instead of being impeached, Mr. 
clinton acknowledge in writing his wrongdoing, pay a large fine and 
still be subject to a perjury prosecution. White House counsel Charles 
ruff -- We are open to any reasonable suggestion from any side as 
a way of finding an end to this. But the critical, unanswered question 
is whether republican leaders bent on impeaching the president will 
even allow the full house to vote on censure. Democratic leader Richard 
Gephardt at the White House today -- I think the American people deserve 
to have an alternative on the floor with impeachment. It seems most 
people agree. A "new NBC news/Wall Street Journal" poll shows 68% 
of all Americans oppose impeachment and 61% say the house should not 
even send articles of impeachment to the Senate. And as republicans 
push ahead, their support is going down, while support for democrats 
is going up. Still, there's a dilemma for the White House. 52% of 
those surveyed believe that if the president is to censured rather 
than impeached, he must first admit he lied under oath. And that is 
something Mr. Clinton has so far been unwilling to do. Tonight the 
White House said that it's pleased with the testimony of charles ruff, 
the White House counsel and released a statement saying there's nothing 
in the record that says that the president ought to be impeached. 
tom? David Bloom at the White House tonight. Thanks very much.
