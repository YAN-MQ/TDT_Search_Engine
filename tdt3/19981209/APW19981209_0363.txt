A chartered Egyptian airliner was hijacked Wednesday after taking 
off from Tunis, Tunisia, and ordered to fly to neighboring Libya, 
an airport official said. But police said the craft landed in Jerba, 
Tunisia. The passengers on the plane included Libyans and apparently 
a large number demanded to go to Libya, a police official said, speaking 
on condition of anonymity. He said the craft's pilot had reported 
the incident to Egyptian officials. The hijackers left the craft but 
aboard were refusing to speak to authorities, the police official 
said. It was not clear why the craft landed in Jerba, an island 350 
kilometers (210 miles) south of the capital Tunis. According to police, 
the craft was chartered by a Lebanese company from EgyptAir, the Egyptian 
national carrier. The name of the Lebanese company was not immediately 
known.
