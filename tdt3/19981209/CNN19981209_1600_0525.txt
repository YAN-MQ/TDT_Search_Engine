This look at your "CNN Headline News Weather" begins with our forecast 
weather map for tomorrow morning. You can see a cold front stretching 
through the midsection of the nation. That front picks up moisture 
from the gulf of Mexico, and we'll see rain showers and perhaps a 
few thunderstorms in the state of Texas. And in the colder air, we 
could see some snowfall, particularly at the higher elevations of 
the southern Rockies. As we put this map in motion, you see that the 
cold front continues its easterly movement, carrying the rain showers 
along the gulf coast and spreading rain through the southern plain 
states and into the lower mississippi river valley. Meanwhile, another 
frontal boundary pushes in through the northwest. Temperatures will 
be quite cool in parts of the west and the upper midwest but still 
relatively warm in Florida and southern California. We extend our 
forecast now on into Friday. You can see the rain and thunderstorms 
expected along the gulf coast. As we move on into Saturday, you can 
see things tend to warm a little bit across much of the nation. The 
threat of rain and thunderstorms along the southeastern coastal area. 
And as we head on into Sunday, some snow shower activity is possible 
in New England. For more weather information, log on to -- CNN.com.
