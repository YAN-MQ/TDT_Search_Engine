The St. Louis Rams will have to play the rest of the season without 
Isaac bruce. The wide receiver has been put on the injured reserve 
list with a lingering hamstring injury. He started out with 21 catches 
in the first two games, but he's missed the last six and sat out most 
of three others earlier in the season.
