A Texas judge has granted a request by Olympic gymnast Dominique Moceanu 
to make a restraining order against her father permanent for a year. 
The 17-year-old gold medalist testified today her father has been 
stalking her and met with a private investigator to find out where 
she has been living. Dumitru Moceanu denies following his daughter, 
but says he did ask her to pull over at a stoplight recently. A judge 
granted the gymnast legal adult status in October, after she sued 
her parents for control of her finances and left home.
