17-year-old Olympic gymnast Dominique Moceanu is back in court, to 
request a permanent restraining order against her father. She testified 
today her father has been stalking her, and met with a Private investigator 
to find out where she has been living. Dumitru Moceanu denies following 
his daughter, but says he did ask her to pull over at a stoplight 
recently. A judge granted the gymnast legal adult status in October, 
after she sued her parents for control of her finances and left home. 
She says she had been physically abused by her father. Would you state 
to the court whether or not you have committed any act that was intended 
to result in physical harm or bodily injury or assault of your daughter? 
Never. You're saying that your father hit you because you gained weight? 
Yeah. He put me on a scale. And he hit you? Yeah. And where did he 
hit you? My face. He slapped you? Yeah. Because you're saying your 
father hit you because you gained some weight? Yeah. He also hit me 
in front of Bela carolli. Where did he hit you? In the face. And before 
the Olympics. Police are also investigating a private investigator's 
claim Moceanu's father offered to pay $10,000 to have her coach and 
a friend killed.
