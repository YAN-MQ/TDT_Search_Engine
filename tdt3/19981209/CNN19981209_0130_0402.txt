"Endeavour" astronauts are scheduled to take a second space walk Wednesday. 
Their mission is to attach two 100-pound antennae to the international 
space station. On Tuesday, they helped boost the international space 
station 5 1/2 miles higher, to an altitude of about 248 miles above 
the earth. NASA is declaring the first space walk a success. Monday, 
two astronauts connected 40 cables linking Russian and American components 
of the space station.
