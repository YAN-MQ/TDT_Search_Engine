On one level, the battle over the impeachment of William Jefferson 
Clinton is being played out in the House Judiciary Committee hearing 
room and in other Washington power alleys. But it is also being fought 
at a grass-roots level all over the country, with both those who fervently 
want the president impeached and those who just as fervently want 
him left alone trying to find ways to give weight to their wishes. 
Some of these people are egged on by conservative and liberal lobbying 
groups, but a great deal of the outcry is arising unbidden. Dana Hunter, 
34, a freelance Web-page designer in California's Silicon Valley, 
started her own anti-impeachment Web site. ``I'm doing a lot of Web 
advertising,'' said Ms. Hunter. ``I'm saying, start harassing your 
representatives. I'm saying, let your guy know. Basically, we're just 
trying to be loud.'' Ms. Hunter said she knows of 30 other anti-impeachment 
Web sites. But the other side can roll out the numbers, too. ``Since 
December of 1997 we've placed 187,000 phone calls, and we're still 
calling at the rate of 500 a day,'' said Howard Phillips, chairman 
of the Conservative Caucus. ``We're spending most of our time, every 
day, on this. Since this thing began, we've sent out 812,000 letters 
urging action in various forms. Our message is that this is a vote 
about crime, that Clinton has committed crimes and if members of Congress 
are anti-crime they must vote to impeach.'' At the other end of the 
political spectrum, People for the American Way and other groups opposed 
to impeachment are working to get hundreds of thousands of voters 
to call their representatives and demand that they ``censure and move 
on,'' as one Internet group put it on a petition that has drawn more 
than 350,000 signatures. ``This is really more of a grass-roots phenomenon 
than it is a Beltway phenomenon,'' said Mike Lux, People for the American 
Way's political director. ``Most lobbying groups, whichever side they 
come down on, don't want to tick off Congresspeople who are then going 
to vote against them in another way on another issue. But our sense 
is that among the grass-roots groups, the neighborhood groups, there 
is real vitality and interest in this out there in the real world.'' 
Most congressional offices have received a relatively heavy _ and 
steady _ flow of faxes, phone calls and e-mails all year on the impeachment 
issue. In recent weeks, members of Congress who have taken strong 
positions _ like Rep. Peter King, R-N.Y., who told reporters last 
week that he would oppose impeachment _ say they have become targets 
for angry messages from across the country. Move On, the group circulating 
the Internet petition, has also arranged with another company for 
three days of toll-free calls that began early Wednesday morning. 
So it is contacting all the signatories and asking them to use the 
free phone time to be connected to their representatives. As of late 
Wednesday afternoon, a spokesperson for the group said, 17,000 people 
had already used the service. Wes Boyd, a software designer in Berkeley, 
Calif., said he founded Move On in late September, when he became 
concerned that the impeachment saga would play out into the new year. 
He said he was astonished when the Web site received about 100,000 
signatures on its petition in the first week. For the most part, Boyd 
has stopped his other work to devote his time to the anti-impeachment 
fight. He was also active in getting out the vote on Nov. 3. ``Then, 
it seemed like it was over,'' he said. ``But we knew it wasn't really 
over, so we kind of laid low for a while. Until this week, really. 
You can't get people excited until they're feeling it.'' Besides the 
toll-free calls, Boyd said, Move On forwarded 80,000 e-mails to members 
of Congress between Tuesday and Wednesday afternoons. The Conservative 
Caucus is far from being the only group rousing support for impeachment. 
The Family Research Council, Human Events magazine, American Renewal 
and other organizations are also cheering anti-Clintonites on. One 
of the busiest pro-impeachment Web sites belongs to a group called 
Free Republic, whose self-described ``Freepers'' keep in touch about 
planned forums, protests and letter-writing campaigns attacking the 
president. The most conservative talk radio programs have also beaten 
the drums for impeachment more loudly as the vote has drawn nearer. 
``There has been an intensification and doggedness on the part of 
those right-wing Republican hosts to hang in there and continue to 
criticize the process,' said Michael Harrison, editor of Talkers magazine, 
which focuses on the talk radio industry. ``They criticize the president 
and they criticize the American public for not caring. I call it the 
`you people' approach, as in `you people don't realize.' '' One of 
the biggest problems anti-impeachment organizers have faced is that 
many people assumed, after the Nov. 3 elections and the fall of Newt 
Gingrich, that the push for impeachment was over. ``People have commented 
that there seems to be a lot of silence out there,'' said Nancy Coleman, 
the spokeswoman for People for the American Way. ``I think there's 
a lot of disbelief out there about this. But with these hearings on 
again, I think it's beginning to sink in to people that it's really 
happening.''
