Palestinian men, women and even children huddle together for hours 
each day in a cramped, guarded tent with no bathrooms, no running 
water, nowhere to sit but the ground and nothing to look at but the 
barbed-wire surrounding them in Israel's maximum-security prison. 
These aren't the prisoners, they're the visiting relatives. Hundreds 
of thousands of Palestinians have passed through Israeli jails over 
three decades of Israeli occupation in the West Bank and Gaza Strip. 
Some served three months, some 30 years, mostly on charges of militant 
or political acts against the Jewish state. Those who were not arrested 
had at least one family member who was, making the issue of prisoner 
releases in the wake of peace deals with Israel one of the most emotional 
quests for the Palestinian public and its leadership. It has united 
members from every political and social group in Palestinian society, 
and divided those on the Israeli side. ``When two peoples at war make 
peace, they hand over each other's soldiers and prisoners and treat 
each other like equals. There will be no peace between the Palestinian 
people and the Israeli people as long as one Palestinian security 
prisoner remains in jail,'' said Hisham Abdel Razek, who served 21 
years in Israeli jails and is now Minister for Prisoner Affairs in 
Yasser Arafat's Palestinian Authority. Widespread demonstrations for 
the release of 2,400 so-called security prisoners _ often violent 
and often orchestrated by Palestinian Authority officials _ have been 
held almost daily since the two sides signed their latest Mideast 
accord in Washington in October. Palestinians had hoped the deal would 
mean the release of their relatives. Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin 
Netanyahu, however, insists that none of the 750 promised releases 
will include those involved in plotting or executing attacks against 
Israelis. The United States, which brokered the deal, has not backed 
up Palestinian claims that Israel is in violation of the agreement 
on the prisoner issue, though it has hinted that the spirit of the 
accord has been harmed by the dispute. U.S. President Bill Clinton 
has promised to try to resolve the problem. But with the issue burning 
in the streets and at the negotiating table, even veteran Israeli 
security chief Gidon Ezra, now a lawmaker in Netanyahu's Likud party, 
says the hard line on prisoners needs to be re-examined. ``The release 
of murderers is one of the most difficult things that can happen. 
But on the other hand ... there are those who have been in jail for 
more than 20 years and we need to tell them there is a light at the 
end of the tunnel,'' Ezra told Israel radio. Every day, 12th graf
