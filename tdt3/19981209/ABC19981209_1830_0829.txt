The Supreme Court heard arguments today on the most important civil 
rights case it will consider this term. It is the challenge to a law 
in Chicago designed originally to get at chicago's notorious gangs. 
The law prohibits loitering on a public street. Here's ABC's Terry 
Moran. On these Chicago streets, gang violence has taken a terrible 
toll. My 3-year-old was killed by a 25-year-old gangbanger. The gangs 
control these neighborhoods. Others live in fear. You're liable to 
come out of your house and five or six guys sitting up on your Porch. 
You can't go out of your own stairs. In 1992, Chicago passed an anti-loitering 
law that allowed police to order people standing on the street to 
move along if the officer believed one person in the group was a gang 
member. Failure to obey could result in arrest and up to six months 
in jail. In three years, more than 40,000 people were arrested under 
the law. Chicago's 11th police district, historically one of the city's 
highest crime areas, was ground zero for the anti-loitering ordinance. 
And it was here, the law's supporters say, that its success was most 
striking. By some estimates, crime decreased by more than 23% here. 
Police say open-air drug selling also declined. But the ACLU argued 
the law was so vague, people couldn't know whether what they were 
doing was illegal. And the Illinois courts agreed, striking it down 
as unconstitutional. Today, at the Supreme Court, most of the justices 
were sharply skeptical about Chicago's law, grilling the city's lawyer 
on the dangers of arresting innocent people. This justice observed 
some people with nothing better to do like to sit and watch the cars 
go by. But justice antonin Scalia defended the law, asking, "how do 
you distinguish this from nighttime road blockades to check for drunken 
drivers?" Outside the court, Chicago residents had an impassioned 
answer to the abstractions and hypotheticals. They don't live there. 
The chief justice don't live there. The Illinois Supreme Court don't 
live there. They don't have this problem. You don't live there, and 
you don't have this problem. Now, the Supreme Court must decide between 
freedom on these streets and safety. Terry Moran, ABC News.
