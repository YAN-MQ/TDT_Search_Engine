Away from the clattering miniature electric trains and the twinkling 
Christmas tree tickling the glass roof of the Enid Haupt Conservatory 
came a moment of truth: ``It smells like winter out here,'' said Ashali 
Bhandari, 7, of Manhattan. It should have: She was looking at the 
Winter Solstice Garden at the New York Botanical Garden in the Bronx, 
where freshly cut branches of 100 spruce trees have been made into 
furry hedges and carpets outdoors at the entrance to the Palm Dome. 
Worked into the intricate display of more than 20 outsize evergreen 
chessmen, medieval jousting standards and fat Russian hats are enough 
silver reindeer moss and pungent blueberry juniper berries for Santa's 
team to browse on all winter. Lying on a hedge are 40 gleaming balls. 
Not the usual colored glass, they are darkly streaked like marbled 
halvah and nestle down heavily in the spruce branches. In fact, they 
are solid onyx. Gary Barnum and his collaborators from Cooperstown, 
N.Y., who put this winter garden together, call them the ``fallen 
apples.'' Think Eden. For five years Barnum, Timothy Gill and Tony 
Costanzo, who call themselves Fernleigh Productions, have decorated 
Cooperstown for the winter holidays as part of their horticultural 
beautification program for the Clark Foundation there. This year they 
are displaying their work in New York at the invitation of the garden's 
director, Gregory Long. Planning began in January. Their style, based 
on the classical orders of architecture, looks more like phantasmagoric 
green sculpture than holiday decoration. The challenge was how to 
adapt small-town porch and pediment ornaments to the larger scale 
of the botanical garden, particularly the imposing glass and iron 
conservatory, with its daytime glitter and evening glow. Fifteen pear 
trees, each 22 feet tall and twined with 1,800 lights, frame other 
treasures, including the garden's focal point, a five-tier, 12-foot 
topiary tree with elaborately jeweled mosaic surfaces of red and brown 
fruits, nuts, ferns and dried flowers. Its radial geometry echoes 
that of the nearby huge glass house, and the tree is so firmly proportioned 
it holds the eye despite the competition. ``We aim for amplitude,'' 
Barnum said, patting his little David of a tree, ``and with the conservatory 
ballooning up behind, we wanted to give the effect of lift and motion.'' 
They have done that by dividing the five tiers in wedges, suggesting 
a liftoff. Barnum calls it the ``Gozzoli tree,'' after the Renaissance 
artist who in the mid-15th century included startling topiary trees 
studded with fruit in the otherwise naturalistic landscape of his 
mural ``The Journey of the Magi'' in the Medici-Riccardi chapel in 
Florence, Italy. The same surreal segue from nature into fantasy and 
back happens in the Winter Solstice Garden. Beech leaves rustle in 
the taller standards just as they do in the botanical garden woods, 
where sweet-gum balls inlaid in the mosaics were collected from trees 
last year. The all-natural artifice in the solstice garden contrasts 
with the nature around it. Barnum makes winter darkness a pleasure: 
At dusk, only the pear trees are brightly lighted. Elsewhere, tiny 
spotlights pick out the hand-forged iron standards and strap work. 
Tinsel is forbidden, but lead, it turns out, makes a gleaming holiday 
decoration, as do brass chains from a jewelers' supply store cut into 
three-inch golden danglers that tremble enticingly on the Gozzoli 
tree. Visitors find the weird transformations infectious. ``I feel 
like it's from pagan times,'' said Martin Kietoff, 71, a constant 
visitor at the botanical garden. ``The way cave men would have designed 
a tree.'' The Winter Solstice Garden will be on display through Jan. 
10. In that period, the botanical garden will be open 10 a.m. to 5 
p.m. Tuesdays through Thursdays and 10 a.m. to 8 p.m. Fridays through 
Sundays (closed Christmas). Admission to the grounds is $3 for adults, 
$2 for those 62 and older, $1 for children 2 to 12. Information: (718) 
817-8700.
