In Iraq today, the first incident between the Iraqis and the U.N. 
weapons inspectors since the U.N. went back into Iraq. When the inspectors 
showed up at an office of Saddam Hussein's ruling political party, 
the Iraqis demanded a list of what the U.N. was looking for. They 
were apparently citing rules that require such a list if the U.N. 
makes a surprise visit like this. The U.N. says those are old rules. 
A U.S. official said one failed visit will not lead to war.
