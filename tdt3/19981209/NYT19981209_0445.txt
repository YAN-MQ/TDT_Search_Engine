As homicide rates have dropped the past few years, criminal-justice 
experts have warned that they could soon rise again as a generation 
of superpredator juveniles came of age. But that fear is being called 
into question by new studies that show that virtually all the increase 
in homicides by juveniles in the late 1980s was attributable to crimes 
committed with handguns, not to a change in the nature of teen-agers. 
While the rate of killings by juveniles tripled from 1986 to 1993 
and has fallen since, the rate of homicides by juveniles with other 
weapons has not changed. The new research on juvenile violence also 
suggests that much of the increase in arrests of juveniles in aggravated 
assaults in the late 1980s was not because teen-agers were more violent, 
but the result of increased police activity, as officers arrested 
young people in altercations that would have been ignored earlier. 
``What is happening is that the juvenile justice system is getting 
more kids into it, but the kids aren't any different than they were 
a generation ago,'' said Howard Snyder, director for research at the 
National Center for Juvenile Justice in Pittsburgh, the research arm 
of the National Association of Juvenile and Family Court Judges. ``The 
kids' DNA has not changed.'' Snyder wrote one of the new research 
studies , which he will present on Thursday in Washington to the annual 
conference of the Office of Juvenile Justice and Delinquency Prevention, 
a branch of the Justice Department. Prof. Franklin Zimring, who wrote 
another of the studies, presented at a news conference in Washington 
Wednesday, said that the reclassification by the police of juvenile 
fights into aggravated assaults ``created a completely artificial 
crime wave.'' ``The truth is that all during the late '80s and early 
'90s, while we worried about superpredators, the average case of juvenile 
violence was becoming less serious every year,'' Zimring said. Aggravated 
assaults account for by far the largest number of violent crimes in 
the major crime index maintained by the FBI. The other violent crimes 
are rape, robbery and homicide. Zimring is director of the Earl Warren 
Legal Institute at the University of California at Berkeley and author 
of a new book, ``American Youth Violence'' (Oxford University Press, 
December 1998), funded by the MacArthur Foundation. Zimring found 
that arrests of juveniles in robbery and rape in 1997 fell below the 
level for 1980. Overall, he said, ``Youth in 1998 are no more prone 
to violence than were teens 20 years ago.'' But Alfred Blumstein, 
a criminologist at Carnegie Mellon University, cautioned that this 
ignored the fact that homicides by juveniles remained higher than 
they were in the early 1980s, before the advent of crack cocaine, 
semiautomatic handguns and gangs sparked the surge in killings by 
teen-agers. The rate of homicide by juveniles 14 to 17 years old jumped 
from 8.5 per 100,000 in 1984 to 30.2 per 100,000 in 1993, then declined 
to 16.5 per 100,000 in 1997, said Prof. James Alan Fox, dean of the 
College of Criminal Justice at Northeastern University. But Zimring 
said most people failed to realize that the increase, and more recently, 
decrease, really involved the role of handguns, and not evidence of 
a ``violent new breed'' of teen-agers. Since the police in many big 
cities have begun aggressive programs to take guns away from juveniles, 
the juvenile homicide rate has dropped, he said. Unfortunately, Zimring 
said, the public and politicians have been misled by their fears into 
passing tough laws enabling states to try more juveniles as adults, 
and these laws are likely to remain on the books despite research 
showing the juvenile crime wave was misunderstood or exaggerated. 
Zimring criticized some politicians, including Rep. Bill McCollum, 
R.-Fla., the chairman of the House Subcommittee on Crime, and some 
of his fellow criminologists, for predicting a ``coming crime storm'' 
as the teen-age population increases in the next 15 years. Fox has 
warned for several years that despite the recent drop in juvenile 
crime the worst may not be over because the number of people ages 
14 to 24, the most crime-prone age group, after reaching a low of 
40 million in 1992, will rise to 50 million in 2010. ``He can call 
me an alarmist,'' Fox said. ``I was trying to send a message to get 
people's attention. Whether they responded as I wanted is another 
question.'' ``I think we still have a problem, because of the same 
chronic problems, from easy access to guns, to lack of parental supervision 
to television violence,'' he said. ``If we start putting our heads 
in the sand and say there was no crime wave, it will come back.''
