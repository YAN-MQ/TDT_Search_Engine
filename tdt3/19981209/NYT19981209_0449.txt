The Spanish judge who issued the arrest warrant for Gen. Augusto Pinochet 
of Chile will complete the criminal indictment against him this week 
and immediately send it to London, a Madrid court official said Wednesday. 
``The indictment will support the accusation against Pinochet and 
it's logical that it be sent as soon as possible to show the charges 
against him,'' said the official, who spoke on condition that he not 
be identified. The indictment could come as early as Thursday and 
is the next legal step after the formal extradition request, which 
the Spanish judge, Baltasar Garzon, sent to Britain last month. It 
listed more than 3,000 people who were killed or disappeared under 
Pinochet's 17-year military rule. Garzon, an investigating magistrate 
at Spain's National Court, requested permission in October to interview 
Pinochet in London, but British officials are unlikely to allow it 
while the extradition hearing is pending, the court official said.
