In a new challenge to the U.N. search for illegal weapons in Iraq, 
a team of inspectors was turned back Wednesday when it tried to enter 
a major office of the ruling party, a key site of Saddam Hussein's 
government. Richard Butler, head of the U.N. Special Commission, which 
oversees inspections, called the Iraqi action ``a blockage.'' ``This 
was an absolutely legal no-notice inspection and they blocked us,'' 
he told The Associated Press in New York. The inspectors withdrew 
after an Iraqi official demanded that they first provide a written 
declaration ``on the material and items'' they sought, the official 
Iraqi News Agency said. The incident _ which has the potential to 
blow into another crisis _ came two days after Butler announced that 
he was ordering the resumption of the so-called surprise inspections. 
On Tuesday, the inspectors visited 32 sites. Butler said the Iraqi 
demand for a written notice is ``simply wrong'' and ``nonsense.'' 
Iraq, which had suspended the inspections in August, allowed them 
to resume only last month, averting a military strike by the United 
States and Britain. The two countries have left an armada in the Gulf 
to ensure Iraq abides by its promise to cooperate fully with the inspectors. 
UNSCOM must certify that Iraq has eliminated its chemical, biological 
and nuclear weapons as well as long-range missiles before U.N. economic 
sanctions can be lifted. The sanctions were imposed after the 1990 
Iraqi invasion of Kuwait, and Iraqi officials have long insisted they 
have eliminated all illegal weapons. The United States reacted cautiously 
Wednesday to Iraq's action. David Leavy, a spokesman for the National 
Security Council, said the U.S. government was awaiting an assessment 
by Butler next week of Iraq's overall compliance with U.N. requirements. 
``As the president has said, if UNSCOM cannot do its job effectively, 
we remain poised to act,'' Leavy said. He declined to say what would 
trigger U.S. military action. Wednesday's disagreement was played 
out outside one of the four branch headquarters of the Baath Party 
in Baghdad. A U.N. inspection team tried to get into the building 
Wednesday morning ``in a surprising and provocative manner,'' INA 
said, quoting Gen. Hossam Mohammed Amin, who heads an office that 
liaises with the inspectors. He complained that the team was seeking 
a confrontation. ``The practices of the inspectors .... have the clear 
goal of creating crises and problems,'' Amin said. Ewen Buchanan, 
the inspectors' spokesman in New York, said this round of inspections, 
which were scheduled to end Monday, would continue. He did not know 
whether inspectors would try to enter the site again. Caroline Cross, 
a U.N. spokeswoman in Baghdad, said earlier that ``a little less than 
200'' inspectors were working in Iraq. When asked if they would carry 
out surprise visits, she said only the ``inspectors will carry on 
a full range of activities.'' Unannounced visits in the past have 
been a major source of friction with Iraq, leading to three crises 
in the past year. Iraqi newspapers carried further accounts Wednesday 
of comments by Deputy Prime Minister Tariq Aziz in Moscow in which 
he said there is a limit to Iraq's cooperation with the United Nations 
in the search for weapons of mass destruction. ``This situation is 
no longer acceptable,'' Aziz said, referring to the U.N. sanctions 
that have blocked free export of Iraq's oil. Meanwhile, in a letter 
released Wednesday, Iraqi Foreign Minister Mohammed Saeed al-Sahhaf 
appealed for help from Arab countries, which he said had largely deserted 
Iraq. ``Iraqis in their neighborhoods, cities and villages wonder 
where are their brother Arabs and where is the Arab League and its 
secretary general with what is happening to their brothers in Iraq,'' 
al-Sahhaf in a letter to the Cairo-based league. In November, several 
key Arab countries declared that Iraq would be held responsible for 
any conflict.
