For those who who have failed to be caught up in the ballroom dancing 
boom sweeping people back off their feet, the World Wide Web may offer 
salvation. A new Library of Congress Web site allows users to lace 
up their dancing shoes and learn steps for the waltz, the Charleston, 
and the fox trot _ with no need to endure the self-conscious awkwardness 
that marked many of those old school-gym dance classes. The site, 
An American Ballroom Companion: Dance Instruction Manuals Circa 1490-1920, 
memory.loc.gov/ammem/dihtml/dihome.html is a collection of over 200 
social dance manuals covering etiquette, technique, and dance history. 
The site also includes some anti-dance treatises. The chronological 
series begins with a rare fifteenth-century source for the basse danse, 
a Burgundian court dance, continues through clog dances, waltzes, 
and ballet, and ends in the ragtime era. ``This site provides an opportunity 
for people interested in dance to look at rare material not available 
in most local libraries.'' said Elizabeth Aldrich, a dance historian 
and choreographer, who served as a consultant on the project. A special 
feature in the works is 80 video demonstrations of assorted historic 
dances. The dance demonstrations are set to music and provided as 
links at relevant places in the dance descriptions, as well as through 
a video directory. The video clips, each lasting about a minute, include 
close-up tutorials for particular steps. There are also selections 
from a reconstructed 1890s ballroom performance in the Library's Great 
Hall. And what about those with two left feet? Not to worry, said 
Vicki Risner, a dance specialist at the Library of Congress. ``Anybody 
who wants to learn how to dance can do so,'' she said. ``Recreational 
dancers are raving about this site, because it gives them a whole 
new repertoire.'' Sprinkled throughout the site are rich and entertaining 
nuggets of dance culture like ``Tips to dancers,'' a 1918 dissertation 
on ball-room gentility by V. Persis Dewey. Among his subjects, Dewey 
describes the evils of the ``ballroom snob,'' who is ``grossly conceited'' 
and does ``underhanded things in the dance hall.'' T. A. Faulkner, 
in the anti-dance polemic ``From the Ballroom to Hell,'' asks: ``Did 
you ever know a lady who danced to excess to live to be over twenty-five 
years of age? If she does she is, in most instances, broken in health 
physically and morally. Doctors claim it to be a most harmful exercise 
physically for both sexes ... Is there any wonder that so many women 
of today are unhealthy?'' For those who feel the music, or at least 
wish they did, the web offers other resources that cater to dancers 
of all kinds and every experience level. The U.S. Swing Dance Server, 
simon.cs.cornell.edu/info/people/aswin/swingdancing/swingdancing.htm 
l, offers swing music, essays on proper dance technique, and Arthur 
Murray-style dance instructions. Visitors may order swing videos, 
enter chat rooms designed for swing-lovers, or simply peruse the latest 
swing news. Another site, ``Dancing for Busy People,'' www.henge.com/calvin, 
has instructions for an array of dances, including contradancing, 
square dancing and quadrilles. The site also has listings of national 
dance events and articles about dancing. Dancing has arrived on the 
world wide web. So log on, adjust the volume, grab a partner and tango 
the night away.
