If we ever arrive at that point in history where machines become our 
masters, it will have all begun with machine vision. Machine vision 
allows assembly-line robots to locate and identify parts to inspect, 
count, measure and verify objects in a variety of industrial processes. 
In other words, for at least some things we can do, they can do them 
better. ``It's a way of giving computers eyes,'' explained Art Molella, 
director of the Lemelson Center at the National Museum of American 
History at the Smithsonian. ``It's obviously something that has revolutionized 
assembly lines.'' The essential hardware components are relatively 
common: a video camera, a personal computer, a sensor and a frame 
grabber, which captures a still picture from a moving video image. 
There is something slightly menacing about hunks of wire and metal 
that can see more clearly for some tasks, thus performing them with 
more accuracy than their human creators _ even if those hunks of metal 
are still a far, far cry from the Terminator. Machine vision was conceived 
in the mid-1950s by Jerome H. Lemelson, an independent inventor with 
more than 500 patents. The Big Three automakers initially rejected 
Lemelson's suggestions for automating assembly lines. But Japanese 
automakers did not, and they leaped ahead in quality and productivity 
for a while. Detroit eventually caught on. But Lemelson's contribution 
to automotive excellence went largely unrewarded until his patents 
came through decades later. The importance of machine vision goes 
beyond its commercial value, Molella said. ``What's more important 
is the path it has opened toward artificial intelligence and robotics 
in general,'' he said. ``It has fed the imagination as well as the 
assembly lines.'' Some machine vision systems, like those used to 
inspect fruit, can ``see'' in color, but most find black and white 
adequate. A computer can distinguish between 256 shades of gray. The 
human eye? About 64 shades. While humans need two eyes for good depth 
perception, most machine vision systems find one camera sufficient. 
Since the system knows the actual size of an object it is scanning 
for, it can use the size of the object's image and the angle at which 
light from the object strikes the system's lens to calculate its position. 
Machine vision has humans beat hands down when it comes to consistency. 
There's no more worrying that the night shift will see things differently 
from the day shift. Robots are more precise than assembly line workers, 
said Joe Campbell, vice president for marketing at Adept Technology, 
a maker of industrial robots in San Jose, Calif. A robot with a machine 
vision system can be built and programmed to perform a wide range 
tasks: picking up a single bolt from a jumble on a conveyor belt and 
screwing it into an engine block, automatically discarding a defective 
soda bottle in a production line or placing a needle on the hub of 
a speedometer moving down a conveyor belt and pointing it exactly 
to zero. Machine vision systems use video cameras and perceive objects 
by using mathematical approaches that look for patterns in pixelated 
video images. Many of the mathematical formulas were developed decades 
ago. The biggest advances in recent years have come from improved 
cable couplings and faster computers, which allow the systems to work 
more quickly. The speed at which machine vision systems can perform 
a function is doubling every couple of years, said Tom Reynolds, general 
manager of Advanced Control Technologies, based in Laguna Hills, Calif. 
``Three years ago, we could do 3 inspections a second,'' Reynolds 
said. ``Now we can do 10; a year from now it will be 20.'' Let's see, 
that means we humans should be safe from machines' taking over the 
world until, oh, at least 2033.
