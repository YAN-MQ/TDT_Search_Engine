Prisoners Israel regards as murderers are ``heroes,'' Yasser Arafat 
told cheering crowds Wednesday, four days before U.S. President Bill 
Clinton arrives in the region to prop up the teetering peace accord 
he helped broker. Palestinians rioted Wednesday throughout the West 
Bank, the fourth day of violence sparked by Israel's refusal to release 
prisoners detained on terrorist charges. ``We tell our heroes in the 
prisons we will not close our eyes until we see them in front of our 
eyes,'' Arafat told about 1,000 people attending a conference of his 
Fatah faction. The crowd cheered, ``If you want fighters, we will 
be your fighters.'' Netanyahu has repeatedly denied that he agreed 
to release Palestinians convicted of attacks on Israelis. He has sworn 
not to release ``murderers.'' ``Why would anyone who declares that 
he wants peace would want to release these type of people?'' Israeli 
government spokesman Moshe Fogel said, in reaction to Arafat's remarks. 
Arafat told the crowd that during the Wye River negotiations in October, 
Clinton even named some of the security prisoners to be released. 
The Clinton Administration was scrambling to salvage the Wye agreement 
before the president's arrival on Saturday. U.S. Secretary of State 
Madeleine Albright demanded that Israel and the Palestinians stick 
to its terms. Her appeals _ and a firefighting visit to the region 
by top U.S. Mideast envoy Dennis Ross _ appeared to go unheeded. Netanyahu 
continued to insist that a troop withdrawal scheduled for next week 
would be delayed. Arafat told his followers that he had defied a plea 
by Ross to avoid angering Israelis by not referring in public to a 
possible unilateral declaration of statehood. ``They told me not to 
use or say the word state,'' he said. ``I told we have said it already 
and that is it.'' In a dig at Israeli apprehensions about the Clinton 
visit, Arafat said he believed he had Clinton's implicit backing for 
statehood in any case. ``There are six ministers in the Israeli government 
who do not welcome his coming,'' Arafat said of Clinton. ``He insists 
on coming because he recognizes this people and homeland.'' ``We welcome 
the president's visit unequivocally,'' Fogel countered. Arafat pressed 
another button by pledging that Jerusalem _ which Israel says will 
remain entirely under its sovereignty _ will one day be Palestine's 
capital. ``Jerusalem is the capital of the Palestinian state,'' Arafat 
said. On Wednesday _ the 11th anniversary of their uprising against 
Israel _ hundreds of Palestinians stoned Israeli troops and motorists 
throughout the West Bank. Soldiers responded with rubber bullets, 
live rounds and tear gas, killing a Palestinian teen-ager and injuring 
69 others. Three Israeli civilians and two Israeli troops were lightly 
hurt by stones. ``I am happy that this meeting is being held in view 
of the hard challenges that you face every day from the Israeli army, 
the settlers,'' Arafat said, alluding to the recent swell of violence. 
That kind of statement indicated that the Palestinian Authority _ 
despite its insistent denials _ was behind the violence, according 
to the Israel government spokesman. ``It is hypocritical to incite 
and encourage violence to be directed at Israelis,'' Fogel said, ``and 
then bemoan the consequences when Palestinians are injured in the 
course of this violence.''
