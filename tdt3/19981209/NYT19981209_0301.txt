For the first time in more than half a century, the U.N. General Assembly 
decided Wednesday to list anti-Semitism as a form of racism. The resolution 
was adopted by consensus on the 50th anniversary of the international 
convention against genocide and a day before the United Nations celebrates 
the 50th anniversary of the Universal Declaration of Human Rights. 
In a resolution introduced by Indonesia on behalf of more than 100 
developing nations, the Assembly also warned against new avenues for 
disseminating the ``repugnant views'' of racist organizations, and 
asked governments to monitor communications for misuse. Germany and 
Turkey co-sponsored the resolution. General Assembly resolutions do 
not carry the force of Security Council resolutions, but they reflect 
world opinion. In the past, the Assembly had voted to equate Zionism 
with racism. After the Cold War ended, the United States was able 
to have those definitions removed from annual Assembly resolutions 
on human rights. This year the Clinton administration lobbied hard 
to include a condemnation of anti-Semitism in the resolution, titled 
Measures to Combat Contemporary Forms of Racism, Racial Discrimination, 
Xenophobia and Related Intolerance. ``The U.N. is about tolerance 
and inclusion,'' said Felice Gaer, director of Jacob Blaustein Institute 
for the Advancement of Human Rights, at the American Jewish Committee. 
``But this is the first time that the U.N. has used the phrase `anti-Semitism,' 
which has been fought over for years and kept out of any resolutions.'' 
The phrase just narrowly made it into the resolution. In a paragraph 
whose language Geraldine Ferraro helped negotiate four years ago when 
she was the chief American representative at the U.N. Human Rights 
Commission, the General Assembly listed a number of targets to be 
investigated by the United Nations monitor on racism. The monitor, 
known as a special rapporteur, was asked to examine racist incidents 
``against blacks, Arabs and Muslims'' and ``xenophobia, Negrophobia, 
anti-Semitism and related intolerance.'' Secretary General Kofi Annan 
has lent his voice to broadening definitions of intolerance, and for 
changes in the attitude of members toward Israel, which is still denied 
a place in any of the organization's regional groups. It is these 
groups that choose candidates for rotating Security Council seats 
and other positions. In a speech in March in Jerusalem to the Israel 
Foreign Relations Council and the U.N. Association of Israel, Annan 
said he was aware that ``the United Nations is regarded by many as 
biased against the State of Israel.'' ``I know that Israelis see hypocrisy 
and double standards in the intense scrutiny given to some of its 
actions, while other situations fail to elicit the world's outrage 
and condemnations,'' he said. ``I know that Israelis are offended 
when other nations' delegates leave the room as Israelis rise to speak.'' 
Annan said it was time ``to usher in a new era of relations between 
Israel and the United Nations.''
