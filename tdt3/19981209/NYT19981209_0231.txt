History arises at unexpected moments. For the descendants of Abraham 
and Fannie Rogarshevsky, it came between the dill pickles and the 
corned beef sandwiches. Family memories, some of them coaxed over 
lunch, have been indispensable in recreating the Rogarshevskys' tiny 
three-room Orchard Street apartment, circa 1918, a permanent exhibit 
(and the fifth apartment the museum has restored in its 1863 red-brick 
landmark) opening Thursday at the Lower East Side Tenement Museum. 
At a family reunion at the museum last spring, where the conversation 
also drifted to the Rogarshevsky women's gorgeous complexions, 77-year-old 
Florence Rosenthal recalled how, as a young girl, she used to sit 
on the tenement's steps coloring lingerie brochures with crayons because 
the family couldn't afford coloring books. Roby Langert, 53, remembered 
the precious pennies her great-grandma Fannie kept in a jar. For Arnold 
Rosenthal, 75, the essence of the place was ``the people coming and 
going, the gossip.'' As he poked around the apartment, he wasn't thinking 
about how a family of eight made do in 325 square feet but about what 
his uncle used to say in praise of baldness: ``Grass doesn't grow 
on a busy street!'' Piece by piece, Pamela Keech, the consulting curator, 
has been untangling the family memories, some more reliable than others 
due to the passage of time. Abraham and Fannie Rogarshevsky's descendants 
(the name was changed to Rosenthal in the 1920s ) were tracked down 
through advertising in the Forward newspaper and Modern Maturity magazine. 
At times, the process has resembled the traditional prenuptial ball 
of knots, like the one Fannie presented to her prospective daughter-in-law. 
``If my mother could sit there and unknot them,'' said Nathalie Dickstein, 
``it would prove to Grandma that she was patient.'' Such stories have 
been one element in an elaborate tapestry of sources _ including crime-scene 
photographs of similar apartments _ that Ms. Keech used to recreate 
the apartment as it looked on July 12, 1918, when Abraham, a garment 
presser, died of tuberculosis at age 45. In this fragment of frozen 
time, the Rogarshevskys are sitting shiva _ observing the Jewish rituals 
of mourning. In reconstructing the apartment, Ms. Keech's task was 
to unearth the material culture of the poor and working class, what 
she calls ``the decorative arts history that nobody knows.'' Though 
conditions at 97 Orchard St. were harsh (indoor toilets did not arrive 
until 1905, and then only in hallways), the visual richness of the 
decor has surprised curators and counters images of a spare tenement 
life popularized by photodocumentarians like Jacob Riis. During excavations 
of the apartment where Fannie resided until 1941, some 22 layers of 
wallpaper were discovered: they were changed as often as every two 
years. Elsewhere in the building, gold leaf touches and bronzing powder 
on picture rails have been found. Decoration was the bane of housing 
reformers, who loathed clutter and advocated pristine rooms with white 
walls. ``All our research has consistently challenged notions of what 
tenement life was like,'' said Renee Epps, the museum's vice president. 
``Squalor was an atypical situation. Families like the Rogarshevskys 
were house proud.'' Orthodox Jewish immigrants from Telz, Lithuania, 
the Rogarshevskys moved into the building with their four boys and 
two girls in 1910. They were one of the largest families in the building, 
which was home to a total of about 10,000 people between 1863 and 
1935 (Fannie stayed on as caretaker for six years after it officially 
closed). Fannie and Abraham slept in the back room facing the air 
shaft, an amenity for ventilation introduced after the passage of 
the 1901 Tenement Housing Law, which also brought cold running water 
into each apartment. Ida and Bessie slept on a folding cot in the 
kitchen. The four boys slept in the living room across a single couch, 
which they extended by placing four chairs alongside it. Ms. Keech's 
primary source was Evelyn Wallach, the daughter-in-law who successfully 
untied the ball of knots. She was the only eyewitness to how the apartment 
looked in 1918, and she shared her memories with the museum before 
she died, at age 96{. She spoke of the folding cot against the interior 
window and of Fannie's coal stove, which was always immaculate _ ``shiny 
black.'' To supplement recollections, Ms. Keech consulted 1918 tenement 
crime scene photographs from the municipal archives. In contrast to 
family photos, for which interiors were often spruced up, to portray 
their lives in the best light, black-and-white crime photographs ``show 
the way apartments really looked,'' she explained. ``The people were 
killed, so they didn't fix up things up first.'' The photos _ she 
tries to ignore the blood _ inspired several decorating choices in 
the restored Rogarshevsky living room, including calendars as wall 
decor, shelves with lace edging and the placement of pictures high 
on a wall. One of the family's concerns was that the apartment accurately 
reflect Fannie and Abraham's poverty. ``Was there carpeting?'' Steve 
Long, director of the museum's resource and study center, asked 67 
year-old Mrs. Dickstein. ``Linoleum,'' she answered. ``We couldn't 
afford carpeting.'' Did the curtains have tie-backs? ``No tie-backs 
_ no way,'' she replied. Much of the Rogarshevskys' decor would have 
come from secondhand furniture peddlers, so Ms. Keech looked for objects 
``with dings.'' To find appropriate period furniture on a budget of 
$3,000, she scoured flea markets all over the region, carrying photocopies 
from catalogs of merchandise (some of it redeemable with soap coupons). 
She was also on the trail of folk remedies and obscure antique medical 
items such as a 1918 creosote decongestant. The family donated some 
items, such as a white enamelware pail used for salting kosher meat. 
(Still being sought: a Lithuanian pushka, or charity box, which the 
family might have had for money they raised to send to the famous 
yeshiva back in Telz.) The apartment walls themselves had to reflect 
imperfect tenement craftsmanship. Basing his work on existing fragments 
in the building, Kevin Groves, the preservation consultant, re-created 
the uneven plasterwork and wallpaper edging. Some existing imperfections, 
such as a crack in a kitchen cabinet window were preserved as ``areas 
of record.'' While excavating plaster, Groves discovered horsehair 
was used as binder. To rebuild several walls, he imported horsehair 
from his daughter's riding stable in Orange County, N.Y. Within these 
walls, Jewish mourning rituals will be interpreted for visitors. Reflections 
about sitting shiva were gleaned from family members at the reunion 
lunch, which resembled seder dinners, complete with ancient hurts 
and dominant relatives. ``Grandma always liked Henry's side of the 
family better,'' Mrs. Dickstein said over lunch, to no one in particular, 
referring to her great-uncle, Abraham's brother. ``When they came 
over, that's when the matzo meal for the pancakes came out.'' She 
also affectionately described her cousin Albert, now 73, who owned 
a lingerie store right on Orchard Street. ``He could look at a woman 
and tell you her bra size,'' she said. Abraham Rogarshevsky was a 
member of a landsmanshaft, an association of immigrants from the same 
hometown, or shetl. When someone died on the Lower East Side, ``the 
whole neighborhood came to a halt,'' noted David Jacobson, the executive 
director of the United Hebrew Community of New York, a major Jewish 
burial organization. Jacobson advised the museum on Jewish burial 
customs, probing the collective family memory. ``Did they wear slippers 
and not shoes?'' he wanted to know (Yes). ``Did they tear the lapels 
on their suit jackets?'' (a reference to another mourning custom of 
tearing a garment toward the heart upon learning about a death). This 
week, its restoration concluded, the apartment was prepared for mourning, 
the table set with hard-boiled eggs and bagels shellacked for posterity. 
Seeing it for the first time, on Monday, Mrs. Dickstein said with 
pride, ``Grandma is a folk hero.'' But she had some doubts about the 
wallpaper _ the 14th layer uncovered, a dramatic red that was once 
inexpensive but has been handscreened and put into production by Scalamadre 
for $113 a roll as ``Rogarshevsky Scroll.'' She deemed it unquestionably 
``gorgeous.'' ``But,'' she added upon reflection, ``it's perhaps too 
rich-looking for Grandma.'' Tours of the Rogarshevsky and other apartments 
at the Lower East Side Tenement Museum, are given Tuesdays through 
Sundays. Tours start at 90 Orchard St. Reservations are recommended:
