VILNIUS, Lithuania (AP) - Lithuania's highest court on Wednesday declared 
the country's Soviet-era death penalty unconstitutional, saying it 
violated provisions against cruelty and torture, the Baltic News Service 
reported. The death penalty has wide backing in Lithuania, with some 
80 percent of respondents in a recent poll saying they supported capital 
punishment. But the law has been criticized by European human rights 
groups and the European Union has said it was an obstacle to Lithuanian 
membership. Like virtually all other former Soviet republics, Lithuania 
kept its death penalty after independence. It hasn't carried out a 
death sentence since 1995, but capital punishment has remained on 
the books. Wednesday ruling does not immediately abolish the death 
penalty, but it should preclude parliament from including the capital 
punishment in a new criminal code now being considered by parliament, 
BNS said. President Valdas Adamkus, one of the few Lithuanian politicians 
who has spoken out against capital punishment, welcomed the high court's 
ruling. But Stanislovas Buskevicius, a right-wing legislator, warned 
that violent crime was bound to increase without the death penalty. 
``Today is a victory for assassins,'' BNS quoted him as saying.
