Prince Walid bin Talal, the Saudi billionaire businessman known for 
strategic investments in troubled companies, considered buying the 
hedge fund Long-Term Capital Management two months ago but never made 
an offer. The prince was approached by Goldman, Sachs &AMP; Co. to 
determine if his Kingdom Holding Co. had interest in buying the hedge 
fund in Greenwich, Conn. The approach was made soon after Goldman 
and 13 other Wall Street banks and brokerage houses injected $3.6 
billion to save the fund from bankruptcy, people close to Goldman 
said. The talks did not result in an offer by the prince, those people 
said. They did not rule out the possibility that the prince might 
still make a proposal, but they said that they thought no such offer 
was in the works. P.J. Shoucair, assistant executive manager for international 
investments at Kingdom Holding in Riyadh, Saudi Arabia, told Bloomberg 
News on Wednesday that talks to buy Long-Term Capital had ended. ``It 
never got any serious consideration,'' he said. ``It never got beyond 
a half-hour phone call.'' Goldman has tried before to broker a deal 
for a wealthy investor to buy the fund. In the hours before the consortium 
made final its agreement to rescue and assume majority ownership of 
Long-Term Capital in September, Goldman teamed up with investor Warren 
E. Buffett, offering to buy the fund at a steep discount to the market 
value of its assets. Long-Term Capital's partners rejected that offer. 
Several weeks later, after the consortium had taken control, Goldman 
and Buffett made another pass at the hedge fund. In discussions with 
the hedge fund's new board of directors, Buffett asked for an up-front 
commitment that financing would remain in place if he were to buy 
it and that the parties would agree in advance to sell at a discount. 
He never made a formal offer or named the price he would be willing 
to pay, people close to the discussion said, and the talks have ended. 
The urgency to sell Long-Term Capital has eased in recent weeks, in 
part because the market value of its portfolio has risen sharply. 
After losing almost all the original investors' capital by early September, 
and then tumbling after the rescue, the portfolio rose more than 20 
percent, or $700 million, in November. That leaves the Wall Street 
banks that financed its rescue with healthy paper profits, though 
bankers are still cautious about predicting a full recovery.
