Cable TV subscribers can expect a rate hike next year. The industry's 
top executive says rates probably will increase about 4% to 5%, after 
they are deregulated by the government March 31st. Congress set that 
date for the end of regulation, expecting competitive forces to take 
over. But some consumer groups now believe cable competition will 
not be adequately developed by then, and want the date pushed back.
