In the West Bank today, a Palestinian teenager was shot to death and 
60 other protesters were injured during confrontations with Israeli 
soldiers. The violence erupted just four days before President Clinton 
is scheduled to visit the region. NPR's Eric Weiner reports from the 
West Bank town of Ramala. Today's violence was the worst in months. 
Israeli troops fired tear gas, rubber-coated bullets, and possibly 
live ammunition. A 16-year-old Palestinian student was killed after 
Israeli soldiers shot him in the chest. Another Palestinian teenager 
died today, Nasser Varakat, a 17-year-old cousin of Palestinian chief 
negotiator Sy Varakat died from injuries sustained earlier this week 
when he was shot by an Israeli motorist who opened fire after his 
car was stoned. U.S. Middle East envoy Dennis Ross called on both 
sides to deal with the issues at the negotiating table, not on the 
streets. Ross is in Jerusalem trying to get the peace process back 
on track before President Clinton arrives four days from now. This 
is Eric Weiner, NPR NEWS, Ramala.
