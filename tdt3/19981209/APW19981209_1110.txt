PRISTINA, Yugoslavia (AP) _ U.S. envoy Christopher Hill met with ethnic 
Albanian negotiators Wednesday and said efforts to find a political 
settlement to the Kosovo conflict are ``still on track.'' He was scheduled 
to meet later with a spokesman for Kosovo Albanian rebels before heading 
to Belgrade for talks Thursday with Serbian government officials and 
on to Paris to report to the international Contact Group on the Balkans. 
``We believe that our negotiations are still on track,'' he said, 
despite criticism on all sides of the latest U.S. proposal. ``Ultimately 
the responsibility of reaching a settlement rests with both sides,'' 
he said. ``They need to find ways to compromise.'' He acknowledged 
that the ethnic Albanians had objected vociferously to the latest 
plan, while Belgrade ``had a lot of problems with the (earlier) November 
draft.'' Shuttle diplomacy will continue between the sides in efforts 
to reach a settlement, he said. ``I think there is a very strong view 
that we need to speed up the process, we need to get this political 
process to the endgame,'' Hill said. Wolfgang Petritsch, the European 
Union envoy for Kosovo, accompanied Hill in the talks and expressed 
optimism that ``something should be achieved in the next couple of 
weeks.'' ``This is a very decisive point in time,'' he said. ``We 
mustn't lose the momentum.''
