Members of the house Judiciary committee now have a new alternative 
to consider as they decide whether to recommend impeachment articles 
against President Clinton. Former Massachusetts governor William weld 
told the panel he did not think impeachment was appropriate. But he 
thought Congress must do something more serious than censure. The 
republican suggested Congress should adopt a process that would require 
the president to admit wrongdoing, pay a fine and leave himself open 
to prosecution once he's out of office. Several other former prosecutors 
testified they did not think the case was strong enough to win a conviction 
against the president99 president. Some members of the panel said 
they did not think that was their job to decide. The argue has been 
made that in essence, we in the house should, in carrying out our 
responsibility, look to the Senate and make a guess about how the 
proceedings would turn out in the Senate to determine how we exercise 
our responsibility under the constitution. I would suggest to you, 
I don't think that's a proper way for us to proceed. I believe that 
we have an independent responsibility under the constitution to make 
a judgment concerning the conduct of the president, and whether he 
should be impeached or not. And it would be part of our constitutional 
responsibility to attempt to count noses in the Senate. It isn't a 
question, I must say, of counting votes in the Senate. The issue is, 
in thinking through the standard of whether to proceed at the house 
level, whether you think you have adequate evidence to prevail. So 
you are making the judgment. At the end of the day, chief White House 
counsel Charles ruff will present his closing arguments. House Judiciary 
chairman Henry Hyde says his committee will begin debate tomorrow 
on articles of impeachment. And it could vote on whether to send articles 
of impeachment to the full house Friday or Saturday.
