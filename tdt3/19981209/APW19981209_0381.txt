Facing one of the toughest tests of its short tenure, Prime Minister 
Yevgeny Primakov's government gathered Wednesday to work out what 
will be an austere budget in 1999. Primakov convened his top ministers 
behind closed doors, first to discuss military spending and then to 
take on the rest of the budget, which is estimated at 575 billion 
rubles (dlrs 29 billion). The government was not expected to have 
an easy time hammering out the document. Russia faces massive debts 
to international lenders and state workers on one side, and seriously 
shrinking revenues on the other. Primakov said government influence 
over the economy would be stronger next year, but foreign investors 
should not be scared away. ``Steps to protect domestic producers will 
in no way infringe on foreign investment,'' he said in an interview 
with the Nezavisimaya Gazeta newspaper published Wednesday. Primakov 
has said the government will probably not be able to pay off all of 
its dlrs 17.5 billion in foreign debt next year, but he is still promising 
to pay off all state workers. If Primakov is to meet his obligations 
to the country's workers, the government probably will have to print 
more money, an action that will stoke inflation. The International 
Monetary Fund and other lenders have already frozen a dlrs 22.6 billion 
loan package, which Russia is desperate to receive. Some budget projections 
even factor in the loans as part of 1999 revenues. The loans aside, 
initial projections show that the government will cut expenditures 
drastically and try to streamline the country's unwieldy tax system. 
According to the Interfax news agency, the latest version of the budget 
raises the 1999 estimate for the country's output from 3.8 trillion 
rubles (dlrs 190 billion) to 4 trillion rubles (dlrs 200 billion). 
Interfax also projected that 32.6 billion rubles (dlrs 1.6 billion) 
would be printed to cover a portion of the budget deficit, which is 
expected to exceed 100 billion rubles (dlrs 20 billion). Many top 
officials were expecting swift passage for the budget. Compared to 
previous governments, Primakov's team generally has support in the 
Communist-dominated State Duma, or lower house. ``Bearing in mind 
that Primakov enjoys such widespread confidence, he is able to introduce 
a tough budget,'' said former Prime Minister Viktor Chernomyrdin, 
the leader of the Our Home is Russia political movement. Chernomyrdin 
praised early drafts of the 1999 budget, calling it a dose of much-needed 
belt tightening. ``It is the first time such a tough budget is presented,'' 
he said. ``It is time to stop pumping air into the budget and suffering 
from that later. Primakov's full cabinet will meet Thursday, when 
it is expected to approve the final budget draft and pass it along 
to the Duma for approval.
