Boris Yeltsin was released from a hospital Wednesday after more than 
two weeks of treatment for pneumonia, but the Russian leader was not 
expected to return to full-time duty in the Kremlin anytime soon. 
Yeltsin moved to a secluded country residence, Rus, about 100 kilometers 
(60 miles) outside Moscow and planned to remain there for a ``convalescence 
period,'' said his spokesman Dmitry Yakushkin. Yeltsin has rarely 
been seen or heard since he was admitted to the Central Clinical Hospital 
on Nov. 22. He appeared in the Kremlin for three hours on Monday to 
fire several top aides and then returned to his hospital bed. ``Doctors 
are generally satisfied with the president's condition,'' Yakushkin 
told the Interfax news agency. Yeltsin will continue to receive ``periodic 
checkups at the hospital,'' he added. Yeltsin, 67, insists that he 
has no serious health problems, but after so many illnesses in recent 
years, few believe he will be able to maintain a normal working schedule. 
Prime Minister Yevgeny Primakov, who is dealing with the country's 
economic turmoil, said Yeltsin can ``perfectly perform'' his duties 
and will ``work until the end of his term'' in 2000. His remarks were 
published Wednesday in the Nezavisimaya Gazeta newspaper. Primakov 
has handled many presidential duties in recent months, and he gathered 
his top ministers Wednesday to work out next year's austere budget. 
Yeltsin did not have any meetings planned Wednesday and there was 
no word on when he might return to the Kremlin. Yeltsin has been a 
part-time president for months as his health has declined. He has 
said almost nothing about Russia's economic crisis, which hit four 
months ago, partly in response to Asia's economic travails. The president's 
latest illness clearly demonstrated that he is not involved in the 
day-to-day running of the government, though he remains extremely 
sensitive to any suggestions that he's a lame duck, or that he won't 
serve out his term until the year 2000. The president's only major 
announcement during his illness was the dismissal of his aides, some 
of whom had dared to comment on the president's health problems. The 
country remains in a deep recession, with the economy expected to 
shrink about 5 percent this year and forecasts pointing toward a similar 
contraction, if not worse, next year. Russia in the 1990s has suffered 
one of the worst depressions ever experienced by an industrial nation, 
and Yeltsin no longer even pretends to offer solutions to the country's 
entrenched problems.
