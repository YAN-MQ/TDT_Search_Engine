Charles Ruff, the last of President Clinton's lawyers to appear before 
the Judiciary Committee and ``obviously, the president's clean-up 
hitter,'' in the words of one Republican on the committee, somehow 
managed to serve up an often sarcastic defense of Clinton so respectfully 
that the Republicans whose position he was savaging hardly took offense. 
He began with great humility, referring to ``the man whose conduct 
has brought all of us to this moment.'' And unlike another of the 
president's lawyers, David Kendall, he was not talking about Independent 
Counsel Kenneth Starr. Ruff, the White House counsel, went much further 
than either Kendall or Gregory Craig, who testified Tuesday, in addressing 
the specific charges against the president. (Why, he asked, would 
the president conspire to get his secretary to pick up gifts from 
Monica Lewinsky on the same day he gave her more gifts?) And, unlike 
them, he acknowledged that reasonable people might differ about whether 
the president had committed perjury, even as he insisted that, in 
his view, Clinton had not crossed that line. He even said that the 
argument that the president's actions were not impeachable because 
they involved a personal matter was ``misguided.'' He was also the 
first to embrace the legalisms for which Clinton has been widely criticized. 
He said such arguments were ``not just dreamed up by scheming lawyers'' 
but represented vital protections built into the legal system. His 
characterization of his client's behavior as ``wrongful,'' and ``morally 
reprehensible'' seemed to put the committee in the mood to listen. 
His understanding, philosophical nod to their position _ ``No one 
can claim to be free from doubt,'' he told them _ appeared to soothe 
even the president's most ardent critics. Rep. Bob Barr of Georgia, 
perhaps the most pugnacious Republican on the committee, told him, 
``I respect your arguments.'' But Ruff did not, of course, budge from 
the assertion that the president's behavior was bad but not impeachable. 
Over and over, he said that even if, for the sake of argument, Clinton 
had lied and that the lie amounted to perjury, the offense would not 
be impeachable because the president had not acted to ``subvert our 
system of government,'' or been rendered unable to govern. And as 
his presentation went on, he took many opportunities to belittle Starr, 
his witnesses and his case against the president. Contemptuously, 
he said Ms. Lewinsky had started her job search long before she was 
subpoenaed in the Paula Jones sexual harassment suit, after ``she 
was told by her friend _ ahem _ Linda Tripp that she wasn't going 
to get a job in the White House.'' He also mocked Starr's belief in 
a conspiracy and suggested that Starr had accepted everything his 
witnesses said, without applying any of the skepticism, any of ``that 
healthy tension'' that he had seen at work in the proceedings of the 
Judiciary Committee, he said, flattering the committee while demeaning 
their hero. Lanny Davis, who worked with Ruff at the White House, 
referred to the magical properties of what he called Ruff's ``cordial 
toughness.'' He said Wednesday's performance reminded him of a time 
when a Senate committee looking into potential campaign fund-raising 
improprieties learned that videotapes of White House fund-raising 
coffees had turned up six months after it had been told they did not 
exist. ``The anger of the Senate committee counsel was palpable, and 
Ruff's explanation was, `We made an innocent mistake,''' Davis said. 
``No one could have pulled that off other than Chuck Ruff. ``He consistently 
defangs his adversaries,'' he said. Ruff, who grew up in New York 
and graduated from Swarthmore College and Columbia Law School, has 
used a wheelchair since he contracted a virus that left his legs paralyzed 
while teaching law in Liberia as a young man. He was the last Watergate 
special prosecutor, and afterward served as U.S. attorney for the 
District of Columbia. Later, he was a partner at the law firm of Covington 
&AMP; Burling from 1982 until 1995, defending clients like Sen. John 
Glenn, D-Ohio, in the ``Keating Five'' savings and loan investigation 
and Sen. Charles Robb, D-Va., who was acquitted of playing a role 
in the illegal taping of a political opponent. In 1995, Ruff left 
to take a job as the District of Columbia's corporation counsel, a 
relatively low-profile, public-service job. And last year, when he 
became Clinton's counsel, some colleagues were initially put off by 
his reserve but were eventually won over, they said, by his probity, 
his propriety in the best sense of the word. These days, White House 
Deputy Chief of Staff John Podesta calls Ruff the solid oak tree of 
the whole operation.
