BRUSSELS, Belgium (AP) - Ukrainian President Leonid Kuchma will attend 
the NATO summit in Washington this April, his foreign minister, Borys 
Tarasiuk, said Wednesday. It will be the first NATO-Ukraine meeting 
at summit level, Tarasiuk said at a joint news conference with NATO 
Secretary-General Javier Solana. Tarasiuk was speaking after meeting 
with foreign ministers from the 16 NATO countries. At Ukraine's request, 
the three countries due to join NATO next April - Hungary, the Czech 
Republic and Poland, also attended the talks. During the meeting, 
the ministers agreed on a NATO-Ukraine work program for 1999. This 
program will focus on military reform in the Ukraine. ``We will talk 
for example about a budgetary reform of the armed forces,'' Solana 
said. He said NATO and Ukraine had achieved ``very, very important 
progress'' this year in the area of military reform. During Wednesday's 
meeting, NATO and Ukraine also signed a memorandum of understanding 
to send two NATO liaison officers to Kiev, where the Alliance already 
has an information office. ``We expect these liaison officers to strengthen 
NATO-Ukraine cooperation links,'' Tarasiuk said.
