When we come back, "A closer look" at some astonishing things that 
computer designers have in mind for us. Technology on "the cutting 
edge." When they said the world didn't need another nose strip we 
said we'll make one that gives instant relief of nasal congestion 
symptoms and is ergonomically contoured for a good fit. Introducing 
ClearPassage nose strips. After all we're the maker of the Afrin brand 
and who knows more about the nose? Ah, the good old days of supermarket 
shopping. Where nothing stood between you and your next meal. Nothing. 
But today, there are materials that help lock out harmful contaminants 
and reduce spoilage. Keeping us safe and the food we eat fresh. Plastics 
make it possible. So now, the rest is history. Mornings seem so much 
brighter... after a goodight's sleep. That's why I love my Tylenol 
P.M. sometimes I have trouble sleeping. I used to worry about taking 
something. How would I feel in the morning? And then I tried Tylenol 
P.M. it stops my pain and helps me sleep. So in the morning, I'm rested, 
refreshed, ready to make the most of my day. It's Tylenol P.M.
