Sudan has legalized the formation of political groups that may contest 
elections, a government-run newspaper reported Wednesday. President 
Omar el-Bashir signed into law late Tuesday a bill that allows for 
``political associations,'' Al-Anbaa said. The law will come into 
effect Jan. 1. The constitution that was approved in June does not 
mention the right to form political parties, which el-Bashir banned 
after the military coup that brought him to power in 1989. But it 
does grant the right to organize political associations. Some legislators 
have pressed hard to replace such a vague phrase with ``political 
parties,'' but Hassan Turabi, the outgoing speaker of parliament opposed 
such a change. Turabi, an Islamic fundamentalist, is regarded as the 
real power behind the government. Sudanese opposition leaders in exile 
have rejected the new constitution, which is based on Islamic law. 
El-Bashir has said the door is open for dissidents to return from 
exile and form political groups. Earlier this month, Turabi, resigned 
from the speakership to work full time for the National Congress, 
which is effectively Sudan's ruling party. The congress is expected 
to register under the new law. The move means it will no longer be 
funded by the government, officials say.
