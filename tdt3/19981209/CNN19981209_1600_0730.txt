This week on the "cold & flu report" -- you may be blaming this winter's 
unusual warm or cold weather for your first miserable cold of the 
season. There are a number of things, including the weather, that 
contribute to colds. But you can fight back. Perhaps most important, 
say doctors, get plenty of rest. That gives the body extra energy 
to help the immune system, which is working overtime when you're sick. 
And don't try starving a cold. Eat healthful foods and drink plenty 
of liquids. Over-the-counter medicines can help that scratchy throat 
and runny nose.
