A chartered Egyptian airliner was hijacked Wednesday and ordered to 
fly to Libya, police officials said. But they said the craft landed 
in Jerba, Tunisia, a frequent transit point for land travel to Libya. 
The plane, an MD-9O, was hijacked after it took off from San`a, the 
capital of Yemen, en route to the Tunisian capital Tunis. Apparently 
none of the passengers or crew was injured. The pilot contacted Egyptian 
authorities by radio and reported a large number of Libyan passengers 
rioted and demanded he fly to the Libyan capital Tripoli in violation 
of U.N. sanctions against international flights to the country, a 
police official said. About 150 Libyans were aboard the craft, which 
was chartered by a private Egyptian company for a flight by Libyan 
businessmen, a Cairo airport official said. Police said the craft 
itself belongs to EgyptAir, the national carrier. Both the police 
and airport officials spoke on customary condition of anonymity. Libya 
has frequently violated the U.N. flight ban, which was adopted in 
1992 to force Libya to turn over two suspects wanted in the bombing 
of an Pan Am jet over Scotland in 1988. The police official said the 
pilot was told by Egyptian authorities that he could fly to Libya 
under duress without violating sanctions, but the pilot apparently 
tricked the hijackers and landed in Jerba. The hijackers were refusing 
to speak to authorities, the police official said. It was unclear 
if they were still on the plane. An official at Jerba airport, who 
refused to give his name, confirmed the craft had landed there. Jerba, 
an island 350 kilometers (210 miles) south of the capital Tunis, is 
frequently used as a transit point for travelers going on to Libya 
without violating the sanctions.
