Japanese researchers say they've successfully cloned eight calves 
using the dNA of a single cow. They hope cloning cows that are good 
milk and meat producers could help out economically in Japan where 
most beef is imported. The eight calves were cloned much as Dolly 
was last year in Scotland. Researchers replaced the nucleus of an 
egg with a nucleus from an adult cell. The Japanese researchers say 
their technique is much more efficient.
