Like two old gunfighters who had an insignificant skirmish when they 
were young, Dan Marino and John Elway are circling each other for 
only their second shootout, but on Sunday they must first stalk the 
Jets and the Giants. Fifteen years after having been chosen far apart 
in the first round of the 1983 stock show, Marino and Elway are the 
only quarterbacks in National Football League history to have thrown 
for more than 50,000 yards. That adds up to more than 28 miles on 
each's odometer. In Miami on Dec. 21, because of the quirks of the 
NFL schedule formula, they will duel for only the second time. In 
1985 at Denver, the Dolphins won, 30-26, as Marino hit 25 of 43 passes 
for 390 yards and 3 touchdowns. Elway was 18 of 37 for 250, with no 
touchdowns. Their second confrontation couldn't come at a better time 
_ with the Dolphins trying to protect their 1972 Dolphin ancestors' 
17-0 record as the NFL's only undefeated and untied team _ unless 
the Broncos are upset by the Giants at Giants Stadium. Elway's link 
to the Giants is Ernie Accorsi, now the Giants' general manager. Accorsi, 
as the Baltimore Colts' general manager in 1983, selected Elway with 
the No. 1 choice. But when Elway threatened not to report, the Colts' 
owner, Bob Irsay, soon traded Elway to the Broncos. ``I didn't want 
to trade John,'' Accorsi recalled. ``John was talking about playing 
baseball instead, but some people in baseball told me he really wasn't 
a major league prospect, so I was willing to let it play out.'' Irsay 
swapped the negotiation rights to Elway to the Broncos for quarterback 
Mark Herrmann, the rights to offensive tackle Chris Hinton and a 1984 
first-round choice that turned out to be guard Ron Solt. The next 
year, Irsay took the Colts for another ride, to Indianapolis in moving 
vans. In Miami on Sunday night, with first place in the American Conference 
East at stake, Marino will be a reminder of how his now-familiar foe, 
the Jets, ignored him in the draft. So did 25 other teams. Mike Hickey, 
now a stock broker but then the Jets' director of player personnel, 
remembered why. ``Before the draft,'' Hickey recalled, ``the thing 
we were worried about more than anything was that Don Shula would 
trade half his draft to the Colts in order for the Dolphins to get 
Elway with the first choice.'' Because Elway was going to be the obvious 
first choice no matter who was picking. At the time, the Dolphins, 
with David Woodley at quarterback, had just lost Super Bowl XVII to 
the Redskins, 27-17, after having stung the Jets, 14-0, in the American 
Football Conference championship game. When it was the Jets' turn 
with the 26th choice, four quarterbacks had already been selected: 
Elway by the Colts, Todd Blackledge by the Chiefs, Jim Kelly by the 
Bills (he jumped to the United States Football League for three seasons) 
and Tony Eason by the Patriots. Marino was available, but the Jets 
preferred Ken O'Brien, out of Cal-Davis. With the 27th pick, the Dolphins 
took Marino, from Pitt. ``In our mind,'' Hickey said, ``Marino had 
a few things against him. Early that year against a huge North Carolina 
rush, he had thrown the ball up for grabs. He had a knee problem. 
He had football sense but not book sense. Without book sense, we wondered 
how long it would take him to adjust to the Jets' complicated offense.'' 
After the Dolphins took Marino, the Redskins, with the last choice 
in the first round, took Darrell Green, the Texas A&AMP;M cornerback 
headed to the Pro Football Hall of Fame. ``Six or seven months later,'' 
Hickey said, ``I called Bobby Beathard, then the Redskins' general 
manager, and asked him if he would've taken Marino if the Dolphins 
hadn't. He told me, `No, we wanted Darrell Green all along.''' O'Brien 
developed into a decent quarterback for the Jets, while Marino emerged 
as an instant Pro Bowl starter who had no trouble adjusting to Shula's 
offense. He now holds virtually all the NFL passing records, including 
48 touchdown passes in 1984. So the Jets ignored Marino, and Elway 
was traded to the Broncos by the Colts over Accorsi's objections. 
But now, 15 years later against the Jets and the Giants on Sunday, 
both quarterbacks will be throwing passes as only they can.
