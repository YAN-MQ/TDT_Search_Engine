Many things about William Shakespeare's life and work are shrouded 
in mystery, but the mystery of what scholars call his lost years is 
one of the most intriguing of all. What did Shakespeare do between 
1585, when he is known to have left his home in Stratford-on-Avon, 
and 1592, when he re-emerged in London, described as an ``upstart 
crow'' in the account of a rival playwright? And how did he make the 
enormous artistic leap between his early plays, flawed works like 
the bloody ``Titus Andronicus,'' and his romantic masterpiece, ``Romeo 
and Juliet,'' first performed in 1594? No one knows for sure, and 
``Shakespeare in Love'' provides a fanciful explanation by imagining 
the young Shakespeare (Joseph Fiennes) as a nearly unknown actor and 
playwright who finds his poetic voice through a passionate love affair 
with one Viola De Lesseps, a woman as clever as she is beautiful. 
That Viola never actually existed, and that she is played by the certifiably 
American Gwyneth Paltrow (albeit with a plausible English accent), 
didn't matter to the filmmakers. The movie, which opened on Friday, 
is meant to be a high-entertainment mix of fact and fiction, combining 
a modern sensibility with Shakespearean language and period flourishes, 
full of the double meanings and sly jokes that characterize the work 
of Tom Stoppard, its co-writer. ``What's glorious is that so little 
is known about this period that you're not trapped by any kind of 
historical circumstance,'' said John Madden, the director, who is 
accustomed to reading between the lines of English history, his most 
recent film having been ``Mrs. Brown,'' which explored the relationship 
between Queen Victoria and one of her equerries. ``At this point, 
Shakespeare was seen as some sort of hack; his genius was just being 
recognized,'' Madden said. ``One of the great things is to catch him 
at this moment, when he wasn't the Bard, when he was just a jobbing 
actor trying to make his way while suffering from the kind of pressures 
that we all suffer from. At the same time, he has this genius that 
he could just turn on like a tap.'' What is it like to play a man 
whose myth now looms so large in our literary consciousness? Fiennes 
said he soon got over any misgivings. ``Shakespeare is often portrayed 
as a boring, iconic, almost mythical person,'' said Fiennes, 28. ``But 
I embraced Tom's script because it gives him a warmer, more generous 
human touch.'' There was also a darker side to Shakespeare, one that 
is touched on in the film as the playwright freely lifts plot and 
character ideas from other people and mines his experiences for his 
art. ``His love affair is real and profound, and he's lost in the 
chaos,'' Fiennes said, ``but at the same time he's almost a leech, 
constantly looking for copy and almost making things happen in order 
to get a story.'' The formidable cast also includes Ms. Paltrow's 
boyfriend, Ben Affleck, as Ned Alleyn, the actor playing Mercutio 
in the play-within-the-film version of ``Romeo and Juliet''; Geoffrey 
Rush as Philip Henslowe, the theatrical producer; Rupert Everett as 
the playwright Christopher Marlowe, Shakespeare's archrival, and a 
roll-call of British character actors: Imelda Staunton as Viola's 
nurse and confidante; the hunky Colin Firth as Viola's unpleasant 
fiance, the Earl of Wessex, and Judi Dench as a haughty but feminist 
Queen Elizabeth I. The film opens to a theatrical crisis. The wolves 
are at the door: Henslowe, who runs the Rose Theater, is trying to 
beat back competition from its rival, the Curtain, but he is heavily 
in debt and desperately in need of a hit. He hopes that Shakespeare, 
his current playwright-for-hire, will come through with a play that 
gives the public what it seems to want: a romance, a shipwreck and 
some slapstick humor involving an unruly dog. But Shakespeare's play, 
tentatively titled ``Romeo and Ethel, the Pirate's Daughter,'' is 
not being written. Bereft of inspiration, Shakespeare is suffering 
from writer's block, sitting in his garret in London, throwing page 
after page of his work into the garbage. It is not until he meets 
Viola and falls instantly, heavily, in love that he finds the muse 
he has longed for. As the two enter into a steamy, illicit affair 
_ she is rich and has a fiance; he is poor and has a wife back home 
_ he finds that words of love and longing and poetry are flowing, 
as if by magic, from his quill. And the play he ends up writing, ``Romeo 
and Juliet,'' is different from anything he, or anyone else, has ever 
produced. ``Shakespeare was doing something radical for his time,'' 
said Marc Norman, the Hollywood screenwriter who conceived the plot 
some years ago (one of his sons gave him the idea), wrote the initial 
script and is credited as co-writer with Stoppard. ``Playwrights writing 
in that period all adhered to the notion that comedies were comedies 
and tragedies were tragedies, that a comedy is a story about love 
that ends in marriage, and that a tragedy ends in death. But in `Romeo 
and Juliet,' Shakespeare was starting with a comedy and ending with 
a tragedy, and nobody had ever done that before.'' To Norman, the 
most interesting question surrounding the play was how Shakespeare 
was able to leave his more immature work behind and create a piece 
of such grace and power. ``I started to wonder what caused him to 
do that, what caused him to make that choice,'' Norman said. ``I thought, 
`What if he had a love affair with a woman who inspired him in the 
course of writing the play?''' After Norman's initial script, in the 
early 1990s, Tom Stoppard, the witty and erudite playwright who has 
supplemented intellectually challenging plays like ``Arcadia'' and 
``The Invention of Love'' with a succession of screenplays (``Empire 
of the Sun'' and ``Brazil,'' among others) was brought in for rewrites 
(the project then languished in Hollywood limbo for some years, moving 
from Universal to Miramax). The resulting film is unmistakably Stoppardian, 
existing on several levels at once, made for a 20th-century audience 
but full of Elizabethan-era in-jokes and allusions to Shakespeare's 
and others' works. At times, Stoppard has Shakespeare speaking lines 
from his own plays as dialogue in his daily life, and at times he 
interjects very modern witticisms about the plight of writers (Shakespeare 
is forever being mistaken for the far more famous and successful Marlowe) 
and the absurd vanity that pervades the theater. The movie also forms 
a loose parallel to a Shakespearean play itself, lacing its comic 
elements with semitragedy, cross-dressing (Viola defies Elizabethan 
convention and fools even Shakespeare by auditioning for ``Romeo and 
Juliet'' dressed as a boy), and even the odd sword fight or two. A 
number of details are also thrown in for the benefit of those familiar 
with Elizabethan cultural history. There is, for example, a scene 
in which Shakespeare practices writing his name and then settles on 
the now-much-reproduced form of his signature, and there is the emergence 
of a minor character, a boy named John Roberts who plays with rats 
and enjoys the theater only for its blood and gore. The joke is that 
he's the same John Roberts who will go on to write works like ``The 
Duchess of Malfi,'' the Jacobean horror play. But Madden, the director, 
is at pains to make it clear that knowing about Shakespeare and his 
time are not necessary to enjoying the film. ``The screenplay has 
been carefully crafted so that everyone can catch up and understand 
it and follow it,'' he said. ``For anyone who wants to spot the references, 
they're all there, but that absolutely must not be a requirement for 
seeing the film. They're a bonus.'' One suspects that the need to 
tone down the erudition to widen the film's appeal might have sat 
heavily with the clever Stoppard. But he knew what he was getting 
into when he signed up, he said. ``Broadly speaking, in theater the 
director is there to do his best to serve the writer, and in movies 
the writer is there to serve the director,'' he said. ``I wear a very 
different writing hat in movies.'' He continued: ``It's an interesting 
medium, popular film, because it's not a homogeneous audience. They 
get quite schizoid, and they don't know whether they're making the 
film for the critic of The New Yorker or someone who's had a busy 
day in Newark and wants to relax.'' At the same time, Stoppard enjoyed 
not having to worry about historical accuracy. Among other things, 
he was free to make up characters that didn't exist, invent scenes 
that never happened (between Marlowe and Shakespeare, for instance), 
and play around with the essence of his real-life characters in his 
own imagination, something he has done in many of his plays (he has 
also fooled around with Shakespeare before, in ``Rosencranz And Guildenstern 
Are Dead''). ``I have a special take on historical accuracy, which 
is that all supposed historical truths are temporary, meaning they're 
always there to be modified in the light of subsequent discoveries,'' 
Stoppard said. ``But this film is entertainment, which doesn't require 
it to be justified in the light of historical theory.'' For people 
who love the theater, the film also provides ample opportunity to 
laugh at the vanity and puffery that surround the acting world. ``Tom 
has lived his life in the theater and been around that breed,'' Madden 
said of Stoppard. ``He has a wonderfully accurate eye and ear for 
the kind of little fabrications that actors tell each other. It was 
very nice to have the opportunity to send all of that up from a historical 
perspective, where you see the beginnings of modern show business 
developing.'' Many of the people involved in the film also found another 
of its premises _ that a passionate love affair stirs writerly creativity, 
rather than so exhausting the writer that he spends his days sleeping 
off his long nights _ very seductive. Stoppard, for one, has always 
found that to be true. ``I think it happily works both ways,'' he 
said. ``A successful good day's work is a good aphrodisiac, and a 
successful night's lovemaking is quite an inspiration.'' ``Shakespeare 
in Love'' closes with a neat premise, that Shakespeare continues to 
draw inspiration from his romance, immortalizing her in ``The Tempest.'' 
``That's a very romantic thought,'' Stoppard said, ``that she never 
grows old and never dies.''
