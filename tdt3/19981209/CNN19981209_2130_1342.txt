In NFL news -- Rams wide receiver Isaac Bruce is lost for the season 
because of a bad right hamstring. Bruce appeared in just five games 
with 32 catches for 457 yards and a Touchdown. Jacksonville quarterback 
Mark Brunell is out for this weekend's game because of a high sprain 
in his left ankle. That means backup quarterback Jamie Martin will 
be the new starter. Duane Walker, "CNN Headline Sports."
