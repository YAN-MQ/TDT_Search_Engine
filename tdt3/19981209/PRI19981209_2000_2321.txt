You might be familiar with today's geography quiz destination from 
the news pages. But here are a few less obvious clues. In 1854, Sir 
Richard Burton -- not that Richard Burton -- wrote of finding local 
youngsters playing a hockey-like game with sticks and rocks. This 
East African country has been Muslim for hundreds of years and about 
95 percent of the population can trace its ancestry back to two brothers, 
Samal and Sab, who, incidentally, were born into the lineage of the 
Prophet Muhammad. Although recent history has seen an explosion of 
violence within this nation, in olden days disputes were often settled 
through traditional dance and music contests. Not a bad idea. Stick 
around, and we'll have the answer to you in under 10 minutes flat.
