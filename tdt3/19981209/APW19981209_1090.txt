In a new challenge to the U.N. search for illegal weapons in Iraq, 
a team of inspectors was turned back Wednesday when it tried to enter 
a major office of the ruling Baath Party, a key site of Saddam Hussein's 
government. Richard Butler, head of the U.N. Special Commission, which 
oversees inspections, called the Iraqi action ``a blockage.'' ``This 
was an absolutely legal no-notice inspection and they blocked us,'' 
he told The Associated Press in New York. The inspectors withdrew 
after an Iraqi official demanded that they first provide a written 
declaration ``on the material and items'' they sought, the official 
Iraqi News Agency said. The incident _ which has the potential to 
blow into another crisis _ came two days after Butler announced that 
he was ordering the resumption of the so-called surprise inspections. 
On Tuesday, the inspectors visited 32 sites. Butler said the Iraqi 
demand for a written notice is ``simply wrong'' and ``nonsense.'' 
Iraq, which had suspended the inspections in August, allowed them 
to resume only last month, averting a military strike by the United 
States and Britain. The two countries have left an armada in the Gulf 
to ensure Iraq abides by its promise to cooperate fully with the inspectors. 
The United States reacted cautiously to Iraq's action Wednesday. David 
Leavy, a spokesman for the National Security Council, said the administration 
of U.S. President Bill Clinton awaits an assessment by Butler next 
week of Iraq's overall compliance with U.N. requirements. ``As the 
president has said, if UNSCOM cannot do its job effectively, we remain 
poised to act,'' Leavy said. He declined to say what would trigger 
U.S. military action. UNSCOM must certify that Iraq has eliminated 
its chemical, biological and nuclear weapons as well as long-range 
missiles before U.N. economic sanctions can be lifted. The sanctions,
