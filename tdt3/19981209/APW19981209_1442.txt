Ethnic Albanian leader Ibrahim Rugova on Wednesday expressed fear 
of a ``mass ethnic purification'' if the situation in Kosovo escalates. 
But Rugova, who had a 45-minute meeting with President Jacques Chirac, 
also expressed hope that the worst would not come to pass. The cease-fire 
is ``very fragile,'' he told reporters after the meeting, but ``I 
hope that with the efforts of the United States, the European Union, 
France also ... we'll reach something.'' However, Rugova, in Paris 
for 50th anniversary celebrations of the Universal Declaration of 
Human Rights, said that ``if there is an escalation of the situation, 
that will signify the biggest massacre seen to date and I fear -- 
this is not a phobia -- that we could have a mass ethnic purification.'' 
He called for ``great attention'' to the situation from the international 
community. Chirac, in his talks with Rugova, underscored the need 
to ``start discussions without delay'' and warned against a wait which 
extremists ``could profit from to restart the combat.'' Chirac's discussion 
was conveyed by sources at the presidential Elysee Palace, speaking 
on condition of anonymity. Kosovo, a province of Yugoslavia's Serb 
republic, with a majority ethnic Albanian population, is seeking independence. 
The October peace accord was seen as a way to buy time for a diplomatic 
solution acceptable to both Serbs and ethnic Albanians. But fears 
are mounting that full-scale fighting could erupt, perhaps in the 
spring.
