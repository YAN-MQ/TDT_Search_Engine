If your idea of a social evening is to call tech support, you might 
want to consider celebrating at least part of the holiday season online. 
Beyond shopping, the Net has: _ Advent calendars. These countdowns 
to Christmas, with the little windows that children used to open to 
get candy or see a picture, are all over the Web. Choose from animated, 
musical, Episcopal or German-American Advent calendars (www.yahoo.com/societyandculture/holidays/christmas/adventcalendars/ 
) or one that has a different cookie recipe for each day before Christmas 
(www.cookierecipe.com/cat/christmas.asp). _ Holiday cards. The folks, 
or actually the software at americangreetings.com/index.pd, will send 
e-mail greetings and arrange for cards to be delivered via snail mail 
to friends who don't have modems, the sort who waste good online time 
outside singing Christmas carols. _ An online menorah. You can find 
out how many lights to light each day of Hanukkah at torah.org/chanukah.html. 
(Add one if you view the site from Australia.) The site also offers 
this advice: ``Note! Rabbinic authorities agree: You can't fulfill 
the Mitzvah by looking at a computer screen!'' _ Letters to Santa. 
Kids can write to Santa at emailsanta.com. For parents worried about 
their children's writing to strangers online, the site doesn't require 
much personal information, just a first name, age, city and state, 
so Santa can reply (an e-mail address is optional). _ Carols. At rememberjosie.org/xmas/toc.html, 
there are lyrics and tunes for 77 old favorites. _ Live cameras. You 
can see the Christmas market in Nuremburg, Germany, at www.christkindlesmarkt.de/live/elivecam1.html, 
or check out Rockefeller Center, at www.ftna.com/ cents.cgi. _ Kwanzaa 
events. The calendar at the Kwanzaa Information Center (new.melanet.com/apps/calendar/calendar.cgi) 
includes Kwanzaa-related events across the country. _ Script. Need 
to stage a Christmas pageant? Download the script at ccvp.com/hatfield/CAPNSLA.TXT. 
_ For Web treasure-hunters, there is a contest on at excape.excite.com/howto.html 
to piece together clues to figure out where on earth Excite's correspondent 
Mike Cerre is during his search for the origins of holiday traditions. 
The top prize: a trip around the world for two. _ Twelve Days of Commerce. 
At www.pncbank.com/12days/cardindex.html, you can learn the cost of 
the gifts My True Love Gave to Me. ``In a significant triumph in the 
age-old wage dispute among the sexes, the song's nine ladies dancing 
received a wage increase to $3,932.72 or 20.69 percent, this year, 
moving their salaries ahead of the carol's men, the 10 lords-a-leaping, 
11 pipers piping and 12 drummers drumming (based on the assumption 
that during medieval times, when the song was written, pipers and 
drummers were male).''
