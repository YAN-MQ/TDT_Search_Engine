Prime Minister Radu Vasile is asking the country's main trade unions 
for support while he carries out tough economic reforms, a government 
spokeswoman said Wednesday. Vasile met the leaders of several trade 
unions late Tuesday and will meet others Wednesday, asking them to 
hold off on organizing street protests for six months while reforms 
are implemented, said Elena Marinescu, spokeswoman for the Ministry 
of Industry and Trade. Reactions to the request were mixed. ``If the 
government really wants to make reforms, we are ready to support them,'' 
Marin Condescu, leader of the Miners Unions Confederation, said by 
telephone. ``But I have the feeling that these are only gift-wrapped 
promises.'' In recent weeks, tens of thousands of workers have taken 
to the streets to vent their anger with the government. Workers and 
union leaders say the government lacks a workable strategy to privatize 
state-owned firms. They also claim high taxes are causing widespread 
poverty. Condescu, who represents more than 90,000 miners, said government 
policies had prevented several state companies from paying salaries 
for several months. Some companies have not paid their electricity 
bills, making it impossible for electricity company, Conel, to pay 
mines that supply coal. The mines, in turn, have not paid their workers. 
Vasile recently said the government intends to close several state-owned 
enterprises by Dec. 20, cutting losses to the Romanian economy by 
15 percent. He did not specify which firms could be closed, but the 
Ministry of Industry and Trade recently published a list of the top 
money losers, including the refinery Petromidia Navodari and soda 
maker Solventul Timisoara. Other state companies are expected to be 
closed in the first half of 1999. Tens of thousands of jobs could 
be axed. The premier told union officials only companies that were 
unable to pay their debts for several months would be closed. The 
government said it is owed dlrs 870 million by loss-making companies. 
``It is not a time for tepid solutions. ... We have to act,'' Marinescu 
quoted Industry and Trade Minister Radu Berceanu as saying. On Wednesday, 
some 9,000 angry steel workers in the eastern city of Galati protested 
because they hadn't been paid for three months. ``It's rather hard 
to convince (people) to stay indoors when their children are crying 
from hunger,'' Condescu said. The average monthly salary is 1.2 million 
lei (dlrs 120). The government's proposal comes at a difficult moment. 
Hard currency reserves dropped below dlrs 2 billion for the first 
time this year. Economic analysts have warned that Romania will be 
unable to pay its foreign debts of dlrs 2.2 billion next year.
