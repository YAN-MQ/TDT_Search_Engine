``The Whole World Was Watching'' is yet another 30th-anniversary rundown 
of the tumultuous year of 1968, this one with an inspirational spin. 
The familiar history _ of anti-Vietnam War demonstrations, the Democratic 
political convention, the murders of the Rev. Dr. Martin Luther King 
Jr. and Robert F. Kennedy and other events that shook the nation _ 
has been handled more searchingly on other recent programs. Thursday 
night is human-interest time, with Connie Chung and Diane Sawyer applying 
the soft soap and squeezing out the tears and cheers. They bring us 
an Army squad leader named Tom Corey who was severely wounded in the 
Tet offensive and has become a leader in the campaign for rights of 
the disabled; a peek into the diary of Lady Bird Johnson written as 
her husband's time in the White House was running out, and a view 
by Hubert Humphrey's son Skip of his father's failed run for the presidency. 
The happy news is that some of the anti-war radicals of the time, 
blessedly forgotten now, are busying themselves with worthy causes: 
David Mixner has moved through alcohol, drugs and breakdowns to become 
``something of a hero'' in the movement for homosexual rights. Former 
Weathermen Bill Ayers and Bernardine Dohrn say they are working to 
help children. The two-hour compilation, produced by Paul and Holly 
Fine, ends on a poignant note with Lloyd Bucher, the naval commander 
who surrendered his intelligence ship, the Pueblo, to North Korea 
and was forced under the threat of having his crew tortured to announce, 
``We are criminals who committed hostile acts.'' In the upbeat spirit 
of ``The World Was Watching,'' this episode ends with Bucher and his 
crew members cheering one another. For reasons that I cannot explain, 
the program, which has its moving moments, ends with the Apollo 8 
mission. Ms. Sawyer or her script reports: ``The darkness of 1968 
was receding at last. The courage of Apollo turned us toward light, 
the promise of a more merciful future.'' Like much of the rest of 
this where-are-they-now exercise, it doesn't tell much about either 
past or future, but maybe some will find it heartening. PRODUCTION
