The spiritual leader of the Islamic militant group Hamas joined hundreds 
of Palestinian prisoners in a hunger strike Wednesday for their release. 
The elderly wheel-chair bound Sheik Ahmed Yassin was put under house 
arrest by Palestinian police in October. Hamas spokesman Ismael Hania 
said Yassin would refuse food in solidarity with Palestinians prisoners 
striking in Israeli jails since last week. Hania visited Yassin in 
his Gaza home Tuesday. Palestinians have held wide-spread demonstrations 
and strikes throughout the West Bank to protest Israel's refusal to 
release so-called security prisoners, those jailed for militant or 
political acts against the Jewish state. Israel has said that as part 
of the latest Mideast peace accord, it is only bound to release 750 
prisoners and will not release those with ``blood on their hands.''
