As the millennium approaches, a pop-inflected, genre-bending, dramatically 
singular masterpiece of the 20th century is finally edging into the 
standard operatic repertory. Is it Poulenc's ``Dialogues of the Carmelites''? 
Shostakovich's ``Lady Macbeth of the Mtsensk District''? It could 
be either, but the opus in question is Gershwin's ``Porgy and Bess,'' 
which shares with those mighty works enough visceral dramatic sweep 
and power, musical invention and craft, vocally and theatrically meaty 
characters, and mythical resonance to match any of Verdi's middle-period 
operas. Beginning on Thursday, the New York Philharmonic offers concert 
performances of ``Porgy and Bess'' at Avery Fisher Hall, culminating 
a weeklong Gershwin centenary celebration and offering a fresh chance 
to reflect on the piece's long journey toward high-art status. Since 
the checkered performance history of ``Porgy and Bess'' runs parallel 
to the civil rights movement, it may provide a telling diagnostic 
on the covert racial politics of the classical-music world. Bobby 
McFerrin, who will conduct at the Philharmonic, would seem to have 
just the right credentials to approach this hybrid work. A wide-ranging 
jazz vocalist, composer and arranger, noted for his collaborations 
with classical artists like the cellist Yo-Yo Ma, McFerrin has in 
recent years focused his musical efforts on symphony conducting. His 
interest in ``Porgy and Bess'' is longstanding and, you might say, 
in his blood. His father, Robert McFerrin, a baritone, provided the 
singing voice for Sidney Poitier's Porgy on the soundtrack of the 
1959 film version of Gershwin's opera, and his mother sang in the 
chorus for the film. ``This music has been in my body for 40 years, 
probably longer than any other music,'' McFerrin said recently from 
his home in Minnesota, where he has held the creative chair of the 
St. Paul Chamber Orchestra since 1994. Over the last two years, he 
has led a handpicked ensemble of singers in concert performances of 
``Porgy and Bess'' in Philadelphia, Chicago, Washington and St. Paul. 
``In large part, I wanted to do this to honor my father and my musical 
childhood,'' he added. The elder McFerrin was the first black singer 
to sign a Metropolitan Opera contract. He made his debut, as Amonasro 
in Verdi's ``Aida,'' in January 1955, just weeks after the better-publicized 
debut of the contralto Marian Anderson. But McFerrin never achieved 
Anderson's fame in the mainstream. He had previously sung with the 
Teatro San Carlo in Naples and the National Negro Opera Company, and 
had appeared in William Grant Still's ``Troubled Island'' at New York 
City Opera and in the Broadway run of ``Lost in the Stars.'' But the 
bulk of his career was devoted to university teaching posts, recital 
tours and a busy private voice studio in the Los Angeles area. He 
now lives in retirement in St. Louis. Robert McFerrin's career trajectory 
recalls that of two other illustrious Porgys, Todd Duncan and William 
Warfield. Duncan, discovered while singing in a black opera company 
in New York, was plucked from a teaching position at Howard University 
to create the role of Porgy in the work's 1935 premiere, at the Alvin 
Theater in New York. In 1945, he became the first black artist to 
sing at New York City Opera, and he later appeared on Broadway in 
``Cabin in the Sky'' and ``Lost in the Stars.'' Warfield, who starred 
in a 1953 Broadway revival and tour of ``Porgy,'' which effectively 
launched the career of Leontyne Price, also appeared on Broadway in 
``Regina'' and ``Showboat.'' But both men remain engraved in popular 
memory as Porgy. Ms. Price's career, of course, took a different turn. 
Her 1953 Bess was prelude to a string of high-profile opera debuts 
in San Francisco and Vienna, and at Covent Garden, La Scala and the 
Met. Far from being typecast as Bess, she became an international 
operatic superstar. More than that, she was the model for a line of 
exotic, glamorous, slightly enigmatic and highly fashionable black 
divas, including Grace Bumbry, Shirley Verrett, Kathleen Battle, Barbara 
Hendricks, Jessye Norman, Denyce Graves and Marvis Martin, who will 
sing Bess with the Philharmonic. The only black male opera singer 
to approach such celebrity even remotely is Simon Estes, who sang 
Porgy in the belated Met premiere of Gershwin's opera in 1985. Yet 
this patrician bass-baritone, trained at the Juilliard School, had 
already carved a niche for himself in Verdi and Wagner in Europe and 
at the Met long before he boarded the crippled Porgy's goat cart. 
Kevin Deas, who will sing Porgy with the Philharmonic, as he has elsewhere 
with McFerrin, could conceivably inherit Estes' mantle. His robust, 
cocoa bass-baritone voice and musicianly presence have made him a 
busy and respected concert artist with a diverse resume that encompasses 
Dave Brubeck and Anthony Davis as well as Handel, Monteverdi, Rameau, 
Shostakovich, Varese, Verdi and Wagner. Yet his only standard opera 
role to date is Leporello in Mozart's ``Don Giovanni,'' last season 
at the Eugene Opera, in Oregon. The versatile Deas is not without 
ambivalence at his first major break. ``My natural inclination is 
to say: ``Why Porgy? Why do I have to do my rite of passage on my 
knees, so to speak?' '' he said one recent afternoon in Central Park. 
``For years, I dreaded the prospect of being typed into something 
like Porgy, or being expected to end a recital with `Old Man River.' 
There was this perception that I was a black singer first. Well, when 
I was at Juilliard, it never occurred to me that I was majoring in 
black singing. There was this entire world of music, and I wanted 
to explore every aspect of it.'' But Deas had a defining experience 
early in his career, while touring with a vocal quartet and performing 
in a small town in Southeast Missouri. ``I was singing to this white 
Bess, `You is my woman,' '' he said, ``and you could see that the 
audience was physically uncomfortable, moving and twitching the whole 
time. I'll never forget it. I also remember being struck the first 
time I saw Simon Estes at the Met, in a romantic role and caressing 
a white female onstage. I didn't want to react to that, because it 
is not an issue for me personally, but I couldn't help but be struck 
by it.'' ``Porgy and Bess'' has sometimes seemed a mixed blessing 
to black artists. It has long served as a foot in a door, but now 
that the opera world is more open to blacks, what door might that 
be? Solicitous voice teachers often counsel black students to avoid 
``Porgy and Bess,'' at least until their operatic careers are already 
established. The opera has also caused controversy among critics and 
audiences, particularly among blacks. Although its catchy tunes have 
attained folk status, its nature and value have been much debated. 
Gershwin's oxymoronic designation of the work as a folk opera is itself 
a bone of contention. It has often been assailed as an outsider's 
inauthentic re-creation of black music, notably by Virgil Thomson, 
who branded it ``an unsavory mixing-up-together of Africa, Israel 
and the Gaelic Isles.'' (Thomson later recanted this position.) ``The 
main issue with blacks is, how can a white person write the black 
experience?'' McFerrin said. ``Well, they can't. It's as simple as 
that. But Gershwin spent a lot of time in Charleston at churches, 
homes and nightclubs, listening and getting the rhythms in his body. 
He was humble enough to let the music in and be a conduit for it in 
the best way he could. So it's not anthropology. But the bottom line 
is, he captured something in a special way. Was `Carmen' written by 
a Gypsy? Was `Don Giovanni' written by a Spaniard? No. But do these 
operas capture something about the human condition? Do they have gorgeous 
music? You bet.'' Perceived racial stereotypes involving violence, 
drugs, gambling and naive hedonism have compounded the work's difficulties. 
``These characters are of a certain time and place,'' Deas said. ``And 
I think Gershwin loved them and wrote music for them of tremendous 
nobility, strength and depth. If I felt there was any condescension, 
I wouldn't be singing it.'' Gershwin's pedigree as a Tin Pan Alley 
tunesmith steeped in ragtime and blues made him an unlikely candidate 
for opera. Yet in ``Porgy and Bess,'' he draped his jazzy materials 
over an orthodox operatic matrix of arias, recitatives and leitmotifs, 
informed by years of symphonic composition and study of Stravinsky, 
Scriabin, Bach and Chopin. And he was unambiguous about his lofty 
ambitions. ``If I am successful, it will resemble a combination of 
the drama and romance of `Carmen' and the beauty of `Meistersinger,' 
'' he wrote in 1934. Yet Gershwin helped seal the fate of ``Porgy 
and Bess'' in 1935 by assigning the premiere to the Theater Guild, 
despite the Met's interest in the work. Although the run lasted 124 
performances rather than the two offered by the Met, his choice of 
the commercial theater meant inevitable compromises. Gershwin's innovative 
orchestration was watered down to fit a Broadway pit. Massive cuts 
were inflicted to relieve the strain of an eight-performance workweek. 
In a 1941 Broadway revival, the producer Cheryl Crawford further diluted 
the score by replacing Gershwin's masterly recitative with spoken 
dialogue. All these adulterations contributed to the perception of 
``Porgy'' as a quaint musical sprinkled with hit tunes, and cheated 
audiences of its full impact. The critical tide began to turn after 
the Houston Grand Opera presented the first performances of ``Porgy 
and Bess'' in its full-length operatic version in 1976, complete with 
a tour and a recording. In its restored original form, it began to 
enter the repertory of major opera houses, including the Met and Glyndebourne. 
McFerrin, for his part, is trying his best to preserve the score's 
jazziness. As he travels with his troupe of singers, he finds himself 
in front of largely white orchestras. ``I'm constantly trying to get 
the musicians to play around the bar lines, to stretch and bend,'' 
he said. ``We need to let this music show its humidity.''
