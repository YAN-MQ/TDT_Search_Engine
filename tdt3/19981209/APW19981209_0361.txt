Nearly 200 U.N. arms inspectors searched for banned weapons in Iraq 
Wednesday as Iraqi newspapers renewed complaints that the inspections 
were not leading to a lifting of U.N. sanctions. Caroline Cross, spokeswoman 
for the U.N. Special Commission in charge of the arms inspections, 
said all the U.N. arms experts in the country were working Wednesday. 
When asked if they would be carrying out surprise visits, which have 
angered Iraq before, she said only the ``inspectors will carry on 
a full range of activities in Iraq.'' Chief U.N. weapons inspector 
Richard Butler had said earlier in New York that a series of surprise 
visits would begin Tuesday. Past visits have included such sensitive 
sites as offices of Iraq's ruling Baath Party. On Tuesday, nine arms 
monitoring groups, two biological warfare teams and a missile unit 
conducted 32 searches, some using helicopters, the Iraqi News Agency 
said. But UNSCOM spokeswoman Cross that the inspectors' latest work 
_ which would wrap up on Monday _ was no different than past inspections. 
``There is nothing much particularly new or innovative about the work 
they are doing now,'' she said later outside U.N. headquarters in 
Baghdad.
