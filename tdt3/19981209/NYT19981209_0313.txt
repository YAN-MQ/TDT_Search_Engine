From where did all this fury come? Could it simply be that two of 
the most celebrated literary icons of our time, Norman Mailer and 
John Updike, are jealous of Tom Wolfe? In their reviews, both authors 
struggled mightily and not with tender heart to establish that Wolfe's 
new best-selling novel, ``A Man in Full,'' was guaranteed not to be 
literature. Entertainment, sometimes. Journalism, probably. Art, certainly 
not. Which made many in book publishing ask who made Mailer and Updike, 
granting their years of fruitful toil, the adjudicators of what constitutes 
a literary work. Usually there is some ebullience in literary feuds, 
in observing authors flaying each other with gusto, but this one seems 
pretty dour, with a certain weediness about it, and the only one enjoying 
himself appears to be Wolfe, who is counting up the sales. Mailer 
and Updike apparently feel that they have been pushed to defend some 
novelist autarchy. ``I think you have to take Mailer and Updike as 
a matched set, and ask why are those old bones rising up to try and 
shoot down this book,'' Wolfe said in an interview. ``It's because 
their own works of the past few years have been sinking without a 
bubble.'' Now this is Wolfe's line, that there's envy in the land. 
Well, there's no need to recall the many successes of Mailer and Updike 
over the years, and there are others, besides the two writers, who 
don't think ``A Man in Full'' is good. The reviews have ranged from 
laudatory to mixed to terrible. Still, the bickering among the three 
has a yesteryear. In 1965, Wolfe attacked The New Yorker and particularly 
mocked Updike, a mainstay of that magazine; in 1973 he wrote that 
novelists who didn't go out and report were, well, washed up. And 
in an essay in Harper's magazine in 1989, subtitled ``A literary manifesto 
for the new social novel,'' he reiterated that theme, writing that 
``reporting is the most valuable and least understood resource available 
to any writer with exalted ambitions.'' In short, he wrote, great 
moments in literature often would have been ``impossible without that 
peculiar drudgery that Zola called documentation.'' Or reporting, 
to use a less prissy word. So when ``A Man in Full'' (Farrar, Straus 
&AMP; Giroux) was published in October, some of the literati were 
ready. After all, Wolfe has yet to be voted into the American Academy 
of Arts and Letters and therefore has not officially become an immortal 
despite his many contributions to the American idiom. Updike, reviewing 
``A Man in Full'' for The New Yorker, wrote that though touched with 
``its grand ambition,'' the novel ``still amounts to entertainment, 
not literature, even literature in a modest aspirant form.'' Mailer, 
in a review in The New York Review of Books so lengthy that one thought 
that perhaps, like Dickens, he was being paid by the word, there was 
his usual spikiness, but also at times a tutorial tone. He cautioned 
Wolfe not to be drugged by plot, admonished him that he needed to 
learn, if he could, to create interesting female characters, and added 
that he had to master the skill of making characters grow through 
the events of the story, flowing and rounding out to maturity. But 
all this seemed to be a cover for what perhaps most got under Mailer's 
skin, that Wolfe had written another best-selling novel after his 
``Bonfire of the Vanities'' more than a decade ago. Mailer wrote: 
``It is Tom Wolfe's best book by far, it begins to promise that he 
is ready to become a great American novelist, and then it loses its 
air and settles (with all the canniness of a hard-nosed business judgment) 
for being a mega-best seller.'' It follows, then, Mailer goes on, 
that ``at the highest level, it's a failure _ at a more modest plateau 
(which is to say, at the corrupt level), it is bound to prove a resounding 
success with its large popular merits.'' Worse even than that, and 
advanced by Mailer as a reason for the book's literary failure, is 
that Wolfe is, uh-oh, a journalist. He had been a good young reporter 
who was promoted to feature writer, which meant, Mailer wrote, that 
he didn't ``form those novelistic habits that are learned best when 
you are young.'' Forget Defoe (considered in his time by many to be 
but a grub street journalist), Thackeray, Balzac, Dickens, Dostoyevsky, 
Dreiser, Mailer himself. To say nothing of Matthew, Mark, Luke and 
John, who provided the research for Mailer's ``The Gospel According 
to the Son'' (Random House, 1997). All did considerable reporting 
at the behest of their literary calling. Wolfe pointed out that Sinclair 
Lewis actually got in the pulpit and preached before he felt ready 
to write ``Elmer Gantry.'' So the gospel according to Wolfe is the 
issue of what he calls ``gullet'' writing versus exploration. ``It's 
time for writers to realize that valid material is not consigned to 
what's in your gullet,'' he said, adding that ``Emerson believed everyone 
had one great autobiography to tell, but Emerson didn't say everyone 
had two. You have to come up with things that unaided imagination 
doesn't.'' ``Age is gnawing'' at Mailer and Updike, he continued, 
and his own kind of novel is the future, and perhaps they are afraid 
of the future. In fact, Wolfe's future novel is prologue, considering 
the past practitioners of the art; he really is calling for a return 
to the kind of social novels that went before. And in some ways his 
criticism of Mailer, at any rate, is about as fair as some of Mailer's 
criticism is about ``A Man in Full.'' Mailer does get about. Perhaps 
what the whole debate is about is labeling. Is it literature, entertainment, 
art or pop culture? Graham Greene called his less serious novels ``entertainments.'' 
If he didn't, others no doubt would have called them literature. What 
perhaps can only be truly said now about ``A Man in Full'' is that 
it's the one novel that people are clamoring to read. What will be 
considered literature or entertainment 100 years from now no one can 
know. When Dreiser's ``Sister Carrie'' was reissued 71 years ago (it 
received no recognition when it was first published in 1900) The New 
York Times' review concluded with this line: ``It is a book one can 
very well get along without reading.'' As for Wolfe, watch out. His 
next novel is going to be about education, he says; furthermore, he's 
going to do it in three years and he's going to do a lot of reporting 
for it. It's a proud tradition, the reporter-novelist. Even Louisa 
May Alcott, it seems, got out of the house and into the street for 
research.
