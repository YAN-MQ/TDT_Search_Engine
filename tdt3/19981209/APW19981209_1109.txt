Home Secretary Jack Straw ruled Wednesday that Spain can start extradition 
proceedings against former Chilean dictator Gen. Augusto Pinochet 
to face charges of genocide, torture and kidnapping. In a statement, 
Straw said the 83-year-old general appeared fit to stand trial and 
rejected complaints that a judge who ruled against Pinochet was biased 
because he heads the fund-raising arm of the human rights organization 
Amnesty International. ``The Spanish request for his extradition will 
now be considered by the courts,'' the statement said. The decision 
means that Pinochet, under armed guard at a mansion outside London, 
now faces months and possibly years of battles through British courts 
fighting extradition. His lawyers have said they may seek an urgent 
review before a judge, arguing that Straw would be wrong on legal 
points to let Spain have the general. Human rights organizations were 
esctatic, while Pinochet's right-wingers supporters expressed outrage 
at this latest blow. Former Conservative prime minister Margaret Thatcher 
said Britain's Labor Party government had made a ``grave mistake.'' 
``He had ample power to put an end to this shameful and damaging episode,'' 
she said of Straw. ``He has chosen, instead, to prolong it ... This 
was a political decision and it represents a failure of political 
leadership.'' Carlos Reyas, leader of a Chilean exile group, was almost 
speechless with delight, describing Straw's decision as a ``wonderful 
omen.'' Straw had agonized over the decision since Britain's highest 
court, the House of Lords, said in a 3-2 ruling Nov. 25 that Pinochet 
has no immunity from arrest under English law. He made his announcement 
two days before Friday's deadline. Pinochet, a regular visitor to 
Britain, was arrested Oct. 16 on a Spanish warrant. A Chilean government 
report says 3,197 people were murdered or disappeared at the hands 
of the secret police during his 17-year rule. He overthrew an elected 
Marxist, Salvador Allende, in a 1973 coup. ``We congratulate the Home 
Secretary on this difficult but courageous decision which brings us 
one step closer to the day when Pinochet will have to answer to his 
victims,'' said Reed Brody, spokesman for the New York-based Human 
Rights Watch. Amnesty International, which earlier Wednesday failed 
to get a High Court injunction to stop Pinochet fleeing if Straw had 
ruled in his favor, said it was ``absolutely delighted.'' But the 
decision dealt a new blow to Britain's already strained relations 
with Chile, which has waged a diplomatic battle for the general's 
release partly because of fears that renewed tensions between his 
supporters and opponents will threaten the country's new democracy. 
Chilean President Eduardo Frei, who heard the news of a visit to Brazil, 
made no immediate comment. The decision opened the prospect of a long 
legal fight by an old man living _ and possibly dying _ under arrest 
in a foreign country. Pinochet remained at a mansion at Wentworth, 
some 20 miles (30 kms) west of London. He was moved there Dec. 1 after 
the north London hospital where he spent more than a month said he 
did not need medical attention. Three judges in the House of Lords 
ruled that some crimes are heinous beyond immunity. The one who tipped 
the decision against Pinochet, South African-born Lord Justice Leonard 
Hoffmann, is the director of the fund-raising arm of Amnesty International.
