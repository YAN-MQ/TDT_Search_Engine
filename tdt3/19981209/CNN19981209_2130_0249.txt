The FAA has ordered an inspection of the door wiring on MD-11 aircraft. 
The FAA says the front passenger doors may open in such a way that 
frays electrical wires, which could lead to a fire in the passenger 
cabin. The order applies to 65 U.S.-registered MD-11s. The doors must 
be checked within ten days and any problems must be repaired before 
further flight. The FAA says there's no evidence the problem might 
have caused the crash of swissair flight 111 in September which also 
was an MD-11.
