President Eduardo Frey of Chile has urged Chileans to remain calm. 
His call comes in the wake of Britain's decision to subject General 
Pinochet to extradition proceedings. The BBC's James Reynolds reports 
on the reaction in the Chilean capital. The Chilean government said 
it would appeal for the British home secretary's decision to be overturned. 
The Chilean ambassador to Britain, Mario Aftasa, is now on his way 
to Santiago after being recalled for consultation by the government. 
But Foreign Minister Jose Niellin Sulsa has been quick to say that 
diplomatic relations between Chile and Britain are not at risk. The 
Chilean army says Jack Straw's decision is abusive and humiliating. 
But opponents of General Pinochet say the ruling means that justice 
may finally be done. James Reynolds, BBC NEWS, Santiago.
