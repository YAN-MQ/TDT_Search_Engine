During the long months of my first pregnancy, I exhibited the usual 
range of tender maternal feelings. As I lay awake at night, I hoped 
that my daughter would be born healthy, with my husband's hair and 
with a strong aversion to dating boys who rode motorcycles. But when 
I went into labor, I forgot such trivial concerns. Between contractions, 
I was seized by a single thought: I needed to find my hardcover copy 
of ``Emma,'' by Jane Austen. If my husband's recollections of the 
events are to be believed (and since I have repressed most memories 
of labor, his is the only firsthand account to survive), I refused 
to go to the hospital without the book, which I had purchased on a 
whim and then promptly forgot. ``No, no, the one with the red spine 
is my lucky copy!'' I shrieked, according to my husband, when he tried 
to placate me with a paperback version. We found the book on an unlikely 
shelf in the living room, when the contractions were barely 90 seconds 
apart. You might think that the next time, I would plan ahead and 
pack ``Emma'' during a less action-packed trimester. But no. An essential 
component of the highly emotional connection I have to certain security 
objects is this: the feeling sneaks up on me. That brings me to my 
old laptop, an Apple Powerbook 160. When I bought it in 1992, the 
computer was just another tool. Lately, it has become a nearly forgotten 
middle child in a clamorous household of faster, newer siblings. Demoted 
from the days of glory when I wrote my first nonfiction book with 
it, the outdated machine now travels with my 9-year-old daughter on 
her daily backyard reconnaissance so she can type Harriet-the-Spy-like 
observations about the neighbors (``7:55: Mrs. O. drives by in GREEN 
VAN _ taking K. to school???''). On the day after Thanksgiving, my 
daughter carried the laptop into the house, its screen dark, its power 
cord limp and its motor silent. She said it refused to boot. Fiddling 
confirmed the symptoms, but I couldn't make a diagnosis. The problem 
could be almost anything _ as simple as a dead battery or as fatal 
as a frazzled hard drive. I did a quick calculation. Let's see: the 
warranty has long ago expired, the hourly rates the local Apple dealership 
charges for service are astronomical, and the Powerbook (which cost 
$3,000 in 1992) is worth about 10 cents. The practical solution would 
have been to put the Powerbook in the graveyard in my office until 
my husband offered a second opinion. But then, the practical thing 
to do during labor is to go to the hospital without making a fuss 
about a dusty book that previously meant nothing to you. ``Get your 
coat,'' I said to Zoe. ``We're going to B.C. Communications, aren't 
we?'' she asked warily. B.C. Communications is the quirky Apple dealership 
I patronize for reasons I find hard to articulate. Am I attracted 
by the prestige (the owner, Bill Cranz, boasts that his Long Island 
shop is the oldest independent Apple dealership east of the Mississippi)? 
Or the broad range of merchandise, including surveillance equipment 
and accouterments for gun lovers? Or is it Cranz himself, who doubles 
as the proprieter of Depot Firearms and who could have just as easily 
doubled for Marlon Brando in ``The Godfather'' if the part called 
for a gray ponytail, a khaki-colored safari suit and a haze of smoke 
from a pipe? ``You're in trouble,'' Cranz said by way of greetings, 
eyeing my relic. ``The last time, it was just a battery,'' I said 
defensively, gently placing the Powerbook on the service counter. 
``That was in 1995, invoice 950328, $13.02,'' he barked as a technician 
prodded at my machine. ``Back then, you were covered under an Apple 
Care service policy.'' A technician popped in a new battery. Nothing 
happened. ``Maybe it's the power cord?'' I asked hopefully, as my 
daughter wandered off to play with a new Apple iMac on display. Next, 
a voltmeter was produced _ and, in fact, registered no response from 
the power adapter. As a test, Cranz plugged a new power cord into 
the computer. ``Problem solved,'' he said, as the screen brightened. 
``How much?'' I asked. ``That's $162.70, including tax.'' ``For a 
cord?'' Just then, my daughter reappeared at the counter. ``How much 
is that green computer?'' she said, gesturing toward the iMac. ``Twelve 
ninety-nine.'' Her eyes lit up. ``Twelve dollars and ninety-nine cents?'' 
``You are your mother's daughter,'' Cranz said, puffing on his pipe. 
``Listen, little girl, I only make $65 profit on each one I sell.'' 
Then he said to me, ``You want the cord?'' As I looked down at my 
computer, I saw a potential money pit _ an ailing reminder of the 
earliest generation of Apple's Powerbook line. And yet. On screen 
were icons for the first e-mail program I ever configured and for 
Glider, the first computer game to which I became addicted. And this 
was my first Apple: the machine that made me realize that the phrase 
``new technology'' wasn't always a synonym for ``alien menace.'' Suddenly, 
in my mind I saw all my other heirlooms, the talismans that I arrange 
superstitiously throughout my house to keep me safe from vague, unknown 
dangers: the tablecloth my grandmother cross-stitched, the big-eyed 
photo of my mother when she was 3, the set of six colored shot glasses 
that I inherited after the death of the last relative who drank ritual 
Manischewitz each Christmas. ``I'll take it,'' I said. In the car 
my daughter examined invoice 954274, then asked how I was going to 
explain this rash expense to her more practical parent, her father. 
I said I would say that I had found another copy of ``Emma,'' one 
with a red spine. He would know better than to mess with me.
