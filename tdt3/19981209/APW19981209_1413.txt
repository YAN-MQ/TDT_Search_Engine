Chief U.N. weapons inspector Richard Butler accused Iraq on Wednesday 
of blocking a completely legitimate inspection after promising unhindered 
access and full cooperation. ``This was an absolutely legal no-notice 
inspection and they blocked us,'' he told The Associated Press. ``It 
was a blockage and it's wrong.'' Despite the Iraqi interference, Butler 
plans to continue the surprise searches, which began Tuesday and are 
expected to conclude late this week or early next week, said U.N. 
spokesman Fred Eckhard. Butler said Monday he wanted to complete a 
series of tests of Iraq's compliance before reporting to U.N. Secretary-General 
Kofi Annan on whether Baghdad has kept its promise of full cooperation 
with inspectors in the search for banned weapons. ``He has told us 
that he will not make an assessment of overall Iraqi compliance on 
the basis of a single incident, and he expects to give his final report 
on that assessment early next week,'' Eckhard said. State-run Iraqi 
radio disclosed the incident, saying a U.N. weapons team tried to 
get into an office of President Saddam Hussein's ruling Baath party 
Tuesday ``in a provocative manner ... without previous announcement.'' 
The party official in charge demanded that the head of the U.N. team 
give him a written declaration ``on the banned items'' the team was 
seeking, according to the broadcast, which quoted the official Iraqi 
News Agency. ``The team rejected this and withdrew,'' it said. Iraq's 
Deputy U.N. Ambassador Saeed Hasan said the building was the headquarters 
of the Baghdad branch of the Baath party, which he called ``a sensitive 
site.'' The Iraqis in the past have tried to block or thwart some 
unannounced inspections, calling them provocative and an infringement 
of sovereignty. The U.N. Special Commission, known as UNSCOM, which 
Butler heads, and the International Atomic Energy Agency must certify 
that Baghdad has eliminated banned weapons before the Security Council 
can lift sweeping economic sanctions imposed in 1990 after Iraq invaded 
Kuwait. Butler said Iraq's demand for ``notice from us in writing 
of what we were looking for ... is simply wrong.'' ``Three weeks ago 
they solemnly promised the Security Council that they would cooperate. 
And now this new requirement that we tell them in advance in writing 
what we're looking for _ this is nonsense,'' he said. ``We have done 
inspections like this before,'' said UNSCOM spokesman Ewen Buchanan. 
``You can't have a credible verification inspection regime if there 
are chunks off bounds.'' The Security Council met Wednesday morning 
but did not discuss Iraq. Eckhard said Butler had not been asked by 
the council to report on the incident. Butler did speak to Annan about 
the incident Wednesday morning. ``The secretary-general has no public 
reaction at this time,'' Eckhard said. Annan will report to the Security 
Council on Butler's findings on Iraqi compliance. The council must 
decide that Iraq is in full cooperation with inspectors before it 
will undertake a comprehensive review of Iraq's compliance with U.N. 
resolutions. Iraqi leaders see the review as the quickest route to 
easing or lifting economic sanctions but diplomats say it will merely 
establish a list of Baghdad's outstanding obligations _ and the United 
States insists there is no link to ending sanctions.
