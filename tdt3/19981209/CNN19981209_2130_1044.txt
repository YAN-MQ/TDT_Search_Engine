Some handy gadgets can make business travel easier. And they make 
great holiday gifts, too. Kalin Thomas-Samuel has a few ideas in our 
"working ahead" report. Busy business travelers may be wishing Santa 
would give them some time off, but at least they can get a gift to 
make travel easier. What's great about travel accessories is that 
they're not only great as gifts for people who travel frequently, 
but they're also great for holiday travel. So they can be a gift to 
yourself or a gift to others. Like the "bucky neck pillows" for use 
in the car or on the plane. They're made from natural buckwheat hulls 
and can even be microwaved to give your neck some extra comfort. These 
"ear planes" are designed to help alleviate the pain that can come 
with cabin pressure changes during takeoff and landing. There's a 
light attached to this "fog umbrella" to help you navigate when it's 
dark and rainy. This is touted as the smallest 35 millimeter camera. 
It's small enough that you can actually put it into your shirt pocket. 
But don't let the size fool you. It uses 35 millimeter film and takes 
panoramic pictures. Finally, there's the "travel companion plus" -- 
four products in one. It's a calendar, an alarm clock, and when you 
pull it apart, it becomes a Flashlight and a motion and smoke detector. 
This can actually Hang on the doorknob in your hotel room. Providing 
not only convenience, but peace of mind. Kalin Thomas-Samuel, CNN, 
Atlanta.
