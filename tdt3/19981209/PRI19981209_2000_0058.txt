From National Public Radio News in Washington, I'm Corey Flintov. 
The White House has completed its defense of the president before 
the House Judiciary Committee. NPR's Barbara Bradley has more. For 
nearly five hours, presidential counsel Charles Ruff argued that the 
president had not committed an impeachable offense. He said that independent 
counsel Kenneth Starr had given only the most incriminating evidence 
against the president, but he said looking at the record in its entirety 
shows a much more innocent picture. Even as Ruff testified, Republican 
committee members were drafting articles of impeachment, which will 
be considered later this week. There are four articles, one for perjury 
in the Paula Jones civil case, another perjury charge in his grand 
jury testimony, an obstruction of justice charge, and an abuse of 
power charge. Democrats came up with an alternative to impeachment. 
They drafted a resolution that would censure the president for making 
false statements and delaying the discovery of truth. It also noted 
that the president would be subject to criminal and civil penalties 
in the future. Barbara Bradley, correspondent, The World, the Capitol.
