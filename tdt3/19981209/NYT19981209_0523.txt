Facing four hours of sharp and occasionally argumentative questioning 
by Connecticut lawmakers Wednesday, Robert Kraft, owner of the New 
England Patriots, defended the terms of his tentative contract to 
move the team to a state-built stadium in Hartford, but asserted that 
the deal would be as good for the city as it would be for him. First 
in cramped caucus rooms and later on statewide television, legislators 
grilled Kraft on the costs and risks of the agreement, which would 
provide the football team with a $375 million stadium, rent-free, 
in return for a 30-year agreement to stay in Hartford. But Kraft insisted 
it wasn't a giveaway. ``This deal has been portrayed by some as a 
sweetheart deal, and I don't think that we've done a good job getting 
the message out on this deal,'' Kraft, 57, said. ``That just isn't 
true. I want to say this up-front: I'm at an age where if I make a 
commitment for the next 30 years, that takes me through my lifetime, 
I believe. I don't want to do a deal that isn't a good deal, both 
ways.'' Many lawmakers said they were not sure about that, however, 
and said they still did not have enough information to evaluate the 
decision. ``People keep saying it's a done deal, but every legislator 
I talk to has serious reservations about it,'' said state Rep. Nancy 
Beals, a Democrat from Hamden. Last week, Gov. John Rowland released 
a private study commissioned by the state that showed that the stadium 
would pay for itself over the 30-year span of the agreement. But on 
Wednesday the Legislature's nonpartisan Office of Fiscal Analysis 
issued a report concluding that the project would wind up costing 
taxpayers as much as $323 million. Kraft told lawmakers that the deal 
was fragile and discouraged them from contemplating any changes. But 
the House majority leader, Moira Lyons, said that after meeting with 
Kraft she still had concerns about the agreement. She said the governor's 
negotiators had agreed to take up the issues with Kraft's representatives. 
``I feel that in good faith, they're going to see what they can do,'' 
Ms. Lyons said. With such questions remaining, some legislators worried 
that they would have little time to review the measure before the 
vote, scheduled for next Tuesday. The governor, a Republican, has 
said he was willing to stake his legacy on the plan, and the leaders 
of the House and Senate, both controlled by Democrats, are energetically 
pushing it. The opposition, on the other hand, has been diffuse, and 
the lawmakers who are leery of the plan have mostly raised questions 
rather than organizing outright opposition. One group of opponents, 
the Connecticut Citizens Action Group, livened up the Legislative 
Office Building, where the hearing was held, by handing out cheese 
with stickers that said: ``Kraft Gets $1 Billion. Our Kids Get Surplus 
Cheese.'' In his opening remarks at the hearing, Rowland acknowledged 
that the opposition had become increasingly vocal, telling lawmakers, 
``You've heard from constituents that obviously are opposed to it, 
because they are the only people who call.'' He called the eight-hour 
hearing ``our opportunity to drive past the doldrums and the naysayers.'' 
He implored the Legislature to consider the alternative _ no new franchise 
_ and compare that to ``the long-term hit that we get with an NFL 
franchise.'' ``The Patriots and the Kraft family believe in us,'' 
the governor said. ``Now, it's time for us to believe in ourselves. 
No dream is worth having without some risk involved.'' Afterward, 
Kraft said he could not predict how his plan would fare. ``There were 
a lot of questions _ hard questions _ and that's good for us to hear,'' 
he said. The Senate president, Kevin Sullivan, described legislators 
as ``cautiously inclined _ skeptically inclined'' to seal the deal. 
Kraft said in his testimony that while the team is to pay no rent 
during the 30-year lease, the Patriots would would be paying operating 
expenses. He added that the 10 percent tax the Patriots will pay on 
ticket sales was a better deal for the state than rent, since the 
amount would grow as the stadium flourished. The provision that has 
drawn the most ire from lawmakers is a guarantee of as much as $17.5 
million a year that the state would pay if luxury suites and boxes 
went unsold. Although the governor and Kraft have maintained publicly 
that this is a nonnegotiable provision, aides to the governor have 
promised senior lawmakers that they will try to tinker with these 
guarantees to try to reduce the state's risk. In defending the guarantees, 
Kraft pointed to the risk he was taking. He asked lawmakers to imagine 
they owned the Patriots and had the choice of moving to Los Angeles 
or Houston, which lack NFL teams, or to Hartford. ``Let's analyze,'' 
he said, tossing out a few statistics about the wealth and size of 
the bigger cities. ``Hartford,'' he continued, ``is a city that has 
not had a great record in maintaining corporations here or attracting 
new corporations _ and I say this respectfully.'' ``We want to come 
to Hartford,'' he continued. ``That analysis was simply an academic 
one, to make you understand how we try to get an equivalent basis, 
on these guarantees.''
