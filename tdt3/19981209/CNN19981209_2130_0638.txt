If you have a child to shop for this holiday season, you may have 
noticed that stores are well stocked with scientific and technical 
toys. Ann Kellan looks at how these types of toys rate with kids, 
in this edition of "tech trends." Move over, furby. Make way for toys 
that make kids think, toys that teach everything from life sciences 
to geography, math and engineering. This is my second time I ever 
played with this before. Elementary school kids helped rate some of 
these science toys for "Consumer reports" magazine. We asked other 
kids to pick and then play with similar toys to get their expert opinions. 
We're doing great now, right? The big hits among the kids -- The capital 
of North Carolina -- I liked the globe. The $100 geosafari talking 
globe. Oh, it asks you a question, and you have to answer the right 
one. yep. What's your favorite toy? Oh, this. why? Because it can 
move all by itself. It can move all by itself? Yeah, this 'trols it. 
You have to build it, don't you? Yeah, we're building, we're building. 
Kids with a knack for building gave high ratings to a variety of construction 
kits, including robotix. This goes somewhere over here. Zoogs were 
a hit among the kids. A big hit with our testers was the hoberman 
sphere, kind of grows on you and appeals to all ages. "Consumer reports'" 
Diane weathers says kids' opinions about many of these toys were mixed. 
There were several toys that were really loved by, you know, certain 
kids, and other kids didn't like them. I mean, so, it really -- kids 
are different. According to weathers, children should shop for their 
own toys and pick ones that pique their interest. That way, learning 
becomes a game, a toy that's hard to put away. Ann Kellan, CNN, Atlanta.
