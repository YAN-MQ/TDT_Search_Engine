A federal judge in Austin has ordered stays of execution for two men 
scheduled to die by injection tonight and tomorrow. State prosecutors 
are appealing the stay for Danny Barbour, who was to be executed tonight 
for the murder of a woman in 1979. The judge also stopped the execution 
of a Canadian man whose case has sparked diplomatic protests. NPR's 
John Burnett reports. U.S. District Judge Sam Sparks has stayed the 
execution of Joseph Stanley Falder with a preliminary ruling that 
the practice by the Texas Board of Pardons and Parole of holding private 
proceedings is unconstitutional. Sparks ordered an evidentiary hearing 
for December 12 to determine whether Falder received due process before 
the pardons board. The state attorney general's office, however, is 
making an emergency appeal to the Fifth U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals 
in New Orleans to try and have the stay lifted so the execution can 
proceed. Falder, convicted of a 1975 murder and robbery, was scheduled 
to die tomorrow at 6 P.M. The pardons board members voted earlier 
today, 17 to 0, to deny Falder's request for clemency. The judge's 
surprise decision had nothing to do with the diplomatic outcry that 
Texas authorities had broken an international consular treaty in their 
handling of Falder. John Burnett, correspondent, The World, Austin.
