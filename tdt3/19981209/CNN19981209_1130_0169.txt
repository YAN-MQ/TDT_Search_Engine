Moderate republican congressman Amo Houghton of New York has publicly 
announced he will vote against impeachment if the matter reaches the 
house floor. In an op-Ed piece in "the New York Times" today, he calls 
for Congress to issue "A strong statement of rebuke." The move is 
welcomed by the democrats, who have been trying to mobilize moderate 
GOP members to vote against impeachment if the Judiciary committee 
recommends Mr. Clinton be impeached. Yesterday, republican New York 
senator Alfonse D'Amato came out against the impeachment probe. He 
says if it comes to a Senate trial it would be a "wrenching experience" 
for the country.
