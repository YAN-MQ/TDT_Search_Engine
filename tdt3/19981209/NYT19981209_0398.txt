Judges feel under attack these days, and there is ample evidence that 
they are: threats of impeachment over unpopular rulings, negative 
campaigns that mischaracterize the records of state judges who need 
voter approval to stay in office, and legislative struggles over budgets 
and salaries. Constrained by tradition, ethical rules and a lack of 
political leverage from doing much to defend themselves, judges have 
looked for allies, and they are beginning to find powerful ones. The 
American Bar Association has started a project intended to increase 
public understanding and support for judicial independence, a concept 
that ``recedes into the background like the wallpaper in your living 
room, but at times of conflict and stress leaps into the foreground,'' 
as Colin Diver, dean of the University of Pennsylvania Law School, 
told a group that met here the other day to begin the project. Two 
Supreme Court justices joined 120 other judges, bar leaders and legal 
scholars here for the first of three conferences to take place over 
the next five months. Thirty state court chief justices attended or 
sent other judges or representatives of their courts to this first 
meeting, co-sponsored by the University of Pennsylvania Law School. 
``If you believe in judicial independence, you believe in freedom,'' 
U.S. Supreme Court Justice Anthony Kennedy told the group. ``The bar 
must support the judiciary in its cause when it is under attack,'' 
he said, adding: ``Judges do not have political clout. They need the 
bar.'' Though not everyone at the invitation-only conference agreed 
on the dimensions of the problem, there was widespread agreement with 
a definition offered by Justice Adolpho A. Birch Jr., a member and 
former chief justice of the Tennessee Supreme Court: ``Judicial independence 
is the judge's right to do the right thing or, believing it to be 
the right thing, to do the wrong thing.'' The stars of the gathering 
were undoubtedly Kennedy and his Supreme Court colleague, Justice 
Stephen G. Breyer. Their decision to travel here both underscored 
and validated the concerns of the other judges, particularly those 
who ``are only an election cycle, at most, away from unemployment,'' 
as Judge Wendell L. Griffen of the Arkansas Court of Appeals described 
the vulnerability felt by state judges who must face the voters either 
for election or for retention in office. Most state judges are elected, 
and there was considerable discussion about the threats to the image 
of an independent judiciary posed by negative campaigns and by the 
judicial candidates' need to raise money. One judge who described 
her own experience was Kate Ford Elliott of the Pennsylvania Superior 
Court, who lost a race for the Pennsylvania Supreme Court last year 
after her opponent ran an advertisement in the last four days of the 
campaign accusing her of having ``let criminals loose on technicalities.'' 
Elliott remained on the Superior Court, an intermediate appellate 
court. ``I don't decide Microsoft versus Netscape,'' she said at a 
panel discussion of judicial elections. ``I decide whether Joe Smith 
gets to have his child for the weekend,'' and similar cases ``very 
important for people's lives.'' ``We're allowed to do that because 
people trust us,'' she continued, asking how a judge ``can ever maintain 
that covenant of trust'' after enduring a reputation-damaging political 
campaign. Justice Harold F. See of the Alabama Supreme Court held 
the group spellbound with a videotape of the attack advertisements 
that his opponent ran against him in a 1996 race. Over the image of 
a skunk nosing through the underbrush, the narration called See ``a 
slick Chicago lawyer'' who never passed the Alabama bar exam. In fact, 
he had taught for 20 years at the University of Alabama Law School 
and was admitted to the Alabama bar without having to take the exam. 
See spent $2.4 million and won the election. Because of such experiences, 
state judges rarely express much sympathy for federal judges, protected 
as they are by life tenure. Yet several scholars at the conference 
observed that life tenure, a very rare arrangement among the world's 
judicial systems, was itself a source of political vulnerability for 
judges who are easily portrayed as arrogant in their insularity and 
unaccountability. Indeed, if there was one incident that galvanized 
the current concern over judicial independence, it was the bipartisan 
attack, early in the 1996 election year, on a federal district judge 
in New York, Harold Baer Jr. In a decision questioning the credibility 
of New York City police offices, Baer had ruled that police lacked 
an adequate basis to pull over and search a car and that the 80 pounds 
of cocaine and heroin the officers found could not be used as evidence. 
After Republicans, including the party's eventual presidential nominee, 
Bob Dole, denounced Baer, who was a recent Clinton appointee, Clinton's 
spokesman suggested that the president might seek the judge's resignation. 
Within a few weeks, Baer reconsidered the case and reversed his own 
ruling. That episode, as well as subsequent calls by several Republicans 
in Congress for the impeachment of federal judges on the basis of 
their rulings, led a number of organizations, including the American 
Judicature Society and the Century Foundation, formerly the Twentieth 
Century Fund, to organize projects on judicial independence. The Century 
Foundation's bipartisan group, Citizens for Independent Courts, plans 
to issue a report in June on several related issues, including how 
to define the line between legitimate criticism and intimidation of 
judges. In brief remarks to the group here, Breyer stressed his view 
that judicial independence exists not for the benefit of judges, but 
of the people. ``Judicial independence is in part a state of mind,'' 
he said, ``a matter of expectation, habit and belief among not just 
judges, lawyers and legislators, but millions of people.'' But, he 
said, ``I don't think judges can help'' in their own cause because 
judges' views are easily dismissed as ``institutional self-interest.'' 
``It becomes up to others to do the explaining,'' Breyer told the 
bar leaders and law professors, adding, ``That's why you're here.''
