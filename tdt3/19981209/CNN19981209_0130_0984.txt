Many basketball fans have been disappointed by the lingering players' 
strike. Now, the NBA is apologizing for another cancellation. Tony 
Guida has the story. The NBA wrote another embarrassing chapter in 
its history tuesday, canceling its all-star game for the first time 
ever. Before the league locked out its players, a sports marketing 
firm had estimated the game would bring $35 million to Philadelphia's 
economy. But the lockout has been such a disaster, the mayor of Philadelphia 
said he basically didn't want the game anymore anyway. You can imagine 
the surliness of a game that would be played if we started the season 
the second week of January and had a game. It would be a sham of a 
game, and we wouldn't get the significant economic impact from it. 
We'd probably get less than half of the economic impact of a regular 
game. The NBA apologized to the city for standing it up on Valentine's 
day, and promised to bring the all-star game here as soon as possible. 
But the league admitted the next two games are already promised to 
other cities. To the fans of Philadelphia, we would say we're very 
sorry. We hoped to bring you both a season and an all-star game, and 
now we can't have an all-star weekend. And we hope there's still a 
season, but we can't guarantee that. No talks are scheduled in the 
lockout, and Stern said Tuesday it wouldn't make any sense to begin 
the season as late as mid-February. That gives the league, and its 
players, about five weeks to save the season. Tony Guida, "CNN Financial 
News," Philadelphia.
