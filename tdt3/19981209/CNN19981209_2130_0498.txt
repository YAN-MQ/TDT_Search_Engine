Fierce Santa Ana winds are lashing much of southern California. Speeds 
of up to 80 miles an hour are reported in some parts. The winds were 
so strong, they blew over big rigs on interstate 15, causing traffic 
snarls. Another Lane was closed by plywood and boards blown off an 
overpass under construction.
