Astronauts from the space shuttle "Endeavour" are out in space again 
as they install two antennas on the Unity module of the new international 
space station. The antennas will allow direct communications between 
the module and Mission Control. The work's being done by experienced 
space walkers Jerry Ross and Jim Neuman. If they have time, the astronauts 
will try to release an antenna on the Russia Zarya module that didn't 
unfurl properly after it was sent into orbit.
