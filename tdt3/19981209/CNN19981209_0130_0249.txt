Judiciary chairman Henry Hyde says a White House rebuttal to charges 
brought by independent counsel Ken Starr, "appears to contain no new 
evidence or challenge any testimony that the committee possesses." 
Instead, Hyde says it includes, "more legal hairsplitting and semantic 
gymnastics." The White House released the 184-page report Tuesday 
during defense testimony before the committee. In it, the White House 
argues that -- "whereas President Nixon used governmental agencies 
including the CIA and FBI to thwart the investigation into his lies, 
President Clinton did nothing of the sort."
