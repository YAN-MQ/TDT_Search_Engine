People have swam the English Channel before. Now someone has walked 
from England to France. A 36-year-old Russian sailor was detained 
Wednesday in the Channel Tunnel near where trains emerge on the French 
side. He entered the 30-mile undersea tunnel over the weekend on the 
English side, police said. Police were still trying to figure out 
how he was able to avoid detection by surveillance cameras and get 
past high fences and barbed wire. But the real miracle, they said, 
was that he was still alive. The tunnel is supposed to be only for 
high-speed trains that whiz up to 92 mph through the tunnel dozens 
of times a day, whipping up winds that can suck up objects, even a 
human being. The company that runs the tunnel believes the intruder 
survived by taking refuge in small openings in the wall every 410 
yards. ``We are still asking ourselves how this man could have gotten 
into the tunnel,'' said Dominique Maire, spokeswoman for Eurotunnel 
in Paris. The company is ``very worried'' by the incident, the first 
time a pedestrian has used the channel, she said, adding ``we will 
be very interested in knowing why.'' The man, who was not identified 
by name, wanted to join the French Foreign Legion, the ITAR-Tass news 
agency in Moscow said. ITAR-Tass said the man arrived in Scotland 
in November on the Russian trading ship Polar Star, then hitchhiked 
across England to make his way to France and the famed fighting force. 
The man, who was not identified by name, was detected as he prepared 
to surface at Coquelles, four miles west of the French port of Calais. 
French police returned the man to England, where he was being questioned 
by immigration officers, the British Home Office said. Millions of 
people take the train each year through the Channel Tunnel, which 
opened in 1994.
