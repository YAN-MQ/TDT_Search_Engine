Iraq can increase its oil exports by more than 700,000 barrels a day 
if it gets the badly needed spare parts, the oil minister said Wednesday. 
Iraq currently exports 1.8 million barrels of oil a day and Oil Minister 
Amer Mohammed said that amount would increase to more than 2.5 million 
barrels if Baghdad could get the dlrs 300 million dollars worth of 
spare parts approved by the United Nations for its ailing oil industry. 
The latest shipment arrived Nov. 25 and included material for the 
treatment of crude oil and removal of impurities. An acute shortage 
of spare parts has caused the quality of Iraqi crude to plunge. Mohammed 
blamed the U.S. representative on the U.N. sanctions committee for 
blocking the approval of the spare parts. ``He always blocks and puts 
contracts on hold,'' Mohammed told a news conference. The accusation 
echoes similar Iraqi complaints in the past that the United States 
and Britain deliberately hold up contracts for most items, a charge 
the two countries deny. Iraq was banned from selling oil freely under 
U.N. sanctions imposed after its 1990 invasion of Kuwait. Under a 
U.N. oil-for-food deal, Iraq is allowed to sell limited quantities 
of oil to buy food, medicines and other humanitarian goods since December 
1996. Mohammed said Iraq has signed 42 oil contracts since the fifth 
phase of the oil-for-food deal began early this month.
