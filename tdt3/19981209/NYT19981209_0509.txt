After fighting off a hostile takeover bid from a crosstown competitor, 
Sun Media Corp., one of Canada's largest newspaper companies, agreed 
Wednesday to accept a rival deal with a Montreal publisher. The proposed 
merger between Sun Media of Toronto and Quebecor Inc., which publishes 
newspapers in French and English, is worth about $680 million (U.S.). 
The deal would create the second-largest newspaper group in Canada, 
controlling more than a quarter of the nation's daily newspaper circulation. 
``This match puts together our newspaper strength in different cities,'' 
Paul Godfrey, president of Sun Media, said in a conference call with 
reporters Wednesday. ``It makes us into a truly national newspaper 
chain.'' The new group formed by Sun Media and Quebecor would have 
a combined circulation of 7.8 million copies a week and would include 
daily newspapers in 10 of Canada's top 11 markets. Vancouver is the 
exception. Canadian newspapers have been going through a shake-up 
and consolidation recently. Combined daily circulation hit a peak 
of 5.8 million copies a day in 1989 and had been declining ever since, 
though there have been gains in the last few months, according to 
the Canadian Newspaper Association, Earlier this year, Sun Media agreed 
to sell The Financial Post in Toronto to the publisher Conrad Black. 
In the complex deal, Sun Media received four daily newspapers in southern 
Ontario from Black's Hollinger International Inc. and its subsidiary, 
Southam Inc., for about $100 million (U.S.). In late October, Black 
began The National Post, incorporating The Financial Post into the 
paper's business section. The day after Black's newspaper hit the 
stands, Torstar Corp., which publishes The Toronto Star, Canada's 
largest daily newspaper, announced an unsolicited takeover bid for 
Sun Media. But Sun Media resisted the Torstar bid in part because 
it was considered too low and also because the two organizations have 
incompatible editorial positions and newsroom cultures. Sun Media 
publishes tabloid-sized newspapers filled with sports, entertainment 
and conservative editorials. The Toronto Star is a broadsheet whose 
editorial position is left of center. Sun Media conducted preliminary 
talks with Quebecor before Torstar's bid, and the pace increased substantially 
in subsequent days. An unsuccessful bid by Quebecor to take over Sun 
Media in 1996 had raised some concerns because the chairman of Quebecor, 
Pierre Peladeau, who has since died, supported Quebec independence. 
Godfrey said Wednesday that ``talk of any animosity between our companies 
just is not so.'' He said that Sun Media maintained a ``friendly rivalry'' 
with Quebecor but that the proposed merger was a good fit because 
the two chains do not compete directly in any market.
