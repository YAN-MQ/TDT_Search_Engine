President Clinton is one step closer to being the first president 
since richard Nixon to face impeachment. Republicans on the house 
Judiciary committee today prepared four articles of impeachment that 
include charges of perjury, obstruction of justice, and abuse of authority. 
Kurt kasting has more. The president's attorney was still defending 
his client when the republicans on the Judiciary committee released 
their four proposed articles of impeachment. First, he's accused of 
perjury before a federal grand jury. This article says he gave false 
and misleading testimony about his relationship with Monica Lewinsky. 
It says he lied about testimony in the Paula Jones case, that he lied 
about allowing his attorney, Bob Bennett, to introduce false information 
in that case, that he also lied about attempts to influence witnesses 
and to block evidence gathering. The second article accuses him of 
perjury in the Paula Jones case. It say he corrupted the judicial 
process for personal gain. Article three alleges obstruction of justice. 
It says he engaged in a cover-up in not only the Jones case but also 
the lewinsky investigation. One example -- the efforts to find Lewinsky 
a job. Finally, Mr. Clinton is accused of abuse of power -- first, 
by making false and misleading statements to the public and to his 
cabinet, by abusing his executive privilege to block testimony before 
the grand jury and by making false and misleading statements during 
the impeachment inquiry. Meanwhile, committee democrats had a very 
different plan. We are reaching out to moderate republicans. They 
offered a resolution to censure Mr. Clinton. It says the president 
has brought this upon himself and deserves the condemnation of the 
American people and Congress. The president would have to sign it. 
It allows us to show the gravity of the situation. It allows all members 
of Congress to vote their conscience. And it will allow us ultimately 
to avoid the divisive occurrence of a trial in the United States Senate. 
Which way will the committee go? A vote is expected by the end of 
the week. Kurt kasting, "Headline News."
