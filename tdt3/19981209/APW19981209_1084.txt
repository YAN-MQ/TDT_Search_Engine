Sweden's Astra and Britain's Zeneca confirmed Wednesday they will 
merge in a dlrs 37 billion deal that will create one of the world's 
biggest drug manufacturers. Astra is best known for Prilosec, an ulcer 
and heartburn medication that's the world's top selling prescription 
drug. Zeneca is the second biggest maker in the world of cancer drugs 
behind U.S.-based Bristol-Myers Squibb. The companies expect annual 
cost savings of dlrs 1.1 billion from the new company, which will 
be called AstraZeneca. However, they expect to incur about dlrs 1.2 
billion in restructuring costs and cut about 6,000 jobs, or 11 percent 
of their global workforce, in the next three years. The merger had 
been rumored for months. Confirmation boosted Astra's shares by 12.9 
percent, to 170.5 kronor (21 dlrs, 21 cents) in trading Wednesday 
on Stockholm's bourse. Midway through the session, the stock traded 
as high as 188 kronor (23 dlrs 38 cents), up 24 percent.
