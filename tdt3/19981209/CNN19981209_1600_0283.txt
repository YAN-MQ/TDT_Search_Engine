A judge in Michigan has ordered Jack Kevorkian to stand trial in connection 
with the death of a 52-year-old man with Lou Gehrig's disease. She 
made her decision after watching an unedited videotape of Kevorkian 
giving the man a lethal injection. Kevorkian has been charged with 
first-degree murder, criminal assistance of a suicide and delivery 
of a controlled substance. Kevorkian had dared prosecutors to charge 
him after he gave the CBS program "60 minutes" a videotape of the 
injection. He claims to have had a role in 130 assisted suicides.
