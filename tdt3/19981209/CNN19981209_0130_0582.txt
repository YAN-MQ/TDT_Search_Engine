The lights are back on in San Francisco after a blackout crippled 
the city tuesday. Don Knapp has the story. The lights blinked, came 
back, then died, and San Francisco came to a sudden stop. 8:17 A.M. 
pacific time, right in the midst of the morning commute, stalled bart 
trains, street cars and trolley buses stranded tens of thousands. 
Cable cars are out of commission. Metro's out of commission. Bart 
is out of commission into San Francisco. I would say there could have 
been as many as 30,000 to 40,000 people using metro in the morning. 
Exactly how many were in the tunnel and in between stations is hard 
to tell. Dead traffic lights gridlocked much of the city. About 375,000 
pacific gas and electric customers were without power. It appears 
at this time that simple human error may have been involved in the 
outage, then triggered a series of events. PG&E says its own workers 
may have failed to remove a temporary ground after completing work 
on this substation in San Mateo county. When they turned the power 
back on, the lights went out. San Francisco power's supply is especially 
vulnerable. Unlike most other locations, they get it from three or 
four different corridors. Because we are at the tip of the peninsula, 
we receive it from one corridor. While some private office buildings 
turned to emergency power or brought in generators, San Francisco 
public schools were on their own. This building, which houses kindergarten 
through two, has no lights, no electricity, no heat. Kids played outside 
or sat in darkened schools while teachers improvised. We used all 
the money, or most of the money from that membership drive to go out 
to all the stores to buy bread because we did not know whether or 
not we were going to have lunch. Although airplanes could land at 
San Francisco international airport, none could get off the ground. 
It took several hours after power was restored to reset reservations 
computers and luggage inspection X-Ray machines. By midday, with mass 
transit systems only partially restored, many commuters decided to 
write off a bad day and crowded onto ferries out of the city. They 
really took too long to let us go home. We had to suffer through it 
for a couple of hours. By late afternoon, the city's two power plants 
were back up and running, but many were still waiting for their lights 
to come on. Don Knapp, CNN, San Francisco, California.
