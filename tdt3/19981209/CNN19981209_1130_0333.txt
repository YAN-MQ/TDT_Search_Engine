"Endeavour" astronauts are scheduled to take a second space walk today 
to attach two 100 pound antennas to the international space station. 
Yesterday, the shuttle boosted the space station 5 1/2 miles higher, 
to an altitude of about 248 miles above the earth. That's closer to 
the position from which the shuttle will leave the station when it 
undocks Sunday. NASA is declaring the first space walk a success. 
Monday, two astronauts connected 40 cables linking the Russian and 
American components of the space station.
