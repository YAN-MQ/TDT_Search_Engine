Tamil Tiger rebels publicly executed a suspected ex-guerrilla who 
was running from police who believe he killed seven members of his 
family in eastern Sri Lanka, a newspaper said Wednesday. The guerrillas 
captured Somalingam Balasubramaniam, 28, in the jungles of the Batticaloa 
district and questioned him for three days before killing him on Tuesday, 
the Observer reported, citing unnamed civilian witnesses. The fate 
of Balasubramaniam's wife and six-year-old son, who fled with him 
into the jungles, was not known. It also was unclear whether he was 
killed because of his alleged murders or because the Tigers saw him 
as a traitor. Last week, police say, Balasubramanian grabbed an assault 
rifle and killed seven members of his family after an argument with 
his wife in Eravur, a town 210 kilometers (130 miles) east of Colombo, 
the Sri Lanka capital. Police believe Balasubramaniam was a member 
of the People's Liberation Organization of Tamil Eelam, a guerrilla 
group that gave up arms in 1987 and joined the political mainstream. 
But the group said Monday Balasubramaniam was a rebel who deserted 
the Tamil Tigers and approached the former rebel outfit six months 
ago. More than 56,000 people have died in the ethnic conflict since 
1983. The Liberation Tigers of Tamil Eelam is fighting for a separate 
homeland for minority Tamils, accusing majority Sinhalese of widespread 
discrimination in education and jobs.
