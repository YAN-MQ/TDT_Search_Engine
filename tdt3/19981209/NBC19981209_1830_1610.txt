For a lot of this year we have been saying, "what you're about to 
hear may not be appropriate for children." Well, tonight, we repeat 
the warning, but not for Bill Clinton/Monica lewinsky purposes. This 
time it is Santa claus. No, no, don't worry, no dirty tapes. Just 
some hard truths. NBC's Bob Faw on Santa undressed, as it were. And 
all this time you thought he was a Jolly old soul with dimples so 
merry. Wrong. I think Santa probably has a genetic defect. He's probably 
got diabetes as well. Explaining the rosy cheeks and plumpness, says 
British science writer Roger highfield, who spent ten years amassing 
the latest research on the holidays in this new book. Among its findings 
-- odds are, the real St. Nicholas, there was one, who lived in Turkey, 
didn't even know what a reindeer was. Nor has he been chilling out 
at the North Pole. It would probably be Santa lounging around in his 
swimming trunks on a Beach on an island off Turkey. So much for traditional 
views. Unless, of course, you believe in Santa claus. That's the way 
it's supposed to be. So, if you ask them -- Why is Rudolph's nose 
red? They know why. Because he's Rudolph. Whereas, if you ask him 
-- Rudolph's red nose is probably caused by a parasitic mite infection. 
And yes, Virginia, technology can unlock some of Santa's other secrets. 
How does he know you've been naughty or nice? Science says he uses 
"superconducting interquantitave interference devices," or "squids." 
Santa can use a sort of Ray of squids across the planet to scan the 
minds of all those children, figure out whether they've been good 
or bad. Highfield says technology can also unravel the most perplexing 
questions. How does Santa get to all those houses in one night? Santa's 
cracked this problem. In fact, by exploiting some of the implications 
of Einstein's theory of general relativity. The informed view then, 
and the old fashioned. But guess what? They're not that far apart. 
After all this research, talking to all these scientists, I'm more 
inclined to believe now more than ever, that Santa really does exist. 
And we heard him exclaim as he drove out of sight, merry christmas, 
modern science. And to all, a good night. Bob Faw, NBC news, Washington.
