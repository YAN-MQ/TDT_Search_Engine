In Washington, the government and Microsoft are spending some time 
in the court. This case puts Microsoft chief Bill Gates right in the 
front line of the antitrust trial. He is the richest American since 
Rockefeller and Washington is treating him exactly the same way. Just 
as the government sued to break up John Rockefeller's oil monoply, 
this year it took aim at Bill Gates' software empire. It's about making 
sure there's competition in this critical American industry. The government 
claims Gates used his monopoly as leverage to dominate the Internet. 
Gates' competitors showed up as government witnesses. The Internet 
is far too important to mankind to let anyone company dominate it. 
Microsoft lawyers, a small army of them, argued the government doesn't 
understand the software business and doesn't understand that business 
in general is not always friendly. You just heard an opening statement 
that was based entirely on loose and unreliable rhetoric and on snippets 
that were not in any sort of responsible context. The reluctant witness 
in all of this was Gates himself, who testified on tape and was forgetful 
and evasive. What do you mean concerned? What is it about the word 
concerned that you don't understand? I'm not sure what you mean by 
it. Is there a document where I use that term? There is no jury to 
weigh those words. This trial, and perhaps the future of the U.S. 
computer software industry, will be settled by one man, federal judge 
Thomas Penfield Jackson. Peter vial, "CNN Financial News," New York.
