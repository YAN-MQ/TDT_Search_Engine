Sweden's Astra and Britain's Zeneca confirmed today they will merge 
in a $37 billion deal that will create one of the world's biggest 
drug manufacturers. Astra is best known for Prilosec, an ulcer and 
heartburn medication that's the world's top selling prescription drug. 
Zeneca is the second biggest maker in the world of cancer drugs behind 
U.S.-based Bristol-Myers Squibb. The companies expect annual cost 
savings of $1.1 billion from the new company, which will be called 
AstraZeneca. However, they expect to incur about $1.2 billion in restructuring 
costs and cut about 6,000 jobs, or 11 percent of their global workforce, 
in the next three years. The merger had been rumored for months. Confirmation 
boosted Astra's shares by 12.9 percent, to 170.5 kronor (21 dlrs, 
21 cents) in trading Wednesday on Stockholm's bourse. Midway through 
the session, the stock traded as high as 188 kronor (23 dlrs 38 cents), 
up 24 percent. Last week, Germany's Hoechst and France's Rhone-Poulenc 
agreed to merge their drug and agrichemical businesses as the first 
step toward a total merger. In France, Sanofi and Synthelabo recently 
announced their $10 billion merger. Behind all these mergers is the 
need to increase research spending to compete with giants such as 
Pfizer, Glaxo Wellcome and Merck, and the desire to pool resources 
to boost marketing. ``If we are going to be competitive among world 
pharmaceutical companies, we need this merger,'' said Hakan Mogren, 
chief executive of Astra, who will be deputy chairman of the new company. 
Sweden's Wallenberg family owns 12 percent of Astra, established in 
1913. The company is also the maker of lidocaine, one of the leading 
local anesthesia drugs first developed in the 1940s. While its best 
known for Prilosec, the drug is scheduled to lose its patent protection 
in 2001. That will open the door for generic firms to make a less 
expensive copy and slow the company's overall sales growth. Besides 
its cancer drugs, Zeneca also has a large agro-chemical business and 
owns Salick Health Care, a U.S. operator of cancer treatment and dialysis 
centers. Last year, the company marketed its the migraine drug Zomig, 
which it bought from Glaxo Wellcome in 1995 while the drug was still 
being tested in humans. But like Astra, Zeneca also has several drugs 
that are expected to soon lose their patent protection. Analysts speculated 
that was a leading factor influencing the merger. The AstraZeneca 
corporate headquarters would be in London, the research and development 
headquarters in Sweden. The chairman of the new company would be Percy 
Barnevik, who heads Investor AB, the investment arm of the Wallenberg 
family of bankers and industrialists. Zeneca's top executive, Tom 
McKillop, would be CEO. The deal was unanimously approved by the boards 
of directors of both companies. Zeneca had $8.57 billion in sales 
in 1997 and has a current market value of $38.62 billion. Astra posted 
$5.68 billion in sales in 1997 and has a current market value of $24.48 
billion. Both companies had earnings of $1.2 billion in 1997.
