Working with a decorator was kind of like, `Whoa,''' said Amanda Sacks, 
who lives in a newly decorated four-story Victorian town house in 
Park Slope, Brooklyn. ``Because I'd never actually worked with a decorator 
before.'' Ms. Sacks, age 9, said she thought the experience was a 
good one. ``I might choose Chris again,'' she said, referring to future 
homes. ``If he's still decorating.'' In June 1997, when Karen Sacks; 
her husband, Bradley; their 16-year-old daughter, Jilian, and their 
9-year-old twins, Amanda and Blaire, hired Christopher Coleman, a 
New York decorator, they made it clear that they were all clients 
_ and available for consultation. Karen Sacks herself was no remodeling 
pushover. She is a magazine consultant and an ex-editor in chief of 
a design magazine, American Homestyle &AMP; Gardening. In short order, 
Ms. Sacks learned things she'd never told her readers _ like, what 
you think you can do in three months will take a neat year. She had 
never hired a decorator. Coleman had never designed a house. The job: 
one of those gorgeous late-19th-century piles that would have made 
a great funeral home. There was beautiful wood paneling _ wall to 
wall. Rooms were small parlors. A deep row house with windows only 
at the front and back, it had ceremonial darkness inhabiting its center 
hall, where a large stairway rose up through the house like organ 
music swelling. But the Sacks family, who had outgrown a house half 
the size, needed the space. And the top floor had matching bedrooms 
_ perfect for twins. Ms. Sacks had admired a modern room Coleman had 
recently done for a traditional Park Avenue show house. She called 
him the month they moved in _ with no furnishings in tow. ``I really 
wanted to have fun with the new house,'' Ms. Sacks said. Sacks, a 
trial lawyer, weighed in on opening remarks. ``Nothing in the house 
was to be looked at and not used,'' he recalled telling the decorator. 
Coleman's design dead-lifted the heavy interior in two muscular strokes: 
bright colors and big shapes. The palette and scale made the house 
stylish and playful _ both adult- and child-friendly. Above the paneling, 
Coleman installed a background of wallpapers in light shades of yellow 
and blue with soft paintlike patterns. They pulled the house together 
as a design, giving every recess a view _ a dappled landscape of wallpaper. 
It was a nicely economical decision. ``It's putting up a coat of adhesive 
and slapping on wallpaper as opposed to doing faux-painting,'' Coleman 
said. ``You're talking about a morning of work for a room instead 
of days _ about $1,000 instead of $3,000 to $5,000.'' Furnishings 
fill the foreground with a boisterous freedom of shape and scale. 
In the living room, the standard set is there, but it has been radically 
rethought. A long, kidney-shaped sofa, designed by Coleman, wraps 
snugly into a wide bay window. Two broad club chairs, upholstered 
in a zigzag fabric that looks like lightning in a comic strip, hold 
the other end. A French 1950s wrought-iron and glass coffee table 
could be a couturier's chandelier resting on the floor. In place of 
a living room mantelpiece _ the ground floor's fireplace is in the 
center hall _ Coleman designed a tall console for books and magazines 
that houses an ottoman beneath. A gong-size bronze mirror hangs above. 
``There's a lot of big furniture in small rooms here,'' Coleman said. 
``The scale of this stuff says it's contemporary before you even get 
to the fabrics and color.'' Upstairs in the master bedroom, the decorator 
reversed the scheme and removed the color to make the parents' room 
a quiet and peaceful respite from the family life of the house. Modulating 
grays give it a whisper instead of a shout: a dove-toned smudged checkerboard 
wallpaper, a silver-papered ceiling, a cut-velvet damask carpet and 
a custom-made armoire paneled in silver leaf and clouded-pearl washes 
of stain. The surfaces look like water gliding over stones. Coleman 
worked individually with each daughter, helping her establish important 
territory: my room. ``It isn't the largest room,'' Jilian Sacks said, 
``so I decided I wanted it to be purely a bedroom. I told Chris I 
wanted a comfortable room I could lounge in.'' She was swiveling in 
a low, two-person tufted 1940s armchair that Coleman had found at 
a thrift store and reupholstered in a harlequinade of colors. ``Blue 
is my favorite color,'' Ms. Sacks said, ``and I told Chris that. Then 
I couldn't decide between red and yellow. So we went for all of them.'' 
The palette repeats on a cartoon camelback headboard and polka-dot 
curtains. On the top floor, the twins rule _ separate but equal and 
by no means a matched set. ``They were very specific,'' Coleman said. 
``One likes blue, and one likes green. They each had to have the same 
chair, in their own colors.'' He designed plastic-laminate desks and 
display shelves for each, from sketches she approved. ``I wanted places 
to put my books and dolls instead of just putting them on the floor,'' 
Blaire said, sitting in her blue bedroom. ``He was good with ideas. 
I couldn't have really done it myself _ it's too hard.'' Amanda designed 
her tented bed from a model Coleman showed her in a catalog; she also 
chose the Laura Ashley fabric. The wallpaper was a surprise. ``I didn't 
actually know there were going to be stars and moons,'' she said of 
the stenciled cosmos. ``When it's dark, I feel like I'm up in the 
sky.'' Ms. Sacks showed the patience of a good client. ``You get used 
to seeing stars all over your room,'' she said. A guest bedroom, also 
on the top floor, is a short resume of Coleman's resourcefulness. 
The rug is inexpensive commercial carpeting that he had cut in bands 
of color, backed and glued as a piece, then laid down. On the walls 
is a rough Mexican tree bark paper, bought in sheets at an art-supply 
store. Though major renovations _ and the expenses connected with 
them _ were already history when the Sackses bought the house, budget 
was still a nervous subject for clients who had never worked with 
a decorator. ``That was the scariest part,'' Sacks said. ``Spending 
all this money at one time, because we were doing everything start 
to finish.'' Coleman calculated the cost of the fully furnished four 
floors, which included items specified by the clients, like a security 
system and other home electronics, at $250,000 _ within 20 percent 
of the proposed budget. The Sackses love their decorated house, each 
for his or her own reason. ``Each room really has a personality to 
it,'' Jilian Sacks said. ``It's not just things thrown here or there.'' 
Amanda Sacks gave the collaboration high marks. ``Working with a decorator 
is sort of working by yourself, because you have all these choices,'' 
she said. ``But really he's there just to help you and to choose what 
you want.'' What's the profession's strong suit? ``Talking,'' she 
said. Specs Like any decorator, Christopher Coleman has his tactics: 
how to spend less, when to spend more, and where to find it: LIGHTING 
is highly visible and worth some expense, he said. The Sacks house 
has commissioned designs by Stephen McKay (216 W. 18th St.; 212-255-2110) 
and pieces like an Alvar pendant (Hinson &AMP; Co.; 979 Third Ave., 
near 59th Street; 688-7754, to the trade). ART WORK can be a big expense. 
Coleman goes to shows at schools, including the Fashion Institute 
of Technology (next one, May 11 through 25, 1999) and Parsons School 
of Design (spring schedule available from 212-229-8987). ART-SUPPLY 
STORES are good bets for unusual papers, like the Mexican bark used 
in the Sackses' guest room, from New York Central Art Supply (62 Third 
Ave., at 11th Street; 473-7705). SAMPLE SALES save money and delivery 
time: be on mailing lists. Coleman got a lime-green Christine Van 
Der Hurd rug at the Cappellini Modern Age sale (next one is Jan. 9-20, 
1999; 102 Wooster St., near Spring Street; 343-9070). CARPETING can 
be cut into rugs, then trimmed, like the Sackses' leather-edge living-room 
rug, from Misha Carpet (18 E. 53rd St.; 688-5912, to the trade). Coleman 
uses remnants the same way, from ABC Carpet and Home (881 Broadway, 
near 19th Street; 473-3000).
