Chief U.N. weapons inspector Richard Butler says Iraqi officials blocked 
a Team from making a surprise inspection today. He calls the act "very 
serious." The team was attempting to search the headquarters of the 
Iraqi ruling party. An Iraqi official says four inspectors were allowed 
onto the premises, but they left when the other inspectors were refused 
entry. The U.S. state department says it will wait for Butler's full 
report before it makes a final assessment. We're waiting to get a 
report from ambassador Butler about exactly what went on. I don't 
have all the details. But of curse it's worrisome and we'll just have 
to see when we get the report. I assume we'll do so in the course 
of today and I'm sure we vel some comment ready at that point. U.S. 
secretary of state Madeleine Albright says the time for diplomacy 
is over. She says either Iraq fully cooperates with inspectors, or 
faces the threat of air raids.
