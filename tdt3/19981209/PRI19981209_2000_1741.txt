You're listening to The World. And you can join us any time on line, 
24 hours a day, at www.theworld.org. This is PRI. On the next Beyond 
Computers, what is reality? Well, we may have our own definitions, 
but what about virtual reality and subatomic reality and the realities 
of life inside computers? Join us for the next Beyond Computers when 
we discover some alternate realities. Thursday night at 10 on 91 FUHRMAN.

And a Nova Scotia singer says provincial officials promoted Scotland's

Highland bagpiper kind of marketing thing for tourism going on, but 
with none of those resources going back into teaching the language. 
And this has been going on since the 1930s. First, this news.
