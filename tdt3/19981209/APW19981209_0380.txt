Appealing for foreign assistance, President Yoweri Museveni Wednesday 
promised to fight high level corruption, but defended Uganda's increased 
military expenditure, saying instability in neighboring countries 
made it necessary. ``One impediment to more rapid economic development 
is corruption by state officials,'' Museveni said at the opening of 
a conference of more than 20 countries on financial aid to Uganda. 
Foreign donors have pledged dlrs 1,190 million over the next three 
years for social and economic programs in Uganda, while Uganda says 
it needs dlrs 2,176 million. The donors expect to decide by the end 
of the conference Friday whether to cover the dlrs 986 million balance. 
Donors earlier this week said they were concerned that public funds 
targeting the fight against poverty were disappearing into private 
hands and warned that without better accountability foreign funding 
to Uganda would not be forthcoming. It also criticized Uganda for 
increasing its military budget to dlrs 164 million this year, up dlrs 
30 million from the previous year. ``The worries within the donor 
community about the financial implications of military interventions 
abroad might affect budgeting for poverty eradication,'' said Netherlands 
Embassy official Saskia de Lang, representing donor countries at a 
meeting in Kampala on Monday. Uganda, along with neighboring Rwanda, 
has been openly sending troops and equipment to Congolese rebels fighting 
since Aug. 2 to oust Congolese President Laurent Kabila. Both countries 
argue that Kabila has allowed Rwandan and Ugandan rebels to operate 
freely in eastern Congo and launch cross-border attacks into their 
countries of origin. Uganda is also combating Ugandan rebels operating 
out of war-torn southern Sudan. Museveni said instability in the region 
made it vital that Uganda modernize its military. He noted the army 
had complied with World Bank and International Monetary Fund demands 
to scale down. ``Until 1993, we had an army of 100,000 officers and 
men,'' Museveni said. ``We reduced this to 40,000 on the clear understanding 
that the smaller force will have to be better equipped. We have not 
achieved the required level of equipping ... accelarated by the present 
crises in the region: Congo and Sudan.'' He said the Great Lakes region 
lacked a regional force to maintain peace and safeguard security for 
countries bordering war zones. Museveni, whose country's annual budget 
is 50 percent funded by other countries and multilateral institutions, 
acknowledged high level corruption was a difficult problem. He said 
he wanted to set up mechanisms of government plants inside the judiciary 
the revenue machinery, the land office, the immigration department, 
police and medical services to weed out graft. ``The army was easier 
to reform than all the other organs of state: judiciary, civil service 
and police,'' he said. ``This is because it takes much longer to train 
a judge than to train an army officer.'' ``I might be forced to import 
cadres from abroad,'' Museveni added. ``We might even import judges 
from abroad and what is wrong with that if they are doing a good job. 
They might not be corrupt.''
