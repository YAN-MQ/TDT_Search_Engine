Two masked men supported by some 150 Libyan passengers took over a 
chartered Egyptian airliner in mid-air Wednesday, demanding to be 
flown to Libya in violation of U.N. sanctions. The pilot, however, 
landed the plane in the Tunisian resort town of Jerba where the protesters 
got off. But Tunisian authorities put the passengers back on board 
and the aircraft flew to Cairo and then on to Yemen from where it 
had taken off. Security forces surrounded the plane at the Cairo airport, 
and reporters there did not see any passenger getting off. After refueling, 
the plane took off for San`a, the Yemeni capital, with the passengers.
