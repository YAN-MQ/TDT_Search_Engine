The easiest way to create a free home page is through community sites 
like www.tripod.com, www.geocities.com or www.angelfire.com. America 
Online and most other Internet service providers also offer free home 
pages. But your free personal Web site will probably have a complicated 
address and be only a few megabytes. And your host will probably put 
ads on your pages. But you can register an available domain name at 
internic.net for an annual fee of $75, as I did. ISPs like Earthlink, 
AT&AMP;T Worldnet and Mindspring will do all of the above for you 
for a monthly fee starting around $20. To design the site, software 
tools are available through community sites. I used Microsoft Frontpage 
($140) and bought the book ``Frontpage 98, Fast and Easy,'' by Coletta 
Witherspoon (Prima Publishing, $16.99). An inexpensive way to spice 
up your Web site with pictures is to scan in ordinary photographs, 
which can be done at many copying centers or photo-processing shops. 
Digital audio is a nice addition and relatively accessible; to use 
the one built into Windows, go to Programs, then Accessories, then 
Multimedia, then Sound Recorder. Keep the sound clip short, save the 
file, and add it to your site. I rigged our Web site to open with 
my son's voice saying, ``Welcome to my Web site.''
