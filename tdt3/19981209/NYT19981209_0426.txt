Independent counsel Kenneth Starr on Wednesday challenged several 
assertions in the White House's 184-page defense brief, complaining 
that President Clinton's rebuttal contains ``a series of misrepresentations 
regarding this office's referral.'' The sharply defensive two-page 
statement from Starr's office was unusual because it was made public 
at a critical moment in the impeachment debate. Before Wednesday, 
the Office of the Independent Counsel had refrained from responding 
to two previous White House rebuttals of its 445-page impeachment 
report, which was sent on Sept. 9 to the House of Representatives. 
``In our view, Congress should be guided by the facts and the evidence,'' 
Starr's statement said. ``That is why we submitted to Congress not 
only the referral, which organizes and summaries that evidence, but 
several thousand pages of raw evidence itself. Indeed, every item 
of evidence in the White House's submission came from our office.'' 
James Kennedy, of the White House Counsel's Office, shot back Wednesday 
evening: ``The so-called independent counsel, in a partisan effort 
to help Republicans who want to impeach the president, has actually 
highlighted the shallowness of his referral by finding so little fault 
with our 184-page submission. The independent counsel has done nothing 
to challenge our showing that he omitted reams of exculpatory evidence 
from his referral and misled the Congress about the facts.'' Prosecutors 
in Starr's office were stung by what they said were mischaracterizations 
of fact in the White House's point-by-point defense brief, which was 
sent to the House Judiciary Committee on Tuesday night. Wednesday 
night prosecutors were preparing additional public statements to refute 
other statements they said were ``misleading'' in the White House 
rebuttal. ``The White House spent three months analyzing, dissecting 
and attacking the referral and all the attachments,'' said Charles 
G. Bakaly III, Starr's spokesman. ``When they testify before Congress 
and we believe they are not being accurate or complete or they mischaracterize 
the referral, we will protect the integrity of the investigation.'' 
But White House lawyers and the Democrats on the Judiciary Committee 
angrily objected to the statement, saying that prosecutors had improperly 
injected their view of the evidence into the middle of the committee's 
impeachment debate. ``It is stunningly inappropriate, if not professionally 
unethical, for Mr. Starr to meddle in the president's defense before 
the committee,'' said Jim Jordan, spokesman for the Democrats on the 
committee. Samuel Dash resigned as Starr's ethics adviser last month 
because he objected to Starr's decision to testify on Nov. 19 before 
the committee and his appearing to be ``an aggressive advocate'' for 
the impeachment of Clinton. In his resignation letter, Dash said Starr 
had rejected his ``strong advice'' to decline the invitation to testify. 
Wednesday night, Dash declined to comment about the latest statement 
by Starr's office. When Dash quit, Starr said that if he had declined 
the invitation to testify it would have suggested to the public that 
``we are unwilling to defend and stand by the referral.'' In its statement 
Wednesday, Starr's office challenged what it said were several ``misleading 
statements'' in the White House rebuttal. First, it disputed the White 
House argument that Clinton did not lie when he denied having any 
memory of being alone with Monica Lewinsky. ``In fact, the president 
did not deny that he had been alone with Ms. Lewinsky,'' the White 
House lawyers wrote in their rebuttal. ``For example, the president 
answered `yes' to the question, `Your testimony is that it was possible, 
then, that you were alone with her. ...?''' But Starr's office said 
the White House omitted ``a significant part of the quotation in which 
the president said that he had no `specific recollection' about being 
alone with her, and even limited that theoretical possibility to when 
Ms. Lewinsky worked in the White House and brought him papers.'' Starr's 
prosecutors also noted that Clinton had been alone with Ms. Lewinsky 
only three weeks before he made that statement. The second rebuttal 
disputed the White House contention that there was ``no foundation 
in the record,'' other than Ms. Lewinsky's grand jury testimony, to 
indicate that Clinton's gifts to Ms. Lewinsky were retrieved on Dec. 
28, 1997, the same day as her last meeting at the White House with 
the President. ``That is false,'' the statement said. Starr's prosecutors 
say that the White House ignored this piece of corroborative evidence: 
Cell-phone records from Betty Currie, Clinton's personal secretary, 
show that Ms. Currie called Ms. Lewinsky on Dec. 28 at 3:32 p.m, the 
statement says. ``Without knowledge of these phone records,'' the 
prosecutors say, ``Ms. Lewinsky stated that Ms. Currie called her 
on December 28, and she thought Ms. Currie may have been calling from 
her cell-phone.'' Finally, Starr's prosecutors said that the White 
House ``falsely contends'' that Clinton and Ms. Lewinsky ``discussed'' 
what should be done with the gifts. The White House rebuttal cites 
Ms. Lewinsky's testimony that the president ``didn't really discuss 
it.'' ``Actually,'' Starr's prosecutors said, ``Ms. Lewinsky's words 
`he didn't really discuss it' came in response to a second, more specific 
question, after Ms. Lewinsky had spent several hundred words recounting 
her conversation with the president about the gifts.''
