In the latest confrontation over U.N. weapons inspections, Iraqi officials 
on Wednesday blocked international weapons inspectors from entering 
the headquarters of President Saddam Hussein's ruling Baath party, 
state-run radio said. Richard Butler, head of the U.N. Special Commission 
that oversees the inspectors, had announced earlier this week that 
``surprise'' inspections would resume on Tuesday. Iraqi radio said 
a U.N. weapons team tried to get into the party's Baghdad office ``in 
a provocative manner ... without previous announcement.'' The broadcast, 
which quoted the official Iraqi News Agency, said the Baath party 
official in charge demanded that the head of the U.N. team give him 
a written declaration ``on the banned items'' the team was seeking. 
``The team rejected this and withdrew,'' the agency said. The exact 
location of office involved in Wednesday's incident was not immediately 
known, and there was no immediate comment from U.N. arms officials 
in Baghdad. The incident occurred as nearly 200 U.N. inspectors searched 
for banned weapons in Iraq. Earlier, Caroline Cross, spokeswoman for 
the Special Commission here, said all the U.N. arms experts in the 
country were working Wednesday.
