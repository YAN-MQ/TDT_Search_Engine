Bosnia must get rid itself of its communist era financial structures 
and develop a self-sustainable market economy soon or foreign businesses 
will stay out, a senior U.S. diplomat said on Wednesday. ``Bosnia-Herzegovina 
can no longer live on foreign aid,'' Robert Gelbard said. ``The time 
of foreign aid has peaked and has begun to decline.'' But if an appropriate 
business climate is not soon created, he added, the aid will not be 
replaced by foreign investments and business since potential investors 
are reluctant to do business here. ``The reasons were obvious: corruption, 
lack of adequate rule of law, bad business climate,'' he said. Gelbard 
urged local leaders to speed up their work in two fundamental areas: 
privatization and the need for the development of a new payment system 
in this country. The current payment bureaus are instruments of state 
control over the means of production, Gelbard said. ``They demonstrate 
a system which is not used anywhere else in the World and show medieval 
business practices.'' Banks do not operate like banks anywhere else 
in the world. There are no checking accounts here, no use of credit 
cards, no automatic banking machines, he said. ``These are symbols, 
they are real, but they are symbols that demonstrate that these structures 
are useless and over time need to be replaced by new structures, so 
Bosnia-Herzegovina can join the rest of Europe and the world,'' he 
said. It is a natural evolution this country should be going through 
and the key word in the process is transparency, he said. Gelbard 
accused Bosnian Serb President Nikola Poplasen of working against 
his own people by wanting to remove the pro-western prime minister, 
Milorad Dodik. Dodik recently made a move to reduce the influence 
of the Yugoslav dinar in his part of Bosnia and raise the one of the 
new common Bosnian currency that has been introduced recently. Four 
different currencies were circulating around the country and the new 
one was supposed to replace them. The Muslim-Croat Federation switched 
to the new currency right away, while the Bosnian Serbs in their half 
of the country remained loyal to the Yugoslav dinar. According to 
a World bank report, inflation in the first nine month in the Muslim-Croat 
Federation has been almost zero. Thanks to the new currency, Gelbard 
said. In the same period, the Bosnian Serb half of the country experienced 
a 30 percent inflation because they use the Yugoslav dinar and make 
themselves dependent of the Belgrade-based Yugoslav National bank 
that pursues a ``highly inflationary monetary policy'' Gelbard cited 
the report. Right now Serbia's most important export to the Bosnian 
Serbs is inflation, he said. ``Not satisfied to destroy their own 
economy, they are jealous of what's happening in Republika Srpska 
under the Dodik government and they want to hurt theirs too.''
