What the Furby electronic pet is to the single-digit set the leather 
Palm Pilot case is to the adult digital one: the hottest gift item 
of the season. Encasing the Palm Pilot in lizard or saddle leather 
is part of the fervid culture that has grown up around this digital 
record keeper, calendar, address book and organizer. Both Furby and 
the Palm Pilot attempt to wrap technology in texture, one making electronics 
fuzzy and friendly, the other making them slick and chic. The Palm 
Pilot, of course, is the latest prestige electronic tool _ some would 
say toy _ and one of the fastest-selling pieces of computer equipment 
of all time. Part Ben Franklin, part New Age, the Palm Pilot, which 
can synchronize with a desktop computer through a clever cradle mechanism, 
has inspired a whole aftermarket of electronic add-ons. Now it has, 
in effect, a line of leather clothing. From Coach to Cole-Haan, leather 
makers are pushing Palm cases. Cole-Haan offers cases of woven leather; 
its midtown Manhattan store sold three in the first few hours after 
they went on sale a few days ago, said Aroz Paz, the manager of the 
store. ``We've had to reorder twice already,'' Paz said. For some 
buyers, the $70 cases are an office gift _ professional but personal 
at the same time. Dooney &AMP; Burke was among the first into the 
market _ its cases appeared in the early Palm Pilot accessory catalogs. 
It now offers the Java Lizard at $125 and a $225 alligator model. 
Its Palm cases are lined in calfskin, the better to protect the screen. 
Vuitton, which doesn't offer a Palm pack, recently custom-built one 
for a devotee. Vendors of leather goods, like those of watches and 
jewelry, always do well at the holidays, when the imminent new year 
inspires a desire for order and new resolutions. The equipment, too, 
is wrapped in a culture _ some would say cult _ that is at once organizational 
and uplifting. Introduced by a company once named US Robotics, now 
part of 3Com, the Palm Pilot enjoys extreme loyalty. ``It has my life 
on it,'' one entrepreneur was quoted as saying recently. The Palm 
Pilot is at least as valuable as a wallet to its fans. Combining traditions 
of self-improvement and New Age business gospel, a Palm Pilot is prestigious 
because it says your life is full and complex. The leather case amplifies 
this message. Eighteen months ago, the makers of the Franklin Planner 
teamed up with Stephen R. Covey, the author of the best-selling ``The 
7 Habits of Highly Effective People,'' to sell organizing and inspirational 
products in a chain of Franklin Covey stores. Palm Pilot accessories 
have become an important part of their wares. The Franklin Covey Palm 
cases come in a dizzying variety of styles. Owners can hook Palm Pilots 
to their belts or bind them with Velcro or brass clips into portfolios 
shared by pads and credit-card holders. The pitches for the products 
hint at one-upmanship: the needle-textured leather of Evergreen, the 
Franklin Covey catalog promises, ``will leave your friends green with 
envy.'' The cases signal both protection for precious and delicate 
equipment and mediation between the technological world and the social 
one. Leather is as much high prestige as it is high finish. That it 
is required to encase the Palm Pilot suggests a deficiency in the 
original plastic. Competitors, like Philips' Nino, offer metallic 
finishes and rubber buttons. But a more organic, touchable material 
is needed for an item so important, that spends so much time in close 
proximity to hand and heart. Leather has long served as a mediating 
material between skin and metal, as in cameras and binoculars. ``The 
design of these things is still pretty generic,'' said Bob Brunner, 
former head of design at Apple Computer, now a designer at Pentagram. 
``And since you carry them with you virtually all the time, it's a 
natural thing to personalize. It's clothing for electronics.'' The 
ultimate Palm case is perhaps the leather jacket offered by the company 
itself, with an inside pocket for the device and the words ``Palm 
Pilot'' emblazoned on the outside. Like the garb of a motorcycle gang, 
it is the most explicit indicator that ownership of a Palm Pilot also 
implies membership. The leather cases ignore the fact that the Palm 
Pilot comes with its own rudimentary case, reminiscent of a plastic 
pocket protector, once the signal of true computer geekdom. ``Nerd 
packs,'' they were called. Just as computers have moved from geek 
to chic, Palm Pilot cases have gone from plastic to leather: call 
it the revenge of the nerd pack.
