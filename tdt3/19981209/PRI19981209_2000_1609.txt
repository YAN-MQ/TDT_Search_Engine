In other business news, Wal-Mart is expanding its beachhead in. The 
retail giant today announced that it's acquiring a chain of stores 
from Germany's Spahr Handeles. From our business desk in New York, 
Liz George has details. Wal-Mart is already the world's largest discount 
retailer, but it's had its sights firmly fixed on the German market 
for some time. This purchase of 74 warehouse stores is the second 
in the country within a year. This allows the Arkansas-based company 
to increase its presence in Europe's largest retail market. Ken Goldstein, 
an economist with the Conference Board, says it's like to start a 
trend among U.S. retailers. Assuming that Wal-Mart has some success, 
either way there's going to be more, either they will come initially 
in order to meet a head-to-head challenge with Wal-Mart, or they will 
wait a period, perhaps six months or so, and then take advantage of 
what's over there. It seems strange. I mean, in the U.S., consumers 
are spending money like there was no tomorrow. In Europe, they're 
not. So is this the right time to start going into Europe? One of 
the things that I think you can fairly well assume is that Wal-Mart 
has thought all these things out. They're not going to give up in 
three months. They're going to put some money behind this, and they're 
going to wait to see if indeed they can make a long-term success out 
of this for at least the next 10 years. How much do you think that 
this is driven or helped by the fact that the Euro comes into play 
at the beginning of next year? I think it affects the timing of what 
they're doing. I don't think it affects the basic decision. There 
is a widespread belief, more than a forecast, that a Euro success 
in Europe might develop 2 to 3 to 4 million new service jobs in Europe 
over the next 12 to 18 to 24 months. Well, you know, 2 to 3 to 4 million 
jobs, that's a lot for people going, you know,, and so Wal-Mart and 
Wal-Mart's competitors are looking to bring these new customers into 
their stores. And analysts believe the move by Wal-Mart will not only 
force other U.S. retailers to go global but will encourage European 
retailers to set their sights on America too. For The World, I'm Liz 
George in New York.
