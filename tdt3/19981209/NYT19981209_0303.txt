In a landmark decision that touches a deep divide between strictly 
religious and secular Israelis the Israeli Supreme Court ruled Wednesday 
that a longstanding exemption for rigorously Orthodox Jewish yeshiva 
students from army service was illegal. The ruling, challenging a 
practice dating from Israel's inception, highlighted the growing role 
of the Supreme Court in deciding the struggle between religion and 
state. The exemption from compulsory service of a growing number of 
yeshiva students _ 30,000 this year _ has embittered many secular 
Israelis, who accuse the strictly Orthodox of shirking a duty borne 
by the rest of society. In a country where many people risk life and 
limb on army duty, the exemptions are a ``discrimination between blood 
and blood,'' said Amnon Rubinstein, a lawmaker from the leftist Meretz 
party who petitioned the court to set quotas for the exemptions. He 
was joined in the suit by another Meretz legislator, Haim Oron; by 
a group of army reservists, and by university and high school students 
who sought to cancel the exemptions entirely. After months of deliberations 
an 11-judge panel headed by Chief Justice Aharon Barak ruled that 
the system, under which the defense minister grants exemptions, was 
illegal. The court gave Parliament a year to pass legislation on the 
issue, adding that if none is passed the present system would be automatically 
canceled. The exemptions had created a ``deep rift in Israeli society 
and a growing sense of inequality,'' and such matters of principle 
that are ``disputed in the general public should be decided by the 
legislator,'' Barak wrote in the unanimous opinion, which the two 
religious judges on the bench also endorsed. Because they cannot work 
under the terms of the study exemption, strictly Orthodox yeshiva 
students had become impoverished, creating ``a social problem of the 
first order,'' the court said. ``The current situation has created 
an entire population that is not integrated into the labor market 
and is increasingly dependent on state stipends.'' Originated by the 
first prime minister, David Ben-Gurion, to preserve the scholarly 
remnants of Orthodox Jewry that were almost destroyed in the Holocaust, 
the system applied to 400 students in 1948. But the number mushroomed 
over the years, as thousands of strictly Orthodox young men sought 
refuge from military service through enrollment in full-time yeshivas. 
Significant numbers work, despite their official registrations as 
full-time students. According to army figures, 8 percent of the exemptions 
from military service are given to people registered as strictly Orthodox 
yeshiva students. Other exemptions are given to Israeli Arabs and 
to people found unfit for service. After the ruling, legislators from 
Meretz and strictly Orthodox parties indicated that they were ready 
to negotiate a compromise bill that would regulate the exemptions 
and prevent abuses. Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu said he intended 
to submit a bill that would be ``an agreed proposal that will prevent 
a rift in the nation and, I think, insure the unity of the nation.''
