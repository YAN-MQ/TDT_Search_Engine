For The World, this is Pamela McCall in the BBC newsroom in London. 
House Judiciary Committee Republicans have drafted four articles aimed 
at impeaching President Clinton. The committee will debate the articles, 
two counts of perjury, one of obstruction of justice, and one of abuse 
of power, on Thursday. Republican Representative Bob Barr says he 
refuses a vote of censure. In my view, censure is wholly, entirely, 
and utterly inappropriate, and I will not lend my name or my efforts 
to any effort to either bring censure to the floor or to consider 
it in any way, shape, or form. I believe it is unconstitutional, I 
believe it is inappropriate to even consider censure as a substitute 
for impeachable offenses. Republican Representative Bob Barr. The 
House Judiciary Committee will vote on the four articles by the end 
of this week.
