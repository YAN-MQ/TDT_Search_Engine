Finally this evening, now that we've seen where some of the computer 
leaders think we're going, how about where man is going? There are 
certainly scientists who believe that how the cow goes now, man is 
sure to emulate. ABC's Ned Potter tonight on the latest cloning. The 
problem to some biologists was that, regardless of whether cloning 
was wrong, it was inefficient. To create Dolly the sheep, they tried 
and failed 277 times. But the Japanese team, working with cattle, 
had a much higher batting average. They made ten embryos from the 
cells of an adult cow and produced eight identical calves. The technology 
is moving much quicker than any of us could have ever imagined. Cloning 
experiments have become all but routine. Mice cloned in Hawaii, Bulls 
in Wisconsin. Researchers say the process is getting very reliable. 
All of a sudden, efficiency is not a reason not to clone people. Clone 
people? Soon? Despite the outcry against it, a few doctors in different 
countries say they plan to try. And biologists now say it would not 
take a breakthrough for someone to pull it off. Ned Potter, ABC News, 
New York.
