Two American peacekeepers were detained by Bosnian Serb troops last 
week on the same day NATO troops arrested a Bosnian Serb general indicted 
for war crimes, NATO said Wednesday. Maj. David Miller of Appleton, 
Wisc., and Pfc. Jarred King of Columbia, Mississippi were visiting 
a Bosnian Serb army corps headquarters when its commander, Gen. Radoslav 
Krstic, was arrested Dec. 2 on a warrant from the international war 
crimes court in The Hague, a NATO statement said. ``Immediately after 
Krstic's apprehension, Bosnian Serb Army officers had instructed Maj. 
Miller and his interpreter to remain in the corps headquarters,'' 
said Lt. Col. Stephen Kerrick, a NATO spokesman. Miller told King, 
his driver, to remain outside with their vehicle. King was repeatedly 
asked to hand over his weapon and ammunition, which he refused, the 
statement said. The private asked to see Maj. Miller and after about 
90 minutes was allowed to do so, the statement added. The two stayed 
at the Bosnian Serb headquarters for about two hours until they were 
allowed to leave, the statement added. ``They were not harmed and 
mistreated during two hours remaining at the headquarters,'' Kerrick 
said. Krstic is accused of overseeing the 1995 massacre of thousands 
of Muslims when Bosnian Serb army overran town of Srebrenica. About 
7,000 U.S. troops are currently deployed in Bosnia as part of NATO-led 
peacekeeping mission and most of them are in northern Bosnia.
