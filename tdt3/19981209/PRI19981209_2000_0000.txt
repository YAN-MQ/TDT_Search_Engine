This is The World. A co-production of the BBC World Service and PRI 
International. Today, Britain rules Spain can start extradition proceedings 
against Augusto Pinochet, and researchers find the skull and skeleton 
of a 3.5 million-year-old person. Probably it is the most momentous 
paleoanthropological find ever made in Africa. Also, why do many Puerto 
Rican voters prefer ambiguity to certainty? Because ambiguity is much 
more useful. People want to have the best of both worlds. But first, 
this news.
