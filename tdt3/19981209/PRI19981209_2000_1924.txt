The United States has warned Iraq that it must fully cooperate with 
United Nations weapons inspectors. Otherwise, there will be no review 
of existing sanctions against Baghdad, and the use of force remains 
an option. In the latest diplo -- rather, dispute between the Iraqi 
authorities and the weapons inspectors, the UNSCOM team was barred 
access to an office on a surprise visit. Secretary of State Madeleine 
Albright urges Iraq to cooperate. It is essential for there to be 
a certification of cooperation first by Chairman Butler and then with 
the secretary general to the Security Council. And there will be comprehensive 
review until there is evidence that Iraq is cooperating with UNSCOM's 
requests. Secretary of State Madeleine Albright.
