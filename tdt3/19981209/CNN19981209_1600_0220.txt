The house Judiciary committee begins debate on the proposed articles 
of impeachment tomorrow, with a committee vote set for Friday or Saturday. 
Even as the house Judiciary committee forges ahead with its impeachment 
hearing, public opinion is against it. In a CNN/"USA today" Gallup 
poll taken last night, 59% of the 544 respondents say the committee 
should vote against the proceeding. 34% support it. Among the 59% 
who oppose impeachment, 8% say they are against it, because they do 
not believe the president did anything illegal. 48% think even if 
his actions were illegal, they are "not impeachable."
