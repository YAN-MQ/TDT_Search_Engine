Japanese corporate managers are more pessimistic about business conditions 
than ever but expect an improvement next year, according to a Ministry 
of Finance survey released Wednesday. The survey's business sentiment 
index for big corporations, a measure of managers' outlook on the 
economy, sank to minus 31.2 for the October-December quarter, the 
worst since the ministry began the survey in 1983. The index stood 
at minus 28.8 a quarter earlier. The index is the difference between 
the percentage of companies that say the economy is worsening from 
those that say it's getting better. In the January-March quarter, 
the business sentiment index for all big corporations is expected 
to improve to minus 10.6, while in the April-June period the index 
is expected to rise to minus 0.6, the survey showed. The ministry 
surveyed 10,959 companies in November: 3,580 manufacturers and 7,379 
non-manufacturers. Replies were received from 81 percent of the companies.
