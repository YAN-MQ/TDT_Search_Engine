A strike by airport workers forced more than a dozen flight cancellations 
Wednesday. At least 16 flights were dropped in Athens, airport officials 
said. The workers, which include airport maintenance and ground crews, 
are protesting the merger of their supplementary pension fund with 
other plans. The consolidation is part of government efforts to streamline 
state spending and earn a spot in the European Union's single currency 
group. Meanwhile, the airport in Greece's second-largest city, Salonica, 
experienced additional troubles because of snow and ice. Dozens of 
domestic and international flights were canceled or postponed.
