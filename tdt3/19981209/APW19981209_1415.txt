The top U.S. envoy for Kosovo insisted Wednesday that diplomacy aimed 
at resolving the conflict is ``still on track'' despite rejection 
by all sides of the latest peace proposal. Christopher Hill spoke 
after launching a new round of shuttle talks in the turbulent province, 
where the ethnic Albanian majority and Serbian authorities have refused 
to budge from their main demands. An October truce that halted months 
of combat between separatist rebels and Serb forces is largely holding. 
But many expect fighting to resume by spring if a political settlement 
is not reached. Frequent shooting incidents have marred the shaky 
peace _ the latest a report of attacks by gunmen on two Serb police 
patrols Wednesday that injured two policeman. Hill, returning to the 
region from Washington, met for several hours with ethnic Albanian 
negotiators in Pristina. He planned to meet later with a political 
representative of the Kosovo Liberation Army. He has scheduled talks 
Thursday in Belgrade with the Serbian side, which formally rejected 
the latest U.S. draft on Wednesday. ``We believe that our negotiations 
are still on track,'' Hill, who also is U.S. ambassador to neighboring 
Macedonia, told reporters. ``Ultimately the responsibility of reaching 
a settlement rests with both sides,'' he said. ``They need to find 
ways to compromise.'' Both Hill and Wolfgang Petritsch, the European 
Union envoy for Kosovo, who joined in the talks, cited the urgency 
of trying to reach a settlement soon in order to head off new fighting. 
Petritsch expressed optimism that ``something should be achieved in 
the next couple of weeks.'' ``This is a very decisive point in time,'' 
he said. ``We mustn't lose the momentum.'' Based on their public statements, 
the gulf between the sides appears huge. Hill admitted that ``it's 
not an easy process.'' The ethnic Albanian officials insist on a solution 
that would break away Kosovo from Serbia, while the KLA has said it 
won't accept anything short of outright independence. In Paris, French 
President Jacques Chirac told Kosovo's leading ethnic Albanian politician, 
Ibrahim Rugova, of France's concern over the ``absence of political 
will'' on both sides to resolve the crisis. A French official, briefing 
reporters on condition he not be named, said Chirac said the two sides 
should begin talks without delay on the future of the province. ``I 
hope that with the efforts of the United States, the European Union 
and also France ... that we will arrive at something,'' Rugova told 
reporters after the 45-minute meeting. Senior Serbian officials, including 
President Milan Milutinovic, formally rejected the latest Hill plan 
Wednesday, reiterating support for a Serb draft which keeps the province 
firmly within the republic. They did not elaborate in a statement 
issued by the official Tanjug news agency. But a day earlier, Serbian 
negotiator Ratko Markovic said the U.S. draft would require ``reconstructing 
the whole of Yugoslavia'' and lead to independence for Kosovo. Kosovo, 
where ethnic Albanians comprise about 90 percent of a population of 
2 million, had autonomy until then-Serbian President Slobodan Milosevic 
revoked it in 1989. After KLA rebels began attacking the police forces 
that maintain a massive presence in the province, Serbian forces launched 
a crackdown last February that killed hundreds of people and uprooted 
an estimated 300,000 from their homes. Periodic violence has continued. 
The pro-government Serb Media Center said groups of armed Albanian 
gunmen attacked police patrols Wednesday afternoon near Dolovo village 
in western Kosovo and Opterusa in the southwest. Two policemen were 
reported hospitalized as a result of the Dolovo attack, including 
one with serious injuries.
