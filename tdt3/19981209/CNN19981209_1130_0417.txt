United Nations weapons inspectors are facing new obstacles in Iraq. 
Chief inspector Richard Butler says Iraqi officials blocked one of 
his teams from conducting a surprise inspection in Baghdad. Butler 
called the incident very serious and said it was "against the law" 
imposed by the U.N. security council. He says the surprise inspections 
will continue through the end of the week.
