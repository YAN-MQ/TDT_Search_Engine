Some good news for the troubled aerospace giant Boeing -- TWA has 
ordered 50 of Boeing's new and smaller 717 jets. It also has options 
for 50 more. That order has a potential value of $3 billion. This 
comes on top of yesterday's order from a European carrier for $335 
million of those planes. Boeing just last week announced layoffs and 
production cutbacks due to the economic turmoil in Asia.
