The New York Times said in an editorial for Thursday, Dec. 10: Even 
before Tropical Storm Mitch devastated Nicaragua and Honduras, they 
were Latin America's poorest nations. While they are still struggling 
to prevent disease, provide shelter and get food to the victims, those 
nations and their less-affected neighbors are thinking about long-term 
reconstruction. They need billions of dollars to rebuild. Creditor 
nations and international donors must forgive the debts of Honduras 
and Nicaragua. Washington should also grant the region trade preferences 
that encourage economic growth. Nicaragua, one of the world's most 
indebted nations, owes $6 billion to governments and institutions 
such as the International Monetary Fund. Last year it paid 11 times 
more in debt service than it spent on basic health care _ 40 percent 
of its export earnings. Honduras owes $4 billion. Washington suspended 
for two years their payments on debt owed to the United States, but 
this is not enough. The United States should join European nations 
such as France in forgiving the debts and offering some relief to 
El Salvador and Guatemala. Washington should also use its influence 
to get the I.M.F. and other lending institutions to do the same. Relief 
must be conditioned on good use of the money. It must be closely monitored 
to insure that it goes to basic infrastructure, education, forestation, 
health and other programs that will give Nicaragua and Honduras the 
tools to emerge from poverty. Washington should also allow illegal 
aliens from Central America to stay in the United States. It has promised 
to stop deportations only until January. Washington can help the affected 
Central American nations recover the trade and investment benefits 
they once gained from the 1984 Caribbean Basin Initiative. Their advantage 
was lost to Mexico after the signing of the North American Free Trade 
Agreement, which also hurt the Caribbean. To help both regions develop 
a diversity of new jobs, President Clinton should ask Congress to 
give their exports the same entry to the United States that Mexican 
exports enjoy.
