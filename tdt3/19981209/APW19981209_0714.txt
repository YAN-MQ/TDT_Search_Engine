An Iraqi official refused to allow a U.N. weapons inspection team 
into an office of the ruling Baath Party on Wednesday unless it produced 
search papers, the official Iraqi News Agency said. The U.N. team 
then turned back. It was the first time a U.N. team was blocked from 
conducting a search for banned weapons since Richard Butler, head 
of the U.N. Special Commission that oversees the inspectors, announced 
earlier this week that ``surprise'' inspections would resume on Tuesday. 
Last month, a team was not allowed into a base run by Iranian exiles, 
the Mujahedeen Khalq. A U.N. team tried to get into a headquarters 
of the party of Iraqi President Saddam Hussein at about 9 a.m. (0600 
gmt) ``in a surprising and provocative manner,'' the agency said, 
quoting Gen. Hossam Mohammed Amin, head of the National Monitoring 
Directorate that provides escorts to the U.N. inspectors. The Baath 
party official in charge of the headquarters demanded that the head 
of the U.N. team give him a written declaration ``on the material 
and items'' they sought, Amin said. ``The team rejected this request 
and withdrew from the site,'' he was quoted as saying. Amin said the 
behavior of the teams ``has the clear goal of creating crises and 
problems.'' The exact location of the Baath Party office involved 
in Wednesday's incident was not immediately known. But witnesses say 
U.N. inspectors gathered in front of a Baath Party headquarters in 
the Baghdad neighborhood of Adhamiya on Wednesday morning. The U.N. 
Special Commission operations room here said the U.N. headquarters 
in New York asked that spokeswoman Caroline Cross make no comment 
to reporters on the incident. The incident occurred as nearly 200 
U.N. inspectors searched for banned weapons in Iraq. Cross said all 
the U.N. arms experts in the country were working Wednesday. Cross 
said the 130-140 inspectors on regular teams were working as well 
as some visiting experts. She would not give the exact number involved 
but said it was ``a little less than 200.'' When asked if they would 
be carrying out surprise visits, she said only the ``inspectors will 
carry on a full range of activities in Iraq.'' Unannounced visits 
in the past have been a major source of friction with Iraq. On Tuesday, 
nine arms monitoring groups, two biological warfare teams and a missile 
unit conducted 32 searches, some using helicopters, INA said. Among 
the sites visited Tuesday were barracks of the Republican Guards in 
Baghdad suburbs and army depots in and around the capital, the London-based 
Al-Hayat newspaper reported Wednesday. Iraqi newspapers, meanwhile, 
carried further accounts of comments by Deputy Prime Minister Tariq 
Aziz in Moscow in which he said there is a limit to Iraq's cooperation 
with the United Nations in the search for weapons of mass destruction. 
State-run newspapers first quoted Aziz's statements on his Russian 
trip Tuesday. ``This situation is no longer acceptable,'' Aziz said, 
referring to the U.N. sanctions that have blocked free export of Iraq's 
oil. The Special Commission must certify Iraq has eliminated its chemical, 
biological and nuclear weapons as well as long-range missiles before 
the sanctions can be lifted. The sanctions, imposed after the 1990 
Iraqi invasion of Kuwait, have devastated Iraq's oil-based economy, 
and Iraqi officials have long insisted they have fulfilled their obligations 
under U.N. resolutions and that the sanctions should be lifted. The 
arms inspectors _ who insist Iraq could still be hiding weapons _ 
have been a constant source of confrontation between Iraq and the 
United Nations. In the latest flare-up, Iraq blocked surprise visits 
by the inspectors for three months. They were only allowed to return 
in mid-November under threat of U.S. and British air strikes to force 
compliance. On Wednesday, the Iraqi press praised U.N. Secretary-General 
Kofi Annan's statement that a military attack against any country 
must have approval of the Security Council. Babil, the newspaper owned 
by Saddam's son Odai, said Annan's speech to the French Parliament 
on Tuesday means that ``the United States must realize its days of 
domination are numbered now.'' In an apparent reference to NATO, Annan 
said that regional organizations have an important world role, but 
``any military intervention by the international community must be 
approved by the Security Council.'' However, in an interview published 
Tuesday, U.S. Secretary of State Madeleine Albright said the NATO 
alliance ``cannot be hostage of a veto of this or that country against 
an operation.'' ``Because in such a case,'' she told the French daily 
Le Monde, ``NATO would be nothing more than a branch of the United 
Nations.''
