President Clinton will announce Thursday the creation of an early-warning 
center to focus U.S. intelligence resources on uncovering potential 
genocide and a large increase in funding for programs to stop child 
labor around the world, senior administration officials said Wednesday. 
Clinton will also sign an executive order to press the bureaucracy 
to carry out U.S. obligations under human rights treaties that currently 
lack implementing legislation; announce new immigration guidelines 
to allow children to more easily claim political asylum; and promise 
modest new aid to help nongovernmental organizations respond faster 
to humanitarian emergencies. The initiatives are part of the U.S. 
effort to commemorate Human Rights Day. Thursday is the 50th anniversary 
of the adoption by the United Nations General Assembly of the Universal 
Declaration of Human Rights, and Clinton will also announce a new 
annual award for Americans who have furthered the cause of human rights 
at home and abroad. The early warning center for genocide will be 
based at the State Department, in the intelligence and research division, 
and will include CIA officers, the officials said. At the same time, 
the National Intelligence Council is trying to develop indicators 
for genocide to avoid new horrors like those between the Hutu and 
Tutsi in Africa. But numerous critics of administration policy have 
said that the early inaction of U.S. and Western officials in the 
mass killings in Rwanda and Bosnia stemmed less from ignorance than 
from an unwillingness to commit troops and resources to the problem. 
The awards are named after Eleanor Roosevelt, one of first lady Hillary 
Rodham Clinton's heroes, who was instrumental in the passing of the 
Universal Declaration. The policy initiatives will also provide $30 
million a year, up from $3 million, to the program of the International 
Labor Organization to abolish child labor, and provide up to $8 million 
over several years to help private human rights organizations send 
assessment teams and monitors and hire local organizations to respond 
to human rights emergencies. The president will also announce a new 
group, to be chaired from the White House, to promote U.S. compliance 
with human rights treaties despite widely differing laws _ on treatment 
of children, for example _ in different states.
