And also in Washington today there was a ceremony for a war hero, 
a Moon who stayed the course despite hardship and shameful discrimination. 
For 85-year-old Benjamin Davis, today a historic promotion. A four 
star general in the U.S. air force. On behalf of all Americans, I 
thank you. In 1936, the first black to graduate from west point. Later, 
when the air force changed its policies allowing blacks to fly, davis 
dreamed to be a pilot came true. He would go on to command his first 
black unit, the world renowned tuskegee airmen. Today, fellow airmen 
at his side, a fourth star from a grateful nation.
