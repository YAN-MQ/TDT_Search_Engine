Rep. Ray LaHood, R-Ill., is to preside next week in the speaker's 
chair when the full House debates articles of impeachment against 
President Clinton. LaHood was picked by the outgoing speaker, Newt 
Gingrich, whose aides asked LaHood on Monday whether he wanted the 
job. Republican aides said Gingrich did not want to end his four-year 
tenure by presiding over what is expected to be a highly divisive 
debate, and that the incoming speaker, Rep. Bob Livingston, R-La., 
did not want his tenure to begin on that note. LaHood, 53, a former 
high school teacher and counselor to delinquent teen-agers, has a 
reputation for fairness that Republican leaders hope will translate 
into a calming influence on the proceedings and will help give the 
party an aura of even-handedness. He has not indicated how he would 
vote on impeachment. Although he was elected to the House only four 
years ago with the Republican rebel class of 1994, LaHood has not 
been associated with the rebels. He was one of three of the new freshmen 
who did not sign Gingrich's Contract With America. He also helped 
organize a bipartisan House retreat in Hershey, Pa., last year to 
help members get to know each other better and treat each other with 
more civility. In addition, LaHood has presided in the speaker's chair 
perhaps more often than any other Republican in recognition of his 
knowledge on procedure, said his spokesman, Tim Butler. He accepts 
the assignments willingly. ``He views it as a high honor,'' Butler 
said. ``This will be one of the most momentous votes taken in this 
century.'' LaHood is in a seat once held by Everett McKinley Dirksen 
and Bob Michel, both former Republican leaders. He is the grandson 
of an immigrant from Lebanon and the son of a restaurant manager. 
After teaching in Catholic schools for six years and working as a 
counselor, he served as Michel's chief of staff in Washington.
