It was another bad day between Palestinians and Israelis on the West 
Bank, making a lot of people doubly nervous just days before President 
Clinton is scheduled to arrive. ABC's Gillian Findlay is in ram allah 
tonight. In virtually every West Bank city today, the stones of palestinian 
demonstrators were met with Israeli gunfire. It was almost impossible 
to imagine that the two sides had signed a peace agreement less than 
two months ago. In Ramallah, in Bethlehem, in Nablus, the clashes 
went on for hours. Among the casualties, a 17-year-old boy, killed 
by Israeli soldiers using live ammunition. The pressure has been building 
for weeks. Nearly every demonstration now is about one issue -- the 
release of as many as 2,000 Palestinian prisoners from Israeli jails. 
To Palestinians they are heroes, young men jailed for resisting the 
Israeli occupation, sometimes violently. There is hardly a Palestinian 
family that does not have a son, a nephew, a Cousin among them. Israel 
calls these prisoners terrorists. Israel did release 250 prisoners 
recently, but they were not the political prisoners. Most were common 
criminals, drug addicts and car thieves. Palestinians feel cheated. 
And they say they will keep returning to the streets until the prisoners 
are freed. Not good news for the people planning President Clinton's 
visit. Tonight, the anger is growing. The Palestinians now have a 
new martyr they will bury tomorrow and that could bring more violence. 
Gillian Findlay, Ramallah.
