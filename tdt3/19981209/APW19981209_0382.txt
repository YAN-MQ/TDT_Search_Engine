Indonesia on Wednesday denied reports that it might quit the Organization 
of Petroleum Exporting Countries because of the group's failure to 
stem falling oil prices. ``No, we're not going to quit OPEC,'' Mines 
and Energy Minister Kuntoro Mangusubroto told reporters. The official 
Antara news agency reported Tuesday that Indonesia might leave OPEC 
in light of the cartel's inability to stabilize the global oil market. 
``After taking certain things into consideration, Indonesia has decided 
it may quit OPEC,'' Antara quoted Rachmat Sudibyo, a senior official 
at the Mines and Energy Ministry, as saying. However, Kuntoro said 
Sudibyo's alleged comments ``must have been a slip of the tongue.'' 
Indonesia is enduring its worst economic crisis in more than 30 years 
and oil and gas production is regarded as crucial to its chances of 
recovery. Sudibyo reportedly accused OPEC of lacking discipline. Almost 
every member state wasn't sticking to agreed production cuts, resulting 
in over supply and falling prices, Antara quoted him as saying. Sudibyo 
added, however, that because Indonesia would face negative consequences 
if it left the group, it would first continue discussions with other 
OPEC members about production quota compliance. An agreement among 
OPEC and non-OPEC oil nations in June called for the withdrawal of 
more than 3.1 million barrels a day from international markets in 
an attempt to boost prices. However, despite the agreement, oil prices 
have continued to languish at low levels not seen for more than a 
decade. Recent industry surveys show that OPEC compliance with its 
output pact is failing. Indonesia, OPEC's only Asian member, can currently 
export 1.28 million barrels a day under OPEC guidelines. Kuntoro has 
previously said that Indonesia was sticking to its production allocation, 
and said he would like to see the June production cuts extended through 
1999. The oil cartel is set to meet again in March. Kuntoro said last 
week that he expected the next meeting to come up with a new agreement 
to help boost prices.
