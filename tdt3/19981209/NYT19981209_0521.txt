As protests go, it was one of the more tuneful. For an hour Wednesday, 
a swing band held forth from behind police barricades outside The 
New York Times on West 43rd Street, rallying cabaret stars, Lindy 
hoppers and perhaps 75 other ardent fans in support of WQEW (1560-AM), 
New York City's only station devoted to American popular standards. 
The New York Times Co., which owns the station and took over the format 
from WNEW-AM in 1992, said last week that it would lease WQEW at year's 
end to ABC Inc. for eight years of children's programming by Radio 
Disney. ``We don't want swing to get lost in the shuffle,'' said George 
Gee, who with six members of his 17-piece ``Make Believe Ballroom 
Orchestra,'' belted out ``Take the A Train,'' ``Satin Doll'' and ``In 
the Mood.'' Singer Susannah McCorkle credited WQEW and WNEW with boosting 
her career. ``People need to know how great this music is,'' she said 
as she was joined by Kathleen Landis, who accompanies herself on the 
piano at the Cafe Pierre. ``This is my music, music created in New 
York City,'' Ms. Landis said. ``If no one speaks up it could be lost.'' 
Daryl Sherman, who accompanies herself on Cole Porter's piano at the 
cocktail terrace of the Waldorf-Astoria, said the pending loss of 
the station left her bereft. ``You turn on that radio, it's like having 
another person in your house,'' Ms. Sherman said. A spokeswoman for 
the Times Co., Lisa Carparelli, said that while station supporters 
were within their rights to protest, ``We have a responsibility to 
make prudent business decisions to insure the success of the company 
in what became a very competitive market, and sometimes this requires 
difficult trade-offs like the one we made about WQEW.'' Under the 
deal, ABC has the right to buy the station after the eight-year lease. 
The two parties did not provide the financial details but one executive 
valued the package at about $40 million. The Times Co.'s other station, 
WQXR-FM (96.3), is not affected. Most of the protesters described 
themselves as ordinary listeners devoted to the format. ``I listen 
when I wake up and when I go to sleep,'' said Howard Samara, 62, an 
advertising man who showed up in a black T-shirt with the legend ``Swing.'' 
Susan Teltser-Schwarz, 61, said she treasured the WNEW and WQEW memorabilia 
that she had collected over the years. Without the station, she said, 
``there'll be nothing for the grannies to dance to in their kitchens.'' 
The protest was organized by Bruce Cohen, a public relations man representing 
Gee's swing orchestra. Taking photos outside the police barricades 
he said, ``Not exactly a day of rage.'' Asked by a police officer 
if he anticipated ``any civil disturbance,'' Cohen said, ``We might 
up the tempo from time to time.''
