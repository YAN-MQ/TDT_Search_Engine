I'm meteorologist Dave Hennen with your "CNN Headline News Weather." 
Temperatures today remain cool in much of the west. Even the southwest 
will continue to see the chilly temperatures. In the Rockies, highs 
will only be the 20s. And the eastern seaboard has cooled off as well. 
That front making its way through. So, temperatures back to near normal 
for this time of year. Forecast weather map shows high pressure in 
the west. You'll see some Santa Ana conditions in southern California 
today, so windy weather from there into the southwest. Look for showers 
and storms to be most likely in Texas, and heading in through the 
southern Mississippi river valley over the next 24 hours, as a New 
system by tomorrow pushes into the pacific northwest. The extended 
forecast on Friday, most of the wet weather along the gulf coast, 
into the southeast. Rain is expected in the pacific northwest, as 
temperatures remain cool over most of the country. On into Saturday, 
rain and thunderstorms in the southeast once again. Look for temperatures 
to begin to warm up a bit in the southwestern U.S. and by Sunday, 
that warming trend spreads over much of the south, as the showers 
begin to diminish in the southeast, but continue in the pacific northwest.
