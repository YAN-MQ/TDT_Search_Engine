In two signs that the global economic crisis is easing, South Korea 
said Wednesday that it was immediately paying back nearly $3 billion 
in emergency loans that kept it afloat last year, and China successfully 
raised $1 billion from foreign investors. The South Korean move was 
a sign that the country, still deep in recession, now felt confident 
enough to draw down its reserves to repay the International Monetary 
Fund. The Chinese move to raise money on Wall Street _ with a bond 
offering that was in such demand that the country raised twice as 
much money as had been expected _ made it the first emerging-market 
economy in Asia to issue international bonds since the Russian default 
in August. Neither event by itself is evidence that the crises are 
over. But both are indicators that investors around the world take 
into account when they decide when a panic is over, whether, in short, 
it is safe to go back in the water. The IMF, which has been desperate 
to declare a restoration of confidence in the markets, immediately 
seized on the South Korean repayment as a sign that the country had 
hit bottom. IMF managing director Michel Camdessus called the repayment 
an ``important watershed in the process of Korea's emergence from 
last year's foreign-exchange crisis.'' The bailout of South Korea, 
which the fund led, totaled $58 billion. The country drew on just 
part of that to meet its obligations this year. China's move, raising 
money that a country with $144 billion in foreign reserves really 
does not need, was a sign that investors still hungered to invest 
there, despite continuing risks elsewhere in Asia. When the offering 
was priced Wednesday, China had to pay investors an interest rate 
only 2.8 percent higher than the U.S. Treasury pays on 10-year Treasury 
securities. The 10-year note was set to yield 7.346 percent. ``At 
this moment, if China can indicate that our economy has the resilience 
to withstand external shocks we can also help boost confidence with 
the region,'' Deputy Finance Minister Jin Liqun said in a telephone 
interview Wednesday from the New York headquarters of Goldman, Sachs 
&AMP; Co., the lead underwriter of the offering along with Credit 
Suisse First Boston. To persuade investors to return to Asia, Jin 
made extensive presentations Tuesday in New York about Chinese prospects, 
arguing that China had weathered the worst of the storm. China is 
an exception. It has fixed the exchange rate of its yuan against the 
dollar, and Jin repeatedly said Wednesday that ``we certainly are 
committed to maintaining the value of our currency,'' though did not 
specify for how long. The solidity of the implicit guarantee is important 
to investors, who saw Thailand, South Korea and Indonesia end similar 
commitments last year.
