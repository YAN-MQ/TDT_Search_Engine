After a day of rest, two astronauts aboard the space shuttle "endeavour" 
are conducting another space walk at this hour. Jerry Ross and James 
Newman are attaching two 100-pound antennas to each side of unity 
-- the American-made part of the international space station. The 
space walk should take seven hours. Connecting the antennas will allow 
the crew of the space station to communicate with their colleagues 
on earth. Stay tuned to "CNN Headline News" for the latest on the 
space walk.
