President-elect Hugo Chavez said Wednesday he was ``completely sure'' 
Washington would reverse its policy of banning him from the United 
States. Local stocks soared after his election, he said, because ``we 
have demonstrated to the world that we are not savages.'' The Caracas 
stock exchange opened sharply higher for the second straight day Wednesday, 
continuing a rally caused by Chavez's conciliatory statements after 
his landslide victory Sunday. The market was up 11.4 percent Wednesday 
morning, following a record 22 percent hike the previous day. Investors 
had long feared Chavez, who as an army officer in 1992 staged an unsuccessful 
coup attempt, would roll back free market economic reforms and civil 
liberties. But his statements in the last two days promising fiscal 
discipline and calling for national reconciliation have calmed investor 
fears, for now. Speaking to reporters Wednesday after meeting with 
President Rafael Caldera, Chavez, 44, said the stock market rally 
reflected Venezuelans peaceful vote for change. ``There is a fresh 
breeze,'' he said. ``We have broken our chains.'' He said he met earlier 
Wednesday with U.S. Ambassador John Maisto, who he said delivered 
a letter of congratulations from President Bill Clinton. Because of 
his coup attempt, Chavez was placed on a U.S. list of alien undesirables 
barred from entering the United States. In recent days, U.S. officials 
have to moved to improve relations with Chavez, whose country is the 
number one exporter of oil to the United States. ``I am completely 
sure that within a few weeks I will be in the United States,'' Chavez 
said. On Monday, State Department spokesman James Foley said that 
heads of state normally receive a diplomatic visa to visit the United 
States, adding, ``The U.S. government is prepared to take the necessary 
steps to address any request for a visa that President-elect Chavez 
may make.'' During his press conference Wednesday, Chavez reiterated 
his plans to root out corruption, review the country's oil policies 
and call a constituent assembly to rewrite the constitution. ``The 
country voted for transformation and now there is no turning back,'' 
he said.
