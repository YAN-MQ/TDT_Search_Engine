Gunmen have shot and wounded an American working in Yemen while trying 
to hijack his car, a security official said Wednesday. Richard Boney, 
a development worker, was attacked by three assailants Tuesday night 
as he parked in front of his home in the southern province of Shabwa, 
530 kilometers (329 miles) southeast of the capital San`a, the official 
said. One of the men got into the passenger seat and attempted to 
steal the car keys. When Boney punched him and pushed him out of the 
car, the man's accomplices opened fire. Boney collapsed on to the 
steering wheel, bleeding heavily, and the assailants fled, the security 
official said. Police are searching for the attackers. Boney was working 
as an administrator on a Dutch agricultural development program, said 
the official. The American and Dutch embassies have refused to comment 
on the incident. Boney underwent an 80 minute operation on his arm 
Tuesday evening and received one and a half liters (3.15 pints) of 
blood, said an official at the al-Hikma hospital in Shabwa. Boney 
was in stable condition Wednesday, but still in the hospital's intensive 
care unit, said the official, speaking on condition of anonymity. 
Boney drove a four-wheel drive car, a vehicle that is highly prized 
in Yemen, one of the poorest nations in the Arab world.
