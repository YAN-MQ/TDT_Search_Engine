It's the kind of discovery that only comes once in a blue Moon. Anthropologists 
are thrilled by the recent discovery of an ancient skeleton in south 
Africa. Mike Hanna reports, it could shed new light on the origin 
of humans. In a cave west of Johannesburg, a critical clue to the 
origins of the human species. Here, three researchers from the University 
of the witwatersrand have discovered a skeleton estimated to be some 
3.5 million years old. I go so far as to claim that Clarke's, molefe's 
and motsuimi's discovery is the most significant find ever made in 
south Africa since the original discovery of the taung child in 1924. 
Probably, it is the most momentous paleo-anthropological find ever 
made in africa. For the researchers, it was five years of intense 
anthropological detective work, culminating in a moment, when one 
bone fitted another and a Jigsaw of fossils fell into place. I found 
that that fitted onto another piece of bone that was sticking out 
next to it. And this fibula was also visible there. Now, this was 
remarkable, because this was the left lower leg and foot, and this 
was the right leg. And they were side by side face down. And I thought, 
"my goodness, we must have the whole skeleton here." With an entire 
skeleton, rather than bits and pieces of bone, scientists will be 
able to investigate exactly how the hominid functioned. And the remains 
of what was once a four-foot or 1.2-meter tall person could prove 
a critical component in finding what has eluded researchers for decades, 
what they call the missing link in our evolution from ape to human.
