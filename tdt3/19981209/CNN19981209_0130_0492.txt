This is Orelon Sidney with your "CNN Headline News Weather" update. 
Snow showers will be seen in the Rockies by Wednesday morning, as 
rain showers linger in the east. One cold front moves through Nova 
Scotia, continuing to drag across portions of Florida. Cooler temperatures 
are due into the eastern United States. Also watch a front move through 
the Great Lakes, trailing down into Mexico, with increasing showers 
for the western gulf coast states. The northeast gets a little bit 
of a break as the northwest sees another storm system head in from 
the pacific. Rain and snow will be in the forecast as early as Thursday. 
Temperatures will be in the 20s and 30s for most of the Rockies, with 
40s, 50s and 60s along the pacific coast. 50s and better southward 
from cape hatteras, with temperatures in the northeast staying in 
the 30s and the 40s. The extended forecast includes rain Thursday 
for the northwest, with flurries across the Great Lakes. A few thunderstorms 
could be seen in the gulf. Thunderstorms move eastward through Friday, 
with snowfall expected for the lakes. And we keep a few showers in 
the south into Saturday. The extended forecast for more than 7,000 
cities is at CNN.com.
