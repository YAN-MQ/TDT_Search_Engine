The New York Times said in an editorial for Thursday, Dec. 10: By 
turning international weapons inspectors away from the headquarters 
of its ruling party Wednesday, Iraq showed why the U.N. Security Council 
should make no move toward lifting economic sanctions. Secretary of 
State Madeleine Albright was right to warn promptly that Washington 
will hold up any review of Iraq's status until Baghdad honors its 
pledge of unhindered access for the weapons investigators. The surprise 
inspections that began Tuesday, in which U.N. specialists look for 
hidden materials and records with little advance notification, are 
particularly important. Iraq is seeking a review not only of arms 
issues but also its record in other areas, like returning Kuwaiti 
prisoners and property. Baghdad is hoping for some recognition of 
overall progress and a narrowing of the requirements to win relief 
from sanctions. The country has done little to merit a favorable report. 
Its record on arms, as reported in October by the U.N. inspection 
chief, Richard Butler, is poor to mixed. There are large gaps in Iraq's 
ability to account for the supplies of VX nerve gas, anthrax bacteria 
and botulinum toxin it was known to possess before the Persian Gulf 
War. On non-weapons issues, Iraq has done even less to meet obligations 
that were supposed to have been fulfilled more than seven years ago. 
Wednesday's incident was perfectly consistent with Saddam Hussein's 
seven-year record of obstruction. Iraq has permitted routine inspections 
since the most recent crisis eased last month, but it has rebuffed 
requests for relevant documents and now looks to limit surprise visits. 
Saddam never ceases to hunt for ways to divide the Security Council 
in hopes that he can limit inspections while winning relief from sanctions. 
The two goals are incompatible. The only route to lifting sanctions 
is full cooperation with inspections.
