This look at your "CNN Headline News Weather" begins with our forecast 
weather map for tomorrow morning. Windy conditions will continue in 
parts of the southwest. We've been seeing wind warnings and wind advisories 
all day long in this area. They're associated with the passing of 
a frontal boundary that by tomorrow morning will stretch from the 
Great Lakes area down to Texas. We'll see the threat of rain showers 
and thunderstorms in the lone star state and some snowfall in the 
extreme southern Rockies. As far as high temperatures are concerned 
tomorrow, still quite cool in parts of the west and the upper midwest, 
but it remains relatively warm in the southeast and in southern California. 
Your extended forecast calls for rain and thunderstorms to spread 
along the gulf coast as we go through the day on Friday. Heading on 
through the weekend, we're going to see rain and thunderstorm activity 
along the southeastern coast and through Florida, the next storm rolling 
in through the northwest. And on Sunday, snow showers are possible 
in the New England states. For more weather information, log on to
