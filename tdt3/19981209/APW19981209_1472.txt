Diplomacy aimed at resolving the conflict in Kosovo is ``still on 
track,'' the top U.S. envoy for the troubled province insisted Wednesday 
_ even though all sides in the dispute had rejected his latest peace 
proposal. Christopher Hill spoke after launching a new round of shuttle 
talks in the turbulent province, where the ethnic Albanian majority 
seeks independence from Serbian rule. An October truce that halted 
months of combat between the separatist Kosovo Liberation Army rebels 
and Serb forces is largely holding. But many expect fighting to resume 
by spring if a political settlement is not reached. Frequent shootings 
have marred the shaky peace _ the latest a report of attacks by gunmen 
on two Serb police patrols Wednesday that injured two policeman. Hill, 
returning to the region from Washington, met for several hours Wednesday 
with ethnic Albanian negotiators in Pristina. He planned to meet later 
with a political representative of the KLA. He has talks Thursday 
in Belgrade with Serb authorities, who formally rejected the latest 
U.S. peace plan draft on Wednesday. ``We believe that our negotiations 
are still on track,'' Hill, who also is U.S. ambassador to neighboring 
Macedonia, told reporters. ``Ultimately the responsibility of reaching 
a settlement rests with both sides,'' he said. ``They need to find 
ways to compromise.'' Both Hill and Wolfgang Petritsch, the European 
Union envoy for Kosovo who joined in the talks, cited the urgency 
of trying to reach a settlement soon in order to head off new fighting. 
Petritsch said ``something should be achieved in the next couple of 
weeks.'' ``This is a very decisive point in time,'' he said. ``We 
mustn't lose the momentum.'' But based on their public statements, 
the gulf between the sides appears huge. Hill admitted ``it's not 
an easy process.'' Ethnic Albanian officials insist on a solution 
that would break Kosovo away from Serbian control, while the KLA has 
said it won't accept anything short of outright independence. Senior 
Serbian officials back a Serb peace plan that keeps the province firmly 
within the republic. Serb negotiator Ratko Markovic said the U.S. 
draft would require ``reconstructing the whole of Yugoslavia'' and 
lead to independence for Kosovo. Kosovo, where ethnic Albanians comprise 
about 90 percent of a population of 2 million, had autonomy until 
then-Serbian President Slobodan Milosevic revoked it in 1989. After 
KLA rebels began attacking the police forces that maintain a massive 
presence in the province, Serbian forces launched a crackdown last 
February that killed hundreds of people and uprooted an estimated 
300,000 from their homes. Periodic violence has continued. The pro-government 
Serb Media Center said Albanian gunmen attacked police patrols Wednesday 
near the village of Dolovo in western Kosovo and Opterusa in the southwest. 
Two policemen were hospitalized after the Dolovo attack.
