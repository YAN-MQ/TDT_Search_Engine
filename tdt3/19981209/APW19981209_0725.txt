Prime Minister Yevgeny Primakov is the most trusted politician in 
Russia, but even more Russians trust no politicians at all, a poll 
released Wednesday indicated. More than one-third of respondents in 
the poll said they did not trust any political leaders, and another 
14 percent were undecided. Among the rest, 24 percent said they trusted 
Primakov, according to a poll conducted in November by the All-Russian 
Center for Public Opinion Research, known by its Russian acronym of 
VTSIOM. People were allowed to name more than one politician they 
trust. Primakov was followed by Communist leader Gennady Zyuganov, 
who was trusted by 20 percent, according to the poll, carried by the 
Interfax news agency. Primakov's rating had nearly doubled since he 
was appointed in September, and Zyuganov's was up from 17 percent 
in a September poll by the same agency. Prominent liberal lawmaker 
Grigory Yavlinsky was trusted by 17 percent in the November poll, 
a figure unchanged from September. Yavlinsky has a loyal following, 
but has trouble expanding it because his market reform ideas have 
little appeal to many Russians who are desperate for a stable paycheck. 
Alexander Lebed, former national security chief who is now governor 
of a vast Siberian region, was trusted by 17 percent, up from 14 percent 
in September. Moscow Mayor Yuri Luzhkov was trusted by 16 percent 
of the respondents, up from 14 percent in September, the poll said. 
Zyuganov, Lebed, Luzhkov and Yavlinsky are widely expected to run 
in the next presidential elections. Primakov has denied any presidential 
ambitions. Nearly a dozen other politicians scored in the single digits. 
The report did not indicate whether President Boris Yeltsin was named 
in the poll. The poll of 2,409 people had a margin of error of 2 percentage 
points.
