All the labors of high-priced lawyering that have marked the struggle 
to impeach and defend President Clinton seemed to converge before 
the House Judiciary Committee on Wednesday in a clash that, at a minimum, 
showed no lack of combative lawyers. Rep. Bob Barr was suddenly seething 
at the latest panel of distinguished lawyers to testify at the impeachment 
inquiry _ thoroughly disgusted, he announced, with all the lawyers 
who have been wielding all the ``evasive and crafty answers'' in defense 
of the president. ``We really have gone, Mr. Chairman, today from 
the technical to the absurd,'' growled the Georgia Republican, a lawyer 
and former federal prosecutor himself who fervidly proposed the impeachment 
of Clinton months before Kenneth Starr urged Congress to do so. In 
an instant, lawyers and legalisms were on the mat as Barr and other 
Republican lawmakers, most of them lawyers, fumed about ``legal hairsplitting'' 
from evasive ``wordsmiths'' of the bar. ``Shame on you!'' Barr boomed 
at Gregory Craig, the president's special counsel who shepherded the 
panel of five experienced federal prosecutors before the committee 
to argue that the perjury case against the president would never be 
brought against an ordinary American by any self-respecting criminal 
prosecutor. ``It wouldn't get in the door,'' said Thomas Sullivan, 
a former federal prosecutor whom Barr dressed down as particularly 
talented in the ``technicalities and legalities'' of criminal defense. 
Sullivan had to sit mute since Barr afforded him no opportunity to 
defend himself. But he showed professional resilience as soon as a 
friendly Democrat invited him to speak. ``Persons who make such statements,'' 
Sullivan said of Barr, are the first to hire a lawyer and ``get the 
mantle of the Constitution wrapped around them'' when they are the 
subjects of criminal investigation. ``You don't hear that kind of 
speech from them anymore when they hire me to defend them, I can guarantee 
you that,'' Sullivan declared evenly, leaning into the microphone 
as it was Barr's turn to glare back in silence. The hearing day was 
largely devoted to lawyers having it out in public even as backroom 
legal specialists of the Republican majority were busy writing draft 
articles of impeachment against Clinton. ``Works in progress,'' the 
committee chairman, Rep. Henry Hyde, noted rather lightly. Republicans 
chafed repeatedly at all the nuanced warnings against impeachment 
from the president's defenders, although one, Rep. Christopher Cannon 
of Utah, did gently concede, ``The essence of the rule of law lies 
in its technicalities.'' A note of lawyerly mischief came from Rep. 
Lindsey Graham, R-S.C., when the charges against the president were 
criticized as ``silly.'' ``The day that people stop doing silly stuff 
is the day all of us lawyers go out of business,'' said Graham to 
bipartisan laughter. ``I think it's silly to fool around with an intern 
while you're being sued. But these things happen. And they happen 
to smart people like Bill Clinton. And if we impeach people for being 
silly and doing inappropriate things we'll wipe the Congress out.'' 
No apologies for legal niceties were offered by Charles Ruff, the 
White House counsel, as he fenced with Republicans. He firmly preferred 
the word ``misleading'' to ``lying'' in describing the president's 
misbehavior. The president did not commit perjury, Ruff insisted, 
when he ``succeeded in misleading the opposing counsel'' in the Paula 
Jones sexual misconduct suit. Frowning at the president's admitted 
evasions, Rep. Ed Bryant, R-Tenn., complained: ``I think it's sick 
that the president does this.'' But Rep. Maxine Waters, D-Calif., 
offered a fast riposte to all queasy Republicans: ``Just because they're 
sickened by his actions does not mean they're impeachable.'' Ruff 
openly wondered about ``legalisms.'' ``Whatever they are, they have 
caused a great deal of pain to those of us engaged in trying to represent 
the president over the last many months,'' he conceded while insisting 
legalisms are also the basic stuff of defending a client's innocence. 
``I am worried here not about whether lawyers will ultimately recover 
from these attacks,'' Ruff told the lawyers on the committee amid 
all the clashing over lawyering. ``I am worried that our sometimes 
irresistible urge to practice our profession will stand in the way 
of securing a just result in this very grave proceeding for this very 
special client.''
