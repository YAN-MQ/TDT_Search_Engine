An 18-year-old American-born Palestinian charged with membership in 
an Islamic militant group went on trial Wednesday in an Israeli military 
court. Hashem Mufleh's lawyer argued that the crimes his client are 
accused of would not hold in the United States where Mufleh would 
be protected by the Fifth Amendment. Israel and the Palestinian Authority, 
as part of the U.S.-brokered peace accords have been cracking down 
on Hamas, the group which opposes peace and has carried out deadly 
attacks against Israel. As part of such measures, Israel arrested 
Mufleh, who has lived with his mother for 16 years in the Palestinian-run 
West Bank city of Ramallah, in August as he tried to board a flight 
to the United States to attend college in Gallup, New Mexico, where 
his father lives. A few days after Mufleh's arrest, the U.S. State 
Department protested his detention, his interrogation and the conditions 
under which he was being kept. His family said that because of the 
intervention of U.S. officials in Israel, Mufleh's prison conditions 
have improved. ``It's ironic that Americans are getting Palestinians 
to crack down on Hamas and they totally support these military orders 
and military courts and then they find an American citizen who is 
being arrested and held without bail, basically for practicing American 
freedoms,'' Kuttab said. At his trial in an Israeli military court 
in Beit El, West Bank, he was accused of membership in Hamas, throwing 
a stone and other objects at moving Israeli vehicles, distributing 
Hamas leaflets and participating in a demonstration commemorating 
Hamas bomb-maker Mohyedin Sharif, who was killed in an explosion earlier 
this year. Wearing a Miami Dolphins T-shirt, glasses, and dark Nike 
basketball shoes, Mufleh counted Muslim prayer beads as he listened 
to the Arabic translation of the proceedings, which were conducted 
in Hebrew. ``I'm not involved with Hamas. I'm religious. I'm a Muslim,'' 
he told The Associated Press. Two Israeli policemen testified that 
Mufleh had confessed of his own free will but Kuttab claimed the confession 
was ``extracted under torture.'' Moshe Levy, a police officer who 
took down Mufleh's statement after he was questioned by interrogators 
from Israel's Shin Bet security agency, said Mufleh did not appear 
to have been ill-treated. ``As far as I remember he looked fine. I 
don't remember seeing any marks on him,'' Levy told the court. His 
mother, Itaf Mufleh said ``He studied the Koran and prayer. Does that 
mean he belongs to Hamas?'' Kuttab argued that the Mufleh's actions 
would have been legal in the United States and would be protected 
under the Constitution. Kuttab's request to release his client on 
bail was denied two weeks ago by a military judge. Last month several 
Arab American and human rights groups launched a campaign to press 
for Mufleh's release.
