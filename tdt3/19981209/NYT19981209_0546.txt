Playing the white knight, Cadence Design Systems Inc. agreed Wednesday 
to acquire Quickturn Design Systems Inc., which has been the subject 
of a hostile takeover bid by the Mentor Graphics Corp. Cadence said 
it would swap stock worth $14 a share, a total of $253 million, for 
Quickturn. Mentor had bid $12.13 a share in cash, but its offer was 
rebuffed by Quickturn, which has been battling the deal in the Delaware 
courts. Mentor said Wednesday that it was reviewing its options in 
light of the competing offer. Cadence's shares closed at $29.1875, 
down 81.25 cents on the New York Stock Exchange. Quickturn's shares 
closed at $13.8125, up $1.625, and Mentor's shares at $8.75, down 
$1.25, both in NASDAQ trading. Cadence, based in San Jose, Calif., 
and Mentor, based in Wilsonville, Ore., are bitter rivals in the market 
for the electronic automated design software used to fashion new chips. 
Quickturn is a leader in the related market for specialized computers 
that can emulate a new chip design before it is crafted in silicon, 
providing a kind of virtual verification that the circuitry will work 
as intended. Mentor acquired a small French company with an emulation 
and verification product last year, but cannot market it in the United 
States because of a court order stemming from a patent-infringement 
suit by Quickturn. That suit comes to trial in Oregon in February. 
Mentor originally proposed the merger as a friendly deal that could 
put an end to the litigation, but the offer was spurned by Keith R. 
Lobo, Quickturn's president and chief executive.
