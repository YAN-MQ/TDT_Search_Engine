Computer chipmaker Intel is licensing its Pentium processor design 
to the energy department. Intel isn't collecting royalties for the 
deal, which will aid in the development of custom-made, radiation-proof 
processors for space and defense purposes. The chips could increase 
processing power tenfold. Intel says the deal will save taxpayers 
$1 billion in development costs.
