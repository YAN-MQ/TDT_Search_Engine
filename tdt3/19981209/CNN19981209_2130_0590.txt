A major setback today for former Chilean dictator augusto Pinochet. 
Britain says Spain can begin proceedings to extradite him. British 
home secretary Jack straw issued the ruling today. The 83-year-old 
Pinochet is under house arrest in London. Spain wants to try him on 
charges of genocide, torture and kidnapping during his 17-year rule. 
The former general now faces months and possibly years of battles 
through british courts, fighting extradition.
