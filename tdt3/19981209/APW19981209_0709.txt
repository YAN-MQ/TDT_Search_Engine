Prime Minister Jerzy Buzek promised Wednesday that Poland would meet 
the minimum requirements necessary to join NATO prior to the Western 
alliance's summit in April. Poland and two other former Soviet bloc 
countries _ the Czech Republic and Hungary _ are scheduled to join 
NATO next year, and the summit in Washington celebrating the alliance's 
50th anniversary was considered the likely event for their addition. 
But the three now want to become formal NATO members before the summit 
so they can take part in formulating strategy and other matters at 
the April 24-25 meeting. NATO Secretary General Javier Solana has 
said all three still must meet unspecified minimum requirements before 
NATO will extend formal invitations. Buzek said Poland would fulfill 
what he called a ``few fundamental requirements'' for becoming a ``formal 
functioning'' NATO member by early February. He insisted Poland could 
meet all the requirements set by NATO prior to the April summit. While 
a full list of the changes Poland must make has been undisclosed, 
various NATO officials have indicated the major areas for improvement 
or compatibility with NATO systems and standards involve communications 
and air defense. In addition, Buzek's government has sent to parliament 
a proposed new law on classified information that would bring Poland's 
system for protecting secrets into conformance with NATO standards. 
Other Polish officials, including Defense Minister Janusz Onyszkiewicz, 
have said this week that Poland's military will make the necessary 
changes to meet NATO requirements before the April summit.
