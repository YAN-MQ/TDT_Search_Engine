Most Americans do not get a yearly flu shot. And many will pay the 
price -- a miserable week in bed. Doctors say, don't be fooled by 
myths that lead some people to skip the vaccine. Myth number one -- 
the flu shot causes the flu. In fact, it does not. A flu shot uses 
dead influenza virus that cannot make you sick. The vaccine works 
by prompting a response from the body's immune system, which sometimes 
causes an achy feeling. Another myth is that flu shots don't work. 
I think, in theory, that if you could vaccinate everybody each year, 
then you could potentially cut down on the transmission of this virus. 
The vaccine is particularly important for people who could suffer 
serious consequences from the flu -- such as the very young, the elderly 
and those with weakened immune systems. Only people allergic to eggs 
should be cautious. Most flu vaccines are made with eggs. For the
