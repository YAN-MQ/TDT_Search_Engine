Hoping to keep a lid on rising welfare costs as Hong Kong struggles 
through recession, the government announced proposals Wednesday to 
cut welfare payments and encourage recipients to perform volunteer 
work. Officials fear too much welfare spending could ``affect our 
long-term ability to finance other essential social services such 
as education, health and welfare services,'' said Katherine Fok, secretary 
for health and welfare. The government is facing a 13 billion Hong 
Kong dollar (U.S. dlrs 1.67 billion) welfare bill this year, a fivefold 
increase in as many years. With unemployment at a record 5.3 percent 
in the third quarter _ the highest since the territory began keeping 
unemployment statistics in 1981 _ and the economy mired in recession, 
the government worries it could see welfare applications increase 
even more sharply if reforms are not introduced. The proposals include 
cuts of up to 20 percent in payments to households with four or more 
able-bodied family members and incentives for finding a full-time 
job. The government pointed out that welfare payments for a four-person 
household can come to more than 10,000 Hong Kong dollars (U.S. dlrs 
1,282) a month, compared with the 5,000 Hong Kong dollar to 9,000 
Hong Kong dollar (U.S. dlrs 641 to U.S. dlrs 1,153) wages of many 
low-skilled jobs. Standard payments to those who can't help themselves 
_ the elderly, sick and people with disabilities _ would not be affected. 
The government also proposed requiring welfare recipients to do volunteer 
community work as a condition of receiving assistance. ``This will 
also give them an opportunity to contribute to society while preparing 
them for eventual gainful employment,'' the statement said. A six-week 
public consultation will be held before finalizing the package to 
be implemented several months later.
