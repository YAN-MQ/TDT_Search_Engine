The government should pay 48 million guilders (dlrs 25 million) to 
Dutch Jewish organizations as compensation for its insensitive treatment 
of Holocaust survivors after World War II, an independent commission 
said in a report published Wednesday. During the Nazi occupation of 
the Netherlands, Jews were forced to pay for the construction of two 
camps where they were held before being deported to death camps like 
Auschwitz and Bergen-Belsen. After the war, the government repaid 
only a fraction of the money. ``The (Dutch) camps ... were the gateways 
to camps like Auschwitz,'' said commission leader Frans Kordes. ``This 
must be put right.'' Jews also had to pay for the return of their 
stolen belongings from Germany, Kordes said as he presented his report 
to Dutch Finance Minister Gerrit Zalm. After the war ``there was not 
enough feeling shown for what these people had been through,'' Kordes 
said. His report described the treatment of returning Jews as ``inhumane.'' 
Zalm had no immediate comment on the sums of money involved, Dutch 
television news reported. A prominent Dutch Jewish group criticized 
the proposals for not going far enough. ``The problem is that individual 
claims are considered no longer valid,'' said Ronny Naftaniel, a spokesman 
for the Center for Information and Documentation on Israel. About 
three-quarters of Dutch Jews _ more than 100,000 people _ died in 
the Holocaust.
