Boris Yeltsin was released from a hospital today after more than two 
weeks of treatment for pneumonia. He moved to a secluded country residence 
outside the capital, the Kremlin said. The 67-year-old Yeltsin has 
rarely been seen or heard since he was admitted to the Central Clinical 
Hospital on Nov. 22. He appeared in the Kremlin for three hours Monday 
to fire several top aides and then returned to his hospital bed. Yeltsin's 
spokesman, Dmitry Yakushkin, said the president moved to the wooded 
Rus residence, 60 miles outside Moscow, for a ``convalescence period.'' 
``Doctors are generally satisfied with the president's condition,'' 
Yakushkin told the Interfax news agency, adding that Yeltsin will 
continue to receive ``periodic checkups at the hospital.'' Yeltsin 
did not have any meetings planned today and there was no word on when 
he might return to the Kremlin. Yeltsin insists he has no serious 
health problems, but after so many illnesses in recent years, few 
believe he will be able to maintain a normal working schedule. He 
has said almost nothing about Russia's economic crisis, which hit 
four months ago. However, Prime Minister Yevgeny Primakov, who is 
dealing with the economic turmoil, said Yeltsin can ``perfectly perform'' 
his duties and will ``work until the end of his term'' in 2000. His 
remarks were published today in the Nezavisimaya Gazeta newspaper. 
Primakov has handled many presidential duties in recent months, and 
he gathered his top ministers today to work out next year's budget. 
The president's latest illness clearly demonstrated that Yeltsin is 
not involved in the day-to-day running of the government, although 
he remains extremely sensitive to any suggestions that he is a lame 
duck, or that he won't serve out his term. The president's only major 
announcement during his illness was the dismissal of his aides, some 
of whom had dared to comment on his health problems. Russia remains 
in a deep recession, with the economy expected to shrink about 5 percent 
this year and forecasts pointing toward a similar contraction, if 
not worse, next year. Russia in the 1990s has suffered one of the 
worst depressions ever experienced by an industrial nation, and Yeltsin 
no longer even pretends to offer solutions to the country's entrenched 
problems.
