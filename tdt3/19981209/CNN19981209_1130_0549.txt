Police see Chicago's anti-loitering ordinance as a tool to cut gang 
activity. Activists see it as an unconstitutional attempt to incriminate 
innocent people. Today, the Supreme Court takes up the issue. Charles 
Bierbauer reports. Right now, the street's about money. Definitely 
about money. It's about drugs and money. That's a cop's view of Chicago's 
street gang problem. Here's a neighbor's view. The intimidation comes 
from when they crowd up, and you gotta walk around them, and had you 
get ready to drive out the block, they got their cars parked up there, 
and they won't move. To break up street gangs, Chicago adopted an 
anti-loitering ordinance in 1992. We need it. We want it. And the 
residents want us to have it. But the Illinois Supreme Court said 
Chicago could not have it. The court last year found the law unconstitutionally 
vague. We'd give them a warning, if they were known gang members. 
After they refused your warning to disperse, you pretty much would 
arrest them. And sometimes, anyone else hanging with a gang suspect. 
Luis guiterrez says he was no gang member, but was arrested on the 
block where his mother lives. We were searched. They found no weapons. 
They found no drugs. And then, we were handcuffed and told we were 
being arrested for, gang loitering. It sweeps so broadly across both 
persons associated with criminal activity, and people who have no 
relationship to crime whatsoever. Chicago police say the anti-loitering 
ban worked. The first year about 43,000 arrests was made. The gang 
drive-by homicides decreased significantly. There is no way to associate 
the use of the ordinance with any significant decreases in criminal 
activities. Police say it's just one tool they could use. You can 
go out every day and work a different spot. You'll never dry it up. 
Gangs are not just Chicago's problem. That's why the conference of 
mayors, the league of cities, state and federal governments have all 
appealed to the Supreme Court to reconsider and declare the anti-gang, 
anti-loitering ordinance constitutional. Charles Bierbauer, CNN, Chicago.
