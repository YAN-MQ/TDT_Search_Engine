While the committee discussed his future, it was business as usual 
for President Clinton Tuesday. He opened a special conference at the 
White House on social security's future. He urged republicans and 
democrats to begin the process of reforming the cash-strapped system 
by finding common ground and proceeding from there. I hope history 
will record that we seized this opportunity. Earlier this year, I 
said we should reserve any surplus until we save social security first. 
We have done so. We should take the next step and act now. It is more 
than an opportunity, it is a solemn responsibility. Later, the president 
and first lady flew to Nashville, Tennessee, for a Memorial service 
for Albert Gore Sr. the former U.S. senator and father of vice President 
Al Gore died Saturday at his Tennessee farm. He was 90. Mr. Clinton 
says the Elder Gore was "the embodiment of everything public service 
ought to be."
