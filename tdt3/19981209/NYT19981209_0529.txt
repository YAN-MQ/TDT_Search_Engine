The New York Times said in an editorial for Thursday., Dec. 10: Frank 
Sinatra's FBI dossier, opened seven months after his death, now makes 
it clear that some legends resist tarnish better than others. The 
bureau's tawdry collection of charges, gossip and weirdo conspiracy 
theories all stamped with dates and the official FBI seal might besmirch 
a more traditionally wholesome American superstar. But for one who 
has long been certified as an earlier generation's celebrity tough 
guy, how much does it hurt to hear that Frank Sinatra was not exactly 
Pat Boone? OK, so there are charges about shady associates and that 
he had, shall we say, an active social life, or even that he was a 
lefty who was ready, maybe, to rat on his lefty pals. Perhaps more 
interesting are the documents about the younger Sinatra, whose doings 
were not yet filtered through lawyers, agents or wives. His arrest 
in Bergen County, New Jersey, in 1938 was for the quaint old crime 
of seduction, a law no longer prosecuted in this country. The Sinatra 
mug shot at age 23, with its sultry pout, still exudes enough testosterone 
to snarl traffic in downtown Hackensack. The young Sinatra's encounter 
with the World War II military draft is even more intriguing. A letter 
passed along to the bureau from the gossip columnist Walter Winchell 
suggested that Sinatra had tried to evade the draft with a $40,000 
bribe. After investigating for four years, agents decided the charge 
was not true. They reported that the man with the golden larynx also 
had a chronically bad ear, not to mention ``mental instability.'' 
Specifically, the psychiatric examiner for the Jersey City draft board 
wrote that ``the patient stated that he was neurotic, afraid to be 
in crowds ... would want to run when surrounded by people.'' The man 
who sang ``It Was a Very Good Year'' and ``My Way'' had a hearing 
problem? The guy who J. Edgar Hoover feared could personally lead 
his thousands of screaming bobby-soxer fans straight into sin or to 
Moscow, this Pied Piper of the old Paramount, didn't like crowds? 
The explanations and possibilities are endless. So, maybe he sent 
a buddy. Maybe he faked it. Maybe he conned the shrink. Maybe the 
answer is not to focus on the FBI's records but on his.
