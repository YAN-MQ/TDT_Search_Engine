Today in Washington, President Clinton has private talks scheduled 
with lawmakers over the future of social security. White House officials 
say the discussions are just a warm-up for future negotiations. Yesterday, 
Mr. Clinton opened a two-day conference addressing the issue of how 
to deal with the up impending retirement of 75 million baby boomers 
in 2032. The program is expected to run short of money by then unless 
changes are made.
