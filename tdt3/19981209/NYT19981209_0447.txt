In a spirited Supreme Court argument Wednesday, the city of Chicago 
defended an anti-loitering law that permits arrests not only of suspected 
gang members but of anyone else who, standing with ``no apparent purpose'' 
on a public street near a gang member, defies a police order to move 
on. ``The Constitution does not protect the right to stand next to 
a gang member,'' Lawrence Rosenthal, Chicago's deputy corporation 
counsel, told the justices in what appeared to be an uphill battle 
to resurrect a 1992 city ordinance that has drawn widespread attention 
from around the country as a potential model for a new approach to 
gang violence. Tens of thousands of people were arrested under the 
law during the three years it was in effect before an Illinois appellate 
court declared it unconstitutional in 1995. Rosenthal said the law 
imposed ``at most a minimal inconvenience'' when compared to the ``enormous 
evils'' visited by gangs on terrified Chicago neighborhoods. Citing 
U.S. Supreme Court precedents, the Illinois Supreme Court ruled last 
year that the law was unconstitutionally vague, in failing to give 
``fair notice'' of what conduct was prohibited. The state court also 
said the law violated a number of other constitutional rights, including 
due process, the right to associate with others, and the ``personal 
liberty of being able to freely walk the streets.'' The city's appeal 
is one of the most important civil liberties cases of the Supreme 
Court term, questioning at least implicitly whether several Supreme 
Court decisions from the 1970s, which sent into eclipse the vagrancy 
and loitering laws that were once common in American cities, are still 
good laws. While there was little direct discussion of those precedents 
in the courtroom Wednesday, several justices expressed serious doubts 
about Chicago's approach. ``I'm bothered by the seemingly open-ended 
possibilities of what is and is not an `apparent purpose,''' Justice 
David H. Souter told Rosenthal. ``Some people with nothing better 
to do like to sit and watch the cars go by.'' Reflecting the high 
constitutional and practical stakes in this case, City of Chicago 
vs. Morales, No. 97-1121, the Clinton administration and 31 states 
filed briefs supporting Chicago, while a broad coalition of civil 
liberties and criminal defense groups are supporting the challengers. 
The law is ``inherently vague and overbroad,'' Harvey Grossman, an 
American Civil Liberties Union lawyer from Chicago, told the justices 
Wednesday. ``At its core it defines no conduct,'' he said of the law, 
adding that it ``requires a police officer to engage in a surreal 
exercise of determining whether someone has a purpose'' that justifies 
being allowed to remain on a public street. The law authorizes a police 
officer who ``observes a person whom he reasonably believes to be 
a criminal street gang member loitering in any public place with one 
or more other persons'' to order the entire group to move on and to 
arrest anyone who remains. Loitering is defined as ``to remain in 
any one place with no apparent purpose.'' Many of the justices' questions 
for Rosenthal, Chicago's lawyer, dealt with how the police are supposed 
to identify the purposeless loiterers to whom the law should be applied. 
Rosenthal insisted that any concern for the law's vagueness was misplaced. 
All people have to know is to obey an order to disperse, he said. 
``A law that says one cannot stand still in the city of Chicago when 
ordered to move is not vague,'' Rosenthal explained, adding that there 
was little potential for innocent people to be swept up along with 
gang members. In gang-ridden neighborhoods, people are afraid to use 
the streets and are not likely to be on them in any event, he said. 
But some justices still had questions. ``There is a concern here with 
the potential for arbitrariness in the way the police enforce it,'' 
Justice Sandra Day O'Connor said. Justice Stephen G. Breyer asked 
Rosenthal whether the city council could decide that ``we've had some 
problems with gangs, so no one can stand on the street.'' There was 
``nothing vague'' about such a law, Rosenthal said, adding that it 
was ``certainly rational.'' Breyer was not satisfied. ``Is that all 
it takes?'' he asked. ``My house isn't very big, it's unpleasant and 
it's hot. I want to go stand on the street and the city council says 
you can't?'' Because no ``fundamental right'' was involved, Rosenthal 
said, such a law should be upheld under the lowest level of constitutional 
scrutiny, mere rationality. This prompted a friendly intervention 
from Justice Antonin Scalia, who made his support for Chicago's argument 
quite clear. ``Do you know anyone who would rather smoke in a bar 
than stand on the street?'' he asked Rosenthal, and then went on to 
answer his own question: ``I know several, and they're disabled from 
doing it, and no one thinks it's a problem.'' When his turn came, 
Grossman, the civil liberties lawyer, said the city's argument that 
the law was not vague because it clearly obliged people to move when 
ordered was nothing more than ``a high level of sophistry.'' The essence 
of the law, he said, was being found on the street with no apparent 
purpose. He told the justices that of the 66 defendants on whose behalf 
he challenged the law, 34 had been charged only with being in the 
presence of a gang member and were not themselves identified as members 
of gangs. Breyer asked Grossman to propose an approach that would, 
in his view, be a constitutional way to attack the problem. The lawyer 
replied that other cities had laws that ``make distinctions between 
criminal loitering and innocent loitering,'' for example, making it 
a crime to loiter with intent to sell drugs or engage in prostitution. 
The laws make it clear that what is prohibited is ``wrongful conduct,'' 
he said.
