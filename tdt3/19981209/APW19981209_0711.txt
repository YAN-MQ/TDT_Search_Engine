Four baby elephants that were taken from the wild in Africa and abused 
will not be allowed to be sold to German zoos, Environment Minister 
Juergen Trittin said Wednesday. ``An illegal business with threatened 
animals will not be done with me,'' Trittin said in ordering the import 
permits revoked. The elephants were to be sent this month from South 
Africa to zoos in Dresden and Erfurt in eastern Germany. They were 
part of a group of 30 young elephants captured in August from herds 
in Botswana and taken to a South African farm owned by Riccardo Ghiazza 
through his company, African Game Services. A South African judge 
ruled last week the animals had been abused and deprived of water 
at the farm. He granted temporary custody to the National Society 
for the Prevention of Cruelty to Animals. Nevertheless, on Monday 
the judge approved the export of four baby elephants to Germany and 
three to Switzerland. But Germany, at least, no longer will take them. 
Trittin said he appreciated the valuable work done by zoos and the 
wish of people to see rare and fascinating animals firsthand. But 
he said international regulations on animal protection should not 
be violated.
