Most Americans apparently don't want the house Judiciary committee 
to recommend an impeachment probe of President Clinton. A CNN/"USA 
today" Gallup poll taken Tuesday night indicates 59% of americans 
think the committee should vote against impeachment. 34% say it should. 
Of the 59% of Americans who are against impeachment, 8% said it was 
because they believe the president did nothing illegal. 48% said even 
if his actions were illegal, they were "not impeachable."
