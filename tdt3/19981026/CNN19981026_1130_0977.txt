It's another seesaw day on Wall Street. Valerie Morris is standing 
by at the "CNN Financial News" newsdesk. Thanks, Catherine. The Dow 
has been moving in and out of positive territory all morning. Right 
now the Dow industrials are on the plus side, so to speak. Should 
still own some bonds, you should still own cash. When it gets up to 
the upper end you should go ahead and do it. Lower end, look at some 
bargains to get into. You really have to attack it on your own basis.
