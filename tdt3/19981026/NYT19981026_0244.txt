``Frontline'' returns on Tuesday night to the 1980s, when the nation 
was afflicted by an epidemic of accusations of child abuse. Here again 
are the bizarre charges, sensational headlines, anxious parents, zealous 
or gullible prosecutors and juries persuaded by the testimony of children 
led on by so-called therapists. The one new element reported on Tuesday 
night is the role of Janet Reno, who, when a state attorney in Miami, 
won a reputation for producing a method of getting convictions in 
shaky cases. One of her targets was Grant Snowden, a police officer 
who had been acquitted of sex abuse charges by a Miami jury that did 
not believe the solitary witness against him, a child. Ms. Reno's 
office devised a new prosecutorial strategy, dependent on therapists 
who are described here as ``the Pied Pipers of child abuse in Miami.'' 
Through manipulative questioning, examples of which can be seen on 
Tuesday night, they provided prosecutors with child witnesses against 
alleged molesters like Snowden, who was then convicted of the new 
charges and sentenced to five life terms. In another case, in which 
Ms. Reno took particular interest, a young defendant was acquitted 
after a two-year prosecution that cost $3 million. The defense finally 
won its case with the help of a respected child psychologist from 
Cornell University who exposed how readily a young child could be 
led to say almost anything that would suit an adroit interviewer, 
however improbable the charges. His analysis proved damning. That 
case, says Peter Boyer, the ``Frontline'' reporter, broke ``the sex 
abuse fever'' in Miami, and last April, after 12 years in jail, Snowden 
won his appeal. The issue, his lawyer says, was not whether the children 
were lying but whether the memories of abuse had been implanted in 
them by the therapists. The prosecutors went on to file their own 
appeal, but by then, we are pointedly reminded, Ms. Reno had long 
since left Miami to become Attorney General and had approved a fatal 
raid on the Branch Davidian compound in Waco, Texas, because she was 
convinced that the children there were being abused. PRODUCTION NOTES:
