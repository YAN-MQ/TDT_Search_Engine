First -- the clocking is ticking. NASA began the countdown to the 
launch of space shuttle "discovery," this morning. It's the most eagerly 
anticipated launch in years, especially for John glenn. The 77-year-old 
senator became the first American to orbit the earth in 1962. On this 
trip, he will take part in a number of medical experiments. President 
Clinton and roughly 70 members of Congress are expected to attend 
thursday's scheduled liftoff. NASA is keeping an eye on hurricane 
Mitch, but other than that, they say everything is going as planned. 
In summary, as far as the launch countdown is concerned, we are right 
on schedule. Flight and ground systems are all go, we are not tracking 
any issues or concerns and the launch team is looking forward to a 
successful launch and mission. Defense secretary William Cohen praised 
the crew of "discovery" a short time ago at a brief ceremony at the 
Johnson space center in Houston. He gave each member of the crew a 
special coin. Cohen said Glenn -- "holds all the energy and enthusiasm 
that propelled americans into space a generation ago."
