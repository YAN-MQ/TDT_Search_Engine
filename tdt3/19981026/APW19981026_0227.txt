A regional electrical company cut power Monday to a 1,230-kilometer 
(765-mile) stretch of the Trans-Siberian Railway because the railway 
hasn't paid its bill. Seventy-six freight trains were stranded on 
the Trans-Baikalian part of the railway, a dispatcher told the ITAR-Tass 
news agency. The Chitaenergo electrical company cut power from the 
Petrovsky Zavod Station in the Chita region of eastern Siberia to 
the Mogocha station. ITAR-Tass said the energy company is demanding 
payment of an 8 million ruble (dlrs 470,000) bill. The railway said 
it has no money because shipments have dwindled recently and cargo 
rates for vegetables were reduced by a government decree.
