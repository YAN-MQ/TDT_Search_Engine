Toni Braxton is facing the music over a car. TONI BRAXTON You mean 
the world to me. You are my everything. I swear the only thing that 
matters matters to me. Oh, baby, baby, baby. 'Cause you mean so much 
to me. Singer-turned-Broadway actress Toni Braxton underwent a well-publicized 
bankruptcy filing last year. Now she's being accused of failing to 
pay the lease on her BMW sports car. The suit alleges that Braxton 
has not made the payments on her 1997 Z-3 roadster since November 
of last year. The auto dealer wants possession of the $31,000 car. 
They claim that a friend of Braxton's has it. But so far, they've 
been unable to locate it.
