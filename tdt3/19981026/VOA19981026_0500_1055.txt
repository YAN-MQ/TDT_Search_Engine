You're listening to News Now from Washington. I'm Charlene Porter, 
along with Paul Westpheling. Israeli leader Netanyahu says he expects 
to defeat today's right-wing challenge of the new Mid East peace accord. 
That's the top story of this hour. That is 1018 Universal Time. We'll 
have further details on this story out of the Middle East later in 
the broadcast. Time now for sports. Here with it all is VOA's Jim 
Stevenson.
