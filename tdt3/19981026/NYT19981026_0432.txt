Mike Piazza has signed. Al Leiter has all but signed. And now the 
Mets' next move may be bringing back someone they once made the highest-paid 
player in the game when they signed him as a free agent almost seven 
years ago: Bobby Bonilla. General Manager Steve Phillips would not 
comment Monday on talk that the Mets would send Mel Rojas to the Los 
Angeles Dodgers for Bonilla, who played in parts of four stormy seasons 
for the Mets from 1992 to 1995. But the way the Mets' co-owner Fred 
Wilpon sounded Monday, he would not mind having Bonilla back. ``Putting 
tampering aside, if the Dodgers wanted to talk to Steve about a trade, 
Nelson and I would be very receptive,'' Wilpon said, referring to 
the Mets' other co-owner, Nelson Doubleday. ``Bobby has changed. His 
attitude toward New York has changed. And on the plus side, he's basically 
a metropolitan New York guy. I think he wants to finish what he started 
here. Coming in where he is not `The Guy,' that's the most important 
thing. He's got a supporting cast now.'' Meaning Piazza, of course. 
Should the Mets reobtain the switch-hitting Bonilla, who turns 36 
in February, he would most likely become their everyday left fielder 
and bat behind Piazza. The Mets tried to do the same thing with the 
switch-hitting Todd Hundley, but the experiment failed after 34 games. 
Now, with Piazza's signing, Hundley's career with the Mets appears 
to be over. ``Most of the calls I had today have been from general 
managers in relation to what are we going to do with Todd,'' Phillips 
said. ``But we've also had a couple calls from agents. They see money 
being spent.'' There will be more to follow, Wilpon and Doubleday 
said. ``Steve has the permission and the obligation to go out and 
put as many pieces together as he can, short of going out on the subway 
tracks and throwing money at trains,'' Doubleday said Monday. The 
first move was re-signing Piazza. Doubleday was asked if he ever thought 
it possible that Piazza would come back when he was being booed over 
the summer at Shea Stadium. ``I didn't think that far ahead,'' Doubleday 
said. ``I was just thinking, `Mike, please do something to shut our 
boo-birds up.' But I think at the end of the year, he had won them 
over. ``I grew up in the entertainment business. And we're selling 
entertainment here. I felt that if we got a man of Piazza's stature 
and ability, the fans would come back. And they did. So we kind of 
owed them one.'' Said Wilpon: ``Theoretically, there are a couple 
of positions that we can enhance. We need to get some power from one 
of the outfield corners. We need to get some speed on this team. We 
need some more pitching, maybe both starting and relief. And we certainly 
need either a second baseman or a third baseman,'' depending on where 
Edgardo Alfonzo plays. Which means that Carlos Baerga is all but out 
as a Met. And that any one of the Mets' starters other than Leiter 
or Rick Reed may be deemed expendable. ``Three years ago, four years 
ago, we weren't ready then,'' Wilpon said of his team's rebuilding 
years. ``We didn't want to play Rotisserie baseball like we did in 
the early '90s. And the chemistry wasn't good. I think we're ready 
now to do what we have to do.'' And that is one reason Bonilla may 
be back. Another is that Bonilla may be more available because Davey 
Johnson has been hired for three years as the Dodger manager; those 
two have clashed in the past, most recently in Baltimore. If the Mets 
and Dodgers conclude a deal, the Mets will probably pick up the $4.5 
million remaining on Rojas' salary, while the Dodgers will pay Bonilla's 
$5.9 million next season and then a sizable portion of the same amount 
in the year 2000. ``We have a business plan in place that takes into 
account revenues, expenses and payroll,'' Phillips said. ``It will 
be higher than last year. It puts us in the range to become a playoff- 
and World Series-caliber team. Our rank will be higher than last year.'' 
But that rank will almost certainly not include Hundley's salary, 
not with Piazza signed for seven years. ``I'm sort of saddened,'' 
said Wilpon, who has an extremely close relationship with Hundley. 
``I had hoped we'd be able to fit both. It was a long shot. But I 
had hoped Todd would be able to play another position and that he'd 
be able to stay here. I have very strong feelings about Todd and toward 
Todd. Hopefully, he will go to a place where he will really thrive. 
But it will probably be in a league that starts with an A.''
