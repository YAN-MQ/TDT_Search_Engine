And here in this country, we're anxiously awaiting a launch ourselves, 
aren't we, Susan? Yes, the countdown clocks are ticking for the scheduled 
launch Thursday of the U.S. shuttle Discovery and the return to space 
of pioneering astronaut John Glenn. The primary purpose of the nine-day 
mission is to conduct 83 science experiments. But the limelight is 
falling on Senator Glenn, who, at age 77, will be the oldest person 
to fly in space. In 1962, he became the first American to orbit the 
earth. At space flight headquarters in Houston, Texas, U.S. defense 
secretary William Cohen today called for Mr. Glenn a role model and 
an explorer and an American hero for the ages. Mr. Cohen said the 
seven-member Discovery crew will be on a mission of international 
cooperation with the participation of specialists from Spain and Japan. 
Senator Glenn convinced the U.S. space agency to let him be part of 
research on the effects of space travel on the elderly.
