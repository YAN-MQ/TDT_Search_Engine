Pierre van Hooijdonk, the Dutch striker who has refused to play for 
Nottingham Forest this season because of a contract dispute, is about 
to return to the club, the club confirmed Monday. Van Hooijdonk reached 
an agreement with the club last week and straightened out the last 
details in a telephone conversation Sunday night with Forest manager 
Dave Basset, the Algemeen Dagblad reported. ``I'm going to do my very 
best for the club,'' Van Hooijdonk told the Algemeen Dagblad. ``The 
club needs me _ It's second from bottom in the league.'' Van Hooijdonk, 
whose goals last season helped lead Forest win promotion back to the 
Premier Division, was refused a summer transfer by the club and has 
refused to play ever since. He is currently keeping in shape by training 
with his old Dutch club NAC Breda. ``I want to show that I haven't 
lost any of my quality,'' he said. Forest said Van Hooijdonk plans 
to return to the City Ground on Thursday _ against Bassett's wishes. 
``In an ideal world, Dave Bassett would not have him back but it was 
a corporate decision. He represents an investment of 5 million pounds 
(dlrs 8.4 million) and Dave Bassett accepts that,'' a club statement 
said. ``If Pierre Van Hooijdonk comes back and behaves himself, Dave 
Bassett says he will take it from there. ``Pierre Van Hooijdonk's 
suspension will finish on Thursday. ... If he comes in for training 
on Friday he will be put into an intensive program and his fitness 
will be assessed.'' Without the tall striker, Forest has made a disastrous 
start to the season. It stands 19th in the 20-team Premiership and 
has scored just seven goals in 10 matches.
