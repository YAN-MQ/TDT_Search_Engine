NATO is looking for evidence Serbian special police units are being 
withdrawn from Kosovo in compliance with NATO demands. Here in Washington, 
U.S. officials say Yugoslav forces in Kosovo are on the move. But 
they say it's too early to say if the withdrawals will be sufficient 
to meet NATO's deadline on Tuesday. VOA's David Gollust reports from 
the White House. Officials here say Yugoslav authorities had been 
stalling on the troop withdrawals from Kosovo they had committed to 
make under the October 12 accord mediated by the United States. But 
White House spokesman Joe Lockhart says things began to change after 
a weekend visit to Belgrade by NATO supreme commander General Wesley 
Clark, who made clear to President Slobodan Milosevic what he had 
to do to avert the use of force by NATO. It appears that General Clark's 
meetings with President Milosevic may have had some impact because 
we do see a lot of movement, but we want to make sure that that movement 
is real and it's real withdrawal and not reconfiguration. U.S. officials 
say NATO's North Atlantic Council will meet in Brussels as the deadline 
approaches on Tuesday to make a determination if the pullback has 
been sufficient to withdraw the allied threat of air strikes against 
Yugoslav military targets. David Gollust, VOA News, the White House.
