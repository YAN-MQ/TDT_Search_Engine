Malaysia plans to review its defense needs, including its stand toward 
a defense arrangement with Singapore, Australia, New Zealand and Britain, 
Defense Minister Syed Hamid Albar said Monday. Speaking with reporters 
after meeting New Zealand Foreign Minister Don McKinnon, Syed Hamid 
said McKinnon had expressed his country's concern over talk that Malaysia 
intended to pull out of the Five-Power Defense Arrangement. McKinnon 
said New Zealand felt that military links through the arrangement 
should be continued into the next century because of their usefulness 
in military exercises, training and education, the Malaysian news 
agency Bernama reported. The arrangement was created 27 years ago 
to defend Malaysia and Singapore from a communist threat. It needs 
to be reviewed to meet Malaysia's defense needs in the new century, 
Bernama quoted Syed Hamid as saying. He said Malaysia would make known 
its stand on the arrangement after it had completed its defense policy 
review in the middle of next year. He also said he had discussed with 
McKinnon the possibility of expanding the arrangement's membership 
to include a country that shared a common history.
