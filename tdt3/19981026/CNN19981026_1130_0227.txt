Yugoslavia's government is showing signs of complying with U.N. demands 
to withdraw troops from Kosovo or face NATO air strikes as early as 
tomorrow. Kieran Baker has an update. a funeral Sunday for an 11-year-old 
ethnic Albanian boy eyewitnesses say was shot dead by Serb forces. 
Shemsi elshani had been out cutting wood when machine gun fire opened 
up. The boy's father explains to verifiers where the shots came from. 
Villagers in this central part of Kosovo came to pay their respects, 
the shock too much. Shemsi's mother faints with grief. The funeral 
was held up as gunfire began, hard to verify, though. Villagers say 
it was Serb forces, intimidation of the deadliest degree. A makeshift 
coffin carried shemsi to his final resting place. The burial complete, 
the villagers departed only to be attacked again, this time the sound 
of automatic gunfire and a single shell. As the countdown in Kosovo 
begins for a second time, the atmosphere here remains charged. Significant 
Serb forces relocate back to barracks, a sign of some compliance. 
On the other hand, Sunday, we filmed surface-to-air missiles on the 
move. Clearly, the Serbs remain concerned about NATO air strikes. 
The uneasy cease-fire has provided problems for the relief agencies 
in reaching the thousands of ethnic Albanians displaced by this conflict. 
This group had not received any aid in three months. It's impossible, 
really, to tell how many little groups like this there are. These 
people have hidden for a good reason. Not only hidden from the fighting 
but also very well hidden from us. Whether or not compliance is complete, 
many still remain hidden in the forests of Kosovo, still too afraid 
to return home. Kieran Baker, CNN, Pristina, Yugoslavia.
