The Chinese government warned foreign banks that they should not expect 
Beijing to bail out their loans to bankrupt financial companies, the 
Financial Times newspaper reported in Monday's editions. Xiang Huaicheng, 
the finance minister, told the newspaper that Beijing will not be 
acting as a guarantor of last resort. Foreign banks have lent the 
recently failed Guandong International Trust and Investment Corporation 
and other investment companies throughout China more than dlrs 10 
billion. And Xiang said he expects the number of failed investment 
companies to grow. ``Local government does not have the qualification 
or the resources to guarantee these loans. I say to governors of the 
province, even I do not dare to provide these guarantees, so how dare 
you,'' Xiang told the newspaper. ``Then I just say, the foreign bankers 
themselves should look really carefully at these loans.'' Xiang's 
warning will come as a shock to foreign bankers, many of whom expected 
the Chinese government to assume responsibility for honoring the loans, 
the newspaper said. But the government's hard line may also improve 
the health of China's financial system by forcing other investment 
groups to guard against corruption and ineptitude to protect the foreign 
loans, the newspaper reported. ``We announced to the whole world that 
we are doing something real now to reform our financial system. We 
are also giving a big warning to all the international trust and investment 
corporations across the provinces,'' Xiang told the newspaper. ``And 
this is also a lesson to investors and foreign bankers that before 
you provide these loans you should study Chinese laws carefully.''
