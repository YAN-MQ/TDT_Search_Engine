Czech President Vaclav Havel asked authorities to declassify documents 
relating to allegations that former Vienna mayor Helmut Zilk was an 
agent of the former communist secret police, the news agency CTK reported 
Monday. CTK quoted Havel's spokesman Ladislav Spacek as saying that 
Havel sent the request after Sen. Vaclav Benda, once director of an 
institute investigating crimes of the former communist regime, said 
there was evidence that Zilk worked for the Czechoslovak secret police, 
or STB. Zilk was to receive a high state order Wednesday in a ceremony 
marking the 80th anniversary of the founding of the Czechoslovak Republic 
in 1918. Havel withdrew the honor after a source claimed that Zilk 
spied for the Czech communist secret service and provided information 
that led to several convictions. Zilk said he considers the accusation 
a nonsense, adding he had ``nothing to do with the secret police in 
Czechoslovakia.'' He also said he would demand that Havel provide 
``all materials and evidence.'' Despite the president's claim that 
he would not provide any information not even to Zilk, his chancellor 
Ivan Medek sent a letter to Benda Monday, asking for his opinion on 
``the case Helmut Zilk.'' In his reply sent to the presidential office 
the same day, Benda said he considers the affair ``very unfortunate 
and damaging to Czech-Austrian relations.'' He, however, confirmed 
that Zilk acted as a paid agent of the Czechoslovak intelligence service 
in the second half of the 1960s. Benda said his statement was based 
on ``confirmed information.'' Both letters were made available to 
The Associated Press by Havel's office. Benda could not be immediately 
reached for comment. On Sunday, many Czech politicians voiced their 
disapproval to Havel's decision. ``If I want to award somebody a state 
order and then put him in such an unpleasant, embarrassing situation, 
that's something that mustn't happen,'' parliamentary speaker Vaclav 
Klaus told Czech radio. ``The president should have know that before,'' 
minister jaroslav basta said. Eighty-one state orders and medals will 
be awarded by Havel on Wednesday, 24 of them posthumously.
