Many of our FM and medium-wave affiliate stations are taking a bit 
of a break. I hope you'll return to News Now. It was not an ordinary 
stroll in the park for Norma Hayduk. She was walking in Santa Fe, 
New Mexico, and she noticed an envelope marked "for you" sticking 
out of the slats of a park bench. Inside the envelope was $100 and 
a note which said, among other things, "Yes, this is for you, and 
yes, this is for real. Money comes in my life, and I'm grateful for 
it. This is my way for me to express my gratitude. Enjoy, a friend." 
Well, Mrs. Hayduk's husband, Kenneth, says he's never run into anything 
like this before. Mr. Hayduk, who is 51, is a heat, ventilation and 
air conditioning technician apprentice. Mrs. Hayduk, 48, is a customer 
service representative. The couple was married recently. Mr. Hayduk 
says about the money, "We could sure use this. We're just average 
folks." And he says he hopes that whoever left the money knows it's 
appreciated. He said, "I guess there are some decent, caring people 
left in the world." Now, I've got some thoughts on this here. I want 
to know, do you think that the person who left the envelope was leaving 
it for Mr. and Mrs. Hayduk specifically? Or was it someone who just 
wanted to benefit some other stranger and was just leaving this money 
for the next passerby? I think it was probably leaving it for whomever 
picked it up and hoped that they would call the Associated Press... 
For the next passerby? ...get out stories. Santa Fe, New Mexico. Did 
you get an address on this story? What part was this? Can you tell 
me where this was? No, but I'll tell you the spelling of the name. 
Well, there's only one big part in Santa Fe. You know, you walk... 
First off, we should let the audience know this does not happen often. 
No, it doesn't. It does not. It's 1100 Universal Time from Washington.
