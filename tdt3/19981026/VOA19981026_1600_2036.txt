The European Union has decided to tighten sanctions on the government 
of Burma. EU foreign ministers meeting in Luxembourg voted Monday 
to widen a travel ban against Burmese officials. They also extended 
current sanctions, which include an arms embargo and the suspension 
of both nonhumanitarian aid and high-level government visits.
