Georgia has negotiated a dlrs 200 million loan from the European Bank 
for Reconstruction and Development to help build an oil pipeline, 
President Eduard Shevardnadze said Monday. Georgia is building a pipeline 
that would carry some of the early oil produced by an international 
consortium off Azerbaijan's Caspian Sea shelf to Western Europe. The 
EBRD loan would help complete the pipeline and build an oil terminal 
at Georgia's Black Sea port of Supsa, Shevardnadze said in a radio 
interview. Georgia hopes that oil transit fees will help rebuild its 
economy, weakened by political unrest and a war in the secessionist 
province of Abkhazia. The London-based EBRD, which is supporting development 
projects in Eastern Europe and former Soviet republics, is also helping 
to modernize Georgia's railway and power plants. The EBRD has already 
earmarked dlrs 85 million in loans to Georgia so far this year, said 
Vazha Kapanadze, head of the government's department for economic 
reform. Shevardnadze, the former Soviet foreign minister who returned 
to lead his native Georgia after the collapse of the Soviet Union, 
has successfully used his connections in the West to obtain financial 
aid.
