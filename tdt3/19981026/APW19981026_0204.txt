Embattled Bangladeshi author Taslima Nasrin said Monday she will never 
bow to the Islamic extremists who have vowed to kill her because of 
her alleged blasphemy. ``I'll never be silenced. Nor shall I compromise 
my ideas and thoughts,'' Nasrin, 36, told The Associated Press in 
a telephone interview from her hide-out. The author has been in hiding 
since her return to Bangladesh in September to care for her mother, 
who is dying of colon cancer. She had spent the previous four years 
in exile in Europe and America after her critics offered a reward 
of 200,000 takas (dlrs 5,000) to anyone who would kill her. She also 
faces arrest for allegedly offending the religious sentiments of Muslims 
in this predominately Islamic country. Thousands of angry Muslims 
have poured into the streets in renewed protest against the author 
since her return. In the most recent demonstrations, scores of anti-Nasrin 
protesters attacked a government office and smashed windows in Sunamganj, 
a town 110 miles (176 kilometers) northeast of Dhaka, the capital, 
on Sunday. ``I've not done anything wrong. I've told the truth and 
will continue to do so,'' she said, angrily denying a report that 
she was considering apologizing to her critics and seeking their forgiveness. 
``The question of seeking any apology does not arise,'' she said. 
Nasrin, a poet, essayist and novelist, became a target of Islamic 
extremists after a newspaper quoted her as saying the Koran, Islamic 
holy book, should be rewritten. She denied making the comment, but 
said she favored changes in Islamic laws to give women in her conservative 
society more rights. ``I still believe that if any religion keeps 
women under slavery I can't accept that religion,'' Nasrin said in 
her telephone interview. Her novel, ``Lajja'', or ``Shame'', criticized 
Muslims for persecuting minority Hindus in Bangladesh in retaliation 
for the destruction of a mosque by Hindu zealots in neighboring India 
in 1992. The book was banned in Bangladesh.
