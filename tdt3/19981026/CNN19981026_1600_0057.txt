Investors on Wall Street are recovering from a scare, but not one 
that has anything to do with Asian economic turmoil or corporate earning 
reports. The New York stock exchange says it halted trading for an 
hour this afternoon because of an equipment failure. When trading 
resumed, the Dow Jones industrial average bobbed up and down, eventually 
ending down, 16.47 points. We'll have more on this story in "Dollars 
& Sense" at 16 past the hour.
