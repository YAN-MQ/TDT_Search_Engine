The toll from Typhoon Babs is still being tallied in the Philippines, 
but the storm's impact is not only measured in the 160 reported deaths 
and the thousands still in evacuation centers. As Ruth Youngblood 
reports from Manila, there is now the ominous possibility that a recession, 
previously discounted by government officials, may be brought on by 
the year's bad weather. President Joseph Estrada is fond of bragging 
the Philippines is better off than its Asian neighbors, which are 
already mired in recession. His administration has been counting on 
at least 1 percent gross domestic product, or GDP, growth this year. 
That scenario is being challenged after Typhoon Zeb and Typhoon Babs 
smacked the Archipelago within a week, causing $157 million in damage. 
Of that, $100 million is in agricultural losses. Economists eyeing 
the 7 percent contraction in the agricultural sector in the first 
half of the year fear mother nature's onslaught is pushing the Philippines 
into a recession. Analyst Estro del Cafilio of A&A Securities notes 
the typhoon affected areas, which are prime rice and coconut growing 
regions, account for 55 percent of the nation's GDP. Pablito Valegas, 
an agribusiness consultant says the modest recovery earlier anticipated 
for the fourth quarter is unlikely if meteorologists are right and 
a series of strong typhoons continue to lash the Philippines this 
season. Growth is still possible in the fourth quarter, Mr. Valegas 
says, if there are no more devastating storms. Mr. Valegas notes agricultural 
productivity has also been hampered by the financial crisis, which 
has prompted banks and financial institutions to impose stricter rules 
on assets to farm credit. With the ominous weather and the bad economic 
situation, Mr. Valegas asks how the country can achieve growth. A 
spokesman for the Estrada administration says the Philippines can 
still avoid a recession. Secretary Benjamin Diosno of the Department 
of Budget and Management insists the domestic economy is still relatively 
better off than the others in the region. He acknowledges, however, 
that the full impact of the weather phenomenon La Nina, with its unusually 
strong winds, heavy rains and flash floods, has not yet been felt. 
Mr. Diosno's economic and budget managers are bracing for worsening 
conditions in anticipation of La Nina's attack. Ruth Youngblood, VOA 
News, Manila.
