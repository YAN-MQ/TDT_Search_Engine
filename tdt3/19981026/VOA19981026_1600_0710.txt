In Iran, conservative candidates and their allies are celebrating 
their decisive victory in last Friday's elections of the country's 
Assembly of Experts. The assembly chooses and has the power to dismiss 
the country's supreme religious leader. Middle East correspondent 
Scott Bobb reports from Teheran, official results show moderate candidates 
only won 16 of the 86 contested seats on the influential body. Hard-line 
leaders who want to retain sweeping powers for Iran's supreme religious 
leader Monday praised the vote as a triumph for democracy. They said 
the voter turnout of 46 percent showed the people rejected calls for 
a boycott by some moderate and reformist leaders. Some Iranian leaders 
urged their supporters to boycott the elections after a vetting council 
removed most of the moderate candidates from the list. Other moderate 
leaders urged citizens to go to the polls and afterwards praised the 
election as a further consolidation of the democratic process. They 
pointed out that their group won 15 percent of the seats in the assembly 
and said as a result their voice will still be heard. Voter turnout 
was lowest in the heavily populated urban districts of the country. 
In Teheran, less than 40 percent of those eligible went to the polls. 
In some sparsely populated rural areas, however, more than 60 percent 
of the voters cast their ballots. One political leader whose party 
boycotted the elections told VOA the higher than expected turnout 
was due to pressure on families who receive government assistance. 
These families, he said, must prove they have voted in order to continue 
to receive government support. In recent years, a struggle has emerged 
in Iranian politics between reformists who want to loosen controls 
over the news media, the arts and everyday life and conservatives 
who fear liberalization will lead to a loss of power and the degeneration 
of moral values. Reformists have made significant gains in local and 
national politics since the overwhelming election of President Mohammed 
Khatemi 18 months ago. However, conservatives who still control the 
judiciary and the legislature have fought back, seeking the dismissal 
of reformist officials on legal grounds and suspending publications 
that support their ideas. Scott Bobb, VOA News, Teheran.
