Russian and Austrian aircraft designers have agreed to jointly produce 
MiG warplanes at a Vienna plant, with Russia supplying the parts and 
the Austrians coming up with the cash, a news report said Monday. 
The plans for the MiG-110 are expected to be discussed during Prime 
Minister Yevgeny Primakov's visit to Vienna on Tuesday, the Interfax 
news agency reported. Russia's main MiG production center has already 
received 20 percent of the necessary funding from the Vienna plant 
for the plane's parts, Lev Shengelaya, the plane's chief designer, 
was quoted as saying. He would not name the plant or say how much 
the project would cost. The MiG-110 would be able to airlift cargoes, 
paratroopers or emergency rescue teams, Shengelaya said.
