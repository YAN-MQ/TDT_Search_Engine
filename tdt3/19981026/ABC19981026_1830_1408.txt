Pushing the limits of exploration. Only 12 men have ever walked on 
the Moon. In a moment, we'll talk to the last man to do it. i've just 
got this burning love for food. But sometimes it just doesn't love 
me back. Heartburn surging up to here. What my doctor calls acid reflux. 
When I get it, he says get gaviscon. Only regular gaviscon forms a 
soothing, protective barrier to help keep stomach acid down -- where 
it belongs. Mylanta can't -- pepcid ac can't. Only gaviscon can. So 
my heartburn doesn't come back to burn me. It helps keep acid down 
where it be longs. R there is an athlete amongst us disguised as a 
MOTHER AND a neighbor. And when most of us are still sleeping, she's 
running. She also takes the vitamins, minerals, antioxidants, and 
folic acid in women's ultra mega multivitamins made by general nutrition 
centers. Tomorrow, she'll get up and run some more. Women's ultra 
mega multivitamins, made exclusively by gnc. Live strong. Live well.
