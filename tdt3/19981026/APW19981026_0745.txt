Two Serbian independent dailies halted publishing Monday after police 
raided the office and confiscated property of another non-government 
newspaper fined for alleged anti-state activity. Nasa Borba and Danas, 
who had been briefly banned by the government earlier this month, 
said they would not resume publishing to protest a new media law imposing 
censorship on the fledgling independent media. Also Monday, editors 
of Serbia's independent media agreed to launch a public campaign to 
fight the latest media restrictions imposed by the authorities loyal 
to Yugoslav President Slobodan Milosevic. Police raided the office 
of Dnevni Telegraf daily late Sunday, taking away equipment to forcefully 
collect a fine that its publisher and editor had been ordered to pay 
under the new law passed by the Serbian parliament last week. Armed 
police also surrounded the apartment building of Slavko Curuvija, 
the editor, threatening to seize his property. But they left after 
realizing the flat did not belong to Curuvija. ``What is happening 
now is ... destroying the image of your country,'' said U.N. human 
rights official Jiri Dientsbier, who arrived at the scene. ``I will 
ask the international community to support the existence of free media 
in Serbia.'' The media law last Tuesday banned Serbian-language programs 
by foreign media and empowered the authorities to punish publishers 
and journalists for any articles or photos deemed damaging to the 
state. On Friday, a Belgrade court ruled that Curuvija, the DT Press 
company, another editor and a magazine manager violated the law by 
publishing an article that accused Milosevic of introducing ``dictatorship'' 
and leading the country into political and economic chaos. The article, 
along with two disputed photographs, appeared in Evropljanin (European) 
weekly, also published by DT Press and edited by Curuvija, from the 
same premises in downtown Belgrade. Dozens of desks, telephones and 
other equipment were loaded onto trucks under police supervision and 
taken away. The police swoop also prevented the printing of 100,000 
copies of Dnevni Telegraf's Monday issue. The accused journalists 
said they could not and would not pay the fines which total 2.4 million 
dinars (dlrs 246,000). The fines for Curuvija and DT Press are 800,000 
dinars (dlrs 82,000) each. The other two were fined 400,000 dinars 
(dlrs 41,000) each. The law was passed amid anti-Western sentiment 
in the country fueled by NATO threats to launch airstrikes to end 
the crisis in Kosovo. Ethnic Albanian secessionists have been battling 
Yugoslav troops in the southern Serbian province. Independent legal 
experts and journalists say the law reimposes censorship that Serbia 
formally abandoned in the 1980s and drags Serb-led Yugoslavia back 
toward single-party dictatorship. The opposition Democratic Party 
compared the repression to the former fascist and Communist regimes, 
saying ``it is obvious a new period is starting in Serbia in which 
the regime will try to spread fear.''
