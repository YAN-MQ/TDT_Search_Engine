JERUSALEM (AP) - With Mideast peace talks back on track, the Vatican's 
foreign minister said Monday the Holy See wants to join negotiations 
between Israel and the Palestinians on the future of Jerusalem and 
its holy sites. Monsignor Jean Louis Tauran said that Israel and the 
Palestinians would only benefit from bringing all those with a stake 
in the holy city into the talks. ``The (Israeli and Palestinian) negotiators 
are expected to include the participation of the sponsors of the peace 
process and other parties could also be invited to contribute,'' Tauran 
said. His speech opened a two-day conference on Jerusalem attended 
by some 40 Catholic clergymen from all over the world. Tauran's comments 
came just three days after Israel and the Palestinians cleared a major 
hurdle on the way to final status talks by concluding an interim agreement 
on a West Bank troop withdrawal. Under the original timetable, the 
talks were to be completed by May 4, 1999. However, negotiations have 
not yet begin, and the deadline no longer seems realistic. In negotiations 
on a permanent peace agreement, the two sides will try to tackle the 
most difficult issues, including the future of Jerusalem. Palestinians 
want traditionally Arab east Jerusalem as the capital of their would-be 
state. But Israel, which captured the Arab sector in the 1967 Middle 
East war, has maintained it will not accept a divided capital. Tauran 
cautioned that any deal must ensure that Jerusalem's religious and 
cultural heritage is not changed. The Vatican sees Jerusalem as ``the 
symbol and the national center of both the peoples that claim it as 
their capital,'' Tauran said. Disputes over the status of Jerusalem 
soured relations between Israel and the Vatican for many years, but 
the two established diplomatic relations in 1993, the year Israel 
signed its breakthrough peace agreement with the Palestinians.
