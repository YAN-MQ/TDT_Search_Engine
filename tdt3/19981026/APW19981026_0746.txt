Thousands of participants in the Dublin City Marathon observed a minute's 
silence Monday in memory of Noel Carroll, the Irish track trailblazer 
who died unexpectedly from a heart attack. Carroll, 56, died Friday 
after completing his usual noontime jog, with plans to run as usual 
in the annual 26-mile (42-km) marathon that starts and finishes on 
Dublin's broad O'Connell Street. He will be buried Tuesday after Mass 
at St. Anne's Catholic church in suburban south Dublin. Best known 
in the United States for his 1960s exploits as a world-class middle-distance 
runner at Villanova University, Carroll had spent the past 25 years 
at the vocal forefront of developments in the Irish capital, serving 
most recently as chief executive of Dublin Chamber of Commerce. Prime 
Minister Bertie Ahern led tributes to Carroll, calling him ``the epitome 
of professionalism on behalf of his beloved city of Dublin.'' ``As 
a talented sportsman, brilliant communicator and clear-minded thinker, 
he was outstanding in his generation,'' said Ahern. Born Dec. 7, 1941 
in rural County Louth, Carroll left school at age 13 and joined the 
Irish army, where he defied his oversized proportions _ 6-foot-3 (1.88 
meters) and some 200 pounds (90 kgs) _ to develop his lifelong passion 
for running. As an 18-year-old Carroll rewrote the Irish track record 
book and set several European and world records for his age group, 
being named Irish Athlete of the Year in 1961. The following year 
Villanova's renowned track coach James Elliott recruited Carroll to 
the university outside Philadelphia after spotting him at a competition 
in New York. Carroll anchored the 880-meters relay team that set a 
world record, but he failed to win any medals for Ireland in the 1964 
and 1968 Olympic Games. From 1972 to 1996 he was the voice of Dublin's 
urban authority, the Dublin Corporation, often grabbing headlines 
with no-nonsense views on development and social problems facing the 
city. He maintained the style after moving to the Chamber of Commerce 
two years ago. In recent months he courted controversy by fighting 
losing battles against governments plans to build an above-ground 
commuter rail system through central Dublin, and to shut down key 
roads in the capital to accommodate the Tour be France cycling race. 
Carroll also championed an Irish foreign-aid agency called Goal. He 
donated royalties from his 1982 autobiography ``The Runner's Log,'' 
organized an annual fund-raising run, and served as the charity's 
chairman. Last year he clashed with the government over its decision 
to cut off funding because Goal kept inadequate accounts. He is survived 
by his wife, singer and harpist Deirdre O'Callaghan; their four children 
Enda, 33, Nicola, 32, Noel, 28, and Stephen, 24; and five grandchildren.
