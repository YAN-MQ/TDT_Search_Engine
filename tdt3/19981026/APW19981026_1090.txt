The former East German communists won their highest political post 
since the fall of the Berlin Wall on Monday when one of their members 
was elected a vice president of parliament. Backed by the center-left 
majority that emerged from last month's election, Petra Blaess defeated 
a rival candidate put forward out of protest by the Christian Democrats 
of outgoing Chancellor Helmut Kohl. In Germany, parties that gain 
more than 5 percent of the national vote have a right to nominate 
a parliamentary vice president. The ex-communist Party of Democratic 
Socialism got the chance after clearing the hurdle in the Sept. 27 
election. Blaess, 34, was the only one of the five candidates to face 
an opponent during the voting in the new parliament's opening session. 
She defeated Michaela Geiger, a Bavarian conservative, by a 355-285 
vote. Blaess was the electoral commissioner for East Germany's only 
free election under communism in March 1990, five months after the 
Berlin Wall fell.
