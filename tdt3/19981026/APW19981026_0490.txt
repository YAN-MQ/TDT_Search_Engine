The government ordered an investigation Monday into the police beating 
of illegal immigrants who rioted last week after learning some of 
them would be deported. Attorney General Alecos Markides said that 
he appointed two investigators to carry out the probe. The move followed 
charges by human rights groups on the Mediterranean island that police 
used excessive force in putting down the protest. ``I believe all 
that I have seen warrants a criminal investigation,'' Markides said.
