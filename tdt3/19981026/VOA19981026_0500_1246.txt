Weldon Johnson has won the annual Marine Corps marathon right here 
in Washington with a time of 2 hours, 25 minutes and 31 seconds. Johnson, 
a local runner competing in his very first marathon, outpaced Mark 
Croasdale by six minutes. Gary Gerrard placed third. Johnson says 
it was a very long race. It's a great challenge. It's a long way. 
I don't think I had enough respect for the distance. Now I really 
do. I mean, you knew it was going to be tough. But 26 miles is a long 
way. Kimberly Markland of San Antonio, Texas, posted the fasted time 
among the women, crossing the finish line in 2 hours, 49 minutes and 
7 seconds. Markland says she just tried to focus on maintaining her 
fast pace. Running through Georgetown on a decline, I said to one 
of the guys next to me, I said, "I sure hope I can keep this up and 
win this because this is a heck of a lot of fun." The race, which 
is also called the people's marathon, featured 18,300 runners who 
covered the 42-kilometer course that took them past many of Washington's 
most recognized memorials. Participants wore a special computer chip 
threaded into their shoe laces that tracked their progress and recorded 
a precise finishing time.
