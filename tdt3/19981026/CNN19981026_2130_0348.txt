Prime minister Benjamin Netanyahu sailed through a no-confidence vote 
today brought by ultra-nationalists opposed to the recently brokered 
mideast peace deal. The motion was defeated 8 to 21. Another Bill 
to dissolve the Israeli parliament, the Knesset, is pending. It would 
call for new elections before the scheduled date in 2000.
