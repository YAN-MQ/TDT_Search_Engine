More cases of typhoid have been reported in the southern Russian region 
of Dagestan, the ITAR-Tass news agency said Monday. Twenty-six people, 
including eight children, have been hospitalized with symptoms of 
the disease, ITAR-Tass said, quoting the press office of the Emergencies 
Ministry. Twenty-one confirmed cases have been reported, it said. 
The outbreak was blamed on sewage getting into the water system. Local 
officials health officials tried to downplay the outbreak. ``There 
is no reason for panic in connection with the abdominal typhoid cases,'' 
said Dagestan's acting health minister, Dzhamalutdin Gasayev, according 
to ITAR-Tass. Dozens were sickened by typhoid in Dagestan this summer. 
Typhoid is an extremely infectious disease caused by ingesting dirty 
food or water. It is characterized by fever and intestinal disorders.
