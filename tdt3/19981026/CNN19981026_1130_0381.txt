Russian President Boris Yeltsin's doctors want him to stay home. They've 
reportedly ordered him to cancel a one-day trip to Austria because 
of extreme fatigue. He was supposed to leave tomorrow for talks with 
European union officials. Instead, he's sending prime minister Yevgeny 
Primakov. Earlier this month, President Yeltsin was forced to cut 
short a trip to central Asia because of health problems.
