Israeli prime minister Benjamin Netanyahu has easily survived a no-confidence 
motion introduced by opponents of the interim peace accord he signed 
with the Palestinians in Washington on Friday. A majority of the legislators 
did not show up for the vote. The motion was brought by the ultranationalist 
Moldet Party, which opposes giving up any West Bank land.
