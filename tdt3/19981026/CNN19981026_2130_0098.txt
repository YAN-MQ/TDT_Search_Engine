Family, friends and patients of Dr. Barnett slepian gathered today 
for his funeral in suburban Buffalo, New York. Some mourners brought 
along the children he helped deliver. A sniper shot the obsetrician/gynecologist 
with a high-powered rifle at his home Friday. An U.S. Canadian task 
force investigating the crime says it feels strongly slepian's shooting 
is connected to other sniper attacks over the last four years, targeting 
doctors who performed abortions. Police says the shootings all happened 
in late October or early November. And the attackers used similar 
high-powered rifles. FBI agents say they are following several leads. 
The FBI has announced a $100,000 reward for information leading to 
the arrest of Dr. slepian's killer.
