Yugoslav troops, their artillery and tanks are moving back to bases 
across Kosovo in a race to meet a NATO drawback deadline. Philip Smucker 
in Podujevo, Kosovo, reports that in some cases, Western diplomats 
are helping to facilitate the Serb pullbacks by brokering cease-fires 
between Albanian separatists and the Serb security forces. In a display 
of compliance with Western demands for a drawback, Yugoslav tanks 
and heavy artillery are on the move in Kosovo. The redeployment of 
soldiers and heavy equipment is timed to meet a NATO deadline for 
a drawback in forces. Heavily armed Serbian police units have pulled 
out of the Malisevo area, burning bunkers in their wake. Bulldozers 
are knocking down Serbian checkpoints and tanks are rumbling back 
to bases. The movement is being welcomed by ethnic Albanian refugees 
and some guerrilla fighters in the Kosovo Liberation Army, or KLA. 
A UN Security Council resolution requires that the Yugoslav authorities 
remove forces from Kosovo which have in spates engaged in repression 
against the civilian population. NATO has said it is ready to back 
the UN resolution with air strikes if Yugoslavia fails to comply. 
But Western diplomats in Kosovo remain skeptical about the troop movements. 
They believe that the Serbian units might soon be redeployed after 
a NATO deadline for compliance expires late Tuesday. Meanwhile, American 
and European diplomats are racing to broker local cease-fires across 
Kosovo. Those agreements are seen as a means of preventing fighting 
during the harsh Balkan winter. Local accords call for Serbian security 
units to stay out of KLA strongholds and for the guerrillas to stop 
putting up roadblocks. Western diplomats confirmed that some of the 
deals, including one in the Podujevo region of Kosovo, are being formalized 
on paper. Ethnic Albanian guerrillas in the villages around Podujevo 
said that the Serb forces had agreed to stay out of their villages. 
They said that Serbian police units would be allowed to visit their 
stations in the valleys if they live up to the agreement. For their 
part, Serb police officials said they would not enter ethnic Albanian 
villages except in the case that their presence was requested. Philip 
Smucker for VOA News, Podujevo.
