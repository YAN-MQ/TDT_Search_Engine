Two senior NATO generals are to brief NATO ambassadors in Brussels 
today on their efforts to press Yugoslavia to comply with UN demands 
in the Kosovo crisis. The top NATO military officials held talks with 
Yugoslav leaders Saturday and Sunday in Belgrade. U.S. Secretary of 
State Madeleine Albright said she's looking to supreme commander of 
NATO forces General Wesley Clark for accomplishments. The bombing 
is on the books. But I think that what we need to find out is what 
General Clark has been able to accomplish, and that is what we're 
going to be looking at in the next few days. NATO has given Mr. Milosevic 
until Tuesday to comply or face air strikes.
