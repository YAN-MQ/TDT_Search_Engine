In his 1994 magnum opus, ``The Western Canon,'' Harold Bloom placed 
Shakespeare, along with Dante, at the very center of the canon, arguing 
that the two ``excel all other Western writers in cognitive acuity, 
linguistic energy and power of invention.'' The rest, he argued, ``is 
what they absorbed and what absorbs them.'' Bloom's latest book, ``Shakespeare: 
The Invention of the Human,'' is in large measure an amplification 
of the arguments about him set down in that earlier volume, combined 
with a close textual reading of his individual plays. In these pages, 
Bloom, Sterling Professor of Humanities at Yale University and Berg 
Professor of English at New York University, goes so far as to assert 
that Shakespeare ``essentially invented human personality as we continue 
to know and value it.'' ``Before Hamlet taught us not to have faith 
either in language or in ourselves, being human was much simpler for 
us but also rather less interesting,'' Bloom writes. ``Shakespeare, 
through Hamlet, has made us skeptics in our relationships with anyone, 
because we have learned to doubt articulateness in the realm of affection.'' 
He adds that ``our ability to laugh at ourselves as readily as we 
do at others owes much to Falstaff,'' and that Shakespeare's Cleopatra 
has taught us ``how complex eros is, and how impossible it is to divorce 
acting the part of being in love and the reality of being in love.'' 
This eccentric notion _ that we did not know how to be human before 
Shakespeare came along to tell us _ gives Bloom a title and thesis, 
but it thankfully does little to contaminate his book. Indeed, this 
volume is best read as an old-fashioned humanistic commentary on Shakespeare's 
plays that gives us a renewed appreciation of the playwright's staggering 
achievement, even as it points up the limitations of structuralist, 
feminist and neo-historicist readings of his work. It is a fiercely 
argued exegesis of Shakespeare's plays in the tradition of Samuel 
Johnson, Hazlitt and A.C. Bradley, a study that is as passionate as 
it is erudite, as provocative as it is sometimes perverse. While the 
reader may quarrel with Bloom's dismissive treatment of recent productions 
of Shakespeare's plays, while one may disagree with his readings of 
individual characters and texts (his assertion that Shylock is a ``murderous 
villain,'' for instance, is both simplistic and strangely at odds 
with his analysis of the moneylender's ambivalent nature), it's hard 
not to be impressed by his overall knowledge of and insight into his 
subject's work. Bloom deftly illuminates the ideas and motifs animating 
Shakespeare's plays, succinctly shows how the playwright's life (the 
little that we know of it, anyway) appears to have affected his work, 
and astutely analyzes the development of his transcendent art. In 
earlier books like ``The Anxiety of Influence,'' Bloom has articulated 
a Freudian theory of poetic influence, which suggests that writers 
are shaped by their Oedipal struggle to free themselves from the legacy 
of their literary forefathers. That theory clearly informs this volume's 
assessment of Shakespeare's growth and his relationship to his literary 
ancestors Chaucer and Christopher Marlowe. As Bloom sees it, Shakespeare's 
early histories were heavily indebted to Marlowe, an influence he 
parodied and exorcized with the bloody ``Titus Andronicus'' in 1594. 
Once Shakespeare had emancipated himself from the author of ``Tamburlaine,'' 
Bloom continues, his characters began to evolve from two-dimensional 
Marlovian cartoons like Richard III into the emotionally complex heroes 
of his mature work. Hamlet, Falstaff, Rosalind, Othello, Macbeth and 
Cleopatra: such characters possessed an interior life heretofore unseen 
in literature, and they signified Shakespeare's maturation as an original 
artist, an artist who in turn would become a forerunner to writers 
and thinkers as disparate as Kierkegaard, Emerson, Nietzsche, Freud, 
Ibsen, Strindberg, Pirandello and Beckett. Shakespeare apparently 
wrote ``King Lear,'' ``Macbeth'' and ``Antony and Cleopatra'' in a 
fury of composition that spanned a mere 14 months (1605-1606), and 
those plays, Bloom argues, ``conclude the major phase of Shakespeare's 
preoccupation with the inner self.'' His subsequent plays, beginning 
with ``Coriolanus'' in 1608, would contain fewer excursions into the 
human heart. More experimental in form, less intimate in mood, they 
would feature characters who are more symbols or satiric ideograms 
than three-dimensional human beings. With ``Henry VIII'' (one of his 
very last works, written in 1612-13, possibly with John Fletcher), 
Bloom writes, Shakespeare, apparently ``weary of his own genius,'' 
``undoes most of what he had invented.'' Although many critics have 
focused on the redemptive elements in Shakespeare's plays, arguing 
that justice is served on the villains in ``King Lear,'' say, or emphasizing 
the motifs of renewal and resurrection in ``The Winter's Tale,'' Bloom 
takes a bleaker view. In fact, this volume underscores Shakespeare's 
dark, uncompromising vision, his unwavering examination of the consequences 
of time and flux and loss, his acute awareness of the contingency 
of love and reason. Arguing that Shakespeare was probably unhappily 
married, Bloom declares quite highhandedly that ``all Shakespearean 
marriages, comic and otherwise, are zany or grotesque, since essentially 
the women must marry down.'' As for filial and paternal love, he writes, 
``Shakespeare's greatest men and women are pragmatically doom-eager 
not because of their relation to state power but because their inner 
lives are ravaged by all the ambivalences and ambiguities of familial 
love and its displacements.'' In Hamlet's radical alienation, in Iago's 
malign will, in Lear's confrontation with the abyss, in Macbeth's 
apprehension that life is a tale signifying nothing, Bloom suggests, 
are contained the seeds of 19th-century nihilism, Dostoevsky's brooding 
existentialism and Baudelaire's spiritual malaise. In the end, his 
book may not persuade the reader that Shakespeare was somehow responsible 
for ``the invention of the human,'' but it does remind us, powerfully, 
of the uncanny modernity of Shakespeare and his surpassing ability 
not only to limn the human condition but also to illuminate ``our 
latest intellectual fashions more sharply than they can illuminate 
him.'' PUBLICATION NOTES: `SHAKESPEARE' The Invention of the Human
