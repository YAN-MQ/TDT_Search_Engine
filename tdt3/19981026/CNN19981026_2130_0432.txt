He may be at the bottom of the space shuttle discovery crew list, 
but John glenn is in the center of the media spotlight. Today, Glenn 
and the shuttle crew arrived at Kennedy space center to begin final 
preparations for the launch on Thursday. The former senator is assigned 
to be payload specialist number 2, the lowest position on discovery.

body and he's going to enjoy it. It's going to be a completely different 
feeling, I know. But he will adjust, and he's going to exercise, too. 
So I think he is going to be okay. NASA already has begun the countdown 
for this historic mission. Stay with CNN "Headline News" for more 
on Glenn's return to space later in this newscast.
