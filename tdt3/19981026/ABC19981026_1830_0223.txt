Police have not named a suspect in Dr. slepian's murder. We are not 
sure they even have valid clues at this point. What they do have at 
least so they believe, is a pattern of attacks. Living near the border 
have been attacked in the last four years. All of the attacks close 
to Canada's rememberence day. Here's ABC's John Miller. November 10th, 
1995, Dr. Hugh short was watching television at home in ancaster, 
Ontario, when the bullet slammed through the second-floor window and 
shattered his elbow. The shooting of Dr. short was the second sniper 
attack and it told the police they were dealing with a new type of 
anti-abortion violence. In the two decades since the roe v. Wade decision, 
five abortion providers or workers were shot pointblank near their 
homes and offices. In those cases, the attackers knew they would be 
captured quickly. Criminal profilers say the sniper has no intention 
of being caught. This would be what we refer to as an organized assassin, 
an individual who's highly skilled and put a tremendous amount of 
planning into the crime. Sources tell ABC News he deliberately leaves 
behind false clues to confuse police. Like shell casings from a gun 
that does not match the one used in the attack. In this shooting, 
much of the sniper's advance work may have been done for him -- anti-abortion 
web sites like the Christian gallery give abortion providers' descriptions, 
home addresses and numbers. Give abortion providers descriptions, 
home addresses and telephone numbers. The web site is dripping with 
computer-generated blood. The abortion providers are listed as active, 
wounded or with a line through their name, dead. Dr. slepian's name 
was crossed out just hours after the shooting. Activists on the most 
radical end of the pro-life camp make no apologies for the sniper. 
I think the person that did it is a hero. I think they are a hero. 
The FBI, ATF and Canadian police have few clues as to the sniper's 
identity, and if the pattern holds, a year before he strikes. John 
Miller, ABC News.
