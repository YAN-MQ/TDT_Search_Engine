Dr. John Francis Daly, an ear, nose and throat specialist who contributed 
to the development of modern head and neck surgery while associated 
with New York University Medical School and many other regional institutions, 
died last Wednesday at Holy Name Hospital in Teaneck, N.J. A former 
resident of Tenafly, he was 86 and lived in Fort Lee. Daly began in 
head and neck surgery early, when it branched off as a separate medical 
specialty. He wrote extensively on the subject and as a teacher and 
practicing surgeon helped develop new techniques for use in the operating 
room. He was director of otolaryngology, which deals with disorders 
of the ear, nose and throat, at both Bellevue Hospital Center and 
NYU Medical Center from the late 1940s to 1980. At the university, 
he was a professor and chairman of the Department of Otolaryngology 
from 1949 until his retirement in 1980. Daly was born in Jersey City, 
and graduated from Fordham University in 1933. He received his medical 
degree from what is now Downstate Medical Center of the State University 
of New York. He completed his training at the Manhattan Eye, Ear and 
Throat Hospital and Harvard University and served in the Army Air 
Force in World War II. He was a former president of the American Society 
for Head and Neck Surgery, the American Laryngological Association 
and the American Academy of Ophthalmology and Otolaryngology, and 
chairman of the American Medical Association's section on otolaryngology. 
Daly is survived by his wife of 57 years, Annette O'Mealia Daly; a 
daughter, Sharon Ann Butler of Hillsdale, N.J., three grandsons and 
a great-granddaughter.
