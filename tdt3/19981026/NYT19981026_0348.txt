Leading Democrats in Congress have angrily accused officials at the 
White House and the Democratic National Committee of hurting House 
and Senate campaigns by husbanding resources to erase the party's 
debt and help Vice President Al Gore kick off his own campaign in 
2000. The congressional Democrats also assert that top party officials 
are inadvertently discouraging party loyalists from voting, and are 
dampening fund-raising efforts, by making dire predictions that the 
party could lose as many as 25 House seats. The finance chairman of 
the party's Congressional Campaign Committee, Rep. Charles Rangel 
of New York, was so incensed about the party's modest stated goals 
that he had this advice for the party chairman: ``Keep your money 
and shut up your mouth.'' Officials on both sides of the argument 
say the feuding, only one week before Election Day, is a giant distraction 
at a time the party needs to stay focused on a common enemy, the Republicans, 
who are in the final days of the most ambitious party-paid advertising 
campaign in any non-presidential election year. While rifts are common 
within both parties, the current schism among Democrats is unusually 
bitter. And it comes at a time when the usual stakes of an off-year 
election are even higher with the impeachment inquiry pending before 
Congress. Democratic lawmakers say they are particularly furious at 
the national committee, saying it has fallen woefully short of past 
elections in financing efforts to help House and Senate candidates. 
In fact, the Democratic Party has struggled to raise $11 million in 
a highly publicized ``Unity'' program to help candidates this year 
despite an original goal of $18 million. And although the two organizations 
that help finance the party's candidates, the Democratic Congressional 
Campaign Committee and the Democratic Senatorial Campaign Committee, 
wanted to divide the $11 million raised, the party took a third for 
itself. Party officials said they did not have a precise figure of 
how much less the party committees were taking in from the national 
party this year. But, as an example, in the last midterm election, 
in 1994, the party made a direct transfer of $2 million to the Congressional 
Campaign Committee. So far this year, the party had transferred only 
$715,000 to the committee. Democrats in Congress are also angry that 
officials in the party and at the White House have argued publicly 
that, given historical trends, anything less than a 25-seat loss for 
House Democrats would be a victory. Party officials said such remarks 
were intended to lower expectations so even large losses will not 
be interpreted as a referendum on whether President Clinton should 
be impeached. But officials at the senatorial and congressional committees 
complain that such talk is at odds with their own public predictions 
that the Democrats could pick up seats. In an interview on Monday, 
Rangel said he was outraged at recent public comments by Gov. Roy 
Romer of Colorado, the general chairman of the Democratic National 
Committee, that the party could lose many House seats. ``Frankly, 
I don't know what the hell the DNC does _ let him do what he has to 
do for the president,'' Rangel said of Romer. ``He's not elected to 
a damn thing. And nobody should give a damn about his opinion. He's 
not entitled to an opinion of congressional races. He's an appointee. 
It happens to all of us. You get on television and you become an expert.'' 
Accusing the Democratic National Committee of being stingy, he said: 
``Keep your money and shut up your mouth. What damn credibility has 
he got as governor of Colorado? He just should shut up.'' ``Is it 
like the whole world is waiting to see what's going to happen in November 
based on the governor's evaluation of congressional seats?'' Rangel 
continued. ``Give me a break!'' Party officials, he said, ``suck up 
the money.'' Rangel was so infuriated that he upbraided Romer in a 
telephone conversation on Thursday. ``Rangel was exactly correct to 
call Romer on that,'' said Rep. Martin Frost of Texas, chairman of 
the Democratic Congressional Campaign Committee. ``Romer is simply 
wrong. We're going to pick up seats.'' The party, he said, has been 
so starved for money that ``we told our candidates they couldn't rely 
on the national party coming in and helping them _ they had to put 
it together themselves.'' The Democratic National Committee has been 
so unhelpful, Frost added, that his own committee ``has taken the 
role that historically the DNC would have filled in some areas.'' 
Romer responded by accusing the party's Democratic leaders of ``misplaced 
grousing.'' He said, ``We were $15 million in debt. We borrowed as 
much as our banks would loan us, to be honest about it.'' He also 
said the party had to spend more than $12 million in legal bills related 
to campaign finance investigations of the 1996 campaign. Asked about 
Rangel's comments, he said, ``Charlie is concerned that when he is 
out motivating his troops he wants to say, `We're going to win the 
majority back.' That's what you say when you're out there on stump. 
But if I'm going to keep my credibility, I can't give you campaign 
rhetoric and say, `that's my expectation.' I want them to win a majority. 
That's just a hard reach.'' In all but one midterm election since 
the Civil War, the party of the president has lost ground in the House 
of Representative, from two to 96 seats. Several House Democratic 
officials _ including backers of Rep. Dick Gephardt, the minority 
leader, who is considering running for president _ suggested that 
the White House was sitting on money so the party would be well-positioned 
to help Gore run for president. Douglas Sosnik, a senior White House 
adviser, disputed that Clinton has been inattentive to the financial 
needs of candidates. ``The president has spent a tremendous amount 
of time fund raising on behalf of House and Senate candidates for 
the past two years,'' he said. ``If you have any doubts, look up how 
many articles have been written about how much time he has spent going 
to fund raisers.'' Another top White House official said the congressional 
Democrats were too demanding _ and unrealistic. ``They're whining,'' 
said the official, who spoke on the condition of anonymity. ``Everybody 
wants more money, and they're just looking for someone to blame.'' 
At the core of the clashes are competing interests at the highest 
levels of the Democratic Party. They are in some ways an escalation 
of strains from 1994 when congressional Democrats accused Clinton 
of costing them control of the House, and 1996, when they said he 
did not do enough to help the party try to regain the House. ``It's 
unfortunate that the leaders of the party can't get together and agree 
on a single approach to these last weeks,'' said Mark Mellman, a Democratic 
pollster whose clients include Gephardt and Sen. Tom Daschle of South 
Dakota, the Senate Democratic leader. ``All these committees are united 
in wanting to help Democrats. But the political imperatives work in 
different directions for different elements of the Democratic Party, 
whether you're talking about how money should be spent or how expectations 
should be set.'' Several state Democratic leaders have also complained 
that they need more money, particularly since the Republican Party 
has outraised the Democrats by tens of millions of dollars in this 
election. ``It's never enough and we need more,'' said Art Torres, 
chairman of the California Democratic Party. ``My only frame of reference 
is '96. It was much more generous last time, but that was a presidential 
year.'' Torres added that he understands ``it's really tough when 
you're in the middle of a campaign to make sure you take care of your 
party as well as the debt.'' To compensate for the shortfall in fund 
raising for the Unity program, the party took out a $3 million loan 
last month that was divided between the campaign committees. But on 
a conference call with Clinton last month, party officials said, Congressional 
Democrats had asked for $8 million. Participating in the call, the 
officials said, were Gephardt, Daschle and Frost. Romer said he has 
no apologies for not raising more money. ``We've put the well dry,'' 
he said, adding that banks refused to loan the cash-strapped party 
any more money. But Rangel was not impressed. ``He's a nice person,'' 
he said of the governor. ``When he's quiet.''
