This is meteorologist Valerie Voss with your "Headline News weather 
forecast" for Tuesday. It will be quiet across a lot of the nation, 
with high pressure hanging on in the southeastern part of the country. 
However, a strong storm moving through the four corners region is 
producing some thunderstorms from Arizona to New Mexico and west Texas 
by Tuesday evening. Some showers will push out into the plains states 
and we will see snow in the higher elevations of Colorado, quite a 
bit in fact, above about 8,000 feet. A cold front in the northwest 
will keep some clouds and rain across that region. Tuesday's high 
temperatures, 40s and 50s for the northern half of the country, 60s 
around the Great Lakes, 80s around the gulf coast. Looking ahead to 
Wednesday, rain and snow over the northern Rockies, rain in the northwest 
and northeast. For Thursday, a mix of rain and snow through the north 
central U.S., rain showers continue in the northwest. On Friday more 
showers northwest, with rain and thunderstorms through the plains 
states. Don't forget, four-day forecasts for more than 7,200 cities
