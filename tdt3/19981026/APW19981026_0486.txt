Going into the final race of the year with the Formula One championship 
at stake, Finnish driver Mika Hakkinen said he is surprised at how 
little stress he feels. ``Sometimes the pressure can make you more 
nervous and tired,'' the series leader said Monday. ``But I don't 
have that. I feel good. I believe it's because of the confidence I 
have in myself in terms of driving and my confidence in the team.'' 
Hakkinen holds a four-point lead over Ferrari's Michael Schumacher 
going into Sunday's season-ending Japanese Grand Prix. All he needs 
to do is finish second to claim his first title and give McLaren the 
drivers and constructors championships for the first time since 1991. 
``To go into this final grand prix in a position where you can actually 
finish second, it's a luxury, it's unbelievable,'' Hakkinen said at 
a news conference. To stop him, Ferrari is counting on Schumacher 
finishing first and anyone but Hakkinen finishing second. Schumacher 
would clinch his third world title if he wins and Hakkinen does not 
place better than third. Schumacher can also win the series championship 
if he finishes second at Suzuka and Hakkinen is out of the top six. 
But Hakkinen said he's not thinking about such outcomes. ``I don't 
think `what if something goes wrong?' I think that everything should 
go right, and I feel good. I feel comfortable,'' he said. And he's 
got good reason to be confident. The Finn has won seven of 15 races 
this year in his silver McLaren, including the Grand Prix of Luxembourg 
five weeks ago. Since then, Hakkinen has tested in Barcelona, Spain; 
Magny-Cours, France; and Silverstone, England. Much of the focus has 
been on Bridgestone's selection of wet-weather tires. Hakkinen has 
also had about seven days off, including a trip back to Finland, he 
said. No matter the outcome of Sunday's race, Hakkinen said it has 
been an exciting year. ``We are in the last Grand Prix where the decision 
is who is going to be world champion. I think we can look back very 
positively. This has been a great year.''
