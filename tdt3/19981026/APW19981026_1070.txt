The European Union on Monday said EU monitors will make up about two-thirds 
of the 2,000-strong unarmed ground force verifying compliance with 
the Kosovo peace agreement. In Vienna, Austria, the Organization for 
Security and Cooperation in Europe on Sunday formally established 
the Kosovo Verification Mission (KVM), hours after the U.N. Security 
Council approved it. A Security Council resolution adopted late Saturday 
endorsed the agreement to allow the unarmed monitors to patrol Kosovo 
and to let NATO verify from the air that fighting stopped. The Security 
Council demanded that Yugoslavia abide by the accord to end fighting 
in Kosovo and said action may be needed to ensure the safety of the 
international monitors. In Luxembourg Monday, Austrian Foreign Minister 
Wolfgang Schuessel listed the number of participants EU countries 
have said they will commit: Britain 200, Germany 200, Italy 150 to 
200, France 150 to 200, Portugal 30, Sweden 80, Luxembourg 12 and 
50 each from Greece, Austria and Denmark. No figures were given for 
the other five countries in the EU.
