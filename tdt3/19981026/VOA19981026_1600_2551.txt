The international community seems to be seeking a way of regulating 
the type of disruptive capital withdrawals that Mr. Lighten suggests 
helped trigger Asia's financial crisis. However, correspondent Barry 
Wood reports there is some debate about how effective such capital 
controls would be. Critics of unregulated private flows say the withdrawal 
of perhaps $100 billion from Asian markets over the past year greatly 
aggravated and perhaps caused the region's financial and economic 
crisis. Prior to 1997, Asia was attracting private capital flows of 
well over $50 billion annually. Much of that money went into productive 
capital investment. Other inflows were more speculative, going into 
stock markets from which they were quickly withdrawn once the crisis 
hit. Much criticism is directed at hedge funds, the mostly speculative 
mutual funds for rich investors which seek quick profits in emerging 
markets. Donald Tsang, Hong Kong's financial secretary, is particularly 
critical of the way hedge funds operate. What I'm asking are that 
we should do is to collect more information about these funds, which 
will require greater transparency and disclosure by the bankers who 
will finance these hedge funds. We want to make sure the lending institutions 
are behaving prudently so that it will not put investors' interest 
at stake. While sympathetic to the problem of disruptive capital flows, 
U.S. central bank chief Alan Greenspan is skeptical about whether 
they can be effectively controlled. He says if the United States imposes 
regulations on hedge funds, they are likely simply to move their operations 
to places where there are no controls.
