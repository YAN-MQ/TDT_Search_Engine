PRI, Public Radio International. You are listening to THE WORLD on 
91 FM. Coming up on tonight's program, Germany's new government pledges 
to phase out nuclear weapons. Also, lightning shocks a soccer match 
in South Africa. The forecast from the Franklin Institute calls for 
partly to mostly cloud skies tonight, low 47. Tuesday, clouds and 
occasional sun, a cooler, high 63. And the on Wednesday, partly to 
mostly sunny, warmer, high near 70 degrees. This is 91 fm, whyy. Hello, 
this is Bill Osborne from WHYY's Delaware Broadcast Center. Thanks 
so much for making a pledge during 91 FM's fall pledge drive. When 
you receive your pledge form, please drop your check in the mail then 
sit back, relax, and enjoy Public Radio at its best.
