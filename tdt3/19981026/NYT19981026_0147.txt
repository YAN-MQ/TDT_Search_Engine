Have you noticed the paucity of poetry in American public life, especially 
in headlines? The Poetic Allusion Watch (PAW), once an annual event 
in this space, has been shut out for lack of examples. The last good 
entry submitted is from Donald Marks of New York, citing a headline 
in the science section of The New York Times over a story about snakes 
in Venezuela: ``Splendor in the Mud: Unraveling the Lives of Anacondas.'' 
The allusion is to Wordsworth's ``Intimations of Immortality,'' written 
between 1802 and 1807: ``Though nothing can bring back the hour/ Of 
splendor in the grass, of glory in the flower.'' And a couple of years 
ago, my colleague Anthony Lewis headlined a diatribe at ``radical 
Republicans'' who would leave social programs unfinanced as ``Bare 
Ruined Choirs.'' That comes from Shakespeare's Sonnet 73 about the 
late autumn of life when the leafless boughs of trees become ``bare 
ruined choirs where late the sweet birds sang.'' To stimulate an alertness 
to allusion, MAW was founded: the Musical Allusion Watch, to detect 
veiled references to lyrics of popular tunes. Deborah Stapleton of 
Mountain View, Calif., noted a Wall Street Journal headline over a 
story about English environmentalists trying to preserve traditional 
hedgerows: ``If There's a Bustle in Your Hedgerow, Don't Be Alarmed.'' 
This is a line from the 1971 Led Zeppelin song ``Stairway to Heaven.'' 
Ms Stapleton suggests: ``The headline writer must have been bursting 
with baby-boomer pride. When handed a story about guarding hedgerows, 
he or she found a perfect opportunity to communicate to the Wall Street 
establishment through lines sung in youth, often in an altered state 
of mind. `Too weird,' as we might have said back then.'' With both 
PAW and MAW in a depression this year, what hope can we find for the 
return of a sweet-seasoned shower of civilized discourse? In an unexpected 
place: Resonances of our great traditions of lyric language can be 
heard in the political impeachment process. At a historic moment in 
the House of Representatives, Henry Hyde, white-haired chairman of 
the Judiciary Committee, rose to rebut a charge that he was going 
to allow the investigation to roll on for years. ``Let me suggest 
to you,'' he told his colleagues, ``who think this is going to go 
on, like Tennyson's brook, just on and on.'' PAW members forget what 
he said after that, because we were turning from the passions of the 
moment to Alfred Lord Tennyson's 1855 ``The Brook.'' It begins, ``I 
come from haunts of coot and hern,/ I make a sudden sally,/ And sparkle 
out among the fern,/ To bicker down a valley.'' The poem's last stanza: 
``And out again I curve and flow/ To join the brimming river; /For 
men may come and men may go,/ But I go on for ever.'' Hyde, by the 
way, has been referred to as a ``Solomonic Solon.'' This is an amalgam 
of two eponyms: Solomon was an ancient Hebrew king noted for both 
his infant-splitting judicial gimmick and the world-weary wisdom of 
Ecclesiastes, while Solon was a humane Athenian lawgiver who reformed 
the harsh code of Draco. Not all poetic-sounding phrases that resonate 
are allusions to poetry or musical lyrics, of course; some are rooted 
in dialectical metaphor. ``In other days in the capital,'' intones 
a New York Times editorial, ``the president could summon ... wise 
and disinterested elders who, as the saying goes, had heard the owl 
and seen the elephant.'' Although the authorship of newspaper editorials 
is always shrouded in institutional secrecy, a demonstrable need to 
know enabled me to get the lowdown from a member of the editorial 
board of the Suthrin persuasion: ``Just heard heard the owl and seen 
the elephant down South as a reference to people seasoned to wisdom 
by wide experience.'' Deeper digging unearths an 1835 use by the Southwestern 
humorist Augustus Baldwin Longstreet: ``That's sufficient, as Tom 
Haynes said when he saw the elephant.'' And a 1936 dictionary of cowboy 
lingo reported, ``To have many and varied experiences was to `hear 
the owl hoot.''' SCHWONK? In the nefarious tapings often churned up 
by investigations can be found the language as she is spoken. Here 
is a passage from the tape recordings released by the House Judiciary 
Committee. Linda Tripp, the faithless friend, says to Monica Lewinsky 
about the president, ``Right now I think he's a schwonk.'' This qualifies 
as what biblical exegetes call a hapax legomenon, the only known use 
in print, which makes it difficult to define. ``Unfortunately, Ms 
Lewinsky never addressed the schwonk word in response,'' writes Evelyn 
Brody of Chicago, ``but it sounds to me like the Yiddish version of 
`policy wonk' _ preceded by whatever word starting in sch you prefer, 
from schmuck to schlemazel.'' We have already defined schmuck in this 
space as having lost its original taboo sense to now mean ``jerk.'' 
A schlemazel is a ``loser.'' The shooshing sound at the beginning 
of a word has come to suggest derogation. This brings us to wonk. 
The Oxford English Dictionary's first sense from 1900 is ``yellow 
dog,'' from the Chinese huang (``yellow'') gou (``dog''). (No, we 
will not go into yellow dog Democrat or the fund raising of John Huang 
in a language column.) Wonk was soon applied as a term of contempt 
for young naval cadets. In the 1960s, it replaced ``meatball'' and 
``grind'' as a putdown of an excessively studious student. Here's 
a touch of irony: The phrase policy wonk, now widely used to describe 
serious-minded politicians with too great a grasp of minutiae, was 
coined in a 1984 New Republic article, referring with scorn to Sen. 
Walter Mondale's ``thralldom to the policy wonks and wise men of the 
Washington establishment.'' The coiner was Sidney Blumenthal, now 
the White House aide who reported that President Clinton thought of 
Ms Lewinsky as being a stalker, meaning ``relentless groupie.'' We 
will have to await Ms Tripp's memoirs, or her appearance before a 
congressional panel, to see if she considers Coiner Blumenthal a schwonk, 
whatever it means.
