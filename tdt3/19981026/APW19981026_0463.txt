President Frederick Chiluba made an impassioned plea for peace in 
the embattled Congo on Monday as he opened an acrimonious meeting 
of African defense and foreign ministers aimed at ending the war. 
``You stand at the cutting edge, a defining moment ... to determine 
whether Africa has got the political will and determination to end 
the war in the Congo,'' Chiluba said. Rebels fighting to topple Congolese 
President Laurent Kabila were present, but Congolese officials planned 
to snub them. Kabila insists the rebels are puppets of Rwanda and 
Uganda who allegedly are backing them with invading forces. ``To ask 
us to talk to those people would be very dangerous because the real 
rebels are Rwanda and Uganda,'' he told reporters. Rwanda has denied 
it has troops in Congo. Zimbabwe Foreign Minister Stan Mudenge accused 
Rwandan Foreign Minister Anastase Gasana of lying and described him 
as ``a rude, naughty little boy who needs his ears pinched.'' Uganda 
says it has dispatched troops to Congo to strike at Congo-based Ugandan 
rebels. Chiluba tasked the ministers from 12 mostly southern African 
nations, along with observers from Libya, with finding ``a quiet, 
reasoned settlement of pertinent issues'' obstructing an end to the 
Congo war. Salim Ahmed Salim, secretary-general of the continent-wide 
Organization of African Unity, said that if the talks fail, it would 
be ``another collective indictment of all of us as Africans.'' Previous 
talks aimed at ending the fighting which erupted in August ended in 
failure. Salim said the meeting will seek an immediate cessation of 
hostilities, a timetable for the withdrawal of all foreign troops 
from Congo and try to address security concerns of Congo's neighbors. 
Rwanda and Uganda faced off at the talks against Kabila and his southern 
African military allies _ Angola, Namibia and Zimbabwe. Also present 
were South Africa _ which has launched its own peace initiative by 
holding talks with Rwanda, Uganda and the rebels _ and Kenya, Mozambique 
and Tanzania which have refused to support military intervention. 
Gabon represented French-speaking central and west Africa, with Zambia 
the neutral chair. Last week, Zimbabwe, Angola and Namibia announced 
an offensive against rebel strongholds in the dense jungles of eastern 
Congo. Zimbabwe dispatched more than 2,000 extra troops to support 
3,000 already fighting with Kabila's forces. Namibia now has between 
600 to 1,000 troops in Congo, according to past media reports. Angola 
has about 1,000 troops. The number of troops to be added in the new 
offensive was not known. Previously, Kabila's allies were concentrated 
in western Congo, where they fended off a rebel onslaught on the capital, 
Kinshasa. The Congolese rebels _ ethnic Tutsis, disenchanted members 
of Kabila's army and opposition politicians _ accuse Kabila of corruption, 
mismanagement and promoting tribalism.
