Sir Paul McCartney said Monday that every woman should make screening 
for breast cancer a priority. ''Unfortunately in Linda's case, we 
really got to it too late,'' McCartney said during an interview on 
ITN television. Linda McCartney died in April at the McCartney family's 
Arizona ranch after suffering from breast cancer. She was 56. ``Although 
we had two-and-a-half years of treatment it really turned out to be 
nothing much we could have done about it,'' the former Beatles star 
said. His interview coincided with the release of Wide Prairie, an 
album of solo songs recorded by Linda McCartney over the last 25 years. 
``Even though you think you may be being a bit too fussy, or even 
though the doctor tells you you're being a bit too fussy, it's worth 
getting it checked, because the sooner you get to it the more they 
can do about it,'' McCartney said. ``So if there's any chance that 
you might have it, get checks, that's the main thing.''
