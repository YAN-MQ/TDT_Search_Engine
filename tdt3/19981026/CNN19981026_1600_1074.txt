Three New York City area medical groups representing 3150 doctors 
are suing oxford health plans for 1.1 billion. And they say Oxford 
owes them millions of dollars in back-pay. Oxford concedes it stopped 
paying the medical groups in August, but says it started paying the 
doctors directly. Oxford also says the amounts withheld from the groups 
totals less than 5 million. Oxford shares lost 5/8 at 9 /16.
