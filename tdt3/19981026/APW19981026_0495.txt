Peru and Ecuador signed a historic peace treaty Monday, ending a 57-year 
dispute over a slice of Amazon jungle that brought them to war three 
times. As dignitaries from three continents looked on, the foreign 
ministers of the two South American nations signed the accord in Brazil's 
capital, where most of the peace talks took place. The treaty sets 
the boundary on a contested 48-mile (78 km) section of their border 
in the Andean foothills. Both laid claim to the jungle-cloaked area 
that was left undefined in the 1942 Rio de Janeiro Protocol that set 
territorial limits. Presidents Alberto Fujimori of Peru and Jamil 
Mahuad of Ecuador looked on from a dais, sitting on either side of 
Brazilian President Fernando Henrique Cardoso. They were accompanied 
by Presidents Eduardo Frei of Chile, Carlos Menem of Argentina, Hugo 
Banzer of Bolivia and Andres Pastrana of Colombia. King Juan Carlos 
and Queen Sofia of Spain also attended, while the United States was 
represented by U.S. envoy Luigi Einaudi and Thomas ``Mack'' McLarty, 
a former aide to U.S. President Bill Clinton. ``It's been a good week 
for peace accords, with Ireland and Israel and now this,'' said McLarty. 
``Hopefully, Kosovo will move forward in the near term.''
