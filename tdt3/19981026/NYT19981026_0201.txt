Q. (italics)I have heard that all the stars we can see with the naked 
eye, except for a few faint nebulae, are part of our own galaxy. If 
that is so, why aren't the visible stars confined to the Milky Way 
band?(end italics) A. ``The filmy band of light that we perceive in 
the sky as the Milky Way does contain the bulk of the stars in our 
galaxy,'' said Joe Rao, lecturer at the Hayden Planetarium of the 
American Museum of Natural History, but viewers on Earth have a clear 
view of some individual neighbors, which are in a different part of 
the galaxy. Earth is imbedded in one of the spiral arms of this galaxy, 
about two-thirds of the way from its center to the far edge, he explained. 
As a result, all the stars in Earth's general vicinity, or at least 
those within a few thousand light-years, are seen strewn all around 
the night sky. Any faint nebulae seen with the unaided eye are actually 
part of Earth's home galaxy as well, Rao said. The naked-eye objects 
that are outside the Milky Way are its two satellite galaxies, known 
as the Large and Small Magellanic Clouds, sometimes called Nebecula 
Major and Nebecula Minor; the Andromeda Galaxy, and (in very dark 
skies, for very sharp eyes) the Pinwheel Galaxy, M33, in the constellation 
Triangulum. Early in this century, when the true nature of these objects 
was unknown, they were referred to as ``spiral nebulae.'' Readers
