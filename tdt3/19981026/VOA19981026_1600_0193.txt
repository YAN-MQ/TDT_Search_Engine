Germany's newly elected parliament -- the federal assembly, or bundestag 
-- held its open meeting in Bonn Monday, and the country is preparing 
for the swearing in of its new chancellor, Gerhard Schroeder on Tuesday. 
Suzanne Kelly reports from Bonn. Monday was Helmut Kohl's last day 
of work as Germany's chancellor. In ceremonies to mark his departure, 
the 68-year-old leader was presented with a customary letter of discharge 
by German president Roman Herzog but was also honored with the Grand 
Cross, one of the country's highest civilian awards. Mr. Kohl's Christian 
Democrats were defeated by Germany's Social Democrats, the SPD, in 
elections on September 27. After three weeks of negotiations, a new 
coalition government of the SPD and Germany's environmental Greens 
Party is ready to take control. Mr. Schroeder's first cabinet meeting 
will come on Tuesday evening. His promise that among his first orders 
of business will be finding ways to lower Germany's more than 10 percent 
unemployment rate. Suzanne Kelly for VOA News, Bonn.
