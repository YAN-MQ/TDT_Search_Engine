The chief UN weapons inspector says tests by American, French and 
Swiss laboratories provide conclusive evidence that Iraq put nerve 
gas in missile warheads. The inspector says the French and Swiss tests 
found decontamination products on the fragments, suggesting Iraq may 
have tried to clean the warheads before the samples were taken to 
the labs. Iraq denies it put the deadly VX nerve gas into missile 
warheads.
