NATIONAL FORECAST The merging of two large high-pressure systems over 
the East will meet with some resistance as a disturbance at 15,000 
feet over Lake Ontario migrates toward the southeast. The combination 
of onshore winds along the New England Coast and mid-atmospheric moisture 
streaming in from Canada will produce variable clouds and a few sprinkles 
over the northern Appalachians and in southern New England. Maine 
will be bright and cool while the Middle Atlantic region will have 
streamers of clouds, but it will be seasonable. Much of the Southeast 
will be sunny and pleasantly warm as high pressure settles over the 
Tennessee Valley. Onshore winds in Florida will bring in ocean clouds 
and scattered showers, mainly from Orlando southward. Intense Hurricane 
Mitch, with central winds near 180 mph, will approach the Yucatan 
peninsula late in the day. A cluster of clouds and showers will weaken 
as it moves through the Middle West. Winds from the southwest will 
draw mild, humid air into the region. A cold front will progress through 
the northeast Plains with just some clouds and shifting winds. Clouds 
and showers will keep temperatures below seasonal levels in the eastern 
and central Rockies. A few strong afternoon thunderstorms may form 
in western Texas. High pressure near Montana will promote bright but 
cooler conditions. California and the deserts of the Southwest will 
become mainly sunny and not as cool as in recent days. A cold front 
will push inland across the Northwest late in the day with windswept 
showers spreading into western Washington and Oregon. Focus: Monster 
Storm A hurricane hunter aircraft investigating Hurricane Mitch in 
the northwest Caribbean Sea on Monday found one of the most powerful 
hurricanes to ever roam the Atlantic Ocean. With winds near 180 mph 
and a central pressure of 26.72 inches of mercury, Hurricane Mitch 
was classified as a catastrophic Category Five storm on the Saffir/Simpson 
hurricane scale. Only a few other Atlantic storms have reached this 
intensity. The strongest, and most recent, Hurricane Gilbert, attained 
winds of 185 mph and a pressure of 26.22 inches of mercury in nearly 
the same location during September 1988.
