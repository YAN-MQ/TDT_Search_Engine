European Union leaders have ended their informal two-day meeting in 
Austria with broad agreement on doing what they can to prevent a global 
financial crisis. Officials from the 15 countries gathered to coordinate 
policies as full European integration grows near. British prime minister 
Tony Blair says deflation, not inflation, is a major global problem, 
and interest rate cuts would be helpful. The balance of risk in the 
world economy has plainly shifted from inflation to deflation, and 
everyone is cognizant of that and realizes that has policy implications. 
But at the same time, there was a very clear mood here that though 
it is important to discuss economic -- policy and economic coordination, 
we do that without, in any way, interfering the independence of the 
central banks. Mr. Blair says he'll be willing to host a Group of 
Seven summit on reform in the global financial system. The British 
prime minister is the current G-7 chairman.
