Moderate nationalists have won a parliamentary election in Spain's 
Basque region now enjoying peace after 30 years of violence. The Basque 
Nationalist Party will hold onto power in the 75-seat legislature 
despite losing two seats. The election was held five weeks after the 
armed separatists Eta declared a cease-fire in its war for an independent 
Basque homeland. Reports from Madrid say a truce declared by Eta could 
mean these elections will lead to a lasting peace in the Basque country.
