The State Department had nothing but praise for Israeli Prime Minister 
Benjamin Netanyahu on a day when he faced opposition at home for signing 
the land-for-peace deal with the Palestinians. NPR's Craig Windham 
reports. State Department spokesman James Rubin said Netanyahu had 
shown courage, skill, and defectiveness in the negotiations that led 
to the agreement. Rubin added that the administration looks forward 
to continuing to work with the prime minister. Rubin insisted that 
he was not taking sides in Israeli politics, just registering confidence 
in Netanyahu's ability to garner support for the peace accord. Next 
week, negotiators will begin work on a final version of the interim 
agreement that was signed at the White House. Rubin used strong language 
to discourage Israel from adding settlements on the West Bank and 
the Palestinians from declaring an independent state on their own. 
Rubin said, "Those who believe they can take unilateral acts when 
the interim period ends are courting disaster." Craig Windham, NPR 
News, Washington.
