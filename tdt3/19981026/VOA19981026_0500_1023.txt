Typhoon Babs has been downgraded to a tropical storm but still carries 
heavy rains and high winds as it heads towards Hong Kong. The city 
is under a cyclone warning, with forecasters expecting Babs to pass 
about 200 kilometers east of Hong Kong on its way to the south China 
coast. As a typhoon, Babs left 150 people dead in the Philippines. 
A state of emergency has been declared in four provinces there. In 
Taiwan, heavy rains caused hundreds of people to evacuate their homes. 
Hundreds of others were trapped by landslides in the central mountains.
