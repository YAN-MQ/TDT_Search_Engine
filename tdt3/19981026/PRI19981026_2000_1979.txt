Art dealers from around the world have gathered in Paris for an auction 
of so far unseen works by Pablo Picasso. The works come from a private 
collection kept in a bank vault by Picasso's onetime mistress, Dora 
Marr. She died last year as a virtual recluse. It's thought that the 
scale could fetch at least $30 million, rather sale. The most important 
of seven oil paintings up for auction is "The Weeping Woman." From 
the BBC Newsroom in London, this is Pamela McCall. You're listening 
to THE WORLD.
