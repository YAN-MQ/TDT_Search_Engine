With "Headline Sports," I'm Russell Biven. The chiefs are trying to 
bounce back from a loss two weeks ago in New England. Tonight they 
are battling Pittsburgh. The season's first bowl championship standings 
have been released. UCLA has the top spot. Ohio state takes two. The 
buckeyes have held number one since preseason. They factor in many 
other things. The top two teams at the end of the season will be in 
the fiesta bowl for the national championship. Everybody what they 
are playing for, is to be in the top two spots to go to the bowl and 
play. That's kind of out of our hands. We're doing all we can on the 
field to put ourselves in a position like that.
