The Spice Girls' secrets are safe, at least for now. SPICE GIRLS If 
you want to be my lover, you've got to get with my plan. Making love 
forever. Friendship never ends. If you want to be my lover, you have 
got to give. Taking it too easy. But that's the way it is. If you 
want to be my lover, you got to, you got to, you got to... The Spice 
Girls are breathing a bit easier these days. The group's former chauffeur 
has lost his bid to overturn a court order blocking him from disclosing 
any information about the pop group in a spicy book that he wants 
to write. Band members first went to court after Paul Attridge wrote 
a newspaper story speculating why Ginger Spice had left the band. 
At the time, Atrridge was ordered not to release any details about 
the Spice Girls' love lives, their business affairs or spending habits. 
He went to court to overturn the injunction so he could write the 
book. Attridge now says he'll fight on.
