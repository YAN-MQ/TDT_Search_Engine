The wife of Malaysia's jailed dissident leader said Monday violent 
riots over the weekend were sparked by growing frustration with police 
brutality and the 17-year rule of Prime Minister Mahathir Mohamad. 
An anti-government protest at a mosque in Kuala Lumpur Saturday night 
turned into a violent clash when police lobbed tear gas and shot chemical-laced 
water jets into the Muslim house of worship as demonstrators hurled 
stones and bricks. It was the first time demonstrators had retaliated 
against police, who have banned rallies supporting ousted deputy prime 
minister Anwar Ibrahim. Police arrested 268 people for rioting. Some 
appeared to be weekend shoppers caught in the middle of the afternoon 
demonstration. Anwar's wife, Azizah Ismail, called the rioting ``a 
violent tragedy,'' and a ``manifestation of the people's anger toward 
Dr. Mahathir, which could not be contained any longer.'' She warned 
that more disruptions could break out. ``They have no other avenue,'' 
Azizah told reporters, adding she believed demonstrators acted out 
of self-defense after being provoked by riot police. ``Trouble may 
probably occur if the people have to defend themselves from the brutal 
actions of the riot squad.'' Peaceful anti-government demonstrations 
have gained momentum since Anwar's arrest Sept. 20. Thousands have 
mobbed the streets of the capital in what have become weekly Saturday 
affairs, demanding the resignation of the 72-year-old Mahathir. Mahathir 
fired Anwar as his deputy Sept. 2, saying his former protege was morally 
unfit to lead. Anwar goes on trial Nov. 2 on 10 charges of corruption 
and illegal homosexual acts, which he says were trumped up to stem 
his rising popularity. On Saturday, protesters and police blamed each 
other for coming to blows. Police said they spotted protesters with 
homemade explosives, and violence started when some threw stones. 
Protesters said that police fired first. Azizah, who was appointed 
by Anwar to lead his reform movement while he is in custody, denied 
any role in organizing Saturday's protests. ``Neither I nor Anwar 
Ibrahim has ever directed, asked or urged the people to hold any kind 
of illegal gathering, what's more, to instruct the people to act violently 
while destroying public property,'' Azizah said. ``This is a total 
contradiction to what we stand for.'' Anwar's case drew concern from 
the United States, Australia and many Southeast Asian neighbors when 
he appeared in court with a black eye and bruised right arm. Anwar 
said the injuries resulted from a police beating. On Monday, Chris 
Patten, Hong Kong's last colonial governor, voiced his support for 
Anwar, while his wife paid a house call to Azizah. ``He is a friend 
of mine and to many around the world,'' Patten told a group of international 
editors. ``The whole world will be watching what happens in his case.'' 
Patten compared Anwar to Myanmar's dissident leader Aung San Suu Kyi, 
winner of the Nobel Peace Prize. He said the two represented ``the 
best Asian arguments for universality of values ... that freedom and 
democracy aren't merely Western values.'' Mahathir, meanwhile, accused 
Anwar of instigating Saturday's street protests in hopes of toppling 
Asia's longest-serving ruler. ``We cannot be brought down by demonstrations 
in the streets,'' said Mahathir, who spoke after Patten at the same 
conference. The city's police chief, Kamarrudin Ali, called the Saturday 
riot ``the most serious incident to date.'' ``We have no choice but 
to take stern action against them. If their actions are left unchecked, 
innocent bystanders might fall victim,'' the police chief said Sunday.
