The last word tonight goes to the last man who walked on the Moon. 
On Thursday, for our live coverage of the launch we will have several 
of the country's most famous astronauts with us to talk about the 
future and, of course, to reminisce. One of them is an old friend 
and longtime ABC commentator, Gene cernan. This has got to be one 
of the proudest moments of my life. I remember when I was a kid flying 
airplanes off aircraft carriers, when I heard President Kennedy said, 
"we're going to go to the Moon." Minus 30 seconds. It may be another 
50 or 100 years before people realize and look back this millennium 
at what we did and realize the significance and importance of it. 
I am not sure we do yet. It has been a long time since we were so 
focused. So remind us again what it was like. To sit on top of the 
"Saturn V" -- at night, 38 stories high. 7.5 million pounds of thrust. 
It's taken me 25 years to put that story in words. So put it in words. 
It's a love affair with a beast, a beautiful beast. Did you always 
have complete and utter faith in the hardware? We, we did. I think 
we had more faith in the people that were putting it together. You 
are go for orbit. Thanks to yours and others' splendid photography, 
we've all seen the earth from the surface of the Moon. The thing I 
remember most is looking back at earth. It's the most overpowering 
experience I think I've ever had. It's home. It's what we understand. 
We would like you to leave immediately. Millions of us just sat there 
holding our breath waiting to see whether the lunar Module would fly 
and you'd get off the surface. That's a very hectic moment. Three, 
two, one. You only get one shot at it. We had about seven seconds 
margin What were those famous words you said when you left the Moon? 
We now leave as we once came. We shall return. For all mankind. The 
crew of Apollo 17. Just before we started that ten, nine, eight, countdown, 
I looked over and jack and said are we ready? I said we're ready. 
Lets get this mother out of here. We are going to put that on the 
air.
