Serbian police have raided an independent daily newspaper, the Deneve 
Telegraf in Yugoslavia's latest crackdown of publishers critical of 
president Slobodan Milosevic. Police in Belgrade seized office and 
printing equipment, preventing the newspaper from printing its Monday 
edition. The newspaper's publisher had been ordered to pay a fine 
for alleged anti-state activity. Police also surrounded the publisher's 
apartment building, apparently ready to seize his property to enforce 
another court-ordered fine of $240,000 imposed for alleged violations 
of the constitution. The raid comes just days after Serbian law makers 
adopted a new media law imposing restrictions on what can be published 
or broadcast.
