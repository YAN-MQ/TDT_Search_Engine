The already troubled show between Prince Naseem Hamed and Wayne McCullough 
hit another bump Monday. Hamed remained in Sheffield, England, while 
his U.S.-based promoter, Cedric Kushner, scrambled to get him a last-minute 
visa so that the featherweight sensation could box in Atlantic City, 
N.J., on Saturday night. Kushner said that a visa for Hamed had been 
secured as of Monday night and that Hamed was supposed to pick it 
up at the U.S. Consulate in London and then board the Concorde for 
New York Tuesday morning. Oddly, Hamed was in New York a few weeks 
ago to promote his latest bout, but he did not seek a visa at that 
time. Kushner said he did not know why no visa application was made 
at that time. Kushner has been the promoter for the bout for only 
five days. The visa snarl is just the latest blow to a show that has 
been on the ropes for the last two weeks. A British court has frozen 
the assets of Frank Warren, Hamed's London-based promoter. Warren 
is battling tax-evasion charges. Under those circumstances, Kushner 
was brought on board last Thursday after all the other parties agreed 
that he should take over the promoter responsibilities from Warren. 
All the revenue from the HBO television fees and the site fee paid 
by Bally's Park Place Casino to pay the fighters and handle the other 
expenses related to the fight will flow through Kushner's business 
accounts. ``It is somewhat unusual,'' Kushner said of taking over 
a boxing promotion so late in the process. ``I had no idea when I 
agreed to this that there might be these types of complications. I've 
been a boxing promoter for 13 years and a rock-concert promoter for 
eight years before that. There have always been problems. To date, 
I've always been able to handle them.'' There was speculation that 
Hamed was not going to leave England until he had assurances that 
his $2 million purse was secure. ``I have explained to Hamed's management 
to their satisfaction that all the necessary details can be worked 
out and will be worked out prior to the fight taking place,'' Kushner 
said. Meanwhile, McCullough, who lives in Las Vegas, had not arrived 
in Atlantic City on Monday, either. McCullough, who is scheduled to 
earn $500,000, was supposed to arrive there at midnight.
