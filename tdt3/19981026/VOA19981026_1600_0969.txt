A controversy has erupted in Indonesia over comments by a cabinet 
minister questioning whether a Hindu could become the nation's leader. 
Jenny Grant reports from Jakarta. Analysts say the predominantly Hindu 
island of Bali will experience mounting political unrest if the official 
is not reprimanded. Hundreds of people demonstrated on the tourist 
island of Bali Monday, angry over what they see as anti-Hindu comments 
by food minister Ahmed Musih Saefuddin. Last week, demonstrators held 
three days of protests in five Balinese towns demanding Mr. Saefuddin 
be sacked. Mr. Saefuddin, a self-nominated presidential contender, 
questioned whether the nation would want opposition Magawati Sukarnoputri 
as their leader, claiming she is a Hindu. Ms. Sukarnoputri is a Muslim, 
but her grandmother was a Balinese Hindu. Many Indonesian Hindus, 
most of whom live in Bali, are calling for President from Bali. Hindus 
make up 3 percent of the population of predominantly Muslim Indonesia. 
Mr. Habibie says he understands why Hindus are upset, but he has urged 
them to be calm for the sake of national unity. This is Jenny Grant 
reporting for VOA News, Jakarta.
