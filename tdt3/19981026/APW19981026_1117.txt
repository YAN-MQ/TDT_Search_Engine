The theater that catapulted Anton Chekhov and Konstantin Stanislavsky 
onto the world stage turned 100 years old on Monday, and much of Moscow 
helped it celebrate. The Moscow Art Theater gained widespread acclaim 
after the success of one of its first plays, Chekhov's ``The Seagull,'' 
in 1898, and went on to become one of the century's most influential 
theaters. Russian Prime Minister Yevgeny Primakov, leading members 
of parliament, Russia's top theater and film directors and its most 
renowned actors attended the theater's anniversary celebrations Monday 
in the elegant building within sight of the Kremlin. Dignitaries performed 
parodies of famous plays presented at the theater, including Chekhov 
classics. Others recited odes to the theater, some sentimental, others 
comic. Stanislavsky, a director and actor, founded the theater with 
colleague Vladimir Nemirovich-Danchenko and developed the Method style 
of acting, which was later adopted by leading directors and actors 
in New York and Hollywood. The Method trains actors to forgo mimicry 
and other stage conventions relied upon by 19th-century actors, instead 
encouraging them to study the inner lives of the characters, as if 
they were real people. Many Russians refer to the theater as the Chekhov 
Theater, because it was there that the playwright first enjoyed fame 
for his works chronicling the broken dreams and stagnation of the 
Russian middle-class. The Moscow Art Theater continued to thrive in 
the Soviet era, but is no longer the trend-setter it once was. It 
is now among many renowned institutions in Russia's richest city facing 
cutbacks because of the country's grinding economic problems.
