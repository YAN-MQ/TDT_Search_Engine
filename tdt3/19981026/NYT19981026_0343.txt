Stock prices were mixed in relatively subdued trading Monday, a session 
highlighted by a computer glitch on the New York Stock Exchange that 
caused a trading halt of nearly an hour. The halt was a result of 
the failure of a switch that sends orders from the exchange to brokers' 
trading posts. It is the first time trading has been delayed in nearly 
three years. On Dec. 18, 1995, the start of trading on the New York 
Stock Exchange was delayed for an hour because of a series of computer 
glitches. But traders said that since Monday's trading halt took place 
in the afternoon, it was potentially much more disruptive. ``If this 
had been a pretty heavy day, it could have been a big problem,'' said 
one stock trader, who asked not to be identified. As it turned out, 
trading volume on the New York Stock Exchange was the lightest since 
Aug. 24, with just 609.9 million shares changing hands. Stocks opened 
lower but then rose on the strength of a powerful performance on European 
exchanges. Shares rallied across the Continent after the Bank of Italy 
followed other central banks and cut interest rates. Better than expected 
earnings reports from a number of companies also lifted the Dow Jones 
industrial average early in the day. But it lost ground later. The 
blue-chip index fell 20.08 points, to 8,432.21. Broader market averages 
did better, however, and small-cap stocks continued to rally. The 
Standard &AMP; Poor's 500-stock index gained 1.65 points, or 0.15 
percent, to 1,072.32. The Nasdaq composite index jumped 31.12 points, 
or 1.84 percent, to 1,724.98. The Russell 2000 index, which is made 
up of largely small-cap issues, gained 5.02 points, or 1.37 percent, 
to 372.07. The Nasdaq, which is laden with high-technology companies, 
got a big boost from a report showing that in the third quarter worldwide 
personal-computer shipments surged 13.7 percent. ``People are reading 
these numbers and thinking that the technology companies can grow 
in a slow-growth environment,'' said Michael Molnar, a managing director 
in retail sales and trading at Salomon Smith Barney. Dell Computer 
rose 4\, to 62{; Intel was up 1 11/16, to 88 15/16, and Cisco Systems 
gained 2 11/16, to 61 3/8. Among Dow stocks, AT&AMP;T and American 
Express both posted gains after reporting strong third-quarter earnings. 
AT&AMP;T rose 7/16, to 64 1/4, after the company said it earned $1 
a share in the period, better than the 95 cents most analysts had 
expected. American Express shares rose 1/2, to 88 1/8, after it reported 
earnings that were slightly above analysts' estimates. Byron Wien, 
U.S. equity strategist at Morgan Stanley Dean Witter, said third-quarter 
earnings reports have been something of a pleasant surprise. Wien 
has spent the last two weeks traveling in Asia. ``When I left, everyone 
was convinced earnings would be a disaster,'' he said. ``That has 
not been the case.''
