The chairman of the Royal Dutch Cycling Union called on French authorities 
Monday to allow a cycling team leader arrested during this summer's 
Tour de France to return home. Cees Priem has not been allowed to 
leave France since July 23 when he and TVM team doctor Andrei Mikhailov 
were arrested following the discovery of drugs in the team's hotel. 
TVM cyclists were taken to a hospital in Albertville for extensive 
medical checks and later dropped out of the Tour, saying they did 
not have the physical or mental strength to finish the race. Royal 
Dutch Cycling Union President Joop Atsma said in an interview published 
in Monday's De Telegraaf newspaper that Priem has been held too long. 
``We've waited long enough,'' he said. ``Our patience with the French 
is running out. It is time for the foreign minister to tell our ambassador 
in Paris to express our displeasure.'' An investigating judge was 
to review the case Tuesday and could order the release of Priem, who 
has been placed under formal investigation, a step short of being 
formally charged. Although Priem was freed from jail in August, he 
was not allowed to leave France and must report to police daily. Atsma, 
a Christian Democrat member of the Dutch parliament, said there is 
support across parliament for action to relieve ``Priem's hopeless-looking 
situation.'' Atsma even suggested that French authorities were holding 
Priem to protest the Dutch government's liberal drug policy, which 
often has led to diplomatic rows between the two nations. The investigation 
of the TVM team actually began in March, when French customs agents 
found about 100 doses of EPO, which increases oxygen to the red blood 
cells, in a team car. But that find only came to light following the 
outbreak of the scandal involving the Festina team which was kicked 
off the Tour after some of its riders admitted taking performance-enhancing 
drugs.
