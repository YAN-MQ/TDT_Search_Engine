ANDERSON, S.C. _ ``Bill Clinton brings out passion in people and that's 
what makes him a hard character to sit in judgment of,'' mused Rep. 
Lindsey Graham, R-S.C., driving across his sun-dappled rural district 
far from Washington and pondering the impeachment task that awaits 
him after the election. ``God knows, everybody is willing to forgive 
this guy,'' said Graham, 43, one of the more contrarian Republicans 
on the Judiciary Committee, one who did not hesitate, as a firebrand 
conservative, to take part in the failed leadership coup against Speaker 
Newt Gingrich last year. For this, he was tabbed by Congressional 
Quarterly as one of the year's 12 outstanding House members _ an outspoken 
``kamikaze'' leader of the Contract With America class of 1994, unflinching 
in challenging the patriarch. Yet here was Graham, unopposed this 
election in a strongly anti-Clinton district, speaking about the impeachment 
of the president with gently measured words of caution to both the 
Congress and his party. ``If we're seen as people who just played 
politics with a very bad event, that will hurt us for years to come; 
we'll be trapped in it,'' he said, consumed by the subject as the 
soothing Carolina countryside drifted by. As he drove and talked, 
Graham displayed his lawyer's inclination to lay out the pros and 
cons of the political struggle that looms between the Congress and 
the president. He cautioned Clinton against clinging to the strategy 
of claiming to be ``legally correct'' under oath, while admitting 
he otherwise misled the nation. Democratic defections on the impeachment 
issue will quickly follow Election Day, he said, if Republicans make 
substantial gains in Congress. ``The Democrats will be on this guy 
like that,'' he said, snapping his fingers at the blue sky beyond 
the windshield. ``But if this thing comes down to an inappropriate 
relationship in the White House where an intern is approached, the 
president has problems relating to women and has been less than a 
perfect husband, well, everybody can put their label on it,'' he said 
with an easy twang. ``But for the sake of politics and the future 
of this country, that should not be grounds for impeachment, because 
then you'll be giving open season for anybody in the political system 
who wants to gain power by trashing out a political enemy for having 
an affair.'' A few miles farther along the road, Graham conjured up 
a different president, one he said was perhaps as ``dark'' in his 
willful evasions of the truth as Richard Nixon. ``There's a dark side 
to Bill Clinton, potentially _ the consuming personality who wants 
what he wants and don't get in the way of it before or after,'' he 
postulated, estimating that if the committee can show the nation a 
pattern of the president's systematically foiling the justice system, 
he will be seen as being every bit ``as dangerous to our legal system 
as Richard Nixon was to our political system.'' But that ``would be 
very hard to prove,'' Graham added instantly. ``You're going to need 
a couple of John Deans,'' he said, referring to the White House counsel 
who testified against Nixon. The three-hour drive opened a window 
into the detailed thinking of a candid Judiciary Committee member 
who openly wonders whether the nation is delving into ``Watergate 
or Peyton Place.'' With a small bipartisan group of committee colleagues, 
he has been scouting the possibilities of a compromise settlement 
of the impeachment issue. ``The Constitution is a very flexible document,'' 
Graham said. While Graham clearly relishes delivering political stings 
as a conservative infighter, he said he learned to love the law above 
all else, as the first member of his family to go to college. He also 
served overseas as a lawyer in the military. He estimated that the 
committee seemed likely to produce an impeachment charge of perjury 
against the president, for his testimony before the grand jury. But 
``if the votes aren't there in the Senate'' for conviction, Graham 
said, the matter might be better resolved by a compromise among congressional 
leaders. ``If President Clinton lied to a grand jury, we can't ignore 
that, but if he would just absolutely come clean about it, then you 
would have a sense of proportionality about the punishment,'' Graham 
said. Once more, he seemed to be confronting the president as much 
as the country road ahead. ``Quit dancing on the head of a pin,'' 
he advised Clinton. ``Quit insulting my intelligence.'' The congressman 
added that the president should abandon further legalisms and plainly 
tell the nation about the Monica Lewinsky matter: ``Our relationship 
as described by Ms. Lewinsky is true. If that makes me a perjurer, 
then prosecute me. But I feel I'm a good president.'' Graham finally 
had to smile because he was preoccupied with the very Washington topic 
he thought he might escape. ``That's why I came home,'' he said.
