You're listening to VOA News Now coming to you from Washington. Some 
of your affiliates are about to take a two-minute break. Today is 
Monday, October 26, 1998. Looking back in history on this date in 
1825, the Erie Canal opened. New York governor DeWitt Clinton poured 
a barrel of water from Lake Erie into the Atlantic Ocean near New 
York City to mark the official opening of the canal. The waterway 
linked existing rivers and lakes between the port city of Buffalo 
on Lake Erie and Albany on the Hudson River. The canal made is possible 
for freight-carrying barges to be towed by mule teams from Buffalo 
to Albany faster and cheaper than wagons could haul the freight. After 
barges reached Albany, goods and passengers from the West could sail 
south on the Hudson River to New York City. Now, the canal gave the 
Atlantic port of New York City easy access to the West and was partially 
responsible for the city's growth as a port and financial center. 
Another significant event in more contemporary history on October 
26. This in 1972. That was the day when U.S. national security adviser 
Henry Kissinger broke the silence on the Vietnam War peace talks, 
declaring peace is at hand. Professor Kissinger, President Richard 
Nixon's top foreign policy adviser, optimistically predicted a cease-fire 
could be arranged shortly. President Nixon, campaigning for re-election, 
promised he would achieve peace with honor and not peace with surrender. 
Well, it turned out that Mr. Kissinger was far too optimistic. It 
actually took three more months to achieve a final peace agreement, 
which was signed in January of 1973. But despite the treaty's mandate 
for a cease-fire, Vietcong forces and the army of North Vietnam continued 
their attacks on South Vietnam until Saigon fell April 29, 1975. 1030 
Universal Time, and this is VOA News Now. Palestinian leader Yasser 
Arafat briefs Arab leaders on the Middle East peace accord, while 
Israel's leaders face an immediate no-confidence challenge. And U.S. 
secretary of state Madeleine Albright warns of NATO action if Serbia 
refuses to comply with an agreement to withdraw its forces from Kosovo. 
All of that's coming up in this half hour of VOA News Now.
