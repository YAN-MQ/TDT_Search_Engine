Riot police charged hundreds of unemployed college graduates who defied 
a protest ban and gathered outside Parliament Monday to press their 
demand for jobs. About 300 protesters were outside Parliament when 
police charged into the crowd to disperse it. Official sources said 
six people were injured and a dozen arrested, though a youth leader 
claimed dozens were hurt and more than 60 people were rounded up. 
The demonstrators went on to the regional government prefecture, then 
to the local Moroccan Labor Union headquarters, where hundreds gathered 
inside despite efforts by police to block them. Nearly 1,000 of police 
were deployed in central Rabat to prevent further unrest. During the 
Parliament protest, police roughed up journalists for several foreign 
and domestic media and seized their film. The youth leader, Ahmed 
Kabil, assistant secretary-general of the Association of Young Unemployed 
Graduates, said police arrested the group's leader, Faber Bensaid, 
outside the local government prefecture. Police had banned a march 
planned by the group, so leaders instead ``wanted to turn it into 
a sit-in in front of the Parliament,'' Kabil said. Moroccan students 
and graduates have periodically staged protests demanding more aid 
for training and job placement.
