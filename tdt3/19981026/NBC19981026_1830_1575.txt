"Living longer, living better." Okay, so we know that exercise is 
good for you. We've heard that a lot, but now we're beginning to understand 
just how much it means to a longer life. A number of studies over 
the past year or so have quantified the effect of exercise on life 
span and the results are stunning. As NBC's Andrea Mitchell tells 
us tonight, there's a whole new class of fitness enthusiasts proving 
the point. If exercise could be put in a pill, scientists say we would 
have the best anti-aging medicine possible. The latest research -- 
exercising only 20 minutes a day for more than three years can add 
one year to your life. Exercise 90 minutes a day, you add three years. 
Just getting up and down the court is a thrill. Come on, Bette! Come 
on, Bette! The sound of that ball going through the net, that really 
does do it. 51-year-old Bette Fleming, trying to build her endurance. 
Research shows healthy older Americans lose as much as 2% of their 
strength per year. That means, between the ages of 30 and 70, you 
can lose 40% of your muscle mass unless you exercise. I feel like 
I'm 18 years old every time I go out and run. It's like, it takes 
everything else away. It's just like I'm a kid again. Madeline bost 
is no kid. she's 59. And like millions of other women her age, sports 
were off limits when she was young, considered dangerous. There were 
certain terrible things that would happen to you if you did something 
physical. In fact, researchers say just the opposite. They say a 50-year-old 
or 60-year-old who exercises regularly can be as healthy as an inactive 
person 25 years younger. So what should you do? Everyone knows you 
should exercise more, but here's what that really means. According 
to a recent study from New York's Mt. Sinai medical center -- for 
Pat brisendine, who's 56, that means swimming laps 20 minutes a day 
or water aerobics for a half hour. It's just opened a whole new world 
to me, and I just encourage anybody to get out and try to do these 
things. It's never too late. What if you can't get to the gym? Rake 
leaves for 30 minutes a day. Climb stairs for 15 minutes. Even push 
a stroller 1 1/2 miles in 30 minutes. Bette Fleming is finally playing 
in her high school gym. Girls weren't allowed 30 years ago. The girls 
would be intramural cheerleaders, but the sports were all for the 
boys. But now it's for everyone who knows that until they find a magic 
pill to stop aging, there is now more evidence than ever proving exercise 
is the best medicine for "living longer, living better." Andrea Mitchell, 
NBC news, north Cambridge, Massachusetts.
