In recent years, Cuban musicians have been mining the depths of their 
island's rhythmic traditions. They've been pushed along by a heightened 
demand in the United States and in Europe for salsa, marangay, and 
sonn. But how long can Cuban musicians keep reinventing the sounds 
that they're known for? The band, Africando, has started to diversify 
it's musical portfolio. Africando is composed of two singers from 
Senegal, one from Benin, and one from Cuba. So you could say they're 
already predisposed to fishing around for nontraditional Cuban music 
for their song list. On Africando's latest album, the band cover's 
"Aisha," a huge hit in Europe last year for Algerian super star Halled. 
But the most surprising track from the African/Cuban ensemble, surprising 
because it works so well, is Edip Pyaff's signature tune "La Vien 
Rose." That's music from Africando.
