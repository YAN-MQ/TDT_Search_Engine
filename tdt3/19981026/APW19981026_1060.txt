Riot police charged hundreds of unemployed college graduates who defied 
a protest ban and gathered outside Parliament Monday to press their 
demand for jobs. About 300 protesters were outside Parliament when 
police charged into the crowd to disperse it. Police sources, who 
requested anonymity, said at least 12 people were injured and 28 arrested. 
But a youth leader claimed dozens were hurt and more than 60 people 
rounded up. In total, more than 3,000 people took part in protests 
across the capital, the police sources said.
