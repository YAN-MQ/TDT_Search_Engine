Researchers may be a step closer to finding a cure for spinal cord 
injuries. Scientists at Vanderbilt University used the anti-cancer 
drug compound cm-101 on 26 paralyzed mice. All but two of the mice 
were able to walk again. Researchers believe cm-101 blocks the growth 
of new blood vessels that usually form after a spinal cord injury. 
That also would prevent the formation of scar tissue and allow severed 
nerves to reconnect. Researchers could begin human trials next year.
