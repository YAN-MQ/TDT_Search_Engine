In Jerusalem, about 300 Jewish settlers held a demonstration outside 
netanyahu's residence in protest of the interim land-for-peace deal 
with palestinians. A recent poll, however, indicates 74% of Israelis 
support the agreement. Palestinians also protested the deal in the 
West Bank and in Gaza city. Palestinian authority President Yasser 
Arafat is visiting Arab countries to win support for the accord.
