This is Pamela McCall in the BBC Newsroom in London. Israeli authorities 
have ordered the closure of the West Bank town of Hebron following 
the killing of a Jewish settler and a Palestinian. The move comes 
after Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu defeated a no-confidence motion. 
It was put forward by a far right-wing party opposed to last Friday's 
peace deal with the Palestinians. But Mr. Netanyahu still faces other 
challenges to his position. A parliamentary committee voted in favor 
of a bill to hold early elections. Hayen Ramone is a leading member 
of the Labor Party. He explains why his party supports the move for 
early elections. It's clear that Netanyahu lost his coalition that's 
based on the extreme right cannot survive any longer and we are calling 
for early election that will take place after the Y Plantation memorandum 
will be implemented in the spring of 1999. Hayen Ramone of the Labor 
Party.
