Alan Sainsbury, who pioneered supermarkets in Britain and who helped 
build a family grocery empire, has died. He was 96. Lord Sainsbury, 
made a life peer in 1962, died Oct. 21 at his home in Toppesfield, 
a village in Essex county, east of London. Cause of death was not 
announced. The family business, founded by his grandparents in 1869 
with a single shop in London, was already successful when Alan Sainsbury 
was born Aug. 13, 1902. He was instrumental in transforming the business 
into a giant retailer which now has nearly 400 stores and sales of 
11.6 billion pounds (nearly dlrs 20 billion) a year. Sent by the government 
after World War II to investigate food retailing innovations in the 
United States, Sainsbury returned home with what was then a revolutionary 
concept _ self-service grocery stores. In June 1950, he opened Britain's 
first self-service store to a mixed reaction. Handed a wire basket 
at the store entrance, one shopper threw it right back at Sainsbury 
on being told she was expected to carry around her own purchases _ 
normally the job of a shop assistant. Educated at Haileybury, a private 
school, Alan Sainsbury joined the family business in 1921, starting 
behind the counter. With his younger brother, Robert, he took over 
running the company in 1938. Both brothers retired in 1967 to become 
joint presidents, and the next generation, including Lord Sainsbury's 
three sons, took over. The company was launched on the stock exchange 
in 1973. Sainsbury took a keen interest in public affairs. Three times 
he tried unsuccessfully to get elected to the House of Commons for 
the centrist Liberal Party. In the unelected Lords he was active on 
consumer issues, and sat on government advisory committees relating 
to food and commerce. He supported charities, including medical research 
and furthering of Jewish-Christian understanding. He married twice, 
first to ballet dancer Doreen Adams, by whom he had three sons. They 
were divorced in 1939. He had a daughter by his second wife, Anne 
Lewy. Both wives died before him and he is survived by his children.
