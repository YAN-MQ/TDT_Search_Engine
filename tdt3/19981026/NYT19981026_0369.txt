NBC officially put Scott Sassa in place Monday as the executive who 
will lead the network's entertainment division in the future, installing 
him as president of entertainment, replacing Warren Littlefield, the 
long-time programming executive for the network. Bob Wright, the president 
of NBC, also made clear the network's plan to have Sassa replace Don 
Ohlmeyer, who heads NBC's entertainment operations as president of 
its West Coast division, when Ohlmeyer completes his contract in January 
of 2000. The moves come at a time when NBC, the dominant network in 
prime time for the past five years, has experienced a slide in its 
ratings performance this season, though it still leads all its network 
rivals by a wide margin. NBC is also embroiled in a dispute with the 
big Hollywood studios, which have imposed a boycott on providing new 
shows to NBC. That action is a protest against a new NBC policy demanding 
either an ownership position in all new shows it programs or contract 
terms of 10 years or more that would prevent NBC from facing a renegotiation 
after four years, like the one that forced NBC to pay $13 million 
an episode for its hit drama ``E.R.'' Wright said the timing was right 
to realign its entertainment division, bringing in Sassa and entering 
into a joint-venture agreement with Littlefield to provide shows for 
the network from his own company. ``This time was the opportunity 
to have as orderly a management transition as possible,'' Wright said. 
``We've completed work on the current schedule; all the new programs 
are in place. A lot of the work on the spring development still has 
to be done. This is an opportunity for Scott to come into a less hectic 
situation.'' Sassa said he intended to throw himself immediately into 
the development process because ``finding hit shows is what keeps 
this business going.'' He said he thought the idea of a transition 
year in which he would be able to work with Ohlmeyer was an ideal 
arrangement because ``in fairness, I really don't know what this job 
is all about.'' Sassa's background included managing all the entertainment 
operations for Turner Broadcasting, from starting the cable entertainment 
channel TNT and the Cartoon Network to making the deals to acquire 
the Castle Rock and New Line movie studios for Turner and starting 
Turner Pictures. ``I've developed animated shows. I've developed television 
movies. I've developed theatrical motion pictures. I've even developed 
a comic book,'' Sassa said, ``But I've never developed a network series. 
I'm curious to learn the process.'' Wright said Sassa's ``multichannel 
background'' would be an asset. ``We need a diversity of ideas,'' 
he said. Summing up how the transition would work, he said: ``Scott 
will become Warren. Don is Don. At some point Scott will be Don.'' 
He added, ``It was never intended that Warren continue in a programming 
role all the way through his contract.'' Before he agreed to the joint-venture 
deal to start his own company, Littlefield had a management contract 
with NBC that extended through 2001. Wright praised Littlefield, who 
was in place at NBC entertainment when the network initiated many 
of its biggest hits _ including ``Seinfeld,'' ``Cheers'' and ``E.R.'' 
_ for his programming contributions to the network. ``I'm very high 
on Warren,'' Wright said. ``I've defended him when others didn't. 
I've gone with Warren on a lot of decisions.'' One of those decisions 
was Littlefield's choice to select Jay Leno to succeed Johnny Carson 
at the ``Tonight'' show over David Letterman. That looked like a bad 
decision for two years, but Leno has now become the dominant star 
in late night. Though his deepest association in the business is with 
Turner and cable, Sassa said he had never disparaged the network business 
as some other cable executives have. He cited the ability of networks 
to deliver much bigger audiences for shows as its continuing advantage 
over cable. NBC's situation in prime-time television is still solid, 
Wright said, though he acknowledged the network's decline this season. 
``We're struggling to live up to our billing,'' he said. He added 
that NBC was not ready to pick up the slack from the departure of 
``Seinfeld,'' which the show's star, Jerry Seinfeld, announced abruptly 
last Christmas. ``It could have been nice if Jerry had decided to 
give up one more year,'' Wright said. As for the confrontation with 
the studios, Sassa said: ``I'm not going to negotiate that in the 
newspapers. Don and I need to talk about it.'' Wright said, ``I'm 
sure there's a solution to it, but I'm just as sure that it isn't 
quite as necessary for us to be in business with the studios as it 
used to be.'' He said that independent producers had been aggressively 
bringing projects to NBC, ``now that they realize they can jump ahead 
in line.'' One of the producers NBC is already counting on is Littlefield. 
Ohlmeyer said he wouldn't be surprised to see Littlefield's new company 
come up with a show that could be on NBC's schedule as early as next 
fall.
