A controversial new book is again putting a spotlight on the late 
princess diana. The author tries to portray her as the villain in 
her marriage to prince charles. However, it may be having an opposite 
effect. Margaret Lowrie reports. Princess Diana is dead. But stories 
about her still sell newspapers -- The bitter arguments over a new 
book about the marriage of the prince and princess of Wales -- -- 
and fill the airwaves. Diana stories still enthrall or enrage, depending 
on whose side you take. The latest arise from an unauthorized new 
biography of prince Charles. If meant to counter Diana's claims that 
he was a cold and unfeeling husband and father, it may have backfired. 
For a long time, those close to the prince have been fuming and smarting 
and frustrated that a lot of what was said went unchallenged. But 
I don't think it helps at all to come out with what purports to be 
his side of things but comes across as a rather squalid tit for tat. 
The book, "Charles: victim or villain?" By penny junor, excerpted 
in a British tabloid, makes a number of controversial claims, including 
-- Diana made death threats to the woman she saw as her chief rival, 
Camilla Parker Bowles. Diana, not Charles, committed adultery first, 
with a bodyguard in 1985. And that she tried to slash herself when 
she heard he'd died in an accident. The public seems to have remarkable 
capacity for credulity, so it'll probably believe what it wants to 
believe -- which I think in the case of a Lot of people will be the 
continuing sanctification of Diana and the vilification of Charles. 
Some of Diana's supporters accuse the prince and Mrs. Parker bowles 
of helping the author. But Charles has issued an unprecedented statement 
saying neither he nor mrs. Parker Bowles had anything -- had authorized, 
solicited or approved that book and that personal details should be 
left private and undisturbed. It was Diana who made their private 
life so public, contributing secretly to a book which revealed her 
loneliness, eating disorders and despair, and observers say her version 
of events largely shaped the public's view. The new book on Charles 
may not change the public's mind, but some say either way, it is a 
reminder there are really three sides to this troubled tale -- his, 
hers and the truth, which we may never know. Margaret Lowrie, CNN, 
London.
