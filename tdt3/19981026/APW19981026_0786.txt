Three runaway train cars loaded with concrete collided with a bus 
Monday in the Russian Far East, killing at least nine people and injuring 
25, a news report said. The bus was torn apart when the rail cars 
carrying concrete panels and other construction materials rammed into 
it at an unmanned railroad crossing in Khabarovsk, about 6,100 kilometers 
(3,800 miles) southeast of Moscow. It was unclear how the cars detached 
from their train. The Interfax news agency said nine people were killed, 
but Russia's ORT television station put the death toll at 13. Twenty-two 
people were hospitalized, and another three were treated at the scene, 
Interfax said. More than 100 rescuers were working at the site of 
the crash.
