Back on Wall Street -- the Dow is up 22 points. The NASDAQ is adding 
15. That's "Dollars & Sense." Back to you, Catherine. That is. "Headline 
Sports" is next. Nobody loves CARS MORE than I do. Each one is a work 
of art. So when a maker of all these chose a new antifreeze, it got 
my attention. General Motors now uses the dex-cool technology of havoline 
extended life antifreeze in virtually all its new vehicles. The same 
patented formula you can use in your car. For 5 years or 150,000 miles. 
So do what GM did, switch to havoline. I use it in my car. I only 
wish this were it.
