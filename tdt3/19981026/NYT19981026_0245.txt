Think Cher. The hair story for next spring, as played out on the European 
runways, is long and straight, falling well below the shoulders, and 
most often parted in the center. The quintessential style was seen 
at Gucci, which recalled the Sonny and Cher era. There were slight 
variations at the other shows, like Versace's, where long straight 
hair was parted on the side the way Donatella Versace herself wears 
it. Miuccia Prada's models sometimes had a bobby pin or clip holding 
side-parted hair away from the face. At Chloe, hair was sexily tousled. 
At Valentino, the attitude was more sophisticated, with long hair 
brushed back from the face to spill down the back. A few models had 
long bangs. Chanel's version was stylized, with a hank of hair hanging 
down one side of the face and the rest pulled neatly back into a bun. 
Anyone with short hair who wants to achieve the Cher look should start 
growing it now.
