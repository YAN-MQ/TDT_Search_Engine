The state department is warning Libya that it may face tougher sanctions 
if it doesn't allow two men to stand trial in the Netherlands. A bombing 
killed all 259 people aboard an aircraft. In July the United States 
and Britain proposed a compromise that would allow them to be tried 
by a Scottish judge in the Netherlands. Libyan authorities have issued 
a series of conditions. If they are convicted, they must serve in 
Libya and not face extradition to the United States or Britain. Libya 
has been under U.N. sanctions since 1992 to force the handover of 
the suspects.
