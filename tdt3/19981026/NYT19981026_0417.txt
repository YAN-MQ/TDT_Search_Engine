Just over one week after his second arrest in three years on crack-cocaine 
charges, former Giant linebacker Lawrence Taylor checked into a drug 
rehabilitation clinic in New Jersey on Monday night, his lawyer said. 
``My understanding is that Lawrence checked himself in on Monday,'' 
said lawyer Thomas Melani. ``Any time a drug addict gets positive 
reinforcement, it's a good thing. I think he had to do it and I'm 
glad he did it. I think it's good for him.'' Melani said he did not 
personally see Taylor go into the clinic, but received assurances 
that the former Giants star had indeed went to a rehabilitation center 
that Melani would not identify. Taylor told people close to him goodbye 
on Monday morning and said he would be at the clinic for 30 to 60 
days; Melani said Taylor would probably stay for 30 days. Efforts 
to reach Taylor by telephone at his home during the day were unsuccessful. 
Taylor was arrested at 2 a.m. on Oct. 19 in a St. Petersburg Beach, 
Fla., hotel room where the police said he tried to buy $50 worth of 
crack cocaine from an undercover officer. There were 15 crack pipes 
inside the room, according to the police. Taylor has maintained that 
he was set up by the police and within the last few days, his lawyer 
said, took a lie-detector test that he claimed proved his version 
of events was true. Taylor was arrested two years ago in Myrtle Beach, 
S.C., for allegedly trying to buy $100 worth of fake crack cocaine 
from an undercover officer. His record in that case was wiped clean 
after he undertook 60 hours of community service and submitted to 
drug counseling and random drug testing. Last year, Taylor pleaded 
guilty in U.S. District Court in Camden, N.J., to filing a false federal 
income tax return by failing to report $48,000 in income from a restaurant, 
near Giants Stadium, that is now closed. The maximum sentence for 
his offense is three years in federal prison and a $250,000 fine, 
but Taylor is expected to receive probation because he cooperated 
with federal prosecutors. But Taylor was apparently told by federal 
prosecutors after his arrest last week that his latest troubles could 
mean a violation of the plea-agreement and that if Taylor did not 
receive drug counseling immediately he would very be likely to face 
jail time. Taylor has been in and out of rehabilitation clinics over 
much of his football career and even after he retired from football 
in 1993. He underwent rehabilitation for a cocaine problem in 1986, 
but two years later was suspended by the National Football League 
for violating the league's substance abuse policy. The Giants have 
paid for several stints to such clinics for Taylor since he retired, 
said Giant officials who spoke on the condition of anonymity. The 
team, especially owner Wellington Mara and many of Taylor's close 
friends remain very concerned about his health. Taylor, the Giants' 
career sack leader and perhaps the best linebacker ever, is eligible 
for entrance into the Pro Football Hall of Fame in January. Melani, 
the lawyer, said: ``I think a lot of people are concerned about Lawrence 
and he appreciates it very much, of course. I think right now Lawrence 
wants to work on his problems and be alone for a while. He wants to 
correct his life and he's working hard at it.''
