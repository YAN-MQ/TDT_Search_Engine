A reactor was stopped for scheduled repairs at Ukraine's Khmelnytsky 
nuclear power plant, officials said Monday. The plant's only operational 
reactor was shut down Sunday and is to be restarted by Friday, the 
state nuclear energy company Energoatom said. No radiation leaks were 
reported during the shutdown. Ukraine's five nuclear power facilities 
have 14 reactors, five of which are currently undergoing repairs, 
Energoatom said. The country's nuclear officials said last week the 
number of malfunctions at nuclear power plants, which was steadily 
growing in the first half of 1998, had fallen in the past several 
months.
