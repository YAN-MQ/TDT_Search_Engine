Serb forces have begun a large scale pullout from Kosovo ahead of 
the deadline set by NATO. Yugoslav President Slobodan Milosevic agreed 
to the withdrawal under intense pressure from the western alliance. 
Jeremy Cook reports from the capital of Kosovo, Pristina. Thousands 
of Serb soldiers and paramilitary police have been on the move. Yugoslav 
government forces say that four regiments have been returned to their 
barracks within Kosovo. What's not clear is whether President Milosevic 
is now in compliance with the deal he signed with the international 
community, agreeing to scale down his forces in Kosovo to the level 
they were at before fighting began earlier this year. The troop movements 
have been monitored by NATO spy planes, but the unarmed civilian observers 
who were supposed to assess the situation on the ground is still very 
few in number. The BBC's Jeremy Cook in Pristina.
