And turning to the Kosovo crisis, President Clinton and British prime 
minister Tony Blair have agreed on the need to show resolve in confronting 
the Kosovo crisis. They discussed the situation in a phone conversation 
Sunday evening. Secretary of State Madeleine Albright says Yugoslav 
president Slobodan Milosevic has not yet fully complied with an agreement 
to withdraw Serb forces from Kosovo, although the deadline for doing 
so is Tuesday. But Ms. Albright says there has been progress, though 
not enough. I think that we have accomplished a great deal thus far 
in terms of the military situation. Two of the military units that 
were in -- came into Kosovo from Serbia have been withdrawn. There 
has been a cease-fire. In terms of the humanitarian activities, 30,000 
people or so have been able to come down from the mountains and are 
going back to their areas. The nongovernmental organizations have 
been able to get back to deliver food. Kosovo now is not just a discussion 
only for Milosevic, but it has now become an international issue. 
OSCE monitors are going to go in. There's a very overall plan for 
air verification. So it's been internationalized. The question of 
it has been internationalized. But there is a lot more to do. This 
special police, the MUP, have to be withdrawn. More military have 
to be withdrawn, and General Clark, the commander -- supreme commander 
of forces for NATO, has been in Belgrade talking more to Milosevic 
about what he has to do. Secretary Albright says if that isn't done 
by Tuesday, NATO has threatened air strikes against Serb military 
targets. General Clark has the authority. He was given that authority. 
The bombing is on the books. But I think that what we need to find 
out is what General Clark has been able to accomplish, and that is 
what we're going to be looking at in the next few days. He has thus 
far not complied. There have been, as I say, some compliance, not 
enough compliance. And it's looking at it day by day. The Yugoslav 
news agency has released a statement saying, "Mr. Milosevic stressed 
to General Clark that the steps taken so far would help ease the crisis 
in Kosovo."
