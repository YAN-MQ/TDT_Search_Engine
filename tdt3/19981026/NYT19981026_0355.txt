Less than a year after swallowing a $1 billion loss from its unsuccessful 
venture into financial information services, Dow Jones &AMP; Co., 
the publisher of The Wall Street Journal, announced a three-year financial 
plan on Monday that is intended to increase earnings 10 percent a 
year. In a presentation to securities analysts, top Dow Jones executives 
emphasized the growth potential of the electronic businesses and signaled 
belt-tightening and efficiency measures at The Journal and other publications. 
Still, while analysts have been lukewarm about the company's stock, 
and some dissident shareholders have called for a more sweeping shakeup, 
the Dow Jones plan is a cautious one, some analysts said. It appears 
to be aimed more at reassuring investors with evidence of self-discipline, 
and less at inspiring them with a corporate vision. ``There's a lot 
of slow and steady building there,'' said Steven Barlow, an analyst 
with Credit Suisse First Boston after the meeting in lower Manhattan. 
``You've got a big organization that had been somewhat complacent 
in its budgeting processes _ never looking out all that far into the 
future. Just to institute thinking in that direction is something.'' 
At Monday's presentation, Dow Jones' chief financial officer, Jerry 
Bailey, said that the print publishing segment of Dow Jones, which 
includes The Journal, Barron's and several smaller publications, is 
expected to produce operating cash flow margins of 25 percent, down 
from 27 percent last year. He suggested there would be a more cost-conscious 
approach at The Journal, which had the most profitable year in its 
history last year, but which has experienced a sharp drop in advertising 
revenue in the last two months from a year ago. The company plans 
to invest $238 million over the next three years to expand The Journal's 
page and color capacity. The detail provided in Bailey's presentation 
was welcomed by analysts, and some found that the cautious earnings 
projections were a sign that Dow Jones executives were conscious of 
the skepticism in their audience. Dow Jones shares rose 75 cents Monday, 
to $44.5625, but still near its 52-week low of $41.5625, which was 
reached on Oct. 14. ``It's like a first date with someone,'' David 
Winters, a securities analyst for Franklin Mutual Advisors. ``You 
don't want to overpromise.'' Winters, whose firm owns 3.8 million 
shares, or about a 4 percent stake, added, ``Bailey is focused on 
doing the right things for the long term, which is what it is all 
about.'' Another analyst was less impressed. ``The long-term earnings-per-share 
targets don't seem that aggressive,'' said Lauren Rich Fine, an analyst 
with Merrill Lynch. ``The target goals are just the averages of where 
they have been.'' Still, many analysts see Bailey, 46, as a rising 
star at Dow Jones, which he joined in April after having been chief 
financial officer at Salomon Inc. from 1993 to 1997. He was recruited 
with the support of the descendants of the Bancroft family _ who control 
the voting shares of the company _ and the outside board members, 
who include Harvey Golub, the chief executive of American Express, 
and Irvine Hockaday, chief executive of Hallmark. During a quarterly 
meeting of Bancroft family members on Oct. 6 at the Boston law firm 
of Hemingway &AMP; Barnes, the discussion revolved around the three-year 
plan prepared by Bailey, according to a person who was present but 
spoke on condition of anonymity. But Bailey's track record at Salomon 
was mixed, according to two former Salomon executives. When Bailey 
was named chief financial officer, the firm had already begun an accounting 
review that eventually led Salomon to announce a loss of $364 million 
for 1994, of which roughly a third was a charge taken for ``unreconciled 
balances'' at its London operations. Three weeks later, however, the 
firm announced $35 million more in losses because of a bookkeeping 
blunder. Salomon's chairman and chief executive at the time, Robert 
Denham, who is now a partner at the Los Angeles law firm of Munger, 
Tolles &AMP; Olson, said last week that the problem was not Bailey's 
fault. But the second round of losses apparently upset top-level executives. 
One, who spoke on condition of anonymity, said: ``There is no question 
that some members of senior management felt it was Bailey's problem 
because he was the CFO and all accounting reported to him. He had 
signed off on it.'' In an interview Monday, Bailey said, ``Given the 
nature of anything that size, there are always changes in estimates.'' 
As to any lessons he learned from the experience, he said, ``Do your 
homework on a company before you join.'' Last week's management changes 
at Dow Jones included the resignation of the president, Kenneth Burenga, 
and the elevation of Bailey and Peter Skinner, 54, the company's general 
counsel, to executive vice president. Gordon Crovitz, a former editor 
and publisher of The Far Eastern Economic Review, was named senior 
vice president. Crovitz's portfolio includes the electronic businesses 
where the company hopes to get much of its earnings growth. The most 
visible of these endeavors, the Wall Street Journal Interactive Edition, 
has been a success, attracting 256,000 paying subscribers by Sept. 
30. It is expected to show a profit in 1999. The electronic products 
include the Dow Jones news wires. The appointment of Crovitz, 40, 
has raised expectations that he may become a candidate for chief executive, 
succeeding Peter Kann, who has confounded dissident stockholders' 
predictions that the costly miscalculations on the former financial-services 
unit, Dow Jones Markets, once known as Telerate, would cost him his 
job. Indeed, the career path of Crovitz, a former editorial writer 
at The Journal, mirrors those of most Dow Jones chief executives who 
began as journalists. Asked if the new management changes gave clues 
to his eventual successor, Kann said, ``I intend to be around for 
a while.'' He added, ``I do think that in a content company, whoever 
holds the top job should have a deep understanding about the editorial 
product and editorial integrity.'' But, he said, ``There's no inevitability 
that a reporter always holds my title.''
