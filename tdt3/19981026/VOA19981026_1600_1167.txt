The president of football's world governing body, FIFA, has dealt 
a blow to England's hopes of hosting the World Cup finals in 2006. 
After meeting with British prime minister Tony Blair and sports minister 
Tony Banks in London Monday, FIFA president Joseph Blatter said it 
would be logical for the tournament to be held in Africa. Blatter 
said he was expecting a very strong and professional bid from England, 
and that any successful nation would have to meet the criteria laid 
out by FIFA for hosting the event. The requirements would include 
acceptable stadium facilities, security, transportation, telecommunications 
and hotels. But he made it clear that nothing had changed since he 
announced during his campaign for the FIFA presidency that he favors 
holding the 2006 tournament in Africa. Blatter says he expects bids 
from England, Germany, South Africa, Nigeria, Morocco, Brazil and 
Egypt.
