LUXEMBOURG (AP) - The European Union on Monday said EU monitors will 
make up about two-thirds of the 2,000-strong unarmed ground force 
verifying compliance with the Kosovo peace agreement. In Vienna, Austria, 
the Organization for Security and Cooperation in Europe on Sunday 
formally established the Kosovo Verification Mission (KVM), hours 
after the U.N. Security Council approved it. A Security Council resolution 
adopted late Saturday endorsed the agreement to allow the unarmed 
monitors to patrol Kosovo and to let NATO verify from the air that 
fighting stopped. In it, the Security Council demanded that Yugoslavia 
abide by the accord to end fighting in Kosovo and said action may 
be needed to ensure the safety of the international monitors. In Luxembourg, 
Austrian Foreign Minister Wolfgang Schuessel on Monday listed the 
number of participants EU countries have said they will commit: Britain 
- 200 Germany - 200 Italy - between 150 and 200 France - between 150 
and 200 Portugal - 30 Sweden - 80 Greece, Austria and Denmark - 50 
each Luxembourg - 12 No figures were given for the other five countries 
in the EU.
