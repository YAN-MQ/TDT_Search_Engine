Opening a new line of defense in its antitrust trial, Microsoft Corp. 
on Monday portrayed a meeting that is a focal point in the government's 
case as a ``set up'' orchestrated by its Internet software rival, 
Netscape Communications Corp. Microsoft based that claim on the fact 
that the Justice Department issued a civil subpoena to Netscape the 
day after the meeting, on June 21, 1995, and that two days later government 
lawyers received a reply from a Netscape lawyer. Microsoft obtained 
the previously undisclosed letter from the Netscape lawyer to the 
Justice Department only two days ago _ an omission that Microsoft 
called a ``flagrant'' breach by the government of the rules of pretrial 
document discovery. The Justice Department and the states that are 
suing Microsoft have alleged that at the June 21, 1995, meeting Microsoft 
made an illegal offer to Netscape to divide the market for the browser 
software used to navigate the Internet's World Wide Web. And the next 
day, in an e-mail message to Microsoft Chairman Bill Gates, Dan Rosen, 
a Microsoft executive who had attended the meeting, reported that 
much of the discussion between Microsoft and Netscape had ``centered 
on how the lines would be drawn between'' what Microsoft and Netscape 
would market. In his fourth day cross-examining James Barksdale, president 
and chief executive of Netscape, John Warden, Microsoft's lead lawyer, 
asked the question that framed what he called the ``set up'' defense. 
``Isn't it a fact,'' Warden declared, ``that the June 21, 1995, meeting 
was held for the purpose of creating something that could be described 
as a record to be given to the Justice Department to spur them on 
to take action against Microsoft?'' Barksdale replied, ``That's absurd.'' 
David Boies, the Justice Department's trial counsel, said the subpoena 
for information was issued to Netscape in connection with another 
inquiry into Microsoft that the government was already conducting 
at the time. Boies said Microsoft's effort to portray the June 1995 
meeting as a Netscape conspiracy suggested that Microsoft's lawyers 
were straining to try to discredit a powerful allegation in the government's 
case. ``Any time a defendant says, `We were set up,' I think that 
tells you how a trial is going,'' Boies said. The subpoena issued 
by the Justice Department the day after the Netscape-Microsoft meeting 
does refer specifically to a separate matter that the government was 
investigating at the time: Microsoft's plan to bundle its online service, 
Microsoft Network, or MSN, with its new operating system, Windows 
95, which was shipped two months later, in August 1995. That investigation 
had been undertaken after America Online complained that placing a 
direct link to MSN from the Windows 95 desktop was an unfair leveraging 
of Microsoft's monopoly in operating systems. (That complaint was 
eventually settled when Microsoft agreed to place a link to America 
Online on the Windows desktop _ but only after the online service 
agreed to distribute Microsoft's browser to all its millions of members. 
David Colburn, a senior vice-president of America Online, is expected 
to testify about that deal later this week.) In the end, the Justice 
Department took no action to prevent Windows 95 from being shipped 
with a link to Microsoft Network. Yet the June 23, 1995, response 
by Gary L. Reback, then a Netscape lawyer, to the Justice Department's 
subpoena for information in the MSN investigation focused mainly on 
the meeting two days earlier. Reback's four-page letter states that 
at the meeting, Microsoft said it would not provide Netscape with 
necessary technical information unless ``Microsoft gets an equity 
interest in Netscape, a seat on Netscape's board of directors, and 
otherwise controls Netscape's ability to compete against Microsoft.'' 
Later, Reback, a partner at Wilson Sonsini Goodrich &AMP; Rosati, 
wrote that Microsoft had made it clear that if Netscape was going 
to compete with Microsoft ``in any way,'' then Microsoft ``will competitively 
harm Netscape.'' Attached to Reback's letter was a copy of the notes 
taken at the June 1995 meeting by Marc Andreessen, a co-founder of 
Netscape, in which he described the ``threat'' by Microsoft that it 
planned to ``own'' the market for browsers that run on Windows 95 
and that ``Netscape should stay away.'' In its motion seeking sanctions 
against the Justice Department on Monday, Microsoft said, ``The recently 
produced documents demonstrate quite clearly that the June 21, 1995, 
meeting was a `set up' orchestrated by Netscape's counsel.'' Later 
on Monday, Microsoft introduced documents and memos from Netscape's 
files suggesting that the company had lost an important corporate 
customer to Microsoft largely because of Netscape's own failings, 
not because of predatory behavior by Microsoft. In 1996, Intuit, maker 
of Quicken, the popular personal-finance software, asked Netscape 
to provide a customized version of Netscape for use with Quicken. 
The Netscape documents suggest that the company could not provide 
the new software for many months. One slide from an internal Netscape 
presentation shown in court on Monday included the heading ``We offered, 
but did not deliver'' the five custom modifications to the program 
that Quicken had wanted. ``While you were trying to figure things 
out,'' Warden said, ``Microsoft had already offered'' a customized 
version of its browser. Barksdale acknowledged that Netscape had made 
errors, but added, ``I don't think that was the primary reason we 
did not get the business.'' Microsoft offered Intuit special inducements 
that Netscape could not match, he said, including free software and 
special coding in Windows that made Quicken easier to run. After four 
full days off cross examination, Warden closed the questioning of 
Barksdale on Monday evening by entering into evidence a note written 
in jest by several employees for display on Netscape's internal computer 
network. ``Next Monday Netscape will release two or three more bug-ridden 
beta versions'' of Netscape Navigator, the note began, adding that 
the program ``is faster than a dog with no legs, if the dog's up to 
his waist in treacle. And dead.'' Barksdale explained, ``We allow 
our employees to let off steam this way. Mostly they complain about 
the food in the cafeteria.''
