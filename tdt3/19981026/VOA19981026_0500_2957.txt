And now, with the results from the markets in Asia today's trading, 
here's Victor Vidi. Japanese stock slipped for a second session today 
as investors see share prices having outstripped earnings potential 
in view of Japan's worst recession in 50 years. Tokyo's Nikkei stock 
index closed down 301, about 2 percent, to 13843. That's 64 percent 
below its all-time high reached back in December 1989. The U.S. dollar 
which was put at late Friday in New York at 117.92 yen strengthened 
in Tokyo. Bank of Japan's governor holds out little hope Japan's recession 
will end soon. Musaro Hyami says he expects the bank's recent rate 
cut and the government stimulus package to help but says banks overburdened 
with debt remain cautious about lending. And that's resulting in a 
sharp drop in capital investment.
