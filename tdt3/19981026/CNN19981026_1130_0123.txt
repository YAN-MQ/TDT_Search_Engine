Israeli prime minister Benjamin Netanyahu is trying to fend off political 
threats from opponents of the mideast peace agreement. Extreme right 
wing members of parliament have submitted a no-confidence motion to 
be voted on in parliament today. Netanyahu is expected to beat that 
vote with support from the labor party. On another front, a parliamentary 
committee has begun the process of calling for early elections. If 
approved, elections would be held within 100 days. Netanyahu's land-for-peace 
deal is generating protests outside parliament. In Jerusalem last 
night, Israeli police clashed with demonstrators who blocked roads 
to show their opposition to the agreement.
