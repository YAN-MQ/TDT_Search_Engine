From National Public Radio News in Washington, I'm Corey Flintoff. 
Senator John Glenn arrived at the Kennedy Space Center today as the 
countdown began for Thursday's planned launch of the Space Shuttle 
Discovery. The 77-year-old Democrat from Ohio will join a crew of 
six other astronauts on a mission that will include research into 
the effects of aging on performance in space. Glenn won fame as the 
first American in space in 1962. Weather forecasters say there's a 
60 percent chance the weather will cooperate during the shuttle's 
2-1/2 hour launch window on Thursday afternoon. Critics of Glenn's 
role in the mission say it has little scientific value and is largely 
a public relations opportunity for the space program and a reward 
for one of the program's strongest supporters in Congress.
