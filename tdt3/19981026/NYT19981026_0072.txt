One of the bellwethers for next month's elections is taking milkshake 
orders from a late-night party of 25 in the Tastee Diner here _ all 
separate checks, she notes, with a sort of kindly grimace. No, says 
the waitress, Carol Chavez, with enviable patience, she was not previously 
aware that she is a member of the hot political swing group of the 
moment, the ``waitress moms.'' ``I've just been trying to raise my 
kids,'' she says. ``I work two jobs, so I don't listen to any of it.'' 
Like ``angry white men'' and ``soccer moms'' before them, waitress 
moms are said to be the group to watch in the elections this year. 
They are low-income working women _ not just those who wait tables 
_ and are mostly white and under 50 with a high school education. 
And while they may be Democrats at heart, they tend to sit out elections 
when they don't see the political debate as relevant to their families. 
The scandal involving President Clinton seems to have troubled a good 
number of them, pollsters have said. And now no one knows if they'll 
turn out on Nov. 3 _ or how they'll vote if they do show up. Ms. Chavez, 
who turns 50 on Tuesday, says she, for one, won't vote, or even tune 
into the debate. She has children aged 9, 15 and 19, and everything 
she's got goes into providing for them. Her co-worker, Janet Pochon, 
a 41-year-old mother of three handing out burgers at a pretty good 
clip, is a lifelong Democrat who twice voted for Bill Clinton but 
will also be staying home this year. ``I'm just really depressed with 
everything that's going on with Clinton and it's really turned me 
off,'' she said. At what moment did the Democrats lose her? ``When 
Clinton admitted he lied,'' Ms. Pochon said. ``You put your trust 
in somebody and they break that trust. I'm sure there are a lot of 
people just like me.'' And that, of course, is the Democrats' biggest 
fear, and the reason women like Ms. Pochon and Ms. Chavez are so sought 
after by both parties this year. Celinda Lake, the Democratic pollster 
who coined the term waitress moms in 1996, said she dreamed it up 
in an effort to remind Democrats of the importance of the voters down 
market from the soccer mom. ``I was trying to think: What's the downscale 
version of the soccer moms _ the women who don't have a minivan and 
a cleaning lady and have to take their kids to their mother's house 
at 4 in the morning on their way to work?'' she said. ``They're values 
oriented,'' Ms. Lake said. ``They think the president has done a good 
job, but they're troubled by his personal life. They've been swung 
back and forth by events, so they're a question mark.'' And they seem 
to be a newly volatile factor in the gender gap, the tendency of women 
to vote heavily Democratic, which has helped President Clinton in 
the past. In this midterm election, in which a lower-than-normal turnout 
could hurt Democrats, the waitress moms are more important than ever, 
and more unpredictable. So the term has stuck this year, with these 
women symbolizing the ambivalence and uncertainty of a strange political 
season. Still, there are doubts about Ms. Lake's catchy phrase: Is 
it mostly a marketing buzz phrase designed to motivate Democrats? 
Has it caught on merely as a way for political reporters to enjoy 
an order of fries on the job while interviewing the female equivalent 
of the much-quoted taxi driver? And is it even a good way to sum up 
working-class women? (When these women are asked to describe themselves, 
Ms. Lake said, their No. 1 response is ``tired.'') ``I hate the term 
_ waitress moms is a little derogatory,'' says Stephanie Cohen, spokeswoman 
for Emily's List, the women's advocacy group whose own pollster, Ms. 
Lake, made it up. (Ms. Cohen prefers ``drop-off women.'' And no, that 
doesn't refer to the mothers queued up in the parking lot to let their 
kids out at the school door, but to the fact that low-income women 
are less likely to vote in off-year elections.) Andrew Kohut, an independent 
pollster for the Pew Research Center for the People and the Press, 
says the new formulation mostly fills the need for political theater 
and good visuals. ``This comes from focus groups as the new political 
insider's wisdom, and it's a myth,'' he said, adding that he sees 
no evidence that these women are any more or less likely to vote this 
year than in any off-year. Of course, this is only one way to describe 
one of many voting blocs that could be crucial to this or any other 
election. But both parties seem to be taking the waitress-moms concept 
seriously, targeting the group heavily with mailings and advertising 
campaigns that emphasize resonant themes like education, social security 
and the reform of health-maintenance organizations. The AFL-CIO is 
sponsoring 2,000 events with them in mind, mostly small gatherings 
to be held in kitchens and job sites all over the country. Ms. Cohen 
said polling shows that this group is turned off by heavy partisanship 
and is almost solely focused on practical questions like, ``Can I 
pick my own doctor?'' And these days, the waitress moms seem more 
favorably disposed to Hillary Rodham Clinton than to her husband. 
Ms. Lake said that in a recent poll in a Southern border state she 
would not name, 46 percent of them said they liked the president. 
That's compared with the 64 percent who felt an affinity for the first 
lady. Mrs. Clinton has been campaigning heavily, and signed a letter 
that Emily's List sent to many of the 2 million waitress moms targeted 
by the group. But just getting these women to the polls is only part 
of the challenge for Democrats, said Garry South, campaign director 
for Gray Davis, the Democratic candidate for governor of California. 
South warned that efforts to pursue this group will backfire on candidates 
who try to win over waitress moms without knowing them well enough. 
``They're a subset of what's come to be known as the Reagan Democrats, 
who vote Democrat but will desert you in a second if something doesn't 
smell right,'' he said. ``They're fickle, frustrated and hard to fathom, 
and Democrats cannot simply turn out waitress moms through a get-out-the-vote 
campaign.'' At the Allen County Republican Party's annual bean dinner 
in Fort Wayne, Ind., on Friday night, the featured speaker, former 
Vice President Dan Quayle, said Republicans were the waitress moms' 
true friends. ``Think of the waitress that works extra hours at night 
so she can buy a book for her child,'' he told the crowd. ``She might 
want to be at her son or daughter's soccer game, but she has to work 
because of high taxes.'' A number of Republicans are running advertising 
campaigns emphasizing education and other matters of particular interest 
to these women. And both parties seem to see waitress moms wagging 
a finger at them, warning that they won't be ignored this year. That 
image, and the whole metaphor of the waitress mom, ``is somewhat an 
oversimplification,'' South admitted. ``But it's a useful way to characterize 
for the Democrats why you have to pay attention to someone other than 
the soccer mom.''
