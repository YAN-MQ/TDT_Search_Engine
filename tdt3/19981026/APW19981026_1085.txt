People fled their coastal homes and the government sent Air Force 
planes to pluck residents off of remote Caribbean islands Monday as 
the season's most powerful hurricane swirled toward Central America. 
Hurricane Mitch became a Category 5 hurricane on Monday, with winds 
of 170 mph (275 kph). At 1700 GMT, Mitch's center was 55 miles (90 
kilometers) east-southeast of Honduras' Swan Island and was moving 
west-northwest at 8 mph (13 kph). ``Some fluctuations in strength 
are possible ... but Mitch is expected to remain a very dangerous 
hurricane capable of causing catastrophic damage,'' the U.S. National 
Weather Service said in a statement from its National Hurricane Center 
in Miami. Jerry Jarrell, director of the center, said it was the strongest 
hurricane since Gilbert in 1988. President Carlos Flores Facusse declared 
a state of alert. He told residents of coastal areas to leave their 
homes for more secure ground inland, but didn't tell them where to 
stay. ``Where can I go if I leave my house? The government hasn't 
opened a single shelter,'' asked Pedro Martinez, an electrician in 
the northern city of San Pedro Sula, 100 miles (160 kilometers) north 
of the capital. San Pedro Sula's mayor and the Red Cross said they 
might set up shelters in public schools. In La Ceiba, on Honduras' 
western coast, people stood in long lines at gas stations under a 
steady rain. Maria Gonzalez bought only 5 lempiras (37 cents) worth 
of gas, saying it was all she could afford. She needed the gasoline 
to cook in case her firewood gets wet, she said. ``I have six children 
and we live in a riverbed,'' she said. ``If it gets real bad we'll 
go to the church and see what the architect of the world has in store 
for us.'' The president ordered all of the Air Force's planes to evacuate 
people from the Islas de la Bahia, a string of small islands off the 
coast of central Honduras. Swinwick Jackson, a fisherman on the island 
of Utila, said he had tied up his boats and was planning to take his 
family to higher ground, to stay with a relative. Speaking by telephone, 
he said most tourists had left on Sunday but that some were stuck, 
and that hotels were moving tourists to houses in the mountains. Before 
moving toward Honduras, Mitch swept past Jamaica and the Caymans. 
Rain squalls flooded streets in the Jamaican capital of Kingston, 
and government offices and schools closed in the Cayman Islands, a 
British colony of 28,000 people. Heavy rains began to fall along the 
Honduran coast on Sunday night, and the outer winds of the hurricane 
were expected to sweep along the coast on Monday and Tuesday. Flores 
ordered all public offices closed on the Atlantic coast as of noon 
Monday, and canceled all classes at public and private schools. Health 
officials sent medicine to public hospitals along the coast. ``We're 
ready for whatever situation occurs in the northern zone,'' said Vice 
President Billy Handal. ``I ask God to be benevolent with Hondurans.'' 
In 1974, Hurricane Fifi swept Honduras' Caribbean coast, killing at 
least 2,000 people and destroying 70 percent of the country's infrastructure.
