Pakistan expects an economic bail out package because ``it's not in 
the interest of lenders to see Pakistan default on its payments,'' 
a senior government official said Monday. Pakistan has restarted stalled 
negotiations with the International Monetary Fund, according to Ashan 
Iqbal, deputy chief of Pakistan's Planning Commission. ``I am optimistic 
that the country will get a bailout package because it's not in the 
interest of lenders to see Pakistan defaulting on the loan repayments,'' 
he said. The package will have to come in the next few weeks if Pakistan 
is to avoid a default on repayment of its dlrs 32 billion external 
debt. ``We are in negotiations with the international lending agencies 
and we hope that an agreement will be reached in the next few weeks,'' 
Iqbal said in an interview Monday. ``The government has arranged for 
all essential debt servicing in the coming weeks. . . by that time 
we will be able to reach an agreement with the IMF.'' Pakistan, hurt 
by international sanctions after conducting nuclear tests in May and 
suffering from falling foreign exchange reserves, is trying to get 
a bail out package of dlrs 5 billion from global lenders. Earlier 
Pakistan warned it will request a moratorium if it doesn't get the 
international help it needs. Western economists say Pakistan desperately 
needs to restructure its loans and receive emergency funds to keep 
its ailing economy afloat. ``Our economy was improving during the 
last one year until it was hit by sanctions. . . but it is a temporary 
crisis which will be managed,'' Iqbal said. Last week, the IMF deferred 
loan talks with Pakistan after Prime Minister Nawaz Sharif's government 
slashed electricity tariffs by 30 percent despite a demand by global 
donors that he increase utility rates. The government also is in the 
middle of a feud with private power companies accusing them of charging 
inflated rates to the state utility company, Water and Power Development 
Authority. Iqbal said Sharif has ordered the dispute settled amicably, 
but it wasn't immediately clear how that was to occur. The government 
wants the rates charged by the power companies reduced, but so far 
they are resisting. Iqbal said Pakistan's beleaguered economy also 
is the result of 51 years of neglect and distorted policies. ``The 
government is taking steps, but there are no quick fixes. . . . it 
requires sustained efforts to implement the reform program,'' he added.
