An Israeli security guard was shot in the neck and his body thrown 
from a moving car in downtown Hebron Monday in what appeared to be 
an attack by Palestinian militants. There was no immediately claim 
of responsibility for the killing. However, several Israelis have 
been killed in tense Hebron in the past by militants hoping to wreck 
Mideast peacemaking. The last such killing was in August when a member 
of the Islamic militant group Hamas stabbed to death an elderly rabbi. 
Israeli radio reporters cited Israeli security officials as saying 
the assailants apparently were Palestinian militants. Israel has been 
bracing for terror attacks in recent weeks, and especially since the 
signing of a new peace agreement between Israel and the Palestinians 
in Washington last week. Monday's incident occurred shortly after 
2 p.m. (noon gmt) in the downtown Shaaba neighborhood of Hebron, in 
an area that is under Israeli control and located about 400 meters 
(yards) from the Jewish settlement of Kiryat Arba. Several Palestinian 
journalists were walking along Wadi Abu Salim Street in the Shaaba 
neighborhood when they saw a car drive by at high speed. A car door 
opened and the body was dumped on the pavement, the journalists said. 
The victim, dressed in white shorts and a blue T-shirt, lay sprawled 
face down on the pavement. A puddle of blood spread below the head. 
The man wore a wedding band and the black strap of his sunglasses 
had Hebrew writing. He wore only one tennis shoe. The car drove away. 
Journalists said they notified Israeli and Palestinian police forces. 
The first to arrive at the scene were Palestinian paramedics who tried 
to revive the victim and then pronounced him dead. They said he had 
been shot in the neck. Israeli police told their Palestinian counterparts 
that the victim worked as a security guard at an electricity station 
in the Israeli-controlled sector of Hebron and was a resident of Kiryat 
Arba. Israeli officers said the assailants had used the victim's car 
to escape and requested that Palestinian police help in finding the 
vehicle.
