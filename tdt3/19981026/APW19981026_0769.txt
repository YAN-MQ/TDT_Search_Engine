An Israeli security guard was shot in the neck and his dead body thrown 
from a moving car Monday in Hebron in an apparent attack by Palestinian 
militants. There was no immediate claim of responsibility for the 
slaying. Several Israelis have been killed in Hebron in the past by 
militants hoping to wreck Mideast peacemaking. The most recent such 
killing was in August, when a rabbi was slain by a member of the Islamic 
militant group Hamas. Israeli radio reporters cited Israeli security 
officials as saying the assailants apparently were Palestinian militants. 
Israel has been bracing for terror attacks in recent weeks, and especially 
since the signing of a new peace agreement between Israel and the 
Palestinians in Washington last week. Monday's killing occurred shortly 
after 2 p.m. (noon GMT) in the downtown Shaaba neighborhood of Hebron, 
an area that is under Israeli control and about 400 yards (meters) 
from the Jewish settlement of Kiryat Arba. Several Palestinian journalists 
were driving in the neighborhood when they saw a car coming toward 
them at high speed. They then saw a body lying on the pavement, the 
journalists said. The victim, dressed in white shorts and a blue T-shirt, 
lay sprawled face down on the pavement. A puddle of blood spread below 
his head. The man wore a wedding band and the black strap of his sunglasses 
had Hebrew writing. He wore only one tennis shoe. The car drove away, 
and was later found abandoned in the Palestinian-run area of Hebron. 
Palestinian paramedics pronounced the victim dead at the scene. They 
said he had been shot three times in the neck, chest and hand. Israeli 
police told their Palestinian counterparts that the victim worked 
as a security guard at an electric station in the Israeli-controlled 
sector of Hebron and was a resident of Kiryat Arba. Israeli officers 
said the assailants escaped in the victim's car.
