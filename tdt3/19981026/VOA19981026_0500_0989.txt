Hurricane Mitch is gaining strength in the Western Caribbean, heading 
toward the Cayman Islands. The U.S. National Weather Service says 
a hurricane watch and a tropical storm warning are in effect for the 
islands, where coastal flooding from onshore winds has already begun. 
The Weather Service has removed a hurricane watch from Jamaica but 
said residents there should still exercise caution. Forecasters say 
Jamaica could receive heavy rain over the next two days. Hurricane 
Mitch is currently moving west at 13 kilometers per hour, with sustained 
winds of more than 230 kilometers per hour.
