World Boxing Council President Jose Sulaiman called Monday for an 
end to the proliferation of international boxing bodies. Sulaiman 
made the appeal at the opening of the WBC's annual convention, in 
which boxing promoters were to consider accepting an agreement to 
unify rules with the World Boxing Association. The agreement _ hammered 
out by the WBC and the WBA in a meeting in Mexico City last April 
_ is aimed at standardizing the names of weight categories, the awarding 
of points, procedures for drug testing and could eventually result 
in only one champion in each weight category. Sulaiman urged an investigation 
into international boxing organizations, saying they must prove the 
validity of their alleged world status. If action was not taken soon, 
``boxing will die in 50 years, and will become merely a circus,'' 
he told WBC delegates at a convention center north of Johannesburg. 
Major boxing bodies include the WBC, the WBA, the International Boxing 
Federation and the World Boxing Organization. (sapa-aos) ``It is time 
to stop deceiving the boxing fans of the world,'' said Sulaiman, opening 
the annual WBC convention in Johannesburg in front of a gathering 
which included former amateur boxer President Mandela. ``Most of these 
champions, with all due respect, are not champions of the world,'' 
he said. ``Those organisations are selling to the people a lie, and 
to sell a lie is nothing but a fraud. ``Let us stop it for the sake 
of credibility, for the sake of the respect that the sport of boxing 
deserves.'' In an emotion-charged speech paying tribute to President 
Mandela and emphasising the WBC's role in condemning apartheid over 
the years, Sulaiman also urged the establishment of a fund so that 
boxing could provide pensions ``for our heroes of the past.'' He had 
learned Monday of the plight of former boxers Alphonse Halimi of Algeria 
and Lote Mwale of Zambia, who were both in a sad financial way. The 
WBC would give both monthly pensions, he said, but more had to be 
done for the many ex-boxers in a similar situation. Sulaiman said 
he would propose this week that new championships should be launched 
for boxers of 21 and younger. The aim would be to give young fighters 
something to aim at, and obviate the need to take on old fighters 
before they were mature, ``and overcome professional sharks who have 
stopped and hurt so many young boxers, paying them peanuts.'' Sulaiman 
presented President Mandela with the WBC's Award of Human Dignity 
and a WBC championship belt. Sapa
