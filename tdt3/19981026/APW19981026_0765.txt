England's quest to host the 2006 World Cup took a hit Monday when 
the head of FIFA _ the governing body of world soccer _ told Prime 
Minister Tony Blair that Africa was the ``logical'' choice for soccer's 
showcase. FIFA president Sepp Blatter met for 45 minutes Monday at 
No. 10 Downing Street with Blair and English soccer officials pushing 
the England bid. Bidding opens next month and England, South Africa 
and Germany are regarded as the main contenders. Blatter said he also 
expects bids from Brazil, Morocco, Nigeria and Egypt. The winner will 
be announced in March 2000 after a vote by a 24-member FIFA committee. 
While campaigning in June for the FIFA presidency, Blatter said Africa 
was the logical choice following the 1994 World Cup in the United 
States, the 1998 tournament in France, and the 2002 World Cup to be 
shared between South Korea and Japan. ``I have just confirmed to the 
prime minister that I have not changed my attitude, which I had when 
I campaigned for president,'' Blatter said. ``I repeated to the prime 
minister that if an African nation... will meet all the conditions 
_ stadia, systems of transport, telecommunications, security, hotels 
and so on....then it would be logical to give the 2006 World Cup to 
an African country,'' he said. Blatter said he wasn't put off by a 
recent upsurge in English soccer violence, which included widely reported 
rioting by English fans in Marseilles during the World Cup. ``I'm 
not concerned about hooliganism in England,'' he said. ``I'm concerned 
about hooligans accompanying the England team.'' Despite Blatter's 
preference for Africa, British Sports Minister Tony Banks remained 
upbeat about England's chances. ``I believe it is now between us and 
South Africa,'' he said. ``Basically we are ready for 2006. All we 
need now is for the redevelopment of Wembley to get under way.'' Banks 
said hooliganism should not hamper England's candidacy. ``The prime 
minister made it quite clear that legislation is going to be brought 
forward with regards to tightening a number of loopholes that exist 
in dealing with these people (hooligans),'' he said. Germany's World 
Cup bid, which is supported by UEFA president Lennart Johansson, received 
a boost this weekend when Franz Beckenbauer was elected vice president 
of the German soccer federation.
