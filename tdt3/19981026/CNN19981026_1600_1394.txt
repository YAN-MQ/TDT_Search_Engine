I wish... come on, girl. I wish I had an elephant. An elephant. Who'd 
always play with me. Bye-bye. But wishes are like elephants. They're 
bigger than can be. O.K., maybe you can't give her everything her 
heart desires. But with the humongous purchase power of the visa platinum 
card, maybe you can. And besides, you never know what she'll want 
next. If you looked into your local carrier's phone lines what time 
period would they place your company in? Why live in the past... when 
local's future is right through here? On-net. Where local, national 
and global all flow over one network, owned by one company. Oh, and 
did I mention... it'll save you money? On-net. From MCI Worldcom.
