Can you believe it has been 30 years since The Beatle's "White Album" 
was released? THE BEATLES I look at the world and I know this is turning. 
While my guitar gently weeps. Every mistake we must surely be learning. 
Still my guitar gently weeps. Oh. Next month, Capitol Records will 
be reissuing a 30th anniversary limited edition of "The Beatles" -- 
that's the real name of the group's white album. This digitally remastered 
album will be individually numbered and will contain a copy of the 
original poster and baseball card sized versions of the four color 
photos that came in the original album.
