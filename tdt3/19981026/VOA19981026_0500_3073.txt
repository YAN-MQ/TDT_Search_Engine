Russia's prime minister Yevgeny Primakov is to meet with his top ministers 
to consider a long-awaited program to pull Russia out of its economic 
crisis. He's been criticized for taking too much time coming up with 
a coherent plan to tackle Russia's problems. Mr. Primakov says he'll 
not be hurried by what must be a well-considered plan to revive the 
country's crumbling financial sector, restoring faith in the ruble 
and solving the huge debt problem.
