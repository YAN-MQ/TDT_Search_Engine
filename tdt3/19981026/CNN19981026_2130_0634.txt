First it was El Nino, now it's La Nina. Marcia wall ton has more in 
this tech trends. Hurricanes, floods and fires -- the pacific weather 
phenomena known as El Nino and La Nina have caught the blame for them 
all this year. And it's not over yet. In the pacific, just within 
the past week, two typhoons have hit philippines, causing $56 million 
where as last year 70% decrease in agriculture due to dramatic drought 
brought on by El Nino. Oceanographers say the warming of pacific waters 
during El Nino, and the cooling during La Nina, load the climate dice 
for sometimes wild weather changes. The pacific ocean is about one-third 
the circumference of the globe, all the way around. So we're really 
talking about change of surface sea temperature of truly global proportions. 
One of those global effects -- more hurricanes in the atlantic. 13 
named tropical storms this year, versus only seven in 1997. This La 
Nina should be with us through spring. Its next delivery? When this 
warm water over in the west is pushed farther than normal, quite often 
it results in warmer and drier conditions over the southern tier of 
the U.S. and cooler and sometimes enhanced precipitation over the 
northern tier of states. Scientists have stepped up their study from 
above and below the pacific surface. Better predictions could help 
with all sorts of long-term decisions, from which crops to plant, 
to how much heating oil to buy. Marsha Walton, CNN.
