India's one billion Hindus still generally observe a caste system 
which prohibits members born into one caste from marrying into another. 
The system is thought to have prevailed for more than 2,000 years, 
long enough to have impressed a subtle genetic signature on the population, 
according to a team of American and Indian biologists. Although marriage 
within one's own caste is strongly preferred, women are occasionally 
allowed to marry men of higher caste, with their children assuming 
their father's status. This practice gives rise to a rigidly stratified 
population in which women have slight upward mobility but men none. 
Population geneticists can track the lineages of men and women separately 
by looking at regions of DNA that are inherited exclusively through 
the male line (the Y chromosome) or the female line (the mitochondria, 
cellular organelles bequeathed by the egg and not the sperm). Sampling 
DNA from people of various castes in Andhra Pradesh, a province in 
southern India, the biologists report in last week's issue of Nature 
that there is indeed a significant genetic distance, as measured by 
the number of differences in the DNA, between women in the higher 
and lower castes. The differences can be explained by a low level 
of gene flow carried by women moving one way in a firmly layered system. 
If women moved both ways, or not at all, there would be little difference 
between the castes. The differences in DNA from the Y chromosome, 
on the other hand, were minor and probably arose from random mutation, 
the researchers say. The DNA differences in question make no difference 
to the people involved because they are not part of the genes. Population 
geneticists prefer to study non-gene DNA because it changes quite 
often, whereas most mutations in the genes are harmful and quickly 
eliminated. Dr. Michael J. Bamshad of the University of Utah, a co-author 
of the study, said that he and his colleagues at Andhra University 
in India hoped to extend their methods to explore the population history 
of India and the role of different groups in the caste system. ``There 
has been a greater Asian influence in the lower and middle castes, 
and a greater Caucasian contribution to the upper castes,'' he said, 
a finding which probably reflects the Indoeuropean invasion of India. 
The genetic traces of women trickling up through the caste system, 
Bamshad said, ``demonstrates that social proceses such as mating patterns 
can leave an indelible imprint on the human genome. It also shows 
how powerful genetic analysis is for revealing human history.''
