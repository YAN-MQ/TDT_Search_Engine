The countdown is on for pioneer astronaut John Glenn to go back into 
space. It happens Thursday aboard the U.S. shuttle Discovery. The 
purpose of the nine-day mission is to conduct 83 science experiments. 
But attention will be focused on Senator Glenn, who, at 77, will be 
the oldest person to fly in space. At space flight headquarters in 
Houston, U.S. defense secretary William Cohen praised Mr. Glenn. This 
is VOA News.
