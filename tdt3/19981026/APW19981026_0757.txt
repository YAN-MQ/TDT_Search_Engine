International police officials have approved an Egyptian proposal 
that calls for increased cooperation to fight terrorism, Egypt's Middle 
East News Agency reported Monday. The proposal, presented at the 67th 
General Assembly of Interpol, stressed the need to ``overcome obstacles 
impeding the handing over of terrorists,'' the agency reported. The 
plan also calls for the convening of an international conference on 
combating terrorism. Egypt, which has suffered major attacks from 
Islamic militants, has been lobbying for such a summit, arguing that 
terrorism is a global phenomenon. Late last year, Islamic militants 
killed 67 tourists in two separate attacks. The proposal was accepted 
by 103 countries. Five nations abstained and one voted against the 
draft.
