Alex Mandl, who resigned as president of AT&AMP;T in 1996, has kept 
a low profile recently. Ever since his new company, Teligent, went 
public last fall, he has kept his head down _ quietly securing additional 
financing, building networks and constructing a sales force. Mandl 
hopes to make his triumphant return to the forefront of the telecommunications 
industry today as Teligent announces that it is open for business 
in 10 of the nation's largest markets, including New York, Los Angeles, 
Chicago and Washington. Like many other companies, Teligent hopes 
to woo business customers away from phone companies with an integrated 
bundle of local, long-distance and data communications services. But 
unlike most new communications carriers, Teligent plans to use wireless 
technology to transmit digital data at high speeds. Using advanced, 
foot-wide antennae, Teligent hopes to offer clients savings of up 
to 30 percent under the rates charged by older carriers. Teligent, 
based in Vienna, Va., has had minuscule revenue _ $3.3 million last 
year. But as the former heir apparent at AT&AMP;T, Mandl, Teligent's 
chairman, has had the credibility on Wall Street to line up major 
financing, with about $1.4 billion available. That is enough to finance 
the company through the year 2000, Mandl said on Monday. So as many 
small telecommunications stocks suffer after concern over financing, 
Teligent's shares have held up well, closing on Monday at $29.875, 
up $1.0625, in Nasdaq trading. That is relatively close to its high 
of $35.375 in February and above its initial offering price of $21.50. 
(Last week, Winstar Communications, another new wireless company that 
is Teligent's archrival, secured $2 billion in financing from Lucent 
Technologies.)
