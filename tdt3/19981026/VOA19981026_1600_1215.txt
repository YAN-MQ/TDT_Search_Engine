Staying with soccer news, the Chicago Fire are the new champions of 
Major League Soccer. The Fire, a brand-new team playing in its first 
season, overpowered two-time defending MLS cup champion D.C. United 
in the Rose Bowl in Pasadena, California, Sunday. VOA's Mike O'Sullivan 
has more. The Chicago Fire has defeated two-time MLS champion D.C. 
United by a score of 2-0. Chicago scored both goals in the first half 
of the game. The first was by forward Jerzy Podbrozny with assists 
from Ante Razov and Peter Nowak. The second was by midfielder Diego 
Gutierrez, again with an assist from Nowak. The Chicago win ends talk 
of a D.C. United dynasty in U.S. soccer and brings another championship 
cup to Chicago, a city known for its winning sports teams. But at 
the beginning of this season, no one could have predicted that the 
Chicago Fire, an expansion team would cap its first year in professional 
soccer with the MLS cup. Reporting from the Pasadena Rose Bowl, I'm 
Mike O'Sullivan, VOA Sports.
