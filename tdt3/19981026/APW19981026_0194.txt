A Sudanese air force plane dropped seven bombs around a hospital in 
the country's south, killing three people and damaging a community 
corn flour mill, a relief official said Monday. The raid by an Antonov, 
which had been converted into a bomber, occurred Friday in Yei, about 
120 kilometers (74 miles) southwest of Juba, said Dan Effie, a spokesman 
for the Norwegian People's Aid. The Norwegian humanitarian organization 
runs the hospital and the mill, Effie said. The hospital treats civilians, 
rebels and government troops captured by the SPLA. ``This is totally 
a civilian target,'' Effie said. ``Yet they continually bomb it. ``A 
person once wounded is no longer a combatant.'' It was the fifth time 
government planes have bombed Yei since it was captured by the rebel 
Sudan People's Liberation Army in March 1997. Effie said the hospital 
appeared to be the target in every raid. There was no independent 
confirmation of the bombing on Friday, but NPA has in the past provided 
reliable reports. Juba, a provincial capital about 1,200 kilometers 
(744 miles) south of the Sudanese capital, Khartoum, is the largest 
town in southern Sudan still under government control. Government 
forces and rebels are fighting 72 kilometers (45 miles) east of Juba. 
The SPLA said its forces on Saturday shot down a Russian-built MiG 
23 fighter of the Sudanese air force near al-Jabalain, 64 kilometers 
(40 miles) east of Juba, while the jet was on a mission supporting 
a government ground attack. On Sunday, the Sudan military said the 
plane did not fall to rebel fire but crashed due to a ``technical 
fault.'' The pilot died in the crash, the command said. The SPLA has 
been fighting since 1983 for autonomy from the Muslim and Arab-dominated 
north for southern Sudan where Christians and followers of traditional 
religion form the majority. The rebels have never been able to capture 
Juba, a strategic goal in their campaign.
