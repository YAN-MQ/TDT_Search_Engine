Companies buying or selling personal data in the Netherlands, beware 
_ the Dutch government is going all-out to protect the personal data 
of its citizens. The Data Protection Commission, part of the Dutch 
Ministry of Justice, acts as a watchdog for consumers whose personal 
information may be bartered for marketing purposes without their consent. 
``We want to see people made more aware of the consequences of giving 
out personal information,'' commission spokesman Erik Bogaards said 
Monday. ``People are often bombarded with information they didn't 
ask for. It's an irritation.'' On Sunday, an EU law came into effect 
to protect data privacy. The law has already been written into the 
statute books of Greece and Portugal, and is also being implemented 
in Britain, Sweden and Italy along with additional rules. In the Netherlands, 
Boogards' commission keeps a watch out for more serious violations 
of privacy laws, which prohibit the use of personal information for 
anything other than the original intent for which it was solicited. 
Recently, the commission has observed a lurking danger in the privatization 
of government agencies, Bogaards said. As private companies take over 
government duties such as distribution of employee benefits, the companies 
become privy to personal information that may tempt some to sell or 
use for their own marketing efforts. Though the agency does not enforce 
privacy laws, it does make recommendations that, if presented in a 
court, are taken very seriously, Bogaards said. ``It's taken nearly 
as seriously as a court order,'' he said. The agency, which has been 
protecting the privacy of the Dutch since 1989, handles about 7,000 
inquiries a year, Bogaards said. Most of those are consumers or companies 
seeking the government's free information about the legality of specific 
use of personal information. This year, the commission investigated 
Jehovah's Witnesses who may have used illegal methods to obtain information. 
People complained that the religious group targeted disabled people 
for their home visits. That case is still under review, Bogaards said. 
``People are not aware of the implications when they hand over personal 
data,'' he said. ``Then they are surprised when they are bombarded 
with information. They just don't see the connection.'' The registry 
usually issues advice to the parties involved following an investigation 
but it can also inform prosecutors if illegal practices are uncovered. 
Bogaards said criminal proceedings are unusual in such cases.
