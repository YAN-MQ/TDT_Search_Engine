Nigeria's military ruler Gen. Abdulsalami Abubakar has warned soldiers 
not to intervene in the West African country's planned transition 
to democracy unless called on by politicians. ``The Nigerian army 
must remain a stabilizing factor ready to do our best to ensure continuity,'' 
Abubakar said in a leaflet of military guidelines handed out recently 
to troops. ``Military action is subordinate to political will.'' In 
the leaflet, which stressed the need to restore professionalism to 
Nigeria's military ranks, Abubakar accused officers of vying amongst 
themselves for power and prestige. Some officers ``resort to intrigues 
and disrespect of the military way of doing things,'' Abubakar said 
adding that cover-ups of military failures were common. Since taking 
power in June following the sudden death of his predecessor, the late 
dictator Gen. Sani Abacha, Abubakar has promised sweeping reforms 
of the country's political landscape. Civilian elections are planned 
for Feb. 27 and a handover of power at the end of May.
