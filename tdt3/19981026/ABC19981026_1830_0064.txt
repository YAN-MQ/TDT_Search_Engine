Good evening. In Amherst, New York, near Buffalo today, someone put 
up a picture of the doctor that was killed. And a sign that said respect 
life, don't murder doctors. Dr. Barnett slepian, as much of the country 
must know by now, is the latest obstetrician and gynecologist to be 
attacked, murdered in his case, ostensibly because he performed abortions. 
There's a $100,000 reward now for information leading to his killer. 
Dr slepian was 52. He performed abortions, said a friend, because 
he believed a woman had the right to choose. But he was having babies 
come into the world said another, that was his life. He was buried 
today in Amherst. ABC's Bill Redeker was there. It was a very private 
but very big funeral, restricted to family and friends. Dr. slepian 
had a lot of friends. Nearly 1,000 showed up, including some whose 
children he had delivered. This is what he was about, right here, 
children. This is what he should be remembered for, not abortions. 
But police today are convinced it was slepian's work as an abortion 
provider that cost him his life. And they are looking for a sniper 
motivated by anti-abortion beliefs, who fired a bullet from a high-powered 
rifle through the doctor's kitchen window last Friday night. Police 
also revealed that slepian's wife had received a fax earlier that 
day from the national abortion federation. That fax warned abortion 
providers of a four-year history of sniper attacks around this time 
of year. November 11th is the Canadian remembrance day holiday, renamed 
"remembering the unborn children day" by some anti-abortion activists. 
The fax warned "do not assume you are safe once you are at home" and 
urged providers to "talk to your local and federal law enforcement." 
Slepian's wife sent that warning to the Amherst police just hours 
before the shooting. We received the fax around 4:00 in the evening. 
We did not take action. Do you regret not taking the action? I regret 
the doctor is dead. The killing has also reignited the abortion debate 
here. Today, a Catholic priest defended this provocative mock cemetery 
marking hundreds of abortions performed in New York state this year. 
There are murders that are happening each and every day, and in this 
case, this display represents 440 in New York state. The killing of 
Dr. slepian has already had an impact on other abortion providers. 
Neither of the two doctors who practice the procedure in the area 
went to work today. Bill Redeker, ABC News, Amherst, New York.
