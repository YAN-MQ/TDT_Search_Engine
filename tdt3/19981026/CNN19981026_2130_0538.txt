This is meteorologist Valerie Voss with your "Headline News weather 
forecast" for Tuesday. A strong storm moving through the four corners 
region is producing some snow across the Colorado Rockies. Thunderstorms 
from Arizona into New Mexico and west Texas. Perhaps a few showers 
out into the central plains states. A cold front in the northwest 
will bring some rain showers to that region. The eastern half of the 
country though, quiet and actually rather warm. 60s to the Great Lakes, 
80s around the gulf coast. New England just 40s and 50s. We'll see 
mostly 50s and 60s in the west. Looking ahead to Wednesday, look for 
wet weather from the northwest into the plains and also in the northeast. 
Thursday, still rain showers northwest with mix of rain and snow over 
the north central United States. And on Friday, rain and thunderstorms 
will stretch from the northern plains into the central plains. Could 
be a few thunderstorms in southern Florida, rain showers in the northwest. 
Don't forget, four-day forecast, more than 7,200 cities on CNN interactive, 
at CNN.com.
