The FBI is offering a $100,000 reward for information leading to the 
arrest and conviction of the murderer of Dr. Barnett Slepian. Slepian 
was killed by a sniper's bullet as he stood in his kitchen in suburban 
Buffalo, New York last Friday. NPR's Anthony Brooks reports. Law enforcement 
officials say they're conducting ballistics tests on the sniper bullet 
that killed Barnett Slepian last Friday night. But officials would 
not reveal if they're pursuing a suspect or any promising leads. Slepian 
was one of a handful of doctors providing abortions in the Buffalo 
area and apparently the latest victim in a string of five attacks 
on abortion providers in the last four years across Canada and the 
U.S. Although the other four doctors survived, all were shot in their 
homes by a sniper and all provided abortions. U.S. law enforcement 
officials confirmed today that they've recently joined a Canadian 
Police task force to hunt for the killer. Meanwhile, family and friends 
attended the funeral of Dr. Slepian, who was eulogized today as someone 
who lived to love and loved to live. Anthony Brooks, NPR News, Buffalo.
