Lawyers representing former Chilean dictator Augusto Pinochet go before 
a London court today to try to have his arrest ruled invalid. They 
are expected to argue British authorities acted illegally when they 
recently arrested Mr. Pinochet in a London clinic at the request of 
a Spanish judge. British prime minister Tony Blair and his Spanish 
counterpart, Jose Maria Aznar, say the case is a judicial matter that 
the courts must decide.
