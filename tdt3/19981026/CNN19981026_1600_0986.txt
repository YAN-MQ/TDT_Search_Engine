The Dow industrials lost ground today, but our other major indexes 
were solid winners. Investors were hand add twist, as trading was 
halted on the New York stock exchange for nearly an hour due to equipment 
problems. In the end, the Dow Jones industrials closed with aless 
of 20 points at 8432. AT&T gained 7/16 after reporting a 6% jump in 
quarterly profits. Earnings at American express rose 10%, that stock 
added half a point. Union car bide lost 5 lrb/8. The NASDAQ surging 
31 points. E-bay an Internet auction company helped the NASDAQ, exploding 
for 23 points or 46%. The place to be is still on the stock market, 
we're 75% in the stock market, 20% in bonds and 5% in cash. I think 
fundamentally, you know, in a falling interest rate environment, and 
that's where we are, the federal reserve board is probably going to 
cut rates at least two more times this year, we look for global follow-up 
in germany, France, Italy, I think the bank of England will cut rates 
again. That's a great foundation for the stock market. The bond market 
sharply higher after an early drop, the benchmark 30-year treasury 
up more than a full point in price. The yield all the way down to 
5.10%.
