For decades, experts have been reminding everyone to stretch, in order 
to improve and maintain flexibility. For the first time, the American 
College of Sports Medicine has issued guidelines for flexibility training. 
The recommendations, recently published in the journal Medicine &AMP; 
Science in Sports &AMP; Exercise, seem relatively straightforward: 
Stretch at least twice a week, preferably after warming up, when the 
body temperature is elevated and muscles are more pliable; incorporate 
stretching exercises into an overall fitness plan; perform three or 
four stretches for each often-used muscle group, like the thighs, 
lower back and chest; and hold each stretching position for 10 to 
30 seconds. However, some stretching and flexibility experts take 
issue with this advice. Tom Beaumont, a senior exercise physiologist 
at the Sports Center at Chelsea Piers in New York, says the guidelines 
are too broad. ``They are safe for the general population,'' he said, 
``but may not be as effective for someone trying to attain a specific 
athletic goal, like maintaining good flexibility while training for 
marathon.'' Beaumont said that other stretching techniques, like one 
known as PNF (or proprioceptive neuromuscular facilitation) might 
lead to a greater degree of flexibility. Many personal trainers and 
physical therapists use that technique with their clients. This method 
involves tightening a muscle for six seconds followed by a 10- to 
30-second stretch assisted by another person or with the aid of a 
rope or towel. Jim Wharton, an exercise physiologist and co-author 
of ``The Whartons' Stretch Book'' (Random House, 1996), also finds 
the guidelines lacking. ``I'm disappointed,'' he said. Following the 
conventional techniques outlined by the sports college, an organization 
devoted to medicine and exercise science, may lead to muscle damage, 
Wharton said, if the muscles are pulled too hard, too far and for 
too long, causing them to tighten up and spring back upon themselves. 
This automatic defense mechanism, which prevents ripping and tearing, 
is known as the myotatic, or stretch, reflex. A better way to stretch, 
Wharton suggests, is with active isolated stretching, which has become 
popular in health clubs, especially group classes. This method calls 
for tightening the muscle opposite the muscle targeted for a stretch, 
then moving that muscle into a stretched position and holding it just 
long enough to elongate the muscle without triggering the myotatic 
reflex. For example, to stretch the hamstrings, tighten the quadriceps 
muscle first and then move into a hamstring stretch for only about 
two seconds. ``Muscles have equal and opposite reactions,'' Wharton 
explained. ``When you contract, or shorten one, the opposite one has 
no recourse but to relax and lengthen.'' Wharton is organizing a large 
study at the University of Florida in Gainesville that will compare 
several stretching techniques, including active isolated stretching 
and PNF. To make matters more confusing, some research makes a case 
for skipping flexibility work altogether. Studies conducted at the 
University of Hawaii and Guilford College in Greensboro, N.C., found 
that runners who did not stretch expended less energy and had fewer 
injuries than those who did. Another investigation, reported in Research 
Quarterly for Exercise and Sport, discovered that some exercisers 
actually experienced increased muscle soreness after stretching. Nevertheless, 
Dr. Katherine Schmitz, a research fellow at the University of Minnesota, 
said the American College of Sports Medicine took a positive step 
by issuing the guidelines. ``Though we have yet to prove it beyond 
a doubt, intuitively we know it's good to stretch,'' she said. ``These 
recommendations give people a safe, clear direction on how to do it.''
