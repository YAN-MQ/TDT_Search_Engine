Next time you rent a car, you will probably be offered the option 
to buy extra insurance coverage. Do you really need it? Lori Waffenschmidt 
has the answer in today's edition of "working ahead." You've reached 
your destination and found the car rental agency. The last thing you 
want is confusion over coverage. Do you need collision, liability 
or personalized insurance today? The hard sell may be difficult to 
fend off. The person behind the car rental counter is earning a commission 
every time they sell you an insurance policy. But why pay twice for 
coverage you already have? The fact is is that most people are covered 
by their personal auto insurance companies when renting a car. Most 
rental car companies offer optional loss or collision damage waivers. 
They're designed to protect the renter if a vehicle is damaged or 
stolen. The waivers are expensive, averaging $15 to $20 per day. Should 
you buy one? Your personal car insurance agent can answer that question 
before you leave home. You'll also need to ask about liability insurance. 
Renters are responsible for third-party injuries and damage. A waiver 
won't help you in this case. So rental car companies sell supplemental 
liability insurance. Some customers have told us that where that insurance 
is not available, they won't even rent a car. Liability runs about 
$10 a day, a cost that can quickly escalate, since each option adds 
to your base rental rate. Lori Waffenschmidt, CNN.
