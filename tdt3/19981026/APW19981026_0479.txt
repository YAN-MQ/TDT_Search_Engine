An Israeli security guard was shot in the neck and his dead body thrown 
from a moving car Monday in Hebron in an apparent attack by Palestinian 
militants. There was no immediate claim of responsibility for the 
slaying. Several Israelis have been killed in Hebron in the past by 
militants hoping to wreck Mideast peacemaking. The most recent such 
killing was in August, when a rabbi was slain by a member of the Islamic 
militant group Hamas. Israeli radio reporters cited Israeli security 
officials as saying the assailants apparently were Palestinian militants. 
Israel has been bracing for terror attacks in recent weeks, and especially 
since the signing of a new peace agreement between Israel and the 
Palestinians in Washington last week. Monday's killing occurred shortly 
after 2 p.m. in the downtown Shaaba neighborhood of Hebron, an area 
that is under Israeli control and about 400 yards (meters) from the 
Jewish settlement of Kiryat Arba. Several Palestinian journalists 
were walking along Wadi Abu Salim Street in the Shaaba neighborhood 
when they saw a car drive by at high speed. A car door opened and 
the body was dumped on the pavement, the reporters said. The victim, 
dressed in white shorts and a blue T-shirt, lay sprawled face down 
on the pavement. A puddle of blood spread below his head. The man 
wore a wedding band and the black strap of his sunglasses had Hebrew 
writing. He wore only one tennis shoe. The car drove away. Journalists 
said they notified Israeli and Palestinian police forces. Palestinian 
paramedics tried to revive the victim and then pronounced him dead. 
They said he had been shot in the neck. Israeli police told their 
Palestinian counterparts that the victim worked as a security guard 
at an electric station in the Israeli-controlled sector of Hebron 
and was a resident of Kiryat Arba. Israeli officers said the assailants 
escaped in the victim's car.
