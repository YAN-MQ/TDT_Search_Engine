In Brazilia, the presidents of Peru and Ecuador have signed an historic 
peace agreement settling a border dispute that has sparked armed conflict 
three times since the 1940s. From Lima, John Miller reports. President 
Jamil Mahuad of Ecuador and Peru's Alberto Fujimori declared the decade's 
old conflict officially over in a ceremony attended by five other 
Latin American presidents and the king of Spain. The agreement brokered 
by Argentina, Brazil, Chile, and the United States, sets the coordinates 
of the long-disputed 50-mile stretch of border in a remote jungle 
area. It also establishes demilitarized nature reserves on both sides 
of the border, gives Ecuador commercial access to the Amazon River, 
and creates a small Ecuadorian park within Peruvian territory. Reaction 
to the signing has been generally positive in both countries, although 
marches in opposition to the agreement are planned in Peru for later 
this week. Over the weekend, five people died in clashes with police 
in the Peruvian city of Iquitos. For NPR News, I'm John Miller in 
Lima.
