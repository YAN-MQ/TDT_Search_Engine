GAZA CITY, Gaza Strip (AP) - Israeli and Palestinian coast guards 
cocked their guns at one another in a tense two-hour stand off at 
sea over who controlled the Mediterranean off the Gaza coastline. 
The incident began after Palestinian forces, armed with Kalachnikov 
rifles boarded a rented yacht carrying an Israeli television crew 
filming a news documentary on an ship which sunk in the area 50 years 
ago. ``Palestinian soldiers showed up in four rubber boats and circled 
us,'' said Channel 2 news reporter Dov Gil-Har. ``At first I thought 
they were there to protect us, but very quickly they boarded our ship 
with Kalachnikovs and would not let us move,'' he said. Haim Assias, 
an Israeli cameraman, said the Palestinians told the group of 15 Israeli 
they would be escorted to the shore of Palestinian-controlled Gaza. 
The crew radioed the Israeli navy which told the group not to comply 
with the Palestinians. Shortly afterwards, four Israeli patrol boats 
showed up. Assias said patrolmen from both sides cocked their guns 
at one another during a tense two hour incident. ``It was not pleasant,'' 
Assias said. ``One soldier can make a mistake and it would be hell.'' 
The incident ended peacefully and the Israeli film crew completed 
the day's work. Under Israeli-Palestinian peace accords, Israel retains 
security of international borders and water-ways. A Palestinian official, 
who spoke on condition of anonymity, said his navy is allowed to patrol 
the first six miles of waters from the Gaza shore before Israel takes 
control and that the Israeli crew needed permission to film in the 
area. A spokeswoman for Channel 2 said that all necessary permits 
were obtained from the Palestinian and Israeli navies.
