Prime minister Benjamin Netanyahu sailed through a no-confidence vote 
today brought by ultranationalists opposed to the recently brokered 
mideast peace deal. The motion was defeated 8 to 21. Another Bill 
to dissolve Israel's parliament, the Knesset, is pending. It would 
call for new elections before the scheduled date in 2000. Meanwhile, 
an Israeli guard was shot to death today in the West Bank town of 
hebron by a suspected Palestinian. The body of a Palestinian man was 
found hours later in what appeared to be retribution for the Israeli 
guard's death. And some say even promises of aid from the United States 
is not likely to ease the tension. I don't believe the Israeli hard-liners 
are going to be bought off with any amount of aid, because their objection 
is a matter of principle to them. And so it has been done before that 
an aid package was made in order to pay for some of the sacrifices 
that were allegedly made. It is not a process that can continue indefinitely. 
About 300 Jewish settlers held a demonstration outside Netanyahu's 
residence in Jerusalem in protest of the interim land-for-peace deal 
with palestinians. A recent poll, however, shows 74% of Israelis support 
the agreement. Palestinians also protested the deal in the West Bank 
and in Gaza city. Palestinian authority President Yasser Arafat is 
visiting Arab countries to win support for the accord.
