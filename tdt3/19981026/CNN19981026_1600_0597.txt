Lawyers for former Chilean dictator augusto Pinochet are in London's 
high court today. They're trying to quash a Spanish warrant for the 
aging general's arrest. The government of Spain is trying to extradite 
Pinochet on charges of genocide and terrorism. Debate over the Pinochet's 
fate led to clashes in his native country over the weekend. Tom Mintier 
has more. The case of Chile's former dictator has moved into the courts, 
not in Spain, but in London. Far from the hospital bed where he's 
under police guard, the future of general augusto Pinochet is being 
decided here London's high court. Pinochet's lawyers are arguing he 
has diplomatic immunity and Spain has no right to try him for events 
that took place in Chile. The government of Chile, apparently confident 
of Pinochet's release, sent a Plane with doctors and medical equipment 
to Britain Sunday night. Two more Chilean senators have also arrived, 
both calling Britain's action of holding Pinochet illegal. Foreign 
hands have invaded our sovereignty, putting in great danger the stability 
of the country. And this is unacceptable. Here we have a senator, 
an ex-president who, against all judicial prerogatives as an ex-president, 
as senator, has been detained. When detentions are against the law, 
it's called kidnapping. During the weekend, the demonstrations against 
Pinochet outside the London clinic increased in both size and intensity. 
In an interview with CNN, the wife of general augusto Pinochet says 
her husband is not aware of the protesters outside his hospital but 
apparently is aware of his situation. He is under a lot of stress 
because of the situation and because of the psychological complications. 
He is losing a bit of touch with reality and that is very worrying. 
Meanwhile, several former Chilean prisoners now living in London, 
having started the process to have general Pinochet stand trial here 
for crimes he is alleged to have committed against them. If their 
cases are successful, the problem of extradition may be moot. Tom 
Mintier, CNN, London.
