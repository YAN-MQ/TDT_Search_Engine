I'm meteorologist Dave Hennen with your "Headline News weather." Warm 
day today along the gulf coast as highs return back to the 80s. It 
remains cool, though, in portions of the northeast. 40s and 50s for 
highs and some 50s are expected through the Rockies. Check your forecast 
weather maps. Later today on into Tuesday, low pressure continues 
to track through the southwest. Scattered showers and thunderstorms 
are expected. Look for high pressure to continue to produce fair weather 
over much of the southeast. On the bottom of your screen, dangerous 
hurricane Mitch continues to move through the Caribbean with winds 
upwards of 150 miles an hour. A look now at the extended forecast. 
On Wednesday, rain and mountain snows are expected. As we see, rain 
in portions of the northeast as well. Temperatures will be warm in 
the southeast and the gulf coast. Well into the 80s in some locations. 
Again, another warm day on Thursday in most of the east. But it's 
turning cooler in the west, especially over the northern Rockies where 
highs are forecast to be only in the 40s. And cooler air will be spreading 
eastward on Friday as rain and some thunderstorms affect portions 
of the midwest weather. For more weather information, you can log
