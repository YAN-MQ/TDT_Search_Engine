oil prices worldwide fall to 25-year-lows, but will the cheap prices 
hold? I'm Liz George at the business desk in New York. Consumers in 
the U.S. are enjoying some of the cheapest gasoline prices ever. According 
to a national survey of gas stations carried out by Lumberg, car drivers 
here are paying around $1.09 a gallon, even less at self-service pumps. 
Now that compares to around $3.65 in Europe and around $3.27 in Japan. 
These low prices are a side effect of the global economic crisis, 
as finances in Asia tighten demand for crude oil plummeted, leading 
to an oversupply. William Brown is an independent oil analyst. There's 
been no sustainable recovery in Asian oil demand as of yet. At the 
same time, OPEC decided at its meeting last November a year ago to 
raise the quotas, which was precisely the wrong thing to do at the 
wrong time. And as a result, there was too much supply chasing too 
little demand and prices came down quite significantly. And these 
low prices have led to increasing consumption here in the U.S. In 
fact, the last time we were using large amounts of energy was in 1973, 
when the government became concerned over the country's high reliance 
on oil imports. Today, America relies more than ever on overseas oil. 
Imports account for a record 50 percent of consumption. And although 
a rising share comes from secure neighbors like Mexico and Venezuela, 
about ten percent still comes from the Persian Gulf. So will prices 
remain low or will the producers cut supply and force costs up again? 
We have had two production cuts so far this year. We have a situation 
where there may be some members of OPEC who will be willing to cut 
production more, but it doesn't seem to be universal. So in terms 
of the oil price looking to the next few months, I think it's going 
to depend more on winter as opposed to any further action by OPEC. 
On the market, crude oil's trading slightly higher today ahead of 
an informal meeting of OPEC ministers in South Africa, although experts 
believe consumers will continue to enjoy cheap gasoline prices for 
a few months to come. I'm Liz George at the business desk in New York.
