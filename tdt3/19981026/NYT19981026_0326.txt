George Soros, one of the world's most famous investors, is making 
several changes at his Quantum Group of mutual funds after poor investment 
returns in the recent months of global financial turmoil, with some 
funds showing declines of more than 15 percent so far this year. One 
fund, which Soros is proposing to close, has lost more than 30 percent 
of its value this year. Taken together, the investment returns and 
Soros' response in recent days show that even one of the world's pre-eminent 
investors _ who has made billions of dollars out of inspired and well-informed 
speculation in world financial markets _ has taken something of a 
battering this year, not least because of the severe downturn in emerging 
markets. Earlier this year, the Soros Group said it had lost about 
$2 billion in Russia, which defaulted on its debts in August. In an 
Oct. 23 letter to shareholders in Quantum funds, Soros told investors 
that Nicholas Roditi, his star fund manager of recent years, would 
``take a temporary medical leave of absence,'' that Quantum proposes 
to merge two of its funds _ Quasar International and Quantum Industrial 
Holdings _ and that it would close Quantum Emerging Growth, which 
had lost 31.16 percent of its value as of last Thursday. The Soros 
funds, which are incorporated in Curacao, in the Netherlands Antilles, 
may be sold only to non-U.S. investors. But their performances are 
widely watched worldwide, not least because of Soros' reputation as 
a canny investor. They generally charge a management fee of 1 percent 
of assets and carry an incentive fee of 20 percent of profits earned. 
The minimum investment is generally hundreds of thousands of dollars. 
Stanley Druckenmiller, chief investment strategist for Soros Fund 
Management, the company that oversees Quantum Group, will temporarily 
take over Roditi's responsibilities for overseeing much of the management 
of the Quota and Quasar funds, Soros' letter said. Antoine Bernheim, 
the publisher of the U.S. Offshore Funds Directory, a listing of hedge 
funds, characterized the Soros funds' returns so far this year as 
``a recent disappointment'' against an ``outstanding longstanding 
record.'' That record owes much to Roditi, a London money manager 
who hails from southern Africa and who closely guards his privacy. 
Reached at his office in the north London borough of Hampstead last 
year, Roditi refused requests for interviews with the phrase ``I don't 
talk to journalists''; he routinely asks friends not to talk about 
him to the media. He suffered a life-threatening illness some years 
ago, described Monday as tuberculosis by friends who spoke on the 
condition of anonymity. ``He did not look well,'' one executive said 
Monday who saw Roditi last week when the Soros manager visited New 
York. ``We simply do not know how long his absence will be,'' Shawn 
Pattison, a spokesman for Soros Fund Management, said Monday in a 
written answer to questions about Roditi. ``It is Roditi's hope, as 
well as ours here at Soros Fund Management, that it will be of a short 
duration,'' he wrote. Pattison's note said Roditi ``has been Soros 
Fund Management's most trusted adviser.'' Pattison said Monday that 
Roditi would not answer journalists' questions. The Quota fund, which 
Roditi manages, has seen a 13.64 percent decline in its value as of 
last Thursday, according to Pattison. That decline reflects ``the 
recent market turmoil,'' Pattison said. Recent months aside, Quota 
has turned in high returns. In 1997, it earned 49.3 percent; in 1996, 
81.9 percent, and in 1995 it earned a staggering 159.4 percent. Speaking 
last year, Bernheim said that Quota ``has been the most successful 
hedge fund over the five years 1992 to 1996, with an annual compound 
return of 56.6 percent.'' Discussing Roditi's strategy then, he said: 
``He takes very large positions on his convictions. When it works, 
it produces spectacular returns.'' But this year has not been such 
a good one for many investors, including the Soros funds. Soros' flagship, 
the Quantum fund, was up 4.3 percent as of last Thursday and now has 
$8.7 billion under management, including deferred fees, Pattison said 
Monday. Last year it made 17.2 percent, in 1996 it was down 1.5 percent 
and in 1995 it earned 39 percent. Quantum Industrial Holdings, with 
assets of about $2 billion, saw a 19 percent fall in its value as 
of last Thursday, according to Soros Fund Management. That compares 
poorly with returns of 49.8 percent in 1995, 16.6 percent in 1996 
and 21.9 percent in 1997. The Quasar fund, meanwhile, has lost 18.8 
percent of its value this year, with assets of $969 million as of 
last Thursday. That compares with returns of 8 percent last year, 
8.5 percent in 1996 and 47.5 percent in 1995. This year's lackluster 
performance at Quantum Emerging Growth, which had $1.5 billion under 
management as of last week, contrasts starkly with the fund's high 
returns of 22.3 percent in 1997, 37.9 percent in 1996 and 21.6 percent 
in 1995. While the emerging markets have not been kind to Soros, some 
significant U.S. investments have not gone well, either. The Soros 
funds, for example, have invested in Waste Management Inc., the Houston 
waste company, which has performed poorly. Pattison declined to comment 
on that investment on Monday.
