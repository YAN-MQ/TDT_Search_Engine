Jamaica and the cayman islands were spared a direct hit by hurricane 
Mitch, but some parts of central America may not be so lucky. At last 
report, the storm was 115 miles northeast of the eastern Honduras 
coast. It's drifting west at eight miles per hour. Top sustained winds 
are up to 155 miles per hour, with even higher gusts. That makes Mitch 
the strongest hurricane this season. Hurricane warnings remain in 
effect for parts of Honduras. Forecasters recommend people in Belize, 
the Yucatan peninsula and Cuba remain on guard.
