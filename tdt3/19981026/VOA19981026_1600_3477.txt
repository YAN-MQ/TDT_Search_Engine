There's a persistent, strange and so far unconfirmed legend connected 
to the city of Medford, Oregon. Every now and then, someone calls 
the Southern Oregon Historical Society to ask about the story. It 
concerns a new car that supposedly was buried in downtown Medford 
nearly 50 years ago. The library manager of the historical society 
says she's heard several different versions of the legend, and she 
figures there must be something true about the story. In all the versions, 
the car was buried near Medford's downtown library around the year 
1950. One man says that when he was a teenager, he watched workers 
sealing a new Packard automobile, a brand that no longer exists today, 
by the way, in a crate. He says the workers told him the car would 
be buried and would be dug up with a time capsule in the year 2000. 
There's no record of any such project in Medford, Oregon. But the 
legend of the buried car lives on. That's my kind of story. I'd like 
to find a new Packard buried somewhere.
