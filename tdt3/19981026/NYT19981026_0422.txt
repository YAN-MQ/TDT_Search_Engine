In a milestone decision, a jury in Richmond, Va., ordered Nationwide 
Insurance Co. on Monday to pay $100.5 million in damages to a local 
housing group that accused the insurer of refusing to sell homeowner 
policies to black residents. It was the first of many complaints brought 
by housing groups against the insurer to go to trial, and the award 
of $100 million in punitive damages along with $500,000 in compensatory 
damages was nearly seven times as great as any payments agreed to 
in cases that were settled before trial. Although the verdict was 
rendered in a state court, it could influence insurance sales around 
the United States. ``Today's verdict is good news not just for minorities,'' 
said Andrew Cuomo, the secretary of the Department of Housing and 
Urban Development, which provided $1.5 million for research on discrimination, 
which led to the verdict. Nationwide, one of the nation's largest 
providers of homeowners' insurance, said it would appeal the verdict 
to the Virginia Supreme Court. During the summer, Nationwide turned 
down an offer to settle the case for $20 million, according to Constance 
Chamberlin, the executive director of the Richmond group that brought 
the suit, Housing Opportunities Made Equal. ``They countered with 
$265,000 including lawyers' fees,'' Ms. Chamberlin said. ``We then 
offered to take $17.5 million and they never responded.'' John Millen, 
a spokesman for Nationwide, confirmed that a settlement had been discussed, 
but would not elaborate. During the two-week trial, Judge Randall 
Johnson of the Richmond Circuit Court urged the two sides several 
times to settle, Ms. Chamberlin said. Ms. Chamberlin's group spent 
a week before a jury of six blacks and one white woman explaining 
how it had telephoned Nationwide agents in Richmond, which is 55 percent 
black, with requests for coverage for a house they said was about 
to be bought, saying alternatively that it was in a white neighborhood 
and then in a black one. Getting coverage, Ms. Chamberlin said, ``was 
a problem in the case of the black areas but never in the white ones.'' 
``They didn't refuse all the time to write policies in Afro-American 
neighborhoods,'' she said, ``but they tried to avoid doing business 
in those neighborhoods. And if you succeeded in getting a Nationwide 
policy, you would pay more than your white counterparts and you would 
be very likely to get an inferior policy.'' Millen said the group 
was inconsistent in its calls to agents and this led to ``a preconceived 
conclusion that the company was discriminating.'' He said Ms. Chamberlin's 
group ``swayed the jury with a highly emotionally charged argument 
which we believe had no place in a court of law.'' Ms. Chamberlin 
said her group had been faced ``with a major case of institutional 
racism.'' She added, ``You've got to talk about what you see.'' ``Essentially 
our attorneys pointed out all of Nationwide's policies and practices 
and the impact they had on African-American neighborhoods,'' she said. 
``We showed that Nationwide relied upon race, in its own documents, 
as a basis for choosing where to do business.'' Quoting from a Nationwide 
document, the group's lawyers told the jury that agents had been instructed 
to avoid ``black urbanite households with many children,'' Ms. Chamberlin 
said. Larry Mayewski, a senior analyst at A.M. Best &AMP; Co., the 
insurance rating agency, said the $100.5 million verdict would not 
have much financial impact on a company with property casualty assets 
of $25 billion and revenue of $8.5 billion last year, mainly from 
homeowner and auto insurance policies. But the damage to reputation, 
he said, could ``go beyond the purely hard-dollar costs.'' Industry 
specialists said the largest previous payment for charges of racial 
discrimination in homeowners' coverage was a settlement of $14.5 million 
made by American Family Mutual Insurance Co. in Milwaukee three years 
ago. In April, Nationwide settled a suit for $5.3 million in Toledo, 
Ohio, that was based on charges similar to those in Richmond. Millen 
said the company decided not to settle with the Richmond group, because 
``we felt there was very little evidence supporting their claims.''
