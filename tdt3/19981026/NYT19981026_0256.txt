With the countdown clock running and all preparations on schedule 
here, the seven astronauts of the space shuttle Discovery, including 
Sen. John Glenn, flew in on Monday from Houston to get ready for their 
nine-day mission, set to begin at 2 p.m. on Thursday. At a brief welcoming 
ceremony at the Kennedy Space Center landing strip, Glenn stepped 
down from a T-38 jet and told reporters, ``I have been pleasantly 
surprised at the outpouring of interest in this flight.'' He said 
he hoped it would lead to a renewal of widespread public support for 
space exploration. At age 77, Glenn is returning to space for the 
first time since his historic flight in 1962, when he became a national 
hero as the first American to orbit Earth. He has been a Democratic 
senator from Ohio for the last 24 years, but he is retiring in January. 
Because of his presence on the flight, more than 3,000 media representatives 
have applied for credentials to cover a shuttle mission that otherwise 
would have drawn a few hundred reporters and television technicians. 
The Discovery crew was an hour late in arriving because one of its 
two-seat T-38 training planes developed battery trouble at a refueling 
stop at Tyndall Air Force Base, near Panama City, Fla. Glenn still 
flies his own small private plane, but this time he rode in the back 
seat of a T-38, with Lt. Col. Curtis Brown of the Air Force at the 
controls. Brown is the mission commander. The other astronauts, usually 
overlooked outside the Glenn limelight, are Lt. Col. Steven Lindsey 
of the Air Force, the pilot; Stephen Robinson, a mechanical engineer; 
Pedro Dugue, an astronaut-engineer, and Dr. Scott Parazynski and Dr. 
Chiaki Mukai. Parazynski and Mukai are physicians and will be conducting 
many of the mission's biology and human physiology tests, in several 
cases using Glenn as a test subject. Officials at the Kennedy center 
said the countdown for the launching began at 8 a.m. on Monday and 
was proceeding smoothly. ``All is in great shape and we're right on 
schedule,'' said Doug Lyons, the test director. But meteorologists 
gave the launching teams some cause for concern, forecasting some 
clouds and rain on Thursday afternoon. They predicted a 60 percent 
chance of acceptable weather for the launching.
