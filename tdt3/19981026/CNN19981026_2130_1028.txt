A new poll indicates most Americans apparently think insurance companies 
and even federal health plans should cover the cost of impotence drugs 
such as Viagra. The Louis Harris poll of more than 1,000 men and women 
finds about 80% of those surveyed say the cost of the drug should 
be covered when sexual dysfunction is caused by certain medical conditions 
like spinal cord injury or prostate cancer.
