Western diplomats in Guinea-Bissau on Monday prepared the agenda for 
the first face-to-face talks between the President of the West African 
nation, and the leader of the breakaway military faction seeking to 
oust him. The ambassadors of Portugal, France and Sweden met with 
government and rebel representatives to set the framework for Tuesday's 
scheduled meeting between President Joao Bernardo Vieira and Brig. 
Ansumane Mane, a Portuguese Foreign Ministry spokesman said. The foes 
were respecting a truce ahead of the planned talks, spokesman Horacio 
Cesar said. No further details were available of what aspects the 
ambassadors were discussing. Mane led a military rebellion June 7, 
a day after Vieira dismissed him as Armed Forces chief-of-staff on 
allegations that he was running arms to separatists in Senegal's southern 
Casamance province. The rebels claimed Vieira was corrupt and called 
for early elections, which had been scheduled for later this year. 
Senegal has deployed some 3,000 heavily-armed troops in the neighboring 
country to aid Vieira, but the insurgents _ mostly army veterans angered 
by poor pay and conditions _ have overrun most of the country. ``The 
rebels clearly have the upper-hand,'' Cesar said. The fighting has 
prompted a humanitarian crisis in the former Portuguese colony. About 
half the population of 1 million have fled their homes and urgently 
require food and medical assistance, aid workers say. The World Food 
Program said Monday it planned to distribute 300 tons of emergency 
food aid this week to about 80,000 displaced people in Prabis and 
Cumura, small towns near the coastal capital Bissau. WFP spokesman 
Wagdi Othman said by phone from Abidjan, Ivory Coast, that the displaced 
people are living in makeshift camps with no food or drinking water.
