Israeli prime minister Benjamin Netanyahu has easily survived a no-confidence 
motion introduced by opponents of the interim peace accord he signed 
with the Palestinians in Washington on Friday. Earlier today on American 
television, Mr. Netanyahu talked about the importance of his actions 
and the need to live with the consequences. I've put myself at considerable 
political risk as you, yourself, know. I may very well -- the government 
may or may not fall. I don't think it will. I think it will -- I think 
cooler heads will prevail, and you need to use your head, not only 
your heart. You need both. A majority of the legislators did not even 
show up for the vote. The motion was brought by the ultranationalist 
Moldet Party, which opposes giving up any West Bank land.
