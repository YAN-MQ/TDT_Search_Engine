You can see Jane pauley's interview with Dominique Moceanu tonight 
on "Dateline," at 10:00, :00 central. I'll be right back with "living 
longer, living better." And a very simple way to help put the brakes 
on aging. When they said the world didn't need another nose strip 
we said, "oh, yeah?" How about making one that's contoured, for a 
good fit giving it a centering bump so you know where to place it 
and using a skin-friendly adhesive? Introducing ClearPassage an ergonomically 
advanced nose strip designed to relieve the symptoms of nasal congestion. 
Oh, and one last thing-- how about having it made by the maker of 
Afrin nasal spray the people who know more about the nose than anyone? 
New ClearPassage.
