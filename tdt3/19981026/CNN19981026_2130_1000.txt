The treasury department is saying banks must do more to protect their 
customers' privacy. The department says even though some banks are 
protecting confidential information, many are not. Some financial 
services release customer information to other agencies. Although 
there are laws to prevent this, the treasury department says often 
they don't work. It encourages banks to adopt their own voluntary 
guidelines to ensure customer information isn't given out without 
permission.
