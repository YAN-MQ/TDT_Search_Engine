Two miners were killed in Ukraine's crumbling coal mines over the 
weekend, bringing to at least 305 the number of coal industry workers 
who have died on the job so far this year, officials said Monday. 
One miner died at the Stashkova mine in the southeastern Dnipropetrovsk 
region due to an unspecified violation of safety rules, the Emergency 
Situations Ministry reported. Another miner was killed by falling 
pieces of rock at the Komsomolets Donbasa mine in eastern Donetsk 
region. Work and safety conditions at the former Soviet republic's 
coal mines have deteriorated in recent years as the cash-strapped 
government has failed to provide sufficient funds to support the largely 
unreformed industry. With practically no money allocated for modernizing 
equipment and improving safety conditions at the underground coal 
shafts, the number of Ukrainian miners killed on the job has been 
steadily rising.
