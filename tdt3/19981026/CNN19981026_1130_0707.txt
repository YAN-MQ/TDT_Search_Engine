Dizziness, pale skin and nausea. If you experienced these systems 
while traveling, it probably means you're prone to motion sickness. 
And whether you're on vacation, traveling on business or just out 
for some weekend fun, it can really be a nuisance. But motion sickness 
can be prevented. In a car, sit in the front seat and look ahead. 
On a plane, choose a seat over the wing. And on a boat, try to remain 
on deck rather than below. Look at the horizon or close your eyes. 
And try not to focus on fast-moving scenery or waves. Overindulgence 
in food and drink can predispose you to nausea and other symptoms, 
so can the odor of food or tobacco. There are nonprescription drugs 
to prevent motion sickness, but they can cause drowsiness, so make 
sure if you take them you're not going to be behind the wheel. Check 
out CNN.com/health for the latest health news online. For "your health," 
Kristy Lawson, "Headline News."
