I'm Pat Bodnar, VOA News. A White House official said Monday NATO 
is looking for evidence that Serbian special police units are being 
withdrawn from Kosovo in compliance with NATO demands that it withdraw 
forces from Kosovo. The official charge that the intimidating presence 
of the special police is keeping an estimated 35,000 refugees from 
returning to their homes. However, diplomatic observers in Kosovo 
say Serbian military police are withdrawing from their positions.
