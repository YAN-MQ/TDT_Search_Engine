Allstate insurance has reached a settlement to give policyholders 
a chance to have their claims re-examined following the Northridge 
California earthquake five years ago. According to published reports, 
the agreement would settle two lawsuits filed against Allstate that 
allege that adjusters claimed damage was unrelated to the earthquake. 
Homeowners who feel their claims were fraudulently drafted will be 
able to request an independent investigation at Allstate's expense. 
Allstate insurance has set aside $60 million for possible additional 
claims.
