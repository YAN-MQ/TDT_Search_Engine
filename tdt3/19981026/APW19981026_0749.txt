Three crew members aboard a Czech military helicopter were killed 
when it crashed into the hillside above a remote field, Czech military 
officials said Monday. No rescue teams were immediately able to reach 
the crash site, believed to be in a mined field, but the Czech Defense 
Ministry in Prague confirmed late Monday that all three men aboard 
the Czech Mi-17 ``Hip'' helicopter died in the crash. The chopper 
disappeared late Sunday while on a routine transport flight from Gornji 
Vakuf in the northwest of Bosnia to the Croatian port of Split. British 
helicopters spotted the helicopter Monday, crashed into a hillside 
near Tomislavgrad, 105 kilometers (65 miles) southwest of Sarajevo, 
said Maj. Glenn Chamberlain, a NATO spokesman in Sarajevo. Chamberlain 
said it was still too early to say what caused the crash. Local officials 
said heavy rainstorm was raging in the area, at the time of the crash. 
The helicopter and its crew were based out of northwestern town of 
Velika Kladusa, as part of the Czech Battalion which belongs to the 
36,000 strong multinational peacekeepers. Since NATO deployed it's 
multinational peace force in Bosnia three years ago, 86 participants 
have died while on duty in non-combat accidents _ mostly traffic accidents 
or land-mine blasts.
