Hurricane Mitch continues to make its way slowly through the western 
Caribbean after lashing Jamaica, the Cayman Islands and Nicaragua 
with heavy rains. Forecasters say the storm's 250 kilometer per hour 
winds make Mitch far more powerful than Hurricane Georges, which killed 
more than 500 people last month. James Lewis Free of the National 
Hurricane Center says Mitch is a very powerful storm. Mitch is forecasted 
to become the most intense hurricane that we've seen in the Atlantic 
basin going back to at least 1989, and it could even be forecasted 
to become one of the strongest ones in many, many years -- possibly 
one of the strongest in quite a few decades. The forecasters so far 
are not able to predict exactly where the slow-moving hurricane will 
finally hit landfall. At 1500 Universal Time, the huge storm was nearly 
200 kilometers northeast of the Honduras coast and was moving westward, 
rather, at 13 kilometers per hour. You're listening to VOA News. I'm
