Switzerland has requested the extradition of former Chilean dictator 
Augusto Pinochet, who's being held in Britain on a similar request 
from a Spanish judge. The move follows a complaint by the widow of 
Alexis Jacqard, a student who disappeared after being arrested in 
1977 in Argentina. The family suspects General Pinochet's secret police 
were behind the arrest.
