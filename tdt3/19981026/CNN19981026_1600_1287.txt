Jerome Jurenovich, "CNN Headline Sports." Mike Piazza never had to 
test free agency. After being traded twice in one week this past season, 
the Mets made him an offer he couldn't refuse to keep him in New York 
-- a $91 million deal that made the all-star catcher the highest paid 
player in baseball. It wasn't a situation where I felt that desire 
to get out there and really, you know, travel around and get wined 
and dined. I knew it was a matter of staying here and feeling like 
that I had unfinished business here and, and again, like I said very 
much just, just continuing to go forward and build and hopefully being 
on the next Mets world championship team. The Mets apparently aren't 
done yet. New York is also close to shelling out another $32 million 
to lock up lefty al leiter for four more years.
