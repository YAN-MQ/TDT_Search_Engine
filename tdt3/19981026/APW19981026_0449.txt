BRUSSELS, Belgium (AP) _ NATO has given Yugoslav leader Slobodan Milosevic 
24 hours to reduce his forces in Kosovo to pre-crisis levels or face 
airstrikes, officials said. Early Monday, the Serb leader started 
moving in the right direction. ``He knows the direction he has to 
move in if he wants to avert airstrikes,'' said a NATO officials after 
the 16 ambassadors were briefed on 16 hours of weekend talks between 
Milosevic and the two top Alliance generals. British Foreign Secretary 
Robin Cook said in Luxembourg said that if Milosevic sticks to the 
deal ``that will certainly be a significant advance, but we want to 
see the evidence first.'' Intelligence reports on Monday showed that 
``there is some indication some units are regrouping for withdrawal,'' 
said the NATO official. He said NATO remained resolved to use military 
force once a deadline on withdrawal runs out at 8 p.m. (1900 GMT) 
Tuesday. ``He has to get his skates on for the next 24 hours,'' the 
officials said. Milosevic ``agreed in very detailed terms to the withdrawals'' 
during talks with NATO Generals Wesley Clark of the United States 
and German General Klaus Naumann. The generals were in Belgrade over 
the weekend to reinforce a strong letter from NATO Secretary-General 
Javier Solana, stressing the Alliance would not hesitate to use military 
action if necessary. ``The planes are still on the runway. If Milosevic 
does not want them to take off then it is up to him to comply, he 
knows what he has got to do,'' said Cook ahead of a meeting of EU 
Foreign Ministers. NATO will assess the level of withdrawal Tuesday 
afternoon before a NATO Council will meet just hours before the deadline 
expires.
