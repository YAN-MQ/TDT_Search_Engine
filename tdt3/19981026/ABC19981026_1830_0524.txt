In Moscow today, the Russian president, Boris Yeltsin, was told by 
his doctors that he needs another two weeks off. And he has to cancel 
his trip to a European summit scheduled for tomorrow. It is no joke 
when a man this powerful is as sick as he is. ABC's Hilary brown reports 
from Moscow. This is what the world has seen of the president of Russia 
lately -- Walking across a room to greet a group of generals, reviewing 
a color guard during an official visit to central Asia, attempting 
to write his own name on a state document. The Kremlin says, that 
apart from a bad cold, he's fine. I see Mr. Yeltsin a lot. I judge 
by the way he looks. By the way he talks, how he communicates with 
me. Everything is normal. But according to people who know Boris Yeltsin 
well, things are not normal. A former cabinet minister told ABC News 
that Yeltsin is unable to work for more than three hours at a stretch. 
His former press officer says, Yeltsin has appeared at his Kremlin 
office only 17 times in the last three months. He hasn't chaired a 
meeting for months because he doesn't make sense anymore. "He is simply 
unable to function," he says, "I'm not a doctor, but I think there's 
something wrong with his brain." This week Yeltsin was pictured on 
the cover of Russia's leading news magazine. In a jar of formaldehyde. 
The caption read -- "can this man be preserved till the year 2000?" 
That is when the next presidential election is scheduled. Yet, Boris 
Yeltsin is still the most powerful man in Russia. He can still dismiss 
a government, dispatch an army and has control of the world's second 
largest nuclear arsenal. That is what worries everyone, inside and 
outside the country. Hillary brown, ABC News, Moscow.
