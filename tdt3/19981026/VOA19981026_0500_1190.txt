In U.S. Major League Soccer, the Chicago Fire blazed a victory over 
the two-time champion, the Washington, D.C. United on Sunday in a 
2-0 victory at the Rose Bowl in California. VOA's Mike O'Sullivan 
has more. The Chicago Fire has defeated two-time MLS champion D.C. 
United by a score of 2-0. Chicago scored both goals in the first half 
of the game. The first was by forward Jerzy Podbrozny with assists 
from Ante Razov and Peter Nowak. The second was by midfielder Diego 
Gutierrez, again with an assist from Nowak. The Chicago win ends talk 
of a D.C. United dynasty in U.S. soccer and brings another championship 
cup to Chicago, a city known for its winning sports teams. But at 
the beginning of this season, no one could have predicted that the 
Chicago Fire, an expansion team, would cap its first year in professional 
soccer with the MLS cup. Reporting from the Pasadena Rose Bowl, I'm 
Mike O'Sullivan, VOA Sports.
