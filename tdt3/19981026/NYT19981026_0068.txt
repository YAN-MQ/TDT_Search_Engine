This is a tale of two news conferences on the same day last week concerning 
the same organization, the United Nations Population Fund. At one, 
in Washington, Rep. Carolyn Maloney, D-N.Y., complained that the House 
Republican leadership had erased the Clinton administration's $20 
million budget request for the fund. To the two television news crews 
and the few reporters who bothered to attend, it was just another 
briefing. The other news conference, 200 miles away at U.N. headquarters 
in New York City, played to a standing-room-only audience that will 
not soon forget the scene. The main attraction was someone not known 
for making policy pronouncements: Geri Halliwell, revered by screaming 
teen-age fans as Ginger Spice. She had walked away from the hugely 
popular singing group, the Spice Girls, several months ago. The population 
fund hit the publicity jackpot by naming her a ``goodwill ambassador,'' 
for two television news services beamed the news conference around 
the world live. In the television-oriented 1990s, policy wonks are 
using celebrities to get their messages across. Maybe it is inevitable 
that groups like the population fund, which provides contraception 
and counseling, would turn to entertainers and athletes to reach a 
wider audience than do the policy-makers who inhabit Sunday-morning 
interview shows. At the United Nations, Secretary-General Kofi Annan 
has his own ``messengers for peace'' _ Magic Johnson, Muhammad Ali, 
Elie Wiesel and Michael Douglas, who said last summer that ``this 
probably means as much to me as any of the two Oscars that I got.'' 
Assistant Secretary-General Gillian Sorenson said the idea was to 
keep from ``preaching to the converted.'' ``This gets us new audiences, 
including especially young people,'' she said. Ms. Halliwell joined 
a roster that includes the media-and-sports tycoon Ted Turner and 
his wife, the actress Jane Fonda; the Japanese actress Keiko Kishi, 
and the Finnish rock star Mikko Kuustonen. Yes, Mikko Kuustonen. ``You've 
never heard of him,'' said Corrie Shanahan, a spokeswoman for the 
population fund, ``but he's huge in Finland, huge. We look at donor 
countries where we want to raise awareness and we choose someone who's 
big and popular and has the right image.'' ``The right image,'' she 
added, ``is someone who's passionate and sincere about why they care 
about this.'' But who may not talk in diplomatic language. Consider 
Ms. Halliwell. ``I am famous,'' she said. ``And I am damn well going 
to use my fame positively. If I save one person's life just by awareness, 
I'm going to damn well do it.'' Isn't the United Nations the kind 
of place where never is heard a provocative word? ``She's not in the 
U.N.,'' Ms. Shanahan said. ``This is why we have ambassadors. Geri 
Halliwell can reach and influence young women in a way we can't, we 
being the people behind the desks here. We don't have their attention, 
and that's it: She has their attention.'' But the U.N. bureaucracy 
may have found her less than mesmerizing. The news service Agence 
France-Presse quoted one official it did not identify as saying that 
Ms. Halliwell was ``not up to'' the job of promoting family planning 
issues. The idea of using celebrities to promote causes is hardly 
new. ``Unicef started it,'' said Ms. Shanahan. A generation after 
Danny Kaye promoted the U.N. Children's Fund, Diana, Princess of Wales, 
made land mines a post-divorce crusade. And Linda McCartney, who became 
famous because she married a famous man, tackled animal rights. Now 
Jay Leno's wife is following suit. Last week Mavis Leno announced 
a $100,000 donation to the Feminist Majority Foundation, a nonprofit 
group trying to rally opposition to what it calls the Taliban's ``inhumane 
oppression of women'' in Afghanistan. ``What can I tell you? You probably 
know more than I do,'' Mrs. Leno said in a conversation last week. 
``What I'm bringing to the issue is the visibility bestowed on me 
by the fact that I'm married to Jay.'' Last week was also a busy one 
for the four singers who have carried on as Spice Girls since Ms. 
Halliwell abandoned them. They sent a letter to President Nelson Mandela 
of South Africa that was publicized by an animal-rights group, People 
for Ethical Treatment of Animals. They asked Mandela to rescue 30 
baby elephants they said had been ``ripped from their families in 
Botswana and taken to a warehouse near Pretoria.'' Animal-rights advocates 
say the elephants have been beaten and starved to become ``zoo friendly.'' 
All of which left Ms. Maloney's press secretary, Terese Schlachter, 
sighing. ``Maybe,'' she said, talking of how to increase attendance 
at her boss' next news conference, ``we should make her Congressional 
Spice.''
