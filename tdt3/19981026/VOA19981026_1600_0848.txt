The UN Development Program, the UNDP, released a new report Monday 
saying Somalia ranks among the poorest and most underdeveloped countries 
in the world. The report includes statistics on life expectancy, health 
and literacy rates. Sonya Laurence Green has details from our East 
African bureau. The UNDP has just released its first-ever human development 
report for Somalia, and it serves up some sobering statistics on what 
life is like for the average Somali citizen. Life expectancy for Somali 
adults is only about 43 years. And child mortality rates are very 
high. One quarter of all children die before they reach their fifth 
birthday. There are few health centers, and many Somalis live in abject 
poverty. The report also says the level of education is quite low. 
Only one in six people can read and write, and only 13 percent to 
16 percent of children are enrolled in primary school, which means 
literacy rates will remain low for years to come. The report says 
these figures show that Somali society is mired in a long-term emergency. 
It says that the current political crisis and low level of human development 
created a vicious cycle from which Somalia needs to escape. The international 
community has all but abandoned Somalia to its vicious clan wars after 
a UN intervention earlier this decade ended in disaster. Most aid 
agencies pulled out their expatriate staff and scaled back on programs 
as a result of constant attacks, looting and kidnappings by armed 
Somali gunmen. Analysts say the real losers in Somalia are the women 
and children. With no political voice, no weapons, few resources to 
call their own, they are the first to suffer when fighting erupts, 
food is stolen or they are forced to flee their homes. The UNDP said 
it hopes this new report on Somalia will now draw attention to the 
dire situation there and spark debate among all those who can do something 
to help. Sonya Laurence Green for VOA News, East Africa Bureau.
