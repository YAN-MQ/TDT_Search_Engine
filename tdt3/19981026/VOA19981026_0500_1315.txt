The top eight U.S. college football teams have retained their rankings 
in the latest poll of coaches that was released Sunday. The Ohio State 
Buckeyes are number one for the ninth straight week after defeating 
Northwestern on Saturday 36-10. But second-ranked UCLA is closing 
the gap by gaining votes after beating California 28-16. Number three 
Kansas State pounded Iowa State 52-7. Tennessee holds on to the number 
four ranking, following a 35-18 win over Alabama. Florida was idle 
but stays at number five. Florida State is steady at number six, followed 
by Nebraska and Wisconsin. Texas A&M jumped into the ninth spot. While 
idle Penn State slipped to number 10. That's sports. I'm Jim Stevenson.
