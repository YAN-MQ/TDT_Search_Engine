With just over a month to go in the hurricane season, the latest storm, 
hurricane Mitch has become the most powerful storm of the season. 
Mitch has swept past Jamaica and the cayman islands and now, a category 
5 with winds of 170 miles an hour, is bearing down on the Yucatan 
peninsula and the central American nation of Honduras.
