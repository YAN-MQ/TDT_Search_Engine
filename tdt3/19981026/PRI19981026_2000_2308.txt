We travel to the land hailed as the birthplace of Canada for today's 
geography puzzler. It was on this island province in East Canada that 
the decision was made in 1867 to unite the country. Literary aficionados 
may know of this place as the setting for the novel, "Anne of Green 
Gables" written after the turn of the century. And it's through this 
book that the islands become a veritable pilgrimage site for Japanese 
tourists, many of whom read "Anne of Green Gables" in grade school. 
This spot's also known as the site of what Canadians claim to be the 
longest span bridge in the world, stretching eight miles long. But 
this grand structure has cost many the local residents to go through 
an identity crisis. Ever since the opening of the Confederation Bridge, 
islanders have bemoaned the new concrete connection to the main continent. 
So where are we? We'll draw the bridge on the answer in just a few 
minutes.
