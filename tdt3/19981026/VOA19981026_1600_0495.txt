Russian president Boris Yeltsin has canceled his already shortened 
visit to Vienna because his doctors say he is not fit to travel. As 
VOA's Ron Pemstein reports from Vienna, Russian officials still are 
planning talks Tuesday in the Austrian capital with the European Union. 
This was intended to be a two-day visit, split between the European 
Union and a state visit to Austria. President Yeltsin first shortened 
the trip to seven hours and, at the last minute, his doctors ordered 
him to stay home. President Yeltsin's place at talks with the European 
Union here will be taken by Prime Minister Yevgeny Primakov. He will 
meet with Austrian chancellor Viktor Klima, who was president of the 
European Union for six months, and European Commission president Jacques 
Santer. When Mr. Santer was in Moscow a few weeks ago, he met with 
Prime Minister Primakov. At that time, the Russians broached the issue 
of the European Union providing food aid to help Russia recover from 
a disastrous harvest. The European Union is considering funding more 
than $1 billion worth of food aid to Russia but wants a more authoritative 
request. Mr. Santer, speaking through an interpreter last week, says 
he has other questions to Russia about economic policy. JACQUES SANTER, 
EUROPEAN COMMISSION PRESIDENT sector what do the Russians intend to 
do, stabilization of the ruble and trade in general. The European 
Union has ruled out additional economic support for Russia until Prime 
Minister Primakov presents his program. European leaders just finished 
a meeting in southern Austria, where they discussed measures to deal 
with the global financial crisis, including their central banks to 
lower interest rates. The Austrians had been eager for the visit by 
President Yeltsin, insisting it would still go ahead when the trip 
was shortened to seven hours. President Yeltsin had given an interview 
with a Vienna newspaper last week in which he says there are no problems 
between Russia and neutral Austria. Ron Pemstein, VOA News, Vienna.
