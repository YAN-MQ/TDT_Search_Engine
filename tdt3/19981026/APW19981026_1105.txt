A month after state elections, leftist Social Democrats and ex-communist 
politicians in Mecklenburg-Western Pommerania returned to negotiations 
Monday evening to form a government. Both sides say they hope to finalize 
an agreement on finances, and a works and social benefits program 
to form the first government at German state level that would include 
the ex-communists as full-fledged coalition partners. The Social Democrats 
finished on top in state elections in Mecklenburg-Western Pomerania 
on Sept. 27, but must form a coalition to achieve a majority in parliament. 
The Party of Democratic Socialism finished a strong third. Governor-elect 
Harald Ringstorff has been pushing to come to agreement on a coalition 
with the PDS, the successor to former East Germany's old party of 
Social Unity. The Social Democrats have governed in another eastern 
German state, Saxony-Anhalt, since spring with the tacit support of 
the PDS, but the party has never officially been part of a coalition 
government. Social Democratic leaders have ruled out working with 
the PDS at the federal level, but have said that having the ex-communists 
shoulder responsibility at the state level may prove beneficial in 
the eastern states.
