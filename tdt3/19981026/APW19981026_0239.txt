Two months after a highly criticized foray into the stock and futures 
markets, Hong Kong's investment company disclosed Monday that the 
government spent U.S. dlrs 15.1 billion in its unprecedented buying 
spree. The government bought shares in all 33 stocks that make up 
the the blue chip Hang Seng Index, officials said after the market 
had closed Monday. The government now holds more than 10 percent of 
issued shares of three big companies _ the property conglomerates 
Cheung Kong Holdings and New World Development, and the aviation-to-insurance 
holding company Swire Pacific A. After coming under sharp attack from 
critics who warned that the intervention could ruin Hong Kong's status 
as a free-wheeling market, Hong Kong officials promised to be more 
open in the future. Any changes in share holdings of 1 percent or 
more will be disclosed, said Ti-Liang Yang, chairman of the Exchange 
Fund Investment Ltd., which was set up to manage the government's 
stock holdings. In a two-week period in August, the government snapped 
up the shares in an effort to drive what it called ``market manipulators'' 
out of the stock, futures and currency markets. Hong Kong officials 
contended that big investors were selling the Hong Kong dollar, which 
forced monetary authorities to raise interest rates to preserve the 
currency's fixed link with the U.S. dollar. At the same time, the 
speculators were selling shares on the Hong Kong stock market, then 
cashing in when the higher interest rates helped to push shares lower. 
The intervention was met with sharp criticism from analysts who said 
Hong Kong could be driving away long-term investors by going against 
its free market traditions. Politicians also criticized the government 
for spending its reserves without consulting the legislature. The 
government later introduced a series of regulations to restrict speculative 
activity and stabilize the markets. Officials had not previously disclosed 
the holdings because existing regulations on disclosure do not apply 
to the government. They also said any premature disclosure could wreak 
further havoc in the markets and that they would disclose the details 
only after speculators had left the Hong Kong markets.
