Another round of corporate earnings reports released today. AT&T announcing 
a 68% jump in third-quarter profits, easily beating Wall Street's 
expectations. The company says growth in its wireless, international 
and business units offset a decline in its core consumer business. 
But another Dow component, union carbide, reporting a gloomier forecast. 
Profits there fell 58% in the third quarter. Union carbide says weakness 
in Asia especially hurt results. Despite the downturn, the company 
managed to beat analysts' expectations.
