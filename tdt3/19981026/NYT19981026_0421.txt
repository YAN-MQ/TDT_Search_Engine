After years of contentious contract negotiations, Bernie Williams 
took a possible first step away from the Yankees Monday, becoming 
a free agent for the first time. Though anything could happen, the 
prevailing feeling in baseball circles is that Williams will sign 
elsewhere. Williams, the American League batting champion and a Gold 
Glove outfielder, was one of 28 players who filed for free agency, 
raising the number of free agents to 80. Joining Williams Monday were 
Kevin Brown and Steve Finley of San Diego, Roberto Alomar of Baltimore, 
Gregg Jefferies of Anaheim, Tim Raines of the Yankees and Carlos Baerga 
and Armando Reynoso of the Mets. The Yankees have reached this juncture 
with the home-grown Williams by not trying to sign him to a multiyear 
contract earlier in his career. They offered him a five-year contract 
for $37.5 million last winter, but his agent, Scott Boras, told the 
Yankees he was looking for a seven-year deal that would put Williams 
in the economic class of Albert Belle and Sammy Sosa, meaning $10 
million to $11 million a year. Brian Cashman, the Yankees' general 
manager, returned to his office Monday after a brief respite to celebrate 
the World Series championship, and one of his first pieces of business 
was a telephone call to Boras. ``I was just letting Scott know that 
Bernie is our No. 1 priority,'' Cashman said about the 15-minute conversation. 
``I reminded him I honored my obligation by not approaching Bernie 
about his contract all season. I told him we are very interested in 
keeping Bernie, and hopefully at some time when we make an offer, 
he'll find it reasonable and acceptable and we can continue our relationship.'' 
Cashman said the Yankees must have discussions internally before he 
can make an offer to the 30-year-old Williams, but ``the intent is 
to do something fairly quickly.'' Cashman was said to have told a 
baseball agent during the World Series that he didn't expect Williams 
to sign with the Yankees, but Cashman declined to comment on what 
he might have said. The general manager said Boras made no response 
to his remarks about Williams. Cashman also said he did not talk with 
Boras about Brown, another of his clients. Brown and Randy Johnson 
will be the two most attractive and expensive pitchers available as 
free agents this off season. ``It's important for me to start the 
ball rolling in house,'' Cashman said, ``before I have a conversation 
with anyone outside.'' Cashman said he has spoken in recent days with 
the Yankees' other potential free agents or their agents except for 
Raines. The Yankees are not expected to re-sign Raines. David Cone 
has until midnight Wednesday to exercise the $5.5 million option in 
his contract. If he rejects it, he can become a free agent and try 
to negotiate another contract with the Yankees. Among clubs expected 
to have interest in at least talking with Williams are Detroit, Texas, 
Arizona and Baltimore. Doug Melvin, the Rangers' general manager, 
found it amusing that one report had designated the Rangers as the 
front-runner in the Williams race. ``It's all speculation because 
Juan and Pudge are from Puerto Rico and I signed him originally,'' 
Melvin said by telephone from Arlington, Tex., referring to the Rangers' 
top stars, Juan Gonzalez and Ivan Rodriguez, and the fact that they 
come from the same country as Williams. ``We have to look at pitching 
first. I don't rule out signing a position player, but we're still 
going to focus on pitching first. If we can add pitching, we'll decide 
after that if we can pursue someone else.'' The pact Boras seeks for 
Williams will most likely be affected by the seven-year, $91 million 
contract the Mets gave Mike Piazza. The agent will likely try to make 
Brown the highest-paid pitcher, seeking more than the $12.5 million 
a year Pedro Martinez averages with Boston. Of the two players who 
filed for free agency Monday, the Mets have indicated that they will 
let Baerga go but have been noncommittal about Reynoso. They are deep 
in starting pitching, but Reynoso was one of the reasons they were 
deep this year. Among other players who filed were B.J. Surhoff and 
Jimmy Key of Baltimore, Tim Belcher of Kansas City, Paul Molitor of 
Minnesota, Rickey Henderson of Oakland, John Jaha of Milwaukee and 
Pat Kelly of St. Louis. --- A two-year contract extension for Yankee 
Manager Joe Torre appears to be imminent. The Yankees, who will pay 
Torre about $1.3 million next season, are prepared to give him a salary 
in the $2 million neighborhood for each of the two seasons after that.
