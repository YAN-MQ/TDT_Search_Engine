The Central Bank has taken over a private bank after depositors began 
withdrawing money following allegations that its owner has ties to 
a mafia boss. The bank's owner, Korkmaz Yigit, was quoted by the daily 
newspaper Milliyet on Monday as saying depositors dlrs 200 million 
in the week following the release of a taped conversation between 
himself and mafia boss Alaattin Cakici. The government issued a statement 
Sunday saying the Central Bank would take over Bank Ekspres and appoint 
new directors and auditors. It cited ``recent developments'' as the 
reason for the takeover, without elaborating. The scandal also forced 
Yigit to decide to sell off his recently acquired TV stations and 
newspapers. And last week, the government suspended the privatization 
of another bank, Turkbank, because of Yigit's alleged mafia ties. 
In the taped conversation, Yigit is heard asking Cakici to help him 
fend off rival bidders. Yigit, the winning bidder for Turkbank, has 
said he did nothing wrong. A government minister has also resigned 
after a tape linking him to Cakici was released.
