After President Clinton acknowledged his relationship with Monica 
Lewinsky, many democrats were concerned that his actions would hurt 
their election chances. Wolf Blitzer reports, those fears may be unfounded. 
After a long weekend of fund-raising in California, president clinton 
got some good and bad news in the latest polls. A CNN/"USA today" 
Gallup poll shows republican candidates with a slight lead over democrats 
among likely voters in next week's elections -- 49% to 47%. And the 
poll shows republicans are more motivated to vote. 51% of democrats 
say they're less enthusiastic about voting this year. Only 39% of 
republicans say that. Still, the president took the day off, his aides 
insisting he can afford to. I think the president is focused on doing 
what has the optimal value for democrats around the country. And that's 
what we're doing. That means, yes only to fund-raising, but no to 
campaign rallies and rope lines which are left to the first lady and 
the vice president. It's a variation of the rose garden strategy -- 
after getting a budget through Congress and a new Middle East peace 
agreement. And far from being a drag on democratic candidates, supporters 
insist he's helping them. People continue to like his performance 
in office. They continue to like the positions which he champions. 
And those are democratic positions and ones the democratic candidates 
are running on all over the country. Poll numbers back them up. Despite 
next month's impeachment hearings, the new CNN/"USA today" Gallup 
poll shows the president's job approval rating remains rock solid 
at 65%. Republicans say these numbers are misleading. That's not what 
this election is about. The election is more about his personal approval 
rating and his personal behavior rather than his job as president. 
Both presidents Eisenhower and Reagan also had high job approval ratings 
at the same point in their second terms though not as high as President 
Clinton's. But their fellow republican candidates suffered major losses 
in those midterm elections. Wolf Blitzer, CNN, the White House.
