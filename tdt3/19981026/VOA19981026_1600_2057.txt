Russian president Boris Yeltsin has been forced to cancel a one-day 
trip to Vienna, where he was to have met on Tuesday with European 
Union officials. VOA Moscow correspondent Peter Heinlein reports. 
The original plan had been for Mr. Yeltsin to make an overnight visit 
to the Austrian capital, but that trip was scaled back last week because 
of the 67-year-old Russian leader's poor health. First word of the 
cancellation came Monday from an Austrian news agency. Just hours 
earlier, the Kremlin had reported Mr. Yeltsin was busy preparing for 
the visit at his country residence. But after news of the cancellation 
broke, Kremlin spokesman Dimitri Yakushkin said, "Mr. Yeltsin is suffering 
from extreme fatigue, and doctors have forbidden him from traveling." 
But Mr. Yakushkin said the Russian leader would not be hospitalized. 
Mr. Yeltsin was forced to cut short a trip to central Asia earlier 
this month because of what was described as a respiratory infection. 
He will be replaced in Vienna by Prime Minister Yevgeny Primakov.
