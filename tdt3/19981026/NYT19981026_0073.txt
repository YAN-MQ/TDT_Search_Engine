Maybe it was just a false dawn _ there have been plenty of those. 
But as the Dow Jones industrial average rose, the final touches were 
put on a $30 billion package to prop up Brazil, and Japan committed 
a half a trillion dollars to save its banks, there was hope last week 
that the worst of the global financial upheaval might be passing. 
The case for optimism goes like this: Investors may be realizing that 
their panicky race for the exits, into Treasury bonds and anything 
else that seems secure, was as much an overreaction as their rush 
into the world's emerging markets in the mid-1990s was a triumph of 
blind optimism. After all, the interest-rate cuts pulled off by the 
Federal Reserve in recent weeks show that someone is paying attention. 
Interest rates in Thailand and South Korea have fallen to 7 percent, 
evidence that their economies may finally get going. Sure, Indonesia 
has turned into a lawless land, with mobs burning out the shops of 
ethnic Chinese merchants and chopping off the heads of suspected sorcerers, 
but its currency, the rupiah, is making a surprising comeback. Even 
the Commerce Department's announcement last week of a mammoth August 
trade deficit for the United States, $16.77 billion, was greeted by 
the markets as good news: America remains the last big-time consumer 
on the globe, the numbers showed, and projections that the 1999 trade 
deficit could hit $300 billion for the year suggests the United States 
will keep consuming. In other words, even as America's growth slows, 
it may pull Asia and Japan out of recession. Of course, there were 
plenty of optimists around in the spring, declaring that the sky had 
stopped falling. That was just before Russia defaulted on its debts 
and backtracked on its commitments to economic reform. And it was 
when Japan's troubles still seemed limited to $600 billion in bad 
bank loans, instead of more than $1 trillion. ``It took a long time 
for these problems to develop, and it will take a long time for the 
world to work through them,'' Treasury Secretary Robert Rubin cautioned 
last week. Meanwhile, his aides are explaining what fundamentally 
good shape Brazil is in, which must explain why it is about to become 
the fifth country to receive a multi-billion rescue package in the 
past year.
