Peru and Ecuador have signed a comprehensive peace accord in Brasilia, 
ending a long and sometimes bloody border dispute. More from correspondent 
George Meek. Ecuadorian president Jamil Mahuad and Peruvian leader 
Alberto Fujimori signed the presidential act of Brasilia, accepting 
a solution to their dispute offered by Argentina, Brazil, Chile and 
the United States. Speaking for these four nations was Brazilian president 
Fernando Henrique Cardoso. He says Peru and Ecuador have shown the 
world today that South America's distinguishing characteristic is 
that it is a zone of peace. The settlement gives Peru most of the 
disputed territory, but Ecuador gets access to the Amazon River. The 
two nations fought most recently in 1995. George Meek, VOA News, Brasilia.
