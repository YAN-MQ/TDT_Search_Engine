More talks on the civil war in Congo have opened in Lusaka. VOA's 
Scott Stearns reports from the Zambian capital that mediators are 
calling for an immediate cease-fire and the withdrawal of foreign 
troops. Zambian president Frederick Chiluba opened the talks, asking 
regional foreign ministers to put aside their differences and work 
toward a cease-fire. Regional leaders are convinced that violence 
is not the solution to the problem in the Congo. The solution lies 
in a quiet and reasoned settlement of pertinent issues. The talks 
include officials from more than a dozen nations with rebel allies 
Uganda and Rwanda and countries backing president Laurent Kabila, 
including Angola, Zimbabwe and Namibia. Officials are expected to 
come up with recommendations for a heads of state summit on Congo 
next month. So far, the war is following much the same pattern as 
the rebellion that brought Mr. Kabila to power last year. Both sides 
pursue some diplomatic initiatives while concentrating most on the 
fight at hand. Scott Stearns, VOA News, Lusaka.
