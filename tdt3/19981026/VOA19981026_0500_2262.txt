In Asia today, Typhoon Babs weakened to a tropical storm over the 
South China Sea, after killing more than 100 people in the Philippines, 
causing millions of dollars in damage. VOA correspondent Chris Simkins 
has more on this story from the VOA Asian News Center in Hong Kong. 
As the deadly typhoon weakened over the South China Sea, clean-up 
and search efforts intensified in the Philippines, where the powerful 
storm left a trail of death and destruction. Civil defense officials 
say at least 160 people are either dead or missing after the storm 
battered the island for three days. More than 320,000 people fled 
their homes as the typhoon, packing winds of 150 kilometers per hour 
and heavy rain, caused massive flooding and landslides around the 
capital, Manila, and northern sections of the Philippines. Officials 
say 62 people were killed by landslides, and more than 100 people 
were injured by flying debris. Weather forecasters say the remnants 
of the powerful typhoon, now downgraded to a tropical storm, will 
pass 200 kilometers from Hong Kong as it tracks northeasterly along 
the south China coast. Babs is the second powerful typhoon to hit 
the Philippines in a week. Super-typhoon Zeb, which hit the island 
two days earlier, killed at least 74 people. Civil defense officials 
say the death toll from Typhoon Babs is likely to rise as relief operations 
continue and telephone service is restored to hard-hit areas. The 
worst devastation was in Luzon Island, where Philippines president 
Joseph Estrada declared three provinces and a city disaster areas. 
Meanwhile, officials say the monetary damage from the storm could 
send the Philippines into recession. Planning officials estimate Typhoon 
Babs has caused hundreds of millions of dollars in damage, accounting 
for more than half of the Philippines' gross domestic product. Chris
