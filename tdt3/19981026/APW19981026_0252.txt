One seaman died early Monday as Danish and German navy rescuers evacuated 
the crew of a burning freighter in the stormy North Sea. The fire 
aboard the Italian-owned freighter ``Pallas'' broke out Sunday about 
110 kilometers (70 miles) off the west coast of Denmark. The ship 
was en route to Morocco with a load of timber, the Danish navy said. 
The crew tried to get the fire under control, but requested evacuation 
after it appeared the ship was foundering. The navy said all of the 
17 crew members except the captain leaped into the sea to be picked 
up by helicopters, but one of them was crushed against the ship's 
hull. The victim's name and nationality were not immediately released. 
The crew included seamen from Poland, Bulgaria, Yugoslavia and the 
Philippines. The others were taken aboard the helicopters and no serious 
injuries were reported among them, although 12 of them were taken 
to a hospital in Esbjerg for observation, the navy said. The captain, 
a Pole, remained aboard for several hours, then was evacuated. The 
burning ship was left drifting and the Danish navy said the seas were 
too high to try towing it. The ship is owned by Bugatti Shipping Services 
of Italy and registered in the Bahamas, the navy said.
