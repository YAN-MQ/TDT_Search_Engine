Two South American nations, Ecuador and Peru, sign a peace agreement 
today in Brasilia to end a long and bitter border dispute. Details 
from correspondent George Meek in the Brazilian capital. Ecuadorian 
president Jamil Mahuad and Peruvian president Alberto Fujimori will 
sign the global peace agreement, which includes a border settlement, 
a treaty of commerce and navigation on the Amazon River and an agreement 
for development of the border area. The ceremony will be witnessed 
by the presidents of Argentina, Brazil and Chile and a representative 
of the United States. Those four nations guaranteed a 1942 peace treaty 
between Ecuador and Peru and worked out the final points on the latest 
settlement. Peru wins its claim to territory on the east slope of 
the Condor Mountains, where the two nations fought a brief war three 
years ago. Ecuador will gain symbolic possession of a demilitarized 
base, and ecological parks will be created on both sides of the border. 
The special U.S. envoy to the peace process, Luigi Einaudi, said marking 
the disputed border will be an historic turning point. The borders 
will be completed. And once they're completed, you don't have to worry 
about them anymore. You don't have to spend a lot of money in defense 
expenditures anymore. You can get on with the business of integration 
and growth. Ambassador Einaudi says the decision of the four presidents 
of the guarantor countries was the best one available and adds to 
the context of common interest between the two parties. The settlement 
is overwhelmingly a settlement that is agreed upon between the two 
countries. There are mutual interests, and it's favorable. The U.S. 
diplomat says the most difficult aspect of the negotiations was psychological 
mindsets on the part of the two countries. He says a dispute over 
sovereignty blocked development of the area and kept Ecuador from 
access to the Amazon. Pope John Paul has given his blessing to the 
settlement and sent Cardinal Darien Castrillon as his representative 
to the signing ceremony. The king and queen of Spain will also be 
present. George Meek, VOA News, Brasilia.
