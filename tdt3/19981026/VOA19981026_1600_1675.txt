Time to head into space. The Russian space agency launched a supply 
ship carrying several tons of fuel and other cargo to the two cosmonauts 
aboard the Mir space station. The Progress cargo ship blasted off 
from the Baikonur site in Kazakhstan and was scheduled to dock with 
Mir Tuesday. Progress is carrying a meteorite monitor that the cosmonauts 
will install during a space walk next month. The monitor will be used 
to collect data on a meteorite shower the Mir will enter in mid November. 
Also onboard Progress is a giant experimental space mirror measuring 
about 30 meters in diameter. That's to be unfurled in February. It's 
designed to test whether sunlight can be reflected toward northern 
Russia during those long winter nights they have there. The launch 
of Progress has been postponed several times since August because 
of Russia's severe financial problems.
