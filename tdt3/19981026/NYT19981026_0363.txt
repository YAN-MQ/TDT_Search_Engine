In an emotional ceremony that officially ends a bitter conflict that 
spanned generations, the presidents of Peru and Ecuador signed a peace 
treaty here Monday to open their borders and create avenues for trade 
and development. Coming weeks after the two countries had nearly stumbled 
back into war, the treaty relies on four guarantor nations to outline 
the two nations' borders. Blocked in a stalemate over the ill-defined 
line, the presidents of Ecuador and Peru asked President Clinton and 
President Fernando Henrique Cardoso of Brazil to settle the dispute. 
In addition to Brazil and the United States, the other guarantors 
are Chile and Argentina. ``We must continue to free ourselves of our 
prejudices, to overcome traumas that have been generated over more 
than half a century,'' President Alberto K. Fujimori of Peru said 
Monday. Under the accord Ecuador gains the use of a square kilometer 
of Peruvian territory at Tiwinza, atop the Condor Mountains, where 
it will build a monument to its war dead. Though under Peruvian sovereignty, 
the territory will remain under Ecuadorean control. Tiwinza was the 
site of the last Ecuadorean holdout against Peru in 1995, and 12 Ecuadorean 
soldiers are believed to be buried there. Ecuador will also gain access 
to the Amazon River and the right to build two ports in Peru. Sweetening 
the peace were accords on navigation, trade and development that will 
release $3 billion of aid to the region. The two countries plan to 
link electrical grids and have agreed that Ecuador may instead turn 
to an underused Peruvian pipeline.
