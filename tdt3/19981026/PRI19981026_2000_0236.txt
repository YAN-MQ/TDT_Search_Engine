Emergency officials in Honduras have ordered people to evacuate before 
Hurricane Mitch comes ashore. The National Hurricane Center in Miami 
has classed Mitch as a category five storm with winds that are now 
at 180 miles per hour. It's expected to hit Honduras the hardest tonight 
and tomorrow. The Honduran government sent Air Force planes to remove 
people from islands off the coast. Honduras has been devastated by 
hurricanes in the past, including Hurricane Fifi, which killed at 
least 2,000 people in 1974.
