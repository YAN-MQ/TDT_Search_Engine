An Israeli security guard was shot three times and his body dumped 
in downtown Hebron on Monday in an apparent attack by Palestinian 
militants. There was no immediate claim of responsibility for the 
slaying. The dead man was found sprawled face down on the pavement, 
a pool of blood flowing from his head. Hours later, police found the 
body of a Palestinian man near the Jewish settlement of Itamar in 
the West Bank. The body was found after police received an anonymous 
phone call from a man speaking in Hebrew who said a Palestinian had 
been killed and his body left near Itamar to avenge the Hebron slaying. 
Several Israelis have been killed in Hebron in the past by militants 
hoping to wreck Mideast peacemaking. The most recent such killing 
was in August, when a rabbi was slain by a member of the Islamic militant 
group Hamas. Israeli radio reporters cited Israeli security officials 
as saying the assailants apparently were Palestinian militants. Israel 
has been bracing for terror attacks in recent weeks, and especially 
since the signing of the new peace agreement between Israel and the 
Palestinians in Washington last week. Israel TV identifed the dead 
Palestinian as Mohammed Zalmouk, a 65-year-old from a neighboring 
Palestinian village who worked in the olive groves outside Itamar. 
The dead Israeli was identified as 29-year-old Daniel Vargas. The 
killing in Hebron occurred shortly after 2 p.m. (noon GMT) in the 
downtown Shaaba neighborhood, an area under Israeli control about 
400 yards (meters) from the Jewish settlement of Kiryat Arba. Several
