Hello again from Washington. I'm Charlene Porter, along with Paul 
Westpheling. Palestinian leader Yasser Arafat is traveling to several 
Arab capitals, explaining the new Middle East peace agreement that 
he reached last week with Israeli prime minister Benjamin Netanyahu. 
In Cairo, Mr. Arafat said that he hopes the Wye River agreement will 
be implemented accurately and faithfully. Sunday, Mr. Arafat met with 
Egypt's president Hosni Mubarak, Algerian president Liamine Zeroual 
and Morocco's King Hassan. And he also stops to -- or he also plans 
to stop in Tunisia and Saudi Arabia.
