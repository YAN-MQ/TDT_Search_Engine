Much more news still to come on THE WORLD. Don't forget, you can join 
us anytime online at www.theworld.org. This is THE WORLD on PRI, Public 
Radio International. Hello, I'm Bill Murazo, president of WHYY. In 
partnership with you, 91 FM serves our community by informing and 
educating its listeners. If you've made a pledge during the radio 
membership drive, thanks for your support and thanks for making the 
Delaware Valley a better place to live. I'm Lisa Mullins. Coming up 
on THE WORLD, a new idea from big brother. It's called Harlequin. 
It was an application that could listen into people's telephone calls. 
And if somebody you call happens to be a bad person, you watch who 
that bad person calls and create a network of bad people basically. 
Rewarding invaders of personal privacy still to come on THE WORLD. 
First though, this news.
