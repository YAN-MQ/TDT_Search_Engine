This is THE WORLD, a co-production of the BBC World Service, PRI, 
and WGBH Boston. Today is Monday, October 26th. I'm Lisa Mullins in 
Boston. Coming up, in the Middle East, a lukewarm reaction to the 
land-for-peace deal. The Palestinian people certainly are much more 
skeptical. They do not look at this as a serious breakthrough or as 
an earth-shattering agreement. In Mexico, progress in the war on drugs. 
The big flights, the huge cargo aircraft flying out of Columbia and 
into Mexico, those days are over 'cause we definitely will seize the 
aircraft and arrest them on the ground. And in South Africa, lightning 
strikes. First, though, this news.
