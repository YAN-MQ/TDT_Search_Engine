Peru and Ecuador ended a half-century dispute Monday by signing a 
peace treaty that settles ownership of a slice of Amazon jungle the 
neighboring countries fought two wars to control. The presidents and 
foreign ministers of both countries signed the accord at a ceremony 
in Brazil's capital, where most of the peace talks took place. The 
United States, Brazil, Argentina and Chile brokered the treaty, which 
demarcates the border in a 77-kilometer (48-mile) section of the Andean 
foothills. Peru and Ecuador both claimed the area, which was left 
undefined after a 1941 border war. The two countries fought over the 
strip of land in 1981 and 1995. Monday's agreement lays ``the cement 
of peace,'' said Peruvian President Alberto Fujimori. ``Now we should 
start to build the building, beautiful and inhabitable,'' he said 
at the signing ceremony. In a gesture of reconciliation, Ecuadoran 
President Jamil Mahuad gave Fujimori a canteen used by Ecuadoran soldiers 
during the 1941 war. ``The Amazon could have been destroyed by a war. 
Now we preserve it with a peace accord,'' Mahuad said. Mahuad and 
Fujimori also signed a separate agreement dealing with cooperation 
on security, energy, tourism and trade. The peace treaty draws the 
border along the heights of the Cordillera del Condor mountain range, 
as Peru wanted. But it grants a hill within Peruvian territory to 
Ecuador's government. The 100-hectare (250-acre) hill area, known 
as Tiwintza, is of great symbolic importance to Ecuador because its 
soldiers successfully defended it against Peruvian forces during the 
1995 war. In northern Peru on Saturday, protesters angry about losing 
possession of the hill set fire to government trucks and offices. 
Three people were trampled to death when police dispersed the crowd 
of 5,000 with tear gas bombs in the jungle city of Iquitos, 970 kilometers 
(600 miles) northeast of Lima. Ecuador and Peru began peace talks 
in 1995. After years of slow progress, the presidents of the two nations 
met in August to work out the final details. As a condition for brokering 
the talks, the United States and the other three sponsors insisted 
that Peru and Ecuador accept whatever outcome was reached. ``I think 
this is going to ... unleash a lot of investment in the private sector, 
in the linkage of pipelines, for instance,'' said U.S. envoy Luigi 
Einaudi. ``Ecuador has a lot of oil under the ground that it can't 
get out, and Peru has a pipeline that is half full.'' The treaty also 
calls for contiguous national parks to be created in the disputed 
area. ``It's been a good week for peace accords ... Israel and now 
this,'' said Thomas ``Mack'' McLarty, a U.S. envoy at the talks and 
a former aide to President Clinton, who attended the signing ceremony.
