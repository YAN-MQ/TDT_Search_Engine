Well, we had something of a mixed day, with the Dow Jones Industrial 
Average closing at 8432. That was down 20 points. But the Standard 
& Poor's 500 index closed at 1072. That was up 1 1/2 points. And NASDAQ 
had a good day. It ended up 31 points. For the first time in almost 
three years, there was an unscheduled trading halt on the New York 
Stock Exchange. A computer failure shut down trading for almost one 
hour at mid session. A similar problem occurred back in December of 
1995. Well, in general, corporate profits in the latest quarter have 
been as expected or somewhat better than expected. But many on Wall 
Street wonder whether profits can be sustained through the end of 
the year. Consumer spending, which represents two-thirds of the U.S. 
economy, is going to be a key factor in that, and there will be a 
lot of attention paid tomorrow, Tuesday, when the monthly consumer 
confidence index is released. Once again, Dow Jones Industrial Average 
closing today down 20 points. This is Breck Ardery. Thank you, Breck.
