Thousands of university students clashed with police Monday in the 
second day of demonstrations to protest tuition fees. Police officers 
dragged students and pushed them off the street outside Tel Aviv university 
after students tried to block a major road, Israel TV reported. Police 
said eight students were arrested. In Beersheba, a student leader 
from Ben Gurion University was expelled from the city and banned from 
returning for a week, Israel radio said. ``Yaakov, resign!'' students 
shouted, calling for the resignation of Yaakov Neeman, the treasury 
minister who has refused their demands to subsidize 50 percent of 
the annual undergraduate tuition fee of dlrs 3000. Under heavy criticism 
for their handling of Sunday's demonstrations in which police beat 
back students with clubs, police said that clubs were not used to 
disperse the protesters Monday. Student demonstrators have been blocking 
entrances to all but university workers since the strike began Sunday, 
the day the academic year was to open.
