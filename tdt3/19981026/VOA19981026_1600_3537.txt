Hey, here's a man's man type of story. In Fairbanks, Alaska, Bob Brooks 
likes playing ice hockey. He likes it so much he's been playing it 
for a long time -- since the 1920s. Mr. Brooks was a boy then. He's 
now 78 years old, continues to play. He's part of an old-timers league 
in Fairbanks. But most of the other so-called old-timers are nearly 
30 years younger than Bob Brooks. He admits that age has slowed him 
up just a little bit. But Mr. Brooks isn't ready to hang up his ice 
skates and give up hockey. He says he's just having plain too much 
fun.
