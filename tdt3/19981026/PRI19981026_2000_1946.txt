The countdown is underway for John Glenn's historic return to space. 
Clocks began ticking away this morning at Cape Canaveral, Florida 
ahead of blast off Thursday afternoon. The 77-year-old senator says 
the flight is one big science experiment. This is going to be a very 
research rich flight. We got about 83 different projects on this. 
We're just looking forward very, very much to Thursday and getting 
off on time we hope. And this is just a great group of people. I'm 
honored to be with them. John Glenn, the first American to orbit the 
Earth back in 1962 heading back into space to do it again.
