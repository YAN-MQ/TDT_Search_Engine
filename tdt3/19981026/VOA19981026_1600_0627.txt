to collect and record evidence against Osama bin Laden, a Saudi militant 
who lives in Afghanistan is alleged to be one of the world's major 
sponsors of terrorism. Ias Gould reports from Islamabad. A Taliban 
statement is inviting outsiders to present evidence to the Taliban 
supreme court that would link Osama bin Laden to terrorist activity. 
The statement says such evidence would then be used by the Taliban's 
chief justice to proceed against Mr. bin Laden under the country's 
Islamic laws. Mr. bin Laden has been living in Afghanistan under the 
protection of the Taliban. He has declared a holy war against the 
United States and is a key suspect in the bombings in August of two 
American embassies in East Africa. The bombings prompted the United 
States to launch a missile attack two months ago on suspected terrorist 
bases in Afghanistan. Washington says the terrorist bases are linked 
to Mr. bin Laden. At least 26 people were killed in the U.S. attack. 
Speaking with a Taliban representative in Washington last week, senior 
U.S. officials reiterated Osama bin Laden must be brought to trial. 
The Taliban says it is ready to try Mr. bin Laden if solid evidence 
of his responsibility in terrorist acts is provided to them. This
