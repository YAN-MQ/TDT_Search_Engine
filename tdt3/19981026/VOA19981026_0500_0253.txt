In Iran, moderates and independents have won just 16 of 86 seats in 
elections for the powerful Assembly of Experts, the panel that chooses 
Iran's supreme religious leader. Sunday's results came as no surprise. 
Most moderate candidates were dropped from the ballot before the election. 
Conservatives call Sunday's vote a triumph for democracy. Moderates 
say even with just 15 percent of the seats, the assembly, they say, 
will have a say in the oversight of supreme leader Ayatollah Ali Khameini 
and also in the choice for his eventual successor.
