The White House says we have not seen enough concerning Yugoslav compliance 
with UN demands for a Kosovo pullback. Russian president Boris Yeltsin 
cancels his already-shortened visit to Vienna because his doctors 
say he is not fit to travel. In Iran, conservative candidates and 
their allies celebrate their decisive victory in last Friday's elections 
of the country's Assembly of Experts. Somalia is ranked among the 
poorest and most underdeveloped nations in the world in a new United 
Nations report. I'm Tom Crosby. And I'm Susan Yackee. Those stories, 
sports, business news and this week's music report all ahead in this 
hour of VOA News Now. First, a summary of world news. I'm Pat Bodnar, 
VOA News.
