Police freed a 3-year-old child from a kidnapper who had grabbed the 
boy from his mother in a Berlin subway station on Monday and held 
a knife to his chest, demanding a plane ticket. The boy had minor 
scratches from the kidnapping, which lasted five hours, police said. 
The 25 to 30-year-old Arabic-speaking man apparently wanted to go 
to Algeria, although police described his demands as vague. He demanded 
a plane ticket, then money, which he threw away after it was given 
to him. At one point he also demanded an imprisoned member of the 
Algerian Islamic Salvation Front be freed, police said. A representative 
from the Algerian consulate and an imam from a Berlin mosque, where 
the 25 to 30-year-old man had been thrown out earlier in the day for 
``uncivil behavior,'' helped with the negotiations, police said. The 
kidnapper was overpowered when he became distracted and stopped pressing 
the knife against the boy, police said. The child had been seized 
at about noon at the Kottbusser Tor station in the Kreuzberg district. 
All streets and subway exits in the area were closed off as police 
negotiated with the kidnapper. A witness said the mother fell to her 
knees pleading with the man to give her child back, but was ignored. 
During the ordeal she was cared for by police psychologists along 
with her husband, who had arrived at the scene later.
