Sunday was a big day in the National Football League for place-kicker 
Jason Elam of the Denver Broncos. He tied the NFL record for the longest 
field goal with a 63-yard blast that just cleared the goal posts. 
Elam now moves into the record books with Tom Dempsey of the New Orleans 
Saints, who also kicked a 63-yard field goal back in 1970. Elam's 
kick helped give the Denver Broncos a 37-24 win over the Jacksonville 
Jaguars. The Minnesota Vikings are undefeated as they downed the Detroit 
Lions 34-13 for their seventh straight win of the season. Quarterback 
Randall Cunningham threw two touchdown passes, and Robert Smith ran 
for 134 yards as the Vikings reeled off 17 straight points in the 
third quarter to seal the victory. The New York Jets soared past the 
Atlanta Falcons 28-3. The Green Bay Packers defeated the Baltimore 
Ravens 28-10. The Miami Dolphins were overtime winners over the New 
England Patriots 12-9. The New Orleans Saints beat the Tampa Bay Buccaneers 
9-3, and the San Francisco 49ers defeated the St. Louis Rams 28-0. 
Also winning, the Seattle Seahawks beat the San Diego Chargers. The 
Oakland Raiders downed the Cincinnati Bengals. And the Chicago Bears 
were winners over the Tennessee Oilers.
