Two more politicians have joined the race for Kazakstan's presidential 
election in January, bringing the number of candidates to four, a 
news agency reported Monday. Communist leader Serikbolsyn Abdildin 
and a lawmaker in the upper house of parliament, Engels Gabbasov, 
have registered at the Central Electoral Commission, the Interfax 
news agency reported, citing commission official Yelena Kuleshova. 
Gabbasov is running as an independent. The other two candidates in 
the Jan. 10 election in this former Soviet republic in Central Asia 
are former Prime Minister Akezhan Kazhegeldin and autocratic President 
Nursultan Nazarbayev, who remains a clear favorite. Nazarbayev's government 
has been criticized by international human rights groups for restricting 
Kazakstan's opposition and the media. In a separate development Monday, 
Nazarbayev appointed Kazakstan's former ambassador to Turkey, Baltash 
Tursumbayev, as deputy prime minister. The presidential press service 
would not say what sectors Tursumbayev would be responsible for, according 
to Interfax.
