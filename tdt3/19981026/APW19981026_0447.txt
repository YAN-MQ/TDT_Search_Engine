Lebanon criticized Monday the Israeli-Palestinian agreement as ``a 
big disappointment'' and accused Palestinians of abandoning Arabs 
who have supported them. ``The agreement was a big disappointment 
compared with Arab aspirations,'' Foreign Minister Faris Bweiz said 
of the deal reached Friday. ``The Palestinian side is paying a very 
high price.'' Criticism of Israeli-Palestinian negotiations is common 
since Lebanon's own talks with the Jewish state have been deadlocked 
for more than two years. Negotiations between Israel and Syria, the 
dominant power in Lebanon, also have gone nowhere since 1996. Both 
Lebanon and Syria say they will negotiate simultaneously and are demanding 
an Israeli withdrawal from southern Lebanon and from Syria's Golan 
Heights. President Elias Hrawi, in a speech opening a conference of 
Arab engineers Monday, lashed out at the Palestinians for going it 
alone and giving up on territory Israel occupies in Lebanon and Syria. 
``All the Arabs have carried the burden of their cause for 50 years. 
They made Lebanon carry the burden of their ambitions and maneuvering. 
... They've undermined the (Arab) confrontation front and support 
and destroyed our state,'' Hrawi said. Many Lebanese blame Palestinian 
guerrillas, who ran a state-within-a-state in Lebanon in the 1970s, 
for contributing to the devastating 1975-90 civil war. Many Palestinians, 
in turn, feel Arab states have cynically used their cause.
