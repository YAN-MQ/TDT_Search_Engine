Germany's new parliament convenes today for its first session to install 
a center-left government after 16 years of conservative rule. Deputies 
will officially confirm Gerhard Schroeder and -- as chancellor. His 
Social Democratic Party has formed a coalition with the pro-environment 
Green Party, so job creation will be the new government's top priority. 
It also has pledged to continue strong ties with NATO.
