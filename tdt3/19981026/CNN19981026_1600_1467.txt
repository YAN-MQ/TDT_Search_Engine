A Milwaukee man who won a $25 million judgment in a lawsuit says he 
has to leave town because he can't find work. While working for Miller 
brewing, Jerry mackenzie discussed a risque "Seinfeld" TV episode 
with a female co-worker. The company fired him after she complained 
his remarks were offensive. He sued and won but hasn't collected a 
dime yet because the case is under appeal. He says employers in Milwaukee 
won't hire him because of the suit.
