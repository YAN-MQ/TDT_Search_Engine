And in the state of Delaware tonight, the latest twist in a murder 
case involving one of the state's best-known families, a beautiful 
aide to the governor and brother against brother. The accused is Thomas 
capano, and today his lawyers opened their defense with a stunning 
strategy. Here's NBC's Pete Williams. a stunning reversal. Lawyers 
for Thomas capano now say he did dump the body of his mistress into 
the ocean two years ago to cover up her death. But they insist he 
did not murder her. Once a well-connected lawyer from a prominent 
Delaware family, he's charged with killing 30-year-old Anne Marie 
Fahey, a secretary for the governor, whose disappearance in June of 
1996 launched an intensive search. Today, prosecutors told the jury 
that capano planned the murder for months, after she tried to break 
off their affair. They said his own brother, Gerry, told investigators 
that capano asked him to come along on this boat a few days after 
Fahey disappeared, and that from a town on the Delaware coast, they 
went out 60 miles and dumped a 3 1/2-foot-long cooler like this, with 
her body inside, into the ocean. Capano's defense team has always 
insisted that was a lie, until today. In a complete about-face, his 
lead lawyer told the jury that Anne Marie fahey died of "an outrageous, 
horrible, tragic accident," though he didn't say what it was. But 
he confirmed that capano disposed of her body and implied she died 
at capano's house. My client and his brother took the body out to 
sea, as Gerry has said, in the cooler, and it was dumped. why? Because 
you couldn't keep it at home. Another surprise -- defense lawyers 
now claim a witness, whose name they haven't revealed, saw Anne Marie 
Fahey die. Dramatic moves by the defense, trying to Blunt the evidence 
against capano, including another of his mistresses, who claims he 
asked her to buy him a Gun shortly before Fahey died, and a jail inmate, 
who says capano tried to get her and his brother killed so they couldn't 
testify. If convicted capano could face the death penalty, the trial 
the most sensational in Delaware's history, will likely last at least 
two months. Pete Williams, NBC news, Washington.
