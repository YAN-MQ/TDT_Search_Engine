Here's news that many fans of the new beetle are eager to hear. Some 
of the popular cars are going topless, and Volkswagen has nothing 
to do with it. Greg LaMotte explains. Notice anything unusual about 
this car? Okay, here's a second look. Still need one more guess? Here 
goes. Yes, it's definitely a Volkswagen beetle convertible. I feel 
like a kid again. I'm having a blast. You make friends everywhere 
in it. But you know what? Volkswagen isn't making convertibles with 
its new beetle model. Two conversion shops in southern California 
have become the first to chop the beetle top and turn brand new beetles 
into those nostalgic ragtops. Interest is unbelievable. We've got 
requests from all over the world wanting to know when they can get 
the car, how they can get the car. There's just wild enthusiasm for 
it. You might not be so crazy about the wild price. Beetles are selling 
anywhere from $16,000 to $20,000. A ragtop conversion costs an additional 
$10,000 to $12,000 but that doesn't seem to have stopped beetlemania. 
The demand is real high, because we've been approached from the European 
market as well. They want it for different purposes, either leasing 
or reselling or what, because there's no convertible at this moment, 
not here in the United States, north America or the European market. 
Question is, if they're so hot and everybody wants one, why isn't 
volkswagen producing its own convertible? They're selling every beetle 
that they can sell right now. And when that level of demand falls 
off and they start needing something else to insert in its place, 
that's when the convertible will come in. Between the two southern 
California conversion shops, they hope to produce almost 200 convertible 
beetles a month. Volkswagen is expected to come out with its own version 
in the next three to five years. In the meantime, what do they do 
with those beetle tops? hmm. Maybe they could be sold as portable 
tents. Greg Lamotte, CNN, Newport beach, California.
