Microsoft Corporation chairman Bill Gates's videotaped testimony is 
to be offered as evidence in this the second week of the Justice Department's 
landmark anti-trust court case. The government alleges Microsoft, 
which has a virtual monopoly in the computer software operating systems 
market, has given away its Internet Explorer browser for free, hurting 
competitors like Netscape. Robert Bench, portfolio manager with Altus 
Investment Management, which has a stake in Microsoft, was asked if 
breaking up the company is possible. I don't see that as a really 
big risk. I think the public wants and needs to have standards in 
computing. We really don't want to spend a lot of time thumbing through 
manuals and trying to figure out how you do something like cut and 
paste in two or three different products. So this common user interface 
that Microsoft has put together has enabled us to use a very complex 
product much more simply. Mr. Gates has not been called by either 
side as a witness but has given the government 20 hours of testimony 
on videotape as it prepared its case against the Seattle-based firm.
