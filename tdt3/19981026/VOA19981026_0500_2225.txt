It is 1037 Universal Time. Germany's new parliament convenes today 
for its first session to install a center-left coalition government 
after 16 years of conservative rule. Deputies will officially confirm 
Social Democrat leader Gerhard Schroeder as chancellor, and then German 
president Roman Herzog will swear in the cabinet and, on Tuesday, 
the new chancellor. The Social Democrats formally approved a coalition 
pact with the pro-environment Greens Party during a party congress 
in Bonn Sunday. Chancellor-elect Schroeder has said fighting unemployment 
is his top priority, especially in the former Communist East.
