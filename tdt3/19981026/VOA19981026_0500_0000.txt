elements in the Israeli parliament. A gun battle erupts on the West 
Bank, when Palestinian police try to seize unlicensed guns. That action 
mandated by the new Mid East agreement. The deadline for withdrawing 
Serb forces from Kosovo comes tomorrow. Secretary of State Albright 
says Yugoslavia has not followed through on its agreement. I'm Charlene 
Porter. And I'm Paul Westpheling. Germany's parliament is expected 
to install a new government later today. And we'll continue our look 
at some of the more hotly contested political races to be decided 
next week in the general elections in the U.S. We'll also look at 
sports and business in this next hour of News Now. The news is next.
