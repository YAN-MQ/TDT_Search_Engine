Hurricane Mitch, the strongest atlantic storm of the season is churning 
slowly towards Nicaragua and Honduras. At last report, it was 15 miles 
north of Honduras, moving west northwest at about 8 miles an hour, 
with top sustained winds of 170 miles an hour. Mitch has turned into 
a category 5 storm, the most powerful there is. The national hurricane 
center says the storm is very dangerous and capable of catastrophic 
damage. A hurricane warning remains in effect for portions of the 
Honduran coast to the nicaraguan border. We'll have the extended forecast 
for the United States in just a moment.
