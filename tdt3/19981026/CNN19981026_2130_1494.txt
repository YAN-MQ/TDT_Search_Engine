Senator John Glenn is scheduled to take off aboard the space shuttle 
"Discovery" Thursday. The last time he left earth on a NASA mission, 
the world was a much different place. Garrick Utley has the story. 
Godspeed, John Glenn. How long ago was it when John Glenn orbited 
the earth and came home a national hero? Yeah, yeah, yeah. It was 
when chubby checker was teaching Americans a new dance. And the United 
States began sending a few military advisers to a distant place called 
south Vietnam. It was a time which belongs in a museum, the national 
air and space museum where Glenn's "friendship 7" capsule has become 
a historic relic and a National treasure. A treasure because that 
first flight of an American into orbit restored to the nation a self-confidence 
that had been badly bruised. The bruises had come from a small object, 
no larger than a couple of basketballs. The Soviet sputnik satellite 
launched in 1957. It looked like this and sounded like this -- those 
beeps from space grated on American pride. The real impact was that 
our assumptions about the Soviet Union might have been wrong, in that 
our assumptions of superiority, technically, might have been wrong. 
Those were the coldest years of the cold war. The Soviet military 
arsenal included powerful Rockets, that in 1961, launched Yuri gagarin, 
the first person in space. While U.S. launch Rockets had failed repeatedly 
and publicly in their tests, pressure was building to put an American 
into space. I believe that this nation should commit itself to achieving 
the goal, before this decade is out, of landing a man on the Moon 
and returning him safely to the earth. It was a stirring challenge 
to the nation and the Russians. The only detail missing was that the 
United States was committed to sending an American to the Moon, in 
a lunar Module like this, before it had succeeded in sending even 
one man into orbit around the earth. But John Glenn's time was coming. 
go. All your systems, go. As launch time approached, prayers came 
from the Pope at the vatican. In perth, Australia, people left their 
lights on as a beacon for Glenn's nighttime passage overhead. And 
then the 40-year-old Marine corps test pilot, atop a 92-foot-high 
atlas rocket -- Three, two, one, zero. Loud and clear. -- lifted off 
into history. Garrick Utley, CNN, Washington.
