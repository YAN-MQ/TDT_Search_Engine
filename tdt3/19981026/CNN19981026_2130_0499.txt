In San Francisco, a federal judge has dismissed a suit by antilogging 
protesters whose eyes were doused with pepper spray. Videotapes of 
two incidents shown on national television last year prompted widespread 
complaints of brutality, and nine demonstrators filed suit. In August, 
the trial ended with the jury deadlocked. Dismissing the action, the 
federal district judge said police in humbolt county and Eureka, California, 
exercised reasonable force when they used pepper spray to end the 
two sit-INS.
