Afghanistan's Taliban faction has formally invited outsiders to present 
any evidence that they have that Saudi dissident Osama bin Laden is 
guilty of terrorism. Taliban leader Mullah Mohammad Omar issued a 
decree Sunday, saying the supreme court could use such evidence to 
proceed against Osama bin Laden under Islamic law. The United States 
accuses Osama bin Laden of masterminding two U.S. embassy bombings 
that killed 263 people. Osama bin Laden has lived in Afghanistan for 
years and, until recently, was considered by the Taliban to be a guest.
