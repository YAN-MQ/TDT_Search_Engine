The West Bank city of hebron is closed tonight after an Israeli guard 
was shot to death and a Palestinian man was beaten to death in apparent 
retaliation. It's the first violence since the land for peace deal 
was signed last friday. President Netanyahu also survived a no confidence 
vote in parliament.
