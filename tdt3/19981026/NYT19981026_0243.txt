There are moments in a theatrical career when everything clicks, when 
an actor is embraced by both the public and the critics, when the 
awards and accolades just seem to keep coming. This is that kind of 
moment for Audra McDonald, the 28-year-old actress with a mezzo-soprano 
the likes of which, many say, comes along once in a lifetime. In only 
the last two months, Ms. McDonald has been lavishly praised for her 
performance of selections from ``Porgy and Bess'' in Gershwin centenary 
concerts with Michael Tilson Thomas and the San Francisco Symphony; 
for her rendition of show tunes in ``My Favorite Broadway: The Leading 
Ladies'' at Carnegie Hall, and for her first album, ``Way Back to 
Paradise,'' (Nonesuch Records), which features the work of young composers. 
One of those composers, Michael John LaChiusa, is writing a musical 
play for Ms. McDonald _ ``Marie Christine'' _ that Lincoln Center 
Theater plans to produce next season. And last week she was hailed 
for the first of three Monday evening performances at Joe's Pub, the 
new cabaret at the Joseph Papp Public Theater. In his review in The 
New York Times, Stephen Holden wrote that because of her alternately 
soaring and bluesy voice, ``a better musical future seems not only 
possible but upon us, right here, right now.'' Not to mention the 
fact that Ms. McDonald has won three Tony awards in the last four 
years, and she isn't even 30 yet. But sitting in her dressing room 
before a performance of ``Ragtime'' last week _ for which she won 
her third Tony _ Ms. McDonald was loath to view this point in her 
life as a peak or in any way defining. ``It certainly feels like a 
lot is happening at once _ I must admit it's a bit overwhelming,'' 
she said. ``But I'm trying not to think of it as a moment, because 
I want to continue to do this and continue to grow, because I think 
I have so far to go.'' Ms. McDonald's path has been charmed since 
the beginning. In 1994 she won a Tony for her portrayal of Carrie 
Pipperidge in Lincoln Center Theater's production of ``Carousel.'' 
She won another Tony in 1996 for her portrayal of a voice student 
in ``Master Class,'' the Terrence McNally play about Maria Callas. 
And she won her third Tony last spring, for her portrayal of Sarah, 
Coalhouse Walker Jr.'s love interest in ``Ragtime,'' a role she plays 
through Dec. 27. Ms. McDonald does not seem to be completely aware 
of the extent to which her work has been celebrated of late: She recently 
resolved to stop reading her own reviews. ``I have had to do things 
to keep me centered and grounded,'' she said, ``like not reading reviews, 
and going to my voice lessons obsessively, and walking the dog.'' 
The importance of such reality checks was ingrained in Ms. McDonald 
by her father, a high school principal in Fresno, Calif., where Ms. 
McDonald grew up, and her mother, director of the affirmative-action 
program at California Polytechnic State University at San Luis Obispo. 
Ms. McDonald, who was performing in community theater by age 9, said 
her parents refused to let her move to New York to look for work 10 
years ago unless she pursued an education; she enrolled in Juilliard 
for classical vocal training. ``I have very practical parents,'' Ms. 
McDonald said. ``You can't just go on a dollar and a dream _ that 
was the mantra that was beaten into our heads _ because there are 
a million people behind you willing to take your place and a million 
people ahead of you.'' Those who have worked with her say Ms. McDonald 
has so far managed to avoid the pitfalls of fame, that she still retains 
the look-how-lucky-I-am reverence of someone who has just landed her 
first role. ``She's a very giving artist with almost no ego,'' said 
Brian Stokes Mitchell, who plays opposite Ms. McDonald in ``Ragtime.'' 
``If anything, she's been very resistant to outside forces telling 
her how great she is.'' Indeed, Ms. McDonald said she remembered all 
too well what it felt like to be in line at the unemployment office 
after she arrived in New York; she recently reread her frustrated 
journal entries from that time. ``I was thinking, `God, I want to 
be a Broadway star _ what am I doing at Juilliard?''' Ms. McDonald 
recalled. ``That's still very, very close to me.'' It all changed 
for Ms. McDonald at a Lincoln Center Theater casting call for ``Carousel.'' 
Ira Weitzman, the associate producer of musical theater at Lincoln 
Center who led the audition, clearly remembers the day; June 24, 1993. 
Ms. McDonald sang ``Bill'' from ``Showboat.'' ``I will never forget 
it,'' Weitzman said. ``We all started to lean forward. You could just 
feel the hairs on the back of your head start to move.'' At her big 
call-back, in front of the director, producers and people from the 
Richard Rodgers estate, Ms. McDonald opened her mouth to sing and 
fainted. (She quickly recovered and, of course, got the role.) ``She 
has the most extraordinary, natural, instinctive, magnetic intelligence,'' 
said Nicholas Hytner, who directed Ms. McDonald in ``Carousel.'' ``It's 
really one of those gifts that you have no idea how to describe or 
analyze.'' Mandy Patinkin, who sang with Ms. McDonald on the album 
``Leonard Bernstein's New York,'' said: ``Her voice completely intimidates 
me. She makes me feel like Rex Harrison should have felt when he was 
singing with Julie Andrews. I feel like I'd be much better off just 
talking. She's got a voice from God, just straight from God.'' Yet 
Ms. McDonald _ who lives on Manhattan's Upper West Side with her boyfriend 
of six years, a bassist who plays on Broadway _ does not convey the 
confidence of having arrived. She said she wanted to become a better 
actress; she has no formal acting training. She said she does not 
expect her voice to fully mature for seven to 10 years. And she said 
she continued to navigate the traditionally distinct worlds of classical 
music and Broadway. Because of her operatic background, for example, 
Ms. McDonald said belting still feels like sacrilege. (But she does 
it anyway.) And though it would seem that her many recent successes 
would add up to a smooth ride from here on out, Ms. McDonald said 
she still had to audition for parts and imagined she always would. 
``I don't know that it ever does end for anybody,'' she said. ``You 
still have to go in and prove yourself, over and over each time.''
