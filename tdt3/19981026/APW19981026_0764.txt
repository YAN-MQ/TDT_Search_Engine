World Boxing Council President Jose Sulaiman called Monday for an 
end to the proliferation of international boxing bodies. Sulaiman 
made the appeal at the opening of the WBC's annual convention, in 
which boxing promoters were to consider accepting an agreement to 
unify rules with the World Boxing Association. The agreement _ hammered 
out by the WBC and the WBA in a meeting in Mexico City last April 
_ is aimed at standardizing the names of weight categories, the awarding 
of points, procedures for drug testing and could eventually result 
in only one champion in each weight category. Sulaiman urged an investigation 
into international boxing organizations, saying they must prove the 
validity of their alleged world status. If action was not taken soon, 
``boxing will die in 50 years, and will become merely a circus,'' 
he told WBC delegates at a convention center north of Johannesburg. 
Major boxing bodies include the WBC, the WBA, the International Boxing 
Federation and the World Boxing Organization.
