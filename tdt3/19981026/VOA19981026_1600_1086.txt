It's time now for sports. Joining us with the latest is Parke Brewer 
to tell us about a man who's making the kind of money -- or going 
to be making the kind of money we all dream about. That's right, Tom. 
You know, it's been rumored and reported for a couple of days. It's 
now official. The New York Mets baseball team has struck the richest 
deal in baseball history. All-star catcher Mike Piazza agreed to a 
$91 million seven-year contract to stay with the New York team. VOA 
correspondent Elaine Johanson reports. The New York Mets may not be 
the World Series winning New York Yankees, but they have a $91 million 
man now and maybe -- just maybe -- the Mets will have their chance 
at the championship next year. The contract makes Mike Piazza, 30 
years old, the highest paid player in baseball history. Piazza says 
he never doubted he would be back with the Mets to try to give them 
the big win in 1999. I looked inside, and I knew that I had unfinished 
business here. I knew I wanted to come here. The Mets fans deserve 
a championship, and I want to be on that championship team. This season, 
while playing for the Dodgers in California, then the Marlins in Florida, 
and finally for the Mets in May, Piazza had a.329 batting average 
with 32 homeruns and 111 runs batted in. Elaine Johanson, VOA News, 
New York.
