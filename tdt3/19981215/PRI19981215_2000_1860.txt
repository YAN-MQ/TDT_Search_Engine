The trial of two Libyans accused of bombing Pan Am Flight 103 appears 
closer tonight. The Libyan People's Congress says it will allow the 
trial in a neutral country. Two-hundred-and-seventy people died in 
the blast ten years ago over Lockerbie, Scotland. The BBC's Barnaby 
Mason reports on the Libyan statement. The Congress expressed satisfaction 
of what it called the agreement between the Libyan, British, and American 
parties which it said constituted the fundamental basis for settling 
the issue. The resolution called on all three parties to remove any 
obstacle that prevented the trial taking place as soon as possible. 
Barnaby Mason reporting. Washington, for its part, says the time for 
rhetoric is over. State Department spokesman James Foley says the 
question is whether the suspects are transferred to the Netherlands 
quickly or not.
