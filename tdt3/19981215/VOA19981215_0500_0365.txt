The Middle East peace process grinds on today. Meetings between the 
U.S. president, Israeli, and Palestinian leaders led to no immediate 
breakthroughs when they adjourned just over an hour ago. But President 
Clinton expressed optimism that the parties can still resolve their 
disagreements. The two sides are meeting throughout the day, and the 
U.S. leader is optimistic they can find common ground. Talking to 
reporters after the meeting, Mr. Clinton pointed out that the security 
issues remain among the most important to be resolved. The Tuesday 
trilateral meeting also led to an agreement for the formation of committees 
that will be working on other issues such as education. Here is President 
Clinton. I talked about this in my speech in Gaza yesterday, the importance 
of teaching the children that a commitment has been made by these 
two people to be partners and to share this land together. It's a 
very important issue to the Israelis, and one I think that the Palestinians 
recognize. Second, the economic committee, which is very important, 
and thirdly, one big issue that has been agreed to but the details 
haven't been worked out is the whole question of safe passage. And 
there is a committee on safe passage, and I expect it to meet, if 
not today, then very shortly to continue to push forward on that. 
But Mr. Clinton is expressing optimism. Israel and the Palestinians 
sharply disagree over the next Israeli troop pullout from the West 
Bank, which is due Friday. Israel has said it may suspend the withdrawal 
until the Palestinians renounce plans to divide Jerusalem and unilaterally 
declare statehood next May.
