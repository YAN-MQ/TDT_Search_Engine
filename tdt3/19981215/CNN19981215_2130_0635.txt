If books are on your list of holiday gifts, you might want to consider 
buying just one. It might revolutionize the way we read. Rick Lockridge 
reports. What a novel idea -- the electronic book! Two of them are 
now on the market, and they are ready to help you work as well as 
play. Actually, what's funny is that I thought of something like this 
today when i was at the library. "Why couldn't they just have something 
I could just read, all the books on one thing?" Okay, here you go. 
The $500 rocket E-book is about the size of a small paperback and 
can hold half a dozen novels in its memory, plus your company's annual 
report. So could the $300 softbook. Here's how the E-books work -- 
you download digital book files from the internet. It's pretty speedy, 
about 100 pages a minute. Thousands of titles are already available 
at about $5 to $25 apiece. Once you've downloaded that "book," you 
turn the "pages" with a button click. Built-in tools like the rocket 
E-book's dictionary and the softbook's "Find" button come in handy. 
You're reading a Clancy novel and there's 5,700 characters, and you 
run into some Russian general, you just tap on his name and find "previous," 
you can find when this character was introduced. Both E-books come 
with sharp liquid-Crystal displays, back-lit for night reading. You 
can increase the size of the typeface, too. Perfectly wonderful. Large 
print. I like it. There's just one thing -- overcoming a 1,500-year-long 
habit of reading ink on paper. A move that might not be so easy for 
some people to make. But then again, I'm an old lady. So, you know, 
I think about things differently than young folks. I like people coming 
into my house and seeing a library and saying, "man, that guy's pretty 
wise, he's got a big library!" But it's possible that some of today's 
children may grow up to own only one book, and yet have a bigger library 
than any of us. Rick Lockridge, CNN, Atlanta.
