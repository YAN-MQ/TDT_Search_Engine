European researchers say sunscreen may actually increase the risk 
of developing skin cancer. They conducted a survey of 631 children 
and found those who used sunscreen most often were the ones with the 
more cancer-predicting moles. But don't put away the sunblock yet. 
Researchers say it's probably the result of people thinking they can 
stay in the sun longer because they're using sunscreen. Researchers 
say sunscreen, protective clothing and less exposure are the best 
things against skin cancer.
