President Clinton wraps up his trip to the mideast and heads back 
to the job of trying to save his presidency. The political tide appears 
to be turning against the president as more republicans decide on 
impeachment. And two traditional enemies work together to preserve 
forests in the northeast. "CNN Headline News." I'm Chuck Roberts in 
Atlanta. We're live. Thanks for joining us.
