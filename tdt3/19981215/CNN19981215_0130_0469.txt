The Supreme Court has agreed to hear a case about whether federal 
law requires some mentally disabled people to be placed in community-based 
programs rather than state mental facilities. A lower court ruling 
says officials in Georgia discriminated against two people by confining 
them to a state mental facility. Georgia's appeal to the Supreme Court 
is supported by 22 other states who say the Americans with disabilities 
act does not require community placement if appropriate treatment 
is available at the state level.
