Civil liberties groups aren't happy about the New York City police 
department's latest proposal. In addition to fingerprints, the department 
wants to take DNA samples from anyone who's arrested. New York's commissioner 
says the samples would help solve crimes, crack down on repeat offenders 
and even help clear innocent people. DNA testing can be accomplished 
with minimum intrusion into personal privacy. A simple, sterile swab 
placed briefly in the mouth to collect saliva is all that is needed. 
Arguably, the process presently used by most police departments to 
obtain fingerprints, which requires placing ink on the person's hands, 
is more inconvenient to the arrested person than the taking of the 
sterile swab. When you have fingerprint information, it's used exclusively 
for identification matching purposes for law enforcement. The DNA 
does that, but it does so much more. They will get your genetic makeup. 
They will have information that they don't have any legitimate interest 
in having with regard to law enforcement. That's our major concern. 
The plan would have to be approved by the state legislature to be 
implemented.
