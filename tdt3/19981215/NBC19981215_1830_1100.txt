Still ahead tonight -- the news of 1998. Counting down the most interesting 
moments of 1998. And the high cost of saying merry Christmas -- why 
are so many toys suddenly so expensive? For the holidays, I want everything 
to smell as clean as it looks, even the couch. Well, now you can get 
bad smells out of fabrics... for good with febreze. It's even safe 
on suits. These don't get smells out of fabrics like febreze. Right. 
Febreze actually gets smells out, doesn't just cover 'em up. And all 
you do is spray. Once it's dry, smell's gone for good. Happy holidays! 
These days, everything's faster. Everything. So how come pain relief 
isn't faster? Introducing Advil liqui-gels-- on tough pain, they're 
stronger and faster than extra strength Tylenol. New Advil liqui-gels. 
Stronger and faster. Bacon! Bacon! Where's the bacon? I smell bacon! 
Bacon! Bacon! Gotta be bacon! Only one thing smells like bacon! That's 
bacon! Bacon, bacon, bacon, bacon! There! In that bag! What's it say? 
I can't read! Please, please give me what's in the bag! Chewy, yummy, 
smoky bacon! Here you go! Oh boy, oh boy, oh boy, oh boy! It's bacon! 
No, it's beggin' strips brand dog snack from Purina! Beggin strips... 
it's bacon! Teddy gibbs tou hs it out through the raw soar throat, 
the hacking cough, the fever. Now he needs... maximum strength theraflu.
