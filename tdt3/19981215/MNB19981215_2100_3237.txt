There's a down side to that but also a positive side to that in that 
generally government is conducted in the sunshine. Sto, this one could 
have a positive side also. To show we have a sense of humor and that 
popular culture can make news, the "Seinfeld" final episode and the 
decision that made it the final episode. I had a tear in my eye with 
the "Seinfeld" final episode. In many ways, it may be more important 
to people that there are no new "Seinfelds" than this stuff going 
on in Washington. It inspired people. It made them laugh. Those kinds 
of things are important, and I'm sad to see it go. The various broadcasts 
of NBC news will be doing a series of special reports on what make 
up the list of the most interesting moments of the year just beyond. 
The list is available for view at MSNBC.com. from American University 
across town, thanks Alan. Thank you, Brian.
