The midwestern dust bowl of the 1930s is considered the worst drought 
of the century. Now scientists say future dry spells could be much 
worse. According to a government study released today, severe megadroughts 
occurred in the 13th and 16th centuries far more severe than the eight-year 
dust bowl. Researchers reviewed historical documents and studied tree 
rings and other environmental clues to get their information. The 
scientists say they still don't know what caused the megadroughts 
or how to predict them. But they say global warming may increase the 
chances of having one.
