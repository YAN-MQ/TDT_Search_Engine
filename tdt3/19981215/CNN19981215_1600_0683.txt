The crew of space shuttle "endeavour" is preparing to return to earth 
today. "Endeavour" is scheduled to land at Kennedy space center in 
Florida at 10:56 P.M. eastern time, but NASA says bad weather may 
force a landing tomorrow, possibly at Edwards air force base in California. 
During three days of space walks, the crew of "endeavour" successfully 
assembled the first two parts of the $60 billion international space 
station.
