CNN has learned President Clinton is being told he must take dramatic 
action to win a house vote on impeachment. Sources in both parties 
say in a proposed censure plan, the president would admit lying to 
the American people about the Monica Lewinsky matter and admit to 
lying under oath in the Paula Jones sexual harassment case. He would 
agree to pay a stiff financial penalty -- possibly $2 million or more, 
and leave himself open to potential prosecution after he leaves office 
by promising not to accept a presidential pardon.
