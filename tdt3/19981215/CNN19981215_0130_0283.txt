President Clinton has added a three-way summit to his visit to the 
Middle East. He's meeting Tuesday morning with Israeli prime minister 
Benjamin Netanyahu and Palestinian authority President Yasser Arafat 
at a border between Gaza and Israel. Monday, Mr. Clinton became the 
first U.S. president to visit Gaza. He watched as the Palestine national 
council voted to annul parts of its charter which had called for the 
destruction of Israel. Mr. Clinton praised the outcome. I thank you 
for your rejection fully, finally and forever of the passages in the 
Palestinian charter calling for the destruction of Israel, for they 
were the ideological underpinnings of a struggle renounced at Oslo 
by revoking them once and for all. And I say again, you have sent 
a powerful message not to the government, but to the people of Israel. 
You will touch people on the street there. You will reach their hearts 
there.
