Another controversy that has dogged the Clinton administration and 
the Democratic Party has been allegations of illegal campaign contributions. 
A judge in California has sentenced former Democratic Party fund-raiser 
Johnny Chung to five years probation for illegal contributions to 
the Democratic National Committee. VOA's Mike O'Sullivan reports. 
Johnny Chung was one of several Chinese-Americans indicted on charges 
of making or arranging contributions to Democratic Party campaigns 
in violation of U.S. election laws. The Los Angeles businessman admitted 
in March that he made an illegal $20,000 contribution to the 1996 
Clinton/Gore reelection campaign. He also admitted making an illegal 
$8,000 contribution to the campaign of Democratic Senator John Kerry 
of Massachusetts and to fraudulently obtaining a loan for his California 
home. Between 1994 and 1996, Chung donated nearly $400,000 to the 
Democratic Party. The money was returned after questions were raised 
about its legality. Chung admitted that he funneled the contributions 
through what are called straw donors to conceal the source of the 
funds. But U.S. District Court judge Manuel Rayel expressed skepticism 
at a letter from the Democratic National Committee which claimed that 
Chung concealed the source of the contributions from party officials. 
The fund-raiser could have faced up to 34 years in prison. Prosecutors 
recommended probation because they said he cooperated with their two-year 
investigation of illegal political fund-raising. Outside the courtroom, 
Johnny Chung expressed relief. I'm very tired, but thankful it is 
over. Johnny Chung's lawyer said he was pleased with the outcome of 
the case and called the sentence fair. Mike O'Sullivan, VOA News, 
Los Angeles.
