Well, after an emergency meeting in Bangkok, Thailand, Asian Football 
Officials have put a threatened boycott of the 2002 World Cup on hold, 
but Asian Footbal Confederation's executive committee warned on Tuesday 
that the boycott would proceed unless Football's world governing body 
expands the number of slots allocated to Asia for the World Cup. The 
committee also decided that if the boycott moves forward, co-hosts 
Japan and South Korea would be exempt. Confederation General Secretary 
Peter Valipan told a news conference Tuesday that the members are 
in favor of the boycott but that the confederation will honor the 
responsibility of hosting the World Cup. The confederation is upset 
that FEFA has cut the number of Asian births in the finals to just 
two, in addition to the slots given to Japan and South Korea automatically 
as the hosts.
