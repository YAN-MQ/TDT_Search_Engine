Iran says police have arrested their first suspects in a string of 
murders of dissidents that has unnerved intellectuals opposed to hard-liners 
in the ruling clergy. A judiciary spokesman says police have arrested 
a number of suspects linked to the killings of three writers and two 
opposition politicians. State spokesman James Foley condemned the 
killings saying they appear to be attempts to stifle dissent. These 
incidents have begun to add up and point to a pattern of violence 
and intimidation against those who perhaps differ from the views of 
the authorities or those who merely express themselves, be they poets 
or intellectuals or political figures. And this trend certainly feels 
counter to the promise and the opening that was evoked during the 
election - upon the election of President Katami. Earlier Monday, 
the attacks were condemned by Iran's supreme leader, Ayatollah Ali 
Khamenei and President Mohammad Khatami.
