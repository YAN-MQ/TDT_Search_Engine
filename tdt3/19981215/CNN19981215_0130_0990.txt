Toymaker Mattel is reporting huge revenue losses for 1998. As Casey 
wian reports, the company is hoping a major acquisition will help 
it get back on top. There's no merry Christmas at Mattel, now that 
the company says its 1998 revenue will fall $500,000 short of earlier 
expectations. Profit will drop by about one-third. Mattel blames the 
bombshell on a decision by retailers to reduce inventories. For example, 
top customer toys "R" us, which itself is struggling financially, 
has slashed its stock of Mattel products in half this year. It's all 
part of the toy industry's ongoing conversion to just-in-time inventory 
management. "Just in time" means that they will not bring product 
in or pay for product until they absolutely need it. Since perhaps 
40% of toy products are sold in October, November and december, it 
means that inventories will stay at the manufacturer or not be ordered 
or paid for until they absolutely need that product for the consumer. 
Some analysts are skeptical that just in time will work for toy retailers 
since hot toys are often hard to predict. Others say Mattel should 
have seen the industry shift coming much earlier. Mattel also announced 
a $3.8 billion buyout of software manufacturer the learning company. 
Analysts view the deal as a belated admission that Mattel can no longer 
rely on its traditional Barbie and hot wheels product mix. I think 
Mattel has realized that American consumers are increasingly interested 
in software and may be decreasingly interested in traditional toys. 
And so in order to continue its growth, it needs to look outside of 
the traditional toy industry. The learning company will make Mattel 
the world's second largest consumer software company behind Microsoft. 
But Wall Street is losing patience. Mattel has lost more than half 
its stock market value since this spring. While Mattel says it has 
no immediate plans to lay off any of its 26,000 workers, CEO Jill 
barad told Wall Street analysts the company is closely monitoring 
its cost structure. And that often means job cuts. Casey wian, "CNN
