Chief U.N. arms inspector Richard Butler reports today on Iraqi cooperation 
since the end of its last crisis with the United Nations in mid-November. 
Mr. Butler will give his report to U.N. Secretary General Kofi Annan, 
who on Monday warned a military conflict unless Iraq completes its 
disarmament obligations. Also Monday, many U.N. arms inspectors left 
Iraq after wrapping up a week of surprise searches for banned weapons. 
Despite Iraq's pledge to cooperate. U.N. officials say Iraq denied 
access to a second suspected weapons site.
