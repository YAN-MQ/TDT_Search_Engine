United Nations Secretary-General Kofi Annan has warned the U.N. may 
reconsider its operations in Angola if the fighting there continues. 
Violence between UNITA rebels and the government forces has escalated 
in the last two weeks. Mark Orchard has more. The recent upsurge in 
fighting between Angolan government forces and fighters loyal to the 
UNITA leadership has in the last two weeks effectively returned parts 
of Angola to a state of civil war. The latest fighting started two 
weeks ago when government forces made an unsuccessful attempt to dislodge 
UNITA from its strongholds. In the last few days, the United Nations 
has begun withdrawing humanitarian staff from the affected areas. 
And speaking on Monday, the U.N. Secretary-General Kofi Annan, said 
his organization didn't have enough staff in the country to do much 
about the fighting. The BBC's Mark Orchard reporting. UNITA rebels 
say they're ready to talk to the government if the Army stops an offensive 
against UNITA-held areas.
