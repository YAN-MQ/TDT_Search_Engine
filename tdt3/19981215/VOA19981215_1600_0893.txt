The Association of Southeast Asian Nations or ASEAN continues its 
summit meeting in Vietnam on Wednesday. Leaders of the nine nation 
group will also hold talks with their dialogue partners from South 
Korea, Japan, and China. VOA correspondent Gary Thomas reports from 
Hanoi. Heads of ASEAN nations will finalize and sign their blueprint 
for dealing with the crippling Asian financial crisis Wednesday, then 
meet with their counterparts from North Asia. A few concrete details 
emerged of the plans except that they are expected to concentrate 
on accelerating free trade and enhancing cooperation brief comments 
as he was leaving the afternoon meeting. Singaporean Prime Minister 
Goh Chok Tong described the talks as very good. We had several technical 
ideas. They are not all big ideas. There was some small ideas, such 
as technical ideas, which should allow ASEAN countries to be more 
unified. Mr. Goh had been the most outspoken of the ASEAN leaders 
in his opening speech Tuesday saying that ASEAN is facing a grave 
test of credibility. He said that in the current financial crisis, 
ASEAN has to prove that its self-image as a dynamic regional organization 
is grounded in reality. Thailand's Syran Pitouan says the sense of 
shared crisis among the leaders is greater than it was at last December's 
informal ASEAN summit when the Asian financial crisis was still only 
about six months old. I think this is a very big step from Kuala Lumpur 
last December when the has an informal meeting. Nine of them plus 
three countries the same, but the consciousness, the awareness of 
the fact that we are in it together, we have to get out of this together, 
and we have to work together. Solidarity and unity is essential for 
the recovery of the economy in the region. I think that consciousness, 
that awareness have been very much graced or heightened from last 
year. ASEAN's concerns will be further shared with their dialogue 
partners of China, Japan, and South Korea Wednesday. Leaders are particularly 
interested to hear Japan's proposal for a regional fund to help ailing 
nations' economies. Gary Thomas, VOA News, Hanoi.
