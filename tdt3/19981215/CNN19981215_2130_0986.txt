Citigroup says it is cutting 10,400 jobs. It's part of a restructuring 
that will cost the financial services company $900 million. The company 
is attempting to consolidate operations of Citicorp and the travelers 
group, which merged in October. Citigroup also plans to cut expenses 
by limiting travel and the use of outside consultants.
