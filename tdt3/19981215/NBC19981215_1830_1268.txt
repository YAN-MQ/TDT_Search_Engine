Back in this country, just in time for the holidays, sticker shock 
in america's toy stores. Why is it that so many of the play things 
kids want this holiday season have such high price tags? More from 
Jim Avila. Santa will need deep pockets this year. Five of the country's 
top 20 toys have price tags above $100. Do you want to ask Santa for 
some toys? I like some action figures. 1998's most expensive Christmas 
toys talk. Accelerate beneath a 4-year-old's foot. Wear dresses created 
by designer to the stars Bob mackie. A Barbie. The $100 price barrier 
is shattered. I think we're seeing more and more of it this year. 
And I expect to see more of it in the future, just because I think 
toys are becoming more high tech and more interactive. Fun and games 
are big business. The average American parent spends $350 per child 
per year on toys. Most of it is spent this month. Every year half 
the $23 billion in toy sales are at Christmas. And this year, 10%, 
more than $2 billion is for big-ticket items. Fisher-price is a veteran 
in the risky business of marketing high-end toys. There has to be 
a tremendous amount of excitement about the item to drive that kind 
of price point. Their designers built two of the best-selling, high-priced 
toys on the market, both cars at around $200 each. I would say it's 
almost totally an emotive purchase when you get to these prices. Lets 
face it. There aren't many logical reasons for somebody to buy a $100 
toy for their child. Debbie and Tom kost spent nearly $1,000 on their 
two children this Christmas. I generally put my foot down when gifts 
get too expensive. And many psychologists say expensive toys can actually 
be bad for a child. Bought by parents pressured to buy big out of 
guilt. The danger is we're raising a society of children who, as adults, 
will look to objects for their satisfaction and fulfillment and as 
a result will be perpetually dissatisfied and unfulfilled. With 10 
days left until Christmas, a toy crisis for American parents who, 
in the 90's, have more money than time. Jim Avila, NBC news, Chicago.
