This look at your "CNN Headline News Weather" begins with our forecast 
weather map for Wednesday morning. An area of low pressure is developing 
off the southeastern coast. A little bit of rainfall in the coastal 
areas here, but nothing of any great significance is expected. Cold 
front continues to push through the east, relatively dry. Another 
cold front slides down through the upper midwest and northern plains 
states, bringing to an end the record-setting warm temperatures of 
recent days. Much of the west will be dry. Take a look at your forecast 
for high temperatures, and you can see 20s and 30s in the Great Lakes 
area and the New England states. But relatively mild throughout much 
of the nation. In your extended forecast, on Thursday, snow is possible 
in the Great Lakes area. As we move on into Friday, you can see the 
snow showers in the Great Lakes and in the northern Rockies, too. 
And as we head on into the weekend, on Saturday, temperatures are 
cooler in the northern tier of the nation. Snow showers are possible 
in the New England states. A few showers are possible along the Texas 
gulf coast and in the northwest. For more weather information, log
