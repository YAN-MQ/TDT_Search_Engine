The international Olympic committee member who uncorked the biggest 
scandal in the group's history is urging his colleagues to work for 
honesty. Marc hodler says the last three days have been the worst 
in his sports career. Brian Cabell has more on the controversy. Marc 
hodler, the longest serving member of the international olympic committee 
set off the controversy when he charged that some IOC colleagues were 
open to bribery when it came to selecting Olympic cities. He pointed 
to the Salt Lake City Olympics scheduled for 2002 as an example. Salt 
lake Olympic organizers confirm they set up a $400,000 scholarship 
program to aid 13 individuals, including six relatives of IOC members. 
I apologize to the Olympic family and to the citizens of Utah for 
the embarrassment caused by the bid committee program. But hodler 
doesn't blame the city. For us, Salt Lake City was a victim of blackmail, 
and not a villain. The villains, he claims, are what he calls "agents" 
-- those who claim they can buy IOC members' votes and the IOC members 
themselves. The city of salt lake -- The allegations of vote-buying 
have put a damper on the planning for the salt lake Olympics. Even 
the state legislature is talking about investigating the Olympic bid. 
Hodler also claims that three other Olympic cities, including Nagano, 
japan, Sydney, Australia, and Atlanta, Georgia, may have benefited 
from vote-buying. The denials from city organizers and IOC members 
were adamant. To my knowledge, we were never approached. And had we 
been approached, we would have said categorically no. We were never 
involved in any bribe involvements or corruption. No one ever approached 
me. I don't know any of my colleagues who were. IOC President Juan 
Antonio samaranch says, in fact, Nagano, sydney and Atlanta are not 
now under investigation. We are only facts regarding the Salt Lake 
City. We are investigating only Salt Lake City. Samaranch also promised 
to kick out any of his fellow IOC members who may have accepted bribes. 
As for the Salt Lake City Olympics themselves, they will proceed, 
according to samaranch, while the IOC investigates itself for corruption.
