The president has publicly appealed to Republicans and the U.S. House 
of Representatives to find a compromise to end the looming crisis 
over an impeachment vote expected Thursday. Mr. Clinton said he is 
ready to reach any reasonable compromise to head off impeachment for 
his alleged wrongdoings in the Monica Lewinsky inquiry. The White 
House is reported to be as many as ten votes short of defeating the 
impeachment motion, with about two dozen House Republicans said to 
be undecided.
