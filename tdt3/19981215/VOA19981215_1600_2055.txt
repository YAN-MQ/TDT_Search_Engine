Libyan television says parliament has expressed qualified satisfaction 
that a plan to put two Libyan Lockerbie bombing suspects on trial 
in the Netherlands. But Tuesday's reported statement by parliament 
did not actually approve the plan. It did urge Britain and the United 
States to remove obstacles blocking the handover of the suspects but 
did not say what the obstacles are. U.N. Secretary General Kofi Annan 
says he is encouraged. The United States says it's still trying to 
determine what the Libyan statement means.
