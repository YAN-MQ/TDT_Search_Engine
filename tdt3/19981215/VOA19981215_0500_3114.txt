Royal Dutch Shell, the world's biggest publicly traded oil company, 
will slash investment and write off nearly $5 billion of assets from 
refineries to chemical plants as a result of a 40 percent drop in 
oil prices. Shell hopes to save about $2.5 billion a year by 2001. 
Substantial job cuts will be part of the retrenchment. Analyst Fidel 
Gate of Fonstock and Company insists it's not enough. This is company 
that has $120 billion in assets. That when you see $4.5 billion write 
off, that is less than three percent of the total assets. So that 
is a very small proportion of the assets, and I do believe we have 
a lot more of assets. So the most logical way of write off would be 
in an order of magnitude of ten percent not three percent. Shell stock 
was lower Monday with investor disappointment that Shell's been unable 
to announce a major bid for rival Chevron, Texaco, or Conoco, all 
of which have been reportedly mentioned as Shell suitors.
