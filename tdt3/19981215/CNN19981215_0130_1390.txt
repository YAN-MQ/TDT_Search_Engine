For the Energizer doublebarrel flashlight-- unique double barrel design 
that extends battery life combined with a halogen xenon bulb, Burns 
brighter, for longer than any light in its class. Energizer doublebarrel. 
One barrel brighter. One barrel better. The average workday lasts 
longer than a few hours. But the average pain reliever may work a 
few hours then quit. Aleve works all day with just two pills. It would 
take eight Tylenol to do that. Two pills, all day relief. Works for 
me.
