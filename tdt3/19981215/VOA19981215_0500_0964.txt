The U.S. Space Shuttle Endeavour is preparing to return to Earth later 
today after a 12-day flight in which the first components of an international 
space station were assembled. Endeavour commander Robert Cabana said 
Monday the mission went so well, there is a sense of unreality about 
it. The main achievement of the flight was the assembly of the first 
block of the International Space Station, which will serve as a research 
laboratory for 16 nations ultimately. Endeavour astronauts engaged 
in three space walks to get the station operational. The space station 
partners will spend the next five years completing the project which 
will require dozens of additional space flights.
