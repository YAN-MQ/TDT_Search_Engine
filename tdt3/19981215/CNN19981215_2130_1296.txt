Jerome Jurenovich, "CNN Headline Sports." By a 7-1 vote, the NFL competition 
committee has decided not to bring back instant replay for this year's 
playoffs. The vote has no impact on whether or not replay will return 
for next season. Six of the eight members actually favor reinstating 
it next year.
