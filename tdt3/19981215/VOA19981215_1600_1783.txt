It's 2130 universal time, and this is VOA News Now. President Clinton 
says he did what he set out to do during his visit to Israel and the 
Palestinian autonomous area. Several more moderate Republicans in 
the U.S. House of Representatives now say they will vote in favor 
of the impeachment of President Clinton. And on Dateline, dealing 
with another aspect of the Nazi Holocaust. It's all in this half hour 
of VOA News Now. First, here's a summary of world news. I'm Robert 
Burns, VOA News.
