Pat Dawson in Norwalk, Connecticut. Thanks, Pat. Much more ahead as 
we continue. We'll look at the mood in the Senate and the task ahead. 
Ll, when I think... about not being able to see, it's overwhelming. 
I went to the doctor at Lenscrafters... for a regular eye exam. He 
thought he saw a problem. Working with Lenscrafters, I have everything 
I need to give an accurate prescription. But with Elaine, something 
strange showed up. I checked her for glaucoma. I did have the earliest 
stages of glaucoma. I was able to catch something... before it was 
really going to start to affect her life. He helped save my eyesight.
