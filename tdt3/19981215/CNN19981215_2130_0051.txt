The U.N. chief weapons inspector has filed a report from the U.N. 
on the state of Iraq's client with U.N. weapons inspectors. Richard 
Roth is in New York with the story. More details coming in on a report 
prepared for the U.N. security council by Richard Butler. Mr. Butler 
concludes in his report that there has been far short of compliance 
by Iraq for his inspectors in the field. This is important because 
it could set the launching point for possible U.S. military action. 
In the report, Butler says Iraq's conduct ensured that no progress 
was able to be made in the fields of disarmament or accounting for 
Iraq's prohibited weapons. Iraq has blocked the inspectors several 
times.
