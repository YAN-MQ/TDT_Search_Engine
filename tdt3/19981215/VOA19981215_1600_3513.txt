It's almost 22 hours universal time, and it means we're closing down 
all frequencies to the Middle East, North Africa, and Europe, except 
for 1548 kilohertz medium wave to the Persian Gulf region. In Europe, 
during the next hour, VOA News Now can be heard on WRN1 via astra, 
channel 22, audio subcarrier 7.38 megahertz.
