And if you're headed to Paris, you will certainly be relieved to know 
that the Louvre is opening again. It's going to be reopening to the 
public on Wednesday. This famous world class museum was closed for 
nearly a week because of a strike by workers who want more pay and 
vacation time. According to Louvre officials, the strike turned away 
60,000 visitors, cost the museum more than $700,000 for just being 
closed almost a week. Museum employees agreed to end the walkout on 
Monday when management promised them an annual bonus increase up to 
$360, plus an additional two days off a year. The Louvre houses an 
extensive art collection including Leonardo DaVinci's Mona Lisa. You 
almost said Leonardo DiCaprio, didn't you. No, that wasn't it. Just 
didn't come out quite right that time, Paul. Well, you know, Leonardo 
DiCaprio, that's fine.
