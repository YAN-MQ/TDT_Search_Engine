U.S. Balkan envoy Richard Holbrooke says progress toward a political 
settlement in Serbia's Kosovo province is essential if there is to 
be a halt to the violence in the region. The envoy spoke to journalists 
from Belgrade's independent media before meeting with Yugoslavia President 
Slobodan Milosevic. Earlier in Pristina, he told both sides they're 
playing with dynamite if they continue violence. Meanwhile, journalists 
are reporting new shelling near the Yugoslav-Albanian border. At least 
42 people were killed in clashes on Monday.
