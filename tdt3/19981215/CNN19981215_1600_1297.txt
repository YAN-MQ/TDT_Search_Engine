I'm Dave cera, and this is "CNN Headline Sports." Wisconsin fans can 
breathe a Sigh of relief. Ron dayne, the badgers' all-time leading 
rusher, has told a Wisconsin paper he will remain for his senior season 
and forgo the NFL draft. With nearly 5,000 career rushing yards, dayne 
could challenge heisman trophy winner Ricky Williams' division I record 
of 6,279 yards. Speaking of Ricky Williams, the Texas rangers have 
offered $100,000 cash to the Montreal Expos for the rights to the 
heisman trophy winner in the event he should decide to play baseball.
