In New York, U.S. stocks reopened today at 8695 after a fifth straight 
session loss, this time over 1.4 percent on the benchmark Dow Jones 
Industrial Average. Lingering concerns over corporate profits, the 
global economic situation, and a pending impeachment vote of President 
Clinton sent investors to sell. The Dow shed over 126 points.
