The European Union holds its annual summit talks with the United States 
on Friday, but as Ron Pemstien reports from Brussels, the issue of 
the European Union's banana import policy or regime and American dissatisfaction 
with it may overshadow the summit. The European Union contends it 
has made ten changes to the way it imports bananas. The United States 
says those adjustments are only cosmetic and do not change the bias 
in the European system that favors African and Caribbean bananas rather 
than South American bananas marketed by U.S. companies. The European 
Union wants to let the World Trade Organization handle the banana 
dispute. American trade officials say they trade procedure takes too 
long, and there is no assurance the European Union will comply with 
an adverse ruling anyway. The United States is threatening to impose 
100 percent tariffs on a number of European industries by next March 
unless the European Union changes its banana import regime. Leon Britten, 
the European commissioner in charge of trade, says bananas threaten 
the wider American European agenda. Mr. Britten offers to bring the 
banana dispute to the World Trade Organization for a decision even 
if the United States does not want to make its own complaint to the 
WTO. If the United States proceeds with punitive tariffs against Europe 
anyway, the European Union intends to challenge the legal basis of 
the American trade legislation within the WTO. Please, I beg the United 
States get back a sense of proportion. Let's look at this comparatively 
minor dispute in the context of the far more important interests we 
both have in working together to advance our own prosperity and improve 
our trade relations, to straight from the system, and to address the 
wider problems in the world. Mr. Britten will accompany European Commission 
President Jacques Santair to Washington to meet with President Clinton 
in the hope they can discuss topics other than bananas. Ron Pemstein, 
VOA News, Brussels.
