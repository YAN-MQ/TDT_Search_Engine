President Clinton says he achieved what he set out to achieve during 
his visit to Israel and the Palestinian autonomous areas. VOA's Debra 
Tate reports from Jerusalem on the president's trip. Mr. Clinton says 
the Middle East peace process is back on track as a result of his 
trip saying the parties have resumed their talks. He spoke after holding 
a joint meeting with Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu and 
Palestinian leader Yasir Arafat at an Israeli checkpoint on the border 
with Gaza. I have achieved what I came here to achieve. But Mr. Clinton 
acknowledged he did not receive assurances from Mr. Netanyahu that 
he would follow through on a troop withdrawal from another five percent 
of the West Bank as scheduled on Friday. Mr. Netanyahu wants the Palestinians 
to do more to curtail violence before agreeing to another West Bank 
pullout. The Palestinians in turn want Israel to release more political 
prisoners. Joint committees are working to resolve these issues to 
allow talks aimed at a final settlement to move forward. Debra Tate, 
VOA News, Jerusalem.
