President Clinton says the Middle East peace process is back on track 
but admits his talks with Israeli and Palestinian leaders did not 
result in any breakthroughs, speaking to reporters after talks with 
Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu and Palestinian leader Yasir 
Arafat. Mr. Clinton acknowledged that the talks failed to convince 
Israel to go ahead with its next troop pull out from the West Bank. 
We sat there, you know, for however long, an hour and 25 minutes today 
with all the parties in the room, including the major members of each 
side's team, as well as the leaders, and everybody had their say. 
And there was some - We got beyond the, you know, people stating their 
own positions to actual conversation, and I'm quite hopeful. I think, 
you know, the proof is always in what happens tomorrow not what happens 
today, but I think at least we got a process set up we can go forward. 
Mr. Clinton says a committee to set up to hear disputes between the 
two sides will try to resolve this and other issues. He also announced 
that Secretary of State Madeleine Albright will return to the region 
in several weeks.
