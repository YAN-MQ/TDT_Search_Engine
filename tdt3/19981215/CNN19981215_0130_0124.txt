Three more house republicans have made their intentions known. Frank 
LoBiondo of New Jersey, John Shimkus of Illinois and C.W. Bill young 
of Florida say they will vote for at least one article of impeachment. 
The three are moderates and had been targeted by the White House. 
Arkansas republican Jay Dickey is another moderate high on the White 
House list. Charles Zewe reports. Yeah, oh yeah, yeah. He's become 
an angry fence-sitter. Arkansas congressman Jay Dickey, one of a handful 
of republicans undecided on impeachment, is bristling over alleged 
White House pressure to vote no. For them to say, "we're going to 
turn this institution into a destroy Jay dickey if he votes wrong, 
if he votes against our wishes," is plain wrong. An unnamed White 
House aide reportedly told "the Arkansas democrat gazette" that it 
would be political suicide for Dickey to vote for impeachment because 
his district, which includes the president's hometown, is heavily 
democratic. They're assuming that everybody thinks the same way they 
think and that re-election and polls are the most important thing 
there is and that self-respect and integrity and things like that 
don't matter -- where it does matter. a Clinton spokesman says the 
comment does not reflect the White House view. Jay Dickey's office. 
This is sareetha. Dickey, meanwhile, is getting deluged with phone 
calls and letters about impeachment from across the United States. 
74% are against impeachment. He's also getting advice via the Internet. 
Dickey's office says it's received more than 7,000 pro-Clinton E-mails 
in the last few days generated by this web site. It's called, "censure 
and move on." The letter says Congress must immediately censure President 
Clinton and move onto pressing issues facing the country. Monday, 
he heard the same thing from Arkansas mayors meeting in pine bluff. 
And I personally hope that you come down on the side of not impeaching 
him. a group of them from his congressional district told him in a 
Heated private meeting they want him to vote no on impeachment. I 
don't think that we want to see a year of Senate trials and all that 
sort of thing over a matter that has nothing to do with government. 
Dickey says he won't make up his mind on impeachment until wednesday, 
when he returns to Washington. Charles Zewe, CNN, pine bluff, Arkansas.
