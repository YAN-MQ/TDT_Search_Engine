NATO's secretary general is urging Bosnian leaders to take greater 
responsibility for their country saying NATO forces cannot stay there 
forever. Abiyer Solanas says the 30,000 strong NATO-led force will 
continue to provide a secure environment for building a peaceful Bosnia 
in 1999. But he says the alliance could consider beginning to reduce 
its forces in Bosnia by the middle of next year.
