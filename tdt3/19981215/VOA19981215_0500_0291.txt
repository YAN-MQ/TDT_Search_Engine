U.S. Space Shuttle Endeavour is preparing to return to Earth today. 
Dave Mcalary has this report for VOA. The Endeavour crew was busy 
stowing equipment and checking out reentry and landing systems in 
preparation for a scheduled arrival in Florida early Wednesday universal 
time. U.S. space agency weather forecasters say there is a potential 
for low clouds and rain that could delay landing a day. Early Tuesday, 
universal time, the crew deployed an experimental U.S. military satellite 
made of composite materials being tested in space. But from comments 
Commander Bob Cabana made to reporters, it was clear he and his five 
shuttle colleagues were still basking in the glow of their success 
in mating the U.S. and Russian modules to form the foundation of the 
International Space Station. We kept pinching ourselves and saying, 
"It can't be real. It's going so well, and everything is so right, 
and it just looks so good." The space station is in its own orbit 
now awaiting the arrival of the next shuttle assembly team in May.
