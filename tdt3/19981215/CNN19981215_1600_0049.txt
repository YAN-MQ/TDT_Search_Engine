With support for impeachment growing in Congress, the White House 
says President Clinton is considering a "dramatic gesture" aimed at 
stemming the tide against him. It's not yet clear what that will be, 
but some aides are reportedly urging mr. Clinton to make an appearance 
on Capitol Hill to argue his case against impeachment. In a major 
setback for the White House, ten moderate republicans announced their 
stance on impeachment today. Representatives Fred Upton, Anne northup, 
John McHugh, Nancy Johnson and jerry Weller all say they will vote 
for at least one article of impeachment. Republicans Jack Quinn, Tom 
Campbell, Herbert Bateman, Michael Forbes and sue Kelly also favor 
impeachment. With a republican majority in the house, the White House 
needed to sway the moderate republicans to President Clinton's side. 
We've heard the phrase that it's just about sex. Well, every sexual 
harassment case is about sex. And to say that you were too important 
to tell the truth and that it was just about sex, so hence less important 
than any other civil lawsuit, is to belittle the seriousness with 
which sexual harassment should be treated in our society.
