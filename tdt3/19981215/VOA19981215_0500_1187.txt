The Carolina Panthers have suspended linebacker Kevin Greene for one 
game without pay after attacking an assistant coach on the sidelines 
during Sundays loss to the Washington Redskins. Greene became involved 
in a heated discussion of linebackers coach Kevin Steele after Washington 
scored touchdowns in their first three possessions. The suspension 
will cost Greene about $118,000 equal to one week's pay. Carolina 
head coach Don Caper says it's an unfortunate incident. During the 
heat of the moment in an emotional situation, Kevin lost his composure. 
I don't think there was anything other than that. And I've been on 
the sideline for many years and seen a lot of heated exchanges. It's 
just the nature of the game. It's an emotional game, and emotions 
run high. Caper says Greene and linebackers coach Kevin Steele just 
want to put the incident behind them and move on.
