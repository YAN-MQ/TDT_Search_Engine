There's an impeachment scoreboard in Washington, and it appears president 
clinton's opponents are taking the lead. The number of undecided house 
republicans has shrunk to about two dozen today. White House sources 
estimate Mr. Clinton must convince another six to nine republicans 
to vote "no" if he wants to avoid impeachment. More than a dozen GOP 
representatives announced they would vote for at least one of four 
impeachment articles presented last week by the house judiciary committee. 
One of them, California congressman Tom Campbell, says President Clinton 
intentionally did not tell the truth in a federal criminal investigation. 
The matter is serious. The matter is grave, but it is not complicated. 
The president of the United States, on several occasions with premeditation 
said what was not true, under oath, in a federal criminal grand jury 
with his attorney by his side, with the opportunity to stop the questioning 
at any time. If he would not tell the truth under those circumstances, 
I do not know when I can trust that he will tell the truth when it 
is to his political advantage not to. One of the undecided republicans 
is Christopher Shays of Connecticut, who was originally against impeachment. 
He held a town meeting in his home district of Norwalk this evening 
to learn how his constituents felt about the issue. Several hundred 
people crowded into the hall to share their opinions. Some of the 
speakers, including Shays, expressed doubts about independent counsel 
Ken Starr, who investigated the Monica Lewinsky matter. What troubled 
me about what judge Starr did is, two months before an election he 
came before the Congress with this report. And I have to tell you, 
I have a big problem with how the independent counsel is out of control, 
somehows how the press is out of control, how the White House is out 
of control. How Congress is out of control. But this independent counsel 
deciding he was going to Levy charges in a Sense against the president 
in the campaign season I believed, as a Republican, I believed he 
was trying to affect the election.
