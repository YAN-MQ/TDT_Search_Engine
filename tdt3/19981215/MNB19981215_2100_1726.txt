) Man: you can't control mother nature. Experts report that weather 
patterns are changing fast making it harder for anyone to say "A flood 
can't happen to me." That's what some fol thought in northern California. 
And so did many in North Dakota and Minnesota where the snow melted 
too fast. In fact, in the last few years, floods have hit all 50 states. 
Thousands of victims learned too late that homeowners' insurance doesn't 
cover floods. But national flood insurance does. It's the best way 
to recover from flood damage because you don't have to qualify for 
disaster relief or go into debt. Even weather experts can't outsmart 
mother nature. So call your insurance agent. Or for free infoation, 
call this number now. It takes 30 days before flood insurance goes 
into effect. Call this number today. The national flood insurance 
program.
