Guinea-Bissau's president and rebel leader, General Atsumi Manay have 
agreed to share power equally in the new government of National Unity. 
In Togo Tuesday, they announced the interim Prime Minister Francisco 
Fadul, an ally of the rebels, will head the government. Supporters 
of the president are to head the foreign and justice ministries when 
the rebels will govern the defense and economics ministries. The government 
of National Unity is to guide the country to elections in March.
