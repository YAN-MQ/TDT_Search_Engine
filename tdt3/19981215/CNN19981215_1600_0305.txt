The first family dropped in on some popular tourist sites. The Clintons 
visited Bethlehem with Yasser Arafat and his family. Among the stops, 
the church of nativity, a fourth century basilica on manger square. 
The Clintons were also treated to a performance by a Palestinian children's 
choir. President Clinton joined the choir in song, placed ornaments 
on a tree, and later departed for masada. The ancient desert fortress 
is where Jews fought the Romans. Masada is considered an Israeli symbol 
of courage in the face of adversity.
