Some moderate republicans, as we've been saying, have said the president 
could win them over if he would just admit he lied to the grand jury 
and to lawyers for Paula Jones. So, why doesn't he? As Pete wililams 
explains, it is not that simple. For legal, political, and personal 
reasons,his would not be an easy option for the president to change 
his story now and say that he did lie under oath. The first problem 
-- legal jeopardy. He'd be making a direct admission of a crime, and 
that would be the most damaging evidence in a criminal case. And Ken 
Starr could always prosecute the president later for perjury. But 
suppose congressional leaders agree to lobby Starr not to prosecute. 
What then? The president, says a former prosecutor, now a defens lawyer, 
should never make any admission in hopings of getting a deal. Confession 
may be good for the soul, but if President Clinton admitted to lying 
to the grand jury grand jury, he would make himself extremely vulnerable 
to an extremely aggressive prosecutor. The second problem with an 
admission -- political danger. Some members of Congress warn that 
such a change in his story now couldackfire. A leading political analyst 
says if the president declares he did commit perjury, it could cost 
him more votes in the house than he could gain. A lot of people remaining 
in the Clinton camp are doing so by saying it wasn't perblingry, that 
he may have lied about having an affair, but it wasn't perjury. And 
a third problem, an admission would be personally difficult for the 
president because his harshest critics say, he has trouble with the 
truth, whether it's about this affair -- I did not have sexual relations 
-- -- Or about inhaling mare wa that or avoiding the Vietnam draft. 
And while defenders insist his testimony was truthful, a psychologistho 
studies lying said there's only one word for statements so calculated 
to mislead the public. He says something that's designed to lead us 
to believe that nothing inappropriate happened, which to me is a lie. 
And the biggest problem of all for the president in saying he lied, 
maybe he doesn't believe he did.
