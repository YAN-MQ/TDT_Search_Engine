It's being called the tearful tirade in Tampa. Kordell Stewart not 
only has failed to lead the steelers out of a slide which has seen 
the team lose four of five, but his tearful and finger-pointing argument 
with head coach Bill cowher after being benched now has his leadership 
being questioned along with his play on the field. What he did was 
flat wrong, and he knows it. I discussed it with him yesterday. And 
right now he's not playing very good football. And until he starts 
playing good, consistent football, I will continue to do what I think 
is in the best interest of this team. And you know, he's going to 
have to deal with that. That's part of maturing. That's part of accepting 
the responsibilities that go with the position that he plays.
