Thank you, Victor. The chief executive of England's Football Association 
has resigned in the latest potential bribery scandal to hit the world 
of sports. Graham Kelly's resignation on Tuesday night follows FA 
Chairman Keith Weisman's alleged promise of a $5.4 million loan to 
the Wales Football Association. In return, the Welsh FA was to vote 
to put an English official on the executive committees of both the 
European and world governing bodies for football. That would be UAFA 
and FEFA. David Davies, the association's director of public affairs 
said Tuesday the English Football Association's executive council 
also passed a unanimous vote of no confidence in Weisman, but he refused 
to resign. The English FA will meet again in January to discuss Weisman's 
situation.
