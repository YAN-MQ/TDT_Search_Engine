For THE WORLD, I'm Derrick Stoffel in the BBC newsroom in London. 
President Clinton is on his way back to Washington from the Middle 
East. There, he held a three-way summit with Palestinian leader Yasser 
Arafat, and the Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, but there's 
no sign that the differences holding up the peace process have been 
resolved. The BBC's Paul Adams reports from Jerusalem. Bill Clinton 
said he achieved what he set out to achieve, which begs the question 
- Just what were his goals? - for this was a surprising, almost revolutionary 
visit. The Middle East may not be a very different place now that 
he's gone, but almost for the first time, Palestinians have begun 
to wonder if they, too, have a friend in the White House. Bill Clinton's 
eloquent sympathy touched deep chords and has perhaps raised Palestinian 
hopes. But Benjamin Netanyahu is not in the mood to yield, and threats 
by right-wingists to topple his government in a vote of confidence 
next week has stiffened his resolve. Paul Adams, BBC, Jerusalem.
