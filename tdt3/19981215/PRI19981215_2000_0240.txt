An international conference in Madrid has heard calls for tens of 
thousands of Bosnian refugees to be allowed to return home. The refugees 
are scattered across Europe. NATO Secretary General Javier Solana 
says the political will to start bringing the refugees home is growing. 
The situation better from the point of view of the people who are 
responsible for the different institutions and also for the pressure 
that the ordinary people in Bosnia-Herzegovina are putting on their 
leaders. I think that today, I'm a little bit more optimistic, more 
realistic than yesterday. NATO Secretary General Javier Solana.
