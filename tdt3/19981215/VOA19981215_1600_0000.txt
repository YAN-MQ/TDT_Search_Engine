President Clinton says he achieved what he set out to achieve during 
his visit to the Middle East, even though Israel did not set a date 
for its next troop withdrawal. More Republicans in the House of Representatives 
announce they will vote for the impeachment of President Clinton. 
Public opinion polls still favor a lesser form of punishment. A French 
parliamentary inquiry into the massacre of ethnic Tutsis in Rwanda 
in 1994 says France was not an accomplice to the killings. The Association 
of Southeast Asian Nations opens a summit in Vietnam under the shadow 
of the regional financial crisis. I'm Tony Riggs. And I'm Victor Morales. 
We'll have details and those stories plus sports, business news, and 
a retrospective all in this hour of VOA News Now. First, a summary 
of world news. I'm Dave DeForest, VOA News.
