Rock diva Mariah Carey's latest album "Mariah Carey around the world" 
is a Compilation of overseas concerts. She talked with Sherri Sylvester 
about the project and set the record straight about her personal life. 
"Mariah Carey around the world" is a upn special created from overseas 
concerts. It is touted as a personal look at the singer, who had editorial 
control over the candid moments. Carey is also featured on "the prince 
of Egypt" soundtrack. Her collection of hit singles, called "number 
1s," is selling well. She is taking acting class to prepare for future 
film work. On this day, she is dispelling the rumor that she has a 
skin disorder, and she'd like to set the record straight on several 
stories she's read. The hamster breeding thing -- that was kind of 
up there. The best of them, one of the best stories I've read about 
anybody. With all my free time, I go home and breed hamsters because 
that's just me. When I say I've never been on a date, I mean -- you 
know how a date -- this is what I think a date is supposed to be. 
Isn't it sort of like, okay, I'm going to go on a date with this person, 
I just met them, and they asked me to go out to dinner. I've never 
been on that kind of date. It's not easy. Everybody has a preconceived 
notion of you. You're supposed to be perfect. "Well, you're not acting 
like you did on that MTV interview. How come?" I'm not ready to -- 
I would have to devote my life to kids. And I would want to be with 
somebody who I loved, having kids. It wouldn't just be like, "whoo, 
let's take out an ad." I think I've experienced enough emotionally 
provocative things in my life to fill up three lifetimes of buckets 
of tears. We got to know each other and have fun together and laugh 
and kind of look at things, like, who else can understand when you 
wake up and someone writes in the paper that you have a skin disorder 
that you don't even have and takes it out of context and then says 
that you breed hamsters in another paper. Not many people can understand 
that level of absurdity. Carey's personal life will continue to take 
center stage. She'd just like a little spin control. Sherri Sylvester, 
CNN, Los Angeles.
