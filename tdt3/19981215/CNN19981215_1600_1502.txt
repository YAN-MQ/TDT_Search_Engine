A meaty bone. Maybe a huge fire hydrant. Some dogs in Corte Madera, 
California, got to give Santa their Christmas wishes this year. Bob 
mackenzie reports. Hello. What do dogs really want? Let's ask one. 
What would you like for Christmas? What do you want? What do you want? 
Unfortunately, most of us don't speak dog language, but we can assume 
Santa claus does. Come here. Come on. Hello, little puppy. Come on. 
Oh, yes, what a cute little puppy. At the village shopping center, 
the dogs had their pictures taken with Santa thanks to the humane 
society. Some of the dogs came from the humane society in the first 
place. When their family dog died two years ago, the chapeaus weren't 
going to get another one. At least that's what Mr. chapeau thought. 
My dad said that we couldn't get another dog. And then we made a skit 
for for Christmas for him, saying that we really wanted a dog, and 
for Christmas he said we could get another dog, so we got her. I kind 
of broke down. They all kind of ganged up on me. The chapeaus very 
much want a picture of Hershey with Santa. Hello. Hello there, little 
puppy. Hello there. What's your name. Hershey, however, has never 
seen a man in a red suit before. Why don't you take off the -- take 
off the leash. That's okay, Hershey. Come on. Come on, Hershey. That's 
okay. Oh, hersh. Hersh. Whoops. Eventually, Hershey decides to humor 
these people. There's a small fee for the picture, but all the money 
goes to the humane society to benefit deserving dogs. Good. He's not 
snapping at you. Yeah. Perfect! This was his second visit to Santa 
claus. The first visit he barked louder and longer than this time, 
so he's getting better. And he didn't snap at Santa. I actually have 
not had a bad experience. I've never been bitten. I've never had any 
dog do something that I didn't want him to do on me. And all the dogs 
have been very, very good. Okay, Buster, up. up. Good girl. Look at 
the camera. Good girl. Oh, you want that? You want that, Hunter? Hunter, 
do you want it? no. Hunter wants to get down. Hey, hey. oh. The doggie 
Santa photo sessions were such a success, the humane society will 
do it again next year. In Corte Madera, Bob McKenzie.
