The Libyan people's Congress has given qualified approval to a plan 
to try the two Libyan suspects in the bombing of Pan Am Flight 103 
over Lockerbie, scotland. The British foreign office is cautiously 
optimistic the decision will eventually lead to a trial. The United 
States and Britain have been strongly urging Libya to turn over the 
suspects for trial at the Hague under Scottish law. 270 people were 
killed in the 1988 bombing of flight 103.
