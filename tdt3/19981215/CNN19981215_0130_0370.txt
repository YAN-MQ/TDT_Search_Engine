In Los Angeles, campaign fund-raiser Johnnie Chung was sentenced for 
illegally giving $28,000 to the democratic national committee. The 
federal judge could have sent him to prison for 37 years. Instead, 
Chung got probation and was ordered to complete 3,000 hours of community 
service. In March, Chung pleaded guilty to the charge as part of an 
agreement with justice department lawyers investigating 1996 democratic 
fund-raising.
