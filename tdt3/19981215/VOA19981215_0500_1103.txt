You know what that means, don't you? It's time for sports, and here's 
VOA's man of the hour, Ray Kougell. San Francisco running back Garrison 
Hurst exploded for a team record 198 yards and a touchdown to lead 
the 49ers past the Detroit Lions 35 to 13 in Monday National Football 
League action. The 49ers also set a club record with 338 yards on 
the ground. San Francisco quarterback Steve Young passed for a touchdown, 
ran for another, and running back Terry Kirby scored two touchdowns. 
The 49ers improved to 11 and 3, putting them one game back of the 
NFC West Division leading Atlanta Falcons. The 49ers have already 
clinched a playoff berth but are still contending for the division 
title. Detroit is just playing out the season with a 5 and 9 record.
