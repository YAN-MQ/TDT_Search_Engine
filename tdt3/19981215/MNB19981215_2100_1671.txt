President Clinton, by the way, wrapped up his three-day visit to the 
mideast today without a promise from Israel for withdrawing more troops 
from the West Bank. The president met with Netanyahu and Yasser Arafat 
hoping to salvage the peace deal they signed in October. Netanyahu 
could lose his job on Monday when the Israeli parliament holds a No-confidence 
vote. He's waiting for the Palestinians to rectify what he claims 
are a dozen violations of all this. The president leaves behind quite 
a mess there.
