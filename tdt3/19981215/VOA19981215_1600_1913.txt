Angola's UNITA rebels have laid siege to a key central Angolan town 
defended by government forces cutting off air, road, and rail links. 
The fighting at Quito, which erupted on Sunday, involves heavy artillery 
and anti-aircraft defense systems. State agencies say Quito could 
face a humanitarian disaster with more than 80,000 people crowded 
into the town now trying to escape the fighting.
