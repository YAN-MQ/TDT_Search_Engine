South African President Nelson Mandela narrowly escaped injury Tuesday. 
He was trapped in a store as a freak tornado hit the town of Umtata 
near the country's southeastern coast. At least 13 people were killed 
in the storm and hundreds more were injured. VOA Johannesburg correspondent, 
Alex Belida, has more. The 80-year-old Mr. Mandela was trapped in 
a pharmacy during a holiday shopping trip to Umtata when the tornado 
struck. A spokeswoman says his bodyguards told him to lie on the floor 
and covered him with their bodies. The storm shattered the door and 
the windows of the pharmacy and part of the roof caved in, but Mr. 
Mandela was unhurt. The South African leader is on holiday at his 
hometown of Kunu just outside Umtata. His spokeswoman says he returned 
there with his bodyguards after the incident. Alex Belida, VOA News, 
Johannesburg.
