As we mentioned, one of the country's most prominent and influential 
black judges has died after suffering a series of strokes over this 
past weekend. Judge Leon higginbotham appeared on this broadcast several 
days just as recently as a few days ago following his testimony before 
the house judiciary committee, urging members not to impeach President 
Clinton. Here is some of what he had to say on the hill that day. 
I don't think what this illustrious body needs are quotes from Madison 
or mason or Benjamin Franklin but quotes from a person known as Luther 
standing bear, a member of the Indian tribe who said, "thought comes 
beforepeech." The more have reflected on it, it seems to me that that 
is the critical issue. Professor Charles ogletree said that judge 
higginbotham never forgot the little people. And he was a judge for 
29 years before he retired. He received the presidential Mel of freedom 
for his commitment to civil rights. He was a professor at Harvard 
University.
