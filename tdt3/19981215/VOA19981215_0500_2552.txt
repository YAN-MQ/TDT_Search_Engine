U.S. special envoy Richard Holbrooke is expected to meet today in 
Belgrade with Yugoslav President Slobodan Milosevic about drawing 
violence in Serbia's Kosovo province. The State Department spokesman 
said Mr. Holbrooke will stress the need to move forward with efforts 
to reach a peace plan for Kosovo. Mr. Holbrooke brokered a deal in 
October to end the fighting between Serbian troops and Albanian separatists. 
Meanwhile, there has been a step up in the violence in Kosovo as Phillip 
Smucker reports. If confirmed, the death toll would be the highest 
since a deal to end Kosovo's violence was signed in October. But Serbian 
and Albanian versions of the clash differed markedly. British monitors 
assigned to the region said they had only confirmed a single death. 
Serb officials in the border town of Priserin said the fighting broke 
out early Monday when ethnic Albanians tried to enter Yugoslavia illegally 
with what the Serbs called sophisticated weaponry. But official ethnic 
Albanian sources in Pristina said that Serbian forces had laid siege 
to three villages and raided several ethnic Albanian homes. They said 
a convoy of Serb military police forces including three armored vehicles, 
two anti-aircraft rockets, and ten trucks of Serb soldiers entered 
the border area early Monday. Yugoslav Army units later sealed the 
border area making access difficult for British monitors in the region. 
Several ethnic Albanian sources said that they had confirmed only 
one dead, and British monitors said their own investigation had confirmed 
one dead in the clash. A source working with European monitors said 
that members of the ethnic Albanian Kosovo Liberation Army insisted 
that British monitors evacuate Albanians killed and wounded in the 
clash. He said that they threatened violence if the evacuation was 
not carried out. Local Serbian police sources said they confiscated 
a large number of modern weapons from the intruding guerrillas. Both 
sides in the Kosovo conflict have been bolstering their forces since 
U.S. special envoy Richard Holbrooke signed a deal with Yugoslav President 
Slobodan Milosevic to put an end to the fighting. Neither side has 
expressed any confidence that a 2,000 member international monitoring 
force can put an end to the fighting. Phillip Smucker for VOA News,
