We have confirmation of winter, by the way. Time for a look at the 
weather across the country. We go to WNBC-TV in New York, meteorologist 
Janice huff. It's finally cold out there. yes, it is. At least here 
in the east, Brian. But out west, the winds have kicked in again across 
southern cafornia. It was 85 degrees today at the civic center in 
L.A. low pressure spinning in southern California. Strong off-shore 
winds over southern California bringing the warmth. In the meantime, 
another area of low pressure over the carolinas, bringing heavy rain 
and ice pellets over the mountains of North Carolina. So, temperatures 
in the 30's and hos in the east, 28 I international falls. 71 in Los 
Angeles. It will be a chilly night for most of the nation, 30's as 
far south and tallahassee and back into parts of Texas. Highs tomorrow, 
60'snd 70's across the south, 70's and 80's in the L.A. basin, but 
HHS in the 20's over the Arrowhead of Minnesota. Cold air is filters 
south across the Great Lakes to the east coast. 49 in Boston tomorrow. 
40 in Chicago, Miami, 71, 84 in L.A. Phoenix, 75. As we go through 
time, tomorrow, into Friday, the cold air shifts to the east coast, 
and this low prsure deepens, so colder air is expected by the end 
of the week for much of the northeast. Snow over the northern plains 
and upper midwest. Meanwhile, mild to warm weather acro the south 
and heating up over california. That's the weather around the nation. 
Back to you. Thanks, Janice.
