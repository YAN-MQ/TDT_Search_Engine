Two recent land deals could change the face of conservation in the 
northeast. Natalie pawelski has the story. Two deals, a half million 
acres and $100 million, changing hands between once mortal enemies 
-- environmental groups and paper companies. Last week, the conservation 
fund announced it will pay $76 million to champion international for 
nearly 300,000 acres across New Hampshire, vermont and upstate New 
York. And today, a second deal. The nature conservancy and international 
paper will swap $35 million for 286 square miles of Maine's north 
Woods. We're interested in trying to protect certain key natural values 
in the landscape and make sure that the land is managed in a way that 
it will be there for our children and our children's children. Some 
of the land will be set aside as a haven for moose, bears and other 
animals and plants. Some areas will remain open for limited logging, 
and for hunting, fishing and recreation. That's a dramatic change 
from the days when the only paper that changed hands between environmentalists 
and timber companies was lawsuit-related. There's a lot of advantages 
to working in the private sector. We can move quickly. We don't have 
to wait for laws to be passed or appropriations to be passed. And 
this is an opportunity that came on the market, and we acted quickly 
to preserve this piece of property. The deals may signal that the 
government, not always popular in its role as a landlord, is getting 
more help from the private sector in preserving land that is worth 
protecting. Natalie pawelski, CNN, reporting.
