This look at your "CNN Headline News Weather" begins with our forecast 
weather map for tomorrow morning. You can see two cold fronts on the 
map. One moves to the midwest then into the east. Another one moves 
through the northern plains states. Both of these weather systems 
bring to an end the very, very warm temperatures we've been seeing 
in the upper midwest and the northern plains states. Meanwhile, an 
area of low pressure develops off the southeastern coast, but it lifts 
out to the north and east and not expected to be a big problem along 
the east coast. Much of the nation will be nice and dry under the 
influence of high pressure. We could see a little bit of rainfall 
in the southwest associated with the area of low pressure. Temperatures 
throughout most of the country will be rather mild. 20s and 30s, however, 
will be found in the Great Lakes area, up into the northeast. Here 
is your extended forecast -- on Thursday, snowfall is possible in 
the Great Lakes area, but temperatures are still rather mild. On Friday, 
you can see the snow showers continuing in the Great Lakes area. Still 
cool in that region, too. And on Saturday, snow showers are possible 
in the New England states. For more weather information, log on to
