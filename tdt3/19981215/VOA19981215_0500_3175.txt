quarter pre-tax charge of nearly $400 million. The company elimination 
of 4200 jobs in worldwide operations citing retail price increases 
and expenses stemming from last month's 200-plus billion dollar settlement 
between the tobacco industry and 46 U.S. states to pay for the treatment 
of six smokers. RJR Nabisco says it expected lower cigarette sales.
