From Public Radio International, this is THE WORLD, a co-production 
of the BBC World Service, PRI, and WGBH Boston. It's Tuesday, December 
15. I'm Lisa Mullins in Boston. Today, President Clinton heads home 
from a mixed Mid East mission to an impending impeachment vote. Also, 
Libya moves closer to handing over two Lockerbie bombing suspects 
for trial. And frequent flyers welcome a high-tech identification 
system that doesn't give them any lip. You know, ATM machines and 
our kiosk doesn't talk back. It doesn't - It always welcomes you. 
It's kind of funny, but that seems to be human nature. They'd rather 
deal with something automated like this than a live person. First, 
this news.
