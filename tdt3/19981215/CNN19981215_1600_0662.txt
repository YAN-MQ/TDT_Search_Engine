Burlington coat factory is recalling hundreds of winter parkas from 
its stores after discovering the parkas were trimmed with dog fur 
from China. The New Jersey-based chain operates 250 stores nationwide. 
It says it was duped by an Asian vendor who said the fur was coyote. 
An investigator from the humane society discovered the fur was from 
dogs during a trip to China to investigate the fur trade.
