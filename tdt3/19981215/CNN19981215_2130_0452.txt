President Clinton says he believes his mideast trip has helped the 
cause of peace. After today's meeting with Israeli prime minister 
Benjamin Netanyahu and palestinian authority President Yasser Arafat, 
Mr. Clinton said he has achieved his goals for the trip. Although 
Israel is delaying the next phase of West Bank troop withdrawals, 
President Clinton said the administration will just keep working to 
make sure things move forward. He's also commending the Palestine 
national council's move to abolish clauses in the PLO charter calling 
for Israel's destruction. Still, Israeli prime minister Netanyahu 
says the Palestinians have to do more. Mr. Clinton is due back at 
the White House late tonight.
