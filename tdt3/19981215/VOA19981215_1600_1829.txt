President Clinton, who is flying back to Washington in this hour, 
says he achieved what he set out to do during his visit to Israel 
and the Palestinian autonomous areas. The president was not able to 
convince Israel to go ahead with its next promised troop pullout from 
the West Bank on Friday as scheduled, but he said the parties are 
on track to find practical ways to move the peace process forward. 
Mr. Clinton says the Israeli and Palestinian leaders reaffirmed their 
commitment to the Wye River peace accord of a joint meeting with them 
on the Israel-Gaza border.
