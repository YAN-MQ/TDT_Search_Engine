Have you talked about your child's health today? My baby eats well, 
but how do I know if she's getting the proper nutrition? The growth 
of your child is a good way to tell if she's getting all the nutrients 
she needs. What's the best way to measure my baby's growth? By getting 
a baby's weight checked regularly. A health worker can then compare 
your baby's weight to the ideal weight of children the same age and 
height. So if there's a problem, it can be detected early? That's 
right. Give your baby a healthy start. Find out from a health worker 
about the best foods to feed growing children. Your child's health 
is your family's future. And President Clinton, our top story in the 
news, at 10 hours 18 universal time. President Clinton says both Israel 
and Palestinians have reaffirmed their commitment to the Wye River 
peace accord. He says that the peace process is back on track. We'll 
have further details about that story coming up in our next news report 
about 11 minutes from now.
