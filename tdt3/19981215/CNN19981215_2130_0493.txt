It appears astronauts aboard space shuttle "endeavour" will soon have 
their feet back on "Terra firma." NASA says the weather at Kennedy 
space center appears to be good enough for the landing, scheduled 
tonight just before 11:00 P.M. eastern. During three days of space 
walks, the crew of "endeavour" successfully assembled the first two 
parts of the $60 billion international space station.
