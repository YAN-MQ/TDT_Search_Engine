Atlanta Falcons head coach Dan Reeves underwent successful quadruple 
heart bypass surgery Monday and is listed in good condition. Reeves 
checked into an Atlanta hospital Monday morning after suffering a 
burning sensation in his chest and throat during a Falcons victory 
over the New Orleans Saints on Sunday. Doctors advised the 54-year-old 
Reeves to have bypass surgery to repair three clogged arteries. Doctors 
say Reeves could be discharged by Friday. Reeves is in his second 
year with Atlanta. The Falcons are having a terrific season leading 
the NFC West with a 12 and 2 record. Defensive coordinator and assistant 
head coach Rich Brooke will take over at interim head coach until 
Reeves returns, and doctors say that could be by the end of the month.
