Aide workers and government officials in Northern India are planning 
a big airlift of animal feed. They say nearly 30,000 nomads are in 
danger of losing their livestock because of early winter snow falls. 
Dan Huntington of the aid agency, Appropriate Technology for Tibet, 
says the herds of sheep, goats, and yak must be saved. They're absolutely 
crucial. They have nothing else whatsoever. The livestock here is 
the key to the whole situation. If we can feed the livestock properly, 
then the situation will resolve itself. Dan Huntington. Cashmere wool 
exports from the region are also under threat.
