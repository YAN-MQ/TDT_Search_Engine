In U.S. professional soccer, Coby Jones of the Los Angeles Galaxy 
was named Honda Player of the Year. As we hear from VOA's Michael 
O'Sullivan, the Los Angeles midfielder beat finalists from Washington's 
D.C. United and Britain's Lester City. Coby Jones outscored Eddie 
Pope of D.C. United and Casey Keller, an American who plays for Lester 
Chiddies in a poll of 200 U.S. sports journalists. Nominees must have 
played at least five games with the U.S. National Team in the previous 
year. The 28-year-old Jones said all three worked hard this year. 
You know, we didn't have in mind, you know, winning awards like this. 
We just worked hard, you know, for the sake of soccer in itself just 
to be better players and help our team out. And definitely you get 
noticed and the rewards are definitely worth it. Lester Chiddies, 
Casey Keller was runner up in the Honda Player of the Year competition. 
Last year's winner, Eddie Pope of D.C. United, was the third ranked 
player this year. Mike O'Sullivan, VOA News, Los Angeles.
