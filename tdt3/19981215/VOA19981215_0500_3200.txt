Malaysia's Prime Minister Mohammad Mahafir says his country's economy 
will shrink six percent this year and capital controls will stay until 
a new international financial regime is put in place. Malaysia is 
mired in its worst recession in more than a decade. Third quarter 
gross domestic product fell nearly nine percent, its worst performance 
ever.
