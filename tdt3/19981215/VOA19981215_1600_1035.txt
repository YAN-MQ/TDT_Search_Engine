This is the Voice of America, broadcasting from Washington. I'm Tony 
Riggs, along with Victor Morales bringing you this hour of VOA News 
Now. Have you talked about your child's health today? My baby eats 
well, but how do I know if she's getting the proper nutrition? The 
growth of your child is a good way to tell if she's getting all the 
nutrients she needs. What's the best way to measure my baby's growth? 
By getting a baby's weight checked regularly. A health worker can 
then compare your baby's weight to the ideal weight of children the 
same age and height. So if there's a problem, it can be detected early? 
That's right. Give your baby a healthy start. Find out from a health 
worker about the best foods to feed growing children. Your child's 
health is your family's future. It's 21 hours 18 universal time. Here's 
the major news story we're following. President Clinton says he achieved 
what he set out to achieve during his visit to Israel and the Palestinian 
autonomous areas. We'll have more on that and the rest of this hour's 
top news in our next summary 12 minutes from now. Well, right now, 
let's get all the latest from the world of sports with VOA's Steve 
Schy.
