Two of President Clinton's most ardent supporters may be unable to 
help him now. Chris black reports on the role of the first lady and 
the vice president. In good times and bad Hillary has stood by her 
man. So has vice President Al Gore. But friends say there is little 
these two loyalists can do to help Mr. clinton win this impeachment 
fight. They are just not the right people at the right time. She has 
never been popular with republicans. On the other hand, Gore, who 
might be able to talk in their terms, is just bound in by his situation, 
by his need to be unwavering in his support of the president. Six 
years ago, Mr. Clinton helped diffuse the Jennifer Flowers flap, the 
first crisis of the Clinton presidential campaign. Six years later, 
the first lady eventually emerged to back him again after he admitted 
his relationship with Monica Lewinsky. I'm proud of his leadership. 
I'm proud of his commitment. I'm proud of what he gives our country 
and all of us. Presidential hopeful Gore has had to put his run for 
2000 on hold this week, canceling a trip to be in Washington for the 
house vote. While President Clinton has been out looking presidential, 
Gore has been out front criticizing republican leaders for blocking 
a censure resolution. I believe it's very unfortunate that the leadership 
of the House of Representatives has made a decision to reject compromise 
and force a vote only on impeachment. Mr. Clinton has been silent 
in her support since the election. Associates say she still believes 
her husband is being victimized by a Right-wing conspiracy. In her 
public appearances she maintains a formal stiffness. A White House 
official says she has no plans to speak out in the next 48 hours. 
Her advisers say she should horde her political capital and use it 
it when it will do the most good. Strong public campaigns by Mr. Clinton 
and gorme not work. Moderate republicans are not their biggest fans. 
This time Mrs. Clinton's man may have to stand by himself. Chris black, 
CNN, the White House.
