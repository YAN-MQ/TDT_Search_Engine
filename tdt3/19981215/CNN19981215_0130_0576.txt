The crew of space shuttle "endeavour" is preparing for Tuesday's return 
to earth. "Endeavour" is scheduled to land at Kennedy space center 
in Florida at 10:56 P.M., but NASA says bad weather may force them 
to reschedule the landing for Wednesday, possibly at Edwards air force 
base in California. During three days of space walks, the crew of 
"endeavour" successfully assembled the first two parts of the $60 
billion international space station.
