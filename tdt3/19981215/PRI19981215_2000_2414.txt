A cosmopolitan cauldron is one way to describe today's geography puzzler. 
This place is a blend of the new and old. Among the aged is a cobweb 
of canals winding through the 17th and 18th century architecture of 
this capital city, giving it its distinctive shape. History buffs 
will recognize this spot as the site of the Anne Frank house where 
the young Jewish girl and her family hid from the German occupying 
forces. The home draws more than a million tourists each year, and 
tourists are also drawn to other houses - the coffee houses, or rather 
the infamous coffee shops. Every November, visitors crowd the shops 
for the Annual Cannabis Cup Festival, which celebrates the attendees' 
favorite read and their favorite bean. Coming up, our answer and why 
this may not be the city to go to if you really want to tie one on.
