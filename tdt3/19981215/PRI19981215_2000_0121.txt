President Clinton is heading back to Washington. There, he will lobby 
hard to avoid impeachment. THE WORLD's Bill Wax reports from Washington. 
A trend towards voting for impeachment against Bill Clinton continued 
to gather steam in Washington. At least 17 moderate Republicans targeted 
by the White House have come out for impeaching the president in the 
past two days. President Clinton is considering several options to 
try to head off his impeachment. One is to invite 10 to 12 key moderate 
Republicans to hear a personal appeal from him. Other advisors are 
urging the president to make an appearance on Capitol Hill. Clinton 
himself continues to say he is open to any reasonable compromise with 
Congress short of impeachment. For THE WORLD, I'm Bill Wax in Washington.
