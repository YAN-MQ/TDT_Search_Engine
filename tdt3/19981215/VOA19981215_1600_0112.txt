With a crucial vote just days away, the U.S. House of Representatives 
appears ready to impeach President Clinton. The number of undecided 
lawmakers is shrinking and the momentum seems to be going from Capitol 
Hill. Each day brings more bad news for the White House, as one by 
one, members leave the ranks from the undecided and announce plans 
to vote for impeachment. Among them is California Republican Tom Campbell. 
I conclude that the president intentionally, on more than one occasion, 
did not tell the truth in a federal criminal grand jury. That is very 
serious. That is impeachable. Mr. Clinton's 1996 election opponent 
is also speaking out. Former Senate Republican leader Bob Dole says 
he has an alternative solution. He says after the House votes, the 
Senate should take up a strongly worded resolution condemning the 
president's actions. That legislation would require Bill Clinton's 
signature as an admission of guilt. Mr. Dole's plan is designed to 
avoid a Senate trial on the fate of the Clinton presidency. He calls 
it a tough but responsible solution. Paula Wolfson, VOA News, Capitol 
Hill. White House officials are also pressing for censure of Mr. Clinton 
instead of impeachment, a proposal which is being rejected by Republican 
leaders. The incoming House speaker, Bob Livingston, says the censure 
idea is not something for the House to consider. The only rule of 
the House is to determine whether or not to offer up articles of impeachment, 
and any other decision, any other remedy, any other penalty is not 
within our jurisdiction. That's a matter for the Senate to undertake. 
Democratic Senator Joseph Lieberman says the momentum is clearly in 
the direction of the House approving articles of impeachment.
