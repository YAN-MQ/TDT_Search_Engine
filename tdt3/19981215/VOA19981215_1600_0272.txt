A French parliamentary committee says the United States is largely 
to blame for Rwanda's spiral into genocidal violence that killed up 
to a million people in 1994. The committee says Paris can be faulted 
for its shortsighted foreign policy but that Washington failed Rwanda 
by opposing the formation of a U.N. peacekeeping force. The State 
Department notes President Clinton has expressed regret that the international 
community did not do more to prevent the bloodshed in Rwanda.
