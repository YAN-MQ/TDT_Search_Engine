A close call for the vacationing south African President Nelson Mandela. 
A tornado hit a pharmacy while he was inside shopping. A spokesman 
says Mr. Mandela and his bodyguards were not injured, even though 
the twister caved in part of the pharmacy's roof and blew out the 
doors and windows. At least 13 people in the city were killed. 150 
were injured.
