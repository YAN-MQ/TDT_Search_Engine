United Nations Secretary General Kofi Annan says he is concerned that 
wars could break out in Iraq and Yugoslavia's Kosovo province during 
the coming year. He voiced his concerns Monday at a news conference 
in which he reviewed the achievements and the problems of the past 
year. VOA's United Nations correspondent Max Rustin reports. Mr. Annan 
said much of his time in 1998 has been taken up by issues of war and 
peace, particularly those dealing with Africa, the Balkans, Afghanistan, 
and nuclear tests in South Asia. But he said there have also been 
positive developments over the past year, most notably the agreement 
on the statute of the international criminal court, the entry into 
force of the Ottawa land mine ban, and the elections and formation 
of a new coalition government in Cambodia. Looking towards the future, 
Mr. Annan said he is most concerned by the threat of war in Kosovo 
and Iraq. The best we can say is that in Kosovo and Iraq, all-out 
war has been avoided for the time being. But unless people abide by 
their commitments, and unless they redouble their efforts to find 
peaceful solutions, we have every reason to fear the worst in 1999. 
Regarding the dispute of Libya over two men accused of bombing an 
American airliner over Scotland ten years ago, Mr. Annan said he believes 
that issue will be resolved. He said he is confident Libya will hand 
the two men over for trial in the Netherlands, but he said he is unable 
to predict a time frame for such a development. The U.N. secretary 
general said he hopes to find time over the coming year to focus on 
the start of the new millennium. Speaking of internal U.N. reforms, 
he said it is time for some nations to stop what he called the constant 
harassment of reform, reform, reform, so that he can work on updating 
the objectives of the United Nations for the decades to come. Max 
Rustin, VOA News, United Nations.
