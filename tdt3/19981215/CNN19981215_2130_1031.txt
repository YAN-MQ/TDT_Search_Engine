The holiday season can be especially sweet for frequent fliers if 
they shop online. Stephanie Oswald reports, in this edition of "working 
ahead. If too much travel is keeping you from the stores, the Internet 
can save the day. It's estimated that 80% of frequent online shoppers 
are also frequent fliers. Online purchases can even turn into frequent 
flier miles. With the Christmas gifts that I'm going to be purchasing, 
I get 8,000. "click rewards" works with web sites such as Barnes & 
Noble, music boulevard and preview travel, to offer one-stop shopping 
and mileage earning. You buy $50 worth of books, you get 50 frequent 
flier miles. You let click rewards know you want them to go to them 
to united airlines. Even if your laptop's at home, Internet access 
is never far away. Many airports have kiosks for online access and 
shopping between flights. When you go into malls and it's a mob scene, 
it's kind of nice to think, "I don't want to stand in line, I want 
to get online." Stuck on a plane with the urge to shop? Pick up the 
phone. "Skymall" catalogs are a fixture in airline seatback pockets, 
with gifts from 55 specialty retailers and free use of the airphone 
to place your order. Shopping on the road means no packages to carry. 
I can have it shipped to them so I'm not coming home, you know, getting 
off the plane with bundles and bundles of boxes. Avoiding the hassle 
of fighting the latest carry-on crackdown by the airlines. Stephanie 
Oswald, CNN reporting.
