Well, moving to the National Football League, the San Francisco 49ers 
set team rushing records Monday against the Detroit Lions on route 
to a 35 to 13 victory on national television. Running back Garrison 
Hurst ran for a record 198 yards, and quarterback Steve Young added 
66 on the ground, as the home team 49ers racked up 328 rushing yards. 
Hurst says playing on a team with a winning attitude makes a huge 
difference. I've been to places where, you know, you don't win games. 
And the thing is all you want to do is win more games than I did the 
year before, and then come here. You know the first thing is here, 
"Let's win the Super Bowl again," and that makes a difference to guys. 
Well, for me, anyway. And I like hearing that. It makes me play even 
harder. The San Francisco defense meanwhile shut down the Lions all 
pro running back Barry Sanders holding the league second all-time 
rusher to a yards and 14 carries. Sanders says the 9ers offense did 
everything well. It looked like the whole offense was just working. 
I've seen it, especially the running game. He did a great job hitting 
the holes and the guys - Really the offensive unit just, you know 
- Steve looked good. All of them looked good. Detroit scored all 13 
of its points in the fourth quarter when the game was already out 
of reach.
