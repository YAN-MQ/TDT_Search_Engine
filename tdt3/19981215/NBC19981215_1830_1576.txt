Beginning with those stories on the "today" show this morning all 
day we have been counting down the most interesting moments of this 
year. As we continue our running tally for 1998, "Nightly News" tonight 
takes note of a political turmoil, the political surprises the natural 
disasters. The allegations are false. I did not have sexual relations 
with that woman. Miss Lewinsky. I never told anybody to lie. Not a 
single time. Never. Well, I've already said that the charges are false. 
It's a moment that would be repeated over and over again. The president's 
montra for much of 1998. These allegations are false. After ten months 
of denials in various forms and independent counsel Ken Starr's investigation, 
much of the kubts was ready not to embrace, but to accept the president's 
explanation. While the rest of the country would not forgive him. 
But all across America, voters were fed up with politics as usual. 
Which brings us to another most interesting moment. Jesse Ventura, 
and Newt Gingrich. An odd couple? Not really. We shocked the world. 
November 3rd, 1998. A surprise victory for former wrestler Jesse Ventura 
of the elected governor of Minnesota. Hopefully the democrats and 
the republicans will take notice now. They will stop -- wait, wait. 
They will stop their partisan party politics and start doing what's 
right for the people. November 6th, 1998. Just three days after this 
out mate outsider won in Minnesota. Another outsider who became an 
insider lost his job. Speaker of the house Newt Gingrich. Who would 
have thought that just four years after he led the republicans to 
take control of Congress, his own party would throw him out? I could 
hardly stand by and allow the party to can nablize itself in that 
situation. The political client that brought us Jesse Ventura and 
cost Newt gingrich his job was nothing compared to our next moment. 
A moment that will last far longer. October 29th, 1998. Mur cane Mitch 
slammed into Honduras with torrential rains causing mudslides and 
massive floods. Entire villages were washed away. More than 11,000 
people were swallowed by the mud and waters. 2 million were left homeless 
in central America. The total cost, more than $3 billion in damages 
and a human toll far greater. 1998, the year of unexpected results, 
does that mean 1999 is the year of unexpected consequences?
