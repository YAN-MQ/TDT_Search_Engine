And finally, British composer, Andrew Lloyd Webber, is being sued 
in a court in New York for millions of dollars. The composer of religious 
folk music, Ray Rap, accuses him of stealing one of his songs and 
reworking it for the hit musical, "Phantom of the Opera." Lord Lloyd 
Weber denies the accusation. He told the court that he created the 
song for his then-wife, Sarah Brightman.
