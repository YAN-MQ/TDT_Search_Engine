I'm Martin Secrist. Well, many of our FM and medium wave listeners, 
you will find our stations are about to take a bit of a break, just 
two minutes. I hope you'll return to News Now. It is December 15th, 
1998, a Tuesday. Let's turn back the clock a little bit if you will, 
to 1791 when the Bill of Rights was added to the U.S. Constitution 
when the Virginia legislature voted to ratify it. Now the first ten 
amendments are called the Bill of Rights because they guarantee Americans 
basic civil liberties and human rights. These include freedom of speech, 
press, and religion. The amendments assure Americans the right to 
peacefully assemble and petition the government. The Bill of Rights 
also protects Americans against unreasonable searches and arbitrary 
arrest without due process of law. The first ten amendments were added 
to the Constitution to satisfy opponents of the new national charter. 
The Constitution, who believed it gave too much power to the central 
government at the expense of individuals. And, of course, we've been 
talking about the landing of the Space Shuttle Endeavour. That is 
coming up later today after a real landmark mission. That's a poor 
choice of words. A landmark in space. That's a pun. Anyhow, so they 
at the building space station - Well, ironically, this historic mission 
will end on the same day when another space anniversary is marked. 
It was on December 15th, 1965, that two American space craft called 
Gemini met in orbit. The two, two-man spaced vehicles in the to within 
three meters of each other and flew in formation around the Earth. 
And that was certainly quite an achievement... Quite an accomplishment. 
... for that time. But mercy's sake, look how far we have come. Ten 
hours 30 universal time. This is VOA News Now. Clinton says both Israel 
and Palestinians have reaffirmed their commitment to the Wye River 
peace accord. The Association of Southeast Asian Nations opens its 
annual meeting in Vietnam with the region's economic problems at the 
top of the agenda. These stories and business all ahead in this half 
hour of VOA News Now. Thank you for joining us on this Tuesday. I'm 
Paul Westpheling along with Charlene Porter.
