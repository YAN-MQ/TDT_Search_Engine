The president returns to Washington late tonight Washington time, 
and his next item of business will be to face the prospect of impeachment 
by the U.S. House of Representatives. VOA's Debra Tate reports. Mr. 
Clinton Wednesday is to meet with one congressman who was leaning 
towards voting to impeach the president. Congressman Christopher Shays 
of Connecticut had been opposed to impeachment until just recently 
and had requested a meeting with Mr. Clinton to discuss his concerns. 
Although the threat of impeachment overshadowed his trip to the Middle 
East, Mr. Clinton says it did not affect his work explaining: You 
need to show up for work every day. It's not a complicated thing. 
The House is to vote Thursday on four articles of impeachment drafted 
by the Judiciary Committee alleging perjury, obstruction of justice, 
and abuse of power. Debra Tate, VOA News, Jerusalem.
