The congressional joint committee on taxation reports nearly 48 million 
americans will owe no income taxes for 1998. That's up from 46 million 
people who owed nothing last year. And it accounts for more than a 
third of Americans who are required to file tax returns. A new $400 
per child tax credit is attributed to some of the increase. The IRS 
says part of the credit may even result in a refund for families with 
three or more children.
