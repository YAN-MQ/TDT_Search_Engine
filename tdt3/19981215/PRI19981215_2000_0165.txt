The Libyan parliament says it will back a deal to try the suspects 
accused of the bombing of Pan Am Flight 103 in a neutral country. 
The resolution did not say the two Libyan men would be handed over, 
but a spokesman for the families of the British Lockerbie victims, 
Jim Swyer, believes the trial will happen. This is a major milestone 
along our search for truth and justice, which the lack of which is 
largely responsible for the inability to lay this to rest. This part 
is all about justice, this trial, but of course, the spin-off from 
the trial may well be a major set of leaps towards the truth behind 
it all, which we also need. The father of one of the victims, Jim 
Swyer. State Department spokesman James Foley labeled the Libyan statement 
mere rhetoric. He added Washington would consider other actions if 
the suspects are not handed over.
