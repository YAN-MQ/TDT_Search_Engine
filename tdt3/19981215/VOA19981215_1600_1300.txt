Well, speaking of the NFL, officials are expected to discuss the use 
of instant replays during the playoffs in a conference call on Tuesday. 
The discussion between members of the competition committee and league 
officials was prompted by a flurry of officiating blunders this season. 
But Commissioner Paul Tagliaboo indicated Sunday he expects the league 
to shoot down the proposal. The commissioner says quick fixes in the 
middle of the season usually tend to turn out like missed extra points. 
The 18-member competition committee made up of five executives and 
three coaches have to approve any replay plan before it can be voted 
on. Now if the clubs are asked to vote on a proposal, 24 of the 31 
teams have to approve it to be pass. That's a look at sports this 
hour. I'm Steve Schy.
