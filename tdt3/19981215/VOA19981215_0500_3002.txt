Japan's finance minister is calling for an overhaul of the global 
financial system. Keichi Miyazawa echoed the European concerns about 
currency volatility saying the challenge is to attain managed flexibility 
among the U.S. dollar, the yen, and the soon to be launched euro, 
something the United States opposes. Mr. Miyazawa also repeated Japan's 
position favoring better monitoring of short-term capital flows critics 
say have aggravated Asia's financial crisis. Mr. Miyazawa noting Monday's 
Tenkan survey of Japanese business confidence at the lowest level 
in nearly five years says the survey has hit bottom but cautious improvement 
may be sometime off. Ian Wright, head of Japanese Equities and Foreign 
and Colonial Investment Trust in London says Japanese monetary policy 
has not provided enough yen for the economy to move out of recession. 
My concern here is there just isn't sufficient yen around at the moment. 
The great debate on what the Bank of Japan is trying to do with its 
monetary policy, you see, by lending down four percent year on year, 
you're seeing the yen strengthen against the dollar. Clearly, the 
Bank of Japan is not supplied sufficiently for this to offset the 
credit crunch. Meanwhile, the Bank of Japan has decided to leave monetary 
policy where it is, no change in the country's record low one-half 
of one percent official discount rate.
