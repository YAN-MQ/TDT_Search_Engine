This is meteorologist Valerie Voss with the "CNN Headline News Weather" 
forecast for Tuesday. The weather will remain quiet around the country, 
but a fast-moving cold front will move across the plains states, bringing 
cooler temperatures to the region than they saw on Monday. But they'll 
still be above what's normal for this time of year. An area of low 
pressure off the southeast coast will keep some rain showers just 
in the vicinity of the coastline. Could be some lingering clouds and 
fog across the region as well. Out west, generally quiet, perhaps 
some rain showers into the coastal areas of the northwest. It will 
still be breezy across southern California with some 60s and 70s. 
20s and 30s over the north-central part of the country. Still cool, 
50s in the southeast. Looking ahead to Wednesday, we could see some 
rain and snow just along the U.S./Canada border with some showers 
in the four corners region. Then on Thursday, a rain and snow mix 
for the Great Lakes. On Friday, rain, snow and wind move toward the 
northeast. Temperatures still rather mild. Don't forget, four-day 
forecasts for 7,200 cities at CNN.com.
