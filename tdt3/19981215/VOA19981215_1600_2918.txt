Well, today pretty much canceled yesterday in the stock market. The 
Dow Jones Industrial Average closed at 8823. That was up 127 points. 
Standard & Poors 500 Index closed at 11,062, up 21 points. NASDAQ 
gained 45. Analysts say there was some selective bargain hunting after 
Monday's big selloff in which the industrial average lost 126 points, 
but the buying pressure gathered a lot of momentum in the last hour 
of trading, wiping out all of Monday's loss.
