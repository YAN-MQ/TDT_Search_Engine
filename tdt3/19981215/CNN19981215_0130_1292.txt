We begin with Monday night football. San Francisco ran all over Detroit, 
literally. They beat the lions 35-13. Any team that has ten wins, 
three losses, now 11 wins, knows how to win games, and so that's the 
thing I thought coming to the game. They don't have the depth they've 
had in the past thp pave got injuries. I felt it was a competent dense. 
Dan Reeves had quadruple bypass surgery Monday. Brooks will coach 
the team on an interim basis. Reeves hopes to be back for the playoffs.
