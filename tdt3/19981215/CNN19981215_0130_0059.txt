With about 30 members of the house still undecided about whether to 
impeach President Clinton, the White House is courting moderate republicans. 
But many members say they won't decide the subject until Thursday's 
vote, and others may be changing their minds. Monday, Connecticut 
republican Christopher Shays, who had previously come out against 
impeachment, jumped back on the fence. Shays says he doesn't have 
the same level of conviction he had a week ago and is reconsidering 
the issue. The White House is downplaying his possible change of heart. 
I'd be careful to read too much into that and tides turning. Congressman 
Shays has said he wants to meet with president to talk about this. 
The chief of staff John Podesta has already talked to him today. They 
have arranged for a meeting as early as Wednesday. It's important 
to listen to the concerns of congressman Shays and others as they 
come up and to work through them. But I remind you that he also said 
he still plans to vote against impeachment.
