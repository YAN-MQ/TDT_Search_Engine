Justice ministers from the eight major industrialized countries got 
together in high-tech fashion today and promised to use high-tech 
solutions to combat the sophisticated techniques of criminals who 
ignore international boundaries. The top law enforcement officials, 
including attorney general Janet Reno, discussed plans in a closed 
video conference rather than hold a meeting behind closed doors in 
London. They are already working with industries on preventing criminal 
use of the internet. We must not allow criminal minds and the pace 
of technology to outpace our law enforcement efforts. I'm also committed 
to continuing our joint efforts to ensure that criminals and their 
money enjoy no safe haven. The law enforcement leaders plan to meet 
face-to-face next year in Moscow.
