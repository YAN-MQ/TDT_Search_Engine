I'll be right back with some of this year's most interesting moments. 
Hi, pumpkin. It's late. You should be asleep. Mommy said that I could 
stay up until you got home. - oh. - What are you eating? - Cheerios. 
- For dinner? They taste just as good at night. And remember, I told 
you they were good for my cholesterol. Oh, yeah. An important new 
study shows... that three cups of cheerios whole grain oats a day, 
added to a low fat diet, can help push your cholesterol down. Do you 
know what else is good for my heart? - uh-uh. - a hug from you. The 
one and only cheerios did you know harsh winter weather can leave 
even unexposed skin itchy and dry? Did you know moisturizers aren't 
always up to the challenge of itchy, dry skin? That's why there's 
new cortizone 10 plus. Among these, only cortizone 10 plus has 10 
moisturizers, like aloe and vitamins, plus the power of cortizone 
10 to stop itch and help heal. So for itchy patches of dry skin, even 
eczema or psoriasis, try new cortizone 10 plus.
