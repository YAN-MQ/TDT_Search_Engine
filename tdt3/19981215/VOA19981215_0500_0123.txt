Palestinian National Council members meanwhile say it is time for 
Israel to recognize the Palestinian right to an independent state. 
Many council members made the comment Monday after acting in the presence 
of President Clinton to reaffirm nullification of anti-Israeli clauses 
in the PLO charter. Senior PNC member, Fasial Husseini says it's also 
time for Israel to stop creating new preconditions for it to comply 
with in regards to the Wye River peace accord mandates. Mr. Husseini 
said Mr. Clinton's call for each side to mutually recognize the aspirations 
of the other was addressed directly to the Israeli people.
