The attorney for Joe DiMaggio calls 84-year-old Major League Baseball 
legend a miracle man, after DiMaggio ordered his doctors on Sunday 
to stop giving public updates about his recovery from lung cancer 
surgery. Attorney Morris Englebert told the Associated Press DiMaggio 
looked great on Monday. He said DiMaggio talked with him about Sunday's 
National Football League games. Reports of DiMaggio's condition have 
fluctuated wildly over the past two weeks.
