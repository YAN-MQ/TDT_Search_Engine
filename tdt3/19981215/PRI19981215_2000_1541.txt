In other business news, a group of Native American leaders from Canada 
is in New York today, looking for investors to help create economic 
opportunities north of the border. Patrick O'Connell has more now 
from our business desk in New York. The Assembly of First Nations 
represents many indigenous peoples in Canada. Its national chief, 
Bill Fontaine, who's been in New York for meetings, wants to increase 
their economic muscle. He says there are genuine economic differences 
between native peoples in Canada and the United States. I would suggest 
that in Canada, we have a more diversely supplied economy. In the 
United States, as you know, there is a heavy concentration of economic 
activity to a casino, but that also, on one hand, provided greater 
economic clout to Native Americans than is the case in Canada. What 
would financiers, investors, banks, institutions, what would they 
get out of doing business with you? They'd have to look at us as a 
community that has access to land, labor, and in many cases, capital, 
and an enormous opportunity to do some major development work in terms 
of community infrastructure. We're certainly optimistic that we can 
put to good use, to good advantage our long history and traditions 
with the land and how and those resources are managed and the way 
that protects the interests of future generations and a bit fearful 
because of globalization and the implications for people that are 
not as well positioned as many of the major corporate interests. In 
March, the First Nations are sending a delegation to Mexico to talk 
to big business and to indigenous communities about expanding the 
business links that stretch from Canada through the United States 
and into Mexico. For THE WORLD, I'm Patrick O'Connell in New York.
