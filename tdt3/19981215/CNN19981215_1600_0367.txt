The chief U.N. arms inspector plans to give the U.N. secretary-general 
a Report today on whether Iraq has been cooperating with inspectors 
since they resumed work a month ago. At stake is whether the U.N. 
security council will conduct a review of its relations with Iraq, 
a process that could lead to a lifting of economic sanctions. Iraq 
recently halted three weapons inspections and has turned over only 
1 of 12 documents requested by inspectors.
