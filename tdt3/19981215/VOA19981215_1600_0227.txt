Angola's UNITA rebels have laid siege to a key central Angolan town 
defended by government forces cutting off air, road, and rail links. 
The fighting is at Quito which has erupted on Sunday and involves 
heavy artillery and anti-aircraft defense systems. Eight officials 
say the city could face a humanitarian disaster with more than 80,000 
people crowded into the town now seeking to escape the fighting.
