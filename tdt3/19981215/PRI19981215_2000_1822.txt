President Clinton is on his way home from the Middle East. He's had 
joint talks with Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu and Palestinian 
leader, Yasser Arafat. Hanan Ashrawri is a member of the Palestine 
National Council. She says there's little sign the meeting advanced 
the peace process. They succeeded at the bilateral level, Palestinian-American, 
but it was a real abysmal failure when it came to the peace process 
or to Israeli compliance. Unfortunately, he was faced with refusal 
to budge on the issue of Palestinian political prisoners, on the issue 
of the redeployment, and of course, the cessation of settlement activities. 
Hanan Ashwari.
