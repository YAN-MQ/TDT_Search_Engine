One of the world's largest suppliers of building materials settles 
a Billion-dollar lawsuit. I'm Jan Hopkins in New York with this edition 
of "Dollars & Sense." Owens corning has agreed to settle more than 
176,000 lawsuits resulting from its making of asbestos insulation. 
The Ohio-based company, which makes pink panther fiberglass insulation 
now, will make payments totalling $1.2 billion. A settlement resolves 
close to 90% of existing lawsuits against the company. They were filed 
by people who claimed exposure to asbestos made them sick. Owens corning 
stopped selling products containing asbestos in 1972.
