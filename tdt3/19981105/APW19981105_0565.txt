The European Commission _ the 20-member panel that goes to bat daily 
for a borderless European Union _ said Thursday it won't forego tax-free 
perks for itself even though duty-free sales will end in 1999 for 
most European citizens. European commissioners have generous allowances 
of tax-free purchases of tobacco, wine, spirits and car fuel each 
year because they have diplomatic status. EU transport workers unions 
are complaining because the commission is abolishing tax-free shopping 
for travelers within the 15-nation EU, yet its members will continue 
to enjoy benefits they deny other Europeans. All 20 commissioners 
_ minus Belgian's Karel van Miert because he's on home territory _ 
have the right to buy 60 liters of spirits, 400 liters of wine, 20,000 
cigarettes and 4,000 liters of car fuel tax free each year. ``We must 
keep things in proportion,'' EU spokeswoman Betty Olivi told reporters 
Thursday. ``European Commissioners enjoy the same benefits as other 
diplomats in Belgium.'' The issue has renewed a debate in Britain 
about the perceived aloofness of the European Commission from the 
average European. John Cryer, a Labor member of parliament, said the 
tax-free perks enjoyed by the EU executive were ``another example 
of, and reason why, everyone calls the European Commission the biggest 
gravy train in the world.'' Olivi said that although European commissioners 
_ who earn a minimum of dlrs 200,000 a year tax free _ are entitled 
to duty free benefits, not all make use of these.
