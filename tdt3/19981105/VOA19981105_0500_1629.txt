OK. So, you think about the 1970's. And what is it that stands out 
in your mind. That's a question that the United States Postal Service 
is asking the public. Anybody who cares to respond. They're planning 
to bring out a series of new postage stamps that commemorate the 1970's. 
So they've asked the public to vote on all kinds of things that they 
find meaningful about that decade. Whether it's personalities, events, 
or memories, what would be a good subject for a stamp? So, people 
have been choosing their favorite things from that decade. Right now, 
the strongest contenders appear to be Sesame Street, which is an acclaimed 
television show for children. But it first went on the air in late 
1969. And it seems to me, if you're going to be particular about it, 
you might as well just disqualify that one. But there's TV's comedy 
series All in the Family, that is going to get a stamp. That was a 
big cultural phenomenon of the time. Another one that is going to 
get a stamp is the 1970 yellow circle that resembles a smiling face. 
The smiley face and such. But, I don't know. Les, what do you think? 
Is that really a statement of the seventies? I hope not. I'm afraid 
I don't even remember the seventies. Well, it's not particularly, 
don't remember the seventies. I don't think we ought to pursue that 
question. Let's not go there. Let's talk about disco dancing. Polyester. 
Polyester. How about in really historical events, how about the end 
of the Vietnam war? Ah. That was probably the most historic. How would 
you.. There was the resignation of Richard Nixon. Let's not forget 
that one. That's true. You could put that on a stamp. But not the 
end of the Vietnam War. How would you put the end of the Vietnam War 
on a stamp? Too much to say there, too much to say.
