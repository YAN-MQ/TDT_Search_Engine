You're tuned to the Voice of America. We're coming to you from Washington 
on News Now. I'm Charlene Porter, along with Les Carpenter. Broadcasting 
from Washington. It is coming up now on 10 hours 18, Universal time. 
Here is the top story that we're following at this hour. Israeli Prime 
Minster Benjamin Nehtanyahu has submitted to his cabinet, the new 
interim peace deal with the Palestinians beginning the ratification 
process of the Accord. That debate is underway at this hour. We'll 
have further details later in the broadcast. That sporty music means 
it's time now for Sports. And with that, here is VOA's Jim Stevenson. 
Jim?
