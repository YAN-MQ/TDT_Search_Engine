President Vaclav Havel urged the government on Thursday to speed up 
integration attempts into the European Union, following EU criticism 
of Czech slowness in revamping legislation to conform to West European 
standards. The report on progress of candidate nations in adapting 
EU standards singled out the Czechs for their ``worrying slowdown.'' 
The Czech Republic, along with Hungary and Poland, are front runners 
among the former Soviet bloc countries hoping for membership. The 
report said that the Czech Republic, along with Estonia, Hungary, 
Poland and Slovenia ``are functioning market economies that should 
be able to cope with competitive pressures and market forces within 
the union in the medium term.'' But it noted that the Czech Republic's 
speed in enacting necessary legislation is not satisfactory. ``I expected 
such a critical report,'' President Vaclav Havel said, adding he asked 
the government to ``speed up steps that will lead to the fulfillment 
of EU's conditions.'' Former Premier Vaclav Klaus, the architect of 
Czech economic reform, suggested the report was biased, telling the 
daily Lidove Noviny: ``In some countries, there is a strong campaign 
against the enlargement of the EU.'' The Czech Republic is among six 
countries that are expected to join the EU in five or six years. Preliminary 
talks with Poland, Hungary, the Czech Republic, Slovenia, Estonia 
and Cyprus began this year and the EU also opened ``preparatory'' 
talks with Lithuania, Latvia, Slovakia, Romania and Bulgaria. The 
second group are nations facing a tougher job in improving their economies 
before serious membership talks can begin.
