The European Union on Thursday said it will resume reconstruction 
aid to Sarajevo after a months-long suspension, imposed to force authorities 
to speed up the repatriation of non-Muslims to the capital. The suspension 
was announced in July by the two main reconstruction funders, the 
United States Agency for International Development and the European 
Union. Construction worth dlrs 20 million was postponed in an attempt 
to pressure city officials to allow the return of some 20,000 non-Muslims 
to their prewar homes. The European Union lifted its construction 
aid moratorium on recommendation of Carlos Westendorp, Bosnia's senior 
international administrator. USAID was expected to follow suit. Under 
pressure from international officials, the Sarajevo government signed 
an agreement in March pledging to actively help the return of up to 
20,000 Bosnian Serbs and Croats to their prewar homes, now occupied 
by Muslims, by the middle of this year. Although still disappointed 
with the number of non-Muslims returning to the Muslim-held Bosnian 
capital, Westendorp decided to recommend the lifting of suspension, 
said a statement from his office. ``While estimates of how many minority 
returns have taken place vary, it is clear that return is happening,'' 
the statement said adding that the available housing space in Sarajevo 
needs to be expanded to make room for more returns. City officials 
argued the town was crowded by Muslim refugees from Serb-held areas 
and said return should go both ways, with Muslims also being allowed 
to settle in former home regions now dominated by Serbs. According 
to the independent International Crisis Group, fewer then 52,000 minority 
returns have been registered throughout the country since the end 
of war in 1995. In the Bosnian Serb part of the country, only 2,000 
non Serbs have come home. Westendorp said the authorities will have 
to redouble their efforts to reach the 20,000 minority returns goal.
