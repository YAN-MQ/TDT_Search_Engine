Late-night talk show host Jay leno cut up with the crew of the shuttle 
"Discovery" last night. Leno asked 77-year-old John Glenn if he had 
threatened to turn this space shuttle around and go home. "If these 
kids don't behave themselves." Glenn said his much younger colleagues 
were indeed behaving well. Leno also had a question for shuttle commander 
Curtis brown. Is it easier to suck your gut in when you meet attractive 
women? Does senator Glenn keep telling how difficult it was in the 
old days, how cramped it was, how lucky you punks are? Well, Jay, 
actually no. He doesn't always do that, only when he's awake. Astronauts 
also took time out from work yesterday to talk with Walter cronkite. 
Vice President Al Gore will call them today.
