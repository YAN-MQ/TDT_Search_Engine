Authorities in the United States and Canada are searching for a material 
witness who may know something about the shooting death of Dr. Barnett 
slepian. Ed Garsten reports. This is a picture of the individual we're 
looking for. The individual is James Charles kopp. Police have issued 
a warrant for him as a material witness in the October 23rd shooting 
of abortion doctor, Barnett slepian. Mr. kopp is being sought based 
on a sighting of a 1987 black Chevrolet cavalier, Vermont license 
plate bpe-216, in Amherst, New York, in the weeks preceding Dr. slepian's 
homicide. Kopp, who is from Vermont, has long been an activist in 
the anti-abortion movement and arrested several times. We believe 
that he has been associated with operation rescue for a long time, 
also with an organization called lambs of Christ. He also appears 
to have been alluded to in the army of God manual, which is a manual 
that was uncovered a couple of years ago. It's a how-to manual on 
how to do damage to abortion clinics and even to murder abortion doctors. 
At the clinic where Dr. slepian worked, neither kopp's name nor picture 
were familiar, but the announcement that he is being sought is seen 
as a sign that authorities are getting closer to the doctor's murderer. 
It gives the entire staff a lot of hope, that certainly shows that 
they're following through with all leads they have. And the fact they 
may have a suspect or certainly somebody that can aid in finding the 
suspect was just great. Police say the warrant will allow them to 
hold kopp until he gives them the information they believe he has 
on who murdered Dr. slepian. The biggest obstacle, though, is finding 
kopp. Authorities admit they have no idea where he is. Ed Garsten, 
CNN, Buffalo, New York.
