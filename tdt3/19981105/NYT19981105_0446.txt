Congress approved measures late Wednesday intended to reduce imbalances 
between the public and private pension systems, a major element of 
the austerity plan announced by the government last week. The vote 
was closely watched by the International Monetary Fund, which is working 
out the details of a $30 billion bailout for Brazil. Reducing pension 
inequities is the key element in a package the government hopes will 
restore the confidence of international investors. Fears have grown 
that Brazil's expanding debt may trigger a recession throughout Latin 
America. Finance Minister Pedro Malan took charge of presenting the 
reforms to the public and to Congress, preaching that civil service 
pensions, which are expected to run a $35 billion deficit next year, 
are draining the country. He said the imbalance between the systems 
was crippling Brazil: while $46 billion went to provide benefits for 
18 million workers in the private system, the government spent $33 
billion on pensions for fewer than 3 million retired public employees. 
The measure bases retirement in the private sector on the number of 
years a worker has contributed to the plan rather than on years worked. 
It also sets new minimum retirement ages in the civil service of 53 
for men and 48 for women, provided the men have paid into the pension 
system for 35 years and the women for 30 years. ``It signals in a 
very clear way that the government has the necessary majority to pass 
the fiscal adjustment measures,'' said Aecio Neves, the House leader 
of President Fernando Henrique Cardoso's Brazilian Social Democracy 
Party. Opposition leaders, however, argue that the government is unfairly 
penalizing civil service pensioners because of the economic crisis. 
As its currency has weakened, Brazil has raised interest rates, which 
has depressed growth. Olivio Dutra, governor-elect of Rio Grande do 
Sul state and a rising star in the opposition Workers Party, said 
the government should lower interest rates to help small and medium-size 
businesses. Government incentives for agriculture and small businesses, 
he added, would rebuild the tax base. ``The government is doing exactly 
the opposite,'' he said. The government failed to scrap the generous 
system of giving civil servants full salaries until they die. But 
the president is expected to issue an executive order next week that 
would require civil service pensioners collecting over $1,000 a month 
to pay up to 20 percent of their benefits back into the system. Riordan 
Roett, director of Latin American studies at Johns Hopkins University 
School of Advanced International Studies, said that while the vote 
Wednesday was encouraging, Brazil would have to do more to establish 
its credibility. Last year, he recalled, Cardoso's government announced 
a harsh austerity package to raise $18 billion, only to abandon most 
of it. ``People are more skeptical this time,'' he said. Cardoso dispensed 
with his trademark aloofness and openly pushed for his program, meeting 
with party leaders and sending telegrams summoning coalition members 
to vote. A bloc of 37 legislators representing agricultural businesses 
was promised by the government that it would delay repayment of more 
than $1 billion in farmers' debt in return for their votes, said Hugo 
Biehl, leader of the farmers' bloc in Congress. The government also 
granted farm businesses $280 million in concessions in exchange for 
their support.
