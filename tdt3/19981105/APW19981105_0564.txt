Married men who keep mistresses or frequent prostitutes could be sent 
to labor camps under new rules in one of China's most liberal cities, 
the official Xinhua News Agency reported Thursday. The rules _ contained 
in a directive issued recently to government departments in Guangzhou 
_ are intended to bolster marriage and protect the legal rights of 
women, Xinhua said. Cases in which married men ```cohabitate with 
concubines'' or otherwise `support mistresses''' are rising in the 
city, Xinhua quoted Ding Lu, head of legal protection for the government-backed 
All-China Women's Federation, as saying. Under the rules, married 
men who financially support mistresses or treat them as spouses will 
be charged as bigamists; they, along with patrons of prostitutes, 
could be punished by administrative sanction or sent to labor camps, 
Xinhua said. The report did not specify how long offenders would be 
held, but police have the authority to send criminal suspects to labor 
camps for up to three years without trial. Although jilted partners 
in a marriage may contact courts or police to punish their spouses, 
authorities may act even without receiving a complaint in cases ``deemed 
harmful to society,'' Xinhua said. Guangzhou is the capital of Guangdong 
province, which borders wealthy Hong Kong. A nearly 20-year economic 
boom has turned the city into a freewheeling center of conspicuous 
consumption for the newly wealthy. The moves to try to stem extra-marital 
affairs in Guangzhou dovetail with a national debate over revisions 
to China's marriage law. Earlier drafts of the revised law included 
such tough sanctions but drafters say many of the controversial measures 
have been dropped.
