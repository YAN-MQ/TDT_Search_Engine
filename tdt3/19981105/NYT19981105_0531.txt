Charles La Bella, the former head of the Justice Department's Campaign 
Finance Task Force, has been ordered by aides to Attorney General 
Janet Reno not to speak at two conferences on campaign finance law. 
La Bella has urged Ms. Reno to seek the appointment of an independent 
counsel to investigate accusations of campaign finance abuses in the 
1996 election. The attorney general has resisted naming an outside 
counsel for more than a year, although she is considering whether 
to seek independent prosecutors in three 1996 fund-raising controversies. 
She is expected to decide late this month or early December. Ms. Reno's 
aides said their insistence that La Bella refrain from public appearances 
reflected nothing more than the routine application of a rule that 
prohibits prosecutors from speaking publicly about high-profile cases. 
La Bella's allies maintained that the rule was not applied in all 
cases and complained that he was muzzled because his views were strikingly 
at odds with the conventional thinking in the Justice Department. 
In July La Bella sent Ms. Reno a memorandum advising her that the 
department should refer the entire campaign finance matter to an outside 
prosecutor. He then returned to the U.S. attorney's office in San 
Diego. In mid-October, the department told La Bella to withdraw from 
two speaking engagements at campaign finance conferences he had accepted 
months earlier _ one in Washington, sponsored by Congressional Quarterly, 
and another in New York City, sponsored by the New York City Campaign 
Finance Board and the Association of the Bar of the City of New York. 
``I regret having spent a year doing this and not being able to speak 
publicly,'' La Bella said in a telephone interview. In letters to 
the sponsoring organizations, he said he had planned careful remarks 
on campaign finance that were limited to the law and published court 
decisions. But he also said he ``understood'' the logic of the decision.
