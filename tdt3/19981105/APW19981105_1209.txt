The United Nations on Thursday detailed what it called horrific massacres 
of civilians in Afghanistan by the Taliban militia during its capture 
of a northern city in August, including mass suffocation, execution 
and torture. An estimated 4,000 to 5,000 people, including women, 
children and the elderly, were killed during the takeover of Mazar-e-Sharif 
_ either randomly shot or hunted down by Taliban forces, according 
to the report from a special rapporteur of the U.N. Commission on 
Human Rights. The slayings of Iranian diplomats by Taliban soldiers 
during the takeover prompted Tehran to beef up its military presence 
along the border and threaten military retaliation. The Taliban, in 
a response contained in the report, called the U.N. claims ``imaginary'' 
propaganda based on anecdotes, press reports and false opposition 
claims ``which only provokes baseless prejudices and brainwashes the 
people.'' The special rapporteur didn't visit Afghanistan because 
of security concerns, and so based his report on ``reliable sources'' 
_ a fact which led the Taliban to conclude that he hadn't verified 
any of the claims he had received. Mazar-e-Sharif had been a stronghold 
of the northern alliance opposed to the Taliban, which has conquered 
roughly 90 percent of the Central Asian nation and installed its strict 
brand of Islamic rule that forbids women from working outside the 
home. In the first week after the Taliban's Aug. 8 takeover, hundreds 
of people were summarily executed on the streets of the city or inside 
their homes. Still others were tortured to death. Others suffocated 
after being crowded into metal containers _ which were left in the 
sunshine during Afghanistan's harsh summer _ and transported to another 
city for questioning, the report said. ``One witness saw the opening 
of three containers carrying 120 persons, of whom only three had survived 
the trip to Shebergan,'' 80 miles (125 kilometers) west of Mazar-e-Sharif, 
the report said. One survivor had his fingernails torn out, the report 
said. Others were repeatedly beaten with steel cables. The United 
Nations has persistently criticized the Taliban's human rights record, 
but the details from the August massacres went far beyond the traditional 
U.N. complaints about the Taliban's restrictive treatment of women 
and girls. The report's author, Special Rapporteur Choong Hyun Paik, 
said he was ``horrified by the latest reports from Afghanistan, which 
are profoundly disturbing and indicate a worsening pattern of grave 
human rights violations.'' The scale of violations warrants the urgent 
attention of the world community, he said in urging a more thorough 
investigation of the slayings. The bulk of those slain in Mazar-e-Sharif 
_ an estimated 3,000 people _ belonged to the minority Hazara group. 
Surviving Hazaras, who are Shiite Muslims like most Iranians, were 
warned to practice the Sunni Muslim tradition of the Taliban if they 
wanted to survive, the report said. The report also detailed massacres 
of about 1,800 people carried out during the Taliban takeover of central 
Bamiyan province and surrounding areas, which also contain large Hazara 
communities. ``The pattern of the killings observed showed that men, 
women and male children were shot, while baby girls were kicked or 
beaten to death,'' the report said. The U.N. envoy for Afghanistan, 
Lakhdar Brahimi, recently visited the region and eased tensions between 
Iran and Afghanistan by securing the release of 26 Iranians in detention 
since the takeover of Mazar-e-Sharif. On Wednesday, he asked the Security 
Council to approve sending human rights monitors for Afghanistan to 
ensure that other massacres are prevented. The Taliban has agreed 
to an investigation of the massacres, but Brahimi told reporters Thursday 
that the United Nations is awaiting security guarantees.
