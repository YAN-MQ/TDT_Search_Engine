Good evening. We've seen some wild and dangerous weather in recent 
years, but a storm named "Mitch" is in a killer category all its own 
tonight. It's been rampaging across the Caribbean and gulf of Mexico 
for almost two weeks now, it leaves death everywhere. Today, Mitch 
plowed across south Florida with surprising strength -- eight inches 
of rain 70-mile-an-hour winds battered the keys, which still haven't 
recovered from hurricane georges six weeks ago. Mitch spawned several 
tornadoes, wrecking houses and boats. The gulf and atlantic coasts 
both took a heavy pounding from high surf before Mitch finally blew 
out to sea.
