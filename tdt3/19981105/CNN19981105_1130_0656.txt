A new survey shows drivers spend almost $6 billion a year on car problems 
caused by poor roads. At the same time, states spend less than $3 
billion a year fixing those same roads. The report comes four months 
after President Clinton signed a national transportation Bill calling 
for $167 billion in highway improvements. The survey concludes states 
will probably spend that money on new roads rather than repairing 
old ones. The worst states for potholes according to the report are 
Arkansas, maryland, Colorado, North Carolina and Oklahoma.
