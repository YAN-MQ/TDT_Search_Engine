The world number two tennis player Marcello Rios of Chile says he'll 
probably retire from the professional circuit in the next couple of 
years. After beating Spedia today, Rios told reporters that he thinks 
he'll just play a couple more years. The Chilean star says he want 
to do other things in his life in his late twenties. And that he would 
hate to look forward to playing for 10 more years and traveling 10 
more years. Rios, who turned pro in 1994, and briefly held on to the 
world number one ranking earlier this year, says he's sick of traveling. 
He says life on the road is a bore.
