Election night was a bit of a shocker for a lot of people on the unexpected 
democratic gains on Tuesday's elections aring a lot of republicans 
in the party to reassess. A lot are thinking about a change in leadership, 
perhaps. NBC's Gwen Ifill on house speaker Newt Gingrich's struggle 
to fend off another coup attempt. Hidden from public view from his 
suburban Atlanta home. Sources say house speaker Newt Gingrich worked 
the phones desperately trying to save his job. As frustrated republicans 
prepare to clean house in the weak of Tuesday's election losses, several 
says Gingrich has become his party's number one target. Things were 
happening out there none of us fully understood. I'm the speaker, 
I'll take responsibility. Many republicans are blaming Gingrich, using 
words like chaos and blood bath to describe what lies ahead. I think 
we have a problem from top to bottom. Lead areship takes credit when 
things go right. They ought to take the blame when things go wrong. 
And artfully sidestepping opportunities to endorse their leader outright. 
Also vulnerable on Capitol Hill's current vergeful mood, Gingrich 
deputies, dick Armey of Texas and John boehner of Ohio, competing 
to replace them some of Gingrich's political allies, chairman Bob 
Livingston of Louisiana who sources say he told Gingrich he should 
consider stepping down. Former football star Steve Largent, conservative 
caucus leader David mcIntosh of India a and Jennifer Dunn of Washington 
state. One republican who has tried to oust Gingrich has said more 
than one head should role. We are going to see dramatic changes and 
if we don't, I'm afraid the speaker and everybody else is in danger 
of losing their job. But other republicans predict Gingrich will survive. 
I think you'll see a lot of pushing and tugging and not much sugarcoating 
in the next 10 days. But they're going to come together after November 
16. That's when republicans meet to pick their new leaders. Livingston 
and Largent may mount a challenge tomorrow. Tonight the speaker's 
survival will be hand-to-hand combat as he fends off attacks from 
his conservative friends. Gwen Ifill, NBC news, the capitol.
