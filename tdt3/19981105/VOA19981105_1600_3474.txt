Halloween is over, but one couple in Minnesota will remember the holiday 
for a long time. Dan Brown and Brit Anderson were married on Halloween 
night. In a ceremony with a Halloween atmosphere. They exchanged vows 
at a Halloween theme park called Spooky World. The groom dressed as 
Frankenstein's Monster. With a ripped jacket, a rope as a belt, bolts 
in his neck. The bride wore a floor-length skirt and had lightning 
bolts running through her hair. The bridesmaids dressed as murder 
victims from the horror film, Prom Night. The best man was disguised 
as the Hunchback of Notre Dame. The wedding began with a funeral procession 
led by a hearse. The couple, not surprisingly, are horror movie fans.
