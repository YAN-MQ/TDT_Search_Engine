"No ifs, no ands and no buts about it." President Clinton warns Iraq 
to comply immediately with the U.N. security council resolution. They 
issued a demand today, that Iraq let inspectors do their work. But 
Iraq has already said it won't cooperate until economic sanctions 
are lifted. Gary Tuchman reports from the U.N. Will all those in favor 
please raise their hands? The U.N. security council's condemnation 
of Iraq's decision to no longer cooperate with U.N. arms inspectors 
was unanimous. From Asia -- Japan strongly regrets this decision. 
To Europe -- Expressing its views unanimously in this way, the council 
will demonstrate unity in the face of an Iraqi decision. To Africa. 
My delegates said they were very surprised by the decision. The council 
demanded that Iraq provide immediate, complete and unconditional cooperation 
with U.N. arms inspectors If Iraq does so, the council has spelled 
out it is ready to conduct a Review of Iraq's compliance under the 
resolutions and what steps need to be taken. This resolution contained 
no threats, but the United Kingdom and the United States made it clear 
they believe they have the right to pursue military action if necessary. 
I would also recall that both President Clinton and secretary of state 
madeleine Albright have emphasized all options are on the table and 
the United States has the authority to act. Any attempts to resolve 
the problem using force would entail dangerous consequences both for 
the kmasty to monitor military activity ies in Iraq and for peace 
and stability in the region. Now that the deal is broken, the security 
council is asking for continued assistance from Annan. But at this 
point the secretary-general has no plans to travel to Baghdad again.
