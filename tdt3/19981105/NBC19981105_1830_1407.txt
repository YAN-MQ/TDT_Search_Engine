One more note from the highway tonight. A new study on what it costs 
motorists to fix their cars, as a result of bad roads that cause auto 
damage -- a staggering $6 billion a year. At the same time, the government 
they're estimating. Spends half that amount per year to fix bad roads. 
The study says states should spend more on fixing existing roads and 
less on building new ones.
