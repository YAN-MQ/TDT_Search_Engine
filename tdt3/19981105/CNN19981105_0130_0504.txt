With a look at your "CNN Headline News Weather," I'm Karen Maginnis. 
Tropical storm Mitch just does not give up. And for Thursday morning, 
very early morning hours, look for between four and eight inches of 
rainfall in its wake across the southern portion of florida. So, localized 
flooding is possible as you head off to that rush hour traffic. Otherwise, 
high pressure dominates from the Great Lakes to the gulf coast and 
four corners region. A fairly strong frontal system for the pacific 
northwest means additional snowfall and lower snow levels. Expect 
temperatures 20s and 30s wrapped around the Great Lakes, the midwest, 
the northern tier states and into the Hudson bay region. 50s and 60s 
from the southeast all the way into central and southern sections 
of California. 84 degrees is the expected high temperature in Honolulu. 
And 38 expected in Anchorage. But above-normal temperatures in Barrow, 
Alaska. Coming up for Friday, the snow will begin to fly across the 
northern rockies. On Saturday, our weather system moves into the central 
plains. And by Sunday, more rain for the west coast. If it's weather 
information you're craving, log on to CNN.com.
