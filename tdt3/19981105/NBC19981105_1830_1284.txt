In California, officials are considering a major crackdown on the 
most popular vehicles to hit the road lately. Sport utility vehicles. 
It involves a new set of emission standards to cut down on air pollution. 
But how much will it cost all those SUV drivers out there? Here's 
NBC's Mike Boettcher. All vehicles are not created equal, but if the 
influential california air resources board has its way, they will 
be treated equally when it comes to pollution standards. Today's target 
at a raucous hearing -- popular sport utility vehicles, or suvs. For 
20 years, there's been a loophole that's permitted sport utility vehicles 
to pollute up to 2 1/2 times what regular cars are allowed to pollute. 
That's because SUVs were once considered work vehicles, not a Family 
car, today's primary use. Under the California proposal, which is 
expected to be approved tonight, new sport utility vehicles, vans 
and light trucks will have to be as clean-running as compact cars 
by 2004. Sport utility vehicles have become the station wagon of the 
'90s, so we can't ignore their contribution to the air pollution problem. 
SUVs account for 50% of new car sales in California, and much is at 
stake -- automakers' profits and consumers' pocketbooks. Technicians 
at the California air resources board say by installing a Larger catalytic 
converter and tinkering with the air and fuel mixture, sUVs can meet 
the stricter standards at an average cost of about $200 per vehicle. 
Opponents give a higher figure. It could be up to $7000 which would 
clearly be sticker shock for any consumer in California. And in the 
rest of America, since other states usually follow california's air 
quality standards. The question is, are there models that we may not 
be able to produce? The answer is that's probably going to be the 
case. Regardless, California pollution regulators believe clean air 
is worth the cost, no matter how steep. Mike Boettcher, NBC news,
