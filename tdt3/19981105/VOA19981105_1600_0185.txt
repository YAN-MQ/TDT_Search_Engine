of Mazeray Sharif and surrounding areas in August. A U.N. report says 
Televan fighters hunted down men, women, and children of the minority 
Shiite Hazera community. Killing as many as three thousand over several 
days. The report says the Televan also killed nearly two thousand 
others in and around Bomiad. The Televan deny the allegations as imaginary 
and propaganda based on opposition claims.
