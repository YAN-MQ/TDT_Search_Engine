Russian police have freed a Taiwanese fishing boat owner who was held 
hostage aboard the vessel by Chinese sailors demanding he pay their 
overdue wages, news reports said Thursday. The Fufang-2 boat, sailing 
under a North Korean flag, had arrived at Russia's Far Eastern port 
of Nakhodka for repairs. Its crew included 45 Chinese sailors, 10 
Taiwanese, 10 Burmese and 18 Russians and Ukrainians, the ITAR-Tass 
news agency reported. But it was the Chinese who incited the protest 
over the wage debt, ITAR-Tass said. The fishermen had threaten to 
stab to death their employer, identified as Lin Ziren, if he failed 
to pay the dlrs 100,000 he owed in back wages, the ITAR-Tass news 
agency reported. But Lin managed to send a distress message to the 
water police in Nakhodka. Twenty Russian police officers were sent 
to rescue him, and one policeman and one fisherman were lightly wounded 
during the operation, ITAR-Tass reported. The sailors retained control 
of the boat until the Chinese consul general from the regional center 
of Khabarovsk persuaded them to surrender Thursday, the report said. 
There was no word on whether any arrests or promises to repay back 
wages had been made.
