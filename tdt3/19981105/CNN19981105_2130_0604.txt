They're not computer experts, just people without jobs. But some welfare 
recipients have joined the battle against the year 2000 computer bug. 
Ann Kellan explains in today's edition of "tech trends." Don't laugh 
while you're saying your grace. Okay. Rosslin Davis, a widow, raising 
four children alone, worked as a Manager in a department store then 
lost her job. After I lost my job, I lost my house, couldn't afford 
to pay my bills. You want to get ready for school? Suzanne blevins 
was just as low. I'm divorced. I couldn't keep a job. I smoked crack 
cocaine and alcohol, and I've been clean now for over a Year. Two 
women on welfare, both determined to get off. They're part of an experiment 
called "tekaid." Combining the resources of mitretek, a technology 
think tank, Virginia tech, and government. The goal is to turn welfare 
recipients into computer programmers. After rigorous testing, including 
aptitude and personality tests, 51 welfare recipients were selected. 
Their next challenge -- pass two months of intense computer training. 
Take your resume. The culmination of all the work is a job fair. I've 
learned a lot as far as just a basic computer. Did any of them spark 
your interest? Yes, all of them. Every table I went to. Will there 
be any job offers made? Absolutely. We have an internship program, 
most of which is during the summer. There may be an opportunity to 
expand that program. Who did you talk to? Oh, I've talked to so many 
different people. And I'm really excited. huh? I don't care. I know. 
Suzanne blevins' hard work paid off. She accepted a job with computer 
science corporation. It's helped me to find a better career so I can 
become self-sufficient. I want kisses. Rosslin Davis got a job offer, 
but because of the location, turned it down, and is interviewing for 
other jobs. Her children, she says, are as excited as she with her 
progress. I promised my son Joshua when I started that every day I 
would teach him what I learned. And we've been doing that every night, 
I've taught him, so he's going to be the youngest Y2K programmer ever.
