Joining us this evening to talk about the latest developments, what 
the U.S. might have in mind militarily, Daniel goure, former deputy 
director of political-military studies at the center for strategic 
and international studies with us tonight from Washington. And, Dan, 
what will be in it for the U.S. in this case. Are we not into Di minnishing 
returns here? We've done this before. Well, clearly there's not much 
to be gained in the broader context. The allies are not really with 
us, it's been clear. The French are opposed and the Russians are pofede 
and seen the Saudis. We're not getting support for military action. 
And what do you expect will happen, let's say a volumey of 15 to 30 
cruise missiles. What is our expectation from the Iraq government? 
The only expectation we could have is it's treated as a shot across 
the bough. We did this and now if you don't give in you'll force us 
to go to the next step and that's when the stealth fighters come into 
the neater. Will we go to the air, do you think, or will it be all 
from offshore? I can't see why if we're talking about limited strikes 
it won't be all offshore. There are probably 100 to 150 cruise missiles 
in the area. That's more than enough to send a message to Saddam. 
How much do they cost a piece and what would be on the target list? 
Those missiles, depending on when they were bought and what's in them 
cost anywhere from about $400 to three quarters of a million dollars. 
You're talking about an expensive set of joy rides. What they will 
go after is fixed commander control sites where the military and Saddam 
Hussein runs things. They will go affair defenses and radars and possibly 
a few military depots, arms and mue in addition depos. When those 
blow up, everybody notices it. In the gulf war, "the U.S. news" reported 
the U.S. went after Saddam and didn't put it that way. Do you think 
the same could be true in this case? I doubt in this case although 
the same logic could apply. He's considered to be a commander control 
target, not a person or leader and then we could shoot at him. We 
still have the problem we want him to tell the people to return to 
the status quo. We can't do that if he's dead. We may be calling Owen 
and your expertise in the days to come.
