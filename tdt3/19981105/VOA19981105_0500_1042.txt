The National Basketball Association Player's Union and team owners 
have broken off talks after heated arguments in New York. The owners 
were reportedly upset by comments made by Player's Union head Billy 
Hunter. In which he said rumors of an agreement to end the player 
lockout were greatly exaggerated. On Wednesday, Hunter said the two 
sides had not even talked with each other, so sitting in the meeting 
room was useless. NBA commissioner David Stearn says the higher-paid 
players are blocking the negotiation process. The two sides have been 
at odds since July about players' salaries and team revenues. The 
owners say player salaries are outrunning revenue. The players say 
they ought to be able to make as much as the market will allow. The 
lockout has led to the cancellation of the first month of the regular 
NBA season.
