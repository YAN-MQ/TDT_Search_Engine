The Royal Dutch-Shell Group of Cos. said Thursday that quarterly profits 
fell by 56 percent as it suffered the effects of depressed oil prices 
and the recession in the Asia-Pacific region. The Anglo-Dutch oil 
giant reported net income of dlrs 841 million, or 25 cents a share, 
for the three months ending Sept. 30, compared with dlrs 1.9 billion, 
or 60 cents per share, in the same period a year earlier. Quarterly 
revenues fell 21 percent to dlrs 33.1 billion, from dlrs 41.9 billion 
a year ago. For the first nine months of the year, Royal Dutch-Shell 
reported net income of dlrs 4.3 billion, or dlrs 1.14 per share, down 
by 31 percent from dlrs 6.3 billion, or dlrs 1.79 per share, in the 
same period a year earlier. Revenues for the nine-month period came 
to dlrs 103.7 billion, down 19 percent from dlrs 128.4 billion. Lower 
crude oil prices and gas extraction significantly hurt earnings in 
exploration and production, the company said. Oil production fell 
by 1 percent and gas sales fell by about 4 percent compared with the 
same period last year. Although the company sold 1 percent more oil 
products than they did this time last year, earnings were hit by lower 
profit margins on refining, the company said. Profits in the chemicals 
division were also hit by the Asian recession, the company said. They 
were down 90 percent to dlrs 27 million, from dlrs 284 million during 
the same period last year. For the first nine months of the year, 
earnings from chemicals were down 30 percent to dlrs 489 million from 
dlrs 701 million.
