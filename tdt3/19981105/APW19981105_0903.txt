Most high school students chose to hit the books instead of the streets 
Thursday, as low turnout in a third round of nationwide marches signaled 
a weakening of their fledgling movement. Only about 2,600 students 
marched through Paris, police said, in a sharp contrast to two separate 
protests last month in which hundreds of thousands poured into the 
streets. Some 10,000 marchers had been expected Thursday. Outside 
the capital, turnout was also low. Police said 1,500 students marched 
in both Lyon and Bordeaux, while smaller groups gathered in Toulon, 
Nice, Grenoble and Rennes. With French police in riot gear lining 
the boulevards, the Paris protest was calm, lacking the violence that 
marred previous marches. Students carried banners and linked arms, 
but the mood was largely subdued. ``We're here to show solidarity,'' 
said Jonas Pariente, 16, who marched in Paris. ``We still have complaints, 
but it may be the last march.'' The students are protesting overcrowded 
classrooms, outmoded equipment, a lack of teachers and other conditions 
they say leave them badly prepared for the future. But a school vacation 
appeared to take the wind out of the movement. ``This is without a 
doubt the last protest,'' France Info radio said. Following last month's 
protests, Education Minister Claude Allegre announced the addition 
of thousands of new teachers and assistants. Still, many students 
remain skeptical that the ministry's plans, which also called for 
new equipment and a lighter work load, are sufficient to improve conditions. 
``We have 35 students in every class, and that has to change,'' said 
Guillaume Thfoin, 17, who goes to school in Savigny-sur-Orge south 
of Paris. ``We started something, and now we want to finish it,'' 
said Aline Doussin, 16, a Paris student. ``Allegre only gave us half 
of what we asked for.'' Already France's biggest budget item, education 
funding is limited by the leftist government's desire to remain qualified 
for the euro single currency that debuts at the end of the year. Last 
month's protests disintegrated into violent rock-throwing demonstrations, 
resulting in injuries and property damage. Much of the violence was 
caused by youths from troubled suburbs who were not connected to the 
protests. Anticipating further violence, police banned street parking 
as of Wednesday evening, and some merchants shuttered their shops 
along the march route from the Montparnasse train station to the Education 
Ministry.
