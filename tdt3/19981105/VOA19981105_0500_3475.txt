Well, we're sneaking up on 11 hours, Universal time. And that means 
it's time to say farewell, so long. I'm sorry, that's my rendition 
of the Sound of Music. It's goodbye, anyway, to listeners in the Americas. 
Until midnight, Universal time, when VOA News Now resumes on 5.995, 
6.13, 7.405, 9.455, 9.775, 11.695, and 13.74 MHz. In East Asia, VOA 
News Now continues on 5.985, 6.11, 9645, 9.76, 11.705, 11.72, and 
15.425 MHz short-wave plus 15.75 kHz medium wave to Southeast Asia. 
We have the point, we'll see you later. It's 11 hours, Universal time. 
From Washington, this is VOA News Now. Israeli Prime Minister Nehtanyahu 
submits to his cabinet, new interim peace deals with the Palestinians. 
Saudi terrorist Osadam Benlauden and some of his top aides are indicted 
by U.S. officials in connection with the bombing of U.S. Embassies 
in Kenya and Tanzania. Tuesday's U.S. Congressional midterm elections 
may bring more than just some new faces to Washington. Our national 
correspondent will explain. I'm Les Carpenter. I'm Charlene Porter. 
These stories, sports, business news, and some old style singing. 
From a barbershop, no less. All in this hour of VOA News now. Singer 
Peggy Lee did her own arrangement for that. That was recorded in 1989. 
Of course, it is an updated version of her 1958 hit: Fever. We certainly 
wish the best to Peggy Lee, who has suffered from Diabetes and other 
health problems over the years. This is Border Crossings, I'm Judy 
Massings, we look forward to having you join us again tomorrow. Bye 
everyone. It's 21 hours, Universal time. From Washington, this is 
VOA News Now. President Clinton warns Iraq there is international 
support for any action necessary to end the standoff over U.N. weapons 
inspections. Analysts continue to review the results of Tuesday's 
midterm elections in the United States. We'll talk to an analyst who 
will tell us what they could mean.
