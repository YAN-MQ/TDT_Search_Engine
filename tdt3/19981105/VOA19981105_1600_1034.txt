This is the Voice of America. Coming to you from Washington. I'm Tony 
Riggs, along with Kent Kline. Bringing you this hour of VOA News Now. 
It's 21 hours 18, Universal time. Making headlines at this hour, President 
Clinton warns Iraq, there is international support for any action 
necessary to end the standoff over U.N. weapons inspections. We'll 
have details on that and other stories in the news during our next 
news summary. Beginning in 11 minutes. Now it's time for Sports. And 
here's Steve Shies. Thank you very much, Kent.
