Lawyers who are seeking to overturn a High Court ruling made last 
week that granted Gen. Augusto Pinochet freedom from arrest argued 
Thursday that legal decisions around the world had long denied people 
charged with crimes like genocide and torture the protection of sovereign 
immunity. ``Concepts of crimes against humanity including torture 
and hostage taking were established in international law before the 
military regime took power in Chile in 1973,'' said Christopher Greenwood, 
a lawyer for the Crown Prosecution Service. Greenwood represents the 
Spanish authorities who have brought charges of mass murder against 
Pinochet, the former Chilean dictator. Such crimes fall within ``universal 
jurisdiction,'' he said, and could be tried by national courts regardless 
of the nationality of the person charged or where the abuses occurred. 
Greenwood cited inquiries and tribunals that had judged atrocities 
committed as long ago as World War I and as recently as in the conflicts 
in Rwanda and the former Yugoslavia to argue his point that people 
who had committed crimes even ``under the color of authority'' could 
not avoid prosecution. Earlier, another lawyer, Alun Jones, had argued 
that there was an inherent contradiction in providing immunity to 
people charged with genocide. ``It is almost in the nature of genocide 
that it tends to be committed by people in positions of power and 
holding offices of state,'' Jones said. The High Court ruled a week 
ago that Pinochet, 82, is immune from arrest and prosecution because 
he was head of state when the crimes that he is charged with were 
committed. He was arrested here on Oct. 16 on a request from Baltasar 
Garzon, a Spanish magistrate who is investigating atrocities in the 
``dirty wars'' in Latin America in the 1970s and '80s. The Spanish 
authorities hold Pinochet responsible for the deaths of more than 
3,000 people, including Spaniards, Britons, Chileans and other Latin 
Americans. He is under police guard at a secluded hospital in North 
London, recovering from back surgery. The setting Thursday, the second 
day of the hearing, was a genteel one for a discussion of genocide, 
torture and crimes against humanity. The lawyers were dressed in wigs, 
high collars and black robes, and addressed the judges as ``your lordships'' 
and one another as ``my learned friend.'' The case is being heard 
by a five-member panel of the Lords of Appeal, the highest court in 
England, in a plain committee room off a Gothic inner court of the 
senior chamber of the Parliament. The Law Lords were unable to complete 
the hearings Thursday as they had hoped, and the appeal will resume 
on Monday. The afternoon session concluded with the beginning of a 
presentation by Prof. Ian Brownlie, an expert on international law. 
He has argued on behalf of Amnesty International; the Redress Trust; 
the Medical Foundation for the Care of Victims of Torture; the two 
sisters of William Beausire, an Anglo-Chilean who ``disappeared'' 
during the Pinochet government; and Dr. Sheila Cassidy, a British 
doctor who was tortured in Chile. If the Law Lords rule in the general's 
favor he could leave the country at once, and separate moves by Chilean 
exiles in Europe and by other European governments to seek his extradition 
to Belgium, France, Germany, Italy, Luxembourg, Sweden and Switzerland 
would most likely fail. A Chilean Air Force ambulance plane has been 
waiting at Brize Norton Royal Air Force Base in Oxfordshire for a 
week, ready to transport him promptly if he is freed. The advocacy 
director of Human Rights Watch, Reed Brody, said Thursday that the 
European Court of Human Rights in Strasbourg had rebuffed a petition 
by his organization to request the United Kingdom to continue to detain 
Pinochet pending a new appeal there.
