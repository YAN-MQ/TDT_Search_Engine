The creator of the batman comic series, Bob kane, is dead. His attorney 
says the 83-year-old kane died of natural causes. In 1939, "Batman 
And Robin" first appeared in print. The characters and their enemies, 
including the Riddler, the Joker and Mr. freeze, were turned into 
a TV show in the 1960's and a hit movie series in recent years. Kane 
worked as a creative consultant on all the batman movies.
