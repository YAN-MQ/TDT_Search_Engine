This is meteorologist Valerie Voss with your "CNN Headline News Weather" 
forecast for Friday. As what is left of tropical storm Mitch zooms 
rapidly to the northeast, off the east coast of the U.S., cool, high 
pressure sinks into the southeastern United States. A winter storm 
will move into the northern rocky mountains as another area of low 
pressure brings showers and mountain snow into the northeast. Highs 
on Friday, just 20s and 30s from the northern Rockies to northern 
New England. We'll see 50s and 60s across the south, some 70s in the 
extreme south. Looking ahead to Saturday, look for snow across the 
northern Rockies pushing out into the plains states with rain in the 
northwest. Then on Sunday, snow moves toward the Great Lakes with 
thunderstorms farther south and rain moving into northern and central 
California. For Monday, heavy snow through the mountains of the west 
with windy wet weather in the northern plains. A mix of rain and snow 
in the northeast and rain across much of California. Don't forget, 
you can find four-day forecasts for more than 7,200 cities at cNN.com.
