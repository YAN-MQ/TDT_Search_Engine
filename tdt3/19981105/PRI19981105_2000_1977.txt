India and Pakistan have resumed talks in Delhi but appear to have 
made no progress on the issue of sharing water resources. India wants 
to build a dam across a river which flows through the disputed Kashmir 
region to make it navigable in the dry season, but Pakistan says that 
would violate a treaty. The two sides are due to discuss other key 
issues during their week-long talks, including trade and resumption 
of bus services. From London, you're listening to THE WORLD.
