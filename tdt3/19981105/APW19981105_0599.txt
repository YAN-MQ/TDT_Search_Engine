Greece on Thursday expressed pleasure that Turkey was defrosting its 
relations with the European Union, but warned its neighbor that membership 
was still far off. ``This is a very positive step,'' said Foreign 
Minister Theodoros Pangalos. ``It is also very positive for Turkey 
as its relations with the EU had worsened.'' Turkey's foreign minister 
said his country's relations with the EU will improve following a 
European Commission report on the progress of candidate countries, 
which included Turkey. Ankara essentially froze its relations with 
the EU last December after the Union to exclude Turkey as a candidate. 
``Turkey has for a long time gained the right to be an member of the 
EU,'' Pangalos said. ``We have always supported Turkey's European 
orientation.'' Pangalos also added that Greece did not think that 
Turkey's predominantly Muslim population was a problem. ``Islam already 
exists in the EU. There are already six to seven million Muslim citizens 
of Europe, so for me and my government this is not a problem,'' he 
said. But Pangalos said Turkey must still take steps to improve its 
record on issues such as human rights and respect some EU decisions 
``on good neighborly relations, respect for international law, and 
to cooperate in solving the Cyprus problem.'' Turkey, Pangalos said, 
also has to recognize the general jurisdiction of the International 
Court of Justice at the Hague. This would help its EU aspirations, 
but also solve many longstanding problems with Greece. ``If it accepts 
this, then there will be not just one dialogue, but thousands,'' Pangalos 
said. Greece and Turkey have many longstanding disputes over the Aegean 
Sea. Athens has said it is willing to take some to the international 
court, whose jurisdiction is so far not recognized by Turkey.
