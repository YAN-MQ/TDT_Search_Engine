Richard Virenque, the French cyclist who has been embroiled in a doping 
scandal since the Tour de France, will no longer ride for Festina, 
according to reports Thursday. ``Our paths are separating,'' Festina 
executive director Gines Gorriz said in an interview with French daily 
Le Figaro. ``We do not want to work with cyclists still under a judicial 
procedure.'' ``Festina is not saying that Virenque was doped. No one 
can say if he is guilty or not, only him,'' Gorriz said. Ex-Festina 
team doctor Eric Ryckaert and former masseur Willy Voet have both 
recognized the use of banned doping products within the team, but 
Virenque still denies he knowingly took such substances. Festina said 
another reason for the split was that Virenque refused a 75-percent 
cut in salary. Gorriz said Festina offered a salary of three million 
francs (dlrs 545,000), which represented the 75-percent salary cut. 
Laurent Brochard, Didier Rous, Christophe Moreau and Pascal Herve 
will continue to cycle for Festina.
