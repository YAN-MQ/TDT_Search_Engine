Good evening. Our first tow major stories tonight are about priorities. 
We begin in Washington, where republican politicians now understand 
all too clearly how strongly much of the public feels about impeachment 
hearings involving President Clinton. So our first report is from 
ABC's Linda Douglass. Members of the house Judiciary committee are 
gritting their teeth as they face the unpopular task of impeachment 
hearings. This is a constitutional challenge. I wouldn't say I'm fed 
up with it. I would say I'd like to have it behind me, but I think 
we have a duty to proceed and we're going to. Chairman Hyde promised 
to move fast, calling just one major witness, independent counsel 
Kenneth Starr. He is anxious to testify. He is the center of this 
inquiry in terms of directing the office of the independent counsel. 
Hyde challenged the president to keep the process short by answering 
a list of 81 questions raised by the Starr report. They do not focus 
on sex but things like whether Mr. Clinton tried to keep monica Lewinsky 
quiet by buying her gifts. Do you admit or deny you gave the following 
gifts to Lewinsky? Hyde hinted that the president's failure to answer 
the questions could itself be an impeachable offense. But after Tuesday's 
election, Mr. Clinton doesn't seem worried about any of it. The American 
people sent a message that would break the eardrums of anyone listening. 
They want their business tended to. Many congressional republicans 
think they are under more pressure from a public fed up with peach 
because GOP leaders failed to focus attention on anything else. Some 
members blame Newt Gingrich for that, and want him to pay by forfeiting 
his job as speaker. Linda Douglass, Capitol Hill.
