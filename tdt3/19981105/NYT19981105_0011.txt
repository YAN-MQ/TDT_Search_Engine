The scoring-challenged New York Rangers have been looking for that 
new face who can put the puck in the net, and they found him on Wednesday 
night at Madison Square Garden. He was Jose Theodore, the masked Montreal 
goalie, who accidentally put one over his own goal line when he tried 
to clear a loose puck that had trickled behind him into the crease. 
Unfortunately for the Rangers, that was the only time the red light 
ignited behind the goalie in the red uniform. At the other end of 
the ice, it flashed four times and the Canadiens emerged with a 4-1 
victory. Three of the goals beat Rangers goalie Mike Richter, and 
the final goal was into an empty net. With all those trade rumors 
circulating in the boo-filled Garden, can help be on the way? Can 
any of those locked-out basketball players skate? ``We can't wait 
for somebody who is coming,'' said John MacLean, who got credit for 
the Ranger goal after his shot trickled through the pads of the goalie 
and came to rest in the crease before Theodore mis-hit it. ``We've 
got to work doubly hard or harder just to keep it going.'' It was 
the second consecutive defeat for the Rangers, who had three victories 
and three ties in their previous six games. Averaging 1.5 goals a 
game, lowest in the NHL, they are last in both the Atlantic Division 
and the Eastern Conference. Their record is 3-6-3 and they will spend 
most of November on the road, playing in Florida, California and in 
the Rust Belt. Their next game is Saturday night in Toronto. Montreal's 
goal scorers were Shayne Corson, Mark Recchi, Martin Rucinsky and 
Vincent Damphousse. Recchi scored on the power play. The Rangers were 
0 for 4 on their manpower advantages and managed only 20 shots on 
goal. They hit two posts and fired several wide. The line of MacLean, 
Kevin Stevens and Esa Tikkanen was most effective. Hoping to encourage 
more offensive production, Rangers Coach John Muckler shuffled his 
other forward lines. He moved Niklas Sundstrom off Wayne Gretzky's 
left wing and put him alongside center Todd Harvey, who had been Gretzky's 
right wing. Gretzky was flanked by Adam Graves and Mike Knuble. P.J. 
Stock, usually a fourth-line center, got more ice time than usual 
because Harvey spent time in the penalty box after two fights. The 
second, with Craig Rivet, left Harvey with blood on his right hand. 
Manny Malhotra, the rookie Rangers center, who had not dressed for 
three of the previous four games, played a few shifts and was effective, 
finishing his checks at every opportunity and nearly scoring on a 
deflection. Muckler admitted he sounds ``like a broken record,'' but 
said the Rangers need to get their shots through from the point men 
on the blue line and need to hit the net more instead of missing it 
or hitting the posts. ``I don't think the pressure mounts to add a 
proven goal scorer,'' Muckler said. ``I still don't think our hockey 
team's that bad offensively.'' Brian Leetch, the captain, said, ``We're 
a better-scoring team than we are right now.'' MacLean warned, ``You 
can't get down on yourself because you start squeezing your stick 
and then you don't shoot, you don't do what you should be doing.'' 
Speaking of not shooting, Gretzky and Leetch each had one shot on 
goal, same as Malhotra. They played 23 minutes 51 seconds and 28:26. 
Malhotra played 2:06. Sundstrom had none in 16:10. The Canadiens, 
without a victory in their previous four games, played without Saku 
Koivu, their best player, who is out with an abdominal injury that 
could be serious. A similar injury has cost them Scott Thornton for 
the season. Defenseman Vladimir Malakhov blocked a puck in the final 
minute and crawled off the ice. But he said he was all right.
