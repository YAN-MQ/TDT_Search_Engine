Defender Christian Panucci scored two goals as defending champion 
Real Madrid hammered Sturm Graz 5-1 on Wednesday to storm to the top 
of Group C of the Champions League. The match had been postponed from 
Wednesday because of a waterlogged field and heavy rain. Mario Haas 
headed Graz into an early lead in the third minute. But it took only 
five minutes for Real to reply, with the Italian international Panucci 
also scoring with a header in the eighth to equalize. Real went ahead 
for good in the 35th on a free kick goal by Yugoslav striker Predrag 
Mijatovic. Clarence Seedorf, a Dutch World Cup star, made it 3-1 in 
the 57th and Panucci added his second four minutes later. Davor Suker, 
the Croatian star who was the top scorer at this summer's World Cup, 
notched Real's fifth in the 74th. With three victories form four matches, 
Real leads the group with nine points, two more than Spartak Moscow 
and Inter Milan. Graz is still without a point after four matches. 
A crowd of 14,500 saw the match in the Arnold Schwarzenegger stadium. 
Real had beaten Graz 6-1 at home and has scored 11 goals in two matches 
against the hapless Austrian champion.
