Israel's Cabinet met today to debate the latest agreement with the 
Palestinians. Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu said he's confident 
the 17 members of the Cabinet will approve the deal, but he told reporters 
that the Palestinians still must meet some conditions if an Israeli 
withdrawal is to begin on November 16th. The Cabinet isn't considered 
likely to vote on the agreement before tomorrow and may take until 
Sunday to make its decision. Netanyahu told the Cabinet that Jewish 
settlers in the West Bank will be given a say in what areas would 
be handed over to Palestinian control.
