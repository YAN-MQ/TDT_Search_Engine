Referendums on Tuesday's ballots to fund new stadiums for the National 
Football League's Denver Broncos and Major League Baseball's San Diego 
Padres have been approved by voters. Perhaps spurred by the recent 
success of both teams. Voters approved Referendum 4-A in Colorado 
and Proposition C in San Diego, California. Pat Bolen, the owner of 
the Superbowl champion Broncos, called it a great decision for the 
citizens of the region. As the sixth county Denver Metropolitan area 
gave Referendum A a 57 to 42 percent victory. Almost 60 percent of 
the voters in San Diego approved Proposition C, which will provide 
a new home for the National League Champion Padres. Both ballot issues 
will generate millions of dollars to help pay for the stadiums.
