First fighting has continued into a second day in Tajikistan, where 
government forces are confronting rebels in the north of the country. 
The rebels oppose last year's peace agreement to end Tajikistan's 
civil war. Luisa Delgo reports. Automatic rifle and rocket fire sounded 
across the center of Hojand. Government troops have cut off roads 
to the main administrative center in an attempt to surround rebel 
units to seize control of several key buildings. Soldiers of the presidential 
guard said a battle for control of the interior ministry building 
had raged all night before it was finally retaken. Local residents 
were bewildered at the sudden turn of events which has brought fighting 
to Tajikistan's northern industrial heartland for the first time. 
Luisa Delgo, BBC News, Tashken.
