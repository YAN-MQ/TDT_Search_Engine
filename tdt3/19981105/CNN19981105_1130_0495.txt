Mitch moving away now from Florida. Still some lingering rains, but 
the heavier rain and wind should be pushing off towards the atlantic. 
We are looking for high pressure to build into the east. That will 
dry things out as it remains stormy in the west and the air cold enough 
that we could see significant snows in parts of the Rockies and through 
the cascades of Washington and Oregon as we head on over the next 
24 hours. Temperatures today, they're quite cold. 20s for high temperatures 
over parts of the dakotas and Minnesota today. Even cold down to the 
gulf coast, with some forecast highs today only into the 50s. The 
extended forecast for the weekend, could see some heavy snows in parts 
of the northern Rockies and northern plains on Saturday with cold 
temperatures moving in. It stays rather cool, too, in portions of 
the northeast. On Sunday, snow through the northern Great Lakes as 
a new system moves into northern California, bringing with it rain. 
We'll see some gusty winds through the northern Rockies and scattered 
thunderstorms will affect the southeast. On Monday, a new storm in 
the west, more heavy snows as temperatures remain cool to the north.
