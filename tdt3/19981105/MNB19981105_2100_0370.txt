This latest crisis in Iraq gives President Clinton yet another international 
diversion. Rumors flying out of the Pentagon of a cruise missile attack 
in the planning stages on the very day when the president gets a rocket 
from Henry hyde on the hill asking him what's the truth in the Monica 
matter. Well, today the man in charge of the hearings, congressman 
Henry Hyde of illinois, presented the White House with a letter intended 
to speed up the process, asking the president literally to confirm 
or deny a list of 81 separate allegations. NBC news White House correspondent 
Claire Shipman tonight with more on chairman Hyde's latest move. Hyde 
unveiled his schedule for the hearings today, announcing he hoped 
to have the inquiry wrapped up by the end of the year and that he'll 
only call one major witness, Ken Starr. With the president's cooperation, 
we will meet our goal of finishing by the end of the year. The cooperation 
he's looking for is an answer to this letter. In it, 81 questions 
which he says, if answered, will avoid a long fight over details. 
The first few questions make clear the committee is pursuing the issue 
of perjury. Do you admit or deny that you are the chief law enforcement 
officer of the United States of America? And other questions seem 
to focus on obstruction of justice. Do you admit or deny that on or 
about January 9, 1998 you received a Message from Vernon Jordan indicating 
Monica Lewinsky had received a job offer in New York? None of the 
questions specifically concern the president's sexual relationship 
with Lewinsky. Democratic sources speculate Hyde believed that would 
not go over well with the public. The president would say little about 
Hyde's schedule. I have nothing to say about that. I want these hearings 
to be constitutional, fair, and expeditious. Behind the scenes the 
president's legal team is weary. They like the timetable but would 
prefer to reach some deal to avoid any vote on impeachment. In terms 
of the letter, we're told the president and his legal team plan to 
answer that as soon as possible, probably in the next few days. But 
we're also told by one aide the president will not admit to anything 
that amounts to perjury or obstruction of justice. Claire Shipman, 
NBC news, the White House.
