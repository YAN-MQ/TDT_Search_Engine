Encouraged by the Pinochet case, a Cuban exile group filed a suit 
before a Spanish court Thursday accusing Fidel Castro of genocide, 
terrorism and torture. ``Spain's National Court has ruled that it 
is competent to investigate crimes of genocide, terrorism and torture 
in the case against Pinochet,'' said Guillermo Alonso Olarra, a lawyer 
for the Miami-based Foundation for Human Rights in Cuba. ``This case 
is identical.'' The foundation said the suit was inspired by a National 
Court decision last week that gave Spanish Judge Baltasar Garzon a 
green light to try to bring former Chilean dictator Augusto Pinochet 
to trial for crimes committed during his 1973-90 regime. Garzon had 
Pinochet arrested in London last month as a first step toward his 
extradition. The case is pending in Britain's House of Lords after 
a court there ruled that Pinochet was entitled to immunity as a former 
head of state. Alonso said they had submitted papers to Spain's National 
Court detailing the cases of some 120 people who allegedly suffered 
torture or other abuses by Castro's government, were executed or died 
while in Cuban jails or in police custody. The lawyers added that 
the suit also included the names of 18,000 people who they say were 
killed or disappeared in Cuba since 1959 when Castro took power. ``Spain 
has opened the door to the victims of Argentina and Chile,'' Clara 
Maria del Valle, vice president of the foundation, told a press conference 
in Madrid. ``Today we come to knock on the door of Spanish justice 
in the name of the victims the crimes of Fidel Castro.'' Alonso said 
last week's Spanish court ruling accepted that the definition of genocide 
could include ``the elimination of a social group, which is the case 
in Cuba.'' Most of the 18,000 on the list are Cubans but there are 
also several people of other nationality including North Americans 
and Spaniards, Alonso said but was unable to give a precise breakdown. 
The court is likely to name a judge to review the case by the weekend 
who in turn should decide whether there is sufficient evidence to 
warrant a formal probe within the next two weeks, said Javier Barrilero, 
another lawyer for the foundation. Earlier Thursday, Spanish Foreign 
Minister Abel Matutes said the ``the case had no chance of succeeding'' 
given that Castro was a head of state and entitled to diplomatic immunity. 
Alongside Castro, those accused include his brother Raul, Cuban Tourism 
Minister and former army commander Osmani Cienfuegos and Carlos Amat, 
Cuba's ambassador in Geneva and also a former military member. Once 
case cited in suit was that of a raft carrying 72 Cuban would-be exiles 
which was allegedly rammed by Cuban police boats on July 13, 1994 
leading to the drowning of 41 people, mostly women and children. ``I 
demand justice in my name and that of my son, for the murder of our 
family, and the punishment of those to blame for this massacre,'' 
a tearful 42-year-old Sergio Perodin told the press conference. He 
and another son survived the incident but he lost his wife and his 
eldest boy. The Foundation for Human Rights is part of the Cuban-American 
National Foundation, a Miami-based group vehemently opposed to Castro. 
It is well funded by Cuban exiles living in Florida and politically 
influential both in that state and in Washington.
