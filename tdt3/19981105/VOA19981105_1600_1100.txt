The National Basketball Association Player's Union and team owners 
have broken off talks after heated arguments in New York. The owners 
were reportedly upset by comments made by Player's Union Head Billy 
Hunter. In which he said rumors of an agreement to end the player 
lockout were greatly exaggerated. Wednesday, Hunter said, sitting 
in the meeting room was useless because the two sides were not talking 
with each other. NBA Deputy Commissioner Russ Granick says he does 
not understand why players are reluctant to take the league's offer. 
Whether they would vote for it or not, out of concern for the high-end 
salary players, I don't know. But for the vast majority of players, 
it would be hard for me to conceive of any reason why they would not 
endorse this deal. At least as it would effect them over the next 
six years. The two sides have been at odds since July. About player 
salaries and team revenues. The owners say players' salaries are outrunning 
revenue. The players say they should be able to make as much money 
as the market will allow. The lockout has led to the cancellation 
of the first month of the regular season.
