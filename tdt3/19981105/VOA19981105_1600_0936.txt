Tropical Storm Mitch is soaking Florida today. With an estimated 20 
centimeters of rain as it moves across the state and into the Atlantic 
Ocean. When it was Hurricane Mitch, it devastated parts of Central 
America. Seven thousand are believed dead in Honduras alone. From 
flooding and mudslides. Nicaragua's U.S. Ambassador Francisco Ogaris 
Secasa told NBC News that the situation in his country is very grim. 
We have the potential for three thousand to thirty-five hundred people 
killed in the country. Including the number that are missing right 
now. Many of whom I think are buried under six feet, 18 feet of mud 
near the Casitas Volcano. We have 700 thousand people who are homeless, 
that's 15 percent of our population. Beyond the human tragedy, we 
have tremendous damage to our economy. We're a poor, small country. 
We have over 100 bridges that were washed out because of the tremendous 
rains from Hurricane Mitch. Just repairing those bridges and the roads 
that have been damaged is going to cost us easily $50 million. Nicaragua's 
ambassador to the United States, Francisco Ogaris Secasa.
