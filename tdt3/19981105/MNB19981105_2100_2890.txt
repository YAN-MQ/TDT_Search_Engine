Interesting story out of California tonight where just like everywhere 
else, SUV'S' rule the road. But they're preparing a crackdown in that 
state because of what they do to the environment. Here is Mike Boettcher. 
All vehicles are not created equal, but if the influential California 
air resources board has its way, they will be treated equally when 
it comes to pollution standards. Today's target at a raucous hearing, 
popular sport utility vehicles. For 20 years there's within a loophole 
that's permitted SUV's to pollute up to 2 1/2 times what regular passenger 
cars can pollute. That's because SUV'ses were once considered work 
vehicles and not a family car, today's use. Under the California proposal 
which is expected to be approved tonight, new sport utility vehicles, 
vans, and light trucks will have to be as clean running as compact 
cars by 2004. SUV's have become the station wagon of the 1990's, so 
we can't ignore their con triwution to the air pollution problem we 
have in California. SUV'ses account for 50% of new car sales in California 
and much is at stake. Auto makers profits and consumers' pocket books. 
Tech nippingses at the California air resources board say by installing 
a Catalytic converter and tinkering with the fuel and air filter they 
are able to meet the standards at a cost of $200. Opponents give a 
higher figure. It could be up to $700 which would be sticker shock 
for any consumer in california. And in the rest of the America, since 
other states usually follow california's air quality standards. The 
question is are there modeling we may not be able to produce? The 
answer is that's probably going to be the case. Regardless, California 
pollution regulators believe clean air is worth the cost, no matter 
how steep. Mike Boettcher, Los Angeles.
