Republicans are engaged in public and private hand wringing two days 
after the election. Some in the GOP are demanding new leadership, 
but House Speaker Newt Gingrich says no one in America can make sense 
of Tuesday's results. NPR's Elizabeth Arnold reports. Some Republican 
House members say Speaker Newt Gingrich should be ousted in the wake 
of Tuesday's election. Looking for a sacrificial lamb, Gingrich is 
the first to be offered up. Others, however, point to the head of 
the Republican campaign fund-raising and strategy, John Lindor. Lindor 
says his committee raised and spent more money directly on races than 
its done in history. Lindor had predicted a net gain of a dozen seats. 
The GOP lost a net five seats. As Gingrich prepares to beat back a 
coup, other factions of the party are weighing in. Christian conservatives 
blame the party for not emphasizing social issues, and fiscal conservatives 
argue the GOP passed an $80 billion tax cut but let it be stalled. 
The exit polls indicate voters weren't interested in abortion or tax 
cuts. Education was at the top of their list. Elizabeth Arnold, NPR 
News, Washington.
