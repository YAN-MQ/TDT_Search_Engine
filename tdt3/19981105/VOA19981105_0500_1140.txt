The first of seven non-PGA golf tournaments gets underway Thursday. 
As Mark Kalkaveckia defends his title at the Serazin Open in Georgia. 
Kalkaveckia shot a tournament record 17 under par, 271 last year. 
His score included a course record 10 under par 62 in the first round. 
Kalkaveckia says getting an early lead was a big help. A big lead 
now for the first day is great. If you have a good day. And honestly, 
to keep, after the second day, the third day, and to win the thing. 
I just got off to such an unbelievable start there shooting 62. That 
I just kind of kept it going from there. Also participating in the 
tournament will be Americans John Huston, Scott Hope, Scott Verplane, 
Payne Stuart, and two time winner Frank Naballo of New Zealand. Naballo 
says the tournament just does not get the attention that it deserves. 
It is important for golf, that type of event. Because of what it does 
and what it stands for. And just because it fits on the end of the 
tournament, it involves a lot of foreign players. And America doesn't 
necessarily get the same press it deserves. The tournament will be 
played on the Par 72 Chateau Elan Course in Braziltown, Georgia. First 
prize is $360 thousand.
