CNN has learned attorneys for Paula Jones have presented president 
clinton's lawyers with a new settlement offer. They're asking for 
$950,000 to drop their client's sexual harassment suit. But sources 
say the president's attorney, Bob Bennett, has rejected the offer 
and restated a standing offer of $700,000. Jones' attorneys rejected 
that offer. That may not be the only problem for Jones. Sources say 
her attorneys have given her written notice they will cease to represent 
her once an appeals court rules on reinstating her case.
