Glasgow's Rangers ousted Bayer Leverkusen _ the last German team in 
the UEFA Cup _ drawing 1-1 Thursday to advance to the third round 
on a 3-2 aggregate. Rangers took a 1-0 lead in the second-round, second-leg 
match on a 56th minute goal by Jonatan Johansson, but Leverkusen evened 
in the 78th with substitute Thomas Reichenberger scoring. With Rangers 
advancing, it means no German team will be in the UEFA third round 
for the first time since 1967-68. Stuttgart and Werder Bremen were 
elimianted Tuesday when 15 of the 16 matches were played.
