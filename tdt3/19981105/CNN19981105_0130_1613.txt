People meet in some unusual ways. And that's certainly the case for 
one of Hollywood's toughest tough guys and his bride to be. Actor 
Chuck Norris is marrying a woman who introduced herself to him by 
sending him a topless photo. "The daily news of Los Angeles" reports 
Norris will marry Gena O'Kelley over Thanksgiving. The 59-year-old 
actor is the star of "Walker, Texas ranger." He could not be reached 
for comment.
