The United Nations security council is expected to bring more pressure 
on iraq to comply with U.N. arms inspections. But the resolution up 
for a vote today does not threaten force for failure to cooperate. 
It does refer to past resolutions that promised the "severest consequences" 
for noncompliance. Last Saturday, Iraq once again halted its cooperation 
with U.N. weapons inspectors. This isn't the first such dispute over 
inspections, but the United Nations is reacting sternly. This appears 
to be possibly the most serious confrontation of the security council 
by Iraq that we've yet seen, because they've moved on from attempting 
to stop our disarmament work to now making an attack upon the monitoring 
system. That is the long-term system that would see that they don't 
reconstitute these weapons after they've been disarmed. So it's serious.
