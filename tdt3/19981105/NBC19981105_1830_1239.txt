The crew of the shuttle "discovery" is winding down, getting ready 
for landing Saturday. Here on earth, the wife of John Glenn told reporters 
she's been overjoyed to see him looking so strong and healthy in zero 
gravity. He looks like a young man. He looks great. He's not 77. The 
night before he blasted off, John Glenn gave his wife a gift, a pack 
of gum, a tradition going back to his days as a test pilot. The Glenn 
family will break it open next week when he comes home.
