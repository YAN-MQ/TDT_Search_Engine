For THE WORLD, this is Alan Dow in the BBC Newsroom in London. Washington 
has announced a $70 million aid package for Central America to help 
overcome the devastation caused by Hurricane Mitch. U.S. aid will 
begin an airlift of $20 million in food and emergency supplies this 
weekend. Spokesman Brian Atwood says this is only the first step in 
the relief effort. The first response is pure humanitarian relief, 
trying to save lives and to avoid disease from coming into this area, 
and to provide some emergency shelter. The second phase will be to 
assess the reconstruction needs. U.S. aids spokesman Brian Atwood.
