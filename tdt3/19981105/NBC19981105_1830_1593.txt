Tonight, hoop dreams and making them come true on a reservation in 
Arizona. One of the greatest basketball players ever taking his knowledge 
to a Remote place and sharing his game with the kids of a tribe. It's 
a world away from the spotlight at center court. 13,000 apaches at 
the white mountain reservation. A place of little opportunity and 
lots of drugs and alcohol. But it's also a place rich in pride. A 
place oddly filled with hoop dreams. There it is! There it is! And 
perhaps new hope. Kareem Abdul-Jabbar, NBA hall of famer, the game's 
all-time leading scorer has landed here in remote northeast Arizona. 
He's the high school's new assistant coach. We were surprised at first. 
Like, some of us didn't think it would happen. I've been trying to 
get into coaching now for a couple of years. And I've prepared myself, 
but the NBA was not hiring. So it was like being all dressed up with 
nowhere to go. a one stop light town. Abdul-Jabbar came here to research 
a book on the black cavalry, the so-called "Buffalo soldiers," and 
learned something unexpected. "These people here are that crazy about 
basketball?" That shocked me. Get the shot. You're on defense. But 
Abdul-Jabbar says he was most drawn to the team because of a Shared 
past. The reservations have a lot in common with the part of the world 
where I come from, New York's inner city. A lot of the problems there 
are the same problems that you have on the reservation. This is what 
you got to learn. This is why we got you practicing this. Problems 
basketball can help kids escape. Most of the kids have quit that I 
know that have done drugs. They stopped and started playing basketball 
a lot more now. His game plan, stress fundamentals for the court and 
beyond. His salary for the season just $1. To help people in similar 
circumstances makes me feel good. And with all he brings to the reservation, 
the man who racked up more than 38,000 career points just scored another. 
Good hands! Good hands! Kelly O'Donnell, NBC news, Los Angeles.
