No other candidate in Connecticut had a tougher time getting on the 
ballot than Denise Nappier. She had to battle for her party's nomination 
for state treasurer at the Democratic convention this summer, and 
then fight a rematch in the September primary. Then on Tuesday night, 
when most other candidates left post-election parties knowing their 
fates, Ms. Nappier still had to wait _ her race was too close to call. 
It was not until late Wednesday night that she was named the winner 
in her race, defeating the current state treasurer, Paul Silvester, 
by 2,810 votes and depriving Gov. John Rowland of any Republican company 
among the top state offices. ``I have a renewed appreciation for the 
Democratic process,'' Ms. Nappier said Thursday as she finally savored 
her victory. ``I liken it to the volatility of the market.'' For the 
last nine years, Ms. Nappier, 47, has had to deal with market volatility 
as treasurer of Hartford, overseeing the city's pensions and bond 
offerings. Now she assumes the job at the state level, handling the 
state's $17 billion pension fund. The presence on the ballot of Ms. 
Nappier, who is black, was a major goal this year of Rep. Barbara 
Kennelly, who was ultimately unsuccessful as the Democratic candidate 
for governor. After the Republicans nominated two Hispanic candidates 
and a black candidate for their ticket, Rowland began trumpeting his 
party's leadership as the most diverse. With the backing of Mrs. Kennelly 
and black leaders, Ms. Nappier won a close vote at the convention, 
over Frank Lecce, an Italian-American who had spent two years lining 
up support for his candidacy. Lecce stormed out of the convention 
and challenged Ms. Nappier in the primary. Despite being outspent 
by Lecce, she won handily. ``She had to struggle from the beginning,'' 
said the Rev. Wade Hyslop, Jr., the deputy speaker of the state House 
of Representatives and an early supporter of Ms. Nappier. Ms. Nappier 
said her biggest problem in the election was raising money, in part 
because of a law blocking employees of companies doing business with 
the state from contributing to the treasurer's race. In Hartford, 
she said, many potential contributors were middle managers in financial 
service companies who cannot contribute to campaigns. Ms. Nappier 
said she held a $15-a-person fund-raiser for her neighbors, but many 
could not come because of the law. ``It's hard to believe that because 
someone gives you $15,'' she said, ``you are going to give them a 
$50 million contract.''
