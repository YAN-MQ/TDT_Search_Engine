Today's geography puzzler begins with a bang. It's a night of fireworks 
and bonfires in Britain tonight as folks celebrate Guy Falks Day. 
And what a guy he was. This 17 century Catholic Yorkshireman gained 
fame for failure and being arrested in the cellar of the House of 
Lords. That's right, the cellar. And therein lies the tale. Surrounded 
by 36 barrels of gun powder, Falks, apparently a rather explosive 
type himself, was scheming to blow up King James and his entire parliament 
for their refusal to ease up on repressive anti-Catholic policies. 
Upon Falks' arrest, the parliamentarians were so full of joy that 
they weren't blown up. They declared the day a national holiday. Ever 
since the nation celebrated by burning bonfires, lighting fireworks, 
and even in some spots, burning effigies of a nonspecific pope as 
a way to mark Falks' big failure. The biggest celebrations of all, 
however, are in his hometown just south of London. It also happens 
to be the place American revolutionary Thomas Paine lived, wrote, 
and got married. Your mission is to tell us the name of the town known 
for its native son's big flop. We'll tell you in just a flash.
