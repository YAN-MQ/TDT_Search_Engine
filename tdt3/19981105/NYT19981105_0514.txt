John Updike has lived in Massachusetts so long _ more than four decades 
_ that it is hard to remember he was born and raised in eastern Pennsylvania. 
This area is, he says, still his emotional and literary home, the 
setting of his four ``Rabbit'' books and the yeasty source of much 
of his keen observation of the American middle class. As he once wrote 
of Shillington, the farm town 30 miles southwest of here where he 
spent his early years, ``I love Shillington not as one loves Capri 
or New York, because they are special, but as one loves one's own 
body and consciousness, because they are synonymous with being.'' 
Updike was back for a two-day visit this week to read from his work 
at Lehigh University here and speak to a class studying his work. 
It was a visit filled with the poignancy and irony that permeate his 
writing, at once a victory lap for an esteemed man of letters and 
an encounter with a generation that does not tend to view high-minded 
writers as cultural heroes. He said being back in the area had a slightly 
unreal quality, as if time was stretched. He took note of the solid 
church spires rising from Bethlehem's russet countryside, the diner 
where his sandwich cost $1.75 and the rusting hulks of steel that 
evoke a time memorialized in his early novels. Bethlehem, whose steel 
works used to employ 30,000, is trying to turn its old steel mills 
into a museum of industrial history in cooperation with the Smithsonian 
Institution. The changing face of American industry is not a foreign 
theme to Updike, whose character Harry (Rabbit) Angstrom got rich 
when U.S. car buyers turned suddenly to Toyotas in the 1970s. Dressed 
in gray flannel slacks, penny loafers, tweed jacket and striped tie, 
Updike, 66, sensed there was something quaint, if not strange, about 
his presence at the seminar, attended by a dozen students. ``I must 
seem like a dinosaur,'' he said by way of self-mocking introduction. 
``You study it but you don't expect it to show up in your classroom.'' 
Updike's appearance was especially charged because the title of the 
class is, ``Should John Updike Be Awarded the Nobel Prize?'' and the 
professor, Jack De Bellis, is among the most knowledgeable and obsessed 
of Updike's devoted readers (he himself calls it ``my gentle madness''). 
``Jack knows more about me than I know about myself,'' Updike said 
with a twinkle, deferring to De Bellis about a character in an early 
Updike story. De Bellis, 63, has published an Updike bibliography 
_ no mean feat given the prodigious Updike output of stories, novels, 
poems, essays and other writing _ and is completing an 800-page Updike 
encyclopedia with plot summaries, descriptions of characters and personal 
and historical background. De Bellis also has one of the world's most 
extensive collections of Updikeana, including scores of signed books 
and a 1968 cover of Time magazine with a painting of a sandy-haired, 
turtle-neck-clad Updike, who had just published the best-selling and 
then-shocking novel ``Couples.'' So there the two sat in class, the 
author and his chronicler, a Philadelphia native who has spent the 
last 30 years here, with their matching mops of unruly hair, finely 
pointed noses and light Pennsylvania accents, as Updike defended himself 
against accusations from students that the women in his fiction lacked 
substance and that he wrote of incest to shock and sell books. ``No, 
I don't think women are dumb,'' Updike said, his face mottling pink 
over traces of psoriasis, a condition he painstakingly described in 
the essay, ``At War With My Skin.'' On incest, he replied: ``All love 
comes from the family. Yet it is an effort to break out of the familiar, 
to become intimate with another, to reconstruct the cuddling, the 
tickling and the comfort. It is part of being human. Eros is everywhere. 
It is what binds.'' On his hopes and chances for a Nobel Prize, Updike, 
who has won nearly every major American literary award, including 
the Pulitzer, tried to be dismissive without being disrespectful. 
``Some Greek leader was once asked why there was no statue to him 
in the town square,'' he told the students. ``He replied that he would 
rather people ask why there isn't one than why there is one.'' But 
Updike has clearly given the question some thought. His latest book, 
``Bech at Bay,'' his third about Henry Bech, a Jewish-American writer 
who serves as a satirical alter ego, ends with Bech collecting the 
prize in Stockholm as the surprise winner from a split Nobel committee. 
``I thought that by giving the prize to Bech I could end the speculation,'' 
he offered. ``It seems to me that the Nobel committee is not in search 
of aging, white Western men these days.'' On Tuesday night, Updike 
gave what he called ``an all-Pennsylvania reading'' of poems and stories 
to a packed audience of several hundred. He selected a story from 
his previous Bech book, ``Bech Is Back.'' In it, Bech finds himself 
in Pennsylvania being paraded around a small university. While in 
the area, Bech visits Marvin Federbusch, a collector of Bech books 
whose voice and manner seem an odd mirror of the fictitious author's. 
And so the inside laughter rang out as a number of those present recognized 
their colleague, De Bellis, as Updike's own Federbusch. The line was 
long for those seeking a signature. Most of the seekers were middle-aged. 
For the students, the visit was not like, as Bech had described in 
that story, ``a god descending _ whimsical as Zeus, radiant as Apollo.'' 
It was interesting, they said, to see the man in the flesh. But they 
were not in awe. ``I think what writing was in his era, television 
and MTV are to ours,'' said Dennis Zehner, a senior from nearby Allentown. 
``Today, writing is like everything else, a commodity.''
