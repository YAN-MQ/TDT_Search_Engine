When we come back, NBC news "in depth." A stunning medical breakthrough. 
Creating lifesaving cells that someday will treat killer diseases. 
Experts say babies who get held a lot grow faster. That the touch 
of a hand can lower someone's blood pressure. That smiling releases 
helpful hormones. At Cigna healthcare these are all sound, scientific 
reasons for our particular way of doing things. It's called "caring." 
And that should lower everyone's blood pressure. Eating quaker oatmeal 
on a daily basis... can help lower cholesterol. Mine dropped 29 points. 
That's one under the speed limit here in Lafayette, Colorado. Just 
a reminder. There are those among us with very simple tastes. They 
only want the best. And for them there's fancy feast gourmet cat food. 
Exceptionally moist and delicious. Fancy feast.
