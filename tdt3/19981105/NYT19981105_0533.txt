The frenetic Madison Avenue takeover spree keeps going and going and 
going as yet another well-regarded independent agency is being acquired. 
In the latest deal, the acquisitive Interpublic Group of Companies 
said that as expected it had bought Gillespie in Lawrenceville, N.J. 
Though terms of the deal were not disclosed, trade publications estimated 
the purchase price at $20 million. As part of the deal, which is expected 
to be formally announced Thursday, Gillespie _ an integrated marketing 
communications agency that is best known for its direct-marketing 
capabilities _ will keep its name and operate as an autonomous unit 
in Interpublic's McCann Relationship Marketing Worldwide network of 
agencies, part of the McCann-Erickson World Group unit. ``This partnership 
will provide new opportunities to accelerate our growth by providing 
current and future clients with access to a worldwide network of offices, 
increased research capabilities and highly sophisticated resources 
in areas such as the Internet and Web commerce,'' said Dick Gillespie, 
president and chief executive of Gillespie, which is formally called 
the Gillespie Organization. The transaction is the most recent example 
of a trend in which small and midsized independent shops are being 
rapidly snapped up by larger agencies. Other recent examples include 
the acquisition of Hampel/Stefanides in New York by Envoy Communications 
Group in Toronto and Margeotes/Fertitta &AMP; Partners in New York, 
which sold a majority interest to the MDC Communications Corp. in 
Toronto. Gillespie, 54, who will continue to head the agency in his 
current roles, said that since last spring, Gillespie had received 
seven acquisition offers from a wide range of domestic and international 
communications companies. ``We never were for sale, but the offers 
kept coming,'' Gillespie said. ``The Interpublic and McCann-Erickson 
alliance makes great sense, because it will help us meet our long-term 
agency goals more quickly.'' Those goals include one that Gillespie 
set last year to build the shop's billings $500 million. Gillespie, 
founded in 1973 by Gillespie with $1,500 in start-up capital, has 
grown into a shop with 135 employees and an estimated $140 million 
in billings from clients including American Reinsurance, Cushman &AMP; 
Wakefield, Elizabeth Arden Red Door Salons and Janssen Pharmaceutica. 
Besides direct marketing, the agency offers a wide spectrum of services 
including traditional advertising, branding, data-base marketing, 
public relations, event marketing, corporate design and interactive 
marketing. ``We made an extensive search of what independent agencies 
remain at this point,'' Stan Rapp, chairman and chief executive of 
McCann Relationship Marketing, said. ``We identified Gillespie as 
the best agency, because they weren't just focused in one area. They 
bring considerable experience across a diverse number of business 
categories.'' Rapp said that over time Gillespie had ``demonstrated 
again and again that brand building and the best result-generating 
communications beautifully complement one another.'' ``This is a perfect 
fit with the network we are building around the world,'' he said. 
The Gillespie acquisition is the seventh for the McCann Relationship 
Marketing unit since it was formed in January 1997 as the successor 
to McCann Direct. The acquisition comes just a week after it expanded 
its overseas operations by acquiring agencies in Australia, Japan 
and Spain with estimated combined billings of $60 million. Rapp said 
the agency planned to continue to grow by opening additional offices 
in Chicago and Los Angeles, in addition to announcing the acquisitions 
of five more agencies, primarily in Europe and Latin America, by the 
end of the year. ``We are not just snapping up agencies,'' he said. 
``We are very carefully approaching and merging with agencies that 
will meet our strategic goals.'' ``The emergence of a globalized network 
digital economy sets the stage for a future in which one-to-one relationship 
marketing becomes the dominant force in marketing communications and 
becomes the fastest-growing segment in the agency business,'' he said. 
``So, everybody is positioning themselves for that future.'' McCann 
Relationship Marketing has 700 employees in 36 offices in 30 countries 
and billings estimated at $610 million from clients including General 
Motors, Mastercard International and Sprint. Rapp said the agency 
planned to expand the network by 1999 to $1 billion in billings.
