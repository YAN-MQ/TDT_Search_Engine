Afghanistan's Televan Faction has denounced a $5 million reward offered 
by the United States for the arrest of Osama Benlauden. Calling it 
"an inducement to terrorism." A Televan spokesman said Washington 
has failed to give any evidence to support its allegations against 
Benlauden. Who is living in Afghanistan as a guest of the Televan. 
On Wednesday, U.S. Federal authorities charged Benlauden and one of 
his top aides, Mohammed Atif, in the deadly U.S. Embassy bombings 
in Kenya and Tanzania.
