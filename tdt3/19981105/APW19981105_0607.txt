A top U.S. envoy, in an abrupt change of plans, Thursday returned 
to Zambia in a continuing bid to end a three-month war in Congo that 
has embroiled troops from at least eight countries. Assistant U.S. 
Secretary of State Susan Rice has acknowledged that she had achieved 
little so far on her seven-nation tour to persuade outsiders to withdraw 
from Congo. ``We are encouraged by the recognition of all those with 
whom we talked that there can be no viable military solution, and 
by the expressed desire for peace,'' Rice said before leaving Entebbe 
for Lusaka. ``However, we remain concerned about the continued buildup 
of military forces, which underscores the importance of moving forward 
to find a peaceful solution.'' Zimbabwe has sent 6,000 troops and 
an air force to prop up Congolese President Laurent Kabila. Angola 
and Namibia also sent troops and tanks to help stop rebel advances. 
Despite denials from the Ugandan and Rwandan governments, their troops 
repeatedly have been seen fighting on the rebels' side. U.S. diplomats 
said Rice, who already has visited South Africa, Angola, Congo, Zambia, 
Zimbabwe, Uganda and Rwanda, had a hard time convincing the countries 
supporting Kabila that the United States was impartial in the conflict. 
Rice said she delayed plans to return to Washington to travel to Lusaka 
to share her findings with Zambian President Frederick Chiluba, a 
leading mediator in the Congo conflict. Two rounds of peace talks 
hosted by Chiluba have failed, and he is sympathetic to Rice's mission. 
Other leaders have asked him to arrange talks leading to direct negotiations 
between Kabila and the rebels. On the last scheduled stop of her tour, 
Rice met with Ugandan President Yoweri Museveni in Entebbe for two 
hours Wednesday night. In a statement issued Thursday, Museveni said 
he told Rice the conflict ``can and will be resolved,'' and that a 
cease-fire was possible. Earlier Wednesday, Rice met with Congolese 
rebels and Rwandan officials. ``We had a frank exchange of views,'' 
said Ernest Wamba dia Wamba, leader of the rebel Congolese Democratic 
Coalition. ``The Americans listened to our concerns, and we hope the 
contacts will continue.''
