Foreign Secretary Robin Cook issued a fresh warning Thursday that 
Iraq faces the ``severest consequences'' if Saddam Hussein does not 
back down in the latest standoff over U.N. weapons inspections. Although 
a U.N. Security Council resolution condemning Saddam did not specifically 
authorize military force, Cook said legal authority exists for airstrikes 
if inspectors are not allowed to resume their work. ``We are quite 
confident that if it comes to that, there is adequate legal basis 
for us to proceed,'' Cook said in a British Broadcasting Corp. interview. 
``All options are open.'' Iraq's decision Saturday to end all cooperation 
with disarmament monitors has been condemned by the Security Council 
as a ``flagrant violation'' of the country's agreements with the world 
body. On Wednesday, U.S. Defense Secretary William Cohen lobbied Gulf 
states for support of possible military action. British Prime Minister 
Tony Blair, addressing a group of students Thursday, also spoke of 
the government's readiness to use military force against Saddam if 
necessary. ``The reason that we are supporting the U.S. and the U.S. 
is supporting us is because we believe in what we are doing in relation 
to Iraq,'' Blair said. ``The international community must be prepared 
to act, if necessary by military force, to stop him.'' Cook said that 
while the current emphasis is on a diplomatic solution to the crisis, 
U.S.-led forces assembled in the region in February remain ready to 
strike. The United States has some 24,000 troops, more than 20 warships 
and about 170 warplanes and helicopters in the Gulf region, according 
to the Pentagon.
