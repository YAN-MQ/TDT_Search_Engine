That's "Dollars & Sense." Back to you, Chuck. Thanks, bev. "Headline 
Sports" is next. If you looked into your local carrier's phone lines 
what time period would they place your company in? Why live in the 
past... when local's future is right through here? On-net. Where local, 
national and global all flow over one network, owned by one company. 
Oh, and did I mention... it'll save you money? On-net. From MCI Worldcom. 
Mo wants to stay. I'm Anthony Keith James and this is "CNN Headline 
Sports."
