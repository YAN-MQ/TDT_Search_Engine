Five days before the curtain goes up on ``The Radio City Christmas 
Spectacular'' and the theater already smells like a barnyard. Ted 
the donkey, Nina the camel and other domesticated stars of the show's 
``Living Nativity'' scene are camped out in a room just off stage 
right, and an odor common to rural environs is wafting among the electricians, 
dancers and dwarfs who are scurrying about for an impending dress 
rehearsal. Red strobes flash, warning the company that a swath of 
Radio City Music Hall's massive stage is about to drop 40 feet. Spangled 
Rockettes nervously tap out their moves in the wings while a prop 
master checks to make sure that the giant bow-tied gifts, plywood 
reindeer and a cradle holding baby Jesus (it's just a doll) are ready 
to go. ``Minutes of boredom separated by seconds of sheer terror,'' 
mutters Eric Titcomb, who operates the three stage elevators, a revolving 
turntable and the Music Hall's legendary ``dancing curtain,'' a three-ton 
bolt of fabric whose contours are shaped by 13 separate motors. Except 
for the crackling of walkie-talkies, the hurly-burly backstage has 
changed little since 1933, when the theater impresario S.L. (Roxy) 
Rothafel first staged this sequin-encrusted Christmas pageant for 
a city numbed by the Depression. Since then _ notwithstanding a 1978 
brush with extinction _ the ``Christmas Spectacular'' has become one 
of the nation's most enduring extravaganzas and, like yellow cabs 
and dirty-water hot dogs, an unmistakable _ if slightly hokey _ New 
York City icon. There are now five ``Christmas Spectacular'' franchises 
across the country and a Las Vegas company of Rockettes that high-kicks 
year round. Cablevision, the entertainment giant that last year bought 
both the show and the lease to the landmark Art Deco theater, has 
ambitious plans to take the Rockette brand even further. ``There's 
no reason why we have to be limited by the Christmas season,'' said 
Bruce Michael, the producer of the Rockettes, who rents out the dancers 
for conventions, television commercials and private parties. The show, 
once staged between Thanksgiving and Christmas, opens Sunday night 
with cameos by Tony Bennett and Liza Minnelli. And despite its early 
November debut, the ``Christmas Spectacular'' usually has no trouble 
filling the Music Hall's 5,901 seats for its two-month run. Last year, 
more than 1.1 million people saw the New York production, which brought 
in $49 million, up from $35.5 million five years ago. Radio City executives 
say it now draws more people in eight weeks than any Broadway show 
does in an entire year. How so? By running six back-to-back performances 
on weekends, beginning as early as 9 a.m. and as late as 10 p.m., 
and aggressively marketing the show, on milk cartons, automated teller 
machine screens and at fast-food restaurants. This year there will 
be 205 performances, seven more than last year, and, a first, five 
Spanish-language productions. This breakneck schedule may make for 
enviable profits, but it is brutal on the 250-member cast and crew. 
``You have to become like a machine,'' said Julie Harkness, a Rockette 
from Indianapolis who has danced at Radio City for the last five years. 
``I have to strictly monitor what I eat, how much I sleep and even 
limit the amount of time I talk on the phone.'' Still, it is hard 
to find anyone in the company who isn't starry-eyed about the ``Christmas 
Spectacular,'' which, despite a few updated numbers, remains a perky 
museum piece of vaudevillian razzle-dazzle. Over the 90 minutes, the 
audience, half of it children, is treated to a brief film of Santa 
landing on the roof of Rockefeller Center (projected on the Music 
Hall's 80-foot-wide screen), ice skaters gliding on plastic, a herd 
of live animals, 11 major scene changes and a half-dozen ``little 
people,'' as the dwarfs who play Santa's elves are called. The Rockettes, 
those smiling, perfectly synchronized automatons, appear in almost 
every scene and go through eight costume changes, 100 kicks and ``1,200 
pairs of panty hose during their eight-week run,'' boasts the production 
notes. Michael, who remembers his first stage show in 1954 as if it 
were yesterday, compared the holiday pageant to a grandiose MGM musical. 
``There's nothing as lush, as lavish or as breathtaking as the `Christmas 
Spectacular,''' said Michael, who started working for Radio City as 
stage manager in 1971, fresh out of college. ``In a sense, we're preserving 
a vanished species.'' Although the show was spiffed up four years 
ago by Robert Longbottom, the choreographer and director who just 
revamped Broadway's ``Scarlet Pimpernel,'' jaded New Yorkers and serious 
theater buffs beware: the show includes 57 dancing Santas, numbers 
syrupy enough to promote tooth decay in adults, and a halo-filled 
Nativity pageant likely to provoke discomfort in nonbelievers. The 
opening scene, one of Longbottom's additions, is ``Santa's Gonna Rock-and-Roll,'' 
which puts the whole cast through an ersatz '50s-style number that 
includes a limber Santa gyrating and vogueing. Next comes an endearing 
interpretation of Tchaikovsky's ``Nutcracker'' that features a multicultural 
collection of dancing bears. This is followed by ``The Parade of the 
Wooden Soldiers,'' a 65-year-old mainstay that showcases the Rockettes' 
drill-like precision and has costumes designed by Vincente Minnelli, 
before he became a famous Hollywood director. The eight other scenes 
include ``Christmas in New York,'' shamelessly set at Rockefeller 
Center, and ``Carol of Bells,'' which places prop bells in the hands 
of every cast member. The tableau vivant set in a manger, the only 
nod to religion, caps the show, followed by a rousing adieu from the 
two ``Mighty Wurlitzers'' that flank the stage. Christmas at Radio 
City officially started on Sept. 17, with the Music Hall's highly 
publicized cattle call for new Rockettes. More than 300 women from 
across the country showed up in leggings and leotards that morning, 
hoping to fill one of the 20 vacancies this year among the 56-member 
New York troupe. The women clogged the sidewalk along West 51st Street, 
anxiously awaiting their turn to do a quick series of tap and jazz 
steps. After being herded into a rehearsal room in groups of 30, they 
were given one shot at the routine, which is briefly demonstrated 
by three assistant choreographers. Cuts were made after the last woman 
had finished. ``Thank you for entertaining us ladies,'' announced 
Tom Kosis, an assistant choreographer, just before reading off the 
names of those who would return for another round of auditions. Asked 
what he was looking for, Kosis ticked off a list of Rockette attributes: 
``Athletically fit. Great legs. A great smile. And shine.'' As he 
spoke, a group of women _ most looking dejected _ filed out of the 
room. Although the job is grueling, the dancers say the glamour quotient 
_ and the $1,100-a-week salary _ makes up for the dizzying performance 
schedule. Vetia Searcy, 21, an actress and dancer from Mussel Shoals, 
Ala., said that to be a Rockette on the stage of Radio City Music 
Hall ``is to be the most glamorous dancer in the world.'' But this 
was not to be Ms. Searcy's year. She had the unfortunate luck of being 
first in line, and unable to benefit from watching others do the routine 
first, she flubbed the sequence. ``I feel like such a loser,'' she 
sobbed afterward, hunched against a wall in the corridor as the next 
group of hopeful dancers filed into the room. Amber Snow was one of 
the lucky ones. A dance teacher from Twinsburgh, Ohio, Ms. Snow said 
joining the Rockettes fulfilled a childhood dream sparked at age 11, 
when the company came to Cleveland with Susan Anton as a guest star. 
``After the show, they had a meet-and-greet with the Rockettes; they 
let us kick with them and I was smitten,'' said Ms. Snow, 20, who 
was wearing a sweatshirt that said, ``Shut up and dance.'' At 5 feet, 
8{ inches, Ms. Snow stands perilously close to the height limitation 
of 5 feet, 5{ inches to 5 feet, 9 inches that has been strictly imposed 
for 65 years. (Despite a few attempts at exaggerated uprightedness 
or slouching, several women failed the tape measure test on the audition 
day). Uniformity, machinelike precision and extreme legginess are 
the hallmarks of the Rockettes. Divas need not apply. ``If someone 
stands out in the show, it's not a good thing,'' Longbottom said. 
``This isn't for dancers who think they're going to get a solo.'' 
The show's only real star is Charles Hall, a perpetually jolly native 
of Kentucky who has been playing Santa Claus for the last seven years. 
Hall's Santa is the show's master of ceremonies, and his character 
helps stitch together the unrelated scenes. Hall, who greets fellow 
cast members with a hearty ``Merry Christmas'' even when he's out 
of character, takes his role very seriously. ``Santa is almost a spiritual 
thing for me,'' he said, taking a break from the ``Santa's Toy Fantasy'' 
number, which features prancing elves and oversize gift-wrapped packages. 
``I have a very important responsibility to the public.'' Hall, who 
is 40, thin and nothing like the avuncular Santa archetype, plays 
the role off-season as well, mostly for promotional events. ``In August 
you can find me in some shopping mall sweating in my Santa suit,'' 
he said. ``Santa pays the bills.'' The ``Toy Fantasy'' number is the 
main showcase for the ``little people,'' most of whom are under four 
feet. Marty Klebba, who is 4 feet, 1 inch tall, used to manage a chain 
of quick-change oil shops in Detroit before he was hired to be an 
elf in 1991. Like most of the little people, Klebba said the ``Christmas 
Spectacular'' had changed his life. The exposure, he said, has led 
to other acting work, including a job as a munchkin in a traveling 
production of ``The Wizard of Oz'' and the occasional television commercial. 
He said he did not mind that the ``Christmas Spectacular'' featured 
his small stature, not his acting abilities. ``I'm taking advantage 
of something that was a disadvantage all my life,'' said Klebba, 29, 
who recently bleached his hair blond and proudly displays an Oakland 
Raiders tattoo on his shoulder. He and the show's other elves, who 
earn $30,000 for 10 weeks of work, live at a residential hotel a block 
from Radio City. When he has free time, Klebba, who sometimes appears 
on the Howard Stern show, likes to kick back at Scores, a topless 
club in midtown. With its blocklong grand foyer and soaring auditorium, 
whose curved arches are lit to resemble a sunrise, Radio City Music 
Hall's architecture dazzles as much as the show does. When it opened 
in 1932 as part of Rockefeller Center, Radio City was the largest 
and most modern entertainment palace in the world and for decades 
was a hallowed venue for live performances, movie premieres and, more 
recently, President Clinton's 50th birthday party. Elaborate stage 
shows featuring the Rockettes, a live orchestra and the ``Mighty Wurlitzers,'' 
once preceded every film. ``The stage was never quiet,'' Michael recalled. 
But by the late '70s, the anachronistic stage show was losing ground 
to racier forms of entertainment, and the music hall became a drain 
on its owner, Rockefeller Center Inc. In 1978, the company decided 
to replace the theater with a skyscraper, and the Rockettes prepared 
for a final appearance on April 12. But at the end of that event, 
New York officials announced that the state had agreed to invest $2.2 
million to keep the theater afloat until it could be brought back 
into the black. The unprofitable stage shows, including the ``Easter 
Pageant,'' were phased out, and concerts by Madonna, Menudo and the 
Grateful Dead began drawing a new generation to Radio City. Although 
the ``Easter Pageant'' was briefly revived in 1990, running for seven 
more years, the ``Christmas Spectacular'' remains the only vestige 
of the variety show past. This is the show's last run before the music 
hall closes in February for a six-month restoration. As part of its 
plan to make the complex more profitable, Cablevision will spend $30 
million to replace the seats, the carpeting and the dancing curtain, 
which will be threaded with fiber-optic lights that can produce a 
rainbow of changing colors and patterns. The lobby's three-story Art 
Deco mural, the gold-leaf ceiling and the blocklong marquee, with 
its six miles of neon tubing, will also be restored. Cablevision plans 
to install a production center for television specials and hopes to 
expand the Radio City name to a cable channel, a record label and 
a radio station. Renovation is planned for the manual lighting system, 
which includes 3,000 dimmer switches, and the fabled steam curtain, 
a grill connected to Con Edison pipes that runs along the stage spewing 
out steam for special effects. The hydraulic stage elevators, which 
can lift up to 23,000 pounds, will be updated for the first time since 
1932. The system was once considered so advanced that aircraft-carrier 
designers studied it during World War II. Chris Rober is only the 
third person to run the elevators, among the last in the country to 
operate on pressurized water. Both Rober's father and a brother are 
employed by Radio City, a pattern that has been repeated, it seems, 
among dozens of dressers, carpenters and lighting engineers. ``I was 
always fascinated by old, greasy things,'' said Rober, standing in 
the cork-lined pump room three stories beneath the stage. ``I call 
it the Jules Verne room.'' Rober is one of the few people left who 
actually understand the hydraulic system, and he must make all repairs 
himself. When Radio City reopens next fall, the stage will be computerized, 
as will the roving band car, which carries the orchestra around the 
stage and is still driven by a technician who must lie flat inside. 
As opening night approached and tensions spiked, a nasty flu was passing 
through the company last week. Howard Kolins, the show's executive 
producer, was one of the victims and found himself griping more than 
usual. ``After 16 years on the show, and having seen it thousands 
of times, I can complain and pick apart the show like nobody else,'' 
he said, joking. Still, Kolins' bad mood dissipated when the first 
audience _ at a free dress rehearsal performance for disadvantaged 
and disabled children _ poured into the auditorium early last week. 
``I'm not going to make this into a religious experience, but seeing 
those kids reminds me that this show can do incredible things for 
people,'' Kolins said. ``It really does uplift the soul.'' Unlike 
many of his colleagues, Kolins is the first in his family to work 
at Radio City. But by marrying a Rockette, Carol Beatty, Kolins has 
linked himself to a web of Radio City veterans. Ms. Beatty's mother 
and sister were Rockettes, too, and her father played trumpet in the 
orchestra for 40 years. ``It's great to be able to talk about work 
with your in-laws,'' he said, ``and it's nice to finally have someone 
in your family understand why you keep missing holidays.'' __ The 
``Radio City Christmas Spectacular,'' starring the Rockettes, will 
run from Sunday night through Jan. 3 at Radio City Music Hall, with 
up to six performances a day on weekends in December. There are also 
five Spanish-language shows between Jan. 1 and Jan. 3. This weekend, 
the show will be performed Sunday night at 7:30, Monday at 10 a.m., 
1, 4 and 7 p.m. and Sunday at 10 a.m., 1, 4 and 7:30 p.m. For information 
on other show times, call (212) 247-4777. Tickets, which range from 
$27 to $72, can be bought through Ticketmaster, (212) 307-1000, or 
at the Radio City box office, at 50th Street and Avenue of the Americas.
