Under a glossy portrait of the late Ayatollah Ruhollah Khomeini, Iraqi 
women dragging small children elbowed their way through the crowd 
Wednesday for some Iranian cookies and chocolates. A group of Iraqi 
businessmen haggled over prices with Syrian counterparts below an 
imposing picture of Syria's President Hafez Assad. Such scenes would 
have been unthinkable only two years ago. But the Iraq-U.N. oil-for-food 
deal is allowing Baghdad to woo friends and former foes into trade 
deals that Iraq hopes will gain backing for its political views. Iraq 
has given preference to Arab countries in contracts, and it's paying 
off _ at least in rhetoric. At a trade fair this week, not only old 
allies but even representatives from Jordan and Egypt, whose recent 
ties to Iraq have been testy, had warm words for the Iraqis in their 
latest stand-off with the United Nations. ``It goes without saying 
that the Jordanian people will fully back Iraq in any crisis,'' said 
Maher Ureibat, who is heading neighboring Jordan's exhibit at the 
fair. Some 30 countries and more than 70 multinational companies are 
taking part, vying for contracts from the oil program whose current 
six-month phase, due to end November 25, should put more than dlrs 
2 billion at Iraq's disposal. Most conspicuous among the participants 
were 17 Arab countries plus Iraq's non-Arab neighbors _ Turkey and 
Iran. The Iranians seem to have put their 1980-1988 war with Iraq 
behind them. The Islamic Republic brought 32 state-run companies and 
25 private firms, Abbas Razavi, head of Iran's pavilion, told The 
Associated Press. Razavi admitted that trade was still meager but 
added ``Tehran is determined to do business and catch up with others 
under the oil deal.'' Syria occupies 2,000 square meters in the fair 
with 84 companies taking part. Iraq and Syria, ruled by rival factions 
of the Baath party, opened their borders last year after an 18-year 
shut-down. ``We are doing business within the oil program and also 
sending items allowed under the (U.N.) sanctions,'' said Amer Kharboutli, 
head of the Syrian exhibit. Some Arab countries at the fair showed 
clear support for Iraq in the crisis over U.N. arms inspectors who 
must declare Iraq is free of dangerous weapons before the sanctions, 
imposed after Iraq's 1990 invasion of Kuwait, can be lifted. T-shirts 
with pictures of Iraqi President Saddam Hussein were displayed at 
the Palestinian pavilion. ``We all will go to streets if America attacks 
Iraq,'' said Fareed Hammouda, representing the 20 Palestinian companies 
at the fair. At the Sudanese exhibit, one pamphlet read: ``Khartoum 
and Baghdad are in the same trench against America.''
