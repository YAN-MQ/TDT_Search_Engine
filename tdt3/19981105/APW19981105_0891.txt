While a popular Norwegian talkshow host was leading a televised debate 
about street violence in Oslo, his teen-age son was robbed at knife 
point when shopping for school books in the capital city. ``I was 
furious,'' Per Staale Loenning told newspapers about Wednesday's incident. 
Norway's capital has seen a sharp increased in armed robberies and 
muggings in recent months. On Wednesday alone, seven robberies were 
reported in the traditionally safe city of 500,000 people, including 
a woman who was mugged twice _ by different people _ at the same outdoor 
automatic bank. Loenning's program focused on such robberies and the 
deaths of four innocent people in Oslo this year in street attacks. 
His own 17-year-old son was robbed Wednesday of 100 kroner (dlrs 13.50) 
by three younger teens with knives. ``I am frightened by the increase 
in senseless violence and youth robberies in Oslo,'' Loenning was 
quoted as telling the Oslo newspaper Dagbladet. Loenning said he insisted 
on filing a police complaint about the robbery, even though his son 
did not want to because he feared reprisals.
