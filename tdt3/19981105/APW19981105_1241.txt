A top officer with Russia's secretive military intelligence agency 
warned in an article Thursday that it needs to undergo drastic reforms 
to survive the country's latest economic crisis and called for closer 
cooperation with Western intelligence services. Gen. Anatoly Kvashnin, 
chief of the general staff of the agency, known by its Russian acronym 
GRU, was writing in the military newspaper Red Star to mark the GRU's 
80th anniversary. In recalling the GRU's history, Kvashnin reiterated 
that it wasn't the agency's fault that the Soviet Union fell victim 
to Nazi invasion in World War II. The GRU had ``specific and alarming 
information'' about the June 1941 invasion more than a month beforehand, 
but Stalin ignored the warning, Kvashnin wrote. Similar accounts have 
been widely reported in recent years. Kvashnin also lamented cutbacks 
forced by Russia's financial crisis. ``Inadequate funding has forced 
the leadership of the Defense Ministry to strictly define the main 
responsibilities of the GRU, concentrate its forces and give funds 
only for high-priority ... issues,'' he said. He did not say which 
issues. He lashed out at the Untied States for ``destabilizing the 
international arena by ... actively striving for a uni-polar world, 
in which U.S. politicians would have the exclusive right to make decisions 
on military interventions. ``A glaring example of this is in the Balkans,'' 
he said, referring to NATO's threatened airstrikes on Yugoslavia, 
which Russia fiercely opposes. Still, he said the GRU was pursuing 
ties with former Cold War foes. ``As strange as it sounds, Russian 
military intelligence has begun cooperation with military intelligence 
of NATO countries. Life forces us to to share with them closed information 
with the the aim of battling terrorism, drug mafias, nuclear proliferation 
and dangerous environmental situations,'' he wrote. The GRU was formed 
during the Russian Revolution in 1918. It has come under criticism 
in recent years for Soviet-style secrecy and alleged corruption. Russian 
journalist Dmitry Kholodov was investigating corruption in the GRU 
when he was killed in 1994 by a bomb in a briefcase supposedly provided 
by his informant. Kholodov's employer, the daily Moskovsky Komsomolets, 
linked his killing to his investigation but has offered no proof.
