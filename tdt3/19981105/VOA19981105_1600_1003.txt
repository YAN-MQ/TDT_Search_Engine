Two teams of U.S. researchers say, for the first time in a laboratory, 
they've cultivated human cells that could be used to grow anything 
from heart muscle to brain tissue. Researchers from the University 
of Wisconsin at Madison, and Johns Hopkins University in Maryland, 
report in separate studies. They've cultivated so-called human stem 
cells. The studies open up the possibility for new transplantation 
therapies and treatments. For people suffering from Heart Disease,
