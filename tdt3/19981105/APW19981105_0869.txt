A jailed leader of the Cali drug cartel was shot and killed Thursday 
while playing soccer in a Colombian prison yard, authorities said. 
Helmer ``Pacho'' Herrera was the former No. 3 of the cartel. He was 
killed by a lone gunman with a 9 mm pistol in Palmira prison in Cali 
on Thursday morning, said National Prison Service spokesman Javier 
Suarez. Authorities said the gunman was captured. Long wanted by U.S. 
officials, the 47-year-old Herrera surrendered to authorities in September 
1996, the last of seven major Cali cartel members to either turn themselves 
in or be arrested. He was convicted of drug trafficking in March and 
sentenced to six years and eight months in prison. In September, the 
sentence was increased to 14 years and eight months on appeal by prosecutors 
who considered the original sentence too light. When he surrendered, 
Herrera said he was tired of being on the run from multiple enemies 
_ he had dodged hundreds of police raids and had his share of rivals 
_ and thought he would be safer behind bars. Herrera played a key 
role in the Cali cartel's secret alliance with the government to wipe 
out the more violent Medellin drug gang. His lawyer, Gustavo Salazar, 
said in a radio interview Thursday that Herrera's killing could have 
been related to that rivalry. Herrera was believed to have been involved 
in a 1988 car bomb attack on a building where the family of the late 
Medellin drug boss Pablo Escobar was living. The family escaped unhurt. 
The United States made a formal extradition request for Herrera in 
July 1996, but Colombian law forbade his extradition. In the 1980s, 
Herrera personally directed cocaine distribution and money-laundering 
activities in the New York City area on behalf of the Cali cartel, 
according to the U.S. Drug Enforcement Administration. Gaining a reputation 
as a deft money-launderer, Herrera had by 1990 established his own 
family-run cocaine trafficking business and later entered into closer 
cooperation with the Rodriguez brothers, setting up and maintaining 
cocaine distribution networks in Los Angeles, Houston and Miami, the 
DEA says. Herrera is the second leading member of the Cali cartel 
killed since 1995, when police captured the organization's top leaders, 
Gilberto and Miguel Rodriguez Orejuela. Both are currently serving 
jail terms and are also wanted by the United States for extradition. 
Jose Santacruz Londono, at the time the cartel's No. 3 boss, was killed 
by police in March 1996 after escaping from jail by bribing guards. 
In July, Herrera reportedly turned into police his wheelchair-bound 
half brother, Jose Manuel Herrera, in return for a sentence reduction.
