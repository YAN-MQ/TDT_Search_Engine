After a long dispute, a Berlin court has ruled that the city's 35,000 
Muslim children will be allowed to receive Islamic religious instruction 
in schools for the first time. The decision, long resisted by the 
city government, opens the way for the Islamic Federation, a group 
representing many of Berlin's 220,000 Muslims, to give lessons on 
the Koran and Islamic tradition. Up to now no such instruction had 
been available, although classes in the Roman Catholic and Protestant 
faiths were offered. ``We delayed this much too long, and the result 
was the decision ended up in court,'' said Barbara John, the city's 
commissioner for foreign affairs. ``The fact is, there is a growing 
phobia about Islam in European countries linked to television images 
of Iraq, Algeria and Iran, and that fear is gravely misplaced.'' The 
decision reflects Germany's gradual and painful reconciliation with 
the fact that it is a multi-ethnic state with by far the largest population 
of foreigners _ more than 7 million _ in Europe. Last month the new 
Social Democratic government agreed on draft legislation that would 
make it easier for these foreigners, who include about 2.2 million 
Turks, to become German. In a country where religious education is 
generally obligatory, Berlin is one of only three federal states that 
have made religion a voluntary subject. The others are Bremen and 
Brandenburg. The authorities here have left it primarily to the Catholic 
and Protestant churches to organize classes and curriculums in two 
free hours provided every week. About 40 percent of pupils have chosen 
to attend. But under the pretext that no suitable organization existed 
to represent the city's large Muslim population in drawing up a syllabus, 
Berlin had barred Islamic instruction despite a campaign by the Islamic 
Federation that lasted more than 10 years and ended up in court. ``We 
had been forced to send our children to mosques'' to receive instruction 
in their spare time, said Bekir Durak, the chairman of the federation's 
executive committee. ``The problem is that the media have often portrayed 
us as radicals, although our ideals are tolerance and understanding.'' 
Still, some doubts persist about the nature of the federation, which 
is generally regarded as the most radical of three large Islamic groups 
in Berlin. The others are the Turkish Islamic Union and the Islamic 
Cultural Centers. ``It is unfortunate that the court identified only 
one organization, and the one seen by other groups as closest to the 
fundamentalists,'' Ms. John said. ``But this is the result of our 
own failure to come up with a different solution earlier.'' The Turkish 
Islamic Union has in the past complained that the federation is close 
to the Welfare Party, the populist Islamic movement in Turkey that 
is now banned. But Durak said that such allegations were unfounded 
and that the federation was prepared to work with the other two Islamic 
groups to agree on an educational program. Of Berlin's Muslim population, 
about 70 percent are Turks, with other large communities from Bosnia 
and Lebanon. The city has 70 mosques. In a statement issued Thursday, 
the Berlin City Council said that all classes on Islam in the city 
should be taught in German, and it urged the three main Islamic organizations 
to ``form a joint association with the aim of defining the framework 
of lessons.'' Classes are expected to begin next summer.
