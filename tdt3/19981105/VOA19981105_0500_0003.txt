Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Nehtenyahu has submitted to his cabinet 
the new interim peace deal with the Palestinians. Beginning the ratification 
process of the Accord. VOA's Al Pessen reports from Jerusalem. The 
cabinet finally convened Thursday morning after four postponements. 
Prime Minister Nehtanyahu said he was satisfied that the Palestinian 
authority will arrest 10 terrorism suspects in each stage of the Y 
Agreement's timetable. For a total of 30 over three months. The Prime 
Minister faces stiff opposition to the agreement among cabinet members. 
But he is expected to get it approved after a debative tour of three 
days. Some cabinet members are expected to try to put some conditions 
on the agreement. Related to how the Palestinians will change their 
charter. And how much land Israel will surrender in the next stage 
of the Peace Process. The Palestinians say such conditions would not 
be acceptable. The Israeli Parliament is scheduled to complete the 
ratification process in a debate set for next Wednesday and Thursday.
