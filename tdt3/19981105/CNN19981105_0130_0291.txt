The FBI made it official. Wednesday, the agency filed a 238-count 
indictment against exiled Saudi millionaire, osama bin laden. Susan 
Candiotti reports. The long-expected indictment of osama bin laden 
contained little new information about his alleged terrorist network. 
But for the first time, prosecutors have officially linked the Islamic 
extremist to the U.S. embassy bombings in Kenya and Tanzania last 
August -- attacks that killed 224 people. The expanded indictment 
adds another name to bin laden's alleged cast of characters. Mohammed 
atef, seen here next to bin laden, is described as his military commander. 
Atef is also charged in the bombings. Authorities say bin laden was 
intimately involved in planning attacks against U.S. soldiers in Saudi 
Arabia and Somalia. Atef allegedly helped train somali tribes who 
killed 18 Americans in 1993, dragging some through the streets. Osama 
bin laden and his military commander, Mohammed atef, are charged with 
plotting and carrying out the most heinous acts of international terrorism 
and murder. Last week, a source familiar with the investigation revealed 
that former U.S. army sergeant Ali Mohammed has also been charged 
under seal in connection with bin laden's network. And sources tell 
CNN more Americans are being investigated and could be indicted in 
the future. Why unseal bin laden's indictment now? Authorities explain, 
not only was it the world's worst-kept secret, they also hope to generate 
new leads about bin laden's whereabouts. That, plus a new incentive 
-- a reward of up to $5 million. Susan Candiotti, CNN, New York.
