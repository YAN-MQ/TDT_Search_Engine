Japanese golfer Kaname Yokoo took a four-point lead Thursday in the 
opening round of the 120 million yen (dlrs 1.02 million) Acom International. 
Yokoo, winless in three years as a pro, shot an eagle, seven birdies 
and two bogeys for 17 points on the 6,948-yard (6,323-meter), par-72 
Seve Ballesteros Golf Club course. The tournament's modified Stableford 
scoring system awards 8 points for a double eagle, 5 for an eagle, 
2 for a birdie, zero for par, minus-1 for a bogey and minus-3 for 
a double bogey or worse. Toshimitus Izawa, winner of the Tokai Classic 
last month, collected 13 points, followed by Toru Suzuki's 10. Another 
point behind at 9 were Tsuyoshi Yoneyama, Katsunori Kuwabara and Kazuhiko 
Hosokawa.
