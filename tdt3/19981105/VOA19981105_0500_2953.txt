Share prices on the Tokyo Stock Exchange were lower Thursday on investor 
profit taking. But it was not as bad as it could have been. The index 
briefly lost 350 points, but later rebounded to close Thursday's session. 
Down 186 point to 14,341 - a drop of 1.3 percent. Thursday's loss 
comes after a seven percent rally on the NYKE in the past two sessions. 
A gain of 963 points of expectations of more alliances involving major 
banks. Pat Mohr, a strategist of the Merrill Lynch investment firm's 
office in Tokyo. The government has now set aside 60 trillion yen 
in a huge, huge safety net to kind of make sure that we don't see 
any more large bankruptcies such as the long term credit thing. On 
the micro level, we're seeing some - I would say we are making some 
headway. Some of the most kind of significant moves are moves like; 
for example, some of the trust banks that are saying: we're going 
to completely pull out of overseas operation. That they're not profitable. 
And we're going to consolidate and focus on a few things that we do 
well at home. Strategist Mohr says there was also some active buying 
by foreign ambassadors lately. I think another very important development 
over the last few days is that you're starting to see a lot of interest 
from U.S. global investors in Japan. I think there's a real fear that 
some of the consumption in the CAPEX excesses that have been building 
up in the United States, that we're starting to see them being unwound. 
And that we're just now at the beginning of that process. CAPEX is 
business shorthand for capacity excess.
