He is the president of his industry's trade group, a well-known Internet 
pioneer who has floated above the red ink that has drowned so many 
other entrepreneurs, but Mark Tiarra still asks that a reporter not 
mention the northern New Jersey town where he conducts business. ``It's 
a stuffy place around here,'' he said. ``A lot of people wouldn't 
understand.'' So let it simply be said that Tiarra works most days 
in a nondescript building in Bergen County, not far from Ridgewood, 
producing, marketing and carefully manipulating the most popular commodity 
on the World Wide Web: adult entertainment. And as a measure of how 
rapidly that industry has grown, Tiarra, who has been in the business 
only about four years, has become one of its elder statesmen, a highly 
sought-after guru who is now making plenty of money as a consultant 
to aspiring Webmasters of cyberporn. He is 29 years old and has the 
interview spiel down pat. ``There's nothing wrong with basing a business 
on human sexuality,'' he said, relaxing in front of an enormous computer 
monitor. ``Of course, we don't even do that many hard-core sites. 
There's nothing wrong with it, but it just doesn't appeal to my tastes. 
Our sites try to cross the line between art and erotica.'' He is mildly 
dismissive of the thousands of coarse, tumbledown Web sites that fail 
to surround their flesh pictures with the proper graphical environment, 
but for Tiarra, the president of the United Adult Sites, there is 
a limit to condescension. The nonprofit organization, formed in 1996, 
is the trade association of adult Web sites. It has established a 
code of ethics for its 500 members and lobbied in Washington against 
restrictions like the Child Online Protection Act, signed into law 
last month by President Clinton and immediately challenged by Internet 
professionals. ``The Justice Department doesn't even know how it's 
going to enforce it,'' he said. ``If I were the Supreme Court, I'd 
be insulted that they passed it.'' The law penalizes commercial Web 
sites that fail to keep ``harmful material'' out of the hands of minors. 
With his long, limp black hair and faint beard, Tiarra looks more 
like the musician and record producer he says he would prefer to be 
than the pornography industry authority he has become. But he is immensely 
knowledgeable and utterly straightforward about the details of his 
work, and though he has no business background, others in the industry 
say his marketing abilities are remarkable. ``Mark is known as a genius 
at directing traffic,'' said Fay Sharp, who runs the XWebexpo, a trade 
show held twice a year for the adult Web industry. ``Someone sets 
up a site and they need to have traffic into the site or they die. 
So they call Mark and they buy traffic from him, and it's not yucky 
traffic _ it's people who pay.'' Traffic, for the uninitiated, refers 
to the number of people who look at a Web page, and ideally, give 
out their credit card numbers for a peek at password-protected photos. 
(According to several industry estimates, more than half the Internet's 
bandwidth, or capacity, is taken up with traffic in adult material.) 
By setting up carefully manipulative advertisements on his own popular 
sites, Tiarra can send his traffic to other sites, charging them for 
the privilege. About a year ago, he realized that thousands of people 
had read about the gold rush of profit possibilities in cyberporn 
and were trying to enter the industry with no knowledge or ability. 
So, just as in the mainstream computer world, he began selling his 
knowledge to new Webmasters, and is now offering complete packages 
to entrepreneurs with cash. The basic package starts at $3,499, for 
which a buyer gets two galleries of photos, several completely designed 
Web pages and a month of consulting advice. The ``platinum package'' 
goes for $34,999 and includes a huge gallery of photos, live video 
feeds, credit card processing, advertising and three months of consulting. 
His company, Tiarracorp, now has seven full-time employees and 60 
or 70 contractors around the world who design the sites. This, of 
course, is where the big money is. Thousands of inexperienced adult 
Webmasters have gone under with the increasing competition, but his 
company has made several million dollars for the last three years, 
and his telephone continues to ring as newcomers seek out an honest 
reputation in a rough trade filled with swindlers. Until a few years 
ago, he had never seen the Internet, coming late to the industry. 
He grew up in Bergen County, the son of a data-processing executive. 
He was allowed to play with an Apple 2C and a guitar in high school. 
He took music in college and later worked in a printing business until 
a friend asked him to design a Web site for a band. He studied the 
Internet and by 1994 realized there was only one likely way to make 
money with it, appealing to a very old-fashioned instinct. His Web 
sites range from the grandiose (``All the Beauty That Is Woman'') 
to the crass (``The Girls of Tiarracorp''), but every evening, they 
are seen by thousands of Web surfers, many with credit cards. ``I've 
got a 2-year-old son, and I don't want him seeing these sites until 
he knows the difference between love and sex,'' Tiarra said. ``Nobody 
wants kids on their sites. They cost you bandwidth, and they don't 
have a credit card to buy anything you have.''
