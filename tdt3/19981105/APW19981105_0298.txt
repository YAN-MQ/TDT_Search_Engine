With the Dalai Lama readying peace overtures to Beijing while on a 
U.S. tour, China scorned the exiled Tibetan leader as a separatist 
Thursday and warned Washington not to support him. Chinese Foreign 
Ministry spokesman Zhu Bangzao accused the Dalai Lama of having agitated 
for Tibet's independence from China for years. ``There are no facts 
to prove that he is repentant,'' Zhu said at a twice-weekly media 
briefing. Chinese President Jiang Zemin offered to restart a dialogue 
with the Dalai Lama in June as long as the Tibetan leader renounced 
separatism and stated that Tibet and Taiwan are part of China. A spokesman 
for the Chinese government was quoted Thursday by state media as saying 
those conditions still stand. Aides to the Dalai Lama have said he 
will deliver a response to the Chinese offer during a current 10-day 
visit to the United States, possibly during his four-day stay in Washington, 
which starts Saturday. It was unclear how far the Dalai Lama was willing 
to go to satisfy Chinese demands. He has argued for years that he 
wants true autonomy, not independence for Tibet. Many exiled Tibetans 
have also grown impatient with his support for non-violent struggle 
against China's often harsh 47-year rule of their fervently Buddhist 
homeland. The Dalai Lama, who fled Tibet amid a failed anti-Chinese 
uprising in 1959, has since gained a worldwide following, won the 
Nobel Peace Prize and met with world leaders _ prominence that has 
stung China. Zhu, the Chinese Foreign Ministry spokesman, warned Washington 
not to arrange any meetings between the Dalai Lama and senior U.S. 
officials. If Washington does so, ``it plays a role in conniving and 
supporting his activities which will seriously hurt the feelings of 
the Chinese people,'' Zhu said. He added that recently warm Chinese-U.S. 
ties would be at risk. During a nationally televised news conference 
in Beijing in June, U.S. President Bill Clinton suggested to Chinese 
President Jiang that Jiang meet with the Dalai Lama and said the two 
might even like each other.
