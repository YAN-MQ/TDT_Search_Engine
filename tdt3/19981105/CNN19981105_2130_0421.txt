The United States is sending $66 million in emergency assistance to 
victims of hurricane Mitch in Honduras, Nicaragua, El Salvador and 
Guatemala. It includes $20 million worth of food and $30 million in 
military equipment, including helicopters to rescue stranded people 
from isolated areas. An estimated 13,000 people still are missing 
since the storm passed over central America. Officials say Mitch is 
blamed for the deaths of 9,000 people, and countless others may be 
buried under mud slides and debris.
