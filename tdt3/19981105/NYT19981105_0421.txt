The crew of the space shuttle Discovery spent much of day seven of 
its nine-day flight speaking jocularly to journalists, students and 
Vice President Al Gore. The crew members said they were healthy, sleeping 
well and meeting a rigorous schedule for scientific experiments. ``We 
had a lot to do, and many thought we would not be able to do it all 
in nine days,'' said Pedro Duque, one of the crew, which has been 
carrying out 83 experiments, an unusually ambitious program. ``So 
far we have been on schedule.'' On a television linkup to the space 
shuttle from Washington, Gore called the shuttle flight ``an unqualified 
success.'' Dr. Scott Parazynski, a medical doctor, said he and the 
six other Discovery crew members had been ``exceptionally healthy.'' 
The evaluation applied to John Glenn, who at 77 is the oldest person 
to fly in space. ``Everyone has been active, eating well and has had 
no problem with motion sickness whatsoever,'' Parazynski said in a 
news conference beamed from space with journalists asking questions 
from the Johnson Space Center here. Earlier, Glenn said he was surprised 
he had escaped the space sickness that affects most people who fly 
in space. The crew may be the first to have avoided motion sickness 
in space. Most space fliers have experienced varying degrees of nausea, 
vomiting or other symptoms of motion sickness, said Ed Campion, a 
spokesman for NASA. About 70 percent of men and 50 percent of women 
have experienced such symptoms, Campion said. The condition usually 
occurs within the first days of space flight. Dr. John Charles, a 
NASA medical specialist, said in an interview that his agency had 
often discussed motion sickness at meetings. But, Charles added, he 
could not recall reports from such meetings of another crew that had 
escaped motion sickness in space. Researchers are conducting sleep 
experiments on the mission. And to try to improve the quality of sleep 
in space and reduce the fatigue most astronauts experience on return 
to earth, the crew has been instructed to retire from 30 to 45 minutes 
earlier each night of the flight. Curt Brown, the shuttle flight commander, 
said he ``usually has no problem sleeping, no matter where I am.'' 
But, Brown added, going to sleep earlier each night ``affects your 
sleep pattern a little bit, so it is getting a little tougher to stay 
asleep for the entire'' night. Glenn was dropped from one top priority 
sleep experiment that involved taking a small amount of the hormone 
melatonin. He was excluded because he had a pre-existing condition 
that made him ineligible for it. Asked why he did not know he was 
ineligible when he agreed to participate in the study after it was 
explained to him, Glenn said he did ``not think this is the time to 
get into that.'' NASA had listed the melatonin experiment as a top 
priority of the flight, which costs nearly half a billion dollars. 
Today, Glenn played down the melatonin study, saying, ``It was such 
a small part of the whole experiment, to me it was very insignificant.'' 
The crew began packing up equipment used in some experiments aboard 
the Discovery, which is due to land in Florida on Saturday. But Charles 
said that ``the mission is not over when the wheels stop rolling.'' 
Glenn and other crew members will continue to participate in sleep, 
balance, metabolism and other studies for weeks after the flight so 
scientists can compare the findings before, during and after space 
flight. Because scientists are allowed one year from the final study 
session before reporting findings to NASA, it will be some time before 
final analyses are available, Charles said. Glenn's wife, Annie, who 
had earlier objected to her husband's return to space, said at a separate 
news conference that she was ``scared'' at the launching last week. 
``I will feel a whole lot better when he is back on Earth,'' she said.
