With a show of strength and a key victory in Congress, the government 
suddenly seems in better shape to fix Brazil's battered economy. Cajoling, 
horse-trading and promising favors, government allies on Wednesday 
beat back attempts to weaken a social security reform bill that would 
reduce a dlrs 65 billion budget deficit. The victory gave a badly 
needed boost to President Fernando Henrique Cardoso. With the government 
steamroller in high gear, there's a better chance legislators will 
approve the tough austerity package he unveiled last week. ``It shows 
the government has got its game together,'' political scientist David 
Fleischer said by telephone from Brasilia, the capital. ``This heralds 
well for fiscal reforms. The package definitely looks easier.'' Brazilians 
hope the message wasn't lost on the International Monetary Fund, which 
says the reforms are needed to obtain an aid package expected to total 
some dlrs 30 billion. The IMF on Thursday said it will announce details 
of the package this month. But the victory was not without strings. 
Cardoso's allies had to attend a long wish-list, especially job appointments 
for lame-duck legislators who lost in October elections. ``It will 
be interesting to see what all those concessions cost the government,'' 
said Antonio Alkmin, head of the Research and Studies Division at 
the government-run Brazilian Institute of Geography and Statistics. 
``What we're hearing is that the horse-trading is getting very serious,'' 
said Walter Stoeppelwerth, head of research at the Flemings bank in 
Sao Paulo. ``The government is mobilizing like never before.'' Some 
analysts warned that the optimism could be premature. ``Although it 
is an important first step, much still needs to be done,'' said Peter 
West, head economist at BBV Latinvest in London. ``Excitement about 
what happened yesterday will quickly fade if the process doesn't advance.'' 
Still, Cardoso's allies were justifiably excited at the end of an 
impasse that had stalled the bill in Congress for more than three 
years. The 513-seat Chamber of Deputies approved a ceiling of (1,200 
reals) a month for civil service pensions. It also created minimum 
retirement ages of 53 for men and 48 for women. The government agreed 
to drop a third measure that would have limited special pensions for 
people working under hazardous or adverse conditions, such as in coal 
mines or oil rigs. The measures are expected to save dlrs 2.5 billion 
(3 billion reals) next year. By comparison, the austerity package 
proposes savings in 1999 of nearly dlrs 24 billion, or 28 billion 
reals. ``One victory doesn't necessarily guarantee a second one,'' 
said political analyst Carlos Lopes of the Santa Fe Institute in Brasilia. 
Still, he said the government should be heartened by the fact that 
480 legislators stayed until midnight to vote the final point. ``It's 
an indication Congress will play the game for the rest of the year,'' 
he said. ``And that's good news for the fiscal measures.''
