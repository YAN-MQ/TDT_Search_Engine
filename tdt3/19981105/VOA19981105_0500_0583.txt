At the same time this effort is underway at the United Nations, the 
U.S. Defense Secretary is on a multi-national tour. Trying to rally 
support among allies for the use of military force. If Baghdad refuses 
to allow U.N. weapons inspectors to resume their work. Secretary Cohen 
left Catarrh today, after talks with Amir Shegharts Benkalifi Artani 
and he heads for Oman, according to the Catarrh's agency. Mr. Cohen 
is expected to visit the United Arab Emeritus later today before traveling 
on to Egypt. Our correspondent Gil Butler reports, the State Department 
says no further authorization is needed before military force can 
be used against Iraq. State Department spokesman James Rubin says 
the United States is confident it will have the backing it needs to 
take what he called: "appropriate action to support the United Nations." 
The Security Council is considering a new resolution on the Iraqi 
defiance of inspections by UNSCOM, the United Nations Weapons Inspectors. 
Mr. Rubin said: "The United States is looking for another clear statement 
that Iraq is in violation of U.N. resolutions. But, he says, "a new 
authorization for the use of military force is not needed." What we're 
seeking is a clear message of opposition to Saddam Hussein's actions. 
We think that Security Council authorization for the use of force 
already exists. And we see no need to have that reiterated or go through 
the exercise of trying to get it reiterated. The State Department 
spokesman said: " Iraq's decision to allow maintenance of U.N. inspection 
cameras is not a substitute for full compliance with the Inspection 
regime." Mr. Rubin declined to give a time frame for Iraqi compliance 
before military action may be taken. But he repeated Secretary of 
State Madeleine Albright's description of the situation as grave.
