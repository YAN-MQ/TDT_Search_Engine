It has just become easier to buy important lots at auction. A new 
magazine, The Boulay 300, published its first issue this week. It 
is a 50-page, by-subscription-only guide that promises to identify 
the 300 most important lots of antiques and works of art at auction 
all over the world in a given month. Its founder, Laure Boulay de 
Meurthe, is based in London. (She was the last companion of Sir James 
Goldsmith, a noted collector of art and antiques.) Ms. Boulay is also 
a collector of books and the longtime publisher of the French magazine 
Pointe de Vue, a weekly that covers French society. She described 
the new magazine as an appraiser of auctions, explaining that it is 
a guide to the best lots being sold among 1,450 leading fine-art auction 
houses worldwide, including Sotheby's, Christie's, Phillips and William 
Doyle Galleries. Jeffrey Coorsh, the publisher of The Boulay 300, 
said the magazine was to be published 10 times a year. It costs $500 
for an annual subscription. (Information: (011) 44-171-245-6826, in 
London.) ``It's a magazine for collectors in general, auction houses, 
museum people, anyone interested in art, because it's a good summary 
of what's going on in the art world,'' he said. ``This is a useful 
tool, particularly as more and more new people come into the market,'' 
said Hugh Hildesley, executive vice president of Sotheby's. ``The 
timing is very good because the market has become so big and widespread 
that it will help people sort things out. It does the groundwork for 
them.'' A Christie's spokesman, Andree Corroon, said: ``It is an excellent 
resource for collectors who buy at auction. Our client base is more 
and more international, and clients who are not in New York or who 
wish to remain anonymous bid by phone.'' Diana Phillips, the Sotheby's 
spokeswoman in New York, said that at Sotheby's 50 percent of the 
winning auction bids were by phone. Amy Page, a former editor in chief 
of Art &AMP; Auction magazine, is the Boulay contributor from the 
United States. ```The 300' may not all be masterpieces, but we find 
plenty of sleepers,'' she said. ``We censor by omission.'' Godfrey 
Barker, the London-based editor in chief, who has covered the art 
market worldwide since 1975, said he thought the guide would appeal 
most to dealers. ``Every dealer has to do every day what we are doing, 
searching out the very best at auction,'' he said. ``But we come out 
ahead of the catalogs. We get our information by torturing the auction 
house experts.'' He said Sotheby's had told him that its press department 
was doing more work for The Boulay 300 than it was doing for ``all 
the newspapers put together.'' Barker said, ``No dealer can match 
us in terms of research.'' The magazine lists the auction specialists 
and their telephone numbers for each lot featured, and shows the work 
in color. The auction houses supply the 300 transparencies to be shown 
in each issue. No more than 50 percent of the items chosen are from 
Christie's and Sotheby's, according to Barker. ``We are talking to 
auction houses in South America and South Africa,'' he said. ``We 
are covering sales in Beijing, Singapore, Mexico City, Istanbul and 
Moscow. We are reaching into parts of the art market other commentators 
cannot touch.'' Ms. Page suggested that collectors would take advantage 
of the guide. ``It's something to help busy people make decisions,'' 
she said. ``We would not mention a sale that has nothing special in 
it.'' For the Nov. 24 sale at Christie's in New York, where French 
and English antiques from the New York gallery French &AMP; Co. will 
be auctioned, the magazine cites a pair of Louis XVI ormolu-mounted 
Egyptian alabaster vases, circa 1770, that carry an estimate of $1 
million to $1.5 million. The listing reports that the design is attributed 
to Francois-Joseph Belanger and that the ormolu mounts were executed 
by Pierre Gouthiere, one of the masters of the age. The vases were 
bought by Louis XVI in 1782. The text also has a key fact: what the 
pair went for the last time they were auctioned ($520,000, at Christie's 
in London in 1992). And what are Ms. Page's criteria for including 
a work in the magazine? ``Rarity, condition and that oft-neglected 
category, beauty,'' she said. After covering the market for 16 years, 
she added, she also considers ``sheer quirkiness.'' Some comments 
are hilarious. One listing, for Friday's sale of 20th-century British 
art at Christie's in London, includes a 1950 oil painting by L.S. 
Lowry, ``Father and Two Sons,'' which has an estimate of $680,000 
to $1.02 million. The magazine's commentary reads as follows: ``This 
is grim stuff. We celebrate Lowry as the only 20th-century British 
artist to address head-on the awfulness of life in polluted, smoky 
cities and we admire his controlled nostalgia and stoic humor in the 
face of so much suffering.'' It then concludes, ``Important to any 
survey of Lowry, it is unlikely to be popular at $680,000 plus.'' 
Other listings pick out works many might overlook. The highlighted 
lot of the Nov. 16 sale of Impressionist, contemporary and modern 
paintings at Phillips in New York is a large painting of the Champs-Elysees 
in winter by Jean-Francois Raffaelli. When asked about the listing, 
a Phillips specialist, Guillaume Duhamel, admitted that the picture 
was probably the ``sleeper'' in the sale. ``The painting is the most 
beautiful Raffaelli I've ever seen on the market,'' he said. ``It's 
in the artist's later Impressionistic style.'' The estimate is $130,000 
to $160,000. Asked his criteria, Barker insisted that monetary value 
was irrelevant. He said a work of art must ``have quality and be supreme 
of its type.'' He pointed out that half of the listings would be works 
costing under $20,000. ``In some fields, like Chinese and Japanese 
works of art, supreme quality can be found for $10,000,'' he added. 
The publisher said the target audience was 10,000 people. (MORE) nn 
Interactive Collector There is a new free Internet guide to auctions 
that covers sales at most auction houses except for Christie's and 
Sotheby's. The Interactive Collector (www.icollector.com) is a London-based 
resource for buying and selling art, antiques and collectibles, and 
it seems to focus on more affordable things. It is still experiencing 
birthing pains (not all the items for sale have been photographed), 
but it is comprehensive, ranging from Bonnards to knicknacks. James 
Corsellis, the 28-year-old managing director, said he had signed up 
133 auction houses and 64 art galleries, and has a database with more 
than 3,000 items in 41 categories, from antiquities to stamps and 
coins. His strategy is to get Bonhams, Phillips and all the second-tier 
auction houses around the world linked online, forming a critical 
mass to attract serious buyers and sellers. The current auction, which 
ends at 1 p.m. on Thursday, is a selection of 250 items from 13 houses 
around the world, from platinum earrings ($1,500 to $3,000) to Titanic 
postcards from 1912 ($450 to $650).
