If all goes as planned, three adventurers will have the ultimate "when 
I was your age" story of traveling through ice and snow. Two Australian 
men and one New Zealander have begun a quest to ski 1,875 miles from 
Scott's base in Antarctica to the South Pole and back. Each adventurer 
is hauling 400 pounds of food, fuel and equipment. The trip should 
last 100 days. If successful, it will be the longest unsupported ice 
adventure of the century.
