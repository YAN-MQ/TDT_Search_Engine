In Honduras and Nicaragua, the destruction left by Mitch when it was 
a Hurricane is staggering. Thousands are dead. Millions are homeless. 
Bob Cain looks at how the countries are balancing the tasks of burying 
their dead and caring for the living. If the casualty figures reported 
by central American authorities are even nearly accurate, the catastrophe 
is one of the worst -- possibly the worst -- weather-related disaster 
to hit the western Hemisphere in the 20th century. The hardest-hit, 
by far, is impoverished Honduras, with an estimated 7,000 dead, a 
million or more homeless, and most of the nation's crops, bridges 
and highways destroyed. Honduran President Carlos flores says his 
country faces a very long ordeal of rebuilding. We have seen, in several 
days destroyed, what it took us 50 years to construct. The terrible 
irony is that disasters like this hit hardest at the very poor -- 
it is only on the barren hillsides, long since deforested for firewood 
and farming, and vulnerable now to flood and mudslides, that the poor 
can afford to live. In Nicaragua, a woman screamed "murderer" at president 
arnoldo aleman as he toured the town of Leon to see the devastation. 
Aleman said he was working as fast as he could to get the storm victims 
the food and medicine they so badly needed. Leone is near the casitas 
volcano, where as many as 2,000 may have been buried in a mudslide. 
And just 20 miles away, another volcano, cerro Negro, erupted. How 
much damage it might do, not yet clear. In both Nicaragua and Honduras, 
officials say bodies are being cremated, often where they are found, 
to prevent the spread of disease. With deaths and damage also reported 
in El Salvador, Guatemala, Mexico and costa Rica, and thousands still 
unaccounted for, this is clearly one of the worst disasters ever to 
hit central America. Bob Cain, "Headline News."
