An explosion in a parking garage in the Swiss capital Bern late Thursday 
heavily damaged buildings and injured several people, police said. 
Dozens of rescuers searched for further victims in the rubble. Three 
people who had been working in an office hit by the blast were missing, 
officials said, adding that the cause of the explosion could not be 
determined immediately. The force of the explosion tore the front 
off a nearby apartment building. Nine injured people, one of them 
seriously hurt, were taken to a hospital in the first hour after the 
explosion, which occurred just before 5 p.m. (1600gmt). ``It is a 
terrible scene, like from a bomb going off in Beirut,'' said a police 
spokesman. It was unknown how many people were in the building at 
the time of the explosion. Witnesses said windows were shattered in 
a wide area around the explosion.
