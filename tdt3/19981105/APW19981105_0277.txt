A Russian man who blew up his explosives-laden car at the Kremlin 
gates has been found mentally ill and remained in a Moscow hospital 
Thursday with minor injuries, officials said. Ivan Orlov, a 65-year 
old freelance journalist for a right-wing political magazine, drove 
his car across Red Square on Wednesday evening, and then jumped out 
and detonated a bomb just outside Spassky Gate, which sports a tall 
red clock tower that is one of Russia's most distinctive symbols. 
Spassky Gate, the main pedestrian entrance to the Kremlin, is heavily 
guarded. A soldier and two officers of the Kremlin guard, who rushed 
to stop Orlov, suffered numerous injuries and remained hospitalized 
Thursday. Russian ultranationalist Vladimir Zhirinovsky said Orlov 
once belonged to his party but had been expelled for ``extremism.'' 
Zhirinovsky, speaking to reporters in parliament, described Orlov 
as a ``loser.'' ``He was an enraged man, whose whole life went wrong,'' 
Zhirinovsky said. ``He had family problems and was criticized at work.'' 
Orlov worked for the magazine Russian Pravda, which carried anti-Semitic 
and nationalist articles, the Interfax news agency said. The editor 
of Russian Pravda, Alexander Aratov, told Interfax that Orlov ``hated 
President Boris Yeltsin because Yeltsin's policy had driven him to 
despair.'' Orlov also authored two books, ``The Country of Yeltsin'' 
and ``Russia Is Moaning from Its Leaders.'' Yeltsin's office is inside 
the Kremlin walls, but the president has been been in the Black Sea 
resort of Sochi since last Friday recovering from an illness. Aratov 
also said that Orlov had personal problems. He said Orlov was divorced, 
but had to share the same apartment with his former wife and her numerous 
relatives. After the car explosion, Orlov tried to shoot himself with 
a pistol, but was apprehended by police, authorities said. A psychiatrist 
examined him at a hospital on Wednesday and issued a preliminary diagnosis 
of schizophrenia, the ITAR-Tass news agency said, citing the Federal 
Security Service, which carries out the investigation. The Security 
Service said the self-made bomb contained about 500 grams (1.1 pounds) 
of explosives. Earlier reports said the bomb contained 6 kilograms 
(13 pounds) of dynamite.
