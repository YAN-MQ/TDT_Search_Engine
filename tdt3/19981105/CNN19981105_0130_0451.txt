NASA is keeping a close eye on Mitch, but says it doesn't think there 
will be a problem with Saturday's scheduled shuttle landing in Florida. 
Meanwhile, the astronauts, including senator John Glenn, got a chance 
to try out some new jokes with Jay leno Wednesday. Does senator Glenn 
keep telling you how tough it was in the old days? How cramped it 
was, how small it was? How lucky you young punks are? Well, Jay, actually, 
no. He doesn't always do that. Only when he's awake. The crew is doing 
some serious work too. It has been conducting experiments with oyster 
toadfish you see one there. This will determine how microgravity might 
affect an astronaut's sense of balance.
