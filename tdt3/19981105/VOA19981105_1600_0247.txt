A top Republican Congressman has announced plans for an expeditious 
impeachment inquiry of President Clinton in the Monica Lewinsky Sex 
and Cover-up Scandal. House Judiciary Chairman Henry Hyde says the 
panel will call special prosecutor Kenneth Starr as the only major 
witness scheduled to testify. The committee will invite Judge Starr 
to appear in public session on November 19. Judge Starr led the investigation 
and we believe his testimony will be helpful to the committee. The 
Chairman says he will ask Mr. Clinton to admit or deny certain facts 
in the matter. Mr. Hyde says he want to complete the impeachment probe 
this year. For his part, the President also hopes for a speedy conclusion. 
I want these hearing to be constitutional, fair, and expeditious. 
And at the appropriate time and the appropriate way, we will say whatever 
we intend to say. President Clinton, speaking Thursday at the White 
House.
