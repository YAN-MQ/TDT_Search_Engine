Just before our final note tonight about technology on "the cutting 
edge," some left over election news. In case you miss it. Those ballot 
propositions on Tuesday. Call it "citizen action on the cutting edge." 
In California, voters were in favor of an extra 50 cents a pack on 
cigarettes. In California, voters also said yes to gambling run by 
Indian tribes on tribal land. Voters in six states approved the medical 
use of marijuana. The right to assisted suicide was defeated in Dr. 
Jack Kevorkian's home state of Michigan. In Colorado and Washington, 
voters told the government not to interfere in even late-term abortions. 
In Hawaii and Alaska, voters encouraged state legislatures to make 
same sex marriages illegal. Animals rights were on the ballot in several 
places. In Arizona and Missouri, voters supported a ban on cockfighting. 
And missourians also said no to bear wrestling. Just in case you missed 
it.
