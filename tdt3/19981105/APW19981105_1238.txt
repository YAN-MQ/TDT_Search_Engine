Braga defeated Lokomotiv Moscow 1-0 in a Cup Winners' Cup second-round, 
second-leg game Thursday, but the Russian club advanced 3-2 on aggregate. 
Braga scored in the 11th minute with a powerful shot from Croatian 
Karoglan Mladen that bounced off Lokomotiv keeper Ruslan Nigmatullin's 
chest and into the net. Two minutes later Adelino Jordao appeared 
to have extended Braga's lead, but his goal was disallowed when he 
was ruled off-sides. Braga dominated the game, pushing Lokomotiv onto 
the defensive. Only Lokomotiv's Zaza Dzhanashia came close to equalizing, 
his best chance arriving three minutes into the second half with a 
close-range header. Braga cranked up the pressure in the second half, 
moving more players into attack and firing a long series of shots, 
but the Russians held out and advanced thanks to their 3-1 home victory 
in the first leg two weeks ago.
