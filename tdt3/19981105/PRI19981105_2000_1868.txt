Republican Chair of the House Judiciary Committee Henry Hyde says 
impeachment proceedings against President Clinton are being scaled 
down. He says the matter could be settled by the new year. The move 
follows the Republicans' disappointment at the results of the mid-term 
elections, a result President Clinton says shows Americans are fed 
up with the Lewinsky affair. The American people sent us a message 
that would break the eardrums of anyone who was listening. They want 
their business tended to. They are tired of seeing Washington focused 
on politics and personalities. They want people and their issues and 
their future taken care of, and that's what we're here to do. Henry 
Hyde says special prosecution Kenneth Starr could be the only witness 
called to the hearings. Mr. Hyde has written to President Clinton 
asking him to help him speed things up by confirming or denying certain 
matters about the Lewinsky affair.
