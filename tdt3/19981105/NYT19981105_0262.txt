When the American tenor Anthony Dean Griffey portrayed the hulking, 
half-witted Lennie in Carlisle Floyd's opera ``Of Mice and Men'' at 
the Glimmerglass Opera in Cooperstown, N.Y., in 1997, he inhabited 
the role so thoroughly it was almost frightening. The composer himself 
was deeply moved and mightily impressed. ``His was as perfectly realized 
a portrayal as anyone could hope for, both musically and dramatically,'' 
Floyd recalled recently. ``I never found even one unconvincing moment 
in his work on the stage, and believe me I looked,'' he added. ``He 
was always Lennie. Other tenors sort of attack the role. He embodies 
it.'' Griffey, who is 31, will undertake the role again when the production, 
based on the John Steinbeck novella, comes to the New York City Opera 
Saturday night. But how did this soft-spoken, baby-faced young tenor 
come to understand so intimately such a tormented and pathetic character? 
Lennie is slightly retarded, almost childlike in his innocence, and 
genuinely unaware of his sometimes uncontrollable physical power. 
Lennie and George, his friend and protector, are migrant workers in 
California during the Depression. But they constantly have difficulties 
with employers and the law because Lennie is always inadvertently 
getting them into trouble. ``I identify with Lennie deeply,'' Griffey 
said recently, taking a break from a rehearsal at City Opera. ``But, 
in a way, I identify with George just as much.'' Like Lennie, Griffey 
knows what it means to be abused and ridiculed. Growing up in High 
Point, N.C., a furniture factory town of 75,000, he lived in constant 
fear of his illiterate, abusive and alcoholic father, who mocked his 
son constantly about being overweight. At its worst, the abuse turned 
physical. On three occasions, Griffey said, his father broke his nose, 
eventually necessitating a corrective sinus operation. One time, he 
added, his father broke his jaw, and Griffey still grapples with the 
result: an underbite. But like George, Griffey had to become the protector, 
and surrogate father, to the rest of his family: his younger brother, 
Mark, and his mother, Joyce, a well-meaning woman who was nearly illiterate, 
and, like her husband, a furniture factory worker. ``She was a victim, 
too,'' Griffey said, ``and there wasn't much she could do to stop 
it.'' As the eldest, he had to lock the doors at night to the four-room, 
cockroach-infested house they lived in; he had to read the mail and 
pay the bills. Several times he had to fend off investigators from 
the child welfare department. Griffey's father, who did not return 
telephone calls seeking comment for this article, was eventually diagnosed 
with schizophrenia. ``I wound up taking care of my father,'' he said. 
``I remember once, when I was 9, calling up his employer to find out 
why my father had been fired, and ask if he could please have his 
job back.'' It was a childhood that could come right out of a gritty 
Steinbeck novel. Of course, there is a triumphant side to this story. 
Somehow, Griffey, whose early musical training came from his Baptist 
church, found the will to accomplish a great deal: a master's degree 
on scholarship from the Eastman School of Music; private studies in 
New York with Beverly Johnson, who is still his teacher and mentor; 
the advanced certificate program at Juilliard and acceptance into 
the Metropolitan Opera's Young Artists Development Program. Now, his 
career is thriving. Last spring he sang one performance in the daunting 
title role of Britten's ``Peter Grimes'' at the Met, and he will sing 
the role at the Glyndebourne Festival in England in 2000. This summer, 
he sang a widely praised performance in the title role of Mozart's 
``Idomeneo'' during the Mostly Mozart Festival at Lincoln Center. 
Most recently, he created the role of Mitch in Andre Previn's ``Streetcar 
Named Desire'' at the San Francisco Opera, a performance that will 
be broadcast over public television on Dec. 30. Griffey stands just 
over 6 feet 4 inches, and weighs over 300 pounds. He has a voice to 
match his hefty build: a natural, ringing, sizable tenor. Not surprisingly, 
he has been receiving offers to sing the weighty dramatic tenor roles 
of Wagner and Verdi. But he is wary of moving in that direction. ``I'm 
hard to cast, some people say, because they hear me with their eyes 
instead of their ears,'' he explained. ``They see this big guy and 
think: huge, dramatic heldentenor. But I actually think of myself 
as a lyric tenor.'' Indeed, more Mozart is in his future. The conductor 
Seiji Ozawa has asked Griffey to sing in some forthcoming performances 
of ``Cosi Fan Tutte'' and ``Don Giovanni'' in Tokyo. But not surprisingly, 
given his personal history, Griffey is most drawn to the anguished 
outsider roles, like Grimes, and, of course, Lennie. The lyrical quality 
of Griffey's voice humanized his portrayal of Lennie, Floyd said. 
``It's unusual for someone with a voice of that size to be able to 
sing with such delicacy,'' Floyd explained. ``His command of mezza 
voce in his top voice is remarkable. And it's critical that we fall 
in love with Lennie if we are to understand how George puts up with 
him.'' Floyd singled out a defining moment in the first scene, when 
Griffey brought a natural sweetness and vulnerability to the poignant, 
halting soliloquy when Lennie explains why he has been carrying a 
dead mouse in his coat pocket; he just likes having something soft 
that he can stroke and pet. Singing in ``Of Mice and Men'' will be 
particularly meaningful, and difficult, this time, because of the 
most recent trauma in his personal life. In June, while he was in 
North Carolina to sing at the wedding of a friend, his married brother, 
Mark, who Griffey said had been increasingly unstable, appeared at 
his big brother's hotel room in the middle of the night. ``My brother 
is diabetic, and he was out of control, eating lots of sugar, basically 
trying to kill himself,'' Griffey said. ``I had to call a magistrate 
and check him into a hospital.'' As Griffey had feared, the diagnosis 
was schizophrenia. ``Mark is doing much better now,'' Griffey said. 
``He lives in a treatment center and is on medication. We talk every 
day.'' Though his brother receives some disability benefits, and his 
mother, who has completed her high school equivalency course, has 
a job in a day-care center, they rely on Griffey, still the surrogate 
father, for financial and emotional support. His parents are now divorced; 
his father is confined to a retirement home, and they have not seen 
each other in years. Until now, Griffey had kept the most painful 
details of his story to himself. But now, he says, he feels compelled 
to talk about it. ``I want people to have an awareness that mental 
illness is not about the homeless person on the street,'' he said. 
``It can be any of us. And one family member's illness becomes the 
illness of everyone in the family.'' This is not a new concern for 
Griffey: he spent five summers working at a camp for disabled and 
retarded children in North Carolina. But there is more at stake in 
his openness. Often, when Griffey reached some performance milestone, 
well-intentioned people would come up to him afterward to offer congratulations. 
``They say: `Oh, your parents must be so proud. Are they here?' '' 
Griffey explained. ``I usually just say no. But I guess I'm tired 
of putting up a front.'' His mother has, though, attended two of his 
breakthrough performances, despite considerable trepidation. In 1995, 
while in the Met's training program, Griffey made his company debut 
in a minor role, as one of the knights in ``Parsifal.'' For the first 
time in her life, his mother traveled outside of North Carolina, taking 
the train to New York and attending the performance of this mystical, 
six-hour opera. Placido Domingo, whom she did not really know about, 
sang the title role. ``It was a major culture shock, of course,'' 
Griffey said. ``But it was still nice for me.'' Last spring, she attended 
her son's performance as Peter Grimes, traveling by air for the first 
time in her life. This just added to the pressure on Griffey. As he 
was covering the role for another tenor, he had not had a stage or 
orchestral rehearsal. Before the performance that night, and during 
it, when Grimes is not onstage, Griffey was walked through the staging 
in a rehearsal room. ``There I was, singing my first Peter Grimes 
at the Met,'' he said. ``And all I could worry about was whether my 
mother somehow had managed to follow my careful instructions and get 
herself from the hotel to her seat.'' What meant more to his mother 
was seeing Griffey on television, when he sang in a performance of 
Beethoven's Ninth Symphony, conducted by Ozawa, that opened the Winter 
Olympics in February in Nagano. Floyd called Griffey a ``rare bird 
in this music business.'' He added, ``He has maintained his authenticity 
as a person and not taken on any professional veneer, which is very 
refreshing.'' Floyd said that while moved by Griffey's dramatic sensitivity 
as a performer, he is equally impressed by his musical skills. ``Lennie 
is a very difficult role, in terms of tessitura and rhythmic intricacy, 
and Tony Griffey sings it with complete ease,'' he said. ``I never 
expected to hear it sung as accurately as he does. I had gotten used 
to hearing vocal accommodations, especially during the very physical 
scenes: the fight, the murder.'' For a man of his size, Griffey moves 
commandingly onstage, with the vigor of other hefty actors, like John 
Goodman. ``I'm not a stand-and-sing opera singer,'' Griffey said. 
``I've been told by directors and conductors that unless I lose weight, 
I will be relegated to character roles,'' he added. So far, that has 
not happened. But Griffey acknowledges the problem and, with time 
and continued support, he believes he can boost his confidence and 
get in better physical shape. ``Every morning, when I wake up in my 
new apartment, in a nice bed with nice sheets, I look for signs,'' 
he said. ``Am I OK? Did I get through all this? That's why I got all 
this education, to prove something to myself. Every time I sing, I 
have my little ritual. I tell myself, `Sing to express, not to impress.' 
And I try.'' ``I know I will even shed the weight,'' he added, ``when 
I get some of the mud off my wings.'' The composer Carlisle Floyd's 
1969 adaptation of John Steinbeck's ``Of Mice and Men'' will be performed 
Saturday evening at 8 by the New York City Opera at the New York State 
Theater. The cast of this new production includes Anthony Dean Griffey 
in the role of Lennie and Dean Ely as his friend and protector, George. 
Stewart Robertson conducts. The opera will also be performed Nov. 
13 at 8 p.m., Nov. 15 at 1:30 p.m., Nov. 19 at 7:30 p.m. and Nov. 
21 at 1:30 p.m. Tickets, $20 to $90. Information: (212) 870-5570.
