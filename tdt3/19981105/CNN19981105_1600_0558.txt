The vice president of Iraq says the country will reject any U.N. security 
resolution that demands cooperation with weapons inspectors unless 
all economic sanctions are lifted. The U.N. may issue such a demand 
today without explicitly threatening the use of force. The British 
foreign secretary says there is a legal basis to launch air strikes 
if Iraq does not comply. President Clinton says the United States 
has the support it needs to take military action. Talk of a possible 
attack isn't fazing the Iraqi people. Ben Wedeman has that. On Baghdad's 
Rashid street, shoppers buy groceries on a Thursday evening before 
the Muslim day of rest. Food prices are stable. The Iraqi dinar has 
stabilized against the dollar. There's no obvious hoarding of supplies. 
Iraq and the United Nations may be veering toward another showdown. 
But life goes on unchanged. Crisis is routine for many Iraqis. Uncertainty 
has become a fact of daily life. "It's a crisis for a month, two months, 
a year, two years, now eight years," says this shopper. "Every day 
we have a crisis. How long will this go on?" And what if diplomacy 
fails and the bombs start falling? "An attack on Baghdad? We've seen 
worse during the gulf war. We can stand up to another attack." This 
defiance is also shared by Iraqi vice president taha Yassin ramadhan, 
touring Baghdad's international trade fair. "We're not afraid," he 
says. "Why should we be afraid of America? We only fear God." Out 
at United Nations headquarters, weapons inspectors are in a holding 
pattern, allowed only to conduct routine maintenance of monitoring 
equipment. To fill the time, some of the inspectors are taking Arabic 
lessons and attending lectures on Arab society. As darkness falls, 
a wedding celebration in the street. The latest impasse over weapons 
inspections might just as well be on another planet. Ben Wedeman, 
CNN, Baghdad.
