Pope John Paul II on Thursday named the Vatican's envoy to the United 
States to a new post back at Vatican City. Archbishop Agostino Cacciavillan, 
72, had been serving in the diplomatic post in Washington since 1990. 
John Paul named the Italian to head the Administration of the Patrimony 
of the Apostolic See, the Vatican's office overseeing properties and 
investments, personnel and the Holy See's web site.
