Two leaders of Egypt's main Muslim militant group on Thursday urged 
their followers to abandon violence in favor of spreading their ideology 
in public campaigns. If their call is heeded by the grassroots of 
the Al-Gamma al-Islamiya, or Islamic Group, it could mean a significant 
fall in the eight-year insurgency that has killed more than 1,200 
people. ``Call for justice and God through speeches, lessons, advice 
and dialogue,'' says the group's spiritual leader, Sheik Omar Abdel-Rahman, 
in a letter from prison that was given to the Cairo bureau of The 
Associated Press. Abdel-Rahman, a blind Egyptian cleric, is serving 
a life sentence in Springfield, Missouri, for plotting to blow up 
several New York landmarks. A member of the Islamic Group's executive 
endorsed the sheik's views in a telephone interview with The Associated 
Press from outside Egypt. The executive, who did not want to be identified, 
said the group had developed a new policy in conjunction with Abdel-Rahman, 
who called for nonviolent methods in a statement published in the 
London-based newspaper Al-Hayat on Oct. 22. ``The group's new strategy 
is to persuade people to follow the Islamic principles peacefully 
and not by force,'' the executive said. In Cairo on Thursday, a lawyer 
who defends the group's militants in court, Muntassar el-Zayyat, said 
there has already been a shift in the group's strategy. El-Zayyat 
said the Islamic Group has not carried out a major attack since the 
massacre of 58 tourists and 4 Egyptians in Luxor, southern Egypt, 
in November 1997. ``The Luxor attack was a turning point in the group's 
history,'' he said. The massacre provoked a wave of revulsion in Egyptian 
society. While there continue to be clashes between the group's militants 
and the police, particularly in the country districts of southern 
Egypt, death tolls have tended to be in single figures and no tourists 
have been attacked. ``There must have been a decision to halt violence,'' 
el-Zayyat said. On Saturday, 19 leaders of the Islamic Group serving 
prison terms in Egypt issued a statement declaring their ``full compliance'' 
with the cease fire call of Abdel-Rahman. The cleric's statements 
carry weight because his radical fatwas, or religious rulings, have 
been the driving force behind the Islamic Group's campaign. El-Zayyat 
said the group's move could have been influenced by the success of 
the police crackdown and the recent extradition to Egypt of many of 
its members abroad. According to el-Zayyat, some 1,000 suspected Islamic 
Group supporters have been handed over to Egypt, mainly from Saudi 
Arabia, Kuwait, Jordan, Libya and Albania. Asked why the group's leadership 
has not publicly announced its change of direction, el-Zayyat said 
the leaders seemed to be waiting for the government to stop its crackdown 
and conduct negotiations. The government has always turned down calls 
for a dialogue, dismissing the group as a terrorist organization.
