The space shuttle "discovery" astronauts are starting to wrap up their 
research. Some of the 83 experiments are being shut down today. Earlier, 
mission control congratulated the crew for making 100 successful orbits 
of earth. The astronauts are scheduled to get calls from vice President 
Al Gore and former astronaut Scott Carpenter today. This afternoon, 
the crew held its final scheduled press conference. Pedro duque is 
the first Spanish shuttle astronaut. The most exciting is absolutely 
everything, I have to say. If I have to point out anything special, 
it would be when I looked out the window and the sun was coming up, 
and I saw the curvature of the earth and the corners of the sunrise, 
and then, of course, the blue planet going very fast below us. That 
lasted just a brief moment. Then we went back to work, of course, 
but I have to say that was really special. "Discovery" is scheduled 
to land at the Kennedy space center in Florida saturday.
