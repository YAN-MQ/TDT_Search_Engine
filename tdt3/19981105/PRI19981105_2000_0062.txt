the chairman of the House Judiciary Committee has announced that independent 
counsel Kenneth Starr would be the only major witness at upcoming 
impeachment hearings. Representative Henry Hyde also sent a letter 
to the president asking him to admit or deny certain allegations about 
his activity with Monica Lewinsky. NPR's Nina Totenberg reports. Hyde's 
letter to the president was offered, he said, in the spirit of gentility 
and accommodation, but his words carried a stick, as he noted that 
in 1974, President Nixon's failure to produce requested information 
was one of the offenses cited by the Judiciary Committee as grounds 
for impeachment. In an interview with NPR this afternoon, the president's 
chief impeachment lawyer, Gregory Craig, said the president would 
respond probably by early next week. This is the first time since 
the referral was sent to the House of Representatives that the House 
of Representatives has actually asked us to do anything. And I will 
repeat what we've been saying all along: We will be cooperating and 
we will work with the committee in the hope that we can have a fair 
and constitutional and expeditious process. Nina Totenberg, NPR News, 
Washington.
