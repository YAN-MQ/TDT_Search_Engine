The nation is in a state of decay. The old moral code has broken down. 
Corruption is rampant. Crime is rising. The underpinnings of civil 
society are collapsing, and gloom is filling the void. He Qinglian, 
a writer whose hot-selling book, ``China's Pitfalls,'' outlines this 
apocalyptic view of contemporary China, is taking on the nation. She 
attacks wherever she sees darkness, and that is almost everywhere. 
``No one dares say the emperor has no clothes,'' Ms. He said in a 
long conversation in this southern Chinese city on a recent afternoon. 
``They are all afraid. But I am not afraid.'' Ms. He, 42, laments 
the terrible problems racking her nation today, in her writing and 
her conversation: officials abusing power, the widening chasm between 
rich and poor; and the wholesale robbery of state property that is 
one result of China's efforts to shift from a state-run to a market 
economy. A quixotic warrior, fighting hopelessly against a tide of 
relentless commercial fervor sweeping China: so Ms. He would paint 
herself. She certainly is unusual. Most Chinese writers are hemmed 
in, not just by publishers afraid of stepping over the line of what 
is permissible, but also by the pressure of a society that demands 
conformity and attacks individual thinking like a disease. Ms. He 
is proud to be different. ``Most accounts of current history are too 
glowing, too positive,'' she said, donning a modesty that hides and 
reappears over the course of conversation. ``I felt there was a need 
for something more realistic.'' Ms. He's unblinking look at the stunning 
scale of official malfeasance and corruption rings true with ordinary 
Chinese because they are so commonplace: the factory head who walks 
off with a company's property; the provincial official who determines 
a fixed price for each appointment he makes, based on the opportunity 
for payoffs; the monopolization of business by the well connected. 
Ms. He makes much of what she calls the ``marketization of power,'' 
an academic-sounding way of saying that people in positions of authority 
are increasingly making money. She also devotes a large section of 
her book to the growing gap between rich and poor. Yet Ms. He's notions 
are so littered with exaggeration and pessimism that her punch loses 
its full force. Not all of the nation's billions in bank deposits 
are being squandered, as she asserts. Not every Chinese official is 
a crook; nor is moneymaking limited to officialdom. And not all Chinese 
people are immoral. In her voice, beneath the heavy disillusionment 
with everything she sees, lurks a hint of a disappointed idealist. 
``This is not what reform was supposed to bring,'' Ms. He said, her 
voice rising in indignation. ``Deng Xiaoping promised that some people 
would get rich first, not that they would get richer and richer, while 
the poor get poorer and poorer.'' It may seem silly for anyone, especially 
an experienced journalist and trained economist like Ms. He, to have 
ever believed the Communist Party line that market capitalism would 
equally reward all Chinese. At the same time, it is hard not to sympathize 
with her despair over how the evaporation of Communist beliefs has 
allowed the party apparatus to turn into a network of opportunism. 
``I see no way out,'' Ms. He said simply. She recalls the idealistic 
reformers who emerged in China 100 years ago, revolted by the decaying 
rule of incompetent emperors. Deflecting the suggestion, she chooses 
instead to point out that Chinese thinkers are still stuck where they 
were in 1898, proposing the adoption of Western science while preserving 
Chinese morals. ``What morals?'' she asked indignantly. ``Chinese 
people have few morals. That is the most basic problem.'' Ms. He's 
assessment of China's recent history seems to ignore the vast improvements 
in personal freedom and living standards of Chinese in all social 
strata, including writers like herself. But she brushes away the suggestion 
that she is being too pessimistic. Or that her view is colored by 
her location. Criticizing China's reform program from Shenzhen, a 
freewheeling frontier town bordering Hong Kong, is like relishing 
life in Las Vegas while harping on the excesses of U.S. capitalism. 
Little more than a village 20 years ago, Shenzhen has since boomed 
as a model economic zone. Now a living exhibit of the extremes of 
China's economic reform, Shenzhen is overflowing with banks, private 
enterprise, prostitutes and con men. Ms. He moved here 10 years ago 
from Shanghai, where she completed a degree in economics. She has 
worked as a reporter at The Shenzhen Legal News for the last five 
years. ``I don't particularly like Shenzhen, but it is where I ended 
up,'' Ms. He said. ``I feel very much like an observer, an outsider 
here.'' Lamenting the decline of morality and the flowering of adultery, 
Ms. He believes that China's basic problems are rooted in immorality 
and a lack of family structure. Like many urban Chinese, she and her 
husband put their only child, a 6-year-old son, in a sleep-away school, 
and see him one night a week. Nine publishers shied away from Ms. 
He's manuscript in 1996 when she first presented it, saying it was 
too critical. It was finally published last January after a version 
of the book appeared in Hong Kong and then won the direct endorsement 
of Liu Ji, a professor and one of President Jiang Zemin's closest 
advisers. The leadership's approval of this book is interesting, too. 
Jiang and his advisers want to portray him as opposing the corruption 
in China. They want to use a limited amount of criticism of real problems, 
as long as it does not blame the leadership. ``I'm not criticizing 
leaders, I'm criticizing the system,'' Ms. He said. ``Even the best 
leader can't thrive in a bad system.'' ``Besides,'' she added after 
a pause, ``criticizing leaders would limit my ability to speak freely.'' 
Although her book has attracted attention in a relatively small corner 
of the intelligentsia, it sold out its initial print run of 30,000 
in the first month. Another 20,000 copies were printed. ``Then the 
pirating began,'' she said. ``Several times more have been printed 
that way.'' Ms. He said she is uncomfortable with the attention her 
book _ not yet translated into English _ has attracted in the West. 
After an essay about it by Liu Binyan and Perry Link appeared in The 
New York Review of Books, she feared that it would be misrepresented 
by others. ``People are going to take what they want out of your book,'' 
she said, adding wearily, ``There's nothing you can do about it.'' 
Yet people are not welcome to take her name; Ms. He is suing a publisher 
who used her name on a book she did not write. ``Sometimes I feel 
I don't understand China at all,'' Ms. He summed up. ``The more I 
look at it, the less I understand.''
