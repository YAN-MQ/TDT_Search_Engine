President Clinton came face-to-face Thursday with the political costs 
of the world economic crisis, meeting with steel executives and union 
leaders who are demanding that Washington cut off the import of extremely 
low-cost steel _ much of it from Brazil, Russia and Korea. Steel imports 
in the United States have surged by more than 75 percent in recent 
months, and the United Steelworkers of America, a union the White 
House cannot afford to antagonize after it helped mobilize Democratic 
votes on Tuesday, has been insisting for months that the administration 
take action. After their recent comeback, almost all of the country's 
major steelmakers now are cutting production and some have begun layoffs, 
as prices for steel decline to some of the lowest levels in six years. 
But Clinton, as one of his economic aides said the other day, has 
``no good options.'' Any move to limit the flow of low-cost steel 
here runs the risk of undercutting the recovery of some of the nations 
that are hardest hit by the economic crisis. Moreover, it would increase 
costs for automakers, construction firms and other manufacturers _ 
potentially making their goods less competitive. So in lengthy meetings 
and dinners with Commerce Secretary William Daley and Treasury Secretary 
Robert E. Rubin, among others, the steel union officials and top executives 
_ who rarely find themselves on the same side of a bargaining table 
_ have been engaged in a detailed debate over Clinton's choices. The 
most likely option is that the president would pressure countries 
to reduce steel exports to the United States, a step Japanese officials 
say they are already taking. In the meeting at the White House Thursday 
evening, Clinton indicated that he would take up the issue later this 
month during his trip through Asia that includes visits to Korea and 
Japan. Eventually, the United States could raise tariffs on imported 
steel. But it can only impose those ``anti-dumping duties'' if the 
United States International Trade Commission finds that the imported 
steel is being sold here at unfairly low prices, causing injury to 
American firms. Such duties were recently imposed on stainless steel 
coil plate imported from Taiwan South Africa, Italy, Canada and South 
Korea. But in the broader complaint filed by the steel industry, the 
case may not be clear cut. Foreign officials insist that some of the 
price cuts did not result from ``dumping,'' but were created by the 
sharp devaluation of Asian and Russian currencies. That exchange rate 
advantage makes all goods imported from those countries less expensive 
in the United States. In fact, the surge in exports from the hardest-hit 
countries is exactly what the International Monetary Fund has tacitly 
been seeking as a way to boost foreign reserves and rescue faltering 
economies. Export increases are factored into the IMF's recovery plans 
for several nations, especially Thailand, Korea and Indonesia. And 
the United States Treasury approved those strategies. Clinton acknowledged 
the problem at an earlier meeting with steel officials last month, 
noting that ``the yen got too week, and it led, for example, to the 
breathtaking imports of Japanese steel, which hurt a lot of our industry, 
people and workers.'' But Clinton's aides point out that after further 
study they determined that the problem was immensely complicated _ 
and that every proposed solution carried a significant cost. ``If 
you take measures to protect the steel industry it hurts the auto 
industry,'' one White House official noted recently. ``Eventually, 
that hurts sales and other workers.'' The industry argues that the 
damage is already starting. Weirton Steel, the seventh largest steelmaker, 
announced recently it was laying off 300 workers, or nearly 9 percent 
of its hourly workers, and it says it may have to dismiss more workers. 
At the same time, the Clinton administration needs the steel workers. 
Vice President Al Gore has been wooing the industry's leaders, who 
are suspicious of the administration's free-trade leanings, and opposed 
the effort to expand the president's right to negotiate trade agreements 
that can be approved or turned down by Congress _ but not amended. 
The divisive arguments over that authority, called ``fast track,'' 
are likely to be revived next year. Clinton's aides are also worried 
about a revival of trade tensions around the world as the American 
trade deficit mounts each month. Charlene Barshefsky, the United States 
Trade Representative, has warned that the current account deficit 
_ the broadest measure of trade flows _ could hit $300 billion. Daley 
has warned of ``a major political backlash that is brewing'' if the 
flood of imports begins to cost American jobs.
