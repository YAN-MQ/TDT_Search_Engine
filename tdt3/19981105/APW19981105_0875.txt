Warsaw was hit with long traffic jams Thursday after a main water 
pipe burst near the heavily-traveled east-west thoroughfare. Firefighters 
and rescuers waded in water up to their waists to locate and seal 
the leak. High water covered the thoroughfare and some 400 meters 
(yards) of the Trasa Lazienkowska bridge, that spans the Vistula river, 
causing kilometers-long (miles-long) jams, forcing police to reroute 
traffic.
