For many of our FM and medium wave listeners, your local stations 
will be taking a two minute break at this time. This is VOA News now. 
Today is Thursday, November 5, 1998. On this date in 1911, pilot Calbraith 
Rogers completed the first flight across the United States. When he 
landed his aircraft in Long Beach, California. Rogers attempted the 
flight to win a $50,000 prize offered by a newspaper publisher for 
the first flight across the country that took less than 30 days. Rogers's 
aircraft was little more than an oversized box-kite. Powered by a 
35 horsepower engine. Rogers took off from Sheepshead Bay, New York 
and covered 134 kilometers in 105 minutes of flight on his first day. 
He called that a great start. However, take-off the next morning was 
more typical of the venture. He crashed into a chicken coop and demolished 
the aircraft. The mechanics, who followed in a special train, rebuilt 
the plane in 40 hours. And Rogers was back in the air. The pilot spent 
a total of 82 hours and 10 minutes in the air. In 70 hops over 49 
days to get across the country. Although he did not make the deadline 
for winning the cash prize, Calbraith Rogers became a national celebrity 
for demonstrating the transcontinental flight was possible. When Pilot 
Rogers landed in Long Beach, the only remaining original parts of 
his aircraft were the rudder and some wing struts. Wow. Well, we'd
