Wouldn't you know it. Brian Laudrup, expected to sign as early as 
Friday with FC Copenhagen, got the deciding goal to advance Chelsea 
to the quarterfinals of the Cup Winners Cup _ ousting what is expected 
to be his new team. Laudrup, a former Danish international, scored 
Thursday on a header in the 32nd off a perfect cross from Graeme LeSaux 
to give Chelsea _ the holders _ a 1-0 lead to advance 2-1. The clubs 
drew two weeks ago in London 1-1. LeSaux's cross was headed off the 
crossbar by teammate Pierluigi Casiraghi, but it bounded out to Laudrup 
who headed it home to draw applause at Parken Stadium. Dan Petrescu 
substituted for Laudrup in the 66th. The 29-year-old Laudrup said 
last week he wanted to return to his native Denmark, and Chelsea gave 
him permission to go despite only three months with the London club 
after moving from Glasgow Rangers. Copenhagen officials hoped to announce 
Laudrup's signing after this match, although Laudrup said he planned 
to return to London for a Sunday league match at West Ham. The Danes, 
who challenged Chelsea on even terms in London, were an even match 
for the Englishmen Thursday in a wide-open game with both clubs missing 
several scoring chances as Chelsea's Ed De Goey and opposite number 
Michael Stensgaard produced quality saves. The Danes' best chance 
to score came in the 62nd when Chelsea defender Celestine Babayaro, 
defending an open goal, stopped a point-blank shot with his foot.
