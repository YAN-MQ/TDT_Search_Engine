Floods engulfed hundreds of houses across Eastern Europe Thursday, 
forcing thousands to be evacuated as rivers from Slovenia to Romania 
burst their banks. There were no immediate reports of injuries. Floods 
hit Slovenia hardest, with heavy rains inundating large parts of the 
country, sending water pouring into hundreds of homes and causing 
the closure of main traffic corridors. Slovene state radio reported 
the area of Celje, northeast of the capital Ljubljana, suffered the 
most severe damage. About 2,000 firemen and rescue teams were sent 
to help thousands of people whose houses were flooded, as up to a 
half meter (nearly two feet) of water, flowed through streets. The 
railway and highway linking Ljubljana and the northern city of Maribor 
were closed due to the storm and flooding. Several other areas were 
left without electricity and water. The situation was worse in Slovenia 
where the state-run news agency STA reported that a number of local 
roads have been closed for traffic due to floods or slides. Officials 
warned that the level of the Sava River, which runs across the country 
and through Ljubljana, would reach a critical level in the evening. 
The government held an emergency session, approving funds to repair 
destroyed infrastructure. In Romania, border police evacuated 6,000 
people from nine villages after the Tisa (Tisza) River overflowed 
after days of heavy rain, which took local officials by surprise. 
People were forced to spend the night outdoors in the pouring rain, 
said Col. Teodor Cristea of the border police in the city of Baia 
Mare, 450 kilometers (280 miles) northwest of Bucharest. He said the 
army would send in supplies of food and tents. The Tisa flows from 
western Ukraine, along the Romanian border through Hungary and Yugoslavia 
into the Danube. A few homes in the Czech Republic were under high 
water. In Hungary, there were flood alerts, but water levels were 
subsiding.
