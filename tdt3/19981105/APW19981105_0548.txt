Former World War II slave laborers under the Nazis said on Thursday 
they would fight a plan by Germany's government and industry to set 
up a compensation fund, saying the proposed settlement was an attempt 
to bypass their claims. ``The survivors are ready to work toward a 
solution _ but they will not be shut out and the German government 
cannot stop their claims,'' the group said in a statement faxed from 
their lawyer's office in the United States. Before taking office last 
month, Chancellor Gerhard Schroeder's government said a group comprising 
government and industry will work out a plan to settle back-wage claims 
from World War II-era slave laborers. Among those participating in 
the group are the bosses of Allianz insurance company, Dresdner and 
Deutsche banks, Volkswagen, BMW, Siemens, Krupp, Degussa and BASF. 
It will be headed by Schroeder's chief of staff, Bodo Hombach. The 
plan is an attempt to ``bargain away our claims,'' survivor Paul Frenkel 
said in the statement. An alternative group comprising class action 
claimants, slave labor survivors, the Jewish Claims Conference, German 
industry and banks and the German government should meet and agree 
on a settlement, group lawyer Michael Witti said in the statement. 
The survivors called on the German government to recognize their right 
to settle their claims individually or on a class action basis, pointing 
to the recent 1.25 billion dollar settlement reached with Swiss banks. 
New York-based lawyer Ed Fagan and Munich-based Witti will accompany 
representatives of the group on a two-day trip to Frankfurt Friday 
and Saturday, where they will press their claims.
