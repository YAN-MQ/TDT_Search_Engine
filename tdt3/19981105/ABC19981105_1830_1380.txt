As we said, change in the twinkling of an eye. When we come back -- 
technology on "the cutting edge." The silicon eye. I want to know 
I'm headed in the right direction. I want to keep my options open. 
I...I do want to take care of my family. I want to give something 
back. I want to learn, find what's right for me, be ready for anything... 
make the right choices. I want to find the people who can get me there. 
American express financial advisors can help you decide what you want 
to do and how to get there. I want to say I made a difference. I want 
to do more. How's Max doing? He's doing O.K. so how long before.. 
Max can play again? Well, the vet said Max will be back to his old 
self in a couple of days. Even the interior of the Chevy blazer was 
designed to make you feel at ease. A little security... in an insecure 
world.
