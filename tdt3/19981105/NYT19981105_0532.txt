In an embarrassing blunder that illustrates the pitfalls facing the 
government in the Information Age, the Bureau of Labor Statistics 
inadvertently posted part of its closely guarded jobs report on the 
Internet a day before the report's scheduled release. As a result, 
some investors got an advance peek at the economy's performance in 
October. ``We have procedures in place,'' Katharine Abraham, the bureau's 
commissioner, said. ``They obviously didn't work.'' By the end of 
the day, Ms. Abraham said she would not be able to explain what went 
wrong until Friday at the earliest. Monthly job data are normally 
released on a Friday, usually the first one of the following month. 
The main concern about security involves the circulation of information 
within the government. The bureau normally releases manufacturing 
employment figures to the Federal Reserve two days before the official 
report is released so that the central bank can use it to estimate 
industrial production. On Thursday night, it provides a complete report 
to the Council of Economic Advisers, which briefs the president's 
economics team and passes the data along to the Treasury and the Fed. 
Thursday's glitch was not the first involving the bureau's four-year-old 
World Wide Web site. Two years ago, a report on producer prices was 
posted the night before it was scheduled for release. Unlike Thursday, 
though, bureau staff almost immediately discovered the mistake and 
retrieved the report. This time, a full 24 hours before the jobs report 
was scheduled to be released, a table reviewing job increases and 
declines by industry was mistakenly posted on the bureau's Web site 
(www.bls.gov). It was a background table prepared for internal use 
that had only recently been added to the charts the bureau makes available 
with its jobs report. Raymond Stone, head of the Stone &AMP; McCarthy 
brokerage firm, was one individual who found it while browsing the 
site. Stone alerted the bureau _ but also shared the report, which 
showed that job growth in October was much softer than had been expected, 
with his clients. ``Some people use the Web to make vacation plans, 
some people use it to buy a new car,'' he said on CNBC Thursday. ``I 
go look at economic data.'' The leak did not particularly rattle financial 
markets. ``We're lucky that markets are fixated on other things and 
that they're paying much less attention to economic data,'' Bruce 
Steinberg, chief economist at Merrill Lynch &AMP; Co., said. ``It's 
a pretty shocking event, and it had an impact, but it didn't have 
the impact it could have had.'' Lawrence Katz, an economist at Harvard 
University and a former chief economist at the Labor Department, said 
he assumed the leak had been an innocent mistake. ``In the past, even 
when there have been rumors of a leak, it's been taken very seriously,'' 
he said.
