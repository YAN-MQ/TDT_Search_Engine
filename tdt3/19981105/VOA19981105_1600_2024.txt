The U.S. mediator on Kosovo reports some progress in indirect peace 
talks between Belgrade and Ethnic Albanians. Although a scheduled 
meeting between him and Yugoslav President Slobodan Mulosovich is 
canceled. Meanwhile, the International War Crimes Tribunal investigating 
atrocities in Kosovo has canceled this week's planned visit to Belgrade. 
Because Yugoslavia refuses to issue visas for the U.N. Team. Western 
diplomats are rushing to set up observer missions in Kosovo. Even 
as some low-intensity fighting continues there. As Philip Smucker 
reports from Prisrin, in Southern Kosovo. The observer missions are 
being set up by the Organization for Security and Cooperation in Europe. 
A group of OSCE peace observers from Britain, who are on their way 
to set up operations in Prisrin. Had their first brush with fighting 
on Thursday. British Lieutenant Colonel, David Myer said a Serbian 
Army unit in front of the British convoy came under fire. But no injuries 
were reported. In a similar incident, Serbian police said they killed 
a uniformed Ethnic Albanian rebel near the town of Klina. The British 
team was on its way to set up one of the first OSCE offices outside 
the capitol Prisrin. Fifty British observers, most of them with military 
experience, are expected to man the outpost. The OSCE mission will 
monitor a tense cease fire between Serb security forces and the rebel 
Ethnic Albanian Kosovo Liberation Army. The OSCE mandate also includes 
brokering cease fires. And helping to create an ethnically mixed police 
force in Kosovo. Philip Smucker for VOA News, Prisrin.
