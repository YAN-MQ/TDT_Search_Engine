Aleksandras Lileikis, charged with sending scores of Jews to their 
deaths during the Nazi occupation, appeared in court Thursday in a 
wheelchair and proclaimed his innocence, but was rushed away in an 
ambulance minutes later. Doctors said the 91-year-old Lileikis may 
have suffered a heart attack and the judge postponed the court proceedings 
until Monday. Lileikis' trial was to have begun in September, but 
was delayed when his lawyers said he was too ill to come to court. 
The court appointed a panel of doctors to examine him, which determined 
he was in poor health but fit to stand trial. Lileikis was head of 
the security police in Vilnius during the 1941-44 Nazi occupation. 
He is charged with genocide for allegedly turning over more than 70 
Jews to a Nazi execution squad. ``I was working for my nation and 
my country for all my life and now I am old and weak. But I can still 
say I did nothing wrong in my lifetime,'' Lileikis told the court 
from his wheelchair. Minutes later, his hands began trembling, he 
started reciting the Lord's Prayer and he asked for more air. His 
daughter rushed to his side, crying and handing pills to her father. 
The judge called for a recess and asked doctors to examine Lileikis, 
who was taken to an adjoining room and then rushed away in an ambulance. 
It is the first Nazi war-crimes trial in the countries of the former 
Soviet Union. Some Jewish groups have criticized Lithuania for being 
slow in beginning the trial, alleging that officials hope Lileikis 
will die before the start of proceedings that would bring painful 
reminders of the slaughter of the occupation years. About 90 percent 
of Lithuania's 240,000 pre-war Jews died during the Nazi occupation. 
Lileikis emigrated to the United States in 1955, and lived in Norwood, 
Massachusetts, where he worked for a publishing house. He returned 
to Lithuania in 1996 after a U.S. court took steps to revoke his citizenship 
and deport him.
