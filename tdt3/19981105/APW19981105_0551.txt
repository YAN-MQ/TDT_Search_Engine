Finance Minister Oskar Lafontaine met on Thursday with Germany's top 
central bankers, but apparently failed to end a row over his demands 
for an interest rate cut to boost the economy and reduce unemployment. 
The visit, which the government described as a courtesy call, was 
Lafontaine's first as finance minister to the fortress-like German 
central bank, or Bundesbank, located in a Frankfurt suburb. The talks 
involved ``an intense exchange of views'' about fiscal and monetary 
policy, the Finance Ministry said. A particular focus was the development 
of money-market rates, which are falling in eight European countries 
including Britain, the statement said. It said Lafontaine told the 
central bankers he wanted good cooperation and insisted that ``no 
member of the government is questioning the independence of the Bundesbank 
and the European Central Bank,'' Lafontaine has provoked strong debate 
with his repeated calls for interest rate cuts and for the Bundesbank 
to factor in cutting unemployment and boosting growth when deciding 
monetary policy. Many central bankers regard the suggestions as heresy, 
saying their job is to maintain steady prices and low inflation, not 
get involved in problems they say are structural and can only be solved 
by broader economic, or political, measures. The bank announced after 
the meeting of its central council that it left rates unchanged, as 
widely expected. Increasingly, analysts are suggesting Lafontaine 
may be trying to divert attention from the government's promises to 
cut unemployment by making the central bank co-responsible for the 
issue in the eyes of the public. Lafontaine was trying to make the 
Bundesbank a scapegoat because the new government ``has presented 
far too few recipes against unemployment,'' said Ulrich Ramm, head 
economist at Commerzbank, speaking on Inforadio Berlin-Brandenburg. 
The leader of the Federal Union of German Banks, Manfred Weber, called 
on the government ``to do its economic homework,'' adding he shared 
its view that cutting unemployment was the country's most pressing 
challenge. ``Where I completely disagree is in the measures and instruments 
with which we can achieve it,'' Weber said, adding he hoped Lafontaine's 
meeting with central bankers would clear up the row. The new government 
was elected largely on promises to cut unemployment, which on Thursday 
dropped to 10.1 percent, a slight dip from last month.
