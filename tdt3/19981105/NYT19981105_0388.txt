Anti-Semitism has spread in Switzerland in reaction to the recent 
scrutiny of the country's wartime actions, a government commission 
said Thursday. A yearlong s4udy found that inhibitions against the 
open expression of racist views had been swept away during the controversy 
over Switzerland's responsibility to compensate Holocaust victims 
for assets lost during World War II. The controversy broadened into 
a wide-ranging examination of Switzerland's role in the war. ``The 
Swiss believed that they were different, that they didn't have dirty 
hands, that they were specially protected against all that happened 
around them,'' said Doris Angst Yilmaz, the commission's secretary 
general. ``This study showed that we are like our neighbors. We are 
not special or different, even in anti-Semitism.'' The Swiss Jewish 
Federation said the finding ``shows there is a significant need in 
Switzerland to improve education so that there is better knowledge 
of, and communication with, the Jewish minority.'' Of the seven million 
people living in Switzerland, about 17,500 are Jews. Although prejudice 
has existed in Switzerland for centuries, the most famous example 
occurred in 1938, when Switzerland asked Germany and Austria to stamp 
a ``J'' on the passports of Jews, a practice used to identify them 
in order to bar their entry into Switzerland. The report found that 
prejudice against Jews is not organized and is seldom linked to right-wing 
extremism. ``You find anti-Semitism here in daily life, not in organized 
demonstrations,'' said Prof. Georg Kreis, a Basel University history 
professor who specializes in World War II and who led the study. ``It 
is not confined only to one class, but exists throughout society.'' 
The ``political crisis concerning Switzerland's self-image'' and a 
recent economic downturn combined to bring anti-Jewish feeling into 
the open, according to the report. ``Latent anti-Semitism is again 
being increasingly expressed in public by word and by deed,'' the 
report said. ``There often emerges a dangerous differentiation between 
`the Swiss' and `the Jews.''' `` `The Jews' were the villains and 
`the Swiss' were the victims,'' Mrs. Yilmaz summed up. The study was 
undertaken after Jean Pascal Delamuraz, then the Swiss President, 
in provocative remarks in December 1996, labeled Jewish demands for 
compensation ``blackmail.'' His remarks helped make Jewish stereotypes 
acceptable and anti-Semitic sentiment burst into public view, the 
report said. He later apologized, but the report said his view was 
supported by a large number of Swiss, as shown in letters to newspapers, 
remarks in the media and comments in markets and other public places. 
Jewish groups and prominent individuals began receiving threatening 
letters. Although the commission completed its report prior to the 
agreement in August by Switzerland's largest banks to pay $1.25 billion 
to Holocaust survivors, the report warned that the deal ``may arouse 
new signs of anti- Semitism in Switzerland.'' Switzerland signed international 
human rights accords in 1994, and later 55 percent of the Swiss voters 
approved anti-racism laws, similar to those in France and Germany, 
that forbid disparaging the Holocaust. In 1995 the Federal Commission 
against Racism was established. The report said this legislation ended 
Switzerland's position as ``a hub for slanderous anti-Semitic and 
`negationist' material in Europe,'' a role that had grown because 
the country lacked legal barriers. Mrs. Yilmaz said there are about 
100 bias cases currently in Swiss courts, with 55 involving charges 
of anti-Semitism.
