Finally, debris from a plane has fallen on a barn in Louisville, Kentucky. 
That is currently the home of one of the fastest racehorses in the 
world. Pieces of a United Parcel Service plane landed on a barn Wednesday 
at the famed Churchill Downs. No racetrack personnel or any of the 
horses were injured. The plane made a successful landing at Louisville 
International Airport. Skip Away, a top contender for the upcoming 
Breeder's Cup Classic on Saturday, was in the barn where the debris 
landed. Federal Aviation officials say birds may have been sucked 
into the engine to the plane, causing damaged parts to fly out.
