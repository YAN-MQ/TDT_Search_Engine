A Dutch spoof of the BBC children's show ``Teletubbies'' showing the 
popular characters simulating sex and violence could land its makers 
in court, a programming director has warned. ``Tuberculosistubbies,'' 
made by irreverent youth channel BNN, features brightly colored characters 
bearing a more-than-passing resemblance to Po, Laa-Laa, Tinky-Winky 
and Dipsy. But instead of the happy, harmless storylines of the British 
Broadcasting Corp. program, the Tuberculosistubbies are shown simulating 
sexual intercourse and fighting. As if that isn't bad enough, fans 
of the Tuberculosistubbies are now posting obscene messages on a Dutch 
Teletubbies site on the World Wide Web, shocking parents whose children 
visit the site. ``In total, 30,000 adults and children visit our site,'' 
Cees Schippers, programming director for Dutch broadcaster Teleac/Not, 
told the daily Trouw newspaper for Thursday's editions. ``Since the 
parody ... many people are visiting the site to pour filthy language 
onto the screen. Parents are concerned because they don't want their 
children exposed to that kind of language,'' he said. Schippers said 
BBC representatives had asked to see a videotape of the show and may 
consider legal action against BNN. The BBC did not immediately return 
a call seeking comment Thursday. The Tuberculosistubbies are shown 
on BNN's Sunday night program. This week, the show agreed to remove 
the offending item from a Monday afternoon repeat because it would 
have aired just before Dutch children's programming got under way.
