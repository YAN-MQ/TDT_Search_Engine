A youth who knocked down and killed two elderly sisters while speeding 
in the Porsche he had received for his 18th birthday just days before 
was sentenced to four years' detention Thursday. Satvinder Nijjer, 
now 19, was convicted last month of two counts of causing death by 
dangerous driving. In ordering Nijjer confined to the youth facility, 
Judge John Warner said he was traveling at ``grossly excessive'' speed 
when he knocked down and killed Lavinia and Winifred Carrington, 78 
and 76, during a school lunch break last year. ``I am sure you were 
showing your friends just what the car could do,'' the judge said. 
Of the Carrington sisters, he said, ``Mercifully, it would appear 
they did not know what had happened to them.'' The sisters, who were 
hit from behind when the red convertible Porsche 944 jumped the curb 
going 70 mph (112 kph), had been returning home from a lunch celebrating 
Winifred's 76th birthday. The judge noted a number of mitigating factors 
in Nijjer's case, including the ``immaturity and lack of judgment'' 
that come with his young age. He added that Nijjer's father, Surinder, 
who bought him the car, ``had a lot to answer for'' and shared the 
blame for the tragedy. ``You were provided with a very powerful car 
by your father which was well beyond your capabilities,'' Warner said. 
``You were given no tuition. ``He may bear no legal responsibly, but 
in my view he has a lot to answer for. If he had thought about this, 
he would have known this was an accident waiting to happen.''
