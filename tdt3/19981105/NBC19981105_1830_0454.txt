When the voters speak, politicians listen. And tonight, fresh developments 
on the impeachment front. The man in charge of the impeachment hearings 
announced a scaled-back plan today. Claire Shipman joins us from the 
White House. Tom, the impeachment inquiry is well under way and it 
may be a Shorter, more superficial process than first envisioned. 
But Hyde firmly shifted the Burden of that speedy process to the White 
House today with this letter asking the president to confirm or deny 
81 allegations. Henry Hyde unveiled his hearings schedule today, announcing 
he hoped to wrap the inquiry up by the end of the year and call only 
one major witness -- Ken Starr. With the president's cooperation, 
we will meet our goal of finishing by the end of the year. The cooperation 
he is looking for is an answer to this letter -- 81 questions which 
he says would avoid a long fight over details. The first few questions 
make clear the committee is pursing the question of perjury. "Do you 
admit or deny that you are the chief law enforcement officer of the 
United States of America?" And others like -- "do you admit or deny 
that on or about January 9, 1998, you received a message from Vernon 
Jordan indicating that Monica Lewinsky had received a job offer in 
New York" none of the questions specifically concern the president's 
sexual relationship with Lewinsky. Democratic sources speculate that 
Hyde believed that would not go over well with the public. The president 
would say little about Hyde's schedule. I have nothing to say about 
that. I want these hearings to be constitutionally fair and expeditious. 
Behind the scenes, the president's legal team is wary. They like the 
timetable, in terms of the letter, we're told the president and his 
team plan to answer as soon as possible, but we're told that the president 
certainly won't admit to anything that amounts to perjury or obstruction 
of justice. What's the inchildrenation there? Are they going to tough 
it out or strike a deal? That's what they would most like. But they 
don't know with whom to strike the deal, it seems Hyde is intent on 
going on with the hearings, and this may not be able to finish were 
this to get to the house or the Senate.
