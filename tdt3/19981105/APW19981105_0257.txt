A Polish leader urged visiting German Chancellor Gerhard Schroeder 
on Thursday to pledge clear support for Poland's swift entry into 
the European Union. Schroeder, on his third foreign trip since taking 
office Oct. 27, was meeting Prime Minister Jerzy Buzek and President 
Aleksander Kwasniewski. Aside from European integration, the leaders 
were expected to discuss reparations for Nazi-era slave laborers from 
Poland, a painful issue in the two neighbors' troubled past. Schroeder's 
visit to Germany's biggest eastern neighbor was intended to show the 
significance of German-Polish ties, which have fully recovered from 
decades of enmity over World War II only after the fall of the Iron 
Curtain. Poland is Germany's biggest business partner in eastern Europe 
and in line to join NATO and the EU. But Poles were alarmed by Schroeder's 
call for ``realism'' in accepting new EU members soon after his election. 
His predecessor, Helmut Kohl, pushed strongly to get Poland into the 
European Union. ``I hope that today's visit by Chancellor Schroeder 
will be an unambiguous signal that Germany will support Poland's entry 
into the European Union,'' Foreign Minister Bronislaw Geremek said 
on Polish radio. Deputy foreign minister Guenter Verheugen, traveling 
with Schroeder to Warsaw, said Germany would seek to have Poland join 
the EU in 2002. But Kohl's suggestion that it could happen by 2000 
was ``not serious,'' he said. ``It is Poland's task to create the 
conditions for EU membership,'' Verheugen told reporters on Schroeder's 
plane. Foreign Minister Joschka Fischer reassured Polish leaders on 
a visit to Warsaw last week that Germany supports an EU spot for Poland, 
but he left his hosts uneasy by failing to name a date.
