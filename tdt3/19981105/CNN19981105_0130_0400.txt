Health officials are warning of a possible cholera outbreak in parts 
of central America flooded by Mitch. They say polluted water could 
become a breeding ground for the disease. Meantime, the death toll 
from the storm has risen to 9,000. Most of the deaths have been in 
Honduras and Nicaragua. More assistance is coming from the United 
States. $10 million has been rounded up from various U.S. sources. 
In addition, European nations approved $8 million, and Taiwan has 
added $2.5 million. Mexico is launching one of the biggest airlifts 
in its history.
