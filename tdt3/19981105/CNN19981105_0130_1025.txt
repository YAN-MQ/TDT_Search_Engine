Citibank and chase Manhattan corporation aren't calling the launch 
of smart card technology a complete failure, but those banks say they 
do need to rethink their strategy. Bruce Francis reports. Upscale 
Deli zabar's is the unofficial capital of Manhattan's upper west side, 
the neighborhood picked for the smart card test. If you can make it 
here, you can make it anywhere in the neighborhood. But smart cards 
that store value for use as electronic cash didn't make it, despite 
the powerful backing of chase and citibank. There was a tremendous 
amount of work for the merchant, which, you know, after a deal of 
time, we didn't want to put up with. The few customers that did use 
it, when it was successful, they seemed to be pleased. But every time 
there was a glitch in the system, they were furious. So, many stuck 
to cash, credit or debit cards. I use my credit cards when I want 
to charge something. And I like to use cash, because I like to see 
the money. It looked too complicated. You had to fill out all kinds 
of forms at the bank. And then there were credit restrictions on it. 
And, you know, life is complicated. The trial's failure comes two 
years after a similar program at the Atlanta games proved to be a 
failure of Olympic proportions. Rival Mastercard has also ended two 
other trials. But citibank is undeterred. We knew from all the prior 
programs that keeping merchants trained as usage slowly builds is 
a difficult task, and indeed -- and indeed it was. But we have firsthand 
experience now that we're incorporating it into all our future programs. 
In future trials, smart cards will probably have more functions, like 
being used for a public transportation pass or a phone card as well. 
And consumers will probably be offered more perks, like discounts 
or frequent-flyer miles. Bruce Francis, "CNN Financial News," New
