CNN sports is next, and later -- a former pro wrestler prepares for 
the rough-and-tumble life of the political Arena. If you could accompany 
your data on its trip overseas the experience would be alarming. Local 
carriers handing it to national carriers over to cable carriers... 
till you don't know who has your data. Unless you send it through 
here. With the one and only company that owns the entire network-- 
local, national, and international. So you know who has your data. 
On-net. From MCI Worldcom. Duane Walker, "CNN Headline Sports."
