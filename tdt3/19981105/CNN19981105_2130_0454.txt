Astronauts aboard the shuttle "discovery" are in the final stages 
of their studies comparing space travel with aging. Over the course 
of the day, the crew conducted a number of interviews. 77-year-old 
astronaut John Glenn says more people his age should Venture into 
space. I think, though, before they do something like that, they would 
want to send more people my age up on a flight like this, where you 
get more experience. I'll be a data point of one when we get back, 
and obviously, for it to be more meaningful for a database, you need 
more people. I don't see any reason in the future why though you couldn't 
look forward to more elderly people being studied on the international 
space station as well as on shorter missions I'm on right now. Think 
you need more people, though, before you make that next step. Forecasters 
are predicting good weather for "discovery's" scheduled landing saturday 
at the Kennedy space center in Florida.
