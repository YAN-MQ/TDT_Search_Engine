Luigi Simoni might finally be running out of second chances. The Internazionale 
of Milan coach, recipient of several ultimatums during his rocky one-plus 
seasons at the helm, desperately needs to halt a three-game losing 
streak in the Serie A Sunday night when the club faces cross-city 
rival AC Milan. Touted at the start of the season as a title contender, 
Inter has struggled with inconsistent defense and injuries to star 
strikers Ronaldo and Roberto Baggio. After consecutive losses to Lazio 
of Rome, league leader Juventus of Turin and mediocre Bari, Inter 
has a 3-1-3 record, good only for eighth place in the 18-team standings. 
One of the biggest criticisms aimed at Simoni is that he is too defense-minded, 
yet only two clubs have allowed more goals than the 12 Inter has given 
up. That could be a problem against Milan, which is enjoying a rebound 
from back-to-back poor seasons. Milan is tied for third place with 
a 4-1-2 record, led by the goalscoring of Germany's Oliver Bierhoff 
(five goals) and Brazil's Leonardo (four), who had been sidelined 
with injury but is expected to start Sunday. The Milan-Inter showdown, 
before what is expected to be a sellout crowd of about 85,000 at hallowed 
San Siro Stadium, highlights an otherwise drab eighth round schedule. 
Juventus _ which leads the league with 16 points, one ahead of Fiorentina 
_ travels to Udinese, while Fiorentina hosts Venezia. Other games 
have AS Roma at Bologna; AC Parma at Bari; Lazio of Rome hosting Empoli; 
Piacenza at Calgiari; Vicenza at Perugia, and Sampdoria of Genoa hosting 
Salernitana. Simoni could use a breakthrough game from Ronaldo. The 
Brazilian is still working his way back from a long layoff with tendinitis 
in both knees. He came off the bench last weekend and nearly led Inter 
past Bari, but it was too little too late in the 3-2 defeat. ``I am 
happy about what he has done so far,'' the coach said of his star. 
``He needs to improve little by little, and I am sure that slowly 
he will come back as he was before.'' While Nicola Ventola (already 
a career-high five goals), Chile's Ivan Zamorano and Andrea Pirlo 
have been scoring enough in Ronaldo's absence, the backline has been 
rather dismal. Simoni has even tried swtiching Argentine midfielder 
Diego Simeone back to sweeper in order to shore up the defense. Portugal's 
Paolo Sousa, who had returned from injury to provide some stability 
at midfield, will miss Sunday's game through suspension. Milan's game 
revolves around Bierhoff, in the midst of another solid season. After 
last year's breakthrough (league-best 27 goals for small-time Udinese), 
the German has adapted well to playing under the spotlight. His physical 
style could give Inter fits, unless muscular Nigerian defender Taribo 
West is given a man-to-man assignment.
