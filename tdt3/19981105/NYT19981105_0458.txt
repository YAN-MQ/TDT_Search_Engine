Forging ahead with an impeachment inquiry that most Americans say 
Congress should drop, Rep. Henry Hyde on Thursday asked President 
Clinton to say flatly whether he lied under oath, tampered with witnesses, 
or obstructed justice. In a nine-page letter, Hyde, chairman of the 
House Judiciary Committee, asked Clinton to admit or deny 81 selected 
findings gleaned from the Whitewater independent counsel's 445-page 
report on the president's affair with Monica Lewinsky. The Illinois 
Republican said the president could speed the process along by not 
disputing the findings. But many of the questions are pointed and 
ask Clinton to admit to accusations that the president and his advisers 
have strenuously denied since the independent counsel, Kenneth Starr, 
sent his scathing report to Congress. Take question No. 21, for instance: 
``Do you admit or deny that you gave false and misleading testimony 
under oath when you stated during your deposition in the case of Jones 
v. Clinton on January 17, 1998, that you did not know if Monica Lewinsky 
had been subpoenaed to testify in that case?'' Answering ``yes'' to 
questions like this, Hyde said, would help him wrap up the inquiry 
by year's end. ``The cooperation we'd like is to admit facts that 
are already, we think, established in the record. That gets us from 
here to there rather quickly.'' White House lawyers declined to comment 
Thursday night on Hyde's letter, but they are certain to balk at many 
of the conclusions drawn straight from Starr's report that they consider 
woefully biased. ``At the appropriate time, in the appropriate way, 
we will say whatever we intend to say,'' Clinton told reporters during 
a meeting with Democratic congressional leaders at the White House. 
``The important thing is that we've got to get back to doing the people's 
business.'' At a news conference in Chicago, Hyde described the letter 
to Clinton as he outlined the schedule for the inquiry against Clinton. 
Hyde on Thursday underscored his goal to wrap up the inquiry by year's 
end, announcing that the committee would likely summon only one witness, 
Starr, on Nov. 19. But the shock waves from Democratic gains in midterm 
elections have injected new doubts and uncertainty into the impeachment 
process, lawmakers said on Thursday. And any alternative to impeachment, 
such as censure, has been complicated by the leadership fight that 
has broken out among House Republicans in recriminations over Tuesday's 
debacle. Hyde said on Thursday that the election would have ``no significant 
impact'' on the impeachment proceedings. But whether voters intended 
to or not, the outcome of the election has been widely viewed by many 
Democrats and Republicans as a referendum on the scope and scale of 
the impeachment process. ``It certainly doesn't make our job any easier,'' 
said Rep. Bob Barr, R-Ga., who is one of Clinton's fiercest critics 
on the committee. ``There'll be no impact on what we do on the Judiciary 
Committee. But other Republicans' view of impeachment will be colored 
in by political considerations.'' In light of public resistance to 
removing Clinton from office, the slim Republican majority in the 
House seems to stand little chance of mustering the 218 votes required 
for impeachment. ``Some people are really depressed,'' said a Republican 
aide. ``It's taken the wind out of our sails.'' Democrats seized on 
their gain of five seats in the House of Representatives and polls 
of voters that showed Americans' strong desire to end the inquiry 
now. Rep. John Conyers Jr. of Michigan, the ranking Democrat on the 
Judiciary Committee, said, ``If the election has made clear one thing 
it is this: The American people do not want President Clinton impeached.'' 
The truncated schedule Hyde described today would abandon plans to 
call such central figures as Bruce Lindsey, the presidential aide, 
and Vernon Jordan, Clinton's longtime friend and confidant, although 
Hyde said more witnesses could be added. Other committee Republicans 
praised Hyde's approach. ``Bringing in witnesses to rehash testimony 
that's already concretely in the record would be a waste of time and 
serve no purpose at all,'' said Rep. George Gekas, R-Pa. Instead, 
only Starr will testify, probably for two days. Starr has expressed 
eagerness to defend his four-year, $40 million inquiry that critics 
say has turned into a personal vendetta against the president. ``He 
is the center of this inquiry,'' Hyde said at his news conference 
in Chicago. ``He's someone everybody wants to hear from, and we're 
going to give him that opportunity.'' Some Democrats want Starr to 
testify, to put him on the defensive. But other Democrats fear Starr 
could make a compelling case against Clinton. Perhaps a greater risk 
for the White House are the 81 questions Hyde posed on Thursday. Some 
simply restate the president's job title: ``Do you admit or deny that 
you are the chief law-enforcement officer of the United States of 
America?'' Other questions ask Clinton to affirm that he met or spoke 
with Jordan or Ms. Lewinsky at a particular time on a particular date. 
Most go to the heart of the accusations Starr has made. For example, 
question No. 27: ``Do you admit or deny that on or about Dec. 28, 
1998, you requested, instructed, suggested to or otherwise discussed 
with Betty Currie that she take possession of gifts previously given 
to Monica Lewinsky by you?'' Hyde denied the questions constituted 
a witch hunt. ``It would be a witch hunt if we served him with a subpoena 
to come in, get under oath and testify to a cross-examination from 
all members,'' Hyde said. ``That would be pushing the envelope. We're 
doing it in the most genteel way.''
