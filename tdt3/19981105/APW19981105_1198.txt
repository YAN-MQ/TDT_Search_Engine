Jan Larsson scored a power-play goal midway through the third period 
to give Sweden a 2-2 tie against the Czech Republic in Thursday's 
opening round of the Karjala Cup ice hockey tournament. Sweden, which 
won the World Championships in Switzerland in May, extended its unbeaten 
streak to 21 games. Host Finland edged Russia 3-2 in the other game 
as defenseman Marko Kiprusoff notched the game-winner at 4:26 in the 
third period. The Czechs took a 2-0 lead in the first period on goals 
by Radek Martinek and Pavel Patera. With 50 seconds left of the period, 
Edvin Frylen cut the score with a power-play goal for the Swedes. 
``It was my first goal on the national team and that's always very 
special,'' said Frylen, a defenseman who has played only four games 
for Sweden and replaced an injured player in this tournament. Larsson, 
who is second in scoring behind American Tom Bissett in the Swedish 
Elite League, tied it at 7:22 in the third. Christer Olsson set up 
both Swedish goals. Two referees worked the game for the first time 
in a major European tournament. The tournament is the second in the 
European Hockey Tour. Sweden won the first tournament in the Czech 
Republic two months ago and leads the overall standings with five 
points, one ahead of Finland. Juha Rihijarvi and Marko Tuomainen scored 
the other goals for Finland. Sergej Petrenko and Andrei Markov scored 
Russia's goals.
