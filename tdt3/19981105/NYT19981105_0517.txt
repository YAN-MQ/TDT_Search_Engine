The AFL-CIO and a large union of department store workers announced 
Thursday that they were rejecting an agreement that a group of apparel 
manufacturers and human rights groups have reached to curtail sweatshops. 
These two labor groups joined the nation's largest apparel union, 
the Union of Needletrades, Industrial and Textile Employees, which 
announced on Wednesday that it would no longer participate in an effort 
intended to reassure consumers that the apparel they buy was not made 
in sweatshops. The agreement reached by Liz Claiborne, L.L. Bean, 
Reebok, Nike and other companies establishes numerous rules for their 
factories, including a minimum age for workers, a maximum 60-hour 
workweek, and a requirement that companies pay the minimum or prevailing 
industry wage in the countries where factories are situated. The agreement 
also calls for independent monitors to inspect the factories. But 
the unions rejected the agreement on numerous grounds, asserting that 
the monitoring would not be frequent enough and that the accord did 
not require apparel companies to pay workers a wage high enough to 
meet a family's basic needs. The unions also criticized the accord 
for giving companies carte blanche to manufacture in countries, like 
China and Indonesia, which repress trade unions. John Sweeney, the 
AFL-CIO's president, issued a statement with Lenore Miller, president 
emeritus of the Retail, Wholesale and Department Store Union, saying 
that ``despite the seriousness of these deliberations'' the labor 
movement ``has concluded that signing on to an agreement with the 
participating companies is not possible at this time.'' After two 
years of debate, the agreement was reached by members of the White 
House Apparel Industry Partnership, a group of 18 apparel companies, 
labor unions and human rights groups. Roberta Karp, general counsel 
at Liz Claiborne and co-chairwoman of the presidential task force, 
said the effort would move forward despite the unions' rejection. 
She said the task force would seek to enlist other companies and that 
members would observe the workplace standards and monitoring rules 
required by the agreement. ``This effort will still be successful,'' 
she said. ``The unions were part of the deliberations. Their imprimatur 
is on the code and the monitoring principles. It really is an enormous 
step forward. While it doesn't satisfy on all scores an entire union 
agenda, it does satisfy what we set out to do, which is to improve 
working conditions around the world.'' The apparel workers union has 
taken a tougher stance toward the agreement than has the department 
store union, which suggested it might someday sign on if it is pleased 
with how the pact is carried out. ``Labor's job is to push the envelope 
a little further,'' said Ms. Miller of the department store workers. 
``Of all such agreements I've seen this is the best of them. In my 
view, the door is not closed to labor's participation.'' While the 
National Consumers League and the Lawyers Committee for Human Rights 
helped negotiate the agreement, another task force member, the Interfaith 
Center on Corporate Responsibility, rejected the agreement Thursday 
because it does not contain a requirement to pay a living wage. But 
Michael Posner, executive director of the lawyers committee, said 
the agreement was an important first step to hold companies accountable.
