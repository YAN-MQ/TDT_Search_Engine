"On the money" tonight -- going even deeper into debt if you don't 
pay your credit card bills on time. There are almost no restrictions 
on how much banks can charge when you make a late payment on your 
card. The latest installment from ABC's Linda Stark in Washington. 
This is a story of a dramatic increase in penalties for the millions 
of Americans who do not make credit card payments on time. One consumer 
group surveyed 74 banks that issue 117 credit cards. It found -- make 
one late payment and your interest rate can jump substantially and 
stay there for months. The higher rates range from 16% to nearly 25%. 
For more than half of the banks, late fees rose more than 70% in three 
years, from an average of $13 in 1995 to nearly $22 today. If you 
exceed your credit limit, they'll charge you a fee of $20 or more. 
Three years, only one bank charged that much. What's more, according 
to consumer groups, banks are making it easier for consumers to get 
in trouble, by shortening the time in which a payment is due. A spokesman 
for the banking industry defended their fees. There's got to be penalties 
for people that are going to abuse the system. And the good credit-worthy 
risk shouldn't be paying for those who are not managing their credit 
well. One thing both the consumer and banking groups agree on, customers 
must be more savvy. If your credit card terms aren't good for you, 
shop around for a better deal. Lisa Stark, ABC News, Washington.
