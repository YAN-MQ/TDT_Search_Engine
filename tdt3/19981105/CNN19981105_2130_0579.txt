Researchers have found a way to grow human stem cells in a laboratory. 
Stem cells are the beginning for all parts of the human body as it 
develops from an embryo. Scientists were able to independently culture 
the cells. The hope is this discovery will be a key in one day creating 
heart, kidney and other tissues to replace diseased parts of the body. 
It could be a decade before any patient benefits directly from the 
research.
