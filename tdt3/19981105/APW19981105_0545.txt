Nepal's king experienced heart trouble overnight and was described 
as improving on Thursday, according to a palace statement. The statement 
said King Birendra, 52, experienced ``cardiac ischemia,'' or a block 
in the flow of blood, Wednesday night. Doctors advised him to rest 
and the palace said he was feeling better Thursday. The Harvard-educated 
King Birendra ascended to the throne in 1972 after the death of his 
father King Mahendra. He was an absolute monarch until 1990, when 
a pro-democracy movement forced constitutional reforms that made a 
figurehead of the throne. Nepal has been politically unstable since 
then, with parties and factions _ including a royalist group _ undermining 
each other in a constant power struggle. The country has had five 
prime ministers in the last four years. King Birendra has great influence 
over Hindu priests in this Hindu kingdom. The king's oldest child, 
Crown Prince Dipendra, is 26 years old.
