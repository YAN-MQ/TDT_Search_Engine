Democrats are hailing their surprisingly good showing in Tuesday's 
U.S. elections. As Republicans stress the fact they managed to keep 
control of Congress. President Clinton said voters sent a loud and 
clear message they want Congress to focus on important issues facing 
the country. And end partisan politics. It is a vindication of the 
policies and of the general policy of putting partisanship behind 
progress. And of putting people before politics. And of trying to 
find ways of putting people together instead of divide them. Mr. Clinton 
denied comment on how the results might affect the House impeachment 
inquiry on him.
