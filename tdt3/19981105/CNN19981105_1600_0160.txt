Tropical storm warnings for the Florida keys and the state's eastern 
coast should be dropped this afternoon. Tropical storm Mitch battered 
the keys with high winds and tornadoes. Roofs were ripped off buildings, 
mobile homes flipped over, and trees and power lines snapped. One 
death is attributed to the storm. In Miami, wind gusts reached 70 
miles per hour, and flooding slowed the morning commute. At last report, 
Mitch had maximum sustained winds of 65 miles per hour. The storm 
is located 100 miles north of grand bahama island and moving quickly 
to the east-northeast. Hurricane Hunter aircraft say Mitch is weakening 
and could lose tropical storm status.
