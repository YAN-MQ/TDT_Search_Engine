Qatar and the United Arab Emirates ended with a 0-0 tie Thursday in 
the six-nation Gulf Cup. Qatar, which had better control at the ball, 
came close to scoring several times in and outside the penalty area. 
Mustafa Mubarak and Mohammed al-Enezi played aggressively for Qatar, 
and Mubarak almost scored in the final minutes of a game marred by 
injuries and referee whistles. However, Thursday's match gave Qatar 
its first point in the tournament after losing to Kuwait and Oman 
in earlier games. Despite a draw, the United Arab Emirates, which 
has won two games earlier, could do with an additional point to stay 
ahead in the standings with 7 points. Saudi Arabia plays Oman later 
Thursday. Competition began Oct. 30 and ends Nov. 12. Also participating 
in the tournament, held every two years, is Bahrain.
