Israeli prime minister Benjamin Netanyahu says he's confident his 
cabinet will ratify the mideast peace accord brokered in Maryland. 
He presented the deal to his ministers today. Israel has agreed to 
hand over 13% more of the West Bank to the palestinians over the next 
12 weeks. Netanyahu says Jewish settlers in the West Bank, who oppose 
the deal, will have a voice in deciding what territory is turned over. 
The Israeli cabinet will vote on the accord by Sunday.
