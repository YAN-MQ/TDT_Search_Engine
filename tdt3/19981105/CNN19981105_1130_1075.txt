Ticketmaster is suing the Internet music retailer n2k, claiming it 
defaulted on payments and broke an agreement to become ticketmaster's 
exclusive on-line music dealer. Under their deal reached earlier this 
year, n2k agreed to pay ticketmaster $12 million over two years. Ticketmaster 
says the first installment was due this past week.
