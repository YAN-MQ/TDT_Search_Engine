The Food & Drug Administration has approved a painkiller for cancer 
patients that looks like a lollipop but is as powerful as a morphine 
injection. NPR's John Hamilton has more. The drug is a form of a narcotic 
called Fentonil that can be absorbed quickly through the tissues in 
the mouth. It will be offered as a flavored lollipop-like candy. Studies 
indicate the drug in the candy can relieve severe cancer pain as effectively 
as morphine injected directly into the bloodstream. Because Fentonil 
candy doesn't require an injection, it will be far easier than other 
powerful narcotics to use at home. But the product has been criticized 
by some consumer advocates who think its appearance and flavor could 
make it appealing to children. The company says a child who consumed 
an entire Fentonil lollipop could die as a result. Even so, scientists 
who advise the FDA recommended approval for the Fentonil candy last 
year. The FDA's final approval sharply limits its use. It will be 
available only to cancer patients with severe pain that can no longer 
be controlled by other narcotics. John Hamilton, NPR News.
