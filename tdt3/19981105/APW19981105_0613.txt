The first 46 verifiers of a European-led mission of unarmed observers 
in Kosovo will arrive next week, a spokesman for the Organization 
for Security and Cooperation in Europe said Thursday. Mons Nyberg, 
the OSCE spokesman in Pristina, said 22 British verifiers will arrive 
Monday and another 24 on Thursday. The 46 will go to the southern 
city of Prizren to set up operations there, Nyberg said. The Kosovo 
Verification Mission, part of an Oct. 12 peace agreement for Kosovo, 
isn't expected to be officially launched before the second half of 
November. It will report on whether Yugoslavia President Slobodan 
Milosevic fully complies with the provisions of the accord. It will 
eventually absorb another observer mission _ the Kosovo Diplomatic 
Observer Mission _ which began operating in July. Nyberg said the 
British verifiers arriving next week will initially be called KDOM 
observers because the Kosovo Verification Mission is still being set 
up.
