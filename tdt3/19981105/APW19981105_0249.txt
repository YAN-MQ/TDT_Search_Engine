MUSCAT, Oman (AP) _ U.S. Defense Secretary William Cohen arrived in 
Oman Thursday to press for support for possible military strikes against 
Iraq, but so far there appeared to be little backing in the region 
for the use of force. Cohen arrived in Oman from Qatar where he met 
with the emir, Sheik Hamad bin Khalifa al-Thani, and Foreign Minister 
Hamad bin Jassim al-Thani. No details of the meeting were available. 
Cohen was to meet with Sultan Qaboos and other senior Omani officials 
before flying to the United Arab Emirates and Egypt. At least publicly, 
there appears to be little support for any U.S. military action against 
Iraq. ``Can the United States imagine that there is a country, whether 
Arab or not, except its subservient Britain, which can say `yes' to 
striking Iraq?'' Egypt's Al-Akhbar, a state-owned newspaper, asked 
in a front page editorial. Reflecting the feeling in the Arab world 
that Washington is tough on Iraq and soft on Israel, the Egyptian 
newspaper wrote that ``the giant United States has become a lion before 
Iraq but an ostrich and a helpless rat before Israel.'' The United 
States and Britain have not ruled out military strikes on Iraq to 
try and force Baghdad to rescind its Saturday decision to end cooperation 
with U.N. weapons inspectors. The U.N. Security Council has condemned 
the Iraqi decision. The United States has about 24,000 troops, an 
aircraft carrier and some 170 warplanes and helicopters in the Gulf 
region, according to the Pentagon. It is not clear, however, whether 
the United States' Gulf allies would allow the use of bases on their 
territory for launching strikes against Iraq. On Tuesday, a Saudi 
official said King Fahd told the defense secretary that the kingdom 
would not be ``a springboard for attacks on Iraq.'' The official spoke 
on condition of anonymity. But the Pentagon said Cohen was assured 
of Saudi backing in the event of military action against Iraq. During 
the standoff between Iraq and the United Nations over weapons inspectors 
in February, Kuwait was the only Arab state that opened its air bases 
to U.S. and British warplanes. On his current trip, Cohen earlier 
visited Bahrain and Kuwait.
