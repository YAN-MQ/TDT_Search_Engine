If you'd like to order cassette copies of today's edition of THE WORLD 
or of previous programs, you can call 1-303-823-8000. Again, for cassette 
copies of THE WORLD, call 1-303-823-8000. This is PRI, Public Radio 
International. "Philadelphia Weekly" joins you in support of 91 FM. 
"Philadelphia Weekly" is the city's largest circulation weekly newspaper 
available at nearly 3,000 locations in the Delaware valley offering 
complete coverage of the arts and political and social issues affecting 
Philadelphia. For more information, 215-563-7400. I'm Lisa Mullins. 
Still ahead, an American blues man finds a piece of heaven. I came 
to Sweden, not only found friendly people but wonderful musicians, 
local musicians, and musicians from all over the world. It was pretty 
much Utopian for a young, you know, African-American who wanted to 
figure out who he was in this whole thing. First, this news.
