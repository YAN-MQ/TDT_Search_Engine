In the office of Daniel Jordan, president of the Thomas Jefferson 
Memorial Foundation at mountaintop Monticello here, a stark black 
and white drawing of Jefferson stares from the wall. The nose is thin, 
aristocratic, the eyes dark, enigmatic, the mouth sealed in a thin 
line, offering nothing. ``We have 200 people trying to keep up with 
one man _ one dead man,'' said Jordan, a tall, white-haired, distinguished-looking 
Southerner from Philadelphia, Miss. ``And we will never catch him.'' 
Here at the research foundation that oversees Jefferson's home and 
conducts tours _ really walking historical lectures _ of both the 
house and the life of the United States' third president, compelling 
DNA evidence that he fathered at least one child with a slave, Sally 
Hemings, has given tour guides one new piece of information to pass 
along, and has stirred up countless new questions. Some of those questions, 
tied to the nature of that relationship, are disturbing: Was it a 
loving or even willing relationship? Or one of ugliness, of a master 
and his slave? And why did Jefferson never seem to acknowledge the 
child, a son, in any familial way, or even with any particular fondness? 
``My immediate reaction was to be reminded of just how vicious, abominable 
and complex the institution of slavery was,'' said Jordan of the DNA 
evidence. If the evidence is correct, ``it shows us the exploitive 
side of slavery,'' Jordan said. That much, he added, is not in question. 
But questions there are. One possibility is that the two were bound 
in ``a tragic love story,'' he said. ``The other is one of brutal 
exploitation.'' ``We know more than anybody,'' he said, ``and we don't 
know anything about the nature of that relationship.'' Either way, 
he said, it humanizes Jefferson, and allows historians to paint a 
richer picture of him. Both Jordan and the tour guides have, for years, 
included the possibility of such a relationship in their discussions, 
though the offspring identified in the DNA testing was not the Hemings 
son they had so long guessed it might be. The disclosure did not send 
historians here scrambling to rewrite history _ the staff here will 
now go to work trying to verify, academically, the scientific evidence, 
Jordan said _ and will not drastically alter how guides at Monticello 
do their job. ``It's something we've always discussed,'' said Jean 
Myer, who has been giving tours of Monticello for six years. That 
Jefferson, who owned slaves even as he wrote the Declaration of Independence 
and said all men are created equal, might have engaged in a sexual 
relationship with Hemings and fathered a son is part of his history, 
she said. ``He used to say, `Nature intended me for the tranquil pursuit 
of science, by rendering it my supreme delight,''' Ms. Myer added. 
``Now, here we are with a scientific development that gives us an 
insight into his life. Certainly, we will acknowledge that.'' Deborah 
Harriman, who takes visitors on tours of the home and plantation, 
including the slave quarters known as Mulberry Row, said her lectures 
on Jefferson the family man might be altered by the DNA findings. 
``Jefferson was always such a family man,'' she said. ``Now we find 
he may have had another child, on Mulberry Row. How did he look on 
that child?'' There is no evidence, at least in his writings and through 
other research, that he ever acknowledged having the child. The DNA 
evidence, Ms. Harriman said, will not alter the public image of the 
man but may change the way people look at his role as a father. If 
the DNA evidence is correct, ``he had a double standard,'' said Robert 
Gillespie, a lawyer in Richmond and a Jefferson descendant. Jefferson 
gave Martha and Maria, his two daughters by his wife, Martha, ``love 
and attention,'' said Gillespie, who heads the Monticello Association, 
made up of Jefferson's descendants. If he treated the Hemings child 
with any familial love, there seems to be no evidence of it in accounts 
by his slaves, collected after his death, of life at Monticello. One 
of the reservations Jefferson had for ending slavery was that emancipation 
would lead to a mixing of the races. Now, all of this will have to 
be cast in a different light by the tour guides, who will form their 
own interpretations. The tours, which take some 550,000 people a year 
through the house, are not scripted, Jordan said, although the guides 
are expected to keep them historically accurate. ``People think we 
are hiding something,'' he said. ``We're not. We say all we know. 
Within 24 hours of learning about the DNA evidence, our guides were 
talking about it. You follow the truth where it leads.'' The report 
that brought about this information, from blood samples collected 
by Eugene Foster of Charlottesville, a retired professor of pathology 
at Tufts University, indicates strongly that Eston Hemings, Sally 
Hemings' youngest son, had unusual Y chromosome mutations, the same 
as in the Jefferson lineage. Historians have long debated whether 
Jefferson or some of his relatives fathered a child with Hemings because 
of a striking resemblance to the Jeffersons in an older son, Thomas 
Hemings. The DNA evidence seems to confirm a sexual relationship with 
Hemings, but it points to Thomas' younger brother Eston. Tourists 
at Monticello, who tend to be people already interested in history, 
said the DNA evidence did not surprise them, that they had heard of 
a relationship between Jefferson and Hemings and would have been more 
surprised if there had not been a child. No one said they thought 
less of Jefferson the hero. ``It doesn't change my opinion of him 
at all,'' said Richard Green, a tourist from Silver Spring, Md., who 
works for Adventist World Radio of the Seventh-day Adventist Church 
there. ``It just shows me that he's human like the rest of us.'' The 
DNA evidence could lead to physical changes at Monticello. Only those 
of the Jefferson lineage have been allowed to be buried in the family 
cemetery, which is controlled not by the foundation but by his descendants, 
through the Monticello Association. Gillespie, who heads the Monticello 
Association, said the voting members _ from 700 to 800 _ may now vote 
to ``extend burial rights to the others.'' He said he believed that 
the high ideals that his ancestor put down on paper would live on, 
as would Jefferson's legacy as a national hero. Jordan said he believed 
that in the long run, this new information would only help make Jefferson 
more real, more a living person instead of the enigmatic icon. He 
does not hope to ever understand him, Jordan said. ``But,'' he said, 
``I have always found him good company.''
