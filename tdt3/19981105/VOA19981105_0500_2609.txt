A fire broke out at one of Italy's most popular tourist attractions. 
And officials say they are still trying to determine the extent of 
the damage. Firefighters quickly put out the blaze late Wednesday 
in the 18th Century palace of King Charles III just outside Naples. 
There is no word yet on the cause of this blaze. Charles III commissioned 
Reggiardo Caserta the palace in 1751 as the Italian answer to French 
King Louis XIV's palace at Versailles.
