U.S. officials are continuing their consultations with allies about 
Iraqi leader Saddam Hussein's defiance of U.N. weapons inspections. 
A Security Council resolution against the Iraqi action is being considered, 
but correspondent Gil Butler reports - the State Department says no 
further opposition is needed before military force can be used against 
Iraq. Defense Secretary William Cohen and under Secretary of State 
Thomas Pickering, held talks in the Gulf region about the Iraqi defiance. 
State Department spokesman James Rubin said the United States is confident 
it will have the backing it needs to take what he called: "appropriate 
action to support the United Nations." The Security Council is considering 
a new resolution on the Iraqi defiance of inspections by UNSCOM, the 
United Nations Weapons Inspectors. Mr. Rubin said the "United States 
is looking for another clear statement that Iraq is in violation of 
U.N. resolutions. But he says: "A new authorization for the use of 
military force is not needed." Mr. Rubin declined to give a time frame 
for Iraqi compliance before military action may be taken. But he repeated 
Secretary of State Madeleine Albright's description of the situation 
as grave. Gil Butler, VOA News, the State Department.
