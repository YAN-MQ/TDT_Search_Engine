The old Robert McCrum was an adventurous and peril-prone fellow whom 
I'd have enjoyed sharing a few beers with; the new Robert McCrum is 
a thoughtful man I would seek out as a friend. Born the son of a Cambridge 
don into a family ``as fortunate and privileged as you could wish 
for,'' McCrum at the age of 42 in 1995 was editor in chief of the 
British publishing company of Faber &AMP; Faber, a firm he had joined 
16 years earlier and whose ranks he had ascended through a combination 
of talent and what seems certainly to have been sheer enthusiasm for 
the work. Perhaps in reaction to the accustomed certainty and evenness 
of his life, he had developed what he calls an ``addiction to physical 
risk,'' traveling to battle zones in far-off places in search of derring-do 
and danger. He seems never to have been able to free himself of a 
certain restlessness of soul. In fact, he had become restless even 
at the job he so much enjoyed. He had been divorced for many years, 
and his personal life was equally unsettled. Something within him 
had begun insistently to urge a change. Perhaps the beginning of that 
change had presented itself in October 1993 at the Frankfurt Book 
Fair, when cCrum was introduced to Sarah Lyall, then a reporter for 
The New York Times covering book publishing and now one of its London 
correspondents. Their attraction to each other was immediate, and 
their subsequent love affair was rendered no less intense by the necessity 
that so much of its first months be conducted trans-Atlantically by 
phone and jet flight. They were married on May 13, 1995. While Ms. 
Lyall was on assignment in San Francisco only six weeks later, McCrum, 
alone in their house in London late one night, suffered a stroke. 
Its cause in such a youngish man remains even now undetermined, but 
there is no uncertainty about its effects. His entire left side, including 
his face, was immediately paralyzed, and he lost the ability to physically 
articulate speech, although his mental functioning was fortunately 
unaffected. ``My Year Off'' is a meticulous and highly literate account, 
written by a gifted storyteller, of that harrowing night and its aftermath. 
It is a book difficult to lay aside until its final sentence has been 
reached. The author's intent is to lead his reader through every step 
of the stroke's acute phase and the long recovery process, and in 
this he succeeds admirably. He takes us with him from his agonizing 
attempts to drag his naked, unwieldy body headfirst down two flights 
of stairs toward the living room phone until his ultimate return to 
a new career as literary editor of The Observer, almost exactly a 
year later. All through the early stages of his treatment and the 
drawn-out months when he found himself slowly resuming his ability 
to carry out ordinary tasks of ordinary living, McCrum kept a diary 
and so did Ms. Lyall. Many of the diary entries appear in this book. 
We meet the doctors, nurses, therapists, friends and fellow stroke 
veterans who contributed so much to his eventual rehabilitation. And 
we smell the smells and taste the tastes of life in several health 
care centers. Here is McCrum at his best as a chronicler. But here 
also is my one serious quarrel with the way he has chosen to tell 
his story. McCrum is too much the journalist, too much the reporter 
_ somehow needing to be just sufficiently detached from the turmoil 
in his guts that it remains hidden from his readers. His is a book 
more of observations than of feelings. When again and again he tells 
of being ``depressed'' and even hints at ``shame'' and ``despair,'' 
he lets them only be words. He writes of ``a mood of existential crisis, 
a mood that can still easily recur, lending the world a strange, provisional 
air, even now,'' but he tells us no more than that. Early in his book 
he states that ``communicating experience is what I do,'' and indeed, 
he does it very well. But he keeps his deepest emotion to himself, 
except to let us sense that it is there for him to know but not really 
for us to understand. Perhaps he can do no more: ``When I reread my 
journal now,'' he writes, ``I am surprised how detached I seem to 
be about my experience, but that, I suppose, lies in my nature.'' 
He was, after all, brought up in ``a world in which the frank acknowledgment 
and discussion of emotion was seen as needlessly self-indulgent.'' 
Ms. Lyall, on the other hand, lets us into her mind. The brief passages 
from her diary light up this book with a humanity that clarifies the 
perceptions and even the transformation that both of them underwent 
as a result of her husband's illness. Her thoughts are the key that 
opens up the rich chamber of their inner lives. It is because of her 
willingness to give us an image of him that he never fully discloses 
that I see him as someone who has passed through a firestorm to become 
the man I would seek out as a friend. It is given to the new Robert 
McCrum that he comes to view the world and himself _ and his deepening 
love for his wife _ in ways that would have been incomprehensible 
to him had he not been plunged into the crucible of his sickness. 
His life, his values and his attitudes are forever changed by what 
he has endured and overcome. Long before awakening to find himself 
paralyzed, he had begun his attempts to embark on a journey toward 
finding some answer to the perennial questions we all ask ourselves 
continually, or should. He states it succinctly as ``Who am I?'' The 
stroke became the vehicle by which he could set out and find so much 
of that answer, with his wife helping him to navigate his way. He 
has used his illness well. Toward the end of ``My Year Off,'' the 
author sums up his near-tragedy and its aftermath with the thought 
that he feels ``purged and renewed by the waters of ill health; perhaps 
_ who knows? _ my stroke had been a blessing in disguise.'' At several 
earlier points in the book, he has written of finding meaning in John 
Donne's 1624 meditation, ``Devotions Upon Emergent Occasions,'' and 
quoted the passages that clarified his comprehension of what he was 
going through. It seems to me that McCrum's experience exemplifies 
yet another sentence in that small masterpiece: ``No man hath affliction 
enough that is not matured, and ripened by it.'' PUBLICATION NOTES:
