rates. The Dow finished up a healthy 132 points. It had been down 
67 points earlier. The broader markets all posted solid gains. The 
NASDAQ composite finished up99 upcisco systems giving the NASDAQ a 
Boost. Its shares gaining 2 1/4 points to 67 3/4 after reporting a 
54% rise. A disi pointing auction of 30 year bonds helping send the 
bond down lower today 10/32 of a point in price.
