Japanese aviation authorities plan a quick inspection Friday at the 
maintenance division of All Nippon Airways after one of its planes 
flew from Honolulu to Nagoya despite a malfunctioning instrument, 
an official said. The Boeing 747, carrying 357 people, made the flight 
to the central Japanese city on Aug. 11 without incident, Takeshi 
Endo, a Transport Ministry official, said Thursday. But he said that 
under ANA's maintenance rules, the two vertical speed indicators installed 
in the plane's cockpit both must be functioning. Only one was functioning 
properly, he added. Endo said that in a pre-flight inspection in Hawaii, 
a worker for United Airlines, which does ANA's maintenance work there, 
found the malfunction and reported it to ANA's office in Tokyo. But 
ANA gave the go-ahead for the flight's departure anyway, he said. 
ANA did not notify the Transport Ministry until a Japanese newspaper 
recently reported the case, Endo said. ANA then reported that an in-house 
inspection had found no other unreported cases, he added. Naoto Takada, 
a spokesman for ANA, said the company has reconfirmed that all workers 
must thoroughly abide by all maintenance rules. ANA, Japan's second-largest 
airline, has 131 passenger jets, including 39 Boeing 747's, flying 
its domestic and international routes, Takada said.
