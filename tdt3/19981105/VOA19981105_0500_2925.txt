Wish I had better news for you coming out of London and the European 
markets this morning. Still trending lower at this hour. In London, 
the FUTSY is off 92 points. The CAK 40 in Paris, down 47. The VAX 
30 in Frankfurt off 53. And in Zurich, the Swiss Index is down 77. 
The London morning gold fixing of 290 cents an ounce is unchanged 
from the late quote Wednesday, in New York. Analysts say this is a 
bit of profit-taking after yesterday's pretty big runoffs.
