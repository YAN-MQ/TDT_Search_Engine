Iran has issued a license for the country's first private news agency, 
the organization's director said Thursday. The Fars News Agency was 
issued a permit by the Ministry of Culture and Islamic Guidance and 
will start operating within the next two weeks, the agency's managing 
director, Saeed Nowbari, told The Associated Press. Iran currently 
has only one news agency, the official Islamic Republic News Agency, 
which is considered allied with President Mohammad Khatami and supports 
his reforms. The political leaning of the new news agency, however, 
was unclear. ``We will act independently and we are determined to 
be reliable, accurate and fast in our reporting,'' Nowbari said. The 
Farsi-language agency was founded by six investors and will have 20 
staffers, said Nowbari, an official with the Tehran judiciary and 
a former IRNA employee. The judiciary is considered a stronghold of 
hard-liners. ``Over the next two weeks, we will have our first news 
item. We do not in any way rely on any public department,'' he said. 
The agency will later expand operations by equipping offices in provincial 
centers, appearing on the Internet and ultimately setting up offices 
outside the country, he said. Khatami has been pushing for greater 
press and cultural freedoms since his election last year. Hard-liners 
have opposed his moves.
