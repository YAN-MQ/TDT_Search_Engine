An Israeli woman who posted fliers portraying the Prophet Mohammed 
as a pig won a reduction in her sentence for good behavior and was 
released Thursday. Tatiana Suszkin was sentenced to 24 months in prison 
after posting drawings showing the Muslim prophet as a pig on the 
doors of Arab-owned shops in the West Bank town of Hebron last year. 
Muslims, as well as Jews, consider pigs to be unclean. Suszkin's parole 
board on Wednesday reduced her sentence by a third for good behavior, 
said her lawyer, Sean Casper. She was originally scheduled for release 
Monday but Thursday she left a women's prison facility outside of 
Tel Aviv, accompanied by her mother and her lawyer. ``She's in good 
spirits,'' Casper said. Israel radio reported that the Shin Bet security 
service opposed the reduction in Suszkin's release and was discussing 
the issue with the state attorney. Under the terms of her release, 
Suszkin must contact the police twice a day, according to Orit Messer-Harel, 
spokeswoman for the Prisons Authority. Suszkin would also be prohibited 
from leaving the Tel Aviv area and would have to observe an 8 p.m. 
curfew, Messer-Harel said. The posters set off clashes in Hebron, 
a town of 450 Jewish settlers and 130,000 Palestinians. They also 
triggered outrage throughout the Muslim world, including angry street 
protests in Bangladesh and Iran, and rulings by Muslim clerics that 
insulting the prophet should be punishable by death. Israeli leaders 
condemned her actions. Suszkin, a art school dropout and a supporter 
of the outlawed anti-Arab Kach group, was convicted of committing 
a racist act, supporting a terrorist organization, attempting to create 
religious offense and attempted vandalism. She was also convicted 
of endangering life by throwing rocks at Arab drivers.
