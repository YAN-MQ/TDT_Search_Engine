After several delays, Israel's cabinet is debating the new interim 
peace deal with the Palestinians. Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu 
presented the deal to the cabinet after saying he was satisfied with 
clarifications about the Palestinian plan for security. Mr. Netanyahu 
faces stiff resistance to the agreement in the cabinet. But he is 
expected to get majority approval after two or three days of debate.
