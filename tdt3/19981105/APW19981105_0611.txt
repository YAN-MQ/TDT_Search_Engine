The Royal Dutch-Shell Group of Cos. said Thursday that quarterly profits 
fell by 56 percent as it suffered the effects of depressed oil prices 
and the recession in the Asia-Pacific region. The Anglo-Dutch oil 
giant reported net income of dlrs 841 million, or 25 cents a share, 
for the three months ending Sept. 30, compared with dlrs 1.9 billion, 
or 60 cents per share, in the same period a year earlier. Oil industry 
analysts said that although they were expecting profits to be substantially 
down, the earnings were worse than observers had predicted. Alan Marshall, 
an oil analyst for Robert Flemming Securities, said that even though 
the oil market is weak, the results are ``unexpectedly poor'' when 
compared those reported by competitors this quarter. ``Exxon, which 
is the closest comparable, was 23 percent down. This is more than 
twice as bad,'' he said. ``They've got a bit of explaining to do.'' 
He said he was expecting third quarter profits in the region of dlrs 
1.2 billion, on the lower end of the range analysts were predicting 
before the results were released. Shell Chairman Mark Moody-Stuart 
acknowledged that the results were ``disappointing.'' ``I am sure 
we are going in the right direction,'' he said. ``But the environment 
we are working in, underlined by these results, clearly shows that 
we have to move futher and faster than we have been doing.'' He said 
the company was particularly disappointed in its earnings in chemicals, 
and in gas and on-shore oil exploration and production in the United 
States. Quarterly revenues, graf 7 pvs
