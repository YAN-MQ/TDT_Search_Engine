A few years ago, many people thought rap and hip-hop music were just 
passing fads. But today, they dominate the pop charts. Mark Scheerer 
reports. I'm standing on the corner boppin' they're driven some of 
the hottest cars New York has ever seen The rapper Jay-Z is in the 
house -- a virgin records megastore, in this case -- signing copies 
of his number one CD "volume 2: hard knock life." He's joined at the 
top of the charts by R&B/rap hybrid lauryn hill and southern rappers, 
outkast. Meanwhile, highly anticipated rock albums by hole and the 
smashing pumpkins have underperformed and nail biting's begun for 
new CDs from R.E.M. and alanis morissette. Rap vs. rock? It's seemingly 
no contest. I look at the charts and see, you know, eight hip-hop 
tracks, two soundtracks and Celine Dion. And I go, "well, how could 
we possible fit into this." It's so relevant to what's going on in 
people's lives. And kids like it a lot, and it's rebellious and it's 
got something to say. Mainstream, rock-oriented magazines are adapting 
to the shifting paradigm. I think all this popularity comes more from 
the music than anybody wants to admit. Everybody wants to say, "well, 
it's marketing, you know, it's racial envy, it's, you know, clothing. 
It's all this stuff." But I think hip-hop music speaks very directly 
to kids. Girls, you know you better watch out Chris schwartz of ruffhouse 
records has helped make superstars out of lauryn hill and her fellow 
Fugees. I think now your core hip-hop audience is about 1.5 million 
kids, who are active consumers, who are both black and white. In a 
very profound way, hip-hop has become American youth culture. So the 
question is why? Hip-hop records are no longer these long, extended 
sort of free-form things. They have very strong hooks, very strong 
choruses. The videos also, obviously, have gotten more and more sophisticated. 
And the hip-hop here to stay argument has youth on its side. It's 
still youth culture. It's still rebellious. And it's still got a bunch 
of adults saying it's not their music, reminding kids that it is their 
music. Mark Scheerer, "CNN Entertainment News," New York.
