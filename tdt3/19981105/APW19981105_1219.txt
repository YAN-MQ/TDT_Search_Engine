Researchers have isolated and grown human embryonic master cells in 
a laboratory, a key step toward possibly someday creating heart, kidney 
and other tissue to replace diseased parts of the body. Reaching a 
goal sought by hundreds of scientists for years, researchers at the 
University of Wisconsin, Madison, and at Johns Hopkins University 
in Baltimore independently cultured human stem cells, the foundation 
source of cells that during gestation form all of the body's parts. 
The scientists also demonstrated that the cell lines would transform 
into specific cell types, with specific functions, such as muscle, 
bone or nerves. ``It opens the possibility for some dramatic new transplantation 
therapies,'' said Dr. James A. Thomson of the University of Wisconsin, 
author of a study to be published in the journal Science. The research 
demonstrates for the first time that it's possible to culture human 
cells that have the ability to develop into a wide variety of human 
tissues, said John Gearhart of Johns Hopkins, author of a study to 
be published in the Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences. 
``For the first time we can start considering this as a source of 
cell or tissue types for transplant,'' Gearhart said. Although researchers 
long ago isolated stem cells from mice and other laboratory animals, 
work on human stem cells has been slowed by controversy. Some anti-abortion 
groups oppose human embryo research because they consider such an 
embryo to be a human life. Although it may be a decade or more before 
any patient benefits from the work, Gearhart and Thomson said that 
stem cells potentially could be used for such things as: _Growing 
nerve cells to repair spinal injuries and restore function to paralyzed 
limbs. _Growing heart muscle cells to replace useless scar tissue 
after a heart attack. _Making brain cells that would secrete dopamine 
for the treatment and control of Parkinson's disease. _Growing bone 
marrow to replace blood-forming organs damaged by disease or radiation. 
Bone marrow replacement has become an increasingly common therapy 
for some types of cancers. _Making the islet cells that produce insulin 
and, thus, creating a lifelong treatment for diabetes. This, in effect, 
``could be a cure,'' said Thomson. _Making blood cells genetically 
altered to resist specific diseases, such as HIV, to replace diseased 
blood cells. Growing entire whole organs is ``another ball game,'' 
and science is far from ready to attempt that, said Gearhart. Thomas 
Okarma, research vice president of Geron Corp., a drug research company, 
said his company hopes to use stem cells to regenerate failing tissues. 
``Because these cells do not age, they could be used to generate virtually 
limitless supply of cells and tissue for transplantation,'' Okarma 
said. In his studies, Thomson isolated the stem cells from human embryos 
created in a fertility clinic. He said the embryos were ``in excess'' 
of what was needed and the clinic patients approved of the research. 
The stem cells were grown in a culture in a way that kept them alive 
perpetually, but unchanged. When the culture was altered slightly, 
the cells transformed into basic body cell types, and then into clusters 
of muscle, cartilage, bone, nerve and intestinal cells. Gearhart's 
group did similar work, but their starting cell mass came from non-living 
fetal tissue that had been aborted. From this, they extracted primordial 
germ cells that then were cultured into stem cells. These, in turn, 
transformed into other body cell types.
