Germany's chronically high unemployment dropped slightly Thursday, 
even as its central bank rebuffed demands by Finance Minister Oskar 
Lafontaine to cut interest rates, a move he says will help tackle 
10.1 percent joblessness. Lafontaine met Thursday morning with the 
policy-making central council of the central bank, the Deutsche Bundesbank, 
in a meeting billed as a ``courtesy call.'' The meeting saw ``an intense 
exchange of views'' about fiscal and monetary policy, the ministry 
said in a statement, hinting talks were heated. Discussion focused 
particularly on interest rates in Europe, which were showing a ``falling 
tendency,'' the statement said. Lafontaine has repeatedly demanded 
the Bundesbank factor in goals such as cutting unemployment and boosting 
growth in deciding monetary policy. Many central bankers regard that 
as heresy, saying their task is to keep prices steady and inflation 
low. The rest is up to the government's economic and social policies, 
they say. The meeting follows weeks of sniping and speculation whether 
Germany's new center-left government was trying to exert political 
pressure on the bank. The government has repeatedly denied that. Rebuffing 
the finance minister's demands, the bank said after the regular biweekly 
meeting that its core 3.3 percent securities repurchase rate would 
stay the same. The meeting normally decides interest rates. The much-anticipated 
meeting almost overshadowed an announcement by the Federal Labor Office 
in the eastern city of Nuremberg that unemployment dropped again in 
October to 10.1 percent, down from September's 10.3 percent. Nearly 
74,000 Germans found jobs last month, leaving 3.89 million unemployed, 
the office said. Unemployment in former East Germany remained almost 
twice that in the west: 15.7 percent in October compared to 8.7 percent 
in the west. Still, conditions in the east improved slightly more 
than in the west, with 43,900 people finding jobs there, compared 
to 29,800 in the west. It's news that should cheer the new government 
of Chancellor Gerhard Schroeder, which has made fighting joblessness 
its key priority. Schroeder has backed his finance minister's demands 
for lower rates, though recently has appeared to distance himself, 
saying he believes the discussion should be conducted in private. 
Several central bankers, including its president, Hans Tietmeyer, 
say dropping rates isn't necessary just now, because Germany's core 
interest rate is already the lowest in the G-7 group of industrial 
nations, bar Japan. Many analysts say Lafontaine has hurt his cause 
by appearing to pressure the bank, which is fiercely independent.
