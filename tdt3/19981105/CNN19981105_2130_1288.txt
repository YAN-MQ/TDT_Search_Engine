Jerome Jurenovich, "CNN Headline Sports." The NCAA has taken a bite 
out of the bearcats, putting the University of cincinnati on two years' 
probation while taking away three basketball scholarships because 
of violations in Bob huggin's program. The bearcats, however, are 
not banned from postseason play. I maybe shouldn't say this, but you 
take those people and turn them loose in any program in America, they're 
going to find something.
