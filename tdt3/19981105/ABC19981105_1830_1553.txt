Finally, technology. A problem with the light receptors in the back 
of the eye. 10 million Americans have impaired vision because of it. 
Now, for the first time, thanks to a computer chip, scientists may 
be able to replace the retina. Here's ABC's Jack Smith. When you think 
of computer chips, you think of computers. But what about chips in 
human beings? Incredible as it may seem, it is about to happen. Scientists 
are trying to put silicon chip technology into the human eye to make 
a sort of bionic eye. It's the first time humans and machines have 
been merged in this way. The leading edge of a breakthrough that soon 
may actually cure blindness. We can restore vision by creating an 
electrical induced prosthesis to place into the eye. Using computer 
chip manufacturing techniques, scientists are etching thousands of 
microscopic solar cells onto a tiny silicon chip. Artificial sensors 
in place of the natural ones in the damaged retinas of blind people. 
These are the little solar cells? Right. And there are how many of 
these in each chip? There are proximately 4,000 to 5,000. When the 
chip is implanted in the back of the eye and light strikes those tiny 
solar cells, they turn it into electrical signals that travel through 
the optic nerve to the brain and are interpreted as an image. And 
with this process, the brain, when it receives a signal should not 
be able to tell the difference whether it came from a natural, healthy 
retina, or from our implant. Doctors think blind people might see 
something like this with the implant. And it will improve as they're 
able to cram more microscopic solar cells onto each chip. They've 
already succeeded in testing it in animals, and trials with humans 
in two years will determine if it works in blind people. Researchers 
think it will. And they will actually be able to see again? That is 
what we're hoping. a potentially unprecedented breakthrough combining 
the latest in medicine and computer technology that may soon treat 
and even cure one of mankind's oldest scourges, blindness. Jack Smith,
