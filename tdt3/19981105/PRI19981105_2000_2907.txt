Coming up, an African-American seeking musical sanctuary in Sweden 
on pri. This Public Radio 91 FM, WHYY. Good evening to you. I'm Joe 
Pesudo Pamaco. Are you feeling mauled by America's malls? Well, we'll 
have a discussion about shopping mall culture coming up at tonight 
on NPR's "Talk of the Nation" with Ray Suarez. Then at 10:00, we'll 
look at the technology of longevity. Each week, there seems to be 
new equipment, drugs, diets, and exercises to make ourselves live 
longer. We'll take a look at the high tech fountains of youth in our 
culture. That's on "Beyond Computers" at 10:00 tonight. At 11:00, 
Charlie Rose's scheduled guests include Harry Evans, author of "The 
American Century," and conductor and classical musician Andre Previn. 
Then at midnight, it's the rebroadcast of today's edition of "Radio 
Times" with Marty Mosco Waynes. Stay tuned.
