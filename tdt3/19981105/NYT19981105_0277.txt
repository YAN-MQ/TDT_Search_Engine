Esteemed members of the American Theater Wing, devoted patrons of 
the Drama League, lunchtime habitues of Sardi's, lend me your ears! 
Sandra Bernhard has alighted in our sacred midtown midst and, well, 
she is showing absolutely no respect! Oh, how she picks, picks, picks! 
The vicious jibes at the expense of ``The Scarlet Pimpernel''! The 
nasty little digs at ``Footloose''! ``Hey,'' she announces contemptuously 
from Broadway's epicenter, the stage of the Booth Theater, her head 
swaying in mock ecstasy, her lips curled in a congenital sneer. ``This 
scene rocks!'' Simmer down now, people. She's a hipster-provocateur, 
all right, and if her breaches of common courtesy set your teeth on 
edge, I plead with you, read no further. (The titans she makes sport 
of! Nicole Kidman and Tom Cruise. Alanis Morissette. Liza. Courtney 
Love. Of all the nerve!) If, on the other hand, you're the dastardly 
type who craves a little mouthwatering after-dinner vitriol, who responds 
to a voice that calls forth your inner wild child, who's fantasized 
about taking a trip to the dark side of People magazine, then by all 
means, promptly pay a visit to Ms. Bernhard's scathing fun house. 
There are no excuses for the outrages she commits in her 100-minute 
show, ``I'm Still Here ... Damn It!,'' which opened Thursday night 
at the Booth for a limited run. And that's what makes it such a guilty 
pleasure. (The things she says about Mariah Carey! The denigration 
of Fiona Apple!) Ms. Bernhard may take things all the way to the edge 
_ this is foul-mouthed comedy as an extreme sport _ and even demonstrate 
a cruel streak, as in her devastating impersonation of a vulnerable 
Jennifer Jason Leigh, mumbling the words to ``Cabaret.'' Yet through 
her fearless self-exposure, accentuated by her amazing get-ups, including 
a see-through gown that clings to her slinky cheetah's frame, she 
has the knack of making you an accomplice to her radical naughtiness, 
as she turns wickedness into a grotesque thrill, a joyful release. 
The production is a shortened and revised version of her hit one-woman 
show last season at the Westbeth Theater Center in Greenwich Village. 
It is an eclectic evening in which, aside from trashing fellow celebrities, 
she tells a few sentimental anecdotes, reads a few poems and sings, 
with surprising depth and power, a few original songs and rock classics, 
like ``Dream On'' by Aerosmith and Jim Weatherly's ``Midnight Train 
to Georgia.'' Given the fans she has acquired, through her appearances 
on ``Roseanne'' and her performances in a previous off-Broadway show 
and as a demented fan in Martin Scorsese's offbeat 1983 film, ``The 
King of Comedy,'' Ms. Bernhard has earned her platform on Shubert 
Alley, even if she professes ambivalence about it. Still, as she makes 
plain, the distance she's traveled with ``I'm Still Here'' can't be 
measured in stops on the subway. At times, you do need to have scored 
something close to a perfect 1600 on your HATs _ the Hipness Aptitude 
Test _ to get all the fashion and music and lesbian references to 
things like Manolo Blahnik shoes, the singer Ann Wilson and obscure 
downtown clubs. Smartly, Ms. Bernhard never stops to explain herself 
_ ``Honey, I can't hold your hand here,'' is the show's unspoken motto 
_ and anyway, compiling an encyclopedia of in-ness is her obsession; 
it needn't be yours. The supercharged Ms. Bernhard seems like the 
kind of person to whom you'd want to give a very wide berth on a bad 
day, but in performance, a bad day is what you hope for. No one, but 
no one, does high dudgeon quite the way she does; high heat is where 
she really cooks. The best moments of ``I'm Still Here,'' even at 
its most esoteric, are recited in ire. Invariably, what gets her going 
is some injustice in the glossy worlds of the media and show business, 
as in her parody song ``On the Runway,'' satirizing the grief expressed 
by the supermodel community over the murder of Gianni Versace, or 
her diatribe on the failings of today's young female rock stars, or 
her pique at a recent Newsweek cover depicting a man and a woman who 
have renounced their homosexuality and married. So enter Ms. Bernhard's 
temporary house of worship _ the stage is serenely bedecked in dangling 
votive candles _ and quake merrily as she dismantles Linda Evangelista, 
snipes at Caller ID, inveighs against Cher. ``I'm Still Here'' is 
the perfect experience for the post-election season; it makes you 
choose sides. Me, I'd follow Sandra all the way to the White House. 
Or at least as far as the House of Gucci. PRODUCTION NOTES: `I'M STILL
