NICOSIA, Cyprus (AP) - U.N. Secretary-General Kofi Annan called on 
the international community Thursday to take immediate action to protect 
the rights of children In a message to a conference organized by UNICEF 
and the Cyprus-based Center for World Dialogue, Annan said that the 
``international community needs to act now and on many fronts to honor 
what is in the United Nations Convention on the Rights of the Child.'' 
``No aim is more intensely desirable than that of eradicating the 
dangers to children's lives,'' Annan said in his message. Nearly 13 
million young children die each year, 130 million are denied education 
and 100 million work in exploitative and hazardous conditions, including 
prostitution, Marta Santos Pais, a planning director for UNICEF, said 
at the two-day conference.
