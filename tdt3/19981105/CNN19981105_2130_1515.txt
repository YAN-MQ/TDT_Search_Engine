The television networks are rolling out their very best to entertain 
viewers this month. But it isn't necessarily out of the kindness of 
their hearts, it's sweeps month. Paul Vercammen reports. When the 
members of stomp step into "Mad About You" -- wherever you are going 
and wynonna Judd shows up on the 100th episode of "Touched by an Angel," 
plus Christopher reeve and Darryl Hannah in a remake of "Rear window," 
it can only be television's November ratings period, known as "Sweeps." 
Sweeps is where you put on the 500-pound baby and, you know, the teenage 
prostitutes and the whole stripper thing. So look for roseanne to 
harmonize with Coolio this month. Those were the days The math is 
simple for television stations -- rack up huge numbers during sweeps, 
and they can then charge more for advertising. And this time the programmers 
apparently think that viewers are attracted to music. Upcoming -- 
Garth Brooks and Celine Dion specials. Hanson stops by on "Buddy Faro." 
The temptations miniseries already unfolded to high ratings. Kiss 
appeared on "Mad TV," "Millennium" and "In Concert." Yes, Rock 'N' 
Roll every night. But unlike some sweeps periods gone by, nothing 
too radical. No major guest stars for many shows. Take ABC's "Cupid" 
-- just trying to build an audience. This show is such an underdog. 
We're just a group of folks in Chicago putting the show out, and we 
don't have a lot of those, you know, the star turns on our side. You 
will get brothers Ben and Fred savage joining up on "Boy meets World." 
Husband and wife Alec Baldwin and Kim Basinger on "The Simpsons," 
and family talk on "The Nanny." Fran might be getting pregnant, so 
that's the sort of, kind of plot line throughout the month. And "The 
Love Boat" cast just reunited for sweeps. Is this something to be 
excited about? I don't know. And I'm sure the networks are not real 
excited about this sweeps period either. They might tell you they 
are, but they're not. Those execs will tell you the November ratings 
numbers mean the most for affiliates. Sweeps are more important to 
stations than to networks, you know. I think there is far too much 
emphasis put on them, because to be measured by one month seems sort 
of silly. Nonetheless, madness reigns in November. No matter if this 
sweeps period is toned down and tuned in. Here I am here we are Paul 
Vercammen, "CNN Entertainment News," Hollywood.
