Stocks are down but a little blender is giving bonds a boost. For 
that story, we go to Valerie Morris in New York. Hi, valley. You're 
right. Let's look at stocks first that are tng their downward spiral 
now. In the spotlight today, Alan Greenspan, chairman of the federal 
reserve. He'll be addressing the securities industry association in 
Florida via satellite from D.C. that is expected at 12:15 eastern. 
Ahead of his speech, the Dow is down.
