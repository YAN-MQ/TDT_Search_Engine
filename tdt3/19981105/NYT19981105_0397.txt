The architect Louis Kahn had a radical idea about the relationship 
between ``servant'' spaces and spaces that are ``served.'' According 
to Thomas H. Garver, an art curator who wrote the introduction to 
the book ``Invisible New York,'' Kahn wanted not only to make sure 
each kind of space was clearly articulated but also to raise the status 
of ``servant'' spaces. A furnace room should get as much consideration 
as a lobby. This is a helpful thing to keep in mind when comparing 
the work of two very different photographers of architecture: Julius 
Shulman (at the Yancey Richardson Gallery) and Stanley Greenberg (at 
the Municipal Art Society and at Yancey Richardson). Shulman is known 
for his knockout black-and white pictures of Art Deco movie theaters 
designed by S. Charles Lee and modernist buildings by Richard Neutra, 
Frank Lloyd Wright and Philip Johnson. Greenberg is known for his 
dank-looking black-and-white pictures of catwalks, tunnels, reservoir 
gatehouses and power stations: places where, as Garver puts it, ``the 
services essential to modern urban life are created, harnessed and 
directed.'' Most of Shulman's photographs were taken above ground 
in Los Angeles. Most of Greenberg's were taken underground in New 
York. Shulman photographs buildings that are served; Greenberg, buildings 
that serve. Naturally there are differences. One of Greenberg's most 
memorable shots is down the spiral stairway of the reservoir gatehouse 
under Central Park. The whole thing looks like the aperture of a camera 
shutting down. At the center is a wall with pipes and switches. The 
stairway swirls into that dark mechanical vortex, its wrought-iron 
steps allowing specks of light to filter through. There is no question 
that this is a ``servant'' space. Contrast this with Shulman's photographs 
of Art Deco movie theaters in Los Angeles in the 1940s. A picture 
of the Vern Theater at night shows the word Vern in lights, a delicate 
gem at the top of a curving marquee. The theater is showing ``Meet 
John Doe.'' A picture of the Academy Theater shows the building's 
white column rising dramatically up through the roof, as a spiral 
ledge runs around it catching each letter: A-C-A-D-E-M-Y. The spiral 
has no function except to play with the name of the theater. ``Smith 
Goes to Washington'' is on the marquee. Clearly these are photographs 
of architectural confections, pictures of places where ordinary people 
escape for vicarious adventures. For all the differences, though, 
there are overlaps. Formally, Shulman's photograph of the Guggenheim 
Museum's ramp is not unlike Greenberg's shot down the gatehouse tunnel. 
And the crisp rectilinear frames of Neutra's houses seem to echo the 
endless rectangle that Greenberg found in the valve chamber of Shaft 
2B of City Water Tunnel No. 3 in the Bronx. The similarities suggest 
that when modern architects designed ``served'' spaces, they often 
looked to ``servant'' spaces for inspiration. What were they after? 
It is in Shulman's showiest photograph _ his twilight shot of Pierre 
Koenig's Case Study House No. 22 _ where the categories of ``servant'' 
and ``served'' meet in the most telling way. The photograph shows 
a living room that seems to be cantilevered out over the twinkling 
lights of Los Angeles' grid of streets. Inside there is a drama to 
rival the fantasies on the screens of the movie theaters. The show 
playing there is not ``Meet John Doe'' or `` Smith Goes to Washington.'' 
It is Mrs. Doe meets Mrs. Smith for cocktails at six. Two women sit 
across from one another in the living room. They look almost identical 
in their white party dresses. Both have their legs crossed. This shot 
was carefully set up, as Shulman explained in ``A Constructed View: 
The Architectural Photography of Julius Shulman.'' ``After the floodlights 
were set, I had the girls sit down on chairs,'' he recalled. ``Next 
I told the girls to sit down in the dark with all the lights off, 
including the ceiling fixtures, and then began exposure for ... twilight 
. .. I alerted the girls to sit up and get into conversational mood 
_ they could continue to talk but be relaxed. We switched on the light 
on the ceiling and I flashed bulbs from my camera.'' This is not merely 
a drama of escape; it is also a fantasy of power. These women aren't 
isolated in suburbia. They are floating on a cement slab above the 
city. The living room is an engineering stunt worthy of a great bridge. 
The horizontal lines of the ceilings and floors run straight from 
inside to outside and extend, if you use your imagination, clear across 
the city, as if this house were the climax of a grand scheme to harness 
the power of the city's grid, all its tunnels and reservoirs. The 
illusion is of an escape, but one that is nonetheless plugged into 
all the city's services. The house would not look quite so lovely 
if the ``served'' house were not attached so clearly to the ``serving'' 
city. ``Julius Shulman: Precision and Light: Modernist Architectural 
Photographs, 1935-1963'' and ``Stanley Greenberg: Invisible New York'' 
will remain at the Yancey Richardson Gallery, 560 Broadway, at Prince 
Street, through Nov. 14. ``Invisible New York: The Hidden Infrastructure 
of the City'' will remain at the Municipal Art Society of New York, 
457 Madison Ave., at 50th Street, through Nov. 27.
