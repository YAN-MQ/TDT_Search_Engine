Kentucky, a leading tobacco producing state, is also the leader in 
smoking. The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention reported today 
that nearly 31 percent of adults in Kentucky are smokers, the highest 
percentage of any state. The next highest states are Missouri, Arkansas, 
and Nevada. Utah had the lowest rate of smokers, just one adult in 
seven in part because of the Mormon church's opposition to tobacco. 
California, Hawaii, and the District of Columbia are the next lowest. 
Overall, federal health officials say about 23 percent of adult Americans 
now smoke, about the same as its been for the past few years.
