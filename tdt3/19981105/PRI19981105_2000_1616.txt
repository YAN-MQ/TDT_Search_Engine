Can human beings really be expected to understand how the world's 
financial system works? That was the question that was posed and answered 
today by the chairman of the Federal Reserve. We go to Patrick O'Connell 
at THE WORLD's business desk in New York for the story. Alan Greenspan 
may move the markets but not the weather. He speaks to a meeting in 
Florida to be delivered by satellite. The main them: The Workings 
of International Finance. Amid the current economic crisis, investors 
have been running away from high risk, and that's one aspect of contagion. 
Chairman Greenspan said this was a feature of the way funds can flow 
rapidly in and out of countries. So complex can it be, he wondered: 
Can human beings take it all in. It has become evident time and time 
again that when events become too complex and move too rapidly, as 
appears to be the case today, human beings become demonstrably less 
able to cope. The failure of the ability to comprehend external events 
almost invariably induces disengagement from an activity, whether 
it be fear of entering a dark room or of market volatility. Investors 
worldwide had been listening to this speech for clues over U.S. interest 
rates, but there was little definite about them in this speech. Wall 
Street is waiting for a cut in rates on November the 17th and had 
been hoping for some sign from Chairman Greenspan. For THE WORLD, 
I'm Patrick O'Connell in New York.
