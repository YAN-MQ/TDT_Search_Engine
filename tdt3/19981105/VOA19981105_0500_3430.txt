And this update on events in space, with the shuttle Discovery. Astronaut 
John Glenn, one week into the scientific space mission, is shedding 
a special heart monitor. And he's climbing back into cumbersome head 
gear that studies him while he sleeps. It is all, of course, a part 
of a series of experiments aboard the shuttle Discovery. On how space 
affects an aging man. At 77 years old, the astronaut former senator 
is the oldest man to travel in space. His crewmates, meanwhile, tested 
a special camera system that gives astronauts the ability to view 
areas that can not be seen with the naked eye. That's a system that 
will be used in construction of the International Space Station.
