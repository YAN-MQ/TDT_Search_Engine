Jean Carpenter, a registered Republican and sometime independent voter, 
said she expected more from a candidate than mean-hearted language, 
negative, simple-minded advertisements and rigidly partisan politics. 
That is why, on Tuesday at least, Ms. Carpenter pulled a Democratic 
lever in the North Carolina race for the U.S. Senate between the incumbent 
Republican, Lauch Faircloth, and his challenger, John Edwards. Kary 
Schmidt, who voted for Bob Dole in 1996 because she liked his character, 
said she had voted against Faircloth because she liked his Democratic 
challenger's ideals _ because he seemed to have some. Patty Hutchins, 
a registered Republican in Charlotte, voted Democrat in the Senate 
race because she grew sick of advertisements in which Faircloth compared 
Edwards to President Clinton. Ms. Hutchins said that she kept waiting 
to hear talk _ serious talk _ about issues but that it seemed to come 
mostly from the Democrats. No one is quite sure yet how many Republicans 
actually turned against their party's candidates on Tuesday, either 
by voting against them or not casting a vote for a specific office 
while still voting Republican for others. It may be, here in North 
Carolina as elsewhere, that Democrats just turned out better than 
disgruntled or unmotivated Republicans. But in the Carolinas, especially 
North Carolina, the election of the relatively obscure Edwards, a 
Raleigh trial lawyer making his first race for political office, capped 
off what has been heralded as a great day for a party _both in the 
state and elsewhere in the country _ that could use a little good 
news. Rep. L. Melvin Watt, a Democrat from Charlotte, became the first 
black candidate in North Carolina to win in a majority white district 
_ the district lines had been redrawn _ while Democrats unseated Republicans 
on county commissions and other, local races. But it was the victory 
by Edwards that most people here wanted to talk about, perhaps because 
some voters said his opponent ran not so much on any political ideology 
as on criticism of Democrats _ including advertisements showing Clinton 
and Edwards side by side, their noses growing like Pinocchio's. Jeff 
Lew, a Charlotte Republican, did not cast a ballot in the Senate race, 
voting Republican for others but not backing an incumbent who ran 
such a negative campaign. ``I just couldn't pull the trigger for him,'' 
Lew said. But ``they should not take this as a mandate,'' he said, 
referring to an Election Day in which Democrats nudged Republicans 
from North Carolina offices ranging from the U.S. Senate to the Mecklenburg 
Board of County Commissioners. Instead, Lew and other Republicans 
said, their party should take it as an appeal for something more than 
they were getting, something beyond Clinton-bashing. Ms. Carpenter, 
of Fayettevile, a 50-year-old insurance coordinator for a construction 
company, agreed. ``It was just silly,'' she said, ``and voting to 
me has always been sort of serious.'' Republican candidates seemed 
to bank too much on resentment over Clinton's affair with Monica Lewinsky. 
``I don't think what he did was impeachable,'' Lew said. ``It's just 
not a big issue.'' National Republicans leaders, like Speaker Newt 
Gingrich, acknowledged that Republicans had not given supporters enough 
reasons to vote for a candidate, as opposed to reasons to vote against 
the Democrats. Patty Hutchens, a Republican who works in an accounting 
office, said that she wanted to hear candidates talk about about serious 
issues like jobs but that she got negative advertisements. ``I don't 
care for it,'' Ms. Hutchens said, so she voted for the candidate who 
was the target of those advertisements, Edwards. For Ms. Carpenter, 
too, it was more a vote against the Republican incumbent than for 
the Democrat. ``He did nothing but negative ads, the last two weeks,'' 
she said. ``You have to go with your instinct. You can't vote the 
straight ticket.'' Others said Edwards had simply won them over. ``I 
vote for the candidate,'' said Ms. Schmidt, who designs instruction 
programs for computers, so she had often voted Republican, as she 
did in the 1996 presidential election. This time, the issue of character 
caused her to turn against the Republicans. ``I liked that he seemed 
to be idealistic,'' she said of Edwards, adding that she was looking 
for a candidate who would ``make practical decisions based not on 
party politics.'' Other voters said that the Republican turncoats 
had little to do with the race and that it was just a greater turnout 
by registered Democrats. Whatever the reasons, it was good news for 
people like Barbara Rosenberg, an office worker. Most election mornings, 
lately, it seems as if the Republicans have just claimed more and 
more offices. ``Usually, after an Election Day,'' Ms. Rosenberg said, 
``I feel sick.''
