The remains of what was once a powerful hurricane are headed out to 
sea. Mitch moved across south Florida, dumping rain and bringing high 
winds and a number of tornadoes. Storm tides three feet to five feet 
above normal flooded parts of the florida coast. Hardest hit in Florida 
were the keys. High winds flipped over mobile homes and ripped off 
roofs on the island chain. One death is being reported. A driver slid 
off a highway in a downpour in FT. Lauderdale. All warnings for tropical 
storm Mitch have now been dropped. We'll take a look at the weather 
forecast for the United States at 38 minutes past the hour.
