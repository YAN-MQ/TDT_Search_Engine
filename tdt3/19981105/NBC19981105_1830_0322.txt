Still ahead tonight -- NBC news "in depth." A stunning breakthrough 
that could revolutionize medicine. It is a big deal to us, absolutely. 
It is a big deal. Creating the building blocks of the human body -- 
in a laboratory. How many lives could be saved by this medical breakthrough? 
And streamlining the impeachment process. The election is over, why 
the republicans are changing strategy. MA, if you have trouble sleeping, 
take a unisom. It helped last time, didn't it? Didn't you feel better 
after a good night's sleep? It's O.K. the doctor said it's not habit 
forming. That's right. Unisom. MA, there's nothing wrong with helping 
yourself get a good night's sleep. All right? I love you, too. I love 
being out in the sun. It makes me feel so alive. Now I really enjoy 
being outdoors because I've discovered this new lotion... that's been 
awarded the skin cancer foundation seal, designed for women our age. 
This SPF 15 formula with intense vitamin-enriched moisture... helps 
protect maturing skin from future U.V. damage. It minimizes, even 
helps prevent, age spots. And the name? Provital protective moisture 
lotion from oil of Olay. Proven to help you look revitalized.
