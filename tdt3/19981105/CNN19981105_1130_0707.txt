Acne isn't a fatal condition, but most people wouldn't have believed 
that when they were teenagers. It's caused by dead skin cells and 
oils that clog pores, allowing bacteria to build up. Despite popular 
belief, eating chocolate or greasy foods doesn't cause acne, but dermatologists 
say people should avoid foods that seem to make the problem worse. 
While there is no instant cure for acne, there are some basic treatments 
that can bring relief. Skin should be washed twice a day. Topical 
creams such as benzoyl peroxide, retinoic acids and antibiotic creams 
can be used to help unblock pores and promote healing. Ultraviolet 
light and even natural sunlight may help more severe cases. It takes 
time, but most people eventually outgrow acne. It usually clears up 
when the teenage years are over.
