It's back to this. Again, the U.S. has spoken, and again the U.S. 
is preparing. A plan is in place by the U.N. to punish Iraq militarily 
for violating a Deal for inspections. Henry Hyde returning the impeachment 
show in the house has announced his plans. He wants to know from the 
president what is the truth here? And from "dateline NBC," a young 
man is dead, shot by police, but did he mean for it to happen just 
that way? And good Thursday evening to you. A lot to tell you about 
tonight, including a developing story out of the pentagon. Also tonight 
what may be a power play in progress in the house that may result 
in a new house speaker. We'll have an update from Nicaragua this evening, 
a "dateline NBC" as well. And the latest "Harper's" index and the 
first look at the Friday papers this Thursday evening.
