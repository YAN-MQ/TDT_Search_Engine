He was not on the ballot, but Tuesday's election was a referendum 
of sorts on Sen. Mitch McConnell, the Kentucky Republican who is chairman 
of the National Republican Senatorial Committee and a staunch foe 
of revising the campaign finance laws. The results were decidedly 
mixed. Bad news for McConnell came from Wisconsin, where Russell Feingold, 
a Democrat, was re-elected. Feingold has been crusading to pass legislation 
to overhaul the campaign finance system, and he made the effort a 
central issue in his race against Rep. Mark Neumann. McConnell not 
only was the leader of efforts to kill the campaign finance bill this 
year, his committee had poured nearly $1 million into Wisconsin television 
commercials attacking Feingold. ``I'm coming your way Senator McConnell,'' 
Feingold declared on Tuesday at his re-election victory party in Middleton, 
Wis., vowing to redouble his efforts to change the way elections are 
financed. McConnell had hoped to expand the Republican majority and 
had fattened the coffers of his committee with more than $75 million, 
compared with $52 million raised by the Democratic Senatorial Campaign 
Committee for the 1998 elections. Yet the impressive pile of cash 
did not bring any gains in the Republicans' 55-to-45 seat Senate majority. 
And the two Republican senators who lost, Alfonse D'Amato of New York 
and Lauch Faircloth of North Carolina, were ousted by Democrats who 
championed campaign financing changes. On the bright side for McConnell, 
his Kentucky colleague, Representative Jim Bunning, beat Rep. Scotty 
Baesler, a Democrat who also backed campaign finance change, in a 
race to replace retiring Sen. Wendell Ford. That race was uncomfortably 
close, despite the millions McConnell spent in his home state. At 
a news briefing Thursday with Rep. John Linder of Georgia, the chairman 
of the National Republican Congressional Committee, McConnell said 
he did not think the issue was decisive in the Feingold race. ``I 
saw no survey data from Wisconsin indicating that campaign finance 
reform decided that race,'' he said. In that contest and others, McConnell 
said he thought Democrats were ``more motivated.'' But the advocates 
of campaign finance overhaul disagreed. They said the Maginot Line 
the Kentucky Republican has fortified in Washington against reforming 
election spending might be cracking under pressure from the states. 
Massachusetts and Arizona passed ballot initiatives intended to drive 
special interest money out of election financing. ``Mitch McConnell 
substantially misread the public on this issue,'' said Ellen Miller, 
the executive director of Public Campaign, an organization that advocates 
public financing of federal elections. ``Tuesday gave us some concrete 
evidence that voters are tired of the status quo when it comes to 
how we finance our elections.'' There was also grousing by some Republicans 
that McConnell had limited committee financing for the Republican 
candidate in Washington, Representative Linda Smith, a champion of 
changing campaign financing, in her Senate race against the Democratic 
incumbent, Patty Murray, who was re-elected. Even some Democrats, 
who were celebrating the election results, questioned whether there 
had been a mandate for campaign finance overhaul or a rebuke of McConnell. 
Many Democratic candidates were aided by the $10 million to $12 million 
that the Democratic senatorial committee spent on issue advertisements, 
financed with so-called soft money, the unrestricted money that can 
be donated to political parties for general campaign use. Such money 
would be banned under Feingold's bill, co-sponsored by Sen. John McCain, 
R-Ariz. Although all 45 Senate Democrats voted for the campaign finance 
bill, not every Democrat is truly eager to see it enacted. ``There 
aren't many incumbent Democrats who want to give up their financial 
edge,'' a party strategist said. ``The current system works well for 
many of them.''
