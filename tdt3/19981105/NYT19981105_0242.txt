There's a good little movie playing at the resurrected Thalia Theater. 
It has no dazzling special effects or big-name stars, but James Rosenow's 
``Crossing Fields'' has memorable characters in provocative situations 
that revolve around marriage, infidelity, sexism, parent-child relationships 
and race. Funny, sad and sexy, this engaging film is set among essentially 
decent people living modest, mainstream lives in a superficially placid, 
churchgoing Middle Western community. Its principal story contrasts 
the life of Carol (Reedy Gibbs), a woman in her 40s in a solid if 
unexciting marriage, with that of her best friend, Jessica (Gwynyth 
Walsh), a storm-tossed woman who responds to her husband's affair 
by sleeping with, figuratively, half the men in town. In addition 
to this story, Rosenow, a New York University film school graduate 
who is the writer, producer and director of this well-acted first 
feature, provides a generous helping of others. While Carol's easygoing 
husband, Guy (J.K. Simmons) looks on, Carol is in conflict with their 
daughter, Denise (Meadow Sisto), who is fighting the idea of college 
and sneaking out of the house at night to pursue her career as a rock 
musician. Into the lives of this family comes a boarder, James (William 
James Jones), a handsome, muscular and altogether charming and level-headed 
young black man who is seeking work and knowledge of white society. 
Many of the comfortable beliefs Carol has lived by are shaken by his 
presence and by Jessica's turmoil, compounded by a former lover's 
threat to foreclose the mortgage on her family farm and the prospect 
of resuming her marriage. Rosenow handles his material and his cast 
with skill. Moviegoers who look to shootouts, car crashes and explosions 
for stimulation are advised to avoid ``Crossing Fields.'' Those who 
find stimulation in intelligent issues, realistic characters and lively 
storytelling are likely to find this film appealing. PRODUCTION NOTES:
