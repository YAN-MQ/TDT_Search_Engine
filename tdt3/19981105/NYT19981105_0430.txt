A Cuban exile group from Miami filed a suit here Thursday against 
President Fidel Castro of Cuba, charging him with genocide and terrorism. 
The group submitted the complaint to the Spanish court that has brought 
similar charges against Gen. Augusto Pinochet, the former Chilean 
dictator who has been arrested in London. The Miami group, the Foundation 
for Human Rights in Cuba, asked the National Court to arrest and prosecute 
Castro, saying he had committed human rights abuses since taking power 
in 1959. The court is expected to decide on accepting the case in 
10 days, said a lawyer for the foundation, Francisco Javier Barrilero.
