A premature release by the Labor Department of sensitive job figures 
brought down interest rates Thursday just as the government was about 
to borrow $10 billion, upsetting much of Wall Street. The Labor Department's 
error meant that the Treasury appeared to save more than $200 million 
in interest costs over the 30-year life of the bonds. It also bloodied 
bond traders, many of whom had established their usual short positions 
ahead of the government's auction and had hoped to distribute the 
new supply of bonds before grappling with the job report scheduled 
for release Thursday. ``Everybody got whiplashed from this,'' said 
David Jones of Aubrey Lanston, a specialist in Treasury securities, 
noting that traders were already reeling from many weeks of market 
volatility caused by foreign turmoil. The Treasury would make no estimate 
of the impact on its borrowing costs, though a spokesman did observe 
that other factors could have intervened between 9:20 a.m., when rates 
responded almost instantaneously to the leak, and the 1 p.m. auction. 
But whatever the Treasury's savings, the benefit is likely to prove 
short-lived, some Wall Street analysts said. ``The bad memories will 
be carried over to future auctions,'' one predicted, resulting in 
more cautious bidding. The monthly job figures are generally considered 
the most important set of economic data, with the change in employer 
payrolls _ contained in the table that was inadvertently released 
on the Internet Thursday morning _ usually the figure with the most 
market impact. After the mistake-induced rally, however, the bond 
market retreated and interest rates, which move inversely to prices, 
rose several hundredths of a percentage point for most maturities. 
The 30-year bond finished at 5.34 percent, up from 5.32 on Wednesday 
and 5.30 at Thursday's auction. The stock market, down as much as 
68 points in late morning, rebounded smartly, with the Dow Jones industrials 
setting the pace with a gain of 132.33 points, or 1.51 percent. The 
change of heart in both markets was attributed variously to a fuller 
look at the job figures, to relatively weak demand at the Treasury's 
auction and to comments made by Alan Greenspan to the Securities Industry 
Association's convention in Florida. The Federal Reserve chairman 
said he saw signs that yield spreads and liquidity premiums among 
bonds of different quality were narrowing again and that it was ``plausible'' 
that they would ``soon fall into more normal ranges.'' Bond people 
seemed to interpret this as meaning that Greenspan would find it less 
urgent to cut short-term interest rates again when his policy body 
meets on Nov. 17. Stock people may have found in his remarks reassurance 
that the economy was likely to keep growing and avoid a credit crunch 
and business downturn that would erode profits. Economists, too, came 
to differing conclusions after digesting Thursday's figures, which 
included a rise in first-time claims for unemployment insurance. Shares 
of banks and brokerage houses were among the biggest gainers. Charles 
Schwab jumped 4 5/8, to 58 3/8, while Morgan Stanley Dean Witter, 
Chase Manhattan, BankAmerica, J.P. Morgan and BankBoston all posted 
gains of more than two points, perhaps buoyed by more European rate 
cuts and, in Morgan's case, by takeover speculation. Steel stocks 
had another strong day as the industry pressed its case in Washington 
against what it contends is dumping by importers. Nucor climbed 1 
1/2, to 48 3/8, and USX-US Steel climbed 15/16, to 27 5/8. Delta Air 
Lines, up 2 3/4, to 108 3/4, led a higher airline group. The Standard 
&AMP; Poor's 500-stock index performed nearly as well as the Dow industrials, 
rising 15.18, or 1.36 percent, while the Nasdaq market and the Russell 
2000 advanced fractionally. Greenspan's comments came just as investors 
prepared to bid on $10 billion of bonds, in the third and last installment 
of the government's $38 billion debt sale. The new bonds sold at 5.30 
percent, 1 basis point higher than dealers expected and a sign of 
dampened demand.
