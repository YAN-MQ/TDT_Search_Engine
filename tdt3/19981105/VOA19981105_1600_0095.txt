The death toll from Hurricane Mitch continues to rise in Central America. 
And health officials from El Salvador to Honduras say the big threat 
now is hunger and disease. Hundreds of thousands of people are homeless. 
About nine thousand are dead. And as many as thirteen thousand missing. 
VOA's Bill Rogers is in Nicaragua and has more. The two hardest hit 
nations: Honduras and Nicaragua continue to struggle to recover from 
the widespread destruction caused by Hurricane Mitch. The scope of 
the devastation has overwhelmed relief efforts. And there are shortages 
of food, water, medicines, and other supplies. Here in Nicaragua, 
helicopters from the Armed Forces, along with those provided by other 
countries, are flying into isolated communities with emergency relief. 
But in some cases, the choppers have been unable to land. Because 
of poor weather conditions or other problems at the landing site. 
And so must return to the capitol Managua without making their deliveries. 
This has fostered growing frustration among many survivors. Who complain 
the government is not doing enough. Meanwhile, civil defense workers 
have begun burning the hundreds of bodies that litter the landscape 
around the Casitas Volcano near here. Site of a massive landslide. 
In an effort to prevent an outbreak of cholera. Bill Rogers, VOA News.
