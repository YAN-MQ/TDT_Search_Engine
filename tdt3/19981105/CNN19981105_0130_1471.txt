He's already been a Navy S.E.A.L., a radio talk-show host and a Professional 
wrestler. Soon Jesse Ventura will be something else, the governor 
of Minnesota. Bill Delaney has more on Ventura's unique story. Jesse! 
Jesse! Jesse! Having body-slammed on election day the democrat and 
republican who ran against him as mercilessly as he ever pinned some 
poor slob as a Professional wrestler, governor-elect Jesse Ventura 
of Minnesota, the morning after, seemed darn-near demure at a press 
conference with retiring governor arne Carlson. And after a brief 
tour of the state house, that's now his. In 1964, Muhammad Ali beat 
Sonny liston when he wasn't supposed to. In 1980, we had an Olympic 
hockey team that wasn't supposed to win, and they did. So I think 
the message is, if you believe in your dreams, this is still the United 
States of America where dreams can come true. By lunchtime, at Don 
Pablo's Mexican restaurant in suburban minneapolis, even minnesotans 
who never dreamed of a Ventura governorship seemed willing to give 
him his shot. Actually, I'm kind of shocked he was elected. But I 
think he'll do fine. I think he'll -- he does not have the background 
that everybody else has, but that's kind of actually refreshing. I 
was ready for a change and I was tired of the standard old political 
lines I was hearing. In fact, the governor-elect went right back to 
work at his radio show, ripping a radio rival. And I hope you're listening 
out there chicken hawk. 'cause you know who I'm talking to. And I'm 
renaming you now, Minnesota's Mr. wrong. Calling them as he sees them, 
a big part of Ventura's draw, for the unprecedented numbers of young 
voters who turned out for him, though his support cut across all party 
lines. What may yet throw governor-elect Ventura, the Minnesota legislature. 
Unlike professional wrestling, the fix won't be in here. Ventura's 
reform party has no one in the legislature, and the governor-elect's 
charisma will only likely get him so far with democrats and republicans. 
For the moment though, the man formerly known as "the body" was mostly 
putting his mind to the next four years as head of Minnesota's body 
politic. Thank you, everybody. Bill Delaney, CNN, St. Paul, Minnesota.
