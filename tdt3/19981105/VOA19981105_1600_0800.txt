Prosecutors trying to investigate alleged war crimes in Kosovo have 
called off a planned trip to the Serbian province. After Yugoslav 
authorities said they would not be allowed to conduct any investigations. 
Lauren Komoto reports from the Heig, that the prosecutors from the 
Yugoslav War Crimes Tribunal insists they have the jurisdiction to 
investigate. This battle has been building for almost a month now. 
Ever since Chief Prosecutor Louise Arbor requested visas from Yugoslav 
authorities for herself and 10 investigators. The Yugoslav government 
has consistently denied the Tribunal's authority to investigate. And 
Ms. Arbor has just as consistently asserted her right to unrestricted 
access in Kosovo. She cites several Security Council resolutions to 
back up her claims. Just Wednesday, Ms. Arbor told reporters she was 
still optimistic about getting her delayed visas. But that hope was 
dashed later that night. After she received a letter from Yugoslav 
officials granting her only a visa to attend a law conference in Belgrade. 
Thursday, Ms. Arbor said she decided to decline what she calls, "an 
unacceptably limited visa." I intend to continue pursuing all legal 
means available to me until I am granted access to the relevant site. 
And to the witnesses that I may choose to contact in Kosovo. Tribunal 
President Gabrielle Kurf McDonald backed her up. Calling Yugoslav 
officials' actions totally unacceptable and illegal. This conduct 
is a further example of the FRY's utter disregard for the norms of 
the international community. Essentially, it has become a rogue state. 
One that holds the international rule of law in contempt. Judge McDonald 
called off her own trip to Belgrade. Saying it was inappropriate for 
her to travel to a state that is blatantly challenging the Tribunal's 
authority. She also pointed out that the Yugoslav government is challenging 
the authority of the Security Council. And said she will urge the 
Council to respond forcefully. For the moment though, there are no 
onsite investigations in Kosovo. Despite what Prosecutor Arbor has 
called "credible reports of atrocities." Including summary executions, 
destruction, and attacks against civilians. Lauren Komoto, for VOA 
News, the Heig.
