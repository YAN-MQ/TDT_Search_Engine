That ``amazing 31-year-old freshman'' tearing up the football field 
is none other than the former ``water distribution engineer,'' Bobby 
Boucher (Adam Sandler). Bobby is a simple soul from bayou country. 
He comes from a swampy home sweet home where Mama (Kathy Bates) proudly 
cooks snake roast (the apple in its mouth is a nice touch) and where 
Steve the pet mule is right at home in the living room. When he first 
appears in ``The Waterboy,'' Bobby contentedly rides a lawn mower 
about town at 10 miles an hour. He doesn't yet have a clue about what 
fun it would be to put on a football uniform and knock the stuffing 
out of an opposing team. ``The Waterboy'' gives Sandler a perfect 
excuse to lapse into happy idiot mode, with a silly voice and sillier 
grin and silly sight gags all around him. But in collaborating again, 
after ``The Wedding Singer,'' with a group of his college buddies, 
including Frank Coraci as director, Sandler comes out looking like 
an honorary Farrelly brother, turning dumbing-down into loony, unapologetic 
fun. Like the Farrellys' ``There's Something About Mary,'' this escapist 
comedy is so cheerfully outlandish that it's hard to resist, and so 
good-hearted that it's genuinely endearing. There's a lot more innocence 
to what Sandler does than there is in many a film made specifically 
for children. As in ``The Wedding Singer,'' Coraci wisely surrounds 
Sandler with seasoned, appealing actors who lend a touch of class. 
Ms. Bates, decked out so colorfully that it looks as if the circus 
had come to town, is an utter hoot as the domineering mother who keeps 
Bobby in line. (She also appears in black-and-white flashbacks talking 
to a young, impressionable water boy, since Bobby had the job as a 
child and never grew up to do anything else.) Ms. Bates has one of 
her funniest scenes feeding barbecued baby gators to Vicki Vallencourt 
(Fairuza Balk), the sexy little jailbird who means to lead Bobby astray. 
``The Waterboy'' tells what happens when Bobby is fired by a half-decent 
college team (with Jerry Reed as its fire-breathing coach) and winds 
up on an abysmal one: the backwoods Louisiana Mud Dogs, with a 40-game 
losing streak and cheerleaders so depressed that they sit around getting 
drunk on the sidelines. Out here in football Siberia, the coach (Henry 
Winkler) is another seasoned loser, but soon he and Bobby have achieved 
a meeting of the minds. Joining the Mud Dogs only to make sure they 
don't drink cockroach-infested sludge, Bobby accidentally shows his 
mettle on the playing field. It turns out that anybody who slights 
a) Bobby's mother or b) Bobby's water supply had better be ready for 
Bobby Boucher, fighting machine. Though the film moves predictably 
enough from here _ want to guess whether the Mud Dogs will have a 
phenomenally good season with Bobby's help? _ it stays enjoyably goofy 
throughout. There are bad-hair flashbacks to the 1970s, Louisiana 
frog cakes with the legs sticking out, one guy who speaks with an 
absolutely unintelligible Cajun accent, and heads that morph into 
Bobby's imagined enemies just before he flattens players on the field. 
Sandler keeps himself sweetly ridiculous while also managing to give 
his character some heart, and Ms. Bates makes a hilarious comic foil. 
Even Ms. Balk, who usually plays much nastier roles, fits into the 
film's overall high spirits and witty naivete. Sandler succeeds in 
doing to football whatever he did to golf (``Happy Gilmore'') and 
in making his version of the sports-savant movie look like an awfully 
good bet. PRODUCTION NOTES: `THE WATERBOY' Directed by Frank Coraci;
