The Tour de France, its image badly tarnished by a doping scandal 
last year, will be shorter and less grueling next summer. But organizers 
of the prestigious cycling race, who unveiled the route for next year's 
20-stage race Thursday, emphasized that despite last year's troubles, 
``the Tour's popularity remains intact.'' The 3,680-kilometer (2,286-mile) 
race will start in Puy du Fou in central France with a short prologue 
on July 3 and will end with its traditional ride up and down the Champs-Elysees 
on July 25. The Tour, which will be about 200 kilometers (124 miles) 
shorter than last year, will also include an extra day of rest. One 
cyclist unhappy about the changes is reigning Tour de France champion 
Marco Pantani who hinted Thursday that he might pull out of the race 
next year. Pantani said he was particularly concerned that there will 
be less hill cycling at the event as of next year. ``It's not a course 
to my liking,'' Pantani said Thursday night. ``There's too much against-the-clock 
racing.'' Jean-Marie Leblanc, the race director, sought to play down 
last year's doping scandal. ``Since my arrival in 1989, there has 
been a trend toward making the route easier,'' Leblanc told reporters. 
He said the fact that none of the host towns have backed out of the 
Tour in the wake of the scandal, proof that France's most beloved 
sporting event has not lost its appeal. The Tour de France was rocked 
last year by a doping scandal that saw the Festina team expelled following 
revelations of the systematic use of EPO, a performance-enhancing 
drug. Festina's team director, doctor and masseur were jailed during 
a preliminary investigation after banned substances were found in 
a team car. Seeking to repair cycling's tattered image, three top 
French sponsors said last month they have signed a charter aimed at 
clamping down on the use of banned drugs among cyclists with stiff 
provisions for members of their teams. Next year's course includes 
the usual two time trials _ the first in Metz on July 11 before arrival 
in the Alps, and the second in Poitiers on July 24. In its only stage 
outside France, the route will take riders to Sestrieres in the Italian 
Alps on July 13. The racers will then head south to the Pyrenees mountains, 
climbing to the Piau-Engaly Pass _ the Tour's highest ever at 1,810 
meters (5,938 feet) _ on July 20. In all, the racers will climb 23 
mountain passes. Looking toward the year 2000, organizers said the 
Tour could start on the island of Guadeloupe.
