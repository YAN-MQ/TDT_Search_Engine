In the impeachment chess game it's now President Clinton's move. Today, 
house Judiciary committee chairman Henry Hyde sent a letter to the 
president asking him to confirm or deny under oath certain aspects 
of Ken starr's report. White House lawyers say they are reviewing 
the letter and will answer in due time. CNN has learned the letter 
asks 81 questions over nine pages. The questions concern the scope 
of his relationship with Monica Lewinsky and about gifts to her. Questions 
also address the president's conversations with his secretary, betty 
Currie, and about his role in hiring private investigators. The first 
question asks him to acknowledge whether he's the chief law enforcement 
officer of the United States. Hyde says answering the questions will 
allow his committee to speed up the impeachment inquiry by calling 
just one major witness, the independent counsel himself. We believe 
the most relevant witnesses have already testified at length about 
the matters in issue, and in the interest of finishing our expeditious 
inquiry, we will not require most of them to come before us to repeat 
their testimony. The committee will invite judge Starr to appear in 
public session on november 19th. Judge Starr led the investigation, 
and we believe his testimony will be helpful to the committee. President 
Clinton again declined to comment on the pending proceedings, but 
he says Tuesday's elections showed the public rejects the controversy 
as a Key issue. I want these hearings to be constitutional, fair and 
expeditious. And at the appropriate time, in the appropriate way, 
we will say whatever we intend to say. But I have nothing to say about 
it. I think the important thing is that we've got to go back and do 
the people's business. The American people sent us a message that 
would break the eardrums of anyone that was listening. They want their 
business tended to.
