As the Security Council declared President Saddam Hussein in ``flagrant 
violation'' of United Nations resolutions, the Clinton administration 
moved ahead Thursday with preparations for air strikes against Iraq, 
Administration and other Western officials said. In a statement Thursday 
night, President Clinton called Iraq's decision to end cooperation 
with United Nations weapons inspectors ``totally unacceptable'' and 
suggested that the United States was prepared to act soon if Saddam 
did not reverse the decision. ``The burden is on Iraq to get back 
in compliance and meet its obligations _ immediately,'' Clinton said. 
The administration has not yet set a deadline, however, and officials 
said it had no timetable for military action. But they also made it 
clear that the United States did not support a new 11th-hour mission 
by U.N. Secretary-General Kofi Annan or other diplomats, suggesting 
that a military response could come swiftly. ``He knows what he needs 
to do,'' an administration official said of Saddam. ``He doesn't need 
any more messages.'' Secretary of Defense William Cohen completed 
a tour Thursday of the Persian Gulf allies with stops in Oman and 
the United Arab Emirates, before flying to Egypt, where he met with 
President Hosni Mubarak and other Egyptian officials. Cohen, traveling 
with Under Secretary of State Thomas Pickering and the commander of 
U.S. forces in the Gulf, Gen. Anthony Zinni, ended the day in Jordan. 
Although Cohen won no public expressions of support for the Administration's 
stance against Iraq, officials said he had received pledges of cooperation 
from some gulf allies for any attack the United States might lead. 
The officials said that while many Arab states expressed sympathy 
for the Iraqi people, there had been less opposition to the use of 
force than in previous confrontations with Saddam. In brief remarks 
at the White House earlier Thursday, Clinton said he believed that 
the Persian Gulf allies had pledged support for ``whatever decisions 
we ultimately make.'' The administration and the Pentagon have refused 
to disclose details of exactly what support Cohen and his entourage 
are seeking. But American and European officials said Thursday that 
Saudi Arabia had, for instance, agreed to let the United States use 
aircraft based at Prince Sultan Air Base outside Riyadh to support 
a strike. The officials also said Kuwait and the United Arab Emirates 
had agreed to allow American planes based in those countries to be 
used if necessary. The United States has sharply reduced the size 
of its forces in the area, from a high of more than 400 aircraft to 
about 170 aircraft now. It has also reduced its fleet in the gulf 
to 13 warships, led by the aircraft carrier Dwight Eisenhower, though 
it has doubled the number of cruise missiles those ships are carrying. 
For a time earlier this year, the United States had two carriers and 
more than 30 other warships. But officials at the Pentagon said the 
forces there could conduct a potent strike against Iraq on a moment's 
notice. On Friday Cohen's entourage is scheduled to visit Turkey, 
which allows U.S. and British aircraft to patrol the so-called no-flight 
zone over northern Iraq from its air base at Incirlik. Cohen then 
plans to stop in Paris for meetings with French military officials 
before returning to the United States. The White House announced that 
the president's national security adviser, Sandy Berger, would meet 
with his counterparts from Britain and France, John Holmes and Jean 
David Lavitte, during a previously scheduled trip to Paris on Saturday.
