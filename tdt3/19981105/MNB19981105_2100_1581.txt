Let's look at the weather now. I was wondering what you were going 
to say when you correlated the two of them. Glad to know they both 
have dolls. Here's a look at what's happening with Mitch. Mitch is 
no longer a tropical storm. It's lost all tropical characteristics. 
We call it extra tropical as it goes into ocean waters over the atlantic. 
It may produce rain in bermuda, but the wind and rain is leaving Florida. 
Just a few scattered clouds. Mitch dumped 10 inches of rain in some 
areas. You can see that's all that's left of the rain. Most of it 
is offshore. As we continue to look around the rest of the country, 
you can see the thick clouds moving off the east coast. The rest of 
the nation is rather quiet. Some light snow and rain showers in the 
pacific northwest. Clear from California to the southwest. 68 in Phoenix. 
Very cold in the northern tier states, bhinmin and North Dakota. The 
temperatures are in the 20's. We had a record low in Atlantic City 
of 23 degrees. Tonight you'll be in the 30's. Half of the nation will 
be below freezing in the teens and 20's. Highs in the 20's and 30's 
in the northern Rockies and plains into the upper midwest. 60's and 
70's from Florida to Texas. Specifically, you'll see a high temperature 
of 66 in Los Angeles tomorrow, rain showers in Seattle. Washington, 
D.C. will be Chili with sunshine, 49. 45 in Boston. 48 degrees in 
New York City. 79 degrees in Miami. Check out the wind flow over the 
next couple of days. The southern jet stream will be flowing across 
the nation's midsection. South of that will be very warm. There will 
be rain showers across the southwest with a storm spinning. It remains 
cold in New England. That's the weather around the nation.
