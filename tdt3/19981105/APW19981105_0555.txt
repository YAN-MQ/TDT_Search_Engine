Bill Clinton's brother says the president's daughter Chelsea has been 
deeply affected by the Monica Lewinsky sex scandal and has done her 
utmost to survive the ordeal. In an interview published in this week's 
Paris Match, Clinton's younger brother Roger said his niece was conducting 
her life business as usual, but that things weren't easy. ``She's 
going to class every day and I imagine that, in that her milieu, there's 
no shortage of talk ...,'' Clinton was quoted as telling the weekly 
magazine. Chelsea is a sophomore at Stanford University in Palo Alto, 
Ca. ``For the moment, the situation isn't easy because things have 
been blown out of proportion. Despite her sense of humor and gaiety, 
Chelsea has been deeply affected by the scandal, like Bill, like Hillary,'' 
the president's younger brother told Paris Match. Clinton, a rock'n 
roll singer who had a drug problem in the mid-1980s, said he had no 
idea what Hillary was feeling, and had no intention of trying to guess. 
``No one can put themselves in her shoes,'' he was quoted as saying. 
The magazine ran seven pages of family photos of the younger Clinton, 
his wife and baby taken during Christmas holidays celebrated with 
the First Family in the White House. Several show the president cooing 
over his baby nephew, Tyler. Clinton described his niece as ``intelligent, 
brilliant, with a good sense of humor. ``I'm convinced we'll hear 
from her someday, believe me,'' he was quoted as saying. ``She's really 
something special!'' Clinton said Chelsea would never give up her 
good spirits, regardless of what the three were going through. He 
also said his relationship with Hillary had improved over the years, 
and blamed their strained past on his own pig-headedness. `` I wasn't 
in good shape at the time, and I refused to take her advice,'' Clinton 
was quoted as saying. ``Today, if I've got my head on straight, it's 
because of her.''
