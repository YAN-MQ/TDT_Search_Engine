Wednesday, Mitch was upgraded to a tropical storm again, then it hit 
the florida keys. Tropical storm warnings are in effect for coasts 
on both the gulf and atlantic sides of Florida. Mitch's 45-mile-an-hour 
winds caused tornadoes that touched down in key largo, and one that 
took the roof off a motel in islamorada. The keys are still recovering 
from damage inflicted by hurricane georges last month.
