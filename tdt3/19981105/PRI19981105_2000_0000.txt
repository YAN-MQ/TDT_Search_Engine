This is THE WORLD, a co-production of the BBC World Service, PRI, 
and WGBH Boston. It's Thursday, November 5th. I'm Lisa Mullions in 
Boston. Today, a $70 million USA package for Central America, and 
a $5 million U.S. bounty for Osama bin Laden. I'm convinced as is 
the government that there's probably some fellow out there that claims 
to be a Taliban supporter or Islamic extremist that would really rather 
live in 90210 and get a green card, that and a few million bucks and 
shop on Rodeo Drive. And if you knew sushi like Matthew Weisner knows 
sushi, you'd smell something fishy in Japan. First, this news. From 
National Public Radio News in Washington, I'm Corey Flintoff.
