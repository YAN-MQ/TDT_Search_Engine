In addition to electing new politicians Tuesday, Americans took lawmaking 
into their own hands. Dozens and dozens of policy and constitution 
issues ranging from marijuana to suicide. Voters in Alaska, Arizona, 
Nevada and Washington State approved a measure allowing doctors to 
prescribe marijuana for medical purposes. Voters dealt a setback to 
Gay Rights initiatives. Hawaii and Alaska upheld bans on same-sex 
marriages, while Colorado defeated a measure to protect homosexuals 
from discrimination. Both Washington State and Colorado overturned 
bans on late-term abortions. Washington State also ended an affirmative 
action program that allowed racial and gender hiring preferences. 
Michigan voters rejected legalizing doctor-assisted suicide.
