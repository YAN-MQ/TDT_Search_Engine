Some aspiring stand-up comedians are giving it the old college try, 
or in this case, let's call it the elementary school try. Brian Cabell 
reports. It's time for amateur hour at the comedy club, and we are 
talking amateurs. What does it mean when you do really well? How do 
you say it if you do really well? You bombed! No, that's bad. No, 
I killed, I killed. So we're gonna say, we're gonna kill 'em. All 
right, ready? One, two, three -- We're gonna kill 'em! They are children, 
8 to 12 years old, making their stand-up debuts. Boy, I haven't been 
this nervous since my breasts. They wrote their own jokes, with help 
from parents and their comedy teacher. And, as you might expect, some 
of the best material dealt with dad and mom. Last night, she told 
us it was cajun night, and she served us blackened macaroni and cheese. 
For five weeks, they worked on their routines with Janet Schultz, 
herself a comedian. She played the role of instructor, sounding board 
and baby-sitter. They're not all class clowns, but most of them are. 
So, you're talking about eight or nine class clowns in one room with 
me for two hours. The show, performed before an audience of a hundred, 
mostly family and friends, was in effect their graduation. Wait a 
minute, I hear laughing. That guy's smiling, that guy's clapping. 
Whoops. Not all the routines went smoothly, though cheat sheets on 
a hand or nearby stool helped. But no one bombed, and a few of them 
killed. You know, I go to a Jewish school, and at my school when we 
choose sides for sports, everybody gets picked last. Ethnic or racial 
humor, the kids had been taught, was acceptable only if they were 
members of that ethnic or racial group. You know, like if a white 
kid is running wild in the aisles and gets lost in cub foods, you 
see the mom doing this -- "Bobby, please don't do that, bobby come 
back here now." But if a black kid is running around, a whole other 
story. Mom gets on the P.A. system -- "roderick, you better get your 
black butt over here! I'm gonna kick it from the bakery to the paper 
goods!" Was there a young Whoopi Goldberg or a Jerry Seinfeld here? 
Maybe, maybe not. But for an evening at least, these kids got to experience 
the anxiety and elation of stand-up comedy. Thank you so much. Brian 
Cabell, CNN, Atlanta.
