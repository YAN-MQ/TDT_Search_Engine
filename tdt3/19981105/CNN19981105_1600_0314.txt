Scientists are celebrating a stunning discovery. Researchers in Wisconsin 
say they have successfully grown cells with the ability to become 
any kind of cell at all. And that could lead to treatments for countless 
diseases. Elizabeth Cohen explains. Imagine if, in a laboratory, scientists 
could create all sorts of human cells -- heart cells -- to repair 
damage from a heart attack. Liver cells to treat hepatitis. Red blood 
cells for cancer patients. While it's still a medical fantasy, scientists 
this week announced they've made a major step forward. Here's what 
they did. They took a sperm from a man and an egg from a woman. The 
egg and sperm grew in a Petri dish for several days until they became 
a Ball of cells called a blastocyst. The researchers then took special 
cells from within the blastocyst and cultured them, producing what 
are called human stem cells. Stem cells are blank cells that can develop 
into virtually any cell in the human body. Scientists don't know how 
to customize these blank stem cells into brain cells or heart cells 
or any other specific cell. That's the next step. And then eventually, 
way down the road, researchers think perhaps they could even grow 
entire organs. But first there are a number of ethical considerations. 
Number one -- where did they get the egg and sperm in the first place? 
In one experiment, they asked couples who had undergone artificial 
insemination for permission to use eggs and sperm they no longer needed. 
Scientists then put the eggs and sperm together in the laboratory. 
But in another experiment, researchers used cells from aborted fetuses. 
The second ethical concern -- can scientists screen the egg and sperm 
for diseases 100%? I don't think there's a practical way to test these 
cells for every genetic condition there is, at least at this time. 
And lastly, how do you regulate this kind of new technology? These 
studies used no federal funds. Of course, if the government is not 
funding it, it has minimal amounts of say about what goes on. The 
Geron corporation, a biotech firm in Menlo park, California, paid 
for the research. The company expects it will take another five or 
ten more years of research until the stem cells become medical cures.
