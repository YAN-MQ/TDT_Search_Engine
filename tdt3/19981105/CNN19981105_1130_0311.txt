Voter turnout in Tuesday's elections was average or slightly below 
average. Analysts estimate 36% or 37% of the voting-age population 
cast ballots compared to 38.4% in the 1994 midterm elections. Official 
numbers won't be available for weeks after absentee and write-in ballots 
are certified. High African-American voter turnout and lack of a clear 
republican message are credited with helping democrats make narrow 
gains.
