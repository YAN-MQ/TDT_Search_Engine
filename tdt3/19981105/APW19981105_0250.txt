Disgruntled high school students were planning a third round of nationwide 
marches Thursday in what was seen as a test of their fledgling movement, 
which last month drew hundreds of thousands of protesters. Demonstrations 
were set for the cities of Bordeaux, Toulon, Saint-Brieuc, Toulouse, 
Nice, and Lyon as well as Paris. Meetings and sit-ins were planned 
in high schools throughout the country. The students are protesting 
overcrowded classrooms, outmoded equipment, a lack of teachers and 
other conditions they say leave them badly prepared for the future. 
Following last month's protests, Education Minister Claude Allegre 
announced the addition of thousands of new teachers and assistants. 
But many students remain skeptical that the Education Ministry's plans, 
which also called for new equipment and a lighter work load, are sufficient 
to improve conditions. Last month's protests disintegrated into violent 
rock-throwing demonstrations, resulting in injuries and property damage. 
Much of the violence was caused by youths from troubled suburbs who 
were not connected to the protests. Anticipating further violence, 
French police announced plans for tight security in the capital Thursday. 
They banned street parking as of Wednesday evening and urged merchants 
to shutter their shops along the planned march route from the Montparnasse 
train station to the Education Ministry.
