House Judiciary committee chairman Henry Hyde says he wants to put 
the impeachment inquiry against President Clinton on the fast track. 
Hyde announced today independent counsel Ken Starr will be his only 
major witness when the hearing begins November 19th. But he says he 
reserves the right to call additional people to testify, if needed. 
Hyde has sent Mr. Clinton a letter asking him to admit or deny certain 
allegations that were included in Starr's report to Congress. Hyde 
says he hopes to wrap up the inquiry by the end of the year. We don't 
have to parade a lot of witnesses to repeat what they already said 
under oath. I want to cut to the chase, and I think we can. This procedure 
I'd like to cut to the chase on everything we do. Not just this. I 
think we can. President Clinton says Tuesday's election results show 
the American people want the hearings wrapped up as soon as possible. 
I want these hearings to be constitutional, fair and expeditious. 
And at the appropriate time, in the appropriate way, we will say whatever 
we intend to say. But I have nothing to say about it. I think the 
important thing is that we've got to go back and do the people's business. 
The American people sent us a message that would break the eardrums 
of anyone that was listening. They want their business tended to.
