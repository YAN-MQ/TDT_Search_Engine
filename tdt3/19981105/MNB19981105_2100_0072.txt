First tonight, a very familiar scene playing out at the Pentagon tonight. 
This one this time no less urgent or potentially dangerous. There 
are problems once again with Iraq. Another fight with the U.N. over 
its refusal to allow inspections. And tonight we have a late report 
from the Pentagon that plans are being readied for yet another military 
strike if it should come to that. Before we talk to a military analyst 
on what plans are being drawn up, the latest from the defense department 
this evening. Here is Jim Miklaszewski. Pentagon sources tell NBC 
news the attack plan is done. And air strikes against Iraq could be 
launched as a moment's notice. The U.S. military already has sufficient 
forces in the Persian gulf for the first wave of air strikes. Cruise 
missiles launched from a half dozen ships and a submarine. Air force 
B-1 and F-117 stealth bombers could be used in followup strikes. All 
it a would take is the order from President Clinton who warned today 
that military action against Iraq is very much a live option. We believe 
we'll have the support we need. The latest standoff began when Saddam 
Hussein again stopped U.N. inspections in Baghdad, demanding sanctions 
be lifted. But U.S. officials warn those inspections are critical 
in keeping a lid on iraq's chemical and biological weapons programs. 
As long as the inspectors are not able to do their jobs, there is 
a good opportunity that Saddam Hussein is taking action to reconstitute 
his weapons. Defense secretary William Cohen has been on a whirlwind 
tour of the gulf region to whip up support for air strikes. And national 
security advisor Sandy Berger will meet with his European counterparts 
in Paris Saturday to consider the military option. Barring any last-minute 
reversal by Saddam Hussein, President Clinton could give the order 
for military action any time after Berger returns to washington this 
weekend clearing the way for air strikes any time after that. Jim 
Miklaszewski, NBC news.
