With Real Madrid at the top of the Spanish first division, two other 
clubs, Mallorca and FC Barcelona, are fighting for a chance to oust 
it this week. After a hectic week of Europe competition, the Spanish 
clubs are concentrating their efforts again in the domestic league 
eager to make a run at Madrid. Mallorca and Barcelona both have 16 
points, just one less than Real, although Mallorca has the edge on 
goal difference. On Sunday, Barcelona, the defending first division 
champions, will need to defeat Oviedo in order to recuperate prestige 
lost after going down 2-1 against Bayern Munich 2-1 on Wednesday in 
the European Champions League, a defeat that left the Catalan side 
almost out of the competition. Mallorca, meanwhile, was to face Belgium's 
Genk in the Cup Winners Cup later Thursday before meeting lowly Villareal 
Sunday in the Spanish Primera's ninth round. Real Madrid was also 
scheduled to play its European Champions League game against Austria's 
Sturm Graz after the game was suspended Wednesday because of rain. 
On Sunday, the side has an apparently easy bout against weak first-division 
newcomer Alaves. Last week it thrashed fellow newcomer Extremadura 
5-1 to take the league's top spot. Led by top scorer Raul Gonzalez 
with six goals, Madrid's record so far this season is five victories, 
two draws and one defeat, although its players have been sharply criticized 
for their scrappy play and poor defense. Meanwhile, Madrid's cross-town 
rival, Atletico de Madrid, currently in fifth place with 13 points, 
appears to be playing better than a month ago but catching Real won't 
be easy. Atletico comes off a 1-0 win over CSKA Sofia this week in 
the UEFA cup and will try to repeat the victory Sunday when it hosts 
No. 7 Deportivo de La Coruna. In Saturday's only game, Espanyol welcomes 
16th-placed Betis. Despite a dismal start this season, Betis is the 
clear favorite this weekend as it looks to build on a two-game winning 
streak since former national coach Javier Clemente took over a week 
ago. It's most recent feat was a 3-0 victory Tuesday in the UEFA Cup 
against Dutch side Willem II. In other games Sunday: Tenerife receives 
Valladolid, Real Sociedad meets Athletic de Bilbao, Salamanca hosts 
Zaragoza, Valencia welcomes Racing de Santander and Celta faces Extremadura.
