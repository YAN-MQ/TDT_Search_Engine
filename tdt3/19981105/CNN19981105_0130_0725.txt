Some top models bared it all Wednesday to launch a new anti-fur campaign 
by "People for the ethical treatment of animals." In Times Square, 
they piled into a king-sized bed shouting anti-fur slogans. The event 
was designed to target people attending New York City's fashion week. 
A print version of the "fur out, love in" campaign will run worldwide 
this winter.
