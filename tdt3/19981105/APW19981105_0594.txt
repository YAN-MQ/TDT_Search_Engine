France will supply the most troops for a new military force to protect 
civilian verifiers who run into trouble while ensuring that the peace 
deal in Kosovo is observed, top French officials said Thurday. French 
Defense Minister Alain Richard said France would provide up to half 
of the future force, which will consist of 1,200 to 1,800 members, 
and will be backed by helicopters and tanks based in neighboring Macedonia. 
The purpose of the extraction force is to protect the 2,000 unarmed 
civilian ground verifiers being deployed in Kosovo under the direction 
of the 54-nation Organization for Security and Cooperation in Europe. 
Four or five European nations will take part in the force, but it 
was not yet clear whether the United States would participate. At 
this point, Russia does not plan to join the effort. Richard and Foreign 
Minister Hubert Vedrine, speaking at a joint news conference, stressed 
the military mission carried risks given the explosive nature of the 
conflict, the terrain, and the weakness of ground intelligence. The 
rules of engagement for the military force are currently being worked 
out by NATO, Richard said. He said the verifiers would be able to 
call upon the force in case of danger. Helicopters would be able to 
reach the verifiers within an hour, while it would take at least half 
a day for troops in tanks to come to their assistance, Richard said. 
As part of an agreement reached by U.S. negotiator Richard Holbrooke 
on Oct. 12 with Yugoslav President Slobodan Milosevic, about 2,000 
verifiers are being sent to Kosovo, a southern province of Yugoslavia, 
to ensure that Milosevic makes good on his pledge to withdraw troops 
and police from the area. Vedrine criticized remarks made recently 
by Holbrooke which indicated the United States believed that intervention 
could be taken in the Balkans without a resolution by the United Nations. 
The French diplomat said it was U.N. resolutions which helped define 
the mission in the Balkans, and gave the mission its legal force.
