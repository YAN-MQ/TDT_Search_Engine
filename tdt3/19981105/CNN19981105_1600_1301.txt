First up, college basketball. The NCAA today placed the University 
of Cincinnati mens basketball program on two years probation for violating 
a variety of rules but spared the bearcats a postseason ban. The program 
will lose three scholarships over a two-year period beginning in '99 
and reduction in the number of official visits. There were a lot of 
mistakes made throughout the whole course of everything that happened. 
And, you know, we've got to do the best job we possibly can of putting 
this behind us and continuing to move on.
