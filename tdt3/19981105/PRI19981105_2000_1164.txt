More from THE WORLD's fish beat still to come on THE WORLD. You're 
listening to PRI. On this week's live broadcast to "A Prairie Home 
Companion," we welcome a fine Cajun band, Balfa tu jour. We'll hear 
some slide guitar from blues man Roy Rogers, and, of course, the news 
from your friends in Lake Woebegone. Join Garrison Keeler for "A Prairie 
Home Companion" Saturday evening at, with repeats Sunday afternoon 
at 3:00 and Sunday night at midnight on 91 fm, whyy. I'm Dan Gottlieb, 
and on the next "Voices in the Family," a visit to Temple Hospital's 
cardiac care unit where patients are waiting for a new heart. I'm 
hoping for a bright future, a happy future, but, you know, if it doesn't 
happen, then I'll deal with that. I'll cry, you know, but then I get 
over it, and I just look to the future. That's Sunday morning at here 
on 91 FM, WHYY.
