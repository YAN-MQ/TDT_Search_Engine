David Cone said he would have preferred to be talking about Lou Gehrig's 
disease. And Thursday night, he was on his way to fulfill a decade-old 
promise to a Long Island Little League organization. But Cone knew 
the question on everyone's mind during a busy day of appearances Thursday. 
And that was simply this: Was he going to re-sign with the Yankees 
or go elsewhere? ``Obviously, my preference is to stay,'' Cone said 
Thursday at a midtown fund-raiser for the Amyotrophic Lateral Sclerosis 
Association. ``There is no place I'd rather play. We've extended the 
deadline twice. I'm hopeful we'll be able to get this done. And hopefully, 
I'll end my career right here.'' The 35-year-old right-hander, who 
won 20 games for the World Series champions this past season, said 
he was ``bending over backwards'' to try to get something done that 
would keep him a Yankee. ``We've talked about restructuring the set-up 
of a deal with no incentives kicking in,'' Cone said. ``We've talked 
about one year and we've talked about two years. But we really haven't 
gotten into depth. It's not really the money. It's more the structure 
of the deal. Whether it's for one year or two, whether there's an 
option, and how the option kicks in.'' On Wednesday, for the second 
time in the last week, Cone and the Yankees agreed to extend the deadline 
hanging over his head. So Cone now has until next Wednesday to again 
decide whether to accept a $5.5 million contract option for 1999, 
or to see if he and the Yankees can agree on a more attractive deal 
by then. Cone qualified for the 1999 option by pitching more than 
200 innings last season. And if Cone were to accept the 1999 option, 
he would also have a $5.5 million option for the year 2000 _ if he 
pitches 192 1/3 innings in 1999. But that, said the pitcher who has 
undergone arm surgery twice in the last three years, is actually an 
incentive he could do without. For Cone, it was a way of acknowledging 
that after all the mileage he has put on his pitching arm and all 
the durability he has displayed in the last dozen years in the majors, 
he cannot be quite sure how many innings a game he could pitch in 
the future. And while he continued to negotiate with the Yankees, 
he also filed Thursday for a provisional free agency, which he will 
only exercise if he and the Yankees ultimately cannot agree on a deal. 
Cone is believed to be asking the Yankees for $16 million over two 
guaranteed years, a figure his agent, Steve Fehr, would neither confirm 
nor deny Thursday. The Yankees are believed to be more inclined to 
offer one year at $7 million because of the questions they have about 
how much Cone has left. ``We may just talk about one year,'' Cone 
said. ``But I'd like two or three years. And I'd like to get rid of 
the 200-innings deal. I don't want it to become an issue again. If 
I need to miss a start in September, I'd like to go ahead and be able 
to do it. Last year, I was in a position to win 20 games. But I was 
also looking at 200 innings. And it was certainly in my mind.'' ``How 
much I have left is a valid question,'' added Cone, who will turn 
36 in January. ``But I'd like to think that I can pitch a couple, 
maybe even three, more years.'' And if not with the Yankees, then 
perhaps somewhere else. An interesting development could occur if 
the Mets ever show interest. As for now, both of the Mets' owners 
_ Fred Wilpon and Nelson Doubleday _ have indicated an unwillingness 
to bid for Cone or Bernie Williams, the Yankees' free-agent center 
fielder, apparently because they do not want to start a war with the 
Yankees' owner, George Steinbrenner. But Cone wants to remain in New 
York. And friends of Cone's have said in the past that he would not 
be against re-signing with the Mets, the team on which he first emerged 
as a major league star. It was in the winter of 1987, after Cone's 
5-6 rookie season with the Mets, that he appeared at a banquet for 
the Rockville Centre Little League and took a $1,000 appearance fee 
_ ``I needed the money,'' Cone said with a smile _ promising that 
if he ever became a star he would appear at another of the league's 
banquets for free. And so, 11 years later, that was what Cone was 
preparing to do Thursday night, unbeknownst to the Little Leaguers. 
Meanwhile, he could not resist responding to his rambunctious teammate, 
David Wells, who joked the other day that Cone might find himself 
missing a couple of teeth if he does not re-sign with the Yankees. 
``He probably will take a shot at me,'' Cone said of Wells. ``But 
I did my part to keep him out of jail all year. I think that's the 
main reason the Yankees want to bring me back.''
