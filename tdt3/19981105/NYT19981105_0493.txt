After devastating Honduras and Nicaragua as a hurricane, the tropical 
storm struck Florida on Wednesday night, causing only moderate damage 
as the fast-moving system crossed the state in less than 24 hours. 
Still, the storm, called Mitch, whipped up 55 mph winds, dumped at 
least three inches of rain and spawned several tornadoes in South 
Florida. The Florida Keys, which were still recovering from the effects 
of Hurricane Georges less than two months ago, suffered the brunt 
of the damage. In the upper Keys, Mitch's winds knocked over trees 
and power lines and yanked off parts of roofs, causing the most destruction 
to mobile homes in Key Largo. About 12,000 people lost electricity; 
the local electric company, The Florida Keys Co-op, was restoring 
power Thursday. Farther north, about 60,000 residents in Dade and 
Broward counties suffered power failures. About 20 people sustained 
minor injuries, local officials reported. By 4 p.m. Thursday, with 
rains and winds considerably calmed, the National Hurricane Center 
in Miami issued its last advisory on the once-deadly storm that meteorologists 
had watched closely for almost two weeks. It had moved off the east 
coast of Florida and was about 100 miles northeast of Little Abaco 
Island in the Bahamas.
