first -- one of the leaders of the republican revolution may now be 
in a dogfight for his political future. Republican sources in the 
house tell CNN, Newt Gingrich has been warned that members of his 
own party are dissatisfied with him following the GOP's disappointing 
showing in Tuesday's midterm elections. Sources say talk of removing 
him is intensifying. Gingrich, for one, admits he miscalculated by 
thinking the GOP would benefit from the Monica Lewinsky matter. I 
totally underestimated the intensity of the modern media. I totally 
underestimated the degree to which people would just get sick of 24 
hour a day talk television and talk radio and the degree to which 
this scandal became disgusting by sheer repetition. That was totally 
unlike the experience I had lived through in 1974. And I think we 
underestimated how tired people would get. Gingrich is dismissing 
challenges to his post and says he will take responsibility for the 
GOP's poor showing. One political expert says that may not be enough. 
Well, I think he's in real trouble tonight. I think this was seen 
to be coming, that if he didn't do well in this election, he was going 
to face the same forces that tried to knock him off last time. Last 
time, the moderates saved him. This time, it looks like the moderates 
and the conservatives have reasons to be angry at him. And I think 
you'll see a consensus candidate emerge, perhaps a woman, perhaps 
someone like Steve Largent.
