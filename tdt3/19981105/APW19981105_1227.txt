With his Cabinet debating the latest Mideast peace accord, Prime Minister 
Benjamin Netanyahu assured skeptical hard-liners Thursday he would 
walk away from the deal if he feels the Palestinians are not keeping 
their commitments. After several delays, Netanyahu's Cabinet met for 
over 13 hours Thursday to approve the land-for-peace agreement with 
the Palestinians. Netanyahu's office said the cabinet would reconvene 
Friday at 9:00 am (0700 gmt) to continue debating the accord. Netanyahu 
said he was confident the 17 ministers would ratify the accord, despite 
the vocal opposition of at least four and the indecision of several 
others. Leaks from, 4th graf pvs.
