Saudi millionaire Osama Benlauden has officially been charged by U.S. 
government prosecutors with the deadly U.S. Embassy bombings in Kenya 
and Tanzania. The indictment cites the Saudi-born terrorist with 224 
counts of murder in the August 7 bombings. As VOA's Elaine Johenson 
reports, the arrest warrant is backed up by a multi-million dollar 
reward. Three suspects had already been charged in the Embassy bombings. 
This latest indictment is considered the big one. Osama Benlauden 
is the alleged mastermind and financier of the attacks in Africa. 
He is also charged with conspiracy to murder Americans. A reference 
to his alleged leadership of the terrorist group Alkada. U.S. authorities 
have linked Mr. Benlauden to terrorist activities over the past seven 
years. Including targeting American soldiers serving with a U.N. operation 
in Somalia. These new charges link Mr. Benlauden directly to the August 
Embassy bombings in Africa. U.S. Attorney Mary Jo White announced 
the charges. A superseding indictment charges Osama Benlauden, the 
alleged mir, or leader, of the international terrorist organization 
Alkada. And Mohammed Atif, the alleged military commander of Alkada 
with murdering at least 224 civilians in the bombings of the U.S. 
Embassies on August 7, 1998, in Nairobi, Kenya; and Indar Escelon, 
Tanzania. Osama Benlauden remains a fugitive. Some believe he may 
be in Afghanistan. The U.S. State Department has offered a $5 million 
reward for information leading to his arrest. U.S. Attorney Mary Jo 
White calls the August attacks "the most heinous acts of violence 
ever committed against U.S. diplomatic posts." She signaled there 
may be more suspects in the terror network, and more indictments to 
come. This investigation is one that is not only continuing and worldwide, 
as we've said. But one that we expect to continue for quite some time. 
Until all others are charged. Osama Benlauden and his military commander 
face life in prison if convicted. Or possibly, a death sentence. Elaine 
Johenson, VOA News, New York.
