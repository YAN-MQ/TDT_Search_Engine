Some political analysts say the midterm election results could be 
seen as an unofficial runoff to the 2000 presidential campaign. John 
king takes a look at the contenders. The vice president is at center 
stage as election '98 gives way to campaign 2000. And Al Gore is hardly 
alone in trying to assess the new political landscape. Dick Gephardt's 
stock among fellow democrats is sky high because of tuesday's results. 
But being within striking distance of being the house speaker, makes 
his decision about running for president more difficult. In my humble 
opinion, we are now on an unalterable path to taking back the house 
in the year 2000. Steve Forbes, Lamar Alexander, Dan Quayle and others 
say the GOP suffered at the polls Tuesday because the republican Congress 
failed to deliver on tax cuts and other conservative promises. I think 
the message of the election returns this morning is that conservatives 
and republicans cannot win elections that end up being about nothing. 
Tuesday's winners included the early republican presidential front-runner. 
And so the campaign has ended. And now it's time to get back to work. 
The Texas governor with a famous name can afford to be coy, he won 
re-election in a landslide and can easily raise the $20 million or 
more necessary for a White House run. This early debate about campaign 
2000 isn't limited to Washington. CNN has learned that nearly two 
dozen prominent conservative activists in iowa will gather this Saturday 
to see if they can maximize their clout in presidential politics by 
rallying around one republican candidate. John king, CNN, the White 
House.
