Determining an accurate casualty count from Hurricane Mitch has been 
complicated because of downed communications links, duplicate reporting 
of victims, shifting populations and the general confusion surrounding 
an international disaster. As the storm hovered over Honduras for 
five days last week, officials said dozens, then hundreds, then possibly 
2,000 had died in widespread flooding. That estimate rocketed to as 
high as 7,000 but was based on reports from multiple and sometimes 
duplicate sources, including local mayors, radio stations and army 
helicopter crews. Government Minister Delmer Urbizo said Thursday 
that 6,076 Hondurans had died. The number of missing had been estimated 
at 11,000 but was lowered to 4,621 on Thursday. The government lowered 
its number of homeless from 1 million to 569,007. The movement of 
people escaping flooding and moving into and out of shelters made 
a precise count impossible, officials said. Meanwhile, Nicaragua's 
death toll climbed Thursday from an estimated 2,400 to 4,000, Nicaraguan 
President Arnoldo Aleman told the Mexican television network Televisa. 
El Salvador's numbers remained the same: 239 dead and 135 missing. 
Guatemala said it had 194 dead and an unknown number of people missing. 
When a precise death count can be made is unknown. In Mexico City, 
there still is uncertainty over how many died in the 1985 earthquake: 
The government has said 6,000 killed, while unofficial estimates put 
the number at 9,500 or more. An engineering firm was helping Honduras' 
Ministry of Government create a computer database to compile more 
reliable statistics based on reports from the military, the Red Cross, 
non-governmental agencies, and state and local officials. The amount 
of information has increased as telephone lines and access to remote 
towns is restored, but some areas have yet to be reached, and searches 
continue for more victims. Reporting from hard-hit capital of Honduras, 
Tegucigalpa, also was affected by the death in a helicopter crash 
of Mayor Cesar Armando Castellanos, which provoked confusion in an 
already-overwhelmed municipal government.
