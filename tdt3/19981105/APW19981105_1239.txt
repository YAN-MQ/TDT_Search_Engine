A former top Cali cocaine boss was assassinated while watching a soccer 
game in a prison yard Thursday, two years after he surrendered and 
began fingering ex-associates. Helmer ``Pacho'' Herrera was shot at 
least five times in the face by a man who gained entry to the Palmira 
prison outside Cali by claiming to be a lawyer for another inmate, 
officials said. Herrera, 47, had been the No. 3 man in the Cali cartel, 
one of the world's biggest criminal organizations, and had set up 
and managed cocaine distribution rings in major U.S. cities, beginning 
in the 1980s. The assailant appeared to be ``an acquaintance of Herrera 
because he greeted him first,'' national police spokesman Carlos Perdomo 
said. Herrera died on the way to the hospital, emergency room director 
Dr. Gustavo Paredes said. The assassin, identified as Rafael Angel 
Uribe, 32, was beaten by other inmates before guards took him away. 
He had entered the prison a half hour before the attack, apparently 
while Herrera was playing in the game's first half, national prisons 
director Carmen Lucia Tristancho said. She said it was unclear whether 
the murder weapon, a 9mm pistol, was smuggled into the penitentiary 
or whether it was already inside. Herrera surrendered to authorities 
in September 1996, the last of seven major cartel members to either 
turn themselves in or be arrested. He was convicted of drug trafficking 
in March and sentenced to six years and eight months in prison after 
incriminating at least 20 former associates. Herrera continued to 
seek sentence reductions, fingering his wheelchair-bound half-brother 
from jail. But in September, his prison term was increased to 14 years 
and eight months, following an appeal by prosecutors. When he surrendered, 
Herrera said he was tired of being on the run from enemies and thought 
he would be safer behind bars. Known as a man with a thousand faces, 
he had dodged hundreds of police raids, even dressing up as a woman 
to elude authorities. A decade ago, Herrera played a key role in the 
Cali cartel's secret alliance with the government to wipe out the 
more violent Medellin drug gang. His lawyer, Gustavo Salazar, said 
Thursday the killing could have been related to that rivalry. Herrera 
was believed responsible for a 1988 car bomb attack on a building 
where the family of the late Medellin drug boss Pablo Escobar was 
living. The family escaped unhurt. He survived a September 1990 raid 
by Medellin cartel hit men on a ranch he owned outside Cali in which 
19 people were killed. In the 1980s, Herrera directed cocaine distribution 
and money-laundering in the New York City area for the cartel, which 
at its peak exported about 80 percent of the cocaine sold in the United 
States, according to the U.S. Drug Enforcement Administration. Gaining 
a reputation as a deft money-launderer, Herrera had by 1990 established 
his own family-run cocaine trafficking business and set up and maintained 
cocaine distribution networks in Los Angeles, Houston and Miami, the 
DEA says. The United States made a formal extradition request for 
Herrera in July 1996, but Colombian law forbade his extradition. Herrera 
is the second leading member of the Cali cartel killed since 1995, 
when police captured the organization's top leaders, Gilberto and 
Miguel Rodriguez Orejuela. Both are currently serving jail terms. 
Jose Santacruz Londono, another top cartel boss, was killed by police 
in March 1996 after escaping from prison.
