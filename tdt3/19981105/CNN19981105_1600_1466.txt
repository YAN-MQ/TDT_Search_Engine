The creator of the "batman" comic series, Bob kane, is dead. His attorney 
says the 83-year-old kane died of natural causes. It was 1939 when 
"batman & Robin" first appeared in print. The characters and their 
enemies, including the riddler, the joker and Mr. freeze, were turned 
into a TV show in the 1960s and a hit movie series in recent years. 
Kane worked as a creative consultant on all the "batman" movies.
