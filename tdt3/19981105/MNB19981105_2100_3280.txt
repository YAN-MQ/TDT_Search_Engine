When we come back, a look at what's in tomorrow's papers. And who's 
making sure business has the latest technology? Like the Intel Pentium 
II xeon processor in a custom-built server. Plus a desktop and laptop. 
And who does all that one customer at a time? Gateway. So give us 
a call. Brought to you by Maxwell house. As long as little boys want 
to grow up to be just like their dads... you're a coffee lover, aren't 
you? As long as we never forget who we are... and where we came from... 
just as long as the road always leads home, Maxwell house will always 
be good to the last drop. Quick look at the morning's paper. Our canvass

on front pages. "The Miami Herald," a big story from Health? ? n: 
Lycos, go get it. Unleash the new lycos and no matter what you're 
looking to retrieve from the Internet lycos will Hunt it down quicker 
and easier. Lycos... go get it. All right.
