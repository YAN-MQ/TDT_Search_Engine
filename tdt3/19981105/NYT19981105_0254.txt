Todd Haynes' dazzlingly surreal ``Velvet Goldmine'' offers a celestial 
``Here's looking at you, kid'' to the heyday of British glitter rock 
in general and to the David Bowie of the early 1970s in particular. 
Without addressing Bowie directly, it appropriates his shimmering, 
protean aura in virtuoso ways that put ordinary period filmmaking 
or time-capsule musicology to shame. The astounding Haynes, whose 
last film (``Safe'') took place on an entirely different planet from 
this one, brilliantly re-imagines the glam-rock '70s as a brave new 
world of electrifying theatricality and sexual possibility, to the 
point where identifying precise figures in this neo-psychedelic landscape 
is almost beside the point. ``Velvet Goldmine'' tells a story the 
way operas do: blazing with exquisite yet abstract passions, and with 
quite a lot to look at on the side. Structured as a rock ``Citizen 
Kane'' with an extraterrestrial Rosebud, ``Velvet Goldmine'' traces 
its tendrils back to Oscar Wilde, whom it imagines as a schoolboy. 
(``I want to be a pop idol,'' this child sweetly announces.) A century 
later, the Wildean spirit of flamboyance is spectacularly reborn, 
ready to erupt into the glittery, pansexual pop utopia over which 
Bowie so dramatically presided. The film doesn't force its musical 
references on audiences, but it evokes them with vast fondness and 
fascination. ``People have certain memories that they hold very dear, 
so you want to remain true to them,'' Christine Vachon, the film's 
audacious producer, has explained. Out of the wild Ken Russellish 
phantasmagoria of ``Velvet Goldmine'' several essential characters 
emerge, central among them the Bowiesque Brian Slade. Played by Jonathan 
Rhys Meyers as a stunningly pretty, insolent, snake-hipped presence, 
he embodies the provocative and mysterious heart of the film. Haynes, 
cerebral as ever despite this film's explosion of visual sensuality, 
surrounds Slade with implicit questions about art and inspiration, 
truth and honesty, passion and repression. Playing what he has rightly 
called ``a birthday present of a part,'' Ewan McGregor makes a fabulously 
charismatic rock star named Curt Wild, who is both reproach and object 
of fascination for Brian Slade. Whatever else he may be, McGregor's 
often hilariously decadent Curt Wild is the real thing. With typically 
wicked wit, the film mentions that Curt underwent early shock treatments 
``to fry the fairy clean out of him'' and that the net effect of this 
was ``to make him bonkers every time he heard an electric guitar.'' 
In a film that has at least one more major character than it needs, 
and that like ``Safe'' overworks its elusiveness in ways sure to confound 
some audiences, Christian Bale plays the journalist a la ``Kane'' 
who investigates Brian Slade from the chilly distance of 1984. That 
period is rendered no less fancifully than the film's rainbow days, 
as Bale's doleful Arthur Stuart reaches out from his dreary present 
to a past that both entices and humiliates him. Arthur, the fan who 
is forever linked to Curt Wild, conveys all the wistful distance of 
what it means to see the events here from the outside, looking in.
