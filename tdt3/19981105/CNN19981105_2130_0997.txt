Federal reserve chairman Alan Greenspan isn't giving any hints about 
whether that will happen this month. He addressed the securities industry 
association annual convention today in florida. While he wouldn't 
comment on the fed's plans, he did say he believes investor panic 
over the global financial situation is lessening. It is of course 
plausible that the current episode of investor fright will dissipate 
and yield spreads and liquidity premiums will soon fall into more 
normal ranges. Indeed, we are already seeing significant signs of 
some reversals. The fed meets again on November 17th.
