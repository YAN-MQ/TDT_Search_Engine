NATIONAL FORECAST Snow will accumulate on the high Plains from western 
Nebraska to the western Dakotas and along the Front Range of the Rockies 
from northern Colorado to Montana as a developing low pressure system 
draws moist air from the southeast up the sloping terrain. Moreover, 
moist air will cool on ascent, setting the stage for snowfalls of 
6 inches or more in some areas, with the heaviest snow falling mainly 
on the highest east-facing slopes. Farther south, scattered showers 
and spotty drizzle will dampen the region from west Texas to western 
Kansas. Isolated thunderstorms may develop later in the day across 
south Texas as moist air from the Gulf of Mexico increases over the 
region. Meanwhile, coastal rains and mountain snows will develop in 
the Pacific Northwest from northern California to western Washington 
as a cold, upper-level low pressure system arrives from the Gulf of 
Alaska. With the remnants of Tropical Storm Mitch racing northeast 
across the Atlantic Friday, waterlogged areas in south Florida, which 
were deluged by as much as 8 inches of rain from Wednesday to early 
Thursday, will rapidly dry out under ample sunshine. Mostly cloudy, 
chilly weather will persist from the Great Lakes to the Appalachians 
Friday as Canadian air is moistened in transit across tepid waters 
and then forced to rise over land. Splotches of light snow or drizzle 
will prevail downwind of the southern and eastern shores. Winds from 
the northwest will dry on descent from the mountains, bringing partial 
sunshine to parts of the Northeast Seaboard. FOCUS: SEA OF CLOUDS 
Low clouds hovered over much of the Great Lakes region Thursday. Cumulatively, 
the Great Lakes act like an inland sea during the cold season, helping 
to produce clouds downwind of eastern and southern shores whenever 
invading Canadian air is moistened during transit over relatively 
warm waters. On Friday, low clouds will persist over much of the Great 
Lakes region, particularly the eastern Great Lakes, as cold air continues 
to filter south. In addition, broken bands of snow showers and snow 
flurries will develop, one of the first installments in the upcoming 
season of lake-effect snows.
