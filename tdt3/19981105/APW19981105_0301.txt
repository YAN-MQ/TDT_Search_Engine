Thai men who smoke may have shrugged off threats of heart and lung 
disease, but a new warning appearing Thursday on cigarette packets 
should grab their attention _ ``Smoking Causes Impotence.'' However, 
not everyone believes it. ``I've been smoking for 20 years, and my 
sex life is fine,'' said Somboon Thonglee, 35, a taxi driver. ``I 
have two kids and one on the way to prove it. Unless the government 
is slipping something we don't know about into the cigarettes, I'm 
not worried.'' One government branch, the Thai Tobacco Monopoly, is 
obliged to obey the regulations of another, the Health Ministry, in 
printing warnings on the packs of the 16 brands of cigarettes it makes. 
So are foreign tobacco companies exporting here. The impotence warning 
is the latest of 10 that are required to be rotated after every 5,000 
packs. The other nine stress concerns ranging from ``Cigarettes Affect 
Passive Smokers'' to ``Smoking Leads People to Other Addictive Substances.'' 
All the warnings and studies behind each claim are weighed and decided 
by the Health Ministry. Adulvit Kitchakarn, deputy managing director 
of the Tobacco Monopoly, believes bringing sex into the picture was 
a clever move, though it could hurt sales, particularly among the 
young. ``This might just scare them away,'' Adulvit joked. Last year, 
the monopoly generated more than 30 billion baht (dlrs 830 million) 
for the government, a sizable sum as Thailand struggles to make ends 
meet amid the worst economic crisis in decades. But the state enterprise 
is stuck between two major forces _ the need to keep up a solid smoking 
customer base to justify its existence, and health authorities keen 
to get Thais, especially the younger generation, off the tobacco hook. 
Adulvit professes to be untroubled by it. ``We are not in the business 
of encouraging people to smoke,'' Adulvit said. ``We are simply providing 
a consumer product to generate money for the state. It's a global 
trend that smoking is on the decline, especially among the more developed 
countries.'' Health Ministry officials refused to comment on the new 
warning. But Dr. Prakit Vateesatogkit, a member of a government committee 
that has drafted regulations for tobacco control, said the impotence 
study was carried out by the American Council on Science and Health. 
The target of the warning, Prakit said, is actually middle-aged men, 
proportionally the higest-smoking population. More Thais are smoking 
now than 15 years ago, he said, but the overall percentage of smokers 
among the population is smaller. ``In general, sex is something every 
culture is conscious of,'' Prakit said. ``If they know that smoking 
can affect sex, it will affect their decision to smoke.'' The last 
time sex became a major concern for Thai smokers was about 15 years 
ago, when a rumor made the rounds in the impoverished northeast that 
smoking reduces the size of a man's penis, said Adulvit, who was in 
tobacco marketing research at the time. No warning to that effect 
was ever put on cigarette packets. ``We concluded that it was a combination 
of a psychological effect originating from the bad rumor, combined 
with the cool weather of the region,'' Adulvit said.
