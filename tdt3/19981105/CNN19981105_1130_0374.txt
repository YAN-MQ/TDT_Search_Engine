Some environmental activists are using harsh tactics to draw attention 
to their causes. Don Knapp reports, acrimony is growing on both sides 
of the fight. a group calling itself the earth liberation front claimed 
responsibility for a series of arson fires last month that caused 
$12 million damage to a vail, Colorado, ski resort. The group said 
they acted to protect habitat for the Canada lynx. This and other 
recent clashes over the environment seem to be driving opponents farther 
apart, polarizing communities on whose ground the battles are waged. 
Get your hands off my neck, please. That is assault! In Washington 
state, makah Indians confronted anti-whaling protesters. Tension escalated 
when the protesters came ashore, onto Indian land. One protester ended 
up in the water. Another struggled to keep her camera. Easy! Easy! 
Easy! Easy! Near Eureka, California, still another fight in the decades-old 
war over the logging of ancient red Woods. Get out of here. Protesters 
claim this video records the threats of a logger at some time before 
one activist was killed by a falling tree. Oh, . I wish I had my ing 
pistol. The incident is under investigation. Examples of tension in 
communities where people feel forced to choose between the environment 
and a host of other values, ranging from jobs to cultural tradition. 
Feelings run deep on all sides of these debates. The opponents here 
say they've given all they intend to give -- an attitude that makes 
polarization more likely than compromise. Don Knapp, CNN, humboldt 
county, California.
