Facing a big loss this year, Singapore's government-linked Keppel 
conglomerate announced Thursday it will reduce its work force by 10 
percent and sell, merge or close 50 of its 600 companies. Keppel Chairman 
Sim Kee Boon told reporters without elaboration that the group, which 
now has 9,000 workers, faces ``quite a big loss.'' He added that the 
group, which includes banking, shipyard and property development divisions 
among others, should return to profits in 1999. ``We have decided 
on severe cost-cutting measures leading to about 100 million Singapore 
dollar (dlrs 60 million) savings per year, or about 12 percent of 
the group's overhead,'' he said. The savings don't include relief 
expected to come from government measures such as a cut in mandatory 
company contribution to employees' retirement programs, he said. ``Since 
the Asian financial crisis (began) last year, few in the region have 
been spared,'' Sim said. ``For the Keppel group, it seems 1985 has 
revisited us.'' That year was the beginning of Singapore's last recession. 
As part of ``some serious spring cleaning,'' Keppel will sell, merge 
or close about 50 companies that either don't fit into the group's 
core business or have ``persistently underperformed,'' he said. ``We 
have to energetically prune and remove deadwood,'' Sim said. Among 
the companies being sold will be the regional liner shipping business 
of Keppel Telecommunication and Transportation Ltd., the U.S. leisure 
and aviation businesses of Keppel Marine Industries Ltd. as well as 
trading and general contracting businesses under Keppel Integrated 
Engineering Ltd. ``Some of these divestments will not be immediate,'' 
he said. ``We will dispose of them over time, at prices we are happy 
with. If not next year, then maybe the year after.''
