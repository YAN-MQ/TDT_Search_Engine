Calling all computer hackers -- organizers of an upcoming online security 
trade show in Singapore are challenging hackers to test programs designed 
to prevent computer infiltration. Participating companies will offer 
prizes as part of a contest that puts hackers' skills to the test. 
The companies will then use the information to strengthen their cybersecurity 
systems. Online commerce is growing rapidly in all sectors, including 
business and banking. Earlier today, IBM and Intel announced a partnership 
for online commerce security.
