We're back and continuing our conversation with Mary matalin and Joe 
scarborough. Congressman, in the tradition of house speakers, the 
likes of McCormic andal wert and O'Neil and rayburn, former seahawk 
Steve Largent? I thi it's a possibility. We have at least five people 
that have been talking about becoming speaker. I think, though, again, 
we don't need to get mired down in palace intrigue. The number we 
need to look at for the future of the speaker is six. If six republicans 
defect in January, then the speaker doesn't have a Majority and can't 
become speaker. I understand a few minutes ago Matt Sam on announced 
he would not support the speaker, so that number is down to five. 
I heard seven other people made similar commitments. It's going to 
be interesting. Whatever we do -- one thing Mary was talking about 
as far as unefying the party, we have to go outside the south. All 
we have in leader shp I White House southern males. We need to look 
to the midwest and northeast where republicans are doing great in 
governor's races but horribly on the federal level. Does Newt Hang 
on? yes. You've got 13 seconds left? yes. And for good reason. I don't 
think anyone else can say how they're going to do what Joe said we 
have to do, uni fee -- not just geographically but ideologically. 
Thank you very much. Interesting conversation tonight.
