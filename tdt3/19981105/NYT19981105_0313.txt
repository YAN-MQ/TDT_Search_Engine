Plastics were pretty dull stuff to have around the house until the 
early 1960s, when new technologies for mass production attracted the 
attention of home furnishings designers. Cued by space-age innovations 
and Pop Art, the designers _ mostly European post-modernists not unfriendly 
to kitsch _ seized on the potential of plastics for bright, tutti-frutti 
colors, appealing surfaces and sexy, rounded shapes. Some of the new 
plastic objects made their first appearance in futuristic movies, 
like ``2,001: A Space Odyssey'' and ``Soylent Green,'' warming up 
consumers to the bliss that awaited them before the products themselves 
were actually on the market. Utilitarian and sometimes playful _ like 
a 1971 coat rack of polyurethane foam in the shape of a cartoony cactus 
_ the designers' creations made light of traditional furniture, with 
its historical baggage and dust-collecting details. In fact, the material 
itself affected the esthetics of plastic objects, which could be stacked, 
easily moved and arranged in modular groupings by their purchasers. 
But the plastics carnival that began in the early 1960s was short-lived. 
By the mid-1970s, when the cost of petroleum (crucial to plastics) 
went through the roof, designers turned back to more conventional 
materials. Now this razzle-dazzle era has been reprised in ``Pop Goes 
the Plastic,'' a show at the Katonah Museum of Art in Katonah, N.Y. 
On view is just about as much as you want to see of the ``fun'' furniture, 
lighting equipment, inflatables, electronic gear, fashions, decorative 
accessories and various works of Pop Art that partook of the plastics 
revolution. The show was organized by the Atlanta International Museum 
of Art and Design, with Scott Reilly, an art historian who specializes 
in design of that era, serving as guest curator. Seating is high on 
the show's agenda. One well-known example is the inflatable armchair 
called ``Blow,'' made in 1967 by the design team of Jonathan de Pas, 
Donato d'Urbino and Paolo Lomazzi for Zanotta of Italy. Of transparent 
polyvinyl chloride (or PVC), this feather-light but grandiose plopdown 
is actually a takeoff on Eileen Gray's upholstered ``Bibendum'' chair 
of 1929, based on the puffy Michelin Man logo of the Michelin Tire 
Company. More corporeally, there is the bright red ``Tomato,'' made 
in 1971 by Eero Aarnio for Asko Oy of Finland. This plump, bulbous 
affair of glass-reinforced polyester would seem to put the sitter 
smack in the middle of an overripe tomato. Among several stackable 
chairs in the show, the cleverest is ``Cantilever,'' designed in 1960 
(but not produced until the technology became available in 1967) by 
Verner Panton for Herman Miller Co. in the United States. Jointless 
and legless, this all-of-one-piece affair with a modified ``S'' contour 
is supported solely by the cantilevered seat, which also acts as its 
base. A lovable quality of plastic furniture was its flexibility. 
Take, for example, the ``Modular Room Divider With Lighting Elements,'' 
made in translucent white by Pierluigi Spadolini and Paolo Felli for 
Kartell of Italy in 1969. It is composed of simple single and double 
cylinders in two heights, which can be arranged in a do-it-yourself 
grouping to serve as both room divider and lighting unit. Then there's 
``Baby,'' the bright red mobile cart made in 1970 by Joe Colombo for 
Bieffeplast of Italy. An elegant wheeled affair with well-orchestrated 
shelves, drawers and pockets, it could be used for anything from holding 
tools to serving tea. The ``Brick System,'' devised in 1971 by de 
Pas, d'Urbino and Lomazzi, has as its basic unit a Lego-like plastic 
brick, used to build bookcases and other kinds of storage units. Another 
multi-use item was ``Quattriquarti'' (1960), by Rodolfo Bonetto for 
Bernini of Italy: small, legged units in bright orange that could 
be used singly or grouped to form a serpentine shelf or table. In 
lighting devices, the gamut ran from ``Tatu,'' a small yellow table 
lamp shaped like a piece of industrial duct and designed by Andre 
Ricard for Metalarte of Spain in 1973, to ``KD-59,'' a robust 1980 
white floor lamp by Annig Sarian for Kartell that is nothing more 
than a bare, tapering column topped by a big round bulb. A particularly 
whimsical entry is ``Sinus'' (1972), by Ettore Sottsass for Stilnovo 
of Italy, a vertical row of bulbs that looks like a cross between 
a traffic signal and a makeup strip for an actor's dressing table. 
The electronic goods in the show _ radios, televisions, telephones, 
turntables, clocks and calculators _ were the most affected by space-age 
design, housed in curvaceous casings that echoed the shape of the 
moon and other sky bodies, with techy-looking instrument panels. The 
TR-005, a 1972 tabletop television by Panasonic cased in silver-painted 
plastic, was cued by an astronaut's helmet; so was the Weltron 2001 
portable eight-track radio of 1970. JVC's Video Capsule of 1972 was 
actually designed to look like a space re-entry capsule, with a swiveling 
flip-up screen. Panasonic's Toot-a-Loop from the same year was a bright 
red radio that curved around the wrist like a bangle. Sprinkled through 
the show are cleverly designed household accessories like bars, umbrella 
stands, wastebaskets, ashtrays, bookends, magazine racks, tableware 
and an icebucket. And the Katonah Museum has thoughtfully added a 
section devoted to fashions to the original exhibition. Its bevy of 
oufits range from a 1967 Courreges-designed ``Baby Doll'' dress of 
crinkly white organza, paved with pink satin daisies and iridescent 
plastic paillettes, to an ankle-length evening ensemble of the same 
year, with matching coat and dress in thin gold plastic. And it would 
be hard to top the shoes designed by Herbert Levine in 1967: patent 
leather, clear and silver vinyl that take the form of mini racing 
cars. It may not reflect the greatest moment in industrial design, 
but no one can say that this show fails to deliver the (ersatz) goods. 
And for those who love Toys-R-Us, the appeal will be instant. ``Pop 
Goes the Plastic'' remains at the Katonah Museum of Art, Route 22 
at Jay Street, in Katonah, N.Y., through Nov. 29.
