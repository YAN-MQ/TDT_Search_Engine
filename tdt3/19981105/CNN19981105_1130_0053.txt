The tropical storm that was hurricane Mitch is tumbling past southern 
florida. The Florida keys have been especially hard hit, with winds 
flipping mobile homes, ripping a roof off a motel and taking down 
trees and power lines. The storm is centered near Florida's east coast 
north of Jupiter, moving east-northeast at 26 miles an hour. Up to 
eight inches of rain is forecast in some areas. Maximum winds have 
increased to 65 miles an hour with higher gusts. The storm has spawned 
several tornadoes, including one in islamorada and several in key 
Largo. A tropical storm warning remains in effect for the Florida 
keys from Craig key east and for the east coast of Florida from new 
smyrna beach to flamingo.
