Sources tell CNN, independent council Ken Starr will be the primary 
witness called to testify at impeachment hearings later this month. 
But the plan relies on the White House agreeing with major points 
outlined in Starr's congressional report. The hearings are set for 
November 19th and 20th and could be wrapped up by thanksgiving. President 
Clinton has refused to talk about the proceedings. I want these hearings 
to be constitutional, fair and expeditious. And at the appropriate 
time, in the appropriate way, we will say whatever we intend to say. 
But I have nothing to say about it. I think the important thing is 
that we've got to go back and do the people's business. The American 
people sent us a message that would break the eardrums of anyone that 
was listening. They want their business tended to.
