President Clinton warns Iraq, there is international support for any 
action necessary to end the standoff over U.N. weapons inspections. 
Analysts continue to review the results of Tuesday's midterm elections 
in the United States. We'll talk to an analyst who will tell us what 
they could mean for President Clinton. A Catholic Bishop from the 
United States has called on world leaders to step up efforts to bring 
peace to Southern Sudan. The International War Crimes Tribunal is 
forced to cancel its visit to Belgrade and Kosovo. Because Yugoslavia 
refuses to issue visas for the U.N. Team. I'm Tony Riggs. And I'm 
Kent Kline. Details of those and other stories in the news are just 
ahead. Along with sports, business, and a barbershop quartet. All 
in this hour of VOA News Now. First, a summary of world news. Hi, 
I'm John Burchard, VOA News.
