Thank you, Steve. We'll have another sports update at about the same 
time next hour. And coming up on Dateline, Pam Taylor explores how 
emerging democracies can establish the rule of law. Also ahead, we'll 
look at a new drug that attacks the AIDS virus. And the life of political 
cartoonist Herb Block. I'm Kent Kline, along with Tony Riggs. Stay 
with us, as VOA News Now continues.
