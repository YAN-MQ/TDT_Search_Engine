On the other hand, just in case you have not heard this elsewhere, 
let me pass this along. I'll be leaving this program three weeks from 
Friday to return full time to my first love, sports news. Besides, 
I had to fulfill my end of the bargain with Newt Gingrich. If he'd 
quit, so will I. Keith: "the news with Brian Williams" hosted by jodi 
A legate is next. I'm Keith olbermann. We thank you. We bid you good 
night. Ready or not, here it comes. So veer weather being felt over 
a large part of the country, from north to south, it's only going 
to get worse. This is turning into a dangerous weather system. Sport 
utilities, many buy them thinking they're safer. New crash tests may 
make drivers think twice. Women's health. Who decides when a woman

hysterectomy? First Thomas Jefferson, now George Washington. New questions 
about the first president. Was he truly a founding father? Good Tuesday 
evening to you.
