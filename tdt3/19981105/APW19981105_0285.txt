Germany's record-high unemployment eased for a second consecutive 
month in October, dropping to 10.1 percent from 10.3 percent, the 
federal labor office in Nuremberg said Thursday. Nationwide, 3.89 
million people were jobless, 43,000 less than in September, when German 
unemployment dropped below 4 million for the first time in two years. 
Labor office chief Bernhard Jagoda attributed the continued improvement 
to expanded job-creation plans, especially in the five states of the 
former communist East Germany. Joblessness has been most severe in 
the east, which is still adjusting to a market economy after unifying 
with the capitalist west in 1990. Unemployment in the east remained 
almost twice that in the west: 15.7 percent in October compared to 
8.7 percent. Still, conditions in the east improved slightly more 
than in the west. About 23,000 more people in the east had jobs than 
in the previous month, compared to 20,000 in the west. The labor office 
figures were unadjusted for seasonal factors. Adjusted numbers from 
Germany's central bank, the Bundesbank, showed a higher unemployment 
rate _ 10.6 percent in October, down just one percentage point from 
its September rate. Jagoda said he expected joblessness to remain 
below 4 million, although his office said October's promising numbers 
did not yet reflect Germany's weaker economy. The office said jobs 
creation in the future could slow if global financial trouble persisted.
