The armed Basque separatist group ETA said Thursday that its current 
cease-fire could develop into a definitive renunciation of violence, 
news reports said. This transformation of the indefinite cease-fire 
announced by the separatists in mid-September into a permanent end 
to the group's bombings and shootings depended on ``progress made 
in the near future,'' ETA said in a statement published in the radical 
newspaper Euskadi Informacion, national Spanish radio reported. The 
statement followed Tuesday's announcement by Prime Minister Jose Maria 
Aznar authorizing contacts with organizations linked to the ETA. Late 
Wednesday, official government spokesman Josep Pique said the government 
was seeking direct talks with ETA ``without intermediaries.'' It was 
not immediately clear whether ETA's statement, written in the Basque 
language, was written prior to or after the governmen displayed its 
new willingness to negotiate an end to the conflict. ETA has been 
fighting for an independent Basque homeland incorporating parts of 
northern Spain and southern France for 30 years. The group, whose 
name stands for Basque Homeland and Freedom in the Basque language, 
has killed nearly 800 people.
