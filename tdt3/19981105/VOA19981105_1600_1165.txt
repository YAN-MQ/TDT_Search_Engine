In the U.S. National Football League, the Buffalo Bills have announced 
that veteran quarterback Doug Flutie will remain the starter for the 
rest of the season. The move leaves starter Rob Johnson on the sidelines 
as a backup. The Bills traded a number one draft pick to Jacksonville 
to get Johnson. And signed him to a $25 million contract. However, 
a rib injury sidelined the starter. And the Bills have now won four 
games with Flutie calling the signals. Flutie is 15 centimeters shorter 
than Johnson, and is 36 years old. However, Flutie says his stature 
has nothing to do with his ability to play the game. Everybody's an 
individual. Everybody does their own thing. It doesn't mean that a 
guy seven foot can't be quarterback. It doesn't mean a guy five foot 
can't be a quarterback. It's all up to your - the individual makes 
his life what it is. And it has nothing to do with short, tall, fast, 
skinny, thin, fat, anything. Flutie, a Heisman Trophy winner from 
Boston College, played eight seasons in Canada. He has the highest 
passing rating among American Conference starting quarterbacks.
