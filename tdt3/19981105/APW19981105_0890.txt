The Tour de France, its image badly tarnished by a doping scandal 
last year, will be shorter and less grueling next summer. But organizers 
of the prestigious cycling race, who unveiled the route for next year's 
20-stage race Thursday, emphasized that despite last year's troubles, 
``the Tour's popularity remains intact.'' The 3,680-kilometer (2,286-mile) 
race will start in Puy du Fou in central France with a short prologue 
on July 3 and will end with its traditional ride up and down the Champs-Elysees 
on July 25. The Tour, which will be about 200 kilometers (124 miles) 
shorter than last year, will also include an extra day of rest. One 
cyclist unhappy about the changes is reigning Tour de France champion 
Marco Pantani who hinted Thursday that he might pull out of the race 
next year. Pantani said he was particularly concerned that there will 
be less hill cycling at the event as of next year. Pickup 5th graf
