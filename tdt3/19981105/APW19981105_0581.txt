Germany's high unemployment eased again in October, dropping to 10.1 
percent from 10.3 percent, the federal labor office in Nuremberg said 
Thursday. Nationwide, 3.89 million people were jobless, 73,700 less 
than in September, when German unemployment dropped below 4 million 
for the first time in two years. Labor office chief Bernhard Jagoda 
attributed the continued improvement to expanded job-creation plans, 
especially in the five states of the former communist East Germany. 
Joblessness has been most severe in the east, which is still adjusting 
to a market economy after unifying with the capitalist west in 1990. 
A ``fundamental social consensus'' was needed to quickly tackle joblessness, 
Jagoda said. Unemployment in the east remained almost twice that in 
the west: 15.7 percent in October compared to 8.7 percent. Still, 
conditions in the east improved slightly more than in the west, with 
43,900 people finding jobs there, compared to the west's 29,800. The 
labor office figures were unadjusted for seasonal factors. Separately, 
seasonally adjusted numbers from Germany's central bank, the Bundesbank, 
showed a higher unemployment rate _ 10.6 percent in October, down 
minimally from 10.7 percent the month before. Jagoda said he expected 
joblessness to remain below 4 million, although his office said October's 
promising numbers did not yet reflect Germany's weaker economy. The 
office said jobs creation in the future could slow if global financial 
trouble persisted. The year's average would likely be around 4.3 million, 
instead of the 4.4 million earlier expected, he said. The opposition 
Christian Democrats claimed credit for the fresh drop in jobless figures, 
calling it ``a positive aftereffect of Helmut Kohl's government'' 
and its pro-business reforms. Peter Hintze, the party's general secretary, 
accused the new center-left government of threatening to wipe out 
the improvement by planning higher taxes on business. Gunda Roestel, 
a spokeswoman for the Greens, the ruling Social Democrats junior coalition 
partner, said 3.89 million unemployed was ``the legacy of the failed 
economic policy of the Kohl administration.'' The falling figure is 
likely to cheer the Social Democrat-led government, which has made 
fighting unemployment its key goal.
