A Catholic bishop urged world leaders on Thursday to intensify efforts 
to end the civil war in southern Sudan that has killed an estimated 
1.5 million people in 15 years. ``We call on the international community 
to focus on this conflict where millions of lives are at risk, and 
where there is the gross daily assault on human life and dignity,'' 
said Bishop John H. Ricard. Ricard, the bishop of Pensacola, Fla., 
and president of the Baltimore-based Catholic Relief Services, spoke 
to journalists in Kenya after a two-day visit to southern Sudan. Ricard 
and CRS officials, including Executive Director Kenneth F. Hackett, 
visited the towns of Rumbek and Mapuordit in the Lakes Province about 
1,000 kilometers (620 miles) southwest of Khartoum. Both towns are 
controlled by the rebel Sudan People's Liberation Army. ``In my many 
years of travel in Africa and many other parts of the world, I have 
found the conditions in the south (Sudan) are without parallel,'' 
Ricard said. CRS, one of the major private and U.N. agencies providing 
emergency food, clothes, and medical and veterinary assistance to 
southern Sudan, operates feeding centers for up to 900 malnourished 
children in Rumbek and Mapuordit. Food shortages are a persistent 
problem in southern Sudan. Rebels or government soldiers often burn 
or steal crops on which their enemies rely, causing famine. Aid workers 
estimate 1 million people are facing severe food shortages in southern 
Sudan, mainly in Bahr el-Ghazal province, north of the Lakes Province. 
Most of the needy in Rumbek and Mapuordit fled recent fighting in 
Bahr el-Ghazal. The U.N. World Food Program is dropping 9,500 tons 
of food a month into southern Sudan, the world's largest aid operation 
at the moment. The rebel SPLA has been fighting the Muslim government 
in the north since 1983 to demand more autonomy for Christians and 
animists in the south. Both sides declared a cease-fire to let international 
aid agencies work in the southern provinces. Ricard said the Vatican 
and Catholic bishops in the United States have stressed the need for 
a peaceful settlement in southern Sudan. ``It is clearly evident that 
unless there is some move toward a peaceful solution to this problem, 
many of these conditions will remain,'' Ricard said. The next round 
of peace talks between the rebels and the government was scheduled 
for February.
