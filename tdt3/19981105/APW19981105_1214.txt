The Security Council met Thursday to adopt a resolution condemning 
Iraq and demanding it resume cooperation with U.N. arms inspectors, 
but threatening no explicit force if Iraq ignores the demand. During 
speeches before the vote, France's U.N. ambassador, Alain Dejammet, 
said the only way Iraq can have sanctions lifted is if it reverses 
its decision Saturday to sever all cooperation with inspectors. ``France 
appeals to Iraq to take the opportunity that the council is ready 
to offer,'' _ a complete overview of Iraqi compliance with U.N. resolutions 
that could lead to a lifting of the oil embargo, Dejammet said. Deputy 
U.S. Ambassador Peter Burleigh, the council president, said before 
the meeting that the United States was happy with the resolution. 
``It's strong, it's forceful, it's very clear that this is a flagrant 
violation of the resolutions,'' he said.
