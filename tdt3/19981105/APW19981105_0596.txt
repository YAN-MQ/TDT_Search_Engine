Disgruntled high school students staged a third round of nationwide 
marches Thursday, but the protest _ seen as a test of their fledgling 
movement _ appeared much smaller this time. Last month, before students 
went on a weeklong vacation, hundreds of thousands of them took to 
the streets to protest overcrowded classrooms, outmoded equipment, 
a lack of teachers and other conditions they say leave them badly 
prepared for the future. Demonstrations Thursday were set for the 
cities of Bordeaux, Toulon, Saint-Brieuc, Toulouse, Nice, and Lyon 
as well as Paris. Meetings and sit-ins were planned in high schools 
throughout the country. Following last month's protests, Education 
Minister Claude Allegre announced the addition of thousands of new 
teachers and assistants. But many students remain skeptical that the 
Education Ministry's plans, which also called for new equipment and 
a lighter work load, are sufficient to improve conditions. ``We started 
something, and now we want to finish it,'' said Aline Doussin, 16, 
who marched in Paris. ``Allegre only gave us half of what we asked 
for.'' ``We won't stop our protests until we see results,'' said Guillaume 
Thfoin, 17, who goes to school in Savigny-sur-Orge south of Paris. 
``We have 35 students in every class, and that has to change.'' Last 
month's protests disintegrated into violent rock-throwing demonstrations, 
resulting in injuries and property damage. Much of the violence was 
caused by youths from troubled suburbs who were not connected to the 
protests. Anticipating further violence, French police in riot gear 
surrounded the protesters Thursday. They also banned street parking 
as of Wednesday evening and urged merchants to shutter their shops 
along the planned march route from the Montparnasse train station 
to the Education Ministry.
