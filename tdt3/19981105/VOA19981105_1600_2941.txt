We had a great day on Wall Street and the stock market. Dow Jones 
Industrial Average closing at 8915. That was up 132 points, more than 
one percent. Standard Imports 500 Index closed at 1133, and that was 
up 15 points. Stocks traded in a rather narrow range for most of the 
day. But a late surge of buying helped to push those major indexes 
to their daily highs. Analysts say a feeling of optimism continued 
on Wall Street. There was some encouragement also from the accidental 
release of the U.S. employment report. Now those figures are supposed 
to be made public Friday. But because of an error at the U.S. Bureau 
of Labor Statistics, they were posted on the computer Internet a day 
early. Now, the report shows 116 thousand new jobs were created in 
the U.S. economy last month. That was well below expectations. Some 
analysts say that could well give the U.S. Central Bank another reason 
to reduce interest rates later this month. Once again, Dow Jones Industrial 
Average closing up 132 points. This is Breck Artery.
