Forging ahead with an impeachment inquiry that most Americans say 
Congress should drop, Rep. Henry Hyde on Thursday asked President 
Clinton to say flatly whether he lied under oath, tampered with witnesses, 
or obstructed justice. In a nine-page letter, Hyde, chairman of the 
House Judiciary Committee, asked Clinton to admit or deny 81 selected 
findings gleaned from the Whitewater independent counsel's 445-page 
report on the president's affair with Monica Lewinsky. The Illinois 
Republican said the president could speed the process along by not 
disputing the findings. But many of the questions are pointed and 
ask Clinton to admit to accusations that the president and his advisers 
have strenuously denied since the independent counsel, Kenneth Starr, 
sent his scathing report to Congress. Take question No. 21, for instance: 
``Do you admit or deny that you gave false and misleading testimony 
under oath when you stated during your deposition in the case of Jones 
v. Clinton on January 17, 1998, that you did not know if Monica Lewinsky 
had been subpoenaed to testify in that case?'' Answering ``yes'' to 
questions like this, Hyde said, would help him wrap up the inquiry 
by year's end. ``The cooperation we'd like is to admit facts that 
are already, we think, established in the record. That gets us from 
here to there rather quickly.'' White House lawyers declined to comment 
Thursday night on Hyde's letter, but they are certain to balk at many 
of the conclusions drawn straight from Starr's report that they consider 
woefully biased. ``At the appropriate time, in the appropriate way, 
we will say whatever we intend to say,'' Clinton told reporters during 
a meeting with Democratic congressional leaders at the White House. 
``The important thing is that we've got to get back to doing the people's 
business.'' At a news conference in Chicago, Hyde described the letter 
to Clinton as he outlined the schedule for the inquiry against Clinton. 
Hyde on Thursday underscored his goal to wrap up the inquiry by year's 
end, announcing that the committee would likely summon only one witness, 
Starr, on Nov. 19. But the shock waves from Democratic gains in midterm 
elections have injected new doubts and uncertainty into the impeachment 
process, lawmakers said on Thursday. And any alternative to impeachment, 
such as censure, has been complicated by the leadership fight that 
has broken out among House Republicans in recriminations over Tuesday's 
debacle. Hyde said on Thursday that the election would have ``no significant 
impact'' on the impeachment proceedings.
