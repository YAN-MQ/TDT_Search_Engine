As when Leonardo DiCaprio (in ``The Man in the Iron Mask'') and Isabelle 
Adjani (in ``Queen Margot'') reigned in France, the captivating Cate 
Blanchett rules England in ``Elizabeth'' as if the monarch's principal 
responsibilities were being bejeweled, choosing consorts and saying 
``Leave us!'' with a wave of the hand. This is indeed historical drama 
for anyone whose idea of history is back issues of Vogue, but ``Elizabeth'' 
wants more. What with the religious conflicts raging around her, the 
Virgin Mary as an ultimate role model and the burden of keeping so 
many scheming advisers at bay, this Elizabeth is presented as a glamorously 
stressed-out modern woman who must cope with a super-intense case 
of having it all. That the film's Indian director, Shekhar Kapur (``Bandit 
Queen'') knew nothing about England's Queen Elizabeth I when he undertook 
this lavish costume drama only helps to make his Elizabeth that much 
sassier a sovereign, slouching on her throne. His film concerns itself 
with elaborate appearances, anachronistically modern flourishes, Roman 
Catholic-Protestant intrigue, the difficulty of resolving career with 
personal life and the small matter of Elizabethan history, pretty 
much in that order. Acknowledging the influence of ``The Godfather'' 
on a film that includes its own climactic bloodbath montage, Kapur 
and the screenwriter Michael Hirst make spectacle their priority, 
often at the expense of fact. Opening the film with an aerial shot 
of Protestant heretics being burned at the stake pretty well establishes 
that this will not be another staid royalty show. And Kapur's lusty, 
flamboyant approach does suit the young Elizabeth, who is seen as 
she ages from a blithe Botticelli Venus to the stony, regal monarch 
of the film's last scene. Ms. Blanchett, who was marvelous in ``Oscar 
and Lucinda,'' brings spirit, beauty and substance to what might otherwise 
have been turned into a vacuous role. Still, it's jarring when the 
Queen dances in the midst of admirers as if this were ``Saturday Night 
Fever'' or sounds an awful lot like Tootsie when she declares: ``I 
may be a woman, Sir William. But if I choose, I have the heart of 
a man!'' Ms. Blanchett's flouncing Elizabeth is bolstered by an impressive 
supporting cast, though the secondary characters engage in so many 
schemes that you may wish Bill, that nice new playwright from Avon, 
would drop into the film and make more sense of the dramaturgy. Short 
of invoking Shakespeare before his time (the film begins in 1554), 
``Elizabeth'' tries every conceivable way to tart up its action. Elizabeth's 
lover Lord Robert Dudley (Joseph Fiennes), who would later be stepfather 
to her lover the Earl of Essex, is seen here as an occasion for scenes 
of soft-core amour. Her wild suitor the duc d'Anjou (Vincent Cassel) 
cross-dresses, while his scheming aunt Mary of Guise (Fanny Ardant) 
demonstrates how fetching armor can look with a scarf thrown over 
one shoulder. Kathy Burke rages so vividly as Queen Mary Tudor that 
it looks as if Charles Laughton had ascended to the English throne. 
The other players, for whom a scorecard would be helpful, include 
Geoffrey Rush as the coolly calculating Sir Francis Walsingham, Elizabeth's 
trusted adviser; John Gielgud as the scheming Pope in a resolutely 
anti-Catholic drama; Christopher Eccleston as the stern Earl of Norfolk, 
and Richard Attenborough as the busybody Sir William Cecil, who tries 
to keep a watchful eye on the headstrong queen. Minor figures in this 
crowded story have names like Mary's Dwarf, Male Martyr and Bishop 
(in Cellar). Also featured prominently in ``Elizabeth'' are at least 
five castles and a cathedral, as well as Hans Holbein (the younger)'s 
famous portrait of Elizabeth's father, Henry VIII. PRODUCTION NOTES:
