Joyce Salvadori Lussu, a writer, poet and intellectual and a pioneer 
of Italian feminism and environmentalism, has died from a heart attack, 
news reports said Thursday. She was 86. The widow of Italian poet 
Emilio Lussu, she died on Wednesday in her Rome apartment, RAI state 
TV said. Born in Florence in 1912 to Italian-British parents, she 
traveled throughout Europe during the 30s and 40s as an anti-fascist. 
In Paris, in 1938, she met Lussu and joined him in the Resistance 
fight against Italian dictator Benito Mussolini's regime. They later 
settled in her family's villa on the Adriatic coast. She began her 
writings advocating attention to the environment and women's progress 
and also translated poetry. Among her publications are ``Il Libro 
delle Streghe'' (``The witches' book''), the essay ``Tradurre Poesia'' 
(``Translating Poetry'') and the recent autobiography ``Portrait.'' 
Information on survivors was not immediately available. Like her husband, 
she will be cremated.
