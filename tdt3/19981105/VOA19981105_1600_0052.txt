President Clinton is warning Iraq there is plenty of international 
support for a firm response to its refusal to cooperate with U.N. 
weapons inspectors. Mr. Clinton disputed suggestions of a lack of 
support from Persian Gulf allies for the possible use of force. The 
President said: "All options are on the table." Defense Secretary 
William Cohen has wrapped up a tour of the Gulf Arab states, where 
he reviewed possible responses to Iraq. British Foreign Secretary 
Robin Cooke says the allies have all the authorization they need for 
military action. We are quite confident that if it came to that, there 
is adequate legal bases for us to proceed. All options are open, and 
I've made that clear. Many leaders in the Gulf region have called 
for a peaceful solution.
