The national osteoporosis foundation is announcing the first guidelines 
for preventing, diagnosing and treating the bone disease in post-menopausal 
women. The guide recommends doctors counsel patients on their high 
risk of developing osteoporosis. It suggests bone Mineral tests to 
determine a woman's risk, a daily dose of calcium and vitamin D and 
strength-training exercises to reduce the risk of falls. More than 
4 million Americans have osteoporosis. 80% are post-menopausal white 
women.
