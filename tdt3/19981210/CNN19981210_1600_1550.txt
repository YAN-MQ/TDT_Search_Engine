English authorities have a mystery on their hands. They're trying 
to figure out how a man slipped past high barbed-wire fences and security 
cameras into the channel tunnel. High-speed trains travel through 
the tunnel to take people from England to france. But the unidentified 
Russian man decided to walk, dodging the trains. He almost made it, 
walking 30 miles to near the French end of the tunnel. Authorities 
arrested him.
