With a look at your "CNN Headline News Weather," I'm Karen Maginnis. 
Coming up for Friday afternoon and evening, it's going to be very 
unsettled from Texas into the lower Mississippi river valley. Some 
sections of the Texas Panhandle into Oklahoma could see a bit of snowfall 
along with some gusty winds. High pressure moves in across the interior 
west and the winds should weaken just a bit into southern California. 
Temperature wise the warmest readings can be found across the southeastern 
United States. Also into southern California and the desert southwest. 
But highs only in the 20s and 30s through the Rockies, the Great Lakes, 
also into the northeast and New England. Coming up for Saturday, mostly 
50s for the high plains but more rain and snow in the northwest and 
in the southeast. By Sunday, temperatures soar into the 70s across 
southern Arizona. 60s can be found along the gulf coast with 40s wrapped 
around the Great Lakes. By Monday, 50s and 60s dominate the central 
plains. For more weather information, you can log on to CNN.com.
