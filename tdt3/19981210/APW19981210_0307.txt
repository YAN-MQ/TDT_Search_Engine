Iraqi newspapers on Thursday carried the official agency report on 
the incident. But surprisingly, no newspaper mentioned it in editorials. 
Jassim's comments seemed sure to complicate matters. He said the inspectors' 
attempt to search the site was ``unprecedented.'' Asked if inspectors 
would be barred again, he said, ``Yes it will be forbidden because 
there is no justification. Nor will you find by entering anything 
inside that is banned or prohibited.'' The inspectors must certify 
that Iraq has dismantled its chemical, biological and nuclear weapons, 
long-range missiles and programs to build them before the U.N. Security 
Council will lift an oil embargo and other sanctions imposed after 
Iraq invaded Kuwait in 1990. The sanctions have devastated Iraq's 
economy. Iraqi officials have long insisted they have eliminated all 
illegal weapons. Unannounced visits in the past have been a major 
source of friction with Iraq, leading to three crises in the past 
year. Iraq had suspended the inspections in August. It allowed them 
to resume only last month, averting a military strike by the United 
States and Britain. The two countries have left an armada in the Gulf 
to ensure that Iraq abides by its promise to cooperate.
