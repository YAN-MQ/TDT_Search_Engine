Over the last quarter-century, the United Nations has given its highest 
award for human rights work to the greatest names and institutions 
that shaped the movement. Eleanor Roosevelt, who steered the United 
Nations into human rights, won one of the first awards, posthumously, 
in 1968. Other towering names and institutions followed. Among them 
were the International Committee of the Red Cross, Amnesty International 
and the Rev. Dr. Martin Luther King Jr., in 1978, and Nelson Mandela 
in 1988. But Thursday, on the 50th anniversary of the Universal Declaration 
of Human Rights, the men and women who stepped up to receive their 
awards from Secretary-General Kofi Annan were a very different group. 
Except for one _ former President Jimmy Carter, who did not attend 
because he has been involved in monitoring the presidential election 
in Venezuela _ this year's winners are internationally unknown people 
who have learned to wage often lonely battles for the rights of ordinary 
people at the grass roots. ``This is a sea change for the U.N.,'' 
said Felice Gaer, director of the Jacob Blaustein Institute for the 
Advancement of Human Rights in New York. Measured in thousands of 
small organizations _ local women's groups, student-led voting drives, 
campaigns against child labor or for better environmental protection 
of villages and neighborhoods around the world _ the human rights 
movement has changed profoundly in 50 years. Institutions and international 
covenants against a range of abuses are in place and being tested. 
The laptop, the Internet and the fax machine have created once-unthinkable 
networks for sharing strategies, sources of help and the power of 
example. ``We are encouraged by this high office acknowledging what 
we are doing,'' said Angelina Acheng Atyam of Uganda, a nurse-midwife 
in a local clinic who received one of this year's awards for fighting 
to keep children out of war. ``It gives us strength.'' Ms. Atyam was 
recognized for trying to stop the abduction, forced recruitment and 
sexual abuse of African children by a group called the Lord's Resistance 
Army and other forces in a region engulfed by guerrilla wars. Among 
the thousands missing in northern Uganda is her daughter, Charlotte, 
who was seized two years ago at 14. ``I found myself in the middle 
of it,'' Ms. Atyam said in an interview Wednesday, explaining how 
she came to be among a few who spoke up for the rights of thousands 
of Ugandan families. ``We made up our minds to rise up. When we found 
that many other parents were scared of repercussions, we decided to 
shout for them.'' Other winners this year were Sunila Abeyesekera 
of Sri Lanka, who has worked to safeguard democracy and women's rights 
in the face of civil war; Jose Gregori of Brazil, a former student 
activist against the military who now, under a democratic government, 
heads the National Secretariat for Human Rights, and Anna Sabatova 
of the Czech Republic, who was once sent to jail for urging people 
to vote and later became a founder of Charter 77, an action organization 
that led a democratic resistance to Communism. Ms. Sabatova took the 
opportunity at a news conference Thursday to keep her gadfly reputation 
alive. She criticized the present Czech Republic government under 
President Vaclav Havel for what she sees as inattention to minority 
rights, police behavior and prison conditions.
