It is just two years from now that the winter Olympics will open in 
Salt Lake City, Utah. However, tonight the city's Olympic committee 
is fighting a very serious charge that it tried improperly to influence 
members of the international olympic committee. In effect, they tried 
to buy the right to host the games. ABC's Tom foreman is in Salt Lake 
City tonight. The accusation is that when Salt Lake City mounted its 
winning olympic bid, the city may have stacked the deck, with money. 
I think everybody thinks they're bribes. Over a period of seven years, 
the city gave relatives of African members of the international Olympic 
committee nearly $400,000 in scholarships to attend American universities. 
Africa controls the second largest block of votes on Olympic bids. 
The goal is very clear. If it looks, walks and quacks like a bribe, 
it's a bribe. And you have no question that that's what this is? Oh, 
none. None at all. The salt lake Olympic committee denies the charge. 
They say it is a long standing Olympic tradition wealthier nations 
helre was no attempt to buy votes. There's absolutely nothing new 
about this. And certainly the program wasn't conducted in any secretive 
manner. The U.S. and international Olympic committees are saying very 
little about all of this. Even as today they ordered an investigation 
into the affair. But as salt lake prepares for the games, there is 
clearly concern that the olympic image itself may wind up needing 
rebuilding. Tom foreman, ABC News, Salt Lake City.
