Iraq's ruling party said today, U.N. weapons inspectors will not be 
allowed to search its headquarters in Baghdad. U.N. monitors hoping 
to make a surprise inspection were turned away from the ba'ath party 
offices yesterday. A party spokesman says inspectors will not be permitted 
in the building because there is no banned material inside, and therefore 
a search would be unjustified. U.N. officials say their normal inspections 
are continuing today across iraq.
