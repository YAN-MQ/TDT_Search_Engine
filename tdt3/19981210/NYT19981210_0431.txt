Despite increasing pressure on Rep. Bob Livingston, the incoming speaker 
of the House, to indicate whether he would allow a censure vote against 
President Clinton on the House floor, he maintained his public distance 
on the topic Thursday. ``I have every intention of bringing the product 
of the Judiciary Committee to the floor and making sure that we get 
a vote on it,'' he said when asked if he would allow a censure vote. 
He spoke briefly to reporters outside the Capitol Hill Club, where 
he addressed the National Jewish Coalition. Asked if he believed censure 
was constitutional, he said: ``That's not for me to determine. That's 
for the parliamentarians and the historians to determine. It's an 
issue that frankly I don't want to prejudge until I see exactly what 
the Judiciary Committee reports out.'' Livingston, who is to be sworn 
in as speaker Jan. 6., has maintained a public neutrality toward the 
impeachment process, although, as he told the coalition Thursday, 
he wants it to be over soon. ``If I have anything to say about it, 
by the end of this year the House of Representatives won't have anything 
to do with it anymore,'' he said. ``It will be over with.'' But he 
allowed that the Senate could well be dealing with the matter, if 
the House approves articles of impeachment. As he alluded to the Republican 
agenda, Livingston told the group: ``Yes, we have endured six years 
of the Clinton presidency; we've got two more years.'' Then, apparently 
realizing that he sounded as if he expected Clinton to remain in office, 
he added offhandedly: ``At most.''
