The Protestant leader of Northern Ireland, David Trimble, accepted 
his share of the 1998 Nobel Peace Prize on Thursday and warned militant 
Roman Catholics against delays in turning over their arms caches. 
Trimble acknowledged that splinter groups on the pro-British side 
had weapons, too. But he said the Irish Republican Army and its political 
wing, Sinn Fein, were to blame for resurging tensions that have stalled 
the peace drive and that cast a pall over the awards Thursday. His 
Catholic counterpart, John Hume, who shared the prize, said Trimble 
was premature to insist on disarmament, because the accord provides 
two years to achieve it. `The real issue about guns and arms is that 
they have been totally silent,' Hume, head of the Social Democratic 
and Labor Party, said. He added that some militants linked disarmament 
to surrender, a ``psychological factor'' that he predicted would diminish 
with time. Despite the recognition of continuing problems, the tone 
was one of thanks for obstacles surmounted. ``It is now up to political 
leaders on all sides,'' Hume said, to deliver ``agreed structures 
for peace that will forever remove the underlying causes of violence 
and division on our island.'' The laureates have come to personify 
hopes for peace in a province where 3,200 people have been killed 
in 30 years of conflict. On May 22 a referendum overwhelmingly endorsed 
the accord. Trimble is first minister in the new provisional Assembly. 
But he has threatened to put off forming the multi-party cabinet called 
for in the accord reached in April until paramilitary groups begin 
to hand in their weapons. ``Any further delay will reinforce dark 
doubts about whether Sinn Fein are drinking from the clear water of 
democracy or still drinking from the dark stream of fascism,'' Trimble, 
head of the Ulster Unionist Party, told an audience of 1,000 at Oslo 
City Hall. The disarmament issue is also blocking progress on prisoner 
releases and the creation of institutional bodies linking Northern 
Ireland with the Republic of Ireland to the south. Francis Sejersted, 
chairman of the Nobel committee, praised both men but called Hume 
`the architect of the peace process' and a bridge to Catholic hard-liners 
without whom any agreement would be meaningless. While Trimble and 
Hume represent the largest mainstream parties in Northern Ireland, 
each must mollify extremists on his own side of the religious divide 
for peace to take root. This week, John Taylor, deputy chief of Trimble's 
Ulster Unionist Party, told The Irish Times that conflicting views 
on the way ahead posed ``a possibility of a major collapse.''
