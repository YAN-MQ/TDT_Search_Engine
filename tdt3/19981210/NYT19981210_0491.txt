When the organizers of a Dec. 19 exhibition game with locked-out National 
Basketball Association players promised to devote some of the proceeds 
to tapped-out players, mockery was inevitable. Thursday's decision 
to reverse themselves was a triumph of sense over silliness. It was 
inappropriate for the game's masterminds, the agents David Falk and 
Arn Tellem, to create an event starring rich players that would benefit 
other players pinched by the loss of paychecks (two, so far) to a 
greater degree than it would UNICEF, the game's designated real charity. 
That any group of players, who all earned at least $275,000 last season, 
could become an ad hoc charity cited with UNICEF _ which would get 
at least $100,000 _ was misguided, at best. Now, the proceeds that 
would have gone to players will go to charities in Philadelphia, the 
site of the canceled NBA All-Star Game. Organizers of the event, which 
will be seen on Showtime, hope to raise $750,000 for charities, including 
UNICEF. ``The players had their hearts in the right place, but it's 
too bad people, especially the media, misconstrued it all,'' said 
Curtis Polk, who co-founded Falk Associates Management Enterprises. 
``We suggested that a fund be built because if the season is canceled, 
there'd be real hardship.'' He added: ``The players are suffering, 
whether or not they did well with their money. Losing money hurts 
no matter what you make.'' Had the cash-strapped players considered 
home equity loans? If their bank said no to a loan, didn't they know 
that Champion says yes? The players need not plead penury. True, they 
will not be paid until a season starts, but their union in the past 
month has sent each player a check worth a tidy $40,000 for licensing 
rights. And more money is coming: the union hasn't doled out a cent 
from its $20 million strike fund. Falk &AMP; Company didn't get the 
players-as-charity idea all wrong _ they just picked the wrong players. 
Maybe they should have been helping the truly needy, the older players, 
the ones who never made millions or who don't get decent pensions, 
the ones who need money to afford their rent, mortgages, prescriptions 
or wives' funerals. ``I hope they're thinking of the guys who came 
up against hard times, not guys deprived of their salary because of 
a lockout,'' said Joe Garagiola, president of the Baseball Assistance 
Team, which provides grants to former major leaguers and Negro leaguers 
and their families who face dire times. Garagiola, the former major 
leaguer and broadcaster, spoke Thursday on the telephone to a social 
worker who was overseeing the care of a former major leaguer's two 
children. The assistance team has been providing grants since 1994 
for the boy and girl, who were placed in foster care when their father 
was placed in drug rehabilitation and their mother was imprisoned. 
``This year, he's going to be able to buy his kids some Christmas 
gifts,'' Garagiola said from his home in Arizona. ``But he's really 
going to have to prove himself to get his kids back.'' There's the 
case of Varlin Law, one of the former pitcher Vernon Law's six kids. 
Varlin, 36, needed a bone marrow transplant to treat leukemia, but 
his medical insurance wouldn't pay for it all. The assistance team 
paid some of his huge medical expenses and keeps helping by paying 
mortgage and utility costs, giving Varlin Law, his wife and their 
three children some peace of mind. Varlin is recovering, Garagiola 
said, and Vernon will speak of BAT's help at the organization's annual 
banquet on Jan. 19 in New York. ``I've heard things I never thought 
I'd hear,'' Garagiola said. ``A tough third baseman told me, `I got 
to get out of the house.' '' The man said that his wife was driving 
him crazy, that he needed two days to himself. ``Then he began to 
cry. He said, `You don't know what it's like to see your wife walking 
around in diapers.' '' Garagiola paused briefly. ``Man, that really 
gets to you.'' This year, the assistance team will raise between $800,000 
and $900,000 and disburse about $750,000 in 108 grants, some large, 
some small. About 75 percent of the organization's funding comes through 
the annual dinner, but it also raised money from a softball tournament 
organized by Yankee pitcher David Cone, an auction of autographed 
uniforms from this year's All-Stars and golf tournaments run by former 
players like Ralph Branca and Bob Gibson. And if Garagiola is asked 
for an autograph, he requests a $10 check to BAT. He said he raised 
about $5,000 a year that way. ``I'm sure there must be some old basketball 
players who need help, not guys who just missed a paycheck,'' Garagiola 
said. ``It's admirable for guys to be concerned with other guys losing 
paychecks, but I wonder if they're thinking about the guys who made 
it possible for them to make what they're making.'' He said that if 
current NBA players wanted to help the older ones, it wasn't always 
easy. Sometimes it's difficult to find those who need help, sometimes 
tough to persuade them to take the money. ``The same pride that makes 
them professionals,'' Garagiola said, ``sometimes makes them too proud 
to accept charity.'' Then he read from a letter written by the widow 
of a former Yankee, a World Series winner: ``It's important to express 
the fact that you are my family. I couldn't be blessed with a better 
family than BAT.''
