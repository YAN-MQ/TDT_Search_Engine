NEW YORK _ F.A.O. Schwarz: Watch out. Attention: K-Mart shoppers. 
A world-class collection of antique toys can be seen Friday in New 
York and they are all for sale. But you'd better move fast; Saturday 
is the day. That is when Sotheby's will auction 1,000 toys, dating 
from the 1870s to the 1950s, from the estate of Carol F. Andersen, 
the Andersen Windows heiress who died in 1992. Ms. Andersen and her 
husband, Bill Rubenstein, bought their toys from the 1960s to the 
mid-1980s. ``We collected toys that excited us visually and emotionally,'' 
Rubenstein said, adding, ``Most of them tell a story about history.'' 
John Darcy Noble, the former curator of the Museum of the City of 
New- York, said: ``Toys are the most vivid, direct and truthful representation 
of the morals and manners of the time. Toys weren't bought by children. 
They were bought by parents who had social standards.'' Ms. Andersen, 
for example, owned a set of figures based on Teddy Roosevelt's safari 
to Africa in 1909-10; a clockwork toy depicting Christopher Columbus, 
and a mechanical figure of Ulysses S. Grant. The Roosevelt figures 
made up ``Teddy's Adventures in Africa,'' produced by Schoenhut Co. 
of Philadelphia, circa 1912. The Roosevelt menagerie includes a wooden-jointed 
TR in safari suit and pith helmet; a photographer modeled on the Rough 
Rider's son Kermit; an African tribesman; a lion, and a glass-eyed 
rhino. The camp has its original box and comes with toy rifles, a 
folding stool, a tent and supplies. A lithograph of a savannah with 
palm trees and jungle grasses provides a scenic backdrop. Estimate: 
$8,000 to $10,000. The Columbus toy is a rare souvenir from the 1892-93 
Columbian World Exposition in Chicago. It consists of a tin egg, hand-painted 
with red, white and blue stripes. When the large end is pressed down, 
a model of the galleon ``Santa Maria'' pops out of the top, with Columbus 
and crew waving on deck. The masts unfold and canvas sails unfurl. 
The toy was made by Ives of Bridgeport, Conn., and retains its original 
box. Estimate: $5,000 to $7,000. Another Ives toy depicts General 
Grant in uniform. When a hidden mechanism in the base is activated, 
the general raises a hand with a cigar and exhales perfect smoke rings. 
Estimate: $10,000 to $15,000. One of Ms. Andersen's most compelling 
toys is a figure of a black woman wearing a bonnet and apron, and 
standing behind a podium. Her eyes are flashing. When wound, she turns 
her head from side to side and bangs her hand on the podium. The figure 
was produced in about 1880 by Automatic Toy Works of New York City. 
Experts, including Eric Alberta, who specializes in toys for Sotheby's, 
believe she is a model of Sojourner Truth, the moniker of Isabella 
Baumtree, a slave born in 1797 who moved to New York and helped other 
slaves escape. She also was an active suffragist before her death 
in 1873. Estimate: $6,000 to $8,000. Ms. Andersen and her husband, 
both Francophiles, lived in a French-style house with French provincial 
antiques and owned French toys. They particularly loved the wind-up 
tin toys made after 1878 by the Paris manufacturer Fernand Martin. 
``The Martin toys struck a chord,'' Rubenstein said. ``They are incredibly 
accurate at portraying French life. They are crude in one way and 
sophisticated in another.'' During an interview at a new Sotheby's 
showroom, at 411 East 76th Street, where the toys are on display, 
Alberta said: ``Martin's genius was to observe everyday people and 
transform them into toys.'' He added: ``Many times, toys are made 
for children but with adults in mind. The subtleties would be lost 
on a child.` Rubenstein and Ms. Andersen bought witty Martin figures 
of a barrel roller, a street sweeper, a woodworker, a judge and a 
waltzing couple. They also owned a figure of a dapper barber with 
a huge mustache and mop of hair, who keeps rubbing hair tonic on his 
client's bald pate. Another Martin figure, circa 1900, depicts a woman 
who mimics the popular American dance of the day. Labeled ``Le Cake 
Walk,'' the figure is of a woman wearing a pink dress, who raises 
her arms in the air, palms up. When wound, she steps forward, throwing 
out one leg at a time. My favorite is Martin's ``Plate Stacker'' toy, 
circa 1920. This figure is of a young Breton girl in clogs who is 
balancing an impossibly tall stack of dishes. When wound, she tilts 
from side to side, then falls over backward, sending the plates flying. 
Madelon was the subject of a popular World War I song about an indefatigable 
girl who served soldiers in an army canteen, and the toy may well 
be that Madelon. Estimate: $1,500 to $2,000. Ms. Andersen also collected 
Lehmann tin toys from Germany. Ernst Paul Lehmann established his 
firm in 1881 and marked his toys with the letter ``e.'' Some Lehmann 
toys are politically incorrect yet irresistible. ``The Masuyama Rickshaw,'' 
circa 1927, features an Asian man in a chartreuse shirt (slyly printed 
with e's all over), pink pants and slouch hat, dutifully pulling an 
elegant woman in a kimono who is seated in a rickshaw. When wound 
up, the man lurches forward and the woman waves a fan to cool herself. 
Estimate: $800 to $1,200. Most Europeans hadn't seen a ``jinrikisha,'' 
or rickshaw, until one was displayed at the Paris World's Fair of 
1889, where it caused a sensation, Alberta said. Lehmann named his 
toy after the city of Masuyama, a gathering place for Japanese intellectuals 
in the 1920's. Another Lehmann toy in the Andersen collection shows 
how fads affect toys. ``Roller skating was a sensation in Germany 
in the early 1900s,'' Alberta said. ``The boom was almost over when 
Lehmann applied for the patent for his Primus figure.'' This toy depicts 
a handsome male skater in a blue cap, jacket and shorts. When wound, 
he spreads his legs apart, then pulls them together again. As he moves 
forward, his arms go back and forth. He is very rare and in good condition. 
Estimate: $6,000 to $8,000. An American item in the sale is known 
as a trade stimulator. A glass box, circa 1910, has the legend ``Catch 
on to the `Anakim' 5-cent cigar and be happy'' on the top. Inside 
is a lithograph of a dandy in a straw hat who has gone fishing. He 
sits by a stream, a box of cigars and a flask. When wound, the man 
jerks his rod, only to discover he's caught an old boot. Just then, 
a fish jumps out of the water, and escapes to safety. Estimate: $1,500 
to $2,000. Another American piece, from 1872, is an elaborate toy 
doll patented by George W. Brown for the Stevens &AMP; Brown Company 
of Cromwell, Conn. The doll, from the renowned Blair Whitton collection, 
pushes two oversize hoops. As she moves, a bell rings and a boy waves 
a flag. ``French and German toys may be amusing, but a George Brown 
is a work of folk art,'' said Noble, the collector and expert. He 
is also the guest curator of ``Dolls: Mirrors of Humanity,'' a popular 
show that remains at the Mingei International Museum in San Diego 
through Jan. 16.
