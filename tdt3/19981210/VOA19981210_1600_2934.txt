It's time for Business News. And here with the latest from Wall Street 
is Breck Artery. We had some real selling going on today at the Dow 
Jones Industrial Average. Closing at 8841. That was down 167 points, 
or almost two percent. Standard and Ports 500 index closed at 1165. 
That was down 18 points. And the NASDAQ index was off by 34. After 
hitting a record high yesterday. The stocks were down all day. Most 
analysts say concerns about corporate earnings drove the selling. 
Two companies issuing earnings warnings today were Merck, the giant 
pharmaceutical company. And Balero Energy, a leading independent oil 
refiner in the United States. Other major U.S. corporations like the 
Union Carbine, and the J.P. Morgan Bank issued their earnings warnings 
earlier this week. The stock of the Coca-Cola company fell. After 
two influential beverage industry analysts downgraded Coke's growth 
prospects for next year. Once again, the Dow Jones Industrial Average 
closed down 167 points. This is Breck Artery. Thank you, Breck.
