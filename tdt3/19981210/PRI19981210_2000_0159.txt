The PLO's second highest body has reaffirmed the removal of clauses 
in the organization's charter calling for Israel's destruction. The 
decision reassert the pledge made to Israel and the United States 
under the terms of the recent Wye River peace accord. Paul Adams reports 
from Jerusalem. The Palestine Central Council voted by 81 to 7 reaffirm 
changes in the PLO's charter. The tortured process of revising the 
charter should culminate next Monday in another meeting of the PLC 
to be addressed by President Clinton. Israel and the Palestinians 
disagree on whether or not there should be a vote. The Americans are 
embarrassed. As long ago as April 1996, President Clinton announced 
the PLC had already honored its commitment to amend the charter. Paul 
Adams, BBC, Jerusalem.
