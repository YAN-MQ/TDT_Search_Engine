Now to a "fleecing of America" that has some taxpayers calling for 
a Penalty flag. At issue -- the plan to build a new stadium for the 
New England Patriots football team in Hartford, Connecticut. The concessions 
the city and state have made to the team's owner give a Whole new 
meaning to the term sweet deal. Here's NBC's Fred Francis. The richest 
stadium deal in sports history is falling into the hands of the man 
who owns this team. The New England prait ots. Taxpayers are getting 
hosed on this deal. To boost its economy, Connecticut lured the Patriots 
from massachusetts. By offering a Pot of gold, experts say, never 
before given to any sports franchise. Connecticut will be the laughing 
stock of the country if this deal passes as is. The new Hartford stadium 
will cost almost $800 million in principal and interest over 30 years. 
And since the money will come from tax-free bonds the federal treasury 
and all taxpayers take a hit, too. The football team's owner, Robert 
kraft, gets free rent, 90% of ticket sales, all concession and parking 
revenue, a $15 million practice park. Mr. kraft will probably be clearing 
$100 million from stadium revenue alone. And what happens over the 
next few years if the team starts playing badly? It stinks. That won't 
hurt the Patriots owner very much because the state has guaranteed 
him $17.5 million a year to buy the empty seats. Governor John Rowland 
admits he made the deal in secret. He's certain the state will not 
lose money. The economic impact and the excitement and all the morale 
impact it has on our community is well worth this investment. Play 
action. Despite the excitement over a new sports team the costs rarely 
payoff for the community. The evidence from all the previous experiences 
over the last 40 years, from bringing professional sports teams and 
new facilities into the towns, is that it does not provide a kick, 
positive kick, for the local economy. There is almost no chance the 
deal will sour. You're giving away the family store. Oh, not at all. 
I don't think so. We did what we had to do to get them to move in 
to Hartford to be the, I think, the nucleus of our economic development 
in this community. I may be wrong. But I don't think so. I'm betting 
my political reputation on it. You are? Absolutely! It's nearly a 
$1 billion bet with odds stacked against taxpayers, an outrageous 
"fleecing of America." Fred Francis, NBC news, Hartford.
