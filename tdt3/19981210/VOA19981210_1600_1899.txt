For the second day in a row, officials in Iraq are saying that U.N. 
inspectors will not be allowed to enter a building housing offices 
of the ruling Bath party. The inspectors were denied entry to the 
building on Wednesday. Nevertheless, as VOA correspondent Scott Bob 
reports from our Middle East Bureau, the full contingent of U.N. inspectors 
continued their work Thursday. A regional party leader in Baghdad 
told reporters Thursday, U.N. weapons inspectors will be turned back 
again. If they try to enter any party headquarters. The official said 
there is nothing inside the headquarters that is banned or prohibited. 
And that political parties are not included in the inspection sites. 
A spokesman for the inspectors did not comment on Wednesday's incident. 
Or say whether the inspectors would try again to inspect party offices. 
She said the inspectors continued their duties Thursday. With no change 
to their routines. The teams are due to complete the latest round 
of inspections by Monday. As part of an agreement, Iraq hopes will 
lead to the end of economic sanctions. Scott Bob, VOA News, Middle 
East Bureau.
