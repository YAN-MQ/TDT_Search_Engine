In impeachment hearings today, David Schippers, the Republican's lead 
investigative counsel on the House Judiciary Committee has wrapped 
up his testimony. Members of the committee now have time to make their 
own statements and question the counsel. From Washington, Emily Harris 
reports. David Schippers used videotaped clips of President Clinton 
to support his view that the president repeatedly lied and must regretfully 
be removed from office. Schippers said Clinton lied in the Paula Jones 
case to Ken Starr's grand jury, to the public, and to his own staff. 
He said the case against the president has nothing to do with sex. 
Today's other witness, Democratic counsel Abe Lowell, also showed 
video clips and played tape excerpts, but he argued that to impeach 
President Clinton would lower the bar for future offenses. The Judiciary 
Committee could vote as early as Friday on four article of impeachment. 
For THE WORLD, I'm Emily Harris in Washington.
