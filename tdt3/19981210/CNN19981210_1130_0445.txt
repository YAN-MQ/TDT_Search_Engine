The winners of this year's nobel peace prize say they're accepting 
the award, even though the dream of peace still hasn't been fully 
realized in their Homeland. Northern Ireland political leaders David 
trimble and John Hume received the award in Oslo, Norway, today, for 
their work on the good Friday peace accord reached last spring. The 
men received a gold medal and will share a cash prize of nearly $1 
million.
