For years it blazed a trail through Africa's bloody conflicts, earning 
a reputation for supplying the continent's most efficient guns for 
hire. Now Executive Outcomes, the South African private military company, 
is closing, bringing an end to almost a decade of controversial involvement 
in other people's wars. Defending the firm to the last, director Nico 
Palm on Thursday denied EO was a mercenary outfit. He said he was 
proud of its record in helping end civil wars in Angola and Sierra 
Leone. ``We have had some good times and we are proud of what we have 
achieved,'' he told The Associated Press. In a brief announcement 
on Tuesday the Pretoria-based firm said it would wind up its business 
by Jan. 1. ``Over the past two years the majority of governments in 
Africa have endeavored to secure and maintain law and order. The nature 
of these efforts do not justify our involvement,'' the firm said. 
But analysts say the opportunities for private security companies 
have never been greater. With wars raging across Africa from the Congo 
to Sudan, the hundreds of ``freelance'' soldiers on EO's database 
of potential employees are unlikely to be short of work. Some security 
analysts say EO was motivated by strict new anti-mercenary laws passed 
in South Africa earlier this year. The laws ban South African firms 
from participating in mercenary operations, allowing the state to 
confiscate the assets of guilty companies. Palm, however, denied the 
decision to close shop was caused by the legislation. He said the 
firm had secured a government permit to operate, but its management 
was simply tired of the business. ``I have got a family and after 
ten years we had enough of it,'' Palm said. Marketing itself as a 
legal _ if unusual _ company, EO has always denied getting involved 
in wars itself. Instead it says it supplied security, training and 
equipment to legitimate governments or foreign companies working in 
tough areas. Founded in 1989 during the endgame of apartheid, it has 
a slick Internet site detailing past successes and giving information 
on how clients can get in contact. Its logo is a fierce looking knight 
chess piece. Mark Malan, head of the peacekeeping program at the Institute 
for Security Studies in Johannesburg said the firm's image had suffered 
a blow after a disastrous contract taken out by the government of 
Papua New Guinea in 1997. After being hired to provide a small mercenary 
force to help Papua New Guinea deal with a rebellion, the foreigners' 
arrival instead triggered a military mutiny and protests that prompted 
the government to nullify the deal. Malan said EO also became a victim 
of its own success, with its famous name being used by ill-trained 
soldiers of fortune with no link to the firm. For Palm, who declines 
to say what he plans next, it is no longer his business. ``They are 
freelancers and we can't be responsible for what they do,'' he said.
