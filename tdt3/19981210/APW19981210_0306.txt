Kosovo rebels objected again Thursday to international statements 
blaming both sides for the failure to end bloodshed in the province. 
The rebels said it was the Serbs who had failed to cooperate. ``This 
attempt to put on an equal level the Serb fascist regime with KLA 
units is unacceptable, and demonstrates an inability to name the main 
guilty party in the wars in the territories in ex-Yugoslavia,'' the 
Kosovo Liberation Army's general command said. ``The KLA has shown 
a couple of times its willingness to cooperate with international 
institutions,'' said the statement, published in the ethnic Albanian 
paper Koha Ditore. ``It released all the captured and detained Serbs, 
and the other side never cooperated.'' In an apparent reference to 
Ibrahim Rugova, the pacifist Kosovo Albanian leader who is in France 
to receive an award, the rebels said: ``It would be an honor for French 
democracy but also for European democracy to the victims of freedom 
and democracy.'' They called on ethnic Albanians to unite behind a 
single ``intellectual and financial force to save Kosovo'' _ apparently 
appealing for support from those who back Rugova's Democratic League 
of Kosovo, the dominant Albanian political party.
