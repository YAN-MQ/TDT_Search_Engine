quick click of the mouse can take you to the world of the sleuth. 
That's what's "on-line." Here's a web site that takes the mystery 
out of solving mysteries. evidence: The true witness, at the address 
shown below, teaches you how forensic science is used to solve real-life 
crimes. It also allows you to have multimedia fun using what you learn 
to investigate a fictional kidnapping. You'll assume the identity 
of not-so-super sleuth K.C. Rodgers as you investigate the crime by 
interviewing some slightly eccentric witnesses and/or suspects. The 
true fun and education comes as you try to get a clue or clues in 
the virtual reality crime scene. You can see how real detectives dust 
for fingerprints, collect genetic data from items like hairbrushes 
and match blood samples. There's a handy online glossary of terms 
used in the murder-solving biz. And if you think this is something 
you might want to do for a living, this web site includes video of 
real forensic scientists talking about their craft. Remember, leave 
no stone unturned, fingerprint undusted or DNA sample unidentified
