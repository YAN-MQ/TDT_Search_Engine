Yemeni tribesmen blew up a pipeline operated by an American company 
on Thursday, apparently to try to force the government to pay for 
development projects in their region, security and tribal officials 
said. An explosive device set off at dawn damaged the pipeline owned 
by the Hunt Oil Co., setting it ablaze, according to a tribal official 
who spoke on condition of anonymity. There were no immediate reports 
of casualties. The pipeline carries oil from the Safer field in Marib 
province to a port on the Red Sea. The tribesmen are believed to be 
members of the Jahm tribe, which carried out similar attacks in the 
past. The latest incident occurred near Wadi Hayyab. It is not far 
from Saraweh, where the pipeline was hit on Dec. 2. The fire, which 
was still burning late Thursday, was being fed by crude that leaked 
from the broken line, security officials said, also on condition their 
names not be used. Hunt Oil Co. officials estimated the leak at about 
1,500 barrels. They, too, asked for anonymity. In the past, repairs 
have taken from four days to a week. Members of the Jahm tribe, who 
claimed similar incidents in the past, say they want the government 
to build power plants and a water distribution system in their region. 
Large parts of Yemen are lawless, inhabited by tribes who do not hesitate 
to use firearms to settle scores with rivals or to express discontent 
with the government. Hunt Oil Company's oil field concession in Marib 
produces 165,000 barrels per day. The company employs 1,300 Yemeni 
staff in addition to 30 foreign workers.
