Both sides in the impeachment inquiry put President Clinton on the 
witness stand on Thursday, showing snippets of video from his deposition 
in the Paula Jones lawsuit to present him alternately as: a) unfairly 
ganged up on by a bunch of lawyers, and b) quite a talented liar. 
In summing up their case, the Republicans wanted to use the tape, 
which had not been seen before, to embarrass the president. In the 
end, Democrats pre-empted them by showing it first. They used the 
tape to suggest that Clinton could not reasonably have been expected 
to grasp a legal definition of sex when a roomful of smart lawyers 
and an Arkansas judge could not agree on it, either. The part of the 
tape selected by the Democratic counsel, Abbe Lowell, shows Clinton 
watching his lawyer, Robert Bennett, dispute the broad definition 
of sex offered by Mrs. Jones' attorneys for the purpose of deposing 
the president in connection with Mrs. Jones' sexual harassment suit. 
Under one proposed definition, Bennett said, ``If the president patted 
me and said I need to lose 10 pounds off my bottom, you could argue 
that I had sexual relations with him.'' Federal District Judge Susan 
Webber Wright said that she herself found the definition a bit too 
complicated and agreed to narrow it somewhat. ``It's going to make 
it difficult for me to rule, if you want to know the truth, and I'm 
not sure Mr. Clinton knows all these definitions anyway.'' But in 
the same bit of tape, Clinton seemed to undercut the point the White 
House counsel was trying to make in showing it. When one of Ms. Jones' 
lawyers asked him _ twice _ whether he understood the meaning of the 
words, he pored over the definition and nodded in assent, then said, 
``I do.'' After the lights in the hearing room went back up, White 
House counsel told the House Judiciary Committee that the tape showed 
the president ``being set up by the Paula Jones attorneys and Linda 
Tripp,'' and that his reactions were those of a cornered man instinctively 
trying to protect himself from a sucker punch. When Clinton gave the 
deposition on Jan. 17, he knew that Monica Lewinsky had been subpoenaed 
by Ms. Jones' lawyers. But he was clearly surprised by the detail 
of the questions by lawyers, who knew even that he had given her a 
hat pin. Throughout much of the afternoon, Republican counsel David 
Schippers used the same video to quite different ends, interspersing 
his closing argument with video bits intended to catch Clinton in 
what he characterized as outright lies. ``I'd like you to look up 
at the screens to see his lies for yourself,'' Schippers said. ``Watch!'' 
In the first cut, Clinton answered a question about whether he was 
ever alone in his office with Ms. Lewinsky. ``I don't recall,'' he 
said, ``but it seems to me she brought things to me once or twice 
on the weekends,'' staying in the office only long enough to drop 
off some papers and exchange pleasantries. ``When Congress is there 
we're working all the time.'' Were he and Ms. Lewinsky at any time 
alone in the hallway off the Oval Office? ``I don't believe so, unless 
we were walking back with the pizza,'' Clinton said. Alone in any 
room in the White House? Again, with annoyance, he repeated that Ms. 
Lewinsky may have, in working overtime in the legislative affairs 
office, dropped by to deliver some documents. Schippers seemed to 
take particular pleasure in showing a video clip of Clinton saying 
he did not necessarily remember exchanging gifts with Ms. Lewinsky. 
The Jan. 17 deposition took place less than three weeks after he had 
given Ms. Lewinsky a number of Christmas and going away gifts, including 
``a bear, symbolizing strength.'' ``I don't recall,'' he said, smirking. 
``Do you know what they were?'' And when asked if he remembered her 
giving him any gifts _ she gave him at least 40, Schippers said, in 
a ritual they went through at virtually every meeting _ Clinton scratched 
his head and said, ``Once or twice I think she's given me a book or 
two.'' At another moment in the deposition, Clinton is shown watching 
his lawyer, Bennett, make the case that he was well aware of Ms. Lewinsky's 
affidavit claiming that she had no sexual relationship with the president. 
The president has said that he allowed Bennett to make this comment 
without knowing that it was less than completely truthful because 
he had not been paying much attention to his lawyer. ``The whole argument 
just passed me by,'' he said. Schippers ballyhooed this piece of the 
tape, saying, ``Take a look at this tape and you will see what the 
president of the United States doesn't want the people ever to see.'' 
And as promised, Clinton is shown riveted to his lawyer, appearing 
very much absorbed in the proceedings. As Bennett read Ms. Lewinsky's 
affidavit, the president nodded in agreement with several points, 
and then affirmed, ``That's absolutely true.'' Did you have an extramarital 
affair with Monica Lewinsky, he was asked. ``No, he said.'' And if 
she said otherwise, the lawyer asked, would that be a lie? Clinton 
hesitated. Then he said, ``It's certainly not the truth.''
