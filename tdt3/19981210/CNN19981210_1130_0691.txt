To many people, this noise is nothing to smile about. But thanks to 
new laser technology, having a cavity treated may get a Little easier. 
The laser offers a pain-free solution to 98% of patients. Just ask 
12-year-old Rachel Owens. She had the procedure with no anesthesia. 
It just felt like tapping. That was it. It works by combining the 
power of the laser with a High-precision water spray. This doctor 
uses it in his practice. Causes the water to actually do the cutting. 
The laser does a little bit, but 85% of it is done by regular water. 
The laser has some other benefits. It produces a sterile field as 
it cuts, which decreases tooth sensitivity and causes a stronger bond. 
Dentists hope the laser will raise a generation of people who aren't 
afraid to visit their offices.
