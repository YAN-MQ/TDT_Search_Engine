For THE WORLD, this is Alan Dow in the BBC newsroom in London. The 
House Judiciary Committee is hearing the final legal arguments before 
the vote on four articles of impeachment against President Clinton. 
Republican chief counsel David Schippers says he found additional 
evidence that President Clinton obstructed justice and abused his 
power. It is my sorrowful duty now to accuse President William Jefferson 
Clinton of obstruction of justice, false and deliberately misleading 
statements under oath, witness tampering, abuse of power, and false 
statements to and obstruction of the Congress of the United States 
in the course of this very impeachment inquiry. Republican chief impeachment 
counsel David Schippers.
