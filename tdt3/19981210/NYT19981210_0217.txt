Shakespeare meets Sherlock, and makes for pure enchantment in the 
inspired conjecture behind ``Shakespeare in Love.'' This film's exhilarating 
cleverness springs from its speculation about where the playwright 
might have found the beginnings of ``Romeo and Juliet,'' but it is 
not constrained by worries about literary or historical accuracy. 
(So what if characters talk about Virginia tobacco plantations before 
there was a Virginia?) Galvanized by the near-total absence of biographical 
data, it soars freely into the realm of invention, wittily weaving 
Shakespearean language and emotion into an intoxicatingly glamorous 
romance. No less marvelous are its imaginings of an Elizabethan theater 
fraught with the same backbiting and conniving we enjoy today. Tom 
Stoppard's mark on the jubilant screenplay, which originated as the 
brainstorm of Marc Norman, harks back to the behind-the-scenes delights 
of his ``Rosencrantz and Guildenstern Are Dead.'' This is a world 
in which a therapist times his patient with an hourglass and a souvenir 
mug is inscribed ``A Present From Stratford-Upon-Avon.'' Says the 
dashing young Shakespeare, played tempestuously well by Joseph Fiennes, 
about the more successful Christopher Marlowe (Rupert Everett): ``Lovely 
waistcoat. Shame about the poetry.'' And there is the inevitable moment 
when someone asks who Shakespeare is, only to be told by a comically 
obtuse producer (Geoffrey Rush): ``Nobody _ that's the author.'' Ingenious 
as the film's many inventions happen to be (from boatmen who behave 
like cabbies to its equivalent of Shakespearean outtakes _ ``One Gentleman 
of Verona'' in the writing process), it could never have had so much 
energy without the right real-life Juliet to dazzle Will. Gwyneth 
Paltrow, in her first great, fully realized starring performance, 
makes a heroine so breathtaking that she seems utterly plausible as 
the playwright's guiding light. In a film steamy enough to start a 
sonnet craze, her Viola de Lesseps really does seem to warrant the 
most timeless love poems, and to speak Shakespeare's own elegant language 
with astonishing ease. ``Shakespeare in Love'' itself seems as smitten 
with her as the poet is, and as alight with the same love of language 
and beauty. As directed by John Madden in much more rollicking, passionate 
style than his ``Mrs. Brown,'' ``Shakespeare in Love'' imagines Viola 
as the perfect muse: a literate, headstrong beauty who adores the 
theater and can use words like ``anon'' as readily as Shakespeare 
writes them. She comes into his life at a pivotal moment in his career, 
about which the film speculates with literary scholarship and Holmesian 
audacity. What if, before making the leap from his early works to 
the profound emotions of ``Romeo and Juliet,'' he had suffered both 
writer's block and a crisis in sexual confidence? (``It's as if my 
quill has broken,'' he tells his therapist.) What if such impotence 
could be cured only by a madly romantic liaison with a Juliet prototype, 
an unattainable woman with a habit of speaking from her balcony? Enter 
Viola, who is so eager to work in the theater that she disguises herself 
as a boy, since women are forbidden to act. (Part of the film's great 
fun is its way of working such Shakespearean gambits into its own 
plot.) On her way to winning the role of Romeo, Viola finds herself 
suddenly enmeshed with the handsome playwright himself, and the film 
gives way to a heady brew of literature and ardor. In one transporting 
montage, the lovers embrace passionately while rehearsing dialogue 
that spills over into stage scenes, and the bond between tempestuous 
love and artistic creation is illustrated beautifully. The film is 
as bold in its romantic interludes as it is in historical second-guessing, 
leaving Ms. Paltrow and Fiennes enmeshed in frequent half-nude, hotblooded 
clinches in her boudoir. Far richer and more deft than the other Elizabethan 
film in town (``Elizabeth''), this boasts a splendid, hearty cast 
of supporting players. (The actors in both films, like Fiennes, do 
notably better work here.) Colin Firth plays Viola's fiance as a perfect 
Wrong. Rush's opportunistic producer is very funny, as is Ben Affleck's 
version of a big-egoed actor, Elizabethan style. (Cast as Mercutio, 
he is also hoodwinked by Will into thinking that ``Mercutio'' is the 
play's name.) Also most amusing is Tom Wilkinson as a financier who 
grows stage-struck, Jim Carter as the actor who looks silliest in 
a dress, Simon Callow as the Queen's censor and Imelda Staunton as 
Viola's nurse. Judi Dench's shrewd, daunting Elizabeth is one of the 
film's utmost treats. So are its costumes. The designer Sandy Powell 
has previous credits including ``Orlando'' and ``The Wings of the 
Dove,'' and she deserves to be remembered for her wonderfully inventive 
work this year. She contributes extravagantly to this film's visual 
allure and did the same for ``Velvet Goldmine.'' Gear-switching that 
extreme is no mean feat. PUBLICATION NOTES SHAKESPEARE IN LOVE Rating:
