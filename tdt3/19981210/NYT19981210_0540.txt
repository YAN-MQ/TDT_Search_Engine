New York Giants quarterback Kent Graham knows he could be replaced 
Sunday, but he is preparing for the Denver Broncos as he did for each 
of his three previous opponents. That is because Graham never felt 
his starting job was entirely secure anyway. ``The coach said that 
if things weren't going good, he might make a change,'' Graham said, 
referring to Jim Fassel. ``That's always true. He always has the ability 
to pull you out of there no matter who you are. ``I personally don't 
think much has changed since last week.'' But Monday, Fassel said 
he planned to give Danny Kanell, the backup quarterback, more repetitions 
with the first unit during this week's practice, and he announced 
that Graham would have to play well or Kanell would be trading in 
his sideline baseball cap for his helmet. Fassel's comments were different 
from those he made in previous weeks when he said that it would be 
hard for Graham to lose his starting status in any one game. But Thursday, 
like Graham, Fassel said he did not think his comments on the quarterback 
situation reflected an entirely new approach. ``Yes, I'd want Danny 
to play,'' Fassel said after practice. ``But I expect Kent to do well. 
That's what I'm planning on _ him playing well.'' Kanell did get some 
extra practice time Thursday, but Fassel played down that, too. ``Danny 
got more reps but I don't ever believe in getting two guys ready for 
a game,'' Fassel said. ``Kent is the starting quarterback.'' Kanell, 
for his part, seems to be trying to walk a fine line between mutually 
exclusive goals. He wishes for playing time but he wishes good things 
for Graham and the Giants. ``I miss playing; I miss being in there,'' 
Kanell said this week. ``I'm anxious to get back on the field. But 
I want us to beat the Broncos.'' Kanell acknowledged the awkwardness 
of the situation, and he laughed off the notion that he should not 
be rooting for his comeback to come against as strong an opponent 
as the undefeated Broncos. ``I'm looking at it as opportunity,'' Kanell 
said. ``If anything, if it happened, it would be a no-lose situation. 
We're supposed to lose, you try to do your best, and if you beat them, 
you shock everyone.'' Kanell has been more at ease since the days 
just after his demotion when he seemed quiet and a bit removed in 
the Giants locker room. ``I definitely feel better,'' he said. ``Mentally, 
the time away has let me step back and see some things differently. 
And physically, my body and arm feel rested and much stronger.'' Kanell 
appears to be throwing the football with more authority in practice 
this week and his passes have more zip. But the starting job belongs 
to Graham, even if the handwriting on the wall would indicate a change 
will be made unless the Giants upset the Broncos, who are heavily 
favored. ``That's not going to change my thinking; I'm not playing 
like I have to be looking over my shoulder,'' Graham said. ``Producing 
is always a part of the job and I'm going to be positive and figure 
that if I do well, things will work out well. ``If things go wrong, 
I know Jim Fassel pretty well and I trust that whatever Jim did he 
would be doing because he thought it was best. If he pulled me, I 
probably deserved to be pulled. In the meantime, I'm going to go out 
and play.'' One thing is unusually true about this quarterback situation. 
There is little, if any, controversy over who should or should not 
be playing in the locker room. Neither has won enough this year to 
have divided loyalties on the team. Besides, the 5-8 Giants have bigger 
problems than their starter at quarterback. On offense, there are 
a number of players playing for their roster spots or their starting 
jobs. On defense, they are preparing for the high-powered Bronco offense. 
``We have confidence in any of our quarterbacks,'' wide receiver Chris 
Calloway said. ``We're all too busy trying to do our own job to worry 
about theirs.''
