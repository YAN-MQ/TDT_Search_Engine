The cash-strapped Arab League has received a dlrs 500,000 donation 
from the president of the United Arab Emirates, a league statement 
said Thursday. The league's secretary-general, Esmat Abdel-Meguid, 
received the check from the Emirates president, Sheik Zayed bin Sultan 
Al Nahyan, it said. The statement said the money would be put in a 
special ``Sheik Zayed Fund'' for projects that contribute to Arab 
unity. It gave no other details. The 22-member league has suffered 
financial problems for years because many members are behind in paying 
their dues.
