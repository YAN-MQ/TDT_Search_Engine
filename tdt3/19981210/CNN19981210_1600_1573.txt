Most people will agree the Monica Lewinsky case has been bad news 
for much of the U.S., but that's not true for one of President Clinton's 
biggest, and perhaps funniest, critics. Anne McDermott reports. Thanks 
to the president, it's been a very good year for Michael ramirez. 
In fact, it's getting to the point where I almost feel like contributing 
to his defense fund because he's made my job so easy. His job is political 
cartoonist for "the Los Angeles times." And here's his latest. So 
I have Clinton here holding a condom package, and I'm gonna put democrats 
across there because they essentially have been his protection. So 
how does he really feel? He really is shameless. And I think anybody 
else in his position probably would have resigned. Ramirez says some 
are surprised that a man of Mexican, Japanese and Spanish descent 
could hold such views, but he says he's that rarest of minorities, 
a conservative journalist. And he's got the cartoons to prove it. 
As for his critics, well, they're a diverse lot themselves. Take this 
hate letter. It's in Spanish. And that's the wonderful thing about 
being at "the Los Angeles times," is I get cursed out in five different 
languages on any given week. But that's okay. He didn't win a Pulitzer 
for being timid. Meanwhile, he's keeping busy. He's always busy these 
days, thanks to the president. Oh, it's been like Christmas all year 
'round. Anne McDermott, CNN, Los Angeles.
