The judge driving efforts to bring former Chilean dictator Augusto 
Pinochet to Spain to face trial on Thursday completed the criminal 
indictment of the aging general who is currently detained in Britain 
pending extradition proceedings. Judge Baltasar Garzon indicted Pinochet 
for crimes committed during his virulently anti-Communist 1973-1990 
regime that began with a bloody coup against elected president Salvador 
Allende. Garzon also asked for a freeze on the former dictator's world 
assets. Earlier Garzon charged Pinochet with genocide, torture and 
terrorism in the deaths of more than 3,000 suspected political dissidents 
during his rule, but it is not clear if he was indicted Thursday on 
all of the same charges. The indictment came the day after British 
Home Secretary Jack Straw ruled that extradition proceedings against 
the general could continue. Legal experts expect it will be several 
months or even years before it is finally decided whether Pinochet 
will be extradited. The 83-year-old former despot was arrested on 
Oct. 16 while recuperating from minor back surgery in a London clinic 
on a warrant issued by Garzon, who sought to question and extradite 
Pinochet. The arrest and subsequent indictment are backed by evidence 
in two years of Spanish judicial probes into government human rights 
abuses in Chile. The victims included Spaniards.
