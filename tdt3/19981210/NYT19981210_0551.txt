In an about-face he had struggled for weeks to avoid, Gov. John Rowland 
acknowledged Thursday that some terms of his stadium deal with the 
New England Patriots were too generous, and he said he would seek 
changes before the state legislature takes up the proposal on Tuesday. 
Rowland, who negotiated the deal in secret and then defended it even 
as sports economists called it the biggest giveaway in the National 
Football League, suggested Thursday that he was an innocent bystander. 
``Some of us may feel that it's a little sweeter than we would like 
it to be,'' he said. ``There will be some negotiations, and I think 
we'll probably make some changes between now and Tuesday.'' The revisions 
being demanded by lawmakers could substantially change the contract, 
leading to a potential clash between state leaders and the Patriots' 
owner, Robert Kraft, who until Thursday had been working closely together. 
``My responsibility is to the legislators, and I want them to feel 
comfortable in this vote,'' Rowland said. Although legislators have 
become increasingly vocal in their doubts about the plan, legislative 
leaders still express confidence that the package will win approval. 
The governor announced his plans for renegotiations the day after 
a hearing in which legislators peppered Kraft with demands for concessions 
in the agreement, particularly a passage that provides a state guarantee 
for as much as $17.5 million a year if luxury suites and seats go 
unsold. Kraft held his ground in front of the television cameras on 
Wednesday. But state officials said they believed he might accept 
modest changes that would help them save face with their critics. 
But legislators are prodding Rowland to go after the issue that Kraft 
has indicated may be the least negotiable. ``There are substantive 
concerns that legislators have, and if we make some changes in the 
guarantee, I think it makes it more palatable,'' Rowland said. ``Clearly, 
the issue has come down to the guarantee. For the majority of the 
legislators, they would probably like to see the guarantee changed 
slightly.'' He said he had not broached that subject with Kraft, but 
said he planned to in the next 48 hours. On Wednesday, Jonathan Kraft, 
a Patriots vice president and Kraft's son, said, ``The guarantees 
are black and white.'' Robert Kraft would be free to walk away from 
the tentative agreement if even the slightest change were made to 
it. Team officials declined to comment on Thursday's developments. 
But Jonathan Kraft and another Patriots vice president were scheduled 
to resume negotiating at the Connecticut Capitol on Friday, and the 
two postponed a series of satellite interviews they had scheduled 
with Hartford media outlets to explain the tentative agreement. After 
the Legislature's leaders met with the governor for three hours Thursday 
afternoon, they said they were pleased that he planned to contact 
Kraft in an effort to renegotiate the guarantees. But the Senate president, 
Kevin Sullivan, said: ``That is a very tough nut to crack.'' Later, 
he added, ``At this point, I'm not optimistic, but we're crossing 
our fingers. It's a tough sell.'' Andrew Zimbalist, a sports economist 
at Smith College who contends that Connecticut could have made a much 
more modest proposal and still landed the Patriots, said the changes 
proposed by Rowland would do little to make the deal more equitable. 
``Taking about 10 or 15 million dollars out of the pot is silly,'' 
he said. ``You could take $100 million out of the pot and still make 
it a good deal for Kraft.'' Zimbalist, who attended Wednesday's hearing, 
said Kraft's comments had contained no information to reassure lawmakers 
about the original proposal. ``I think legislators are beginning to 
get the sense that they don't have to give him the sky to get him 
to come,'' Zimbalist said. ``Why would anyone walk away from the richest 
deal in NFL history?'' The last straw for many legislators was a report 
released on Wednesday by the General Assembly's nonpartisan Office 
of Fiscal Analysis showing that the stadium could cost taxpayers as 
much as $323 million over 30 years. The governor's estimate, on the 
other hand, had been that the stadium would make a profit of $3 million 
over that period. On Thursday, the Legislature's leaders took a step 
that they said would greatly improve the financial outlook for the 
project. They agreed to use at least $100 million of the state's expected 
$350 million budget surplus as a down payment for the stadium. ``This 
radically changes the debt,'' Rowland said. He released figures Thursday 
indicating that under this new plan, the stadium would show a profit 
of $396 million over that time. The most powerful legislator who has 
declined to sign on to the stadium deal is the House Majority Leader, 
Moira Lyons, a Democrat of Stamford. She said the use of the surplus 
``makes it much more cost-effective for everybody.'' The hasty changes 
were intended to appease lawmakers like Rep. Robert Farr, a Republican 
from West Hartford, who was so alone in the early days of sounding 
the alarm about the potential risks of the stadium that he said he 
felt like ``the designated driver when everyone is saying, `Let's 
party.''' Not anymore: Farr said he discovered dozens of kindred spirits 
among his colleagues at Wednesday's hearing. ``When everyone got together 
and compared notes, they found there's a lot of people with concerns 
about the costs,'' he said. Despite the negotiations that the state 
hopes to continue with Kraft through the weekend, the legislative 
leaders said they remained wedded to voting on Tuesday. The House 
speaker, Thomas Ritter, even indicated it was one bit of leverage 
the state had in the bargaining. When asked about the difficulty of 
persuading Kraft to reduce the state payments for empty seats, Ritter 
said, ``That's why we have deadlines.''
