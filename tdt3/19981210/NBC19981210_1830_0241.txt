This is a monumental political battle, and the stakes could not be 
higher for all parties. The presidency and history's judgment all 
the principals are on the table. NBC's David Bloom is at the White 
House, where the president's team launched a late counter attack. 
Tom, tonight as the president and his staff lobby for censure and 
against the impeachment, the president's lawyers charge the republican 
case today for impeachment is based upon quotes innuendo, anger and 
unfair unsubstantiated charges. Let me make just one plea to the members 
of the House of Representatives on behalf of the president of the 
United States. Before you vote to impeach and remove the president, 
read the defense. And then be guided by your conscience and your judgment 
as to the national interest. As the president was greeted today by 
well wishers -- Hang in there, bubba! -- his spokesman embraced a 
democratic alternative to impeachment which condemns Mr. Clinton for 
making "false statements" about his relationship with Monica Lewinsky. 
But even there, the White House hedged. What are the false statements 
the president now acknowledges that he made? Well, I think he -- I 
-- he believes that he made misleading comments. I know he made misleading 
comments. I'm saying, "what are the false statements?" Well, uh, I 
-- I'd have to go back and look at the record. The White House said 
it was disappointed and saddened by the republicans attack but at 
times have difficulty countering it. Lawyer David shippers pointed 
to the grand jury testimony in which the president claimed he hadn't 
been paying attention last January when his lawyer used an affidavit 
from Monica Lewinsky to prove there had been no affair. The tape shippers 
argued shows the president listening intently. There was absolutely 
no sex of any kind in any manner, shape or form with -- The president 
spokesman said it might appear from the videotape that the president 
was listening intently he swears that he was not. There's no proof 
to the contrary. More importantly, the president and his lawyers and 
his advisers ago, none of this is an impeachmentable offense. David 
Bloom at the White House.
