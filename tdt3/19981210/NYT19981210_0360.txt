The sun was setting far, far away, casting a mysterious glow on Ebrie 
Lagoon here. From her villa, Vanessa Toualy, a former hostess for 
Air Afrique, watched the sunset with rather sad downcast eyes, for 
she did not know that the athletic and dashing Christian Magou was 
thinking of her. A gin and tonic in his hand, Christian stood in front 
of a bay window in his bachelor pad in Deux-Plateaux. He gazed longingly 
at the stars twinkling in the sky, unable to get Vanessa's bewitching 
smile out of his mind. And so unfolds a scene from ``Un Bonheur Inattendu,'' 
or ``Unexpected Happiness,'' one of the six titles in Adoras, a new 
series of African romance novels believed to be the first of its kind. 
Since their premiere in May, the African Harlequins have become such 
a hit in the Ivory Coast that their publishers are rushing out five 
new books for Christmas. They have also sold well in Senegal and other 
corners of French-speaking Africa, apparently filling what the publishers 
described as a demand for romance novels with African characters, 
themes and settings. In ``Un Bonheur Inattendu,'' Vanessa and Christian 
are Ivoirian yuppies who live here in the fancy neighborhoods of Riviera 
and Deux-Plateaux. Glances are exchanged, not over candlelit French 
dinners, but over plenty of couscous and tchepdiene, a Senegalese 
dish. The backdrop is Abidjan, this country's commercial capital and 
West Africa's most modern city, with skyscrapers and wide highways 
built around Ebrie Lagoon. ``What's great about Adoras is that we 
can experience what's in the books, because they contain scenes from 
our daily lives,'' said Denise Quenum, 34, a physical therapist. ``It's 
like we're living each moment, each location, each name. The books 
talk about sun and rain, not snow and autumn.'' ``In Harlequin novels,'' 
she said, ``there's always a Prince Charming, blond and blue-eyed. 
That was not realistic.'' Empathy is critical to romance novels, said 
Meliane Boguifo, director of the series, which is published by Nouvelles 
Editions Ivoiriennes. So beyond the hero's fair looks, the staple 
ingredients in traditional Harlequins made them unappetizing to many 
Africans. What's so sexy about receiving a fur when the mercury is 
hitting 90, at night, in the cool season? Ms. Boguifo asked. ``And 
we do not understand what is so romantic about a couple sitting together 
in front of a fireplace,'' added Ms. Boguifo, who wrote one of the 
novels, ``Coeurs Pieges,'' or ``Trapped Hearts.'' ``And `she turned 
red,''' she continued. ``We know what it is to have blood rush up 
to your face, but we don't blush.'' Instead, the stories are rooted 
in real trends or incidents. ``Sugar Daddy'' focuses on a relationship 
common in Abidjan, between a female college student and a ``tonton,'' 
an older, rich man. In ``Parfums d'Assinie,'' a student must drop 
out of college when her mother loses her entire stock of cloth in 
a big fire in a market, which actually occurred here last year. Extended 
families, as the anchors of African societies, play prominent roles 
in the love stories. Sex scenes are tame by Western standards, in 
keeping with the heroines, who, as Ms. Boguifo put it, are all ``chaste 
girls who only ask to give love.'' Some local literary critics even 
praised the books as efforts to liberate this country, a French colony 
until 1960, from Western culture. Kinimo Kanga, a critic for a daily 
newspaper in Abidjan, likened the African Harlequins to the publication 
in recent years of African children's books. ``Our children no longer 
talk only of Snow White and Cinderella,'' Kanga said, adding that 
he was surprised that the publishers of Adoras, presumably fearing 
bad reviews, had not handed out free copies. Indeed, the author of 
``Symphonie et Lumiere'' _ the story of a blind pianist who shows 
a Don Juan the secrets of the human heart _ pleaded that only her 
nom de plume, Joelle Anskey, be used. ``I don't want my readers to 
confuse this novel with my other novels,'' she said, adding sadly 
that her potboiler had far outsold her more serious works. Biton Koulibaly, 
who wrote ``Sugar Daddy'' in 15 days and had it published under the 
pseudonym of B. Williams, showed no such reserve. One of the most 
popular writers in the Ivory Coast, especially among women, Koulibaly 
explained with a straight face that his story about the cash-strapped 
student and the ``tonton'' was supposed to be educational. ``One of 
the goals of Adoras is to teach African men how to love,'' Koulibaly 
said. ``Women here have evolved. They want love with one man; they 
want tenderness. Men are behind.'' On a continent where polygamy is 
widespread, Koulibaly, 49, said learning about romantic love was critical 
to African men. Any attempt to Africanize culture on a continent where 
colonial legacies are so fresh is, of course, fraught with contradictions. 
The publishers of the romances, at the same time they advertised the 
fact that these novels were written by Africans for Africans, gave 
their authors exotic pseudonyms, like Carmen Lopez and Christopher 
Hill. A marketing study showed that a clearly African name would give 
the book less credibility, Ms. Boguifo said. Indeed, Patricia Mobeo, 
20, a student, said she hesitated before buying an Adoras. ``Since 
when do Africans write love stories?'' she said. She eventually read 
two and liked them, but purely as a diversion. ``I tell myself that 
when two people are together, it's always out of some self-interest. 
People don't experience romantic love here. Maybe they do over there.'' 
Alima Konate said she did, here. Over a hamburger and Fanta, Ms. Konate, 
30, a computer programmer, told of how she had related to two Adoras 
novels. In ``Cache-Cache d'Amour,'' or ``Hide-and-Seek Love,'' the 
heroine _ a Muslim member of the Malinke ethnic group, like Ms. Konate 
_ finds true love despite a forced marriage. Then there was ``Coeurs 
Pieges,'' the story of Kenza, a woman whose true love returns to her 
after a long, seductive stay in the United States. ``I saw myself 
in Kenza,'' Ms. Konate said. ``She nurtured a love that finally bears 
fruit.'' Back in her village, she confided, when she was still a girl, 
Lancine Konate spent summers at his grandparents' house, across from 
her family's home. But like the man in the novel, Lancine left for 
several years, in his case to study in Montreal. ``The flesh is weak,'' 
Ms. Konate said, ``and when he left, we weren't on good terms.'' But 
like every Harlequin, African or not, things ended happily. She had 
already started using his last name in anticipation of the big day. 
She reached for her soft drink and the diamond sparkled against the 
Fanta.
