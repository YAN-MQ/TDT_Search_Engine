Russia's Cabinet approved a draft of the 1999 budget Thursday, giving 
the green light for a document that calls for printing more money 
and factors in foreign loans that may not materialize. The budget, 
which was approved with unspecified amendments, will now go before 
the lower house of Russia's parliament, the State Duma, said Deputy 
Prime Minister Yuri Maslyukov. Prime Minister Yevgeny Primakov has 
voiced hopes for a quick approval of the trimmed-down budget because 
his Cabinet enjoys broad support in the Duma. ``The budget's advantage 
is that is very austere,'' Primakov said at a Cabinet meeting where 
leaders hashed out the draft. ``And, the essential thing is that it 
is honest. We didn't include spending that can't be covered by revenues.'' 
But Finance Minister Mikhail Zadornov acknowledged that the budget 
includes dlrs 7.5 billion in foreign loans the government hopes to 
receive, but can't count on. The International Monetary Fund and other 
lenders froze a dlrs 22.6 billion loan package after Russia defaulted 
on some of its debts and devalued the ruble in mid-August. The IMF 
has demanded that Russia draw up a sound budget plan as a requirement 
for more loans, and has specifically warned the Cabinet against factoring 
in foreign credits which are yet to materialize. The budget forecasts 
spending of 575 billion rubles (dlrs 29 billion at Thursday's exchange 
rate) and revenues of 474 billion rubles (dlrs 24 billion), according 
to the Interfax news agency. The government expects to cover the 101 
billion ruble (dlrs 5 billion) deficit through loans and printing 
about 33 billion rubles (dlrs 1.7 billion) in new cash. The draft 
budget is based on the average ruble rate of 21.5 to the dollar and 
foresees inflation of 30 percent next year. Many private economists 
see those estimates as unrealistic, and predict the budget deficit 
will be even larger. The ruble has fallen from 6 to 20 against the 
U.S. dollar in recent months, and inflation will be about 70 percent 
this year. Primakov warned government ministers against trying to 
boost spending in their fields, threatening to fire them if they disobey. 
He also said the budget should serve as a ``prelude'' for economic 
growth by creating new incentives for Russia's ailing industries. 
The Cabinet has recently approved a package of bills to lower taxes 
and streamline Russia's convoluted tax system. The bills have been 
sent to the Russian parliament's lower house, the State Duma, along 
with the rest of the budget.
