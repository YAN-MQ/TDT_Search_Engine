Just a brief review of the main story. The house Judiciary committee 
is on the eve of an historic vote on impeachment, really historic. 
Today the committee lawyers laid out their final cases, for and against, 
and both sides used the videotape of the president's deposition in 
the paula Jones case to argue whether the president can be accused 
of perjury. The committee will begin to vote on the articles of impeachment 
tomorrow.
