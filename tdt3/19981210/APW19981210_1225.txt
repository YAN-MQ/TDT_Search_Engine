Parliament passed a controversial reform of the national health care 
system late Thursday despite sharp criticism from doctors, who fear 
the cuts will hurt them in the pocketbook. Chancellor Gerhard Schroeder's 
left-leaning government argued the cuts, expected to total up to 4 
billion marks (dlrs 2.4 billion) next year, are needed to avoid an 
increase in already high contributions to the national health insurance 
system. The reforms include limiting annual increases in doctors fees 
starting Jan. 1 to average raises in other fields, and cutting payments 
for prescription medicine, which have been rapidly rising. The government 
argued the law also helps patients by lowering deductibles on prescription 
drugs. But thousands of doctors took to the streets this week to protest 
the fee caps. German medical association president Karsten Vilmar 
told German radio the reforms would lead to health care rationing 
and more patient deaths _ a charge Health Minister Andrea Fischer 
called ``sheer impudence.''
