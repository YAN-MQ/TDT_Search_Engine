Saying that some of the proposed impeachment charges hinged on conflicting 
``he-said-she-said'' versions of what went on between President Clinton 
and Monica Lewinsky, Democrats stepped up their efforts to undermine 
Ms. Lewinsky's credibility Thursday, citing inconsistencies in her 
accounts of the affair and her taped statement to Linda Tripp that 
she had lied her entire life. It was the second consecutive day in 
which Democrats sought to raise questions about Ms. Lewinsky's reliability 
in recalling elements of her relationship with the president. And 
it left Clinton and Democrats fighting impeachment in a delicate position, 
not wanting to be seen as attacking the 25-year-old former White House 
intern but intent on challenging her veracity over critical details 
like where and how the president touched her during their sexual encounters. 
Abbe D. Lowell, the counsel for the House Judiciary Committee's Democrats, 
said during his two-hour presentation to the committee Thursday that 
if the House voted to impeach Clinton for lying under oath about where 
he touched Ms. Lewinsky, it might require that the former White House 
intern testify before the Senate in detail about their relationship. 
``Such a he-said-she-said drama, if you really want it, would also 
have to include questions into the inconsistencies in Ms. Lewinsky's 
testimony that the independent counsel seems to ignore in his referral,'' 
Lowell said. Lowell cited statements made by Ms. Lewinsky to friends 
that the Secret Service had brought the president to her apartment 
and that she had sex with Clinton in the Oval Office without any clothes. 
Lowell cited testimony by Bayani Nelvis, a White House steward, that 
Ms. Lewinsky had claimed the president had invited her to Martha's 
Vineyard while Mrs. Clinton was away. And Lowell said Ms. Lewinsky 
had told job interviewers that she had lunched with the first lady, 
who had offered to find her a place to live in New York. Lowell said 
none of those events cited by Ms. Lewinsky had happened. ``But that 
type of embellishment would require scrutiny in a Senate trial,'' 
he said. Judy Smith, a spokeswoman for Ms. Lewinsky, declined to comment 
Thursday. Lowell did not present any evidence that Ms. Lewinsky had 
lied when she told the grand jury that Clinton had touched her in 
intimate ways that would fit the definition of sexual relations used 
in the deposition given by Clinton in the Paula Jones case. Clinton's 
denial of a sexual relationship with Ms. Lewinsky in that deposition 
is at the heart of the perjury charges in the impeachment resolution 
the Judiciary Committee took up Thursday. But Lowell argued that inconsistencies 
in Ms. Lewinsky's accounts of the relationship in general left the 
House short of the ``threshold of evidence'' needed to send to the 
Senate charges based on statements by Clinton about the ``nature and 
details'' of his involvement with Ms. Lewinsky. Lowell also played 
for the committee a segment from a conversation taped by Linda Tripp 
of Ms. Lewinsky saying that she was ``brought up with lies all the 
time.'' In the taped conversation, Ms. Lewinsky recounts how she had 
to make up stories to get money from her father, how her mother had 
always lied to her father, how her mother had helped her sneak out 
of the house. ``I have lied my entire life,'' Ms. Lewinsky says on 
the tape. Rep. Lindsey Graham, R-S.C., accused Clinton during the 
House Judiciary Committee's hearing on Wednesday of encouraging aides 
to leak stories last January about Ms. Lewinsky being unstable and 
a sexual predator. Charles Ruff, the White House counsel, immediately 
denied the accusation, saying a ``very careful and well-considered 
decision was made to do our damnedest to insure that in fact no such 
personal attack was ever made.'' A few hours later, however, Judiciary 
Committee Democrats released a statement saying that Ms. Lewinsky's 
memory had been affected by prescription drugs _ a contention that 
an associate of Ms. Lewinsky's denied _ and that she had repeatedly 
been untruthful.
