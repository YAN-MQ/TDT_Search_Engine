Stocks fell sharply Thursday as investors continued to react to warnings 
from major companies that earning and sales reports would be disappointing. 
The latest retreat amounted to 167.61 points on the Dow Jones industrial 
average. It spared no major index as investors appeared to seize on 
a combination of unsettling developments as a reason to lock in profits 
from what still shapes up as a fourth straight year of an exceptional 
advance. Besides corporate ``confessions'' or downgrades by analysts 
involving the likes of Merck, J.P. Morgan, Coca-Cola and Procter &AMP; 
Gamble this week, investors were said to be disturbed about a Federal 
Reserve Board survey showing less vigorous retail sales, and the prospect 
of an impeachment trial for President Clinton. Dazed to some extent 
by success, particularly in the Nasdaq market that made two record 
highs this week, investors ``may be locking in gains before the end 
of the year,'' suggested Timothy Morris, the chief domestic strategist 
at Bessemer Trust. And while impeachment is still far from topic A 
among investors, Morris and others said many people seemed nervous 
that the proceedings remained unresolved even though Clinton's removal 
from office is widely thought to be unlikely. One measure of the market's 
skittishness is the pounding taken by Merck shares, down 5 11/16 Thursday 
and 6 3/4 on Wednesday, after the company projected earnings next 
year of $4.85 to $4.95 a share, compared with a Wall Street consensus 
of $4.97. The shares closed Thursday at 146\. ``That's a bit of an 
overreaction,'' said Philip Orlando, the chief investment officer 
at Value Line Asset Management. On Thursday an analyst at Paine Webber 
downgraded the United States' second-biggest drug company, Bristol-Myers 
Squibb, to neutral from attractive, and the stock slumped 4 5/8, to 
123. The Dow's third straight decline, 1.86 percent, meant that the 
blue-chip average has retreated 532 points, or 5.68 percent, from 
the peak it hit the Monday before Thanksgiving. After Merck, the biggest 
pressure on the average Thursday was from IBM, down 4{, to 165; Minnesota 
Mining and Manufacturing, off 3\, to 74{, and J.P. Morgan, down 2 
13/16, to 101 3/8. Only three of 30 components _ American Express, 
Union Carbide and AT&AMP;T _ eked out gains. The selling pressure 
embraced computer, software and even Internet companies, which had 
been strong recently. Internet losses, however, were mostly small, 
and Ebay, which has been experiencing some system bugs, stood out 
with a gain of 6 19/32, to 186 1/8. Overall, the Nasdaq market fell 
34.46 points, or 1.68 percent, to 2,015.96, while the Russell 2000, 
which is made up of small-capitalization stocks, fell 1.36 percent. 
The Standard &AMP; Poor's 500-stock index, widely used as a benchmark 
by professional managers, fell 18.47, to 1,165.02. This decline, 1.56 
percent, left the broad index ahead for 1998 by a little more than 
20 percent, compared with 11.8 percent for the Dow industrials and 
28.4 percent for Nasdaq. The Russell 2000, by contrast, was down 9.27 
percent. Despite the downdraft, two initial offerings did well. Infinity 
Broadcasting climbed to 23 1/16 from 20{, while Abovenet surged to 
16} from 13. On the New York Stock Exchange, declining issues swamped 
advancing ones 2,118 to 943, while new lows edged new highs 75 to 
72. Volume was a moderate 760.95 million shares.
