Lawyers for the former military ruler of Chile, General Pinochet, 
have begun new legal moves in Britain to stop his extradition to Spain. 
As James Reynolds reports from Santiago, the Chilean government is 
considering new moves to bring the general back to Chile. President 
Frei is now coming under increasing pressure from supporters of General 
Pinochet, who make a powerful minority in Chile, to take a tough stance 
against Britain and Spain. The opposition here has called for the 
British and Spanish ambassadors in Chile to be expelled, but the government 
has rejected this. The government is also thought to be against the 
inquisition of any former trade sanctions; Britain and Spain are important 
export markets for Chile, and any trade boycott would affect Chile 
more than it would affect Britain and Spain. James Reynolds, BBC News, 
Santiago.
