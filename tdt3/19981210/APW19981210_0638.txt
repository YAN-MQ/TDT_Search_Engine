City officials trying to make the Tomb of the Unknown Soldier more 
accessible to foreign tourists apparently don't know something themselves 
_ how to proofread English. An English-language plaque put up at the 
war monument in downtown Warsaw a month ago has several errors, while 
two other plaques, in Polish and German, appear to be error-free. 
``It is a shame,'' said Wayne Rentoul of Townsville, Australia, who 
stopped at the monument Thursday while touring Warsaw with his wife. 
``It shows a little disrespect because it is a very important place.'' 
The Tomb, established in 1925, includes a coffin with ashes of an 
unidentified Polish soldier killed during the 1918 Polish-Ukrainian 
war and urns with soil from 14 other historic battlefields. Foreign 
dignitaries on official visits routinely place wreaths at the monument, 
the site of state celebrations of Poland's Independence Day on Nov. 
11 and Constitution Day on May 3. Most of the errors appear to be 
typographical. ``The Tomb of the Unknown Soldier marker the place 
where the Poles' aspiration to independence and freedom bah pursued,'' 
is written in elegant brass on the English-language plaque. It also 
mentions the ``fifficult'' post World War II era and later incorrectly 
spells patriotic as ``patriotio.'' Krzysztof Mazurek, a spokesman 
for the Warsaw provincial governor, said the problem was being addressed, 
but he was unable to say when the plaque might be replaced. Poland 
is one of three former Soviet bloc countries invited to join NATO 
next year. One of the major requirements for bringing the Polish military 
into conformance with NATO standards is better English-language skills 
for officers and soldiers.
