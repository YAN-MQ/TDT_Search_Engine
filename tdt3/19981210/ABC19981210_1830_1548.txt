Finally from us this evening the art of the cell. In this case, "the 
cutting edge" technology which enables us to see the latest gimmick 
in here is ABC's Ned Potter many timed 77 baby, baby 7777ab and you 
think, those ncers aroo wait a minute. They're not that good. So you 
flip the channel. And you realize things are freezing in half the 
commercials on TV -- whether it's horses or kids or lovers. And you 
ask, "how did they do that?" How did they do that? Well, sit back 
and get comfortable, because, at first, the explanation may have you 
throwing up your hands in confusion. Pretty cool, don't you think? 
I'm being photographed here by a film technique called time track, 
which makes it look as if a camera's moving around me while I'm frozen 
in place. It's basically just a new thing for our brains to perceive, 
and that's the main reason it's interesting to us. Dayton Taylor is 
the New York filmmaker who invented time track, and here's how it 
works. Regular movies are a succession of still pictures, shot one 
after another, played fast enough to give the illusion of motion. 
Time track is just the opposite. Instead of one camera shooting 24 
pictures a second, Taylor's built a ring of cameras that go off at 
once. So every one of these lenses is taking a picture of the object 
at the same instant. At the same instant, but from a very slightly 
different angle. So when we did our little stunt a minute ago, Dayton 
and his crew shot 80 pictures of me. They were scanned into a computer 
-- I'm going to try to stabilize the eyeball. -- to create one smooth 
sequence of a frozen moment. Ad agencies love it. Dayton and his competitors 
are cranking out commercials. Ction! Because freezing the action, 
they hope, will make you remember the watch or the can of beer or 
the cell phone. At least until you go out and buy it. Ned Potter, 
ABC News, New York.
