Many of our local FM and medium-wave affiliates are about to take 
a two minute break. On VOA News Now. We want to tell you that we have 
more ways than ever for you to listen to VOA. Increasing numbers of 
satellite systems, cable networks, and local FM and medium-wave frequencies 
are carrying VOA News Now. To add to our broadcasts on short-wave. 
Now we're netcasting 24 hours a day on the Internet. Most new computer 
systems have the memory and sound capability to be able to link up 
with our netcast. Just log onto the Internet. And visit our website. 
If you have some paper and a pen or pencil, you might want to reach 
for it. So you can jot this down. www.voa.gov/newsnow. With News Now 
written as one word. Thank you, Erin. We're coming up on 22 hours, 
Universal time. That means we're closing down all frequencies to the 
Middle East, North Africa, and Europe. Except for 1548 kHz medium-wave 
to the Persian Gulf region. In Europe during the next hour, VOA News 
Now can be heard on WRN1. Via Astra channel 22.
