The number of Americans without health insurance is increasing. A 
new study by the health insurance association of America estimates 
there are 43.5 million uninsured Americans. And it projects that the 
number will grow by about 10 million by the year 2007. According to 
the study, the uninsured aren't getting medical coverage because they 
can't afford it.
