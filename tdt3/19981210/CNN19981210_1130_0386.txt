With another successful space walk under their belts, astronauts aboard 
the shuttle "endeavour" are expected to make space history today. 
The six crew members plan to open a series of hatches and go into 
the two modules docked to the shuttle's cargo bay. When they do, they'll 
become the first people to go inside the international space station. 
Astronauts will do a variety of things, including checking the modules' 
power. Yesterday, two astronauts finished their second space walk 
on the outside of the space station. One more space walk is scheduled 
during "endeavour's" mission.
