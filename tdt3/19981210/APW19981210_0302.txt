A legal challenge by the opposition New National Party to the way 
voters register for next year's national elections was postponed on 
Thursday. The delay, until Feb. 5, gives the government time to prepare 
its case to counter the party's accusation that the registration process 
is unfair and favors the ruling African National Congress. The party 
is asking the Cape Town High Court to declare unconstitutional a requirement 
that all voters must have a bar-coded identity document in order to 
register to vote in next year's elections. Bar-coded identification 
books were first introduced in 1986. But only about 65 percent of 
minority whites, the bulwark support of opposition parties, have the 
proper documents, compared to 80 percent of the country's majority 
blacks. Meanwhile, in Pretoria, another opposition party, the mostly 
white liberal Democratic Party, said in a statement that it would 
also be filing documents to court on Thursday to try to get the rules 
changed.
