The House Judiciary Committee began debating four articles of impeachment 
Thursday night after Republican and Democratic lawyers made their 
final arguments over President Clinton's fate, marshaling videotapes, 
the words of the nation's founders, and competing views of the evidence. 
As the committee began pushing to finish its impeachment inquiry this 
weekend, Speaker Newt Gingrich instructed the lame-duck 105th Congress 
to be ready to return next week. He set Thursday as the date that 
the House could begin considering the impeachment of Clinton. It will 
be only the second time in history that the House would be called 
on to take such a vote. The circus atmosphere that had so often pervaded 
the panel's hearings gave way to grim solemnity, as the 37-member 
committee neared decisions about whether to charge Clinton with two 
counts of perjury, and one count each of of obstruction of justice 
and abuse of power. Republicans say it is certain the committee will 
vote for Clinton's removal from office. The only question is how many 
charges it will approve. Rep. James Sensenbrenner opened the debate 
Thursday night by calling for impeachment. ``I do so with no joy, 
but without apology,'' the Wisconsin Republican said. ``What is on 
trial here is the truth and the rule of law.'' Rep. John Conyers Jr., 
the committee's ranking Democrat, however, warned Republicans that 
they were ``trying to overturn the result of two elections.'' Outside 
the committee room, a fierce struggle was under way for the hearts 
and minds of the two dozen or so undecided Republicans who can swing 
the impeachment vote one way or another on the full House floor. At 
the hearing, most of the day was devoted to the summations of the 
committee's senior lawyers, with the Republican counsel going beyond 
the case to question the president's character and the counsel for 
the Democrats imploring the committee to consider how the nation would 
react to a months-long Senate trial with Monica Lewinsky on the witness 
stand. For the first time, the nation saw excerpts of Clinton's videotaped 
deposition in the Paula Jones case, testimony that has been central 
to the impeachment case. ``Today,'' said David Schippers, the Republicans' 
chief investigative counsel, ``I come to the point that frankly I 
prayed I would never reach. ``It is my sorrowful duty now to accuse 
William Jefferson Clinton of obstruction of justice, false and deliberately 
misleading statements under oath, witness-tampering, abuse of power 
and false statements to and obstruction of the Congress of the United 
States in the course of this very impeachment inquiry,'' he said. 
His lofty tone changed as he went beyond discussing impeachable offenses 
to describe Clinton in scathing terms as a deeply flawed man unfit 
for office. Schippers referred to ``cover stories'' and Clinton's 
``crafty mind'' and his ``lame and obviously contrived'' testimony. 
And he charged that there were ``allegations of possible serious wrongdoing'' 
and of ``probable'' crimes that he could not disclose because of ongoing 
criminal investigations. Abbe Lowell, the counsel for the Democrats 
said he was not defending the president but the sanctity of the Constitution, 
as he argued that the case against Clinton did not justify his removal 
from office. ``From listening to our constitutional scholars, we learned 
that impeachment is like the wall protecting the fort around the separation 
of powers,'' he said. ``The crack you put in the wall today, becomes 
the gash tomorrow which ultimately leads to the wall crumbling down. 
It is that serious.'' Lowell spoke of a ``constitutional quagmire'' 
over ``the definition of sex'' and said impeachment was not used ``when 
President Lincoln suspended the writ of habeas corpus, nor when President 
Roosevelt misled the public about United States involvement in the 
lend-lease program, nor when President Reagan misled the country and 
Congress about involvement with Iran-Contra.'' On Thursday night, 
the White House protested Schipper's presentation. ``We are disappointed 
and saddened that the committee majority brought this solemn constitutional 
process down to a level of innuendo, anger, and unfair unsubstantiated 
charges,'' said Gregory Craig, special counsel to the president. Two 
committee Democrats, Barney Frank of Massachusetts and Zoe Lofgren 
of California angrily compared Schippers' intimations of secret crimes 
to McCarthyism. Hyde signaled Thursday that he would allow a censure 
vote in the committee, but could postpone it until next Tuesday. He 
made clear that he opposes censure. Democrats, who are trying to put 
forward a censure measure in place of impeachment, were looking at 
toughening their own proposals to demand that the president pay a 
fine, in order to draw more Republicans to their side. It was still 
not clear, however, whether Republican leaders would allow a censure 
measure to reach the floor. ``I'm waiting to see what the Judiciary 
Committee reports,'' said Rep. Robert Livingston, the incoming speaker, 
as he sidestepped the question, ``and I'll deal with the procedure 
according to what they report. I've not yet found out what they anticipate.'' 
In presentations Thursday, both lawyers used different parts of the 
same tape to present their contrasting views of the case against Clinton. 
Instructing the committee to ``listen to the president's deceptions 
for yourself,'' Schippers played on large television screens several 
clips in which the president said he could not recall having been 
alone with Ms. Lewinsky in the Oval office. ``Life was so much simpler 
before they found that dress wasn't it?'' Schippers sarcastically 
asked, referring to the blue dress Ms. Lewinsky had saved which contained 
evidence of her sexual relationship with the president. He also showed 
the president watching intently _ staring off screen _ as his lawyer, 
Robert Bennett, read aloud Ms. Lewinsky's false affidavit saying she 
had not had a sexual relationship with Clinton. ``That's absolutely 
true,'' the president affirmed on the tape. On the same television 
screen, Lowell displayed a different segment showing Clinton first 
studying a written definition of sexual relations given him by the 
lawyers for Ms. Jones then listening as those lawyers, his lawyer 
and Judge Susan Webber Wright squabbled over the legal description 
of ``sexual relations.'' Sounding prescient, Bennett complained ``this 
is going to lead to confusion'' and argued that a deposition is not 
supposed to be ``a trap.'' The charges of perjury against Clinton 
stem from his denial that he had sexual relations with Ms. Lewinsky. 
The president's lawyers have argued that the president was not lying 
because he believed that sexual relations meant intercourse, not other 
kinds of sex. Both Schipper and Lowell did more than just argue the 
facts. Faced with public opposition to impeachment, Schippers, a former 
prosecutor, tried to raise fundamental questions about Clinton's character, 
suggesting several times that he simply was not fit to be president. 
He noted that Ms. Lewinsky, then a 22-year-old intern, had never spoken 
to the president before their first intimate encounter. ``Sometime 
on November 15th, 1995, Ms. Lewinsky made an improper gesture to the 
president,'' he said. ``What did he do in response? Did the president 
immediately confront her or report her to her supervisors, as you 
would expect? Did he make it clear that such conduct would not be 
tolerated in the White House? No. That would have been an appropriate 
reaction, but it's not the one the president chose. ``Instead, the 
president of the United States invited this unknown young intern into 
a private area off the Oval Office, where he kissed her,'' Schipper 
said. At another point he charged that the ``president's illegal actions 
constitute an attack upon and utter disregard for the truth and for 
the rule of law.'' And he said Clinton had ``arrogant disdain'' for 
fellow citizens, like Ms. Jones and for the other branches of government. 
For his part, Lowell tried to force the committee to think about the 
prospect of a long Senate trial featuring the entire cast of characters 
of the scandal, from Ms. Lewinsky to Linda Tripp.
