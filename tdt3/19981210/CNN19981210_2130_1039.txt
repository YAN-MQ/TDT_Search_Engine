More and more during the holidays, people are trading in gift tags 
for airline tags and opening suitcases instead of presents. Carolyn 
O'Neil explains in this issue of "working ahead." There's no place 
like home for the holidays. And that's exactly why some families opt 
to leave town. This is the replacement for the ten-foot tree that 
we usually go all out with, because we're not going to be here for 
the holiday. Instead, Carol and Greg Rutherford of Atlanta will celebrate 
christmas with the kids on the ski slopes in crested Butte, Colorado. 
This year, we thought instead of all the gifts and the major money 
spent on toys that they're not playing with two months from now, we'd 
take the money and try to do a family thing that they'd remember forever. 
And leaving home for the holidays, whether you pack ski clothes -- 
There you go. That'll be a good one. -- or beach clothes, is a growing 
vacation trend. Oh, I think it's very big. And resorts generally have 
-- are starting to feature Christmas/new year's packages that include 
some kind of holiday entertainment, perhaps. Winter escape destinations, 
such as Hawaii and the Caribbean, are often extremely busy between 
Christmas and new year's. The travel industry is very interested in 
building up this holiday season market. Part of the reason, of course, 
is that right now is a really dead time of the year for business travel. 
But a great time of year for business travelers to turn back into 
parents, taking the kids on a holiday vacation. Carolyn O'Neil, CNN, 
Atlanta.
