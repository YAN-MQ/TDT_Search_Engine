LAUSANNE, Switzerland (AP) _ UEFA's Executive Committee on Thursday 
unanimously approved the revamped Champions League and UEFA Cup to 
start next summer, a key official of the European soccer body said. 
``The financial distribution has still to be fine tuned but the basic 
principles have been set,'' UEFA General-Secretary Gerhart Aigner 
told reporters. These would be finalized in the next two to three 
months, he said. The competitions were restructured to counter the 
threat of the breakaway ``Super League and ratification means this 
current season will be the last for the European Cup Winners Cup, 
which has been contested annually since 1961. ``We will make a fine 
tuning, but we are very confident that next season ... we will start 
with the new competition,'' Tognoni said. ``It was a very good day 
for European football.'' Europe's top clubs have endorsed plans for 
a new 32-team Champions' League and a new UEFA Cup, which will merge 
the existing UEFA Cup and Cup Winners Cup. But the starting date, 
setup and financial structure of the new competitions remain to be 
approved by the Executive Committee. The Super League project was 
launched earlier this year by the Milan-based marketing company Media 
Partners, which said that new pay-per-view TV rights would boost annual 
revenues for Europe's leading clubs. As the plans gained momentum 
with secret meetings of the leading clubs, UEFA, which has run European 
soccer since 1954, threatened to suspend clubs and players who joined 
the Super League. It also set up a task force, involving senior executives 
of European leagues and clubs as well as UEFA officials, to examine 
the future of European club competitions. UEFA came up with a new 
Champions League format which it expects will generate some 800 million 
Swiss francs (dlrs 570 million), with three-quarters of the proceeds 
being distributed to clubs. Though falling far short of the Super 
League's promised revenues, UEFA insists its prize money is guaranteed. 
The competition will be expanded from 24 teams to 32, playing in eight 
groups of four in the first stage. The first- and second-placed teams 
from each groups would advance to a two-leg, single-elimination second 
round before the quarterfinal stage. Third-placed teams would be given 
another chance in the UEFA Cup, entering that competition in its third 
round. The proposed UEFA Cup would start with 96 teams, the same number 
as the two competitions it will replace.
