As we've said, at the Judiciary committee vote goes as expected, there 
will be a real battle for the heart and mind for the House of Representatives 
as a whole. Today Newt Gingrich in his waning days as house speaker 
told members to be ready for a final impeachment debate next Thursday. 
That is not much time for the White House to turn some heads. So there's 
a major under way now to have the president cen red instead. ABC's 
Sam Donaldson is at the White House. Peter, it's a sign of how much 
the president is reaching out for a way to avoid impeachment. Today, 
for the first time, White House officials came close to embracing 
precise language of a censure resolution that would be acceptable 
to the president. Language democrats intend to offer in the Judiciary 
committee. Designed to be passed by both houses of Congress, this 
resolution contains such phrases as "violated the trust of the American 
people" and "dishonored the office." It says, in part, "be it resolved 
that the president made false statements concerning his reprehensible 
conduct with a subordinate. The president wrongly took steps to delay 
discovery of the truth. The president remains subject to criminal 
and civil penalties. And, by his conduct, has brought upon himself 
and fully deserves the censure and condemnation of the American people." 
The president would have to sign it as an acknowledgement that he 
accepts it. Press secretary Joe Lockhart -- This seemed to meet the 
criteria as a reasonable people moving forward as a Way to end something 
that's done in good faith. The committee is expected to vote no to 
censure, but that resolution could form the draft basis for one on 
the house floor next week, but there are two points to remember. Peter, 
we don't know at the moment whether the republican leadership will 
allow a censure floor vote and, secondly, if they want the president 
to sign something they'll have to make the deal in advance. If he 
should win the impeachment floor vote without it, he's not going to 
be interested in cooperating afterward on censure. Sam Donaldson at 
the White House.
