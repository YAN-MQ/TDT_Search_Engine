In a dramatic and direct challenge to U.N. weapons inspectors, an 
official of Iraq's ruling Baath Party declared Thursday that U.N. 
teams would not be allowed to enter a party office they tried to inspect 
a day earlier. If they return, ``they won't enter,'' Latif Nsayyif 
Jassim, a member of the party's leadership, told a news conference 
on the steps of the two-story, stucco building in Baghdad. The U.N. 
inspectors, who are carrying out an intensive week of searches in 
Baghdad and elsewhere, insist they have the right under U.N. resolutions 
to search any site without conditions. The United States has threatened 
to attack Iraq unless it complies. A team of 12 inspectors was turned 
back Wednesday from the regional office of the party _ one of four 
in the capital. The team was asked for a written declaration of what 
they sought, said the Iraqi News Agency. They refused and left the 
premises, it said. The chief U.N. weapons inspector, Richard Butler, 
condemned the move, calling it ``a blockage.'' The United States has 
said it remains ready to attack, and a British Foreign Office spokesman 
called the problem over the inspections ``a serious concern.'' ``Iraq 
has undertaken to provide full cooperation. Its response so far is 
not, in our view, consistent with full cooperation,'' he said Thursday, 
speaking on customary condition of anonymity. The office in contention 
is a slightly unkempt building behind black gates in the neighborhood 
of Adhamiya, near the Tigris River. Its windows are barred with iron 
grates. No signs are outside, but a party emblem sits above the door, 
and a large portrait of Iraqi President Saddam Hussein stands near 
the main entrance. Jassim, in black beret and olive drab uniform, 
insisted that the office was private property and it was his decision 
on whether anyone could enter. He said the party dealt with political 
matters _ and not the weapons of mass destruction U.N. inspectors 
are seeking. ``My base is protected, and no one can enter except a 
party member or an Iraqi national,'' said Jassim, a former information 
minister who is the Baath Party chief in Baghdad. If they try to return, 
he said, ``the answer will be the same.'' ``There is no justification,'' 
Jassim said. ``Nor will you find by entering anything inside that 
is banned or prohibited.'' Jassim's comments were the latest in mixed 
signals coming out of the leadership in the Iraqi capital. Just a 
day earlier, Iraq's oil minister, Lt. Gen. Amer Mohammed Rashid, who 
has been a top weapons negotiator, said Iraqi escorts were wrong in 
declaring the site sensitive. That seemed to suggest the U.N. team 
should not have been barred. Iraqi newspapers carried the official 
agency report on the incident Wednesday. But surprisingly, no newspaper 
mentioned it in editorials, the usual arena for fierce criticism of 
inspectors. In Amman, Jordan, Deputy Prime Minister Tariq Aziz said 
Thursday that Iraq had given the U.N. inspectors ``another chance.'' 
But, he warned, ``Iraq as a people and a leadership cannot accept 
to bear the responsibility of the Special Commission continuing to 
flood us with lies and secondary details which do not accomplish the 
awaited results by easing sanctions on our people.'' ``They want sanctions 
to stay with us forever,'' Aziz was quoted as saying by the Iraqi 
news agency. Earlier Thursday, a full contingent of inspectors resumed 
searches of suspected weapons sites. As many as 140 inspectors on 
regular teams are working in Iraq as well as teams of experts that 
have arrived in past weeks. All together, they number a little less 
than 200. ``Everyone's gone out today, attempting to carry on their 
normal activities,'' said Caroline Cross, the inspectors' spokeswoman. 
``We're just carrying on with our scheduled activities.'' Cross said 
the teams had made no changes in their routine. ``There is no reason 
why we should stop,'' she said. She declined to say whether U.N. teams 
would try to re-enter the contentious Baath Party site. The inspectors 
must certify that Iraq has dismantled its chemical, biological and 
nuclear weapons, long-range missiles and programs to build them before 
the U.N. Security Council will lift an oil embargo and other sanctions 
imposed after Iraq invaded Kuwait in 1990. The sanctions have devastated 
Iraq's economy.
