Former Chilean leader Augusto Pinochet is due in a London court Friday. 
To hear the official ruling that he can be extradited to Spain. But 
his lawyers have already begun the legal battle to block it. VOA correspondent 
Laurie Cassman reports from London. Mr. Pinochet's arrival in court 
will be his first public appearance since he was arrested last month. 
While recovering from back surgery in a London clinic. The court will 
set a date for the extradition hearing. But the legal battle to block 
extradition has already begun. Mr. Pinochet's lawyers are appealing 
the House of Lords' ruling two weeks ago. That the former Chilean 
leader is not immune from prosecution. It was that decision that opened 
the way for his possible extradition to Spain. In Madrid, the Spanish 
judge who issued the arrest warrant has officially charged the 83 
year old former general. With crimes against humanity. He also has 
asked for a freeze on Mr. Pinochet's assets worldwide. To prevent 
his family from hiding funds that could be used to pay fines if the 
case does go to trial. Laurie Cassman, VOA News, London.
