Body artist, extreme masochist, HIV-positive gay man, heavily tattooed 
freak, former heroin addict, onetime grant recipient from the National 
Endowment for the Arts and thorn in its side (after a 1994 performance 
at the Walker Center drew complaints), Ron Athey has turned his life 
into the most radical kind of performance art. In his collaborations 
with a traveling troupe of self-described outcasts, Athey swirls his 
experiences into mock-Christian rituals. In one he is ecstatically 
tormented with a crown of thorns consisting of hypodermic needles 
that spill blood across his face as they are inserted into the skull. 
At the moment of insertion, Athey, his eyes rolling heavenward, wears 
an expression of rapturous calm. The crowning is only one of several 
blood-letting scenes in Catherine Gund Saalfield's documentary portrait 
``Hallelujah! Ron Athey: A Story of Deliverance,'' which opens today 
at Cinema Village. This is a movie that is definitely not for the 
squeamish or the sexually prudish. In addition to the blood-smearing, 
the film offers a methodical catalog of advanced sexual kinkiness, 
with scenes of piercing, bondage, branding, flogging, enemas and dildos. 
As Athey tells it in a disarmingly boyish manner, he was born an extremist, 
having been raised by a Pentecostal grandmother to be a prophet. Anyone 
who is brought up in such an extremely devout environment is probably 
bound to have a hyperdeveloped sense of good and evil, of Jesus and 
the devil locked in perpetual combat. When Athey flashes a sly grin 
and widens his blue eyes, you have the sense of a performer taking 
pleasure in being the naughtiest little boy in the world. Athey's 
performance art is admittedly a desperate act. As an HIV-positive 
man, he insists he wants to make the most creative use of whatever 
time he has left. And his performances take body art about as far 
you can go, short of suicide and actual dismemberment. The most disturbing 
excerpt from his work shown in the film is a section from ``Martyrs 
and Saints,'' in which impassive white-robed ``doctors and nurses'' 
brutally parody invasive medical procedures. Athey lacks the wit of 
the late Bob Flanagan, whose masochistic demonstrations were the subject 
of last year's memorable documentary film ``Sick,'' a much more intimate 
exploration of similar material, minus the religious iconography. 
Are Athey's performances art or psychodrama? They're both, of course. 
Sacred or profane? Again, both. With their emphasis on visceral and 
spiritual extremes, they're also blatantly obvious attempts to shock. 
The most revealing statement Athey makes is an offhanded voice-over 
comment heard at the very end of the film. ``Which came first, the 
evangelist tent or the circus tent?'' he muses. ``Sometimes there 
isn't any difference.'' PRODUCTION NOTES: `HALLELUJAH! Ron Athey:
