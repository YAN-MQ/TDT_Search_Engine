In Israel, just two days before President Clinton is due to arrive 
in the Middle East, more violence rocked the West Bank. In the last 
week, almost 300 people have been hurt. Two have been killed. Israeli 
soldiers were ordered to tear down posters put up by right-wing israelis 
opposed to Mr. Clinton's visit.
