The first people entered the international space station Thursday, 
beginning an era that in a few years should lead to permanent human 
occupation of the mammoth research outpost 250 miles above the Earth. 
Astronauts aboard the U.S. space shuttle Endeavour, slowly working 
their way through a series of hatches, entered the first part of the 
station at 2:54 p.m. Eastern time, emphasizing the international nature 
of the project. Marine Col. Robert Cabana, the commander, entered 
the U.S.-made Unity connecting module with Russian astronaut Sergei 
Krikalev at his side. More than an hour later, they entered the Russian-made 
Zarya module side-by-side in a gesture of international cooperation. 
``We just can't wait to see the outcome of what we started,'' Cabana 
said, ``I just see us in the embryonic stage of this. It's just a 
small beginning, and it's only going to grow.'' The six-member shuttle 
crew entered the first two sections of the station, checking air pressure 
and quality, and turning on lights. After posing for pictures, the 
astronauts turned on systems and detached components stored in the 
modules. ``A very significant and almost momentous event,'' said lead 
flight director Bob Castle from mission control at the Johnson Space 
Center in Houston. It will take 16 nations, led by the United States 
and Russia, five years to complete the station, expected to cost $40 
billion to $60 billion just to construct. The finished station will 
weigh almost a million pounds and will cover an area the size of two 
football fields. For now, the station comprises two segments and docking 
adaptors weighing 70,000 pounds and towering seven stories above Endeavour's 
cargo bay. The station has come alive since Endeavour joined the two 
modules Sunday and the astronauts took two space walks in which they 
connected outside power and data lines and deployed equipment. The 
astronauts remarked on how spacious the empty Unity passageway module 
felt as they entered and inspected its clear, bright white and yellow 
walls and hatches. Zarya also looked shiny and new, but not as spacious. 
It resembled a corridor, with instrument compartments on both walls 
and storage lockers on the ceiling and floor. The modules will be 
the home of Krikalev, who is to return aboard a Soyuz spacecraft in 
January 2000 as part of the first three-member crew to live on the 
station. The Endeavour crew started about a day and a half of commissioning 
work on the station, including removing panels and hundreds of bolts 
and pins used to stabilize the sections during launching. The crew 
also was to set up a communications system, connecting internal components 
with two antennas placed outside Unity on Wednesday. Krikalev also 
was charged with replacing a component of one of Zarya's storage batteries, 
which has not functioned properly since the craft's launch Nov. 20. 
Endeavour carried a spare battery current converter unit, an electronic 
device that helps charge batteries from the craft's solar power cells.
