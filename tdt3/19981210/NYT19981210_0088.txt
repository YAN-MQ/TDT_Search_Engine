Dr. Ruth Westheimer was having a ``teachable moment'' _ her third 
in 15 minutes. Her size 4 patent-leather pumps were planted in the 
everyday green carpet of an out-of-the-way storeroom at Christie's, 
the New York auction house usually thought of as prim, proper, perhaps 
even prudish _ anything but an 88,000-square-foot erogenous zone. 
What had the relentlessly chirpy sex therapist sounding giddy was 
a palm-size piece of reddish terra cotta, an 1,800-year-old oil lamp. 
It was probably nothing special when it was made: the first-century 
equivalent of a mass-produced table lamp with a three-way bulb. More 
Macy's than Louis Comfort Tiffany. Macy's might think twice about 
selling this Roman lamp, though. It shows people having sex. Christie's 
_ which has sold everything from Napoleon's hair to Madonna's bustier 
to General George Custer's railroad pass, not to mention countless 
Monets, Matisses and Picassos _ has no such qualms. The trove of ancient 
erotic art it plans to sell on Thursday includes dozens of objects 
made between 500 B.C. and 400 A.D. that cannot be described in detail 
in a family newspaper. There are couples coupling and single guys 
who would be the envy of modern-day single guys _ and who could have 
been bigger scene-stealers than the one in last season's sculpture-class 
episode of ``Ally McBeal.'' If only they had lived another 2,000 years. 
Some of the terms Christie's uses to describe these items in its 80-page 
catalogue do not appear in most dictionaries. Quick: What is a symplegma? 
``This is an exciting departure from our usual sales,'' G. Max Bernheimer, 
the head of Christie's antiquities department, declared with martini-dry 
understatement. (By the way, he learned the word symplegma from a 
Brooklyn Museum catalogue entry describing a group of intertwined 
figures.) Cataloguing erotica has spared him those awkward you-do-(italics)what(end 
italics)-at-work conversations at dinner parties. ``My wife would 
say, `Tell them about the collection,' '' he said, ``and I'd be talking 
about sex and positions with people I'd never met.'' Which was pretty 
much what he did with Dr. Westheimer, the Sorbonne-trained psychologist 
who became a kind of cultural icon in the 1980s. The Sister Wendy 
of sexuality, she ushered in the new age of freer, franker talk about 
sex on radio and television _ and was endlessly parodied for her limitless 
enthusiasm and for having an accent only a psychologist could have. 
When she heard about the sale, she volunteered _ begged would not 
be too strong a word _ for a show-and-tell session with Bernheimer. 
As so often seems to happen with Dr. Westheimer, it began with her 
doing the showing and telling. Minutes after she sailed into Christie's, 
she handed Bernheimer a copy of a coffee-table book called ``The Art 
of Arousal'' (Artabras, 1993). She said she had written it with an 
art historian from a major museum _ ``a real scholar.'' But the art 
historian's name is nowhere on the title page. The museum did not 
want him associated with anything so racy, she said. Besides, she 
knows the material herself. ``Ruth Westheimer did her homework,'' 
she declared. ``I was ahead of Christie's.'' But now Christie's has 
Dr. Westheimer punctuating every sentence with the word fabulous, 
which she pronounces the way she did on the radio: ``FAH-buh-luss.'' 
Of course, there are no microphones or on-the-air signs in Bernheimer's 
storeroom, only floor-to-ceiling shelves packed with Greek and Roman 
statues. Near the door is a 17-inch-long bronze lion's head. Nothing 
prurient there; Christie's says it is worth at least $180,000. On 
a table in the center of the room were the items that had Dr. Westheimer 
talking about ``teachable moments.'' She was so intrigued when Bernheimer 
handed her Lot No. 103, a Roman terra cotta figure of a woman (nude, 
except for a garland in her hair and her large round earrings), that 
she dropped No. 152, a Babylonian plaque with a lovemaking scene. 
``I like that she's not a la Hollywood,'' Dr. Westheimer said of the 
woman in No. 103. ``She's a little plump. She's not embarrassed. She's 
posing for the sculptor not as a come-on, but for herself. Not for 
the benefit of a man. The perfect role model.'' Also on the table 
were several phalluses. ernheimer expects a fourth-century one made 
of limestone to go for $1,000 to $1,500. Before he could say anything 
about a somewhat older glass beaker in the shape of a phallus or a 
gnomelike Egyptian figurine from the fourth century B.C., Dr. Westheimer 
delivered her by-now familiar size-does-not-matter lecture. ``The 
term that seems to be favored is macrophallic,'' Bernheimer said when 
she finished. ``Means big?'' Dr. Westheimer asked. Bernheimer blushed. 
Believe it or not, Bernheimer's preview had a serious side: he wowed 
Dr. Westheimer with scholarly erudition. Before Hugh Hefner, Calvin 
Klein ads for leave-nothing-to-the-imagination jeans and Howard Stern, 
the Egyptians, Romans and Greeks thought nothing of showing elements 
of eroticism, from flirtation and seduction through consummation. 
Of course, 20th-century curators are descendants not only of the Romans 
and Greeks but of prudish Victorians, who relegated ancient erotica 
to unseen back rooms in the Naples Museum, the Museum Secretum within 
the British Museum and the Museum of Fine Art in Boston (a turn-of-the-century 
Boston benefactor enjoyed shocking the bluebloods, Bernheimer said). 
``In this context it is not surprising that Egyptian erotica were 
for the most part passed over in silence,'' Bernheimer writes in the 
sale catalogue, ``and as a result, there is little in the literature 
on this subject.'' Roman literature, Bernheimer noted, told more. 
Ovid reported in the poem ``Tristia'' that wealthy Romans' houses 
were decorated with erotic images. Those images are surprisingly valuable 
today: Various bronze and terra cotta depictions of Roman fertility 
gods have estimated values of $3,000 to $7,000. Lot No. 88, a gold-and-onyx 
cameo earring ($4,000 to $6,000) showed a scene that fascinated later 
masters like Leonardo da Vinci: Leda and the swan. Given the unusual 
nature of the material, the estimates may be more off than pre-sale 
values often are. ``It's supply and demand, and we don't know what 
demand will be,'' Bernheimer said. A plain Roman lamp would go for 
$200, he said, but he is betting that one with an erotic image will 
command five to eight times that. Dr. Westheimer said that the image 
on one such lamp might have provided inspiration for a husband whose 
wife might once have looked like the figure on the lamp. ``Now she 
is fat after children,'' she said. ``This shows him a Playboy model.'' 
And a playmate of eternity at that. ``In this case,'' Bernheimer said, 
``the Playboy model is Aphrodite, after her bath.'' Next Bernheimer 
brought out No. 38, another Roman lamp with an estimated sale price 
of $2,500 to $3,500. ``A foursome,'' he said. Dr. Westheimer looked 
at it through a magnifying glass. ``All right,'' she said. ``Three 
men for her. Not bad.'' Bernheimer cloaked his reply in history. ``There 
are depictions of even more from the suburban baths at Pompeii,'' 
he said. Dr. Westheimer moved the magnifying glass closer. ``Amazing,'' 
she said. Bernheimer said, ``In my field, scholarship tends to look 
at her as a prostitute.'' Dr. Westheimer nodded. ``Probably,'' she 
said. ``An adulteress would be killed.'' Bernheimer moved on to Lot 
No. 79, perhaps the most valuable in the sale, a pair of bronze bedpost 
fittings. Bernheimer told Dr. Westheimer that the woman has lost her 
head. Literally. ``That would present a problem for me,'' she declared. 
``You need the brain. The brain is the most important aphrodisiac.'' 
A pause, then her refrain: ``I could use this for a teachable moment.'' 
So it went for another hour or so. As she left Bernheimer's storeroom, 
she said that looking at erotic art was not itself erotic. Indeed, 
her only moment of unexpected passion (no, not (italics)that(end italics) 
kind of unexpected passion) came in a corridor when, after saying 
goodbye to Bernheimer, she passed a burly-looking mover pushing a 
statue that looked like Rodin's ``The Thinker.'' ``Rodin?'' she declared. 
``Stop! I want to touch it.'' The mover stopped. She placed her hands 
on the top of the statue. And then, satisfied, she left for lunch.
