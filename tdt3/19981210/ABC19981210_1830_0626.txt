The brand new international space station had its first visitors today. 
Five American astronauts and one Russian left the comfort of the shuttle 
"Endeavour" and went inside. "You've opened the doors to a whole new 
era," said mission control. Here's ABC's James Walker. The astronauts 
have been building the space headquarters of the future for three 
days now. Today, armed with a portable spotlight, mission commander 
Bob cabana and russian cosmonaut Sergei kreekelev floated from the 
space shuttle "Endeavour" into unity, becoming the first occupants 
of the American component. An historic moment, but for a moment they 
lost the TV signal to earth. It's unbelievable. If you've got live 
coverage, look at the volume Sergei is floating around in. We are 
so pleased and excited and proud to be part of the team. With that, 
they started installing communications equipment and air ducts, the 
astronaut looking like a handyman tightening a bracket. Then, with 
the air pressure equalized in the Russian Module, the crew moved into 
the command center. We'd just like to take a moment to commemorate 
an historic moment in space exploration. They also brought in tools 
for future astronauts to use, and clothes for them to wear. We have 
a lot of work to do. We're gonna get back to work. And lots of work 
they have. Construction will take another five or six years, but when 
it is finished, this office building should be longer than the statue 
of liberty is tall. James Walker, ABC News.
