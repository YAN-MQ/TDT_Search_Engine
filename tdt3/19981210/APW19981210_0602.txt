Switzerland's first Jewish president plans to be more outspoken toward 
the United States and Jewish organizations over World War II issues, 
she said in an interview Thursday. ``I have always refused to speak 
as the token Jew of our government,'' said Ruth Dreifuss, elected 
Wednesday by parliament to the one-year presidency for 1999. ``It 
will be different in my role as president, which gives me much clearer 
legitimacy.'' ``It's an opportunity I intend to seize both in this 
country and abroad,'' she said. Dreifuss was quoted by the daily Le 
Temps saying she previously held back comments on the search for the 
assets of Holocaust victims in Swiss banks during the past 3 1/2 years, 
when international Jewish organizations and the U.S. government have 
heavily criticized Switzerland. Her portfolio has been that of interior 
minister, responsible for issues like health and social security in 
the seven-member coalition Cabinet that tries to govern by consensus. 
She said the election gave her ``a great chance'' to contribute to 
the debate about neutral Switzerland's role in World War II and its 
efforts to repair any wrongdoing the Swiss committed toward Nazi victims. 
Dreifuss said she had read more about the Holocaust than other Cabinet 
members, and that her personal and family history had given her special 
insight. Dreifuss was born in 1940, soon after the outbreak of World 
War II, to a Swiss Jewish family. She said she could empathize both 
with the 27,000 Jewish refugees allowed into Switzerland and the 30,000 
who were turned back during the war. Dreifuss has said she thinks 
the Swiss government should compensate Jews who were sent back. The 
Nazis sent many of the returnees straight into concentration camps. 
A ``moving moment in our encounter with the past'' will come next 
spring when an international panel of historians appointed by the 
Swiss government reports on the wartime refugee policy, Dreifuss said. 
``I will have to comment on it, to launch the debate,'' she said. 
``It will also give me a chance to explain better to Jewish organizations 
where they are totally justified and legitimate in their demands and 
where they are less so.'' She said she knows the United States and 
the way the international Jewish community functions better than her 
colleagues. Dreifuss, also the first woman to be president, said, 
``the election of a Jewish female president of the confederation demonstrates 
that what would have been impossible just a few years ago has become 
normal.''
