Once the Judiciary committee is done with its work on articles of 
impeachment, chairman Henry Hyde has promised a vote on a motion to 
censure President Clinton. Charles Bierbauer looks at that option. 
Censure offers a way out for those in Congress, mostly democrats, 
who think impeachment too harsh for President Clinton. Three democrats 
on the Judiciary committee propose a "sense of the congress" resolution 
that -- William Jefferson Clinton has violated the trust of the American 
people. Now if only some republicans will join them. We are reaching 
out to moderate republicans. We are also reaching out to conservative 
republicans and all Americans. Because we feel that this document 
provides a foundation for a meaningful end to this sorry chapter in 
our country's history. May Congress censure a president? There is 
no prohibition on censure in the constitution. Back when the constitution 
was still fresh, Congress censured andrew Jackson but later rescinded 
it. Should Congress censure Mr. Clinton? Fairness dictates that the 
American people not be muzzled on the all-important issue of censure. 
The public sees it as an option. In a recent CNN poll -- one web site 
calling itself "censure and move on" claims over 300,000 petition 
signatures. But what kind of censure? It's got to be censure with 
fangs. It cannot be censure-light. One of the president's designated 
defenders proposed more than censure. There could be an agreement 
to pay a fine. This is something tangible, more tangible than censure. 
Even if the president were willing to pay, there's a Constitutional 
problem with Congress levying a fine on the president. But no problem, 
warning him that censure does not get him safely out of the woods. 
The democrats' draft resolution also says -- "the president remains 
subject to criminal and civil penalties for this conduct." The constitution 
speaks only to impeachment, but constitutional experts seem to agree 
Congress may censure a president if it chooses to. Though censure 
has little legal impact, it may have considerable political weight.
