Another Iranian dissident writer was reported missing Thursday, the 
third in the last month, adding to concerns that critics of the government 
are becoming the targets of violence and intimidation. The two writers 
who had previously disappeared were both found dead in mysterious 
circumstances, and associates of the latest missing man, Mohammad 
Jafar Pouyandeh, said they believed he had been killed. Pouyandeh, 
a 45-year-old author and translator, disappeared after he left his 
Tehran office on Wednesday afternoon, just hours after the body of 
Mohammad Mokhtari, a dissident and poet who was reported missing last 
week, was identified. Iranian newspapers reported Thursday that Mokhtari 
had died of suffocation, and one of them quoted a relative saying 
his body bore bruises around the neck. The disappearances come at 
a time of heightened tensions between President Mohammad Khatami, 
who has been promoting reforms, and conservative forces in the Islamic 
government who have been the main target of the secular opposition. 
Pouyandeh and Mokhtari were among six prominent writers who were questioned 
about their activities in October by a Revolutionary Court. The six 
were trying to reactivate a banned writers' association that had previously 
been the target of government harassment. Another member of that small 
group, Houshang Golshiri, said in a telephone interview Thursday night: 
``We feel that this is being done by those who have information. They 
have our address, and they know where and when we leave the house.'' 
Golshiri said the incidents struck him as an unsettling echo of what 
occurred in 1994, after he and more than 130 members of the writers' 
association signed a letter that called for an end to censorship in 
Iran. Five of those who signed that letter were killed or died soon 
afterward in circumstances that have never been fully explained. The 
next summer, 30 members of the group who were traveling by bus to 
a poetry conference in Armenia narrowly escaped death in what one 
of them, Mansour Koushan, described in a recent interview as an assassination 
attempt by the Iranian authorities. Golshiri would not say Thursday 
night whom he believed responsible for the death of Mokhtari and the 
disappearance of Pouyandeh. But he said, ``I believe this is the continuation 
of the story of the bus.'' Pouyandeh disappeared somewhere between 
his Tehran office and his home, which are just two miles apart. A 
relative said the family had contacted police, hospitals and the city 
morgue, but had found no trace of the missing man.
