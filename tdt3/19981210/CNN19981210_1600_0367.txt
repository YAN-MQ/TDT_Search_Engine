NASA is boldly going back to where no astronaut has been before, the 
red planet. As John Zarrella tells us, it hopes to launch its red 
mission to Mars tomorrow. Mars once had water, the one basic ingredient 
scientists say is necessary for life. The question for them now is 
-- where did it go? This is really the search for where all the water 
went we think once existed and flowed on the surface of Mars. It's 
gone somewhere. 26 months after launching its wildly successful Pathfinder 
spacecraft, NASA is about to return to Mars. The first vehicle to 
go is called the climate Orbiter, followed in early january by a lander 
heading for Mars' South Pole. There are really no instruments on either 
the Orbiter or the lander on this particular mission that are geared 
toward looking for life. They are looking for the things that could 
possibly support life. That being water. The Orbiter will spend two 
years surveying how the Martian atmosphere works, from temperature 
and pressure to actual weather patterns on the surface. It will be 
able to detect if there are cold fronts moving through the areas. 
It will also watch for dust activity. We know that Mars is sort of 
like the dustbowl in the U.S. The Orbiter should reach Mars next September. 
The lander arrives in December. Improved cameras will send back better 
images than Pathfinder's. By turning the lights on one at a time, 
we get a green picture, a blue picture and a red picture. We'll but 
them together and make a true color picture afterwards. The lander 
is also equipped with a scooper that will dig up soil and analyze 
it. Scientists say these spacecraft may provide the first concrete 
evidence that water once flowed on Mars. John Zarrella, CNN, at the 
Kennedy space center in Florida.
