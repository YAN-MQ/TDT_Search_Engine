And I'm Tony Riggs. Along with Erin Brummet. This is VOA News Now. 
Leaders of non-democratic states sometimes choose to develop their 
military might at the expense of their people's welfare. Such was 
the case in the Soviet Union and the Warsaw Pact states. Today, western 
policy analysts suspect North Korea is doing the same thing. Increasing 
its military arsenal rather than feeding its starving people. North 
Korea, Guns, or butter? is the subject of today's edition of Dateline. 
Here's Pamela Taylor. North Korea is constructing nuclear facilities 
with weapons-making potential. U.S. intelligence agencies believe 
the facilities could be used to store banned nuclear equipment. The 
two governments have agreed to continue talks on U.S. demands for 
access to the suspected underground nuclear site. VOA's Kyle King 
has more from the State Department. The talks, which began in New 
York last week. Have focused exclusively on U.S. demands for access 
to a suspicious underground site. U.S. officials fear the site could 
be in violation of a 1994 agreement that pledged North Korea to give 
up its nuclear weapons program. In exchange for U.S. energy assistance 
and food aid. North Korea says the site is for civilian purposes. 
But has rejected any U.S. inspection. Talks on the site come amid 
a review of U.S. policy toward North Korea. Former U.S. Defense Secretary 
William Perry is visiting the region as part of that review. During 
a stop in South Korea, Mr. Perry held talks with President Kim Bejung. 
Who called for an easing of U.S. sanctions on North Korea. State Department 
spokesman James Foley says the United States will study the proposal. 
But has no plans to ease sanctions on North Korea. U.S. officials 
say they continue to have serious concerns about North Korea's missile 
program. In particular, the transfer of missile technology. To countries 
such as Iran, Seria, and Pakistan.
