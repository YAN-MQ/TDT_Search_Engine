Impeachment impending? Peace taking a plunge? If Bill gets the blues 
during his Mideast tour, he can drown them in diet cola, soak them 
in Dead Sea salts _ even blow them away on a courtesy sax. President 
Clinton is arriving Saturday for a three-day tour of Israel and the 
Palestinian areas, as the Wye River accord he brokered is collapsing 
under increasing violence _ and his hotel wants to make sure that 
his nights, at least, are soothing. The entire Jerusalem Hilton, overlooking 
Jerusalem's walled old city, will be given over to Clinton, his family, 
and an entourage of 600 people. Omer Lany, his butler-to-be, showed 
off the alto saxophone Thursday, clasping its mother of pearl keys 
delicately with white-gloved hands. According to the Hilton, it's 
the same make the president uses at home, a Proi E.M. Winston. Also 
included in the loan are mouthpieces and a shoulder strap _ just in 
case Clinton forgets his own. He can play it on the balcony, while 
contemplating a skyline dotted with church spires, mosque domes, and 
red tiled roofs peeking over the Old City walls. He might want to 
ignore a reminder of one of the more controversial items on the peace 
agenda _ three cranes overlooking a building site. Jews and Arabs 
are scrambling to populate the city they both claim. If he prefers 
a cozier approach, he can coat himself in complementary beauty products 
made from the muds surrounding the Dead Sea. The outsize free-standing 
bath is surrounded by white roses _ Clinton, the hotel has learned, 
is allergic to most other flowers. The shower has jacuzzi jets. The 
mini-bar is stocked with his favorite beverage _ Diet Cola. Whatever 
he does, he won't be able to avoid the city he's in. The walls are 
lined with 19th-century etchings of Jerusalem; the amphoras and oil 
lamps are Roman-era knock-offs. For bedtime reading, he has a range 
to choose from: biographies of former Prime Minister Shimon Peres 
and Foreign Minister Moshe Dayan; histories of Israel and the Jews; 
picture books showcasing the city built by Kings David and Herod _ 
both men who let their lust alter the course of world history ... 
Then again, he may prefer ``The Book of Jewish Humor.''
