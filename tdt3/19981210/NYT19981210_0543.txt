As he presides over the Judiciary Committee's Democrats, speaking 
in a deliberative cadence, Rep. John Conyers Jr., the ranking minority 
member, projects a quiet tone and almost uninterested demeanor. The 
Michigan Democrat, the only Watergate veteran on the committee, has 
shouldered the task of leading the committee's Democrats, a normally 
fractious group credited with never letting a view go unexpressed. 
And Conyers' loose hand has meant that he seldom reels in committee 
members when their monologues take them in peculiar directions. But 
he remains an important back-room dealer for the Democrats on the 
Judiciary Committee. It was Minority Leader Dick Gephardt who took 
control of the Democratic response last summer and who has remained 
in charge of keeping his caucus together. In private meetings, however, 
Conyers takes the lead in suggesting strategies for minority members 
on the committee and his views often carry the day, colleagues said. 
Conyers' early strategy was to shift the focus from Clinton to Kenneth 
Starr, the independent counsel, when ever possible. Even before the 
Judiciary Committee's inquiry began, Conyers took up the well-known 
list of charges that the prosecutor's inquiry was tainted by leaks 
and ties to conservatives. In his statement to the committee Thursday 
evening, Conyers offered a plea to moderate Republicans to vote against 
impeachment and again criticized Starr for delving into sexual details, 
calling him the ``occasionally obsessive counsel.'' Conyers has argued 
that Starr abused his powers and launched investigations into matters 
best left alone. He has gone so far as to argue that Starr's decision 
to probe Clinton's extramarital affair was worse than Clinton's decision 
to initiate it. The day Starr appeared before the Judiciary Committee, 
Conyers was attacking Starr before the prosecutor had a chance to 
open his mouth. Conyers condemned the referral as ``tawdry, salacious 
and unnecessarily graphic.'' ``It was all that we had in the beginning, 
it was only Starr,'' Conyers said Thursday. ``And his excesses were 
pretty apparent to all.'' Thursday, the Detroit lawyer, whose district 
includes impoverished parts of the city and well-to-do Grosse Pointe, 
made it plain that he is not finished with Starr. He plans to turn 
the committee's attention again to the independent counsel in next 
year's discussion on renewing the statute that created the job. ``The 
methods Starr employed will be studied with great detail long after 
the impeachment process itself,'' he said. Faced with some of the 
most partisan Republicans in Congress on the Judiciary Committee, 
Conyers' task has never been seen as easy or perhaps even possible. 
``Have I failed?'' Conyers said, his voice tinged ever so slightly 
with sarcasm directed toward his Republican colleagues. ``Yeah, I 
failed to persuade any of the 21 Republicans to consider more reasonably 
the fact that even if the whole narrative of Ken Starr's was assumed 
to be accurate, there would be nothing that would reach an impeachable 
offense.''
