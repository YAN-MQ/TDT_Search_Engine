Three Boston-area residents were arrested in a New York-based FBI 
sting aimed at Russian organized crime groups, according to published 
reports. One of the suspects was a BankBoston employee, The Boston 
Globe and the Boston Herald reported today. The papers said the FBI 
investigation was part of an attack on a multimillion dollar drug 
money scheme with ties to Russian organized crime groups. The nine 
people charged, all from Russia or other former Soviet republics, 
allegedly laundered $2.7 million in drug money _ mostly $5, $10 and 
$20 bills _ for undercover agents posing as Colombian smugglers, according 
to indictments unsealed Wednesday. Court papers allege the money was 
laundered through banks in Boston, New York, Antigua and Switzerland 
then drawn out again in check form. A 24-year-old customer service 
representative at a BankBoston branch in West Newton _ Oksana Galchanskaya 
_ was charged with ``processing transactions through various accounts 
while avoiding certain bank and federal regulations.'' Assistant U.S. 
Attorney Steve Huggard said Galchanskaya authorized and issued numerous 
checks, apparently without permission from the ``account holder,'' 
from two of 64 different accounts allegedly used in the scheme. The 
indictment alleges the accounts were ``frequently replenished with 
large wire transfers from accounts in New York and Switzerland.'' 
Galchanskaya is scheduled to appear for another hearing today. Also 
arrested were Roman Luban, 44, and Samuil Lyubomirsky, 41, both of 
Newton, who allegedly received the checks from the two Boston accounts 
and transferred them to bank accounts belonging to the drug smugglers, 
who were actually undercover agents.
