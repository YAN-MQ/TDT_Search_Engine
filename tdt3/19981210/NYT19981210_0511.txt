At the Fashion Square mall in Sherman Oaks, the affluent suburban 
epicenter of California's atomized civic and political culture, the 
sounds Thursday were the voices of Nat and Natalie Cole, singing soothing 
Christmas carols on the loudspeaker, and the solemn business of impeachment 
seemed even farther away than three time zones and 3,000 miles. ``I 
don't think the American people give a damn,'' declared Joan Harper, 
71, a dedicated mall-walker on her morning constitutional with her 
friends, Harriet Klein and Mary Thomas. ``It's boring. I haven't watched 
it at all.'' John Miele, 70, a retired AT&AMP;T worker catching up 
on some Christmas shopping, allowed: ``It's ridiculous. I think he 
should be censured. It's all a big ploy by the Republicans just getting 
back at him. I don't think he did anything to be impeached for. They 
keep nagging at it. It's just ridiculous.'' And Steve Hancock, 51, 
a school bus driver from Pasadena, summed up the prevailing mood, 
saying: ``I'm really getting bored with it. It just keeps rolling 
along. It's gotten to the point where I don't even want to pay attention. 
Each lawyer is just trying to outdo the other.'' As Congress moved 
inexorably toward only the third vote on presidential impeachment 
in U.S. history, shoppers in the San Fernando Valley, to a person, 
knew full well what was afoot. But also to a person, they long ago 
decided they knew all they needed to, and on Thursday they went on 
about their business _ not uninformed, just uninterested. On the late 
local television news here, impeachment does not even make the first 
10 minutes, losing out to breathless reports about a bout of Santa 
Anas, the gusty desert winds of up to 100 mph that Raymond Chandler 
wrote make ``meek little wives feel the edge of the carving knife 
and study the back of their husbands' necks.'' ``I can't tell you 
how little interest there is, except to those of us who follow it 
professionally or personally or both,'' said Pat Caddell, the reformed 
pollster who has worked for politicians as diverse as Jimmy Carter 
and Jerry Brown and now lives here. ``I think it's the weirdest disconnect 
that I have ever seen in American politics between the elected and 
the electorate. ``This really does say something serious about the 
health of the body politic that the American people are not more engaged 
in this,'' he added. ``I think people have just had to deal with too 
much information all year and they think nobody listens to them anyway.'' 
Patt Morrison, a local columnist for The Los Angeles Times with a 
sharp eye for the wry side of Southern California life, said the current 
hearings contrasted sharply with Watergate. ``There, there was some 
new revelation every day,'' she said. ``With this, we knew everything, 
except perhaps the nuances and shadings, from the get-go, and so the 
sense that each successive videotape will result in this tsunami of 
shock and horror turns out not to be the case. We've read the ending 
already.'' ``What it seems to be about is not substance but theater,'' 
Ms. Morrison added. ``And this is L.A. We've got better theater.'' 
Indeed, all year long, voters and viewers have paid intense attention 
to the Clinton-Lewinsky show ``only when the story line changes,'' 
according to Andrew Kohut, director the Pew Center for the People 
and the Press in Washington which has tracked public attitudes about 
the scandal. ``When things have remained in, let's call it the analytical 
or heavy-pundit phase, the public hasn't paid a lot of attention,'' 
Kohut said. ``Over and over again, they've said we've made some judgments 
about this. We don't like him as a person, he's made some terrible 
mistakes, but it's not worth booting him out of office.'' Los Angeles 
City Councilwoman Cindy Miscikowski, who just happened to be waiting 
for the Victoria's Secret to open so she could do some shopping at 
the mall in Sherman Oaks before a morning meeting there, confessed 
that she had been following the hearings, ``very, very closely on 
CNN.'' But she said her constituents show no interest at all. ``It's 
just not on the radar screen locally,'' she said. ``I think people 
are just watching it passed on to the next level, hoping it won't 
go forward. But in these cases, you never know what will happen once 
the process starts.'' Even the prospect that the full House of Representatives 
may well vote to approve articles of impeachment seems only another 
irritant, and one the public feels powerless to stop. ``It wouldn't 
surprise me now,'' said Kermit Eller, 68, a retired engineer, and 
a Republican, who was waiting for his wife to finish an appointment 
at a hair salon in the mall. ``Considering the behavior of the Republicans, 
they seem not to expect ever to have another Republican president, 
or they wouldn't be so ready to weaken the institution this way. It 
troubles me to see them behaving in this irresponsible manner.'' Carrie 
Carlisi, shopping with her 28-month old daughter, Sarah, said she 
catches only snippets of the hearings on MSNBC, and would also no 
longer be surprised at a vote to impeach, but added: ``I think it 
would be pointless and a huge waste of taxpayers' money. I think there's 
some very strong religious right money and pressure behind this.'' 
On Clinton himself, the views were remarkably consistent _ and blunt. 
``The guy's a dog,'' said Alicia Verde, shopping in Sherman Oaks with 
her two-year old daughter, Rory, ``but what he does is up to Hillary. 
He'll have his karma. Hillary will take care of him.'' As it happens, 
Mrs. Clinton was in Los Angeles on Thursday, visiting a historic synagogue 
in Boyle Heights and an old-time movie palace in downtown Los Angeles 
as part of her national ``Save America's Treasures'' campaign to preserve 
historic buildings and sites. At the Farmer's Market in the Fairfax 
District in the middle of Los Angeles, Amy Doering, a 27-year old 
post-production supervisor at the nearby CBS Television City, said 
of the hearings: ``It makes me sick to my stomach. I don't want to 
hear about it, and I don't care about anyone's sex life. It's more 
than understood that the general public is over it.'' Jack Lurie, 
a 92-year-old retired electrical engineer said he had been following 
the hearings _ ``every inch of it,'' as he put it _ and still did 
not believe Clinton's actions warranted impeachment. ``We know this 
is his cup of tea,'' Lurie said. ``I think he's done a pretty good 
job as president, and let him complete his term.'' Suzanne Rubin, 
a 61-year-old photographer and designer from Beverly Hills, said she 
and her friends were glued to the televised hearings while at their 
gym the other night, but said, ``This should have been resolved privately,'' 
and added, ``I think the country doesn't have a say in this. I feel 
like the whole thing is controlled by the committee and Starr.'' In 
Sherman Oaks, the mall-walker, Ms. Harper, doubted that the Senate 
would ever vote to convict Clinton. ``Give me a break,'' she said. 
``I bet you half the senators have done the same thing.'' When her 
friends asked her about the possibility of censure, she dismissed 
that, too. ``What are they going to give him? Twenty push-ups? Like 
the T-shirt says, ``The boat sank: Get over it.''
