After nearly six decades as the undisputed leader of the American 
luxury market, Cadillac is poised to lose its crown to Lincoln this 
year. As of Nov. 30, Lincoln, the luxury division of the Ford Motor 
Co., had sold 170,265 cars and trucks in 1998. That was nearly 7,000 
ahead of Cadillac, which had sales of 163,482 _ mostly cars _ in the 
same period. The gap grew in November, rather than narrowed, prompting 
Cadillac to virtually concede the race. ``We don't know the outcome, 
but we're pretty much seeing the very distinct possibility that Lincoln 
will overtake us in total vehicle sales,'' Chris Preuss, a spokesman 
for Cadillac, said last week. Lincoln has not beat Cadillac since 
1939, according to figures compiled by Automotive News, a trade journal. 
Cadillac's sales were down slightly through November, largely because 
of United Automobile Workers strikes that led to the shutdown of GM's 
North American assembly operations for up to two months last summer. 
But a bigger factor in the sales race was Lincoln's gain of 21,500 
sales over the year-earlier period. Lincoln benefited from a redesigned 
Town Car and especially from its Navigator sport utility; the division 
will sell more than 40,000 Navigators this year. Cadillac's equivalent 
vehicle, the Escalade, only recently went on sale. In cars, Lincoln 
is competing with just two models (Town Car and Continental) compared 
with Cadillac's four (Catera, Eldorado, DeVille and Seville). Production 
of the Lincoln Mark VIII ended in June. The luxury car makers that 
are enjoying double-digit sales increases are doing so largely because 
of sport utilities. After introducing its M-Class utility in late 
1997, Mercedes-Benz is having a record year. Indeed, through November, 
Mercedes trailed Cadillac by only about 9,000 sales. Sales for Lexus 
were up 57 percent, to 139,411. Lexus, a division of Toyota, is selling 
a revamped full-size utility, the LX 470, and a new car-based model, 
the RX 300, which is already the division's best seller. Cadillac 
sales have been steadily declining from their lofty levels of the 
late '70s and mid-'80s when it sold more than 300,000 cars a year. 
GM used to boast that Cadillac outsold all foreign luxury brands combined, 
but that is by no means the case any longer. Susan Jacobs, an auto 
stock analyst , who monitors the luxury market, contends that Cadillac 
has lost its luxury leadership forever, because its product line is 
being overhauled too slowly and its vehicles are not as well focused 
as Lincoln's. Ms. Jacobs also predicted that Mercedes, which sold 
154,457 cars and sport utilities through November, will come out on 
top next year and in the future. Mercedes has a 1999 sales target 
of 200,000 vehicles.
