Lawyers for former Chilean dictator augusto Pinochet went back to 
Britain's house of lords today, hoping to stop Spain's effort to extradite 
him. Mark Austin reports. Outside the home of office today a tribute 
for the victims of the pinochet regime. They laid one for every opponent 
killed during his rule. We are celebrating efb even on their behalf 
because those people who were murdered, who disappeared. But in Chile, 
the union flag is burning. These supporters believe the decision to 
proceed with extradition hearings against the former leader is a political 
one and they're calling for his immediate return. Some were arrested, 
hundreds dispersed with water canon, the country's president has called 
for calm. Tomorrow he's due to appear at this court normally used 
for dangerous criminal and terrorist suspects. But this evening the 
English legal system faces an unprecedented challenge. Pinochet's 
lawyers are asking that the lord rule. They cite revolutions that 
one of the lord lords has links with amnesty international. No one 
is quite sure how to deal with the petition. The government Pinochet's 
lawyers and supporters are determined to fight the extradition process 
every step of the way. Mark Austin, atn, central London.
