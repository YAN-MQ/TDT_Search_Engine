I'm John Burchard, VOA News. Democratic and Republican investigators 
for the House of Representatives Judiciary Committee are giving sharply 
different views. On whether President Clinton should be impeached. 
Democrat Abby Lowell issued a point-by-point explanation to counter 
charges of perjury and obstruction of justice. Republican investigator 
David Shippers is now arguing before the committee. That Mr. Clinton 
did commit such offenses in trying to cover up an affair. The real 
issues are whether the President of the United States testified falsely 
under oath. Whether he engaged in a continuing plot to obstruct justice. 
To hide evidence. To tamper with witnesses. And to abuse the power 
of his office in furtherance of that plot. The ultimate issue is whether 
the President's course of conduct is such as to affect adversity, 
the office of the Presidency. By bringing scandal and disrespect upon 
it. And also upon the administration of justice. The Republican-led 
Judiciary Committee is expected to recommend articles of impeachment 
later this week. Sending the matter to the full House.
