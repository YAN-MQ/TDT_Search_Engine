Betty Martin was examining a plush pony at the Big K store with a 
grandma's appraising eye. What she really wanted, she said, was the 
season's hottest toy, a Furby, ``but I'm not looking for one, because 
I know I won't find one.'' Two weeks ago, in an event repeated from 
Massachusetts to New Mexico, shoppers in Mattoon started gathering 
at 4 a.m. at the Wal-Mart across the parking lot to wait for a chance 
to buy the talking furball that is on thousands of Christmas lists. 
The Wal-Mart in Mattoon had advertised a sale at 6 a.m., but after 
250 people lined up, managers were able to hand out only 58 numbers, 
each giving the right to buy one Furby for $30. Casie Thompson, the 
assistant manager, said the sale ended in 15 minutes, peacefully. 
Not so in Des Moines, Iowa, where Sandy Yingst, 53, and her husband, 
Roger, arrived at 2:30 a.m. to stand first in line at a Wal-Mart sale, 
hoping for a Furby for their granddaughter. When the doors opened 
at 6 a.m., Mrs. Yingst said, ``people started pushing and shoving 
and rushing.'' She was pushed into the door, where her arm was trapped 
and badly bruised before she freed herself. ``I've been through the 
Cabbage Patch, I've been through the Elmo, and I've never, ever experienced 
anything like this,'' said Mrs. Yingst, who left the store sore and 
empty-handed. ``I told my granddaughter, `Grandma tried.' She understood. 
She was upset because I had to go through the pain.'' In O'Fallon, 
east of St. Louis, 13-year-old Kira Wright told reporters she had 
just picked up a Furby when a woman ``took my hand and chomped on 
it.'' Kira, a seventh-grader, told The Belleville News-Democrat that 
the woman held her wrist until she let go. Then the shopper and the 
Furby vanished. The police were also called that day to maintain calm 
in Rantoul, and were brought in by anxious store managers faced by 
large, disappointed crowds in Arlington, Texas, and Lynn, Mass. Two 
shoppers were reported injured in a stampede at a store in Nazareth, 
Pa. The F.A.O. Schwarz store in New York, where the Furby made its 
national debut on Oct. 2, now tells callers, in a recorded message, 
it can no longer take telephone, mail or Internet orders for Furbys, 
as it has exceeded its allocation. But it promised to deliver before 
Dec. 25 all orders placed before Oct. 28. Lana Simon, public relations 
manager for Tiger Electronics, which is based in Vernon Hills, north 
of Chicago, and is now a subsidiary of Hasbro, advises would-be buyers 
to be patient. ``Keep it in perspective,'' she said. ``If you can't 
find it, give your child a rain check.'' In all, Ms. Simon said, 2 
million Furbys _ which ``speak'' 200 words in a language called ``Furbish'' 
and can also squeal, sneeze, snore and sneeze _ will have been produced 
by Christmas. Dr. Gregory Fritz, director of child and adolescent 
psychiatry at Brown University and Rhode Island Hospital, confessed, 
``I couldn't believe people were fighting over toys.'' What children 
want from their parents, he said, is love and affection. Toys are 
only symbols. ``If we forget that, then how much we love our kids 
depends on how much effort we went to, to get them a particular present. 
I think that's nuts.'' For those with plenty of money and no patience, 
Furbys are hot items on Internet auction sites, where bids this week 
were starting at prices ranging from $60 for a gray and white Furby 
to $1,300 for 12 assorted Furbys in a box.
