A Delta Airlines Boeing 767 had to abort a takeoff from Schiphol airport 
Thursday because a KLM Boeing 747 was being towed across the runway. 
Nobody was injured in the incident and the Delta plane was able to 
take off for Atlanta, Ga. a few hours later. Aviation authorities 
immediately launched an investigation into the incident. The Delta 
plane's pilot, who had been cleared for takeoff by air traffic controllers, 
was able to stop well ahead of the KLM jet, according to a press release 
issued by Air Traffic Control Netherlands. The release did not give 
more precise details of the incident, which happened Thursday morning. 
The number of passengers and crew aboard the Atlanta-bound plane were 
not immediately available. The KLM plane had one crew member aboard. 
The incident happened in misty conditions at the busy airport on the 
outskirts of the Dutch capital. Staff in Schiphol's air traffic control 
tower were unable to see the spot where the incident happened but 
were using ground radar to monitor the runways, according to Air Traffic 
Control Netherlands. No more details were immediately available.
