Attorneys for Gen. Augusto Pinochet, seeking to prevent his extradition 
to Spain, appealed to the House of Lords on Thursday to reverse an 
earlier ruling that the former dictator does not have immunity. Attorneys 
also said they might also seek permission to contest Wednesday's decision 
by Home Secretary Jack Straw to permit extradition proceedings. Grounds 
for the appeal were not immediately disclosed. ``Having carefully 
considered all the recent developments, we can confirm we have lodged 
a petition with the House of Lords that the decision of their Lordships 
that Senator Pinochet does not have sovereign immunity should not 
be allowed to stand,'' said Michael Caplan of the law firm Kingsley 
Napley. ``We are also considering applying for leave to apply for 
judicial review of the Home Secretary's decision,'' Caplan added. 
Straw ruled that Spain could seek Pinochet's extradition on charges 
including torture and conspiracy to murder, related to human rights 
abuses in Chile after Pinochet took power in a military coup in 1973.
