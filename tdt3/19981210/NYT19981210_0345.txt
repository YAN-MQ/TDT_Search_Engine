NEW YORK _ ``I am your guardian buzzard,'' declares the actor in black 
plumage. What, you ask, is a guardian buzzard? You'll get no satisfactory 
answer out of ``The Moment of Aha,'' a thumb-twiddling bit of ephemera 
at the Ohio Theater. Although Leslie Nipkow's play is billed as a 
dark comedy, it might be more aptly described as a bad accident. No 
one emerges unscathed. This fitful, hammily acted piece offers up 
the less than scintillating thesis that while camera work is fairly 
straightforward, love is a twisty road. Moving backward and forward 
in the life of Lydia (Missy Hargraves), a New York photographer, the 
play records her sterile suburban upbringing, symbolized by a mother 
who never takes off her oven mitts, and her failure to make a fulfilling 
romantic connection. Among the play's many trivial conceits, the silliest 
is Lydia's relationship with the buzzard, played with offensive smugness 
by Sean Runnette. (Ms. Nipkow hits rock bottom in a vulgar scene in 
which Lydia and the buzzard exchange fatuous observations at the expense 
of a famous prize-winning photograph of a vulture perched near a dying 
African child.) ``The Moment of Aha'' continually mistakes overly 
plotted coincidence for whimsy. In one flashback, for instance, Lydia's 
father (Robert O'Gorman) dies of an allergic reaction to the bats 
he wants to exterminate in his basement. And it completely misses 
the opportunity to take satirical advantage of Lydia's job. She photographs 
vegetables for the pages of Martha Stewart Living, a fact that is 
mentioned only in passing. The visually dexterous director, Richard 
Caliban, who has done well by the works of Mac Wellman and Will Sheffer, 
is at sea with this abstruse material. When all else fails, he has 
the actors move to recorded music, the kind of vapid act that puts 
you in mind of that German variety-show parody on ``Saturday Night 
Live'' in which Mike Meyers would announce, apropos of nothing, ``This 
is the moment on `Shprockets' when we dance!'' PRODUCTION NOTES: `THE
