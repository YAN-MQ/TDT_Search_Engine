The centers for disease control and prevention says 723 Americans 
die each year from excessively cold weather. In a report released 
today, the CDC says from 1979 to 1995, 12,000 people died of hypothermia. 
Hypothermia occurs when the body temperature drops below 95 degrees. 
Doctors say people can help prevent it by wearing layers of clothing 
during the cold months and avoiding alcohol.
