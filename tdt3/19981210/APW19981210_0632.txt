Africa must face up to the problem of its 8 million refugees and bear 
the responsibility, the Organization of African Unity said here Thursday. 
Opening a pan-African conference on refugees, the assistant secretary-general 
of the Organization of African Unity, Daniel Antonio, said host countries 
were experiencing ``fatigue' and donors were suffering ``donor fatigue.'' 
The continent had to ``shoulder its responsibility,'' he said. The 
refugee problem was caused by ``war, internal conflict, human rights 
abuses and natural catastrophes.'' Antonio told the delegates, who 
represent some 40 African states, that they had to find a solution 
to the problem as it was affecting their countries' economic development 
and causing instability. ``Africa has to come up with a new strategy 
for the welfare of all Africans,'' he said. ``This is a big challenge, 
but is is a noble challenge.'' The U.N. High Commissioner for Refugees 
says the approximately 8 million refugees in Africa represent an increase 
of 500 percent over the 1993 figures. Another 15 million people have 
been displaced by war and famine. Sudan says it hosts at least 1.1 
million refugees, mainly from Uganda, Eritrea and Ethiopia. Its government 
complains that foreign aid to the refugees has dropped from about 
dlrs 111 per head in 1985 to a mere dlrs 7 in 1997. ``We are shouldering 
the burden of some 95 percent of the refugees on our soil,'' said 
the Sudanese commissioner for refugees, Mohammed Alagbash, told The 
Associated Press on Thursday. ``This is too much for our resources.'' 
In Eritrea, a spokesman for the main Sudanese guerrilla faction, the 
Sudan People's Liberation Army, said this week it was ironic that 
the conference was taking place in Khartoum, considering the government's 
``bad record on refugees.'' ``The Sudanese government is convening 
an all-Africa conference for refugees while the government has forced 
millions of Sudanese refugees to scatter around the world,'' Yassir 
Arman said in the Eritrean capital, Asmara. The SPLA has waged an 
insurgency since 1983. It is supported by the mainly Christian and 
animist peoples of southern Sudan who seek autonomy from the Muslim 
and Arab peoples of the north. More than 1.5 million people have died 
in the fighting and attendant famines and an estimated 4 million Sudanese 
have been displaced.
