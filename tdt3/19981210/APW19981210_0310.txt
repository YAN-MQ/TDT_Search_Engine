Faced with clear evidence of drug use by former East German athletes, 
Olympic leaders must now deal with the tricky question of whether 
to revise the record books going back 20 years and more. The International 
Olympic Committee opens a four-day executive board meeting Friday 
that will consider petitions seeking redress for American and British 
swimmers who were beaten to gold medals by East Germans. The U.S. 
Olympic Committee is seeking ``appropriate medal recognition'' for 
the American women's relay team which finished second behind an East 
German quartet at the 1976 Montreal Games. The British Olympic Association 
has filed a similar petition on behalf of Sharron Davies, who won 
the silver medal in the 400-meter individual medley at the 1980 Moscow 
Games behind East Germany's Petra Schneider. The precedent-setting 
cases _ based on court evidence in Germany _ will be closely watched 
around the world. They could open the floodgates to numerous claims 
from other athletes who believe they were cheated out of medals. ``The 
issue is: Do we rewrite history? How do we deal with the past?'' IOC 
director general Francois Carrard said. Carrard said the executive 
board is expected to open preliminary discussions on the cases and 
not make any final decision this week. There appears to be no clear 
consensus among IOC leaders on what _ if anything _ to do to acknowledge 
the state-sponsored doping which made East Germany an Olympic power 
in the 1970s and 1980s. Recent studies have revealed that between 
6,000 and 10,000 athletes were covered by a systematic doping program 
that operated in the former Communist country. East German women won 
11 of 13 gold medals in swimming at both the 1976 and 1980 Olympics. 
Six former East German doctors and coaches have been convicted this 
year in Berlin on charges of administering steroids to young swimmers 
without their knowledge. More trials are scheduled. Chances of any 
radical moves by the IOC, such as the stripping of medals or wholesale 
rewriting of results, are remote. Instead, officials may consider 
awarding supplemental medals or certificates or entering an asterisk 
in the record books. ``I don't know what the solution is,'' IOC vice 
president Dick Pound of Canada said. ``Do you start repassing out 
all the medals, in which case you might be giving a medal to someone 
who hasn't been tested? Everybody who got a medal at the time was 
tested, and they tested negative.'' ``And what do you do for team 
sports?'' he said. ``It's just a mess. I don't see any easy cure.'' 
Pound said in an ``ideal world'' the East Germans who admitted using 
drugs would hand back their medals _ an unlikely scenario. ``That 
would really be the class thing to do _ the truth and reconciliation 
approach,'' Pound said. ``As a matter of ethics, the onus ought to 
be on them.'' That view was echoed by fellow IOC vice president Anita 
DeFrantz of the United States _ a former rower who finished third 
in the coxed eights at the 1976 Olympics behind teams from East Germany 
and the Soviet Union. DeFrantz, who feels certain that her East German 
rivals were on drugs, said she has spoken to many former athletes 
who competed during that era and found no consensus for revising the 
results. ``The basic message I've gotten is: if an East German wants 
to give up his or her medal, then the Olympic Museum ought to receive 
it as testament as to what happened at that time,'' she said. DeFrantz 
said she hasn't decided whether to support the U.S. petition to upgrade 
the medals for the relay team of Linda Jezek, Lauri Siering, Camile 
Wright and Shirley Babashoff _ who finished 6.6 seconds behind the 
East Germans in Montreal. The USOC contends that a recent German trial 
has provided proof that at least one member of the German team _ Andrea 
Pollack Pinske _ was boosted by anabolic steroids. Davies, the British 
swimmer, finished 10 seconds behind Schneider in Moscow. Davies said 
Schneider told her recently that she was on drugs since the age of 
14 and is now suffering from heart problems and other side effects. 
Davies wants the record books marked to reflect that Schneider took 
drugs. ``She would like the record put straight to show that she really 
won that race in 1980,'' BOA president and British IOC member Craig 
Reedie said.
