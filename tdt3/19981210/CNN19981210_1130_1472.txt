It may very well be the only Beatles concert recording where you don't 
hear screaming fans, and it's hitting the auction block today in London. 
The quarter-inch reel-to-reel tape was made by a technician in 1963. 
It was made just two days before the hit single "she loves you" was 
released. The recording is expected to sell for about $45,000.
