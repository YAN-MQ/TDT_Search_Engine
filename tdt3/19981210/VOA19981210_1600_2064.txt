Northern Ireland's Protestant First Minister, David Trimble, and Catholic 
political leader, John Hume, have been awarded the Nobel Peace Prize. 
For their effort to end 30 years of sectarian violence. And broker 
the Good Friday agreement. VOA correspondent Laurie Cassman reports. 
Both men acknowledged during the ceremony in Oslo, Norway that the 
peace they have brokered is still not complete. Protestant leader 
David Trimble used his speech to urge Irish Nationalists to start 
disarming paramilitaries. In order to build trust in their commitment 
to the Peace Process. All I've asked for is that they say that the 
so-called war is over. And that it be proved by such a beginning. 
That is not too much to ask for. Despite the continuing disputes, 
Catholic leader John Hume says there is no turning back. I want to 
see Ireland as an example. To men and women everywhere. Of what can 
be achieved by living for ideals. Rather than fighting or dying for 
them. Mr. Hume and Mr. Trimble accepted their gold medals and the 
$900,000 cash prize at a ceremony at Oslo's elegant city hall. Laurie 
Cassman, VOA News, London.
