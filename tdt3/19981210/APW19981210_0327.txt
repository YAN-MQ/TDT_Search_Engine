China unveiled a 14-year-old diving star at the Asian Games Thursday, 
a day after gymnastics officials were demanding proof that North Korean 
competitors were at least 16. Li Na, in her first serious international 
meet, gave a scare to more experienced compatriot Cai Yuyan before 
Cai sealed the 10-meter platform gold on the final dive. Cai's gold 
added to another from Zhou Yilin in the men's 3-meter springboard 
and gave China a sweep of all four diving gold and silver medals at 
the games. The women's contest was a good boost for Chinese diving, 
which is looking for talent to replace Fu Mingxia, the women's double 
gold medalist from the 1996 Olympics who retired at 19. Li was less 
than two points behind Cai, who clinched the gold with a final dive 
that split the judges. Her scores ranged from 7.5 to one perfect 10, 
giving her a total of 549.57 to Li's 547.80. Li is already locked 
into a life of hard study and long hours of training but says she 
has no concerns about devoting her time to the sport. ``I wouldn't 
do it if I didn't like it,'' Li said. ``I started at 10 years old 
and I don't think I'm too young, I think this is the best age.'' Gymnastics 
officials have banned anyone under 16 from competing at international 
meets but diving is open to anyone 14 or over. The rule was changed 
by governing body FINA after Fu won a world title in 1991 when aged 
just 12. Li understands China's tradition in the event, being a mature 
12 herself when Fu won the 1996 Olympic double. ``She has been very 
encouraging to us and I hope I will be for others,'' Li said of her 
predecessor. She said her goal was to train hard for the Sydney 2000 
Olympics, something that team leader Xue Li will insist on after being 
less than completely happy with China's efforts in 1-2 finishes in 
every event here. ``Our divers' performances are not impeccable, sometimes 
even flawed,'' said Xue. ``If we want to regain our supremacy in the 
world, we have to work hard after going home.'' Zhou also had a close 
battle with a compatriot before winning his gold. He had a superb 
final dive to beat compatriot Yu Zhuocheng by less than four points 
on the 3-meter springboard. Yu hit the front after five of Thursday's 
six optional dives with an inward 3-1/2 somersault with tuck, which 
scored 84.66 points, but Zhou made up a 2.7-point deficit with the 
same dive at the finish. Zhou, the world championship silver medalist, 
scored 712.02 points, with Yu on 708.12. Thailand's Suchart Pichi 
claimed his second bronze after also placing third in the men's platform 
event. China won three gold medals in the four events given status 
at the 1996 Olympics but was unable to win any of those four at the 
world championships in Perth this year. In Bangkok, ``winning these 
golds means nothing to us, for most of other Asian countries lag behind 
the rest of the world in diving and we Chinese divers mainly compete 
against ourselves in the games,'' Xue said. ``But in the world major 
competitions such as the Olympics or the world championships, there 
will be a galaxy of high-echelon divers. Even a small error can cost 
you the gold when you compete against them.'' China has been passed 
by Russians, including 1996 platform champion Dmitry Sautin. But both 
Li Na and women's 3-meter springboard champion Guo Jingjing cite Sautin 
as their hero.
