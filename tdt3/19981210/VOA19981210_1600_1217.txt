A judge in Houston has granted gold medal winning American gymnast 
Dominique Mochiano's request. For a protective order against her father. 
State District Judge John Montgomery ruled that Dimitri Mochiano must 
stay away from his daughter for one full year. Under the terms of 
the order, Mr. Mochiano may not get within 150 meters of Dominique. 
And may only contact her in writing through her lawyer. The 17 year 
old gymnast wept. And admitted it was very difficult to take her father 
to court. But she said in some ways, she still loves him. There is 
a side. And I love my mom and my sister. But -- and there was just 
something I had to do about that. And maybe this time will be a cooling-off 
period. And then one day we will all get back together. But for this 
time, this is what will have to happen. Mochiano's father appeared 
dumb-struck as Judge Montgomery ruled that Mr. Mochiano's recent actions 
constitute family violence under Texas law. The young gymnast accused 
her father of stalking and verbally threatening her.
