Devastating droughts and floods beginning in 1995 have aggravated 
North Korea's problems. And are believed to be responsible for about 
15 percent of the food deficit. Furthermore, there's not enough arable 
land to meet the country's food needs. Even in years of good harvests. 
The agricultural crisis, coupled with North Korea's isolation, have 
led to a situation of widespread hunger and starvation. After visiting 
North Korea last August, a U.S. congressional team estimated that 
as many as two and one half million North Koreans have died from hunger 
over the past three years. A recent survey of nutritional problems 
in North Korea confirms that severe malnutrition is prevalent among 
young children. The survey was conducted by the United Nations Children's 
Fund and the European Union. In cooperation with the North Korean 
Institute of Child Nutrition. VOA's Lisa Schlein, in Geneva, has details. 
The study shows that most of the children surveyed suffered from severe 
malnutrition. While 16 percent were acutely malnourished. The study 
says North Korea's rates are the highest in East Asia. The report 
notes that more than half of the children suffered from chronic malnutrition. 
The director of the World Food Program's Asia Bureau, Judith Chang-Hopkins, 
says the group with the highest account of malnutrition was age 12 
to 24 months. This is the age when children are weaned from breast 
milk. And are thus most susceptible to malnutrition. This is also 
the time in a youngster's life when malnutrition can permanently impair 
physical and intellectual growth. It is important that the government 
takes this into serious consideration. As it has repercussions for 
the future of the country. The survey sample represents more than 
70 percent of the population. The experts acknowledge that child malnutrition 
in North Korea has soared. Despite international assistance. However, 
they say the situation would have been catastrophic without this food 
aid. Lisa Schlein reporting for VOA, from Geneva.
