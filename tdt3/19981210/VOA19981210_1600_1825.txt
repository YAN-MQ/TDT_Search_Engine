I'm Dave DeForest, VOA News. Democratic and Republican investigators 
for the House of Representatives' Judiciary Committee are giving sharply 
different views. On whether President Clinton should be impeached. 
Democrat Abby Lowell said impeachment is not justified. But Republican 
investigator David Shippers said Mr. Clinton repeatedly lied under 
oath and committed other impeachable offenses. In trying to cover 
up his affair with Monica Lewinsky. The President of the United States 
appeared before a grand jury of his fellow citizens. And took an oath 
to tell the truth. We all now know what happened after that. The President 
equivocated. He engaged in legalistic fencing. But he also lied. During 
the course of this presentation, I've discussed several of those lies 
specifically. Actually, the entire performance. And it was a performance. 
Was calculated to mislead and to deceive the grand jury. And eventually 
the American people. The Republican-led Judiciary Committee is expected 
to recommend articles of impeachment later this week. Sending the 
matter on to the full House.
