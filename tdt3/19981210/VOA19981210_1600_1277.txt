In Major League Baseball, star relief pitcher Dennis Eckersley has 
announced he's retiring after 24 years in the Majors. The 24 year 
old Eckersley said he decided to retire after the Boston Red Sox decided 
not to offer him the option of sound re-arbitration. The six time 
all-star is third on the Major League list for career saves of 390. 
He finished his career with a record of 197 wins and 171 losses. And 
a 3.50 earned run average.
