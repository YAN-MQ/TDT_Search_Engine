Richie Woodhall's second defense of the WBC super-middleweight championship 
against Italy's former titlist Vincenzo Nardiello will now be at Newcastle 
on Feb. 13 on a triple-header of world title fights organized by Frank 
Warren. The other two contests will have Joe Calzaghe of Wales defending 
his WBO super-middleweight title against former WBC titlist Robin 
Reid and Herbie Hide putting his WBO heavyweight crown on the line 
against Orlin Norris from Texas. Woodhall, who took the title from 
South Africa's Thulane ``Sugar Boy'' Malinga in March, should have 
fought Nardiello two months ago but the Italian pulled out with a 
calf injury. Instead the British fighter struggled to a points victory 
over fellow countryman Glenn Catley and was convinced he had lost 
the fight.
