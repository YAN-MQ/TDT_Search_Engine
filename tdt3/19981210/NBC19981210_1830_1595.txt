In the American southwest, it appears there's a guerilla war under 
way -- maybe a one-man war. Maybe more -- against one of nature's 
most dramatic creatures, the wolf. In this case, the Mexican Gray 
wolf, a symbol of the southwestern wilderness missing from the wild 
for years. Now it is being re-introduced. Four more will be released 
tomorrow. But as NBC's Roger O'Neil tells us, there's a suspicion 
someone wants these wolves to disappear again. He seems anxious to 
get out, and tomorrow he'll be free again. A rare Mexican Gray wolf, 
one of the few survivors from a group of 11 animals released in March 
along the Arizona/New Mexico border. How's the wolf? Doing good. Federal 
officials say someone is sabotaging the wolf recovery program here. 
In just four months four animals are dead, two more are missing and 
feared dead. Despite a $50,000 reward by the government and environmental 
groups there have been no arrests. Who would want to kill the wolves? 
Ranchers hate the animal, but federal authorities caution it's also 
been hunting season and wolves do look a little like coyotes. Ranchers 
aren't really worried about the wolf as a predator. They already live 
with mountain lions, coyotes and bear. It's the addition of one more 
animal that bothers them and the wolf is being forced down their throats. 
And they're being told the animal they despise has a "protected" place 
here. One of the first things we saw when this wolf program was introduced 
here was hundreds of yellows signs that said "keep out." Sam luce 
has ranched here for 25 years. You can't live with something that 
destroys your lifestyle. Luce's dog was killed by a wolf. Other ranchers 
have had sheep and cattle harassed. Federal officials are taking extra 
time now to keep ranchers up to date on wolf activity. We're going 
to be letting them out soon. Interior secretary Bruce Babbitt says 
the killings hurt but returning wolves to the wild will continue. 
There's no way we can give a couple of criminals a veto power over 
something that 90% of the American people support. For the next several 
months, officials plan to release more wolves, including this mother 
and her pups. There will be one big difference when this wolf is released 
tomorrow. Its collar and rear legs will be spray painted a bright 
orange to make sure everyone knows its a wolf. Roger O'Neil, NBC news, 
Alpine, Arizona.
