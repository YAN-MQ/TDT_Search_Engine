Another deal that could reshape an industry, the planned merger of 
Exxon and mobil is part of our series of reports on the ten biggest 
business stories of the year. We look at an historic year for the 
oil industry. Even when the United States and Iraq were on the brink 
of war, oil prices didn't budge. In fact, through most of 1998, oil 
prices were in a freefall, dropping 40% to levels adjusted for inflation 
not seen since the early 1970s. Oil demand in the developing countries, 
in Asia, is down substantially. Compared to increase every year in 
previous years. So you talking about the swing of maybe 1 million 
barrels a day. OPEC's lack of political muscle prevented cuts in production. 
The result, with light sweet crude at $11 a barrel and profits at 
risk, exxon and mobil the two biggest oil companies in the United 
States, decided to join forces in the biggest merger ever. Today's 
announced combination does not mean that we could not survive on our 
own. This is not a combination based on desperation. It's one based 
on opportunity. The real opportunity created by the oil glut wasn't 
for oil companies but for American motorists. Gas prices slipped as 
low as $1 a gallon. Helping to promote a love affair between the drivers 
and gas-guzzling sport utility vehicles.
