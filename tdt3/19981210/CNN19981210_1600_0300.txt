Iraq's ruling party says U.N. weapons inspectors will not be allowed 
to search its headquarters in Baghdad. U.N. monitors, hoping to make 
a surprise inspection, were turned away from the ba'ath party offices 
yesterday. A party spokesman says inspectors will not be permitted 
in the building, because there is no banned material inside, and therefore, 
a search would be unjustified. U.N. officials say their normal inspections 
are continuing today across iraq. Defense secretary William Cohen 
says Iraq is still subject to a U.S. military attack at any time, 
but the Clinton administration intends to wait until the inspections 
are finished, before deciding what to do.
