International donor countries said Thursday they are releasing funds 
to support Uganda's three-year development program after receiving 
assurances that the government will fight corruption and limit its 
defense expenditure to planned budget allocations. A statement read 
to reporters said nearly dlrs 2.2 billion will be committed to Uganda 
through 2001. Dlrs 830 million of the amount will be budget support 
for the 1998-99 fiscal year, the statement said. A World Bank-led 
consultative group of donor nations and multi-lateral lending agencies 
has been holding discussions in Kampala since Monday. Representatives 
of donor countries and lending agencies have expressed concern about 
corruption and defense spending, but according to the document, they 
are satisfied with commitment expressed to address the two issues. 
``We came to the meeting concerned about corruption, attended the 
meetings concerned and are leaving the meeting concerned but convinced 
that the government has a time-bound program to fight corruption,'' 
said World Bank director for Uganda and Tanzania James Adams, who 
chaired the meeting. ``Donors have become increasingly concerned that 
in many sectors and at different levels of society, corruption remained 
a serious problem that required urgent action. A number of projects 
have been undermined by lack of financial discipline and weak procurement 
practices,'' the donors' statement said. On Thursday, President Yoweri 
Museveni, embarrassed by rampant cases of corruption in which millions 
of dollars in donor funds have disappeared in the hands of implementing 
officials _ particularly in the agriculture sector _ said he would 
fight corruption to the extent of hiring foreign experts, including 
judges. Donor representatives reportedly expressed concern that Uganda's 
involvement in the conflict in neighboring Congo could push defense 
spending over budgeted limits. ``While recognizing the regional and 
internal security issues that confront Uganda, donors saw a risk that 
pressures for higher defense spending could undermine Uganda's record 
of micro-economic stability or divert government resources from priority 
expenditures in education, health, roads and agricultural extension,'' 
the statement said. Uganda, which has been receiving aid to support 
more than 50 percent of its annual budget, has had an average growth 
rate of 6.2 percent over the past several years.
