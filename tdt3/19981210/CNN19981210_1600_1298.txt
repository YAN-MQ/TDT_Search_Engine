Well either way, at least the weather's nice. June Jones will indeed 
leave his post as the San Diego chargers interim head coach at season's 
end and take over the reigns tat University of hawaii, where he once 
played and coached. He has some work to do as the rainbows have lost 
18 straight games. As a coach, what excites me and what I have been 
able to do is turn around situations that you just described in professional 
football. Went to the Oilers, you go through tall franchises that 
I have coached for. That's what's fun to me. And I think I have a 
plan to get that done.
