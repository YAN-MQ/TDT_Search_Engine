A judge who ordered three Swiss men, including a former Nestle executive, 
to prison on drug charges has been removed from the bench for sexually 
harassing the men's lawyer, the Guatemalan Supreme Court said Thursday. 
Defense lawyer Lea Marie de Leon accused Judge Herberto Zapata, of 
sexually harassing her and threatening to kill her one week before 
her clients were sentenced. A court investigation found that Zapata 
and Leon had gone together to a restaurant in Puerto Barrios, 160 
miles (260 kms) northeast of Guatemala City, on Sept. 17. They returned 
to de Leon's hotel, where the judge tried to force his way into her 
room. De Leon said the court's decision was ``a precedent for other 
colleagues and women, particularly victims of this type of offense.'' 
Zapata said he was innocent and called his dismissal ``unjust.'' He 
said he would appeal. The court made no comment about whether the 
dismissal would affect the cases of the Swiss men, who have appealed 
their sentences. On Sept. 24, Zapata ordered former Nestle executive 
Andreas Heanggi Wyndler, 60, to 12 years in prison and a fine of dlrs 
77,000, for his role in a case known as the ``German Connection,'' 
which involved dlrs 100 million shipments of cocaine sent from Guatemala 
to Europe, hidden in containers and ornamental plants. His son, Nicholas 
Heanggi Chalandrian, 22, was sentenced to 20 years and fined dlrs 
155,000, as was Swiss citizen Silvio Giovanoli, 30. The Swiss Foreign 
Ministry had criticized the sentences as ``extremely hard and disproportionate.'' 
Two other men also were sentenced in the case: German hotel manager 
Joachin Frank Schilling, 52, was ordered to serve five years and pay 
dlrs 15,000; a former Guatemalan police commander, Jose Luis Zebadua 
Salazar, 35, was sentenced to 12 years and a dlrs 77,000 fine for 
having protected the shipments.
