Abe Hirschfeld made a name for himself as a millionaire developer 
with erratic behavior and questionable publicity stunts, but even 
some of those who have nothing but contempt for him said they were 
surprised about his indictment this week on charges of plotting to 
kill his business partner. In interviews Thursday, people who have 
worked with Hirschfeld described him as shrewd but socially inept, 
a man with an insatiable need for attention and respect. He has often 
won the attention, they said, but not the respect, a failing that 
has haunted him. Abraham Jacob Hirschfeld, now 79, was born in Poland 
and got the equivalent of a sixth-grade education. His family emigrated 
to Palestine, which later became Israel, where he got his first job 
in a refrigerator factory. In 1954, when he was in his 30s, he moved 
to New York. Hirschfeld later became a success in the business world, 
developing the city's first open-air parking lots and later founding 
a chain of upscale health clubs. Though he was financially successful, 
his peers in the real-estate business shunned him because of his unpredictable, 
uncouth behavior and his eccentricity, several of them said Thursday. 
The most recent example: his unsuccessful effort this fall to settle 
the Paula Jones sexual harassment lawsuit against President Clinton 
by offering her $1 million. Some associates suggest Hirschfeld's strong 
Yiddish accent and frequently disheveled appearance have further damaged 
his efforts to be taken seriously. Although he has made a lot of money, 
nobody in the real-estate and development business holds him in high 
regard, some said. ``He is a joke,'' said Joseph Strasburg, president 
of the Rent Stabilization Association, the city's largest landlord 
group. ``How do you do business with a guy like that? People just 
don't trust him.'' But while Strasburg and others said they were suspicious 
of Hirschfeld, they said it was hard to believe he would order a killing. 
``He is zany, but there is a limit to his zaniness,'' said Bill Green, 
a Democratic political consultant who worked on one of Hirschfeld's 
failed political campaigns in the 1980s. ``I can't believe he would 
seriously consider doing that.'' It was Hirschfeld's quest for respect 
and admiration that drew him to politics, a friend and former business 
associate said. Starting in the 1970s, he ran unsuccessfully _ first 
as a Democrat, then as a Republican, most recently as an independent 
_ for the U.S. Senate, Congress, the New York City Council, lieutenant 
governor, mayor of Miami Beach, Manhattan borough president and most 
recently, state comptroller. Hirschfeld did win a two-year term as 
a Miami beach commissioner in 1989, but ran into trouble when he spat 
at a Miami Herald reporter in front of television cameras. He grew 
more unpopular there after fighting with building inspectors about 
a hotel he had bought and renovated for $20 million, and returned 
to New York. ``As long as Abe is still breathing, he will run for 
office,'' Green said. ``Otherwise no one will ever see the name `Hirschfeld' 
in the paper, and he depends on that.'' But others said Hirschfeld's 
most serious bid for respect was his purchase of The New York Post 
in 1993, when the newspaper was in bankruptcy. The staff rebelled, 
though, after he fired several popular editors and promised to print 
his wife's poetry in the paper. Hirschfeld sold the paper to Rupert 
Murdoch after just 16 days. His brief tenure at the Post was his shining 
hour, a friend and ex-business associate said Thursday. ``Abe's biggest 
disappointment in life was his failure to keep the Post,'' said the 
friend, who requested anonymity because of Hirschfeld's indictment. 
``To own a newspaper would have given him everything he sought in 
this town: prestige, power and influence.'' Hirschfeld founded a daily 
paper, Open Air PM, in 1996, but it shut down after five months. Over 
the years, he has proposed rebuilding Yankee Stadium with a dome on 
top and replacing subway tokens with Susan B. Anthony dollars. Last 
year, as he was preparing to run for Manhattan borough president, 
he was indicted on 123 counts of state income-tax fraud _ the case 
is pending _ and then came the Paula Jones escapade. Despite what 
many people describe as his offensive antics, Hirschfeld is a ``decent'' 
person who donated money to several people wounded in the Long Island 
Rail Road shootings of 1993, the friend said. ``I have always described 
Abe as a man with a head of fire and a heart of gold,'' he said. ``A 
lot of his bad behavior comes from his failure to get the recognition 
he thinks he deserves.'' Hirschfeld and his wife, Zipora, live in 
a luxury apartment building on Fifth Avenue. His son, Elie, works 
for the family real-estate business, as does at least one grandson. 
But his daughter, Rachel, recently sued her father on charges that 
he tried to cheat her out of millions in a family real-estate deal. 
The friend who requested anonymity said that Hirschfeld's relationship 
with Stanley Stahl, the business partner whom he is charged with plotting 
to kill, was indeed troubled. ``Abe has always maintained that the 
guy was cheating him, and the guy said the same thing about Abe,'' 
the friend said. ``They were never able to get back together and make 
up. It was a long, longstanding feud.''
