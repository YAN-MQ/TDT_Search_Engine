Of the many verbal assaults that Rep. Henry Hyde, R-Ill., had endured, 
this one had an especially sharp edge. ``I don't want you to default 
on your good name and leadership,'' Rep. Maxine Waters, D-Calif., 
one of the House Judiciary Committee's most liberal members, told 
Hyde, its Republican chairman. Then, ominously, she added: ``History 
will not be kind to you.'' Although the statement went far beyond 
the usual quibbling over the lineup of witnesses for the committee's 
impeachment inquiry or the time allotted for committee members to 
question them, Hyde listened to it Tuesday with his customary air 
of subdued dignity. He even drolly asked the committee's consent that 
``the gentle lady be permitted to finish her attack on me.'' But other 
committee members and Hyde's friends said that behind that quip was 
undoubtedly some anguish. They said Hyde was acutely aware not just 
that he was standing in the spotlight of history, but that the glare 
was sometimes unforgiving. As the committee proceeded this week toward 
a landmark vote on articles of impeachment, its 74-year-old chairman 
found his entire political career and public image distilled into 
a single act of stewardship. Nearly a quarter century in Congress 
and a carefully honed reputation for patience, prudence and fairness 
had come to this: supervision of a process that had failed to win 
broad popular support, exposed bitter partisan rivalries between Republicans 
and Democrats and subjected Hyde to death threats and the constant 
escort of a security detail. ``It's stressful, extremely stressful,'' 
he told reporters just before he left the hearing room Wednesday night. 
Asked what he would like to be remembered for, he did not mention 
the impeachment inquiry. ``I was a good congressman,'' said Hyde, 
who is perhaps best known for his advocacy in 1976 of the ``Hyde Amendment,'' 
which restricted the use of federal money for abortion, but has also 
voted for programs to provide aid for children once they are born. 
``I accomplished some things, and when my time comes, I'll be missed.'' 
Several committee members said that a tone of genuine self-pity had 
crept into Hyde's voice for perhaps the first time last week when 
he complained during the hearings that he was being browbeaten excessively. 
Jack Hahn, a close longtime friend of Hyde's from Chicago, noted that 
little fissures were appearing in Hyde's famously unflappable demeanor. 
``He came walking into that hearing the other day looking like he 
was limping,'' Hahn said in a telephone interview Tuesday. ``Last 
week, he barked at a few people. That's not Henry Hyde, believe me.'' 
Hyde's press secretary, Sam Stratman, said Hyde had been surprised 
and disappointed that most Americans, according to opinion polls, 
never came to share his view of the gravity of the allegations against 
President Clinton. Hyde's own assessment of those charges became increasingly 
clear this week. While there had been some question among committee 
members about whether the primary force propelling him was his own 
convictions or conservatives in his party, Hyde's actions constituted 
something of a hard sell for impeachment. He held a special press 
conference Monday, pointing to four tall white columns of boxes to 
demonstrate that the committee had considered 60,000 pages of grand 
jury testimony and was not acting rashly in calling so few witnesses. 
Hyde's voice had a defensive ring. He also sent a letter to Republican 
members of the House that beseeched them not to state their opinions 
about impeachment until the committee had finished its work. The letter 
was clearly aimed at moderate Republicans who might vote against impeachment. 
During the hearings this week, he defended a course at odds with the 
prevailing public sentiment, commenting to one witness, a Jesuit priest: 
``Someone said that if Jesus had taken a poll, he would never have 
preached the Gospel.'' By subjecting Hyde to such intense scrutiny, 
the impeachment inquiry has unearthed aspects of his past he might 
well have preferred to keep buried. They include an extramarital affair 
of three decades ago, remarks 15 years ago that urged leniency for 
a Republican congressman facing expulsion for sexual misconduct with 
a teen-age congressional page, and a statement during the Iran-Contra 
hearings in 1987 that ridiculed the righteousness of people who ``label 
every untruth and every deception an outrage.'' Hyde has also drawn 
criticism for his handling of the inquiry itself, which has occasionally 
veered off in surprising directions, like the testimony of two convicted 
perjurers and the suggestion that the panel might look into Clinton's 
campaign finances. ``There's a feeling of constant, constant jibes 
from everybody,'' said Philip Corboy, another longtime friend of Hyde's. 
``It's torture for him.'' Others were less sympathetic. ``He's used 
to being treated as if he walks on water,'' said one staff member 
for Democrats on the committee, who spoke on condition of anonymity, 
``and I think he's shocked and surly that his feet have gotten wet.'' 
They may not be drying anytime soon. If impeachment goes to the Senate, 
Hyde would most likely be the person to supervise the presentation 
of the case during the trial there. Asked Monday how involved he would 
be, he said, ``Haven't thought about that, and don't want to think 
about that.''
