BAGHDAD, Iraq (AP) _ U.N. inspectors searching suspected weapons sites 
in Iraq will not be allowed to enter an office of the ruling Baath 
Party that they were turned away from earlier, a party official said 
Thursday. ``They won't enter,'' Latif Nsayyif Jassim, a member of 
the party's leadership, said during a news conference at the office 
in Baghdad's Adhamiya neighborhood. ``You will not find inside this 
office any materials related to what they are looking for,'' he said. 
On Wednesday, a team of 12 U.N. inspectors was turned back when it 
tried to enter the office. The inspectors left after an Iraqi official 
demanded they first provide a written declaration ``on the material 
and items'' they sought, the official Iraqi News Agency said. Later, 
however, Iraq's oil minister, Lt. Gen. Amer Mohammed Rashid, who has 
been a top weapons negotiator, said Iraqi escorts were mistaken in 
declaring the site sensitive. That seemed to suggest the team should 
not have been barred. Richard Butler, head of the U.N. Special Commission, 
which oversees the inspections, criticized Iraq's action Wednesday, 
saying: ``This was an absolutely legal no-notice inspection and they 
blocked us.'' The United States, which had threatened military action 
during two previous standoffs between Iraq and U.N. inspectors this 
year, was cautious. ``As the president has said, if UNSCOM cannot 
do its job effectively, we remain poised to act,'' David Leavy, a 
spokesman for the National Security Council, said Wednesday. He declined 
to say what would trigger U.S. military action. The office in contention 
is in a two-story stucco building behind black gates. There are no 
signs outside indicating it is an office of Iraqi President Saddam 
Hussein's party, but there is an emblem of the party over the door. 
Jassim insisted that the office was private property and that it was 
his decision whether anyone could enter. He said the party works on 
political matters and not anything related to the inspectors's goal 
_ weaponry. ``My base is protected, and no one can enter except a 
party member or an Iraqi national,'' he said. Jassim said the inspectors' 
attempt to search the site was ``unprecedented.'' Asked if inspectors 
would be barred again, he said: ``Yes it will be forbidden because 
there is no justification. Nor will you find by entering anything 
inside that is banned or prohibited.'' Jassim's statements came just 
hours after a full contingent of inspectors on Thursday resumed searches 
of suspected weapons sites. ``Everyone's gone out today, attempting 
to carry on their normal activities,'' said Caroline Cross, the inspectors' 
spokeswoman. ``We're just carrying on with our scheduled activities.'' 
Cross said the teams had made no changes in their routine. ``There 
is no reason why we should stop,'' she said. She declined to say whether 
U.N. teams would try to re-enter the contentious Baath Party site. 
The inspectors must certify that Iraq has dismantled its chemical, 
biological and nuclear weapons, long-range missiles and programs to 
build them before the U.N. Security Council will lift an oil embargo 
and other sanctions imposed after Iraq invaded Kuwait in 1990. The 
sanctions have devastated Iraq's economy.
