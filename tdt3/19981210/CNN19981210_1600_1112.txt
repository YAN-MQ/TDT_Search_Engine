A conservation group is spending millions of dollars to preserve forests 
and wildlife. The conservation fund says it's paying $76 million for 
nearly 300,000 acres of land in New Hampshire, Vermont and New York. 
The group plans to sell back about 30% of the land to the state and 
federal governments for long-term preservation. The balance will be 
sold to private groups with certain usage restrictions.
