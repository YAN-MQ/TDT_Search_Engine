Not exactly a housewarming party. But there's a celebration aboard 
the new international space station this afternoon. The astronauts 
from the space shuttle "endeavour" have entered the station. You're 
looking at a live picture right here. Once inside, they turned on 
the lights and snapped a few pictures for posterity. The historic 
moment marks a new era in space exploration. Over the next two days, 
the astronauts will install a communications system. But it will take 
five years and 40 more shuttle missions before the space station is 
completely finished.
