Democratic counsel abbe Lowell said President Clinton's conduct does 
not warrant subjecting the country to months of debate. Attorneys 
are making their closing arguments before the house Judiciary committee 
today. Lowell is using portions of President Clinton's videotaped 
testimony in the paula Jones case. Earlier, in a closed executive 
session, the committee met to debate its release. The video is expected 
to be embarrassing to the president, including evasions. For instance 
-- despite the misconduct, there are better ways to punish the president. 
Impeachment is not a means to send a message to our children that 
the president isn't above the law. There are better ways to do that. 
Impeachment is not a vote of confidence for independent counsel Starr. 
Impeachment is not a penalty for the president, not answering the 
81 questions as some of you would have wished. Impeachment is not 
a form of rebuke or censure for the president's conduct. In fact, 
impeachment is not about the president's conduct. It's about Congress' 
conduct. After Lowell speaks, republican counsel David shippers will 
present his argument to the committee. He's expected to conclude that 
there is enough evidence of impeachable conduct. Once investigators 
conclude their closing arguments, committee members will each give 
opening statements. Debate on the four proposed articles of impeachment 
will come afterward. The panel is expected to vote before the end 
of the week.
