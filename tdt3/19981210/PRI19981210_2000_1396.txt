OK, time now to flip through THE WORLD's back pages, beginning with 
a question that scientists have been pondering for decades: What should 
astronauts do with their dirty underwear? Russian researchers think 
they have the answer: In a word, microbes. Scientists at the Russian 
State Research Center's Institute for Biological and Medical problems 
think they found a combination of bacteria that will eat the cotton 
and paper underwear worn by space travelers. Not only would it mean 
that NASA could take the washer and dryer out of the space shuttle's 
cargo hold, but the methane produced by the munching microbes could 
be used to help power the space craft.
