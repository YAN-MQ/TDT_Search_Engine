Warning: Michael Keaton plays a struggling rock musician in ``Jack 
Frost'' and can be found stomping and singing the blues (``Frosty 
the Snowman was as bad as he could be. ...'') even before the credits 
are over. As the film's eponymous hero, he's one of those dedicated 
rock-and-rollers who are also great husbands and devoted dads. But 
the demands of his work sometimes keep him away from his son, Charlie 
(Joseph Cross). The film is about what happens after Jack dies in 
a Christmas Eve automobile accident and returns to his family as a 
large, wisecracking marshmallow man parked on the front lawn. With 
emotions as sincere as the soap flake snow on its sets, ``Jack Frost'' 
goes on to show how much fun it is to have a snowman as a loving (though 
dead) father. Thanks to the excellent efforts of Jim Henson's Creature 
Shop, Snowman Jack can do anything from snowboarding to coaching hockey 
(with pucks shooting right through his middle). And when he gets damaged, 
he can just laugh it off and repair himself. ``Boy, I've had to put 
myself back together after some rough nights, but this is ridiculous,'' 
he jokes after one such episode. As one more Hollywood effort to look 
on the sunny side of fatality, ``Jack Frost'' is so sugarcoated that 
it makes other recent efforts in this genre look blisteringly honest. 
On the other hand, it's just cheerful and bogus enough to keep children 
reasonably entertained. They may well want to believe in Keaton's 
affable Jack as the coolest, most virtuous guy who ever picked up 
a harmonica, and in Kelly Preston's Gabby as the kind of sweet, pretty 
mother who's happy shoveling snow or fixing the drain beneath the 
kitchen sink. The film's Colorado townsfolk are also amusing, what 
with Henry Rollins as Charlie's overheated hockey coach and Mark Addy 
(of ``The Full Monty'') as Jack's band mate and best friend. The long-in-the-tooth 
Jack Frost Band happens to be poised on the verge of its first big 
break just as Jack realizes that Charlie needs more of his time. In 
fact, the Frosts are all set to visit their mountain cabin for a cozy 
family Christmas when Jack gets a call summoning the band to Aspen 
immediately. What to do? Jack goes for the brass ring, then suddenly 
realizes how much more he cares about quality time with his loved 
ones. He heads for the cabin but drives off the road, leaving the 
director, Troy Miller, at a temporary loss. Without further ado, we 
get a ``One Year Later'' title, a briefly sad Charlie and the return 
of Keaton in the jokey voice-over portion of his role. A maudlin stretch 
becomes inevitable once the film has covered two Christmases and run 
out of Snowman fun. So the screenplay, which is credited to ``Mark 
Steven Johnson and Steve Bloom &AMP; Jonathan Roberts and Jeff Cesario,'' 
and plays that way, brings out the heavy emotional artillery. To wit: 
``As long as you hold somebody in your heart, Charlie, you can never 
lose them _ ever!'' And: ``I was so busy trying to make my mark on 
the world. You ARE my mark on the world.'' And the moral of the story: 
``Everybody deserves a second chance.'' Ms. Preston, Cross and especially 
Keaton do deserve credit for playing their roles as credibly and breezily 
as possible under these snowflaky circumstances. For extra insurance, 
``Jack Frost'' is plastered with pop songs, with Stevies (Nicks and 
Ray Vaughan) for baby-boom parents enjoying the prospect of immortality, 
and Hanson for those who believe snowmen talk. ``Jack Frost'' is rated 
PG (Parental guidance suggested). It includes mild profanity, snowball 
fighting and parental death. PRODUCTION NOTES: `JACK FROST' Directed
