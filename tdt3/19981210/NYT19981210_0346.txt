Hasbro Inc. will donate $6 million in toys, books and money for children, 
to settle an antitrust suit in which it is charged with unfair trade 
practices intended to withhold popular toys from some retailers. Under 
terms of the settlement, the maker of GI Joe dolls and Milton Bradley 
games will donate $3.57 million worth of toys for distribution to 
children in all 50 states, Puerto Rico and the District of Columbia. 
Hasbro, the world's second-largest toy maker, will also pay the states 
$2.38 million, which is to be used for toys, books and other educational 
material. The agreement, which is subject to court approval, settles 
a lawsuit that New York State Attorney General Dennis Vacco brought 
against Toys ``R'' Us, Hasbro and two other toy makers. The suit accused 
the companies of colluding to prevent competing retailers from offering 
toys at lower prices. Eventually, 43 other states joined the suit. 
The attorneys general accused Toys ``R'' Us, the world's largest toy 
retailer, with brokering an illegal agreement among the manufacturers 
to ensure that warehouse clubs could obtain certain popular toys only 
in ``combination packs,'' which cost consumers more and whose prices 
could not be compared with items sold by Toys ``R'' Us. In addition 
to Hasbro, the suit named Mattel Inc. and Little Tikes Co. as defendants. 
The company said the settlement was not an admission of wrongdoing. 
``It's settling a case to avoid the time and expense of protracted 
litigation,'' said Wayne Charness, a spokesman for Hasbro. Toys ``R'' 
Us also said the settlement did not change its position on the case. 
``Toys `R' Us has always acted fairly and in the consumer's best interest,'' 
said Rebecca Caruso, a spokeswoman for the retailer. ``But certainly 
we understand Hasbro's desire to resolve the issue without protracted 
litigation, particularly since the settlement involves a charitable 
component.'' She said Toys ``R'' Us was in mediation on the case that 
might lead to a similar settlement. Vacco said the agreement with 
Hasbro was a victory for consumers. ``What better way to settle an 
antitrust probe against a toy manufacturer than to secure its agreement 
to distribute free toys?'' he said. New York will receive 30,000 toys 
worth about $241,000 as its part of the settlement. In each state, 
the toys, books and other educational material will be distributed 
through the Marine Corps' ``Toys for Tots'' program.
