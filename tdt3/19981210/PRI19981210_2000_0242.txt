Two of Northern Ireland's senior politicians have received a Nobel 
Peace Prize. David Trimble and John Hume were handed the award for 
their part in securing the Northern Ireland peace deal. At the awards 
ceremony in the Norwegian capital, Oslo, Mr. Hume called the prize 
a tribute to the ordinary people of Northern Ireland. Our people never 
stopped encouraging their leaders to find the courage to resolve this 
situation. This is indeed their prize, our people's prize. Protestant 
leader, David Trimble, used the occasion to issue a warning on what 
he said was holding up further progress. I have not pressed paramilitaries 
on the details of the commissioner. All I've asked for is that they 
say that the so-called war is over. But common sense dictates that 
I cannot forever convince society that real peace is at hand if there 
is not a beginning to decommissioning of weapons as an earnest of 
the decommissioning of hearts that must follow. Ulster Unionist leader 
David Trimble.
