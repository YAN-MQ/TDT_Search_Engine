As the formal debate on impeachment began Thursday night, the House 
Judiciary Committee sounded as if this were more a routine political 
dispute than a grave constitutional matter. Rep. James Sensenbrenner 
of Wisconsin, the second-ranking Republican on the committee, declared 
in the first of the 10-minute opening statements that President Clinton's 
values were ``completely opposite to the values parents want to teach 
their children.'' Another Republican who spoke early, Rep. George 
Gekas of Pennsylvania, declared, ``Perjury, perjury, falsehood under 
oath. We can't escape it.'' On the Democratic side, Rep. John Conyers 
of Michigan, the only member of the committee who sat on the panel 
that recommended impeachment of President Richard M. Nixon in 1974, 
accused the Republicans of ``trying to overturn the results of two 
national elections'' and of ``attempting a legislative takeover of 
the executive branch of government.'' But unlike the case at this 
point of the 1974 debate, there was little sense Thursday night that 
the lawmakers had anguished over the votes they were about to cast. 
Presumably that is because all 38 members of the Judiciary Committee 
had long ago made up their minds _ the Republicans in favor of impeaching 
Clinton and the Democrats against it. In 1974, Rep. William Cohen 
of Maine, one of the Republicans who broke with his party to support 
impeachment, spoke of his ``anxiety,'' his ``apprehension'' and his 
``sense of law.'' And in one of the most memorable speeches in Congress 
in the last quarter century, Rep. Barbara Jordan, then a freshman 
Democrat from Texas, spoke of ``the solemnness that I feel right now'' 
and added: ``My faith in the Constitution is whole. It is complete. 
It is total. And I am not going to sit here and be an idle spectator 
to the dimunition, the subversion, the destruction of the Constitution.'' 
Thursday night, few talked of the Constitution and even fewer seemed 
to have any doubts about where they stood. Rep. Barney Frank of Massachusetts 
articulated the essential Democratic point. ``The president had a 
private consensual sexual affair and lied about it,'' he declared. 
``The fact is, that's all we have.'' Republicans did not disagree. 
They just said that perjury, about sex as well as anything else, was 
a serious crime that justified impeachment. ``To do otherwise,'' said 
Rep. Bill McCollum, R-Fla., ``would undermine the rule of law and 
undermine our system of government.'' Another difference between Thursday 
night's debate and the one of July 24 and 25, 1974, is that this time 
the opponents of impeachment acknowledged the president's wrongdoing. 
``I believe the president lied,'' Frank said. Rep. Howard Berman, 
D-Calif., was especially harsh in his treatment of the president. 
``There something Alice-in-Wonderland-like,'' he said, ``watching 
someone so smart and so skilled, so admired by the American people 
for his intellect and his talents, digging himself deeper and deeper 
and deeper into a rabbit hole, and us along with him, and allowing 
him to escape accountability. ``This troubles me greatly, and I know 
it motivates many of the calls for impeachment. People do have a right 
to ask, `What will America's children believe about lying, about reverence 
for the law, about lying under oath?' '' Clinton's mistakes, his Democratic 
critics said, simply did not rise to the level of impeachable offenses. 
``Impeachment must not be pursued if the body politic opposes impeachment,'' 
Berman declared. In the Nixon debate, few of the president's supporters 
made such concessions of error. For example, Trent Lott of Mississippi, 
then a first-term congressman from Mississippi and now the Senate 
Republican leader, said of Nixon: ``The president didn't participate 
in the Watergate cover-up. The contempt of Congress charge is so ludicrous 
that it deserves no comment.'' One lawmaker who did address the historical 
and Constitutional importance was Rep. Charles Schumer, the Democratic 
senator-elect from New York. If the House votes to impeach, he said, 
``We will be substantially lowering the bar for removal of a sitting 
president.'' That, he continued, would encourage future Congresses 
to investigate and try to impeach presidents on trivial charges. Schumer 
read his speech, looking through glasses. Many, on the other hand, 
spoke extemporaneously. One who spoke without even notes was Rep. 
Howard Coble, R-N.C., and he was one of the toughest in his ridicule 
of the president. ``When I return to my district,'' Coble said, ``I 
sometimes motor south on Highway 29 through the fox and the wine country 
of Virginia. And as I approach the North Carolina boundary line, my 
mind begins to clear, as I am at that point removed from the Beltway 
spin.'' He continued: ``All of sudden I am aware of the definition 
of `sex.' All of a sudden I know the meaning of `alone.' I know what 
`is' is, as do the majority of my constituents.'' Schumer was also 
challenged by Rep. Lamar Smith, R-Texas. The president should be impeached, 
he said, because of his uniquely high office and his ``repeated and 
deliberate pattern of lies.'' ``Our country will endure,'' Smith added, 
``because the Constitution works and has for 200 years.'' Many Democrats 
argued that the solution was for Congress to pass a resolution censuring 
the president. That, said Rep. Rick Boucher, D-Va., would ``place 
the nation, the Congress and the president on the path to restoration 
of dignity.'' But Rep. Charles Canady, R-Fla., said, ``The Constitution 
does not authorize a censure of a president of the United States who 
has committed high crimes and misdemeanors.''
