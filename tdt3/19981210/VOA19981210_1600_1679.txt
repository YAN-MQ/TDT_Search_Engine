The U.S. National Christmas tree was installed on a lawn next to the 
White House. It's aglow with thousands of lights. The richly decorated 
blue spruce was brought to Washington from Colorado. It was lit Wednesday 
during a festive ceremony featuring President Clinton. Baseball player 
Sammy Sosa and local scouts turned the electricity switch on to the 
cheering of thousands of people who came to watch the ceremony. In 
the spirit of environmental awareness, this year's Christmas tree 
is lighted with the help of solar batteries. The White House says 
solar power helps reduce greenhouse emissions and contributes to a 
cleaner environment.
