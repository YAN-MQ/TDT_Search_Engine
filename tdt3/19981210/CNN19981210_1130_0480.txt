I'm meteorologist Dave Hennen with your "CNN Headline News Weather." 
Temperatures today are again quite cold back through the Rockies and 
extending into west Texas. Forecast high temperatures into the 20s 
and 30s today. Still warm in Florida, should make it into the 80s 
in Miami, up towards orlando. Temperatures, though, further to the 
north along the eastern seaboard have cooled back into the 40s and 
50s. Here's the forecast from this evening, taking you through late-day 
tomorrow, watching low pressure developing along the gulf coast region 
in texas. This will be spreading northeastward, bringing with it showers 
and thunderstorms, and snow will continue in through west Texas. High 
pressure, fair weather expected to continue to dominate the weather, 
most of the western U.S. and much of the northeast, as well. The extended 
forecast, on Saturday, we will find wet weather in the southeastern 
U.S. and rain and mountain snows in the pacific northwest. By Sunday, 
temperatures begin to warm through the plains back into the 60s in 
a number of locations. We'll find scattered snow showers into the 
northeast and showers into the pacific northwest. On Monday, scattered 
showers, windy conditions in the northwest, just a few showers in 
Florida. For more weather information, log into CNN.com.
