The boss has won a legal battle against music Pirates in Britain. 
A London judge has blocked the release of an unauthorized collection 
of songs recorded early in Bruce springsteen's career. The rocker 
argues that the release of "before the fame" would damage his artistic 
integrity because the songs do not meet his high standards. The judge 
says springsteen owns the songs, and ordered masquerade music to pay 
his legal bills, about $825,000. Masquerade says it will appeal.
