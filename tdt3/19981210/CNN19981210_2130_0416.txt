The largest human smuggling ring ever to penetrate the northern border 
of the United States has been busted. Authorities from the United 
States and Canada say they have arrested 35 people who transported 
3,600 people from China into New York City. They say the smugglers 
charged each person $47,000 for transport into the United States. 
The sting came after a year-long undercover investigation.
