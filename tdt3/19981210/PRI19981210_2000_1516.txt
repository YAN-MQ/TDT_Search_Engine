Russia's finance minister, Mikhail Zadornov today warned that his 
country would face collapse unless it was able to reduce the burden 
of foreign debt. Zadornov's comments have investors worried all over 
the world, as Patrick O'Connell reports from our business desk in 
New York. Russia's debt problems spread far beyond her borders. They 
frightened international investors and help explain the so-called 
contagion effect which hit confidence in Latin American countries, 
too. Now comes the news that Russia wants help to tackle its vast 
debt mountain. David Malpas from Wall Street firm, Bear Stearns, explains 
the background. It was a critical stumble in August when Russia devalued 
and defaulted on their debt. It set new terms really globally for 
the extent of collapse that might occur for a developing country. 
Given Russia's miniscule impact on trade worldwide, have international 
investors always overreacted to events there? No. The steps that led 
to Russia's August collapse were serious for the rest of the world. 
The IMF had gone into Russia in June in its latest effort to try to 
straighten out the economy. And once again, it was a complete failure. 
And so by August, Russia had taken the money from the IMF but still 
didn't have a workable system for its exchange rate. The implications 
for other developing countries were severe, and that's what pushed 
global markets down in August and September. So is it at all possible 
that these new developments represent some kind of a turning point? 
No. Russia is still in severe crisis. The budget doesn't really change 
the dire straits that Russia faces. It's the arrival of winter in 
Russia which means that ordinary people are likely to feel the worsening 
of the economic crisis there. For THE WORLD, I'm Patrick O'Connell 
in New York.
