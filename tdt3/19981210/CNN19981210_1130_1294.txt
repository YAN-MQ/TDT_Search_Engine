Jose canseco's tour of the American league continues. The free agent 
introduced by his new club, the Devil Rays today, canseco's fourth 
team in as many seasons. The dh/outfielder cranked out a career-high 
46 homers with Toronto in '98. He joins a second-year club in dire 
need of a big bat. Tampa hit just 111 homers in its inaugural season, 
the second-lowest total in the bigs. Hopefully, I can stay healthy. 
And I think history has shown for me, if I do stay healthy, hopefully, 
it can be anywhere 40 to 50 home runs.
