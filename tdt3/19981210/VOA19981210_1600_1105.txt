It's time now for Sports. And joining us with the latest is Park Brewer. 
Thank you very much, Tony. The U.S. and international teams will be 
out on the course. At the Royal Melbourne Golf Club in Australia. 
Just hours from now for the start of the third President's Cup. Australian 
Greg Norman was instrumental in bringing the event to his home country. 
But there have questions about Norman's ability to compete. The player 
known as the Great White Shark recently underwent shoulder surgery. 
And he says he'll have to reevaluate his physical condition. Coming 
off this -- in this process in this time in December is going to be 
a real hectic time. Because I played four tournaments in five weeks. 
And even during my week off I practice. So I've really been going 
at it now for about six straight weeks. Hitting balls. And there is 
a little fatigue factor in there. I wouldn't -- but at the same time, 
there's no problems with it. So yes, we're going to sit down. We're 
going to check it out. Not all golfers, by the way, play in all the 
matches in this three day event. The President's Cup is played every 
two years. The USA won the first two events, which were held outside 
the nation's capitol. Right outside Washington.
