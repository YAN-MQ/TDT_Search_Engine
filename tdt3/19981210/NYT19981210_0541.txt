The New York Times said in an editorial on Friday, Dec. 11: James 
P. Hoffa's election this week as president of the Teamsters union 
is a disheartening development. Hoffa, son of Jimmy Hoffa, must be 
judged on the basis of his own record and alliances, not his father's 
criminal convictions and alleged mob ties. But there is no disguising 
that the Hoffa victory signals a comeback for old-line Teamster leadership 
that presided over the looting and disgrace of one of America's biggest 
unions from the 1950s through the 1980s. For that reason alone, Hoffa's 
suggestion that it is now time to end nine years of federal supervision 
of the Teamsters deserves no serious consideration. Because of that 
federal monitoring, the Teamsters are a more democratic and honest 
union than they were in the time of the senior Hoffa. The younger 
Hoffa insists that he is committed to continued reform. But his leading 
supporters include Larry Brennan, a Michigan Teamster who helped oversee 
a welfare fund from which federal monitors say $725,000 was misappropriated, 
and Tom O'Donnell, a New York Teamster accused by independent reviewers 
of hiding payments to a convicted felon who worked as a Hoffa campaign 
aide. James P. Hoffa's path to the presidency was made easier by a 
political corruption scandal that brought down his predecessor, Ron 
Carey, who first won election in 1991 as a reformer but later was 
found to have benefited from some $700,000 in union dues illegally 
funneled into his 1996 re-election campaign against Hoffa. Carey was 
expelled from the union and the tainted election was rerun, with Hoffa 
emerging as the winner. Just a few years back, it seemed realistic 
to imagine a revitalized labor movement again becoming an effective 
advocate for working people and social causes. That prospect has now 
receded, and not just because of the ethical stumbles of the Teamster 
reform movement. From the alleged involvement of the AFL-CIO secretary-treasurer, 
Rich Trumka, in the 1996 Carey campaign financing scandal to the revelations 
of graft and voting fraud in New York City's biggest municipal workers 
union, the behavior of prominent labor leaders has betrayed union 
members and discouraged potential allies in the wider public.
