harder to ignore. It's no mystery why millions of people have moved... 
- ha-ha!pp- because directv gives them more movies, sports... and 
a variety of programming they just can't get from cable. So what are 
you looking at? If it's not directv, see your retailer for a demo 
today. Let's say the puppy's a salesperson in an average computer 
store. Now, ask the salesperson a question. What's the difference 
between dvd and CD-rom? How much ram do I really need? Oh, and can 
you guys install software? Okay... thanks. We built a different place 
to buy a compute gateway country, staffed with trained people who'll 
have a computer built just for you starting as low as $999. Gateway 
country. Get more out of the box. Drop by any store or call 1 800 
gateway.
