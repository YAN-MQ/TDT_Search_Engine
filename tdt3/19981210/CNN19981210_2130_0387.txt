The federal election commission has decided not to require the campaigns 
of President Clinton and Bob Dole to repay millions of dollars in 
matching funds. The commissioners voted unanimously to reject the 
recommendation of fec auditors, who found the president's 1996 campaign 
owed $7 million and dole's owed $17.7 million. The auditors ruled 
the campaigns illegally coordinated advertising that was run by their 
respective parties. The fec rejected that assertion.
