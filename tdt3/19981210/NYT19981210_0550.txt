Besieged by a maelstrom of negative publicity, the organizers of an 
exhibition game that would help to benefit financially strapped National 
Basketball Association players have decided to give all proceeds of 
the game instead to charitable organizations. The announcement on 
Monday to split the proceeds between UNICEF and cash-poor players 
was scrapped Thursday after the game's organizers spoke with players, 
promoters and officials from the National Basketball Players Association. 
The profits from the game on Dec. 19 in Atlantic City, N.J., will 
now be donated to UNICEF, Save the Children and a few Philadelphia-based 
charities. ``It was my expectation from the beginning that the money 
was going to charity,'' said Arn Tellem, the agent who is promoting 
the game with David Falk. ``I think it's the right thing to do. I'm 
not aware of any players who need help.'' Asked why the organizers 
had reversed their stance, Tellem said: ``We hadn't talked to all 
the players at that time. One of the goals in the beginning was to 
help the players if the season was canceled. Once we canvassed all 
the players and the union, we knew the right thing to do was give 
the entire proceeds to charity.'' Tellem said he hoped to raise between 
$1 million and $2 million from broadcast rights and the sale of tickets. 
Though Polk said on Monday that a courtside seat at Convention Hall 
would sell for $1,000, he said Thursday that he was mistaken. Prices 
will be $25, $50, $100, $200, $300 and up to $500. More than half 
of the 12,500 seats will be sold for $50 or less, a spokesman from 
Falk's office said. Blocks of free tickets will also be distributed 
to Atlantic City and Philadelphia youths. The lockout is in its fifth 
month, and no bargaining sessions have been scheduled. On Tuesday 
the league announced the cancellation of the All-Star Game. On Wednesday, 
an agent, Keith Glass, said that his players would not accept charity 
from the game and that he felt insulted by the thinking of his fellow 
agents. ``The idea that a player making $275,000 can't manage his 
money and needs the fans to bail him out is absurd and insulting,'' 
Glass said. In a statement, Curtis Polk, the president of Falk Associates 
Management Enterprises and the game's chief organizer, said: ``As 
a result of the league's cancellation of the All-Star Game, the players 
feel that this is an All-Star Game for the fans of Philadelphia and 
around the world who are being deprived of the midseason event.'' 
The notion that some players needed financial assistance was dispelled 
Thursday by the players association. Dan Wasserman, the communications 
director of the union, said that the union has a strike fund of between 
$16 million and $20 million, which has yet to be tapped. Before the 
lockout began, the union sent questionnaires to its 400-plus members 
asking if they needed financial assistance in case the dispute dragged 
on. Of the 130 that replied, fewer than 10 percent said they would 
need help, Wasserman said. The few who needed help were referred to 
banks so they could get low-interest loans, he added. The Dec. 19 
exhibition, billed ``The Game on Showtime,'' will include players 
from the 1992 and 1996 Olympic teams and members of the 1994 world 
championship team. Though Michael Jordan will not participate, the 
roster will include Patrick Ewing, Karl Malone, Anfernee Hardaway, 
Tim Hardaway, Allan Houston, Reggie Miller, Gary Payton, Dominique 
Wilkins, Vin Baker, Glen Rice, Tom Gugliotta and Mitch Richmond. Dan 
Majerle and Chris Webber have also agreed to play. Whether the promoters 
can pull off the event with eight days left is up for debate, however. 
Tickets will go on sale Friday after two delays because of seating 
configuration. The Associated Press reported that Atlantic City casinos 
have shown an ambivalence about the game _ another sign of problems. 
As of Thursday, Ticketmaster operators were still telling callers 
no information was available about the event. ``There's a lot of work, 
but I'm optimistic,'' Tellem said. ``This is not to replace the NBA,'' 
he added. ``The purpose of the game was several reasons: one, to have 
some basketball games being played and to show that the players want 
to play and they're being locked out by the owners; two, to do something 
worthwhile for charities; and finally, to achieve a political purpose, 
to show the players they can put on their own games.''
