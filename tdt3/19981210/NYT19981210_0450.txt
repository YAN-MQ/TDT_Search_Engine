At a time when the political fight over abortion centers on a late-term 
method that anti-abortion groups call partial-birth abortion, a new 
study by a nonprofit research group has estimated, for the first time, 
how often the method is used. According to the study by the Alan Guttmacher 
Institute, based on a survey of all known abortion providers in the 
United States, there were about 650 such abortions, known medically 
as ``intact dilation and extraction,'' at 14 hospitals or clinics 
in 1996. The study estimates that the procedure _ in which the legs 
of the fetus are partially delivered, the skull is punctured with 
a sharp object and the contents are removed by suction, to allow it 
to fit through the cervix _ accounted for about 0.03 to 0.05 percent 
of the 1.4 million abortions in 1996. Those numbers are projections 
based on the responses of nine abortion providers who collectively 
performed 363 such procedures. Douglas Johnson, legislative director 
of the National Right to Life Committee, said Thursday that those 
numbers were too low and might not include responses from the clinics 
and doctors that use the procedure most. Because of confidentiality 
concerns, Stanley Henshaw, deputy director of research at the Alan 
Guttmacher Institute, would not identify which providers had reported 
using the procedure. ``The numbers aren't exact, but I'm pretty sure 
it's in the 500 to 1,000 range,'' he said. The dispute over the numbers 
is in part definitional: The Guttmacher survey counted only procedures 
in which the fetus is killed by the ``partial evacuation of the intracranial 
contents of a living fetus.'' But many doctors kill the fetus before 
the contents are removed. Since 1995, 28 states have passed legislation 
banning so-called partial-birth abortion, using a broader definition 
than the survey did. Most of those bans have been blocked in court 
_ as New Jersey's was on Tuesday _ with several courts ruling that 
they were so broadly written as to cover other kinds of abortions. 
Congress twice passed a partial-birth abortion ban, but each time 
President Clinton vetoed it. The Guttmacher study sought information 
for the first time about the use of nonsurgical abortions, using either 
mifepristone, the French abortion pill known as RU-486, or methotrexate, 
an anti-cancer drug now being used to induce early abortion. The study 
found that these abortions, known as medical abortions, in which women 
take a combination of pills over several days, are spreading rapidly, 
with about 4,300 medical abortions in the first half of 1997, compared 
with 4,200 in all of 1996. Although the Food and Drug Administration 
has not yet approved the sale of mifepristone, some clinics offer 
it in clinical trials sponsored by Abortion Rights Mobilization, while 
other doctors and clinics use methotrexate, either in clinical trials 
for early abortions or as a use beyond the one for which it is specifically 
labeled. Although the FDA found in 1996 that mifepristone was ``approvable,'' 
the effort to get the drug to market bogged down in a tangle of legal, 
financial and manufacturing difficulties. Final FDA approval could 
come late next year.
