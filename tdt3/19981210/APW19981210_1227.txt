American star Valerie Kanavy on High Winds Jedi regained the title 
of World Endurance Champion Thursday after the defending champion, 
her daughter Danielle, retired after her horse took a tumble in the 
Dubai desert. The younger Kanavy, who won the title on Peirez four 
years ago in Kansas, dropped out after her 16-year-old grey gelding, 
Peirez, took a tumble 3 kilometers (2 miles) from the first veterinary 
checkpoint in the dlrs 300,000 race. No fewer than 174 riders set 
off at the crack of dawn at the Abu Dhabi town of Ghantoot and endured 
high temperatures as they steered their mounts along the 160-kilometer 
(99-mile) course. ``I am delighted to regain the world title, which 
also makes up a bit for the disappointments of my daughter on our 
favorite horse, Peirez,'' said Valerie Kanavy, 52, after cantering 
home in front of a huge crowd of sheiks and fans at Seyh Al Salam 
arena. ``The biggest problem I had was with the high temperatures 
which made me suffer. But my horse is wonderful,' Valerie said. Valerie 
and Danielle Kanavy have both won the world championship on Peirez 
before. Danielle, 27, was more worried about the condition of her 
beloved Peirez than her withdrawal. ``Peirez took a tumble about two 
miles (3.2 kilometers) from the first vet gate and though he looked 
okay, we decided not to risk him,'' she said. Her mother's win maintains 
the American hold on the championship since the first competition 
in 1986. Fausto Fioricci, a medical doctor from Italy, surprised the 
strong field by taking second place on Faris Jabar, another grey gelding. 
He finished about 50 meters (165 feet) behind Kanavy. Japan's Daisuke 
Yasunaga, who trained for the race in Australia, finished third, but 
he was eliminated after the finish because his horse failed a vet 
check. Sheik Hamdan bin Mohammed Al Maktoum's Ratzia D'Alauze, from 
the Emirates, was elevated to third place in place of Daisuke Yasunaga. 
No official timings were released by the organizers. A computer failure 
during the race caused confusion as the riders were left without waiting 
periods for the next stages. The Emirates took fourth and fifth places 
through Mohammed Ali Al Shaffar, on Abrock Theodore, and Sheik Hamdan 
bin Mohammed Al Maktoum, who rode Ratzia D'Alauze. Dubai's Crown Prince, 
Sheik Mohammed bin Rashid Al Maktoum, saw his hopes disappear when 
his horse, Nelson I, was eliminated by the veterinarians after failing 
an examination at the fourth check point. The sheik's eldest son, 
Sheik Rashid bin Mohammed, also had to retire.
