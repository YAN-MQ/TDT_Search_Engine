American astronaut Robert cabana and Russian cosmonaut sergi krikalev 
have become the first people to enter the international space station. 
Today, they floated side by side in the American-made unity Module, 
then flipped on the lights. For the next two days, the crew will be 
routing air ducts from shuttle "Endeavour" to the station and setting 
up a communications system. And they plan to fix a faulty battery 
in zarya, the Russian-made section of the station.
