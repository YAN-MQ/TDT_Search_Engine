Switzerland's first Jewish president said Thursday she will be more 
open than her predecessors in discussing her country's actions in 
World War II. Ruth Dreifuss, whose father lost his job in 1942 for 
helping people fleeing the Holocaust, said she will speak more openly 
to Swiss citizens and to the United States and Jewish groups about 
their past. The election gives her ``a great chance'' to contribute 
to the debate about neutral Switzerland's actions in the war and its 
efforts to repair wrongdoing, she said. Dreifuss, the interior minister 
responsible for social and health affairs, told the daily Le Temps 
that she had kept a low profile on the issue previously in part because 
it wasn't her role in government. She said she also didn't want to 
be seen as a ``token Jew'' to shield the government from attacks from 
Jewish organizations. ``It will be different in my role as president, 
which gives me much clearer legitimacy,'' Dreifuss said. ``It's an 
opportunity I intend to seize both in this country and abroad.'' Dreifuss 
was elected by parliament Wednesday to the one-year presidency for 
1999. The largely ceremonial job rotates among members of the seven-member 
coalition Cabinet, which she joined as a representative of the Social 
Democratic party in 1993. During the search for the assets of Holocaust 
victims in Swiss banks during the past 3 1/2 years, Switzerland has 
been heavily criticized by international Jewish organizations and 
the U.S. government. Dreifuss said she had read more about the Holocaust 
than the other members of the Cabinet, and that her personal and family 
history give her special insights. Dreifuss was born in 1940, soon 
after the outbreak of World War II, to a Swiss Jewish family. She 
said in an interview in the weekly L'Hebdo published Thursday that 
her early memories included the constant fear that Germany would invade 
Switzerland. Her father lost his job in textile imports and exports 
when he was caught in a network helping falsify documents for refugees 
so that they could enter Switzerland. She said she could empathize 
both with the 27,000 Jewish refugees allowed into Switzerland and 
the 30,000 who were turned back during the war. Dreifuss has said 
she thinks the Swiss government should compensate Jews who were sent 
back. The Nazis sent many of the returnees straight into concentration 
camps. A ``moving moment in our encounter with the past'' will come 
next spring when an international panel of historians appointed by 
the Swiss government reports on the wartime refugee policy, Dreifuss 
said. ``I will have to comment on it, to launch the debate,'' she 
said. ``It will also give me a chance to explain better to Jewish 
organizations where they are totally justified and legitimate in their 
demands and where they are less so. I think I will be able to do a 
lot and I don't have any complexes with Jewish representatives.'' 
She said she knows the United States and the way the international 
Jewish community functions better than her colleagues. Dreifuss, also 
the first Swiss woman to be president, said, ``the election of a Jewish 
female president of the confederation demonstrates that what would 
have been impossible just a few years ago has become normal.''
