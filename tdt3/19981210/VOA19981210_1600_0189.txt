The Palestinian Central Council has confirmed the nullification of 
clauses in the Palestinian charter. That call for Israel's destruction. 
The action is a Palestinian obligation under the Y River Peace Accord. 
The vote in the Palestinian's second most senior body sets the stage 
for Monday's meeting of the highest policy body. The Palestine National 
Council. That group is expected to affirm the changes to the charter. 
And support for the Peace Process in the presence of President Clinton.
