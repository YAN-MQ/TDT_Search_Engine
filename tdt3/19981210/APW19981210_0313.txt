Austria's Alexandra Meissnitzer dominated the women's Super-G field 
Thursday, posting her third World Cup win of the season. The 26-year-old 
blitzed down the classic 1,985-meter Piste-G course in 1 minute, 21.95 
seconds, leaving the rest of the field in her dust. Winner of the 
season-opening Super-G in Lake Louise, Canada, Meissnitzer finished 
a solid 0.79 seconds ahead of Germany's Martina Ertl, who is still 
winless this season. Regine Cavagnoud of France finished third, crossing 
in 1:22.94. It was Meissnitzer's third World Cup victory since the 
start of the season, the Austrian winning a giant slalom in Park City, 
Utah three weeks ago. The victory pads Meissnitzer's lead atop the 
rankings, where she sits with 525 points, ahead of Ertl, second with 
383.
