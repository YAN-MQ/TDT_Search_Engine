While the Monica Lewinsky scandal holds center stage on Capitol Hill, 
another sex scandal is making news in the very senior ranks of the 
military. A retired two-star army general faces accusations of improper 
relationships with the wives of four military officers. Here's NBC's 
Jim Miklaszewski. After waging a personal war with the U.S. army for 
nearly a year, donnamaria Carpino won her first major battle today. 
I finally see the light of justice. Today's a good day. In an unprecedented 
indictment, the army has charged retired major general David hale 
with 17 criminal counts involving sexual misconduct. Carpino claims, 
as her husband's commanding officer, hale forced her into a Four-month 
love affair. But after she complained to the army at the Pentagon 
hale was quietly permitted to retire. Carpino smelled a cover-up. 
But kept the heat on the arm. I feel vindicated. I think the surprise 
is on their part that I have kept per severing. But after months of 
investigation, the army has charged hale with, nine counts, that he 
had improper sexual relations with Carpino and the wives of three 
other officers, six counts that he lied to cover it up, two counts 
of obstruction of justice. Hale refuses to talk to the media but denied 
charges to investigators. Even though he's retired, hale now faces 
an article 32, the military equivalent of a grand jury hearing, at 
fort Lewis in Tacoma Washington, to determine if hale should be court-martialed. 
It hasn't court-martialed a again in nearly 50 years. The case against 
hale puts the brass on notice. I think at all levels of the military 
there's going to be more severe sanctions for this kind of behavior. 
If court-martialed and convicted he could face up to 49 years in prison 
and loss of all retirement benefits. Courtroom hearings are expected 
to begin early next year. Jim miklaszeski, NBC news, the Pentagon.
