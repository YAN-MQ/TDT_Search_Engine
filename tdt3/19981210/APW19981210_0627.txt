Palestinian prisoners have smuggled a plea for their freedom out of 
an Israeli jail to U.S. President Bill Clinton, and a copy of the 
letter was released Thursday. The United States is trying to resolve 
the bitter dispute between Israel and the Palestinians over prisoner 
releases that is threatening to derail the Wye River land-for-security 
accord. Clinton is arriving Saturday for a 4-day visit to Israel and 
the Palestinian areas. Israel has said it has met its obligations 
under the Wye agreement by releasing 250 prisoners _ most common criminals 
_ last month, the first group of a total of 750 to be freed by the 
end of January. The Palestinians say say they had been given to understand 
that all those freed would be prisoners held for anti-Israeli activities 
and have accused Israel of violating the Wye accord. Palestinian negotiator 
Saeb Erekat said the United States is trying to get Israel to accept 
a compromise under which Israeli, Palestinian and U.S. officials will 
review prisoner lists name by name and see whose release would be 
acceptable to all sides. About 2,000 so-called security prisoners 
are held by Israel and most have been on a hunger strike for a week. 
Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu's senior adviser, David 
Bar-Illan, could not immediately be reached for comment. In recent 
days, Palestinian marches for the release of prisoners turned violent. 
On Wednesday, thousands threw stones at Israeli soldiers who fired 
live rounds, rubber bullets and tear gas. A 17-year-old Palestinian 
was killed and scores of others were wounded. The prisoners' letter, 
written Nov. 22 in Nafha Prison, was smuggled out and delivered to 
officials at the U.S. Consulate in Jerusalem this week, said Issa 
Karakeh, head of the Palestinian Prisoners' Association. A copy of 
the letter was obtained by The Associated Press on Thursday. The letter, 
handwritten in English in tiny letters on a page of lined paper ripped 
out of a notebook, implores the U.S. president to take serious steps 
to win their release. The letter begins with the traditional Islamic 
blessing, ``In the name of God,'' and continues: ``Mr. President Clinton 
_ Hi, how are you, hoping you doing OK.'' It describes how their continued 
presence in jail has dashed their hopes for a better future. ``We 
were fighters before the peace to achieve our rights, and now we are 
prisoners looking forward to be free, to build our country,'' the 
letter said. As part of the protests, two tents simulating conditions 
in Israeli prisons have been set up in Gaza City, where Clinton will 
be on Monday. In one tent, 62 protesters _ most former prisoners _ 
were on a hunger strike led by Sufian Abu Zaideh, a deputy leader 
of the Palestinian Prisoners Association. ``Its not logical to sign 
a peace agreement with the leader, while the soldiers remain in jail,'' 
Abu Zaideh said. About half the prisoners are members of Palestinian 
leader Yasser Arafat's Fatah faction, while the others belong to the 
Islamic militant group Hamas which opposes the peace accord. The Palestinians 
have not contested that Hamas prisoners will not be eligible for early 
release. Still, the spiritual leader of the group, Sheik Ahmed Yassin, 
joined the hunger strike Wednesday. Yassin was placed under house 
arrest by Arafat in October.
