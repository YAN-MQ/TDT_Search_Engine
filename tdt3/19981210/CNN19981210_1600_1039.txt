The ax could fall soon in the aftermath of another big merger. Published 
reports say the new MCI Worldcom plans to eliminate more than 3,700 
jobs. This could be as much as 5% of that company's workforce. The

spokesman did say, however, the company hopes to cut costs by more 
than $1 billion next year.
