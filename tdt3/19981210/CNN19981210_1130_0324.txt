A less powerful air bag appears to be doing a better job protecting 
passengers, according to new government statistics. Calls for the 
new bags followed the deaths of 121 people. Most were children and 
shorter women. Many of those killed were involved in lower-speed accidents, 
they otherwise would have survived. Once the government eliminated 
a specific crash test, automakers installed the less powerful air 
bags. But national highway traffic safety administration officials 
caution that more research is needed before drawing any final conclusions 
on the effectiveness of the newer bags.
