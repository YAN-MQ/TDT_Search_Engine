In our Geography Quiz today, we're looking for a sheikdom where one 
of the world's toughest horse races is now underway. The race is a 
hundred-mile endurance test through the desert; 175 riders from 37 
countries are competing against heat exhaustion, difficult terrain, 
including sand dunes, scrub grasses, and flat barren stretches, and 
that's just the stuff you don't hallucinate. Our mystery destination 
is the second largest of the United Arab Emirates; not a lot of people 
here, just 300,000 or so, most of them in a sea port with the same 
name as the Emirate. Well, we're off to the races when we answer today's 
Geography Quiz later this hour.
