Hundreds of Serbs marched across southwestern Kosovo to a rebel stronghold 
in a peaceful protest Thursday against the disappearance of Serbs 
during the conflict in the tense province. Carrying banners reading 
``Stop Terrorism'' and ``Bring Our Relatives Back,'' about half the 
estimated 400 marchers completed a 20-kilometer (12-mile) walk from 
Orahovac to this KLA command post, where their leader held cordial 
but unproductive talks with a regional Albanian official. About 200 
Serbs have disappeared in Kosovo, including 40 from the mixed-ethnic 
town of Orahovac, and are believed to have been abducted by ethnic 
Albanian rebels. The rebels have released some of their hostages following 
mediation by international officials. But they claim to be no longer 
holding any, raising fears that many were killed. A local official 
with ties to the Kosovo Liberation Army denied knowledged of the Serb 
civilians' fate and said more than 1,500 Kosovo Albanians also are 
missing or believed kidnapped. ``You have come to the wrong address,'' 
Lulzim Paqarizi, regional secretary of the Albanians' Council for 
Defense of Human Rights and Freedoms, told the march leader. ``Our 
forces have never attacked Serb civilians.'' ``We believe this is 
the correct address,'' Orahovac Mayor Andeljko Kolasinac responded 
in the one-on-one meeting arranged hastily by U.S. peace verifiers 
now stationed in Dragobilje. The two shook hands afterward and the 
Serbs were bused home without incident. The march organizer told reporters 
earlier that the ``peace march'' was a symbol of solidarity for the 
families of the missing. ``We want to tell the public what consequences 
terrorism had here, and the tragedy of Orahovac,'' he said. One elderly 
woman on the march was supported by her two daughters, crying as she 
lamented: ``My life isn't worth anything without my son.'' A man whose 
two cousins have been missing for six months came from a village near 
the town of Suva Reka to join the walk. ``I came to protest because 
they are innocent,'' he said. ``Let foreign countries see that we 
are for peace.''
