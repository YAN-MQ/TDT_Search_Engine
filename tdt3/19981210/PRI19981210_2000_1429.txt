Also today in Malaysia, a witch doctor cast a spell on the court that's 
conducting the trial of former finance minister, Anwar Ibrahim. Dressed 
in a dark suit and tie, Datuk Ibrahim, no relation to the defendant, 
fell to his knees and banged his hands on the road outside the courthouse, 
intoning prayers that he claims will insure a fair trial. After the 
ceremony, Datuk Ibrahim looked at the court building through a hollow 
bamboo stick and said, everything should be fine. The witch doctor 
was then driven away in a Mercedes Benz. Such scenes are not uncommon 
in Malaysia, where people of all religious stripes take witch doctors 
very seriously.
