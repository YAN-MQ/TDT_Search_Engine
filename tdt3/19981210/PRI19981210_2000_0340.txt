A U.S. federal appeals court has cleared the way for a Canadian convict 
to be executed in Texas. Joseph Stanley Falder, who murdered a 75-year-old 
Texas widow in 1975, isn't due to be put to death tonight. If the 
execution goes ahead, he will be the first Canadian put to death in 
the U.S. in 46 years. This is THE WORLD.
