Ever since Worldcom Inc. took over MCI Communications Corp. in September, 
a rueful joke has been making the rounds at MCI's headquarters in 
Washington. ``When Bernie is done, this place will look like a neutron 
bomb hit it,'' one MCI employee says, referring to Worldcom chairman 
Bernard Ebbers. ``Why?'' another asks. ``Because the building will 
be standing, but the people will be gone.'' Ebbers' penchant for cutting 
jobs as a way to make his mergers reach their aggressive financial 
goals is well known. But at MCI, far fewer employees will lose their 
jobs as a result of the $37 billion takeover than some in the industry 
_ including within MCI _ had expected, and the cuts will not be concentrated 
in Washington. Friday, the company, which is now known as MCI Worldcom 
Inc., intends to inform about 2,000 employees, or 2.7 percent of its 
75,000-person work force, that their jobs will be eliminated, according 
to executives close to the company. Some on Wall Street had speculated 
that the company would eliminate as many as 3,750 jobs, or 5 percent 
of its work force. The executives said the job cuts would be concentrated 
in the combined company's network operations unit and in its software 
development operation. The jobs would be lost in dozens of places 
but primarily in Richardson, Texas, Carey, N.C., and Tulsa, Okla. 
The joke around headquarters had emerged from the fear that Ebbers 
would focus his job-cutting attention on corporate operations like 
the legal department, the regulatory affairs group and public relations. 
But instead of broad cuts at headquarters, Ebbers' team appears to 
have asked that existing employees in Washington take on broad new 
responsibilities. MCI Worldcom declined to comment. The job cuts are 
part of a program to cut $900 million from the combined company's 
sales, general and administrative expenses next year. It was unclear 
Thursday what portion of that goal the company intends to meet by 
eliminating jobs, but an annual cost of $100,000 a worker for 2,000 
workers would yield savings of $200 million. Over all, Ebbers intends 
to cut the combined company's costs by $2.5 billion next year. Apart 
from the administrative savings, most of the cost reduction are expected 
to come from moving communications traffic off of systems leased from 
other carriers and onto networks owned by MCI Worldcom.
