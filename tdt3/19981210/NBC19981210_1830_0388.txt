Even though these proceedings are getting wall-to-wall exposure on 
many cable television outlets and all news radio there's no evidence 
the public has suddenly stopped whatever else it was doing and is 
paying much closer attention to this critical political struggle that 
could end with the president on trial in the Senate. NBC's Jim Avila 
on the people and the coming political collision. It's become what 
many believe is irritating political white noise, practically ignored 
in Los Angeles. I would say people are showing more interest in my 
chicken Diablo than in this. Overkill in Chicago. I just had enough 
of it, that's why I'm not watching it. America shops as its president 
faces impeachment. A solid year of Monica, Paula and cable TV political 
sex talk has numbed much of America into a chorus of, "haven't we 
heard this before?" People think that with the elections, this issue 
was settled. They're Christmas shopping, and they they're picking 
up their newspaper. They're turning on "Nightly News," and they're 
saying "they're still talking about that in Washington." But in fact, 
it's crunch time, not over with at all. And while most of America 
goes about its business. You are listening to 720. On Chicago's top-rated 
talk station, today's morning topic is not impeachment. I think there 
is nothing left to say. Nothing in these hearings has sent a jolt 
through the electorate. I think they'll be even more surprised the 
people who didn't want to talk about it if impeachment happens. Wake 
up and go, what was going on? Many Americans say it's not apathy, 
it's frustration that has them tuning out. From evergreen, Colorado, 
where today Barber John golba watches game shows rather than impeachment 
hearings. The government is going to do what they want to do. Most 
of them don't listen to the people. To a soul food restaurant in Chicago. 
You know, it's like, "what can we do to stop this?" University of 
Chicago historian Tom Smith says rarely has public opinion been so 
roundly ignored on Capitol Hill. If you ignore them on the important 
issues most of the time, you become known as an ex-congressman. Potential 
backlash from a public suddenly awakened by an impeachment they say 
they don't want. Jim Avila, NBC news, Chicago.
