Albanian guerrillas. Fighting for Kosovo independence outside a major 
guerrilla base. Southwest of Pristina. The Serbians wanted information 
on family members. They believe Kosovo Liberation Army guerrillas 
have held since July. More than one thousand Serbians started on the 
15 km march to the base in Dregobillia from Orovich. A town the KLA 
briefly were in last summer. Police and international monitors persuaded 
all but 150 of the marchers to turn back.
