Some 5,000 workers marched through the capital Thursday, throwing 
firecrackers to protest falling living standards, threatened job cuts 
and what they see as the government's failure to reform the economy. 
``We want to work not beg,'' chanted angry workers from the defense, 
subway, energy and heavy industry sectors who gathered in a central 
square. Workers, some of who had not received their salaries for months, 
came from cities around the country. Workers also asked the government 
to allocate more money to health and education. Unions claim the government 
could get extra funds from the underground economy which accounts 
for 35 percent of Romania's economic activity last year. Most of the 
money is in customs' tax evasion. In the Transylvanian city of Brasov, 
some 150 kilometers (95 miles) northwest of the capital, about 800 
employees at the IAR Ghimbav airplane manufacturers took to the streets 
to protest possible job cuts. The government has said that it will 
axe some 70,000 jobs at state enterprises in coming months as it closes 
down loss-making companies to cut debts to the Romanian economy by 
15 percent. Prime Minister Radu Vasile tried during two days of talks 
to convince trade unions leaders to cease street protests for six 
months while reforms are implemented. Some unions accepted and others 
refused. Some 170,000 workers have already been laid off this year. 
Unemployment is about 9 percent. The National Bloc of Trade Unions 
which represents 600,000 workers said on Friday they would stage protests 
outside the houses of the prime minister, President Emil Constantinescu, 
and other ministers in charge with reform. The government promised 
IAR Ghimbav to find a foreign investor by Dec. 1, but the deadline 
expired. Workers were sent home and are receiving a part of their 
salary. Negotiations between IAR Ghimbav and U.S. Bell Helicopter 
Textron for a joint venture failed to materialize in a deal this year. 
Bell was asking the Romania army to buy 96 attack helicopters as part 
of the deal which would cost the cash-strapped government dlrs 1.45 
billion.
