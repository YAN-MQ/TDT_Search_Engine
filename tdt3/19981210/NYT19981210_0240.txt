A unanimous U.S. Supreme Court ruled Tuesday that police cannot search 
a driver or the driver's car if the original stop was for a traffic 
violation and the driver merely ticketed. It is a welcome decision 
to anyone who cherishes privacy. And unexpected. The ruling is one 
of the few times that the high court, during Chief Justice William 
Rehnquist's tenure, has defended a person's right to be free of searches 
while in an automobile. The police do not need a warrant to search 
an automobile, only probable cause. Understandably, a car might be 
driven off and evidence destroyed before a warrant could be obtained. 
The exception to this rule is a car parked in the driveway of the 
suspect's home. Patrick Knowles was stopped in Newton, Iowa, for speeding. 
The police officer, following Iowa law, had a choice of arresting 
Knowles or issuing him a citation. The officer wrote a ticket and 
then, as allowed by Iowa law, conducted a full search of the car without 
Knowles' permission and without probable cause. The officer found 
a bag of marijuana and a pot pipe. Knowles was then arrested and charged 
with violating laws dealing with controlled substances. Knowles moved 
to suppress the evidence as illegally obtained. He lost in the Iowa 
courts and appealed to the U.S. Supreme Court. Rehnquist wrote the 
opinion for the court. While recognizing that officer safety is a 
prime concern _ the usual rationale for searching a person under arrest 
_ Rehnquist noted that a traffic citation puts the police officer 
in much less danger. He also noted with heavy irony: ``Once Knowles 
was stopped for speeding and issued a citation, all the evidence necessary 
to prosecute the offense had been obtained. No further evidence of 
excessive speed was going to be found either on the person of the 
offender or in the passenger compartment of the car.'' We applaud 
the high court. This is a rare victory for privacy rights. We'd like 
to see more respect for our privacy.
