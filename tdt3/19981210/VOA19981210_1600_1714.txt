Well, we're coming up on 22 hours, Universal time. And that means 
we're closing down all frequencies to the Middle East, North Africa, 
and Europe. Except for 1548 kHz medium wave to the Persian Gulf Region. 
In Europe during the next hour, VOA News Now can be heard on WRN1, 
Via Astra channel 22, audio subcarrier 7.38 MHz. VOA News Now continues 
to East Asia on 7.215, 9.77, 9.89, 11.76, 15.185, 15.29, 15.305, 17.735, 
and 17.82 MHz short-wave. Stay tuned as VOA News Now continues. It's 
21 hours 30, Universal time. And this is VOA News Now. Democratic 
and Republican investigators for the House of Representatives' Judiciary 
Committee give sharply different views on whether President Clinton 
should be impeached. Chile's former dictator, Augusto Pinochet, is 
formally indicted in Spain. On charges of genocide, terrorism, and 
torture. And on today's Dateline, an examination of North Korea and 
its weapons program. All in this half hour of VOA News Now. Now a 
summary of world news.
