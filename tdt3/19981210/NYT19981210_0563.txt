The New York Times said in an editorial on Friday, Dec. 11: The controversy 
over using the book ``Nappy Hair'' at a Brooklyn elementary school 
has had predictably distressing effects. Now a principal at an intermediate 
school in the same district has decided against using two excellent 
books in the sixth grade, apparently for fear of parental protests. 
The initial protests occurred at Public School 75 in Bushwick, where 
a new teacher, Ruth Sherman, was attacked by parents because she had 
read to her third-grade class a book about a young African-American 
girl's appreciation of her kinky hair. The book has been praised and 
recommended for classroom use by reading experts at Columbia University's 
Teachers College. It was written by Carolivia Herron, an African-American 
professor, to celebrate racial diversity and pride. But some parents, 
based on photocopies of pages from the book, instantly judged the 
material to be racially insensitive. At a school meeting they screamed 
at Ms. Sherman, who is white, and some even threatened her safety. 
Ms. Sherman, understandably frightened, requested and received a transfer 
out of the district. The school administrators, though they supported 
her, should have mounted a more vigorous defense against the ridiculous 
racism charge. Instead the offensive behavior of the parents went 
unchecked, sending a message to other teachers that they too could 
be attacked for using good books that might contain anything deemed 
objectionable by a handful of hotheads. At Intermediate School 296, 
sixth-graders will not be assigned two good books, because they might 
be controversial. ``The War Comes to Willy Freeman,'' a critically 
acclaimed novel about blacks in the Revolutionary War, and ``Days 
of Courage: The Little Rock Story'' both contain a racial epithet 
in a historical context. Elsewhere around the nation, Mark Twain's 
``Adventures of Huckleberry Finn'' and Maya Angelou's ``I Know Why 
the Caged Bird Sings'' are two books routinely challenged on language 
and subject matter. Efforts to keep those and other books out of students' 
hands only deprive them of opportunities to learn how to deal with 
racial and other sensitive matters in honest and respectful ways.
