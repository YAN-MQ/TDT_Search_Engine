An unknown attacker shot and killed Armenia's deputy minister of defense 
on Thursday, a spokesman in Armenia's Interior Ministry said. The 
48-year-old minister, Bagram Khorkhoruni, was killed outside his apartment 
as he left for work early in the morning, said Interior Ministry spokesman 
Vladimir Grigoryan. Officials had no explanation for the killing. 
Police found seven bullet casings at the scene, and an investigation 
into the shooting was underway. Khorkhoruni, who was married and had 
three children, served in his post since 1997. Before that, he worked 
in the Armenian Interior Ministry. An army veteran, he was also a 
policeman earlier in his career. Armenia, an ex-Soviet republic in 
the Caucasus Mountains, has seen a sharp increase in crime in recent 
years.
