Political leaders and human rights activists around the world are 
marking the 50th anniversary of the Universal Declaration of Human 
Rights. U.N. Secretary General Kofi Annan urged people to build on 
the legacy of the original document. The U.N. General Assembly called 
a special all-day session in New York. President Clinton, speaking 
at the White House, declared there is work left to be done. In totalitarian 
states like North Korea. In military dictatorships like Burma. In 
countries where leaders practice the politics of ethnic hatred, like 
Serbia. And Iraq. In African nations where tribal differences have 
led unimaginable slaughter. In nations where tolerance and faith must 
struggle against intolerant fundamentalism, like Afghanistan. And 
Sudan. Amidst celebrations around the world, there are also numerous 
protests. Reminding people the declaration written 50 years ago is 
still not a reality for all.
