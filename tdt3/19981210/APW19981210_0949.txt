Hungary will request a 10-year delay from the European Union before 
allowing foreigners to purchase farmland, the Finance Minister said 
Thursday. There have been other precedents for such request, and the 
EU usually accepts them, Zsigmond Jarai told reporters after the regular 
weekly cabinet meeting. Foreign land ownership has been a very delicate 
topic in Hungary's EU accession issue, as many politicians and experts 
would see free purchase as the looting of the country. Arable land 
is very cheap in Hungary as compared to EU standards, and hopefully 
prices will catch up with them before the exemption period expires, 
Jarai said. At present only Hungarians are allowed to buy arable land 
in the country. Hungarian corporations are also excluded, in an attempt 
to filter out any possibility for foreigners to gain even minority 
shares. The junior partners of the ruling coalition, the agrarian-based 
Smallholders Party are against any foreign ownership at any time. 
Hungary is among the first group of former communist countries, along 
with Poland, the Czech Republic, Estonia and Slovenia to become full-fledged 
members of the EU in a few years' time.
