Checking the hour's top stories -- the house Judiciary committee is 
hearing what amounts to closing arguments in its presidential impeachment 
inquiry. The committee's democratic counsel spoke this morning. Abbe 
Lowell contended there is "very little evidence," and the U.S. should 
not be put through a divisive impeachment trial in the Senate. Republican 
counsel David schippers is urging the committee to support articles 
of impeachment that charge President Clinton lied under oath. If the 
committee approves the articles, speaker Newt Gingrich says debate 
by the full house could begin next Thursday.
