Alexander Solzhenitsyn celebrates his 80th birthday Friday, his influence 
waning but his grumpy voice still railing against Russian leaders 
he denounces as foolish and corrupt. With his long gray beard and 
severe countenance, Solzhenitsyn cultivates the image of a 19th-century 
sage. His place in history is assured by his monumental works chronicling 
the atrocities of Soviet-era prison camp life. But today he is largely 
ignored in Russia, where many regard him as a cranky old man whose 
words have little relevance amid the country's current turmoil. ``He 
played a great role in history, but not in literature, because he 
has no followers in literature,'' said Russian writer Vladimir Voinovich. 
``His role is more historical now.'' Since returning to Russia in 
1994 after 20 years in exile, Solzhenitsyn and his wife Natalya have 
maintained a reclusive existence on the outskirts of Moscow. However, 
his birthday has brought a temporary surge of public attention. He 
visited the Swedish Embassy on Thursday evening, where he and other 
Nobel laureates were feted. And Friday, he planned to attend a play, 
``Sharashka,'' based on an adaptation of his novel ``The First Circle.'' 
His most recent book, ``Russia in Collapse,'' was published this summer 
with an initial run of just 5,000. It sold better than expected, and 
another 5,000 copies were ordered. In his recent writings and speeches, 
Solzhenitsyn has bemoaned Russia's disintegration and condemned the 
country's post-Soviet leaders as no better than the communist rulers 
he so reviled. ``The system of central power ... is just as uncontrollable, 
lacking any public responsibility and immune from punishment as the 
communist power was,'' he wrote in 1996. ``As much as we wish to, 
it cannot be called democracy.'' In modern Russia, serious writers 
have lost the elevated status they had in communist times, and Solzhenitsy 
has lamented that his compatriots no longer read his work in large 
numbers. His conservative and nationalist views have come under fire 
from liberals, and he's also despised by hard-liners for his militant 
anti-communism. Still, no one denies his enormous impact during the 
Soviet era. ``The influence of Solzhenitsyn on Russian literature 
and, in general, on Russian history was enormous _ incomparable to 
any other writer in this century,'' said Yegor Gaidar, a former prime 
minister. ``He is a great writer, public figure and fighter,'' said 
writer Fazil Iskander. ``His greatest role was in fighting and exposing 
the totalitarian (Soviet) regime. There was no equal to him.'' In 
a country where the average man doesn't live to 60, Solzhenitsyn still 
appears vigorous and lucid at 80, although he did suffer a mild heart 
attack two years ago. Solzhenitsyn maintains Russia's past decade 
of change has accomplished little aside from tearing down communism. 
``I see no changes for the better,'' he said in a rare speech last 
year. ``We are doing everything to destroy Russia. We have no market, 
no democracy _ a wild predatory capitalism is being built here.'' 
Solzhenitsyn had already laid bare the country's gulag, or prison 
camp system, and achieved international renown when he was arrested 
by Soviet authorities and exiled in 1974. He settled in rural Vermont 
and maintained monastic discipline, producing a multi-volume saga 
of Russian history, ``The Red Wheel.'' It was less successful than 
his best-known works _ ``One Day in the Life of Ivan Denisovich'' 
and the three-volume ``The Gulag Archipelago'' _ his portrayals of 
life in Soviet forced-labor camps, where he spent eight years for 
writing a letter criticizing Soviet leader Josef Stalin. Solzhenitsyn's 
books still have meaning for Zoya Marchenko, 91, who spent more than 
20 years in labor camps. ``It seems to me that he is now fulfilling 
his duty to the dead,'' she said. ``He knows how many young and talented 
people were killed. For me, at any rate, Solzhenitsyn is a symbol 
of bravery, honesty and truth.''
