Angola's president tightened his grip on his governing MPLA Party 
when three of his most influential rivals failed to win reelection 
to the party leadership Thursday. Prime Minister Franca van Dunem, 
MPLA Secretary-General Lopo do Nascimento and former prime minister 
Marcolino Moco were voted off the party's central committee at its 
annual congress. They were replaced by three of Jose Eduardo dos Santos' 
closest supporters _ Public Administration Minister Pitra Neto, Lisbon 
ambassador Jose Patricio, and presidential aide Jose Leitao. Neto 
was widely expected to replace Van Dunem as prime minister in the 
coming weeks, while Patricio was tipped to be appointed foreign minister 
in an expected year-end reshuffle. Dos Santos, who has kept an iron 
grip on the Popular Movement for the Liberation of Angola, or MPLA, 
since he took over its leadership in 1979, was reelected as party 
leader. He was the only candidate. In his closing speech to the five-day 
congress, Dos Santos did not refer to fighting in the central highlands 
between the government army and rebel group UNITA which reportedly 
broke out last week. The battles apparently marked an end to the U.N.-brokered 
1994 peace pact between the two sides which fought a two-decade civil 
war following the southwest African country's 1975 independence from 
Portugal.
