An unknown attacker shot and killed Armenia's deputy minister of defense 
today. The 48-year-old minister, Bagram Khorkhoruni, was killed outside 
his apartment as he left for work, said Interior Ministry spokesman 
Vladimir Grigoryan. Officials had no explanation for the killing. 
Police found seven bullet casings at the scene. Khorkhoruni, who was 
married and had three children, had been deputy defense minister since 
1997. Before that, he worked in the Interior Ministry. An army veteran, 
he was also a policeman earlier in his career. Armenia, a former Soviet 
republic in the Caucasus Mountains, has seen a sharp increase in crime 
in recent years.
