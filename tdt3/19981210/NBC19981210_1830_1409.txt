The federal election commission rejected its own auditer's recommendation 
and decided not to order the '96 campaigns of Clinton and Dole to 
repay millions of dollars in tax99 taxpayer matching funds. The auditors 
said the campaigns illegally coordinated some TV ads, known as issue 
ads, with their political parties. But the board said the ads didn't 
explicitly ask people to vote for the candidates, so they didn't violate 
the law.
