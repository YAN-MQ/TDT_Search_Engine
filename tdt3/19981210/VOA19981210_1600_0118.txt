Iraq says its ruling party headquarters in Baghdad is off-limits to 
U.N. weapons inspectors. Prompting a renewed U.S. warning of punitive 
air strikes. A senior Iraqi official says the inspectors, who tried 
to enter the offices Wednesday. Will not find any materials there 
related to weapons programs. And will be turned back if they return. 
U.S. Defense Secretary William Cohen, noting a previous conversation 
with Chief U.N. weapons inspector Richard Butler. Said Iraq's refusal 
could prompt a U.S.-led military attack without warning. Well, as 
Mr. Butler indicated yesterday. He considered it to be a very serious 
situation. He also indicated he was going to continue to complete 
ONSCOM's activities throughout next week. We intend to wait until 
the completion of his inspection and that of his team. Before coming 
to any conclusion about the nature of the lack of cooperation on part 
of Saddam Hussein. So we -- I agree with Mr. Butler. That this is 
a serious matter. We also think it's important they be allowed to 
complete their mission. Defense Secretary William Cohen.
