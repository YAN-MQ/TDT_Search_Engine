For THE WORLD, this is Alan Dow in the BBC newsroom in London. Iraq 
has issued another challenge to U.N. weapons inspectors. It says they'll 
be denied access to any building of Saddam Hussein's ruling Ba'ath 
Party. From Baghdad, the BBC's Jeremy Cook reports. There is a new 
and defiant tone from the Iraqis. The contention is that these are 
private sites and not covered by any agreement struck between the 
government here and the United Nations. It's all a clear challenge 
to the weapons inspectors. They believe that the agreement reached 
last month to avert air strikes at the 11th hour gives them the right 
to visit any site in Iraq at any time they choose. The chief weapons 
inspector, Richard Butler, will report to the United Nations secretary 
general on this latest phase of operations. That report will be crucial 
in dictating the future course of this ongoing crisis. Jeremy Cook 
in Baghdad.
