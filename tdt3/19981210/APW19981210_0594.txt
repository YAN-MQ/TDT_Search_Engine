Israeli warplanes broke the sound barrier over a nervous Beirut for 
the second day Thursday, prompting Lebanon to seek U.N. help in ending 
the ``sonic bombardment'' of the Lebanese capital. Beirut _ still 
recovering from a devastating 1975-90 civil war _ is on edge because 
Israel has threatened to hit Lebanese power plants and other utilities 
to retaliate for guerrilla attacks that killed seven Israeli soldiers 
in southern Lebanon last month. Eight supersonic booms caused by low-flying 
jets rattled windows of apartment buildings and set off the alarms 
of vehicles on Thursday. The maneuvers frayed the nerves of people 
who were frightened by similar deafening bangs a day earlier. The 
Israeli planes made several runs over the city on Wednesday, including 
the lowest such flights in years that sent people seeking cover for 
fear the city was under attack. Many here still remember Israel's 
1982 invasion of Beirut, when the city came under heavy air and naval 
attack. The last time Israeli military aircraft attacked Beirut was 
during an April 1996 bombing blitz of Lebanon that killed at least 
175 people. During those strikes, Israeli helicopter gun ships rocketed 
guerrilla offices in southern Beirut and jet fighters blasted two 
power stations in hills overlooking the capital. Israeli jets also 
broke the sound barrier over southern Lebanon on Thursday. Asked Wednesday 
about the flights, an Israeli Army spokesman said: ``We do not divulge 
movements of the air force.'' The spokesman, who cannot be identified 
under Israeli rules, would not comment further. Prime Minister Salim 
Hoss on Wednesday denounced the Israeli flights as ``aggressive and 
provocative.'' On Thursday, Hoss called on a special multinational 
committee that monitors a 1996 truce to discuss the flights because 
they are ``terrifying the civilian population, especially children,'' 
Beirut Radio reported. Hoss also said Lebanon would ask U.N. Secretary 
General Kofi Annan to intercede with Israel. He briefed diplomats 
representing the five permanent members of the U.N. Security Council 
_ the United States, Britain, France, China and Russia _ on Lebanon's 
position, the radio said. The leading An-Nahar newspaper described 
the Israeli action in a front-page headline as ``sonic bombardment.'' 
The Lebanese Hezbollah guerrilla group has been fight to drive Israeli 
troops and their allied militiamen from southern Lebanon, where the 
Jewish state set up a self-styled ``security zone'' in 1985 to protect 
its northern settlements from cross-border guerrilla attacks. The 
Iranian-backed Hezbollah, or Party of God, claimed responsibility 
for most of the attacks on the Israeli soldiers last month.
