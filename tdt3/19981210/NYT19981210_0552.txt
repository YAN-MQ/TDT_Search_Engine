A bitter wind carried sobs of grief, mournful farewells and the funereal 
tones of Bach through Old Campus at Yale on Thursday, as several hundred 
friends and relatives of Suzanne Jovin, the senior who was slain last 
Friday not far from the university, gathered at Battell Chapel for 
a memorial service. New Haven police said they have no suspects in 
the killing. A Yale lecturer who was Ms. Jovin's adviser, James Van 
de Velde, told The New Haven Register on Wednesday that he had been 
questioned twice by the police, but he denied that he was involved 
in the slaying. ``I'm an innocent person,'' Van de Velde said in Thursday's 
issue of The Register. ``I hope in a week from now there will be a 
story on the real killer.'' Van de Velde did not return a message 
left on his answering machine. Yale's vice president and secretary, 
Linda Koch Lorimer, Wednesday released a statement about an article 
Wednesday in The Register saying a Yale teacher was a suspect in the 
slaying. The Yale statement, which cautioned that police had not named 
any suspects and had not disclosed who had been interviewed, said, 
``If a member of the Yale community were, in fact, responsible for 
this horrible crime, it would be appalling.'' The developments in 
Ms. Jovin's killing come on the heels of another case that has disturbed 
the Yale campus, the accusations against Antonio Lasaga, a Yale geology 
professor who last month was charged with possessing child pornography 
retrieved from the Internet. According to published reports, Lasaga 
was re-arrested Wednesday after federal agents testified that he had 
been spotted near the home of a minor who was a victim in the case, 
a violation of the conditions for his release. Officials did not say 
how the child was related to the case. Thursday, the focus at Yale 
was not so much on the facts of Ms. Jovin's killing, which occurred 
in the East Rock neighborhood, about two miles from her home off campus. 
Instead, thanks to a speaker system set up on the Old Campus green, 
the air was filled with poignant remembrances of Ms. Jovin, a 21-year-old 
political science major from Gottingen, Germany. ``My wife and I gave 
Suzanne the gift of her life _ it was taken away last week by the 
act of a wanton and senseless individual,'' said her father, Thomas 
Jovin, who faltered at times through his speech. About 500 students, 
teachers, university officials, family members, and friends attended 
the hour-and-a-half memorial service at the chapel. Mourners blinked 
away tears when a friend read a tribute from one of the people who 
knew Ms. Jovin from the Yale chapter of Best Buddies, a program she 
ran that pairs mentally disabled people with students. Ms. Jovin was 
making pizzas with the group an hour before she was killed. ``Suzanne 
was a sweet person and a good friend who did a lot for me _ she always 
helped me feel better when I was stressed,'' said a letter from Ms. 
Jovin's Best Buddy, Lee Brown, that was read by Rebecca Rosen, a Yale 
senior. In tributes printed in Wednesday's Yale Daily News, Ms. Jovin 
was remembered as an energetic, optimistic woman dedicated to helping 
others. One of those tributes came from Van de Velde. ``When I met 
Suzanne this past September,'' he wrote, ``I was immediately taken 
by her deep enthusiasm for life, her infectious positive outlook, 
her insightfulness, and her commitment to learning. She inspired me 
with her enthusiasm and her interest in making a difference in the 
world. She is someone I will always remember.''
