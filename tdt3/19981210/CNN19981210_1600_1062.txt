Toymaker Hasbro has settled an antitrust suit brought by 44 states, 
the district of Columbia and Puerto Rico. New York state's attorney 
general first sued Hasbro last year, along with toys "R" us, Mattel, 
Tyco industries and little tykes. He alleged that they conspired to 
withhold popular toys from low-price stores in order to stifle competition. 
Hasbro will pay a fine of $2.4 million. It will also provide more 
than $3.5 million in toys to be distributed through the Marines' toys 
for tots program. But the companies will admit no wrongdoing.
