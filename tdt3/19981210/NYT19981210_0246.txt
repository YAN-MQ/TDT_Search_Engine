Not since Alfred Hitchcock put poor Tippi Hedren through all that 
nasty pecking have so many unwelcome birds crowded into a single landscape. 
In `` `Hope' Is the Thing With Feathers,'' the new drama by Frank 
Pugliese and the latest offering from the Drama Dept., there are avian 
visitors galore. True, they appear mostly as poetic conceits rather 
than physical creatures, but they are dominating, noisy things all 
the same, chattering up a symbolic storm. Consider, by way of example, 
the following occurrences found in the last few minutes of the drama. 
A young woman holds up a cage with a white dove inside while delivering 
homilies on life and rebirth. In the meantime, on the other side of 
the stage, a bird (invisible) swoops into a New York apartment just 
as a group of four is sitting down to a nourishing meal of _ what 
else? _ bird's nest soup. It honestly doesn't spoil the evening's 
ending to report that these events, which are set against the sight 
of a somewhat birdlike boy falling through the sky, are meant to signify 
the continuing renewal of hope in the human spirit. `` `Hope' Is the 
Thing With Feathers'' may not be much of a play, but it does have 
the courage of its literal-mindedness. The title of Pugliese's work 
comes from the poem by Emily Dickinson, and he does indeed seem to 
reach for a Dickinsonian grasp of the eternal in the everyday. Interlinking 
stories of three couples of different ages who have all lost faith 
in the future, ``Hope'' is replete with metaphoric considerations 
of objects like seashells, trees, loaves of bread, cornflowers and 
newspapers in which Italian sandwiches are wrapped. Pugliese, who 
is best known for his 1993 drama, ``Aven'U Boys,'' which brought to 
mind a frillier version of Hubert Selby Jr.'s ``Last Exit to Brooklyn,'' 
has always shown a lyrical bent. The pleasure he takes in linguistic 
flourish and careful patterns of imagery can be refreshing. Here, 
however, the overall effect is of looking into the literary journals 
of a precocious, sensitive plant of a high school student, the sort 
of ruminations writers tend to burn in middle age. The real surprise 
is that ``Hope'' comes from the Drama Dept. Since making its debut 
with a witty and touching revival of Tennessee Williams' ungainly 
``Kingdom of Earth'' two years ago, this troupe has seemed incapable 
of making a false move, scoring with everything from a deconstruction 
of ``Uncle Tom's Cabin'' to Douglas Carter Beane's frothy dissection 
of celebrity culture, ``As Bees In Honey Drown.'' Oh, well. Five out 
of six, by the standards of today's theater, not only ain't bad, it's 
close to miraculous. And no one associated with the staging of ``Hope'' 
is treating it as an ugly stepchild. Set against a tiered backdrop 
of Magritte-like blue skies, the work of the terrific projection designer 
Wendall K. Harrington, the show's look attractively matches the poetic 
ether of Pugliese's text. The director, Randolph Curtis Rand (of ``Uncle 
Tom's Cabin''), brings clarity and discipline to the proceedings. 
And the excellent six-member cast tackles its Kahlil-Gibran-like dialogue 
with a no-nonsense precision that keeps the evening less sticky than 
it could be, though it's not easy wrestling with lines like ``We build 
Great Walls of China in our tiny hearts.'' Cynthia Nixon, as a spiky-haired, 
commitment-fearing journalist, and Maria Tucci, as a temperamental 
doctor's wife, manage to hit occasional moments of sharp emotional 
resonance. Keith Nobbs and Robert Hogan, as a disillusioned teen-age 
hoodlum and a disillusioned doctor, wear their respective burdens 
of youth and age with restrained flair, and Avery Glymph is quietly 
appealing as Ms. Nixon's lover. Paula Garces, a very pretty young 
actress who portrays the play's most whimsical character (and that's 
saying a lot), isn't always audible. Given that she is asked to say 
things like, ``Hope is a tree,'' this may be for the best. PRODUCTION
