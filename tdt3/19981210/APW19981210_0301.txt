Five people received minor injuries from a small explosion early Thursday, 
in the first incident threatening the calm of this northern city since 
the armed Basque separatist group ETA declared an unlimited cease-fire 
in September. The explosion at the home of a Spanish civil guard at 
4 a.m. (0300gmt), was caused by fireworks soaked in gasoline, Interior 
Ministry spokeswoman Paz Dors said. Five people, not identified by 
name, required medical attention including the wife of the targeted 
civil guard who received burns to the face and hands. Four neighbors 
were also taken to hospital after inhaling fumes from the explosion 
that damaged doors and broke windows at the house, Dors said. ``This 
is the first time something like this has happened here since the 
cease-fire,'' Dors said, referring to the truce observed by ETA since 
Sept. 18. ETA's cease-fire triggered talk of possible peace negotiations 
with the government aimed at putting a definitive end to the violence 
that has surrounding the issue of Basque separatist aspirations for 
30 years. The spokeswoman said it was not known who was behind Wednesday's 
explosion, but that the only people with a tradition of similar attacks 
in the city were young supporters of ETA. ETA includes Pamplona, and 
the province of Pamplona, in its vision of an independent Basque state, 
despite the fact that they are located south of the current definition 
of the Basque province. An acronym standing for Basque Homeland and 
Liberty, ETA has killed nearly 800 people since 1968 when it began 
its violent campaign for an independent state straddling northern 
Spain and southern France. In recent years the group's bombings and 
shootings have been accompanied by low-intensity pressure carried 
out by the group's supporters against such targets as Spanish civil 
guards who are believed to represent an occupying force in the Basque 
homeland. This kind of violence virtually disappeared with the cease-fire 
declaration.
