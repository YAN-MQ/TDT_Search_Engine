U.N. weapons inspectors are continuing their surprise inspections 
in Iraq, but arguments between the United Nations and Baghdad are 
ongoing. Richard Roth reports. Chief U.N. weapons inspector Richard 
Butler has told the U.N. security council Wednesday's near standoff 
in Baghdad was not the only time iraq has interfered with probers 
this month. Besides Thursday's 45-minute delay for UNSCOM in gaining 
entry to state security offices, a report by Butler lists three other 
attempts to deny access. The council was told that Iraqi officials 
tried to prevent videotaping and interrupted biological team from 
interviewing Iraqi personnel. For now Butler is not looking for a 
fight. We had some difficulties this morning. But we resolved them. 
I'm obliged to report to the security council through the secretary-general 
early next week on this period, whether or not Iraq has cooperated. 
Kofi Annan urges Iraq again to permit access. Obviously, we all expect 
Iraq to comply with security council resolutions and they did indicate 
on that fateful weekend in November that they will do that and they 
will do it unconditionally. I would ask them to do that. Britain and 
the U.S. have said they were in a hair-trigger mode on Iraq. Asked 
if Iraq was still subject to attack at any time, William Cohen said 
-- The answer is yes. The current president of the council, the only 
Arab state among the 15 countries, Bahrain is more sympathetic to 
Iraqi concerns. When you execute any work between two parties, there 
might be some problems. But it just seems and hopefully that they 
are not problems that will stand in the way of normalizing the relations 
between Iraq and UNSCOM. But the number of incidents could grow as 
no notice inspection teams fan out for the next few days. The U.N. 
weapons inspectors say they're not running to ba'ath party offices 
where they were blocked Wednesday. One UNSCOM official said, we're 
not going back in this round. We've moved on. Where the teams go next 
and how they're received by Baghdad may determine whether the security 
council determines if Iraq is living up to its promises to cooperate.
