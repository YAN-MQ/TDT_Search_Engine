Chinese border police have caught two Nepalese trying to smuggle the 
skeletons of two tigers out of Tibet. Border police found 49 kilograms 
(107 pounds) of tiger bones inside the suitcases of two nervous-looking 
Nepalese men last month, the Tibet Daily reported on Dec. 1. The report 
did not provide further details. A belief, especially among Chinese, 
that tiger body parts and bones have medicinal properties has created 
a lucrative market and caused the animal to be hunted to near extinction 
in Asia.
