Police ended Thursday their investigation of an Orthodox priest who 
is accused of armed robbery and indecent proposals to women he held 
hostage, a police officer said. Father Nicolae, whose full name and 
age were not disclosed by police, was arrested 45 days ago after, 
after he and six men robbed passengers in three buses which were traveling 
from the former Soviet Republic of Moldova north to Ukraine. Maj. 
Vladimir Botnaru, of Chisinau police said that several victims, mainly 
women, had declared that they were ordered to completely undress at 
gunpoint by a group of robbers and all their jewels, wedding rings 
and earrings were stolen. Nicolae who was not dressed in his priest 
robes at the time made indecent proposals to several women but other 
robbers stopped him acting out his proposals, Botnaru said, quoting 
the victims' statements. Father Nicolae was arrested in October and 
is now in prison in the city of Soroca, some 100 kilometers (62 miles) 
north of Chisinau. Botnaru did not say when his trial would start 
but said the priest whose parish is near Chisinau could get from 12 
to 25 years in prison. The Moldovan Orthodox church has excommunicated 
Nicolae. Four men who took part in the robberies were later caught 
by police, two in Moscow and two in Chisinau. Another two are at large 
in Russia and Moldova, police believe.
