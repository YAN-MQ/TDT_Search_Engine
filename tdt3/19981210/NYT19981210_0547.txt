The Mets were waiting to hear from Rickey Henderson's representatives 
Thursday night about their offer of a one-year deal with an option 
for a second. While he waited, General Manager Steve Phillips completed 
a minor trade for a 21-year-old prospect. And Manager Bobby Valentine 
did not wait at all when the subject of one of his former players, 
Todd Hundley, was broached. ``There's no change from yesterday,'' 
Phillips said about Henderson, referring to his offer of a one-year 
deal with a base salary of about $1.7 million with incentive bonuses 
and a vested option that kicks in if Henderson fulfills certain provisions. 
Henderson's representatives had not heard from their client about 
the proposal. In the meantime, Phillips dealt a player he had acquired 
last Friday _ Joe Randa, from Detroit for Willie Blair _ to the Kansas 
City Royals. In return, the Mets received outfielder Juan LeBron, 
Kansas City's first-round pick (19th over all) in the 1995 draft. 
The 6-foot-4-inch LeBron, who projects as a right fielder, hit .251 
with 17 homers and 84 runs batted in and 18 stolen bases in low Class 
A ball last season. ``I'm pleased that we were able to replenish our 
system with this type of athlete,'' Phillips said. With LeBron, the 
highly touted Alex Escobar and Jason Tyner, last-season's first-round 
pick, the Mets now have three decent outfield prospects moving through 
their system. Phillips said Thursday that LeBron would probably play 
high Class A ball next season and that both Escobar and Tyner might 
start at Class AA. But none of the three will be ready to play in 
the majors for the next couple of years. Hence the interest in Henderson, 
who turns 40 on Christmas but who stole a major league-leading 66 
bases last season and would bat leadoff for the Mets next season. 
``I'm waiting for a response,'' Phillips said. ``I'm waiting for them 
to call me back. The offer's on the table. But I've assumed from the 
beginning that the Seattle Mariners have been in all along, too. ``With 
any player, you establish a value and make an offer. If it doesn't 
work out, then you go on to the next step. And we have a more than 
adequate alternative within our organization. I'm not dissatisfied 
at all with Jermaine Allensworth, Roger Cedeno and Jay Payton.'' While 
trade discussions were going on Thursday, and while the waiting game 
was being played by Mets officials, Valentine was at a team Christmas 
charity event at Shea Stadium. The manager was asked by the MSG Network 
about some comments Hundley had made about the poor nature of their 
relationship. The comments had been broadcast on the Fox show ``The 
Last Word'' the night before. Valentine was asked if he was sad that 
he and Hundley _ who had also made disparaging statements about his 
former manager in a recent Los Angeles Times article _ just couldn't 
hit it off. ``I'm confused about all this stuff about us not getting 
along,'' Valentine said. ``I really cared about him. Everything I 
did was to try to help him. If he misunderstood, that's a problem 
on his side.''
