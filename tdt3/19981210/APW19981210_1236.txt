After months of discussion, UEFA's executive committee Thursday unanimously 
approved the structure for a revamped Champions League and UEFA Cup 
to start next summer. ``The financial distribution has still to be 
fine tuned but the basic principles have been set,'' UEFA General-Secretary 
Gerhard Aigner told reporters. These would be finalized in the next 
two to three months, he said. The move _ which was drawn up to counter 
a breakaway Super League _ means the end of the Cup Winners Cup competition 
after the current season. ``We are very confident that next season 
... we will start with the new competition,'' said Guido Tognoni, 
head of national teams competitions. ``It was a very good day for 
European football.'' Europe's top soccer clubs had already endorsed 
plans for a new 32-team Champions' League and a new UEFA Cup to merge 
the existing UEFA Cup and Cup Winners Cup. But the starting date, 
setup and financial structure of the new competitions had to be approved 
by the executive committee. It is hoped the Champions League will 
generate some 800 million Swiss francs (dlrs 570 million), around 
three-quarters of the proceeds being distributed to clubs. Though 
falling far short of the Super League's promised jackpot, UEFA insists 
its prize money is guaranteed. The Super League project was launched 
earlier this year by Milan-based marketing company Media Partners, 
which promised increased revenue for top clubs through pay-per-view 
TV rights. As the plans gained momentum with secret meetings of the 
top clubs, UEFA, which has run European soccer since 1954, threatened 
to suspend clubs and players opting into the League. It also set up 
a task force, involving senior executives of European leagues and 
clubs as well as UEFA officials, to examine the future of European 
soccer competitions. Under the new format the Champions League will 
be expanded from 24 teams to 32, playing in eight groups of four in 
the first stage. Assured of places in the first stage are the league 
champions and runners-up from Italy, Germany, Spain, England, France 
and the Netherlands, as well as the title holder. The champions of 
Portugal, Greece and the Czech Republic are also guaranteed a berth. 
Other teams will have to go through at least one of three qualifying 
phases. The first- and second-placed teams from each groups advance 
to a second round with teams playing in four groups of four, followed 
by knockout quarterfinals. Teams that finish third in the first phase 
will get another chance in the UEFA Cup, entering the competition 
in its third round. The UEFA Cup will start with 96 teams, the same 
number as the two competitions it replaces. ``We are still working 
in the task force, but there is no crucial question on which we feel 
the clubs must give their opinion,'' Aigner said.
