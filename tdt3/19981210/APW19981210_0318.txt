Singapore's largest bank slashed its prime lending rate to 5.5 percent 
from 6 percent Thursday, a step likely to trigger another round of 
cuts by the city-state's biggest lenders. The government-linked Development 
Bank of Singapore has now cut the rate it charges its best customers 
five times in about three months, by a total of two percentage points. 
Singapore's other major local banks _ Overseas Union Bank, Oversea-Chinese 
Banking Corp. and United Overseas Bank _ are expected to follow DBS's 
move soon. The trend of falling interest rates has slowed the decline 
of prices in Singapore's property market, boosted optimism in the 
business community and fueled a stock market rally. The benchmark 
Straits Times Index jumped about 2 percent higher during the first 
few minutes of trading Thursday, ending the day up 1.1 percent at 
1439.88 points. The Singapore dollar was also stronger Thursday. In 
late afternoon trading, the U.S. dollar bought 1.6472 Singapore dollars, 
down from 1.6496 late Wednesday.
