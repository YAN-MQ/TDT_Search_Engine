Just a few years ago, Neil Pepe would probably have looked a little 
out of place circulating among the eggplant canapes under crystal 
chandeliers in the Terrace Room at Tavern on the Green. What, one 
might have asked, is the artistic director of a 172-seat, off-Broadway 
theater in Chelsea doing rubbing elbows with all those veteran Broadway 
producers at a presentation of awards? This year the answer was winning 
one. On Nov. 23, Pepe's Atlantic Theater Company was presented with 
the 15th annual Jujamcyn Theaters Award, a grant of $50,000. And Pepe, 
35, looked at ease, accepting congratulatory hugs from Bernard Gersten, 
the executive producer of Lincoln Center Theater, as he scribbled 
notes for his acceptance speech. Pepe's presence and the honor given 
the Atlantic, which brought ``The Beauty Queen of Leenane'' to New 
York last season, was a small but significant indication of the recognition 
that off-Broadway and off-off-Broadway nonprofit theaters are receiving. 
Typically, these theaters have toiled in obscurity and struggled to 
make ends meet. But critical success for recent productions like ``Wit,'' 
``This Is Our Youth'' and ``Killer Joe'' has lured more conventional 
theatergoers below Times Square, increasing ticket sales, building 
new audiences and attracting commercial Broadway producers to sniff 
around for possible imports. These winning streaks would seem like 
a windfall for small companies. But good times also raise questions 
for these theaters about how to handle their heady moments in the 
sun and whether having a commercial hit changes the artistic essence 
of what they do. ``You don't want to let success change your esthetic,'' 
Pepe said. ``You want to continue to do plays you believe in, that 
you feel are stories worth telling. You would never want to base that 
on what you feel would be commercially successful.'' Examples of small 
theater successes in the city are in abundant supply lately. MCC Theater, 
on West 28th Street, has a triumph on its hands with ``Wit,'' the 
play starring Kathleen Chalfant as a Donne scholar confronting cancer. 
It is moving to the Union Square Theater next Friday. The New Group 
has seen its production of ``This Is Our Youth,'' a play about rudderless 
Upper West Side rich kids, revived to rave reviews by the Second Stage 
Theater Company at the Promenade Theater. And Barry and Fran Weissler, 
the Broadway producers, plan to move it to the Minetta Lane in Greenwich 
Village in January. The 29th Street Rep's production of ``Killer Joe,'' 
the grisly drama it originated in 1994, is playing to sold-out crowds 
at the Soho Playhouse. The Adobe Theater Company is reveling in an 
open-ended run of ``Duet!: A Romantic Fable,'' a quirky comedy at 
the Actors' Playhouse in Greenwich Village. The McCarter Theater Center 
for the Performing Arts in Princeton, N.J., a regional theater, moved 
its celebrated production of ``Electra'' to Broadway last week, where 
it was welcomed with glowing reviews. And other off-off-Broadway companies 
have had similar successes over the last few years, including the 
Vineyard Theater, which produced ``How I Learned to Drive'' and ``Three 
Tall Women,'' both of which won Pulitzer Prizes; the Drama Department, 
which simultaneously produced ``As Bees in Honey Drown,'' ``June Moon'' 
and ``Uncle Tom's Cabin or Life Among the Lowly''; the Tectonic Theater 
Project, which produced ``Gross Indecency: The Three Trials of Oscar 
Wilde,'' which is now playing in Washington, and Target Margin, which 
produced ``Mamba's Daughters.'' On one level, success with critics 
and audiences is just plain sweet, executives at small companies say, 
giving them a much-needed shot in the arm. ``The success that feels 
really good is A, the attention and B, that you're not doing it for 
12 people for four nights,'' said Jeremy Dobrish, 30, the artistic 
director of Adobe. ``It feels great that people are finally noticing 
and paying attention and not just blowing us off or thinking, because 
we're Off-Broadway, we're bad.'' At MCC, the staff of five is working 
17-hour days trying to handle the volume of ticket sales for ``Wit'' 
and turning away 150 people a night. Suddenly, agents are returning 
their calls. And the theater's executive directors, Bernard Telsey 
and Robert LuPone, find themselves feeling more ambitious. ``We can 
ask that director to work here even though we may only pay $500; maybe 
we can do that musical,'' Telsey said. ``It has given us the confidence 
to reach higher.'' Financially, the attention often means a company 
can afford a few rare luxuries, like a new computer, and make it somewhat 
easier to seek contributions from donors, board members and foundations. 
An infusion of money can also underwrite a theater's shakier artistic 
efforts, as the long-running ``Chorus Line'' did for the Public Theater. 
But such hits are not the transforming elixir many assume them to 
be, company executives say. It doesn't mean they can suddenly hire 
a full-time staff or stop applying for grants or no longer worry about 
their survival. Unless the productions run considerably longer than 
originally planned or are moved to commercial runs that the companies 
retain a piece of, critical acclaim and a growing audience does not 
necessarily amount to financial gain. Making it work off-off-Broadway 
remains a constant battle. Considerably smaller than off-Broadway 
nonprofit theaters like the Manhattan Theater Club or Playwrights 
Horizons, some of these small companies consist of a group of actors, 
directors and writers, most of whom also help build sets, clean bathrooms 
and lick envelopes. Some companies consist of only an artistic director 
who handles the creative side and a managing director who handles 
the business side, both of whom may support themselves doing other 
things. In some cases, these companies own theaters; many have to 
constantly search for spaces to house their productions. Most do three 
or four plays a year with runs of a few weeks. Tickets are usually 
under $20. The Alliance for Resident Theaters/N.Y., a service group 
for the city's nonprofit theaters, is planning a workshop called ``Managing 
Success'' about how to get the most buck for your bang. ``Most of 
these companies are still in the mom-and-pop stage,'' said Virginia 
Louloudes, the alliance's executive director. ``Sometimes they still 
have day jobs, so they don't have the time to focus on institutional 
growth.'' With a hit, Ms. Louloudes said, a small company has ``tremendous 
opportunities, but they don't have the wherewithal to see beyond filling 
the house.'' The aura of success can also be misleading, theater executives 
say, creating the false impression that companies are far better off 
financially than they are. Claudia Catania, executive director of 
the seven-year-old New Group, which pays its actors $300 a week, encountered 
this problem after the success of its play ``Ecstasy'' in 1995. ``The 
perception was we were more stable than we actually were,'' Ms. Catania 
said. ``To get up `This Is Our Youth,' we had to beg, steal and borrow.'' 
This misinterpretation can affect day-to-day business, causing suppliers 
and agents who would typically offer small theaters a break to tighten 
up. ``People assume you must be swimming in dollars,'' Dobrish of 
Adobe said. ``If they think you had this big hit, they think you can 
afford to pay full price.'' Adobe, founded in 1991 by Dobrish and 
five friends from Wesleyan University, has an annual budget of about 
$100,000 for all its costs, including actors' salaries, sets, promotional 
brochures and lighting equipment. The company cannot afford any full-time 
administrative staff; Dobrish volunteers his services and lives on 
savings and income from occasional directing and writing jobs. Although 
MCC has been packing them in for ``Wit'' at its 99-seat theater in 
a former elementary school cafeteria, the company, which was founded 
in 1985, has yet to make any money on the production. LuPone and Telsey, 
the executive directors, work free; Telsey makes his living as a casting 
director, LuPone as an actor. And while financially welcome, a commercial 
transfer can also be disruptive for small companies, distracting from 
their long-term efforts to develop new work and to focus on pushing 
the envelope rather than pleasing large audiences. ``Once money starts 
to enter into the equation, the atmosphere changes,'' Ms. Catania 
said. ``What's important is that your decisions aren't informed by 
commercial concerns.'' The people who run these companies insist that, 
while they enjoy the fame, the work ultimately remains about the work, 
not about trying to duplicate their good fortune. Moreover, company 
directors say, it is impossible to predict which shows will take off 
and which will not, and trying to do so is a futile exercise. ``It's 
important not to let that commercial transfer be the thing you aspire 
to or require,'' said Douglas Aibel, artistic director of the Vineyard 
Theater on East 15th Street. ``The minute you try to second-guess 
what's going to be commercial, you're going to be wrong.'' Relations 
between commercial producers and their alternative counterparts have 
historically been dominated by a mutual suspicion: big, bad Broadway 
versus the little, dark nonprofits. Though some of this perception 
persists, executives at small companies say their success has fostered 
the beginnings of teamwork between the two worlds. Increasingly, there 
is a recognition that they can help each other, as Broadway looks 
downtown for promising new work and nonprofits look uptown for financial 
support in extending their plays for longer runs at larger theaters. 
Dodger Endemol Productions, the Broadway company whose current ventures 
include ``Titanic'' and ``Footloose,'' backed Adobe's ``Duet!'' when 
it was remounted this fall, having originated at the Ohio Theater 
in Soho last season. As a result, Dobrish said, he and his colleagues 
were now invited to Dodger meetings, to benefit from the producers' 
marketing expertise and to move forward with the possibility of collaborating 
again in the future. ``They said, `We love what you do; just keep 
doing it; we'll support you,''' Dobrish said. ``I can't tell you how 
meaningful that is.'' In general, however, artistic directors say 
Broadway remains risk-averse, with producers wary of picking up plays 
that will be difficult to market to a mass audience. For example, 
although the Atlantic eventually teamed up with several commercial 
producers to move ``Beauty Queen'' to Broadway _ having first produced 
this Druid Theater Company drama at its theater on 20th Street _ the 
play was initially a tough sell. Pepe said he approached several producers, 
all of whom said it was ``too dark.'' Ultimately, the play won four 
Tony Awards, brought the Atlantic to the attention of Robert De Niro's 
Tribeca Films _ which signed a development deal with the company _ 
and created the Atlantic's relationship with Jujamcyn, which owns 
the Walter Kerr Theater, where ``Beauty Queen'' is playing. ``Wit,'' 
however, was rejected by Broadway producers and wound up moving to 
a larger off-Broadway house despite universally impressive reviews 
that made it seem a sure bet for Broadway. ``Why are we stopping so 
soon after `Beauty Queen'?'' asked LuPone of MCC. ``Why are we giving 
up already?'' Although critics and audiences have agreed that ``Wit'' 
transcends its grim subject matter, Broadway was apparently not prepared 
to test it on a larger scale. Martin Markinson, the owner of the Helen 
Hayes Theater, turned it down in favor of ``Band in Berlin,'' a new 
musical. ``When you move a show up to Broadway, you're not only relying 
on the people of the city and the surrounding communities, but you're 
relying a great deal on tourists,'' Markinson said. ``And although 
I thought `Wit' was a wonderful show and a very well-written good 
piece, the subject matter in my view is not something that is going 
to have legs. A great many people would have an aversion to a play 
about death and dying.'' As affirming as it may be to move a show 
to a commercial run, off-off-Broadway executives say such transfers 
can occasion a feeling of loss as well as gain, the sense of giving 
up something that was once distinctly their own. The 29th Street Rep, 
founded in 1988, is credited in the program of ``Killer Joe,'' for 
example, and gets a percentage of the profits, but no one in the eight-member 
company is part of the current production at the Soho Playhouse. David 
Mogentale, the Rep's co-artistic director, brought the play to New 
York from Chicago and produced it first at the company's 60-seat theater 
on 29th Street, where he played Killer Joe. But he said he was not 
consulted for the current production, which is led by two well-known 
actors, Amanda Plummer and Scott Glenn. ``The hard thing for me is, 
this play would never have gotten done in New York if it weren't for 
me,'' said Mogentale, 38. ``I don't want to say I'm bitter, but it's 
disappointing.'' Mogentale, who supports himself by working as a waiter 
at Barney Greengrass, the bagels and sturgeon restaurant on the Upper 
West Side, said his company's production was bleaker and more daring 
than the current show. ``We had blood packs flying everywhere,'' he 
said. ``It was like, you're locked in a room and you can't get out.'' 
Given that the work of mounting these plays with so few resources 
remains so arduous, some wonder how much longer off-off-Broadway's 
fragile institutions will be able to weather the inevitable cycles 
of feast and famine, being anointed and being ignored. ``I think a 
lot about who's going to come after us, who's the model after us,'' 
Dobrish said. ``It's so hard to raise the money and you need a tenacity 
that's unreasonable to expect to keep going and not say, `I'm tired 
of cleaning the toilets, tired of not getting paid, tired of putting 
on plays and not having people come.' '' In a way, LuPone of MCC said, 
companies buoyed by critical praise and its accompanying perks have 
to force themselves to almost pretend it isn't happening because, 
soon enough, it won't be happening anymore. ``Theater in this town 
is sort of a divine madness,'' LuPone said. ``And right now, we're 
in the divine. But you always have to remember that right around the 
corner is the madness.'' SMALL PRODUCTIONS, NOT SMALL SUCCESSES Here
