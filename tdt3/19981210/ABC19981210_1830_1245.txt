Sometimes you have to feel sorry for the U.S. postal service. After 
all the complaining that people do. Once again the post office has 
had to offer a pretty big reward, $10,000. This time for information 
about people stealing the mail. The mail boxes in some cases. The 
problem is particularly vexing in Seattle. Here is ABC's Judy Muller. 
When you drop a letter in a mailbox, you expect it to reach its destination. 
In Seattle, they know better. I mailed a check to my girlfriend, a 
check for $200, and I called her later and she didn't get it. It had 
been two months and now we don't know where the money is. But it was 
cashed? It was cashed. She isn't alone. Hundreds of Seattle-area residents 
have lost thousands of dollars to thieves who stole the master key 
that opens 1,500 blue mailboxes. One witness to the crime calls the 
thieves brazen. They have no fear at all. They just stuff their shirts 
full and their knapsacks, and they just go off on their bike or just 
walking. At first, the postal service responded by issuing a warning 
and putting padlocks on the boxes. Hopefully this will slow things 
down a bit anyway. But it didn't. The thieves simply took the entire 
mailbox. So the postal service ordered hundreds of new boxes with 
high-tech locks and bolts that could only be turned by a special wrench. 
I believe we have a very good system that's gonna protect our mail. 
Wrong again. This week, four of the new boxes were torn from their 
concrete pads by chains attached to cars. Even so, the postal service 
tried to put a positive spin on it. They weren't unscrewed. They were 
ripped off, causing noise, confusion and taking time. He hopes those 
factors will lead to arrests. Several suspects are in custody. But 
many residents aren't taking any chances, especially when it comes 
to paying bills. I take my bills to the post office. I take them inside 
now. Many Seattle residents are angry that the postal service did 
not issue a warning until months after the master key was stolen. 
And the crime is catching on. There are reports of similar thefts 
in cities from Phoenix to Chicago. Judy Muller, ABC News, Seattle.
