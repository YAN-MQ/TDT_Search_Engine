The United States is sending a number of patriot missiles to Israel 
for what it calls a military exercise. The exercise will coincide 
with President Clinton's trip to Israel and the Palestinian territories. 
He's due to arrive in Tel Aviv on Saturday night. It was on the Israeli 
cities hit by Iraqi missile attacks during the Gulf War in 1991.
