Undersecretary of State Stewart Eisenstadt says Congress will be asked 
to write off money owed the United States by Nicaragua and Honduras. 
The move follows the devastation caused there by Hurricane Mitch. 
Earlier, the Paris Club of Predator Nations suspended the two countries' 
debt payments for three years. But Tony Burden of the British charity, 
Oxfam says the debt suspension is simply not enough. It's a welcome 
breathing space for these countries, but after that three-year breathing 
space, we'll then reenter the existing debt relief framework. What's 
happened is that the hurricane has destroyed their economies. So what 
they really need is a lot of support to recover. Oxfam's Tony Burden.
