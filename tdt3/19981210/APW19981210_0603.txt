One day after his team reached the quarterfinals of the Champions 
League, Bayern Munich coach Ottmar Hitzfeld said Thursday he needs 
new players to be able to rule Europe for several years. ``We have 
to strengthen ourselves for the next season to be able to keep the 
standard, meet the lofty goals expected of us and stay among the top 
teams in Europe,'' Hitzfeld said. ``I want to win the Champions League 
at some point with Bayern and I want to have one of the best teams 
in Europe _ and not for one season, but for several years in a row,'' 
Hitzfeld said. Hitzfeld won the Champions League with Borussia Dortmund 
in 1987 and was hired by Bayern at the start of the season to do the 
same for the Bavarian club. The club's roster now has 20 internationals 
from five nations and Hitzfeld has instituted a rotation system to 
give most of the stars a fairly equal opportunity to play. Bayern 
qualified for the quarterfinals by playing to a 1-1 draw at Manchester 
United and won its group ahead of United and Barcelona. ``We lagged 
behind for many years but now we are where we belong _ among the best 
in Europe,'' said manager Uli Hoeness. ``It was very important for 
our reputation.'' Bayern has been seeking to recapture the most prestigious 
club trophy in Europe ever since the generation of Franz Beckenbauer 
and Gerd Mueller won the last of its three consecutive crowns in 1976. 
It has not reached the final since losing to Porto in 1987. After 
losing its opening game to underdog Brondby, Bayern never lost again 
in the next five games to win its group. ``After the bad start I did 
not believe that we would make it,'' said Beckenbauer, who is now 
the chairman of Bayern. ``But the players showed character and we 
can be proud,'' he said. Hitzfeld said Bayern had a good chance of 
reaching the semifinals. ``If you leave Manchester and Barcelona behind 
you and you don't lose against them, that shows the strength of Bayern 
Munich,'' the coach said. ``We don't have to fear any team in Europe.'' 
Except perhaps Kaiserslautern, the second German quarterfinalist. 
``Kaiserslautern would be a real punishment,'' said defender Markus 
Babbel. Manager Hoeness admitted that he always fears Kaiserslautern, 
which stole the Bundesliga title from Bayern last season. Bayern lost 
against another German team (Borussia Dortmund) at the same stage 
last season. Beckenbauer said Bayern fans would prefer to see a foreign 
team than watch another Bundesliga rival. Kaiserslautern coach Otto 
Rehhagel, who had a brief stint at Bayern, also said he would like 
to avoid the fellow Germans in the next round. ``There are only top 
teams left, but it doesn't have to be Bayern,'' he said. Bayern's 
next challenge comes Sunday, when it tries to regain the Bundesliga 
lead from Bayer Leverkusen in a direct showdown.
