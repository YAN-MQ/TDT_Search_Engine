A big linkup in health care could affect your HMO coverage. I'm Jan 
Hopkins in New York with this edition of "Dollars & Sense." Aetna 
is buying Prudential insurance company's health care business. It's 
a billion-dollar deal. It will make Aetna the country's largest provider 
of health benefits with more than 22 million members. The deal would 
also double Aetna's dental membership to more than 15 million members. 
Aetna says the acquisition could result in savings of up to $150 million 
a Year. Some jobs are expected to be affected, though. No word on 
how many.
