The 20-year-old man convicted of killing his former teacher, Jonathan 
Levin, was sentenced Thursday to the maximum term of 25 years to life 
in prison by a judge who denounced him as a ``sadistic and manipulative'' 
criminal. The convicted killer, Corey Arthur, maintained the seemingly 
remorseless posture that he had throughout the trial as he was sentenced 
for second-degree murder by Judge Marcy Kahn of state Supreme Court 
in Manhattan. Judge Kahn told Arthur that the torture and killing 
of Levin in his Upper West Side apartment on May 30, 1997 was a ``barbaric'' 
act that showed a ``level of depravity few people could comprehend.'' 
``You planned and carried out the betrayal of someone who selflessly 
gave you his friendship,'' Judge Kahn said. ``You were the one who 
chose Jonathan Levin as your victim. You were the one who used your 
relationship with him to get into his apartment.'' After being told 
his family could not speak for him, Arthur declined to make a statement 
before being sentenced, and he showed no emotion as Judge Kahn vilified 
him. When Levin's mother, Carol, made a statement to the court, Arthur 
scribbled on a notepad with a blank look on his face. ``He was the 
only one who knew Jon, who knew his mentor, his teacher, his friend, 
would not be able to turn his back on anyone who asked him for his 
help _ certainly not one of his students,'' Mrs. Levin said as another 
of her sons, Lee, and a daughter, Laura, stood by her side. ``How 
could anyone but a dangerous, brutal and evil person deliberately 
destroy the life of a person who reached out to him, who believed 
in him?'' Prosecutors said Arthur and an accomplice went to visit 
Levin, the son of Gerald Levin, the chairman of Time Warner, and used 
a knife to inflict torture, including three cuts across his throat, 
until he gave up the code to his bank card. Levin, an English teacher 
at William Howard Taft High School in the Bronx, was then shot, but 
the jury was apparently not convinced that Arthur pulled the trigger, 
and declined to convict him of first-degree murder, which could have 
brought him a prison sentence of life without parole. The man suspected 
of being an accomplice, Montoun Hart, is to be tried on second-degree 
murder charges next month. Judge Kahn revealed Thursday that while 
Arthur was on trial, he committed disciplinary infractions in jail, 
violated a court order and defaced courtroom property. She said he 
had shown no remorse for his crime, was not a good candidate for rehabilitation 
and was anti-social and narcissistic. While recognizing that Arthur 
grew up in a dysfunctional family racked by drug abuse and attempted 
suicide, Judge Kahn said there was no excuse for his actions. ``As 
your former friend and mentor pleaded for his life, you did nothing 
for him,'' she said. A prosecutor, Eugene Hurley, called the killing 
the worst he had seen in 20 years on the job. ``They were acts of 
barbarity motivated by greed and self-interest,'' he said. But Arthur's 
lawyer, Anthony Ricco, portrayed his client as the product of an impoverished, 
troubled world, calling him a ``legacy of a tragedy that started a 
long time ago.'' In an interview with the CBS news program ``60 Minutes'' 
broadcast last Sunday, Arthur said he deeply regretted Levin's death. 
He admitted being in his former teacher's apartment on the day of 
the murder, but insisted he had not gone there to rob or kill Levin. 
Arthur has blamed others for carrying out the murder, but he has not 
named them. But prosecutors say Arthur killed his teacher after the 
robbery because he was the only one Levin could have later identified 
to the police. After the sentencing, Levin's mother praised the judge's 
ruling, but she said her family would never recover. ``We will never 
be healed,'' she said. ``We will never be whole.''
