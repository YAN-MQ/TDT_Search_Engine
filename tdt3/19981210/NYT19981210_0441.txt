The New York Times said in an editorial for Friday, Dec. 11: For the 
first time in some days, the main action in the impeachment crisis 
seemed to be taking place outside the House Judiciary Committee. Given 
Rep. Henry Hyde's determination to pass an impeachment resolution 
on a party-line vote, this is a positive development. Public opinion, 
constitutional wisdom and the national interest all demand agreement 
between Congress and President Clinton on a censure that would sternly 
condemn the president, but leave him in office. The behind-the-scenes 
bargaining seems to be moving at the pace of a bug swimming across 
a saucer of molasses. But at least there is movement, because the 
White House is scared now. Whatever they say in public, no smart lawyer 
would advise Clinton to go on trial in the Senate on the initial count 
of grand-jury perjury. So Thursday the White House announced that 
Clinton would, in effect, welcome a censure deal. It is directly lobbying 
moderate House Republicans and using intermediaries to contact other 
influential Republicans. The time has come, in fact, for party figures 
like former Sen. Bob Dole to follow the example of Sen. Alfonse D'Amato 
in urging a negotiated settlement. Still, censure advocates should 
avoid any deal that lets the White House get away with the semantic 
game insisted upon by Clinton's lawyers. They want to substitute the 
word ``misled'' for ``lied.'' Average citizens who receive merciful 
treatment at the bar of justice do not get to dress up their failures 
with fancy language, and neither should Clinton. The president knowingly 
lied under oath, and that needs to be written into the history of 
his administration. Thursday the Judiciary Committee heard two presentations 
of widely divergent quality. The committee's Republican counsel, David 
Schippers, used almost three hours for a needlessly sarcastic reading 
of the public record. The Democratic counsel, Abbe Lowell, made a 
detailed and impressive argument that the House should not cast a 
``rubber stamp'' vote to impeach in the belief that the Senate would 
acquit the president. That would sacrifice a ``double protection that 
the Founders intended'' to write into the Constitution. Taken together, 
these events suggest a penetration of the veil of unreality that has 
surrounded the impeachment proceedings. If Clinton and opinion leaders 
in both parties shake off their lethargy, the likely passage of an 
impeachment resolution by the Judiciary Committee on Saturday need 
not determine the outcome in the full House. When he returns from 
Israel next week Clinton may have the opportunity to seal a censure 
bargain with an honest and full confession to the American people. 
But Democrats and moderate Republicans should not let this serial 
evader use a squishy word for his lies. For while the Constitution 
requires prolonging Clinton in office, Congress does not have to hedge 
its demands for contrition that is full, candid and, at long last, 
not misleading.
