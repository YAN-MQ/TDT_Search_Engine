In an ongoing purge of Serbia's independent media, a Belgrade court 
fined an independent daily and its chief editor the equivalent of 
dlrs 45,000 Thursday for allegedly libeling a top official. This was 
the second hefty fine slapped against Dnevni Telegraf (Daily Telegraph) 
since October when a restrictive media law, which effectively banned 
criticism of state officials and their policies, was adopted in Serbia. 
On Nov. 9, the popular daily was fined the equivalent of dlrs 120,000. 
Later, its property was impounded and it had to move to Montenegro, 
the small republic which with Serbia forms Yugoslavia, to resume publishing. 
Early Thursday, the court acted on charges filed by Milovan Bojic, 
the deputy Serbian prime minister and a leading neo-communist official, 
who said the Dnevni Telegraf newspaper libeled his image in its Dec. 
5 edition. During brief court proceedings, Dnevni Telegraf's lawyers 
unsuccessfully tried to argue that Serbian laws cannot be implemented 
for newspapers that are published in Montenegro. Its chief editor 
Dragan Novakovic said he won't pay the fine and that authorities won't 
be able to impound his property as they did after the last trial. 
Several independent media outlets have been fined, and many had to 
close down, as the result of the media law, which has been bitterly 
criticized by Western powers.
