India's army killed nine Muslim militants close to its disputed border 
with Pakistan in two gunbattles that were part of its new ``winter 
offensive,'' a spokesman said Thursday. Five militants said to belong 
to the Hizb-ul-Mujahideen guerrilla outfit were killed Thursday in 
the Rajouri region in the northern Jammu-Kashmir state, 200 kilometers 
(124 miles) north of the state's winter capital Jammu, the spokesman 
said. He spoke on customary condition of anonymity. Four militants 
were killed in another gunbattle in the same area on Wednesday night, 
the spokesman said. Army columns have fanned out in the thickly forested 
mountainous area in the winter offensive, an attempt to stop alleged 
intrusion of militants from Pakistan into India which India says is 
stepped up in the winters. India accuses Islamabad of arming and funding 
the nine-year-old rebellion by nearly a dozen guerrilla groups for 
independence or a merger with Pakistan. The frontier region of Kashmir 
is divided between the two nations. India controls two-thirds of its 
territory, and Pakistan the rest. Both claim the whole territory, 
over which they have fought two wars in the last 50 years.
