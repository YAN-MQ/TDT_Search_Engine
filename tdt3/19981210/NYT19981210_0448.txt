In a move that could reassert the power of floor traders fearful their 
positions could be eroded by the 24-hour electronic age, members of 
the Chicago Board of Trade voted Wednesday to unseat their chairman. 
After six years in office, Patrick Arbor, who portrayed himself as 
a champion of technology and change in a world dominated by hand signals 
and shouting, narrowly lost his bid to lead the largest financial 
futures and options exchange for an unprecedented fourth term. The 
new chairman, David Brennan, is a 41-year-old soybean trader who was 
popular with floor traders and who had managed to win the backing 
of seven former Board of Trade chairmen in the weeks leading up to 
the election. Brennan won an 608-589 vote. The late-night count concluded 
early Thursday. Arbor, a tough-talking commodities trader, had dubbed 
his opponent a ``member of the flat earth society.'' Thursday, however, 
he conceded that some of the more than 1,400 voting members of the 
exchange had soured on his aggressive leadership, his push to align 
with Eurex, an all-electronic German-Swiss derivatives exchange, and 
his ill-fated effort to forge a common clearing operation with the 
board's crosstown rival, the Chicago Mercantile Exchange. ``The push 
for technology, I think, was maybe too much for the membership to 
digest right now,'' Arbor, 62, said in an interview. ``This means 
that the old guard is back; they thought we were going too far.'' 
Others, however, said the exchange was probably due for a change. 
Some members had criticized Arbor for investing so heavily in technology, 
and eroding membership power through alliances. But others say the 
close vote demonstrated a membership split over which course to pursue. 
``You can't draw any major conclusions from so close a vote,'' said 
Leo Melamed, the former chairman of the Chicago Mercantile Exchange. 
``There's not a major message here.'' And while Arbor was credited 
for building a new $182 million trading floor and enlarging the board's 
profile and profitability, Melamed and others said that Arbor's portrayal 
of Brennan as ``inexperienced,'' ``immature'' and opposed to change 
was unfair. ``David Brennan's a smart man and he's not going to put 
his head in the sand,'' said Melamed, who has worked with Arbor and 
Brennan. ``But there will certainly be a fresh look at things.'' Brennan 
declined to be interviewed Thursday, but Burt Gutterman, chief executive 
at Sangamon Trading and a veteran board member, said this of the new 
chairman: ``There's no Luddite consequences here, despite the spin. 
David is very knowledgeable about technology.'' For the last few years, 
the Board of Trade _ like most of the nation's financial exchanges 
_ has been grappling with how to compete in a world that is rapidly 
moving toward electronic trading, global financial networks and low-cost 
trading. Earlier this year, Cantor Fitzgerald moved to trade futures 
electronically, and in Europe electronic trading of derivatives is 
growing. If electronic trading comes, though, it could displace the 
thousands of ``locals,'' the traders who now populate the raucous 
pits here. While Arbor supported the open outcry system, his electronic 
course was viewed as less supportive of floor traders. Brennan, however, 
is now in the hot seat, and some industry officials are already trying 
to gauge his direction. ``I think he will slow down the evolution 
of our exchange and change some of the tracks,'' said Leslie Rosenthal, 
a former chairman of the exchange. ``He's a conservative; he's part 
of the floor. I think he will be more protective of the open outcry 
trading pit.''
