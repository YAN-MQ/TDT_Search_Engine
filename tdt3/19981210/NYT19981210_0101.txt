Hazel Bishop, who cooked up the first kissproof lipstick (``stays 
on you ... not on him'') in a kitchen fitted out as a laboratory, 
then lost the right to use the name she made famous, died on Saturday 
at the Osborn Home in Rye, N.Y. She was 92. She exploited the skills 
of a research chemist, a merchant and a teacher to achieve eminence 
in three careers over the course of 50 years. It was soon after World 
War II that Miss Bishop, a trained chemist who had worked in a dermatologist's 
laboratory, developed a nondrying, nonirritating, long-wearing lipstick. 
(Long-lasting types contain high amounts of colorants called bromo 
acids that have staining qualities.) In 1950, she formed Hazel Bishop 
Inc. to manufacture and market her discovery. ``Never again need you 
be embarrassed by smearing friends, children, relatives, husband, 
sweetheart,'' the early advertising said, pointing out that older 
formulations tended to leave greasy marks on glasses, cigarettes and 
teeth. And the new brand did not have to be applied several times 
a day. The brand found instant acceptance. When it was introduced 
that summer at $1 a tube, Lord &AMP; Taylor sold out its stock on 
the first day. The brand soon captured 25 percent of the fast-growing 
lipstick market and locked horns with Charles Revson of Revlon in 
``the lipstick war.'' But Miss Bishop was engaged in a war of her 
own with her majority stockholder over financial issues. In settling 
her lawsuit, she left the company in 1954, when its sales exceeded 
$10 million a year. She set up Hazel Bishop Laboratories to develop 
household and personal care products, but ran into legal problems 
with her former partner, losing the right to sell products under her 
own name or to use it in personal appearances. In 1962, she became 
a stockbroker for Bache &AMP; Co. and later a financial analyst for 
Evans &AMP; Co. With the burgeoning of the fragrance business in the 
1960s and '70s, cosmetics companies became hot stocks and her advice 
was ardently sought. She was quoted in newspaper financial pages and 
lectured throughout the United States. Her third career was in fashion 
education. In 1978, she became an adjunct professor at the Fashion 
Institute of Technology in Manhattan in a program preparing young 
people for careers in cosmetics. In 1980, on the occasion of her appointment 
to the Revlon Chair in Cosmetics Marketing at FIT, Michel Bergerac, 
chairman of Revlon, said: ``It is really quite an achievement to carve 
one outstanding career in a lifetime. To succeed in business, in finance, 
and in academics in only part of a life is truly an amazing thing.'' 
Hazel Bishop was born in Hoboken, N.J.. on Aug. 17, 1906, one of two 
children of Henry and Mabel Bishop. Her father ran a dozen successful 
enterprises, including numerous stores on Washington Street, the main 
concourse of Hoboken. One Thanksgiving, he brought Santa Claus to 
town on an elephant to advertise his candy emporium. ``The family 
talk around the dinner table always concerned business,'' Miss Bishop 
said. After graduating from Barnard College, Miss Bishop intended 
to go to medical school, but the stock market crash forced her to 
take a job as a chemist at Columbia University Medical Center, where 
she worked for a leading dermatologist, investigating allergies and 
cosmetics. In World War II, as senior organic chemist with what is 
now Exxon, she discovered the cause of deposits affecting superchargers 
of aircraft engines. After the war, she moved on to what is now Mobil, 
but in the meantime made her historic discovery. She is survived by 
a niece, Randa Bishop of Las Vegas, Nev., and two nephews, Arthur 
Lipper of Delmar, Calif., and A. Michael Lipper of Summit, N.J. Described 
over the years as demure and trim, with hazel eyes and a weakness 
for hats, the woman who invented kissable lipstick never married. 
She said she felt the obligation, in her courting years, to keep her 
widowed mother company at home. After she left the business, she still 
mixed up lipstick for herself, a red shade with a blue cast, and once 
offered the following beauty advice: ``Women should use makeup to 
accentuate their most attractive feature. After the age of 25 or thereabouts, 
personality becomes an increasingly more attractive feature.''
