A logging activist is marking her one-year anniversary today in the 
company of a tree. Julia hill climbed a 180-foot California Redwood 
tree a year ago to protest a land deal. Under the deal, California 
will purchase 10,000 acres of forest from a Logging company. But hill 
wants the entire 66,000-acre headwaters forest to be preserved. The 
24-year-old has been living on a platform the size of a queen-size 
bed, using a bucket for a toilet, and relying on fellow activists 
for food.
