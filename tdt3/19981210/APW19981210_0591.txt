A Bosnian Croat paramilitary commander was convicted Thursday of war 
crimes for failing to prevent a subordinate from raping a Muslim woman 
in 1993. Anto Furundzija, 29, was found guilty of two U.N. war crimes 
counts for failing to stop the rape and then taking no action against 
the rapist. The Yugoslav war crimes tribunal sentenced him to 10 years 
in prison. He had faced a maximum life sentence. Furundzija, wearing 
a dark suit, shirt and tie, looked unmoved as the verdicts were read 
out. After hearing his sentence, he sat down again and glanced at 
his attorney. By failing to stop the rape, Furundzija became a ``direct 
perpetrator committing the crimes of torture and outrages upon personal 
dignity,'' prosecutors said at his trial. His case was the tribunal's 
first to deal exclusively with rape as a war crime. Last month, a 
Bosnian Muslim was convicted by the U.N. court of raping a Serb woman, 
but the charge was just one in a long list of atrocities. Prosecutors 
based their case against Furundzija almost exclusively on closed-door 
testimony of the alleged victim, identified by the tribunal only as 
``Witness A.'' But their case was undermined by defense claims that 
prosecutors tried to conceal the fact that the victim was suffering 
psychological problems and that her testimony could be unreliable. 
Judges took the unprecedented step of reopening the trial in November 
to let her be questioned again and to hear evidence from experts who 
examined her. At the reopened proceedings, a doctor told the court 
that the victim needed psychiatric treatment after her ordeal and 
was suicidal. Furundzija was the commander of a unit known as ``The 
Jokers,'' which joined Bosnian Croat forces in attacking Muslim villages 
in central Bosnia in 1993, prosecutors claim. The rape victim was 
taken to unit's headquarters in Vitez and interrogated by Furundzija 
and another soldier. She was later raped by an unidentified soldier 
in the presence of Furundzija, who ``did nothing to stop or curtail 
that action,'' the tribunal contends. The woman was subjected to ``a 
prolonged series of physical, mental and serious sexual abuses including 
repeated rapes,'' prosecutors claimed. Furundzija becomes the first 
Bosnian Croat convicted of participating in a brutal purge of Muslims 
in the central Bosnian Lasva Valley. Eight other Bosnian Croats are 
on trial in three separate cases for their alleged involvement in 
the purge. Set up by the U.N. Security Council in 1993, the tribunal 
has previously convicted one Bosnian Serb, two Muslims and two Bosnian 
Croats for war crimes. Earlier Thursday, four Bosnian Serbs pleaded 
innocent to broadened charges that they murdered, tortured and raped 
Muslim prisoners in 1992. Miroslav Kvocka, Milojica Kos, Mladjo Radic 
and Zoran Zigic all are accused by the tribunal of atrocities at the 
infamous Omarska camp in northwest Bosnia.
