The centers for disease control and prevention is issuing some controversial 
guidelines concerning the virus that causes AIDS. It is recommending 
that states report all cases of HIV infection, either by the patient's 
name or an anonymous identifying code. Most states document all people 
with AIDS, but not those who are just HIV positive. State health officials 
are expected to go along with the recommendations, to ensure federal 
funding. Medical experts say the information is needed to get a better 
handle on the virus.
