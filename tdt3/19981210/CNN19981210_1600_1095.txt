Alaska air has a new marketing partner. It is dropping northwest airlines. 
It has announced plans to team up with American airlines instead by 
the end of next year. The new agreement with American will expand 
travel and mileage earning opportunities for passengers on Alaska 
airlines and its horizon air unit.
