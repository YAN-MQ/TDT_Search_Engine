Civil war in Sudan has caused the deaths of more than 1.9 million 
people since 1983, a humanitarian agency said Thursday. The Washington 
D.C.-based U.S. Committee For Refugees said the 15-year war over control 
of the southern and central part of the largest nation in Africa has 
killed one of five southern Sudanese, either by warfare, war-induced 
famine or direct government or rebel policies. In the first six months 
of 1998, more than 70,000 people died, a report issued by the agency 
said. About 80 percent of southern Sudan's estimated five million 
people have been displaced at one time or another since 1983 by fighting 
between rebels from the animist and Christian south and forces loyal 
to the government of the Arab and Islamic north for control over southern 
Sudan, it said. ``Sudan's civil war has been characterized by an incremental 
ferocity that has left untouched practically no one ... in southern 
Sudan,'' the report said. It said about 4 million people are internally 
displaced by the war and another 350,000 are living as refugees in 
neighboring countries. The report was compiled by consultant Millard 
Burr, a former director of logistics for the U.S. Agency for International 
Development in Sudan. Jeff Drumtra, a senior policy analyst with the 
humanitarian agency said by telephone from Washington that Burr gathered 
the data from dozens of documents and internal reports by many of 
the 40 aid agencies operating in Sudan. ``In his studies, he goes 
systematically through the main conflict areas in Sudan and cites 
battles, attacks, atrocities on almost a monthly basis year after 
year,'' Drumtra said. ``No one pretends that this is precise; it's 
a working document,'' he said. ``Whether the death toll is 1.9 million 
or 1.8 or 2 million, no one will ever know. This is a fairly conservative 
estimate to put the scale of this on the table.'' Referring to the 
deaths as the result of genocide, the report said that while both 
the government and the rebels have committed atrocities against the 
southern Sudanese population, the scale of government-induced killings 
far surpassed those carried out by any other perpetrator. The report 
said the government has systematically blocked food assistance to 
southern Sudanese populations, has attacked villages and has driven 
large population groups to areas where they could not survive. ``These 
are not people killed in crossfire,'' said Drumtra. ``It's a very 
deliberate strategy on the part of the government of Sudan to depopulate 
large parts of southern Sudan.'' He said that while the report cites 
the government as the key killer in Sudan's war, even those who don't 
agree should recognize the horror of its scope. ``What is going on 
in Sudan, and what has been going for the past 15 years is virtually 
unprecedented in terms of the devastation to human lives, property 
and society in the south,'' he said. ``Even by the standards of Africa, 
even by the standards of war ... this loss of life and destruction 
of economy and society is far beyond the line.''
