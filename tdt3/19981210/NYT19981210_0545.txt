Like a great chunk of white chocolate on Columbus Circle, the Gallery 
of Modern Art was too rich for sophisticated tastes when it opened 
in 1964. But as the Giuliani administration ponders its fate, more 
than a few New Yorkers are admitting that it has become a guilty pleasure 
they would hate to give up. After all, lounge music and leopard-skin 
prints are back, so it figures that there is renewed appreciation 
of a trapezium-shaped marble structure poised on curvy Y-shaped columns, 
bordered by filigree-like portholes and topped by an arcaded restaurant 
in which Polynesian luau lunches were once served. The city-owned 
building at 2 Columbus Circle has been empty since April, when its 
last tenant, the Department of Cultural Affairs, moved out. Bidders 
for the site include Donald Trump, who would construct a 12-story 
hotel there, and the Dahesh Museum, which would restore the existing 
building. The Alexander and Louisa Calder Foundation would reuse the 
galleries and reclad the facade. But City Hall may simply decide to 
replace the nine-story structure with a little park or open space. 
The question of 2 Columbus Circle has yet to be presented for formal 
consideration by Mayor Rudolph Giuliani, no great admirer of the building. 
Deputy Mayor Randy Levine said that a decision may come soon as part 
of the overall reinvigoration of Columbus Circle, including the development 
of the New York Coliseum site and the rerouting of traffic in true 
rotary fashion. Admirers of the building believe that it could be 
an ornament to the circle. They think its cascading galleries are 
surprisingly sophisticated. They respect the way its concave facade 
observes the geometry of Columbus Circle. They enjoy it as a memento 
of an exuberant era and an eccentric builder, Huntington Hartford, 
heir to the A&AMP;P supermarket fortune. Some even think the building 
is _ gasp _ a landmark. There would have been no predicting this in 
1964 when the gallery was most memorably dismissed as a ``die-cut 
Venetian palazzo on lollipops'' by Ada Louise Huxtable, the architecture 
critic at The New York Times. Today, she allows that she gets ``a 
little lift, a sense of pleasure'' walking by the building. ``I'll 
never elevate it to a work of art, but I think it has many things 
in its favor,'' said Ms. Huxtable, now the architecture critic at 
The Wall Street Journal. ``It's the only identifiable object on Columbus 
Circle.'' She added, ``I think it should be reused.'' So does Robert 
Stern, dean of the Yale School of Architecture, who favors landmark 
designation of the building. Stern said the design, by the architect 
Edward Durell Stone, is ``important, thoughtful and carefully articulated.'' 
An architect who knows Columbus Circle well, David Childs of Skidmore, 
Owings &AMP; Merrill, said Stone's building ``represents a moment 
in this century extremely well.'' The Skidmore firm has designed two 
projects for the Coliseum site, including a complex for both Time 
Warner headquarters and the Jazz at Lincoln Center concert hall. ``If 
someone could figure out a use for it, it would really be a good thing 
to save,'' Childs said of 2 Columbus Circle. Trump is unpersuaded. 
Even though he owns the General Motors Building on Fifth Avenue _ 
another marble-clad, Stone-designed 1960s structure overlooking Central 
Park _ Trump is contemptuous of 2 Columbus Circle. ``This has got 
to be the worst building in the city of New York,'' he said. ``It 
was universally disliked until people learned that it's about ready 
to come down. Then you have do-gooders coming to the rescue.'' The 
Calder Foundation is not much more enamored of the exterior. ``We 
don't like Ed Stone's portholes,'' said Alexander Rower, director 
of the foundation and grandson of the artist Alexander Calder. The 
foundation owns the largest collection of Calder's works. It envisions 
an architectural competition for a new facade, but would happily reuse 
the museum space, which cascades from the fifth to the second floors. 
The Dahesh Museum, which specializes in European academic painting 
of the 19th and early 20th centuries, appreciates the whole structure. 
``It was built as a museum,'' said the director, David Farmer. ``It 
is the right size for us. And we'd love nothing more than to preserve 
it.'' Hugh Hardy, of Hardy Holzman Pfeiffer Associates, an architectural 
adviser to the Dahesh Museum, said, ``The Dahesh Museum would in effect 
serve as the entry to a cultural corridor'' connecting Lincoln Center 
to the Museum of Modern Art. The Dahesh proposal has been welcomed 
by the art historian Robert Rosenblum; the sculptor Richard Lippold; 
Hugh Hildesley, executive vice president of Sotheby's; state Sen.-elect 
Thomas Duane of Manhattan, and the Committee for Environmentally Sound 
Development, a neighborhood group. It has also been endorsed by Juliet 
Hartford, an artist and Wilhelmina model who is Hartford's youngest 
daughter. ``Everybody in the art and fashion world loves that building,'' 
she said. Ms. Hartford has enlisted support from Brooke Astor, Prince 
Rainier of Monaco and Erivan Haub of Germany, the majority shareholder 
of Great Atlantic and Pacific Tea Co. Conspicuously absent from the 
list is Hartford himself, now 87 years old and living in Brooklyn. 
His daughter said he was not well enough to discuss the matter but 
would certainly be ``shocked'' if the building were demolished. There 
is little else to mark Hartford's celebrated squandering of the $100 
million fortune he inherited. His ill-starred projects in the 1950s 
and '60s included a cafe for Central Park, an artists' colony, a resort 
in the Bahamas, an automated parking garage, a handwriting institute 
and Show Magazine. He despised what he called ``thoroughly degenerate'' 
abstract art. Unlike most art critics, however, Hartford could put 
$7.5 million where his mouth was. ``My museum represents the taste 
of the country more than any of them,'' he said at the time. The centerpiece 
was a painting commissioned from Salvador Dali, ``The Discovery of 
America by Christopher Columbus.'' (It now hangs in the Salvador Dali 
Museum in St. Petersburg, Fla.) Stone, a co-designer of the Museum 
of Modern Art in 1939, favored his patron with white Vermont marble 
walls, book-matched walnut paneling, parquet and terrazzo floors, 
bronze fixtures, crimson carpeting and 12-inch-wide hinged portholes 
arranged along each corner. ``This building may be considered romantic 
_ a radical departure, with its arches and use of rich materials,'' 
Stone wrote in 1962. Critics found words other than ``romantic'' to 
describe the building, as Tom Wolfe recounted in his 1981 book ``From 
Bauhaus to Our House''. ``Not even such terms as `kitsch for the rich' 
and `marble lollipops' convey the poisonous mental atmosphere in which 
Stone now found himself. He was reduced, at length, to saying such 
things as, `Every taxi driver in New York will tell you it's his favorite 
building.''' The financially troubled gallery was taken over in 1969 
by Fairleigh Dickinson University and operated for six more years 
as the New York Cultural Center. Gulf and Western Industries bought 
the structure and donated it to New York City as the headquarters 
for the Department of Cultural Affairs. Henry Geldzahler, who was 
cultural affairs commissioner, and his companion, Christopher Scott, 
directed a renovation that preserved the open spaces and sumptuous 
materials. On accepting the building in 1980, Mayor Edward Koch said 
it was a ``nice home'' for the cultural agency. But he feels no lingering 
sentiment. ``It was never a cuddly building,'' Koch said this month. 
``It's an ugly building and totally unusable.'' Two Columbus Circle 
is not an official landmark, and even the New York Landmarks Conservancy 
is not sure it should be. The board is too divided on the merits of 
the building to take a position. But that intramural conflict is almost 
a recommendation itself, said the conservancy president, Peg Breen. 
``Thank God there are still buildings that generate controversy and 
fuel the debate about architecture in this town,'' she said.
