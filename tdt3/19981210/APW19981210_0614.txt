Despite an ``imperfect'' run, Alexandra Meissnitzer's performance 
Thursday was easily superior to the rest of the women's Super-G field, 
earning the Austrian her third World Cup win of the season. Under 
clear, sunny skies, the 25-year-old skier blitzed down the glittery 
1,985-meter (6,512-foot) Piste-G course in 1 minute, 21.95 seconds, 
leaving the rest of the field in her spray. Winning the Super-G for 
the second time at this classic World Cup event, Meissnitzer finished 
a convincing 0.79 seconds ahead of Germany's Martina Ertl, who is 
still winless this season. ``I was aggressive from the start to the 
bottom,'' said Meissnitzer, who won here in 1996. ``But it was a very 
difficult course and you just couldn't ski without mistakes. My run 
was certainly far from perfect.'' ``It was also difficult to make 
the transition from the race in Mammoth Mountain, which was a child's 
race, to the race here, which is so technically difficult,'' added 
Meissnitzer. Ertl also acknowledged the course was tough, and admitted 
having underestimated its level of difficulty. ``During the inspection 
run I didn't evaluate the course properly,'' said Ertl, who won one 
Super-G last season. ``So I ended up skiing too defensively and lost 
time because of that. It probably comes from my lack of confidence 
at the moment.'' Regine Cavagnoud's confidence in her ability was 
far from lacking, the Frenchwoman ignoring her coaches' advice in 
favor of her own instincts. The gamble paid off, Cavagnoud finishing 
third in 1:22.94, to the delight of the home crowd. ``I chose a low 
start number because I didn't want to receive any information about 
the course or be told what to do by the coaches,'' said Cavagnoud, 
who posted her best Super-G result since 1993. ``I wanted to run this 
race my way.'' Sweden's Pernilla Wiberg, the 1997 overall World Cup 
champion, crossed fourth in 1:23.08. Germany's Regina Haeusl placed 
fifth, 1.14 adrift, while Stefanie Schuster of Austria finished sixth 
in 1:23.18. Renate Geotschl, winner of both downhills this season 
and second at the Super-G in Mammoth Mountain last week, finished 
seventh, 1.30 seconds back. Coming into the season with three career 
World Cup victories, Meissnitzer has since doubled that number, winning 
the season-opening Super-G in Lake Louise, Canada, as well as a giant 
slalom in Park City, Utah three weeks ago. It was her fourth career 
World Cup Super-G win. The victory pads Meissnitzer's lead atop the 
rankings, where she sits with 525 points. Ertl's second place finish, 
however, prevented Meissnitzer from digging too wide a gap, sticking 
close to her heels with 383. The Super-G standings are of an identical 
order, Meissnitzer topping the table with 240, 100 points ahead of 
Ertl in second. The battle for the lead in the overall competition 
promises to be fierce, with both women determined to prevail, and 
each with their own trump card. While Meissnitzer appears to have 
the edge over Ertl in the speed events, the Austrian doesn't race 
in the slalom, one of Ertl's stronger suits. ``Of course I'm going 
for the overall,'' said Ertl. ``I'm astonished at my results in the 
downhill and I hope my skills in the slalom will give me an edge in 
the overall.'' Running the slalom gives Ertl the opportunity to collect 
extra points in the combined event as well. Clearly dominating since 
the start of the season, holding the lead in every discipline, the 
Austrians placed five skiers in the top ten. Germany, weakened by 
the absence of double Olympic gold medalist Katja Seizinger, had three 
in the top ten. Seizinger, the overall, downhill and Super-G World 
Cup champion last year, announced at the start of the week that her 
injured knees would keep her out of competition for the entire season.
