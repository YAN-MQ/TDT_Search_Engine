In its most unsettling scenes, set at a castle being used as a military 
training school for Hitler youth, Volker Schlondorff's film ``The 
Ogre'' suggests the stirring cinematic equivalent of a Wagner opera. 
As you watch hundreds of adolescent boys being hyped with a messianic 
blend of heroic German mythology and Nazi ideology and participating 
in torch-lit rituals and athletic contests, you sense of the thrill 
of being a boy swept up in the demented pageantry and passion of the 
Nazi cause. ``The Ogre'' _ made by the director of ``The Tin Drum,'' 
``The Handmaid's Tale'' and, most recently, the overripe American 
film noir, ``Palmetto'' _ is just the sort of grand, tortured allegory 
in which Central European filmmakers have long specialized. Adapted 
from Michael Tournier's novel ``The Erl King,'' the film poses knotty 
questions about good and evil and innocence and guilt, focusing many 
of them on an ambiguous (and pathetic) symbolic figure named Abel 
(John Malkovich) who narrates the movie. When we first meet Abel, 
he is a misfit and troublemaker at a strict French boarding school. 
One day, while on his way to be disciplined for disrupting a chapel 
service, he prays that the school burns down. As if by magic, fire 
suddenly breaks out in the chapel, distracting the headmaster and 
saving Abel from a severe beating but killing his best friend. As 
a result of this incident, Abel grows up with an inordinate sense 
of personal power and the rightness of his own destiny, even though 
he is consistently treated as an outcast. When a little girl he has 
befriended falsely claims he molested her, Abel avoids prison by going 
to the front in 1939 as World War II breaks out. Captured by the Germans, 
he becomes a lackey to a group of high-ranking German officers. One 
of them is Hermann Goering (Volker Spengler), whom the movie portrays 
as a grotesquely charismatic supermacho caricature, a Prussian giant 
obsessed with German mythology and with hunting wild animals. When 
it is discovered that Abel has a talent for making friends with children, 
he is sent into the countryside to find young boys and lure them to 
the castle as military conscripts. Abel's escapades earn him the nickname 
``the Ogre'' in the neighborhood. In the film's climax, the last-ditch 
Nazi fantasy of a heroic children's crusade against the invading Russian 
army collapses in a fiery Gotterdammerung as the Russian tanks arrive 
at the castle. Schlondorff treats this fantastical story as an expressionistic 
fable with some scenes shot in sepia, others in color and still others 
in black and white. As Abel, Malkovich gives an understated performance 
that captures the ambiguity of a character who does monstrous things 
yet remains a tender-hearted innocent, a kind of idiot savant who 
identifies with children and animals. Malkovich, who speaks in the 
soft, halting voice of a man-child, moves through the film with a 
blankly questioning, slightly cross-eyed stare. What's odd about his 
performance, and about the movie in general, is that a film this European, 
teeming with references to Goethe and German mythology, should have 
been made in English. ``The Ogre'' has strong supporting performances 
by Armin Mueller-Stahl as a count involved in a plot against Hitler, 
and Gottfried John, as Goering's fanatically loyal henchman and chief 
forester. But for all its ambitions and moments of brilliance, ``The 
Ogre'' doesn't feel unified or even complete. Episodic and vaguely 
surreal, it is the antithesis of a Hollywood film that tells us what 
to feel. Having unfolded an ever-widening series of moral questions, 
it deliberately leaves them hanging. PRODUCTION NOTES: `THE OGRE'
