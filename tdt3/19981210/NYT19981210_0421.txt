With President Clinton's fate in the House hanging on a razor-thin 
margin of perhaps one or two votes, Republican and Democratic leaders 
are scrambling to insure that a handful of ailing, retiring or traveling 
lawmakers are present for next week's historic vote on impeachment. 
Rep. George Miller, D-Calif., had hip surgery last week that normally 
requires six to eight weeks of recuperation. But Miller's doctors 
have cleared him to travel _ so long as he's lying flat much of the 
way. ``If he needs to be there, he'll be there, but he needs to go 
on a military plane or some other plane with a bed,'' said Danny Weiss, 
Miller's spokesman, who said he had notified the White House and Rep. 
Dick Gephardt, D-Mo., of Miller's special needs. A spokesman for Gephardt, 
Erik Smith, said Thursday night: ``We're going to try to work something 
out.'' Given that Clinton's destiny will be decided by a lame-duck 
Congress, 40 lawmakers who are retiring, lost re-election or failed 
in a bid to win Senate or governor's races now find their final vote 
will be their most momentous. That is, if they make it here. Democratic 
aides worry about Rep. Henry Gonzalez of Texas, who is retiring this 
year after a 38-year House career. Gonzalez is 82 and missed much 
of the 1998 legislative year because of heart problems, although he 
returned in September. ``If he makes it here, he makes it; if he doesn't, 
he doesn't,'' said a spokesman for Gonzalez, who spoke on the condition 
of anonymity. Republicans have their own concerns. Rep. Harris Fawell, 
a seven-term Illinois Republican who is retiring this year, had a 
quadruple-heart bypass on November 13, but his aides say he is rested 
and ready to vote (although they won't say which way). ``He's just 
not supposed to carry anything heavy, like luggage,'' said Kristin 
Wolgemuth, Fawell's spokeswoman. Republicans may have trouble reaching 
Rep. Jay Kim of California, who lost his primary race after pleading 
guilty to accepting $250,000 in illegal campaign contributions. Kim 
was sentenced to one year's probation, fined $5,000 and was required 
to wear an electronic-monitoring anklet for two months. Repeated telephone 
calls to Kim's offices in California and Washington went unanswered 
Thursday. With a majority of House Republicans set to vote to impeach 
Clinton, rumors swirled Thursday that a few retiring Republicans who 
oppose impeachment might not show up next week, to spare themselves 
the scorn of their colleagues. ``I can't imagine someone shirking 
this most important of constitutional duties,'' said Rep. Frank Riggs, 
R-Calif., who is leaving this year. ``These are just unfounded rumors 
and idle speculation.'' Three representatives who won election to 
the Senate _ Democrat Charles Schumer of New York and Republicans 
Jim Bunning of Kentucky and Mike Crapo of Idaho _ could vote twice 
_ on impeachment in the House, and on whether to remove Clinton, in 
the Senate. All three lawmakers have said that barring any congressionally 
required recusal, they would vote in the Senate, if such a vote is 
held. With Congress out of session, at least until next week, many 
legislators are scattered all over the globe on official business. 
A few are planning to jet in just before the votes begin next Thursday 
_ no doubt driving their nervous leaders to distraction. Rep. Rick 
White, R-Wash., who lost his re-election bid, is to give the keynote 
speech Tuesday before the International Internet Conference in Paris. 
White, whose district includes the headquarters of Microsoft, will 
deliver his address (in fluent French), and hop on a trans-Atlantic 
flight the next morning. He is still in the undecided camp, aides 
say. ``His duty is to represent his district as long as his term allows,'' 
said Randy Pepple, White's chief of staff. Rep. Ellen Tauscher, D-Calif., 
newly named to the House National Security Committee, left for Bosnia, 
Kosovo and Macedonia on Wednesday night. She is due back next Wednesday.
