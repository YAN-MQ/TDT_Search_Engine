The Central Council of the PLO ratified amendments to the group's 
charter on Thursday, setting the stage for a broader meeting with 
President Clinton next week that is to affirm that articles calling 
for the destruction of Israel have been revoked. Prime Minister Benjamin 
Netanyahu of Israel said on Thursday that the real test would come 
at that meeting on Monday, when members of the PLO's largest decision-making 
body, the Palestine National Council, and other officials are to endorse 
the changes. Adopted in 1964 as the founding document of the PLO, 
the charter has been a focus of dispute between Israel and the Palestinians. 
Its amendment was the subject of a separate section of the Israeli-Palestinian 
accord, known as the Wye Memorandum, signed in Washington on Oct. 
23. The Palestinians say that the charter's anti-Israeli clauses were 
annulled by a vote of the Palestine National Council on April 24, 
1996, which was welcomed then by both the Israeli and U.S. governments. 
The current Israeli government says that vote was inadequate, because 
it failed to specify which particular articles were revoked and did 
not adopt an amended charter. Netanyahu is demanding a vote on Monday, 
but Palestinian officials assert that no actual vote is necessary. 
The Wye accord makes no explicit mention of a vote, saying only that 
National Council members and other Palestinian officials will be invited 
to a meeting addressed by Clinton to ``reaffirm their support'' for 
decisions by smaller PLO bodies _ the Executive Committee last month 
and the Central Council on Thursday _ to ratify amendments to the 
charter. In Thursday's meeting, the PLO Central Council voted, 81-7 
with 7 abstentions, to approve changes in the charter specified in 
a letter sent by Yasser Arafat, the Palestinian leader, to Clinton 
last January. Factions opposed to the accords with Israel boycotted 
the meeting of the 124-member council, which is an intermediate body 
in size and importance in the PLO. ``The PLO Central Council decided 
to ratify the letter of President Yasser Arafat which was sent to 
President Bill Clinton on Jan. 22, 1998, concerning the articles which 
were canceled or amended by the Palestine National Council,'' said 
a statement from WAFA, the official Palestinian news agency. Cautioning 
against a ``farce'' at the meeting with Clinton on Monday, Netanyahu 
hinted that a Palestinian failure to hold a vote on the charter would 
halt Israeli compliance with the Wye accord. ``This coming Monday 
is a very important test day in the meeting of the Palestine National 
Council,'' Netanyahu said. ``Will there, or will there not be a vote 
to change the charter? If there will not, the result is clear.'' Arafat 
retorted: ``It is not their business. We are following our rules and 
regulations, and we are following what has been accepted in our committees, 
in our councils, in our meetings, and not from outside orders.'' Ahmad 
Abdel Rahman, general-secretary of the Palestinian Cabinet, said during 
a break in Thursday's meeting: ``We are not here to answer Israeli 
blackmailing of the PLO and the Palestinian people.'' Salim Zaanoun, 
the speaker of the National Council, was decidedly vague when asked 
on Thursday whether there would be a vote to amend the charter on 
Monday. ``I can't say,'' he said. ``This matter will be decided later, 
the way and manner.'' In Monday's meeting to be attended by Clinton, 
Zaanoun added, ``there will be a kind of expression of agreement on 
what was decided by the Central Council.'' A speech by Arafat will 
``convey to President Clinton and the whole world that all Palestinian 
institutions have agreed on the issue of the amendment, as detailed 
in the letter sent to President Clinton in which it was specified 
precisely which articles, one by one, were amended and canceled.'' 
The articles in question deny Israel's right to exist and call for 
armed resistance. Article 9 asserts that ``armed struggle is the only 
way to liberate Palestine, and is therefore a strategy and not tactics.'' 
Article 15 says it is ``a national duty to repulse the Zionist imperialist 
invasion from the great Arab homeland and to purge the Zionist presence 
from Palestine.'' Article 19 says: ``The partitioning of Palestine 
in 1947 and the establishment of Israel are fundamentally null and 
void, whatever time has elapsed.'' Article 22 asserts that ``the liberation 
of Palestine will liquidate the Zionist and imperialist presence and 
bring about the stabilization of peace in the Middle East.'' Palestinian 
officials argue that the PLO's recognition of Israel and the 1993 
Oslo accords have rendered the PLO charter irrelevant, turning it 
into an anachronistic remnant of a different era. Israel's repeated 
insistence on repealing the charter is a pretext for avoiding its 
own commitments, the officials say. ``Israel is looking for reasons 
not to implement its commitments.'' said Zaanoun. ``We are implementing 
our commitments fully, to the letter.''
