Bulgaria on Thursday abolished capital punishment and replaced it 
with life imprisonment without parole in a measure to move its legal 
system closer to European standards. The parliament voted 96-22 to 
approve the change. There were 3 abstentions. Bulgaria has suspended 
executions since 1990 when it endorsed a moratorium on carrying out 
death penalties. Courts have, however, kept on imposing them. The 
abolishment of the capital punishment doesn't automatically undo the 
verdicts of 19 convicts, who have been sentenced to death since 1990. 
They may be pardoned by President Petar Stoyanov.
