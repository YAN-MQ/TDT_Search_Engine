Iraq says United Nations weapons inspectors won't be allowed into 
any offices of Saddam Hussein's ruling party. Baghdad says the premises 
do not count as inspection sites. Washington has warned Iraq the use 
of force remains an option. National Security Council spokesman P.J. 
Crowley told THE WORLD Iraq must let the UNSCOM team do its work. 
We expect Iraq to cooperate fully with UNSCOM. That's what they said 
they would do. The president has clearly laid out specific benchmarks 
that we will use to evaluate exactly what Iraq is required to do. 
So we'll make a judgment once we hear from Chairman Butler and his 
assessment of Iraqi cooperation, and I would expect that to be a number 
of days away. P.J. Crowley at the National Security Council.
