BETHLEHEM, West Bank (AP) _ U.S. President Bill Clinton will light 
a Palestinian-grown Christmas tree over the traditional birthplace 
of Jesus, in a visit Palestinian officials characterized Thursday 
as a boost to their claims of statehood. A multi-million dollar face 
lift of the biblical city in preparation for millennium celebrations 
has been sped up for Clinton's visit there on Tuesday. Renovation 
of Manger Square, in front of the Church of the Nativity, where Clinton 
and his family are to light the Christmas tree, will be almost completed 
when the president arrives, promised Bethlehem Mayor Hanna J. Nasser. 
The church was built in the fourth century over the area where Jesus 
is believed to have been born. The Palestinians had been offered a 
giant Christmas tree from Norway but reluctantly turned down the gift 
citing problems with Israel over a similar offer last year from Finland. 
Then, Israeli authorities refused to release the tree from their port, 
claiming the imported trees might be carrying diseases. The Palestinians 
do not have a port of their own and so a more modest home-grown Palestinian 
tree will be used instead this year. ``We do not want to break heads 
with the Israelis,'' Nasser told members of the Foreign Press Association 
on a visit to his office Thursday opposite the Church of Nativity. 
Clinton's visit to the West Bank and Gaza will give recognition to 
Palestinian aspirations for statehood, said the urbane, goateed mayor, 
in a three-piece tweed suit and a red tie. Clinton, who has visited 
Christian sites in the Holy Land in the past, ``dreams to visit, with 
his wife and daughter, the place where Jesus Christ was born,'' Nasser 
said, adding that for security reasons, he had still not been fully 
briefed on the president's itinerary in his city. Nasser said donor 
nations have pledged dlrs 100 million for the Bethlehem facelift, 
but another dlrs 222 million is still needed to complete the work. 
He criticized ``Christian countries that have not contributed. If 
they do not contribute now, when are they going to?'' Meanwhile, construction 
workers in bright yellow rain suits mixed cement and paved over the 
football-field-sized square, which used to be the city's downtown 
parking lot under a light downpour. Christmas decorations have not 
been hung yet and Nasser acknowledged that most of the construction 
of the square and repair work for the main roads will not be completed 
by Dec. 25th. But he hoped that that would not keep away the 40,000 
people expected to celebrate there this year. ``People coming to Manger 
Square do not need a road,'' he said. ``They are pilgrims who come 
to see the place where Jesus was born.''
