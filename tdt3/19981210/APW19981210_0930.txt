KUMANOVO, Macedonia (AP) - A senior U.S. admiral on Thursday officially 
activated NATO's rapid reaction force to assist international monitors 
in Kosovo, by opening the command center in a Macedonian border town. 
Admiral James O. Ellis, commander-in-chief of NATO's Allied Forces 
Southern Europe, and senior Macedonian officials attended a ceremony 
in Kumanovo military base as few hundred French troops and Macedonian 
soldiers lined up for a salute. Ellis said the NATO extraction force 
``must be seen for what it is _ the last option to be used only as 
emergency measure when the lives of the unarmed verifiers are in jeopardy.'' 
``The deployment of the extraction force is a peaceful gesture,'' 
he said adding ``the measure of success of this mission will be if 
this force departs in some future time never having been used.'' NATO's 
French-led force in Macedonia, which borders the tense Kosovo province 
where some 2,000 international monitors are being deployed to observe 
a shaky truce, will also include troops from Britain, Germany, Italy, 
Canada and the Netherlands. The mission of some 1,800 NATO troops 
is still being assembled. The bulk of it will be formed by French 
soldiers, 700 of them, while other countries would provide the remaining 
troops. Yugoslav President Slobodan Milosevic reluctantly agreed to 
accept the verifiers from Organization for Security and Cooperation 
in Europe after he signed a U.S.-sponsored cease-fire agreement on 
Kosovo on Oct. 12. Yugoslavia has bitterly opposed the deployment 
NATO quick reaction troops in Macedonia, saying they jeopardized the 
country's safety. Macedonia was the only former Yugoslav republic 
which seceded without bloodshed from the six-republic federation in 
1991. Ellis said the troops mission ``is in no way to relieve the 
government of Yugoslavia of its primary responsibility for the safety 
and security of the unarmed teams deployed in Kosovo.'' ``Our hope 
and our intent us that this forces do not remain (here) a day longer 
than it is absolutely necessary,'' said Ellis. ``We hope for a peaceful 
solution in Kosovo.'' The Kosovo cease-fire is generally holding, 
but sporadic clashes between Yugoslav government forces and ethnic 
Albanian rebels continue as international officials push for a diplomatic 
solution. Upon his arrival in Macedonia earlier Thursday, Ellis said 
that the French-led force ``is well-equipped, well-trained, well-led 
and fully capable to carry out this mission.'' ``The forces are here 
only as a reaction to the concern of all the NATO countries which 
contributed members ... to ensure the safety of unarmed men and women'' 
verifiers in Kosovo, Ellis said.
