Dripping sarcasm, the Republicans' chief investigative counsel turned 
from a video clip of President Clinton's testimony and told the House 
impeachment inquiry, ``Life was so much simpler before they found 
that dress, wasn't it?'' If the minority Democrats on the Judiciary 
Committee had any remaining doubts that they were representing the 
president in the fight of his life, they were put to rest by the words, 
skeptical tone and upraised eyebrow that the Republican counsel, David 
Schippers, avidly applied in his summation attempt to demolish the 
president's defense. The rawest of emotions were evoked in the committee 
room as Schippers attacked Clinton the man as much as the president, 
describing him as someone with a ``conscious indifference and complete 
disregard for the concept of the truth.'' ``He picks out a single 
word and weaves from it a deceitful answer,'' Schippers scornfully 
contended, lambasting the president as much as indicting him. ``He 
also invents convoluted definitions of words and phrases in his own 
crafty mind.'' Democrats could only sit fuming in silence for three 
straight hours as Schippers, while insisting his task was a ``sorrowful'' 
one, belittled in particular the president's apologies to the nation. 
``We all know he's only admitted what he couldn't deny,'' Schippers 
said acidly, ``And he's continued to play games with the rest.'' For 
their part, Democrats later accused Schippers of ``sanctimonious lectures'' 
and a variation on McCarthyism, citing his dark assertion that he 
had come upon even more abuses by Clinton but could not comment on 
them because, he insisted, criminal investigations were under way. 
``Empty threats,'' said Barney Frank, D-Mass., arguing that the president 
merited censure for his misdeeds, not impeachment. In making their 
case on Thursday, the Democrats appealed through the day to history 
and to the American public. Their summation counsel, Abbe Lowell, 
repeatedly invoked the Watergate scandal of President Nixon as a measure 
of impeachable deeds that dwarfed the sex-and-mendacity scandal of 
President Clinton. But the Republicans cited their own Watergate lessons. 
``America emerged from that national nightmare a much stronger country,'' 
said James Sensenbrenner Jr. of Wisconsin, echoing the Watergate era 
language in arguing Clinton would leave a moral ``cancer'' on the 
nation were he to escape unimpeachment. The president's defenders 
were criticized as $500-an-hour ``beltway spinmeisters'' by Howard 
Coble, Republican of North Carolina who said his head clears when 
he drives home. ``All of a sudden I'm aware of the definition of sex,'' 
he said, mocking some of the president's defense arguments. ``All 
of a sudden I know what `is' is.'' On a day one member referred to 
as ``the MTV presentation'' for its reliance on various video and 
audio excerpts, Democrats opened with a clip of Peter Rodino Jr., 
the House Watergate chairman, stressing that partisanship was vital 
in any attempt to impeach. ``Listen to the American people,'' Lowell 
pleaded even as the inquiry wound down toward a vote expected to fall 
firmly along party lines. Schippers, a former federal prosecutor with 
a bare-knuckle demeanor who likes to stress that he is a registered 
Democrat, showed no hesitancy to lay into Clinton as ``a president 
caught in his own legacy of lies.'' ``There's no one left to lie to,'' 
he exclaimed in accusing the president of lying to family, government 
aides, the nation. He charged that Clinton would still be lying if 
not for the laboratory tests on Monica Lewinsky's dress, which provided 
DNA evidence of a liaison between the president and the White House 
intern. ``Does it ever stop?'' Schippers demanded in dismissing as 
distorted the defenses offered by presidential witnesses this week. 
``This again proves the arrogance of the White House and its total 
disdain of the intellect of the American people,'' he declared dismissively. 
To a denial that the president had committed perjury, Schippers scoffed, 
``Now that's a good one.'' He peppered his presentation with such 
comments as ``That, by the way is another lie.'' And he mocked various 
instances of the president's claiming vague recollection: ``This from 
a man who is renowned for his remarkable memory.'' Schippers' performance 
only reinforced the Democrats' alarm at the approaching vote. ``I 
think the American people still don't believe that we're foolish enough 
or partisan enough to impeach the president,'' said Charles Schumer, 
D-N.Y., sounding shocked as he sadly predicted that impeachment by 
the full House seemed more likely than ever. The committee put in 
a grueling day, with the 37 members finally starting their own 10-minute 
final statements in a grave, almost drained mood that the ranking 
Democrat, John Conyers of Michigan, described as ``staring into the 
void below'' as the vote looms this weekend. ``It's been an abstraction 
until now,'' one of the Democrats, William Delahunt of Massachusetts, 
said in an interview as the impeachment decision approached after 
a tumultuous, wearying year of scandal investigations. But he welcomed 
the vote as a relief of sorts even as he worried at the enormous stakes 
and fairly prayed for the public to show its opposition. ``The vote 
is necessary for the public to begin to comprehend the reality, and 
by Saturday they will be totally re-engaged in this,'' Delahunt said 
with an edge of hope. But Schippers bore down with prosecutorial zeal 
in warning against weighing the president's strong standing in opinion 
polls as a factor in the impeachment decision. He talked to the end 
of ``the president's lies and obstructions'' and denounced the ``gaggle 
of witnesses'' presented in his defense. As he finished, Schippers 
left no doubt on where he stood on the ``monumental'' question the 
committee now faced in ``deciding whether William Jefferson Clinton 
is fit to remain at the helm of the ship of state.''
