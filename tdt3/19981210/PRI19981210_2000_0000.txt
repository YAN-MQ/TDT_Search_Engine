From Public Radio International, this is THE WORLD, a co-production 
of the BBC World Service, PRI, and WGBH Boston. It's Thursday, December 
10th. I'm Tony Kahn. Today, Iraq blocks again U.N. weapons inspectors 
and the United States insists again Saddam must comply. And Puerto 
Ricans in East Harlem debate the future status of their homeland. 
The status question for us is like religion. It's our opium, so to 
speak, and, you know, as a family, you know, no matter where you are, 
you know, if you want to become -- if you want to be still part of 
that family, you better not dare cross that line. Also, erratic behavior 
by the Russian Duma. First, this news.
