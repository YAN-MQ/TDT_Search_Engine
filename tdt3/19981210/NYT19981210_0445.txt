Don Hewitt, the executive producer of the CBS News program ``60 Minutes,'' 
will apologize on the air Sunday night for a report his news magazine 
broadcast that turned out to have been faked. It is the first time 
in the 30 years since he created the program that Hewitt he has appeared 
on it, he said Thursday. ``I wanted to put an exclamation point on 
it, that it wasn't just another correction,'' Hewitt said. The report, 
which was broadcast on June 1, 1997, originated with a British documentary 
about drug smuggling, which showed people it described as Colombian 
drug couriers swallowing latex-glove fingers filled with heroin and 
then boarding planes to London. It also had interviews with alleged 
drug traffickers in Cali about how they planned to forge new European 
markets for heroin. The documentary, called ``The Connection,'' won 
many awards, but last May the British newspaper The Guardian published 
a lengthy report calling aspects of the film faked. It said the alleged 
couriers had been hired by the filmmaker to play those roles, and 
that an interview with the cartel's alleged leader said to have been 
conducted in ``a secret location'' had actually been conducted in 
the filmmaker's hotel room. The filmmaker, Marc de Beaufort, denied 
the newspaper's accusations last May. But Carlton Communications, 
the company that produced the film for Britain's ITV network and later 
sold it, began an investigation. This week, Carlton announced that 
it had found portions of the film to have been faked. Home Box Office, 
the pay-cable network, showed de Beaufort's documentary in its entirety 
on its Cinemax channel in June 1997, the week of the ``60 Minutes'' 
report. Sheila Nevins, the HBO executive in charge of documentary 
programs, showed the film to Hewitt earlier, hoping ``60 Minutes'' 
would do a report on it and mention that the film would be on Cinemax. 
``60 Minutes'' did, but first explored the report further, sending 
Steve Kroft, a correspondent, to London to interview de Beaufort and 
to review his raw footage. ``Not only were we doubly careful,'' Hewitt 
said Thursday. ``But in our piece we showed an interview with the 
United States Drug Enforcement Agency, and they said, `Yes, this is 
what happens, and it's very common, and hard to detect' and so on.'' 
De Beaufort, who is Colombian, could not be reached for comment Thursday. 
But in May, responding to The Guardian's charges, he said: ``The nightmare 
is that this whole article is based on three people who either lied 
to us or lied to the newspaper.'' ``60 Minutes'' rarely uses stories 
based on outsiders' reporting, but Hewitt said the filmmaker's reputation 
and his staff's reporting had persuaded them that the film was authentic. 
The Associated Press reported that Carlton Communications pledged 
to return the awards and refund the money paid by broadcasters for 
the rights to show it. In the statement he intends to read Sunday, 
Hewitt concludes: ``We, you and television viewers in 14 other countries 
were taken. To make amends, we felt obligated to lay it all out in 
detail and ask you to please accept our apology.''
