A jet from Canada's elite military aerobatics team crashed Thursday 
after touching another plane during a training exercise, killing the 
pilot. It was the third fatal crash in the past 10 years involving 
the Snowbirds, who perform aerobatic routines at air shows across 
North America. Air force officials said the accident occurred during 
a maneuver by a six-plane formation from the military air base at 
Moose Jaw. They said there was contact between two of the jets, prompting 
one to crash while the other was able to land safely. The pilot of 
the crashed plane _ the only person aboard _ was pronounced dead shortly 
after transfer to a hospital. His name was not released pending notification 
of relatives. The military immediately opened an inquiry into the 
accident. The Snowbirds _ a unit of 11 pilots _ were formed in 1971 
and since then have performed before an estimated 85 million spectators. 
The crashed jet was a Canadair CL-141 Tutor jet, a two-seater training 
plane built in the 1960s.
