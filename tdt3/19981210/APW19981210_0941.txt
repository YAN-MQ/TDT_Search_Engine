BRUSSELS, Belgium (AP) - The European Union and the United States 
on Thursday exchanged a new round of accusations of protectionnism, 
this time over the use of hush-kits which act as mufflers for plane 
engines. The EU executive Commission proposed last March to phase-out 
the use of aircraft equipped with hush kits by April 1, 1999. It argued 
that hush kit-equipped planes now fall below the standards of newer 
planes built with noise compliance in mind. ``This is an environmental 
issue,'' said Sarah Lambert, spokeswoman for the EU's Transport Commissioner 
Neil Kinnock. Lambert rejected U.S. accusations saying the new EU 
rule violates international legislation on aircraft noise pollution 
levels. ``The U.S. complaint is a thinly-veiled form of commercial 
protectionnism masquerading as environmental concern,'' Lambert said. 
But David Traynham, an official for the Federal Aviation Administration, 
said the EU move is ``less an environmental issue. It has a market 
protection impact.'' ``They are looking for a new standard for the 
EU region, different from the international standards,'' he told a 
news conference, after two days of negotiations with EU officials. 
The Commission proposal has been approved by the 15 EU countries and 
is now being examined by the European Parliament. The new rule won't 
affect aircraft registered prior to April 1. Traynham said the United 
States is concerned because a majority of hush kit manufacturers are 
non-European and virtually all hush kit installations are for non-European 
manufactured aircrafts. He said U.S. hush kit-equipped airplanes meet 
international rules limiting aircraft noise levels and that these 
planes will continue to fly ``indefinitely'' in the United States 
after the year 2000. The EU and the United States regularly squabble 
over trade issues ranging from steel to bananas, with each side repeatedly 
accusing the other of protectionnism.
