BELGRADE, Yugoslavia (AP) - In an ongoing purge of Serbia's independent 
media, a Belgrade court fined Thursday an independent daily and its 
chief editor the equivalent of dlrs 45,000 for allegedly slandering 
a neo-communist official. This was the second hefty fine slapped against 
Dnevni Telegraf (Daily Telegraph) since October when the restrictive 
media law, de-facto banning criticism of state officials and their 
policies, was adopted in Serbia. The first time on Nov. 9, the popular 
daily was fined the equivalent of dlrs 120,000. Later, its property 
was impounded and it had to move to Montenegro, the small republic 
which with Serbia forms Yugoslavia, to resume publishing. Early Thursday, 
the court acted on charges filed by deputy Serbian Prime Minister 
and leading neo-communist official Milovan Bojic who said an article 
published in Dec. 5 edition of Dnevni Telegraf slandered his image. 
During the brief court proceedings, Dnevni Telegraf's lawyers in vain 
tried to argue that Serbian laws cannot be implemented for newspapers 
which are published in Montenegro. Its chief editor Dragan Novakovic 
said he won't pay the fine and the authorities won't be able to impound 
his property as they already did so after the last trial. Several 
independent media outlets have been fined, and many had to close down, 
as the result of the media law which has been bitterly criticized 
by the West.
