Scientists have completed the first genetic blueprint of an animal. 
Ann Kellan has more in this edition of "tech trends." This tiny worm 
called "C. Elegans" fits on the head of a pin, lives in soil and feeds 
on rotting vegetation. C. elegans has made history -- the first multicelled 
animal with a complete genetic blueprint. I think this is a major 
milestone in our understanding of biology. For the first time, we 
have the complete sequence, the complete instruction book, if you 
will, of an animal. It took researchers at Washington University in 
St. Louis and the sanger center in Cambridge, England, eight years 
to break the DNA code of c. elegans' 20,000 genes. That chemical code 
or sequence is an instruction manual that reveals everything about 
the C. elegans, from how the worm grows from a single cell ages then 
dies to how it turns food into energy. Scientists decoded more than 
100 million chemical sequences that make up the worm's DNA code. And 
even though this worm is a distant cousin to humans, there are enough 
similarities to help scientists better understand human development 
and disease. The hopes of the parent of a child with a birth defect, 
the hopes of a Young man with a family history of cancer, the hopes 
of a couple caring for an aging parent are in some way advanced by 
our having this instruction book, a complete one of an animal, which 
is a model for all of those circumstances. Researchers say, thanks 
to the worm, they have been able to isolate a Gene suspected to cause 
Alzheimer's disease in humans. They have similar genes in the worm. 
And the only reason we really know anything about what those genes 
do in people is because they've been studied in worms. Scientists 
say they have sequenced about 6% of the human genes so far. A complete 
genetic fingerprint for humans won't be complete until the year 2003.
