This is meteorologist Valerie Voss with your "Headline News weather 
forecast" for Friday. Much of the nation will be quiet. As the day 
goes on, an area of low pressure will move only slowly across the 
gulf states, moving from Louisiana toward Mississippi with some rain 
and a few thundershowers a possibility. Also a chance of some showers 
in southern Florida along a frontal boundary. But most of the rest 
of the nation quiet, with the exception of the northwest where, once 
again, we'll see another round of rain and mountain snow and some 
pretty windy conditions, as well. Friday's highs range from 20s and 
30s over the great basin and rocky mountains to 30s across the northern 
Great Lakes and northeast, and also some 30s as far south as west 
Texas. The only mild air will be across sections of Florida and the 
southeast. Looking ahead to Saturday -- we'll see rain and thunderstorms 
continuing to move through the gulf coast states, with rain and snow 
in the northwest. On Sunday, wet on the east coast and in the northwest. 
Monday, it's the northwest that gets all the rain. Don't forget, four-day 
forecasts, 7,200 cities, at CNN.com.
