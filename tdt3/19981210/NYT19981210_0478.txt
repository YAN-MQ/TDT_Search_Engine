Electronic Data Systems, seeking a marquee leader able to restore 
its primacy in computer services, named Richard H. Brown, chief executive 
of Cable &AMP; Wireless PLC, as its own chairman and chief executive 
Thursday. Brown, who is leaving Cable &AMP; Wireless after just 29 
months, brings a reputation as a tireless rainmaker, dealmaker and 
management shuffler, credited by analysts with raising the London 
company's sales, profits and share price in his short tenure there. 
To do likewise at EDS, he will have to revive a company that is demoralized 
and uncertain in a rapidly changing, increasingly competitive business. 
As of Jan. 15, he will replace Lester Alberthal, who resigned in August 
under pressure from board members and major shareholders. The company 
must also find a new chief financial officer and vice chairman. Brown, 
a 51-year-old native of New Brunswick, N.J., avoided giving EDS any 
immediate prescriptions. ``When I get to EDS in January, my highest 
priority is going to be to meet clients, visit with the people at 
EDS and understand firsthand the business I'm in,'' he said from London 
in a telephone news conference. Alberthal and some other managers, 
had been criticized by employees and customers as aloof, although 
technically brilliant. If the board's search committee, led by former 
Secretary of State James Baker, reached outside the computer services 
industry, it did not reach too far. Computer services are converging 
with telecommunications, and Brown also has experience at Ameritech, 
one of the largest of the regional Bell companies. At Cable &AMP; 
Wireless, he bought MCI Worldcom's Internet and data operations.
