Libyan leader Moammar Gadhafi has called on OPEC countries to completely 
halt production during the winter season to boost record-low prices, 
Egypt's Middle East News Agency reported on Thursday. ``It is illogical 
that the prices of commodities we buy as consumers double at the time 
oil prices continuously go down.'' MENA quoted Gadhafi as saying in 
a letter sent to the members of the Organization of Petroleum Exporting 
Countries. The agency gave no other details. Oil prices have reached 
record-low due to a glut in the market and depressed demand in recession-hit 
Asia and a warm winter in the West.
