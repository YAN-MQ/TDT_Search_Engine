Endeavour's astronauts crossed a new threshold into the international 
space station today, turning on the lights and preparing the outpost 
for future assembly crews. Shuttle commander Robert Cabana and Russian 
cosmonaut Sergei Krikalev floated side by side into Unity, the American-made 
piece of the seven-story station, after opening a series of hatches 
leading from the shuttle Endeavour. They carried lanterns to see inside; 
the 36-foot cylindrical chamber was pitch-black, so their first official 
act was to flip on the lights. The six crew members shared the moment 
with the world: They took in cameras to provide everyone back on Earth 
with the first look inside the 250-mile-high space station. ``This 
is a very significant and almost momentous event,'' said NASA's lead 
flight director, Bob Castle. It was slow going to get through the 
three hatches leading from Endeavour into Unity. The astronauts, wielding 
checklists and wrenches, had to make sure the air pressure was constant 
from one area to the next before moving on. ``This is our goal _ building 
a space station and setting the pace for the future,'' Cabana said 
earlier in the day. ``When you get to look out the window and see 
Zarya and Unity joined together, and knowing that you get to go inside 
... it's pretty awesome.'' The five Americans and one Russian had 
plenty of work to do inside, beginning with the routing of air ducts 
from Endeavour into Unity. Cabana and astronaut Jerry Ross had to 
wire up a communications system inside Unity. The others were to continue 
on into the Russian-built Zarya control module, where Krikalev was 
to replace a charging component on a faulty battery. Other duties 
include transferring tools from the shuttle to the space station for 
later use. The astronauts will even leave behind clothes for the first 
permanent station crew, scheduled to arrive in January 2000. The work 
will continue through Friday, when the astronauts will exit the space 
station and close the hatches to get ready for Tuesday's return to 
Earth. On Wednesday, in preparation for their journey inside the station, 
Ross and astronaut James Newman ventured out on a seven-hour spacewalk 
and attached two 100-pound antennas to the outside of Unity. The antennas 
are part of the communications system to be wired up today. Once activated, 
the system will provide a direct, virtually uninterrupted communication 
link between Unity and Mission Control. Otherwise, U.S. flight controllers 
would have to rely on the sporadic coverage provided by Russian ground 
stations. In a tense and meticulously planned operation, Newman also 
pried open a stuck antenna on Zarya. After several pokes with a 10-foot 
pole, the 4-foot strip antenna shot out. ``There it goes! It's gone!'' 
Ross shouted. ``You got it deployed. All right,'' Mission Control 
radioed up. Other spacewalking chores completed by Ross and Newman 
included erecting a sunshade over a computer mounted to the outside 
of Unity and covering three of four protruding pins on the chamber 
with thermal blankets. Unfortunately for Ross, the thermal cover for 
the fourth pin got loose and floated away; he lost two tools during 
Monday's spacewalk. ``I don't believe this,'' he groaned. It was the 
second time this week that Ross and Newman floated out to work on 
the 35-ton station taking shape in the shuttle's cargo bay. During 
a 7{-hour spacewalk on Monday, they connected electrical and data 
cables to Unity, enabling it to be powered up. One more spacewalk 
is planned for Endeavour's 12-day mission. On Saturday, Ross and Newman 
will conduct a photo survey and take out a sack of tools that will 
be used by future station visitors. Newman also may try to unjam the 
other Zarya antenna.
