Dennis eckersley got it done for 24 years in the Biggs, a career that 
began during the Ford administration. This morning he announced his 
retirement. Before moving to the bull pen, eckersley won 20 games 
as a starter with boston 20 years ago. Third all time. I was thinking 
on the way to the ball park how much I love baseball. How much I'm 
going to miss it. Finally the white sox have given their manager a 
contract extension through 2001. The team lost Albert Belle to free 
agency.
