The Congolese government Thursday remained adamant that it would not 
meet with rebels backed by Rwanda and Uganda, dashing prospects for 
a cease-fire in the four-month conflict any time soon. President Laurent 
Kabila met briefly at the airport with his Kenyan counterpart, Daniel 
arap Moi, on the way home from a meeting with Zambian President Frederick 
Chiluba. Kabila refused to speak with reporters, but his ambassador 
to Kenya, Kyungu Wa-Ku Mwanza, said Kinshasa would not sign a cease-fire 
until Rwanda and Uganda set a date for the withdrawal of their troops 
from neighboring Congo. Both countries have been backing the rebellion 
with troops and equipment, claiming that Kabila has allowed Rwandan 
and Ugandan rebels to establish bases in eastern Congo from which 
to attack their countries. Both countries insist they will remain 
in Congo until measures are taken to secure their borders. International 
efforts to reach a cease-fire have foundered on Kabila's refusal to 
meet with or even acknowledge the rebels. After a cease-fire was apparently 
agreed upon at a Franco-African summit in Paris late last month, the 
warring parties were to meet next week in Lusaka, Zambia, to sign 
it. It was also agreed that a multinational force would be necessary 
to keep the peace and maintain security along the Rwandan and Ugandan 
borders in eastern Congo. But Ambassador Mwanza said Congo would only 
attend a Lusaka meeting under two conditions. ``The first point is 
that there are no rebels. If the rebels are brought to the same table, 
we will leave the conference,'' he said. ``The second point is that 
we are in accordance with signing the cease-fire on the condition 
that the invading forces leave our territory.'' Zimbabwe, Angola, 
Namibia and Chad have sent troops and equipment to bolster Kabila's 
forces and to stage a counter-offensive against rebel positions in 
eastern Congo. Kabila claims the rebels _ a coalition of ethnic Congolese 
Tutsis and disaffected military officers and Congolese politicians 
and academics _ are a creation of Rwanda and Uganda, which both helped 
him obtain power after toppling longtime dictator Mobutu Sese Seko 
in May 1997. ``It is true that President Kabila was aided by Rwanda 
and Uganda, but that does not mean he sold the country to Rwanda and 
Uganda,'' Mwanza said. He added that once a cease-fire was signed 
the Congolese government would accept the deployment of a multinational 
force. He said Chiluba had yet to issue invitations to the Lusaka 
summit, raising doubts the meeting scheduled for Dec. 14 would take 
place.
