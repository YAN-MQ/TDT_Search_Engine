Throwing its weight behind charges that racism was keeping nonwhites 
off national sports teams, the governing African National Congress 
on Thursday promised legislation to rectify the problem. In a statement, 
the ANC charged that both cricket and rugby teams, which often field 
all-white sides against international opponents, were not trying hard 
enough to promote talented players of other races. ``Both the rugby 
and cricket national teams remain lily-white despite their much publicized 
development programs in previously disadvantaged communities,'' the 
party said. Without specifying what sort of laws it would draw up, 
the ANC promised to propose legislation next year to enforce more 
racially representative sides. The attack follows similar pronouncements 
by the National Sports Council and Sports Minister Steve Tshwete, 
who has announced the creation of a special commission to explore 
integration efforts. The cricket team added a mixed-race player to 
its all-white lineup for this season's second test against the mostly 
black West Indies, which started Thursday. The rugby team that lost 
to England in its last match on Dec. 5 was all-white. The fact that 
the only English try was scored by a black, Jeremy Guscott, was an 
irony not lost on the 89 percent of South Africa's population that 
is not white. During years of international sporting isolation in 
the apartheid era, many blacks and coloreds, as people of mixed race 
are called in South Africa, refused to support their national teams 
and the feeling of hostility to all-white selections has lingered. 
Rugby, beloved of the white Afrikaners who dominated apartheid governments, 
is still hated by many blacks who see it as a symbol of oppression. 
Soccer has a largely black following, and the national team is mainly 
black. White soccer fans tend to root for English clubs.
