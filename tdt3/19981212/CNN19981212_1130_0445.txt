The American college of physicians has a warning for the baby boomer 
generation. It says boomers who've gained more than 25 pounds since 
high school may have doubled their risk of serious illness, including 
heart disease, diabetes and certain cancers. The group says that could 
ruin plans for their retirement in another decade or so. 65% of men 
and 53% of women in their 40s are overweight according to the group.
