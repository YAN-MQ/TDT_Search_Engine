Japanese Satoshi Mori had the longest jump of the first round Saturday 
and led jumping, giving him a 2-second lead going into the cross-country 
phase of a two-day Nordic combined World Cup event. Mori had jumps 
of 116 and 114.5 meter for 239.8 points and will start Sunday's 15-kilometer 
race two seconds in front of Alexei Fadeev of Russia. Fadeev had the 
longest jump of the day, going 113.5 and 117.5 meters, good for 239.4 
points. World Cup leader Hannu Manninen of Finland, a far stronger 
skier than Mori and Fadeev, was third and will start 17 seconds behind 
Mori. He said Olympic champion Bjarte Engen Vik of Norway, who was 
sixth in jumping and will ski 37 seconds after Mori, is the man to 
watch in the 15K. Mori led three Japanese skiers into the top five 
with Gen Tomii fourth and three-time World Cup champion Kenji Ogiwara 
fifth. ``I will try to ski my own race, at my pace, at not think of 
Manninen or anyone else,'' Mori said through an interpreter. ``I think 
I will catch them but Bjarte will be tough. I will prepare my tactic 
(race plan) tonight,'' Manninen said. He edged Vik by a stride Thursday 
in a one-day sprint event and has won four of the five World Cup combined 
meets this season, finishing second to Vik in the other event. ``I 
think this altitude (2,040 meters, 6,700 feet) is still a problem 
for me. This race is longer (than Thursday's 7.5K) and I am not yet 
used to skiing at this altitude,'' Manninen said. Norwegian coach 
Jan-Erik Aalbu, who broke a finger on his left hand playing basketball 
with Manninen and his teammate Jari Mantila, agreed with the tall 
Finn. He also said American Todd Lodwick, a hometown favorite who 
was tied for 11th and starts 2:05 later, will be someone to watch, 
too, in addition to the Norwegians and Manninen. ``Bjarte jumped well 
and I think it will be Hannu and Bjarte, and then some Norwegians. 
And Todd skis so well in Steamboat; he's used to this altitude, so 
that should be a factor,'' Aalbu said.
