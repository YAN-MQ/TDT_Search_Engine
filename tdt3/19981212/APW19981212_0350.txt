Malaysia will offer incentives to foreigners to buy real estate in 
an effort to revitalize the property market and speed up economic 
recovery, a news report said Saturday. The temporary measures, which 
will be in effect for one month starting Saturday, will make it easier 
for foreigners to get loans to buy residential real estate. Non-resident 
foreigners without work permits will be allowed to borrow up to 50 
percent of the property price from banks and other financial institutions. 
Normally, Malaysian law bars foreigners without works permits from 
getting loans at all. Non-residents with work permits will be able 
to get bank loans for up to 95 percent of the sale price. They are 
normally only eligible for loans up to 60 percent. The incentives 
are part of a national Home Ownership Campaign, during which property 
will also be offered at a 10 percent discount. The incentives for 
foreigners will only apply to residential properties worth more than 
250,000 ringgit (dlrs 61,000).
