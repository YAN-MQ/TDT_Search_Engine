Like a grand piano-sized floral arrangement at a mob funeral, historical 
respect has finally been laid before the memory of Charles (Lucky) 
Luciana, who changed his surname to Luciano as a rising young mafioso 
because he somehow thought it was easier to spell. Last week, Time 
magazine included the original Godfather, who consolidated the blood-feuding 
gangsters of the Prohibition era into a centrally supervised criminal 
syndicate that became known as the Mafia, on its list of the 100 ``most 
influential business geniuses of the century.'' Luciano, enthused 
Time, ``used Standard &AMP; Poor's as much as Smith &AMP; Wesson'' 
to succeed in business. But New York City Mayor Rudolph Giuliani, 
a former prosecutor, took issue, pointing out that Luciano's rise 
to the top was based mostly on ``murdering lots of people.'' Whatever 
his recipe for success, Luciano was undoubtedly the mob's first modern 
business visionary. Today's bookshelves are crowded with self-help 
books from celebrated tycoons. If Luciano had written one, here are 
some lessons he might have offered. _ JOE SHARKEY Start Networking 
Early (BEGIN ITALICS HERE) In 1907, the 10-year-old Luciano, a Sicilian 
immigrant on the tough streets of Manhattan's Lower East Side, was 
arrested for shoplifting:(END ITALICS HERE) During the same year he 
started his first racket. For a penny or two a day, Luciano offered 
younger and smaller Jewish kids his personal protection against beatings 
on the way to school. If they didn't pay, he beat them up. One runty 
kid refused to pay, a thin little youngster from Poland, Meyer Lansky. 
Luciano attacked him and was amazed when Lansky gave as good as he 
got. They became bosom buddies after that. _``The Mafia Encyclopedia,'' 
by Carl Sifakis (Facts on File, 1987) Don't Settle for Chump Change 
(BEGIN ITALICS HERE) Luciano dropped out of school and worked briefly 
for $7 a week in a hat factory. But after winning $244 in a craps 
game, he never did another honest day's work.(END ITALICS HERE) ``Who 
wants to wind up being a crumb?'' he remarked to a friend. ``I'd rather 
drop dead.'' _ ``The Luciano Story,'' by Sid Feder and Joachim Joesten 
(Da Capo Press, 1994) All Work and No Play . . . (BEGIN ITALICS HERE)One 
day, when Luciano and an associate were pulled over for running a 
red light on Fifth Avenue, Luciano explained to the officer that the 
arsenal of pistols, shotgun and bullets plainly visible in the back 
seat were actually sports gear.(END ITALICS HERE) ``We just come back 
from hunting,'' was his easy explanation. ``What were you hunting?'' 
``Oh, peasants.' ``Pheasants?'' ``Yeah, that's right. Pheasants.'` 
_``The Luciano Story'' Respond Quickly to Public Relations Crises 
In 1931, Luciano decided that merger and acquisition was the way to 
expand his fledgling mob empire. He lured the reigning kingpin, Giuseppe 
(Joe the Boss) Masseria, to lunch at a Coney Island restaurant, where 
four of his henchmen barged in and riddled the old-timer with bullets 
after Luciano excused himself to go to the men's room. Luciano later 
told reporters that of course he had heard the gunfire: ``As soon 
as I finished drying my hands, I hurried out and walked back to see 
what it was about.'' _``Murder Inc.,'' by Sid Feder and Burton Turkus 
(Farrar, Straus &AMP; Young, 1951) Be Upwardly Mobile ``Prior to Prohibition,'' 
Sol Gelb, a New York criminal attorney in the 1920s, said . . . ``a 
hoodlum was a hoodlum. A fellow who committed crimes never mixed with 
respectable people. (After Luciano) they began to look and act the 
same as respectable people.'' _``Blood and Power: Organized Crime 
in 20th-Century America,'' by Stephen Fox (William Morrow, 1989) Dress 
for Success Luciano's men were ordered to dress neatly and conservatively, 
like office workers, to avoid wide-brimmed hats, loud shirts and ties, 
garish suits completely. ``Let Capone and the Chicago guys do that. 
We won't.'' _``The Last Testament of Lucky Luciano,'' by Martin A. 
Gosch and Richard Hammer (Little, Brown, 1974) ``He leaned maybe a 
degree or two to the liberal side of conservative,'' is the way one 
gentlemen's couturier put it. ``But always in the height of style.'' 
_``The Luciano Story'' Encourage Zero-Defect Productivity Of recalcitrant 
employees, Luciano recalled: I just tried to make 'em understand the 
penalties of stupidity. . . . Some guys got their fingers broke or 
their knuckles cracked or maybe had their heads busted. They hadda 
learn how to do it the right way the next time. _``The Last Testament'' 
Maintain Tight Inventory Control We knew more about trucks and tight 
schedules than any company in the country. So we looked over the market 
and decided to put a little squeeze on here and there. . . . For example, 
milk spoils pretty fast and so does bread and vegetables. In no time 
at all, we had a lock on three or four of the biggest fresh-food businesses 
in America. . . . After all, nothin' spoils faster'n fish. _``The 
Last Testament'' Look for New Synergies (BEGIN ITALICS HERE) Luciano 
teamed with the Chicago newspaper executive Moses Annenberg to operate 
an illegal telephone wire service to supply instant horse-race results 
to bookie joints nationwide:(END ITALICS HERE) The new racing wire 
had been worked out with the telephone company. To this day, that 
high-class corporation knows that it's the heart of the biggest gamblin' 
empire in the world. As far as Annenberg was concerned, he never could've 
operated without us. He needed us and we needed him. It was a good 
thing all around. _``The Last Testament'' Beware the Taxman (BEGIN 
ITALICS HERE) In 1936, the New York federal prosecutor (and future 
governor) Thomas E. Dewey indicted Luciano on 90 counts of extortion 
and ``direction of organized harlotry.'' At his trial, Dewey ridiculed 
the multimillionaire Luciano's obviously bogus federal tax returns, 
which showed he never made more than $22,500 a year. (END ITALICS 
HERE) ``You just picked those figures on your income out of the sky, 
didn't you'?'' Dewey finally charged. ``I just thought it was the 
proper amount I should give the government,'' responded Lucky. _``The 
Luciano Story'' Play to Your Strengths (BEGIN ITALICS HERE) When Luciano 
was convicted, his pre-sentencing report stated: (END ITALICS HERE) 
He possesses average intelligence, but is a shallow and parasitic 
individual who is considerably wrapped up in his own feelings. His 
ideals of life resolved themselves into money to spend, beautiful 
women to enjoy, silk underclothes and places to go in style. His social 
outlook . . . is dominated by recklessness and a craving for action. 
His only asset as a leader consists of his apparent calmness in times 
of stress. _``The Luciano Story'' Think Globally (BEGIN ITALICS HERE) 
During World War II, authorities sought out Luciano in prison to use 
his influence to prevent wartime sabotage or work slowdowns on the 
mob-controlled shipping docks. (END ITALICS HERE) Nevertheless, he 
continued to maintain active leadership of the syndicate from behind 
bars. In 1946, Luciano was paroled for what was described by Governor 
Dewey as wartime services to the country . . . When he was released 
. . . Luciano was deported to Italy. He sneaked back to Cuba later 
that year to run the American syndicate from that off-shore island. 
From Cuba, Luciano approved the execution of Bugsy Siegel for looting 
the syndicate's money building the Flamingo Hotel in Las Vegas. _``The 
Mafia Encyclopedia'' (BEGIN ITALICS HERE)Forced back to Italy, Luciano 
began arranging the mob's expansion into the global drug trade.(END 
ITALICS HERE) Narcotics Bureau Supervisor Garland Williams charged 
that three months after Luciano's return (to Italy) from Cuba in 1947, 
the first large shipment of heroin, worth $250,000, was smuggled into 
the United States. _``The Luciano Story'' Don't Trust Reporters . 
. . (BEGIN ITALICS HERE) In exile, Luciano blamed the press for depicting 
him as the ``capo di tutti capi,'' the boss of all bosses of organized 
crime. (END ITALICS HERE) ``The American press is disgraceful,'' he 
blurted out. . . . ``There is too much freedom of the press in America. 
... Someday, I'm gonna write my own memories,'' he said. ``Then the 
real story is gonna come out.'' _``The Luciano Story'' . . . and Protect 
Your Movie Rights In his later years, Luciano bragged about what he 
felt was the inevitable movie deal. `I got a lotta offers _ offers 
to pay me good, too. I'm not puttin' up a nickel of my own for it.''
