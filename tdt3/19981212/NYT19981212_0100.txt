Leaders of the 15 European Union countries on Saturday put off until 
next year decisions on changing budget and decision-making procedures 
to prepare for the admission of formerly communist nations. ``Obviously, 
this wasn't the summit where we were going to resolve these issues,'' 
Prime Minister Tony Blair of Britain said. The leaders said their 
commitment to expansion to the east remained undiminished, though 
apparently some politicians from nations aspiring to join the union 
had their doubts when they met the current leaders Saturday. ``Most 
of them have stopped thinking in terms of the immediate future,'' 
said Prime Minister Lionel Jospin of France, who like other leaders 
described that attitude as realistic. After a two-day summit meeting 
in the Hofburg Palace, seat of the former Austro-Hungarian Empire, 
the leaders said they would meet again in February and March and try 
to resolve most of their differences by their next regularly scheduled 
summit meeting in Cologne next June. Even so, Chancellor Gerhard Schroeder 
of Germany said, changes to Europe's costly agricultural subsidy program, 
widely held to be untenable when countries like Poland with tens of 
thousands of small farmers will come in, would take longer than the 
next six months, when Germany will hold the European Union's rotating 
presidency. The agricultural subsidies program is projected to cost 
more than $50 billion a year in the next decade unless the system 
is changed, according to the European Commission in Brussels. In hopes 
of keeping the new Europe affordable, the rich countries that will 
have to pay for it had hoped to get agreement on a spending limit. 
But they were blocked by Spain, Greece, Portugal and other countries 
that get back more in European support funds than they pay in contributions. 
The European leaders said they would intensify talks with the leading 
candidates for new membership _ Hungary, Poland, Estonia, the Czech 
Republic, Slovenia and Cyprus _ early next year. Agreements on admission 
terms are expected to take several years, with preliminary talks with 
five other countries _ Romania, Slovakia, Latvia, Lithuania and Bulgaria 
_ also getting under way in earnest next year. Germany and France, 
both with center-left governments, also pushed through a summit-meeting 
commitment to a ``European jobs pact'' next year, aimed at bringing 
the average European Union unemployment below the current 9.8 percent. 
But opposition from Spain and Britain watered down a commitment sought 
by German and French leaders on binding government targets for creating 
new jobs. Though Britain argued with Spain against too much state 
intervention, the European leaders agreed to coordinate economic policies 
and work on general job goals closely next year after a common currency, 
the euro, is introduced in 11 member countries. European Union leaders 
sounded one note of alarm Saturday _ about the imminence of a potential 
year 2000 problem for computers. They called for a special meeting 
in Brussels, Belgium, to discuss the effects it could have on transportation, 
energy and water-supply networks.
