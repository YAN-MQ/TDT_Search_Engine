Two Russian governors who fear winter food shortages in their territories 
are defying federal law by banning food shipments to other areas of 
the country, a newspaper reported Saturday. The governors of Krasnoyarsk 
and Kemerovo in Siberia will impose the restrictions next week, the 
English-language Moscow Times said. Krasnoyarsk Gov. Alexander Lebed 
signed an order Wednesday making it virtually impossible to take dairy 
products, meat, poultry, fish and vegetables out of the region after 
next Tuesday, the report said. Aman Tuleyev of Kemerovo was expected 
to sign an order on Monday banning meat shipments. The paper said 
neither man expected Moscow to take action to block their decrees. 
The paper said the moves were a sign of the growing power and independence 
of local governors, the report said.
