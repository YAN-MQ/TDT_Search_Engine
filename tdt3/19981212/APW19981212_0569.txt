In a retrial demanded by international mediators, a Bosnian Serb court 
Saturday sentenced three Muslims to a total of 51 years in prison 
for murder. Two of the men were sentenced to 20 years in prison each, 
the third was given an 11-year sentence. Four other Muslims were charged 
with illegal possession of weapons and sentenced to one year in prison 
each. The verdict differed only slightly from the initial trial last 
year, when all three men charged with murder were given 20-year prison 
terms. International officials, however, called the 1997 trial a sham 
and insisted the seven Muslims be tried again. International officials 
who monitored Saturday's trial made no immediate comment. The men 
claimed to have escaped from a massacre of thousands of Muslim men 
when Bosnian Serbs captured the town of Srebrenica, south of Zvornik, 
in July 1995. They said they survived months in the wild, and claimed 
they surrendered when they spotted U.S. soldiers patrolling the former 
front line in May 1996. The U.S. troops noted some of the men were 
wearing military uniforms, carrying weapons and had recent haircuts, 
and handed them over to a Bosnian Serb police. They were held for 
a year before the first trial opened. Saturday's ruling stunned the 
defense lawyers, who plan to appeal the ruling to a supreme court. 
``This is a catastrophe. There is no evidence of a murder,'' said 
Bakir Pasic a defense lawyer. ``There are no bodies of those murdered.'' 
According to Pasic, the court based its ruling on a report that four 
Serbs went missing and were never found, without any substantial evidence 
linking their disappearance to the Muslims. Some remains found in 
the woods were used as evidence, but the court refused a doctor's 
request that forensics be used to identify them. All three men sentenced 
to extended prison terms _ Nedzad Hasic, Ahmo Harbas and Behudin Husic 
_ were found guilty of murdering unidentified persons. They announced 
they were staging a hunger strike in protest of the court's decision. 
The other four were let go, as the judge ruled they had already served 
a year in prison.
