Half-crazed, shrieking children rip into present after present, tossing 
toys right, left and up in the air. Suddenly, they are done. Some 
are still wild-eyed, but some are dazed as they stare at their seasonal 
loot. Soon, all are playing merrily with the empty boxes as if they 
are the best toys of all. America's children are being buried in an 
avalanche of toys. It's partly a function of demographics: There are 
fewer children and more adults to dote on them. But television's ceaseless 
shilling of merchandise fuels the fire. So do guilt on the part of 
working, often absentee parents; clever marketing of toys as learning 
tools, and the inescapable realization that a kid transfixed by a 
toy is a kid temporarily not bothering a parent. ``Enough, already!'' 
is the cry of a growing chorus of professionals dealing with children. 
They fear children are being simultaneously overstimulated and desensitized 
by a deluge of misguided love. ``Even grandparents are becoming almost 
hesitant to give their grandchildren toys,'' said Dr. Karen Nesbitt 
Shanor, a clinical psychologist in Washington. ``They see the children 
have so many toys and that everybody's overwhelmed by the situation.'' 
Dr. Shanor, who next year will publish a book on the development of 
children's brains called ``The Emerging Mind,'' said too much gift-generated 
stimulation can hurt learning by decreasing concentration. Moreover, 
she said, the stimulation itself feeds the need for ever more stimulation 
as a result of chemical changes in the mind. Ultimately, such an addiction 
to stimulation can contribute to such syndromes as attention deficit 
disorder. ``It's a vicious cycle,'' Dr. Shanor said. Kids might be 
pardoned for seeing a different sort of viciousness. After lecturing 
that candy rots teeth and playground see-saws are unsafe and peanut 
butter sandwiches are dangerous, the grown-ups are now plotting to 
take away Christmas. But too many gifts can affect a child's emerging 
sense of self worth, said Dr. Paul Ciborowski, a professor in the 
counseling department of Long Island University. Children can become 
confused if their value seems to be measured in things, he said. In 
the worst cases, a child could begin measuring his worth by how much 
money is spent on him, Ciborowski added. ``A genuine expression of 
caring is very important in terms of the ego development of young 
children,'' he said. ``Toys are only one of a number of ways to share 
and express love.'' Nobody blames children, but almost all experts 
fault parents for the toy explosion. ``Many parents communicate feelings 
by giving gifts rather than by direct communication of their feelings,'' 
said Dr. Kenneth Skodnek, a child psychiatrist at Nassau County Medical 
Center, on New York's Long Island. ``It's almost as if materialism 
becomes the matrix of social relations _ our sense of self esteem 
and our relation to others.'' Adults, the experts say, should simply 
take a firm stand. ``Children need adults to tell them they've had 
too much candy,'' said Dr. Gail Saltz, a psychologist at New York 
Cornell Medical Center. ``And if the adult is the cause of too much 
candy, it's really a bad situation.'' Common sense, without shades 
of Ebenezer Scrooge, is the goal. One of Dr. Shanor's suggestions 
is to parcel gifts out over longer periods; she even suggests putting 
away all but a couple of gifts after they are opened. Dr. Nancy Brush, 
a psychology professor at Fordham University, says Hanukkah with its 
eight days of gift-giving, or celebrating the 12 Days of Christmas, 
can be considerably more reasonable than a single gift-giving orgy. 
Another idea is to give children more complicated toys that can engage 
them for longer periods of time. ``More complicated toys that are 
developmentally appropriate are better than multiple toys,'' Dr. Brush 
said. In particular, she suggested a toy called a surprise box that 
requires five different skills to open: To open one door, you slide 
a lever, and to open another, you flip the equivalent of a light switch. 
Such toys, she said, can enhance a child's sense of mastery. And motivation 
to achieve, she added, flows from doing something simple and having 
an effect on one's environment. But this requires concentrated study 
and thought on the part of children _ and an overabundance of toys 
can be a decided distraction. ``If you have too many toys, children 
don't want to explore a particular toy in depth,'' Dr. Brush said. 
Along the same lines, child experts say toys should be chosen to encourage 
fantasy. Complicated toys that offer more to watch than to do are 
a no-no. ``The more the toy does for you, the less opportunity you 
have to engage actively,'' said Elizabeth Schnur, a psychologist at 
the Jewish Child Care Association who studies the developmental reasons 
some children do better than others. Dr. Jeffrey Derevensky, a child 
psychologist at McGill University, has studied toys and children extensively. 
He has also worked as a consultant with Fisher-Price and others to 
get better toys on the market. He points out that even from a child's 
viewpoint, more is not always better. An example is children's desire 
to hear the same book read over and over. ``If you read it enough 
times, they know it by heart,'' he said. ``But you can't skip pages 
in it. They want that kind of element of control.'' Educational toys 
are best, Derevensky said, particularly educational computer software. 
``The best thing about a computer is that it has an infinite amount 
of patience,'' he said. ``It never yells at a child. It never says, 
`How many times are we going to have to go over this before you learn 
it?''' But Derevensky and others particularly recommended gifts like 
board games that can bring families together to participate in an 
activity. ``When you think about the fond memories of holiday times,'' 
he said, ``certainly some of the things stand out, like the old Schwinn 
bicycle. But the vast majority of the memories are personal ones, 
the ones where families did things together. ``Ask kids what is the 
best part of Christmas, and they'll say, `No school and I got to go 
to the movies with my parents.' ''
