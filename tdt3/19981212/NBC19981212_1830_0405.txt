All eyes are on the members of the house still undecided. NBC's Joe 
Johns has been keeping count. Good evening, Joe. Good evening. Out 
of 435 members of Congress, a handful now have not declared how they 
will vote when articles of impeachment reach the floor. Of those, 
fewer than half are what might be called legitimate fence-sitters 
-- Members in the center aisle as though truly undecided members weigh 
the issues, they are also weighing public opinion in their districts. 
In the fourth district of Arkansas, which includes President Clinton's 
hometown, voters have supported him by no less than 55% in the presidential 
elections. Republican congressman Jay Dickey represents the district. 
He claims to be feeling pressure to vote against impeachment, but 
says he was dissatisfied with the president's statement of contrition 
yesterday. I had hoped he would have come out and say, "yes, I was 
guilty of lying under oath," in fact that is perjury, and I'm sorry 
for what has caused our nation the discomfort and the irritation. 
The congressman from New Jersey's seventh district has a similar view. 
Bob franks plays down the notion Barton that either way he votes, 
amendment, but with his political future is riding dis on the outcome. 
I believe that every vote one casts as a member of the Congress has 
some political consequences. But the undecided and undeclared members 
who are keeping their own counsel worry vote counters the most. Iowa's 
first district is represented Jim leach, who has been known to Buck 
his party. The first district went for Clinton in both presidential 
elections, but on the issue of impeachment, there is no clear signal. 
His private life is between him, his wife, their daughter and their 
lord, that's the way I look at it. Perjury is perjury. And in Kentucky's 
third district, another quiet fence-sitter. In a district where Bill 
Clinton won at the polls for two consecutive presidential elections, 
congresswoman Ann northup has kept her own counsel, but her constituents 
have plenty to say about impeachment. Courting the undisclosed members 
is tricky, because both parties claim this is supposed to be a vote 
of conscience, not political pressure. NBC's Joe Johns, thank you.
