Palestinian police helped quell anti-Israel protests on Saturday, 
hours before U.S. President Bill Clinton is to arrive in the region 
_ a sign of Palestinian leader Yasser Arafat's determination to smooth 
the visit. In Palestinian-administered Bethlehem, Palestinian protesters 
stoned Israeli soldiers guarding the entrance of the city. The troops 
_ positioned below a banner declaring ``Bill Clinton: Welcome to Palestine'' 
_ responded with tear gas and rubber bullets. A few minutes before 
the fighting broke out, a family set up Christmas decorations on a 
balcony directly above the banner. Palestinian police later moved 
in to contain the protesters. Clinton is to light a Christmas tree 
in the town believed to be where Jesus was born on Monday. The visit 
was meant to celebrate the U.S.-brokered agreement achieved at Wye 
River in October; instead, Clinton will now try to salvage it. The 
Palestinians are angry that Israel refuses to release Palestinians 
jailed for anti-Israel activities and has instead released mostly 
common criminals to meet its prisoner release commitments. The Israelis 
accuse the Palestinian Authority of being behind the wave of violence 
that broke out last month over prisoner releases. Two protesters died 
in heavy violence on Friday. In the Palestinian-administered town 
of Qalqilya on Saturday, 10,000 people attended the funeral of Kamal 
Adwan, 21. The mourners shouted ``Revenge!'' and Adwan's father, Mansour, 
beseeched them not to offer condolences: ``My son is in paradise, 
he has done his duty for the homeland.'' The Palestinian Authority, 
while expressing sympathy for the protesters, has denied any involvement 
_ but did not take concrete steps to contain the violence until recent 
days. In the militant Islamic bastion of Hebron on Saturday, Palestinian 
police and security agents flooded the campus of the Islamic University 
after militants said they would stage a flag-burning anti-U.S. demonstration 
in time for the visit. The demonstrators never showed. Palestinians 
aiming their slingshots at Israeli troops in Bethlehem said they were 
not opposed to the Clinton visit. ``I'm protesting by throwing stones 
so that my brother will be released from prison,'' said 18-year-old 
Khaled Dakakta, slingshot in hand. ``This is not timed for Clinton 
... but we will not stop until they will be free.'' The Palestinians 
Prisoner's Association, which has been coordinating some of the protests, 
called off a commercial West Bank-wide strike scheduled for Monday, 
out of deference to Clinton. The highlight of the visit will be Clinton's 
attendance at a meeting of the Palestine National Council on Monday 
evening, intended to abrogate clauses in the Palestinian charter calling 
for Israel's destruction. Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, 
under pressure from hard-liners who may bring down his government 
unless he scraps Wye, has said he will not go ahead with a planned 
withdrawal from further West Bank territory unless the offending passages 
are abrogated in a clear-cut vote. Arafat says that ``affirmation'' 
is enough. Asked what that means, he said Saturday that ``we are not 
in need of a vote.'' Although he likely has a majority behind him, 
Arafat may be backing off a vote because he lacks the numbers to get 
the required two-thirds quorum of the 600-member to attend Monday's 
meeting. On Saturday, 104 rejectionists said they would not attend 
the meeting on principle; Israel has refused to allow some other PNC 
members into Gaza. In a pamphlet published Saturday, the militant 
Islamic group Hamas also dismissed Clinton as ``an enemy of the Arabs'' 
who is arriving to ``personally supervise in the direst way the destruction 
of the Palestinian charter.'' Hamas warned Arafat to release its leader, 
Sheik Ahmed Yassin, from house arrest by Dec. 25 _ otherwise it would 
carry out attacks against Israel. In Bethlehem, Christmas preparations 
continued apace. Huge Palestinian and U.S. flags hung over Manger 
Square, and locals shopping for presents mingled with U.S. agents 
securing the site. ``I wish that Mr. Clinton he can make Netanyahu 
release our prisoners and to move forward with the peace process,'' 
said one shopper, Georgina Khoury. Douglas Dicks, from Strasburg, 
Va., snapped a photo of two Palestinian policemen holding aloft a 
poster of Clinton and Arafat. Dicks said he was proud to be in Bethlehem 
for the seasonal celebrations this year. ``I'm proud that (Clinton) 
is coming to make peace and push the peace forward,'' he said. ``I 
think it's the right message.''
