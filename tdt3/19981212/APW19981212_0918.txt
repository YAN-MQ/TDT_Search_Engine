Germany's Dariusz Michalczewski Saturday ended a hard challenge to 
his WBO light heavyweight title with a sudden ninth-round combination 
that sent American Drake Thadzi staggering across the ring. The hard 
left and right to the head seemed to come out of nowhere, ending a 
tough fight for the unbeaten Polish-born fighter, who had been rocked 
himself in the second round. U.S. referee Louis Moret immediately 
ended the bout at 1:22 minutes into the round while Thadzi righted 
himself on the ropes. His decision drew boos from the spectators. 
But the IBO light heavyweight champion's corner didn't complain, nor 
did Thadzi _ at first. ``I was a little off _ but next time will be 
a different story,'' said Thadzi, now 30-9-1. ``But he did break off 
the fight too early. It wasn't a one-sided fight.'' Michalczewski 
14th defense of his crown was being billed locally as a record for 
a light heavyweight. Michalczewski, known for spectacular endings 
to his bouts, ran his record to 39-0 with 32 knockouts. Many of his 
fights have ended with a single shot by his left. Michalczewski also 
challenged Roy Jones Jr., the WBA-WBC light heavyweight champion, 
sometimes called the best boxer in the world. ``I want him. I'll even 
go to America,'' said Michalczewski. ``It's time he takes a stand.'' 
Michalczewski became the first man in history to own the WBO, IBF 
and WBA titles at the same time after he beat Virgil Hill two years 
ago. He also once won the WBO cruiserweight title. Thadzi, the IBO 
light heavyweight champion, had stunned Michalczewski in the second 
round, crowding the German and tagging him with one fierce uppercut 
after another. Michalczewski didn't fare much better in the third 
round, but then finally backed up Thadzi by exploding a left to the 
head midway through the fourth round. By the eighth round, Michalczewski 
was back in form and with enough room to continually slip hard lefts 
to the head through the tiring Thadzi's gloves. ``You have to put 
on a little show, but I felt super good the whole fight,'' Michalczewski 
said. ``But he was tough.'' But he also displayed some old faults 
like dropping his left hand. ``I don't want to take anything away 
from him, but there are tougher opponents,'' said Thadzi, who has 
fought numerous top fighters. On the undercard, unbeaten Cuban fighter 
Juan Carlos Gomez retained his WBC cruiserwight title by knocking 
out American Rodney Gordon in the second round. Gomez, who fled Cuba 
for Germany two years, caught the American with 2:19 remaining in 
the round with a left hook. He also dropped the American with the 
blow in the opening round. Gomez, 26-0 with 22 knockouts, was making 
the third defense of the crown he won Feb. 21 against Argentina's 
Marcelo Dominguez. Gordon was taken to a hospital afterwards to be 
treated for a head injury.
