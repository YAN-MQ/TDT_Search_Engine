Leaving their headquarters at different times, U.N. inspectors headed 
out Saturday on one of their last missions in the current round of 
search for Iraq's illegal weapons. At least five 4-wheel drive cars, 
carrying the experts of the United Nations Special Commission and 
their Iraqi escorts, left the U.N. headquarters. ``Our inspectors 
have gone out on their normal daily duties,'' UNSCOM spokeswoman Caroline 
Cross said. She refused to say where or what type of inspections will 
take place. Unconfirmed reports said that the teams will on Saturday 
visit sensitive sites such as the defense industry's headquarters 
or offices related to national security. UNSCOM or Iraqi government 
officials did not comment on the report. The inspectors must certify 
that Iraq has dismantled its chemical, biological and nuclear programs 
and long-range missiles. Until then, the U.N. Security Council will 
not lift an oil embargo and other sanctions it imposed after Iraq 
invaded Kuwait in 1990. This week's searches, which are expected to 
end Monday, have been the most intensive since Iraq allowed UNSCOM 
to resume work last month after putting a halt in August. Iraq backed 
down only hours before the United States had planned to launch military 
strikes on Nov. 14. President Saddam Hussein's government also pledged 
full cooperation to the inspectors, and the latest searches are seen 
as a test of that. The inspections had proceeded smoothly this week 
until a 12-member team was turned away from a ruling Baath Party office 
on Wednesday. But the dispute hasn't escalated. Neither the Iraqis 
nor the U.N. inspectors have spoken of any bid to return to the building. 
A party leader, however, said Thursday that even if the inspectors 
return they will be turned back as the party building is a private 
property. The U.N. inspectors say they have the right under U.N. resolutions 
to examine any site in Iraq without conditions. U.S. Secretary of 
State Madeleine Albright warned Iraq Friday that if it did not honor 
its promise to cooperate with U.N. inspectors, ``the military option 
remains on the table.'' But Albright told reporters in Washington 
that the United States was reserving judgment until Butler files his 
report on Iraqi cooperation to the U.N. secretary-general early next 
week.
