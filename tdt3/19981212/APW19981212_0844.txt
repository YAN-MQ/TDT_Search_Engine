In a perfect Christmas present for family and friends, a senior United 
Nations aid worker arrived home Saturday after 318 days in the hands 
of violent kidnappers in southern Russia. Vincent Cochetel was freed 
by Russian security forces in a two-minute commando operation before 
dawn, which was carried on television. The 37-year-old French national 
was said to be emotionally and physically exhausted but otherwise 
in good health. He was taken to hospital for medical checks immediately 
after his arrival at Geneva airport. Cochetel headed the office of 
the U.N. High Commissioner for Refugees in the North Ossetia region. 
He was seized by three masked gunmen in the regional capital Vladikavkaz 
on Jan. 29. ``All the family is completely overwhelmed,'' said his 
father, Alain, who flew in from Paris for a tearful reunion. ``It's 
the best Christmas present ever,'' sighed his mother, Madeleine, _ 
a comment echoed repeatedly by family and colleagues. ``But, Mummy, 
it isn't even Christmas yet,'' his six-year-old daughter, Sarah, said 
when told of the news by her mother, Florence. The couple also have 
a seven-year-old daughter Salome. Family members said they alternated 
between hope and despair in the ten months without news of Vincent. 
One of the worst moments was four days ago when the severed heads 
of four murdered foreign hostages were found in Chechnya, they said. 
The four were apparently killed after a government rescue attempt 
went wrong. In footage of the release operation broadcast by Russia's 
NTV television station, Cochetel kneeled and crouched behind a white 
van, his hands in metal hand-cuffs behind his back. Russian security 
officers in masks and camouflage stood over him protectively, then 
dragged him away as gunfire erupted and bullets bounced off the van. 
Cochetel said that for the first two months, ``there was a lot of 
violence, they were interrogating me and that was all very serious,'' 
Russia's Interfax news agency reported. He said that for the past 
several months, he had been kept almost completely in the dark. ``Twenty 
minutes of daylight every single day, that's very hard,'' Interfax 
quoted him as saying. He called for his kidnappers to be brought to 
justice. ``I know who is responsible for my kidnapping,'' Cochetel 
said, according to Interfax. ``I believe there must be a court trial. 
If there is no trial, the process of kidnapping people will continue.'' 
Since Chechnya's two-year war of independence against Russia ended 
in 1996, hundreds of people have been kidnapped in the breakaway republic 
and neighboring regions by armed gangs who are mostly motivated by 
ransom. Dozens of people are currently held captive. Chechnya's top 
prosecutor Mansur Tagirov, who was investigating the killings and 
was apparently kidnapped Thursday, was also released Saturday, Interfax 
said. French President Jacques Chirac, who had personally lobbied 
his Russian counterpart Boris Yeltsin for the release, phoned him 
to thank him for Russia's role in the rescue operation. U.N. High 
Commissioner for Refugees, Sadako Ogata, said the ordeal proved the 
need for more protection for aid workers in the world's trouble spots. 
UNHCR and the French government consistently ruled out paying a ransom. 
The family hugged silently when Cochetel stepped off the plane from 
Moscow, too overwhelmed to speak, said his father Alain. As Cochetel 
left with doctors, he vowed to stay closer to home in future, he said. 
Mother Madeleine said he looked very tired, and had aged because of 
the stress of captivity. ``Above all, I was struck by his big beard,'' 
she said.
