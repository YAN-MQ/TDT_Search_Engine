aye. aye. A fourth and final article of impeachment has been passed 
by the house judiciary committee, but republicans are saying no to 
censure, because it isn't tough enough on the president. Future presidents 
who lie repeatedly under oath will be looking over their shoulder. 
And I would like for them to be looking over their shoulder. Nothing 
about this process has been nonpartisan, nothing about this process 
has been fair to the American people. With his presidency in peril, 
Mr. Clinton has tonight landed in a perilous place. A four-day trip 
to the Middle East is under way, at a very dangerous Time. broadcasting
