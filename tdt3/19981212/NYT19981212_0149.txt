They are the only coaches in pro football who receive as much attention 
as the teams they run. ``This isn't about me and Jimmy Johnson,'' 
the Jets' Bill Parcells told the news media as he prepared _ or rather 
got his team to prepare _ to face the Dolphins Sunday night. Parcells 
was suddenly so retiring that he even said that he had posed for a 
picture for Sports Illustrated only on the condition that they not 
put him on its cover. When they did, he said the magazine had broken 
a promise. Indeed, try as he might, it has been impossible to deflect 
attention from these two commanding coaches. From out of the ruins 
of a 1-15 record in 1996, Parcells has prodded the Jets into playoff 
contention, with a 9-4 record and a share of first place with the 
Dolphins in the American Conference East Division. And Johnson has 
turned the Dolphins almost upside down, stamped them in his image, 
brought in younger players, and energized them again. First he did 
it with the Tom Landry's Cowboys; now he has done it with Don Shula's 
Dolphins. No wonder these are two coaches with tremendous respect 
for each other. Parcells recognized Johnson's talents in his first 
woeful season in leading the Cowboys to a 1-15 record in 1989. ``I 
told other people that he was a good coach,'' Parcells recalled. Three 
years later, when Parcells was out of football and Johnson's Cowboys 
were 3-1 early in the season, Johnson asked Parcells for advice on 
how to prepare for Super Bowl week. That is how confident Johnson 
was, and how much respect he had for Parcells. How could the two have 
known then that they would become dominant figures in another conference 
_ one that symbolized a different brand of football but now, with 
New England and Buffalo only a game behind the Jets and the Dolphins, 
features the tightest four-team race in the National Football League? 
In Parcells' nearly two seasons at the Jets' controls, they have produced 
the same record as the Dolphins: 18-11. The Jets' record over the 
span is even better than the Patriots' team Parcells left after 1996. 
New England is 17-12. A Jets victory against the Dolphins would send 
them into the playoffs for the first time since 1991. It would also 
put them in this favorable position: they would need to win only one 
of the two final games to capture their first division championship 
since they were in the American Football League back in 1969. Johnson 
and Parcells were once the crowned heads of the National Conference 
East, which seems like a generation ago. Each won a pair of Super 
Bowls. Then Johnson battled Jerry Jones in Dallas and went into television. 
He was coaxed back into coaching when the Dolphins' owner, Wayne Huizenga, 
gave him complete control of the team in 1996, along with the league's 
highest coaching-general manager salary of $2 million a year. Parcells 
chafed under the restrictions he endured at New England. He had joined 
the Patriots after having gone into television following his second 
Super Bowl victory with the Giants. But Parcells lost the total control 
he had been promised; the team was sold to Robert Kraft. The Jets 
offered him everything he wanted, and gave him even more money than 
Johnson, at $2.4 million. Both Johnson and Parcells have been concerned 
with the push and pull that coaching had on their lives. Parcells 
gave up coaching the Giants, in part, because of health concerns. 
He has had three heart procedures in the 1990s. During his television 
days, Johnson once recalled: ``When I was coaching, I had a very difficult 
time handling a loss, a difficult time breaking away. I lived three 
blocks from the office, and every day I was in town, I was there. 
Winning football games was what I thought about when I went to bed 
and when I woke up.'' Keith Byars is in the rare position of having 
played for both coaches. Now the Jets' fullback, Byars played briefly 
under Johnson before being cut after four games in 1996. Byars has 
refused to talk about Johnson, saying with a smile, ``It'll be in 
my book.'' But before this game and this clash between coaches and 
teams, Byars reflected on life under both. ``Both coaches say, `I 
need you to get to the other side of the wall,''' Byars said. ``Jimmy 
will say, `Go through the wall to get to the other side.' Bill will 
say, `Through the wall over the wall, under the wall, around the wall, 
just make sure you're on the other side by 12 o'clock.' With Jimmy 
it's, `There's no other way.' Bill is more adaptable than people give 
him credit for.'' The Jets' punter, John Kidd, has also played for 
both men. He is the Dolphins' record-holder for highest career punting 
average. ``As far as their philosophy in running a team, basics, discipline, 
no-excuses, get the job done or get out _ it's the same,'' Kidd said. 
``Both guys are perceived by fans as being gruff, intimidating. People 
see them on television. But both of them have very positive personalities. 
Jimmy allows himself to be happier. ``The noticeable difference to 
me is this team, with guys from New England and Pepper Johnson from 
the Giants. There's a sense of loyalty. We just didn't get a lot of 
guys from Dallas. I don't know what that means.'' Kidd himself was 
cut by the Dolphins earlier this season because, he believes, ``I 
missed two weeks of training camp and with Jimmy's way of doing things, 
if you miss camp, you're in trouble.'' But perhaps the most succinct 
assessment of the two was given last year by a place-kicker named 
Joe Nedney, who had just been cut by the Dolphins and was given a 
tryout with the Jets. Asked what it was like to go from Johnson to 
Parcells, he said, ``Like going to a parallel universe.''
