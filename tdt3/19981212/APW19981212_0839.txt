President Boris Yeltsin passionately defended Russia's 5-year-old 
constitution on Saturday, saying it acts as a barrier to those who 
want to return the country to its communist past. The communist-led 
opposition has been increasingly insistent in its calls for changes 
to the constitution, which it criticizes as allowing strong presidential 
powers to the detriment of other branches of government. Presidential 
spokesman Dmitry Yakushkin said in October that Yeltsin had agreed 
to have an expert commission consider changes to the constitution. 
On Saturday, however, the president urged extreme caution in modifying 
the document, so ``the foundations of Russia's legal structure would 
not be destroyed.'' The constitution ``stands in the way of those 
who sow enmity and national dissension, those who cannot abide a free 
press, who try to deny us our rights to private property and the free 
market,'' Yeltsin told legislators, government officials and other 
dignitaries at a Kremlin reception. Yeltsin looked fit after close 
to three weeks' convalescence following a bout with pneumonia. He 
spoke strongly, clearly, and with feeling. ``(The constitution) has 
helped preserve stability more than once over these past five years. 
It has led us out of political crises more than once. And it has upheld 
citizens' rights and freedoms more than once,'' he said in a speech 
broadcast in part on Russian television. The president made many of 
the same points in a radio address that aired Saturday morning. The 
constitution was passed by referendum on December 12, 1993. Yeltsin 
effectively designed the document for himself, putting the president 
in a position to call all the shots and giving little real power to 
parliament or the prime minister. Yeltsin's recent series of illnesses, 
his general retreat from public view since an economic crisis hit 
in mid-August and a clear transfer of the reins of government to Prime 
Minister Yevgeny Primakov have prompted speculation that it may be 
time to amend the constitution. Yet Yeltsin made it clear Saturday 
that he would not accept a big increase in the parliament's authority. 
``They are calling for vesting parliament with all possible powers. 
They are effectively proposing that the country revert to being a 
republic of soviets,'' Yeltsin said, referring to the councils that 
governed the Soviet Union along with the Communist Party.
