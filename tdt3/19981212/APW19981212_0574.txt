A French United Nations official who was kidnapped in southern Russia 
more than 10 months ago was set free Saturday and flown to Moscow, 
the first stop on his journey back to U.N. headquarters in Geneva. 
Vincent Cochetel, 37, who headed the office of the U.N. High Commissioner 
for Refugees in the North Ossetia region, was seized by three masked 
gunmen in the regional capital Vladikavkaz on Jan. 29. Cochetel was 
freed about two minutes into the predawn operation, but a longer firefight 
erupted between the kidnappers and Russian security forces, the Interfax 
news agency said. Cochetel was unharmed, but he said three of the 
kidnappers had been killed, Interfax reported. Two security officers 
were slightly injured during the operation, Interior Ministry spokesman 
Alexander Mikhailov said, according to the ITAR-Tass news agency. 
No ransom was paid for Cochetel's release, Mikhailov said. Cochetel 
was flown aboard a chartered jet to Moscow, where he was met by French 
Ambassador Hubert Colin de Verdiere and U.N. officials. He was to 
leave Saturday evening for Geneva, where his family and colleagues 
were awaiting him at U.N. headquarters, said Vera Sobolyeva, UNHCR 
spokeswoman in Moscow. Speaking briefly to reporters, Cochetel thanked 
Russian President Boris Yeltsin and other officials who made his release 
possible. ``It is the first time people have risked their lives for 
me,'' said Cochetel, who had grown a bushy beard during his more than 
10 months in captivity. Cochetel said that for the first two months, 
``there was a lot of violence, they were interrogating me and that 
was all very serious,'' Interfax reported. He said that for the past 
several months, he had been kept almost completely in the dark. ``Twenty 
minutes of daylight every single day, that's very hard,'' Interfax 
quoted him as saying. He called for his kidnappers to be brought to 
justice. ``I know who is responsible for my kidnapping,'' Cochetel 
said, according to Interfax. ``I believe there must be a court trial. 
If there is no trial, the process of kidnapping people will continue.'' 
Since Chechnya's two-year war of independence against Russia ended 
in 1996, hundreds of people have been kidnapped in the breakaway republic 
and neighboring regions by armed gangs who are mostly motivated by 
ransom. Dozens of people are currently held captive. Cochetel's release 
came four days after the severed heads of four murdered foreign hostages 
were found in Chechnya. The four _ Britons Peter Kennedy, Darren Hickey, 
and Rudolf Petschi, and Stanley Shaw of New Zealand _ were killed 
after a government rescue attempt apparently went wrong. Chechnya's 
top prosecutor Mansur Tagirov, who was investigating the killings 
and was apparently kidnapped Thursday, was also released Saturday, 
Interfax said. At UNHCR's Moscow office, Sobolyeva celebrated Cochetel's 
release by tearing down the ``Free Vincent!'' poster that has hung 
over her desk since the kidnapping. ``We couldn't imagine a better 
Christmas present than to have him back,'' UNHCR spokesman Judith 
Kumin said in Geneva. ``He's had a shower and is beginning to unwind 
from a year's ordeal.'' French President Jacques Chirac spoke to Yeltsin 
by telephone and thanked him for Russia's part in freeing Cochetel, 
the Kremlin press service said.
