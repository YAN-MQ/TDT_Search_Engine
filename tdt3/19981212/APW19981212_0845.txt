A French U.N. official held captive in southern Russia for more than 
10 months was set free by Russian security forces Saturday and flown 
to Geneva for a reunion with his family and colleagues. Vincent Cochetel, 
head of the office of the U.N. High Commissioner for Refugees in the 
North Ossetia region, was seized by three masked gunmen on Jan. 29 
in the regional capital Vladikavkaz. He was freed in a predawn operation 
on the border between the republics of Chechnya and Ingushetia, but 
a firefight broke out between the kidnappers and Russian security 
forces, the Interfax news agency said. Cochetel, 37, was unharmed; 
he said three kidnappers were killed. In footage of the operation 
broadcast by Russia's NTV television station, Cochetel was shown kneeling 
and crouching behind a white van, his hands cuffed behind his back. 
Russian security officers in masks and camouflage stood over him protectively, 
then dragged him away as gunfire erupted and bullets bounced off the 
van. Two security officers were slightly injured, Interior Ministry 
spokesman Alexander Mikhailov said, according to the ITAR-Tass news 
agency. No ransom was paid for Cochetel's release, Mikhailov said. 
Cochetel was flown aboard a chartered jet to Moscow, where he was 
met by French Ambassador Hubert Colin de Verdiere and U.N. officials. 
He left Saturday evening for Geneva, where his family and colleagues 
were awaiting him at U.N. headquarters, said Vera Sobolyeva, UNHCR 
spokeswoman in Moscow. Speaking briefly to reporters, Cochetel thanked 
President Boris Yeltsin and other officials who made his release possible. 
``It is the first time people have risked their lives for me,'' he 
said. Cochetel said that for the first two months, ``there was a lot 
of violence, they were interrogating me and that was all very serious,'' 
Interfax reported. For the past several months, he had been kept almost 
completely in the dark, he said. ``Twenty minutes of daylight every 
single day, that's very hard,'' Interfax quoted him as saying. Cochetel 
also said he knew who was responsible for his kidnapping and called 
for the abductors to be brought to justice, Interfax reported. ``I 
believe there must be a court trial,'' he said. ``If there is no trial, 
the process of kidnapping people will continue.'' Since Chechnya's 
two-year war of independence against Russia ended in 1996, hundreds 
of people have been kidnapped in the breakaway republic and neighboring 
regions by gangs who are mostly motivated by ransom. Dozens of people 
are currently held captive. Cochetel's release came four days after 
the severed heads of four hostages were found in Chechnya. The four 
were killed after a government rescue attempt apparently went wrong. 
Chechnya's top prosecutor Mansur Tagirov, who was investigating the 
killings and was apparently kidnapped Thursday, was released Saturday, 
Interfax said.
