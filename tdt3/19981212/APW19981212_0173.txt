Former world match-play snooker champion James Wattana may put his 
battered psyche in the spotlight again Sunday after deciding to join 
Thailand in the team competition at the Asian Games. Wattana, a former 
world No. 3-ranked player who has spent a decade as a snooker pro, 
was expected to win three golds for the hosts at the games. Instead, 
it has been a soap opera story, full of tears, breakups and reunions. 
The tears followed a humiliating defeat early in the singles competition. 
The breakup came when his team missed out on a medal in the doubles 
and he told reporters he was playing too badly to continue at the 
games. But a few hours after deciding he would quit the team, Wattana 
seemingly reconsidered, and unless he changes his mind again he should 
line up in the team's event. The games were expected to be a triumph 
for Wattana, who rose near the summit of his sport before tumbling 
down the rankings over the past year. His inability to stand the pressure 
of pleasing his fans has been surprising, not least to himself. Wattana 
and his mother gave tearful news conferences after he lost his singles 
match 5-1 to Hong Kong's Chan Kwok-ming and he was near tears again 
after he and partner Chuchart Trairatanapradit lost the bronze medal 
game. ``The pressure has been unbelievable, the worst I have ever 
felt,'' Wattana said after losing the doubles. ``I have no confidence 
in my game, I cannot pot a thing, I just don't know what's wrong.'' 
Wattana said he would withdraw from the teams competition but then 
reversed his decision, making himself available. Thailand's team manager 
Thirachai Vuthitham had not declared his starting team Saturday.
