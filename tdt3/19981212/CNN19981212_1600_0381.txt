Two astronauts from the space shuttle "endeavour" are embarking on 
the third and final spacewalk to work on the international space station. 
First, they'll install a tool box outside the space station. Later, 
they'll test a jet backpack that would help an astronaut who was knocked 
clear of the station fly back to safety. At the end of the 6 1/2 hour 
walk, the astronauts will take detailed pictures of the space station. 
"Endeavour" is scheduled to return to earth Tuesday.
