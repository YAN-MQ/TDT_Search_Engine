The Judiciary committee hearings are the first formal step toward 
impeachment. Charles Bierbauer outlines the rest of the process. Articles 
of impeachment will be considered next Thursday. I think it's in the 
interest of the country to finish it. That means a busy weekend of 
preparing majority and minority briefs on each article of impeachment 
before the house which would otherwise be Fu initiatived for this 
term regroups. There are a few standing rules. The house has only 
faced it if the house votes to impeach, the Senate is called on to 
try the impeachment. The Senate is required to begin the trial the 
day after the house notifies its readyness T 106th Congress convenes 
January 6. a trial could start as early as January 11. The house appoints 
managers who act as prosecutors. The president himself is not compeled 
to attend. His lawyers or members of Congress may defend him. The 
Senate, a jury of 100, is required to be mute. One of the more interesting 
phenomena would be to see how the senators manage a Burden of silence. 
The trial could produce an array of witnesses. Be prepared to turn 
on your TV and watch the chief justice of the Supreme Court swear 
in Lucy Ann Goldberg, Linda Tripp, endless testimony in front of the 
whole world. The chief justice would preside over the Senate. Some 
democrats suggest a trial would paralyze both the Senate and the Supreme 
Court. It Ned not. We have our oral arguments scheduled disturbance 
the mornings or weeks in which we hear arguments. It's my understanding 
that should there ab necessity for the Senate to hear the impeachment, 
if there is an impeachment, that the Senate would not meet until 1:00 
each day. It's just a short midday stroll for the chief justice from 
the Supreme Court to the Senate chamber. That hour may be closer at 
hand than anyone may have thought possible when the Monica Lewinsky 
scandal broke a year ago or even a week ago when there were still 
doubts the house could Senate articles of impeachment. Charles Bierbauer, 
CNN.
