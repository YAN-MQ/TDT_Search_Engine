In many ways, the FBI's file on Frank Sinatra, released last week, 
said as much about the agency as it did about the singer. The descriptions 
of his effect on teen-age girls were particularly intriguing, as they 
shed light on the mindset of the G-man of 50 years ago. So disturbed 
was one agent, L.B. Nichols, by the rapture of the bobby-soxers that 
he recorded these observations on May 14, 1946. _ IRVIN MOLOTSKY `` 
As a symptom of the state of mind of many young people, I wish to 
call to your attention the following incident that occurred in Detroit 
last Wednesday. Frank Sinatra arrived in Detroit around midnight and 
a group of bobby-soxers were waiting for him at the airfield. He eluded 
them and they then congregated at the stage door of the Downtown Theater 
where he was scheduled to give his first performance around 10:00 
a.m. on Thursday morning. The line started forming at around 2:00 
a.m. The police started challenging girls who appeared to be under 
16 and tried to send them home. However, I have been told there was 
a long line of mere kids, many of whom carried their lunches, and 
they remained in line until the theater opened. Truant Officers started 
checking the lines early in the morning and were berated by the girls. 
There was widespread indignation on the part of numerous individuals 
that I came in contact with and a severe indictment of the parents 
of the girls. One individual went so far as to state that Sinatra 
should be lynched. . . .'' In a note, FBI Director J. Edgar Hoover 
offered this thought: ``Sinatra is as much to blame as the moronic 
bobby-soxers.''
