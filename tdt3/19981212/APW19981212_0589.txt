Austria's Andreas Widhoelzl leaped to victory Saturday at a Ski Jumping 
World Cup cut to one dangerous attempt because of thick fog and gusting 
winds. Widhoelzl soared 127.5 meters and was awarded 130.5 points 
to beat the overall World Cup leader, Martin Schmitt, after the second 
jump was cancelled. The German leaped 122 meters for 120.6 points. 
Many competitors complained about the dangerous conditions after going 
airborne in fog so thick they were a blur to spectators and TV cameras. 
``That was pushing the borders of the acceptable,'' said Schmitt, 
who has dominated this season with four World Cup event triumphs. 
``I'm doubly happy. I came down in one piece and made a good jump. 
But I could by laying in the hospital,'' said Schmitt, who landed 
headfirst Friday during a practice leap. Germany's Sven Hannawald 
took third with a jump of 119.7 and 121.5 meters, followed by Austrians 
Wolfgang Loitzl and Stefan Horngacher. ``It was totally difficult 
today, right on the border. One almost couldn't see where you were 
jumping,'' said Hornbacher. Kazuyoshi Funaki of Japan, the double 
gold medal winner at Nagano, finished 15th. He remains third in the 
overall standings with 346 points, behind Schmitt at 540 and Finland's 
Janne Ahonen at 408. The triumph of Widhoelzl, double bronze winner 
at Nagano, snapped a winless streak of 12 events for the Austrian 
jumpers. ``I was surprised myself because I haven't been able to bring 
my training performances into competition,'' said Widhoelzl, who agreed 
the second jump should have been cancelled because of conditions. 
Some competitors, such as Germany's Dieter Thoma, had announced they 
would drop out of the event even before the second attempt was officially 
cancelled. The tour veteran finished 20th with a leap of 102 meters. 
``That was flying blind. I've already had one bad accident in fog 
and don't have to do that to myself again,'' Thoma said. The ski jumping 
World Cup will continue Sunday at Oberhof, where rain is also predicted. 
German coach Reinhard Hess described the event as ``without worth'' 
because of the irregular conditions. The Norwegian jumper, Kristian 
Brenden, was also released from the hospital after taking a bad fall 
during practice Friday.
