BRISTOL, Conn. _ ESPN's satellite dishes line one of the main roads 
like a dealership for pre-owned flying saucers, but here in the armchair-quarterback 
capital of America, residents are as wary as the rest of their Connecticut 
neighbors about the state's plan to build a stadium for the New England 
Patriots. At Gold's Gym, next door to the sports network's headquarters, 
four football fans who work in construction had so many objections 
to the plan that they kept interrupting each other to point out their 
favorite flaws. ``What happens in 10 years when the Patriots stink 
and the seats don't sell?'' asked Barry Ziegler, 24, as he pulled 
the pin on the lateral-pull machine and notched it up to 230 pounds. 
``I'll be able to get any seat I want _ and I'll have to pay for it 
twice.'' For Ziegler and for many others, the potential taxpayer liability 
is the most irksome part of the proposal, which is scheduled for a 
vote at a special session of the General Assembly on Tuesday. Several 
polls have indicated that, by wide margins, Connecticut residents 
approve of bringing the Patriots to Hartford but believe the state 
made too sweet an offer to the team's owner, Robert Kraft. Gov. John 
Rowland conceded last week that his tentative agreement might have 
been too generous, and he met with Kraft at the Capitol until 8:30 
Friday night, trying to revise the deal. Legislative leaders are adamant 
that they will hold a vote on Tuesday. They are said to fear that 
a delay could erode support for the deal. Ziegler said he makes about 
$35,000 a year as the owner of a remodeling business. He spent Friday 
hauling 72-pound bundles of shingles up a ladder as part of a three-day 
job. ``Let Kraft do a roof,'' Ziegler said. ``When I get off the roof, 
my back kills, and part of it is going to that millionaire.'' That 
Robert Kraft is a household name in small-town Connecticut is a tribute 
to Patriots fever. Some Hartford television and radio stations accompany 
their updates with stirring theme music and ``Patriot Games'' logos. 
People are surprisingly familiar with the minutiae of the proposal, 
which would put the state on the hook for as much as $17.5 million 
a year if luxury suites and seats went unsold. It is these guarantees, 
much more than the $375 million construction cost and 30-year, rent-free 
lease, that seem to be stirring resentment. State Rep. Roger Michele, 
D-Bristol, a barber, says his customers and constituents are 100-1 
against the stadium proposal's current terms. ``People instinctively 
sense that there are going to be a lot of hidden costs,'' he said. 
``If Rowland got this deal after long, hard negotiations, they wonder 
what the first offer was.'' Bristol, a city of 62,000, is about 18 
miles southwest of Hartford and eight miles from Interstate 84. It 
remains largely blue-collar despite the 40-acre, 1,700-employee ESPN 
campus. Bristol is also home to the eastern region headquarters of 
Little League Baseball Inc., and residents say the city is sports-crazy, 
partly because of its huge youth sports leagues. City Council members 
and officials of the Bristol Chamber of Commerce plan to make a pitch 
for a training center that the Patriots have agreed to build in Connecticut 
_ at a cost to the state of $15 million. Nevertheless, unabashed boosters 
of the Patriots deal are as rare as shuffleboard highlights on ``SportsCenter.'' 
At Gold's Gym, one of Ziegler's workout partners, Kevin Herrick, 21, 
scoffed at state officials' claim that they need to budget no money 
to widen Hartford highways, even though the contract guarantees that 
the state will be sure the parking lot can clear in one hour. ``I 
drive in there all the time, and it's always crowded, even though 
right now there's nothing in Hartford,'' Herrick said. At Rock's Sports 
Cards, workers reported a run on requests for Drew Bledsoe, the Patriots' 
quarterback. But Mike Bakaysa, 53, a siding contractor, said Kraft 
should be making more of an investment. ``Rowland panicked and offered 
him the moon,'' Bakaysa said. Two miles down Middle Street from ESPN, 
pool players at the Chalker's Choice sports bar saw the deal's bright 
side. Adam Dube, 21, a carpenter, said he agrees with Rowland that 
the stadium could be a catalyst for a Hartford comeback. ``People 
think of Hartford as a slum place,'' he said. ``I haven't been there 
in 10 years.'' And Christa Singleton, a 26-year-old bartender, has 
paid the team's $25 deposit for a spot on the season-ticket waiting 
list. At the holiday party of the Carousel Museum of New England, 
on Bristol's Riverside Avenue, supporters were serenaded by a string 
quartet as they admired the collection of 75 painted ponies. Vicki 
Giovanniello, 75, a retired accountant, said visions of the major 
leagues seem to have blinded backers of the stadium. ``Ten years from 
now, we may be trying to figure out how to bail ourselves out.''
