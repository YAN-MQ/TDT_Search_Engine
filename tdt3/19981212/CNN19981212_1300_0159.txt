Before the Judiciary committee began voting on the articles of impeachment 
yesterday, President Clinton made another attempt at an apology. It 
was designed to win over undecided republicans. Bob Franken looks 
at the results. The president's remarks were designed to persuade 
undecided republicans to vote against impeachment. It may have backfired. 
I was terribly disappointed. What we needed from the president was 
an admission, not contrition. It's time the president admitted he 
broke the law. Franks wasn't alone. New Jersey's Rodney Frelinghuysen 
was one. An aide said flatly -- "the president's speech confirms his 
decision". And more bad news for the president -- republican leaders 
telegraphing clear signals that censure is unlikely to be an option. 
Sources tell CNN incoming speaker Bob Livingston told White House 
chief of staff John Podesta that leaders aren't inclined to allow 
a floor vote on censure. Publicly, Livingston does not want to be 
drawn into the particulars of the debate, he's keeping his distance. 
Obviously, censure will come up in committee. But I intend to make 
up my mind about the procedure on the floor and make my recommendations 
to the current speaker on the basis of what I see in the report. The 
White House is pushing every button. It's carefully working house 
members who are still undecided. They said if I wanted to talk to 
the president's lawyers, if I had questions, they would connect me 
with them. I told them I did not have questions, and that if I did, 
I would call them back. Friends of the White House are lending a hand. 
This is too important to allow somebody to go in to vote without at 
least hearing from all sides and hearing every single argument. Lobbying 
on such a weighty constitutional matter is tricky business. Tom korologos 
is a veteran GOP lobbyist who worked Capitol Hill during the nixon 
impeachment. You can't give away a highway for an impeachment vote, 
so it's very sensitive. But it's the ultimate vote count. It's the 
ultimate request for a vote. There are indications that the president 
is still struggling. More and more are saying that the White House 
efforts seem increasingly desperate. Bob Franken, CNN, Capitol Hill.
