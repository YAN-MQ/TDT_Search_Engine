With the prospects of an impeachment trial drawing closer to reality, 
President Clinton delivered his most definitive apology Friday. In 
an effort to win over undecided republicans, he expressed remorse 
for his actions in the Monica Lewinsky matter and said he was prepared 
to accept public condemnation. The public consequences of my actions 
are in the hands of the American people and their representatives 
in the Congress. Should they determine that my errors in word and 
deed require their rebuke and censure, I am ready to accept that. 
Meanwhile, I will continue to do all I can to reclaim the trust of 
the american people and to serve them well. The committee should finish 
voting on the articles of impeachment this weekend. Democrats also 
hope to debate a censure motion. The full house should take up the 
matter Thursday, with a vote coming by the end of next week.
