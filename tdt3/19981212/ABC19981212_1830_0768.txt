President Clinton landed tonight in Israel as he begins a visit that 
will also take him to the West Bank and Gaza. The president trying 
to save the wye peace agreement he brokered in october. But as ABC's 
Gillian Findlay reports, it looks like an uphill fight. President 
Clinton's trip was to have been a celebration of the peace deal. But 
for weeks now, there has been little peace here. The deal is officially 
on hold. Again today, Israeli soldiers battled Palestinian protesters, 
again over the issue of releasing Palestinian prisoners. There was 
even violence in Bethlehem, where President Clinton is scheduled to 
tour next week. The clashes are what prompted Israel to freeze the 
peace deal two weeks ago. The president will try to convince Israel's 
prime minister to restart it, but it won't be easy. Benjamin Netanyahu's 
government is in danger of being defeated in a Critical vote next 
week if he doesn't win back support of hardliners opposed to the deal. 
What the hardline thinks about Mr. Clinton's visit is clear. The last 
thing Netanyahu needs right now is a U.S. president pressuring him 
to do more. Netanyahu is feeling between a rock and a hard place. 
On one hand, having the president here. On the other hand, he has 
the Knesset people saying, "if you do anything, we'll pull the plug." 
By contrast, the people of Gaza seem genuinely excited about the president's 
visit. They see it as an endorsement of their right to a Palestinian 
state. But here, too, Mr. Clinton could be walking into a minefield. 
Two years ago, the Palestinian's top legislative body voted to cancel 
clauses in their charter, calling for Israel's destruction. Mr. Netanyahu 
has never been satisfied with that and wants the council to vote again, 
this time with President Clinton watching. The Palestinians say they 
won't. On Israeli TV last night, Mr. Netanyahu said, "no vote, no 
peace deal." All of which does not bode well for the kind of successful 
foreign trip Mr. clinton could use right now. But tonight there was 
some encouragement on the old city walls across from the president's 
hotel, this message. Despite the political problems, the majority 
of Israelis and Palestinians still want peace. Gillian Findlay, Jerusalem.
