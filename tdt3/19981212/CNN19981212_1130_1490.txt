You might not know their names, but you've probably heard from them. 
Some of the best percussionists in pop music got together to drum 
up support for those with disabling injuries. Paul Vercammen reports. 
Members of this drum circle of friends have played with elite music 
acts. Luis Conte, Madonna, James Taylor. Walfredo Reyes Jr., Santana, 
Steve Winwood, tris embodan, Chicago. They showed unity unique to 
percussionists. Maybe it's because there are so many drummers jokes. 
They're always taking shots at us. These all-stars rallied around 
a cause -- a belief that drumming can help sufferers of debilitating 
injuries. It's just a beautiful thing, the sound of it. So it must 
-- it's good for your brain, for everything, you know, it makes you 
relax. And they rallied around a colleague, drummer and organizer 
Eddie tuduri. I've been on some benefits where some musicians are 
trying to get it off the ground. And as soon as Eddie tuduri stepped 
in, it happened in a big way. Tuduri cheated death and paralysis after 
breaking his neck while body surfing more than a year ago in these 
waters. I love the ocean. I've always loved the ocean. I'm not angry 
because the ocean has taken maybe something from me. But what's its 
given me in return is a hundred fold. The accident gave tuduri an 
idea that he and other patients at santa Barbara's rehabilitation 
institute could get needed exercise and improve their lives through 
drumming. So he put together a rhythm therapy program and this fund-raiser 
for the clinic. So how does rhythm therapy work? Mainly, because it's 
a pleasant distraction from the grueling process of rehabilitation. 
Some of the therapy is very needed, very necessary. But it's tedious, 
and even painful. This isn't painful. It awakens something in here. 
Em kull suffered a stroke. It gives you a shot in the arm, that you 
don't get other times. Tuduri himself exemplifies this power of positive 
thumping. Paul Vercammen, "CNN Entertainment News," Santa Barbara.
