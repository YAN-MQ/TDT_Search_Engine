After slipping into a deep coma on Friday, Joe DiMaggio continues 
to make great strides. The doctors are calling his improvement unbelievable. 
He clearly has no fever. I is away. He's alert. We temporarily took 
off the ventilator and cuffed the tube and he, I said, joe, say hello. 
He said, hello, in a very distinct voice. He follows commands. He's 
pretty much with it.
