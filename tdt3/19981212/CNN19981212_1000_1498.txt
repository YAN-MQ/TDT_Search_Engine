Many people equate the song "Moon river" with the name mancini -- 
as in henry, the man who wrote it more than 30 years ago. But his 
daughter could change that. Ron tank reports. The music is familiar, 
the pink panther theme. But on this night, in front of cameras for 
a PBS special, the vocalist may not be so familiar, until you realize 
how she's related to the songs. It's the music of my father, Henry 
mancini. Monica mancini has chosen 13 of her dad's songs for the special 
and an accompanying CD, her first. The reason I didn't sing my dad's 
stuff sooner was because he was around to do it. Henry mancini died 
in 1994, but his work remains as a legacy to his talent, including 
his most famous song, Moon river That was the one song that I -- I 
knew I had to include it in the CD. But that was the biggest challenge 
for me. First of all, me getting out of the notion that this is Andy 
Williams' song. Whenever you're going I'm going your way I just had 
to own it, and I found a way to make it my own. And I think I did 
a pretty good job. While this is her first attempt at a solo career, 
Monica has been a backup singer for years. Her voice, she says, comes 
from her mom. Yeah, you know, I chose my career because I saw my mother 
working in the studios as a young singer. She used to sing, she was 
a Mel-Tone, with Mel torme. Drummer Greg field produced the album, 
and the arrangements for the special. He also happens to be Monica's 
husband. It's very comforting to know he's back there. And every now 
and then I just take a little peek and he gives me a wink, and I tell 
you, it just makes everything really nice. The TV special launches 
the public broadcasting service into the record business, with mancini 
the first artist for the new PBS label, a Joint Venture with Warner 
brothers records. She will record four more CDs for them, but it's 
the first, the one honoring her dad, that means the most. I can't 
help but feel he's kinda been guiding me through this process. Ron 
tank, "CNN Entertainment News," Hollywood.
