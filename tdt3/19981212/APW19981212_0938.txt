Gen. Augusto Pinochet accused the British government of kidnapping 
him in an act of ``treason,'' that makes Prime Minister Tony Blair 
``untrustworthy,'' according to a report in the Sunday Mirror newspaper. 
The former Chilean dictator branded Home Secretary Jack Straw, who 
earlier this week ruled he could be extradited to Spain, a kidnapper 
and declared that British justice ``can be bent depending on what 
time of day it is,'' the newspaper said. The tabloid newspaper said 
the interview was conducted through Pinochet's friend and former cabinet 
minister Sergio de Castro, who met with reporters and asked the general 
questions on the telephone on their behalf, relaying Pinochet's responses. 
The Sunday Mirror stood by its story despite a later statement from 
Patrick Robertson, an adviser to General Pinochet, denying Pinochet 
had given an interview to the Sunday Mirror. ``The sentiments expressed 
by Sergio de Castro are his own, and Senator Pinochet has no comment 
now or in the near future about the circumstances surrounding his 
detention in the United Kingdom,'' Robertson said. The 83-year-old 
general has been held in Britain since London police arrested him 
Oct. 16 in his hospital bed as he recovered from back surgery. He 
was detained after a Spanish judge sought his extradition to face 
charges of genocide, torture and murder during his 17-year regime, 
which ended in 1990. ``They have effectively kidnapped me and are 
now holding me illegally against my will. The men behind this are 
no more than criminals,'' The Sunday Mirror quoted Pinochet as saying. 
``And how can Tony Blair ever be trusted? He is untrustworthy.'' A 
spokesman for Blair, speaking on customary condition of anonymity, 
declined comment on the report, saying the matter is a judicial process 
and that it would be inappropriate to comment. Meanwhile, the Foreign 
Office denied a report in the Sunday Telegraph newspaper that officials 
at the British embassy in Madrid had warned Pinochet two months ago 
not to come to Britain after learning he could face an extradition 
request from Spain. The telegraph said a source at the Chilean embassy 
in Madrid, which it did not name, confirmed a warning had been received 
and passed on. The paper quoted Pinochet lawyer Fernando Barros as 
saying that although his team knew the Spanish judge was investigating 
Pinochet, they believed he had not formulated an accusation, so assumed 
it was safe for Pinochet to travel to London.
