As his colleagues in Washington debated President Clinton's fate, 
House Speaker Newt Gingrich played host Saturday to a farewell town 
hall meeting in his district that combined effusive tributes for Gingrich 
with seething denunciations of Clinton. At both his forum at Walton 
High School and at a news conference, Gingrich maintained his distance 
from the details of the impeachment process, which he has bequeathed 
to his successor, Rep. Bob Livingston, and to Rep. Henry Hyde, chairman 
of the Judiciary Committee. He relented to speak about Clinton only 
when Chris Bennett, a ninth grader at Lassiter High School, asked 
him what the next president should do ``to restore dignity to the 
office.'' Gingrich responded: ``I suspect every person in this room 
is a sinner. But there is an enormous difference between being human 
and failing to recognize the responsibilities and the duties you have 
voluntarily accepted. I hope that the next president, whoever they 
are and of whatever party, takes seriously being the leader of a free 
people, takes seriously being commander in chief, takes seriously 
that the Oval Office is the civic center of the American nation. And 
I think, frankly, any reasonable person who takes those three and 
does them will, in a heartbeat, will in the opening 24 hours, restore 
to the White House the dignity, the honor, the decency which it has 
so clearly lost in the last six years.'' At the town hall meeting, 
the 33rd such forum that Gingrich has held in his district since becoming 
speaker in 1995, dozens of the 500 people present lined up to pay 
homage. They hailed Gingrich, who will leave the House on Jan. 3, 
as a compassionate visionary who made time for his constituents even 
after the Republicans took control of the House in 1994. With thunderous 
ovations, they urged him to run for president, which he later said 
he would not do in 2000. Gingrich, who announced his resignation from 
the House last month after the Democrats gained seats in the Nov. 
3 election, said he had consulted on Friday with Livingston about 
next week's impeachment vote. But he refused to disclose any advice 
he offered about whether the Republican leadership should allow debate 
on a Democratic proposal to censure Clinton. He urged all House members 
to vote their conscience. While declining to specify his own views 
on impeachment, Gingrich emphasized that his withdrawal from the House's 
leadership had removed a political obstacle to the proceedings. ``For 
the last month, because I haven't been public, because I haven't said 
anything, the focus really has been on some issues that are pretty 
important to the country,'' Gingrich said with a grin. He acknowledged 
that he is such ``a sufficiently vocal and polarizing personality'' 
that Clinton had been able to use him effectively as a foil. As long 
as he remained speaker, he said, he would continue to serve as ``the 
excuse.'' ``The president is a brilliant counterpuncher,'' Gingrich 
said. ``He does almost nothing positive but he hits those who try 
to do things remarkably well. And now, frankly, he has to stand on 
his own feet. He and Gore have to decide are they going to handle 
Washington, are they going to lead the world, are they going to solve 
problems. And the country will measure them without being in some 
kind of fight with the Republican speaker of the House.'' After leaving 
the House, Gingrich, 55, said he would give paid speeches and remain 
vocal on issues.
