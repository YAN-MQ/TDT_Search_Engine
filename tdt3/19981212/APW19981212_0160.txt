Asian Games host Thailand has announced its desire to stage a Summer 
Olympics following a pat on the back from International Olympic Committee 
president Juan Antonio Samaranch. ``We feel we are capable to host 
the Olympic Games,'' Pitak Intrawityanunt, a government minister, 
told reporters. ``How soon and how far away that might be will be 
decided on how it develops.'' Bangkok now is busy with the Asian Games, 
featuring 6,000 athletes from 41 nations. The previous Summer Olympics, 
in Atlanta in 1996, had 11,000 athletes from 197 countries. Bangkok 
has struggled with facilities and organization at the Asian Games. 
While the venues are new, most are without finishing touches such 
as paved parking lots, and areas such as the results service are clearly 
well short of Olympic standard _ even Atlanta's Olympic standard. 
Pitak would not say which year Thailand might target but an official 
from the country's Olympic committee joked that 2016 would be best. 
Olympic Council of Asia president Sheikh Ahmad Al-Sabah said Asia 
should win the right to the 2008 Games. Osaka, Japan, a city from 
China and Kuala Lumpur, Malaysia, have indicated an interest in becoming 
the Asian candidate. Al-Sabah said a bid from Bangkok would be welcomed.
