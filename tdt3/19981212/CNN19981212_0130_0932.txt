Among our top stories -- the full house will soon have to decide whether 
President Clinton should be impeached. The Judiciary committee has 
approved three articles of impeachment alleging mr. Clinton perjured 
himself before the federal grand jury, lied in his civil deposition 
in the Paula Jones case and obstructed justice. With one exception, 
votes were along party lines. The committee picks up debate Saturday 
morning on the fourth article, alleging abuse of power. Democrats 
also hope to debate a censure motion. Mr. Clinton made another public 
appeal for forgiveness Friday. He says he feels "profound remorse" 
and understands "accountability demands consequences."
