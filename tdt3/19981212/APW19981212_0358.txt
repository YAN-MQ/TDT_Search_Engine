The European Bank for Reconstruction and Development is considering 
a loan for completing two nuclear reactors in Ukraine, but wants proof 
the project will be profitable, the bank's president said Saturday. 
Horst Koehler told a news conference in Kiev that the EBRD would propose 
the loan to the bank's board of governors if Ukraine proves that the 
project, with an estimated cost of dlrs 1.2 billion, will make enough 
profit to repay the loan. ``Nothing has been decided yet,'' Koehler 
said. Ukraine wants to complete the reactors at the Khmelnytsky and 
Rivne power plants to compensate for the planned closing of the Chernobyl 
power plant, which the government has pledged to shut down by 2000. 
The former Soviet republic has said it does not have the money to 
finish the reactors, and has been seeking help from the EBRD and Western 
nations. The government has warned repeatedly it will not shut down 
Chernobyl, the site of the world's worst nuclear disaster in 1986, 
until the two reactors are completed. Koehler said, the EBRD does 
not want the closing of the Soviet-designed nuclear reactors at Chernobyl 
delayed. ``The closure of Chernobyl as early as possible is a most 
urgent and necessary task,'' he said. Koehler, appointed to head the 
EBRD in September, spoke at the end of a three-day visit to Ukraine, 
his first trip to one of the bank's 26 countries of operations. During 
meetings with President Leonid Kuchma and Prime Minister Valery Pustovoitenko 
on Friday, Koehler praised Ukraine's efforts in battling the effects 
of the economic crisis in neighboring Russia, and said the EBRD would 
continue to help Ukraine through its present economic hardships. The 
EBRD so far has committed about dlrs 750 million for nearly 30 projects 
in Ukraine. The latest was approved Saturday after Koehler and Kiev 
Mayor Oleksandr Omelchenko signed an agreement under which the EBRD 
would become a major investor in the construction of a dlrs 41 million 
four-star hotel in Kiev, the first of its kind in Ukraine.
