Akihito Yokoyama shot a 3-under 68 in the third round Saturday to 
grab a two-stroke lead in the season-ending 80 million-yen (dlrs 680,000) 
Okinawa Open. Hoping to end the season with his first victory in the 
Japan PGA tour, Yokoyama sank four birdies against one bogey over 
the 6,359-yard, par-71 Daikyo Country Club course, bringing his 54-hole 
total to 9-under 204. Hidemichi Tanaka, winner of the Japan Open, 
carded five birdies against three bogeys for a 69 for a lone second 
place at 7-under 206. American David Ishii, who had led the first 
two rounds, shot a 1-over 72. Opening the round with a bogey on the 
first hole, Ishii added three more bogeys against three birdies. Ishii, 
seeking his first victory in four years, was tied for third place 
at 6-under 207 with Nobumitsu Yuhara, who had a 68 Saturday. Taiwan's 
Hsieh Chin-sheng shot a 70 for a three-round total of 210 to share 
10th place with Eduardo Herrera of Colombia, Frankie Minoza of the 
Philippines and Richard Backwell of Australia. Hererra also had a 
70, and Minoza and Backwell shot a 71 and a 72 respectively. The winner 
will collect 14.4 million yen (dlrs 123,000).
