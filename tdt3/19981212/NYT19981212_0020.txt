A natural-gas pipeline exploded in the middle of downtown shortly 
before noon Friday, killing four people, injuring 16 others and leveling 
three buildings in a one-block area. Witnesses said the blast, which 
blew out windows several blocks away and could be felt up to five 
miles away created a dust cloud that covered the entire downtown area 
and hurled debris up to three blocks. The authorities said a construction 
crew laying fiber-optic cable accidentally ruptured the line, releasing 
gas into the air. Firefighters and investigators from Northern States 
Power Co. were on the scene warning people of the leak and evacuating 
the area when the explosion was sparked. The cause of the spark was 
unknown. Two of the dead were employees of the power company who were 
investigating the leak. The other two were not immediately known. 
Chief Michael Holman of the St. Cloud fire department said all potential 
victims had been accounted for, and he said crews would work through 
the night, with the help of search dogs, heavy equipment and dozens 
of volunteers to clear the wreckage. He said most of the injured were 
treated at the hospital, including two firefighters and four victims 
who were rescued from the rubble. One woman was in critical condition 
undergoing surgery. ``This area can be pretty busy during lunchtime,'' 
Holman said. ``We're very lucky this didn't happen even a half-hour 
later.'' The blast occurred in the Courthouse Square section of the 
city, the central part of downtown. A bar, a restaurant and a two-story 
building containing a law office and apartments were destroyed. Ed 
Murray was delivering beer to Bookem's, the bar that was destroyed, 
when the explosion occurred. ``I was standing in the bar making my 
delivery when I felt this enormous push of air,'' he said. ``The next 
thing I knew I was outside the bar. It was like a movie, everything 
happening in slow motion and debris flying everywhere. The dust was 
so thick I couldn't see a foot in front of me.'' The blast occurred 
just one block from the headquarters of the fire and police departments, 
and Murray said authorities were immediately on the scene to help 
victims. ``I went back inside the bar to find the owner, and by the 
time I located him and came back out, police were giving first aid 
and evacuating people,'' he said. The authorities shut off power and 
gas to the area immediately and evacuated a six-block area that included 
an elementary school. Capt. Len Smallwood of the St. Cloud police 
department, who felt the windows shake in his office a block away, 
said he and other officers ran outside to assist after hearing the 
blast. ``We headed out the doors and there was debris just floating 
in the air and this huge dust cloud,'' he said, likening the scene 
to his experience at war. ``I haven't see anything like it except 
for Vietnam,'' Smallwood said. ``It made me want to take cover.'' 
After clearing the rest of the wreckage to ensure that no victims 
were trapped, the authorities said they would begin investigating 
what ignited the explosion. Fire officials as well as investigators 
from the Minnesota Office of Pipeline Safety were sent to the scene. 
Gov. Arne Carlson traveled Friday to St. Cloud, a city of about 58,000 
people, 75 miles northwest of Minneapolis. He promised state emergency 
money to help pay for the cleanup and emergency services.
