As the political wrangling continues in Washington, President Clinton 
is sticking to his plan to head to the Middle East Saturday. Mr. Clinton's 
three-day visit to Israel, the West Bank and Gaza was supposed to 
usher in the second stage of the wye river interim accord. But Friday, 
more violence broke out in the West Bank. Israeli troops opened fire 
on hundreds of Palestinian stone-throwers who were protesting Israel's 
refusal to release some prisoners. Two Palestinians were killed.
