Japan's swim team, humiliated by the steroid-fueled Chinese four years 
ago, surpassed the world swim power as champion of Asia on Saturday. 
Japan beat a Chinese team without several top stars 15-13 in the gold 
medal count, bouncing back from a 25-5 trouncing in Hiroshima in 1994. 
Masato Hirano sealed Japan's victory with a gold medal in the 1,500-meter 
freestyle, the last of 32 events. Not even a win by convicted drug 
offender Xiong Guoming, who won four golds in 1994 before he and six 
other Chinese swimmers were banned for positive tests, could stem 
the Japanese tide. Before Saturday's final session, leading coach 
Han Mingyan admitted he had underestimated the Japanese. Han coaches 
world 400 medley record-holder and dual world champion Chen Yan, who 
failed to get a gold and was hit by a stomach ailment. Han suggested 
that poor preparation was the reason for China's failure to win the 
gold count. ``We have underestimated our Japanese rivals, and they 
are stronger than expected,'' said Han. ``I introduced a rather conservative 
training method for Chen in preparation for the games. I thought we 
didn't have to push too hard. We will never let this happen again.'' 
Japan's Mai Nakamura, second in the 200-meter backstroke Saturday, 
said the team had worked hard to face China at this meet following 
the disaster in 1994. ``This time we set the goal of beating China 
and we've achieved the goal,'' Nakamura said. Xiong, one of the main 
figures in China's worst drugs scandal, was back in winning form Saturday. 
He joined another of his teammates here, Fu Yong, in returning to 
the games with a gold medal and helped China briefly level the gold 
standings at 12-12 through 26 events. After a poor start to the meet, 
including a second evening with no golds, Chinese officials marshaled 
their troops into the stands, where they stood Friday and Saturday 
waving tiny red flags and cheering their teammates. Xiong turned and 
waved to his compatriots after his 200 medley win and pointed at the 
scoreboard. His time showed 2 minutes, 3.34 seconds, an Asian Games 
record. Yoshimi finished in 2:04.93, with China's Xie Xufeng taking 
bronze in 2:05.45. But Japan went back ahead when Tomoko Hagiwara 
won the women's 200-meter backstroke, and then the men's 4x100 medley 
team gave it a two-gold lead. China's Shan Ying added a 50-meter freestyle 
gold to her earlier 100 triumph, narrowing the gap to one again. Shan 
clocked 25.88 seconds to edge compatriot Han Xue and Japan's Sumika 
Minamoto. But Hirano's 1,500 freestyle triumph sealed the meet. The 
opening event gave a sixth country a chance to share in the swim gold 
medals. Cho Hee-yeon of South Korea was an easy winner of the women's 
200-meter butterfly, clocking 2:11.34. Japan's Hitomi Kashima held 
a slight advantage turning through the 100-meter mark but faded into 
third in 2:13.26. China's Ruan Yi won silver. Malaysia, Taiwan and 
Thailand also finished with one gold each in the pool.
