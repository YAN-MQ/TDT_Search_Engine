The battle lines over allowing the House to censure President Clinton 
rather than impeach him hardened sharply Saturday, as Rep. Bob Livingston, 
the speaker-designate, vowed to block such a move, and White House 
allies promised to take the fight to the American public. Livingston 
shed his ambiguity on the issue moments after the House Judiciary 
Committee rejected censure as an alternative, and the panel's chairman, 
Henry Hyde, urged House Republican leaders to keep it off the floor, 
saying such a move would threaten the separation of powers between 
the legislative and executive branches. In revealing his position, 
Livingston said that he strongly supported impeachment and that censure 
was not envisioned by the Constitution's founders. ``Censure is out 
of the realm of responsibility of the House of Representatives,'' 
Livingston said before flying back to Washington from Louisiana Saturday. 
``We have a constitutional responsibility to charge or not charge, 
impeach or not impeach.'' Nonetheless, President Clinton's supporters 
mounted a full-scale campaign to force Livingston to reverse course, 
aiming to build public support for an alternative to impeachment and 
to put a glaring spotlight on Livingston's ability to cope with his 
newly won leadership duties. The Democratic challenge, already facing 
long odds before Saturday, now confronts a unified House Republican 
leadership, bolstered by the arguments offered by Hyde, which are 
likely to influence many undecided Republicans. Only a strong, vocal 
protest from several moderate Republicans who oppose impeachment could 
force Livingston to reverse course at this late hour, censure supporters 
say. And up to now, any Republican who has openly opposed impeachment 
or supported censure has been hammered mercilessly by conservative 
groups and right-wing talk radio. Rep. Tom DeLay, the Republican whip 
and a fierce critic of Clinton, fears that allowing a censure vote 
would siphon votes from impeachment. Recognizing this dynamic, the 
president's allies Saturday tried to begin gathering the broad public 
support for censure to give moderate Republicans the political cover 
they need to openly challenge their leadership. But White House allies 
voiced worries that it would be hard to rouse a public distracted 
by the holiday season, even though opinion polls are running hard 
against impeachment. Moments after the Judiciary Committee voted out 
a fourth article of impeachment, Democrats on the panel gave an impassioned 
argument for a censure alternative that condemns the president's ``reprehensible 
conduct'' and leaves open the possibility that Clinton could face 
``criminal and civil penalties'' after leaving office. It does not 
call for a fine. ``If you want to punish the president or brand the 
president with scarlet letters or stamp him on the forehead, censure 
is the way to do it,'' said Rep. Martin Meehan, D-Mass. To buttress 
their case, Democrats underscored the gravity of an impeachment vote, 
by arguing that casting such a vote explicitly urges the president's 
removal. ``This is not sending to the Senate a questionnaire,'' said 
Rep. Barney Frank, D-Mass. ``This is a statement the president should 
be thrown out.'' Several Democrats sought to put pressure on Livingston. 
Rep. John Conyers of Michigan, the ranking Democrat on the committee, 
conceded that the censure resolution would fail in committee (it did, 
22-14), but focused on its chances on the House floor. ``We will practice 
our arguments today and prepare them for a larger presentation,'' 
Conyers said. ``My hope is on the untested speaker-elect, Bob Livingston.'' 
Republicans on the panel rejected the censure resolution as unconstitutional, 
a bad precedent and feckless. In a letter to Livingston and Speaker 
Newt Gingrich released moments after the committee adjourned, Hyde 
said ``a resolution or amendment proposing censure of the president 
in lieu of impeachment violates the rules of the House, threatens 
the separation of powers, and fails to meet constitutional muster.'' 
Rep. Bob Goodlatte, R-Va., said the president's crimes were too serious 
for censure. ``This president mocks the Congress, and this censure 
is exactly what this president wants,'' he said in debate Saturday. 
``He will take this as a vindication of his mocking and we should 
not give it to him.'' As committee Democrats began their frontal assault, 
the House Democratic leader, Rep. Dick Gephardt, appealed in a letter 
to Livingston to allow a censure vote on the House floor. Gephardt's 
aides vowed an intense fight for censure and issued veiled warnings 
that Livingston, by blocking a vote on censure, was inviting protracted 
battles with House Democrats in the next Congress. ``This first most 
important decision for you as a leader will mark more than the fate 
of impeachment,'' Gephardt said. ``It will surely mark the kind of 
leader you will be, and thereby the kind of Congress we can expect 
under your speakership.'' But Livingston characterized Gephardt's 
proposition as flouting the rules of the House. ``An attack on the 
rules is an attack on the chair,'' Livingston said. Democrats and 
Republicans also threw back in Livingston's face his promise not to 
whip the impeachment vote, and instead make it a vote of conscience 
for each member. ``The Republican leadership cannot say this is a 
conscience vote, if they don't allow members of Congress to express 
their conscience to voice an alternative,'' said Rep. Peter King, 
R-N.Y., who opposes impeachment. Rep. Bob Ney, R-Ohio, who is undeclared, 
said, ``I'd rather see censure as an open option.'' The fact that 
Congress is out of session, and that lawmakers are scattered across 
the country, has also hurt the censure effort. But as House members 
filter back, censure supporters say, they will try to gather their 
allies for a final push. ``Between now and Thursday, there has to 
be on outpouring of public opinion,'' King said. ``People are still 
not focused on this. The average American thought this ended with 
the elections on Nov. 3, and they aren't fully aware we're down this 
path.''
