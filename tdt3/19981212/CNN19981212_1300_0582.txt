The astronauts aboard the shuttle "endeavour" have a high-rise construction 
job later today. They'll embark on their third and final space walk 
of what has been, so far, a most successful mission. Miles O'Brien 
reports. The third time's the charm -- or so they hope -- for today's 
final trip outside the space shuttle "endeavour." Space walkers Jerry 
Ross and Jim Newman have as their main task equipping future zero 
G workers. By installing a bag of tools outside unity the U.S. piece 
of the newly formed international space station -- By positioning 
it outside on this flight, they don't have to haul it up and down 
with the space shuttle freeing up room in the payload mass to bring 
other things up and down. The high wire orbiting team will also try 
to repeat their success, prodding loose a stuck docking antenna outside 
the Russian-built zarya Module. During their second space walk, a 
boat hook did the trick on an identical antenna. They also plan to 
install handrails between unity and zarya. We'll be disconnecting 
and storing some cables that will no longer be needed. And then we'll 
do a complete photo documentation of the outside of the station. Perhaps 
the highlight of their three-day stint as space workers will come 
as they reach the top of zarya, 77 feet above "endeavour's" payload 
bay. That's the money view? That's the top of the mountain. And I 
think that as anyone at the top of a mountain, I expect we will pause 
for a moment and appreciate being there. Then, before they go off 
the space work clock for the last time, they will test a portable 
jet backpack which future space station hard hats will carry in case 
their tethers fail them. So far, very little has failed this forerunning 
crew of space working stiffs, except for three small pieces of hardware 
which floated away from jerry Ross. What advice would you give to 
future space walkers so that won't happen again? Don't do what I did. 
I haven't the slightest idea what happened. I did four previous space 
walks, never lost an item. Ross says, from now on, he and Newman will 
be double tethering all the tools and parts they are using. The lessons 
they learn will undoubtedly come in handy on the 160 space station 
construction shifts which are on the horizon. Miles O'Brien, CNN.
