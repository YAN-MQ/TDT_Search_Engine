China rallied from an opening match loss by Olympic champion Liu Guoliang 
to beat archrival South Korea 3-1 in the final of the Asian Games 
men's table tennis Saturday. Paced by veteran Kong Linghui and rookie 
Wang Liqin, China's men made it a sweep of the team titles again. 
China's men and women have routinely dominated the team events at 
world competitions and the Asian Games, although South Korea has always 
been a menace to the Chinese, staging stunning upsets in both events 
at the 1986 Asian Games at home in Seoul. In singles and doubles, 
China has won 14 of the last 15 world or Olympic titles since 1995. 
It seemed South Korea was ready to spring another surprise when Kim 
Taek-soo upset Liu in the opening match. Liu had routinely won the 
opening game, 21-14, and appeared on his way to victory then Kim won 
the next two games, 21-14, 21-15. However veteran Kong, the 1995 world 
champion and silver medalist in the 1996 Olympics behind Liu, came 
back to defeat Oh Sang-Eun 23-21, 19-21, 21-16. Kong finally solved 
Oh's game in the third set, when he started to serve better. ``Oh's 
returns on my serves were poor and it cost him too much,'' Kong said. 
Wang Liqin, a newcomer to the Chinese team, came on to beat Lee Chul-Seung 
21-14, 15-21, 21-8. A 19-year-old former national junior champion, 
Wang is regarded as a future star after upsetting a former world champion 
at his first world championships last year in England. Kong returned 
to face Kim and beat him 21-17, 21-18. The South Korean had the early 
lead in both games. Then Kong started to win the long rallies, putting 
the South Korean on the defensive and forcing errors. Kong took the 
lead at 14-13 in the first game and held it the rest of the way. At 
18-all in the second game, a long exchange put Kong ahead and then 
he took the final two points, springing up in victory on the match 
point when Kim could not handle a return that curved into his body. 
China's coach Cai Zhehua was not surprised at the victory. ``We prepared 
very carefully for this match since the South Koreans are tenacious 
and aggressive,'' Cai said. ``However, we have never lost confidence. 
Just as I said before the final, China is a sure bet for the team 
title. '' The Chinese women, playing without superstar and multi-world 
champion Deng Yaping, won their team title Friday. The doubles and 
mixed competitions start Sunday, with the singles beginning Monday.
