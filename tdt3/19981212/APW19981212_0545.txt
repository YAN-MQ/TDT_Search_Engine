Famine in southern Somalia has killed 25 people, mostly children, 
in the past two weeks, local authorities said Saturday. Officials 
in the Middle Juba region, 400 kilometers southwest of the capital 
Mogadishu, in south central Somalia, said extensive periods of flooding 
and drought had destroyed more than two thirds of this season's crop 
harvest, and the floods also attracted mosquitos and destroyed clean 
water sources. Subsequently, more than 40 percent of the region's 
children were suffering from hunger, malaria, diarrhea and tuberculosis, 
according to administration officials in the region. Khadija Ahmed 
Abukar, a World Health Organization official, said more than 700,000 
Somalis were affected by food shortages in the south of the country. 
On Saturday, a ship carrying 750 metric tons of dry foods, including 
maize, lentils and porridge for the U.N World Food Program, and 250 
crates of WHO medicines to combat cholera, docked at the port town 
of Merca, 100 kilometers (65 miles) south of the capital Mogadishu. 
Khadija said the cholera medications were to go to the Bay and Bakol 
regions in Middle Juba, west and northwest of Mogadishu, where several 
cases have been reported.
