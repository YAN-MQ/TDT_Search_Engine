The dwindling number of members of Congress who remain undecided about 
impeachment have different views on what President Clinton can still 
say or do to keep them from voting to impeach him this week. Some 
want him to admit perjury. Some want him to simply say, ``I lied.'' 
Some cannot really express what they want, they just know they want 
something. But what they all agree on is that whatever they need, 
they have not gotten it yet. And with that judgment, a rising tide 
of undecided members say they are inclined to vote for impeachment, 
now that the president's allies have presented his defense before 
the Judiciary Committee and the president himself has addressed the 
nation to reiterate his remorse about the Lewinsky affair. ``How I 
wish he had told the truth at the start of this controversy, because 
chances are the nation would not be in this mess,'' said Rep. Rodney 
Frelinghuysen, R-N.J., a moderate, who declared his intention to vote 
for impeachment just minutes after Clinton's national address on Friday. 
``The president has no one to blame but himself.'' Though Clinton's 
allies say they still have hope of winning over enough Republicans 
to block impeachment, it is clear their universe of potential swing 
votes is shrinking fast. On Friday, at least six previously undecided 
members announced plans to vote for impeachment, and moderate Republicans 
say many more are leaning toward jumping on the impeachment bandwagon. 
``The speech was underwhelming,'' one moderate Republican from the 
Northeast, who had been leaning against impeachment, said on condition 
of anonymity following Clinton's five-minute address. ``It didn't 
do anything to change one vote. The brevity of it, it was kind of 
like: `They told me I had to do this, so I'll do it.''' Some of those 
who have been counted among the undecideds had said they needed nothing 
less than a full admission from the president that he perjured himself 
about his relations with Monica Lewinsky. They did not get it. ``As 
far as refuting the charges of perjury and obstruction of justice, 
I don't think they changed any minds,'' said Rep. James Walsh, R-N.Y., 
who announced Saturday that he would vote for impeachment. Others 
in the undecided camp had maintained before the president's address 
to the nation that Clinton could have helped restore his credibility 
by simply using the words, ``I lied,'' whether in reference to his 
statements to the public or his testimony before a grand jury. They 
did not get that, either. ``I think the president has missed a number 
of important opportunities to help rebuild his credibility,'' said 
Rep. Rick Lazio, R-N.Y., who left on a trip to Israel with Clinton 
Saturday. ``He has lied on a number of occasions,'' Lazio said. ``And 
by not being able to confront the reality of that, by not saying, 
`I have lied, and these are the reasons I lied,' and by not explaining 
to the American people that he knows the difference between a truth 
and a lie in an honest and straightforward way, he has missed an opportunity 
to rebuild his credibility.'' Many of the undecided members have expressed 
deep anguish about the impeachment proceedings and seem to have spent 
recent days groping for arguments that would justify breaking party 
ranks to vote against it. Among some of those members, there was an 
almost palpable disappointment with the president's speech on Friday. 
Rep. Bob Ney, R-Ohio, said he could see regret on Clinton's face during 
the address. ``But I don't think he took the step many people were 
anticipating,'' Ney said. ``He wouldn't say, `I didn't tell the truth 
under oath.' I would say at this point, candor is the best course. 
But I'm still up in the air on how I'll vote. I'm disappointed, but 
I'm not holding it against him.'' Ney comes from the kind of district 
that Clinton's allies had thought would make him likely to oppose 
impeachment: It is a Democratic district and voted overwhelmingly 
for Clinton in 1996. House Democrats had targeted about two dozen 
other Republicans with swing districts, including people like Lazio, 
Constance Morella of Maryland and Nancy Johnson of Connecticut, for 
lobbying. Facing a handful of defections from their own ranks on impeachment, 
the Democrats calculate they will need to swing about 15 Republicans 
against impeachment; so far, they have five. A sixth member who had 
expressed opposition to impeachment, Rep. John Edward Porter, R-Ill., 
now says he has not ruled out voting for it. There are also, however, 
several moderate Republicans who have been among the undecided who 
come from solidly Republican districts and whose political futures 
would hardly seem imperiled by a vote for impeachment. Yet many of 
them, too, say they are genuinely pained by the historic vote facing 
them. One of them, Rep. Amo Houghton, R-N.Y., announced his opposition 
to impeachment last week. Asked why so many moderate Republicans feel 
torn about the matter, Rep. Sherwood Boehlert, R-N.Y., said, ``It's 
the very nature of the beast. A moderate tends to be a person, and 
I plead guilty to this and don't apologize to anyone, who recognizes 
that on most issues there is more than one side. The moderates agonize.'' 
He added that he is looking for contrition from the president, but 
that ``no single word'' could help him decide. ``It's important in 
my mind to look at it and evaluate it and make a judgment on what 
he is really saying,'' Boehlert said. ``Is this a classic finesse, 
or does he really mean it? I don't know how you judge that. I know 
how I judge it.'' But other members raised the bar much higher. Rep. 
Mark Foley, R-Fla., who is leaning toward impeachment, said Clinton 
might have to admit having committed crimes and then throw himself 
on the mercy of Congress to avoid impeachment. In that situation, 
Foley said, Congress might respond like a lenient judge and say, ``I 
could have given you 20 years, but I'm compelled by your remorse, 
your recognition of the crime and I see fit to reduce that.'' But 
a few undecided members acknowledged what some of the president's 
allies have been saying: That there is almost nothing the president 
can do or say anymore to change minds. ``I don't think there is anything 
that the president could say that will sway the vote anymore,'' said 
Rep. Michael Forbes, R-N.Y. ``It is up to us to sift through all the 
mountains of information, to digest the process of the last week and 
really do some soul searching.''
