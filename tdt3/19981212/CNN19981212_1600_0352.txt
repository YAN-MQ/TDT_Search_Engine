U.S. defense secretary William Cohen has postponed a planned trip 
to germany. He will now leave Wednesday for Belgium, so he can resolve 
significant military budget issues in Washington. Asked if the delay 
was prompted by the latest confrontation between Iraq and U.N. weapons 
inspectors, a Pentagon spokesman said Cohen would be following other 
issues in addition to his budgetary work. Weapons inspectors were 
denied access to the headquarters of Saddam hussein's political party 
Wednesday.
