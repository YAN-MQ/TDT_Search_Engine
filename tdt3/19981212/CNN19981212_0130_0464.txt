Jrx 29 attorneys who helped three states settle their lawsuits against 
the tobacco industry are being rewarded for their work. They'll get 
almost $8.2 billion, believed to be the largest legal fee ever awarded 
in the United States. The lawyers helped Texas, Mississippi and Florida 
win more than $34 billion from big tobacco. One cigarettemaker is 
calling the lawyers' share, "obscene."
