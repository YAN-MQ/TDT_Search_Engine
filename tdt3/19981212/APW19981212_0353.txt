Plans to exhume Kosovo massacre victims from a site in rebel-held 
territory may have to be dropped due to Serbian police resistance, 
a forensics team member said Saturday. A Finnish team that tried to 
start work Thursday at a site in the central Drenica region was blocked 
by police in armored vehicles who said the digging couldn't be carried 
out without their presence. Talks between the experts and government 
authorities have yet to resolve the dispute, said team member Tino 
Lahelma. ``Anything can happen, but I do think we have an impasse 
with Gornje Obrinje,'' the pathologist said. ``If this situation would 
persist, then Gornje Obrinje would not be possible.'' Efforts would 
continue to carry out exhumations at five other sites where government 
authorities also gave the European Union-funded team permission to 
dig. ``We don't want to give up,'' he said. In the latest violence 
in tense Kosovo, Serbian media said ethnic Albanian gunmen killed 
five people Friday. Four of the dead reportedly were ethnic Albanians 
loyal to the Serbian government _ three near Glogovac and one in a 
southwestern village _ and one was a Serb policeman, killed near Djakovica 
in western Kosovo. Gornje Obrinje, 40 kilometers (25 miles) west of 
Pristina, is the site of among the most gruesome killings from fighting 
between Serb forces and ethnic Albanian separatist rebels that left 
hundreds dead this year. A makeshift collective grave on a hillside 
there is believed to contain the bodies of 22 ethnic Albanians from 
a single family clan, including those of women and children. The mutilated 
bodies were seen by diplomats and journalists shortly after the slayings 
in a nearby forest in September. The top government official for Kosovo, 
Zoran Andjelkovic, insists the Finns are not being prevented from 
doing their work. But Lahelma said it's unrealistic for police to 
insist on escorting the Finns and the Serbian legal team accompanying 
them to the site in rebel-controlled territory, with tensions remaining 
high despite a two-month-old truce. The Kosovo Liberation Army has 
said only the Finns, not the police, are welcome in Drenica, heartland 
of the guerrilla movement. ``We don't want to risk our lives'' by 
bringing police into a KLA-controlled area, Lahelma said. Meanwhile, 
family members of Serb civilians believed abducted by rebels appealed 
Saturday to the U.S. head of international peace monitors to help 
in the search for the missing. ``Your authority with representatives 
of Albanians can help solve the mystery and we could learn the truth 
what happened to our loved ones,'' said the open letter sent to U.S. 
diplomat William Walker. Walker heads the Kosovo Verification Mission 
still being assembled by the Organization for Security and Cooperation 
in Europe. About 200 Serbs have disappeared in Kosovo, including some 
40 from the town of Orahovac, where hundreds of people held a protest 
march to a rebel stronghold Thursday to demand information about their 
fate.
