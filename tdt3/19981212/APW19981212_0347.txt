What looked ominously like the week of going nowhere loomed Saturday 
in Italy, where workers for planes, trains, highways, buses and subways 
all were planning to walk off their jobs. Newspapers and TV ran complicated 
calendars Saturday advising Italians and tourists exactly what workers 
will be striking, when, and where. Come Monday, travel stood to require 
the exquisite timing and strategic finesse of a battlefield general. 
``A hellish week,'' Rome's Il Messagero daily warned. As of Saturday, 
highlights of the strike calendar included rail strikes Monday night 
through Wednesday, ground crew strikes at Milan's airports Monday 
and Wednesday and a toll-booth worker strike on Thursday. The toughest 
day promised to be Tuesday, when rail workers, flight attendants and 
Rome's public transportation workers all intended to walk off the 
job. Trying to ease the coming paralysis, the government reminded 
unions on Friday that concurrent strikes were illegal. Authorities 
also spoke of revising a 1991 pact so as to ban big-city bus and subway 
strikes of more than 24 hours.
