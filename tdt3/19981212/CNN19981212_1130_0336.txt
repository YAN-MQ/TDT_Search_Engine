Baseball legend Joe DiMaggio is sitting up and speaking after emerging 
from a coma. His doctor says the Yankee great is finally responding 
to antibiotics being given to fight pneumonia. Yesterday, the doctor 
said the 84-year-old was near death. DiMaggio has been in a Florida 
hospital since October when he was admitted for lung cancer surgery. 
Since then, his condition has see-sawed. His doctor says if the antibiotics 
continue to work, DiMaggio could recover.
