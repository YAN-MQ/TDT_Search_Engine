It is easy to overlook amid all of the running and pressing. After 
all, open-court steals and breakaway baskets are more eye-catching 
than a proper box-out. But it was not St. John's speed and pressure 
that Virginia Coach Pete Gillen raved about after the Red Storm routed 
his Cavaliers Saturday 95-68. Instead, he gushed about St. John's 
brute strength under the basket. ``They just manhandled us on the 
boards,'' said Gillen, who is in his first year at Virginia. ``It 
was unbelievable. It was just men playing against young men. Tyrone 
Grant is a tough, hard-nosed kid. He's just a monster. We had nobody 
to compete with that. The boards was just a joke.'' Gillen, whose 
young club was dropped violently to 6-4, was not exaggerating. The 
rebounding columns of the final box score forced one to rub his eyes 
and take a second look. With no one taller than 6 feet 8 inches playing 
more than eight minutes, St. John's grabbed a remarkable 31 offensive 
rebounds, 4 more than Virginia had on both ends of the court. Grant 
had 16 rebounds, to go with 19 points. All told, the Red Storm had 
58 rebounds, making its 45.6 shooting percentage irrelevant. An errant 
shot was simply retrieved and put in the basket. ``We have a lot of 
very lively legs and a lot of very aggressive guys,'' said St. John's 
Coach Mike Jarvis, whose club averages 12 more rebounds a game than 
its opponents. ``They take it serious when we tell them that there's 
a big Whopper or something up on the rim, go get it.'' St. John's 
(8-2) is starting to get some national attention. After being left 
out of the preseason polls, the Red Storm drew whispers after almost 
defeating Stanford and Purdue. Now that it has ripped 20th-ranked 
Pittsburgh, which lost to top-ranked Connecticut Saturday by a point, 
and driven a team from the Atlantic Coast Conference out of its own 
packed gymnasium, it will likely move from 18th into the top 15. Gillen, 
who got a solid 25-point performance from freshman Chris Williams, 
says the Red Storm should rise even higher. ``I think they're a top 
10 team,'' he said. While Gillen knew before the game that St. John's 
was tough, the crowd of 8,394 _ which matched the Cavaliers' largest 
home crowd since 1995 _ had its hopes up. But six minutes before halftime, 
the Red Storm began pounding on those hopes like so many would-be 
Cavaliers rebounders. Feeding off its crowd and playing emotionally 
_ as evidenced by the two first-half technical fouls and subsequent 
ejection of Cavaliers guard Chezley Watson _ Virginia was tied with 
St. John's at 25-25. But just like that, the Red Storm scored 22 of 
the final 29 points of the half to go ahead 47-32. The Cavaliers pulled 
within 11 points twice early in the second half, but the margin began 
growing enormously after that. The game-turning run started rather 
strangely, with a missed breakaway dunk by Red Storm guard Bootsy 
Thornton (19 points). After missing the two-handed attempt, Thornton, 
who has not dunked all year, grabbed the rebound and had a shot rejected, 
then grabbed another rebound and missed. Usually, a play like that 
sparks an opponent, but this time it sparked St. John's. ``Bootsy 
is an old-time player,'' Jarvis said. ``The closer he stays to the 
ground the better. You don't do things in the game that you don't 
do in practice, and I haven't seen him dunk all year in practice. 
It was out of character for him. But the miss, I think, helped get 
the rest of our players motivated because it went away from the character 
of this team.'' No one was more motivated than Thornton, who sank 
a 3-pointer on the Red Storm's next possession. Ron Artest, who led 
St. John's with 20 points and four blocked shots, took over from there, 
swatting away a Cavaliers' attempt, hustling downcourt and hitting 
a 3-pointer on the other end to make it 31-25. Then the 6-6 forward 
blocked another shot, which led to a layup by Thornton off a beautiful 
pass from Erick Barkley (12 points, seven assists). When Artest opened 
the second half with a 3-pointer to put St. John's up by 18, the rout 
was on.
