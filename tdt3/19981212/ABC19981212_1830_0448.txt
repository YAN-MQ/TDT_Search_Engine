President Clinton was in the air when the house Judiciary committee 
was voting today. He landed a short time ago in Israel. ABC's Ann 
Compton is traveling with him. Hours before the vote that would lead 
to the end of his presidency, Mr. Clinton took his family aboard air 
force one to the flight to the Middle East leaving it to his legal 
team at the White House to complain that nothing about the process 
has been fair. The certain result would be to divide the country, 
gridlock the government and defy the will of the people. President 
Clinton arrived in Israel before midnight. Even though he'll be here 
for several days, he could lobby members of the house. Three are in 
his official party. Pennsylvanian republican John fox is not shy about 
asking President Clinton to defend himself. Certainly I want to make 
sure that whatever final judgment I make is going to be fair, is going 
to be careful. Another uncommitted republican says he will not raise 
the issue with the president. Rick looseier of New York said that 
it's getting late in the game for President Clinton to decide which 
is more important, his own career or the future of the country. Tonight, 
the White House says this is all up to the American people. One congressman 
says calls to his office are now running in favor of impeachment.
