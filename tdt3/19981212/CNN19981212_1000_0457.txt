Authorities in Thailand tell CNN they've recovered at least 7 bodies 
from the wreckage of Thai airways flight 261. They expect the death 
toll to rise further. There are 46 known survivors. The Airbus A-310 
crashed into a swamp yesterday with 146 people on board while trying 
to land during a storm. There's no word on the cause of the crash, 
but investigators have recovered the flight data recorder.
