A British woman has given birth to a baby boy three years after her 
husband's death. Diane blood's husband died in 1995, but doctors removed 
his sperm while he was on life support. After a two-year legal battle, 
the British government allowed her the right to use her husband's 
sperm to conceive. Mother and baby are doing fine. Doctors took sperm 
from her husband while he was on life support.
