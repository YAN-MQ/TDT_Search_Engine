Authorities in Thailand tell CNN they've recovered 100 bodies from 
the wreckage of Thai airways flight 261. There are 45 known survivors, 
and one person is missing. The Airbus, a 310, crashed into a swamp 
yesterday while trying to land during a storm. There's no word on 
the cause of the crash, but investigators have recovered the flight 
data recorder.
