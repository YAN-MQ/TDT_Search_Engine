President Boris Yeltsin Saturday said the five-year-old constitution 
has provided stability for Russia and he warned against making any 
changes that would return the country to its communist past. In a 
radio speech marking Constitution Day, Yeltsin said any changes to 
the constitution should be introduced with great care. ``Those feeling 
nostalgia for the old order have launched a discussion in favor of 
replacing the present constitution,'' Yeltsin said. ``They are calling 
for vesting parliament with all possible powers. They are effectively 
proposing that the country revert to being a republic of Soviets.'' 
Yeltsin said he was absolutely opposed to replacing the constitution. 
``I think this would be deadly for the country,'' he said. ``Russia, 
an immense country, must have powerful supreme authorities,'' Yeltsin 
said in the pre-recorded address. ``Without such authorities we will 
not be able to deal with the acute problems Russia is facing.'' In 
the five years since the document was approved, ``the constitution 
has more than once helped the country to remain stable,'' Yeltsin 
said. ``We have overcome this year's difficult political crises only 
because we have adhered to our fundamental law clearly and consistently.'' 
After the speech was aired, Yeltsin hosted a Kremlin reception marking 
Constitution Day in his third public appearance since Monday. The 
president was scheduled to return later to his Rus country residence, 
100 kilometers (60 miles) north of Moscow, where he has been recuperating 
after his release Wednesday from the hospital where he spent two weeks 
being treated for pneumonia, the Kremlin press service said. Yeltsin 
has spent little time at the Kremlin in recent months because of various 
illnesses, but his spokesman said his schedule will expand as his 
health improves. Next week, Yeltsin is expected to meet with visiting 
Swiss and Belarusian presidents, spokesman Dmitry Yakushkin said at 
a news conference on Friday.
