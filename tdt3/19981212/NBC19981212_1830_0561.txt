Until now, most Americans have paid little attention to the impeachment 
inquiry. The past two days have changed that U however. Our coverage 
continues with NBC's Rick Davis. It is the stuff of headlines from 
the streets of New York City to arkansas and across the country. From 
a cafe in California to the streets of New York City, word of the 
committee's call for impeachment made people talk. It doesn't have 
anything to do with anything else. He should not be impeached. His 
sex life has nothing to do with it? no. Perjury is perjury. I trust 
him. I trust his decisions. You want him thrown out? Yeah. You lied, 
that's it. That's tough. That's life. I agree that he lied, but what 
they're doing to the country by putting the country through this is 
ridiculous. a thought echoed by a republican voter in California. 
I think it's time to call a halt. We're the laughing stock of the 
world. a tourist in Washington, D.C The man did wrong. He apologized. 
The boys ought to find another game in town. In Little Rock, many 
called for punishment, but not impeachment. We should censure the 
president and be done with it. Many Americans now know the removal 
of a president could now happen and is no longer an issue that should 
be ignored.
