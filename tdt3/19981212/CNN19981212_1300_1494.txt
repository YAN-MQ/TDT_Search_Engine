A Cincinnati publisher well known for producing both pornography and 
controversy is taking a different approach. This year Larry Flynt 
is going retail. Gloria Hillard takes a look. Walk past the scented 
candles, the books and designer logo sweatshirts and hats. Maybe order 
a cafe latte or a smoothie. Welcome to Larry Flynt's latest Venture. 
Yes, Larry Flynt -- self-proclaimed king of smut and champion of free 
speech has just opened a sunset boulevard store he describes as -- 
A Barnes & Noble or maybe even a neiman-Marcus. Well, almost. Behind 
the designer partition is what we can't show you. We're hoping with 
this operation, we'll get a larger percentage of female shopping because 
they can feel much more comfortable in this place. Many women haven't 
felt comfortable with his depiction of them over the years. She's 
a killer. The 1996 film "the people vs. Larry Flynt," starring Woody 
harrelson as Flynt, introduced the controversial publisher of "hustler" 
magazine to a new generation. The pervert is back. I think Woody played 
me better than I play myself. Woody and I have become great friends 
since the movie, but Woody's in a Totally different world from me. 
Critics say the Hollywood version of "Flynt" was a sanitized picture 
of what many consider to be one of the world's most famous pornographers. 
And he may be celebrated in Hollywood, but faces obscenity charges 
in cincinnati. Yes, we've got some legal problems. We got a case scheduled 
to go on trial January 19th. He was convicted on those charges in 
1977. The trial was depicted in the film. I'm hoping that the outcome 
will be different and that I'll win the case. There is a possibility 
that I could go to jail, but I feel if something is not worth going 
to jail for, it's not worth much. Earlier this year, he took out an 
ad in "The Washington Post" offering $1 million to any woman who could 
prove she had a sexual relationship with a member of Congress. He 
plans to publish his findings early next year. If these people are 
going to sit in judgment of the president, then they should not have 
any skeletons in their own closet. Flynt says he plans to open up 
similar stores around the country. Call it the "mall-ization" of "hustler." 
Do you expect Gloria steinem will walk through that door? I think 
that's a very remote possibility. Not even for a cup of coffee or 
smoothie. Gloria Hillard, "CNN Entertainment News," Los Angeles.
