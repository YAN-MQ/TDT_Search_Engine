South Africans have been getting burned by carjackers to the tune 
of 13,000 thefts a year. Now, they can burn back. An in-car flamethrower 
called "blaster" debuted last month. If drivers are threatened by 
a would-be carjacker, they can push a button and blast the assailant 
with a burst of fire. The manufacturers say it's not designed to kill. 
They say, so far, they've sold 25 devices.
