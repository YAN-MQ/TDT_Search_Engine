This is meteorologist Valerie Voss with your "CNN Headline News" weather 
forecast for today and into Sunday. We expect to see the wet weather 
easing in Texas as low pressure moves very slowly through the gulf 
coast states and into the carolinas. Florida will see some showers 
or thunderstorms as well. It will be generally quiet from the Great 
Lakes through the plains to the southwest. But another strong storm 
is pushing into the northwest with gusty winds, some potentially heavy 
rains and also heavy mountain snow. Today's high temperatures, mostly 
30s and 40s around the country, warming to the 50s in the plains states. 
We'll see 60s and 70s over Florida and parts of the southwest. Looking 
ahead to Monday, the wet weather continues in the northwest with temperatures 
getting milder through the plains. On Tuesday, pretty quiet around 
the country with temperatures warming up a Bit in the south. Wednesday, 
snow showers in the Great Lakes, rain showers in the northwest. Temperatures 
ranging from the 20s over northern Minnesota to some 80s in southern 
Florida. Don't forget, four-day forecasts at CNN.com.
