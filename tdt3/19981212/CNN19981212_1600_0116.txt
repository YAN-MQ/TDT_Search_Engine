Yesterday, the house approved the first three articles of impeachment, 
sending them to the full house in a largely party line vote. Probably 
for a vote next week. The first article alleges the president committed 
perjury in his grand jury deposition in the Monica Lewinsky investigation. 
The second article charges the president committed perjury in his 
grand jury deposition in the Paula Jones case. And the third article 
accuses him of obstruction of justice. Sources say debate on the articles 
will begin in the full house Thursday.
