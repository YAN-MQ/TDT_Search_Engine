It is not a mirage, which might be expected in this city of man-made 
islands and cruise ships that resemble floating metropolises. Brightly 
painted wood-frame houses sit on stilts in the middle of Biscayne 
Bay, as if a relic of old Florida were making a final, defiant stand 
just east of glassy, downtown Miami. Stiltsville, as the group of 
privately owned homes is known, was for decades a raucous sea village 
with a night life that attracted local luminaries and gossip columnists. 
It evolved into a quiet hamlet of 7 houses where the main activities 
of the more than 100 homeowners who visit on weekends _ as many as 
70 people jointly own one of them _ are boating and watching sunsets. 
``You come here to get away from the world,'' said Gail Baldwin, an 
architect who owns one of the houses with two partners. ``You come 
out here just to be with yourself.'' Next summer, however, the leases 
that allow residents to keep the stilt houses on the bay are scheduled 
to expire, and homeowners may have to pay to have the homes torn down. 
For two years, residents have been negotiating with officials at Biscayne 
National Park _ Stiltsville is inside the park _ to have their 25-year 
leases extended. No agreement has been reached. In an effort to keep 
their homes, residents are seeking to have the site designated as 
a historic district in the National Register of Historic Places. Although 
such an honor would not have the force of law in preserving Stiltsville, 
the residents believe that park officials are more likely to spare 
such properties. Homeowners are working on a proposal expected to 
be submitted by year's end. Then the National Park Service, which 
oversees the National Register, will have 45 days to make a decision 
on the registry request. Environmental groups object to the existence 
of personal property, to which the public does not have access, on 
public land. ``Our concern is having these small, private preserves 
within a national park,'' said Karsten Rist, the president of the 
Tropical Audubon Society. The biggest obstacle to the preservation 
of Stiltsville may be the area's short history. Except in rare instances, 
National Register guidelines require that structures be at least 50 
years old to qualify for historic status. Threatened by hurricanes 
and surrounded by saltwater and the scourge of termites, the earliest 
Stiltsville homes are no longer standing. Karen Webster, a historian 
hired by the homeowners to help prepare their application to the National 
Register, argues that residents of Stiltsville and events that took 
place there go back more than half a century. ``Even though the buildings 
are relatively new, the site itself represents a lot of history, a 
period of human activity,'' she said. ``It's a big part of the folklore 
of Miami.'' The first record of a structure in the shallow, clear 
flats of the bay, where waters are rarely deeper than 10 feet at high 
tide, is from the 1930s when a local fisherman named ``Crawfish'' 
Eddie Walker built a one-story home out of a barge that had been grounded 
on the bay. Soon, the idea caught on and other structures, including 
homes and bars, were built. By the 1950s Stiltsville had earned a 
reputation as a watering hole for the affluent, who prized its tranquillity. 
Former Florida Gov. LeRoy Collins wrote to his friend, Jimmy Ellenberg, 
whose house at Stiltsville he frequented during this period, ``When 
the time comes when I say so long to this life, I hope the great beyond 
seems a lot like your cabin in the sea.'' Yet the floating nightclubs 
soon offered gambling and strip shows that provoked police raids. 
In 1965, state regulators curbed Stiltsville's freewheeling ways. 
New building codes were enforced and owners were required to sign 
leases and pay rent to the state for the use of the bottomlands. In 
the years that followed, fires and hurricanes destroyed 18 structures 
out of the 27 standing at the district's peak. Though smaller, Stiltsville 
nevertheless became an icon. It appeared as an exotic hideaway in 
the television show ``Miami Vice.'' Later, it served as the backdrop 
for ``Skin Tight,'' a detective novel written by Carl Hiaasen, a columnist 
for The Miami Herald. ``It's always been an intriguing and romantic 
place,'' said Hiaasen, who opposes the demolition of the homes. Although 
the properties will be worthless to the homeowners if the buildings 
are demolished, the owners say that financial gain is not their primary 
motive for keeping them, given that the constant need for repairs 
and renovation long ago made Stiltsville an unprofitable venture. 
Rather, they say, the value is sentimental. ``It's a hole for money 
that you've got to throw down every year,'' said Christopher Knight, 
a lawyer who owns one of the houses along with three partners and 
estimates that each of them spends $5,000 a year on its upkeep. ``It's 
probably the worst investment I've ever made in my life,'' Knight 
said, ``but if you grew up in south Florida, for those that like the 
bay, Stiltsville is the ultimate attraction.'' Opponents of historical 
designation say that the small number of houses and the possibility 
that salt water and bad weather will eventually destroy Stiltsville 
have quieted their objections. The residents are undeterred. Baldwin, 
who has reinforced his structure with concrete pilings and added tempered 
windows, which many homes do not have, to his wooden shutters, proudly 
notes that his house survived Hurricane Andrew, Miami's litmus test 
of storms, more or less intact. When thunder strikes, Baldwin concedes, 
he gets apprehensive. But on a balmy, clear day, when schools of jellyfish 
and stingrays dance by in near perfect unison, all concerns vanish 
and he can bask in Stiltsville's most popular pastime: relaxing. ``I 
just sit and read and have dinner and watch football,'' he said. ``Food. 
A lot of it stems around food.''
