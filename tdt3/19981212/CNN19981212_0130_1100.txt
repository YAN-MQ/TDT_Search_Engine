A faster way to send a holiday greeting became slower for some people 
this week. Users of AT&T worldnet clogged the online service with 
E-mails containing graphics and audio, which take more space than 
text messages, and take longer to transmit. The result -- thousands 
of customers faced delays of up to 45 minutes for sending and receiving 
E-mail Wednesday, with shorter delays Thursday. The company says there 
were no messages lost during the slowdown.
