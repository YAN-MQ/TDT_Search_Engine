The house Judiciary committee has one more impeachment article to 
deal with today. And that is, whether President William Jefferson 
Clinton abused the powers of his office, to conceal his relationship 
with Monica Lewinsky. Right now, the committee is considering a republican 
amendment to article four. The proposed amendment would remove sections 
which refer to executive privilege. A vote on article four is expected 
sometime this afternoon. The committee will also consider, later, 
a democratic motion to censure, rather than impeach, Mr. Clinton. 
As with the other articles of impeachment, democrats and republicans 
on the committee remain divided over the issue of abuse of power. 
The allegations in the article is that he had frivolous claims of 
executive privilege, a presidential prerogative for really private 
conduct in this case and the court said so. In addition, lying to 
aides and then thirdly, which is very offensive to me, is the 81 questions 
that everyone in Congress reacted to. That his answers were arrogant, 
they were not responsive, and really showed a defiance of Congress 
and their responsibility under the constitution. This has never happened 
before. We should have heard from witnesses, number one. Secondly, 
lying under oath about clearly consensual sexual conduct is simply 
not impeachable. Today's action follows a day of high drama yesterday, 
during which the committee voted almost exclusively along party lines 
to send three articles of impeachment to the house floor. Article 
one charges the president committed perjury during his deposition 
to a grand jury investigating the Monica Lewinsky matter. It was approved 
21-16. Article two charges the president with perjury in the Paula 
Jones deposition. It passed 20-17. And article three, obstruction 
of justice, was approved 21-16. All house members have been told to 
be ready to return to Capitol Hill next thursday to take up the impeachment 
debate.
