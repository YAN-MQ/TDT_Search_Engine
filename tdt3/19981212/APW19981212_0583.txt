Ukraine's parliament has moved to support domestic alcohol producers 
by sharply raising tax rates on imported alcoholic beverages and by 
cutting the taxes imposed on Ukrainian producers, according to a news 
report Saturday. In a law approved on Friday, lawmakers increased 
by at least 50 percent the taxes imposed on imported ethyl alcohol, 
as well as on beer and various types of wine, the Interfax news agency 
said. Simultaneously, parliament lowered by up to 50 percent the taxes 
to be paid by Ukrainian producers of the same beverages. The law, 
which has to be signed by President Leonid Kuchma within 15 days to 
become effective, would favor Ukrainian alcohol manufacturers. They 
have complained that taxes are so high, they cannot pay them without 
being forced to go out of business. Ukrainian leaders have been trying 
for the last two years to impose effective control over domestic alcohol 
and tobacco production in an attempt to raise much-needed budget revenues. 
Alcohol taxes have been changed several times this year, but the measures 
so far have failed to curtail a widespread black-market trade in the 
goods.
