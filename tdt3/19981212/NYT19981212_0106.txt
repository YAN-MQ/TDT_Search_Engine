A senior official in charge of protecting refugees said that tougher 
qualifications for asylum in both rich and poor countries are threatening 
the lives and safety of displaced people almost everywhere. Dennis 
McNamara, director of international protection for the U.N. High Commissioner 
for Refugees in Geneva, said at a news briefing Friday that the challenge 
to his office was ``the most severe that we have faced in decades.'' 
He singled out the United States as a major problem. McNamara said 
the refugee agency was lobbying governments and private organizations 
in the United States and around the world to reconsider newly restrictive 
policies on asylum and ``to to try to mobilize a reinvigorated, expanded, 
renewed coalition in support of the refugee protection system.'' ``We 
are very worried that this fragile system can only work effectively 
if it has proper support, particularly from states, but also from 
the public in general,'' he said. McNamara said that millions of refugees 
were being boxed in between tighter asylum policies and immigration 
laws in the industrialized nations and the countries of the Third 
World. In the richer countries, he said, there is ``increasing restrictiveness 
to admission of asylum seekers and refugees and the mixing up of refugees 
and illegal migration, drug trafficking, terrorist issues to the detriment 
of asylum seekers.'' This was compounded, he said, by ``a generally 
increasing noninternational approach to the protection of refugees, 
in some cases going so far as legal restrictions on the refugee definition 
and applying the refugee convention.'' ``And I am afraid to say that 
that approach is reflected also in this country, in the United States,'' 
he said. ``Our main donor, our main supporter, with a proud history 
of refugee involvement, has in place some of the most severe restrictions 
in its history, which affect asylum seekers and refugees trying to 
enter the United States.'' The poorer nations have taken a cue from 
the policies of the United States and Europe, he said. ``Many countries 
of the developing south have said enough is enough,'' he said. ``Countries 
of Africa, Asia and elsewhere who have hosted refugees _ large numbers, 
many millions for many years _ are starting to say: `The burden is 
not equally shared. We are no longer prepared just to have our borders 
open.' So we have an export value also of negative practice from the 
developed regions to the south to the detriment of asylum seekers 
and refugees in many cases.'' Turning again to the United States, 
McNamara said that immigration officials here were often out of line 
with internationally accepted procedures. ``Expedited removals from 
U.S. airports do not, in our view, meet the minimum standards of due 
process, in many cases,'' he said. ``Immigration officials doing those 
determinations, which may affect the future well-being of those individuals, 
are not necessarily trained adequately to do so.'' McNamara, who was 
in New York as part of events this week marking the 50th anniversary 
of the Universal Declaration of Human Rights, was also critical of 
American detention practices, including the mixing of asylum seekers 
with criminals and the treatment of women and children. He called 
on the United States and other governments to adhere to international 
conventions they have signed. On Thursday, marking Human Rights Day 
at the White House, President Clinton announced new procedures for 
dealing with children in asylum cases. The move was welcomed by advocates 
of better refugee protection, led by the New York-based Women's Commission 
for Refugee Women and Children, an organization that worked with the 
federal Immigration and Naturalization Service to develop the new 
guidelines.
