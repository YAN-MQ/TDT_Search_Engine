Man, that Chili was hot. You got heartburn, too? Yeah. Wanna try these 
new pepcid ac chewables? It says you gotta take it with water. What's 
the water for? With tums, you don't need water. Just because new pepcid 
is chewable doesn't mean it works like tums. Tums calcium knocks out 
heartburn fast. Pepcid chewables' famotidine has to go through your 
bloodstream, so it takes 40 minutes just to start working. You wanna 
go back for water? Forget the water. Pass the tums. Tums ta tum tum 
tums well, when I think... about not being able to see, it's overwhelming. 
I went to the doctor at Lenscrafters... for a regular eye exam. He 
thought he saw a problem. Working with Lenscrafters, I have everything 
I need to give an accurate prescription. But with Elaine, something 
strange showed up. I checked her for glauco. I did have the earliest 
stages of glaucoma. I was able to catch something... before it was 
really going to start to affect her life. He helped save my eyesight.
