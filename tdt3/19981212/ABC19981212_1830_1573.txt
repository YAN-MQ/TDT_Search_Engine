Finally tonight -- it seems a bit incongruous. A congressional committee 
has passed articles of impeachment that could result in the president 
of the United States being removed from office. Yet if the American 
people are taking notice, there are not many that are deeply concerned. 
To get a sense of how the public has reacted to the house committee 
debate these last two days, here's ABC's Mike Von Fremd. At least 
one house Judiciary committee member has a dire warning about where 
this impeachment process is headed. If you are sick of all Monica 
all the time, you ain't seen nothing yet. Be prepared to turn on your 
TV and watch the chief justice of the Supreme Court swear in lucianne 
Goldberg, Linda Tripp, and testimony in front of the whole world. 
But the whole world does not seem to be watching. Not here in Columbus, 
Ohio. At this point, I don't care anymore. I'm just tired of all of 
it. In shopping malls from Los Angeles to Chicago to Washington, christmas 
shoppers passed by banks of TV screens that were tuned into sports 
today, not the historic impeachment hearings. I'm not going to watch 
it. I don't like it. I'd rather be shopping. In July of 1974, the 
Judiciary committee debate over Watergate had Americans glued to their 
TV sets -- 71% of American homes were tuned in. The broadcast networks 
carried none of today's debate. Cable networks such as CNN say their 
audience for these impeachment hearings is less than one-third the 
number of viewers who watched the O.J. simpson trial or Clarence Thomas 
hearings. People are sick of the story because they've been inundated 
by the media for 11 months now, and nobody really believes in the 
end that the president will be kicked out of office. They may not 
believe he will be kicked out of office, but the latest ABC News poll 
finds that 86% now think the president did lie under oath. But the 
poll also finds that 60% of Americans say Mr. Clinton should not be 
impeached or removed from office. The White House is counting on that 
60% to get upset about the hearings and give their congressman an 
earful. If TV ratings are a barometer, many who feel the president 
should stay have decided to tune out. Mike Von Fremd, ABC News, the 
White House.
