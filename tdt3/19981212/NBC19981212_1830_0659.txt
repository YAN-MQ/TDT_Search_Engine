When "NBC nightly news" continues from Washington -- the president's 
foreign policy problem. Leaving the troubles at home, only to fly 
into a troubled and tenuous Middle East. And later -- it's almost 
routine. The "endeavour" astronauts -- another day, another spacewalk. 
By the end of the week, seven more lives will be saved. By the end 
of the day, sixteen people who couldn't walk, will. By the end of 
the hour, these special filters will help make twenty-five thousand 
more gallons of water ready for drinking. And by the end of this message 
one more premature baby will be protected. All of which is made possible 
with the help of a material we call plastic. A ouncing an amazing 
discovery. One-A-day has combined the power of herbs with vitamins... 
to help you during the cold season. Support your mood, even memory. 
New from one-A-day. Just what you need to feel your best. Okay, you 
probably think they look alike. But with gateway you get basic help 
over the phone for as long as you own it. After a month, you pay for 
it. Here, you get a color printer. Nope, not here. This one you can 
trade in toward the purchase of a new one after two years. Yours forever.
