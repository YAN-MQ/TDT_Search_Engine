Rep. Bob Livingston, the Metairie Republican who takes over as Speaker 
of the House next month, is taking a wait-and-see attitude regarding 
the possible impeachment or censure of the president. Some from in 
and around his New Orleans-area district are more bold. A sampling 
of opinions: ``I'm sick of it, but more I'm sick of him,'' said Lavelle 
Cannon, a woman in her 50s who was eating dinner at a food court in 
Metairie. She believes Clinton should be impeached. ``I think he abused 
his office,'' she said. ___ Liam Doughty, also visiting the mall, 
and in his early 30s, also said impeachment is called for. ``I want 
to see him get impeached. I think that he's liar.'' ___ Clyde Kerr, 
a clerk at The Gap said he likes Clinton, but that does not mean impeachment 
is not a fit punishment. ``If he's been cited as doing wrong, he should 
be impeached...I still like him. He balanced the budget. He's human.'' 
___ Just before Livingston spoke at Saturday's commencement exercises 
at Southeastern Louisiana University, he met with alumni who graduated 
50 or more years ago. Among them was Ted Albin of Livingston, member 
of the class of '48, who said later in an interview that he does not 
want Clinton impeached. ``Too many people have too many skeletons 
in their closets to be up there trying to judge,'' Albin said. Marguerite 
Clement, also of the class of 1948, and from Hammond, La., also opposed 
impeachment. ``I just don't think what he's done is impeachable,'' 
she said. ___ Nursing graduate Terri Tillis said the answer was plain 
and simple as she was interviewed during SLU commencement exercises 
at Hammond. ``Should he be impeached? Yes. He lied.'' s lakm20 la
