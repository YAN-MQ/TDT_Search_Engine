European Union leaders agreed Saturday to look again at an impending 
tax-free shopping ban, but stopped short of granting a reprieve for 
the perk that lets millions of travelers snap up liquor, tobacco and 
other bargains. They released a statement calling for a three-month 
study into potential job losses by the scheduled abolition in June 
of duty-free sales for travel within the 15-nation Union. At a summit, 
the leaders held out the possibility of a ``limited extension'' of 
duty-free shopping. ``The door is now open (for) an extension of time 
on duty free,'' said British Prime Minister Tony Blair, who led the 
campaign to preserve it. The EU voted unanimously in 1991 to abolish 
tax-free shopping, claiming it was incompatible with the notion of 
a seamless EU market. The ban would only affect sales for travelers 
within the EU. Those traveling to or from the Union will still be 
able to enjoy tax-free shopping. Blair, backed by his German and French 
counterparts, campaigned to overturn the 1991 decision to scrap duty 
free by next summer.
