In sports, a day to remember. Pitcher Kevin brown has signed a new 
contract with the Los Angeles Dodgers, and it's a big one. In fact, 
it is huge. It's the most lucrative deal in the history of baseball. 
Great for brown, but is it good for the game? Here's ABC's Mark Mullen. 
Got him over the outside corner, strikeout number five. Many baseball 
teams courted pitcher Kevin brown. But in the end, the 33-year-old 
right-hander decided on the L.A. Dodgers. A seven-year contract worth 
a record $105 million may have had something to do with it. I think 
the only thing that it really means is that pitching is a valuable 
commodity these days. The number one pitcher is a real commodity. 
He helped the Florida Marlins win the world series and the San diego 
padres make it there. But the single factor perhaps most responsible 
for brown's record salary is the ambition of Rupert Murdoch. The media 
mogul who bought the Dodgers last March for a record $311 million 
has spent millions more upgrading the team. With today's announcement, 
Murdoch did what critics had feared -- paid a Record salary to acquire 
a big name player. Bad news for teams in smaller cities which don't 
have that kind of cash to get players. Already, it's been a record 
signing season. The red sox Mt. Vaughn, Arizona's Randy Johnson, and 
New York's Mike piazza, all are making at least $13 million a year. 
Ultimately, those salaries are paid for by the fans. Dodgers are probably 
going to win the N.L. west now, I'm sure. I guess Murdoch bought it. 
Fans may not stay shocked at his salary for long. Mark McGwire would 
earn more if he becomes a free agent down the road. Mark Mullen, ABC
