Nebraska senator Bob Kerrey will end a measure of suspense tomorrow, 
when he announces whether he will seek the democratic nomination for 
president in 2000. Kerrey plans to solicit advice from close friends 
and supporters tomorrow in Omaha, and will likely announce immediately 
after whether he will run. Kerrey has run for president once before, 
in 1992, when he was beaten for the nomination by Bill Clinton.
