The growing international space station was made possible partly because 
of years of planning and research. Decades of imagination may also 
deserve some credit. Garrick Utley reports. The wonder of science 
fiction of a space station docking in "2001: a space Odyssey." The 
reality of docking on the current mission to build an international 
space station. How well do fiction and reality meet in space? Look 
at the vision of artist chesley bonestell in 1952, long before the 
first man went into space. There is the shuttle with wings. There 
are the astronauts on their space walks, and an orbiting space station. 
Vincent Di fate is a leading illustrator of space, and understands 
the purpose of science fiction in words and images. Whether they were 
accurate or not, and many of them proved not to be accurate, they 
created a credible vision for a time when people needed some means 
to accept ideas about the future and the possibilities of space development. 
Space is fascinating. It is also infinite, and that can make it difficult 
for mere mortals to grasp. Not only those of us who are only occasionally 
interested in space exploration, but also those who devote their lives 
to it. They, too, need inspiration, that jolt of a new idea. Jules 
Verne provided the first jolt in 1865, describing a rocket fired from 
a Cannon that goes to the Moon. The pioneers of Rockets, including 
Robert Goddard, read Verne, and H.G. wells and others, as they developed 
Rockets that would eventually take man to the Moon. More than a decade 
before the launch of the first satellite, science fiction writer Arthur 
Clarke predicted how a few communications satellites could link the 
entire planet. John mankins works at NASA, imagining new programs 
and concepts. His plan for a magnetic levitation launch system, he 
says, is remarkably similar to one that appeared in the SCI-fi movie 
"when worlds collide." A lot of what we do in developing advanced 
concepts -- ideas about what the future of the space program might 
be 10, 20, 30 years from now -- is influenced by what we see in science 
fiction, in books or in movies. And why not? Science, like fiction, 
begins with imagination. And in space, as in fiction, there are no 
limits to where imagination can take you. Garrick Utley, CNN, New 
York.
