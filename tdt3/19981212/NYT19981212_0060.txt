The president's refrain today is: Don't impeach me; censure me. But 
back in 1834, the argument was the other way around: Don't censure 
me; impeach me. That was the gist of President Andrew Jackson's written 
protest to the Senate against its 26-20 censure of his effort to scuttle 
the national bank. In effect, the president was admonishing legislators 
for running roughshod over the Constitution. (Does that ring a bell? 
Some things never change.) Here are excerpts from Jackson's protest. 
_ TOM KUNTZ ``The resolution of the Senate is wholly unauthorized 
by the Constitution, and in derogation of its entire spirit. It assumes 
that a single branch of the legislative department may for the purposes 
of a public censure, and without any view to legislation or impeachment, 
take up, consider, and decide upon the official acts of the Executive. 
. . . It is only in the exercise of its judicial powers, when sitting 
as a court for the trial of impeachments, that the Senate is expressly 
authorized . . . to consider and decide upon the conduct of the President. 
. . . The Constitution declares that ``the President, Vice President 
and all civil officers of the United States shall be removed from 
office on impeachment for and conviction of treason, bribery or other 
high crimes and misdemeanors''; that the House of Representatives 
``shall have the sole power of impeachment''; that the Senate ``shall 
have the sole power to try all impeachments''; . . . (and) that ``no 
person shall be convicted without the concurrence of two-thirds of 
the members present.'' . . . The President of the United States, therefore, 
has been by a majority of his constitutional triers accused and found 
guilty of an impeachable offense, but in no part of this proceeding 
have the directions of the Constitution been observed. The impeachment, 
instead of being preferred and prosecuted by the House of Representatives, 
originated in the Senate, and was prosecuted without the aid or concurrence 
of the other House. The oath or affirmation prescribed by the Constitution 
was not taken by the senators, the Chief Justice did not preside, 
no notice of the charge was given to the accused, and no opportunity 
afforded him to respond to the accusation.''
