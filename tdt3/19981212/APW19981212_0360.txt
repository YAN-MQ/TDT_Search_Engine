Sitting at the wheel of an Italian-made speedboat racing past the 
green mountains sloping down to Lake Tangyanika, a rebel commander 
said Saturday that his troops were poised to capture the last government 
stronghold on the vast central African lake. Col. Nora Songolo said 
his forces, backed by Rwanda and more recently Burundi, were in control 
of all other towns on the western shore of 720-kilometer-long (450 
mile) lake and were fighting to capture Molira, on the border with 
Zambia. ``We control the lake,'' Col. Nora Songolo said. ``We are 
about to capture Molira.'' The rebels and their Rwandan allies use 
the fiberglass speedboats mounted with antiaircraft guns to move swiftly 
and fire on government fighter jets whose regular raids have slowed 
but not stopped rebel advances in eastern Congo. Songolo said the 
rebels were in control of the airstrip and fishing village of Moba, 
160 kilometers (100 miles) north of Molira, dismissing government 
claims of a successful counteroffensive. But the rebels have yet to 
convince war-weary fishermen and farmers to return to their abandoned 
hamlet, Songolo said. Most of Moba's mud brick and straw roof houses 
have stood empty since the town fell to rebels a month ago. The few 
remaining residents said their relatives and friends were hesitant 
to come back, afraid of either the new army or air strikes by Zimbabwe, 
President Laurent Kabila's main ally in the four-month war. But the 
most difficult challenge facing the rebel coalition of ethnic Tutsis, 
disaffected Congolese soldiers and opposition politicians who took 
up arms against Kabila on Aug. 2, is convincing Kabila's Baluba tribesmen 
in the Katanga region to cooperate. Right now, Songolo, himself a 
defector from Lubumbashi, Katanga's capital, said the priority was 
getting Kabila to negotiate peace directly with the rebels. So far, 
Kabila has refused, saying the rebels are pawns of their backers, 
Rwanda and Uganda. His refusal has torpedoed international and regional 
efforts to negotiate a cease-fire. A summit in the Zambian capital, 
Lusaka, originally scheduled for Dec. 14-15 to sign a cease-fire proposed 
by U.N. Secretary-General Kofi Annan in Paris last month, has been 
postponed. The meeting will be on Dec. 28, the Zambian government 
said Saturday, to give officials time to drum up support for peace 
efforts.
