The New York Times said in an editorial for Sunday, Dec. 12: What 
is perhaps most exhilarating about the $76 million agreement to save 
about 300,000 acres of forests and wetlands in New York, Vermont and 
New Hampshire is the quality of the land itself. Almost a third of 
the vast acreage to be sold by Champion International would become 
a vital preserve, protecting wildlife and watersheds, as well as areas 
of surpassing natural beauty. These lands feature 13 mountain peaks 
in New Hampshire, sensitive wetlands and river frontage in northeastern 
Vermont and 29,000 acres within New York's Adirondacks that include 
one of the most majestic boreal forests in the country. These woods 
also serve as habitat to dozens of creatures from the showshoe hare 
to the amazing carnivorous sundew plant that dines on some of the 
northern forest's most irritating insects. The other two-thirds of 
the land, more than 200,000 acres, would include ``working forests'' 
where, ideally, controlled logging is balanced against preservation 
and such recreations as hiking, skiing, mountain biking and snowmobiling. 
In some of these areas, forest lovers will gain access to miles of 
lakes, rivers and waterfalls that have been within private properties 
for over 100 years. Masterminding this complicated agreement is a 
nonprofit conservation group in Virginia called the Conservation Fund, 
one of several such organizations trying to preserve massive tracts 
of forest land that are rapidly being sold off by timber and paper 
companies. What is still at risk for this sale, however, is the Vermont 
part of the package, where federal, state and private sources must 
still come up with about half of the $26.5 million required. The New 
Hampshire parcel, the smallest of the three, is important but not 
vital for the deal. New York state is the most prepared of the three 
to complete its share of this bargain _ thanks to preservation bonds 
authorized by voters two years ago and a strong endorsement by Gov. 
George Pataki. Of the 144,000 acres in New York, logging would be 
allowed on 110,000 acres, under state rules that should insure trees 
are not cut faster than new ones can grow. Using $24.9 million of 
the 1996 Clean Water/Clean Air Bond Act, New York would buy ``conservation 
easements,'' or agreements from logging companies to limit cutting, 
and would also purchase the 29,000 Adirondack acres outright to be 
protected under the state's ``Forever Wild'' law. The state still 
must decide whether this parcel, most of it in the northern and western 
sections of Adirondack Park, deserves extra protection as a wild forest 
area, with some roadways, or as a wilderness area, where no vehicles 
are allowed, even mountain bikes. Included in the remaining 5,000 
acres are a 1,000-acre hunt club that stays intact and a parcel outside 
the park that will be sold without state easements. While the states 
and the environmentalists will need to monitor carefully these ``conservation 
easements,'' the entire plan, which has the support of most major 
conservation groups, is vastly better than some of the other possibilities 
for these forest tracts as timber companies put their lands up for 
sale under pressure from stockholders. Compare these efforts with 
the tragedy in Maine, where this year alone more than 2 million acres 
of forest have been sold, with less than 2,000 acres set aside for 
preservation.
