European Union leaders on Saturday deplored recurring violence in 
the West Bank as well as Israel's setting of new conditions for its 
continued troop withdrawal from the territories. In a draft statement 
at the end of their two-day year-end summit, the 15 EU leaders called 
on both Palestinians and Israelis to show restraint. ``While noting 
the progress made to date by both sides in implementing the (Wye River) 
Memorandum, the European Council deplores the recent violence, mutual 
recrimination and the setting of new conditions which threaten to 
unravel the fragile peace progress since Wye,'' the leaders said. 
Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu began backing off from the 
Wye agreement almost as soon as he got home from signing it in the 
United States in October, making new demands on Palestinian leader 
Yasser Arafat before the Israeli government would move ahead with 
further withdrawals. ``The European Council calls on the parties to 
show restraint and to implement fully, in time and in good faith, 
the remaining provisions and thereby contribute to the rebuilding 
of the confidence essential to the completion of the peace process.'' 
The EU is the largest collective donor to the Palestinians.
