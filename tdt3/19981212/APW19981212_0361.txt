An inventor says he has a radical solution to South Africa's soaring 
carjacking rate: barbecue the carjackers. The ``Blaster'' anti-hijacking 
system is essentially a flame-thrower installed on a car's undercarriage. 
It directs flames, fed by four gas jets mounted under the doors, out 
both sides of a car without singeing the vehicle itself. Police Superintendent 
David Walkley says the device is legal and in fact has one installed 
on his own car, the Saturday Star reported. ``It is a lot less extreme 
than a firearm,'' the policeman was quoted as saying in the Johannesburg 
weekly. Inventor Charles Fourie says he has already installed the 
Blaster, which is activated by a foot switch, on 25 cars. ``This system 
... will stop the hijacker in his tracks,'' Fourie told Associated 
Press Television News. ``He will never get your car.'' During a demonstration, 
the Blaster incinerated a dummy that had been placed outside the car 
next to the driver's window. But so far, the system remains untested 
in a real situation. A carjacker could theoretically fire a gun at 
the driver before or after jumping away from the flames. And because 
the flames blast out from both sides of the car and cannot be aimed, 
there is nothing to prevent an innocent bystander from being torched.
