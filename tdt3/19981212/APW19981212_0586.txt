Eight people were killed in two days of violence around Algeria and 
the tortured body of a young soldier was found, the press reported 
Saturday. Six people, including at least one policeman, were killed 
Wednesday at a fake roadblock set up in an isolated bend in the road 
at Maamar, a village near Tizi Ouzou, capital of the Kabyle region 
about 100 kilometers (60 miles) east of Algiers. Some 20 armed men 
reportedly set up the road block -- a technique used frequently by 
armed groups since the start of an Islamic insurgency in 1992. A school 
bus and two cars, all burned, were still at the site two days later, 
according to the privately-owned paper Liberte. There was no mention 
of whether children were among the victims. On Thursday, the tortured 
body of a young soldier kidnapped a day earlier was found in Maamar. 
The victim's throat was slit and his genitals crushed, the papers 
said, quoting family members. The body of another kidnap victim, a 
local chief of Kadiria, near Bouira, 120 kms (75 miles) east of the 
capital, was found on Friday, Liberte and other papers reported. The 
official was kidnapped at the end of November. Daily violence has 
been a part of life in Algeria since the army canceled 1992 legislative 
elections that a now-banned Muslim fundamentalist party, the Islamic 
Salvation Front, was poised to win. The move triggered the insurgency. 
An estimated 75,000 people have been killed in the violence.
