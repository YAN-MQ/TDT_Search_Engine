Guyana has canceled the work permit for an Islamic cleric jailed in 
the United States for the past 18 months because of secret evidence 
allegedly linking him to Mideast terrorists. The decision probably 
means that Mazen Al-Naijar, a former professor at the University of 
South Florida and the leader of a Tampa mosque, will remain in jail 
until another country agrees to take him. U.S. authorities accused 
Al-Naijar of having links to a Mideast terrorist group and the Immigration 
and Naturalization Service ordered him deported, but so far no country 
has agreed to accept him. Al-Naijar denies the accusations and says 
he is a peaceful advocate of Palestinian rights. Al-Naijar has been 
jailed under a law that allows alleged terrorists to be held without 
their being allowed to see the evidence against them. The Central 
Islamic Organization of Guyana won a work permit to allow Al-Naijar 
to come to the South American country for a year to teach, but Prime 
Minister Sam Hinds said Saturday that the permit for Al-Naijar and 
his family had been revoked because of the accusations against him 
in the United States.
