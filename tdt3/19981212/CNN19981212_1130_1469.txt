As of January, the famous yellow pages fingers will be walking away 
for good. The president of the yellow pages publishers association 
say it's time to reshape the image of the directory into more of a 
consumer resource guide. The fingers will be replaced by a light bulb, 
and the familiar slogan "let your fingers do the walking" will be 
replaced with "get an idea."
