With less than two weeks left until Christmas, you may still be looking 
for just the right gift. If so, pay close attention to the suggestions 
of Stephanie Oswald in today's edition of "working ahead." It's an 
exciting gift to get because it means an adventure, it means a Trip. 
The American society of travel agents says travel gifts top most people's 
wish lists. You can do something in just about any price range. I 
mean, you can buy a $10,000 cruise all the way down to a $10 gadget 
in a Travel store. You don't have to worry that they're already going 
to have it. Everybody has a trip they have yet to take. Asta says 
most people want cruises, followed by gift certificates, trips to 
Las Vegas and Disney, then weekend getaways, airline tickets and hotel 
packages. Online travel sites such as msn expedia offer a wealth of 
travel experiences, from golf trips to ski adventures. An all-in-one 
inclusive vacation -- something where they can take their family or 
take friends, take loved ones along with them. But a gift certificate 
may be the best present. People can then use it at their convenience, 
ultimately, and to go where they want to go. Many airlines, hotels 
and cruise lines offer gift certificates or buy one from a travel 
agent for a complete vacation package. Keep in mind, most certificates 
expire within a year, blackout dates may apply and trips taken with 
certificates won't earn the recipient frequent-flier miles. But you 
might earn airline miles or hotel points buying the certificate, giving 
yourself a little gift. Stephanie Oswald, CNN, reporting.
