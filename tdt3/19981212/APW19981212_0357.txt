Clashes between separatist guerrillas and army soldiers in the war-torn 
north left 17 rebels dead, the military said Saturday. Five rebels 
were killed by soldiers near the government controlled Oddusuddan 
town in northeastern Mullaitivu district on Friday, the Defense Ministry 
said. Mullaitivu is 260 kilometers (160 miles) northeast of the capital 
Colombo. In separate confrontations in nearby districts Friday, troops 
gunned down 12 rebels, the military said. Last week, the military 
captured Oddusuddan in a renewed push against the main Tamil Tiger 
rebels. Independent confirmation is impossible as journalists are 
barred from the war zone. A censorship has been in force since June 
5 and journalists have had to submit their stories to a military official 
for clearance. But, in a move designed to placate critics, the government 
on Friday shifted censorship of the news of the country's civil war 
from the military and appointed a civilian official to screen reports. 
Tamil guerrillas are fighting for a homeland in the northeast for 
the country's minority ethnic Tamils who claim discrimination from 
the majority Sinhalese who dominate the government and the military.
