Overall Alpine World Cup champion Hermann Maier is being urged by 
the Austrian Ski Federation to immediately end his association with 
a former East German doctor recently convicted of administering performance-enhancing 
drugs. Austrian federation president and Maier's personal manager 
Peter Schroecksnadel told Saturday's Frankfurter Allgemeinen Zeitung 
that physiologist Bernd Pansold was hurting the sport. ``As big an 
authority as Pansold is, he's damaging Austrian ski sport more with 
his reputation at the moment than his sizeable knowledge can help,'' 
Schroecksnadel told the German daily. Maier, the reigning overall 
and super-giant slalom World Cup champion, trains at the Obertauern 
independent Olympic training center in Austria where Pansold works. 
A Berlin court last week found the former East German doctor guilty 
of administering performance-enhancing drugs to nine underage athletes 
from 1975-84 even though he knew they were dangerous. He was fined 
dlrs 8,200. Maier told the Franfurter Allgemeinen Zeitung that Pansold 
regularly checks his lactate level but doesn't dictate or administer 
his training plan. The skier said he paid around dlrs 3,000 for Pansold's 
services last year out of his own pocket. ``I train at the (Obertauern) 
sports center but my trainer is Berg Mueller,'' Maier has said. A 
dual gold medal winner at the Nagano Olympics, Maier earned the nickname 
``the Herminator'' for his powerful build and skiing style. Swiss 
ski boss Theo Nadig stirred controversy in late October when he said 
a diet of pasta and granola could not explain Maier's rapid physical 
development. Maier, who won the World Cup title in only his first 
full season on the circuit, had failed to make Austrian ski teams 
as a youth because of weak knees and joints. However, always claimed 
working as a bricklayer strengthened his body.
