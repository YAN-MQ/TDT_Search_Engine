A Senate republican is looking beyond the political storm to spring. 
Senator Greg says the government some commit to fix social security. 
Greg used the republican radio address to call on the president to 
work towards that goal. While he praised Mr. Clinton for convening 
last week's summit on the issue, greg says much work needs to be done. 
This is an issue that can't be treated as politics as usual. The American 
people deserve to know that their leaders will make every effort to 
work together, to produce one proposal by early spring, which will 
have the support of both the president and the congressional leadership. 
Analysts estimate the Serb security system could go bankrupt in 30 
years if it's not fixed.
