This is meteorologist Valerie Voss with the "CNN Headline News Weather" 
forecast for today and into Sunday. A slow-moving area of low pressure 
will move from the gulf coast states through the carolinas and Florida, 
producing generally some light rain and possibly a few thunderstorms 
in Florida. It will be quiet from New England through the Great Lakes 
and plains states to the southwest. But a strong storm, once again, 
will move into the northwest with some heavy rains, mountain snows 
and strong and gusty winds. Highs today, mostly 30s, 40s and 50s around 
the country. A few 60s and 70s across Florida and in the desert southwest. 
Looking ahead to Monday -- the rain and snow and wind pushed toward 
the northern rocky mountains with some lingering showers in Florida. 
On Tuesday, cooler air is accompanying that into the northern plains 
states. We'll see a few snowshowers over the upper midwest. Rain showers 
in the northwest. Wednesday, same situation. Temperatures range from 
20s and 30s north to 60s and 70s south. Don't forget, four-day forecasts 
for more than 7,200 cities at CNN.com.
