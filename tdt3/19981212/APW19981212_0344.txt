Fourteen years after he came to power in a military coup, President 
Lansana Conte is set to face his second presidential elections Monday. 
But there are few people in this West African country who think Conte 
faces much serious opposition. Backed by government funding, military 
support, control of the broadcast media and a political party that 
is tightly entwined with the government, even Conte's opponents say 
he'll win the Dec. 14 vote. ``It's impossible for an opposition candidate 
to win the elections,'' Mohamed Diane, a top official in the Rally 
of the Guinean People said in a recent interview. ``The government 
has created the facade of democracy.'' But still hoping it can make 
some campaign headway and claiming that only 40 percent of the electorate 
has received their voter cards, the opposition has asked that the 
elections be put off for a month. ``Wisdom demands that such a request 
be accepted ... to avoid trouble that may have unforeseeable consequences,'' 
the Rally of the Guinean People said in a statement. The government, 
however, dismisses those demands. Kader Sangari, an Interior Ministry 
official handling logistical planning for the balloting, said that 
between 95 percent and 98 percent of voters had received their cards. 
He also promised a free and transparent election, despite the opposition 
claims to the contrary. The opposition also lashed out at the 1993 
presidential elections _ the first multiparty presidential vote since 
independence from France in 1958 _ saying they had been rigged in 
Conte's favor. Conte, who seized power in 1984 just after the death 
of Guinea's former dictator, Sekou Toure, faces four opponents in 
Monday's voting. Alpha Conde, one of the two prominent opposition 
candidates, faced Conte in the 1993 elections and recently returned 
from a self-imposed exile in Senegal. He heads the Rally of the Guinean 
People. The other prominent candidate, Mamadou Ba, the leader of the 
Union for Progress and Renewal, is believed to have widespread support 
in part of the country's interior. In recent months, Mamadou Ba was 
briefly arrested and a number of supporters of the Rally of the Guinean 
People were also detained in what the opposition called a crackdown. 
The other two candidates are not believed to have much support. Guinea, 
which has an average per capita income of just a few hundred dollars 
a year and an illiteracy rate of 75-80 percent, is still recovering 
from the brutal 26-year regime of Toure, who ruled a one-party Marxist 
state that terrorized its people with imagined plots and widespread 
arrests. Thousands of people died in Toure's prison camps and by the 
time of his death some 2 million people had fled the country. While 
Conte's regime allows much more political freedom than Toure's _ independent 
newspapers, for instance, now regularly criticize and ridicule the 
government _ critics say Conte turned more autocratic after a 1996 
military revolt. Conte faced a military mutiny then in which 2,000 
of Guinea's 8,500-member armed forces rampaged through Conakry, the 
capital, demanding back pay and dismissal of the defense minister. 
At least 30 people are believed to have died. Conte put down the rebellion 
by promising pay raises and better rations.
