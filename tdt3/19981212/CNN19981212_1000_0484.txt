One witness said it was like an earthquake. A natural gas explosion 
in downtown St. cloud, Minnesota, yesterday killed four people and 
injured 16 others. Investigators say they don't know what ignited 
the gas, which apparently came from a pipeline broken by construction 
workers. Two of the workers were among the dead. The explosion destroyed 
three buildings and sent debris a block away. St. cloud is about 70 
miles northwest of Minneapolis.
