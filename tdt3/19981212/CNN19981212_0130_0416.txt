Four people have been killed in a natural gas explosion in downtown 
St. cloud, Minnesota. The blast leveled a closed pizza parlor, damaged 
neighboring buildings and shattered windows in buildings and cars 
for several blocks. Rescue workers are still looking for anyone who 
might be trapped in the wreckage. A spokesperson for governor arne 
Carlson says a construction crew accidentally struck a natural gas 
line, and that may have caused the explosion.
