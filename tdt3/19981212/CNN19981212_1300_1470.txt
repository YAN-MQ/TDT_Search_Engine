A former mouseketeer is facing up to 90 years in prison for buying 
thousands of dollars worth of stock with phony checks. Darlene gillespie 
was one of the original members of television's Mickey mouse club. 
She was convicted yesterday by a federal jury on a dozen counts of 
conspiracy, securities fraud, mail fraud and obstruction of justice. 
Her lawyer says gillespie was duped by unscrupulous stockbrokers and 
will appeal.
