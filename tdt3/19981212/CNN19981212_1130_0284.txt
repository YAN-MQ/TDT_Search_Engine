While the impeachment debate simmers in Washington, President Clinton 
is on his way to the mideast. He left Andrews air force base this 
morning accompanied by his wife and daughter. White House aides say 
Mr. Clinton will push for reconciliation between israeli and Arab 
leaders, but won't offer specific plans. His three-day visit will 
include stops in Jerusalem, Gaza and Bethlehem.
