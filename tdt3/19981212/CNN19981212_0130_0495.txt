With a look at your "CNN Headline News Weather," I'm Karen Maginnis. 
The start of the weekend is going to be a chilly one through the interior 
west. Temperatures mostly in the 30s across the central Rockies. Salt 
Lake City is expecting a high temperature of only about 34 degrees. 
Temperatures begin to warm up across the central plains. High pressure 
starts to push in and it looks like most of the moisture could be 
located along the gulf coast and into the southeastern United States. 
We will expect yet another pacific northwest storm. Those rivers and 
streams beginning to fill up, and snow levels down to around 3,000 
or 4,000 feet. For Alaska, Hawaii and the Caribbean, a breezy day 
as far as trade winds are concerned across Honolulu and through Hilo. 
Look for 83 in San Juan and minus 12 for Fairbanks, Alaska. The extended 
forecast shows the east and the northwest on Sunday to be rather unsettled. 
For Monday, temperatures really begin to rebound across the central 
plains. And then by Tuesday, expect snow showers through the Great 
Lakes. For more weather information, log on to CNN.com.
