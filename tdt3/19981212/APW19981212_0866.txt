Kevin Brown became the first American baseball player to get a dlrs 
100 million contract, agreeing on Saturday to a dlrs 105 million, 
seven-year deal with the Los Angeles Dodgers. The deal set a record 
both for total dollars and average annual salary (dlrs 15 million). 
The previous high for average salary in U.S. Major League Baseball, 
dlrs 13.33 million, was set less than two weeks ago, when first baseman 
Mo Vaughn agreed Nov. 25 to an dlrs 80 million, six-year contract 
with the Anaheim Angels. The previous high for dollars was set Oct. 
23, when catcher Mike Piazza agreed to a dlrs 91 million, seven-year 
deal with the New York Mets. ``We think Kevin Brown is a big part 
of our future,'' Dodgers general manager Kevin Malone said. ``We're 
comfortable with the terms. We feel like we logically evaluated the 
marketplace. We needed the player, we wanted the player and we made 
the commitment to our fans to becoming a winning team.'' Breaking 
the dlrs 100 million mark is sure to bring an outcry among some MLB 
club owners against Australian-born media mogul Rupert Murdoch, who 
took over the Dodgers in March. With Murdoch's billions, Los Angeles 
has made major upgrades in an effort to return to the World Series 
for the first time since 1988. ``I never thought we'd see the day 
of a 91-million-dollar player,'' said Dodgers senior vice president 
Tom Lasorda, who is Piazza's godfather. ``There's only one thing certain 
in baseball _ nothing is certain.'' Brown gets a dlrs 5 million signing 
bonus, dlrs 10 million next year and dlrs 15 million in each of the 
following six seasons. As part of the deal, the Dodgers will give 
him the use of a private plane 12 times per season to commute to Los 
Angeles on the United States' West Coast from Brown's home in Macon, 
Georgia, on the East Coast. He also gets a no-trade clause. Anaheim, 
Baltimore, Colorado and St. Louis also were among the finalists for 
Brown, a 33-year-old right-hander who went 18-7 with a 2.38 ERA for 
San Diego this year. He helped Florida win the World Series in 1997, 
then was traded to the Padres as part of the Marlins' payroll purge 
and helped San Diego reach for the World Series for the first time 
since 1984.
