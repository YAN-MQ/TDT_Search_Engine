The Democrats on the impeachment committee agonized in their final 
defeat Saturday night, accusing Republicans of attempting a legislative 
coup and seeing their hopes for the Scarlet C, as in censure, rebuffed 
as the alternative to removing President Clinton from office. ``I 
never thought we'd come to this,'' Thomas Barrett, D-Wis., sadly admitted 
as he offered the motion to censure ``my president'' as a man deserving 
the ``condemnation of the American people'' for his sex-and-mendacity 
scandal. The two sides clashed in a final burst of exhausting debate. 
In the day's result, the Republican majority turned back the censure 
motion as toothless and completed their crossing of the impeachment 
Rubicon: A party-line vote approved the last charges of high crimes 
and misdemeanors, triggering the full House's return next week for 
the historic decision of whether to have the Senate put the president 
on trial for removal from office. ``By golly he deserves it,'' said 
Rep. Bill McCollum, R-Fla., offering a blunt coda to the House Judiciary 
Committee majority's resolve to see Clinton banished. The matter was 
completed at 6:23 p.m., to a smattering of audience applause and a 
quiet, weary observation from the chairman, Henry Hyde of Illinois, 
that the committee ``slips into history'' to await the floor impeachment 
vote. For all the Democrats' pleas for censure as a more popular remedy, 
the Republicans insisted to the end that impeachment was the only 
way to deal with ``a president who sees truth as the mere plaything 
of his imagination.'' Clinton had indeed left ``a wound'' on the nation 
to ``fester in history,'' the Democrats conceded, as they failed in 
their pleas for some middle-ground mercy. In the final hours of a 
punishing legislative exercise, the Democrats' confidence that they 
can defeat impeachment on the House floor next week clearly was fading. 
``I hope Dr. Ruth is getting ready,'' said Robert Wexler, D-Fla., 
warning that the Senate trial would see a parade of witnesses offering 
gloss on the seamy details of the scandal. ``The body politic doesn't 
want that to happen,'' Howard Berman, D-Calif., told the committee. 
Barrett fairly prayed for a public awakening. ``They've hit the snooze 
button,'' he declared. The impeachment committee eased into its final 
day with a sense of political hangover, a somber wistfulness at having 
irrevocably done the deed. Members quietly sipped coffee in the hearing 
room doorways and munched muffins at their microphones on a gray day, 
awaiting the Republicans' approval of the final article of impeachment. 
The day ended with members looking depleted as they headed into the 
night, the Democrats talking of a last-ditch hope to see House speaker-designate 
Bob Livingston end his aloofness on the issue and let a censure debate 
be added next week. Lurking all week about the proceedings was a Democratic 
warning that the Republicans may be putting their House majority on 
the line in the next election by pressing the unpopular impeachment 
vote. ``Beware,'' the Republicans were cautioned by Zoe Lofgren, D-Calif. 
``Next election, the voters will be out to get you.'' Despite moments 
when the ghost of Richard Nixon was summoned forth, the bluntest distinction 
between Watergate and the move to impeach President Clinton was stated 
by Howard Coble, R-N.C., who noted that the Republicans are in the 
congressional majority this time, while the Democrats were in 1974. 
``It's a lot easier to throw grenades than to catch them,'' Coble 
said with some satisfaction. With the president's fate on the table, 
ceremonial gavels moved with the fleetness of tap dancers through 
the impeachment proceeding: A brief rap or two for a new gavel, then 
on to the next one, and the next, for fresh history needs fresh souvenirs. 
In the eyes of Democrats, these symbolic hammers of law and order, 
however, had a macabre aspect in being brandished at a far grimmer 
event, the committee's presidential impeachment, so an explanation 
was in order. ``They are to be given to people for what purpose I 
don't know,'' Hyde lightly announced. Privately, Democrats grimly 
joked they might serve as prizes at Republican fund-raising dinners. 
The avuncular chairman remained unflappable through the legislative 
ordeal and was widely praised at the end. ``We're nearing the end, 
folks, let's take a deep breath,'' he announced, as if he were driving 
a school bus through a maelstrom with a partisan spitball fight being 
waged about him. The final vote rejecting censure seemed to restoke 
passions for the looming floor debate. Jerrold Nadler, D-N.Y., complained 
that the House would face ``moral blackmail'' if the floor choice 
presented members with ``impeachment or nothing.'' But Bob Barr, R-Ga., 
who first proposed Clinton's impeachment, said the censure motion, 
with its oblique language that the president ``wrongly took steps 
to delay the discovery of the truth,'' read like the product of group 
therapy, not Congress. ``This isn't a feel-good session,'' Barr snapped, 
urging Congress to reject censure and rely on impeachment. ``Let's 
do it.''
