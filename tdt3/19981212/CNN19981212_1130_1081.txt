Who'll get the heisman? We'll look at the college football trophy 
candidates, next in "Headline Sports." Hi, I'm expecting a fax. Room 
212 wants the ammunition to deal with her toughest clients. Nothing? 
Davies, 212. I called earlier. Right, fax. It hasn't come yet. I need 
it for a meeting. Excuse me, miss Davies? It just came in. Thank you, 
so much. Good morning, everyone. Business services by Marriott. Ah, 
the good old days of supermarket shopping. Where nothing stood between 
you and your next meal. Nothing. But today, there are materials that 
help lock out harmful contaminants and reduce spoilage. Keeping us 
safe and the food we eat fresh. Plastics make it possible. So now, 
the rest is history. Rob Ticktin, "CNN Headline Sports."
