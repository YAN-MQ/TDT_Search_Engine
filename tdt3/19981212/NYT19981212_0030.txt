Rep. Lindsey Graham has always had a renegade streak in him, which 
he displayed Friday when he became the lone Republican to vote against 
the second article of impeachment. Last summer, the South Carolina 
conservative stepped up as the ringleader in a plot to oust Rep. Newt 
Gingrich, the House speaker, before it became fashionable. And earlier 
this year, when members were scrambling for bits of ``pork'' to haul 
to their districts from the highway spending bill, Graham courted 
the wrath of Rep. Bud Shuster, the near monolithic Transportation 
Committee chairman, by criticizing his own party for engineering the 
largest public works bill in history. On Friday, Graham followed up 
on his public reservations about the second article, which accused 
President Clinton of committing perjury in his civil deposition in 
the Paula Jones case. He had discussed his reticence frequently in 
closed-door meetings and on television. ``Is this the second article?'' 
Graham asked, as he rushed into the committee room during the roll 
call vote after ending remarks to reporters outside. When someone 
answered yes, he voted no and took his seat. Graham, who has long 
said he would not support impeachment for a lie in a civil case, said 
he based his no vote on a legal technicality, not on his belief that 
Clinton had been telling the truth. A federal judge had found Clinton's 
statements to be inadmissible, and that was enough to persuade Graham 
that the whole thing was immaterial and did not deserve impeachment. 
``I chose to give him the benefit of the doubt,'' Graham said after 
the vote. ``I know he lied, but that's what the law is for.'' Despite 
his one no vote, Graham, the conservative firebrand with a penchant 
for moderation on the impeachment issue, approved two other articles, 
one that accused Clinton of lying to a grand jury, the other that 
he obstructed justice. He said he would vote yes on the fourth article, 
abuse of power. To hear him tell it, he just plain ran out of patience 
with Clinton. This week, he went on the attack. ``I can only believe 
your defense if I check my common sense at the door, and I forget 
the way the world really works,'' he told the president's lawyer, 
Charles F.C. Ruff, during a caustic exchange in front of the committee 
on Wednesday. ``If people in America follow Bill Clintonspeak, we're 
going to ruin the rule of law, and he's not worth that,'' Graham added. 
``No one person in America is worth trashing out the rule of law and 
creating a situation where you can't rely on your common sense.'' 
The turning point for him came when, he said, Ruff failed to offer 
a credible defense of Clinton's actions, the worst of which was not 
simple perjury, but using the power of the presidency to try to smear 
a witness, Monica Lewinsky, by painting her as a ``sexual predator.'' 
``The way he treated Monica Lewinsky,'' he said, in exasperation, 
``his political interests were more important than the truth or welfare 
of the person he was involved in a sexual relationship with. He was 
using the office in a most sinister way.'' ``The country is in trouble 
when you let politicians use the resources of their office to crush 
a citizen that may get in their way,'' Graham added. On the Judiciary 
Committee, where he is a junior member, Graham has stood apart with 
his vivid, concise remarks, the kind that would make sense to his 
grandmother at the kitchen table, not just to a roomful of lawyers 
skilled in legalisms. He speaks right off the cuff, without text, 
something his colleagues seldom do. ``I always asked whether this 
would be more like Peyton Place than Watergate,'' Graham said. Friday, 
he answered his own question. ``Watergate,'' he said.
