For the sixth straight day, a Chinese woman weightlifter broke a world 
record and won gold at the Asian Games Saturday. With one day left 
in women's weightlifting competition, Wei Xiangying became the latest 
record-breaker, winning the 75-kilogram division with an Asian record 
total of 242.5 kilograms and a world record snatch of 115. China's 
Zhao La had held both the old records _ 111.5 in the snatch and 240 
in total. South Korea's Kim Soon-hee and Myanmar's Aye Mon Khin both 
lifted a total of 230, but Kim won the bronze because of her lighter 
body weight. Wei's winning margin came from the snatch, well ahead 
of Kim's 102.5 and Aye Mon Khin's 100. In the jerk, Kim matched Wei's 
127.5, and Aye Mon Kim beat it with a 130 lift. Kim unsuccessfully 
tried for a world record 145 jerk on her final attempt for gold. Wei, 
a 19-year-old from Liaoning province, progressed from 107.5 to 112.5 
and 115 in her three attempts in the snatch. While all of China's 
women gold medalists here have broken world records, Sun Tianni did 
the most thorough job Friday, setting marks in snatch, jerk and total. 
Her 245 total in the 69-kilogram division beat the winning total of 
242.5 in Saturday's 75-kilogram competition. In the men's 94-kilogram 
division, China failed to win, place or show, with their best performance 
coming from 23-year-old Qin Guang, who came in second to South Korea's 
Chun Yong-sung in the jerk. The men's gold medalist was Kazakstan's 
Andrey Makarov with a 385 total, which came from a 180 first place 
in the snatch, and a third-ranking 205 in the jerk. Makarov's snatch 
and total marks bested previous records held by China's Ma Yanfei. 
The silver went to Iran's Kourosh Bagheri-Kolah, whose second-place 
175 in the snatch combined with a fifth-place 202.5 in the jerk to 
give him a 377.5 total. Chun made up for a fifth place 162.5 in the 
snatch with a confident-looking 210 in the jerk, giving him a 372.5 
total. He failed on his final attempt at 217.5. Chun's Asian record 
jerk attempt surpassed the previous mark held by China's Qin Guang. 
One of the few moments of drama in the competition came when Slavik 
Nyu _ Makarov's teammate from Kazakhstan _ failed to beat the clock 
on his final attempt, losing a chance at 210 which could have given 
him the silver if successful. (gp-tjh)
