Finally from Washington, it can be said that the future of the Clinton 
presidency is in doubt tonight. Few presidents have risen as high 
only to have been brought so low. Our report tonight from NBC's John 
Palmer. Just two years ago, President Clinton easily won reelection, 
the first democratic president since Franklin D. Roosevelt to be elected 
to a Second term. Yet, Bill Clinton, who took office promising the 
most ethical administration in history, was already one of history's 
most investigated presidents. He generated those problems, but obviously 
they have been magnified by the very partisan ideological politics 
that we've seen in Washington during -- beginning, really, in the 
1980s. First there was the Paula Jones case, then Kenneth Starr's 
investigation into the Whitewater land development later expanded 
to include the death of Clinton aide Vince Foster, travelgate, filegate, 
and finally in January, the Lewinsky scandal combined to take a major 
toll on the Clinton presidency. This year actually started out with 
a lot of promise. The president had an agenda that had some popular 
appeal, you could see opportunities for compromise in tobacco, on 
health care, on education, and to begin the process of dealing with 
social security. I think the scandal poisoned the atmosphere. But 
agreement on the first balanced budget in 29 years, coupled with low 
unemployment and rising wages and the highest home ownership in history, 
have helped President Clinton maintain a high level of popularity 
with the public. His role in bringing peace to northern Ireland and 
his historic trip to africa are part of his legacy. But history will 
now record that he has become the third president to confront impeachment, 
joining Andrew Johnson, who escaped by just one vote in the Senate, 
and Richard Nixon, who resigned. Friends say Clinton has given no 
thought of following Nixon's lead. That's not Bill Clinton. Bill Clinton's 
not gonna give up. Planning continues in Little Rock for a Clinton 
presidential library. At the Nixon library, a small @ section addresses 
the Watergate scandal which drove the 37th president of the United 
States from office. Supporters in Little Rock hope this presidential 
scandal doesn't cast as long a shadow over Bill Clinton. John Palmer, 
NBC news, at the White House.
