Thai protest leaders said thousands of anti-pollution demonstrators 
will block roads again this week if the government breaks its promise 
to scrap three planned power plants, local papers reported on Saturday. 
``We will see how well he keeps his word,'' protest leader Theerawut 
Jaewsakul was quoted by The Nation as saying about a government official 
who made the pledge. At least 65 people were injured during two days 
of violent clashes between 3,000 policemen and 5,000 villagers opposed 
to the building of three coal-fired power plants in Prachuab Khiri 
Khan, 230 kilometers (145 miles) southwest of Bangkok. The villagers 
say the plants, one of which will use lignite, or brown coal, will 
pollute their environment and damage their health. The protesters 
dispersed Thursday evening after Deputy Interior Minister Pinij Charusombat 
signed an agreement promising the government would stop the projects. 
Prime Minister's Office Minister Savit Bhotiwihok told The Nation, 
however, that Pinij had no right to make such a promise and should 
not have let the mob pressure him into doing so. Interior Minister 
Sanan Kachornprasart said because previous governments had signed 
legally binding contracts with foreign investors to build the plants, 
the government's only choice to was to have the protesters accept 
the plants through better public relations, according to the paper. 
Japanese, Finnish and American companies are part of consortia building 
the plants, and they have said they expect the government to honor 
its commitments. Prime Minister Chuan Leekpai has pleaded with the 
villagers to refrain from blocking roads or demonstrating until after 
his Cabinet takes up the matter on Tuesday.
