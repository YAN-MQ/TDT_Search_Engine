Two years ago, two men approached a sports car in the wealthy Mansour 
district of Baghdad and raked it with machine gun fire. Amid the panic 
and confusion in the streets the assailants escaped, unaware that 
their victim, Odai Hussein, had survived, although with grievous injuries. 
Odai, President Saddam Hussein's eldest son and then his heir apparent, 
was shot about 10 times and remained in hospital for six months before 
appearing in public. To mark the second anniversary of his narrow 
escape, Iraq is holding day-long, nationwide celebrations Saturday. 
The biggest festivities will be held in Baghdad, especially on the 
street intersection where on Dec. 12, 1996 a bloodied Odai had lain 
slumped in his car, only 500 meters (yards) from an intelligence headquarters. 
Odai, 34, has regained his health but still walks with the help of 
a cane, a reminder of the bullets that had shattered his leg. Prior 
to the assassination attempt, Odai held considerable power in Iraq. 
He is known to be a close confidant of his father and had previously 
run the trade and information ministries.
