No one's calling for affirmative action for boys just yet. But given 
the fact that girls are becoming an ever larger majority at most American 
colleges, many educators are beginning to think boys should get more 
attention. For several years, the conventional wisdom _ reinforced 
by a steady drumbeat of stories stressing female victimhood _ has 
been that girls are shortchanged in school, getting less attention 
from their teachers than boys and gradually losing their self-esteem 
as they enter adolescence. By all kinds of measures, though, girls 
rule in school. They have better grades, higher reading and writing 
scores, higher class ranks and more school honors, and they are more 
likely than boys to take Advanced Placement exams in English, social 
studies and foreign languages. Boys are more likely to repeat a grade, 
drop out, be put in special education, be diagnosed with learning 
disabilities and be put on behavior-modifying medication like Ritalin. 
As teen-agers, they are also far more likely than girls to commit 
suicide. ``The myth that the schools shortchange girls is dangerously 
wrong because it has diverted policy attention from the group at genuine 
education risk _ African-American boys,'' said Judith Kleinfeld, a 
University of Alaska professor, in a paper earlier this year that 
found that schools put boys at more of a disadvantage than girls. 
``This is the group that scores lowest on virtually every educational 
measure. This is the group where an enormous gap does exist between 
males and females. But the African-American gender gap favors females.'' 
The idea that boys need more help than girls do is slowly gaining 
currency nationally. ``Something is changing,'' Ms. Kleinfeld said. 
``Just recently, people are beginning to be willing to think about 
boys' problems.'' No one denies that the status of women remains a 
real issue in society. Despite the flood of women into business and 
the professions over the last two decades, women are underrepresented 
in corporate boardrooms, science labs and partnerships at law firms. 
And even in school, sexual harassment remains a problem. Boys still 
dominate the nation's technical and engineering schools, and obtain 
higher scores on many standardized tests _ although those gaps are 
narrowing. But some educators say the boys-versus-girls bean-counting 
has gone too far, that those gaps have become small enough that they 
are unimportant, especially when measured against the very large racial 
differences in educational achievement. ``They're saying that more 
girls take biology and chemistry, but uh-oh, there's more boys in 
physics,'' said Diane Ravitch, a senior fellow at the Brookings Institution. 
``This is not an alarm bell ringing in the night,'' she said. ``What 
we should be concerned about is the racial disparities. There's a 
four-year gap between blacks and whites on the national tests. The 
average black 17-year-old scores the same as the average white 13-year-old. 
That's a crisis, not gender.'' Arthur Levine, president of Columbia 
University's Teachers College, takes a middle road, stressing that 
both sexes have unique problems that schools should address. ``It's 
not either-or, and we shouldn't always see things as the crisis du 
jour,'' he said. ``We can do better by boys. We need to do a lot better 
with regard to racial and socioeconomic differences, and that doesn't 
mean we shouldn't pay attention to the special needs of girls.'' The 
furor over gender equity was kindled in 1992 by the release of a study 
by the American Association of University Women, ``How Schools Shortchange 
Girls,'' which declared that girls face bias from preschool through 
high school in textbooks, tests and teachers. The association presented 
the situation as dire. ``This report brings to light the pervasive 
inequalities that have made girls second-class students in America's 
schools,'' said Alice McKee, the AAUW Educational Foundation president 
at the time. ``Girls and boys enter school roughly equal in ability. 
Twelve years later, girls have fallen behind in key areas. Whether 
one looks at achievement scores, curriculum design or teacher-student 
interaction, it's clear that our schools are shortchanging America's 
girls.'' The report stimulated debate on teacher training and gender 
equity, experiments with single-sex math and science classes and new 
interest in girls' schools, including new efforts like the Young Women's 
Leadership Academy in New York's Harlem. But based on extensive re-examination 
of the AAUW data and findings, Ms. Kleinfeld's paper found the report 
shoddy, biased and simply incorrect. She wrote: ``In the view of elementary 
and high school students, the young people who sit in the classroom 
year after year and observe what is going on, both boys and girls 
agree: Schools favor girls. Teachers think girls are smarter, like 
being around them more and hold higher expectations for them.'' ``That 
first AAUW report was just completely wrong,'' she said. ``What was 
so bizarre is that it came out right at the time that girls had just 
overtaken boys in almost every area. It might have been the right 
story 20 years earlier, but coming out when it did, it was like calling 
a wedding a funeral. It was phony, it dominated the news for years 
and it was harmful. There were all these special programs put in place 
for girls, and no one paid any attention to boys.'' Janice Weinman, 
executive director of the AAUW, defends the report. `` `How Schools 
Shortchange Girls' was a wake-up call,'' she said. ``I think it's 
because of that report that girls made progress in math and science.'' 
Others have also found it valuable. ``To my mind, it was a good thing 
that the AAUW got us to worry about girls, because there is no question 
in my mind that women in classrooms were treated with less respect 
and interest than boys,'' said Frank Newman, president of the Education 
Commission of the States, a policy group in Colorado. ``The boy-girl 
problem is much deeper than education, it's a civic responsibility 
problem. When I was a university president, dealing with discipline 
cases where someone was being expelled or suspended, it was always 
boys. I don't remember a single girl. We need to teach boys responsibility. 
That's why sexual harassment is still a problem. Boy-girl differences 
are still important, but they pale in comparison to the big differences 
in education, which are due to race and class.'' This fall, the AAUW 
issued a follow-up report, talking about girls' gains, as well as 
the areas where boys lag. ``I agree, the issue shouldn't be boys versus 
girls,'' Ms. Weinman said. ``It should be equity and excellence for 
everyone. And we're not stuck in the same groove, singing the same 
song. Our follow-up report said number one, that girls had made real 
progress; number two, that boys had not made that kind of progress 
in the fields where they lag, and number three, that we should look 
at subgroups, like Hispanic girls or African-American boys, to determine 
where there are particular needs.'' But even the new report emphasized 
a growing technology gap that leaves girls less equipped for skilled 
computer jobs, calling technology the new boy's club. ``It's a significant 
problem, and we're very concerned about it,'' Ms. Weinman said. ``And 
it's true, we're the American Association of University Women, and 
our mission is to look at education for girls and women.''
