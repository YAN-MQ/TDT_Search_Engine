Giants Coach Jim Fassel got a lot of advice this past week when it 
came to devising his game plan for defeating the Denver Broncos. Play 
a conservative, ball-control style and shorten the game, he was told. 
No, others suggested, you must accept that the Broncos will score 
_ and then outscore them. Stop Terrell Davis, some said, and make 
John Elway beat you. No, stop Elway, still others suggested, and reduce 
the game to its basics _ a good defense against a good running back. 
Stop Shannon Sharpe. Stop Ed McCaffrey. Stop Rod Smith. Stop Darrien 
Gordon, the punt returner. Finally, Fassel said: Stop. ``People want 
you to choose your poison,'' Fassel said early in the week. ``But 
you die anyway. Take the idea that you should shorten the game and 
try to hang in there until the fourth quarter. You can't do that with 
these guys, you'll just die a slow death instead. ``We've got some 
things we want to do defensively, but they won't be gimmicks. The 
Broncos are too good for gimmicks.'' Still, Fassel and his defensive 
coordinator, John Fox, have faced a quandary: Because the Broncos 
are the National Football League's most offensively versatile team, 
do you adjust your basic defensive philosophy? Do you try to steer 
their offense toward the run or the pass with your choice of defensive 
formations, or even try to outsmart the Broncos with contradictory 
personnel groupings _ run defenders in passing situations and pass 
defenders in running situations? It would appear the Giants are not 
interested in gambling too often today. It could be a poison that 
brings the quickest death. ``You can't dictate the game to them,'' 
Fox said of the 13-0 Broncos, winners of 18 straight games. ``They 
have the flexibility to do what they want to do. They have a tight 
end in Shannon Sharpe who can play like a wide receiver and a wide 
receiver in Ed McCaffrey who can play like a tight end. ``They have 
a quarterback who's a great thrower and runner and a runner who is 
a great all-around player.'' The Giants are likely to make adjustments 
in their defensive packages. The rookie safety Shaun Williams might 
fill the role normally taken by the nickel linebacker, since the Giants' 
usual nickel linebacker, Scott Galyon, is out with a broken leg. This 
would give the Giants some flexibility in trying to cover Sharpe. 
As Fassel said Friday at Giants Stadium: ``Sharpe is too strong for 
the defensive backs and too quick for the linebackers. How do you 
defend a special guy like that? ``Plus, Shannon is one of the smartest, 
most instinctive football players I've ever been around.'' The thinking 
may be that Williams, who is considered a physical safety, might offer 
a good matchup. He is also inexperienced, while Sharpe is in his ninth 
season. The load may fall to linebacker Marcus Buckley and safeties 
Sam Garnes and Percy Ellsworth. But as much of a problem as Sharpe 
will be, there is also McCaffrey, a 6-foot-5-inch receiver who could 
be trouble for the Giants' smaller cornerbacks. Four months after 
cornerback Jason Sehorn's injury, this may be the week that the Giants 
miss the 6-2, 210-pound Sehorn the most. Sehorn in man-to-man coverage 
on McCaffrey might have given the Giants the flexibility to put eight 
men near the line of scrimmage in an attempt to control Davis. And 
through all the analysis of what the Giants will need to do this week 
defensively, ultimately it seems to come down to stopping Davis first. 
As Fassel said: ``The mentality of most football coaches is that if 
you can run the football on somebody, then run it. So whether you 
have to put seven guys on the line to stop the run, or eight or nine 
guys up there, eventually, you've got to stop it. ``That's just the 
way it is.'' Somewhat ruefully, Fox added: ``The problem is that I've 
seen them face an eight-man front and Davis just runs over the eighth 
man.'' Fox said he believes his defense matches up well with the Broncos, 
so he is not over-thinking this week's assignment. ``You can't trick 
a team that hasn't scored less than 21 points in any game and is averaging 
33 and a half points a game,'' Fox said. ``You're not going to stop 
them. There have been teams who run real well or pass real well, but 
I'm not sure in recent years that there's been a team in the league 
who does both as well as the Broncos. ``So you've got to match up 
and try to beat them. Get up there, get on them, our guys against 
their guys.'' As Fassel said: ``They're undefeated, playing for history 
and the whole nation is watching. We're not exactly going to sneak 
up on them.'' There is one last variable to the Giants' challenge, 
one that might be to their advantage: a cold and blustery Giants Stadium 
kind of day. ``I want a typical Meadowlands December day _ cold and 
windy,'' Fassel said Friday. The Broncos and Elway are used to inclement 
conditions in Denver, but the swirling winds at Giants Stadium are 
unique, and perhaps might prove disconcerting to Elway. Which brings 
about what may be the only statistics that can be cited to counteract 
the Broncos' huge practical advantage against the Giants. In four 
career games at Giants Stadium from 1986 to 1994, Elway threw three 
touchdown passes and four interceptions. He lost once to the Giants 
and lost two of three games to the Jets. That said, the Giants are 
still decided underdogs.
