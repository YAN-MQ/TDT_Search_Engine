Doctors say baseball legend Joe DiMaggio has been able to sit up in 
bed and speak today. The Yankee clipper came out of a coma yesterday. 
He is in a Hollywood, Florida, hospital recovering from lung cancer 
surgery and pneumonia. His doctor says DiMaggio was switched from 
oral to intravenous antibiotics and his improvement has been unbelievable. 
How is he on a scale from 1 to 10? Yesterday, he was 0.5, I mean, 
that's how low it was. When I saw him at noon, he was awake a little 
bit and his temperature was down -- well, we'll move him up to 1, 
1 1/2. Today, he is about a 4 or a 5. Doctors are now considering 
upgrading the 84-year-old's condition from critical to serious.
