The Philadelphia Flyers reunited their ``Legion of Doom'' line on 
Saturday, acquiring Swedish right wing Mikael Renberg from the Tampa 
Bay Lightning in a four-player trade. Renberg, traded to the Lightning 
in 1997, rejoins Eric Lindros and John LeClair in Philadelphia. The 
Flyers also get center Daymond Langkow and sent forwards Chris Gratton 
and Mike Sillinger to the Lightning. The Flyers, scheduled to play 
at Toronto on Saturday night, have been searching for a right wing 
to replace Renberg on the Lindros-LeClair line since trading him to 
Tampa Bay with Karl Dykhuis for draft picks. Flyers general manager 
Bob Clarke said coach Roger Neilson would decide whether Renberg would 
return to the ``Legion of Doom.'' ``He'll certainly play some with 
Lindros,'' Clarke said. ``Keith Jones has been awfully good there. 
Either one of them could play with (Rod) Brind'Amour. Offensively, 
we've helped ourselves.'' Keith Jones gave the Flyers' first line 
a boost when he was acquired from Colorado for Shjon Podein on Nov. 
12, but Philadelphia was still lagging six points behind first-place 
New Jersey in the Atlantic. The Flyers said Renberg was headed to 
Philadelphia and would miss the Flyers' game in Toronto. His second 
tour of duty could begin Sunday night at home against Edmonton. Langkow, 
who had four goals and six assists in 22 games, was making the trip 
to Toronto but wasn't certain to play. Renberg played for the Flyers 
from 1993-97, joining Lindros and LeClair on a potent line that led 
Philadelphia to the Stanley Cup finals in his final season. He has 
only four goals and eight assists in 20 games for the Lighting, who 
lost for the 12th time in 13 games Friday night. The deal continued 
an odd association between Renberg and Gratton. The Lightning got 
the right to four first-round draft choices when they declined to 
match the Flyers' offer sheet for Gratton in 1997, then traded the 
draft picks to the Flyers in the Renberg deal.
