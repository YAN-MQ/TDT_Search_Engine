On Dec. 2, a US Airways passenger jet landing at La Guardia Airport 
came within 50 feet of a corporate plane preparing to take off. It 
was one of three times in the Northeast this month in which planes 
came too close together, which might lead peak-season passengers to 
wonder what's going on up there. A lot: air traffic nationally and 
in the Northeast has never been more congested. In 1987, the National 
Geographic Society mapped the skies above New York on a typical afternoon 
for its ``Historical Atlas of the United States'' and identified about 
45 aircraft flying below 14,000 feet, which included most planes headed 
to or from the three major airports. Now, The New York Times has taken 
a more panoramic snapshot that shows far more traffic overall. The 
accompanying map shows the New York region's traffic at 6 p.m. on 
Oct. 8. The planes at lower altitudes were under the control of the 
New York Terminal Radar Approach Control, in Westbury, N.Y.; the ones 
at higher altitudes were directed by the New York Air Route Traffic 
Control Center, in Ronkonkoma, N.Y. Technology has helped air traffic 
controllers keep pace with greater congestion, but a controller's 
job remains highly stressful. Controllers complain about unreliable 
and aging equipment; experts say the Federal Aviation Administration 
must find new technology or face gridlock. If the controllers make 
a mistake or their computers break down, an onboard system can warn 
passenger plane pilots of impending collisions. Last week, a British 
Caledonian Boeing 767 and a Delta L-1011, both bound for Europe, came 
within a mile of each other over Long Island, apparently because of 
computer error, but their pilots were warned by the on-board anti-collision 
systems.
