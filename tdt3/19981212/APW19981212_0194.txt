European Union nations remained at an impasse Saturday over the EU's 
future financing, but insisted that it won't slow plans to add a dozen 
new members in the years ahead. Wrapping up a two-day summit, the 
15 EU leaders were to issue a statement declaring ``the overall enlargement 
process ... well underway.'' In the draft text, they promised to resolve 
the money dispute by next March and urged one another to impose as 
much budget austerity at the EU level as they do at home. The EU's 
biggest ever expansion involves letting Cyprus, 10 Eastern European 
nations and Malta into the club in the next decade. Negotiations began 
this fall, but the EU governments have gotten stuck in a dispute over 
money. Germany, France, the Netherlands, Austria, Sweden and Denmark 
insist on a spending freeze, keeping outlays at 85 billion European 
currency units (about dlrs 100 billion) in the 2000-2006 period. But 
Spain and other southerners fear they will lose EU funds to poorer 
newcomers and argue outlays must at least rise in line with economic 
growth, adding some dlrs 24 billion to the EU budget by 2006. In their 
draft text, the leaders pledged to craft ``an appropriate financial 
framework'' to make enlargement possible. ``This must be done in a 
spirit of solidarity while ensuring similar budgetary rigor at the 
level of the union as applied at the national level.'' The draft text 
stressed the money fight must not be seen as backtracking on enlargement 
itself. On the contrary, the leaders urged the EU executive Commission 
and their foreign ministers ``to maintain the momentum'' of intensive 
enlargement talks. The leaders carefully avoided giving any entry 
dates so as to keep candidates working apace on their economic and 
political reforms to meet EU membership requirements. On another issue, 
the leaders did better by agreeing to pursue ways of how Europe can 
craft a credible defense arm without always relying on the United 
States. France and Britain _ Western Europe's only nuclear powers 
_ issued a joint statement this month saying the EU must be able to 
act on its own with a ``credible military force'' within the framework 
of NATO. Complicating the money dispute is that Germany and other 
northerners complain they already pay too much. German Chancellor 
Gerhard Schroeder, whose country still pays for absorbing East Germany, 
made it clear Europe's enlargement problems are not going to be solved 
with a German checkbook. In a related issue, Prime Minister Tony Blair 
said he will not give up an annual rebate Britain has been getting 
since 1984 for its net payments. ``It shouldn't be negotiated away 
because it is justified. Otherwise, Britain would be paying a quite 
disproportionate and unfair amount into the European Union,'' he said 
Britain's net payment to the EU is some dlrs 8 billion, half of which 
is refunded. Eighty percent of the EU's budget goes to farm subsidies 
and aid for poor regions. Taking on half a dozen poor East European 
countries and millions of uneconomical farmers would break the budget 
unless serious reforms are undertaken. The leaders set a March deadline 
to sort out budget reform. ``All around the table realized the historic 
need to come to a deal,'' said Dutch Prime Minister Wim Kok. ``If 
this bogs down you'll see a serious crisis situation, and that you 
cannot do to people whose expectations of Europe we have raised.''
