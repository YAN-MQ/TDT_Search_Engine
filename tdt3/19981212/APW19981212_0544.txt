Taiwan captured three of the four bowling gold medals at stake Saturday 
in the Asian Games, winning in men's and women's five-strong teams 
and the women's trio events. The men's trio went to host nation Thailand. 
``I'm very excited to win,'' said Taiwan's Wang Yujen, who scored 
1,194 in Taiwan's winning tally of 6,073. South Korea had 6,045 and 
Japan 5,972. ``There's a lot of pressure because there are many good 
bowlers in Taiwan.'' Wang's teammates on the top podium included Wu 
Fu-lung, Cheng Chao-yu, Lin Han-chen and Chen Chun-fu. The Taiwainese 
women _ Tseng Su-fen, Chou Miao-lin, Kuo Shu-chen, Huang Chiung-yao 
and Ku Hui-chin _ racked up 6,098 points to South Korea's 6,045 and 
Japan's 5,613. Tseng, Chou and Kuo also combined to take the women's 
trios. Thailand took silver and Singapore bronze. Thailand's Seri 
Krausing, Praset Panturat and J. Kritchawat triumphed in the men's 
trios with 3,760 points. But Taiwan again showed its dominance in 
bowling by taking the silver with 3,696. The United Arab Emirates 
was the only non-East Asian country to figure in the medals, coming 
up with the men's trios bronze with 3,690 points.
