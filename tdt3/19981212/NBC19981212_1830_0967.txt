Martin Fletcher tonight reports the stakes are very high. Bethlehem 
welcomes President Clinton Tuesday. It may be different than expected, 
though. Palestinians today again challenges Israeli soldiers. A comment 
on the peace process, that Palestinian police rated 45 minutes before 
stopping the riots. Elsewhere, Palestinians buried their dead from 
yesterday's fighting. The chaos in the streets is matched by the chaos 
in the Israeli government. President Clinton is not the only leader 
who could be thrown out of office. His host, prime minister Benjamin 
Netanyahu could be out in weeks. His political health is tied to the 
peace process. It's a deadlock. This government cannot continue to 
survive. They have called for early elections to topple Netanyahu. 
He must change the government or go to early election. For two years, 
that's been the question. Does Netanyahu want the process to work 
or kill it slowly? He tells the left he supports the process, and 
tells the right the process will soon fall apart. The result, deadlock. 
The left and the right have the same complaint -- they can't trust 
him. He is borrowing Peter to pay paum, or lying his head off. why? 
He wants to keep on going. There's a growing feeling that Netanyahu 
has run out of options and his support will continue to erode. If 
so, his days in power are numbered.
