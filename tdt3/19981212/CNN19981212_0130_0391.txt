Officials say the death toll has climbed to at least 80 people after 
the crash of a Thai airways jet in southern Thailand Friday. At least 
50 of the 146 people aboard survived. Police say the Airbus went down 
as it tried to make an emergency landing in a heavy rainstorm. The 
weather and swampy conditions have made it difficult for ambulances 
to reach the crash site.
