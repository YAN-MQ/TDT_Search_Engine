Enrique Martinez, a ballet dancer and rehearsal director at American 
Ballet Theater who staged the classics for ballet troupes in North 
and South America and in Europe, died on Nov. 17 at St. Luke's-Roosevelt 
Hospital Center in Manhattan. He was 72 and had lived in Manhattan. 
The cause was hepatitis, his family said. Martinez was born in Havana, 
where he received his ballet training; his teachers included Alicia 
Alonso and Igor Schwezoff. He was offered a contract with American 
Ballet Theater after Lucia Chase, director of the troupe, saw him 
performing with a Cuban company. He joined the New York troupe in 
1947 and remained with it until 1980. Martinez started in the corps 
de ballet and moved up to soloist before becoming a ballet master, 
ballet director and assistant director of American Ballet Theater. 
He was known for a serenity that did not fail him even when tested 
by the most volatile of ballet stars. In 1968, Martinez created a 
sunny, good-natured production of ``Coppelia'' and became associated 
with that ballet. Martinez choreographed and staged the classics for 
companies including the National Ballet of Cuba; the Duesseldorf Ballet; 
troupes associated with La Scala in Milan, Italy, and the opera houses 
of Rome and Helsinki, Finland; the Milwaukee Ballet, and companies 
in Atlanta, Denver, Detroit and Norfolk, Va. During the 1980s and 
early '90s he directed and helped organize ballet companies in Mexico; 
Rio de Janeiro, Brazil; and Caracas, Venezuela. His most recent productions, 
created in the late 1990s, were stagings of ``Coppelia'' for the Atlanta 
Ballet and companies in Canada and France. He is survived by two brothers, 
Jose and Rodolfo, and a sister, Teresa, all of Virginia Beach, Va.
