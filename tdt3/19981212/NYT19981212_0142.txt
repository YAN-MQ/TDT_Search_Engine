Dr. Theodora Mead Abel, a psychologist who brought an anthropologist's 
view to her study of the Indians of New Mexico, died Dec. 2 at her 
home in Forestburgh. She was 99. Dr. Abel was a leader in cross-cultural 
psychological research, which became her main focus after she retired 
from a career largely in family therapy in New York, said Dr. Samuel 
Roll, a professor of psychology at the University of New Mexico. Roll 
collaborated with Dr. Abel in studies of Mexicans and Indians, including 
the Mescalero and Jicarilla Apaches, the Navajo, and the people of 
the Laguna, Taos, Santo Domingo and other pueblos in northern New 
Mexico. In Albuquerque, N.M., Indians of several tribes gave her the 
title ``grandmother'' as an indication of the respect they held for 
her. The key to her success in therapy with Indian patients was her 
understanding of the importance placed on a balance of life's forces, 
and she often asked family members to join in the therapy, Roll said. 
At age 98, Dr. Abel received the American Psychological Foundation's 
1997 Gold Medal Award for life achievement. Theodora Abel was born 
in Newport, R.I., and received her B.A. from Vassar College in 1921, 
her M.A. from Columbia University in 1924 and her Ph.D. from Columbia 
in 1925. While a graduate student, she met and became friends with 
Margaret Mead while they were lined up alphabetically to take care 
of paperwork. Though they shared the same last name at the time, they 
were not related. Decades later, Dr. Mead, by then known worldwide 
for her work in anthropology, wrote the introduction for Dr. Abel's 
book ``Culture and Psychotherapy'' (College and University Press, 
1975), written with Rhoda Metraux. Dr. Abel taught at the University 
of Illinois and at Sarah Lawrence College and later became the director 
of research at the Manhattan Trade School for Girls. In 1940, she 
joined Letchworth Village psychiatric center in Rockland County as 
a research psychologist. In 1947, she joined the Postgraduate Center 
for Mental Health in Manhattan, where she was director of psychoanalysis. 
In 1971, she moved to New Mexico and began her work there. When she 
was 88, she collaborated on a new version of her 1975 book, this time 
called ``Psychotherapy and Culture'' (University of New Mexico Press, 
1987), with Roll and Ms. Metraux. Also in 1971, she became a clinical 
professor of psychiatry at the University of New Mexico, and at the 
university's Child Guidance Center she became chief of family therapy 
service. She saw patients into her 90s. Her husband, Theodore Abel, 
died in 1988. Dr. Abel returned to New York this year. Survivors include 
two daughters, Caroline Lalire of Hamilton, Va., and Zita Emerson 
of Albuquerque; a son, Peter Abel of St. Davids, Pa., 10 grandchildren 
and seven great-grandchildren.
