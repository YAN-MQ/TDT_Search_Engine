Former British Olympian Sharron Davies isn't going to get her gold 
medal. But at least she and others may get official recognition that 
they were robbed of gold. The International Olympic Committee Saturday 
rejected a proposal to give U.S. and British swimmers the medals won 
by drug-enhanced East Germans. But Director-General Francois Carrard 
said the IOC would find another way to compensate the female swimmers 
who lost out to the East Germans. Davies, the 1980 Olympics silver 
medalist in the 400 individual medley behind East Germany's Petra 
Schneider, said Saturday she didn't expect the gold. ``I am not surprised 
at the decision, it was what I expected from speaking with British 
Olympic officials,'' said Davies, working Saturday as a television 
commentator at the European short-course championships in Sheffield. 
``My aim was not to get the gold medal, that's not what I wanted _ 
but official recognition in some way of what happened then,'' she 
said. ``In that I'm pleased because it looks as though the IOC are 
going to do something, perhaps at their big drugs conference next 
February. ``I think they might asterisk in the record books all those 
performances from 1976 and 1980 which have later been shown to have 
been down to drugs. ``That would give me great satisfaction because 
for future years it would be official recognition that what went on 
was cheating. ``I certainly don't want to take medals away from anybody 
and the East German swimmers are paying the price in ill-health. But 
it was not them, it was the system.''
