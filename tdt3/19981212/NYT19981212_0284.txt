Scott Boras, the agent responsible for negotiating Kevin Brown's record-setting 
$105 million contract, went through law school and honed his skill 
as a haggler with nearly two decades of experience. His approach would 
bankrupt him in a flea market, but it works in baseball. When a team 
makes an offer, Boras says, ``No.'' He does not make a counteroffer, 
he just tells the team their offer is not good enough. He does not 
make a specific demand. Boras just says no. And he waits. Incredibly, 
most teams continue to forward blind bids to Boras, whose tactics 
are being adopted by other agents, and the blind bids redefine the 
salary structure. The agents say, no, teams increase their bids in 
increments of tens of millions of dollars, and baseball's competitive 
disparity worsens. Brown's annual salary of $15 million for the Los 
Angeles Dodgers will be nearly double the payroll of the Montreal 
Expos next season. If he pitches 220 innings, he will earn $68,182 
per inning. Sandy Alderson, major-league baseball's executive vice 
president, leaned against a door in the press room here just after 
the Dodgers announced the deal. Alderson wore a slight smile, his 
expression somewhere between bemused and disgusted, and made it very 
clear that the contract appalled him. As the payrolls escalate, he 
said, more and more teams in baseball's middle class will be inclined 
to slash their payrolls and not bother pretending to be competitive. 
How many teams, Alderson was asked, could win the World Series next 
year? ``Twelve to 15 can get into the playoffs,'' Alderson said. That 
means that when the season opens, 15 to 18 teams don't have a chance 
to make the playoffs. Fans of 15 to 18 teams will be buying tickets 
to watch clubs that cannot win. Alderson does not blame the proficiency 
of the agents or the incompetence of those negotiating for the teams, 
feeling only that the agents understand how to exploit the competitiveness 
of the big-market teams. But Alderson was being far too charitable: 
the teams have been incompetent in negotiating. Consider some examples. 
The Baltimore Orioles opened negotiations with first baseman Rafael 
Palmeiro last month by offering a three-year, $22.5 million contract, 
and when Palmeiro balked, the Orioles increased their bid to $32 million 
over four years. At the time, Palmeiro appeared to have no other comparable 
offers. He wanted to sign with Texas, but the Rangers were bidding 
heavily for Randy Johnson. The Orioles could have given Palmeiro a 
deadline. They could have negotiated aggressively and created their 
own leverage by courting Clark simultaneously, and forcing Palmeiro 
to risk losing his best offer. But the Orioles waited just long enough 
for Texas to fall out of the running for Johnson and then forward 
a five-year, $45 million offer to Palmeiro. Only after they lost out 
on Palmeiro did the Orioles sign Clark to a two-year, $11 million 
deal. The Yankees offered Bernie Williams a five-year, $60 million 
deal. Boras, who represents Williams, said no, not good enough. The 
Arizona Diamondbacks' first bid to Williams: eight years, $100 million, 
with much deferred money that reduced the actual value. Boras said 
no. The Boston Red Sox stepped in with a seven-year, $91.5 million 
offer. Boras said no. Finally, the Yankees offered Williams a seven-year, 
$87.5 million deal, a package $50 million greater than they offered 
a year ago. There was no haggling with Boras. He kept saying no. The 
Yankees went from $37.5 millions to $60 million to $87.5 million. 
Most executives around baseball believed that few teams would seriously 
contend with the Mets for the services of catcher Mike Piazza. The 
Mets extended a six-year, $78 million deal offer, a package worth 
$15 million more than any deal given to a position player, a staggering 
bid. Piazza's representatives said no. The Mets increased their offer 
by a year and $13 million; his seven-year, $91 million deal was a 
record for exactly 47 days. The Dodgers surpassed that record by about 
15 percent with their deal for Brown. A year ago, Diamondbacks officials 
met to consider all their options for a starting shortstop, and they 
generated a list that had Jay Bell at the top. Bell is an aging, steady 
shortstop with above-average offensive ability. Jerry Colangelo, the 
Diamondbacks' owner, reportedly left the room for about 20 minutes, 
then returned. ``You've got your guy,'' Colangelo said. While he was 
out of the room, Colangelo had called Boras, who represents Bell, 
and offered a five-year, $34 million deal; executives with other teams 
estimated Bell's worth to be little more than half of that. For once, 
Boras had said yes immediately. He knows a good deal when he hears 
one. Teams, on the other hand, are still trying to understand what 
a good deal is.
