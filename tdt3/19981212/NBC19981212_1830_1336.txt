On the hill tonight, Newt Gingrich has just a few days left as speaker. 
Today he was at home, speaking to the question of what next? NBC's 
kenley Jones reports. It was time for Gingrich to take a bow. After 
serving 20 years in Congress, four as house speaker, he met with his 
supporters in what was called his farewell town meeting. Wow, that's 
pretty overwhelming. Many of his constituents are reluctant to see 
him go. You can't leave, we need you. What a leader he's been. I do 
want to thank you for allowing me to come to your office and you do 
for me, even though I have not voted for you. This was the first time 
Gingrich had met voters face-to face-to explain why he decided to 
resign. He said he had become a distraction. For the last month, because 
I haven't been public, because I haven't said anything, the focus 
really has been on some issues that are pretty important to the country. 
Gingrich said he would not comment on impeachment, except to urge 
voters to tell their congressmen how they should vote. Then came this 
question -- What should the next president do to restore some dignity 
to the office? And what grade are you in? Ninth. So we have a ninth 
grader here asking probably the most appropriate question in the country 
today. Gingrich said if the next president takes his job seriously, 
he will immediately restore respect to the office. Restore to the 
White House the dignity, the honor and the decency which it has so 
clearly lost in the last six years. While Gingrich may be out of his 
constituents' sight for a while, he will not be out of mind. Many 
of them are urging him to run for president in the year 2000. Kenley 
Jones, NBC news, cobb county, Georgia.
