How President Clinton used the power of his office during the investigation 
into the Monica Lewinsky case is the topic of the hour on Capitol 
Hill. The house Judiciary committee is debating whether to recommend 
impeachment for abuse of power. It approved three articles of impeachment 
yesterday. Two accuse Mr. Clinton of perjury, one of obstructing justice. 
Some members from both parties support amending the wording in today's 
article. It concerns Mr. Clinton's attempt to invoke executive privilege 
during the investigation. We should be, even though we are in the 
exercise of the impeachment power, re-emphasizing the power of the 
Congress and the legislative branch. We ought to, while we're doing 
that, set down in history as well, that we revere the office of the 
presidency. And that we want future presidents not to have to reinspect 
the record of these proceedings to determine whether or not they have 
the right to exert executive privilege. If you want an archtype of 
what is wrong with this whole proceeding, you look at that article. 
The gentleman from Pennsylvania, to his credit, has knocked out that 
article and the others like it in his amendment. I'll address the 
articles themselves when we debate those. But, he moves it from, not 
from the sublime to the ridiculous, from the very ridiculous to simply 
the ridiculous.
