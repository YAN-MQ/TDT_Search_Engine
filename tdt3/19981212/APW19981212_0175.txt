Nasteha Noor Kadiye climbed from a truck down a ladder, poked the 
dusty ground with her right toes, then firmly set foot on her homeland 
for the first time in 21 years. ``I am extremely happy to be home 
after a long absence as a refugee,'' Kadiye said with a shy smile. 
After a pensive pause she added, ``However, I don't know what waits 
me as I go about looking for relatives.'' Kadiye still had another 
350 kilometers (220 miles) to travel to her home village of Negele, 
in southern Ethiopia. She had lived in exile from the age of 12 in 
1977, and will have covered 1,530 kilometers (950 miles), mostly on 
foot, by the time she gets home. Kadiye was among 45 ethnic Somali 
refugee men, women and children the U.N. High Commissioner for Refugees 
recently repatriated to Ethiopia, at their request, from a camp in 
Dadaab, Kenya. Peter Kessler, a UNHCR spokesman, said the repatriation 
was not a response to President Daniel arap Moi's recent threats to 
expel refugees, whom he accuses of being responsible for crimes in 
the East African nation. Kadiye's group was flown 400 kilometers (250 
miles) northwest to the Kenyan border town of Moyale, then loaded 
in trucks for the journey to Moiyale, Ethiopia. During the one-hour 
flight, most of the children giggled. The adults were apprehensive. 
From a clear sky, Kadiye stared at the rugged landscape she had traversed 
_ from Ethiopia to Somalia to Kenya _ to escape violence. Ironically, 
she decided to return home partly because her life was once again 
at risk. ``There is too much insecurity here,'' Kadiye said before 
boarding the plane. Armed banditry is rampant in northern Kenya. The 
situation is so bad that UNHCR established a police station in Dadaab, 
and even provided officers with vehicles and walkie-talkies. Refugee 
women were raped when they went to collect firewood, and UNHCR had 
to hire a contractor to provide firewood. Aid workers must be escorted 
by police from their compounds to the three refugee camps around Dadaab. 
The repatriation began Nov. 16 and UNHCR planned to send at least 
2,000 refugees home before the start of the Ramadan, the Muslim holy 
month, Dec. 22. The other 2,500 will follow in January. The Ethiopians 
fled for the first time during the 1977 war between Ethiopia and Somalia, 
most of them crossing the Ogaden desert to Somalia. ``We could not 
flee to other parts of Ethiopia because we were Ethiopian Somalis,'' 
said Ali Hirsi Ashkir, a refugee in Dadaab waiting repatriation. ``Ethiopian 
soldiers were targeting us.'' They settled in camps at Luq, a Somali 
town near where the borders of Kenya, Somalia and Ethiopia meet. Kadiye 
married a Somali man, moved to a nearby village and bore five children. 
Early in 1991, a coalition of Somali rebels ousted the late dictator 
Mohamed Siad Barre, and the country disintegrated into fiefdoms protected 
by clan militiamen. ``Some gunmen attacked our village, and we fled 
into the bush,'' Kadiye said. ``When we thought they had gone we returned, 
and found they were still there.'' In the ensuing fire fight, Kadiye's 
husband and son were killed. She and four surviving children fled 
to Kenya, eventually reaching Dadaab. At the peak of the influx in 
1992, there were 420,000 refugees in camps around Dadaab, mostly from 
Somalia. At the moment only 110,000 remain, including 5,000 Ethiopians. 
Collins Asare, UNHCR chief in Dadaab, said all of the Ethiopian Somalis 
want to go home. ``Their leaders approached us and said they wanted 
to go home,'' Asare said. The Ethiopian Embassy in Nairobi sent two 
officials to ascertain that they are genuine citizens. The refugees 
must be flown to Moyale, Kenya, before crossing the border to Moiyale 
because the roads on the Kenyan side are unusable. ``It is expensive,'' 
Asare said. ``But in the long run, the international community will 
not have to spend money on these people.'' Each refugee _ man, woman 
and child _ receives dlrs 20 in cash once airborne. Their U.N. ration 
cards are taken away. Once in Ethiopia, each receives another dlrs 
20 in the local currency and food for 90 days. Then, they are on their 
own. But they are happy to go home. ``We have heard there is a new 
government at home and there is peace. That is why we are going,'' 
Ashkir said.
