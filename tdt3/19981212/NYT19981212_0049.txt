David Patterson has a dilemma over a gift he wants to give that's 
a doozy. Patterson, who is serving 12 years in California State Prison 
for burglary and drug convictions, gave a kidney to his daughter, 
Renada, three years ago, but the kidney failed. Now Patterson, 38, 
wants to give his daughter, who is 16, his remaining kidney and go 
on dialysis for the rest of his life, possibly a shortened one. Giving 
a living organ is no simple choice. Not only does it have its physical 
components, it can be emotionally taxing for both the giver and the 
recipient. For many recipients, the organ is the gift of life. In 
Patterson's case, physicians are consulting ethicists and lawyers 
on whether the organ transplant violates the Hippocratic injunction 
to ``first, do no harm.'' The question may be mooted if tests show 
that Renada has developed proteins that would cause her to reject 
her father's other kidney. Living donors account for approximately 
17.5 percent of transplanted organs. But of the 3,695 kidney transplants 
from live donors last year, the overwhelming majority came from a 
family member or spouse. Studies show that donors fare quite well 
with a single kidney, and that their life spans are not shortened. 
But when a relative needs an organ, the potential for subtle and not-so-subtle 
coercion on a donor in the immediate family is so great that some 
doctors feel compelled to offer that member an out, sometimes giving 
the impression that the potential donor is not a good match. Organ 
transplants can cement relationships or complicate them. In Minnesota 
two years ago, Dorothy Zauhar's brother donated a kidney to her fiance, 
Richard McNutt, who later broke off the engagement and married a nurse 
in the transplant unit. The Zauhars sued, alleging ``theft by swindle 
of a body organ.'' McNutt's attorney, who denied the allegation, said 
his client considered the kidney ``a gift.'' The judge dismissed the 
case but ordered McNutt to pay Zauhars' hospital bills. The motivations 
of donors who are willing to donate beyond their family circle are 
viewed skeptically. One such donation gave new meaning to the phrase, 
``I gave at the office.'' Nancy Nearing, a 42-year-old Virginia mother 
of two, recently donated a kidney to her boss, Art Helms, a manager 
for Applied Management Systems in Rockville, Md. But she was first 
interviewed by psychiatrists and ethicists, who wanted to be sure 
that hers was a personal gift, not a professional investment. The 
relationships swirling around gifts have long been a favorite subject 
of anthropologists. In his famous 1922 study of Trobriand Islanders, 
Bronislaw Malinowski studied gift exchanges, noting that the rule 
of reciprocity does not underlie every gift to the same extent. Describing 
a spectrum ranging from ``pure gifts'' to ``barter,'' Malinowski said 
that the closer the social ties the greater likelihood of a pure gift. 
Such concepts have been transferred to organ transplants. The ethos 
of organ and blood donation in America is premised on the giving of 
gifts. It is a federal crime to buy or sell organs for transplantation. 
But few gifts come with no strings attached. The medical sociologists 
Renee Fox and Judith Swazey refer to the ``tyranny of the gift'' in 
``The Encyclopedia of Bioethics'' (Free Press, 1978). The authors 
write, ``The donor has made the utmost gift; the recipient has received 
something that is inherently unrepayable.'' In response to these pressures, 
transplant professionals often try to shield the identity of the deceased 
donors from recipients lest any social or emotional entanglements 
arise between donor and recipient families. The National Marrow Donor 
Program, which maintains records on more than 3 million potential 
donors, strives for a middle ground. If both the patient and donor 
wish to meet after a year, the group will arrange a meeting. In fact, 
some donors become very concerned about how a recipient fares. One 
kidney donor committed suicide a few years ago after sinking into 
a deep depression when the recipient became ill. The recipients themselves 
have their own issues. Earlier this year, Kevin Harris, who received 
a kidney from his former college roommate, said on ABC's ``Good Morning 
America,'' ``I feel so unworthy, so completely unworthy of that gift 
from him.''
