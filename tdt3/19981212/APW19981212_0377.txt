Olympic silver medallist Lasse Kjus claimed the season's first downhill 
on Saturday, bringing to an end a two-year winning drought. Twenty-fourth 
out of the start-hut, Kjus took full advantage of improving course 
and light conditions to storm down the 3,129-meter (10,265-ft) classic 
Oreiller-Killy course with a winning time of 1 minute, 43.20 seconds. 
``I generally like a later start number in the downhill,'' said Kjus, 
who finished second in the downhill behind Olympic champion Jean-Luc 
Cretier in Nagano last February. ``This time it really gave me a distinct 
advantage. ``The recent snow on the course was pushed off by the skiers 
ahead of me making the surface harder,'' explained Kjus. ``The conditions 
overall were much better later.'' The 1996 overall World Cup champion, 
Kjus's last victory dated back to March 1997, when the Norwegian won 
a downhill on home snow in Kvitfjell, Norway. ``I really wasn't expecting 
anything special because I'd been through two bad seasons,'' said 
Kjus, who suffered from frequent colds which kept him off the slopes 
until a sinus operation last April alleviated the problem. ``I have 
to say this win makes me very happy ... almost relieved.'' It marked 
the Norwegian's eighth career World Cup win, his fourth in the downill. 
Recording his career best result, Italy's Luca Cattaneo was runnerup 
in 1:43.48. The Italian's previous best was a third place in a super-G 
in Schladming, Austria, last year. ``I was lucky with my start number,'' 
said Cattaneo, whose World Cup ranking is too low to permit him to 
choose his start number. ``When I saw Lasse's time I knew the conditions 
were improving and I could do well, especially after doing well in 
training. ``Though I was lucky this time with my start number, one 
of my goals this season is to rank high enough so I can choose my 
own.'' Cattaneo's teammate Erik Seletto placed third in 1:43.64 for 
his first career podium finish. Though home fans were left disappointed 
when their Olympic hero Cretier was pushed off the podium after holding 
a massive lead for the first half of the race, they were slightly 
consoled with a fourth place by unheralded Antoine Deneriaz. A member 
of France's back-up team, Deneriaz had already shown his potential, 
posting the fastest time in Friday's practice session. Starting 34th, 
the 22-year-old confirmed his training results, crossing fourth in 
1:43.67. ``This fourth place is like a win for me,'' said Deneriaz. 
``I'm really happy and it's a good start to the season. It'll give 
me great confidence going into the next races in Val Gardena, (Italy).'' 
As the conditions continued to improve, several other late starters 
began slipping amongst the top-10. A virtual unknown, Audun Groenvold 
of Norway clocked the fifth fastest time of 1:44.17. Canada's Kevin 
Wert posted his career best result, finishing sixth 1.00 back, after 
missing almost all of last season due to injury. Slovenia's Ales Brezavsek, 
whose best result was a 10th place in the combined last year, tied 
for seventh with Italy's Peter Runggaldier in 1:44.23. ``When I saw 
my time I thought ``today I will win,'''' Kjus said. ``But when I 
saw Luca Cattaneo post a time just .28 slower than mine and the other 
times getting better and better, I was worried and knew I'd have to 
wait until the end of the race before being sure of victory.'' Seeking 
his first career World Cup win, Jean-Luc Cretier was forced to settle 
for 12th in his first downhill on French soil since becoming Olympic 
champion. Tenth out of the start hut, Cretier's time of 1:44.64 held 
as 14 other skiers struggled with the deteriorating light conditions. 
But as the sky began to clear up once more, Kjus took the lead before 
the Frenchman was completely pushed off the podium by later skiers. 
Reigning World Cup downhill champion Andreas Schifferer finished back 
in 29th 2.18 adrift, just ahead of teammate Hermann Maier, the fearless 
skier who won two Olympic golds, the World Cup overall, super-G and 
giant slalom titles last season. Though the Austrians have dominated 
in every discipline since the start of the season, none made it into 
the top-10 in Saturday's downhill. The top Austrian skier was 22-year-old 
Norbert Holzknecht who finished 15th, 1.67 back. The day saw just 
one frightening accident when France's David Pretot was blinded by 
the strobe effect of the tree-shadows on the course, and took a spectacular 
fall. With his left ski failing to pop off during the tumble, Pretot 
injured the lateral ligament in his left ankle. Doctors have yet to 
X-ray the leg for possible fractures.
