Like a grand piano-sized floral arrangement at a mob funeral, historical 
respect has finally been laid before the memory of Charles (Lucky) 
Luciana, who changed his surname to Luciano as a rising young mafioso 
because he somehow thought it was easier to spell. Last week, Time 
magazine included the original Godfather, who consolidated the blood-feuding 
gangsters of the Prohibition era into a centrally supervised criminal 
syndicate that became known as the Mafia, on its list of the 100 ``most 
influential business geniuses of the century.'' Luciano, enthused 
Time, ``used Standard &AMP; Poor's as much as Smith &AMP; Wesson'' 
to succeed in business. But New York City Mayor Rudolph Giuliani, 
a former prosecutor, took issue, pointing out that Luciano's rise 
to the top was based mostly on ``murdering lots of people.'' Whatever 
his recipe for success, Luciano was undoubtedly the mob's first modern 
business visionary. Today's bookshelves are crowded with self-help 
books from celebrated tycoons. If Luciano had written one, here are 
some lessons he might have offered. _ JOE SHARKEY Start Networking 
Early (BEGIN ITALICS HERE) In 1907, the 10-year-old Luciano, a Sicilian 
immigrant on the tough streets of Manhattan's Lower East Side, was 
arrested for shoplifting:(END ITALICS HERE) During the same year he 
started his first racket. For a penny or two a day, Luciano offered 
younger and smaller Jewish kids his personal protection against beatings 
on the way to school. If they didn't pay, he beat them up. One runty 
kid refused to pay, a thin little youngster from Poland, Meyer Lansky. 
Luciano attacked him and was amazed when Lansky gave as good as he 
got. They became bosom buddies after that. _``The Mafia Encyclopedia,'' 
by Carl Sifakis (Facts on File, 1987) Don't Settle for Chump Change 
(BEGIN ITALICS HERE) Luciano dropped out of school and worked briefly 
for $7 a week in a hat factory. But after winning $244 in a craps 
game, he never did another honest day's work.(END ITALICS HERE) ``Who 
wants to wind up being a crumb?'' he remarked to a friend. ``I'd rather 
drop dead.'' _ ``The Luciano Story,'' by Sid Feder and Joachim Joesten 
(Da Capo Press, 1994) All Work and No Play . . . (BEGIN ITALICS HERE)One 
day, when Luciano and an associate were pulled over for running a 
red light on Fifth Avenue, Luciano explained to the officer that the 
arsenal of pistols, shotgun and bullets plainly visible in the back 
seat were actually sports gear.(END ITALICS HERE) ``We just come back 
from hunting,'' was his easy explanation. ``What were you hunting?'' 
``Oh, peasants.' ``Pheasants?'' ``Yeah, that's right. Pheasants.'` 
_``The Luciano Story'' Respond Quickly to Public Relations Crises 
In 1931, Luciano decided that merger and acquisition was the way to 
expand his fledgling mob empire. He lured the reigning kingpin, Giuseppe 
(Joe the Boss) Masseria, to lunch at a Coney Island restaurant, where 
four of his henchmen barged in and riddled the old-timer with bullets 
after Luciano excused himself to go to the men's room. Luciano later 
told reporters that of course he had heard the gunfire: ``As soon 
as I finished drying my hands, I hurried out and walked back to see 
what it was about.'' _``Murder Inc.,'' by Sid Feder and Burton Turkus 
(Farrar, Straus &AMP; Young, 1951) Be Upwardly Mobile ``Prior to Prohibition,'' 
Sol Gelb, a New York criminal attorney in the 1920s, said . . . ``a 
hoodlum was a hoodlum. A fellow who committed crimes never mixed with 
respectable people. (After Luciano) they began to look and act the 
same as respectable people.'' _``Blood and Power: Organized Crime 
in 20th-Century America,'' by Stephen Fox (William Morrow, 1989) Dress 
for Success Luciano's men were ordered to dress neatly and conservatively, 
like office workers, to avoid wide-brimmed hats, loud shirts and ties, 
garish suits completely. ``Let Capone and the Chicago guys do that. 
We won't.'' _``The Last Testament of Lucky Luciano,'' by Martin A. 
Gosch and Richard Hammer (Little, Brown, 1974) ``He leaned maybe a 
degree or two to the liberal side of conservative,'' is the way one 
gentlemen's couturier put it. ``But always in the height of style.''
