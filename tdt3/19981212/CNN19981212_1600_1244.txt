Happy holidays, Kevin brown, you're the highest paid player in baseball 
history. For the next seven years, the righty will be collecting his 
hefty paychecks from the Dodgers. The $15 million per year average 
and $105 million total are both new highs. Anaheim, Baltimore, Colorado 
and St. Louis were also courting the 33-year-old righty, who led San 
Diego to the world series with an 18-7 record and 2.38 era. This player 
has proven that he has the capability of taking a good team and making 
them a championship team. So, Kevin brown is one of those special, 
unique players that can elevate a Team and make them that much better, 
as I said, from being a good team to a Championship team. And he's 
done that the last two years.
