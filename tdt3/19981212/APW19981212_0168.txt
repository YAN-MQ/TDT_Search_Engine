In what appears to be the second collapse of a major Japanese bank 
in less than two months, Nippon Credit Bank Ltd. said financial authorities 
asked it Saturday to formally request the government to take over 
its operations. The Financial Supervisory Agency delivered what effectively 
was an ultimatum to Nippon Credit's president, Shigeoki Togo, after 
determining that the bank was insolvent due to a massive burden of 
bad loans, said a bank spokesman who spoke on condition of anonymity. 
NCB would be only the second bank in Japan to be placed under state 
control since World War II. The government nationalized the Long-Term 
Credit Bank of Japan Ltd. on Oct. 23. Like many other Japanese lenders, 
NCB's bad loans mounted after the collapse of inflated real estate 
prices and stock values in the early 1990s. After meeting financial 
authorities at the Prime Minister's Office, Togo called an emergency 
board meeting to discuss the government's request. Kyodo News agency 
reported that top officials of the bank have agreed to accept the 
government request and become nationalized. The NCB spokesman refused 
to confirm the report, saying the bank plans to respond by around 
noon Sunday. But a government official told reporters that the bank 
will be nationalized Sunday regardless of the board's decision, Kyodo 
News agency reported. The move was widely expected after merger talks 
collapsed between NCB and suitor Chuo Trust and Banking Co. Nippon 
Credit has 2,000 employees and the bank was one of the fifty largest 
in the world, according to a 1997 ranking by Fortune magazine. NCB 
has assets totaling 12.34 trillion yen (dlrs 106 billion), but some 
3.2 trillion yen (dlrs 27 billion) of its loans were at risk of being 
unpaid, according to Kyodo. Nippon Credit is one of three of Japan's 
so-called long-term credit banks. These banks financed the rebuilding 
of Japanese industry following World War II by providing companies 
long-term, low-cost loans. But deregulation has allowed more companies 
to raise money directly from financial markets and the banks have 
failed to find a new role. The government has stepped in to aid NCB 
before. Last April, finance officials asked a group of financial institutions 
and the central bank to contribute to a fund to bailout the lender.
