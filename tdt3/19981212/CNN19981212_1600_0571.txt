You won't be able to see the difference, but there is something new 
about the leaning tower of pisa. It could protect the ancient landmark 
from the ravages of time and gravity. Gayle young reports. It's the 
engineering equivalent of tying a plant to a stake. Workers belted 
the famed leaning tower of pisa and are now slowly stringing thick 
cables to hold it upright. The 700--year-old structure is leaning 
a little too far for comfort. The tower is close to falling yes. If 
we did nothing, it would fall. The tower is one of the world's most 
famous tourist sites. The tower started leaning even before it was 
completed, but the rate at which it is listing is increasing. It's 
now six degrees, that's four meters, off center. Some tourists thought 
the cranes were there because it was about to topple. We thought it 
was going to fall today. Others thought that would be a sight worth 
seeing. I'd like to behere when it happens. The cables are temporary. 
The foundations are sinking into marshland. Suggestions pour in from 
around the world. Throughout the year, visitors seem ready to lend 
a hand. City officials say they want to keep it upright, but not straight 
up. Would you come to see a straight power? no. It's the leaning tower 
of pisa. Everybody comes to see that. I can see stabilizing it, but 
not straightening it. Officials are inclined to agree. A tower that 
leans, but doesn't fall down.
