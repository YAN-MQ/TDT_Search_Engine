It could be a year before doctors in Atlanta know whether an umbilical 
cord blood transplant from an unrelated donor has cured a case of 
sickle cell anemia. A 12-year-old boy was the recipient of that blood 
yesterday at Emory university hospital. It's the first time unrelated 
cord blood has been used specifically to treat that disease. Doctors 
hope cells found in the cord blood will eventually grow into healthy 
new bone marrow.
