President Clinton's future just might be in the hands of 20 moderate 
house republicans. Charles Zewe reports on one such congressman from 
the president's home state. With Japanese drumming and fireworks, 
hot springs, Arkansas, the president's boyhood hometown, dedicated 
its new convention center. All eyes, though, were on this man, congressman 
Jay Dickey. The four-term moderate republican is among the small group 
of house members undecided on impeachment. There will not be one thing, 
not one thing that will be any more important than this. Dickey, who 
opposes censure, says the White House called him and made the president's 
legal defense team available to answer questions he might have. He's 
certainly been getting an earful from his constituents. I think he 
needs to be censured some. I agree what he's done is horrible to the 
office of the president. Does it matter to you, Mac, that it's perjury? 
is it? it is. Let's just move on. Let's just move on. It's going to 
be good for business. I'm not sure we can move on by saying no. On 
a local conservative talk radio show, not a single Clinton backer 
in two hours on the air. This man, if he doesn't resign, he needs 
to be impeached. Perjury is perjury. Dickey, who's district is 76% 
democrat, says he knows there's potential political peril in an "aye" 
vote on impeachment. A "yes" vote, he says, will likely mean a strong 
opponent in 2000 and possible defeat. What's good for the nation whether 
you like him or dislike him is to get him out of office now. The 59-year-old 
lawyer has defied the house republican leadership before. He voted 
with democrats to limit the scope of the inquiry. This vote, he says, 
is about conscience and not politics. I'd rather lose than to violate 
my conscience. Dickey says he'll make up his mind when the full house 
gets the articles of impeachment. Charles Zewe, CNN, hot springs, 
Arkansas.
