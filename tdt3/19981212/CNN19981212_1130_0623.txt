NASA is headed back to Mars to look for evidence of water. Anne McDermott 
has more on the Mars climate Orbiter in this edition of "Tech trends." 
4, 3, 2, 1 -- yes! We have ignition, and we have liftoff! Scientists 
and their families at the jet propulsion lab in pasadena, California, 
"ooh"ed and "ah"ed as the latest 400 million-mile journey to Mars 
got under way. This trip belongs to NASA's Mars climate Orbiter. And 
it's a long trip. The Orbiter won't reach the red planet till next 
September. But once it does, it'll go right to work, orbiting Mars 
to collect information about its surface and atmosphere. A couple 
of months later, it'll be joined by a companion craft, the Mars polar 
lander. It'll actually land on Mars and collect its data from there. 
What for? Well, for one thing, the information might help answer that 
old question about life on Mars. There are clues that the Martian 
landscape had some water once, which may suggest there was some life 
once. And if there was, well, that may help scientists figure out 
why Mars and earth are so different today when once, long ago, they 
had much more in common. Mars lost its atmosphere, and its surface 
temperatures are freezing cold. Yet the earth is just right, kind 
of what we call "the Goldilocks phenomenon." If scientists can eventually 
work out why Mars changed, maybe they could keep the earth's Goldilocks 
effect going, and keep it from turning it into another Mars. Anne 
McDermott, CNN, Los Angeles.
