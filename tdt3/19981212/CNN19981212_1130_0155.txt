President Clinton will become only the third president in U.S. history 
to have articles of impeachment sent to the full house of representativeis. 
Bruce Morton has more. We've come this far only twice before. The 
last time -- impeachment articles against Richard Nixon in 1974. aye. 
Article 1, that resolution is adopted and will be reported to the 
house. That was as far as the formal process went. Before the full 
house could vote, fresh evidence surfaced clearly linking the president 
to the cover up of his campaign's break-in at democratic headquarters. 
Nixon's support crumbled. He resigned. The other time, in 1868, the 
house passed 11 articles of impeachment and sent them to the Senate. 
The surface issue was Congress had said President Johnson couldn't 
fire his secretary of war, edwin Stanton, without congressional approval. 
Johnson fired him anyway and was impeached. But the impeachment was 
really about how to deal with the south. Andrew Johnson was republican, 
Abraham Lincoln's running mate. But he was a democrat from Tennessee. 
He wanted to welcome the white south back, didn't want to give blacks 
the vote right away, opposed the 14th amendment which made them citizens. 
Andrew Johnson was more lenient toward the south than many of the 
radical republicans -- as they were called then in Congress -- expected 
him to be. They, and Stanton, wanted to give blacks the vote, put 
military garrisons in the southern states and so on. Congress passed 
laws to do that. Johnson vetoed them, and impeachment brought the 
quarrel to a boil. His Senate trial lasted 2 1/2 months. In the end, 
seven republicans put their political careers on the line, and johnson 
was acquitted by a single vote. But he'd lost his power. He retained 
his office. He filled out his term. But he was greatly wounded in 
the process and was not very effective. It was 130 years ago, and 
probably isn't a good precedent. Back then, seven republicans broke 
ranks and voted to acquit. Now, 12 democrats would have to join the 
Senate's 55 republicans in order to convict. Bruce Morton, CNN.
