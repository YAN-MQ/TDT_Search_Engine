Day two of the president's cup did not go well for team USA. In fact, 
the international team took 4 1/2 out of a possible 5 points in the 
morning session to take a whopping 11 1/2 to 3 1/2 point lead heading 
into the afternoon. Craig Perry highlighted the session by burying 
a 50-foot birdie chip on the 18th against Fred couples and Tiger Woods 
to win 1-up.
