Underneath all the snide wisecracks and sour insults, all the sweeping 
oratorical flourishes and allusions to history, the debate Saturday 
between Republicans and Democrats on the House Judiciary Committee 
boiled down to a nitty-gritty deconstruction of the precise meaning 
of impeachment. To many Republicans, voting for articles of impeachment 
against President Clinton was a recommendation essentially that lawmakers 
in the full House and Senate consider removing him from office. To 
many Democrats, it was an unequivocal and unwavering endorsement of 
his expulsion. Rep. Henry Hyde of Illinois, the Republican chairman 
of the committee, compared the panel's role to that of a grand jury 
in a criminal case, and even leaned on the words of a Democratic congresswoman 
from Texas who voted for articles of impeachment against President 
Richard Nixon in 1974. ``I just want to agree with Barbara Jordan, 
who made the point that the House accuses and the Senate convicts,'' 
Hyde said. But Rep. Barney Frank, D-Mass., said: ``This is not sending 
the Senate a questionnaire. This is a statement the president should 
be thrown out.'' The argument frequently delved into a legal and etymological 
analysis that sought to clarify an unquestionably hazy concept and 
word. Impeachment receives scant definition in the Constitution, which 
accords it only a few scattered lines of explanation. But the argument 
also betrayed deep partisan suspicions and bitter partisan rivalries. 
Democrats insisted that by defining impeachment as a suggestion instead 
of a command, Republicans were seeking political cover for actions 
at odds with those expressed by a majority of Americans in public 
opinion polls. ``So what we have people now trying to do is to have 
their cake and eat it too, to impeach the president and begin the 
process of expelling him, while denying that that's what they're doing,'' 
Frank said. He added, ``We have had people say: `Well, wait a minute. 
We are not really throwing the president out. Wait a minute, we are 
not really doing much more than sending this to the Senate.''' ``This 
is as much as anybody in this room can do to kick the president out 
and undo the last election,'' Frank continued. To suggest otherwise, 
he said, ``degrades the Constitutional process.'' Republicans, in 
response, said they were in fact abiding by the letter and law of 
that process. Like Hyde, Rep. Lamar Smith, R- Texas, invoked Ms. Jordan's 
statements from the 1974 hearings into Watergate to support that point. 
Smith quoted Ms. Jordan as saying that ``It is a misreading of the 
Constitution for any member here to assert that for a member to vote 
for an article of impeachment means that that member must be convinced 
that the president should be removed from office. ``The Constitution 
doesn't say that,'' Smith read aloud, continuing to quote Ms. Jordan. 
``In establishing the division between the two branches of the Legislature, 
the House and the Senate, assigning to the one the right to accuse 
and to the other the right to judge, the framers of the Constitution 
were very astute. They did not make the accusers and the judges the 
same person.'' Rep. F. James Sensenbrenner Jr., R-Wis., concurred 
with that assessment. ``So what we are doing here is making a determination 
that the offenses that the president is accused of are serious enough 
to warrant a trial in the Senate on that issue,'' he said. The partisan 
enmity that had turned the hearing room so tense on Friday carried 
into Saturday, even as the drooping expressions and strained voices 
of committee members betrayed their exhaustion at the end of a grueling 
week that thrust them into the spotlight of history. Democrats accused 
Republicans of being motivated less by the belief that Clinton had 
committed specifically impeachable offenses than by a desire to be 
rid of a president they simply did not like. `` Mr. Chairman and members, 
this does sometimes, to some people, begin to take on the appearance 
of a coup,'' said Rep. John Conyers Jr., D-Mich. ``It's frightening. 
It's staggering.'' Sensenbrenner said that if it were a coup, it would 
be a particularly pointless one. ``Now should the Senate decide to 
remove the president from office, and we're a long ways away from 
that, Gore will become president,'' he noted. ``Mr. Gore is a man 
of very similar views to Mr. Clinton, and the president and the vice 
president have bragged about how well they get along and how much 
they agree,'' Sensenbrenner said. ``So there's not going to be an 
abrupt change in the policies that the president of the United States 
advances, whether that president be Mr. Clinton or the president be 
Mr. Gore.'' Along those same lines, Rep. Howard Coble, R-N.C., recalled, 
``In the waning hours last night, one of my friends on the other side 
implied that we on this side were trying to get rid of the president 
and being vengeful.'' ``There's no lynch-mob mentality over here,'' 
Coble said, ``and for the benefit of the gentleman who said that last 
night, I've had knots in my gut all week because of this.'' Rep. Sheila 
Jackson-Lee, D-Texas, expressed similar anguish, along with befuddlement 
and regret over the failure of Republicans to be moved by Clinton's 
public apologies for what she called ``a tawdry, adulterous affair'' 
with Monica Lewinsky. ``We now sit to remove this president,'' she 
said in a grave voice. ``We now sit to tell our children, our grandchildren 
that there is no redemption.''
