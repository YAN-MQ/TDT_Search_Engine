The Stanford Cardinal, a team that had never won in six trips to the 
tournament before this season, will challenge Indiana for the national 
title in college soccer Sunday at Richmond University Stadium. The 
Cardinal (18-4-2) has reached the title game with a well-organized 
defense and a great deal of luck, which reached a high point in Friday's 
1-0 semifinal victory over Maryland. Lee Morrison's header bounced 
off the post and off Beckett Holenbach of Maryland before crossing 
the line in the 29th minute of the game. ``To get to the finals of 
any tournament, you need some luck,'' Coach Bobby Clark of Stanford 
said. ``We're very fortunate to get to the final because Maryland 
is a great team and gave us more problems than any team we faced all 
season.'' Stanford's biggest challenge will come Sunday against an 
Indiana team that has few weaknesses. The Hoosiers (22-2) are strong 
and balanced from T.J. Hannig in goal to the last forward on attack. 
They are quick, strong and fast. More important, unlike Maryland against 
Stanford, Indiana can translate their opportunities into goals. For 
the last two seasons, Indiana has been the team with the best credentials 
in the National Collegiate Athletic Association tournament's semifinals. 
The Hoosiers went into the semifinals undefeated last year and lost 
in overtime to UCLA, the eventual champion. In Friday's semifinals, 
they played a Santa Clara team that had defeated them all three times 
in previous meetings. The Hoosiers said they learned a great deal 
from last year and they proved it with a one-sided 4-0 victory, the 
first time a defensive-minded Santa Clara has yielded four goals in 
six years. The Hoosiers are focused and determined to match their 
national championship accomplishments of 1982, 1983 and 1988. Indiana 
proved its worth even more last Sunday in its 2-1 quarterfinal elimination 
of Clemson, the top-ranked team in the country. Even though that was 
a physically and mentally draining effort, the Hoosiers have stayed 
focused. ``The guys know what needs to be done,'' Coach Jerry Yeagley 
said of a possible letdown by his Hoosiers after the victories over 
Clemson and Santa Clara.''
