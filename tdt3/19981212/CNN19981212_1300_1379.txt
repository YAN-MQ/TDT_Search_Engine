Rob Ticktin, "CNN Headline Sports." By the end of the week, seven 
more lives will be saved. By the end of the day, sixteen people who 
couldn't walk, will. By the end of the hour, these special filters 
will help make twenty-five thousand more gallons of water ready for 
drinking. And by the end of this message one more premature baby will 
be protected. All of which is made possible with the help of a material 
we call plastic.
