One person remains missing after yesterday's crash of Thai airways 
flight 261 in southern Thailand. Rescue workers found 45 survivors 
and the bodies of 100 people. Mike Chinoy has more. Searchers were 
able to find the flight recorder in the swamp. Airbus, which made 
this plane is sending a team out from Europe and is expected here 
either later Saturday or on Sunday. The Thai government has set up 
its own team to investigate the cause of the disaster. Thai airways 
officials said that this aircraft had no previous record of any major 
mechanical problems. It was a 12-year-old plane that had logged over 
20,000 hours of flying time with only routine sorts of problems, nothing 
special. At this point, officials are being very cautious. They say 
until investigators examine the black box and piece together the debris, 
they are reluctant to make any kind of guess or engage in any kind 
of speculation about a caused the crash. That was Mike Chinoy reporting 
from Thailand.
