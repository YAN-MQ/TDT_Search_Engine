President Clinton now shares a dubious distinction with former presidents 
andrew Johnson and Richard Nixon. Bruce Morton has more on the history 
of the presidential impeachment process. We've come this far only 
twice before. The last time -- impeachment articles against Richard 
Nixon in 1974. Mr. Connor. aye. Mr. Albert. aye. Article I, that resolution 
is adopted and will be reported to the house. Then that was as far 
as the formal process went. Before the full house could vote, fresh 
evidence surfaced clearly linking the president to the cover up of 
his campaign's break-in at democratic headquarters. Nixon's support 
crumbled. He resigned. The other time, in 1868, the house passed 11 
articles of impeachment and sent them to the Senate. The surface issue 
was Congress had said President Johnson couldn't fire his secretary 
of war, edwin Stanton, without congressional approval. Johnson fired 
him anyway and was impeached. But the impeachment was really about 
how to deal with the south. Johnson was republican Abraham Lincoln's 
running mate. But he was a democrat from Tennessee. He wanted to welcome 
the white south back, didn't want to give blacks the vote right away, 
opposed the 14th amendment which made them citizens. Andrew Johnson 
was more lenient toward the south than many of the radical republicans 
-- as they were called then -- in Congress expected him to be. They 
and Stanton wanted to give blacks the vote, put military garrisons 
in the southern states and so on. Congress passed laws to do that. 
Johnson vetoed them, and impeachment brought the quarrel to a boil. 
His Senate trial lasted 2 1/2 months. In the end, seven republicans 
put their political careers on the line, and johnson was acquitted 
by a single vote. But he'd lost his power. He retained his office. 
He filled out his term. But he was greatly wounded in the process, 
and was not very effective. It was 130 years ago, and it's probably 
not a good precedent. Back then, seven republicans broke party ranks 
in order to acquit. Now, 12 democrats would have to join the Senate's 
55 republicans in order to convict. Bruce Morton, CNN, Washington.
