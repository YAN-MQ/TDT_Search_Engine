Residents of this war-weary capital leapt from their beds and ran 
from their homes early Saturday as a moderate intensity earthquake 
shook the city, killing five people and wounding seven others. The 
earthquake, with a preliminary magnitude of 5.4, was centered about 
150 kilometers (90 miles) north of Kabul in the rugged Hindu Kush 
mountain range, said Malik Salauddin, deputy director of the Pakistan 
Meteorological Center in neighboring Pakistan. The earthquake struck 
shortly before 1 a.m. local time as residents slept. But eyewitnesses 
said that throughout the city people woke from their sleep and left 
their homes. In the area known as Jaday Maiwand five people, including 
four children, died when the ramshackled hotel in which they were 
staying collapsed, said a relative of the children, Shah Mohammed. 
Four of the seven wounded also were relatives of Mohammed. There were 
no other immediate reports of casualties. The capital has been shaken 
by five separate tremors in the past one week say residents. As well 
there were no immediate reports of damage in northern Afghanistan, 
which often is hardest hit by the tremors. In May more than 5,000 
people were killed when an earthquake in northern Afghanistan unleashed 
massive mud slides and flooding that wiped out entire villages. But 
a spokesman for the anti-Taliban alliance, which controls much of 
northern Takhar and Badakshan provinces, some 300 kilometers (180 
miles) north of Kabul, said commanders in the area contacted by radio 
said there were no damages.
