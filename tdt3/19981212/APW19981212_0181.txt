Fred and Wilma and the gang would be proud. A Dutch pilot and flight 
school instructor was unjustly barred from an airport in the northern 
Netherlands for continually singing the theme to ``The Flintstones'' 
over his radio, an appeals board ruled Friday. Wim de Nijs, better 
known in Holland as Capt. Flintstone, had taken his case to the Dutch 
Council of State after the airport in the northern city of Groningen 
had forbidden him from taking off or landing there from March 1996 
to July 1997. Last year, De Nijs was briefly jailed by authorities 
who said he tied up a frequency used by air traffic controllers when 
he bellowed out the theme song to the popular cartoon series _ ``Flintstones, 
meet the Flintstones, they're a modern stone-age family'' _ in English 
for 20 minutes at a time. The Council of State conceded the need to 
keep the airways safe, but said the ban was too harsh because it made 
it difficult for De Nijs, who operated a flight school at the airport, 
to make a living. A defiant De Nijs, meanwhile, has painted a new 
slogan on the side of his small plane: ``Yabba-Dabba-Do Airlines.''
