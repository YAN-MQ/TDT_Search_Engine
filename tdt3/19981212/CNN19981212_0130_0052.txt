Saturday, the house Judiciary committee will vote on the fourth and 
final article of impeachment against President Clinton. The third 
article, charging obstruction of justice, was passed Friday night. 
Two articles charging Mr. Clinton with perjury were passed earlier 
Friday. The fourth article alleges abuse of power. The full house 
will vote on the approved articles next week and whether to recommend 
Mr. Clinton be tried in the Senate. With one exception, all votes 
were split along party lines. Republicans say they're still waiting 
for the president to admit lying under oath. Democrats say vague language 
in his testimony leaves it unclear what should be considered a lie. 
This the beginning of a process which is intended to throw thim out 
of office and you are for a resolution that says you believe he should 
be thrown out of office. There is a reluctance to say we should throw 
him out of office. Therefore, it was perjury zrb-I understand this 
also involved he said it started in February when it started in November 
Mr. schippers he said they had phone sex but it was 55 times. But 
I don't think it is perjury if you do not describe the amount of phone 
sex in adjectives to satisfy Mr. schippers. The vague nis that my 
klieg colleagues pointed out, which statements do you think is perjury, 
it was not simply incompetence they are better drafters than that. 
It was a conscious decision in the one article to confuse and not 
be specific because they do not believe the specifics would justify 
impeachment.
