California recently has enacted new anti-pollution standards that 
are the strictest in the nation. But the rules aren't aimed at automobiles. 
Charles Feldman reports. You think cars produce a lot of pollution? 
Not compared with motorboats and jet skis. This video shot by the 
California air resources board shows just how bad the problem is. 
One Marine engine operated for seven hours can emit as much pollution 
as a Brand new car does over 100,000 miles. Current federal guidelines 
call for new Marine engines to be 75% cleaner in six to eight years. 
But California, long in the forefront of auto pollution legislation, 
is now also on the crest of the wave of Marine engine pollution regulations. 
By 2001, new Marine engines sold in the state will have to be 70% 
cleaner. That rises to 90% by 2008. Cleaner water will be a by-product 
of the new regs, because Marine engines also pollute the water as 
well as the air. A switch from a two-stroke to four-stroke outboard 
engine, which is more efficient, will account for most of the emissions 
reduction. But jet ski dealers worry this may mean slower boats and 
sinking sales. It's like riding a motorcycle in the water, and if 
you have a slow one, as opposed to a fast one, the slow one is not 
going to sell. The newer engines will cost more. But savings in fuel 
should make everything come out even in the wash. Charles Feldman
