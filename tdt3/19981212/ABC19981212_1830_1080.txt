It was a busy day for the astronauts aboard the space shuttle "endeavor." 
They were putting the finishing touches on that seven-story, 35-ton 
complex that will become the world's first international space station. 
ABC's Bill Redeker. After the traditional wake-up call, the shuttle 
astronauts undertook their third and final space walk of the mission. 
And pictures were impressive. As day became night, Jerry Ross and 
Jim Newman cautiously maneuvered around the new international space 
station, preparing it for the next visit in may. They just installed 
a tool bag on top of the station for future use. While they sailed 
240 miles above earth at more than 17,000 miles per hour, they completed 
their chores 45 minutes ahead of schedule. Three connectors are removed. 
Thank you, Jerry. They paused above the pacific to take detailed photographs 
of the space station, and of themselves. Jim, look back at us, please. 
Although the mission has been praised it has not been without criticism. 
Detractors say the $60 billion price tag is too high but the pictures 
today were breathtaking. And there will be more, another 159 space 
walks planned for the next five years. Bill Redeker, ABC News, New 
York.
