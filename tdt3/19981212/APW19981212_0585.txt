The parliament of Bosnia's Muslim-Croat federation on Saturday approved 
a new government, media reported. The new government has a two-year 
mandate and consists of 14 ministers, two without portfolio, led by 
Prime Minister Edhem Bicakcic, state-run Bosnian news agency Onasa 
reported. At its Friday's session, parliament appointed Ejup Ganic, 
a Muslim, and Ivo Andric-Luzanski, a Croat, president and vice-president, 
respectively of the Muslim-Croat half of the country. Under international 
pressure, Bosnian officials took almost three months to implement 
some parts of the Bosnian September's general elections, including 
the federation cabinet. The approval of the new government comes just 
days before the an international council charged with implementing 
the peace in Bosnia is to meet in Madrid, Spain to discuss a peace 
progress in Bosnia. The Madrid conference, to be held Dec. 15-16 is 
yet another attempt by the international community to stabilize the 
political and economic situation in post-war Bosnia. Following the 
1992-95 civil war, international powers divided Bosnia into the Muslim-Croat 
federation and the Serb republic, and deployed a NATO-led peace force 
to ensure stability.
