Israeli warplanes attacked suspected guerrilla hideouts in south Lebanon 
on Saturday, firing missiles and bullets, Lebanese security officials 
said. There were no immediate reports of casualties. There also was 
no word on what prompted the attack. The officials said two Israeli 
planes struck suspected positions of the Iranian-backed Hezbollah 
group in the hills northeast of the Israeli-occupied zone at 12:40 
p.m. (1040 GMT). The jets fired two rockets and strafed the Jabal 
al-Rafih mountain, a Hezbollah stronghold that faces the occupied 
zone, said the officials, speaking on condition of anonymity. Nearly 
two hours later, two Israeli warplanes flew low over suspected Hezbollah 
bases in the western Bekaa Valley, but they did not attack, officials 
said. Anti-aircraft guns of the Lebanese army and Hezbollah fired 
at the jets but missed, the officials added. On Thursday, Israeli 
warplanes broke the sound barrier over Beirut for a second day, prompting 
Lebanon to seek U.N. help in ending what the local media called the 
``sonic bombardment'' of the Lebanese capital. Eight supersonic booms 
caused by low-flying jets rattled windows of apartment buildings in 
Beirut and sent panicky residents scurrying for cover. The Israeli 
flights over Beirut came amid Israeli threats to hit Lebanese power 
plants to retaliate for Hezbollah attacks that killed seven Israeli 
soldiers in southern Lebanon last month. The Shiite Muslim Hezbollah, 
or the Party of God, is fighting to oust the 1,500 Israeli soldiers 
and 2,500 allied Lebanese militiamen of the South Lebanon Army from 
the occupied zone. Israel set up the 440-square-mile (1,100-square-kilometer) 
zone in 1985 to shield its northern towns from cross-border guerrilla 
attacks.
