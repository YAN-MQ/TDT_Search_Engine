Retailers could be smiling this holiday season, if November's sales 
figures are a sign of what's to come. The commerce department reports 
retail sales climbed 0.6% last month. That was pushed by spending 
at department stores and auto showrooms. A separate labor department 
report indicates inflation is on hold at the wholesale price level. 
The producer price index dropped 0.2% last month, fueled by cheaper 
food and energy costs.
