Public interest is high with the remarkable construction job on the 
international space station under way. But there will be 43 more shuttle 
missions to finish the station, and some are wondering if NASA can 
sustain support for the project. Tony Clark reports. The idea of a 
space station has captured the public's imagination at least as far 
back as 1870 with the atlantic monthly tale, "the brick moon." A century 
later, science fiction became science reality as the American skylab 
and the Soviet's Mir and salyut stations were put in orbit. With the 
space race re-ignited, in 1984, President Reagan proposed building 
a permanently manned space station, "freedom," by 1992 at a cost of 
$8 billion. Since then, there have been at least seven major re-designs. 
Objectives have been pared down while the cost estimate has ballooned 
to nearly $100 billion over the ten-year life of the station. Congressional 
opponents tried to kill the space station 19 times, once coming within 
one vote. Critics claim the benefits of a space station do not justify 
the cost. I think that there's benefits in keeping children healthy, 
in educating them, in helping people to maintain the quality of life. 
And that's where we ought to be spending our money. I think its a 
great idea for the future. I just think we need to get other things 
done that are more important right now. Copy three-zero minutes. NASA 
counters that the space station will offer benefits that can't even 
be imagined today, and that's how many of the people we talked with 
feel. Right now, it sounds like a lot. But later on, it'll pay off. 
And I just think it's a great idea to explore space and come to a 
greater understanding of our universe. While public interest in the 
space station appears high now, the real test for NASA will be to 
keep that interest and support over the next five years and 43 more 
space trips until the station is completed. Tony Clark, CNN, Johnson 
space center.
