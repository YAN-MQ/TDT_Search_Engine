European Union leaders worked on a compromise Saturday over granting 
a reprieve for duty-free shopping that lets millions of travelers 
snap up liquor, tobacco and other bargains. Over dinner Friday at 
the EU's year-end summit, British Prime Minister Tony Blair, backed 
by his German and French counterparts, campaigned to save duty-free 
sales for travel within the EU _ at least for now. The summit prepared 
to issue a statement calling for a study into ``the possibility of 
a limited extension'' of duty-free sales in ports, airports, ferries 
and planes in the 15-nation EU. The aim would be to study the economic 
implications, including job losses, that an end to duty-free shopping 
would entail. France sought a five-year stay of execution. Britain 
sought one of ``several years,'' officials said. But Dutch Prime Minister 
Wim Kok _ speaking for an opposing camp that also included Belgium, 
Denmark, Finland and Italy _ rejected a reprieve or said it must not 
last longer than a few months. EU governments voted unanimously in 
1991 to abolish tax-free shopping in June 1999, claiming it was incompatible 
with an union of 15 nations that has no more internal borders. A decision 
to overturn the 1991 extension for duty-free must also be unanimous. 
``We must stick with the decision'' to end tax-free shopping, Kok 
told reporters. The debate briefly pushed weighty issues like defense 
and reform of the EU's dlrs 100 billion budget to the back of the 
summit agenda. Blair is under pressure to rescue tax-free shopping. 
Every year and in huge numbers, Britons take ferries to the Continent 
and stock up on cheap liquor, tobacco, toiletries and other consumer 
goods. Foreign Secretary Robin Cook has called the proposed ban ``the 
most visible and high-profile (EU) decision'' for the British public. 
In continental nations with lower domestic taxes on alcohol, the duty-free 
issue is less contentious. France, Germany, Ireland, Spain and Luxembourg 
backed Britain in seeking a stay of execution. Denmark, the Netherlands, 
Belgium, Finland and Italy, opposed it. As the summit was ending, 
opponents indicated they could live with a short extension for duty 
free while a study was made of the possible loss of jobs that a ban 
would entail. Airlines, shipping companies and labor unions claim 
scrapping the dlrs 6.4-billion-a-year duty-free industry will push 
up the cost of travel and throw some 150,000 people out of work. Supporters 
of abolition say duty-free operators effectively enjoy a subsidy of 
dlrs 2.2 billion a year by not paying duties, giving them an unfair 
advantage over other retailers. The ban only affects sales for travelers 
within the EU. Those traveling to or from the Union will still be 
able to enjoy tax free shopping.
