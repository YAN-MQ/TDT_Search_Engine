That's "business this week," Stan case, "CNN Headline News." Next 
in "Headline Sports," a three-time gold glove winner calls it quits. 
And later, some decades-old science fiction is turning into today's 
science fact. Hi, I'm expecting a fax. Room 212 wants the ammunition 
to deal with her toughest clients. Nothing? Davies, 212. I called 
earlier. Right, fax. It hasn't come yet. I need it for a meeting. 
Excuse me, miss Davies? It just came in. Thank you, so much. Good 
morning, everyone. Business services by Marriott. Another nokia discovery: 
dead batteries... are inconvenient. That's why nokia makes wireless 
phones with more than four hours of talk time and 200 hours of standby 
time. Inspired technology with a human touch. ! Matt Yallof, "CNN 
Headline Sports."
