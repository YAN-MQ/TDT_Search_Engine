It's become almost routine in space, but not quite, Kelly O'Donnell 
reports on the "endeavour." 240 miles above the earth, astronauts 
Jerry Ross and James Newman venture outside the comforts of the shuttle 
"endeavour" for the third time, working while most Americans enjoy 
a day off. On their to-do list today -- installing a tool box just 
outside the space station for the next spacewalkers to use, loosening 
a stuck antenna on the russian Module and testing a rescue jet pack, 
kind of space life jacket which could be used in an emergency to fly 
back to safety. Doors closed and locked. During their last outing, 
a mistake, a couple of tools slipped away and drifted off into space. 
So today, the crew promises to be extra careful. Achieved so far -- 
the first two building blocks for the huge space station were connected, 
the American-made component unity and the Russian Module zarya. By 
earth standards, it's large and heavy, a seven-story tower, some 35 
tons. To finish the work, NASA estimates another 43 missions and 159 
spacewalks will be needed. This crew finishes its mission tomorrow 
and "endeavour" is scheduled to return to earth on Tuesday. Kelly 
O'Donnell, NBC news.
