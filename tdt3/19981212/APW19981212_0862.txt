Richard Holbrooke's latest initiative to find peace does not involve 
pressure cooker diplomacy or threats of NATO air strikes. ``It all 
boils down to cooperation _ the businessmen working together,'' Constantinos 
Lordos, head of a Greek Cypriot business delegation, said Saturday. 
The delegation is here to meet with Turkish Cypriot entrepreneurs 
from the other side of the divided island. Holbrooke's latest attempt 
at peace has targeted not so much the politicians on Cyprus, but its 
business community. U.N.-sponsored reunification talks have failed 
for years to find a way to rejoin the island. Meeting for the first 
time ever on Turkish soil, about 20 business people from the Greek 
and Turkish Cypriot communities will try to find the nuts and bolts 
of peaceful coexistence. ``The general purpose of these meetings is 
to focus on practical everyday problems in the lives of citizens and 
to do it in a framework of mutual benefits,'' said Thomas Miller, 
the State Department's coordinator for Cyprus. With the threat of 
war looming ever closer because of a Greek Cypriot decision to deploy 
Russian-made S-300 missiles on the island later this month, Holbrooke's 
``second track'' diplomacy approach has so far proved much more successful 
than the mainstream method of problem solving _ meeting with political 
leaders. ``This has not been an easy process ... the situation in 
Cyprus has not improved,'' Holbrooke told the business delegates at 
a gathering hosted by billionaire Turkish industrialist Sarik Tara. 
``We are not going to be able to solve the Cyprus problem today,'' 
he added. ``But by coming here, you have shown you want a solution.'' 
On Monday, Holbrooke travels to Athens, Greece, for meetings with 
Greece's ministers of defense and foreign affairs. His goal will be 
to ensure that the missiles are not deployed on Cyprus. One proposal 
is to put them on the Greek island of Crete. Miller discussed the 
S-300s in Cyprus Friday with U.N. representative Dame Ann Hercus. 
After the talks, he said ``the missiles are clearly are a problem.'' 
Turkish Cypriot leader Rauf Denktash, in Ankara for eye surgery, was 
also meeting with Turkish President Suleyman Demirel. ``The Istanbul 
meetings may be a way for the Holbrooke-Miller group to keep their 
initiative going in light of the fact that everything else _ the politics, 
the missiles _ is apparently at a dead end,'' said Marios Evriviades, 
a regional analyst with Athens' Institute for International relations. 
Cyprus has been split into a Greek Cypriot controlled south and a 
Turkish occupied north since 1974 when Turkey invaded and seized its 
northern third in the wake of an abortive coup by supporters of union 
with Greece. A breakaway Turkish Cypriot state in the north is only 
recognized by Turkey, which maintains 35,000 troops there. U.N.-sponsored 
talks froze in 1997, while Holbrooke's efforts were stymied last May 
following a demand by Denktash for recognition of his breakaway state 
and the cancellation of Cyprus' entry talks with the European Union. 
The EU began accession talks with Cyprus earlier this year, after 
rebuffing Turkey for membership. ``It is nothing new to say that this 
has been a difficult year for Cyprus following the EU decision and 
the missiles. Dialogue has broken down and this essentially is all 
that's left,'' said Dan Smith, director of the International Peace 
Research Institute in Oslo, Norway. The Institute, which organized 
the groundbreaking peace meetings between Israelis and Palestinians, 
is co-organizing the meetings here with Columbia University's International 
Conflict Resolution Program. ``All I do hope is to overcome political 
difficulties so we can go on to the real problems. The political will 
is what is lacking,'' said Vedat Chelik, the head of the Turkish Cypriot 
businessmen attending the two-day meeting. In their first meeting, 
held last November in Brussels, Belgium, the businessmen agreed to 
42 joint projects to bring the two communities together. So far, the 
only one that has worked is a telephone exchange set up with Holbrooke's 
help allowing the two sides to speak to each other. Before, Greek 
and Turkish Cypriots had no way of communicating directly. Even today, 
mail sent from one side of Cyprus to the other has to go through Turkey 
and Greece.
