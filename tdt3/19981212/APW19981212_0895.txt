Iranian President Mohammad Khatami ordered his police and intelligence 
services Saturday to step up an investigation into a recent spate 
of mysterious killings and disappearances, the official Iranian news 
agency reported. Khatami gave the order at a meeting of Iran's National 
Security Council, which he chaired in Tehran, the Islamic Republic 
News Agency said in a report received in Cairo. Four government critics, 
including two writers, have been found dead in the past four weeks. 
On Friday, the family of a third dissident writer, Mohammad Jafar 
Pouyandeh, said he had been missing since Wednesday. On Dec. 9, the 
body of Mohammad Mokhtari, a writer who disappeared the previous week, 
was found dumped on the outskirts of Tehran. The New York-based Human 
Rights Watch said marks on Mokhtari's head and neck indicated that 
he had been killed, possibly by strangulation. Last month, Majid Sharif, 
another writer, disappeared and was later found dead, but his family 
said he may have died of a heart attack. Also last month, the head 
of an Iranian opposition group, Dariush Foruhar, and his wife, Parvaneh, 
were stabbed to death in their home. Increasingly, hard-line opponents 
of Khatami are resorting to violence to deal with opponents. Over 
the past year, vigilantes have attacked dissidents, liberal newspapers 
and even a reformist Cabinet minister. Nobody has been charged in 
the attacks, leading to suspicions that the campaign is being backed 
by powerful persons in the ruling hierarchy. Police say they had made 
arrests in connection with the killings, but the findings have not 
been made public. Human Rights Watch has demanded an investigation 
into the killings, saying they are part of an ``increasingly sinister 
pattern of harassment and persecution of government critics in Iran.
