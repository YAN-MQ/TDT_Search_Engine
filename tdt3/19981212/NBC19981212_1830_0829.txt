After an all-day transatlantic flight, the president tonight landed 
in israel. His mission is to Muster all the authority he can in the 
Middle East and save the peace deal that was signed in the states 
a few weeks ago. NBC's Claire Shipman is traveling with the president 
and joins us tonight from Jerusalem. Good evening, Claire. Brian, 
it would be hard to exaggerate the amount of pressure Bill clinton 
is facing on this trip. Eight hours into his flight to an extraordinarily 
tough diplomatic mission, he learned that the fourth article of impeachment 
had been passed. He didn't have any comment on the plane about the 
vote, and he does have plenty here in the next few days to keep his 
mind somewhat off the issue of impeachment. It was meant to be a celebration 
of the recent wye accord. Instead, the president is trying to salvage 
the move toward peace as each side accuses the other of backing out 
on the agreement. The United States will walk this road with Israel 
every step of the way. Prime minister Benjamin Netanyahu is also in 
political peril in large part because of his concessions at wye. And 
he made an unusually tough welcoming statement. It must be honestly 
said that in the last few weeks, our partners have not kept these 
commitments and reverted to past practices. While the timing of Clinton's 
visit might not be welcome for netanyahu, the Palestinians are thrilled 
and are preparing lavishly for the first-ever trip by a U.S. president 
to Palestinian-held territory. The trip has been marred for both sides 
by violence in recent days, and security is a top priority. The president 
will spend the day in Jerusalem tomorrow, meeting with netanyahu, 
and again speaking on the virtues of peace. But the most controversial 
day is Monday and the trip to Gaza to witness the changing of the 
Palestinian charter to remove language about the destruction of the 
state of Israel. Israelis want a formal vote. The U.S. isn't promising 
that. And Israel worries that the visit itself is an unofficial nod 
to palestinian statehood. For the most part, despite the president's 
troubles this year, his trips abroad have given him a boost. But this 
may be one that is difficult to weave into a diplomatic triumph. NBC's 
Claire Shipman in Jerusalem, thank you.
