Malaysian authorities sent hundreds of riot police to the country's 
largest stadium, where fans at a soccer final were expected to demand 
the ouster of Prime Minister Mahathir Mohamad. Dozens of police vans 
and two water-cannon trucks were stationed around the perimeter of 
the 100,000-seat stadium packed with soccer fans cheering for their 
teams from the central states of Perak and Terengganu. Police stood 
stiffly at strategic locations around the glittering stadium, built 
specially for the 16th Commonwealth Games in September. No trouble 
or protests were reported as of 11:00 p.m. (1500 GMT), with the teams 
from Perak and Terengganu still playing to a 1-1 draw in the second 
half. Dozens of street protests, some of them violent, erupted in 
Malaysia after Mahathir fired his deputy, Anwar Ibrahim, on Sept. 
20. Since Anwar's sacking and his arrest eighteen days later, demonstrators 
have demanded Mahathir's ouster and justice for Anwar, who calls the 
charges against him politically motivated. Hundreds of people have 
been detained in the rallies and police have warned that they would 
come down hard on participants in the banned protests. A number of 
demonstrations have been scheduled for the past several weekends, 
but the turnout has been a fraction of the several thousand Anwar 
supporters who had gathered regularly since his arrest. Anwar is on 
trial on 10 counts of corruption and illegal sexual acts. He denies 
the charges and says they were fabricated because Mahathir considered 
his popularity a threat to his 17-year rule.
