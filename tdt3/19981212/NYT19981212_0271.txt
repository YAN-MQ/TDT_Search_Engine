There was less than eight minutes to play Saturday, and the New Jersey 
Devils trailed the Colorado Avalanche by a goal. That might lead you 
to believe that the Devils had their opponents right where they wanted 
them. The Devils had rallied from behind in five of the previous six 
games, winning four and tying two, and on this day, they did it again, 
dominating the third period to win 5-3 at Continental Arena. But the 
Devils were hardly celebrating after this one, aware that eventually 
they may dig themselves a hole from which they cannot escape. The 
Devils seemed to wake up for the final period. They outshot the Avalanche 
15-3 in the final 20 minutes, scoring four goals. Although their seven-game 
unbeaten streak leaves them with a league-best 37 points, the Devils 
were not satisfied. ``I don't want to even talk about it,'' said Bobby 
Holik, who scored two of the third-period goals. ``This is not the 
way we want to play, just cruising through the first two periods and 
then picking it up in the third. It's not the way the team is built 
to play. It's going to stop happening. We feel we can do it, but what 
we did in the third period, let's do it from the start.'' The Devils 
seemed poised to, scoring a power-play goal by Denis Pederson just 
1 minute 26 seconds into the game. But the Avalanche, in the final 
game of a four-game trip and playing without its captain, Joe Sakic, 
tied the score when Christian Matte deflected the puck past Martin 
Brodeur with his skate with 2:08 remaining in the first period. Jeff 
Odgers scored midway through the second period, and Colorado carried 
a 2-1 lead into the final period. Holik, playing in the third period 
on a line with Randy McKay and Krzysztof Oliwa, tied the score at 
4:49 of the third period. Holik's slap shot from just inside the blue 
line was turned away, and goaltender Criag Billington turned deflected 
Oliwa's attempt on a rebound. The puck bounded right to Holik, who 
stuffed it in the open right side. But Colorado took the lead just 
2:09 later, making Saturday's comeback a little more dramatic. Brian 
Rolston tied the score with 7:48 to play, stealing a cross-ice pass 
in the Colorado zone and skating in on net, faking a forehand and 
then slipping a backhand shot into the lower right corner. The Devils 
kept the pressure on, and 1:04 later, Holik won a faceoff from Chris 
Drury in the Colorado zone, sending the puck to Sheldon Souray at 
the right point. Holik headed toward the net and Souray's slap shot 
was redirected off his stick past Billington. Holik fed McKay for 
a goal with 29 seconds remaining. ``This is not the way we want to 
play,'' Holik said. ``Yes, we have the ability and it's in the back 
of our minds, but let's not use it too often. It's very draining mentally 
and physically on the team.'' SLAP SHOTS: Krzysztof Oliwa was the 
victim of a vicious check by Colorado's Wade Belak earlier this season, 
and the two squared off just 1:34 into Saturday's game. Belak's right 
leg was twisted awkwardly beneath him. He had to be helped off the 
ice and was taken to a hospital, where it was determined that he had 
a bruised knee.
