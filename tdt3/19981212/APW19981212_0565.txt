Palestinian police helped quell anti-Israel protests on Saturday, 
hours before U.S. President Bill Clinton was to arrive in the region 
_ a sign of Palestinian leader Yasser Arafat's determination to smooth 
the visit. In Palestinian-administered Bethlehem, Palestinian protesters 
stoned Israeli soldiers guarding the entrance to the city. The troops 
_ positioned below a banner put up by residents declaring ``Bill Clinton: 
Welcome to Palestine'' _ responded with tear gas and rubber bullets. 
The Palestinians see Clinton's visit as a mark of recognition of the 
independent state which they intend to declare in the coming year. 
A few minutes before the fighting broke out, a family set up Christmas 
decorations on a balcony directly above the banner. Palestinian police 
later moved in to contain the protesters. Clinton was to light a Christmas 
tree Monday in the town believed to be where Jesus was born. The visit 
was meant to celebrate the U.S.-brokered agreement achieved at Wye 
River in October; instead, Clinton will be trying to salvage it. The 
Palestinians are angry that Israel refuses to release Palestinians 
jailed for anti-Israel activities and has instead freed mostly common 
criminals to meet its prisoner release commitments. The Israelis accuse 
the Palestinian Authority of being behind the wave of violence that 
broke out last month over prisoner releases. Two Palestinian protesters 
killed in clashes Friday in the Palestinian-administered town of Qalqilya 
were buried Saturday.
