President Clinton steps out of proverbial frying pan and into the 
fire today. Mr. Clinton left the house impeachment debate behind for 
a three-day trip to the mideast. The president will try to salvage 
October's wye river land-for-security deal between Israel and the 
Palestinians. The agreement ran into a roadblock after Israel refused 
to remove troops from the West Bank as previously agreed. U.S. officials 
hope to arrange a three-way summit between Mr. Clinton, palestinian 
leader Yasser Arafat and Israeli prime minister Benjamin netanyahu.
