After lasting less than 30 minutes, negotiations aimed at stopping 
the lockout in the U.S. National Basketball Association ended abruptly 
Saturday. It was a sign that the 1998-99 pro basketball season could 
be in more serious jeopardy than ever as the sides fight over the 
terms of a new collective bargaining agreement. And it now appears 
certain that a season _ if there is one _ won't begin until the end 
of January or early February. Commissioner David Stern, deputy commissioner 
Russ Granik and their lawyers emerged dour-faced from the union's 
law office after the meeting, which was one of the shortest in length 
since the lockout began 5 1-2 months ago. ``We're getting nowhere,'' 
Granik said. ``We learned today that basically nothing has changed 
at all.'' The breakup came after the union told the league where it 
was willing to make some movement, a union attorney said. But the 
offer was not good enough to keep the sides at the negotiating table. 
No new talks are scheduled. ``The reality is that the issues that 
we raised were extremely significant and pertinent, but they continue 
to be intransigent,'' union director Billy Hunter said. ``We're trying, 
we'll continue to try, but it's still a situation where it's necessary 
for us to fall on the sword. ``We're being extremely reasonable, but 
how much is enough? That's the issue.'' The lockout is essentially 
a strike by the owners. Under American labor law, without a contract 
_ or in this case a collective bargaining agreement, owners can prohibit 
_ or lock out _ players from working until a deal is reached. The 
collective bargaining agreement (CBA) is the ground rules which sets 
things like minimum salaries, pension and health insurance benefits, 
roster limits and a salary cap. The biggest issue in this work stoppage 
is money. The owners have insisted on maximum salary costs and the 
union has refused to accept a ``hard'' salary cap. The league has 
a limit each team can spend on salaries, but the so-called ``Larry 
Bird'' exemption allows clubs to disregard the cap to re-sign their 
own free agents. It virtually makes the salary cap an invisible ceiling. 
So far, the first two months of the season have been scrapped as the 
sides have fought over how to divide about dlrs 2 billion in projected 
annual revenues. The owners have asked for a 50-50 split, while the 
players have tied many of their concessions to receiving 60 percent. 
Saturday's meeting was the second between the sides in three days, 
and the site was meant to be a secret. Stern, Granik and their attorneys 
were among the attendees for the league, while the union was represented 
by Hunter, Patrick Ewing, Herb Williams and at least two lawyers.
