Sources tell CNN house democratic leader Dick Gephardt is demanding 
a Censure resolution be brought to the house floor. He wants it to 
be introduced so there will be an alternative to impeachment. The 
sources say Gephardt is sending his demand in a letter to speaker-elect 
bob Livingston later today. Without a censure option, the White House 
fears many undecided republicans will feel they have no choice but 
to vote for at least one article of impeachment.
