Today is heisman trophy day in college football, and there is little 
doubt who will walk away with the honor. Ricky Williams has absolutely 
owned college football this season. The longhorns' halfback became 
division 1-A's leading rusher this season, breaking Tony dorsett's 
22-year-old Mark. Kentucky's Tim couch, UCLA's cade McNown and Kansas 
state's Michael Bishop are the other finalists. USC's Chris Claiborne 
captured the Butkus award as the nation's top linebacker.
