The New York Mets kept waiting Saturday in negotiations for Rickey 
Henderson and Roger Clemens. General Manager Steve Phillips said that 
he had amended his offer to the free-agent outfielder Henderson during 
a 20-minute meeting with his representatives. ``Not the financial 
terms, though,'' Phillips said of the offer, which is believed to 
be for one year at about $1.7 million with incentives and an option 
for a second year. The Mets were scheduled to meet with Henderson's 
representatives again tonight. As for Clemens, who has demanded a 
trade, Phillips said he had spoken briefly with Toronto GM Gord Ash 
Friday. ``They didn't tell us we were out,'' Phillips said.
