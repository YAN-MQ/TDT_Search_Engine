The number one soft drink company is becoming even bigger. Coca-Cola 
is plunking down $2 billion for cadbury schweppes beverage brands 
outside the United States. Greg clarkin has more. For the second time 
in three months, Coca-Cola executives summoned analysts to New York 
to tell them earnings will fall short of expectations. Weak economies 
in Latin America, Asia and eastern Europe will keep fourth quarter 
profits about 20% below Wall Street expectations. There was no major 
improvement in the markets that were problematic in the third quarter 
continue to be problematic. Whether it's Russia, Germany, Japan or 
selected markets. At the same time, Coke is expanding internationally. 
The company announced it is buying the overseas rights to such well-known 
brands as Dr. pepper from cadbury schweppes. The price tag, $1.8 billion. 
This is a great company. I think the cadbury deal is a really smart 
one, strategically. I think this moves Coke one step closer in terms 
of -- gone from being just a Cola, soft drink company to really being 
a total beverage company. Solomon upgraded the stock, saying the deal 
with cadbury boosts coke's growth prospects. But the stock has lagged 
in the broader market and is now down slightly for the year. Analysts 
say Coke executives were upbeat about 1999, saying growth should accelerate 
in the second half. But with many of Coca-Cola's key overseas markets 
still in economic turmoil, analysts are saying the first half of next 
year will continue to be a challenge for Coca-Cola's management. Greg
