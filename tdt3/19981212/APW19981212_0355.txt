Residents of this war-weary captial leapt from their beds and ran 
from their homes early Saturday as a moderate intensity earthquake 
shook the city. The earthquake, with a preliminary magnitude of 5.4, 
was centered about 150 kilometers (90 miles) north of Kabul in the 
rugged Hindu Kush mountain range, said Malik Salauddin, deputy director 
of the Pakistan Meteorological Center in neighboring Pakistan. The 
earthquake struck shortly before 1 a.m. local time as residents slept. 
But eyewitnesses said that throughout the city people woke from their 
sleep and left their homes. The capital has been shaken by five separate 
tremors in the past one week say residents. There were no immediate 
reports of damage in northern Afghanistan, which often is hardest 
hit by the tremors. In May more than 5,000 people were killed when 
an earthquake in northern Afghanistan unleased massive mudslides and 
flooding that wiped out entire villages. But a spokesman for the anti-Taliban 
alliance, which controls much of northern Takhar and Badakshan provinces, 
some 300 kilometers (180 miles) north of Kabul, said commanders in 
the area contacted by radio said there were no damages. The Taliban 
religious militia rules about 90 percent of Afghanistan, including 
the capital of Kabul. However, the militia is locked in a fierce battle 
with its opponents on several battle fronts north of Kabul On Friday 
a raging artillery duel rocked the battlefield barely 20 kilometers 
(12 miles) north of Kabul. The Taliban said they held their ground 
and they claimed to have killed dozens of opposition soldiers. However, 
the claim could not be independently confirmed.
