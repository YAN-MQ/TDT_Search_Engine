President Clinton arrived in Israel just before midnight on Saturday 
on an intricate mission to revive the peace effort, a centerpiece 
of his foreign policy. On a cool, overcast night, Clinton was greeted 
with trumpets and an honor guard, but also with flinty remarks from 
Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, who declared that the Palestinians 
had not kept their commitments ``and have reverted to past practices.'' 
In an extraordinary moment of symmetrical political peril, the arrival 
ceremony brought together two men who are facing crises of confidence 
in their leadership, each of whom has reason to fear the other's potential 
impact on his own precarious position. The House will vote late this 
week on Clinton's impeachment, and just days later the Israeli parliament 
is scheduled to hold a vote of confidence in Netanyahu's government. 
In a brief, sober address, Clinton _ who is traveling with his wife, 
Hillary, and daughter, Chelsea, _ expressed understanding of Israeli 
concerns. ``We are determined that Israel's just requirements for 
security be met,'' he said. But he added that ``for two peoples who 
are fated to share this land,'' peace was ``the only choice that can 
avert still more years of bloodshed, apprehension and sorrow.'' Netanyahu 
shattered his support on the right and jeopardized his hold on office 
by cooperating with Clinton in October and agreeing to cede more land 
to the Palestinians, under an accord reached at the Wye River Plantation 
in Maryland. Now, when failure of that agreement could make Clinton 
look weak, Netanyahu has every reason not to see it through. And the 
president risks further erosion in his congressional support if he 
is seen as leaning too hard on the Israelis. In his nine-minute remarks 
_ three times as long as the president's _ Netanyahu warned, ``Agreements 
not anchored in security, agreements which only serve to conceal belligerent 
aims, agreements brazenly flouted and violated with violence inevitably 
lead not to peace but to the continuation and intensification of conflict.'' 
With impeachment and his stewardship of foreign affairs linked in 
the minds of many members of Congress, Clinton is under intense pressure 
to perform during his three-day visit. ``Does he have the trust and 
credibility to build an international coalition?'' asked Rep. Rick 
Lazio of New York, one of two House Republicans undecided on impeachment 
who are among a large congressional delegation accompanying Clinton. 
The other is Jon Fox of Pennsylvania. During the flight from Washington, 
Lazio said he would speak with Clinton about impeachment if the president 
broached the subject, but would not bring it up. ``I'm sure he's laboring 
under a good deal of anxiety, about this trip and about the outcome 
of the vote,'' he said. But Sen. Arlen Specter, R-Pa., also on the 
trip, said Clinton was ``wonderful'' and in ``apparent good spirits.'' 
Aides to the president said he spent most of the 10-hour flight in 
his cabin with his family. The House Judiciary Committee approved 
a fourth article of impeachment, charging abuse of power, less than 
two hours before Clinton's jet pulled up at Ben-Gurion Airport in 
Tel Aviv. In contrast to the wary Netanyahu, Yasser Arafat, the Palestinian 
leader, is thrilled that Clinton is here. On Monday and Tuesday, the 
president is to tour Palestinian territory in Gaza and Bethlehem, 
in what many Palestinians are seeing as tacit recognition of statehood. 
Specter said the United States did not recognize a Palestinian state. 
``The president feels the same way,'' he said. ``But others are seeing 
it differently, and it is causing anguish in some quarters in Israel. 
For that reason, I hope the president will find the occasion to say 
something about it while on the trip.'' Specter said Netanyahu had 
``paid a terrific price for the withdrawals,'' while the Palestinian 
leadership ``has a lot to prove.'' In particular, he said, the Palestinian 
National Council, with Clinton in attendance, must vote on Monday 
to rescind clauses in the Palestinian charter calling for Israel's 
destruction.
