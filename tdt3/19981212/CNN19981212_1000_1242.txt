Let's begin in the land down under where the Americans find themselves 
way behind a team of international players after two days of the president's 
cup. The international team has accumulated 14 1/2 of the necessary 
16 1/2 points to win the cup. The American's is a great side. I mean, 
you kind of look at the scoreboard and say they haven't played well. 
But they're a great side. We do have an advantage with the golf course 
because it has been windy. And that's been a big advantage. And I 
think, you know, the Americans have all had long years where they've 
all, you know, played so well during the year. And some of our guys 
have been injured, like Elkington and myself. And, you know, so we're 
actually keen to play. So that's sort of making up for some of the 
differences. And the Japanese guys have really knocked in well. So 
I think what we're lacking a little bit in straight firepower, we're 
making up in teamwork. And that's what's great about team competition.
