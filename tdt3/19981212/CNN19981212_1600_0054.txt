It's another busy day for the house Judiciary committee. After approving 
three articles of impeachment against President Clinton yesterday, 
the committee today approved a fourth and final article. It charges 
Mr. Clinton with abuse of presidential power for allegedly lying to 
Congress. The panel is now considering a democratic resolution of 
censure as an alternative to impeachment. But the measure will probably 
be defeated. The White House is again going on the offensive against 
republicans on the committee. The republican majority in the house 
Judiciary committee voted to send articles of impeachment to the House 
of Representatives. They did this in series of straight party line 
votes. While the goal of the partisan majority on the committee is 
to impeach the president and remove him from office, the certain result 
will be to divide the country, gridlock the government and defy the 
will of the people. Democrats are now making the case for censure, 
but republicans aren't buying it.
