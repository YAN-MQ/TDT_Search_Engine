This is meteorologist Valerie Voss with your "CNN Headline News Weather" 
forecast for Sunday. Wet weather will continue to move slowly through 
the southeastern states into the carolinas and Florida with rain showers, 
generally, but a few thundershowers possible in Florida. The weather 
remains quiet across New England and the Great Lakes, the plains states 
and southwest. But a strong cold front in the northwest will bring 
more rain, mountain snow and also some very strong and gusty winds. 
Highs on Sunday -- 30s and 40s across most of the north and some 60s 
and 70s into the south. Maybe a couple of 80s in southern Florida. 
Looking ahead to Monday -- rain, snow and wind push toward the northern 
rocky mountains with some cooler weather. On Tuesday, temperatures 
look pretty typical, warming up a bit in the southeast with generally 
quiet weather. Wednesday, rain showers in the northwest, snow showers 
around the Great Lakes, temperatures ranging anywhere from 20s to 
70s and a couple of 80s. Don't forget, four-day forecast at CNN.com.
