A new CNN/"USA today" Gallup poll taken after the committee approved 
the first article suggests that American support for impeachment has 
changed little. Roughly a third of those surveyed think the Judiciary 
committee should vote to impeach President Clinton. An equal number 
also think Mr. Clinton should resign and turn the presidency over 
to vice President Gore. 63% say he should not resign. 58% of those 
polled think Congress should vote to censure Mr. Clinton. 38% disagree.
