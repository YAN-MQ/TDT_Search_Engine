Researchers say American teenage boys are saying "no" to sex more 
often. A survey by the urban institute finds the percentage of young 
men between the ages of 17 and 19 who say they had at least one sexual 
experience dropped from 75% in 1988 to 68% in 1995. Researchers say 
the decline is partly because of fear of AIDS and because teens are 
becoming more conservative.
