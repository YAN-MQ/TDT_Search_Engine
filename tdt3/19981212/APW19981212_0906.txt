Catholic militants burned at least eight vehicles and threw gasoline 
bombs at police lines Saturday after angry Protestants marched down 
a restricted route through Londonderry. Riot police clad in flak jackets, 
helmets and shields prevented either side from getting into contact 
with the other, and as a result came under attack from both sides. 
They arrested three people _ two Catholics, one Protestant _ but reported 
no serious injuries. Earlier, some of the Protestant marchers from 
the Apprentice Boys fraternal group clashed with police who prevented 
them from parading a second time into the central square of the predominantly 
Catholic city. A government-appointed commission supposed to minimize 
trouble over traditional Protestant marches ruled this week that the 
march could pass through the central square, called the Diamond, in 
the morning but not in the afternoon. When the marchers passed in 
the morning, Catholic youths shouted abuse and threw stones and bottles 
from a nearby street. The senior police commander on the scene, Assistant 
Chief Constable Alan McQuillan, noted that ``people on both sides 
were determined to cause trouble.'' ``We tried to retain an atmosphere 
of normality today but unfortunately that was impossible,'' McQuillan 
said. The march commemorates the start of the 1688-89 siege of Londonderry 
by the forces of King James II, a Catholic. Each year it ends with 
the ritual burning of an effigy representing Lundy, the compromising 
commander of Londonderry's Protestant garrison who recommended handing 
over control of the city to James. To this day, a favored Protestant 
term of abuse is to call someone a Lundy. In August, the Apprentice 
Boys march again to commemorate the Protestants' triumphant end of 
the siege. It, too, often triggers street violence. The group is named 
in honor of 13 teen-age apprentice workers who bolted the gates of 
the walled city in the face of James' forces. Meanwhile, the Sunday 
Times newspaper of London reported that the Irish Republican Army 
has appointed one of its most hard-line figures as its new chief of 
staff, the most senior post. The report identified Brian Keenan, 56, 
as a stern opponent of disarmament who was skeptical of current peace 
efforts. The report also said the top two figures in the IRA's allied 
Sinn Fein party, Gerry Adams and Martin McGuinness, were re-elected 
to the IRA's seven-member ruling Army Council at a secret meeting 
last weekend. McGuinness, another reputed former chief of staff, is 
liaising between the IRA and a Canadian-led commission that April's 
peace accord empowered to seek the disarmament of the IRA and pro-British 
paramilitary groups by mid-2000. On Friday the IRA reaffirmed its 
opposition to even a token gesture on disarmament. The group called 
a cease-fire in July 1997 after killing about 1,800 people in its 
abortive campaign to overthrow Northern Ireland as a Protestant-majority 
state linked with Britain.
