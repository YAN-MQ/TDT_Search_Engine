President Clinton is away from the political cross fire, at least 
for now. He and his family are on a three-day trip to the Middle East. 
The president is trying to preserve the fragile agreement between 
Israelis and Palestinians, which he helped negotiate in October. Since 
agreeing to hand over more of the West Bank, Israeli prime minister 
benjamin Netanyahu has lost some of his political support and faces 
a vote of confidence in the Knesset next week. He has delayed implementing 
the agreement during a round of violent palestinian protests.
