With all the attention being paid to impeachment, the departure of 
Newt gingrich is going largely unmentioned. He the controversial in 
Washington but, he is loved home in Georgia. That was apparent today 
as he held a final town meeting with constituents. Rebecca chase was 
there. For someone who had so openly pushed for impeachment, today 
speaker of the house Newt Gingrich had only a few words about this 
actual proceeding. Every American should make up their own mind as 
a matter of conscience, and then on a constitutional matter should 
feel very free to communicate with their member of Congress. And I 
don't think any of us need to say a word beyond that. Gingrich did 
admit that in the past, his words about impeachment and other subjects 
had gotten him in trouble. But he said that's not the only reason 
he is stepping down. As long as I was speaker, I was the excuse. The 
fact is that I was the excuse for Clinton. I was the excuse for republicans 
who didn't want to learn to be a majority. I was the excuse for this 
media that does not want to think about issues. In this final town 
hall meeting, Gingrich was warmly received. In fact, people lined 
up. To praise the speaker. As a dedication of a home built by habitat 
for humanity, Gingrich said he planned to continue working on the 
causes he believes in, such as saving social security. He will also 
rethink his public and personal failings. I think it's an objective 
reality that I'm a sufficiently vocal and polarizing personality. 
Speaker Gingrich says he may be leaving public office, but not public 
life. He says his hope for the future is to generate less publicity 
and make more money. Rebecca chase, ABC News, roswell, Georgia.
