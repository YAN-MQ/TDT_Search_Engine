The impeachment committee eased into its final day with a sense of 
political hangover, a somber wistfulness at having irrevocably done 
the deed. Members of the House Judiciary Committee quietly sipped 
coffee in the hearing room doorways Saturday morning and munched muffins 
at their microphones, as the Republicans' fourth and final article 
of impeachment loomed on a gray day. For the Democrats, there was 
no sign of optimism as they proffered their last-ditch attempt to 
substitute censure as a more merciful and inviting solution for the 
nation. ``Time permitting,'' the Judiciary Committee chairman, Henry 
Hyde of Illinois, said of the chances for considering the Democrats' 
hope as he gaveled the committee to order 40 minutes late. ``This 
is not a game,'' said Sen.-elect Charles Schumer of New York as the 
Democrats quickly re-stoked their anger at the impeachment bill. ``There's 
just a lot of poorly drawn verbiage here saying: `We want that man 
out.' '' Lurking about the proceedings all week was a Democratic warning 
that the Republicans may be putting their House majority on the line 
in the next election by pressing the unpopular impeachment vote. ``Beware,'' 
the Republicans were cautioned by Zoe Lofgren, D-Calif.. ``Next election, 
the voters will be out to get you.'' For both sides, the bluntest 
distinction between Watergate and the effort to impeach President 
Clinton was stated by Howard Coble, R-N.C., who noted that the Republicans 
are in the congressional majority this time while the Democrats were 
in 1974. ``It's a lot easier to throw grenades than to catch them,'' 
Coble said with some satisfaction. Fresh history needs fresh souvenirs. 
And so the committee kept the gavels moving the way ceremonial flags 
briefly wave over the Capitol, the better to create them in volume, 
the same way that pens are wielded by the fistful at a presidential 
bill signing. In the eyes of Democrats, these symbolic hammers of 
law and order, however, had a macabre aspect in being brandished at 
a far grimmer event, the committee's presidential impeachment vote, 
and so an explanation was in order. ``They are to be given to people 
for what purpose I don't know,'' Hyde lightly announced. Privately, 
Democrats joked that they might serve as prizes at Republican fund-raising 
dinners. ``If you see me up here banging away, don't worry,'' Hyde 
said. ``I'm just trying to use the ceremonial gavels.'' Bang went 
the gavel, and on came the next one. The avuncular chairman remained 
unflappable through the debates on the articles and the voting on 
Friday. ``We're nearing the end, folks, let's take a deep breath,'' 
Hyde announced rather contentedly at the 12-hour mark on Friday, as 
if driving a school bus through a rainstorm with a spitball fight 
being waged about him. He preferred to laugh when he could, even if 
the joke was on him. ``Now I swing to Frank,'' he said, genially offering 
debating time to Rep. Barney Frank, a Massachusetts Democrat and formidably 
fast-witted debater. `` Mr. Chairman, I appreciate your swinging my 
way,'' Frank responded, and laughter exploded in the room at what 
was taken as Frank's allusion to the well-known fact that he is gay. 
Finally laughing loudest of all, Hyde tried a wordplay of his own 
by invoking the standard command for parliamentary calm _ ``Regular 
order!'' _ with the emphasis on regular. Frank uses humor as an arresting 
rhetorical device and in the impeachment debate he complained repeatedly 
that the committee had not made an independent investigation of the 
evidence in accepting and reshaping the allegations of Kenneth Starr, 
the independent counsel. ``We're just the piano players sending it 
upstairs,'' he said, referring to the Senate's need, should impeachment 
be approved by the full House, to conduct a full-scale trial of the 
president. Minority Democrats lost battle after battle in attacking 
the impeachment articles, but they showed some strong lawyerly fighting. 
Jerrold Nadler, D-N.Y., was particularly tireless. He initiated one 
promising contest that put the Republicans on the defensive, when 
he noted that precise quotations and details of Clinton's alleged 
perjury were not cited in the articles, the way they would be in a 
normal criminal proceeding. ``The whole subject is revealed for the 
farce it is,'' Nadler complained. But Republicans, in one of the many 
instances of the ghost of Richard Nixon being summoned forth, responded 
that the Watergate impeachment articles had been just as nonspecific 
when they were approved. ``This is not an indictment,'' Hyde responded, 
``This is an impeachment.'' Nadler lost the battle but he was not 
done. He moved from outrage to mockery in dealing with another charge 
cited as grounds for impeachment by David Schippers, the Republicans' 
chief investigative counsel: that the president furtively signaled 
Ms. Lewinsky when he gave her a souvenir teddy bear, ``symbolizing 
strength,'' that she must remain silent about their intimacies. ``Is 
he kidding?'' Nadler said. ``For nonsense like this, we're going to 
overturn the votes of the American people? I think the bear was a 
warning by the president that the stock market was going to tank and 
she should put all her money in bonds.'' As laughter swept the hearing 
room, Nadler said, ``That's as logical an inference as any other.''
