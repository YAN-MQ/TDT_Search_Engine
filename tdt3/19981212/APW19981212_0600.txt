Japan, the bronze medalist four years ago in Hiroshima, failed Saturday 
to reach the Asian Games final eight for the first time, crashing 
out in a 72-63 loss Saturday to Taiwan. Japan, which left four world 
championship starters at home due to injuries, suffered two straight 
defeats in Group B, also losing 54-53 to United Arab Emirates. Makoto 
Hasegawa was the match high-scorer with 26 points, but he lacked the 
support that Taiwan's top shooter, Cheng Chi-lung, with 19, got from 
this teammates, who dominated under the baskets. Japan led 40-35 in 
the first half and trailed 63-57 when Taiwan used a 13-3 run to take 
over the lead with only three minutes left. Japan tried and failed 
to come back with a series of missed three-pointers. The defeat marked 
the first time the Japanese men's team has been edged out of the top 
eight at the Asian Games. Taiwan and the United Arab Emirates advance 
to the second round starting Monday. In the other men's match Saturday, 
defending champion China blew apart host nation Thailand, 114-53, 
for a second Group A win. But Thailand still made it to the top eight, 
after beating Hong Kong 77-64 on Thursday. Other second-round qualifiers 
are South Korea and Iran from Group B and the Philippines and Kazakstan 
from Group D. In women's basketball, defending champion South Korea 
beat Kazakstan 70-51 to ensure a semifinal berth. After being tied 
at 42 and 44, the South Koreans broke away with a 15-3 run to take 
their second consecutive group victory. June Sun-min scored a game-high 
22 points and Chun Joo-weon and Yoo Young-joo added 12 and 10 respectively 
for the winners.
