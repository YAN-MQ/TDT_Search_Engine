Rightwing Hindu nationalists opposed to a film on lesbian love showed 
up only in their underwear Saturday at the house of a leading film 
actor who has petitioned the Supreme Court against disruption by the 
protesters. Some 80 Shiv Sena members shouted slogans against actor 
Dilip Kumar at his house in Bombay, India's film capital. Kumar has 
criticized the Shiv Sena for attacking movie theaters in Bombay, New 
Delhi and Calcutta that showed ``Fire,'' the first Indian movie to 
deal specifically with lesbian love. Fire won 14 international awards 
for its portrayal of a relationship between two women living in the 
same house. But members of the Shiv Sena _ considered one of the most 
radical and violent political groups in India _ said lesbianism is 
against what it describes as Indian culture. In recent weeks, Sena 
members have torn down posters and forced movie theaters to stop showing 
the film. Sena activists have often used violence to enforce their 
brand of Hinduism or to silence people critical of their leader, Bal 
Thackeray. ``Dilip Kumar, the leader of the naked! We support you 
in your fight for nudity!'' the protesters chanted in front of his 
house. ``We went in our underwear because that's the language he will 
understand,'' said Sena lawmaker Shrikanth Sarmalkar. The actor was 
not available for comment. Last week, Kumar joined other film personalities 
in petitioning the Supreme Court to ensure that the film can be shown 
without disruption by Sena activists. Following the attacks on the 
movie theaters, the federal government which is controlled by a Sena 
ally, sent back the film to the censors for review.
