The debate in the house Judiciary committee is getting down to the 
wire. Members are wrangling over the fourth and final article of impeachment 
-- abuse of power. Today, republicans moved to drop allegations President 
Clinton deceived the american people, his staff and his cabinet. That 
would reduce the fourth charge to giving false answers to the 81 written 
questions from the committee. Yesterday, the panel approved the other 
three articles of impeachment, accusing Mr. Clinton of two counts 
of perjury and obstruction of justice. After all four articles have 
been debated, the matter will go before the full house. With the stakes 
getting ever higher, the debate today has been heated. If you want 
an archetype of what is wrong with this whole proceeding, you look 
at that article. Now, the gentleman from Pennsylvania to his credit 
has knocked out that article and the others like it in his amendment. 
I'll address maybe the articles themselves when we go on to debate 
those. But he moves, not from the sublime to the ridiculous, from 
the very ridiculous to simply the ridiculous. We should be, even though 
we are in the exercise of the impeachment power, reemphasizing the 
power of the Congress and the legislative branch. We ought to, while 
we're doing that, set down in history as well that we revere the office 
of the presidency, and that we want future presidents not to have 
to reinspect the record of these proceedings to determine whether 
or not they have the right to exert executive privilege.
