Well, it's Sunday morning in Melbourne, Australia. And in a few hours, 
the U.S. president's cup team will hit the course in an attempt to 
dig itself out of a Mammoth hole. The international squad, thanks 
to shots like this one by Craig parry, during a combined win with 
shigeki maruyama, over Tiger Woods and Fred couples, hold a 14 1/2 
to 5 1/2 lead over the Americans. The internationals need just two 
points and 12 singles matches to take home its first president's cup 
in three tries. A few key matches -- Tiger Woods is set for his first-ever 
meeting with greg Norman. While David Duval, 0-3-1 so far, plays Nick 
price.
