Astronauts are preparing to release "endeavour" from the space shuttle 
tomorrow. They finished stocking the outpost with supplies yesterday 
before turning out the lights and closing the hatches. Today astronauts 
Venture outside again for the third and final spacewalk. They'll install 
a large bag of tools on to the station and fix a stuck antenna.
