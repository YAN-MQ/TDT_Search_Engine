NASA's Mars climate Orbiter is En route to the red planet. The craft 
was launched from cape Canaveral in Florida by an unmanned Delta two 
rocket Friday. It should reach Mars in September of next year, where 
it will study the martian atmosphere and look for signs of water. 
It also will serve as a communications relay system for the Mars polar 
lander, which NASA plans to launch next month.
