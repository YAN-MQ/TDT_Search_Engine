Washington says there are signs that Serbian forces are beginning 
to comply with the United Nations demands over Kosovo. The statement 
came after U.S. special envoy Richard Holbrooke expressed concern 
that personnel needed to verify Serbia's military withdrawal from 
Kosovo will take months to arrive. He has also said tough negotiations 
lie ahead to settle the status of Kosovo. United Nations teams have 
begun distributing supplies in Kosovo to refugees who fled their homes 
in fear of the Serbian security forces. The BBC's Paul Wood joined 
one of them. The tiny village of Yestdet, high in the hills of central 
Kosovo is probably one of the most remote spots in Europe. We made 
the last part of our journey on foot, leaving the UNHCR trucks far 
behind at the foot of the hill. Most of the houses were in ruins. 
First the villagers said, "There has been ten days of shelling," then 
they went on. Policemen have come on foot to torch their homes. All 
the villagers were still too scared to descend to the nearest town 
where there are still police officers. The UNHCR official leading 
the convoy fully expected to have to keep them fed throughout the 
winter. Paul Wood.
