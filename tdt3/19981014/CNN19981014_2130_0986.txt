United airlines is taking another step to keep passengers from trying 
to carry oversized bags onto planes. United plans to place plexiglas 
cut-outs in front of X-Ray machines. If the carry-on bag doesn't fit 
through the cut-out, the passenger will have to check it in as luggage. 
The system has been tested at New York's LaGuardia airport. Officials 
say the new rules will improve safety and ensure planes depart on 
time.
