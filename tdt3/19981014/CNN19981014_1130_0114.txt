White House and congressional sources tell CNN they've come up with 
a framework to finalize a budget agreement. There's word of a compromise 
on what had been a major sticking point -- education spending. White 
House officials say republicans are ready to accept spending $1 billion 
to hire 100,000 new public school teachers, but the GOP isn't budging 
on its opposition to a $5 billion school construction initiative. 
Negotiations are continuing again today.
