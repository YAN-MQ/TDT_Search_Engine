France on Wednesday credited military pressure with forcing the agreement 
on the Kosovo crisis and said it must be maintained to ensure Yugoslavia 
complies. ``The pressure paid off,'' Daniel Vaillant, the parliamentary 
affairs minister, said after a weekly Cabinet meeting. But he also 
said the allies must remain ``prudent and vigilant.'' The blunt comment, 
on the eve of another Contact Group meeting on Yugoslavia in Paris, 
indicated France remained firmly behind the NATO-led preparations 
for airstrikes if Yugoslav leader Slobodan Milosevic hedges on the 
deal. ``Thanks to the work of the Contact Group, thanks to the joint 
action of a certain number of countries, including ours,'' he said, 
``it seems Mr. Milosevic made commitments, even if they must be taken 
with prudence.'' The Contact Group, which includes representatives 
from Europe, the United States and Russia, were to meet Thursday in 
Paris. The objective, the French Foreign Ministry said, was ``to evaluate 
the results since the last group meeting,'' including the accord between 
Milosevic and the group's emissary, U.S. envoy Richard Holbrooke. 
Milosevic has agreed to pull forces from independence-minded Kosovo 
province, begin peace talks with separatist ethnic Albanians and allow 
some 2,000 monitors to verify compliance. The group was also to discuss 
how the accord was being carried out, and the ``respective roles'' 
of the United Nations, the Organization for Security and Cooperation 
in Europe, and NATO, the ministry said. Foreign Minister Hubert Vedrine 
was to host a news conference after the meeting.
