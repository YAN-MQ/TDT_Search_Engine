The church of apartheid crept toward reconciliation with its non-white 
sister church on Wednesday, indicating it agreed with the principles 
of social justice and racial equality, but refusing to adopt them 
as doctrine. The painful soul-searching by Dutch Reformed Church leaders 
at their four-year synod underlined how South African institutions 
continue to wrestle with the nation's transition from racism to democracy. 
Heading the agenda was a merger with the Uniting Reformed Church, 
composed mainly of black and mixed-race members. Delegates approved 
measures intended to lead to a merge, and delegate Ernst van der Walt 
of Cape Town called it ``a huge move forward.'' However, the Dutch 
Reformed church members refused to adopt the Confession of Belhar, 
a statement written by non-white church members in 1986 to protest 
apartheid, and named after the mixed-race neighborhood where it was 
sanctioned. The Uniting Reformed Church wanted the white church to 
adopt the doctrine to reaffirm past admissions that it wrongly used 
the Bible to justify the white government's hold on power. James Buys, 
the mixed-race URC moderator who spent 43 days in solitary confinement 
under apartheid, said the white church's failure to clear the Belhar 
hurdle represented ``a new type of apartheid, one of language and 
culture.'' Buys' colleague, URC church magazine editor Pieter Fourie 
of Cape Town, was more upbeat. ``We're quite happy at this point,'' 
Fourie told the Associated Press. Most Afrikaners, the descendants 
of Dutch settlers who speak Afrikaans and hold much of the country's 
wealth, regard the Dutch Reformed Church as a linguistic and cultural 
anchor against majority black rule that took power in 1994. Many live 
in rural areas, where they have been increasingly targeted for violent 
and sometimes murderous attacks. ``Our people live in a new society 
and now they hear people saying, `We want to change your church,' 
'' said Freek Swanepoel, past Dutch Reformed moderator, or top leader. 
``(Acceptance) must grow from your heart, not your head.'' During 
the four-hour debate, several delegates rejected the Belhar doctrine 
because of a phrase that says God is on the side of the underprivileged. 
``God is not only the god of the poor,'' said Piet Strauss of Free 
State province. However, delegate Schalk van Wyk _ expressing a tone 
of reconciliation _ urged the gathering to accept the Confession of 
Belhar to provide hope for the poor in South Africa, where 40 percent 
are unemployed. ``It makes it possible to take up the cross and follow 
Jesus and listen to the pain of a lot of people,'' he said. Delegates 
said the conciliatory tone of the debate made possible compromises 
that were unthinkable four and eight years ago. President Nelson Mandela 
attended the 1994 synod, where delegates sang a special hymn for the 
black leader and white church theologians who argued against apartheid. 
One of the theologians was assassinated in 1994. ``We thought then 
that we had done with apartheid,'' said Piet Meiring in an interview. 
``We realize now that it's easy to get apartheid out of our statements, 
but not so easy to get it out of our hearts.'' On Tuesday, nearly 
all 400 delegates approved a resolution denouncing apartheid as ``sinful'' 
and a theological ``travesty.'' By adopting the resolution, the church 
reactivated its membership in the 75-million strong World Alliance 
of Reformed Churches, which comprises reformed and Presbyterian churches. 
The world body had suspended the Dutch Reformed Church in 1982 because 
it violated teachings of the Bible. Starting that same year, the 1.5-million-member 
white church gradually renounced its hard-line position but kept separate 
branches for blacks, mixed-race and Indian congregants. The black 
and mixed-race branches merged in 1994 to become the 1.5-million-member 
Uniting Reformed Church.
