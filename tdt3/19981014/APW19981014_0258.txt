Britain's foreign secretary warned Wednesday that NATO remains prepared 
for airstrikes against Yugoslavia if Slobodan Milosevic fails to abide 
by the agreement to halt the crackdown in Kosovo province. In a step 
toward compliance, the Serb government outlined a plan for a separate 
parliament in autonomy-minded Kosovo. But officials also shut down 
two newspapers critical of Milosevic, reinforcing suspicions the Yugoslav 
president is using the crisis to strengthen his grip on power. Following 
marathon talks with U.S. envoy Richard Holbrooke, Milosevic agreed 
Monday to withdraw forces from Kosovo, begin peace negotiations with 
separatist ethnic Albanians and allow some 2,000 international inspectors 
into the troubled Serb province to verify compliance. Full compliance 
should end Milosevic's seven-month crackdown against Kosovo Albanian 
militants, an operation that has killed hundreds and left up to 300,000 
refugees homeless. To make sure Milosevic abides by the agreement, 
NATO gave Milosevic until 0500 GMT Saturday to comply for face airstrikes. 
On Wednesday, British Foreign Secretary Robin Cook said Milosevic 
should take the warning seriously. ``We don't trust President Milosevic, 
let's be clear about that,'' Cook told a British Broadcasting Corp. 
radio interview. ``The united consensus within NATO that we were ready 
to take military action was there at the beginning of the week, is 
still there and that decision is still on the table. We can reactivate 
these plans any time we feel it is necessary to do so.'' Echoing the 
British official, Austrian Foreign Minister Wolfgang Schuessel said 
the world ``must remain watchful'' because of the Yugoslav leader's 
record of breaking his promises. The Kosovo plan, announced late Tuesday, 
calls for local elections in the separatist province for 1999. According 
to the statement, Kosovo Albanians would have their own parliament, 
judiciary and police. The government also said elections in Kosovo 
would be held within nine months and invited foreign monitors to observe 
them. It also offered amnesty for ethnic Albanian fighters except 
suspected war criminals. Ethnic Albanians form 90 percent of the 2 
million people in Kosovo and have insisted on independence rather 
than regaining the autonomy Milosevic stripped in 1989. But international 
leaders oppose independence for Kosovo fearing that could lead to 
further instability in the tense Balkans. Despite the agreement with 
Holbrooke, it was clear that the Yugoslav president has no intention 
of loosening his grip on power. Late Tuesday, Serb police stormed 
the offices of independent newspapers Dnevni Telegraf and Danas and 
closed them down for allegedly violating a recent government decree 
that required self-censorship at a time of NATO threats. The decrees, 
issued last week, banned reports on NATO threats, military preparations 
or any other developments which could allegedly alarm the populace. 
Dnevni Telegraf had been publishing such reports regularly under headlines 
such as ``We have not reported this'' or ``respecting the decree, 
we are not saying that:''On Saturday, a popular radio station, Index, 
was shut down. ``Serbia is heading to a complete dictatorship and 
this must be stopped,'' said Dnevni Telegraf's managing editor, Slavko 
Curuvija. ``Until now we could at least write about it. Now we can't 
even do that.'' Holbrooke said the key to the accord was Milosevic's 
decision to allow a 2,000-member ``verification mission'' and to permit 
aerial verification by non-combat aircraft that could begin as soon 
as the end of the week. ``They are not monitors, not observers,'' 
Holbrooke said. ``They are compliance verifiers.'' But officials admitted 
Tuesday it could take weeks before the full complement of 2,000 international 
observers are on the ground. They hope to get about 50 diplomatic 
observers, who were evacuated to Macedonia last weekend, back into 
Kosovo soon to serve as an advance party for the monitors. International 
leaders stepped up efforts to resolve the crisis in Kosovo because 
of fears that thousands of homeless refugees would die if they could 
not return to their homes by the time winter sets in. However, many 
of those homes have been burned by Serb forces. U.N. officials believe 
the presence of international monitors is critical to overcoming fears 
of the refugees against returning home. Many of them are afraid they 
will be arrested by police when they emerge from the forests. In Geneva, 
Switzerland, the U.N. refugee agency said Wednesday the situation 
of the refugees was ``basically unchanged.'' Many of them are afraid 
to return to their homes because of fear of Serb reprisals, spokesman 
Kris Janowski said. ``We've always said that fear is the main problem,'' 
Janowski said. ``And that needs to be allayed'' by the arrival of 
international monitors.
