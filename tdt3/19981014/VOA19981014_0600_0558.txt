The Kremlin says Russian President Yeltsin is back at work today after 
spending yesterday in his country home recuperating from bronchitis. 
A spokesperson for the President says Mr. Yeltsin unexpectedly showed 
up at his office to work and to attend several meetings. The Kremlin 
on Tuesday said the Russian leader would probably stay home the rest 
of the week. The illness forced Mr. Yeltsin to cut short an official 
visit to Central Asia Monday, returning a day ahead of schedule. Doctors 
say Mr. Yeltsin who has a history of health problems is being treated 
with antibiotics.
