No one can accuse the new crop of Irish playwrights of shying away 
from the big issues. Take, for example, ``Moonshine,'' a new play 
by Jim Nolan at the Irish Arts Center that is at heart a romantic 
comedy about death, burial and the Resurrection, taking place on Easter 
weekend in a small Irish village. Nolan offers a little something 
for everybody. There is a love triangle, a lapse of religious faith, 
a midlife crisis, a death in the family, just about everything except 
politics, which is unusual for contemporary Irish plays. But in over 
two and a half hours what it has mostly is a lot of gab, and little 
of it to any particular point. At the center is McKeever, a mortician 
who is also the director of the local amateur theater group. As undertaker, 
McKeever has a propensity to put his foot in his mouth and has trouble 
getting the right body in the right grave. As stage director, his 
cast for a forthcoming production of ``A Midsummer Night's Dream'' 
stands at four actors to play the 22 roles and is dwindling fast. 
As ``Moonshine'' opens McKeever is paying a professional call on the 
Reverend Langton, the local Protestant minister, whose wife is dying. 
Langton's church is about to be closed because the congregation has 
fled to other parishes, and he finds his religious convictions have 
deserted him as well. Langton's daughter, estranged from her parents 
since she left the village five years earlier after an affair with 
McKeever, arrives from London for the funeral. McKeever, who has an 
unflagging belief in the redemptive power of the theater, sets about 
to restore Langton's faith, regain the daughter's love, get the curtain 
up on his new production and bury Mrs. Langton in the village churchyard. 
While some individual scenes show promise, possible conflicts end 
abruptly, often with a platitude, and the characters are underdeveloped. 
The funniest parts are the rehearsals of the mechanicals for ``A Midsummer 
Night's Dream,'' but credit for that belongs to Shakespeare. The staging 
at the Irish Arts Center even has the feel of a parish-hall production, 
and the stolid direction of Don Creedon does little to flesh out the 
play. The cast is pretty much left to its own devices, and there is 
not much sense of cohesion among them. Johnnie McConnell is a charmer 
as McKeever and Elizabeth Whyte is credible as the prodigal daughter. 
A. Ryan McGuigan has a nice turn as the undertaker's simple-minded 
assistant playing Bottom. PRODUCTION NOTES MOONSHINE By Jim Nolan;
