With a look at your "Headline News weather," I'm Karen McGinnis. In 
the pacific northwest and British Columbia, here comes a frontal system. 
It looks like the snow levels will be down to around 6,000 feet or 
so. And we will begin to see the snow develop across the northern 
Rockies going into Thursday. There will also be some anticipated wet 
weather into New England where over the previous weekend as much as 
a foot of rainfall occurred there. A significant rain event will probably 
not be matched with this latest system. 40s and 50s will be experienced 
on Wednesday from Hudson bay to the Great Lakes and throughout much 
of the Ohio valley. The great basin will see mostly 50s and 60s. Look 
for breezy conditions across the Hawaiian islands and snow expected 
in Nome, Alaska. Our extended forecast is calling for snowfall into 
the northern Rockies and windy conditions through the plains. Temperatures 
start to rebound through the central U.S., but begin to back off going 
into Friday, chillier weather found across the Rockies, 40s and 50s. 
And then going into Saturday, mostly 50s into the interior west. For 
more weather information log onto CNN.com.
