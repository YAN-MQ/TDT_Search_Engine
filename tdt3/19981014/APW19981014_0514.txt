A German airman was buried Wednesday, 56 years after his bomber crashed 
during a World War II raid on Britain. About 200 people, including 
representatives of 20 veterans' groups, paid their respects at the 
morning service for Heinrich Richter at Thornaby cemetery near Middlesbrough, 
225 miles (360 km) north of London. Richter's Luftwaffe Dornier plunged 
to the ground and blew up in January 1942 during an attack on an ironworks 
near Middlesbrough. The bodies of tree of the four men in the plane 
were recovered immediately and buried at Thornaby. Then, last year, 
a number of human bones eventually identified as Richter's were found 
alongside aircraft wreckage by workers laying drains. Richter, 30, 
had been mistakenly identified as one of the three men buried in the 
cemetery, and his name was inscribed on the original headstone. The 
headstones now will be altered to include the name of Hans Maneke, 
originally thought to be the missing man. The others were Joachim 
Lennis and Rudolph Matern. Pastor Walther Bindemann, the region's 
German clergyman, conducted Wednesday's service in both English and 
German. ``This is an occasion for reconciliation for our nations,'' 
he said. ``There are still wounds to be healed, and people need to 
be able to come together. ... If Richter was standing here today, 
he would probably apologize for what he and his comrades did to the 
British people, but they were only a small part of a larger cog.'' 
Among those paying their respects was British D-Day veteran John Armstrong, 
83, who saw action as a paratrooper with the 6th Airborne Division. 
``He was only doing a job, the same as we were,'' Armstrong said. 
``Why should he not be afforded the same service as anyone else?''
