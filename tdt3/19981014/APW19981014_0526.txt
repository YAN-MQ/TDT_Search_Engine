It was a moment like so many in Ariel Sharon's storied military career: 
He marched straight in and took charge. Sharon _ aging ex-general, 
master political survivor, revered by some as a war hero and reviled 
by others as a war criminal _ formally assumed control of Israel's 
Foreign Ministry on Wednesday, a day before his departure for a crucial 
Mideast summit outside Washington. For the 70-year-old Sharon, it's 
a summit in more ways than one. When Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu 
last week named him as foreign minister, it capped a long painful 
climb back from a decade and a half of disgrace and political exile. 
Meeting with top ministry officials _ and, briefly, with reporters 
_ the burly, white-haired Sharon turned on a typical mix of diplomatic 
formulations, unyielding doctrine and blunt-force charm. Asked about 
past encroachments on the powers of his new ministry, he made a characteristic 
declaration. ``I'm not the kind of man people give things to,'' he 
said in his trademark trumpeting voice. ``I take them.'' Probably 
no other Israeli public figure arouses such conflicting passions. 
To his partisans, Sharon is the daring, brilliant tactician whose 
battlefield victories helped turn the tide of three of Israel's wars, 
the only politician with the force and stature to lead the rightist 
camp. To detractors, he is a destroyer. The Israeli left despises 
him. Palestinian senior negotiator Saeb Erekat flatly describes him 
as a war criminal. Many Palestinians hold him responsible for Lebanese 
Christian militiamen's 1982 massacre of hundreds of Palestinian refugees, 
and angrily recall his aggressive promotion of Jewish settlement growth 
during a stint as housing minister. Sharon returns the ill feeling: 
he has said publicly he won't shake Yasser Arafat's hand, even in 
his post as Israel's principal negotiator of peace with the Palestinians. 
Many of Sharon's allies on the right reacted with dismay to his appointment 
as foreign minister, considering him an opportunist who betrayed principles 
to fulfill his own political ambitions. His acceptance of the job, 
they believe, amounts to endorsement of a land deal with the Palestinians, 
something they bitterly oppose. Yitzhak Shamir, the hard-line former 
prime minister, accuses Sharon of contradicting himself. ``He doesn't 
promise anything which can truly change the situation for the better,'' 
he told Israel radio. Even Sharon's own boss doesn't much care for 
him. In the past, Sharon never shied away from disparaging Netanyahu 
in public, and the prime minister repaid him by relegating him to 
the second-string post of infrastructure minister _ a big come-down 
for a politician who had once hoped to be prime minister himself one 
day. Some observers believe Sharon's desire to rise above past disgrace 
_ he had not held a leadership post for 15 years, since being held 
indirectly responsible for the massacres at the Sabra and Shatilla 
camps south of Beirut _ could be the key to his stance at the summit 
and in months to come. The word being used over and over again by 
commentators is pragmatism. Sharon is viewed by friend and foe alike 
as hard-headed and hard-nosed, unlikely to sign onto an accord unless 
he really thought it would work on the ground. And his background 
gives him greater credibility than anyone else on questions of Israel's 
security, something on which any accord will hinge. A government official 
long acquainted with Sharon, speaking on condition of anonymity, likened 
his potential role to that of the late Moshe Dayan in the Camp David 
process _ ``the practical general who understands this is the last 
chapter of his life, that there are limits to power and the use of 
force in solving disputes.'' His desire to become a statesman, the 
official suggested, could strongly propel him toward unexpected compromise. 
``Sharon is a man of surprises, and not only on the battlefield,'' 
commentator Avraham Tirosh wrote in the Maariv newspaper. ``No one 
is able to assess what Sharon will really do.''
