Defending champion Germany conceded an early goal Wednesday but stormed 
back to beat Moldova 3-1 and gain its first victory in the qualifying 
for the 2000 European Championship. Ulf Kirsten scored two goals in 
the first half to help the unimpressive Germans over the outsiders. 
Beaten 1-0 by Turkey on Saturday, Germany needed a victory to stay 
alive in Group 3. But Moldova stunned the Germans with a goal in the 
sixth minute. Sergiu Clesenco outpaced the German defense and fired 
a good shot from 15 meters (yards). Goalkeeper Oliver Kahn made a 
reflex save and the ball bounced off the bar. From the ensuing corner, 
Alexandru Guzun was left unmarked to tap in the first goal. While 
Germany dominated the action, Moldova's fast forwards often troubled 
the German defense with fast counter-attacks. But in the 20th, the 
Germans equalized when Kirsten was left unchallenged to head in from 
close range. Germany used its superiority in the air to score two 
more goals within two minutes. Oliver Bierhoff headed to Kirsten in 
the 38th and the Bayer Leverkusen striker volleyed home from close 
range. Two minutes later, Bierhoff drove in a headed pass from Lars 
Ricken. Five minutes into the second halftime, Kahn made a spectacular 
save to deny Clesenco from close range, and Germany came under a lot 
of pressure from a well-combining Moldova team. Kahn made two more 
great saves to atone himself for the mistake that led to Turkey's 
goal four days ago. Six minutes from time, Moldova's Igor Obrea was 
sent off with his second yellow card of the match. A crowd of 5,000 
saw the match. --- Lineups Moldova: Vasile Coselev; Ion Testimitanu,
