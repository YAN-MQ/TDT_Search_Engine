Nigerian Nobel Laureate Volv Selinka has returned to Nigeria for the 
first time since fleeing into exile in 1994. He arrived in Lagos, 
Nigeria's commercial capital Wednesday even local time. VOA's John 
Pittman has details from our West Africa bureau. Walesh Tienka returned 
to a hero's welcome Wednesday night. Reports from the airport in Lagos 
say the 64-year old writer was met by hundreds of well wishers. Emerging 
from the airport, he briefly thanked the crowd. Then, was driven into 
the city where he reportedly planned to visit the home of the late 
opposition leader Mashu Avuala. A spokeswoman for Emery University 
in Atlanta, Georgia, where Mr. Trienka has been teaching while in 
exile, says the author will remain in Nigeria for about a week. During 
this visit, he is expected to deliver a public lecture titled "Rebuilding 
A Nation". Walesh Trienka won the Nobel Prize for Literature in 1986.
