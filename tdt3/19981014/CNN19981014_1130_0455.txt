This is meteorologist Valerie Voss with your "Headline News" forecast 
today into Thursday. Much cooler weather is pushing into the western 
part of the country. Not only will it produce rain showers, but we'll 
see snow in the mountains from Oregon and Washington through Idaho 
and into Montana. High temperatures today in the 40s and 50s, New 
England to the Great Lakes. In the south, look for 70s and 80s, and 
perhaps still some 90s in the southwest. Looking ahead to Friday, 
it'll be a rainy day across the north-central part of the country, 
with cool air over the northern Rockies. For Saturday, we'll see scattered 
showers and storms through the plains. The cool air pushes into the 
region. Then on Sunday, the rain is pushing across the Mississippi 
river valley, highs across the northern plains will be just in the 
40s.
