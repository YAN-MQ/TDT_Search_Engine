A Georgia woman who claims she's received hundreds of messages from 
the virgin Mary and Jesus held her final public audience Tuesday. 
Nancy fowler addressed as many as 100,000 people at her suburban Atlanta 
farm. Her messages typically urge the faithful to love each other 
and to seek peace. Many Catholic leaders have distanced themselves 
from fowler and county authorities have threatened to declare the 
crowds a public nuisance.
