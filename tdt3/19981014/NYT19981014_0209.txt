``Do your homework first!'' Prof. Ellen Freedman of Camden County 
College in New Jersey implores students from a rolling banner across 
her virtual classroom, which was designed to provide ``information 
about basic math and algebra.'' But following the professor's admonition 
might require great will power: while often informative, her site 
(www.mathpower.com) also serves up hours of indulgent distractions, 
with a menu of electronic games, not all related to math. Under the 
heading of ``fun stuff,'' which is accessible with a browser that 
supports Java, there's a three-dimensional Rubik's cube, a chance 
to challenge the computer at checkers and even a version of the kids' 
game hangman. And showing that she really has a sense of humor, Professor 
Freedman provides her students the chance to take out their anxiety 
on her. In a ``morph the professor,'' area, anyone can enjoy stretching 
a photograph of her face, grafted onto a cartoon body, into various 
superhuman shapes. Thankfully, Professor Freedman's serious side has 
compiled an exhaustive list of more than three dozen links to math-related 
sites that offer invaluable help to students of all ages and abilities. 
Those sites, including at least three electronic tutoring services 
that promise free help, are reached by clicking first on ``classroom 
and math info,'' and then scrolling down to ``Freedman's suggested 
math-related links.'' One site, Algebra Online (www.algebra-online.com) 
offers an e-mail form on which students can seek help with a vexing 
math question, as long as they can ``be specific'' and don't tax the 
the tutors with questions like ``teach me how to factor.'' A similar 
site, the Math Tutor (www.fliegler.com/mathman.htm), boasts ``years 
of experience'' and will try to answer any question on any level, 
``from arithmetic to calculus,'' in 24 hours. Best of all may be ``Ask 
Dr. Math'' (www.forum.swarthmore.edu/dr.math/dr-math.html), in which 
the ``doctors'' are college math students and the ``patients'' can 
be anyone in kindergarten through grade 12. In addition to questions 
answered via e-mail, there is also an archive of past responses searchable 
by topic. Back on the professor's home page, the viewer should beware: 
some icons, like ``The Math Teacher's Ten Commandments,'' promise 
more than they deliver. Be careful, also, in the games section, to 
avoid ``Paint with Color'' and ``Basketball,'' which seem to have 
script errors and easily freeze. Still, this is a site that offers 
any number of resources to even the casual math student. And besides, 
who can resist the chance to indulge in ``Mad Libs,'' in which the 
computer blindly asks the viewer for the first words that come to 
mind and then combines them into a story. When a recent visitor to 
the site played, as a way to avoid writing an article's final sentence, 
the computer spat back the following passage: ``She immediately jumped 
on the armoire and knocked over the editor.''
