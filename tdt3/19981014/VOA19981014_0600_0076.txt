The Yugoslav government of President Slobodan Milosevic has announced 
it will hold local elections in Kosovo next year as part of an agreement 
to avoid NATO military action. A statement issued late Tuesday and 
outlines a plan to set up a separate parliament for the 90 percent 
ethnic Albania majority in the Serbian province. It says elections 
will be held within 9 months and foreign observers will be invited. 
The statement also promises that a local police force reflecting the 
ethnic make-up of the population will be set up under the control 
of an autonomist government. Yugoslav President Slobodan Milosevic 
had reached a deal with U.S. Special Envoy, Richard Holbrooke on Tuesday 
as VOA's Arch Chimes reports. The Holbrooke announcement came after 
a final meeting with Yugoslav's President Slobodan Milosevic. Earlier, 
NATO agreed to authorized military action unless Yugoslovia agreed 
to comply with United Nations demands on Serbia's rebellious Kosovo 
province. Mr. Milosevic agreed to international verification of the 
demands which include withdrawal of forces from Kosovo and access 
by umanagerial organization to tens of thousands of displace persons 
who are living out in the open. The deal includes various measures 
to ensure Yugoslavia complies including over five-star reconnaissance 
aircraft and unarmed monitors on the ground. The agreement appears 
to provide a short-term resolution to the Kosovo crisis but ethnic 
Albanians have reservations about the agreement which would defer 
their dream of full independence. Arch Chimes, VOA News, Belgrade.
