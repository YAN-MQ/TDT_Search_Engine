"Ally McBeal" is finding herself on the wrong side of a lawsuit. A 
New York law firm is suing Calista Flockhart, who plays the title 
role in the sitcom "Ally McBeal," for breach of contract. The lawsuit 
says Flockhart owes the firm at least $39,000 for arranging her contract 
for the show. Flockhart's attorney says he wasn't aware of the lawsuit.
