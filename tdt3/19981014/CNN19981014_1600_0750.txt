Genesis park! That's the worst neighborhood in the city of Charlotte. 
It was really bad. There were no birds. There were no children. There 
were no Flowers. They told us that grass would never grow in that 
yard. And then as we did ours... other homeowners started working 
in their yards. Genesis park is a beginning. You see little, young 
children in the street playing. How did I know genesis park was getting 
better? The birds came back. The Fannie Mae foundation. If you could 
accompany your data on its trip overseas the experience would be alarming. 
Local carriers handing it to national carriers over to cable carriers... 
till you don't know who has your data. Unless you send it through 
here. With the one and only company that owns the entire network-- 
local, national, and international. So you know who has your data. 
On-net. From MCI Worldcom.
