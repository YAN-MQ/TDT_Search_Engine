The proper young British widow has a rocket in her purse. The handsome, 
aging patent clerk is in pain because he showed up for military duty 
in his dancing shoes. The French ambassador's wife is lonely and convinced 
that she's dying. The secretary of patents is worried about his gadgets. 
The big, burly sailor just wants to stay alive. And they all end up 
together in the U.S. Patent Office one day in 1814 when British soldiers 
decide to burn America's capital. It's clear from the opening lines 
that ``The Night They Burned Washington'' is smartly written (``One 
doesn't burn a city unless one is properly provoked''), and early 
scenes establish that it's skillfully performed. What makes Mark R. 
Giesser's play, which opened last Tuesday at the Theater Row Theater, 
less than a total success is a kind of genre overload; its sureness 
with language is weakened by the work's constant shifting of tone. 
Is this a serious commentary on war? Amanda Crofton (Linda Ewing) 
is seeking a patent for a new rocket she has designed, one more efficient 
than those the British are using now, but, she explains, ``it's a 
weapon of peace.'' Its destruction will be so great, she explains, 
that war will become unthinkable. ``Can't you see,'' she implores, 
``that my rocket will end the killing?'' Is this a love story? Certainly 
Amanda and the clerk, Cassius Lightner (Peter Reznikoff), are attracted 
to each other from the beginning, and Amanda has had a premonition 
about meeting ``my next husband'' that day. The two do behave in very 
un-Regency ways, however. For one thing, Amanda gives Cassius a foot 
massage _ and they've barely met. But a little anachronism can be 
a good thing, as long as everybody involved is aware of it, and maybe 
``moonlight'' really was used as a verb during the War of 1812. The 
dialogue is often funny but the audience isn't sure whether to laugh. 
Is it farce when the two women challenge each other to a duel? Or 
is it an observation about changing gender roles? At one point, Dr. 
Thornton (Avrom Berel) defends the decision of the British to burn 
the White House: ``Considering the Madisonian sense of decor, who 
could blame them?'' Nice line, but did Noel Coward come in to do the 
rewrite? There are physical stretches of credibility, too. Madeline 
Serurier (Marianne Tatum), the ambassador's wife, is found lying in 
the street, ill or injured, with not a tendril of her Empire hair 
style mussed. She's soon feeling better and beginning to appreciate 
the charms of the sailor Charlie Dunn (John Wayne Shafer). ``The Night 
They Burned Washington,'' like the makeshift rocket, seems to have 
all the right ingredients; they just don't mix in exactly the right 
way. With a little reformulation, though, it might catch fire.
