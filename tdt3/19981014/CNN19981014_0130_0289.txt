Millions of Omega brand fire sprinklers are being recalled. The consumer 
product safety commission demanded the recall in March in a lawsuit 
against central sprinkler company. Central fought the recall order 
for seven months but now has agreed to it. The commission says Omega 
sprinkler heads have failed to activate in at least nine fires, in 
the past three years. Omega sprinklers are installed in the White 
House the capitol and 80 other federal locations.
