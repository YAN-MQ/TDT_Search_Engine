And to our other lead story that started last night on this broadcast 
when we reported the early edition of the "Washington Post," what 
did Henry Hyde say to "The Washington Post"? What did he mean? Have 
any decisions been reached about just two courses of action against 
the president? Does Ken Starr have any more evidence? What do we know? 
Henry Hyde is trying to keep all of his options open. He told "The 
Washington Post" he would consider consolidating a lot of the 15 charges. 
The problem is a lot of conservatives on his committee were very unhappy 
about the idea he may be dropping charges and are he said that is 
not what he meant to say. We asked him about it. We're consolidating, 
trying to compact things so that they're -- so that they fit within 
a time frame that we have. So are you narrowing the inquiry? Narrowing 
say better word, yeah, narrowing it to the things we can approval 
within the time we're allotted. And the time frame of course is by 
the end of the year. Gwen Ifill on the hill where the headline is 
not only not they working, but apparently working late. Thanks.
