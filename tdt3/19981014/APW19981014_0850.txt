Prime Minister Yevgeny Primakov suggested Wednesday that Russia helped 
bring about the apparent breakthrough in the Kosovo crisis by threatening 
to break relations with NATO. ``Look how they respect Russia in the 
world,'' Primakov told the Federation Council, the upper house of 
parliament. ``We openly told the West that if bombs were dropped on 
Kosovo, we would sharply change our attitude to NATO and reconsider 
our orientation,'' he said. ``This is the main argument that is now 
working.'' U.S. envoy Richard Holbrooke brokered an agreement with 
Yugoslav President Slobodan Milosevic on Monday that at least temporarily 
averts NATO airstrikes to end the crackdown on ethnic Albanians in 
Kosovo. Primakov, who discussed the situation during a meeting Wednesday 
with President Boris Yeltsin, said the Russian leader ``approved of 
the turn of events'' in Kosovo and ordered his officials to continue 
working ``in the same direction,'' the ITAR-Tass news agency reported. 
Milosevic agreed to withdraw his forces from Kosovo, begin peace negotiations 
and allow international observers into the troubled province. ``Today 
the situation around Kosovo is easing,'' Primakov said. ``We must 
knock on wood, but it appears there will be no airstrikes.'' The six-country 
Contact Group is scheduled to meet Thursday to discuss further steps 
to bring peace in Kosovo. Russian Foreign Minister Igor Ivanov was 
to travel to Paris on Wednesday evening to attend the meeting, said 
ministry spokesman Vladimir Rakhmanin, according to ITAR-Tass. Ivanov 
sounded triumphant Wednesday. ``One can say with a great degree of 
confidence that we have averted a threat of a military operation in 
Yugoslavia,'' ITAR-Tass quoted him as saying. Ivanov, who also met 
with Yeltsin on Wednesday, said the president has instructed his officials 
to take ``the most active part'' in the activities of the Kosovo mission 
of the Organization for Security and Cooperation in Europe. A Russian 
parliamentary delegation, meanwhile, left for Kosovo to get a first-hand 
look at what is happening in the southern Serb province and examine 
sites that could be targeted by NATO airstrikes. Neighboring Belarus 
also sent a government delegation to Belgrade on Wednesday to discuss 
military aid to Yugoslavia. Russia's parliament speaker has called 
on its Slavic neighbors to help Yugoslavia, and Belarusian President 
Alexander Lukashenko has promised military support _ though no soldiers. 
The upper house of Russia's parliament, the Federation Council, unanimously 
adopted a resolution ``calling on all parliaments of the world, and 
the world community _ especially NATO members _ not to allow military 
intervention in Yugoslavia's internal conflict.'' The lower house 
of parliament, the State Duma, unanimously approved a resolution Wednesday 
denouncing the ``NATO threat to unleash a war against the Union Republic 
of Yugoslavia.'' The Duma said it would view airstrikes against Serbia 
as ``an act of aggression that would bear exceptionally severe consequences 
for the world and for security in Europe.'' The resolution also urged 
Yeltsin to consider military cooperation with Yugoslavia and ``correct'' 
Russia's position toward NATO. Duma speaker Gennady Seleznyov told 
a British parliamentary delegation Wednesday that if NATO goes ahead 
with its plans for military action, Russia may revoke its agreement 
on friendship and cooperation with the alliance. Russia opposes NATO 
airstrikes against Serbia, which makes up most of present-day Yugoslavia. 
Russians and Serbs are allies, both being Slavic peoples that practice 
the Orthodox Christian religion.
