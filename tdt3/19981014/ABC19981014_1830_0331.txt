In eye whack, community leaders and scientists held a town meeting 
about a single drug. It is called methamphetamine, meth, there's enormous 
concern because meth is incredibly addictive, so problem and so severe 
that in Des Moines more people were arrested for meth than drunk driving. 
Deborah Amos has been investigating the meth business. How the drug 
lords found fertile ground for their product in America. Methamphetamine 
addiction is now an epidemic across the midwest. Users are mostly 
white and middle class. In Iowa, meth is surprisingly easy to get. 
Every one was doing it, so I figured, hey, it's all right. Everybody's 
doing it. Not even 20 minutes later, I was out looking for more. Also 
surprising, this meth is cheaper than cocaine, with a longer rush. 
So pure, users smoke it -- the most addictive delivery system. Methamphetamine 
has come in like a hurricane and has just literally addicted hundreds 
and hundreds, even thousands of people that were never really addicted 
before. The biggest surprise, most the meth doesn't come from local 
labs, it's smuggled on this interstate highway from Mexico to California 
to the midwest. Almost 90% delivered by Mexican drug cartels. One 
stop on the drug trail is marshalltown, Iowa. We have a large Hispanic 
population of good, hard-working citizens in our packing plants. Other 
individuals who deal in this type of thing, meth, come in and blend 
right in. That's the way they work everywhere, moving meth across 
the country. And who's moving it? In Des Moines, drug trafficker fransico 
amezcua and his American courier, Bobby stockdale, operated out of 
this mobile home. The DEA monitored the operation. When the two men 
were arrested last year, stockdale told agents about his meetings 
with Mexican drug bosses. Several different groups of traffickers 
are sitting around a table dividing up sections of Des Moines, saying, 
"okay, this is my area, this is your area, this is mine." It was a 
wake-up call for a lot of people, frankly. And a wake-up call for 
other rural and suburban communities also targeted by Mexican meth 
cartels from across the border. Deborah Amos, ABC News, Des Moines.
