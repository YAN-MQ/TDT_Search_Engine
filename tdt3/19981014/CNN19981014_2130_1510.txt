Blues singer keb Mo is in high demand these days. His music can be 
heard on the radio, television, and at the movies. Mark Scheerer has 
more. Let bygones be bygones and trouble being long gone Keb Mo says 
he liked the name "slow down" for his third CD so he'd have a constant 
reminder to himself. It's kind of like a signal to myself to kind 
of like slow down and go for a little more quality, than quantity 
when doing this stuff. Still, it seems keb Mo is managing to do both. 
Just hand it over hand it over hand it over Since his 1994 debut, 
keb Mo's music has been everywhere. On television, it was seen in 
the series "touched by an Angel," and is on the newly released soundtrack. 
Later this month, keb Mo acts and performs in CBS' "the promised land," 
which will feature more of his music this season. I love my baby gonna 
tell everybody I know call your girlfriend? His film work includes 
the soundtracks to "one fine day," Kevin Costner's "tin cup," and 
the upcoming "down in the Delta." All that in addition to touring 
-- as a headliner and with everyone from Bonnie raitt to Celine Dion. 
Along the way, keb Mo, born Kevin Moore, picked up a host of awards, 
including a Grammy for his last release. With all this demand for 
the man and his music, "slow down" also serves as a reminder for keb 
Mo to keep his head in check. You know, I'd like to stay centered 
and stay with who I am. I love to play and I love to write. And I 
love to do what I do. And I don't want anything, including my ego, 
to get in the way with me doing that. All that money Holmes ain't 
gonna buy babe Yet for all his popularity and acclaim, keb Mo does 
not see himself as a bluesman. No, a blues -- that's a heavy honor 
to really be a bluesman. I love the blues. I do the blues. But I don't 
-- I'm probably not consistent enough doing just blues, blues, blues, 
to be a blues artist. Although the singer/songwriter is grateful for 
the lesson, his blues heroes taught him about the message of the music. 
If your talking about what's going on in your life chances are there's 
a couple more people out there that are having the same experience. 
And then you don't feel like such an island any more. The blues kind 
of brings everyone together. And these days keb Mo is the bridge that 
takes them there. And God knows I feel just like you Mark Scheerer,
