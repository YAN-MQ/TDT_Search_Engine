A federal judge has cleared the way for U.S. marshals to shut down 
a medical marijuana club in Oakland, California. The judge yesterday 
rejected the club's arguments that medical marijuana is essential 
to relieve patients' pain or save their lives. California voters legalized 
the clubs under state law in 1996. Unless an appeal is successful, 
federal authorities will force the 2,000-member Oakland cannabis buyers' 
cooperative to close Friday.
