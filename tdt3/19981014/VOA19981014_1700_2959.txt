It's time now for business news and here is Brook Ulnery with the 
day's doings on New York's Wall Street. The Dow Jones Industrial Average 
closed at 7968 up 30 points. The Standard & Poor's 500 Index closed 
at 1005 up 10 points. Analyst say that traders were still nervous 
about the international financial situation and the possibility of 
an economic slowdown in the United States. But, there was also some 
optimism as a result of some unexpectedly strong corporate earnings 
reports. Well, the government reported retail sales in the United 
States rose only modestly in September, suggesting American consumers 
have become more cautious in their buying decisions. Brook Ulnery, 
VOA News, New York.
