Philippine central bank officials decided Wednesday to place the financially 
troubled Orient Commercial Banking Corp. in receivership. Orient Bank, 
one of the smallest of the country's commercial banks, shut down in 
February due to heavy withdrawals triggered by fears that its majority 
owner was in difficulty. The Monetary Board, the central bank's policy-making 
body, said the government would determine in three months whether 
the bank could be rehabilitated. The central bank said Orient Bank 
had 4.9 billion pesos (dlrs 114 million) in bad loans, mostly granted 
to members of the bank's board of directors in violation of banking 
laws that limit the amount of loans to directors. Vicente Valdepenas 
Jr., a monetary board official, said the Philippine Deposit Insurance 
Corp., a government agency that insures bank deposits, will act as 
Orient Bank's receiver. Creditors, including the central bank, couldn't 
collect from Orient Bank until it is known whether it can be reopened, 
said Valdepenas. If not, the bank's assets would be liquidated to 
pay off creditors. The central bank provided emergency loans and overdrafts 
to Orient Bank worth 3.36 billion pesos (dlrs 78 million) at the height 
of the withdrawals. The central bank said a rehabilitation plan submitted 
by Orient Bank's majority owner, Jose Go, would still be considered. 
Under the plan, a prospective investor, Hong Kong-based Goldland Investment 
Co., and its local partners have pledged to initially infuse 2.7 billion 
pesos (dlrs 62.8 million) in fresh capital by Dec. 1 and another 1.8 
billion pesos (dlrs 41.8 million) next year to revive the bank, officials 
said. Foreigners can own up to 60 percent of an existing bank. Major 
Philippine banks were expected to weather the regional financial storm 
because of their solid capital base and established clients but a 
number of smaller banks could collapse due to the tougher operating 
environment, analysts said.
