Iraq aims to produce up to 6 million barrels of oil a day after the 
U.N. sanctions are lifted, but the ambitious plan requires at least 
dlrs 30 billion investments, an Oil Ministry study says. The study 
said it will take five years after the sanctions end to achieve the 
target that will make Iraq the second largest oil producer in the 
world after Saudi Arabia, which extracts 8 million barrels a day. 
Foreign firms have already been invited to develop ``ten super-giant 
oil fields'' as part of the government plan to boost production, said 
the study. A copy was obtained by The Associated Press Wednesday. 
``Iraq may be the only country in the world with giant oil fields, 
fully discovered, fully appraised and just waiting to be developed,'' 
the study said. Companies from France, Russia, China, Italy, Spain, 
India, South Korea, Malaysia and Canada are vying to win the contracts, 
it said. The unabashed attempt to woo investors marks a U-turn for 
Iraq's petroleum industry, which for decades has been fully, owned 
and operated by the government. Sanctions imposed after Iraq's 1990 
invasion of Kuwait barred oil exports, impoverished the country and 
laid waste its oil industry. Now, it appears that only outside money 
can rehabilitate the decrepit infrastructure. Attracting potential 
investors has other benefits: businesses can pressure their governments 
to help Iraq get rid of the sanctions. Iraq produced 3.5 million barrels 
a day before the 1991 Gulf War over Kuwait. Recently, officials have 
said Iraq should be exempted from production quotas of the Organization 
of Petroleum Exporting Countries because of the high losses sustained 
by the sanctions. The study appears to reiterate that stand. It said 
even a daily production of 8 billion barrels a day is attainable with 
the participation of foreign companies. The dlrs 30 billion investment 
needed will be raised by foreign companies selling their share of 
crude that they will produce in Iraq, the study said. Still, it is 
not clear how much money oil companies have committed so far or intend 
to do so. The study said at least five of the 10 super fields have 
already been offered but only two countries _ Russia and China _ have 
signed agreements for the West Qurna oil field and the Ahdab field. 
Negotiations are going on with France's Elf and Total and Italy's 
Agip for other fields, it said. Iraq says its proven reserves are 
112 billion barrels, the world's second largest after Saudi Arabia's 
261 billion barrels. Iraq's probable reserves are 214 billion barrels, 
the study said.
