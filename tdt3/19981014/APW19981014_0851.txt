Tens of thousands of people gathered at a church in northeast Romania 
Wednesday to honor Saint Parascheva, an 11th century Orthodox saint 
who offered sustenance to the poor. People lined up for hours to kiss 
a silver box said to hold Parascheva's bones. She was known for feeding 
and clothing the poor and offering shelter to the homeless. Many people 
in impoverished Romania, where the average national salary is 1.2 
million lei (dlrs 125), feel the need to pray to her. To mark the 
day, authorities in the city of Iasi set up tents and provided traditional 
Romanian minced meat rolled in vine leaves to feed a total of 2,500 
people on what was a local holiday. Overall, some 20,000 people were 
in Iasi for the celebration broadcast live on television. Government 
ministers and lawmakers from Bucharest also attended a service in 
the city, some 325 kilometers (200 miles) northeast of Bucharest. 
Parascheva has been revered for the past 900 years. Almost 90 percent 
of Romanians belong to the Orthodox Church. Romanians are mystical 
people and faithfully honor saints' days and religious feasts.
