Sandy Alomar's body language told the story of how this playoff brush 
with the New York Yankees unfolded so differently for the Cleveland 
Indians this time around. Last year, the team's classy savior sprang 
freely into the air, raised his arms and trotted on clouds as he lifted 
a game-tying home run against the Yankees in the division series. 
The Yankees, just four outs from a series victory, never recovered. 
On Tuesday night, the swivel in Alomar's hips was stiff and slow. 
And the pain was almost unbearable as he played on in the Indians' 
9-5 loss to the Yankees in Game 6 of the American League Championship 
Series at Yankee Stadium. After the team quietly filed through the 
hallway, Alomar stood in a corner of the room with his back wrapped 
in ice. He was a still figure in a Cleveland clubhouse where players 
ate their post-game meal of chicken and rice in silence. Alomar was 
a symbol of how differently this year played itself out for the Indians. 
There would be no celebration, no advancement to the World Series. 
That kind of party went on down the corridor and behind the door of 
the Yankee clubhouse. ``To be honest, I'm proud of this team,'' said 
Alomar, whose season was wracked with injury, leaving him far less 
potent than last year. ``We only had a remote chance of beating Boston 
in the division series, much less challenging the Yankees. We battled. 
We did our best.'' Alomar did whatever he could to play in Game 6 
after missing Game 5 with stiffness in his back, which has two bulging 
disks. He spent all day Monday in Cleveland with doctors, who gave 
him a shot to block the pain in his lower back. But the relief was 
not there. ``I could hardly swing or get out of my crouch,'' said 
Alomar, who wanted to be behind the plate for the starter Charles 
Nagy to depend on. ``I did the best that I could.'' Alomar gave it 
a go. He tried to bunt in vain during one at-bat and had to literally 
throw his bat at a third strike in another. But in trying, Alomar 
was a reminder of an Indians team that battled the Yankees to the 
end. Even after the Indians were down, 6-0, Jim Thome blasted a grand 
slam and tightened the tension in this series once again. ``It would 
have been nice to have pulled it off,'' Thome said. ``It's like I 
say, though, the Yankees are such a good team that even when we were 
up, 2-1, in this series, we knew they had the depth and talent to 
run off three games in a row. There's no complaining or head-hanging 
going on with us. It just didn't work out for us like it did last 
year.'' Last year seemed forever ago to Alomar. It has been a long 
time since he has known the freedom of movement he had as he lifted 
his team against the Yankees in 1997. This time, the scene was far 
different. ``We were banged up, but we gave it all we had,'' Alomar 
said. ``I tried to get fixed up because it was important to me to 
try to play no matter what I had to go through. It was a tough situation. 
But I wanted to be there for my team. I was willing to do anything 
to play.''
