Stocks on Wall Street finish in the plus column. Kitty pilgrim has 
the closing numbers from New York. Kitty? Thanks, Chuck. It was an 
upbeat day on Wall Street. Earnings reports rolled in, many of them 
better than expected. The Dow, which began in Negative territory, 
gained 30 points. We haven't seen this kind of volatility in the market 
for years. It reminds me of the '80s. As long as we continue to see 
the hedge funds in crisis, we will see this. And there will be continued 
spillover, and it's here to stay for a while. There's a big rally 
in the bond market.
