which killed 1 person and wounded more than 100 others. National Correspondent 
Jim Malone has details. Suspected bomber Eric Robert Rudolph has been 
on the run since the January 29th bombing of an abortion clinic in 
Alabama which killed a security guard and wounded a nurse. Now, US 
Attorney General Janet Reno is formerly charging Mr. Rudolph with 
the 1996 Olympic bombing as well as the 1997 bombings of an Atlanta 
area abortion clinic and gay night club. Today, the federal government 
is charging Eric Robert Rudolph with the bombings of the 1996 Summer 
Olympic Games, the Sandy Springs Professional Building, and the Other 
Side Lounge. Eric Rudolph remains in the FBI's list of 10 Most Wanted 
Fugitives and a $1 million reward remains in effect for information 
leading to his arrest. Authorities believe he is hiding out in the 
rugged western mountains of his native North Carolina, but so far 
he has alluded a massive manhunt. Jim Malone, VOA News, Washington.
