Good evening. It has been years and 79 days now since the bombings 
at the Olympics in Atlanta. More than 100 wounded, one woman killed. 
Today Eric Rudolph, one of the FBI's most wanted men was formally 
charged with that bombing. The FBI hopes that maybe this will finally 
help them find Rudolph. Here's Reporter: federal investigators revealed 
a new photograph that the FBI says shows Eric Rudolph in Atlanta during 
the 1996 Olympics. Dressed as he was on the day of the bombing. By 
charging Rudolph with the Olympic bombing, which killed Alice Hawthorne 
in front of her husband and daughter, and injured 100 visitors to 
the summer games, investigators are hoping to change the way Rudolph 
is viewed. It paints a picture of an individual that is not one that 
we believe should be admired as a hero. The FBI and the ATF fear in 
the hills of North Carolina that many people who may have see Rudolph 
are reluctant to Tush him in. Rudolph has been charged with the bombings 
of two abortion clinics and a gay nightclub. But many of those who 
live where the Hunt for Rudolph has been going on for eight months, 
are against abortions and gays. So today, in bringing these new charges, 
authorities stressed some of those injured had no stake in the issue 
of abortion or gay rights. A second bomb was placed and timed to injury 
America's first responders. But in Andrews, North Carolina, today, 
some told us the new charges did not change what they thought of Rudolph. 
This formal charging is not really going to change anybody's opinion 
I don't think. I wouldn't turn him in for $10 million. One investigator 
summed up the frustrating hundred the this way. First we appeal to 
people's civic duty by showing a wanted poster. Then to greed. Now 
we're appealing to people's conscience. John Miller, ABC News, New 
York.
