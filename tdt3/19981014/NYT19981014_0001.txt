W. Allen Wallis, an economist who became president of the University 
of Rochester and held a variety of government posts in Washington, 
died on Monday at Strong Memorial Hospital in Rochester. He was 85 
and lived in Washington. The cause was a stroke he suffered while 
visiting Rochester, said Helene Snihur of the University of Rochester 
office of public relations. Wallis was the university's president 
and chief executive from 1962 to 1970 and its chancellor and chief 
executive from 1970 to 1975, Ms. Snihur said. A former president, 
Robert Sproull, said that in those 13 years, ``Allen Wallis was the 
principal architect of the University of Rochester as we see it today.'' 
The university, which opened in 1850, is known for the Memorial Art 
Gallery, the Eastman School of Music, its schools of dentistry and 
medicine and its library, which is especially strong in the fields 
of medicine, history and music. It has 4,400 full-time undergraduates, 
2,650 full-time graduate students and 1,010 faculty members. While 
he was president, Wallis began a fund-raising campaign that raised 
$46.7 million, nearly $10 million more than its original goal, from 
1965 to 1968. From 1968 to 1978, the university's extensive expansions 
and improvements of its physical plant included remodeling the Eastman 
School and expanding the library and the Medical Center. From 1962 
to 1975, the university's annual budget rose to $200 million from 
$33 million, its faculty grew by 37 percent, its number of graduate 
students doubled and its number of undergraduates increased by 45 
percent. From 1975 until he retired from the university in 1982, Wallis 
was its chancellor. Before going to Rochester, Wallis, who was a statistician 
as well as an economist, was dean of the University of Chicago Graduate 
School of Business from 1956 to 1962. As an economist, Wallis was 
known for his firm faith in minimal government intervention and in 
free markets. His writings included the 1976 book ``An Overgoverned 
Society,'' a collection of his speeches and essays, in which he argued 
that government regulations and rules were fettering individual liberties 
as well as the economy. He served in the administrations of four Republican 
presidents _ Dwight Eisenhower, Richard Nixon, Gerald Ford and Ronald 
Reagan _ although he said in 1959, ``I'm not actually a Republican.'' 
Instead, he said, he was an ``independent'' or even ``apolitical.'' 
He also served as a consultant to numerous governmental and business 
groups. From 1959 to 1961 he was special assistant to Eisenhower, 
and concurrently he collaborated with Vice President Nixon on the 
report of the Cabinet Committee on Price Stability for Economic Growth. 
In the 1970s, Wallis served in the Nixon and Ford administrations 
as chairman of the President's Commission on Federal Statistics and 
of the Advisory Council on Social Security. From 1982 to 1989 he was 
under secretary of state for economic affairs, mostly during the Reagan 
administration. George Shultz, a secretary of state in the Reagan 
years, said Wallis was ``our truth teller.'' Much of Wallis' work 
as under secretary involved international summit meetings. ``I relied 
on him,'' Shultz said. ``His contributions to our work were immense.'' 
Wallis was born in Philadelphia, received his bachelor's degree in 
1932 from the University of Minnesota and did graduate work there, 
at the University of Chicago and at Columbia University. He taught 
at Yale, Columbia and Stanford, and worked in World War II for the 
U.S. Office of Scientific Research before joining the University of 
Chicago business school faculty. Wallis was chairman of the Corporation 
for Public Broadcasting in 1977 and 1978. His wife of 59 years, the 
former Anne Armstrong, died in 1994. He is survived by two daughters, 
Nancy Wallis Ingling of Gambier, Ohio, and Virginia Wallis Cates of 
Wagon Mound, N.M., and three grandchildren.
