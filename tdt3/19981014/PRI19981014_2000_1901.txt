Taiwan's top negotiator on relations with China has completed the 
first full day of his landmark visit to Shanghai. He's held a first 
round of talks with Chinese officials, the highest level contact between 
the two sides for five years. The meeting was described as a good 
start by the Chinese, but both sides made it clear why differences 
remain. From Shanghai, Duncan Hewitt reports. Tujin Foo arrived saying 
he was hoping to build mutual trust in a relationship characterized 
by serious tension in recent years. Now Beijing says its prepared 
to make concessions to Taiwan to achieve reunification. But Mr. Foo 
made it clear that his primary concern was practical matters such 
as the problems faced by Taiwanese businesses w which have invested 
billions of dollars in China. The Chinese side, however, stressed 
that political issues could no longer be avoided and rapid moves towards 
direct transport links across the Taiwan Straits. A further round 
of talks will follow. Duncan Hewitt, BBC, Shanghai.
