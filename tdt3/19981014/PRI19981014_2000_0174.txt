Lawmakers say they've reached tentative agreement on a number of important 
budget issues. NPR's Peter Canyon reports. Republican Congressional 
leaders say they're very close to a budget agreement with the White 
House. House Speaker Newt Gingrich and Senate Majority Leader Trent 
Lott indicated that a deal could be announced at any minute. Disputes 
over spending for education, family planning and how to conduct a 
2000 census were among the issues that kept the two sides from reaching 
agreement until two weeks into the new fiscal year. The $500 billion 
omnibus spending bill combines eight out of 13 spending bills that 
are needed to run the Federal government. A vote on the completed 
measure could come as early as tomorrow.
