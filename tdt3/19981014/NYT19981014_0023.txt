NEW YORK _ ``Binlids'' has a job to do and attempts to get it done 
with the fervor and singleness of purpose of a political campaign. 
In two somber hours, the play, written and performed by residents 
of West Belfast, tells the story of three decades of bloodshed and 
anguish in which the conflict in Northern Ireland, known as the troubles, 
has engulfed their hardscrabble community. The production makes no 
pretense of objectivity. The patchwork presentation, a series of short 
vignettes dramatizing the recurring cycles of terror, slaughter, grief 
and rebellion that consume the lives of ordinary people in the Catholic 
enclave, is unremittingly one-sided, a manifesto more than a play. 
The bloodthirsty British occupiers wear everything but fangs; the 
local residents, harassed and beaten, falsely imprisoned and tortured, 
are portrayed as kind and true and brave, ``with hearts in them like 
lions.'' It is possible to empathize with, even admire, the ill-treated 
minority group depicted in ``Binlids,'' and not feel the same about 
``Binlids'' itself. The play, which opened Sunday at the Angel Orensanz 
Foundation Center on the Lower East Side, has the gritty, ideological 
air of street theater; there is rarely a moment when the speechifying 
and the sloganeering do not sound as if they were ground out of genuine 
pain. But partly because it is so hard to make out the individuals 
behind the speeches and slogans, ``Binlids'' is a wearying experience. 
No matter how justified the arguments may be, it's still just a noisy, 
primitive commercial, overemphatically making its pitch. The production, 
part of a three-year cultural exchange program between Belfast and 
New York, was unsurprisingly a sold-out success in its Belfast debut 
last year; it clearly has a function beyond entertainment. Gerry Adams, 
the president of Sinn Fein, the political branch of the Irish Republican 
Army, has embraced the play, and with good reason. He is a character 
in ``Binlids,'' portrayed as a hero of the conflict and someone whose 
motives have been largely misinterpreted by the media. Adams' supporters 
and some others with a keen interest in the region will undoubtedly 
find the work cathartic; in its sharpest moments, ``Binlids'' is reminiscent 
of the workers' call to arms sounded by Clifford Odets in ``Waiting 
for Lefty.'' The play's title is an amalgamation of two words that 
for the people of West Belfast connote an instrument of defiance that 
had the same function as Paul Revere's famous ride. Residents slam 
trash can covers _ ``bin lids'' _ against the pavement to warn of 
the advance of British troops into their neighborhoods. The metaphor 
is well suited. ``Binlids'' is an effort to get a community's message 
out. The enemy, it seems, has not only stood behind the barrel of 
an automatic rifle, but also has been sitting in the government public 
relations offices and the newsrooms where, the play asserts, opinion 
makers have been busy slandering the Catholic minority. To the ``Binlids'' 
characters, played by 18 actors from Northern Ireland, amateurs and 
professionals, the picture the world has been given of their community 
has been vilely distorted. In one scene, condemnatory editorials in 
British and Irish newspapers, describing violence-torn West Belfast 
as barbaric, are read aloud, as the local women reply in a chorus: 
``That's not us . . . , that's not us . . .'' Their chant supplies 
the play with a kind of anthem. The difficulty is that in this defensive 
posture, ``Binlids'' never supplies much texture, never clarifies 
who the ``us'' is. The director Pam Brighton stages ``Binlids'' as 
an interactive event. Scenes are played on five isolated platforms 
that ring the theater. Audience members stand in the center, occasionally 
mixing with the actors, who pass among them, whispering word of military 
atrocities and marching in picket lines. The narrative is cinematic 
and chronological. The starting point is the 1971 British campaign 
of internment _ the policy of imprisonment without formal charges 
_ and the play reveals its impact on everyday people arrested without 
apparent reason, tortured and caught in the cross-fire of British 
troops and Irish nationalists. Often, though, characters sound more 
like spokesmen than victims. In the midst of the carnage, for instance, 
an angry if unusually well-informed woman explains to her neighbor: 
``Since August '69, 21 percent of Catholic families living in Belfast 
have been moved from their homes. You know, it was the biggest shift 
of population since World War II.'' The director might as well have 
turned on a megaphone. The gunfire is interspersed with partisan folk 
songs, prettily sung a cappella by Terence O'Neill and Rachel Fitzgerald. 
Ultimately, though, the music suffers the fate of the rest of this 
one-dimensional production: it all hits the same exhausted note. PRODUCTION
