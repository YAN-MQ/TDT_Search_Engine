Spain's consumer price index was up 0.1 percent in September from 
August _ a relatively small increase that meant the yearly rate fell 
to 1.6 percent from 2.1 percent over the same period, the national 
statistics institute announced Wednesday. Also Wednesday Finance Minister 
Rodrigo Rato reiterated that the government has slightly raised its 
forecast for Spanish economic growth in 1998 to 3.8, upping the previous 
forecast by 0.1 percent despite the worldwide economic crisis.
