National Basketball Association officials have cancelled the first 
two weeks of the upcoming season, wiping out regular season contests 
for the first time in the NBA's 52-year history because of a labor 
dispute. After talks with the players, union stalled on Tuesday in 
New York, NBA commissioner, David Stern said team owners decided to 
make the unprecedented announcement to break the string of thirty-five 
thousand games. This is not a very pleasant announcement. But, the 
realities or it are such that I think the owners have no choice. The 
NBA season of eighty-two games per club were scheduled to have started 
on November 3rd. The owners locked-out players in July saying they 
could not afford to play this season under existing salary rules. 
Players Union Chief, Billy Hunter, is hopeful serious consideration 
of a new proposal will help save the rest of the season. We submitted 
the proposal that we were looking for some kind of response from the 
NBA. And depending upon what kind of response we get from them on 
Friday will determine what kind of progress we make and whether or 
not can in fact salvage the games in November and/or December. Owners 
have demanded salary limits without exceptions. But players want the 
continuation of exemptions, allowing clubs to sign their own free-agent 
players with no salary limits.
