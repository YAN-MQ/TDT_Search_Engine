China is continuing its campaign to isolate Taiwan diplomatically 
even as the sides move to end a three-year impasse in their dialogue, 
Foreign Minister Jason Hu said Wednesday. China is unrelenting in 
its drive to win away the 27 countries that still recognize Taiwan 
and wipe out Taiwan's formal diplomatic relations by century's end, 
Hu told a legislative committee. ``As long as the Chinese communists 
have a chance (to attack Taiwan's diplomatic relations) there's no 
way they'll ever release pressure,'' Hu said. His statements came 
as Taiwan's senior envoy to China made his way to Shanghai for informal 
meetings that represent the most significant contact between the sides 
since Beijing suspended negotiations in 1993. Taiwan hopes the contacts 
_ including meetings with Chinese President Jiang Zemin in Beijing 
_ will help plot a course back to negotiations on practical issues 
such as resolving fishing disputes, while China hopes to win concessions 
on political matters steering the sides toward reunification. But 
Chang King-yuh, Taiwan's top Cabinet official for China, said Tuesday 
that no real breakthrough in relations can occur until China ends 
its suppression of Taiwan's foreign relations. China considers Taiwan 
a breakaway province and furiously denies the island's right to diplomatic 
relations. Beijing froze talks in June 1993 in anger over Taiwanese 
attempts to participate more fully in international society. China 
and Taiwan divided politically in 1949, when Chiang Kai-shek's Nationalists 
took refuge on the island from the Communist takeover of the mainland. 
Taiwan launched a campaign six years ago to rejoin the United Nations, 
where its seat was awarded to China in 1971, and has sought to expand 
both official and unofficial ties with other nations.
