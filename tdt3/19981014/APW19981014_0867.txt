The dusty streets of Arab towns in Israel have became the latest of 
several locations where Oscar-winner Al Pacino is filming scenes for 
his upcoming film. The star of ``The Godfather,'' trilogy spent Tuesday 
and Wednesday shooting scenes for the film, ``Man of the People,'' 
where his character, a ``60 Minutes'' producer, interviews a leader 
of the Iranian-backed Lebanese guerrilla group Hezbollah, the daily 
Yediot Ahronot reported. When plans for filming in Lebanon fell through, 
predominately Arab towns in Israel were chosen instead, including 
Umm al-Fahm, the site of violent clashes last month between Israeli 
police and Arabs involving a land dispute. Scenes for the film have 
also been shot in several locations around the United States.
