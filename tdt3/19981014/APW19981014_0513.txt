The much-awaited potency pill Viagra has finally hit the shelves in 
Italy _ but no one's rushing to snatch it up. Pharmacies across Italy 
reported Wednesday that few, if any, customers had purchased the blue 
pills on its first day of sales. ``I think it's like everything else,'' 
said Giuliana Bedini, owner of a Rome pharmacy. ``When it is illegal 
everyone wants it, but once it is legal people become indifferent.'' 
A rush was predicted, in part because thousands of Italian men had 
flocked to pharmacies in the tiny republic of San Marino, about 250 
miles (400 kms) northeast of Rome, where the drug has been on sale 
for months. But Bedini said not a single customer had bought the drug 
from her, although hundreds had called to ask if it was in stock. 
Some pharmacists said potential customers may be embarassed, while 
others may not have prescriptions yet. Unlike its Italian counterparts, 
Vatican City's well-stocked pharmacy will not sell Viagra. A Vatican 
spokeswoman suggested there would be little demand from its clients. 
The European Union gave the green light for Viagra on Sept. 15.
