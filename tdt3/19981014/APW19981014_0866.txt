About 1,000 Indians have been blocking the entrances to the Copan 
ruins to demand a share of the tourist attraction's revenue, and hotel 
owners on Wednesday asked the president to intervene. An estimated 
200,000 tourists visit the Copan Archaeological Park every year to 
see the Mayan ruins 100 miles (180 kilometers) west of Tegucigalpa, 
the capital. In 1980, the United Nations declared it a protected historical 
site. The park takes in dlrs 800,000 a year from tourism, and the 
Chorti Indians who have shut the park for four days say they deserve 
25 percent of that income. They also are demanding the punishment 
of the killers of 43 of their leaders in the past six years. Authorities 
say the killings are carried out by soldiers hired by landowners, 
who are trying to take over Indian territory, but none of the crimes 
has been punished. The Honduran Hotel Association said the protest 
is causing great losses to at least 26 hotels, and on Wednesday asked 
President Carlos Flores Facusse to find a quick solution. ``Many reservations 
from tourists in the United States, Japan, Germany and Argentina have 
been canceled because of the Indian protest,'' said the association's 
president, Anastasius Anastasius. ``I have asked the president to 
intervene as soon as possible in this case so that tourists are no 
longer bothered ... and I expect an official decision very soon.'' 
The government refused to comment. About 600,000 of Honduras' 6.1 
million people are Indian. Most of them live in extreme poverty.
