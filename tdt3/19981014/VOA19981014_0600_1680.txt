In Donna Ana County, New Mexico, Southern New Mexico, the Sheriff's 
Department has a new addition to its fleet of patrol cars. This one 
won't be chasing after suspects and speeders, though, the patrol car 
is a restored 1949 Ford Custom. It contains police gear appropriate 
to it's time: a flashing light, a 2-way radio and a siren that makes 
a slightly whining sound. That sets it apart from any modern police 
cars that have radar guns and mobile computer terminals. And there's 
no air conditioning, quite unusual today in the desert climate of 
the Southwestern United States. Sheriff James Robel says he restored 
the Ford patrol car to show what police work was like nearly half 
a century ago. The 1949 car will see some limited duty such as appearances 
in parades and in car shows.
