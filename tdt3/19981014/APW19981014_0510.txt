Russian Prime Minister Yevgeny Primakov tried to assure Italian auto 
giant Fiat on Wednesday that Russia's economy will remain open to 
foreign investment, a news agency reported. ``You must know that Russia 
wants to be an open economy,'' Primakov told Fiat representatives, 
according to the Interfax news agency. ``We will not shut ourselves 
off from the world. We want cooperation with foreign partners.'' Fiat 
is involved in a joint venture with Russia's Gaz automaker, and has 
said it does not intend to back down from the deal in spite of a crippling 
financial crisis in Russia that has sent many foreign investors into 
panic. Fiat is ``important for the Russian as well as the Italian 
economy,'' Primakov said. ``We are proceeding to a new stage of relations 
and industrial cooperation.''
