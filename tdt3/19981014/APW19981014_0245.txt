Prime Minister Yevgeny Primakov suggested Wednesday that Russia helped 
bring about the apparent breakthrough in the Kosovo crisis by threatening 
to break relations with NATO. ``Look how they respect Russia in the 
world,'' Primakov told the Federation Council, the upper house of 
parliament. ``We openly told the West that if bombs were dropped on 
Kosovo, we would sharply change our attitude to NATO and reconsider 
our orientation,'' he said. ``This is the main argument that is now 
working.'' U.S. envoy Richard Holbrooke brokered an agreement with 
Yugoslav President Slobodan Milosevic on Monday that at least temporarily 
averts NATO airstrikes to end the crackdown on ethnic Albanians in 
Kosovo. Primakov, who discussed the situation during a meeting Wednesday 
with President Boris Yeltsin, said the Russian leader ``approved of 
the turn in the events'' in Kosovo and ordered his officials to continue 
work ``in the same direction,'' the ITAR-Tass news agency reported. 
Milosevic agreed to withdraw his forces from Kosovo, begin peace negotiations 
and allow international observers into the troubled province. ``Today 
the situation around Kosovo is easing,'' Primakov said. ``We must 
touch wood, but it appears there will be no airstrikes.'' The six-country 
Contact Group is scheduled to meet Thursday to discuss further steps 
to bring peace in Kosovo. Russian Foreign Minister Igor Ivanov was 
to travel to Paris on Wednesday evening to attend the meeting, said 
ministry spokesman Vladimir Rakhmanin, according to ITAR-Tass. A Russian 
parliamentary delegation, meanwhile, left for Kosovo to get a first-hand 
look at what is happening in the southern Serb province and examine 
sites that could be targeted by NATO airstrikes. The delegation is 
expected to stay in Kosovo for three or four days, ITAR-Tass said. 
The lower house of parliament, the State Duma, also drafted a resolution 
Wednesday denouncing the ``NATO threat to unleash a war against the 
Union Republic of Yugoslavia.'' The draft, to be finalized later Wednesday, 
stated that airstrikes against Serbia move would hurt NATO's relations 
with Russia and fuel tensions in Europe. Duma speaker Gennady Seleznyov 
also told a British parliamentary delegation Wednesday that if NATO 
goes ahead with its plans for military action, Russia may revoke its 
agreement on friendship and cooperation with the alliance. Russia 
opposes NATO airstrikes against Serbia, which makes up most of present-day 
Yugoslavia. Russia and Serbia are allies, both being Slavic countries 
that practice the Orthodox Christian religion.
