people, today's agenda: the information age. - What happened to the 
industrial age? - That was last century. Those were the days. You 
built it, you sold it. No more living in the past. Today, it's not

so proactive around the milleniums. All I know is that they need help

ideas. Share documents. Have conversations. Right, so they can create 
knowledge they can use. -They'll need a digital office-- -with new 
software. - New hardware. - Relax. I've got us a partner down there. 
- But they only make-- - not anymore they don't. oh.
