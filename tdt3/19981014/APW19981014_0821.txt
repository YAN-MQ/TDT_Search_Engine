BRUSSELS, Belgium (AP) - The European Union said Wednesday the 15 
EU countries should follow the example of the United States by developing 
their services sectors to create more jobs. In a draft report on employment 
rates in the Union, the EU executive Commission noted that 39.2 percent 
of the EU's working age population is employed in services. In the 
United States, the figure is 54.2 percent. ``The gap in employment 
between Europe and the US is not in agriculture, manufacturing, or 
the public sector, but in the services sector,'' the Commission report 
said. It said the difference in employment rates is particularly marked 
in three sectors: communal services, business services and distribution, 
hotels and restaurants. The report noted that 20 years ago, employment 
rates in the United States and Europe were similar. But in 1997, ``the 
spread was 14 percentage points, equivalent to some 34 million jobs.'' 
The Commission released three draft reports assessing efforts the 
15 EU countries have made over the past year to adopt EU guidelines 
on employment. These guidelines were mapped out last November at an 
EU summit where leaders pledged to cut red tape, lower taxes to help 
businesses create new jobs and expand vocational training for the 
EU's 18 million unemployed. The guidelines adopted at the Luxembourg 
summit carried no sanctions but the 15 EU countries were supposed 
to present annual, so-called action plans to show they were keeping 
to their promises. ``The efforts made by the 15 EU countries have 
surpassed our expectations,'' Commission President Jacques Santer 
told a news conference. The EU leaders first reported on their efforts 
to implement the EU guidelines six months after Luxembourg at a summit 
in Cardiff, Wales. The three Commission reports presented Wednesday 
will go to the next EU summit in Vienna in December.
