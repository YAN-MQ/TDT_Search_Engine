Pope John Paul II sets down his views on religion in modern society 
in an encyclical being issued by the Vatican on Thursday. The encyclical, 
one of the most important documents a pope can issue, is entitled, 
in Latin, ``Fides et Ratio,'' meaning, ``Faith and Reason.'' It is 
the 13th encyclical of John Paul's papacy and timed to come out a 
day before he marks the 20th anniversary of his election as pope. 
The Vatican has also scheduled a news conference after the release. 
The panel includes Cardinal Joseph Ratzinger, the watchdog of Vatican 
orthodoxy.
