American Lindsay Davenport won her first match as the world's top-ranked 
woman Wednesday, posting a second-round straight-sets win over French 
qualifier Julie Halard-Decugis at the European Championships. The 
22-year-old American began the defense of her European crown _ as 
well as her reign atop the rankings _ with a convincing 6-4, 6-2 win 
over the French player in just 58 minutes for a place in the quarterfinals. 
``I definitely wanted to win this match,'' said Davenport, who officially 
took over as the world's top player from Martina Hingis on Monday. 
``But it was hard to play. Being No.1 adds a little more pressure. 
``I thought, oh God, people are going to think I should play so well 
because I'm No.1 ... but what if I don't play that well?'' Davenport 
got off to a shakey start, holding serve to go 1-1, but then losing 
the next three games and giving Halard-Decugis a 4-1 lead. The American 
quickly rallied back, however, serving up a love game before breaking 
back to return on serve. At 4-4, the American broke Halard-Decugis 
to go up 5-4, then served for the set. The two traded breaks to go 
2-2 in the second set, before Davenport broke the French player twice 
in a row to clinch the win. ``I thought it was going to be a difficult 
match because she can get really hot sometimes,'' said Davenport, 
who won five titles this season, including the U.S. Open. ``I didn't 
play very great tennis tonight but I played well enough to win. ``I'm 
never going to be a Graf or Seles and be great right from the start,'' 
said the soft-spoken American. ``Often I have to play my way into 
a tournament so I don't appear to be that great a player at the beginning. 
But I get through.'' The victory extended Davenport's five-year winning 
streak in Switzerland to 14 victories. The American's run began at 
the 1993 European Open in Lucerne, where she captured her first career 
title at the age of 16. She went on to defend that title in 1994 before 
winning in Zurich last year. Third-seed Conchita Martinez became the 
first seeded player to get knocked out of the tournament, the Spaniard 
surrendering 6-2, 7-6 (7-0) to Romania's Irina Spirlea. The Romanian 
won the first four games of the match before Martinez was able to 
keep her first serve. But the distance was too much for the Spaniard 
to make up and Spirlea took the opening set unchallenged. In the second 
set, a determined Martinez broke the Romanian's second serve then 
held to jump to a 4-1 lead. But the Spaniard's game began to crumble 
once more, and Spirlea came back from a 5-2 deficit to win the next 
three games and even the score. Forcing a tie-break, the Romanian 
then steamrolled over a passive Martinez for the win. In earlier second 
round play, seventh-seed Mary Pierce of France defeated South African 
lucky-loser Joanette Kruger 7-6 (8-6), 6-1. With boyfriend Baltimore 
Orioles star second-baseman Roberto Alomar watching from the sidelines, 
Pierce at first had difficulty finding her rythm in the first set. 
But the French player clearly found it early on in the second, which 
she took in just 33 minutes. Sixth-seed Amanda Coetzer of South Africa 
easily advanced to the quarterfinals with a 6-3, 6-1 victory over 
Romania's Ruxandra Dragomir. Second-round action will continue Thursday 
with three Americans on center court. Second-seed Venus Williams will 
play lucky-loser compatriot Corina Morariu, and Lisa Raymond will 
face fourth-seed Nathalie Tauziat of France. Eighth-seed Dominique 
Van Roost, who brought to an end Hingis's 80-week reign at the top 
of the standings with a quarterfinal victory in Filderstadt last week, 
will play France's Amelie Mauresmo. With Hingis out due to an ankle 
injury, Patty Schnyder will continue to carry Swiss hopes during her 
second-round match against Austrian wildcard Barbara Schett.
