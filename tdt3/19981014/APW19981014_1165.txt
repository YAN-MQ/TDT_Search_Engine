An Iraqi child who was treated in Scotland for malnutrition and leukemia 
because of the efforts of a British lawmaker arrived in Jordan Wednesday 
on her way back home. The 4-year-old Mariam Hamza, who has lost her 
hair from chemotherapy, was carried by her grandmother, Faten Hamid, 
into a VIP airport lounge after arriving in Amman on a commercial 
flight. ``Thank God, Mariam was taken to England and received the 
treatment,'' Mrs. Hamid said. The girl was accompanied by Iraqi-British 
physician Foutouh Binyamin and Labor Party Parliament member George 
Galloway who had taken her out of Iraq in April. Binyamin said the 
girl underwent chemotherapy and radiotherapy for several months in 
a Scottish hospital. ``She is in a remission stage and has recovered,'' 
he said. The group is scheduled to leave for Baghdad Thursday aboard 
a private plane that has been approved to fly to Iraq by the United 
Nations in an exemption from the sanctions, which prevent flights 
to and from the country. The U.N. also had allowed Mariam to be flown 
out of Baghdad instead of subjecting her to the grueling drive of 
at least 10 hours across the desert to the Amman airport. Galloway, 
a regular visitor to Iraq, has long called for the lifting of0Yor 
her to be treated in Scotland. She also was suffering from salmonella. 
Galloway said he wanted to highlight the suffering of the Iraqi public 
due to U.N. sanctions that have caused severe shortages of medicines 
and medical equipment. Iraqi officials say hundreds of children die 
every day in the country. Mariam's cancer treatment cost 55,000 pounds 
sterling (dlrs 93,000), which was paid for by private donations. The 
girl, who brought with her 3,000 toys for other Iraqi children and 
medication for two years, was taken to Al Amal cancer hospital in 
Amman for an overnight stay.
