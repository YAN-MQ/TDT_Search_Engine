The Braves' bats were silent again while another San Diego starter 
was dominating as the padres are now on their way to the world series. 
Sterling hitchcock and company shut down Atlanta, 5-0, wrapping up 
the national league pennant, four games to two. I don't think enough 
has been said about our pitching staff here, and certainly the job 
stu has done with us. You know, so I give the other guys in our locker 
room a lot of credit. I can't say enough about what he did. Through 
the whole post-season, he had to go against Johnson, Maddux and glavine. 
You know, he gave us what we needed. Yeah, it's unbelievable, we're 
0-3 at home. It's just -- so much for home field advantages. I'm extremely 
happy. I'm extremely happy for those guys in our locker room, for 
the organization and for the city of San Diego. We all have waited 
a long time, and the fact that we've going to the world series again 
is great, but I'm gonna tell you know, we want to win it. Finally 
a day after being released by Carolina, quarterback Kerry Collins 
has been claimed on waivers by the saints. Jerome Jurenovich, "Headline 
Sports."
