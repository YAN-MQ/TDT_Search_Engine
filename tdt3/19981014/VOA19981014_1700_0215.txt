Zimbabwe's president has blasted what he calls "continuing aggression" 
by Rwanda and Uganda in Congo Cinchasa. Robert Mogave made the charge 
as he returned from a meeting in Lubanbashe with Congolese President 
Lauran Kavela. Rwanda denies involvement in Congo. Uganda says its 
troops are in Congo, but only to combat rebels with bases there. Mr. 
Mogave said a possible Zimbabwe intervention in eastern Congo will 
be discussed soon in a meeting between Mr. Kavela and his African 
allies.
