And from our department of the impossible being possible. In Canada, 
a man named Christopher Berry received a letter from his mother. He's 
a chef who lives in the Canadian province of British Columbia. She 
lives in Blackpool, England. And the fact that the letter came from 
a long way from England, well, that really wasn't that unusual. What 
was unusual is the fact that the letter didn't have an address. Mr. 
Berry says his mother has a little bit of difficulty with senility 
and she sometimes forgets to put his address on here letters. All 
the envelope said was "To: Mr. Christopher Berry". Somehow that letter 
made it through the mail sorting systems of both Britain and Canada 
and into Mr. Berry's mailbox. And it only took a week believe it or 
not. British and Canadian postal officials say they don't how the 
letter without an address got to the right person. But, I think it's 
remarkable that it happened all the same and nice that his mom was 
able to stay in touch with him.
