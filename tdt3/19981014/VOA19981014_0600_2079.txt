The Noble Prize for Economics has been awarded to Professor Amartea 
Cien of Trinity College Cambridge. Dr. Cien found out about the award 
early this morning in his hotel room in New York City. Susan Clark 
of the OA was the first member of the media to reach him after he 
was notified by the Noble Committee. Just a few minutes ago because 
I was rung up and don't expect phone calls at 5am normally, of course. 
I was worried that somebody might be ill or something might have happened. 
It turned out to be a lot of good news. Yes. Uh, great good news. 
Perhaps you could tell us a little bit about your work and what the 
Noble Committee has cited you for. I think they cited me for work 
in what they call Welfare Economics which is not a term that is, um, 
standardly used in-in-- in -in-- in, um, in, um, the media. Uh, but 
it's a more, uh, technical term. It's really economics dealing with, 
um, assessment of how well things are going for the, uh, members of 
the society. It really concerns with, um, evaluation and assessment, 
uh, of, uh, achievements and failures. So, it really concerns with, 
um, no predications and such. I also done some work on prediction 
but, uh, with evaluation. That's the essential thing about welfare 
economics. That is if you want to say that, uh, things turned out 
to be terribly bad in some situation, uh, then to explain that why 
that evaluation or that judgement or that assessment might be appropriate 
would be, uh, would be part of the domain of the subject. Dr. Cien, 
I will let you go. I know that, uh, this is the first call you've 
had from the media? This is the first call. I just talked to my wife 
who's in England and my daughter. But, um, I think I'll get myself 
a cup of coffee and face it. That's probably a good idea. Congratulations. 
I will let you go. Thank you. Dr. Amartea Cien's work has combined 
tools from economics and from philosophy. In awarding him the Noble 
Prize for Economics, the Royal Swedish Academy of Scientists said 
that by combining tools from economics and philosophy, he has restored 
an ethical dimension to the discussion of vital economic problems. 
Dr. Cien spoke with VOA Susan Clark.
