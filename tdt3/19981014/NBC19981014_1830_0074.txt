Good evening. Good evening. It is your government and money. Tonight 
the congressional republicans have a deal on the way they want to 
spend it. It was a contentious give and take, but in the end the White 
House claims the president demonstrated he may be down politically 
but he is certainly not out. NBC's David Bloom is standing by at the 
White House. Tom, the president branded this a "do-nothing" Congress, 
but tonight, both sides say a $500 billion budget deal is all but 
done. And even republicans concede that when it came to the biggest 
hurdle, money for education, republicans in Congress decided they'd 
rather go home and campaign, than stay and fight an embattled but 
still popular president. In the end, republicans gave the president 
most of what he wanted in terms of education spending, hundreds of 
millions of dollars for early reading and after-school programs. $1.1 
billion so local schools can hire up to 100,000 new teachers. But 
republicans killed the president's biggest ticket education item, 
$5 billion for school construction. Mr. Clinton's biggest victories 
-- republicans abandoned their plan for an $80 billion tax cut, meaning 
the budget surplus is largely saved for social security. $6 billion 
in emergency farm aid. $18 billion for the international monetary 
fund. The president's biggest defeats -- anti-smoking legislation, 
a patients' "Bill of rights" and campaign finance reform, all failed 
to get through Congress. It is expected that congressional republicans 
and democrats, perhaps even the president, will formally announce 
the budget deal later tonight. In recent days Mr. Clinton has been 
anxious to talk about public policy issues like education and focus 
attention away from upcoming impeachment hearings.
