Cambodian Leader Hun Sen has rejected an opposition call for political 
talks outside the country. A government's spokesman said Cambodia's 
political deadlock is an internal matter. He adds, the government 
cannot afford to pay for a meeting outside the country. Cambodia's 
opposition has called for overseas talks to ensure a peaceful and 
neutral atmosphere. Cambodia's rival parties have been unable to settle 
a deadlock on forming a coalition government.
