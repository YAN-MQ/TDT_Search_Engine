NAto leaders say Yugoslav President Slobodan Milosevic is not meeting 
demands to restore peace in Kosovo. The deal Milosevic agreed to, 
allow international observers into the area. He has until sad morninging 
to show he is in compliance, but NAto is prepared to carry out air 
strikes if Milosevic breaks his word. A final activation order was 
approved yesterday before the deal was reached. Richard Holbrooke 
says, dealing with Milosevic is tricky. You can withdraw forces and 
send them back in, and he's tricked people before. What we put into 
place here is a ground verification regime. 2,000 international verifiers 
under an American leader, I might add, will go into Kosovo as quickly 
as possible. From the air, NATO will conduct a heavy, intensive, surveillance 
reconnaissance mission. Yugoslav air force will turn off its radar 
and put its antiaircraft guns into storage, so there is no danger. 
Some international aid projects are starting back up now that an agreement 
has been reached. Some workers have already begun returning to Kosovo.
