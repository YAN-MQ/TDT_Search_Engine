All right. in sports, a round of applause for the New York Yankees. 
Major league baseball's Yankees are champions of the American League. 
The Yankees won the pendant with a victory over the Cleveland Indians. 
VOA's Breck Artery has details. The Yankees won by a score of 9-5 
and demonstrated why they won 114 games in the regular season. A depth 
of talent and consistently solid play. After the game, Yankee's manager, 
Joe Torre paid tribute to his players and specifically to Darryl Strawberry, 
the Yankees star who is currently in the hospital recovering from 
cancer surgery. You know, it's not a fluke. And, uh, Darryl, this 
is yours baby. You pushed us and we can't tell you how much we appreciate 
it and we know you're going to be all right. The victory in the best 
of seven series came in game six before a sell-out crowd at Yankee 
Stadium. Now that the Yankees have won the American League Championship, 
they will be in the World Series for the 35th time in history facing 
the National League Champions who will be either the San Diego Padres 
or the Atlanta Braves. Breck Artery, VOA News, New York.
