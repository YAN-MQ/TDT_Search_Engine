Prince Charles, ever protective of his motherless sons, will complain 
to a press watchdog over a tabloid newspaper report Wednesday that 
Prince Harry had to have a close marine-style haircut after an attempt 
to emulate a favorite soccer star's crop went wrong. Charles' office 
said he will write to the self-regulatory Press Complaints Commission 
about the front-page story in The Mirror, which said 14-year-old Harry 
and his classmates at prestigious Eton College had tried to copy soccer 
player Michael Owen's short haircut. For effect, The Mirror published 
computer-generated images of how ''Harry the skinhead'' might look. 
He is third in line to the throne after his father and brother William, 
16. Sandy Henney, Charles' spokeswoman, said the story and pictures 
``raise a general issue about the extent to which individual news 
stories about Prince William and Prince Harry cumulatively constitute 
an intrusion into their privacy.'' ``It is a matter of considerable 
concern to the Prince of Wales, who will be raising the matter with 
the chairman of the Press Complaints Commission and industry's Code 
of Practice Committee,'' which has drawn up rules on good practice, 
she said. Mirror editor Piers Morgan said the newspaper had informed 
Charles' office on Tuesday afternoon that it intended to publish the 
story, and it ''never once raised any concerns with us that it might 
be invading Harry's privacy.'' ``Indeed, they agreed with our belief 
that it was both amusing and harmless and provided us with official 
confirmation,'' he said. Since the death 14 months ago of Princess 
Diana in a Paris car crash with photographers in pursuit, most British 
newspapers have adhered to a request from the royal family to leave 
the young princes alone. Morgan said in the last year the Mirror ''has 
rejected countless stories about both Prince William and Prince Harry 
... as we have no wish to cause either boy any upset by running invasive 
or intrusive stories about their private lives.''
