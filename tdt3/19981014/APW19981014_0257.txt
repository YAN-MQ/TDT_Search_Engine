Delegates from the former staunchly pro-apartheid Dutch Reformed Church 
deliberated Wednesday whether to desegregate by merging with a non-white 
sister church. But _ in an echo of the racially divisive past _ a 
plea written by the non-white church during the anti-apartheid struggle 
is proving to be a stumbling block to a merger. The plea calls for 
social justice and racial equality. The mixed-race Uniting Reformed 
Church says it will only accept its white counterpart if it approves 
the plea, called the Confession of Belhar. Four years after apartheid 
ended, the church that formed the religious backbone of white minority 
rule appeared to be reluctant to do that. ``My hope and prayer is 
that it will go through,'' said delegate Piet Meiring. ``But I doubt 
it.'' Some delegates said they felt they were being forced to sanction 
a theologically unacceptable document rooted in outdated anti-apartheid 
history. Uniting Reformed Church leader James Buys said he suspected 
white church members were objecting to the merger because of persistent 
racism, not fine theological points. Outgoing Dutch Reformed Church 
leader Freek Swanepoel told The Associated Press his church should 
accept the Confession of Belhar ``because it came out of the heart 
of Christians.'' On Tuesday, nearly all 400 delegates at the white 
church's national meeting _ held once every four years _ approved 
a resolution denouncing apartheid as ``sinful.'' By adopting the resolution, 
the Dutch Reformed Church reactivated its membership in the 75-million 
strong World Alliance of Reformed Churches, which comprises reformed 
and Presbyterian churches. The world body had suspended the Dutch 
Reformed Church in 1982 because it violated teachings of the Bible. 
There were unconfirmed reports that the integration proposal has angered 
provincial branches of the Dutch Reformed Church and that they are 
threatening to break away. Last month, the 164,000-member Free State 
provincial branch was reported to have opposed the merger because 
it objected to worshipping with blacks and people of mixed race. Starting 
in 1982, the 1.5-million-member white church _ the main religious 
denomination of Afrikaner descendants of Dutch settlers _ gradually 
renounced its hard-line position but kept separate branches for blacks, 
mixed-race and Indian congregants. In 1994, when apartheid ended with 
the country's first all-race elections, the black and mixed-race branches 
merged to become the 1.5-million-member Uniting Reformed Church.
