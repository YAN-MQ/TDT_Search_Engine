Singapore Trade and Industry Minister Lee Yock Suan said Wednesday 
he is happy with the recent strengthening of the yen against the U.S. 
dollar, which he said corrects previous excessive market moves and 
will make the region more competitive. ``Personally, I am happy to 
see the strength of the yen,'' Lee told Dow Jones Newswires during 
a World Economic Forum conference in Singapore. ``It helps to compensate 
for the excessive movement of the currencies to the extent that Asian 
values were undervalued,'' he added. Lee said he doesn't think a weaker 
U.S. dollar will hurt the American economy, an important factor in 
a Southeast Asian recovery, while it could increase Japanese demand 
for regional goods and services. ``The U.S. dollar is strong for a 
good reason. The U.S. economy is strong,'' he said. ``The way Asian 
currencies have devalued, we are still very competitive.'' Lee said 
he expects the U.S. and European economies to remain strong and the 
foreign exchange fluctuation to have no impact on Singapore exports. 
Lee also reiterated comments made in Parliament Monday that after 
Singapore's economic growth declined from 6.1 percent in the first 
quarter to 1.6 percent in the second, the trend is expected to continue 
into the third. He offered no estimate for third-quarter data. Prime 
Minister Goh Chok Tong recently revised GDP growth expectations for 
this year downward to 0 to 1 percent.
