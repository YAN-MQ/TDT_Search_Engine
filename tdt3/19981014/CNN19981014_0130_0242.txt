The justice department says it may charge fugitive Eric Rudolph with 
three Atlanta-area bombings as early as Wednesday. Rudolph already 
is wanted in connection with an explosion at an Alabama women's clinic 
in January. Justice officials also have linked him to the 1996 bombing 
at Olympic park and two other explosions around Atlanta. Rudolph has 
so far eluded a massive man-Hunt in the mountains of North Carolina.
