This is The World. I'm Tony Kahn. Don't believe media reports that 
say the agreement with Slobodan Milosevic to pull his troops out of 
Kosovo has averted the threat of air strikes against Serbia. That 
was the warning from NATO today and it wasn't the only one. In Athens, 
Greece, an American diplomat emphasized that we have not yet arrived 
at a sustained peaceful solution in Kosovo and the leader of Kosovo's 
ethnic Albanians urged NATO to keep the pressure on Belgrade. In a 
few minutes, a Serbian priest in Kosovo shares with us his worries 
and his hopes about the accord.
