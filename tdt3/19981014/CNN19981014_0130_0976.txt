Airlines are cracking down again on carry-on baggage. They have installed 
plexiglass templates on X-Ray machines. The openings in the templates 
match the size of a bag that fits under the seat or in the overhead 
compartment. If the bag can't go through the opening, you can't take 
it on board with you. United, Delta and continental have been testing 
the system at New York's laguardia airport. The new rule is to go 
in effect next month.
