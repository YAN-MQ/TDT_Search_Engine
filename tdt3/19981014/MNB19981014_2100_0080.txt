First tonight when "The Washington Post" came out this morning it 
hit with a thud up and down Pennsylvania avenue from the hill to the 
Clinton White House. Inside were the thoughts of Henry Hyde on what 
he may go after the president on, what he may cast aside. Today that 
changed a bit as the lead story briefly became a rare piece of actual 
legislation that it looks like got through the Senate. The Senate 
television and radio gallery tonts, scene of the democratic announcement 
that an apparent deal has been reached. We're going to begin on the 
hill tonight with NBC news correspondent Gwen Ifill. Well, even no 
the democrats and republicans are still fighting about exactly what 
is in this big budget agreement. The democrats are coming to tell 
us what they think is in it but the republicans have gone to dinner 
so what we think they've agreed on is that the president will get 
the $1.1 billion he was saying that this whole thing was hung up on 
but the bad news for him is that it doesn't go to the department of 
education, it goes right to classrooms. A big disagreement. The democrats 
don't necessarily want to leave town, they want the republicans to 
suffer and listen to them talk about education. And the republicans 
want the democrats to stayed off the campaign trail. So here we go.
