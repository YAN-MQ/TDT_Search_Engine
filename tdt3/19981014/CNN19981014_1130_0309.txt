A panel of medical experts tells Congress, prenatal AIDS tests should 
be given to all pregnant women. The institute of medicine says women 
should be tested automatically, as they are for several other diseases. 
The panel says women must have the right to refuse the tests. Several 
medical organizations say the tests are impractical, partly because 
of the frequency of falsely positive results. They say women should 
be given HIV counseling before any such test.
