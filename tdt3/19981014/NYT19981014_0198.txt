There's very little reason to tour Silicon Valley, but if you do end 
up there, you can get a flavor for the place without trying to sneak 
into Sun Microsystems. Jan English-Lueck, who studies the culture 
of Silicon Valley as a San Jose State University anthropology professor, 
recommended going to Fry's Electronics. ``You can see real Silicon 
Valley people talking about chips,'' she said. Another place where 
tourists can spot guys with pocket protectors getting into their Porsche 
Boxters: Faultline Brewing Co., a Sunnyvale-based microbrewery, is 
an after-work watering hole for engineers at Amdahl, 3Com, Hewlett-Packard, 
Sony and other companies. Laser tag, an activity where you shoot laser 
beams at your co-workers, has become the sport of nerds, so you'll 
find a lot of software engineers playing the game at the laser tag 
clubs in the area. The world's next millionaires eat lunch and make 
deals at Buck's in Woodside, an area that is populated with high-tech 
executives, sort of the Beverly Hills of high tech. For dinner the 
geek chic go to Il Fornaio in Palo Alto. ``It's fun to watch the waitresses 
flirt with stock-optioned nerds,'' said Sally Atkins, a high-tech 
consultant in Boston who frequently travels to Silicon Valley. For 
more conventional looks at technology, try the Intel Museum (www.intel.com/intel/intelis/museum); 
or the Hewlett-Packard Garage (www.hp.com/abouthp/hpgarage.html), 
the one-car garage in Palo Alto where Bill Hewlett and Dave Packard 
started their business, or the Tech Museum in San Jose (www.thetech.org), 
due to reopen Oct. 31.
