Congressional leaders revived legislation Tuesday that would nearly 
double the number of employment visas available for skilled foreign 
workers. The measure, which is sought by high-technology industries, 
appeared dead on Friday night, but budget negotiators agreed Tuesday 
to include it in the omnibus spending bill that Congress is trying 
to finish this week so it can adjourn. ``This is a big victory for 
the economy, which is being fueled in large part by our high-tech 
industries,'' said the author of the legislation, Sen. Spencer Abraham, 
R-Mich. ``The legislation strikes the right balance in safeguarding 
America's competitive edge and protecting U.S. jobs.'' The final proposal 
represents a hard-fought compromise with the White House, which had 
opposed Abraham's original measure because of concerns that it lacked 
proper protections for American workers. Silicon Valley companies 
have pushed hard for the visa legislation, contending that they cannot 
find enough skilled Americans to fill crucial jobs. The industry won 
another victory Tuesday with the passage of the Securities Litigation 
Uniform Standards Act, which is intended to protect technology and 
other start-up companies from lawsuits in state courts over stock 
price fluctuations. The compromise measure, now endorsed by both houses 
of Congress, imposes a single national standard for such suits. The 
legislation to increase the number of so-called H1-B work visas, a 
result of months of wrangling with the White House, appeared to have 
been killed on Friday night after Sen. Tom Harkin, D-Iowa, questioned 
the validity of the high-technology industries' claims of worker shortages 
and blocked a final vote. The final version increases from 65,000 
to 115,000 the number of H1-B visas available in each of the next 
two years and sets the number at 107,500 in the third year. It requires 
that if 15 percent or more of a company's work force consists of employees 
on H1-B visas, it must attest that they have not replaced American 
workers. Companies hiring H1-B workers with master's degrees or higher 
or at salaries of $60,000 or more would be exempt from that requirement. 
There are also special exemptions for small businesses and start-up 
companies. The legislation also authorizes the Labor Department to 
investigate suspected abuses of the program and imposes a $500 filing 
fee on visa applications and renewals. The more than $75 million raised 
by these fees would be used for training and scholarship programs 
for U.S. citizens.
