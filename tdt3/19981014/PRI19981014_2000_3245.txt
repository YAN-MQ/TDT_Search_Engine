At some point during his 28 years on planet earth, Jake Wherry, writer 
and producer for a British band known as the Herbalizer, realized 
that there was something compellingly funky in the music of film composer 
Lalo Schriffrin. I think he is quite an authentic and original sounding 
composer. Schiffren was famous for his work on themes like Mission 
Impossible and Dirty Harry. Wherry, along with his fellow Herbalizers 
and an eight piece band used the much imitated themes as their starting 
points. suspenseful soundtracks for heavy drums and that wouldn't 
have been sampled by many hip hopper chasers. Lalo Schiffrin is very 
versatile. And this is what comes out of the Herbalizer machine. Yes, 
it is kind of monotonous. That track, Ginger Jumps the Fence, basically 
does the same thing for about five minutes. But if you think this 
beat is just for dancing, you better think again says Herbalizer producer, 
Jake Wherry. We can play. We've played at as well in London which 
is a tradition of sit-down jazz place and we've had people dancing 
there and we've played, you know, really dark, funk clubs and we play 
a lot of different places, places if you're into jazz and funk or 
hip hop or even alternative rock, progressive rock, you know, you'll 
enjoy the show. You might call the music of the Herbalizer derivative 
but then that's the whole point. Producer Jake Wherry. We're doing 
music that's been around for 20 years and sort of you can hear it. 
You know, very inspired by stuff that was happening in '79, '80 like 
Sugar Hill Gang and the really old school stuff. Jazz has always been 
an exciting music and good jazz has always been sort of on the boundary 
and there's been jazz funk and jazz rock and jazz fusion and Brazilian 
jazz and so many different forms and, you know, we're just using music 
inspired by jazz and doing the right thing with it. The Herbalizer's 
own thing is a definite hit on the British club circuit. Right now, 
the band's ruminating on a handful of October and November gigs in 
the States with a longer tour in the works for next year. For The 
World, this is Marco Werman. Music from London's Herbalizer brings 
this edition of the program to a close. You can catch our act online 
after closing time anytime. That's www.theworld.org. In Boston, I'm 
Tony Kahn, inviting you to join us again tomorrow for another spin 
of The World.
