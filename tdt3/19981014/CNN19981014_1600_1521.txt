You might not find them at your local multiplex, but some new independent 
films may be worth checking out. Janine sharell previews some of them. 
They don't get the attention lavished upon big-screen movies. Small 
independent films are usually a labor of love. There are some new 
entries that, although they feature kids, are made for grownups. Mom, 
do you think I was switched with another baby at the hospital? No 
way, sweet pea. How do the astronauts go to the bathroom? Honey, you 
don't want to know. Gwen, are wives immediate family? Sure. Evan Rachel 
wood plays the inquisitive Harriet in "digging to China" -- a 10-year-old 
who befriends a mentally retarded 30-year-old, played by Kevin bacon. 
Behind the scenes, Timothy Hutton calls the shots. Everyone responded 
to this very clean story about these people and how they could not 
connect with one another and a feeling of being trapped and feeling 
like an outsider. Wood gives a big thumbs-up to Hutton's directorial 
debut and his style. He treats me like an actor. He doesn't treat 
me like a 3-year-old. You know, I've had that experience. Some directors 
go, "okay, Evan, you're just going to walk over here. Oh, you're so 
cute." You know, I hate that. He says he walked from Alabama. Alabama? 
That's near 'bout 600 miles. Imagine that. He is shadrach, a 99-year-old 
ex-slave who travels to Virginia to be buried with his family. John 
Franklin Sawyer plays the title role. In real life, he's only 84, 
and this is his acting debut. Praise the lord, I has arrived in old 
Virginia. Harvey Keitel and Andie MacDowell play man and wife and 
shadrach's last hope. My kids just -- this is the favorite film they've 
ever seen me do, because they really could understand what it was 
saying, not only about color and who people are, but also about death. 
Why don't we do some boogie-woogie. Jeff falcon stars in "six-string 
Samurai," which was made on a shoestring, thanks to film donations, 
favors and actors willing to work for next to nothing in less-than-favorable 
conditions. The film was shot in the heart of Death Valley. 120-degree 
heat, and I'm wearing a suit out there and carting around a hollow-body 
six-string guitar and a Samurai sword out in the middle of the sand 
dunes. "six-string Samurai," "shadrach" and "digging to China" are 
now playing in limited release. Janine sharell, "CNN Entertainment 
News," Hollywood.
