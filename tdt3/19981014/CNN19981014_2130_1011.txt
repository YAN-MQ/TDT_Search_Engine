Some airline passengers will have a little longer to use their frequent 
flier miles. Stephanie Oswald has that and other travel news in this 
edition of "working ahead." a number of airlines are giving frequent 
fliers a little more time to cash in their miles. Delta is pushing 
back the expiration date for older, unclaimed miles to the end of 
1999. At united, some miles will expire this December 31st, but not 
nearly as many as first planned. And due to the recent strike at northwest, 
miles set to expire at the end of this year will now be good for another 
365 days. The department of transportation says all 13 major U.S. 
airlines reported an operating profit for the second quarter of 1998. 
Combined, it adds up to $3 billion. Much of the increase can be traced 
to lower fuel prices. And if you think summer is the best time for 
vacations, guess again. According to a recent survey, bookings for 
fall getaways are up almost 40% compared to last year's statistics. 
Orlando, Las Vegas and New York are the top U.S. destinations. Internationally, 
London, Paris and Rome are the cities of choice. Lower airfares, fewer 
crowds and fall's rich colors are prompting travelers to book trips.
