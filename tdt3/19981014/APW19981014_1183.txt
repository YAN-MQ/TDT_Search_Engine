After two consecutive victories in European qualifying matches, Turkey 
slumped Wednesday to a 3-1 loss to Finland at Istanbul. Finland surprised 
the Turks with speedy attacks in the opening stages of each half which 
unsettled the Turkish defense for the remainder of the match. Finland 
opened the scoring in the 5th minute when Mika-Matti Paatelained connected 
with a Tommi Kautonen corner and headed into the net. On a rain-drenched 
field, Turkey's forwards were unable to break through the tightly 
Finnish defense throughout the first half. Heavily marked striker 
Hakan Sukur missed a chance to equalize the score as his powerful 
strike landed right of the post. Turkey began the second half with 
a series of attacks but Finland scored a counter-attacking goal in 
the 51st minute through Jonatan Johanson. Relentless attacking raids, 
Ogun Temizkanoglu scored Turkey's goal with a powerful kick from outside 
the penalty area. Finland forward Jari Litmanen clinched victory when 
he scored the third goal deep into injury time. On Saturday, Turkey 
scored the upset of the round by beating defending European champions, 
Germany, while Finland lost to Northern Ireland. Lineups: Turkey: 
Rustu Rencber; Alpay Ozalan, Tayfur Havutcu, Okan Buruk, Fatih Akyet,
