Evander Holyfield and Lennox Lewis have agreed verbally to meet in 
a heavyweight title unification bout. Only their signatures are needed 
to close the deal. The fight was brokered earlier this week by both 
camps. The fighters are tentatively scheduled to fight in February 
or March. The venue will almost certainly be Las Vegas.
