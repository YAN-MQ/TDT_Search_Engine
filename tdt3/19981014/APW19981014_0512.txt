More than 73 people were killed when an overloaded ferry sank in a 
river in the northern state of Kaduna, a state-owned newspaper said 
Wednesday. The boat capsized after being blown about by a storm on 
the Katarma River near the village of Chikun, the Daily Times newspaper 
said. It did not say when the incident occurred. Local government 
officials said the death toll was believed to be higher than 73, as 
some people who had initially survived the incident had died later 
at an area hospital. River ferries, often old, in complete disrepair 
and overcrowded, ply the inland waters of Nigeria. Accidents are common. 
Last week, 57 people drowned when a ferry capsized on the northern 
Kaduna River.
