A regional governor in Siberia has donated six tons of potatoes grown 
on his own farm to orphanages, the ITAR-Tass news agency said Wednesday. 
The potatoes were grown on land leased to Kemerovo Gov. Aman Tuleyev, 
like 3,800 other residents of the Kuzbass coal-mining region who supported 
a local initiative to cultivate land that was not being used for agriculture 
purposes. The governor did not have time to work the land himself, 
so he was helped by workers from a neighboring experimental farm, 
ITAR-Tass said. He donated his harvest to orphanages in the towns 
of Anzhero- Sudzhensk and Berezovsky, it said.
