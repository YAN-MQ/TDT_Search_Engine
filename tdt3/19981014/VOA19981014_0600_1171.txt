Major League Baseball Playoffs action continues today in Atlanta with 
game number six of the National League Championship Series between 
the Braves and the San Diego Padres. The Padres were just five outs 
from reaching the world's series for the first time in fourteen years 
on Monday before the Braves unleashed a five-run rally and held on 
for a 7-6 win in San Diego. The Padres still lead the series 3 games 
to 2 but now face the return trip to Atlanta. The Braves are trying 
to become the first team in history to overcome a 3-0 deficient in 
the playoffs.
