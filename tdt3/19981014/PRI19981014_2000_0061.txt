National Public Radio has learned that Kenneth Starr consulted with 
lawyers for Paula Jones as many as a half dozen times before he became 
the independent counsel investigation President Clinton's role in 
the Whitewater case. According to the Justice Department, Starr failed 
to disclose his role to Attorney General Janet Reno when he asked 
for authority to expand his investigation to include the Monica Lewinsky 
case in January. Gilbert Davis, the lawyer who represented Jones, 
told NPR's Nina Totenberg that he sought out Starr for advice when 
he was developing the Jones' argument on presidential immunity. Legal 
ethics experts say that Starr's involvement with the case wouldn't 
have automatically disqualified him from taking on the Lewinsky investigation 
but that he should have informed the court and the attorney general 
about that involvement.
