Kenneth Jernigan, who was a forceful advocate for the blind in gaining 
access to jobs and to public places during his longtime leadership 
of the National Federation of the Blind, died Oct. 12 at his home 
in Baltimore. He was 71. The cause was lung cancer, said Barbara Pierce, 
director of public education for the federation and editor of its 
Braille Monitor magazine. The current president of the federation, 
Marc Maurer, said Jernigan ``has reshaped thinking about the blind 
in this country and his writings have been translated into 100 languages.'' 
Jernigan, who was blind at birth, started volunteering for the federation, 
based in Baltimore, in 1951 and was president of the organization 
from 1968 to 1986. During his unpaid tenure, the federation, which 
was founded in 1940 by Jacobus tenBroek, became one of the nation's 
most influential advocacy organizations. Jernigan was in the vanguard 
of a successful effort in the 1980s to persuade the State Department 
to revise its policy excluding unsighted people from the diplomatic 
service. He was also instrumental in litigation that sought to stop 
what the federation regarded as discriminatory practices among airlines 
in the accommodation of the blind, one of which was that the airlines 
did not want them sitting in rows near emergency exits. Jernigan appeared 
before a Senate subcommittee in 1989 and showed a video demonstrating 
that sighted and blind people could make an orderly evacuation of 
aircraft with equal ease. ``The real problem of blindness is not the 
loss of eyesight,'' he said in 1992. ``The real problem is the misunderstanding 
and lack of information which exist. If a blind person has proper 
training and opportunity, blindness can be reduced to the level of 
a physical nuisance.'' Over the years, he made it clear that he took 
exception to various statements he heard about blindness, which included 
the suggestion that true Christians never lost their sight and that 
blind people were not equal to sighted people because of their ``inability 
to see atoms.'' He called such statements ``gibbering insanity.'' 
Above all, he loathed expressions of pity for the blind, who, he maintained, 
did not want pity and were quite capable of taking care of themselves 
and competing with sighted people in the job market. Among his accomplishments 
was the creation of the Newsline for the Blind Network, in which the 
daily reports of The New York Times, The Washington Post and other 
major American newspapers are scanned and recited by a computer voice 
over telephone lines available to blind people all over the country. 
Jernigan also created the International Braille and Technology Center 
in Baltimore, which researches and promotes technology to aid the 
blind and maintains a job information bank for the blind that can 
be accessed by telephone. In recognition of his work in creating the 
Newsline for the Blind Network, Jernigan received the Winston Gordon 
Award for Technological Advancement in the Field of Blindness and 
Visual Impairment this year from the Canadian National Institute for 
the Blind. Among his many other awards was a citation from the American 
Library Association in 1967 that praised him for his efforts in making 
the contents of libraries available to the blind. Kenneth Jernigan 
was born in Detroit on Nov. 13, 1926. When he was quite young, his 
parents, Jesse and Novella Inez Trail Jernigan, moved near Beech Grove, 
Tenn., where they were farmers. Their son was educated at the Tennessee 
School for the Blind in Nashville. After high school, he ran a furniture 
store in Beech Grove for a time, but then went on to college, earning 
his bachelor's degree from Tennessee Technological University in Cookeville, 
where he majored in social sciences. He originally wanted to be a 
lawyer, but his college counselor told him that without sight, he 
should seek a more realistic goal. In that era, many blind people 
were shunted off into such jobs as piano tuning or teaching the blind. 
He decided to become a teacher and got his master's degree in English 
from Peabody College in Nashville in 1949. There he became active 
in the Tennessee chapter of the National Federation of the Blind. 
He then went to California and taught at the California Training Center 
for the Blind in Oakland from 1953 to 1958. In 1958, he became director 
of the Iowa Commission for the Blind, which he reorganized and strengthened. 
He remained in that post until 1978, running the federation as a volunteer 
at the same time. Then he moved on to Baltimore and became the paid 
executive director of the American Action Fund for Blind Children 
and Adults, a sister organization of the National Federation of the 
Blind. He held that post from 1978 to 1989. His other activities included 
work for the National Advisory Committee on Services for the Blind 
and Visually Handicapped; special consultant to the executive director 
of the White House Conference on the Handicapped, and consultant to 
the Smithsonian Institution, advising on museum programs for blind 
visitors. In retirement, he continued to write essays and booklets, 
many of them of an inspirational nature, that were widely distributed 
to sightless people all over the world. Among Jernigan's survivors 
are his wife, the former Mary Ellen Osborn, who assisted him in his 
work for the federation; a daughter from a previous marriage, Marie 
Antoinette Jernigan Cobb of Baltimore, and three grandchildren.
