Few places have been harder hit in recent weeks than American investment 
houses with giants like Merrill Lynch, the largest security firm posting 
a 3rd quarter loss of $164 million. It's first loss since 1989 after 
cutting 3,400 jobs. Raphael Sulver an analyst with Brown Brothers 
was asked if the worse was now behind with such brokerage firms. Well, 
we're not really concerned with what happens in the market in the 
4th quarter because, um, brokerage firms are very much creatures of 
-- of the market. I think, though, that, uh, unless we have another 
big disaster in an merging market someplace, that, uh, we've probably 
seen the worse as far as the in the 3rd quarter. So, my in the 4th 
quarter is that earnings will be rather weak relative to what we saw 
in the 1st half of the year but probably somewhat better than -- than 
these.
