Afghanistan's ruling hard-line Taliban militia accused its powerful 
western neighbor Iran on Wednesday of ``brazen interference'' and 
asked the United Nations in a letter to exert pressure to prevent 
war between the two countries. Taliban's foreign minister Maulvi Mohammed 
Hasan sent the letter to U.N. Secretary-General Kofi Annan who sent 
his special envoy, Lakhdar Brahimi, to southern Kandahar to meet the 
reclusive leader of the Islamic Taliban militia. Annan exempted Brahimi 
from a travel ban to Afghanistan to allow him to meet Mullah Mohammed 
Omar on Wednesday to try to defuse border tensions between Iran and 
the Taliban. Hasan said Iran continuously sends weapons to the Taliban's 
minority opposition _ actions that hamper international efforts to 
find a peaceful end to the standoff between Iran and the Taliban. 
On Saturday, Kyrgyztan authorities stopped a train in the southern 
town of Osh which was carrying weapons and explosives hidden in a 
shipment marked humanitarian aid from Iran. Kyrgyz officials said 
Tehran did not have permission to send the weapons to Afghanistan 
across its territory. Kyrgyz officials allege the weapons were to 
be loaded onto trucks and driven to Afghanistan, where they would 
be delivered to opposition leader Ahmed Shah Masood's militia. The 
weapons included anti-tank mines, grenades, ammunition for large-caliber 
machine guns, mines shells for 122 mm artillery guns and rocket launchers, 
Russian Intermix news agency said Tuesday. Hasan said Iran is the 
main source of weapons to the anti-Taliban opposition, which is creating 
devastation, destruction and loss of human lives in Afghanistan. Iran 
has amassed more than 200,000 troops on its frontier with Afghanistan 
after the killing of its diplomats and a journalist by Taliban fighters 
when they captured the northern city of Mazar-e-Sharif in August. 
The Taliban, which also sent a similar letter to the Organization 
of Islamic Conference, said Iran was using the issue of the killing 
of its diplomats as a pretext to interfere in Afghanistan. The Taliban 
say the slain Iranians were not diplomats, but military personnel.
