It's Wednesday, October 14th. I'm Tony Kahn. Today, it's officially 
just an informal get together but high level talks between China and 
Taiwan are raising hopes for relaxing tensions between the rivals. 
And with NATO monitoring events in Kosovo, a Serbian priest in the 
providence calls this week's agreement with Slobodan Milosevic a final 
exam. This is the exam for Europe and the world, whether we are going 
to go further away to the 21st century or go back to the Dark Ages. 
First, this news. From National Public Radio News in Washington, I'm 
Corey Flintoff.
