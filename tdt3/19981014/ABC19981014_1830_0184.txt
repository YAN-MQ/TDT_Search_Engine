On many college campuses tonight, not to mention in the general population, 
thousands, if not millions, of people are being asked to reconsider 
the meaning and definition of a hate crime. The 21-year-old gay University 
student who was savagely beaten and left to die outside laramie, Wyoming, 
last week. Tonight an hour away in fort Collins, Colorado, home of 
another college campus, the debate is particularly intense. ABC's 
Lisa Salters reports from Colorado state University. What has grabbed 
people's attention here is a float in last weekend's home coming parade. 
While Matthew shepard lay dying, the float future yeared a scare crow 
with the words I'm gay written on it. People were gasping. They would 
hide their eyes from it. To many, it was a painful reminder of how 
shepard died, of how he was pistol whipped and tied to a wooden fence. 
Though students at Colorado state University are outraged by the incident, 
violence motivated by bias on college campuses across the country 
is growing. The number of hate groups was up about 20% just last year 
and the level of propaganda, the sort of hate noise out there is very 
high. Particularly, on the Internet. You cannot believe how ecstatic 
I feel that another one of you disgusting gays is dead. They have 
been receiving computer messages like that one since shepard's death. 
It makes me feel angry, scared because we don't know what they will 
do next. a Kansas preacher says he will lead a protest Friday during 
shepard's funeral in Wyoming. The debate hasn't even started and extraordinary 
means like picketing at funerals seems to be turning that around and 
getting at least a little bit of attention. Many students at Colorado 
state say they don't mind the debate, but they want the hate and violence 
to stop. Lisa Salters, ABC News, fort Collins, Colorado.
