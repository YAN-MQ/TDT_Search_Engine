Many women take over the counter painkillers to cope with the symptoms 
of premenstrual syndrome. But scientists say there may be a natural 
alternative -- calcium. They studied more than 400 premenopausal women. 
Within three months, there was a 50% reductions of symptoms. Symptoms 
such as mood swings, tension, headaches, cramping, were all alleviated 
with calcium. Also, food cravings associated with PMS were cut in 
half, and water retention dropped by more than a third. Researchers 
don't know exactly how calcium reduces the physical and psychological 
symptoms of PMS. But they have discovered another link -- PMS may 
be an early warning sign for osteoporosis, the brittle bone condition 
that affects millions of women, especially after menopause. Experts 
say that could mean PMS is a sign of calcium deficiency. They recommend 
consuming 1,000 milligrams of calcium, or three to four glasses of 
milk, every day. If you have premenstrual symptoms you should see 
an effect within two to three months.
