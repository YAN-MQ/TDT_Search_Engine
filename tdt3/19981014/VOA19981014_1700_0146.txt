President Clinton brings Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu-- 
Netanyahu and Palestinian Leader Yassir Arrafat together Thursday. 
The aim is to clear the way for talks on final status issues of the 
Middle East peace process. VOA's David Gullis reports from the White 
House. After a ceremonial greeting at the White House, the two leaders 
will go the seclude Wye Plantation, east of Washington for an effort 
to break the long negotiating impasse that has put the May 1999 target 
for an overall settlement in jeopardy. Secretary of State Albright 
and Middle East Troubleshooter Denis Ross will be with them to try 
to facilitate the effort to remove obstacles to an interim deal for 
another Israeli troop withdrawal in the West Bank tied to Palestinian 
security guarantees. But, White House Spokesman Joe Lockhart says 
US mediation by itself cannot bring an agreement. It is to the parties 
to make peace. The US cannot impose the peace. The parties must make 
a peace that they believe is in their interest. President Clinton 
will spend Thursday evening at the Wye Plantation and will be available 
to join the talks over the weekend if the situation warrants David 
Gullis, VOA News, The White House.
