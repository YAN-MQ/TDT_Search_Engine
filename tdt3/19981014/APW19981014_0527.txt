Prolonging Mongolia's political crisis, the president on Wednesday 
again rejected Davaadorjiin Ganbold's candidacy for prime minister. 
President Natsagiin Bagabandi asked Mongolia's acting coalition government 
to propose another prime ministerial candidate. The president, a member 
of the formerly communist Mongolian People's Revolutionary Party, 
already had rejected Ganbold's candidacy six times in August. The 
president turned down the 41-year-old Moscow-educated economist because 
Ganbold backed the privatization of a state-owned bank. The bank's 
privatization triggered the poor Asian nation's political crisis four 
months ago, rendering its government ineffective. Opposition legislators 
claimed government politicians benefited financially from the privatization, 
and boycotted parliament in protest. The boycott ended only with the 
July 24 resignation of acting Prime Minister Tsakhiagiin Elbegdorj 
after losing a no confidence vote. Since then, Elbegdorj and his ministers 
have remained in their posts in an acting capacity, a role that observers 
say has led to increased corruption and slowed legislation. Opposition 
leader N. Enkhbayar accused the government of deliberately prolonging 
the crisis. ``They are just playing a game to stay in power longer 
as acting ministers,'' he said. Enkhbayar has called for the dissolution 
of parliament and for early elections. Apart from Ganbold, President 
Bagabandi has also rejected two other nominations submitted by the 
ruling coalition. A third candidate, Amarjargal, was approved by the 
president only to lose a parliamentary election by one vote.
