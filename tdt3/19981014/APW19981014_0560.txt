Reeling from the recent collapse of three commericial banks, the Central 
Bank of Uganda is instituting measures meant to more closely monitor 
the operations of financial instituions, a bank official said Wednesday. 
``Bank of Uganda will impose tighter regulations on banks. The new 
measures will be tough on the issue of collecting people's money and 
lending it to them,'' said CBU executive director for supervision 
Edward Mugwanya. Mugwanya said the central bank will start auditing 
books of commercial banks several times every year and will also put 
an end to the practice of bank owners extending loans to themselves, 
something which contributed to fall of one closed bank. An audit of 
the International Credit Bank published by the central bank indicated 
that 45 percent of the bank's total loan portfolio of 4 billion shillings 
(dlrs 4 million) was in so-called insider loans granted to management. 
``No interest was being charged on the insider loans, and they were 
non-peerforming. This in itself was a breach of the statute,'' a statement 
from the central bank said. ``The bank was therefore not being managed 
in the interests of its depositors.'' Uganda has 21 commercial banks, 
half of them foreign-owned. Many have sprouted in recent years following 
a liberalization program pushed by donors and international lending 
institutions. ``The Central Bank of Uganda must ensure the safety 
of banking institutions. Efforts must be made to ensure that the banking 
sector is sound,'' CBU public relations director Walugembe Musoke 
said at a joint news conference with Mugwanya.
