The White House is dismissing Illinois republican Henry Hyde's suggestion 
of streamlining the impeachment allegations against President Clinton. 
The house Judiciary committee chairman says he may have to boil down 
the 15 allegations listed by the majority's lead attorney if he's 
to meet his end of the year deadline to complete the inquiry. Hyde 
says he wants to concentrate on the core allegations -- lying under 
oath, obstruction of justice. The White House says Hyde is probably 
motivated by politics.
