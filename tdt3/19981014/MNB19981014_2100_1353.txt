Today the federal justice department announced that Eric Robert Rudolph 
has been charged with the 1996 Olympic park bombing and two other 
bombings in Atlanta and released a new photo of Rudolph, how they 
think he might have looked at the time of the Olympic park bombing. 
He has managed to elude search teams for nine months. The feds say 
a lot of their case is based chiefly on new evidence. The same kind 
of gunpowder used to make the Olympic park bomb was found in Rudolph's 
pozzions in North Carolina. The investigation is still ongoing. Rudolph 
was already charged with bombing a Birmingham abortion clinic last 
January.
