Serbs living in the United States are viewing the situation in Kosovo 
with mixed emotions. They're against U.S.-led forces bombing their 
Homeland. Jeff flock reports. He is mad at the United States. It is 
an act of aggression. He is mad at the western media. The footage, 
that you are showing is very, very one-sided. She is mad at the people 
who took her home. People who don't have any right to be there are 
there, living in my home. In the largest Serbian enclave in the U.S. 
And especially those that live in Kosovo. They pray for peace -- I 
try not to mix politics with faith. but fr. Milos vesin of archangel 
Michael church outside Chicago says he must preach the truth. The 
truth is that Kosovo is the cradle of the Serbian culture. "Kosovo 
must not be lost," they say on the only daily Serbian language radio 
program in the U.S. it is hosted by a man who knows loss. Forced from 
his home in Sarajevo in the war. This is his daughter. I don't want 
to put anybody down but yet, I was kicked out of my Homeland and did 
not have really any choice. At the simplon orient express restaurant, 
they support Serbia, but not President Milosevic -- He is a bad person 
for Yugoslavia. He is bad for Serbians. He is bad for Kosovo. But 
they agree with Milosevic on one point -- they see Albanians in Kosovo 
the same way the north saw the south in the U.S. civil war. And he 
began firing and killing policemen. And perhaps the U.N. response 
has been drastic. Maybe that is so. Still the thought that their adopted 
country could bomb their Homeland is hard to take. Your big guns will 
kill a whole bunch of us but a whole bunch of us will stay there. 
And it will be our land. We have no place to go. That's our land. 
Beliefs held as strongly by Serbians here as well as there. I'm Jeff 
flock, CNN, in Chicago.
