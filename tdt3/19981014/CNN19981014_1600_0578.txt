The Middle East summit gets under way in Washington tomorrow. Israeli 
prime minister Benjamin Netanyahu and Palestinian leader Yasser Arafat 
are scheduled to hold talks with President Clinton at the White House. 
Then they will head to the wye plantation in Maryland. Netanyahu was 
in Jordan today for talks with crown prince Hassan. He says the summit 
could succeed if Arafat meets Israel's demands to clamp down on militants. 
Arafat says he's optimistic the summit will produce results. It will 
focus on security issues and the next stage of Israel's withdrawal 
from the West Bank.
