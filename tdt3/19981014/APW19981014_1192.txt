Henning Berg scored on a header with three minutes remaining Wednesday 
and Norway rallied from a two-goal deficit in the final 10 minutes 
to get a 2-2 draw with soccer minnow Albania in European Championship 
qualifying. It was the second major shock at home in little over a 
month for Norway, which fell to Latvia 3-1 on Sept. 6 in Ullevall 
Stadium. Until the Latvia game, Norway had not lost at Ullevall in 
the 1990s. Albania took the lead eight minutes before halftime when 
Alban Bushi capitalized on a poor clearance by Norwegian goalkeeper 
Frode Grodas to score. The crowd of 17,770 jeered the Drillos as they 
left the field for halftime and intensivied six minutes into the second 
half when Albania doubled its lead. Altin Haxhi passed on to Albanian 
forward Igli Tare, who made it 2-0. Norway moved one of its midfielders 
forward ten minutes into the second half to join Tore Andre Flo, but 
it took another 25 before it finally paid off. Tare was called for 
grabbing the jersey of Ole Gunnar Solskjaer jersey in the 80th minute, 
and Kjetil Rekdal converted the penalty. Henning equalized with a 
header after a corner kick from Stig Inge Bjorneby. ``We played excellent 
in the last 35 minutes of the game, but it was not enough. The first 
half was terrible, and we had to use a new formation in the second 
half,'' Norwegian coach Nils Johan Semb said. ___ Lineups Norway:
