Zvonimir Boban scored twice as Croatia rallied to a 3-2 victory over 
a resilient Macedonia on Wednesday in a Group 8 qualifying match for 
the 2000 European Championship. Sasa Ciric stunned the home crowd 
when he rose between two defenders to head the Macedonians into the 
lead in the opening minute of play. But World Cup top scorer Davor 
Suker tied for the Croats in the 16th minute with another header from 
close range and captain Boban gained the lead on the stroke of halftime 
with a well-connected volley on an awkward angle. Refusing to buckle 
under pressure, Macedonia opened further, hoping to coax the Croats 
into taking greater risks. The strategy paid off in the 55th minute 
when Macedonia won a free-kick just outside the box. Dzevdet Sainovski 
smacked the ball low and hard through the wall and past stranded goalie 
Drazen Ladic into the net. Boban sealed victory in the 70th minute 
for Croatia when he splendidly directed a curling free-kick from more 
than 20 meters (yard) inside the top-right post. The win against Macedonia, 
and Malta on Saturday, keeps the Croats in the running for a spot 
in Euro 2000. Croatia won third place in the World Cup last summer, 
but it got off to a rocky start in its opener, losing to the Republic 
of Ireland 2-0. Ladic, Croatia's most capped player with 51 appearances, 
played his last game before retirement from international soccer.
