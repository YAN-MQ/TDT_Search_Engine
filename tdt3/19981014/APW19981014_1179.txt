Top-ranked Pate Sampras needed three sets to beat Jeff Tarango on 
Wednesday to reach the quarterfinals the dlrs 800,000 CA Trophy ATP 
indoor tournament. Sampras rallied for a 5-7, 6-1, 6-3 victory over 
the fellow American, a qualifier. Patrick Rafter kept up the chase 
for Sampras' No. 1 ranking by beating Byron Black 6-3, 7-6 (7-3) in 
a first-round match. Rafter, the U.S. Open champion, is No. 2 and 
has a chance of replacing Sampras as the top-ranked player in the 
world in the coming weeks. While Rafter advanced, third-seed Carlos 
Moya, the French Open champion, was upset by Bohdan Ulihrach, 7-6 
(8-6), 6-4. Eighth-seeded Tim Henman advanced by beating Magnus Gustafsson 
6-3, 6-4, and will clash with Sampras in the quarterfinals. Rafter 
used one break of serve to win the first set. In the second, Rafter 
fought back from a break down and saved four set points to hold serve 
for 6-6. The Australian used his powerful serve-and-volley game to 
win the tiebreaker. Rafter leads the tour with six titles this year. 
Henman, coming off back-to-back titles in Tashkent and Basel, celebrated 
his 18th win in the last 21 matches despite fighting a cold at the 
start of the week. The Briton is on pace to reach the eight-man ATP 
Tour World Championship next month in Hanover, Germany. Moya blew 
a 4-1 lead in the first set and two set points in the tiebreaker. 
In the second, he fought back from a 4-1 deficit, but double-faulted 
to give Ulihrach the match.
