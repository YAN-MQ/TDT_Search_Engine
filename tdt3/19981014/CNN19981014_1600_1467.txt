Roseanne and former husband Tom Arnold are talking about talking. 
Dennis Michael explains. This is Dennis Michael with the "Hollywood 
Minute." Reconciliation, even for sweeps, apparently isn't in the 
cards yet for Tom Arnold and roseanne. The former married couple, 
who haven't spoken to each other since meeting in court in 1994, were 
reportedly planning to reconcile in a "roseanne" talk show with the 
theme of forgiveness scheduled for November. Now, "daily variety" 
reports Arnold won't be available due to scheduling conflicts and 
that the roseanne camp may have withdrawn the invitation.
