Japan's benchmark Stock Index closed down today 172 points to 13,071 
about 1.3 percent, facing losses throughout most of Asia. Investors 
appear to be waiting for details on the government's new banking sector 
rescue package. Japan's top economic advisory council today urged 
Prime Minister Kazo public funds in a banks and in huge stimulus spending. 
In a report to the prime minister, the economic strategy council called 
for several tens of trillions of yen over 3 years to identify those 
banks deemed viable. Dave Roberts, head of a merging market solvent 
research for Nationsbank Montgomery Securities says Financial Sector 
Help news just the first step on a road to recovery in Japan. The 
other piece that we're waiting for from Japan is, uh, implementation 
of the physical stimulus package, uh, that again, uh, had been long 
promised, uh, to be put in place by now and, uh, the results have 
been very slow in coming. So, you have to get a physical stimulus 
as well in Japan to get the economy off its' bottom. Japan's Central 
Bank's figures, meanwhile, shows Japanese banks loaned less in September 
as companies cut back in investment and new factory equipment. Average 
loans fell nearly 3 percent, the biggest drop since the Bank of Japan 
kept records dating back to 1991.
