In another blow to the struggling Royal Opera House, its music director, 
Bernard Haitink, has handed in his resignation to protest the opera 
house's decision to cancel its 1999 season. But 69-year-old Haitink, 
who has held the job for 11 years, has not quite left, and it remains 
unclear whether he will follow through. ``He has said he will withdraw 
his resignation only if some sort of orchestral program can be reinstated 
next season,'' said a spokeswoman for the opera house. ``Discussions 
are taking place.'' Haitink, who made his announcement over the weekend, 
has written to Culture Secretary Chris Smith asking him to intervene. 
Haitink has not received a reply, but the spokeswoman said that Smith 
had said Monday that the plan to shut down the opera house for a year, 
a last-ditch money-saving measure, had not changed. Smith told Reuters 
that the plan had been agreed upon by the government, the Arts Council 
and the opera house board to tackle the problems caused by financial 
mismanagement.'' The opera house, which has teetered on the edge of 
bankruptcy several times in the last year, is saddled with a $22 million 
budget deficit. In an interview with The Sunday Times of London, Haitink 
said that the closing would have a ``lethal'' effect on the orchestra 
and that he would not be able to take responsibility for its condition 
afterward. He added he was furious that he had been informed of the 
plan to cancel the season by a fax saying, ``Maybe you will be interested 
in this.'' He said: ``I was flabbergasted. Imagine! I was not consulted.''
