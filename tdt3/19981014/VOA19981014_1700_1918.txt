Taliban leaders have told UN Special Envoy Lactar Brehimi that they 
will release all Iranian prisoners. Two Western news agency report 
an exchange of captives with Iran is part of the deal, but no other 
details are available. The announcement followed several hours of 
talks Wednesday at Taliban headquarters in Konderhar, Afghanistan. 
Mr. Brehimi said he though tensions along the Afghan/Iranian border 
have eased. I think that we have taken an important step forward in 
our common effort to diffuse the tension on the Iran/Afghanistan border. 
Tensions between Iran and Afghanistan flared in August after the murder 
of eight Iranian diplomats and a journalist by Taliban soldiers.
