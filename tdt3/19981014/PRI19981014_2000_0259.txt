Corporations reported their third quarter earnings today. As NPR's 
Kathleen Shalk reports, the picture was mixed. After months of sluggish 
sales, the personal computer industry may be making a comeback. Compaq 
Computer's revenue shot up 36 percent. Apple reported bigger than 
expected profits and posted its first annual profit in five years. 
And yesterday, Intel reported that its revenue rose nine percent. 
There were also some big losers. The Wall Street firm, Bear Sterns, 
saw its earnings tumble 60 percent. Bank America's operating income 
plummeted 50 percent. Investment banking revenue has fallen, along 
with trade and underwriting, because of global economic turmoil and 
costs have soared as banks have had to write down bad loans and investments 
and build up reserves as a cushion against future uncertainty. Pfizer 
Incorporated earnings rose a disappointing 13 percent, in part due 
to weaker than expected demand for the impotence drug Viagra. Kathleen 
Shalk, NPR News, Washington.
