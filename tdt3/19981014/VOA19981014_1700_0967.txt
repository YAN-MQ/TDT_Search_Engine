Meanwhile, the White House and the Republican-led Congress are still 
at odds over billion dollar issues in the federal budget requiring 
another temporary spending bill to keep the government opened. VOA's 
David Swann tells us the House and the Senate have now passed the 
measure. With budget negotiations dragging on and a midnight deadline 
approaching, Congress once again moved to prevent a disruptive, politically 
disastrous government shutdown. The temporary-spending bill gives 
negotiators two more days. House Appropriations Committee Chairman 
Bob Livingston says he hopes this will be enough. We're not going 
to close the government. We're going to stay here as long as we absolutely 
have to get our business done. And it's my hope, my genuine and sincere 
hope, that we will conclude our business in the next few hours. The 
unfinished business totals about $500 billion including foreign aid 
and help for the International Monetary Fund. While these matters 
are largely settled, the two sides are divided over spending for education 
and other issues. And with elections just three weeks away, both parties 
are exploiting the budget for maximum political gain. House Minority 
Leader Dick Gephardt angrily blames Republicans for the impasse. And 
we're here late because of their sheer incompetence and imdeptness 
and inability to do their work. This is the worst Congress that's 
ever been in this building. There's no leadership. There's only leadership 
for special interest. It's all about money folks. That's what this 
Congress is about. Republicans counter by saying the president has 
been absent much of the year or distracted by the Monica Lewinsky 
scandal. However, the parties say they are still bargaining in good 
faith and making progress. David Swann, VOA News, Capitol Hill.
