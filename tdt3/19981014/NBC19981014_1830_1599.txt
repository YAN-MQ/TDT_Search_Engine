Tonight on "living longer, living better," calcium. From the time 
you were young you have been cold that calcium is important for strong 
bones and strong teeth. Tonight they have research that goes a lot 
further in underscores the importance of calcium in the diet. a bone 
scan using the newest technology. Almost everyone knows that calcium 
is crucial for healthy bones, but new research shows that calcium 
is even more critically important than we thought, and not just for 
bones. It is essential for every organ, every tissue, every system. 
If you don't have calcium, nothing functions. In fact, researchers 
now believe that without enough calcium, we are at risk for a wide 
variety of health problems, including high blood pressure, colon cancer, 
even premenstrual syndrome. Dr. Susan thys jacobs, a leading expert 
on calcium, says most Americans need to consume more calcium, and 
people over 50 need at least 1,200 milligrams a day, the amount in 
four glasses of milk. But guess what? Nobody is drinking four glasses 
of milk a day. In fact, most of us consume less than half the amount 
of calcium we need, and that causes health problems, because our bodies 
make up for the deficit by stripping calcium from our bones with hormones. 
The body doesn't like using these hormones, and you're going to have 
to pay back. And there are various ways of payback. First comes weakening 
of the bones, then high blood pressure, and cancer risk, because of 
the excess hormones. So what should you do? 36-year-old mother of 
two, Anne Haas, takes supplements twice a day and makes sure there's 
plenty of calcium in the food she eats. Nutritionists say there are 
lots of ways to get calcium. You get calcium from tofu, you get calcium 
from leafy green vegetables. You get a little calcium in beans. You 
get calcium whenever you eat a canned fish in which there are still 
bones, such as sardines or salmon. As people grow older, experts say 
they need to remain as conscious as Anne Haas is of their calcium 
intake. Calcium plays a much bigger role than we ever knew in "living 
longer, living better." Robert Bazell, NBC news, New York.
