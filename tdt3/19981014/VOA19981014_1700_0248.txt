The US Congress has approved another temporary spending measure as 
lawmakers and the White House continue to hammer out details of a 
$500 billion budget bill. The House and The Senate passed a stop gap-spending 
bill to keep the government running until Friday night. A new measure 
now goes to President Clinton for his signature. This is the latest 
in a series of temporary spending bills approved by The White House 
and Congress while trying to complete work on the fiscal year 1999 
budget.
