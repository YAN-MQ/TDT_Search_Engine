The inclusion of gays and lesbians in hate crime legislation is getting 
support in Washington today. Outside the capitol tonight, a vigil 
for Matthew shepard. He's the gay student beaten to death in Wyoming. 
Shepard's death prompted gay and lesbian leaders to meet with attorney 
general Janet Reno today. They want Congress to pass legislation making 
crimes based on an individual's gender, disability or sexual orientation 
a federal offense. Authorities say shepard was pistol-whipped and 
hung to a fence post for 18 hours in near-freezing temperatures. Police 
say robbery was the main motive, but he was chosen partly because 
he was gay.
