The World's Eddy Maher who will write again, faithfully, next week. 
Meanwhile, why not write us yourself, especially if you want to get 
us your choice for the Nobel Peace prize by tomorrow's deadline. We've 
already gotten quite a few nominees, ranging from former President 
Jimmy Carter to current President Bill Clinton with a lot of surprises 
in between. So call in your nominations at 617-868-5750 or e-mail 
us at The World. That's www.theworld.org. Again, Yahoo's daily pick, 
www.theworld.org. In a moment we'll peel away the Indian onion story 
on pri. This is The World. I'm Tony Kahn.
