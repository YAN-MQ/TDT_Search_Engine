Taliban leaders have told UN Special Envoy Loctar Bruehemi that the 
will release all Iranian prisoners. Two western news agencies report 
an exchange of captives with Iran is part of the deal, but no other 
details are available. The announcement followed several hours of 
talks Wednesday at the Taliban headquarters in Kanduhar, Afghanistan. 
The Taliban wants the United Nations to stop what it calls "Iranian 
interference" in the Afghan civil war.
