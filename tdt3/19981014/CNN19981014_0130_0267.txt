A city charter amendment in Cincinnati that denies discrimination 
protection to homosexuals is allowed to stand. The Supreme Court has 
turned away a challenge from a gay rights group that says the amendment 
violates equal protection rights. A lawyer who argued for the amendment 
says this is a vindication for the democratic rights of the city's 
people who voted for it five years ago.
