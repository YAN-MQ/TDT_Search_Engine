Malaysia's Former Deputy Prime Minister, Anwar Ibrahim has been released 
from detention under the countries Internal Security Act which allows 
for indefinite detention without trial. Maggie Lee has a report from 
Kuala Lumpur. Malaysian police said Mr. Anwar would no longer be held 
under the powerful Internal Security Act. However, the ousted Deputy 
Prime Minister continues to remain in police custody. Mr. Anwar has 
moved from the police headquarters to another prison outside the capital, 
Kuala Lumpur. Mr. Anwar was fired from cabinet last month and has 
been charged with sodomy and corruption. He will be tried in Malaysia's 
High Court next month. Mr. Anwar has pleaded not guilty to all the 
charges and says they are part of a political conspiracy to remove 
him from power. Mr. Anwar was detained under the Internal Security 
Act after authorities said he had incited his supporters through riots 
in Kuala Lumpur. The act announced police to detain anyone considered 
a threat to national security indefinitely. Since his arrest, there 
have been huge street demonstrations in the capital which riot police 
have dispersed using tier gas and water canons. Police have also detained 
key supporters of Mr. Anwar under the Internal Security Act. Most 
of them have been released. Mr. Anwar's detention under the act has 
been condemned and questioned by human rights groups and international 
observers. Last week, more than 2,000 Malaysian lawyers called for 
the Government to revoke the act saying it was a violation of fundamental 
human rights. Mr. Anwar will now be reminded as an ordinary prisoner 
facing criminal charges. It's expected he will now be permitted more 
access to his attorneys and to his family members. The High Courts 
have denied bail and his lawyers will be appealing against that decision. 
Later this month, the High Court will also hear an application filed 
from Mr. Anwar's wife to free him from alleged unlawful detention.
