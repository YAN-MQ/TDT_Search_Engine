Although Yugoslavia's president promised to end his brutal crackdown 
in Kosovo, ethnic Albanian refugees driven from their homes by Serb 
bullets don't believe him. ``He's lying! He's lying! He's lying!'' 
Hajdin Mehmeti shouted Wednesday. The refugees' distrust of President 
Slobodan Milosevic has kept them from returning home. Mehmeti, 70, 
is an ethnic Albanian refugee in this hamlet on a mud road deep in 
the forested hills about 40 kilometers (25 miles) northwest of Pristina, 
capital of the beleaguered Kosovo province of Serbia. The near-universal 
belief that Milosevic can't be trusted is one of the principal reasons 
why Mehmeti and hundreds of thousands like him are in no hurry to 
move back to their shattered villages and homes to take up new lives 
in the aftermath of the deal struck between Milosevic and U.S. envoy 
Richard Holbrooke. There are other reasons, of course. Many have no 
homes to return to. Only charred remains, or shells of houses with 
no roofs, or gutted, looted, windowless structures unfit for human 
habitation. The agreement in Belgrade calls for withdrawal of significant 
numbers of special police forces and army troops from Kosovo, the 
poor southern province of Serbia and for monitoring by about 2,000 
unarmed civilians under the auspices of the 54-nation Organization 
for Security and Cooperation in Europe. Serbia is the dominant of 
the two remaining states in the Yugoslav federation. Many refugees 
simply shake their heads at the prospect of unarmed monitors keeping 
the peace in this land of deep hatreds, a land where the role of the 
police is not to protect the people but to serve the interests of 
the state. ``I don't think the plan will work,'' said Maher Shpati, 
24, sitting on the cement floor of a partially finished house with 
a roomful of relatives, a pan of potatoes simmering on an iron stove. 
The owner of the house has fled. Mehmeti agreed on the need for force. 
``Until the NATO planes fly here, Milosevic will say whatever people 
want to hear,'' said Mehmeti. ``One hundred times he has lied.'' ``We 
trust in you,'' he said, embracing an American visitor. ``But in him? 
Never!'' All over Kosovo, people are saying the same thing. Nobody 
feels safe as long as the fearsome Serb special police in their blue 
camouflage uniforms are patrolling the towns and villages of the province. 
``There are police based in our village, so we can't go back,'' said 
Isa Veliqi, 36, living with seven members of his family in a shed 
behind a destroyed farmhouse. ``If the observers come, maybe we can 
really go home.'' But, unarmed observers? The idea leaves some people 
speechless. ``I don't know what they are going to do here without 
guns,'' said Shpati. The Kosovo Diplomatic Observer Mission, a small 
force that came here in July to monitor refugees, security and freedom 
of movement, but which pulled out on Monday when NATO bombing looked 
imminent, has returned. KDOM, as it's called, is made up of an American, 
European Union and Russian units. The KDOM observers are now spearheading 
the OSCE mission, and eventually will be absorbed by it, a Western 
diplomat said. The question now is how fast can this thing get going. 
It will take weeks to recruit, train and deploy large numbers of people 
in the field. And today's chill autumn winds in Kosovo will be freezing 
soon. Thousands of people living with little more than sheets of plastic 
to keep out the elements simply don't have weeks to wait. They need 
help now. It is difficult to verify whether or not Milosevic is keeping 
his word about withdrawing police and troops. The police presence 
did not appear diminished on Wednesday, as officials at NATO headquarters 
noted, and no convoys of withdrawing forces were seen. The Belgrade 
agreement allows the West to conduct aerial reconnaissance flights, 
but they, too, offer small comfort to a refugee faced with a police 
pistol or automatic weapon.
