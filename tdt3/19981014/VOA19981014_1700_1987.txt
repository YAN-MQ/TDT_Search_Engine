Zimbawe's President has blasted what he called continuing aggression 
by Rwanda and Uganda in Congo Kensasha. Robert Mugaba made the charge 
as he returned from a meeting in Limbobashe with Congo Kensasha President 
Louran Kabelia. Rwanda denies involvement in Congo. Uganda says its 
troops are in Congo, but only to combat rebels with bases there.
