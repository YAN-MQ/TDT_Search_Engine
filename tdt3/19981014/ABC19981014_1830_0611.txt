The prevailing psychology about the economy has turned, in a word, 
cautious. The government reported today that retail sales were up 
just 3% in September. But for the entire third quarter, sales were 
down .1% from earlier in the year. Consumer spending is by far the 
most important factor in economic growth. And the fact is, people 
are spending less. Here's ABC's Betsy Stark. Consumers are still opening 
their wallets, but now they're thinking twice before they do. I'm 
a little cautious now about what I'm spending and where I'm spending 
it, a little more than I was a year ago. Shoppers are buying less 
clothing, especially in the more expensive department stores. Just 
tell us the size you want. Home furnishing sales have also declined. 
I think it began with the stock market crash. A lot of people who 
were ready to buy high-ticket items were somewhat inhibited after 
they lost $40,000, $50,000, $100,000. Nearly half of American households 
have invested money in the stock market directly or through retirement 
accounts. Between July and the end of September, the average investment 
account has lost 15% of its value. Leaving the average consumer feeling 
a little less flush. It's going to make me a little more cautious 
because financially the funds aren't there like they were a month 
ago. Consumers may be spending less, but as long as jobs are plentiful 
and wages continue to rise, economists believe consumers will continue 
to spend enough to keep the economy growing. In fact, today's ABC 
News poll shows 72% of those surveyed remain decidedly upbeat about 
the American economy, and 65% rate their own finances healthy. Americans 
are still buying lots of cars, thanks in part to generous rebate and 
incentive programs and discounters, including Wal-Mart and Kmart, 
report brisk sales of consumer electronics and home appliances. This 
isn't what you'd call slow consumer spending. It's still a fairly 
brisk pace. Retailers may wish Christmas had come in June, when the 
stock market was cresting, but even with the market down, they are 
still forecasting a solid holiday shopping season. Betsy Stark, ABC 
News, New York.
