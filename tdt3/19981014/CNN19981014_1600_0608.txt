Frank yankovic, the man known as the polka king, is dead. David Daniel 
looks at the musician's long and fruitful career. It's possible no 
one ever defined a musical genre in the U.S. the way Frank yankovic 
defined polka. It's almost certain no one had more fun entertaining 
more people for more years, as they wore out more dancing shoes. Yankovic 
spent six decades spreading the gospel of slovenian-style polka music 
from his hometown of Cleveland across the nation. He had the first 
million-selling polka song, "just because," in 1948. Just because 
you think you're so pretty just because you think you're so hot The 
next year, his "blue skirt waltz" sold even more copies, and polka 
was on its way to becoming a mainstay of American musical culture. 
He barnstormed across the country, sharing the pleasures of polka 
in ballrooms and at whistle-stops, while best-selling records solidified 
his reputation as America's polka king. Fittingly, when the first 
Grammy award for polka was awarded in 1986, the man who introduced 
millions to the music took the trophy. Yankovic kept performing into 
his 80s, partly because he loved introducing new generations to polka 
and partly because he loved the music. In his own words -- "polkas 
make you forget your troubles. It's the happiest music this side of 
heaven." Frank yankovic was 83 years old.
