Dozens of hungry bears facing a poor mushroom and berry crop in northern 
Siberia have migrated south and killed at least two people and 19 
cattle this autumn, a news report said Wednesday. A 62-year-old man 
was mauled to death just outside a town in the Novosibirsk region, 
and a 68-year-old woman from the same town was attacked last month, 
forest officials said Wednesday, according to the ITAR-Tass news agency. 
The brown bears have attacked domestic animals, too, killing 19 cattle 
this season. Police have arranged special hunting squads and are cruising 
the area with a helicopter to look for the bears, the report said.
