I'm Dave Deforest, VOA News. Monitors on the ground in Kosovo say 
Serbian police are departing and people are returning to their villages 
in the east, but US State Department Spokesman James Rubin says Wednesday 
there are very early reports. He says it is too soon to tell if President 
Slovodon Milosoveciz is complying with the agreement to bring peace 
to Kosovo. Meanwhile, NATO is keeping the pressure on Mr. Milosoveviz. 
Warplanes are ready to strike as early as Saturday, if he shows signs 
of non-compliance. Britain says it is sending an advanced team Thursday 
to Kosovo to help organize the monitoring of the planned Serb military 
pullout there. VOA Correspondent Laurie Kessman, Britain ultimately 
expects to provide 1/10 of the 2000 foreign inspectors. Britain is 
not wasting any time in providing personnel for the Kosovo verification 
mission. British Foreign Secretary Robin Cook says an advanced team 
is ready to leave this week for Kosovo. Another 150 inspectors will 
go within the next two weeks. They will be people of caliber, able 
to give this mission the eyes and the ears which the international 
community needs to make sure we keep tabs on President Milosovic. 
The British contingent would be the first wave of an air and ground 
monitoring mission to verify that Yugoslavia's president is fulfilling 
his promise to pull Serb's special forces from Kosovo and let the 
displaced return to their homes there. Laurie Kessman, VOA News, London.
