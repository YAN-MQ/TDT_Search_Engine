The list of charges against FBI fugitive Eric Rudolph is growing. 
Today he was formally charged with the 1996 centennial Olympic park 
bombing in Atlanta. A woman was killed and more than 100 people were 
injured in that attack. Rudolph, who already is accused of bombing 
a women's health clinic in Birmingham, Alabama, also is being charged 
with attacks last year at another women's clinic and a gay bar in 
Atlanta. Authorities say they have evidence that links Rudolph to 
the bombings, but they are not providing any details. They did, however, 
release a new picture of Rudolph. Authorities believe it shows him 
as he appeared at the time of the Olympic park bombing. Rudolph has 
eluded authorities for more than eight months and is believed to be 
living in the wilderness of western North Carolina. He grew up in 
the area and is very familiar with the terrain. Eric Rudolph is on 
the run. Hundreds of agents are on his trail. They have spent thousands 
of hours pursuing leads, interviewing witnesses, and tracing the components 
of each of the bombs. Without their efforts, these charges would not 
have been possible. And I want to commend them and congratulate them.
