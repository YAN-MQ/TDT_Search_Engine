Robert Lee Gill, a longtime member of the New York Stock Exchange 
and a prominent collector of American antiques, died Sept. 24 at his 
home in Manhattan. He was 87. Gill was born in South Orange, N.J., 
in 1911 and attended Choate. He joined Shields &AMP; Co. in 1932, 
and in the late 1940s formed a company with three other members of 
the stock exchange, but for most of his career he worked independently. 
Gill's interest in Americana began at the Metropolitan Museum of Art, 
where he was a regular visitor to the American collection from the 
time it opened, in 1927, until his death. In the late 1930s he began 
collecting first-edition books and Currier &AMP; Ives prints. He also 
made regular visits to the Upper East Side gallery of Israel Sack, 
a dealer in Americana and American antiques, becoming part of what 
was then the small world of serious collectors of American antiques, 
with members including Henry Ford, Henry Francis du Pont and Ima Hogg. 
In 1942 Gill bought his first antique, a lowboy once owned by John 
Hancock. Over the next few decades he formed an exceptional collection, 
primarily 17th- and 18th-century Boston, Federal and Newport furniture. 
He was known for his eye and the striking arrangement of the collection 
in his apartment. In the late 1980s, Gill also began collecting Chinese 
porcelain. In the 1970s, the U.S. government bought two pieces from 
his collection, a small painting of the White House under construction 
and a late Federal card table, which are still displayed in the White 
House. Last year Gill endowed a research fellow scholarship at the 
Henry Francis du Pont Winterthur Museum in Delaware. Gill's first 
wife, Caroline Townsend Chapman Gill, died in 1984. He is survived 
by his wife, Melanie; a son from his first marriage, Peter Gill of 
Bronxville, a stepson, Jack Chapman of Fort Pierce, Fla.; two sisters, 
Barbara Betts of West Hampton Beach, N.Y., and Mary Roby of Rochester, 
and five grandchildren.
