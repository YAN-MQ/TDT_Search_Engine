They are the unsung corporate heroes. The people who make sure the 
mail gets to your desk. After toiling in obscurity for decades, they 
finally got a little recognition. Jeanne Moos put her stamp on this 
one. The mailroom -- a workplace with none of the cachet of, say, 
the newsroom or the emergency room. Chances are, there'll never be 
a show on TV called "Mr." True, there was "Saturday night live's" 
copy boy. The guy with the tan. The tanmeister. And the mailroom has 
had a bit part on Broadway. Whoever the company fires I will still 
be here But generally speaking, the priority for a mailroom worker 
is the urgent desire to rush to a better job. go! Which brings us 
to the corporate mailroom challenge, sort of like the mailroom Olympics. 
Once again, you're gonna see a lot -- a whole lot of collating and 
boxing going on. Eight employees from corporate mailrooms across the 
nation met in Manhattan to do what they do every day. While being 
timed by a stopwatch -- Six minutes gone, one minute left in the round. 
-- and watched by a panel of judges from the postal service, UPS and 
airborne express. These mailroom marvels struggled with tape, experienced 
the agony of having tape break and flaunted techniques comparable 
to those used on hospital sheets. A lot of taping, you say? Well, 
this was sponsored by Scotch brand. It's exciting. I'm sweating. Look 
at these. Look, they're sweating bullets. Pretty exciting event, huh? 
Well -- the sleeping guy says it all. Finally, only two contestants 
remained. The final task -- You need to take this envelop to the CEO's 
golf clubs, and ship them to St. Andrew, Scotland. Donna Dylan of 
the wasaw insurance mail room had her golf clubs boxed before Debbie 
Atkins of rezcare was done with the bubble wrap. But in the end -- 
And the winner is -- Debbie Atkins. Though the two finalists embrace 
a La miss America, there was a twinge of bitterness. Donna though 
she had won the $5,000 prize. Fair is fair. But when the judges checked 
Donna's packaging -- Donna had put the letter to the boss inside the 
golf bag instead of taping it on as the instructions required. The 
winner's wisdom? When I wrap things, I try to wrap 'em like if I was 
gonna receive them. The golden rule of wrapping. Co-workers of the 
winner cried. The loser wept. More than packages need to be handled 
with care. Why the winner herself had grinning eyes and quivering 
chin. Talk about fragile. Jeanne Moos, CNN, New York.
