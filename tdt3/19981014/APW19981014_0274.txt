A boat being loaded with charcoal in a northeastern Somali port for 
illegal export to Saudi Arabia was reportedly set ablaze and looted 
by civilians and freelance gunmen, sources said Wednesday. The Mashwa 
was anchored in Al Ayo, about 50 kilometers (30 miles) west of Bosasso 
on the Gulf of Aden, when it was burned Tuesday, businessmen contacted 
by VHF radio said. The Mashwa was also carrying electronic goods, 
they said. Early last year, authorities in Bosasso banned the export 
of charcoal, wildlife and female camels, goats and sheep through the 
port. Charcoal burners have destroyed most of the wooded areas in 
northern Somalia to satisfy demand for charcoal from the United Arab 
Emirates and Saudi Arabia. Authorities also fear that unregulated 
export is depleting Somalia's natural wildlife and its breeding stock 
of domesticated livestock. But to elude the ban, the trade in the 
proscribed items has simply shifted from Bosasso to small, natural 
harbors on the Gulf of Aden or along the Indian Ocean coast. Shipping 
sources in Bosasso said a dispute had broken out among Somali businessmen 
over their share of the cargo space on board the large dhow, and the 
unhappy ones set fire to the wooden vessel. Thirteen crew members 
managed to jump to safety, but four others, including Capt. Jamal 
Salah were missing and believed being held by the gunmen for ransom. 
The crew included Sudanese, Indians and a Somali. Somalia has had 
no functioning central government since the 1991 ouster of the late 
dictator Mohammed Siad Barre and subsequent disintegration of the 
country into fiefdoms guarded by clan-based militia. But in northeastern 
Somalia, local leaders have managed to establish some order, and the 
region is relatively peaceful.
