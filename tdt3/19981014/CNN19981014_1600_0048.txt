One of the FBI's ten most wanted fugitives now is facing additional 
charges. Eric Rudolph, who has eluded authorities since the January 
29th bombing of a women's clinic in Birmingham, Alabama, was charged 
in three other attacks today. Federal authorities believe he is responsible 
for the 1996 bombing at centennial Olympic park in Atlanta. That explosion 
killed a woman and wounded more than 100 people. Rudolph also was 
formally charged today in the bombing of a gay bar and a family planning 
clinic in Atlanta last year. The FBI has released a new picture of 
Rudolph. Authorities believe it shows him as he appeared at the time 
of the Olympic park bombing. He is believed to be living in the wilderness 
of western North Carolina. The FBI says it will press on with its 
search. We will pursue this case as a top priority, obviously, as 
a matter of top law enforcement priority. These cases have a grave 
impact on public safety, as well as the ability of people to exercise 
their freedoms and liberties. Including the peaceful Olympic games, 
which of course are now scheduled to occur in Salt Lake City. The 
January bombing in Birmingham represented the first deadly bombing 
of a clinic in the United States where abortions are performed. An 
off-duty police officer was killed and a nurse, Emily Lyons, was critically 
wounded. There's always that thought that whoever's responsible will 
do this again. And knowing what we've been through this year, we don't 
want anyone else to have to deal with that. It's something you can't 
begin to imagine. And I don't think either one of us could tell you 
enough to even bring that aspect to light. So yes, we hope whoever's 
responsible will get caught and no harm to anybody else. Investigators 
hope today's developments will prompt more tips that could lead to 
Rudolph's capture. There's a $1 million reward for his arrest. Reno 
is urging anyone with possible leads to call -- 1-888-ATF-bomb
