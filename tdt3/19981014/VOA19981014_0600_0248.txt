Congolese rebels were consolidating their hold on the strategic eastern 
city of Kindu Wednesday which they seized earlier this week after 
heavy fighting. Sonya Lawrence-Green reports from our East Africa 
Bureau. Congolese rebels have flown a plane full of their officials 
into the eastern town of Kindu, a key military base which they seized 
from government troops late Monday. Rebels spokesman, Bizera Makahara 
pronounced the capture of Kindu as the beginning of the end for Congo's 
President, Laurent Kabila. The rebels appear to be in firm control 
of Kindu. They started collecting military equipment, assault rifles 
and machine guns left behind by fleeing government soldiers and they 
are holding 400 prisoners captured during the fierce battle for their 
river town. Kindu had been the government's main eastern military 
garrison. And the center of it's assault on the rebels who have captured 
a large group of territory in the east since launching their defenses 
August 2nd. After taking Kindu, the rebels say they will push south 
and west to the mineral rich regions of Kasai and Katanga. Sonya Lawrence-Green
