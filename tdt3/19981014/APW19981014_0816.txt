An alleged Italian mafia viceroy in the German town of Baden-Baden 
was sentenced to four years in jail Wednesday for weapons offenses, 
escaping a heavier sentence for instigating murder. A reason for the 
lighter sentence was the unreliability of the testimony by a key states 
witness, said Judge Guenther Hartweck. ``You can't rely on somebody 
who went on record with his testimony as if it were something out 
of a serial novel,'' the judge said. Sabatino Ciccerelli's arrest 
in September 1997 and subsequent trial caused a stir after a states 
witness alleged the accused was a leading mafia member and viceroy 
in Germany for Italian mafia leader Toto Riina, a reputed ``boss of 
bosses.'' Ciccarelli, 59, was charged with contracting another Italian 
in the spring of 1995 to obtain a weapon with a silencer and ammunition 
in Belgium. The evidence for the weapons charge was gathered from 
two years of phone taps by German investigators. The weapon was intended 
for use by two Naples natives in southern Germany, to kill another 
Italian suspected by Ciccarelli of being a police informant, prosecutors 
said. The plan was thwarted when the man who obtained the weapon was 
arrested. In the other case, prosecutors said Ciccarelli contacted 
another Italian to kill a fellow countryman, but the plot was thwarted 
when the Italian informed federal police. Judge Hartweck said he believed 
there had been ``a concrete plan to do something with the weapon,'' 
but it couldn't be proven that Ciccarelli planned to kill anyone with 
it. Security surrounding the eight-day trial was tight in this southern 
German spa town, with armed police patrolling the court building and 
conducting body searches. State prosecutor Juergen Gremmelmaier, an 
investigator and Ciccarelli himself had all received death threats.
