Astronomers have gotten a look at one of the solar system's most impressive 
light shows. The galileo satellite has sent back images of Jupiter's 
Moon io. More than 30 volcanos spew enough lava to cover the surface 
half an inch deep. Electricity created by Jupiter's magnetic fields 
energizes sulfur dioxide vented by the volcanos, so they appear to 
send off streams of blue light. The magnetic fields generate more 
than 1 trillion Watts of electricity and gives io its halo of light.
