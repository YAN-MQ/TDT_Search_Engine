When we come back -- stopping the slaughter in Kosovo. My interview 
with Richard Holbrooke on what it is like to go face-to-face with 
a ruthless dictator. You've spent hours and hours with Milosevic. 
What drives him? Power. They've struck a deal, but will it be enough 
to end the slaughter? And "living longer, living better" -- the power 
of calcium. It's about a lot more than strong bones. Is there anything 
I can do to stop bone loss? Absolutely. Here's proof. In a landmark 
clinical study, caltrate actually stopped bone loss... in women at 
risk for osteoporosis. Whatever your age: life's an adventure! Because 
you're over 50 and still exploring! So take the centrum made just
