Time now for sports and here in the studio with us with the latest 
details is Steve Shy. And Steve, I hear we're starting off with baseball 
today. We sure are. The Atlanta Braves are trying at this moment to 
become the first team in baseball history to win a best of seven league 
championship series after losing the first three games. The Braves 
are down three games to two to the San Diego Padres. Game Six is underway 
at Turner Field in Atlanta with the Braves pinning their hopes on 
former Cy Young Award Winning Pitcher Tome Glavine. The Padres have 
countered with left-hander Sterling Hitchcock, who has allowed seven 
hits and just one earned run in 10 1/3 innings against the Braves. 
Right now, that game just in the top of the fourth inning and scoreless 
so far. The winner of the series plays the New York Yankees in the 
World Series beginning Saturday in New York. The Yankees made it to 
the World Series after winning their 35th American league Pennant 
with a 9 to 5 victory over the Cleveland Indians. The win Tuesday 
night gave the Yankees the American League Championship title in a 
four game to two series triumph. Manager Joe Torre says getting back 
to the World Series is almost as much of an accomplishment as winning 
the title. JOE TORRE, MANAGER, NEW YORK YANKEES; You know, if we win 
the World Series, it will be magnificent and we'll celebrate. But 
getting there is such a tough mountain to climb. And to have been 
able to do that against a club like the Cleveland Indians who have 
been there so often and it's just very satisfying. The Indians roared 
back in the fifth inning from a 6 run deficit when Jim Tome blasted 
a grand slam home run, But then, a 3 run sixth inning sparked by a 
Derek Jeter triple gave New York the cushion it needed to win the 
game and reach the Fall Classic. Indian Skipper Mike Hargrove says 
his team just got beaten by a better team. I'm absolutely disappointed 
that we didn't go on, but we realize too that the Yankees have a very 
good ballclub and they played better than we did. They deserve to 
go on. This will mark the second time in the last three years that 
New York has made it to the World Series.
