Yugoslavia is taking the first steps towards ending its crackdown 
in Kosovo as part of a deal with NATO. President Slobodan Milosevic 
has outlined a plan for a separate parliament in the autonomy-minded 
province with local elections set for next year. NATO officials meeting 
in Brussels today said the threat of air strikes will hold until Milosevic 
withdraws his forces and begins peace talks with separatist ethnic 
Albanians. The deadline for compliance is Saturday. U.S. envoy Richard 
Holbrooke, who brokered the deal, says NATO will be watching closely. 
He says he's pulled his troops out already. To tell you the truth, 
he has reduced his troops significantly in the past two weeks, but 
that's a shell game. He can put troops in, he can take them out. It 
isn't what he does in the next 24 hours on the troops, it's that he 
takes them out and keeps them out.
