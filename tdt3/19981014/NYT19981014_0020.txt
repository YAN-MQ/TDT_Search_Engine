Bernie Williams has been extremely aloof during the post-season, so 
distant that Manager Joe Torre had a private meeting with him and 
so distant that General Manager Brian Cashman and other Yankee officials 
have been repeatedly quizzed about it. Torre acknowledged that Williams, 
who is usually quiet and introspective, has not been himself. Even 
Williams basically conceded it. Sweating profusely as he stood beside 
the batting cage Tuesday night before Game 6 of the American League 
Championship Series with the Cleveland Indians at Yankee Stadium, 
Williams was told by a reporter about how uncomfortable he seemed 
lately. ``It seems like I'm not here,'' Williams interjected. He laughed 
nervously and added: ``I try to be during the games. After the game, 
it's another story.'' Though the Yankees advanced to the World Series 
by beating the Indians, 9-5, they will need their 30-year-old center 
fielder to be physically and mentally sharp to have the best chance 
to cap their special season. Williams singled in the game's first 
run in the first inning Tuesday night, singled and scored in the second 
inning, walked to lead off the fifth and singled home the Yankees' 
ninth run in the sixth, before being thrown out stealing. The output 
represented a significant improvement after he had mustered five hits, 
no homers and three RBIs in his first 28 post-season at bats. When 
Torre was asked if he had noticed that Williams had been uncharacteristically 
distant, he said, ``Oh yeah.'' ``It's so hard,'' the manager said. 
``Bernie is OK. There is nothing going on there.'' Williams did not 
travel back from Cleveland on the team plane Sunday night; instead 
he hustled out of the clubhouse and left earlier on a commercial flight, 
with Torre's permission. The Yankees have held two optional workouts 
during the ALCS; Williams, who is considered a team leader, bypassed 
the one in Cleveland and was unavailable for the one in New York. 
As one of the most polite and affable players on the Yankees, Williams 
has almost always been available after games to discuss his performances, 
both positive and negative. But he has been extremely eager to leave 
the park during the post-season, without explanation. In the ALCS 
opener, Williams ripped two hits and drove in two runs as the Yankees 
silenced the Indians, 7-2, but he bolted out of the clubhouse less 
than 10 minutes after the game in view of more than 100 reporters. 
Instead of turning left to leave Yankee Stadium, as he normally would, 
Williams turned right and took a longer way out, not even making eye 
contact with reporters. Some Yankee officials were shocked. There 
are many players who do not talk to reporters, but that is out of 
character for Williams. After Games 4 and 5, Williams spoke briefly 
to reporters and departed quickly. ``Bernie doesn't say a whole lot 
unless you go in there and try to dig in,'' Torre said. ``I think 
he's fighting it a little bit, and feeling that he's let people down 
and like he thinks he should get more hits.'' Torre realized that 
Williams was struggling in this post-season, so he met with him. Neither 
man would divulge the conversation, but Williams said: ``Talking to 
Joe is always helpful. Am I pressing? No.'' Now that the Yankees have 
reached the World Series, Williams has at least two more weeks as 
a Yankee before he presumably tests free agency. When asked if he 
was concerned about the possibility of his career with New York coming 
to a close, Williams said, ``No, I'm not thinking about the future.'' 
Cashman, who will be among the officials who decide if Williams should 
be offered $11 million or $12 million a year, was asked if he was 
worried about the post-season performance of a player who is making 
$8.25 million and is apparently struggling in more ways than one. 
``Does it worry me? No,'' Cashman said. ``He won a batting title with 
his contract out there. I don't think any of that bothers him.'' After 
an intense batting practice on Tuesday night, Williams essentially 
admitted that he was not himself, but he also contended that he was 
fine. ``Everything is OK with me,'' Williams said. ``So far, so good. 
I'm trying to get this done.''
