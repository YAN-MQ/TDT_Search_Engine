Wall Street's woes are being felt by investors both big and small. 
Now, those troubles may be claiming a major hockey franchise as another 
victim. Donald Van de Mark explains why the Pittsburgh Penguins may 
be going from Stanley cup champions to bust. In the early '90s, Mario 
Lemieux led the Pittsburgh Penguins to two Stanley cup championships. 
Now, the Penguins have declared bankruptcy. And even Lemieux, now 
retired, has sued the franchise for promised pay. It takes a lot of 
hard work to take a good sports asset and turn it into a bad one. 
Penguin's owner Roger Marino says the team has lost over $37 million 
in the past two years. And while he's reached a partial agreement 
with Lemieux, he could walk away from many liabilities by seeking 
chapter 11 protection in bankruptcy court. It's very possible that 
if they have an enormous financial obligation, either to a former 
player or indeed to anybody else, to a bank, that this is an attempt 
to protect themselves from the creditor taking over the team. If Penguin 
owners default on debts, games are expected to go on as usual. But 
for how long? NHL commissioner Gary bettman has threatened to revoke 
the team franchise, leaving owners with little to offer creditors 
or Pittsburgh fans. From the fans' standpoint, a team going into bankruptcy 
is really a terrible situation. While much of Pittsburgh's problems 
are home grown, several NHL teams are struggling. Canadian teams suffering 
with the depreciating currency, and without local television and Arena 
ownership, some U.S. franchises are also losing money. All of this 
when hockey was supposed to be skating into the limelight, as the 
NBA season is now in serious doubt and as Disney's ABC and ESPN television 
networks have paid big bucks for U.S. television rights to the nhl.
