Well, we're happy to mail you a VOA frequency schedule and we hope 
it gets to you. Just send us your name and address neatly printed 
or typed on a letter or postcard. Mail it to Voice of America, Washington, 
DC, USA, 20547. Speaking of frequencies it's time to talk about them. 
If you're listening to us in Oceania or the Pacific, you can consider 
switching over right now to 9.705 megahertz short wave which we're 
now broadcasting on from 21 hours to 0 hour universal time. And you 
know, you might want to visit our Web site hooked up to the Internet. 
Our Web site address is www.voa.gov/newsnow and in this case newsnow 
is written as one word. It's 21 hours 30 universal time and this is 
VOA News Now. Monitors on the ground in Kosovo say Serbian police 
are departing and people are returning to their villages in the east. 
Taliban officials have told UN Special Envoy Lacarb Brehimi * they 
will release all Iranian prisoners. And on the forthcoming edition 
of Dateline, we'll look at the politics of petroleum. All that and 
more in our next half-hour of VOA News Now. First the latest world 
news.
