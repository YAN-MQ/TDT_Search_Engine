Authorities in tultepec, Mexico, say Tuesday's deadly explosion was 
caused by a gas leak that set off gunpowder from nearby fireworks 
factories. The blast destroyed four city blocks, killing at least 
ten people. At least 50 more are injured or missing. Emergency crews, 
assisted by the army, are searching for survivors. A red cross official 
says the main explosion probably set off a chain reaction among dozens 
of nearby makeshift factories.
