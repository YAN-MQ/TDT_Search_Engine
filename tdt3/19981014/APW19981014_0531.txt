Ukrainian President Leonid Kuchma asked a group of non-affiliated 
lawmakers Wednesday to suggest candidates for his embattled government. 
``The president is expecting proposals and candidacies to make changes 
in the government,'' said Kuchma's spokesman Oleksandr Maidannyk. 
He said Kuchma also was ready to consult with all factions in the 
parliament over the composition of his Cabinet. About 25 of its 450 
members are not affiliated with any party. Kuchma's meeting with the 
lawmakers came one day after the parliament, dominated by his leftist 
and centrist foes, failed to muster enough votes to bring down the 
Cabinet of Prime Minister Valery Pustovoitenko over its handling of 
Ukraine's deep economic crisis. ``The results of the vote show that 
the government's efforts to overcome the crisis are bringing certain 
positive results,'' Kuchma said Wednesday, according to Maidannyk. 
Kuchma, who has made such offers before, says he opposes parliamentary 
attempts to bring down the entire government, which he views as being 
motivated by political reasons rather than by the Cabinet's alleged 
incompetence. Maidannyk suggested that those lawmakers who abstained 
or voted against the no-confidence motion might eventually form the 
basis for a broad parliamentary majority. If consensus is to emerge 
from the currently divided parliament, Kuchma would entrust lawmakers 
with forming a new government, Maidannyk said. Pustovoitenko also 
said Wednesday that he has asked five centrist and two leftist parliamentary 
factions, which voted against the no-confidence motion Tuesday, to 
submit their proposals for filling ``any posts'' in the government. 
``Those who deserve it will by all means get government posts,'' Pustovoitenko 
said.
