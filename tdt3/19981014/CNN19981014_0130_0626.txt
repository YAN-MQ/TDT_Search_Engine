NBA fans who were looking forward the start of the basketball season 
are going to have to wait a little longer. For the first time, a labor 
dispute is causing games to be canceled. Gary Tuchman has the story. 
What time is it! Game time, hoops! The national basketball association 
has played over 35,000 consecutive games in its 51 year history without 
a labor dispute cancellation. But that run is now over. We are reluctantly 
going to be canceling the first two weeks of the regular season. The 
announcement comes after players and owners met in a negotiating session 
in an effort to resolve a labor dispute over escalating salaries that 
has led to the owners locking out players. We're very disappointed 
that had to happen. You know, we made -- we're makin' a -- negotiating 
in good faith, trying to bridge the gap. Now, the ball is in their 
court. An appropriate and accurate description. The owners say they 
will explore a proposal by players that would impose a luxury tax 
on owners who sign players to exorbitant contracts. The players believe 
it would aid owners in their desire for cost certainty. We're gonna 
spend two days trying to explore it and we told the players we'd get 
back to them by the close of business on Friday. The players' chief 
negotiator sees that as a good sign. We're Buoyed by the fact that, 
at least, for the first time, we think that they're inclined, and 
at least they've expressed the willingness, to submit a counter to 
the proposal that we have put forth. The NBA estimates it will lose 
hundreds of millions of dollars in revenues and the players will lose 
a similar amount with just the two weeks that have been canceled.
