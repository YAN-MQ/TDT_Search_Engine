It may not be the standard for measuring an economic downturn. But 
Susan Lisovicz reports on one way New Yorkers are sizing up the slump. 
Six weeks ago a customer at this wine shop on Manhattan's Tony Madison 
avenue bought a couple of bottles of 1870 chateau lafite -- at $10,000 
a pop. But that segment of business has since slowed down considerably. 
I think of the condition of the stock market again. We watch it almost 
on a daily basis, like every other luxury retailer. I think if the 
market proves to be softer through Christmas, we might have to have 
a big warehouse sale in January. This apartment in the Pulitzer mansion 
is on the market for $2.5 million. But the high-end segment is showing 
the most vulnerability to Wall Street's volatile swings. Since August, 
we've had a tremendous adjustment in pricing. And most of it has been 
felt on the upper end of the market, meaning above $1 million. Those 
prices have been reduced on average roughly 10%, and roughly one-third 
of our inventory has been reduced in price. Studies show the stock 
market's dramatic decline is beginning to rein in the lifestyle of 
Americans with incomes of $50,000 and more. And nowhere are those 
changes more visible than in New York. Wall Street accounts for only 
about 5% of the labor force in the New York metro area. But those 
workers make a disproportionate amount of money. Their average salary 
of $172,000 is more than four times what the average worker earns 
in other industries. Which is why high-end restaurants such as the 
four seasons are now considering expanded menus. Delmonico's, located 
in the heart of New York's financial district for 160 years, actually 
closed its doors after the crash of '87. Management at the newly reopened 
restaurant recently made subtle adjustments to the menu. So, we can 
accommodate a wider variety of customers, what we've done is we've 
changed the menu and we've added a lot more pasta dishes and a lot 
more salads. So everyone can come and afford lunch. But lunch may 
be the last thing on diners' minds when the stock market has just 
taken a bite out of them. Susan Lisovicz, "CNN Financial News," New 
York.
