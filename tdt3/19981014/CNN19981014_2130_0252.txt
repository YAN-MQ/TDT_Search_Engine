Yugoslavia is taking the first steps towards ending its crackdown 
in Kosovo as part of a deal with NATO. President Slobodan Milosevic 
has outlined a plan for a separate parliament in Kosovo with local 
elections set for next year. He has until Saturday to withdraw his 
forces and begin peace talks with separatist ethnic Albanians. NATO 
officials meeting in Brussels today said if Milosevic doesn't meet 
the deadline, air strikes remain a real possibility. An advance team 
for a NATO ground verification mission have begun arriving in Kosovo. 
U.S. envoy Richard Holbrooke says he is anxious to get monitors in 
place to ensure Yugoslavia keeps its word. We came to the brink of 
war, the most serious war crisis since the end of the cold war, since 
the height of the cold war. Our warplanes are still standing by on 
the runways in Italy and other places in Europe, ready to go if necessary.
