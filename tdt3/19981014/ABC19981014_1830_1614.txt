Finally this evening, what was the Pope up to last night? We were 
watching the Pope today at his weekly audience in St. Peter's square. 
You notice him looking at his watch? Is it possible he was thinking 
of a nap? The Pope is 78 after all. And he was up very late last night 
watching television. Last night the program door to door was dedicated 
to John Paul. Then the phone rang in the control room. The program's 
anchor, Bruno vespa seemed to be surprised. Hello your Holiness, good 
evening. It was the Pope calling to say thank you for all the tributes. 
By the time he was finished, and the Pope did sound kind of frail, 
Mr. vespa was near tears. "Even journalist have souls," he said. John 
Paul seizing the moment, as he has done so many times. But he did 
sound tired today.
