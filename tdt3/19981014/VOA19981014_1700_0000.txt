Yugoslavia officially accepts an OSCE team on the ground to verify 
the agreement on Kosovo and Britain sends an advanced team to Kosovo 
to monitor the Serb pull out. Nobel Prize winning from Nigeria returns 
home from exile proving that you can indeed go home again. That and 
in the impeachment inquiry on Capitol Hill looks to consolidate the 
charges against the president. The World Wide Web has become the most 
popular component of the international computer network called the 
Internet and we'll have the latest on what's happening with the Web. 
I'm Tom Crosby. And I'm Susan Yawkey. We'll have details of those 
stories, business news, sports, and more all in this hour of VOA News 
Now. First, a summary of world news. I'm Robert Burns, VOA News.
