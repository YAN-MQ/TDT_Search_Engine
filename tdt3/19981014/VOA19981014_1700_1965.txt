..Israeli leaders open a summit in Washington tomorrow. US spokesman 
say the goal is to get the two sides to break their deadlock on Israel's 
next pullback from the West Bank and security issues. They also hope 
to set the stage for final status negotiations. Most of the summit 
work will be done away from the media spotlight at a secluded conference 
center outside of Washington.
