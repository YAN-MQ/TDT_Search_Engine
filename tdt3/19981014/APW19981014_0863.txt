The Angolan army said Wednesday it killed 93 soldiers of the former 
rebel movement UNITA in clashes in the north of the country, further 
demonstrating the weakness of the country's four-year-old peace pact. 
UNITA, however, denied there had been fighting between the two sides 
and claimed the government had sent its forces on ``a manhunt'' against 
UNITA supporters in the area. Both sides' claims underline the prevailing 
mutual hostility as the United Nations struggles to prevent the 1994 
peace pact, which ended a two-decade civil war, from collapsing. The 
deputy commander of government forces in province, Tome Neto, said 
his troops killed the UNITA soldiers during fighting near the city 
of Uije on Tuesday. UNITA secretary-general Paulo Lukamba Gato said 
there was no combat between the former foes. ``It's a manhunt, not 
war,'' Lukamba Gato said by telephone from UNITA's central highland 
stronghold Bailundo. Government forces killed or jailed anyone who 
said they were loyal to UNITA leader Jonas Savimbi, Lukamba Gato alleged. 
The U.N. spokesman in Luanda said he had no information about fighting 
in Uije province. ``It's very difficult to cross-check'' the reports 
of fighting, spokesman Hamadoun Toure said. ``There are no independent 
sources of information.'' The U.N. over the past four years has scaled 
down its peace monitoring force in the huge southwest African nation 
from 7,000 to just 800. The Security Council is to decide Thursday 
on Secretary-General Kofi Annan's proposal to extend the U.N. mandate 
in Angola to April. UNITA refuses to hand over its central highland 
strongholds to the government, claiming government troops and police 
have committed human rights abuses in areas already handed over. The 
government claims UNITA has kept a guerrilla army hidden in the bush 
in contravention of the peace accord.
