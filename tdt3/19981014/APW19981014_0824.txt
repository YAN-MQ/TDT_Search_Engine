Former army chief of staff Gen. Pavao Miljavac was appointed defense 
minister Wednesday to succeed recently resigned Andrija Hebrang, a 
presidential statement said. Ivica Kostovic, a deputy premier, was 
promoted to chief of President Franjo Tudjman's bureau, replacing 
Hrvoje Sarinic, who has also stepped down. The sudden reshuffle comes 
amid a growing crisis within Tudjman's ruling Croatian Democratic 
Union, which is rankled by an internal power struggle between nationalists 
and reformers. Hebrang resigned unexpectedly Monday in a demonstration 
against resistance from hard-liners thwarting implementation of reforms 
he designed for the Defense Ministry. The Croatian army has yet to 
adapt to a postwar state following Croatia's war with rebel Serbs. 
Hebrang, who vowed to reorganize the army along NATO standards, enjoyed 
the support of international officials in his endeavor. Sarinic, who 
has been a loyal presidential aid since the authoritarian leader rose 
to power in 1991, also broke ties with Tudjman in a sign of protest 
against growing right-wing tendencies within the party. Gen. Pavao 
Miljavac is the first minister to have risen from army ranks to hold 
the nation's top military post. It is unclear whether he will continue 
Hebrang's reforms. Ivica Kostovic, a mild-spoken phsycian, was expected 
to add some balance to the government. Nationalists, who nevertheless 
seemed to have tipped the scales in their favor with the new moves, 
are suspicious of pro-western ideas, while the reformers are more 
open toward integration into European economic and political structures.
