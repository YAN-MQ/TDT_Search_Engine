The Chicago bears are one of three teams that are interested in talking 
with Kerry Collins, but at a savings. The quarterback was waived by 
Carolina yesterday, six days after taking himself out of the starting 
lineup. He told coach Dom capers his heart wasn't in it. The 1-5 bears 
will wait until Collins clears waivers so they don't have to pick 
up the rest of his $1.5 million contract.
