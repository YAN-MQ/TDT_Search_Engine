Brazil's football team, still ranked number one in the world despite 
losing the World Cup Final to France this year, is in Washington for 
a friendly match against Ecuador Wednesday night. VOA Sports Editor 
Park Brewer reports. Most Brazilian football plans still find it hard 
to believe their team failed to get its fifth World Cup title in July 
and getting shutout 3 to 0 made it more humiliating. Now, Brazil has 
a new coach. Evanderla Lewschemberger was appointed in August, replacing 
Mario Zegallo. In his debut, the Brazilians tied Yugoslavia 1 to 1 
September 23rd and he was pleased with his team's style of play. Star 
Striker Renaldo was missing for this match because of his health, 
but Striker Elbar Vanomunich is back as is Flavio Concecel of Spain's 
Deportiva Lacurula. Coach Lewschemberger told reporters here this 
game against Ecuador is one for analyzing players. He has installed 
veteran Kafu as his new captain. The defender says he won't change 
the way he approaches the game. As for the Ecuadorians, their roster 
features rising 19-year old Forward Evan Cavelatist and a number of 
Mexican league veterans. Ecuador has never beaten Brazil in its 60-year 
history. Park Brewer, VOA Sports, Washington.
