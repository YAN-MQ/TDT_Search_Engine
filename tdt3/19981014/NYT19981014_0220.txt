According to A.C. Nielsen, kids are watching less television. That 
could be because they're playing video games that laugh at television. 
Witness Gex: Enter the Gecko, a ``Simpsons''-style send-up of Hollywood 
played out by a wisecracking lizard with encyclopedic knowledge of 
1970s sitcoms. Gex is introduced as the ultimate couch potato, content 
to begin every day ``sharing a cup of coffee with kung fu theater, 
a doughnut with his favorite cartoons and a bag of chips with `His 
Majesty's Secret Service.' Days, then weeks, blurred into one long 
television marathon.'' The remote control idyll is, alas, interrupted 
by secret agents who kidnap the happily complacent lizard and send 
him on a mission to defeat Rez, a robotic fiend who is out to steal 
all the world's television shows. So, as they say on ``Masterpiece 
Theater,'' we find young Gex in the Media Dimension, a temple-like 
complex where gigantic televisions stand like monoliths and function 
as portals into different game levels, all parodies of various film 
and television genres. There's the Pre-History Channel; Scream TV, 
which gleefully skewers B-grade horror flicks; Gexzilla (the dinosaur 
is purple, for some mysterious reason); the Rocket Channel, which 
lampoons 30 years of television science fiction; Kung Fu Theater; 
Gilligex Island, and Toon TV, which lovingly roasts Warner Brothers 
cartoons. The list, as they say, goes on and on. In the process of 
navigating these environments, collecting power-ups and fighting monsters, 
Gex mimics everyone from Austin Powers (``Judo chop, baby!''), James 
Bond and Maxwell Smart to George Jetson, Al Pacino (``Hoo-ha!''), 
Robert De Niro, Richard Simmons, Charlton Heston, Bruce Lee, Forrest 
Gump and the entire cast of ``Star Trek'' and the Star Wars trilogy. 
Every video game has a final showdown. But this is the only one where 
the archvillain's voice booms, ``I'm your father, Gex!'' shortly before 
he expires. And it's one of the few that laugh at video games themselves 
(``Oooh, ahh, this is how it always starts. Then there's the running 
and jumping and screaming and power-ups.'') In this sense, Gex is 
the video game equivalent of ``The Simpsons'' or ``Mystery Science 
Theater 3000'': pop culture that comments on pop culture. And it raises 
a couple of interesting questions about literacy. The first is a generational 
question because this is a product for the second generation of video 
game kids, who are now between the ages of 8 and 15. But it was produced 
by the first generation of video game kids, the ones who grew up watching 
1970s television. So when Gex whizzes through a bonus round singing, 
``Lolly Lolly Lolly get your adverbs here!'' or picks up hockey mask 
power-ups in the haunted house or leaves the kung fu level growling, 
``C'mon, Jake, it's Chinatown,'' it may not mean anything to the current 
crop of grade-schoolers. But maybe, with all the Nickelodeon flashbacks 
and meta-media floating around, we have reached a point when, ``Who 
loves ya, baby,'' can mean something to kids who have never seen ``Kojak.'' 
It meant something to me, and I never saw ``Kojak.'' I've never seen 
a Jerry Lewis movie, but I laughed when Gex yelled, ``Hey, lady!'' 
while pummeling a poltergeist. And I knew why. It's a cliche that 
pop culture is ephemeral. But bits and pieces of it are actually quite 
durable, if not indestructible. After enough recycling, any piece 
of Hollywood or Madison Avenue flotsam becomes a part of the cultural 
landscape (or landfill, depending on your politics), and the ability 
to thrive on that landscape requires a certain kind of literacy. The 
digital landscape also requires a kind of literacy. There are people 
who don't play video games who could catch every reference Gex drops 
while traversing the Media Dimension. But they would be hard pressed 
to traverse it themselves because they don't know how a video game 
controller works. They can't navigate. They don't know how to uncover 
the useful things and avoid the traps and solve the puzzles. They 
can't perceive the leaping points. The signs don't make sense to them. 
They get stuck because they can't read. But they'd probably get a 
kick out of watching someone else play _ this is a game that even 
the console-illiterate can enjoy. Part of the reason it's fun to watch 
is the camera angles, which are largely controllable. And somehow, 
being able to control the video game camera throws television and 
movie camera conventions into high relief. If you do nothing, the 
camera will act like the camera in an action movie or a sitcom or 
whatever genre you happen to be visiting. One scene from the Looney 
Tune level, for instance, is viewed from high above, as if you're 
staring down into Wile E. Coyote's canyon. And you realize, aha, that's 
a Warner Brothers cartoon camera angle. In the middle of a classic 
B-grade horror scene, you recognize that this is how screamers are 
shot. And then you can change it because you need the camera looking 
over your shoulder to set up the sight line for a tricky series of 
leaps. It's a power trip, controlling the camera in an environment 
so suffused with television. But even so, the relationship between 
video games and television is tense and complicated here. Gex takes 
plenty of shots at Hollywood _ the junkyard bonus round has him sneering, 
``Ladies and gentlemen, the new fall TV season.'' But without television, 
Gex would lose most of the one-liners that fuel the game's fun quotient. 
Gex earns extra lives by smashing televisions. But he's also trying 
to save television from the cyborg villain who's trying to steal it 
(paging Bill Gates . . . ). Even though Gex isn't a television character, 
this whole experience plays out on a television screen. It's a console 
game, and consoles are viable only because televisions are everywhere. 
Video games have always had a parasitic relationship with television. 
The tube has given them a warm body in which to breed. And after 25 
years, they are beginning to impinge on the host. Or, as Gex would 
say, ``I'll take New Levels for 20, Alex.'' Developed by Crystal Dynamics, 
published by Midway for Playstation, $44.99, and Nintendo 64, $59.99; 
recommended for all ages.
