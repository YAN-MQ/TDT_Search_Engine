Ethnic Albanians may not be the only victims of the Serb crackdown 
in Kosovo. Two independent newspapers say authorities are trying to 
control the flow of information in the Yugoslav province. Brent Sadler 
reports. President Slobodan Milosevic telling, Yugoslav's he's agreed 
a peaceful solution to the Kosovo crisis. The next day, Serb police 
shut down two independent newspapers in Belgrade. Guilty, say the 
authorities, of reporting NAto threats, creating an atmosphere of 
alarm and defeatism, this one banner headline condemned the widely 
read "daily telegraph" to closure. It reads -- "NATO has approved 
attack. Milosevic accepts plan." By tightening his grip on the flow 
of information, say western observers, President Milosevic is attempting 
to further isolate Serbs to curtail press freedom and stifle internal 
debate over the concessions he's just made over Kosovo. I am sure 
they are trying to use what remains of the emergency to somehow finish 
with us with most of the independent media. The government says closures 
might be reviewed if NATO lifts the threat of air strikes. But NatO's 
loaded gun is still on the table until Saturday at least. Effective 
international verification of Yugoslav actions is nowhere near ready. 
KLA is armed, KLA is against any agreement, KLA is for armed struggle 
against Serbia and anyone who is against a free Kosovo, so there shall 
be a problem. The verifiers are expected to play an impartial role, 
but analysts worry those verifiers could easily be drawn into the 
conflict themselves. There is the danger that if either side feels 
in a sense betrayed that they could try and use the observers as pawns 
or as hostages or try and create provocation. In Kosovo, itself, nothing 
much seems to have changed since the new deal. Refugees are still 
marooned and there have been no major withdrawals of army or police 
forces. Brent Sadler, CNN, Belgrade.
