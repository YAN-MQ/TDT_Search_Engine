About 300 student protesters marched through downtown Jakarta Wednesday, 
demanding that President B.J. Habibie lower skyrocketing food prices 
or resign. The group walked down the main street after police and 
troops blocked them from marching to Parliament. Inflation has pushed 
up the prices of many basic foods as Indonesia endures it worst economic 
crisis in decades. In a separate demonstration, another 30 students 
scuffled with security officers outside the Defense Ministry. The 
demonstrators were demanding that the armed forces investigate a string 
of murders in eastern Java. At least 153 people, many of them Muslim 
clerics or those accused of practicing black magic, have been killed 
by mobs or gangs in the past three months. Many complain the armed 
forces haven't done enough to quell the violence. There were no reports 
of injuries or arrests following Wednesday's protests, which caused 
long traffic jams. Habibie took power from President Suharto in May 
after the former leader ended 32 years of autocratic rule and resigned 
following a wave of protests and riots. ``Suharto has to be put on 
trial,'' students chanted Wednesday. Since Suharto's departure, Habibie 
has promised to institute democratic reforms and fix the ailing economy. 
However, many say he is not doing enough to address Indonesia's dire 
problems. Student protests against his presidency have become almost 
a daily event in Jakarta.
