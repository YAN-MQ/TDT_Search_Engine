In the most painful of a series of recent belt-tightening moves, The 
Miami Herald's top editors said Tuesday that the newspaper's Sunday 
feature magazine, Tropic, would close before year's end. The newspaper's 
executive editor, Douglas Clifton, said the move would save at least 
$2 million annually, more than half of which would be used to beef 
up the sports and business pages. Earlier this year, the newspaper, 
which has used its geographical base to become a showplace for news 
from the Caribbean region, closed its international edition, which 
was distributed to population centers in Latin America and the Caribbean. 
The Herald, which is owned by Knight Ridder Inc., has also shut down 
bureaus in Israel and Brazil. Tropic, which had been among the most 
high-profile members of the dwindling club of Sunday magazines, is 
where the humor columnist Dave Barry rose to prominence. (His column 
will still be published in the Sunday newspaper.) Over its 30-year 
history, the magazine has published work that won three Pulitzer Prizes. 
But like many Sunday magazines, which began to lose their lucrative 
color advertising to special pre-printed advertising sections, Tropic 
had long been a money-loser, Clifton said. ``When I got here in 1985,'' 
said Tom Shroder, executive editor of Tropic, ``I was told, `You're 
taking a job at a place that might not be here six months from now.''' 
Elinor Brecher, a feature writer who just finished a four-month stint 
at Tropic, said the decision had had a more profound impact on the 
newsroom than other cuts. When a foreign bureau is eliminated, she 
said, ``there are always wire services.'' ``This is much closer to 
home,'' Ms. Brecher said. Clifton said Tuesday that the five-member 
staff would have new jobs in other departments of the newspaper. Shroder 
has been hired as the Style section editor at The Washington Post. 
``We will continue to do the long stories that we habitually run in 
the Sunday paper,'' Clifton said Tuesday in a telephone interview. 
``Now we'll just have a different venue for them.''
