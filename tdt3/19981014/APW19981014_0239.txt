Toppled Premier Romano Prodi stood a chance Wednesday to get his job 
back at least long enough to guide Italy through the debut of the 
euro _ but first he had to prove he had a coalition strong enough 
to govern. Lacking the support of the far-left Communist party which 
had been his ally, Prodi is counting on the centrist party of former 
President Francesco Cossiga to secure the votes he needs for a majority. 
Prodi and Cossiga met early Wednesday to see if they could find common 
ground. Prodi insists he won't lead a new government unless it sticks 
to the same cost-cutting policies as his old one. Cossiga wants a 
say in Cabinet choices.. President Oscar Luigi Scalfaro offered back 
the premiership to Prodi on Tuesday, five days after Prodi's center-left 
government collapsed. It lost a vote of confidence in the Chamber 
of Deputies by a single ballot, with the surprise defection of a lawmaker 
in his own coalition. Prodi, whose government is Italy's second-longest 
since World War II, stayed on as interim premier at Scalfaro's request. 
The political crisis was brought on when the Communist Refoundation 
party withdrew its support over the proposed 1999 budget, saying it 
didn't do enough to create jobs. The move divided the Communists. 
One faction broke away; its leader, Armando Cossutta, said Tuesday 
he would support a second mandate for Prodi. But Prodi would still 
need Cossiga's centrist votes to reach a majority. Some political 
leaders talked of limiting Prodi to just three months, which would 
let him shepherd through the 1999 budget and get through the January 
start of the common European currency that had been a goal of his 
2 1/2-year-old government. But Scalfaro said the constitution forbid 
him from limiting Prodi's new stint to just three months. Scalfaro 
called the budget talks all-important. Italy ``must not waste the 
opportunity won when it qualified for European monetary union,'' he 
said. Opposition forces, led by former Premier Silvio Berlusconi, 
insisted the only proper choice was new parliamentary elections, 2 
1/2 years early. ``When a government loses its majority it must give 
the power of choice back to the citizens,'' Berlusconi insisted. Berlusconi 
expressed disgust Tuesday at the behind-the-scenes political wrangling. 
``This is a farce,'' he said. Prodi himself declared at a public appearance 
Sunday he would tolerate no under-the-table deals to form a new majority. 
He pounded his fist in the air at the suggestion, roaring into the 
microphone, ``No! No!'' There was no immediate indication when a new 
vote of confidence might come. Prodi shrugged off reporters questions 
about how long he would haggle with potential allies. ``Seven months,'' 
he snapped. ``Seven years.''
