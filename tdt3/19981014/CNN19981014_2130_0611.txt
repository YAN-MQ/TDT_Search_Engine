Researchers in Nevada say they've developed a simple instrument that 
could help prevent future bombing at U.S. embassies. Rusty Dornin 
has more in this edition of "tech trends." If this truck speeding 
across the Nevada desert was loaded with a bomb instead of 400 pounds 
of sand, how would you stop it? Researchers say with this -- a macaroni 
necklace of pipe. A barrier they say that could be a major roadblock 
to help prevent this and this from happening again. The bombings in 
Tanzania and Kenya underscored the vulnerability of U.S. facilities 
around the world. Developers of the terrorist vehicle barrier tested 
by Lawrence Livermore laboratory say it's cheap, and it works. This 
is round, steel pipe, which is available around the world, with a 
steel cable down the middle. It's loose, seems loose and flimsy, but 
it's very debilitating to a vehicle. Researchers say keeping this 
away from the building is half the battle. If it does detonate, you 
want to to be far away. Distance is your best Ally. You want to keep 
is far away. Even with the recent bombers, the U.S. is reluctant to 
turn them into fortresses. You don't want to build a fortress that 
turns people away so you have to find a way to build something that's 
generally secure that Nevertheless has an inviting feel to it. Obviously 
it would be tough to put up a necklace of pipe in many of the worlds' 
downtown areas. Developers say the decision to use the barrier would 
have to be on a case by case basis. One case where it might have worked 
well was in the bombing of the military barracks in Beirut in 1983. 
Developers say the barrier will work, they just need enough room to 
use it. Rusty Dornin, CNN, San Francisco.
