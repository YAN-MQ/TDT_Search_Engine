A funny thing is happening right now in mail boxes around this country. 
Third quarter reports are appearing on paper so that American investors, 
about four out of every 10 homes, by the way, can see exactly how 
much they lost as the stocks went down. We have a report on this coming 
dynamic and the dangers of it. Our story tonight from NBC news and 
Ron Insana. They're looking at their latest investment statements, 
a 57-year-old in Los Angeles planning for retirement, a 75-year-old 
in Dallas trying to preserve his lifestyle and they're nervous. So 
is this man, aurther levity, chairman of the securities and exchange 
commission, who oversees Wall Street. Are you worried that the individual 
investor after he or she looks at the third quarter statement might 
panic I have enough confidence in America's investors to not consider 
the word panic as part of the process but I am concerned that they've 
never seen this before, they've never experienced a downturn of this 
magnitude. A downturn with the average stock fund dropping about 15% 
the last three months. In August alone, worried investors pulled $11 
billion out of these funds. Rita berens manages her family's finances 
and her husband's cardiology practice. Her big profits that peaked 
in Julie now all but wiped out. I hope it's not going down very much 
further because a lot of people will go down with it. Even Tommy Turner, 
a long-time investor, feels the pinch. Up until recently it's been 
fun. Everything's been going up every day but right now we've taken 
pretty big hits on some of these things. So what should investors 
do? With wild swings in the markets expected to continue, financial 
experts say this is a good time to re-examine your investment plan 
and tolerance for risk. Market swings are a fact of life. If that 
makes you nervous, invest in something more conservative like bonds. 
Review your goals and make sure membership needed noud isn't in the 
market today. And most of all, investors should be realistic. Markets 
by definition go up and down. Stating the out of bounds maybe but 
important to remember after seven years of rising prices. The most 
important factor is neither fall in love or become disenchanted with 
securities. They're pieces of paper. They have to be looked at on 
a regular basis and evaluated in terms of other investment alternatives. 
Not easy with the numbers on the statements getting smaller and smaller.
