A day after he was targeted by gunfire, Kazakstan's former premier 
was charged with a misdemeanor Wednesday, his spokesman said. Aides 
believe both incidents were attempts by the government to block him 
from running in the upcoming presidential election. Akezhan Kazhegeldin 
had just announced his plans to run for president of the Central Asian 
country in January. An official statement was expected Wednesday, 
but Kazhegeldin was shot at while riding his horse Tuesday night. 
Kazhegeldin, who was not hurt, went ahead with the official announcement 
that he intended to run. Hours later, he was detained by police, his 
spokesman said. ``The assassination attempt was a warning, at least 
_ but he made the announcement anyway,'' Kazhegeldin's spokesman Igor 
Poberezhkin told The Associated Press. ``The misdemeanor charge is 
clearly connected with the announcement. The government's actions 
are so transparent. It didn't even wait until another day,'' Poberezhkin 
said. Kazhegeldin has been charged with ``participation in the activities 
of an unregistered public association'' for attending a founding meeting 
of the Movement for a Fair Election earlier this month, the spokesman 
said. He was released from detention after the charges were filed. 
``The charge itself is absurd ... no normal country has it,'' Poberezhkin 
said. ``But a public association cannot be registered before it has 
even been founded.'' If convicted, Kazhegeldin would be blocked from 
running for president in the former Soviet republic, Poberezhkin said. 
The trial is scheduled for Thursday. In his statement, Kazhegeldin 
said he was running because he ``cannot put up with the people's impoverishment, 
growing unemployment and the danger of imminent catastrophe,'' the 
Interfax news agency reported. Kazhegeldin resigned in 1997 for health 
reasons. Meanwhile, President Nursultan Nazarbayev's spokesman, Kairat 
Sarybayev, accused Kazhegeldin of circulating reports about the attack 
to boost his popularity before the elections, Interfax reported. Two 
shots were fired at Kazhegeldin on Tuesday night while he was riding 
near Almaty, Kazakstan's main city.
