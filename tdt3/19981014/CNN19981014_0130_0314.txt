In Washington, congressional negotiators met again Tuesday, trying 
to hammer out a budget deal acceptable to the White House. One key 
sticking point is new funding for education. President Clinton wants 
more than a billion dollars to hire more than 100,000 school teachers. 
He underscored his commitment to that issue by visiting an elementary 
school in silver spring, Maryland School is almost out of session 
on Capitol Hill. The members are eager to return home for the election 
holiday, but we haven't finished out our course work yet, and final 
exam has not been passed. And so I say to you, and let me say once 
again, I don't really relish education as a partisan debate, because 
over the long run, that's not good for America. I don't have a clue 
whether these kids' parents are democrats or republicans or independents, 
and frankly I could care less. I want them to have the best. Republicans 
say they agree more money should be spent on education but they think 
it should go directly to local school districts instead of being disbursed 
through federal programs.
