A 20-year-old man will be sentenced today in the killing of a 7-year-old 
girl in a Nevada casino restroom last year. Jeremy strohmeyer admitted 
to kidnapping, molesting and killing sherrice Iverson. The former 
honor student pleaded guilty to first-degree murder just before his 
trial began in September. That helped him avoid a possible death sentence, 
but strohmeyer could still be sent to prison for life.
