National Basketball Association officials have canceled the first 
two weeks of the upcoming season wiping out regular season contests 
for the first time in the league's 52-year old history because of 
a labor dispute. After talks with the player's union stalled Tuesday 
in New York, team owners decided to make the unprecedented announcement 
to break a string of 35,000 games. Commissioner David Stern says a 
business cannot continue if it costs more to run than it makes in 
profits. And in our case, we have a situation where because of the 
amount of salary that's being paid out, the prospect for the economic 
well being of the league is not one of prosperity. The NBA season 
of 82 games per club was due to have begun on November 3rd. The owners 
locked out the players in July saying they could not afford to play 
the season under the existing salary cap. That's sports. I'm Steve 
shy. Thank you, Steve. We'll have another sports update in about one 
hour.
