In other business news, Brazil is preparing an economic adjustment 
package to qualify for credit from the International Monetary Fund 
and halt the drain on the country's dollar reserves. Correspondent 
George Meek reports from Rio De Janeiro, a prominent business leader 
is optimistic about the package. A Brazilian business executive who 
heads the American Chamber of Commerce in Brazil, Joel Korn, says 
the reelection of President Fernando Enrigue Cardozo last week is 
a positive sign for the economy. It offers the opportunity for continuity 
in the economic program. And I think that this time we definitely-the 
country is going to move forward with the overdue fiscal adjustment 
to sustain economic growth and stability. Mr. Korn notes President 
Cardozo was elected for a second four term even though he warned voters 
that there would be hard times ahead as a result of budget cuts and 
perhaps a tax increase. The business leader believes Mr. Cardozo will 
win congressional approval for unpopular reforms. I am confident that 
the congress-the political leaderships in the country are now recognizing 
that there is no other alternative to go but to move on with the adjustment 
to sustain the good standing of the country in the international community. 
Mr. Korn says that despite lower credit ratings for Brazil by services 
such as Moody's multinational corporations are not afraid to put more 
money into the country. The foreign community continues to hold Brazil 
in high regard as far as its potential for longer term for medium 
longer term growth. And the country's undertaking the necessary measures 
especially within the fiscal context to insure sustainability in the 
good achievements that they have. Mr. Korn, a former president of 
the Bank of America in Brazil, predicts that economic adjustment and 
growth can be achieved without a large devaluation of the currency, 
which some analysts say is overvalued. George Meek, VOA News, Rio
