We will bring you part two of Katie couric's sbroo view tomorrow. 
You could accompany your data on its trip overseas the experience 
would be alarming. Local carriers handing it to national carriers 
over to cable carriers... till you don't know who has your data. Unless 
you send it through here. With the one and only company that owns 
the entire network-- local, national, and international. So you know 
who has your data. On-net. From MCI Worldcom. Taking a look at tomorrow 
morning's front pages, specifically one newspaper with two very big 
stories on the front page. The Washington povert, an exclusive. F.A.A. 
recommends massive refit. Huge story from the "post" tonight. The 
federal aviation administration is recommending replacing the insulation 
in every passenger jet in the world. That's about 12,000 aircraft 
that would need to be grounded for some time though not at the same 
time. FAA is concerned about a lot of the heat damage evident in the 
Swissair wreck, for example. It will become effective in about six 
months after the F.A.A. fishes determining the new standards for flammability. 
Openly an outgrowth of the Swissair crash. This is a big deal. Nothing 
to do with wiring but insulation that is in all parts of the fuselage. 
Also, "Washington Post," he has said his daughter might not want him 
to run, but also saying, George W. bush is, that nothing in his own 
past would disqualify him from running for president. 's being mentioned 
these days as front runner for the G.O.P. nomination. San Diego union-tribune, 
padres 5-0 over Atlanta. They're going to the world series. So are 
the New York Yankees. Game one, Saturday in the house that Ruth built 
in the Bronx, New York. And there is the winning catch. And the celebration. 
San Diego padres headed to the big show. A reminder, "me and again" 
follows this broadcast here on NBC, with Jane pauley. And that is 
our broadcast for this Wednesday night. We hope to see you right back 
here at this same time tomorrow night.
