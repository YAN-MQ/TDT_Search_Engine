Right after cutting a deal with U.S. negotiators to end the Kosovo 
crisis, President Slobodan Milosevic launched a major crackdown on 
his Serb opponents by silencing two independent Belgrade dailies. 
Serbian police late Tuesday stormed the offices of Dnevni Telegraf 
and Danas, both critical of Milosevic's government, and shut them 
down for allegedly violating a recent government decree that required 
self-censorship at a time of NATO threats.
