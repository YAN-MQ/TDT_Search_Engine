U.S. Vice-President, Al Gore, has announced a plan to save Florida 
Wetlands known as The Everglades from urban development. The program, 
worth almost 8 million dollars provides for a network of levies and 
canals that will improve water storage and distribution systems. Ecologists 
say the everglades is threatened by active land development in the 
surrounding area which is spurred by rapid population growth. The 
current water distribution system was designed fifty years ago for 
two million people. South Florida's current population is more than 
six million. Vice President Gore says the project will help strengthen 
both the Florida environment and the states economy.
