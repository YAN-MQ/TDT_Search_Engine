A German airman was buried Wednesday, 56 years after his bomber crashed 
during a World War II raid on Britain. About 200 people, including 
representatives of 20 veterans' groups, paid their respects at the 
morning service for Heinrich Richter at Thornaby cemetery near Middlesbrough, 
225 miles (360 km) north of London. Richter's Luftwaffe Dornier plunged 
to the ground and blew up in January 1942 during an attack on an ironworks 
near Middlesbrough. The bodies of three of the four men in the plane 
were recovered immediately and buried at Thornaby. Then, last year, 
a number of human bones eventually identified as Richter's were found 
alongside aircraft wreckage by workers laying drains.
