When the New York Yankees obtained third baseman Scott Brosius from 
the Oakland Athletics in a trade for Kenny Rogers and cash late last 
year, many Yankee fans didn't know who he was. They know now. With 
a three-run homer off Charles Nagy in the third inning for a 6-0 Yankee 
lead on Tuesday night, Brosius produced what proved to be the decisive 
run in the Yankees' 9-5 victory that won the American League pennant 
in the sixth game of their championship series with the Cleveland 
Indians. ``It was just a first-pitch fastball,'' Brosius was saying 
now in the Yankee clubhouse. ``The ball just jumped off my bat.'' 
All around him, the Yankees were shaking Champagne bottles, then pointing 
them at their teammates and spraying them with fizz. ``This is what 
you think about doing from the time you're a little kid,'' said Brosius, 
who like his teammates was wearing an ``American League champions'' 
white T-shirt along with his pinstriped uniform pants. ``I'm just 
excited to be a part of this whole thing, and then to contribute makes 
it extra special.'' For the ALCS, Brosius batted .300 (6 for 20) with 
6 runs batted in. Including the division series sweep of the Texas 
Rangers, his overall post-season average is .333 (10 for 30) with 
9 runs batted in, the most of any Yankee. ``When we made the deal 
for Brosius, we didn't know what to expect; we hadn't seen that much 
of him,'' said Joe Torre, the Yankee manager. ``We never dreamed how 
well he played defensively until we saw him every day.'' In the sixth 
inning, Brosius made a sparkling play to throw out Sandy Alomar. ``If 
he doesn't get Alomar,'' Torre said, ``who knows how that inning goes. 
Then he went to second on the short wild pitch in the bottom of the 
inning. Those are things you can't teach. He's been an integral part 
of this club.'' In the ninth inning, Brosius dove across the third-base 
line, snatched Enrique Wilson's leadoff grounder and threw him out 
_ typical of the almost flawless defense he has provided at third 
base throughout the regular season. Batting eighth or ninth, he drove 
in a total of 98 runs. The Yankees will open the World Series on Saturday 
night at Yankee Stadium against the National League winner, either 
San Diego or Atlanta. ``One more step to go,'' Brosius said, alluding 
to the Series. ``After the season we had, to go through two steps 
like we did, now we have to get through the final step.'' Asked if 
the Yankees now were relieved to have won the pennant after the relative 
ease of their record 114 victories during the season, Brosius shook 
his head. ``There's no sense of relief at all,'' he said. ``There's 
just joy at winning the pennant.''
