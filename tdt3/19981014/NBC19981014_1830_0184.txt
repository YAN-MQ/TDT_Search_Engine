Other news out of Washington. The attorney general and the FBI have 
confirmed that Eric Robert Rudolph is now officially the suspect in 
the centennial park bombings at the Olympic games in Atlanta. More 
on that from NBC's Pete Williams. More than two years after the explosion 
that rattled centennial park in Atlanta at the Olympics, killing one 
person and injuring more than 100 more, authorities today filed formal 
charges against the man they now believe planted that bomb -- Eric 
Robert Rudolph. He's also charged today with two other Atlanta bombings, 
at an abortion clinic early last year and at a gay nightclub a month 
after that. This United States distick court arrest warrant for Eric 
Robert Rudolph moves us one step closer to ending the campaign of 
violence that began over two years ago. Authorities also released 
this new picture of Rudolph, dressed the way they believe he was the 
night of the Olympic bombing. Federal agents, much of their case is 
based on new physical evidence. They now claim, for example, that 
the same kind of gunpowder used to make the Olympic pipe bomb was 
found among Rudolph's possessions where he lived in North Carolina. 
And investigators suggested today that Rudolph made threats in the 
past. We are constantly developing new evidence, new forensic conclusions. 
A lot of the evidence is historical, so we feel that there's great 
progress being made there. Rudolph has already been charged with another 
bombing, at an abortion clinic in Birmingham last January. The explosion 
killed an off-duty policeman. And investigators tell NBC news they 
now believe Rudolph used a remote detonator, watching his victim approach, 
then pressing the button. An assassination, one agent called it. Since 
January, Rudolph has been on the run, hiding, investigators believe, 
in the rugged and densely wooded country near his western North Carolina 
home. Now, federal agents hope the Olympic charges will erase any 
reputation he might have as simply a clinic bomber motivated by ideology. 
We think it does paint a picture that is different from just someone 
who might have anti-abortion feelings. Investigators tell NBC news 
that every spot Rudolph's known to have been the past several months 
shows traces of explosives, suggesting he's still dangerous. Pete 
Williams, NBC news, Washington.
