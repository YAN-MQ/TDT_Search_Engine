Counting down toward its Kosovo deadline, NATO warned on Wednesday 
that Slobodan Milosevic isn't doing what he must to avoid airstrikes 
and ethnic Albanian refugees voiced reluctance to return home out 
of fear of Serb forces. Even as the U.N. refugee agency resumed aid 
convoys, there was much doubt the Yugoslav president would meet demands 
and stop hostilities toward ethnic Albanians. Demonstrating that it's 
not taking him at his word, NATO positioned warplanes at bases in 
Italy for possible air attacks on Serbia. ``NATO airstrikes have not 
yet been averted by Milosevic,'' said an official at the alliance's 
headquarters in Brussels, Belgium, speaking on condition of anonymity. 
``We'll be keeping up the military pressure for some time to come.'' 
Milosevic reluctantly agreed Monday to the demands of world leaders 
determined to halt his seven-month offensive against separatist ethnic 
Albanians and fearful of tragedy involving tens of thousands of refugees 
still living in the open as winter approaches. But even before the 
2,000 international monitors to check on his compliance are in place, 
it's clear Milosevic has still not met at least one key demand: withdrawing 
his forces to where they were before the crackdown in the Serbian 
province began on Feb. 28. The 16 NATO members have given Milosevic 
until Saturday to comply fully or face a renewed threat of airstrikes. 
The official in Brussels said a number of Yugoslav units remain dug 
in in Kosovo and must be withdrawn, including what he called one ``notorious'' 
special police unit from Nis, Serbia. He declined to say how many 
troops remain in the province but said they far exceed the level required 
by NATO. U.S. State Department spokesman James Rubin said Western 
monitoring teams reported a much smaller Serb police presence in Kosovo 
on Wednesday as well as evidence of signs of refugees returning. But 
he called the early assessment of Milosevic's compliance efforts ``a 
mixed bag,'' and said the monitoring force is needed to ensure that 
police aren't just being moved around or hidden. The advance party 
of the ``ground verification mission'' _ the final concession by Milosevic 
needed to seal an agreement after over a week of intense negotiations 
with U.S. envoy Richard Holbrooke _ arrived in Kosovo from neighboring 
Macedonia on Wednesday. The several dozen Americans, Canadians and 
Europeans had been evacuated Monday. But the Organization for Security 
and Cooperation in Europe, which is responsible for the monitoring 
mission, says it may take weeks to recruit the needed personnel from 
its 54 member nations. ``I'm worried that the international community 
will be too slow and leisurely in getting them there, and they'll 
take six months to get there when we need them there in six days or 
at least six weeks,'' Holbrooke said in an interview with CNN. In 
Geneva, Switzerland, the U.N. refugee agency said it had resumed aid 
convoys, which were suspended Monday for fear of Serb attacks if NATO 
launched airstrikes. Many refugees are still in hiding in Kosovo, 
fearing reprisals from Serb special police who have torched their 
villages and been accused of atrocities against civilians _ not just 
rebel fighters fighting for Kosovo's independence. ``Until the NATO 
planes fly here, Milosevic will say whatever people want to hear,'' 
said Hajdin Mehmeti, a 70-year-old refugee in the forested hamlet 
of Baks, northwest of Pristina. ``One hundred times he has lied.'' 
Another refugee, Maher Shpati, said unarmed monitors could not do 
the job. ``They must be soldiers, like in Bosnia,'' he said, referring 
to the NATO peacekeeping force in that former Yugoslav republic. British 
Foreign Secretary Robin Cook warned that NATO would be watching closely 
for evidence of compliance and that Milosevic should take alliance 
warnings seriously. ``We don't trust President Milosevic, let's be 
clear about that,'' Cook told BBC radio. ``The united consensus within 
NATO that we were ready to take military action was there at the beginning 
of the week, is still there and that decision is still on the table. 
We can reactivate these plans any time we feel it is necessary to 
do so.'' In addition to withdrawing forces, allowing the monitoring 
force and helping refugees return, Milosevic must show serious efforts 
toward restoring the autonomy he stripped from Kosovo in 1989. The 
Serb government took a step toward that late Tuesday, outlining a 
plan for a separate parliament and saying Kosovo Albanians would have 
their own parliament, judiciary and police. Milosevic has portrayed 
his handling of the Kosovo crisis as a victory. On Wednesday similar 
success claims were made in Moscow, Belgrade's major ally, which led 
international opposition to use of force against Yugoslavia. ``Look 
how they respect Russia in the world,'' Prime Minister Yevgeny Primakov 
told Russian lawmakers. ``We must knock on wood, but it appears there 
will be no airstrikes.''
