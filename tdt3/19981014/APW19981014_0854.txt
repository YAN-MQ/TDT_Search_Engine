In an attempt to defuse tensions with neighboring Iran, Afghanistan's 
reclusive Taliban leader Mullah Mohammed Omar promised Wednesday to 
release ``all Iranian nationals which are still in Afghanistan.'' 
An estimated 50 Iranians are believed to be in custody since being 
captured when the Taliban overran the northern Afghan city of Mazar-e-Sharif 
in August. During the bloody takeover of its opponents' stronghold, 
renegade Taliban troops killed eight Iranian diplomats and a journalist, 
launching a dangerous standoff along the border. Omar made the promise 
to U.N. special envoy Lakhdar Brahimi during negotiations that lasted 
more than three hours in the Taliban's stronghold of Kandahar. The 
Iranian leader also agreed to a meeting with Iran, which Brahimi said 
``needs to take place urgently.'' While the venue is not set, both 
Iran and the Taliban appear willing to meet either in Saudi Arabia, 
where the Organization of Islamic Conference is based, or at U.N. 
offices in New York, Geneva or Vienna. ``I really believe we do have 
a good bases to start to defuse the tensions between the Islamic Republic 
of Iran and the Taliban,'' Brahimi said. Brahimi is the first envoy 
of the U.N. secretary-general to meet face-to-face with Omar, the 
man who has undisputed control over the hard-line Taliban movement, 
which rules 90 percent of Afghanistan. In a statement upon his return 
from Kandahar to Pakistan, Brahimi said: ``I think we covered a lot 
of ground''. An exception was made to the U.N. travel ban on Afghanistan 
to let Brahimi go to Kandahar to try to defuse the tensions on the 
Afghan border with Iran, where more than 270,000 Iranian troops are 
deployed and backed up by hundreds of tanks and scores of fighter 
jets. The United Nations pulled its international staff out of Afghanistan 
on Aug. 21 after an Italian U.N. worker was killed and a second worker 
wounded in apparent retaliation for the U.S. missile attack on suspected 
terrorist camps in eastern Afghanistan. According to Brahimi Omar 
condemned the killing of the Iranian diplomats and vowed to find the 
culprits, who ``will receive their just retribution.'' In Taliban-ruled 
territory convicted murderers are publicly executed, the hands of 
thieves are amputated and violators of lesser crimes are publicly 
beaten. The punishments, the Taliban say are in line with Islamic 
teachings. According to Brahimi, Omar ``sincerely regretted the deaths 
of the diplomats sympathizing with the families of victims. Because 
of his own experience and the experience of all Afghans he understands 
very well their feelings.'' After 20 years of relentless fighting, 
Brahimi said there is not an Afghan family that has not suffered a 
death. The former ambassador of Algeria said upon his arrival in Kandahar 
earlier Wednesday he was taken ``to a very sad place'' where several 
fresh graves were visible and ``many bodies'' were waiting to be buried. 
He said the sight, one he would not soon forget, only reinforces the 
urgency of a peaceful end to the bloodletting devastating Afghanistan 
and dividing its people.
