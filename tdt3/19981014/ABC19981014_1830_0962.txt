In Washington tomorrow, President Clinton is going to try once again 
to wrestle the Israeli and Palestinian leaders into a peace settlement 
that has meaning for both of them. There is already a peace agreement 
on the table, but this Israeli government and the Palestinians are 
dangerously behind on implementing it. Here is our Middle East correspondent, 
Gillian Findlay. If you want to understand Palestinian anger or the 
disillusionment many Israelis feel as peace seems to evaporate here, 
consider what has not been achieved in the five years since the handshake 
on the White House lawn. Those who negotiated the deal say by now 
the Palestinians themselves should control most of the West Bank. 
Today, Palestinians have partial control over 27% of the land, full 
control over just 3%. The peace agreement also promised the Palestinians 
their own airport. It's there, but for what it says are security concerns, 
Israel has not allowed a single plane to use it. It's the same argument 
it's used to prevent a Palestinian industrial park from opening, a 
Palestinian port from being built and to keep thousands of Palestinians 
from traveling freely. And all of that was supposed to be the easy 
part. The really tough issues -- who controls the city of Jerusalem, 
how to deal with the millions of Palestinian refugees, what to do 
about all those Jewish Settlements Israel has been building -- all 
of those were supposed to have been settled by next may. Seven months 
to go and those talks haven't even started. So that deadline, May 
5th to be exact, has many Israelis and Palestinians worried. The Palestinian 
authority had said repeatedly that if there's no deal by then, it 
will declare a Palestinian state. The 5th of may is our right to say 
finish. The interim agreement is finished. This is the new reality. 
Some Israeli government ministers are already saying if the Palestinians 
do that, Israel will take back land not give it away. And that will 
make next may and the months that follow a very dangerous time. Gillian 
Findlay, ABC News, Jerusalem.
