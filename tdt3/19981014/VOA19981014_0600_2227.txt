Two soldiers in the North Korean army defected to South Korea today. 
Remarkably they walked across the border. Considered the most heavily 
fortified in the world. John Larken in Seoul reports they traveled 
early in the morning across the border's northeastern portion. South 
Korea's defense ministry identified the defectors as Captain Sok Yong 
Won, a 32-year old male medic and Sgt. Song Yong Son, a 23-year old 
woman who worked as a telephone operator in the North People's Army. 
They were spotted by South Korean border guards and guided them through 
the mind-infested demilitarized zone. Local television networks said 
Captain Sok wore a T-shirt and army pants while Sgt. Song wore military 
fatigues. Their crossing follows a recent defection of a 48-year old 
North Korean man who claimed to be a retired Lt. Col. Shim Shim Bok 
said he crossed third country after being harassed for criticizing 
North Korean leader Kim Jung Il in public. Sgt. Song is the fist female 
soldier to defect to the south since 1974. So far this year, four 
soldiers have defected from North Korea. While most North Koreans 
defect through China, soldiers stationed along the northern side of 
the 260km demilitarized zone usually choose the more direct route. 
In the past 2 years, a dozen soldiers have defected in this way. The 
South Unification Ministry says more than 800 North Koreans have fled 
to South Korea since 1949, one year before war broke out between the 
two Koreas. Defections have increased in recent years as North Koreans 
try to escape crippling food shortages. This is John Larkin, VOA News, 
Seoul.
