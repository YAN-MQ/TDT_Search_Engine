About a month ago, I stopped by Dr. Jim Duke's garden to check out 
the little six-acre spread he calls Herbal Village. Fulton is one 
of those little burgs off the interstate, where the farms have given 
over to ranch houses, with guys out on their power mowers every Saturday, 
riding herd on their lawns. But Duke's place is as different as the 
man himself, who looks more like a 69-year-old hippie, standing barefoot 
by his kudzu vine, than an eminent botanist, with 20 books and 200 
scientific papers under his belt (if he wore one with his cutoffs). 
``My neighbors think I'm crazy for putting in kudzu, but it has more 
genistein than soy,'' said Duke, who is a doctor of botany, as he 
stood in the plot labeled Aphrodisia. ``Genistein is what everybody's 
promoting soy for, to help prevent breast cancer.'' Last August, with 
the help of a few friends, Duke planted about 200 medicinal herbs, 
in 80 plots, each devoted to some disease or ailment. I had a hard 
time not making a beeline for the Wrinkles garden, but Aphrodisia 
wasn't bad. Since when is this an ailment? ``Well, we didn't like 
the word impotence, and nobody liked the word frigidity,'' Duke said 
in the slow, easy voice of a Southerner, fingering the big leaves 
of the vine that ate Alabama, his home state. The Agriculture Department 
imported kudzu from China years ago, for erosion control, and it has 
since climbed over cars and houses all over the South. It's purple 
blossoms, which smell like grape soda, strike fear into the hearts 
of agricultural extension agents. But both men and women may want 
to graze on it, since studies indicate that genistein may help guard 
against prostate as well as breast cancer. ``I make tempura with the 
leaves, and it tastes like deep-fried anything,'' he said. He makes 
Jell-O out of them, too. (Dr. Norman Cragg of the National Cancer 
Institute, however, cautions, ``People should be very careful before 
going into their yards and harvesting plants for which there is no 
toxicity data.'') The same vine is helping alcoholic hamsters at Harvard 
University. When the research scientist Dr. Wing-Ming Keung gave boozer 
rodents an extract of the Chinese herb, it cut their drinking in half. 
Epimedium, known as horny goat weed in the folk literature, grows 
in Aphrodisia, too. ``I'm not responsible for that nomenclature,'' 
he said. ``But the people looking for herbal Viagra like it.'' Duke 
recently retired from 30 years of researching plants for the Agriculture 
Department. Over the years, he has roamed the jungles of Central and 
South America, learning from folk healers and collaborating with the 
National Cancer Institute to identify plants that could prevent or 
treat cancer and other diseases. ``He's a genius,'' said Michael Balick, 
the director of the Institute of Economic Botany at the New York Botanical 
Garden in the Bronx. ``He maintains the highest levels of scholarly 
research. To top it off, he writes poetry and composes music. And 
he's a hell of a nice guy.'' When Duke isn't sampling vines in the 
Peruvian jungles, he's lecturing about the plants that are the origins 
of drugs. Or weeding his herbal ``farmacy,'' which is open to the 
public by appointment (301 498-1175). Nothing is for sale; the plants 
are there to educate. The plantsman spent years compiling ``Dr. Duke's 
Phytochemical and Ethnobotanical Databases'' for the Agricultural 
Research Service (www.ars-grin.gov/duke/), where you can surf for 
everything from folklore to scientific studies to the chemical compounds 
of a particular plant. And his latest book, ``The Green Pharmacy'' 
(Rodale Press, now a St. Martin's paperback), is a chatty guide to 
natural remedies. He speaks to an eager audience. Last year, sales 
of dietary supplements and herbal products totaled $3.6 billion. Sales 
of echinacea were $310 million; ginseng, $270 million; gingko, $240 
million; and St. John's wort, $200 million. ``A lot of people who 
take an herb for an ailment never see the herb growing,'' Duke said, 
moving on to a giant ginger plant, thriving in the Arthritis garden. 
``But if they do a little weeding or pruning, they can bond with their 
plants.'' Long before doctors came along, there were folk healers 
who knew, from their elders, who had learned from their elders, which 
plants were good for you and which could kill. But somewhere along 
the way, we forgot that drugs come from plants. Now, you have to have 
a double-blind study to believe your grandmother when she tells you 
ginger tea eases the pain of her arthritis. But ginger contains anti-inflammatory 
compounds. Another age-old treatment for aching joints is stinging 
nettles, and it grows wild all over Maryland in the spring. Duke, 
who plays bass fiddle in a bluegrass band, says some of his fellow 
musicians gather the stuff (with gloves) and flog their aching fingers 
with it. You can also steam the greens, which are full of boron, and 
they lose their sting, by the way, with the cooking. Duke talks in 
a rambling way that harks back to the Alabama hills. ``By 5,'' he 
said, ``I knew where my temple was _ the forest.'' He led the way 
to a shady little ravine full of maples, oaks, black gum and ash. 
A lone ginseng was growing beneath a giant tulip poplar. In spring, 
May apples carpet these woods. The May apple is the source of a compound 
called etoposide, which has been isolated and synthesized to treat 
lung cancer. Wild yam grows here, as well, and its tuber is the source 
of diosgenin, a compound used to produce synthetic steroids and hormones. 
Imagine the healing powers in the Peruvian rain forest, which has 
50 times the diversity of this Eastern deciduous forest. ``These are 
the plants we've co-evolved with for 25,000 years,'' Duke said, meaning 
that's how long people have grazed on plants in the New World, which 
is an eye blink, compared to Africa, where humans have been grazing 
for 3.5 million years. Back up the hill, in the Depression garden, 
we stared at a floppy little wildflower, called St. John's wort. ``A 
lot of times, to my surprise, my lectures are to doctors,'' he said. 
``Most of them hate it, but their patients are taking these things, 
so they've got to learn. But if I can get 10 physicians I can usually 
get one to say: `You're right, Duke. I don't know for sure that Prozac 
is better than St. John's wort.' Then I can say, `Well, if you're 
not sure, who is?' '' Duke would love to see controlled studies of 
these herbs. As a botanist, he believes that the whole plant is better 
than a ``silver bullet'' from one of its compounds. ``Through our 
co-evolution with these natural compounds, your body has learned to 
exclude the bad and grab the good,'' he said. ``When you give it a 
silver bullet, you don't give it a menu of things. When you give it 
a whole herb, you're giving it thousands of compounds, which it already 
knows and has mechanisms for utilizing or excluding.'' Which is why 
this botanist and gardener trusts St. John's wort more than Prozac. 
So do you make a tea with it? ``I ain't depressed,'' Duke said, sounding 
as peaceful as an Alabama woods. Then he allowed as how friends steep 
the flowers in cheap vodka or white wine. Which would cheer me right 
up.
