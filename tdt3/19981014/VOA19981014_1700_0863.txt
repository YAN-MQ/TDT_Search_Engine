The US congressman leading the Clinton impeachment inquiry says he 
is looking for a way to consolidate charges against the president. 
Paula Wolfson reports Henry Hyde reaffirmed his intention to complete 
the probe by the end of the year. Congressman Hyde seems to be downplaying 
prospects the open-ended inquiry authorized by the US House of Representatives 
could spin out of control. He says he still hopes to finish his probe 
before a new Congress is sworn into office in January. He says to 
meet that goal, the committee will have to focus its attention on 
the core charges against the president. The top lawyer for committee 
Republicans suggested a few weeks ago that the panel might want to 
look into 15 possible impeachable offenses. But, Mr. Hyde indicates 
they may be narrowed down to a more manageable number, perhaps a total 
of only two or three. In a written statement, the Illinois republican 
suggests the committee will look into charges of perjury, obstruction 
of justice, and witness tampering. He makes no mention of any areas 
of inquiry outside the president's efforts to conceal his relationship 
with former White House Intern Monica Lewinsky. His comments are sure 
to be to welcomed buy the White House and congressional Democrats 
who pushed for an impeachment process limited in scope and duration. 
Public opinion polls show the public shares their distaste for a wide-ranging 
impeachment probe and wants the matter settled as soon as possible. 
In his statement, and in an earlier interview with The Washington 
Post, Mr. Hyde acknowledges there is pressure for a speed resolution, 
but he also warns that without cooperation from the Democrats, that 
goal cannot be met. Paula Wolfson, VOA News, Capitol Hill.
