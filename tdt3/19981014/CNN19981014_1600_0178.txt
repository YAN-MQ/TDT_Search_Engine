The Senate has just joined the House of Representatives in passing 
a temporary spending Bill to keep the government in business until 
at least midnight Friday. The White House and republicans are still 
at odds over education and other issues in the $500 billion fiscal 
year budget. They're reportedly close to agreeing on a $1 billion 
program aimed at increasing elementary school teachers by 100,000. 
Democrats say adding teachers is not enough. We need buildings as 
well as teachers. It's not enough simply to have 100,000 teachers. 
We need the school space to go with it to get smaller class size. 
Smaller class size is a function of two things, teachers and physical 
space. So we're going to continue to hold out for both the physical 
space and the teachers in order to solve this very, very urgent national 
challenge that we face in virtually every school district in the country. 
Republicans say it should be left to local school districts to figure 
out how they want education funds spent.
