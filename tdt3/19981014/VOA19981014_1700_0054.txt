Monitors on the ground in Kosovo say Serbian police are departing 
and people are returning their villages in the east. But, US State 
Department Spokesman James Rubin says these are very early reports 
and says it is too soon to tell if President Slodin Milosovic is complying 
with the agreement to bring peace to Kosovo. Meanwhile, NATO is keeping 
the pressure on Mr. Milosovic. The warplanes are ready to strike as 
early as Saturday, if he show signs of non-compliance. US Balkan Envoy 
Richard Holbroke told reporters, "It's been a very serious time for 
Eastern Europe". We came to the brink of war in the last few days 
in Europe, the most serious crisis since the end of the Cold War. 
The planes were on the runway and still are ready to go. Milosovic 
agreed to do three things he's never agreed to before. And so, we 
put the plans on hold. US Envoy Richard Holbroke. Meanwhile, Yugoslavia 
has reissued visas for UN war crimes investigators in Kosovo after 
weeks or refusing to cooperate.
