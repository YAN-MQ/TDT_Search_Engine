Police have seized an estimated 400kg of heroin in a dramatic raid 
early this morning on a ship off the eastern coast of Australia. As 
Andrew Netty reports from Melbourne, 18 people were arrested and the 
operations of a major international drug syndicate have been disrupted. 
The heroin believed to have originated in the Golden Triangle Opium 
Growing Region ordering Burma Thailand has been an estimated street 
value of $252 million dollars. While the exact nationality of those 
arrested remains unclear, police say they include Hong Kong Chinese 
and Indonesian nationals. Australian Federal Police Spokesperson, 
Steve Jeggins says that Wednesday's drug hold is almost four times 
larger than the previous record heroin hold of 123kg made up of the 
remote far northern Australian coast in July 1994. Mr. Jeggins said 
the hold will have a major impact on the Australian's police's war 
against drug trafficking. We've taken 400kg of heroin, uh, off the 
streets and now won't reach the streets and that is a significant 
seizure. In the past, last year, for example, a total Australian seizure 
ran 138kilos. So, in one day, we've taken out more than three times 
that amount. So, that in itself is significant. Secondly, it's clear 
that this syndicate was very sophisticated in having international 
connections and we've now dismantled that syndicate. Over 100 police 
officers took part in the raid. Including members of the recently 
formed Australian Federal Police Drug Strike Team and customs officials 
that got by aerial surveillance and coast guard ships. Police swooped 
in on a small boat carrying the heroin when it landed at a remote 
beach about 300 kg north of Sydney, arresting 7 men. The others were 
arrested when police later boarded a freighter anchored off the coast. 
Police say the freighter was registered in a tiny Central American 
country of Belize and set south for Australia after leaving an undisclosed 
South East Asian port. Police say further arrest are possible as investigations 
continue in Australia and Hong Kong. Andrew Netty for VOA News, Noben.
