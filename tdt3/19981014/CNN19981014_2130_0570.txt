A new study shows children with chronic constipation may be allergic 
to dairy products and soy milk may be the cure. Researchers studied 
65 children under the age of 6 with chronic constipation. They found 
two-thirds of the children improved after they switched to soy milk. 
The researchers caution dairy products are not the problem for all 
children with constipation. The study appears in tomorrow's "New England 
journal of medicine."
