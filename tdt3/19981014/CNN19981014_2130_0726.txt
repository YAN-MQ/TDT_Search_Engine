Top stories are next, followed by "consumer news." And in "lifestyles" 
-- you may not recognize his name, but keb Mo is one of the hardest 
working people in showbiz. Five cents. Five cents. Five cents. AT&T 
5 cent weekends. Now calls from home all weekend long are just 5 cents 
a minute. No, because Tuesday is not a weekend. You see, Saturday 
and Sunday are generally considered the weekend. AT&T 5 cent weekends. 
Yeah, call your friends call your relatives, call everybody you know!
