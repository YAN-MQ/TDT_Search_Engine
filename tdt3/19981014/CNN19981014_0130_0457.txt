Days before a mideast summit in Maryland Israeli prime Minster Benjamin 
Netanyahu says no agreement is possible unless the Palestinian authority 
enforces its security commitments against terrorism. He made those 
remarks after an Israeli was killed and another was wounded in a shooting 
outside Jerusalem. In a statement Netanyahu says, "in light of this 
gloomy reality, there is absolutely no chance, at this stage, of signing 
a peace agreement." In return for Palestinian security guarantees 
Netanyahu has agreed in principle to withdraw forces from an additional 
13% of the West Bank.
