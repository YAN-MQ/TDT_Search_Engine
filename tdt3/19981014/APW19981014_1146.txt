The NATO alliance said Wednesday Yugoslav President Slobodan Milosevic 
was not meeting international demands to restore peace in Kosovo needed 
to stave off airstrikes. One day after setting the clock ticking, 
NATO ambassadors agreed Milosevic must still show he is ending his 
crackdown against Kosovo Albanian separatists by 0500GMT on Saturday 
at the latest. The decision to begin punishing strikes, if necessary, 
``is still totally in effect. NATO airstrikes have not yet been averted 
by Milosevic,'' said a NATO official, who asked not to be identified. 
Compliance with a deal to withdraw forces, begin peace talks with 
ethnic Albanians and allow 2,000 monitors into Kosovo ``has not yet 
been achieved,'' said the NATO official. The official said later, 
after a second meeting of the NATO ambassadors in one day, Tuesday's 
airstrikes order ``will remain in place for the foreseeable future,'' 
i.e. beyond the four-day countdown that expires Saturday. NATO was 
also working on an air reconnaissance plan for Kosovo _ using unarmed, 
high-flying spy planes such as U-2s and P3 Orion aircraft _ to verify 
if Milosevic's respects a peace deal. Russia has expressed an interest 
in joining in the air verification scheme and NATO is considering 
that. NATO Secretary General Javier Solana was considering to go to 
Belgrade Friday to sign the accord and deliver the message that it 
would be in Milosevic's interest not to push NATO around any further 
on Kosovo. Under an agreement worked between U.S. envoy Richard Holbrooke 
and Milosevic, the Yugoslav leader must withdraw special troops from 
Kosovo, allow 2,000 international observers into Kosovo, let NATO 
reconnaissance planes fly over the province and sign a deal by early 
November outlining future talks with the Kosovo's ethnic Albanians, 
who are the vast majority in the Serb province. The Organization for 
Security and Cooperation in Europe is expected to sign a deal Thursday 
in Belgrade to dispatch 2,000 ``compliance verifiers.'' NATO was also 
working on an agreement with Yugoslavia for reconnaissance flights 
over Kosovo to back up the OSCE ground verification mission. NATO's 
16 member nations completed their airstrike plan against Yugoslavia 
early Tuesday by approving an ``activation order'' that formally placed 
hundreds of allied warplanes under the command of the Supreme Allied 
Commander Wesley K. Clark. The order was the last military step NATO 
had to take before actual airstrikes, but NATO gave Milosevic a breathing 
space of four days to agree a deal on Kosovo. The NATO official said 
Milosevic must withdraw forces, saying a ``number of units'' remain 
dug in, notably the ``notorious'' 36th Special Police Unit. The official 
would not say how many troops are in Kosovo except they ``far exceed'' 
the level predating the start of the violence there in March. NATO 
officials were keen to point out Wednesday that airstrikes plans remain 
active. ``The planes are arriving at their forward bases in Italy,'' 
said one official. ``We'll be keeping up the military pressure for 
some time to come.''
