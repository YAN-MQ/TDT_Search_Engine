Russia's government has created a dlrs 600 million emergency food 
reserve to help the country through one of the ``most difficult and 
complex periods in its history,'' Prime Minister Yevgeny Primakov 
said Wednesday. A two-month old economic crisis has not caused food 
shortages, and no serious problems are anticipated. But with food 
imports falling sharply, and the grain harvest likely to be the smallest 
in 40 years, the government wants insurance against the vagaries of 
the Russian winter. ``The population will have secure supplies of 
fruit and vegetables,'' Primakov told the upper house of parliament, 
the Federation Council. But, he added, ``I must honestly say that 
we have limited resources.'' The government has earmarked dlrs 600 
million to stock up on reserves that would last for two weeks and 
cover the needs of a third of Russia's population, Primakov said. 
The supplies would be primarily for ``special consumers'' and ``certain 
regions'' that Primakov did not name. However, it seemed to be a reference 
to soldiers, who are poorly fed, and isolated northern communities. 
In a wide-ranging speech, Primakov's gave a gloomy assessment of Russia's 
economic and social conditions, and said there was no easy way out 
of the current crunch. ``Russia is now passing through one of the 
most difficult and complex periods in its history,'' Primakov said. 
``We must join efforts of the government and regional leaders to get 
out of the crisis.'' Primakov has been in office for over a month, 
but his government is still concocting a plan to revive Russia's rapidly 
contracting economy. Meanwhile, President Boris Yeltsin shook off 
the effects of a cold and met with Primakov in the Kremlin on Wednesday. 
But the president has said little about the country's recent troubles 
and most of the burden for fixing the economy has fallen on Primakov. 
The prime minister told the Federation Council that his top priorities 
were to repay overdue wages owed to millions of workers, restructure 
a banking system that has been crippled by the crisis, and revamp 
an unwieldy tax system that is widely circumvented. The government 
will help some of the larger banks, but will not try to save all 1,500 
of the country's banks. ``Banks that are of great significance to 
the national economy, but are not very viable at present, will receive 
assistance from the government to survive,'' Primakov said. ``The 
banks that are absolutely not viable will not survive.'' Primakov's 
government has started paying off overdue wages. But it's facing an 
old problem _ government money allocated to regional officials often 
disappears before its reaches the workers. Primakov accused regional 
officials of turning a blind eye to such abuses. The billions of rubles 
(dollars) in unpaid wages and pensions across Russia are ``a social 
time bomb placed under our state,'' Primakov said. The Federation 
Council, where Primakov spoke, is made up of regional governors who 
have substantial power in their home territories. Meanwhile, the Russian 
ruble rose sharply Wednesday to 13 a dollar, compared to 15 the previous 
day. Analysts said they expected the ruble's resurgence to be short-lived 
and warned that attempts to manipulate the rate may backfire and result 
in a sharp drop of the currency. The ruble traded at around 6 to the 
dollar before the crisis hit two months ago.
