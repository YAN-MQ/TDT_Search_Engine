Two separate border incidents claimed the lives of three ethnic Albanians, 
two in Serbia's southern Kosovo province and one in neighboring Macedonia, 
media reported Wednesday. Two men died in a landmine explosion Tuesday 
night at the Albanian border with Serbia's strife-torn Kosovo province, 
the ethnic Albanians' Kosovo Information Center said. The accident 
reportedly occurred near Ponosevac. The border region had been mined 
by the Yugoslav army, the Center also said. Another ethnic Albanian 
was killed in a separate incident Tuesday, this one at the Macedonian-Albanian 
border, said Macedonia's defense ministry. The ministry said the incident 
occurred near Banjiste after five smugglers attempted to illegally 
cross into Albania with a stolen vehicle. A border patrol ordered 
the vehicle to halt but the smugglers disobeyed the instructions and 
shooting ensued, killing the ethnic Albanian from Macedonia. The rest 
of the group escaped into Albania.
