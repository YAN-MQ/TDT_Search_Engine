Philip Mosima finished ahead of four-time world cross country champion 
Paul Tergat for a Kenyan 1-2 in the 6-kilometer Belgrade Race Through 
History Wednesday with Million Wolde of Ethiopia third. Mosima, who 
was world junior cross country champion in 1993 and '94, clocked 17 
minutes 02 seconds with his countryman one second slower. Wolde's 
time was 17:05 with another Kenyan, Josephat Machuka, 13 seconds further 
behind. The threat of NATO military intervention because of the ethnic 
warfare in its southern Kosovo province depleted the number of expected 
international participants to only 11. With only three Yugoslav runners, 
the total was 14. The race was named Belgrade's Race Through History 
as the track was entirely within Belgrade's ancient fortress, the 
original and historic heart of the Serbian capital.
