What's in a name? Just ask a certain 60-year old retired truck driver 
who lives in Austria. His name is Adolph Hitler, spelled H-I-double 
T-L-E-R. Two "t's" there. He told a German newspaper that he often 
thought his life would have been a lot easier if he had another name. 
But Mr. Hittler says he never changed it, out of respect for the mother 
and father who gave him his name. Mr. Hittler says no one ever believed 
that his name was what is was. He also reports getting anonymous telephone 
calls in the middle of the night from people who say, "Hile Hittler". 
Mr. Adolph Hittler with two "t's" commented while in Brono Austria, 
he was there to attend a conference for people with infamous names.
