u.s. Officials remain hopeful about the prospects for the Mid-East 
Summit set to begin tomorrow near Washington. They're hoping for an 
interim peace agreement that may call for further Israeli troop withdrawals 
from the west bank in exchange for Palestinian action to satisfy Israel's 
security requirements. But, as VOA's Gil Butler reports, the Officials 
say a deal is not certain. Secretary of State, Madeleine Albright, 
who will take part in the negotiations, spoke by phone with Israeli 
Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu. It was part of the preparation 
for a Middle East Summit that is to begin Thursday at the White House 
and continue in rural Maryland at the Y-River Conference Center. Israeli 
demand for a tighter Palestinian control over security, a crack down 
on a tax aim to Israeli's, appears to be a major hurdle to be surmounted 
before an interim agreement is reached. During Secretary Albright's 
visit to the region next week, several other interim issues were agreed. 
The percentage of land to be returned and the Palestinian Industrial 
Park at Gaza among them. But, State Department Spokesman, James Rubin, 
emphasizes that there is no guarantee the Wye River Conference will 
yield an agreement. Um, clearly there are a large number of hurdles 
that have to be overcome if we're going to get an agreement. And, 
we do believe we, uh, put ourselves in a better position to get that 
agreement as a result of the work that we've done in the last week. 
But such an agreement is by a no means, a sure thing. And, it will 
require some tough choices by both sides if we're going to get such 
an agreement, And, the preparations continue, um, and will probably 
continue up to the moment when the leaders arrive on for their first 
meeting on Thursday morning. Secretary Albright has set aside four 
full days to take part in the Wye River Summit. If an interim agreement 
is reached, officials say the goal is to at least make a start in 
negotiating the even tougher final status issues between the Palestinians 
and the Israelis. The future of Jerusalem, borders, refugee rights, 
Israeli settlements and the status of the Palestinian authority. Gil 
Butler, VOA News, The State Department.
