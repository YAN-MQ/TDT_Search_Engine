Today's geography quiz sends us to one of Eastern Europe's newest 
nations. It's nestled in the heart of the Julian Alps so that's the 
sunny side of the Alps as the locals will tell you. Folks here are 
so proud of their alpine tradition that the three peaked mountain, 
Teaklove, is a national symbol. But life here is not all about mountaineering. 
Our mystery spot also features a seacoast along the Adriatic Sea. 
The coast is peppered, or dotted, not to put it too sharply, with 
quaint towns which are rich in Venetian Gothic architecture. Visitors 
are plied with a local elixir called Slivovitz, a drink that becomes 
harder to pronounce the more you drink it which citizens break out 
for a celebration or a simple pick me up. You may be seeing more of 
this country in eight years. It's put in a joint bid, along with neighbors 
Austria and Italy for the 2006 winter Olympics. Let the games begin. 
We'll see if you're a winner in today's geography competition later 
this hour.
