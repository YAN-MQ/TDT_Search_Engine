Israeli prime minister Benjamin Netanyahu is predicting success for 
a U.S. Middle East peace summit, but only if Palestinian authority 
President Yasser Arafat clamps down on militants. Netanyahu is in 
Jordan, discussing the forthcoming summit with Jordanian leaders. 
Arafat left Gaza today for London, En route to the United States. 
The summit begins tomorrow outside Washington. President Clinton is 
trying to break a 19-month-old peace deadlock by having Israel hand 
over another 13% of the West Bank to Palestinians in exchange for 
security guarantees.
