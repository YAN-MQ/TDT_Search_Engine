The first two weeks of the NBA season have been canceled. Until now, 
basketball was the only major professional sport in the United States 
that had not lost a game to a labor dispute. Greg LaMotte reports 
on fans reaction. Talks between the NBA and the players union just 
took a gigantic dive. For the first time in the league's history, 
regular season games have been canceled for at least two weeks, and 
it could last longer. This youngster says he's gonna do something 
about it. I would write a whole long letter about it, with my mom, 
about "why?" 'cause I like watching basketball. It's really a good 
sport and I feel really bad. If you were talking to the NBA, what 
would you tell those guys? I'd tell them, "come on, everybody's depending 
on you. Lets get this thing rolling." Well, I think it's not cool 
for the NBA players not to be playing, because personally I like basketball. 
You know, a lot of people don't like watching football all the time. 
It's not fair for other seasons to start on time and they have to 
be postponed. That might be the kind of talk players hope will put 
pressure on the owners. But some people just don't care. And maybe 
that'll give Shaquille O'Neal more practice time at the foul line. 
It's cool for entertainment and stuff, but most people have other 
things to worry about, like their families and children and keeping 
their jobs. I'll just pick up somewhere else and watch some other 
stuff that I probably wouldn't see with the basketball. It took major 
league baseball several years to get its fans back after the players 
went on strike. It'll be interesting to see how long it takes the 
NBA to rebound. Greg LaMotte, CNN, Los Angeles.
