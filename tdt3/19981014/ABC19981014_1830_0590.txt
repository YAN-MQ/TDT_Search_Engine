The White House and republican leaders say they're in the process 
of completing the $500 billion spending Bill which will keep the government 
running for another year. The White House is claiming it has won on 
a major sticking point, a $1 billion measure to hire new teachers. 
The republicans say they win because the money will be controlled 
by the federal government and not the bureaucracy.
