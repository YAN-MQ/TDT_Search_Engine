Estonian President Lennart Meri has appointed Raul Malk, most recently 
ambassador to Great Britain, as the country's new foreign minister. 
The 46-year-old career diplomat replaces Toomas Ilves, who resigned 
last month to devote more time to campaigning for national elections 
in March.. Malk was to be sworn in before parliament Wednesday evening. 
Under the new foreign minister, there should be no major shift in 
Estonian foreign policy, which has made membership in the European 
Union and NATO a high priority. But Malk, who has also served as one 
of Estonia's main negotiators with Moscow, may try to focus on Russian 
relations more than his predecessor.
