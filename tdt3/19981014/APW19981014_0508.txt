Kyrgyzstan will hold a referendum Saturday on allowing private land 
ownership in the Central Asian nation, but no sales of agricultural 
land will be allowed for five years, a news report said Wednesday. 
President Askar Akayev has also decreed that Kyrgyzstan's rural residents, 
who use small land plots, will receive the land as their property, 
the Interfax news agency reported. However, the plots _ or any other 
arable land _ cannot be sold to others for five years, Akayev decreed. 
The decree also bars non-Kyrgyz citizens and companies with foreign 
participation from owning land in this former Soviet republic. The 
referendum Saturday is expected to result in constitutional amendments 
to allow land ownership.
