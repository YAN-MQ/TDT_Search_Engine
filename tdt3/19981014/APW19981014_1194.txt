Economist Amartya Sen, a native of India, won the Nobel Prize on Wednesday 
for work that studies the world's poor and suggests new ways that 
governments can help them. Sen's work incorporates factors such as 
income distribution and health in measuring poverty. He analyzes the 
causes of catastrophes such as famines, and ways to include the very 
poor in evaluating a nation's overall economic situation. Sen, who 
was visiting New York on Wednesday, said he was thrilled that the 
Royal Swedish Academy of Sciences, which awards the prize, had finally 
acknowledged his field. It ``gives recognition to problems of poverty 
and equality and in general the interests of the people placed at 
the downside of the economy,'' said the 64-year-old master at Britain's 
Trinity College in Cambridge. Economists agreed that the field has 
long been overlooked, saying that the usual indicators of a nation's 
well-being, such as gross national product, are not enough. ``Just 
looking at GNP or GNP growth for a country like India might not be 
a very good way to say, `Is the development plan of the country really 
helping people?''' said Jerry Hausman, economics professor at the 
Massachusetts Institute of Technology. ``Being able to look at the 
numbers in different ways and think about it is very helpful,'' he 
said. Sen said GNP, the total value of all the goods and services 
produced by a country, ``overlooks the fact that many people are terribly 
poor. We have to pay attention to the downside of what's happening 
and not just the average, majority position,'' he said. Sen developed 
alternative indexes which also include income distribution, among 
other factors. He worked with the theory of ``social choice'' _ how 
different individuals' welfare is affected by collective decisions. 
The Academy said in announcing the prize, ``By combining tools from 
economics and philosophy, he has restored an ethical dimension to 
the discussion of vital economic problems.'' Robert Eisner, past president 
of the American Economic Association and professor emeritus at Northwestern 
University, said, ``Poverty and hunger and the distribution of income 
in the world ... have been all too much neglected by the top economists, 
who seem to frequently do what is eventually useful work but (doesn't) 
tie that much to the problems facing masses of people.'' Sen learned 
he won the dlrs 963,000 prize hours after arriving in New York to 
attend Thursday's memorial service for Mahbub ul Haq, a former finance 
minister of Pakistan and the architect of the annual Human Development 
Index, used by the United Nations to measure the wealth of nations 
by citizens' living standards. Joseph Duncan, a former U.S. government 
economist and current chief economic adviser to Dun and Bradstreet 
Corp., said choosing Sen was an interesting contrast to last year's 
winners, Americans Robert Merton and Myron Scholes, whose work generally 
benefited the rich. The Americans were honored for their work on valuing 
risky ``derivatives'' investments such as stock options, but came 
under a cloud last month after the near-collapse of a giant hedge 
fund in which they were partners. Sen's interest in the dynamics of 
famine was spurred by his own experience during India's famine in 
1943, when he was 9. ``It was rumored then that the food supply was 
not very low,'' Sen said, ``nevertheless a famine occurred.'' In 1981 
book, he wrote that famines are not only caused by food shortages 
but sometimes result from distribution problems _ like the ones many 
African nations experienced in the late 1980s and early 1990s _ and 
simple economics. ``Famines can occur even when the food supply is 
high but people can't buy the food because they don't have the money,'' 
Sen said. He found that famines never occur in democracies because 
government leaders are held accountable by the public, through elections 
and a free press. And he discusses how to prevent famine or limit 
its effects. Before moving to Britain, Sen was a professor of economics 
and philosophy at Harvard, where he still has an office and remains 
a professor emeritus. ``He is a wonderful man and a very serious and 
profound scholar who has in a quite unique way combined philosophy 
and economics,'' U.S. Deputy Treasury Secretary Lawrence Summers, 
a former Harvard economics professor, said in an interview on C-Span. 
The economics prize is the only Nobel not established in the will 
of Swedish industrialist Alfred Nobel, who invented dynamite. It was 
created in 1968 to mark the tercentenary of Sweden's central bank. 
Prizes in chemistry and physics were given earlier this week. The 
last Nobel to be given _ the peace prize _ will be awarded Friday. 
The winners will receive their prizes Dec. 10, the anniversary of 
Nobel's death.
