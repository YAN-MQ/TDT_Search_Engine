A lot of people tonight are said to be fearing the worst after dozens 
of adults who belonged to a religious group in Denver, Colorado, suddenly 
disappeared from their homes this week. Jim Avila reports cult trackers 
are concerned about the possibility of another sort of heaven's gate 
suicide. They've vanished the homes abandoned and up for sale. We 
love him. And we really want him back. Belongings sold. It was amazing 
all that furniture was gone. Cars returned to dealers, cryptic, hurried 
notes attached. The Denver religious cult known as concerned Christians 
cannot be found and families across the country fear another mass 
suicide. If they're told to do something that's irrational, I think 
that they would do it in the name of God. The lord is inside of me 
and he speaks the truth. Kim Miller, the cult leader, a 44-year-old 
minister who claims to be God's only prophet. His judgments are ready 
to begin. In fact Miller told followers Denver would be the first 
to go, the apocalypse beginning last Saturday, October 10. Gle died 
on the cross for our sins. So last week they left town, as many as 
60 concerned Christians cutting themselves off from the world. This 
group is neither concerned or Christian. Bill honsberger is a cult 
watcher, tracking Miller's cult for a decade. He says the cult is 
totally brainwashed, dangerously willing to die at the minister's 
command. Nicole ki waver saw that power first hand. Her mother and 
stepfather are missing concerned Christians. She escaped the group 
two years ago. She told me that if God wanted her to kill me, she 
should. Miller is not wanted for any crime. No official police interest. 
But a former member, the last to leave the cult, now living in Idaho 
and afraid to show his face, says Kim Miller is dangerous. It's a 
doomsday cult in my opinion. He will say it's time. It's going to 
be another heaven's gate. So where are they? Family members can only 
guess. One lead is Jerusalem but an advance man, Craig scommid, sent 
there three months ago to prepare the way, cannot be found either. 
In fact, all anyone can say for sure is that at many as 60 people 
convinced the world will soon end are nowhere to be found.
