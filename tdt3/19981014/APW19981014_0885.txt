At a time when autopsies are on the decline, a 10-year study of the 
procedure at one U.S. hospital revealed a significant number of cancers 
that had not been found during the patients' lives, researchers reported 
today. The researchers said their findings, reported in The Journal 
of the American Medical Association, confirm the importance of the 
autopsy in an age when the procedure has been declining in use. The 
researchers, led by Dr. Elizabeth C. Burton of Louisiana State University 
Medical Center's Department of Pathology in New Orleans, found a discrepancy 
of 44 percent when they reviewed 1,105 cases. The researchers found 
that 100 patients autopsied at the Medical Center of Louisiana at 
New Orleans had developed 111 undiagnosed or misdiagnosed cancers. 
Worse was the finding that cancer was the immediate cause of death 
for 57 of the 100 patients. The hospital is a large teaching facility 
encompassing two medical schools, Louisiana State University and Tulane 
University schools of medicine. The researchers noted that the Medical 
Center of Louisiana serves a mainly indigent population, so malignancies 
might have been masked by other, more acute problems when the patients 
were treated. The usefulness of autopsies is a subject of much debate 
with some saying it is an unnecessary diagnostic tool because of advancing 
technology, the study noted. ``Despite technological advances, the 
number of inaccurate clinical diagnoses (attributed to both malignancies 
and all other causes) remains alarmingly high,'' the researchers wrote. 
They concluded that, instead of abandoning the autopsy, ``we should 
recognize its importance in our understanding of disease.'' In an 
accompanying editorial, Dr. George D. Lundberg, the journal's editor, 
expressed concern about the continual decline of autopsy rates. According 
to the study, autopsy rates have fallen from an estimated 50 percent 
in the 1960s to an average of 10 percent today in teaching hospitals. 
In community-based hospitals, the rate is as low as 5 percent, they 
said. ``The autopsy is not dead, but it slumbers deeply. ... It is 
not exactly a conspiracy of silence or necessarily a massive intentional 
cover-up, but it is a movement with millions of players, all in complicity 
for widely varying reasons with the final result of 'do not bother 
me with the truth' on the sickest patients _ the ones who die,'' Lundberg 
wrote.
