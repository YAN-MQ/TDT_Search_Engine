The National Hockey Leagues Washington Capital's hosted the Detroit 
Redwings in a rematch of last year's Stanley Cup Finals. VOA's Steve 
Shar reports from the MCI's Center in Washington where it was a familiar 
result with Detroit winning 3-2. Detroit has now extended his dominance 
over the capital to eleven straight games which includes a four game 
sweep in the Stanley Cup Finals earlier this year and seven regular 
seasoned games dating back to 1994. The Redwings scored first with 
a power play ball from Daren McCarty at 649 of the first period. Washington 
Paul Levin at 550 of the second when Peter Bondres slapped a rebound 
pass goalie Chris Osgord. But then Detroit seemed to shift into a 
higher gear, growing two quick second period goals to regain the league. 
The Capital's close the gap to 3-2 in the third period on a Craig 
Burubee tip-end but it was not enough to break the streak. Even so, 
Capital's coach, Ron Wilson, was happy with his team's performance. 
I felt we played great. Uh, we had a couple of break downs in the 
second period but we kept taking it to them all night and we took 
everything they had to prevent us from at least tying the game. Once 
again, the Redwings beat the Capitals 3-2. From the MCI Center In 
Washington, This Is Steve Shar, VOA Sports.
