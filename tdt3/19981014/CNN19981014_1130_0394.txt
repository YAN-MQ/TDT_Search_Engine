Russian President Boris Yeltsin is back at work today against doctor's 
orders. He cut short a trip to central Asia earlier this week because 
of a respiratory infection. Sunday, Yeltsin stumbled when he arrived 
in Uzbekistan, and reportedly made rambling remarks at a state dinner. 
Reports yesterday indicated he would be recuperating all week.
