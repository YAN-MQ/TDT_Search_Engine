Many of our local FM and medium wave affiliates are about to take 
a two minute break, but we'll be back. You're listening to VOA News 
Now. And coming up 22 hours universal time, which means we're saying 
goodnight to most of our listeners in the Middle East and North Africa. 
Thanks for being with us. And tune in again tomorrow beginning at 
4 hours Universal time when VOA News Now resumes on 7.17, 11.965, 
and 15.205 megahertz short-wave. If you are listening in the Persian 
Gulf area right now, we invite you to stay with us for another couple 
of hours on medium wave at 1548 kilohertz. And if you are listening 
in the eastern Mediterranean, we will be back on the air with VOA 
News Now thirty minutes from now on 1260 kilohertz medium wave. Here's 
a frequency change. If you're listening in Africa, we're now going 
off 15.41, 15.445, 15.58 and 17.725 megahertz short wave. We invite 
you to retune to 7.34 megahertz or any of our other remaining frequencies. 
For listeners in Europe, we're now going off WRN1 Via Astra. We will 
resume broadcasting via WRN.
