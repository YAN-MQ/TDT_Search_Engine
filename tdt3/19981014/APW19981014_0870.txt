After a half-century as the major solo force in Norwegian politics, 
the country's largest party, Labor, on Wednesday offered to form its 
first postwar coalition if the current minority government falls. 
`The Labor Party has never done that in the postwar period, but this 
is a special situation,'' Labor leader Thorbjorn Jagland, who resigned 
as prime minister a year ago. Jagland said such a coalition was the 
only way to form a strong government with a virtually deadlocked parliament. 
Labor has ruled Norway for most of the past 50 years, and is largely 
responsible for building the country's cradle-to-grave welfare state. 
Jagland did not say when he might make a bid for power, or what parties 
he would consider as partners. A three-party coalition led by Christian 
Democrat Kjell Magne Bondevik formed a government a year ago after 
Jagland and his party resigned following a disappointing national 
election. Bondevik's government has sought support from both the right 
and left political wings. However, early talks on its proposed 1999 
national were deadlocked, and many analysts say the coalition, with 
just 42 seats in the 165-member parliament, could fall over its economic 
plan. ``Labor does not believe Norway can be managed in this way,'' 
said Jagland about the uncertain parliamentary backing for the current 
government. He said Labor this autumn would present ``a stabilization 
program'' for the country. Norway, the world's second-largest oil 
export, has been stung by low oil prices, the global economic crisis 
and fears that a six-year economic boom was on the verge of a downturn 
and possible recession. A coalition would need 83 seats in parliament 
to form a majority government. Labor has 65, or 18 short of a majority. 
Its traditional, the Socialist Left, has nine seats, meaning that 
at least one more of the seven parties in parliament would have to 
join a majority government.
