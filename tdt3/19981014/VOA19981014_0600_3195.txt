In business, it often helps to be a member of well-known family. Your 
name only can lend an element of confidence, stability and success. 
In the arts, being a son or daughter of a famous actor or singer can 
cause skepticism among critics. Rufus Reinwhite is the son of folk 
singers Lawden Reinwhite and Kate Magarego and he's just released 
his debut album. VOA's Kathryn Cole reports. 1998 has seen several 
second generations rockers release debut CD's. Chris Stills, the sound 
alike son of Steven and Sean Lennon, who exhibits the influence of 
his parents, John Lennon and Yoko Ono. We can now add Rufus Reinwhite 
who doesn't seem to follow in his parents footsteps. This is not a 
record in the folk music tradition. It's full of lush cabaret-style 
melodies. That is Rufus Reinwhite with April Fools from his debut 
compact disc. Reinwhite grew up in Montreal and started performing 
on his own as a teenager. He fell in love with opera as a child. In 
fact, operatic divas sets the tone for one of his songs on his album. 
Rufus Reinwhite's love of opera is the basis of that song, Damned 
Ladies, off his self-titled CD. Reinwhite's material occasionally 
touches on another subject that he doesn't mind singing about. His 
sexuality. The openly gay performer has written a few man to man love 
songs but also writes less gender specific ballads such as Foolish 
Love and Oh Losing Oneself in the Affection of Another. Foolish Love 
is one of the songs on Rufus Reinshite's debut collection. As the 
child of two singers whose work was critically acclaimed but not commercially 
successful, he's saw how rewarding and difficult a performer's life 
can be. And unlike many other first efforts by some sons or daughters 
of, Rufus Reinwhite's album is one of the most interesting debuts 
of 1998. I'm Kathryn Cole.
