Mike Sammond, "Headline Sports." For the second time in three years, 
the Yankees are in the world series. A three-run homer by Scott brosius 
and a key two-run triple by Derek jeter lifted the Yankees to a 9-5 
win Tuesday night over the Indians. New York wins the alcs four games 
to two. We burned two runs tonight in the first and second innings 
to where we should have scored easy runs and we didn't do that. And 
that's costly. You can't do that with a team against the Yankees.
