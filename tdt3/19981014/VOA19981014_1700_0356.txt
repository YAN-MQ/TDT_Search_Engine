Britain says it is sending an advanced team to Kosovo Thursday to 
help organize monitoring of the planned Serb military pullout there. 
Correspondent Laurie Kessman reports Britain ultimately expects to 
provide 1/10 of the 2000 foreign inspectors. Britain is not wasting 
any time in providing personnel for the Kosovo verification mission. 
British Foreign Secretary Robin Cook says an advanced team is ready 
to leave this week for Kosovo. Another 150 inspectors will go within 
the next two weeks. They will be people of caliber, able to give this 
mission the eyes and the ears which the international community needs 
to make sure we keep tabs on President Milosovic. The British contingent 
would be the first wave of an air and ground monitoring mission to 
verify that Yugoslavia's president is fulfilling his promise to pull 
Serb special forces from Kosovo and let the displaced return to their 
homes there. US Special Envoy Richard Holbroke brokered the agreement 
in marathon negotiation sessions and backed by NATO's threat of military 
action. British Defense Secretary George Robertson says that twin 
track strategy has worked out, but the crisis is not over yet. We've 
pulled back the reckless adventurism that was involved here from the 
precipice and that was only achieved because there was resolution 
and determination and because military force was there to be used 
had it been necessary. Mr. Robertson says British aircraft will also 
take part in the surveillance flights over Kosovo. Foreign Secretary 
Cook also intends to push for a UN Security Counsel resolution endorsing 
the agreement on Kosovo in order to give it even more clout. The British 
minister will travel to countries neighboring Kosovo and to NATO's 
command and control center being set up in Macedonia. Laurie Kessman,
