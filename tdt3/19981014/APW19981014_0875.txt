Amid noisy protests by nationalists, Romania's parliament on Wednesday 
voted to allow NATO use the country's airspace in emergency situations 
if the alliance launches airstrikes against Yugoslavia. ``We cannot 
join NATO by being arm in arm with Milosevic,'' Defense Minister Victor 
Babiuc told a joint session of the Parliament, which approved the 
decision by a 244-160 vote. NATO asked last week to use Romania's 
airspace as it was considering airstrikes to force Yugoslavia's President 
Slobodan Milosevic to agree to end a crackdown against ethnic Albanians 
in Kosovo province. Parliament's vote confirmed a decision by the 
Supreme Defense Council, which said the army would not participate 
in any NATO military action against its neighbor Yugoslavia. ``Romania 
has never intended and does not intend to get involved militarily 
in the conflict,'' Babiuc said, adding that Romania's position does 
not violate the two countries' bilateral treaty because ``no act of 
aggression is included.'' Romania was torn between traditional friendship 
with Serbia and its aspirations to join NATO and many people are concerned 
that fighting may spill over into Romania. Parliament also said that 
Romania would send humanitarian aid to the province including medical 
assistance, shelters for refugees, home builders and peace keeping 
ts. Most lawmakers said that their vote was motivated by the upcoming 
winter and the plight of the refugees. ``We cannot let 250,000 homeless 
people hiding in the woods and mountains in the middle of the frost,'' 
said Deputy Ludovic Rackoczi of the Hungarian Democratic Union. Nationalists 
claimed the conflict in Kosovo is an external matter and NATO should 
look at other trouble spots. ``Why does NATO not handle conflicts 
in Northern Ireland or the racist tensions in the United States?'' 
said Corneliu Vadim Tudor, the extremist leader of the Greater Romania 
Party. Romania and Yugoslavia have a common land and water border 
of 550 kilometers (344 miles).
