Britain's foreign secretary warned Wednesday that NATO remains prepared 
for airstrikes against Yugoslavia if Slobodan Milosevic fails to abide 
by the agreement to halt the crackdown in Kosovo province. In a step 
toward compliance, the Serb government outlined a plan for a separate 
parliament in autonomy-minded Kosovo. But officials also shut down 
two newspapers critical of Milosevic, reinforcing suspicions the Yugoslav 
president is using the crisis to strengthen his grip on power. Following 
marathon talks with U.S. envoy Richard Holbrooke, Milosevic agreed 
Monday to withdraw forces from Kosovo, begin peace negotiations with 
separatist ethnic Albanians and allow some 2,000 international inspectors 
into the troubled Serb province to verify compliance. Full compliance 
should end Milosevic's seven-month crackdown against Kosovo Albanian 
militants, an operation that has killed hundreds and left up to 300,000 
refugees homeless. To make sure Milosevic abides by the agreement, 
NATO gave Milosevic until 0500 GMT Saturday to comply or face airstrikes.
