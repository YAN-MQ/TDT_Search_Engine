The FBI has launched a national DNA computer network aimed at fighting 
violent crime. The system allows state crime labs around the country 
to exchange DNA profiles in hopes of linking unsolved crimes to known 
offenders. A director says it will be particularly helpful in solving 
crimes committed by violent and sexual offenders. All 50 states have 
laws requiring convicted offenders to provide DNA samples for the 
database.
