Twenty known hooligans were already on their way back to England Wednesday 
and a dozen more English fans were sobering up in jail ahead of the 
Euro 2000 qualifier between Luxembourg and England late Wednesday. 
About 1,000 members of Luxembourg security forces were on high alert 
throughout the day, outnumbered by some 2,500 English soccer fans 
pouring into the capital of this tiny Grand Duchy. The last two visits 
of England here in 1977 and 1983 were marred by crowd violence, when 
hooligans smashed up the Josy Barthel national stadium then rampaged 
through the streets, demolishing cars and storefronts. On Tuesday, 
two dozen English fans, were stopped at Brussels airport in neighboring 
Belgium on their way to Luxembourg because their names were on police 
lists of known hooligans. Six were send back to England, the rest 
would be expelled by the end of the day, said Lt. Eric Froidmont of 
the Belgian gendarmes. Early Wednesday, police in Luxembourg said 
they'd arrested about a dozen drunken fans in the capital and on the 
border with Belgium. Police spokesman Capt. Rene Lindenlaub said they'd 
be released after the game. This year, English hooligans have already 
left a trail of destruction wherever their team played during the 
World Cup in France. There was violence again in Sweden last month, 
the last time England played abroad. In Luxembourg, a country of 400,000 
people shoehorned in between France, Belgium and Germany, police have 
warned shopkeepers in the capital of possible violence and many planned 
to close their shops early. ``You can see there are fewer people in 
town, they've afraid to come downtown,'' said Isilda Moreira, in her 
smart fashion store. ``We all know this lot are more aggressive than 
other supporters. Moreira was keeping her store open as usual, but 
the next-door greengrocers had the shutters down with and a handwritten 
sign in the window ``Closed because of the soccer.'' England already 
lost its first Euro 2000 game in Sweden, and played poorly in a scoreless 
draw at Wembley against Bulgaria on Saturday. A slip-up against the 
amateurs from Luxembourg would have a devastating effect. Fears are 
the English fans could take it out on the town. Police have long prepared 
for the encounter. Cooperation with the border authorities in Belgium 
and France was beefed up and a half dozen spotters from British police 
will accompany the fans. After the match, the fans who came by train 
could have to sit out the night in Luxembourg since no rail transport 
will be available until the morning.
