Germany's new liberal government is considering making it illegal 
to slap children. A measure to outlaw spanking and slapping children, 
even as a disciplinary measure, is to be discussed as part of the 
coalition talks between the victorious Social Democrats and their 
future government partner, the Greens, newspapers reported Wednesday. 
``The right of children to be reared without violence must be anchored 
in the law books,'' the new government's designated Family Minister 
Christine Bergmann was quoted by the Cologne Express as saying. German 
law already provides that ``degrading disciplinary measures, in particular 
physical and mental mistreatment, are improper,'' Bergmann, a Social 
Democrat, told the newspaper. Outgoing Family Minister Claudia Nolte 
condemned violence against children, but said legally speaking it 
was impossible to legislate ``a childhood without violence.'' The 
Social Democrats and the Greens don't envision strict penalties in 
a proposed measures to outlaw slapping. However, a Social Democratic 
family expert, Edith Niehuis, said they want to send a message that 
``a whack on the behind should no longer be allowed as a parental 
tool.'' Organizations dedicated to the child protection welcomed the 
proposal.
