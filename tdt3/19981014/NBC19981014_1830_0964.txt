The other part of the down side of the stock market, the risk of a 
volatile stock market can play right into the hands of a scam ar tis. 
A scam that costs some of the seniors their life savings in Florida. 
Early this morning in Florida -- -- state insurance agents move in 
on suspected operators of an alleged investment pyramid scheme. The 
victims -- 325 investors, mostly elderly, in 15 states. Losses more 
than $15 million. Is this a pyramid scheme, plain and simple? Bill 
and Anita potts say they lost $178,000, their retirement nest egg. 
There's just absolutely no way that you'd allow somebody to walk in 
your front door, to steal your money from you. And yet, it happened, 
just that quickly. Here's how it worked -- investigators say the suspects 
convince the pottses and other investors to pull their money out of 
the volatile stock market and put it into "legends," a golf and entertainment 
complex that promised a steady 12%-A-year return. For the pottses, 
I was a good deal. They made almost $1,800 profit a month. I feel 
like I was suckered in, I mean, really suckered in. The 31-year career 
Navy man, who says he has always lived and invested cautiously, says 
he believed the investment was safe because it was backed by a "financial 
guarantee bond." But state officials say that bond was just a piece 
of paper, the early profits he enjoyed just other investors' money. 
And when potts went to withdraw his initial investment, he says all 
$178,000 was gone. These people, that the senior citizens trusted, 
took their retirement nest eggs and put them in their own pocket. 
a grand jury indictment charges those involved with racketeering and 
securities fraud. State officials say it's unlikely anyone will get 
their money back. Even worse, because most investors liquidated retirement 
I.R.A. accounts to invest in the sports club, they still have to pay 
taxes to the IRS. For 74-year-old Bill potts and his wife, a financial 
loss made even harder with little time left to earn back what's lost.
