Two North Korean soldiers have defected to South Korea, crossing the 
heavily armed water separating the two countries. Officials in Seoul 
say that the two soldiers, one male and one female, walked across 
the demilitarized zone, through a mine field in the central part of 
the border. On Tuesday, a man claiming to be a retired North Korean 
Army Officer sought asylum in South Korea. Dozens of North Koreans 
have defected to the south in recent years to escape massive food 
shortages.
