Foreign ministers from the six member contact group on the former 
Yugoslavia are meeting in Paris tomorrow and they'll consider the 
new accord on Kosovo between special envoy Richard Holbrooke and Serbian 
President Slobodan Milosevic. Sarah Chase reports from Paris. French 
officials have hailed the accord and the threat by the NATO alliance 
that achieved it. According to a foreign ministry statement, the goal 
of tomorrow's meeting is to evaluate the deal and discuss the respective 
roles of the United Nations, NATO and the Organization for Security 
and Cooperation in Europe in resolving the Kosovo crisis. The accord 
calls for Serbian troops and military police to begin pulling out 
of Kosovo by Friday. Compliance is to be verified by air and ground 
monitoring. Belgrade must also open autonomy negotiations with Kosovo 
leaders. NATO officials warned today that this deal does not equal 
resolution of the crisis and that the actions of both the Serbian 
police and the Kosovo Liberation Army will have to be carefully monitored. 
For NPR News, I'm Sarah Chase in Paris.
