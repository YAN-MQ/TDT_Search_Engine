James Gaffey remembers everything about last Christmas, at least the 
important parts. It was a busy day. He was in the kitchen cooking 
dinner for himself and his companions. The menu included chicken and 
yams. Oh, and one more detail: He was in Rikers Island prison, charged 
with selling drugs. You could also toss heavy drug use onto his pile 
of sins. ``I was a garbage head,'' Gaffey said. ``I did any kind of 
drug imaginable. It got to the point where I was robbing from my family, 
taking money from my grandmother's bank account.'' Is anything different 
now? ``I've learned I'm worth something,'' he replied. ``My life is 
not based just on trying to destroy myself.'' There is nothing like 
a visit from the ghost of Christmas past in this season of personal 
stock-taking. It helps you see yourself more clearly. It helps even 
more if, like Gaffey, you have managed to travel far in a year and 
can see the outlines of a new life lying just ahead. The ghost cast 
its spell even on Michael Rossi, who has rejected Christianity and 
embraced Islam. ``I really don't believe in Christmas,'' he said. 
``But I believe in hope.'' So do Renee Peters, Danny Rickenbacker 
and Francisco Valentin. As Christmas approached, they all sat together 
at the drug-treatment residence run by Phoenix House in Long Island 
City, Queens, looking back on the personal hell they were in a year 
ago and the struggle to get themselves straight. Last Christmas Day, 
Valentin, 33, was also a Rikers inmate, in a holding pen where dinner 
was ``a frank or something.'' Rossi, 45, was in a federal prison, 
a convicted drug dealer, ``traveled out and jailed out.'' Ms. Peters, 
36, was getting high with a girlfriend, tossing away money that should 
have gone to buy her young son a bicycle. Rickenbacker, 40, was driving 
a bus but also fighting a nasty drug habit. ``Drugs were my priority,'' 
he said. ``My family was secondary. Me and my wife went to the store 
with my credit card to get toys for my kids. But I maxed out on the 
card. I couldn't get the kids what they wanted. I felt bad about that. 
I know what my parents did to make me feel good at Christmas, and 
the guilt made me feel even worse. So I got high, just to get rid 
of the pain.'' Whether on their own or at the insistence of a judge, 
all of them wound up at Phoenix House, where abstinence from drugs 
and alcohol is the rule. ``Some people mistake abstinence for change,'' 
said Cesar Sosa, a director at the residence who led the group discussion. 
``But it takes more than that. We have to get them to believe in their 
capacity to change.'' Ms. Peters senses that transformation is under 
way. ``This is the first Christmas I'm sober _ I'm serious,'' she 
said. ``My family's trusting me now. I'm more caring. Only a selfish 
person would take all her money and spend it on getting high.'' Valentin 
hopes that he bottomed out last Christmas. ``I felt numb,'' he said. 
``It was horrible, and I was tired of it. I was tired of disappointing 
everybody. Most of all, I was tired of disappointing myself. I'm growing 
up in here, and it's about time Francisco grows up.'' For the residents, 
there will be no visits with family today. This weekend, yes, but 
not on the holiday itself. The potential for emotional overload is 
too great, Sosa explained. But they all know that this may be their 
most important Christmas ever. After all, what is the basic message 
of those Christmas ghosts in the Dickens fable if not that it is never 
too late to change, to shake off the shackles of the past? And if 
that sounds a bit corny or melodramatic, so be it. ``A person like 
myself who has been out of society and has manipulative ways, he has 
to see how not to live,'' Rossi said. Gaffey added: ``Thank God, we 
are all here, because we could be out on the street, or in jail, or 
doing God knows what to satisfy our deviation.'' Of course, deep down, 
each of them suspects that this is not really the most important Christmas. 
That distinction falls to next Christmas and where they will be then. 
Nowhere is it written, they know, that their lives will be permanently 
turned around. But for Valentin, fear of failure is no match for a 
phone call from his teen-age son the other day. ``He's a trouper,'' 
Valentin said. `` `It's all right, pop,' he said. `Next year's going 
to be OK.'''
