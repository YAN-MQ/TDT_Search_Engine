French Finance Minister Dominique Strauss-Kahn reiterated his government's 
skepticism Thursday about the merits of Europe-wide tax harmonization. 
``I don't know if it's impossible, but I wonder above all if it's 
really desirable'' to achieve a general harmonization of tax and social 
security charges in Europe in the medium term, Strauss-Kahn said in 
an interview with daily newspaper Les Echos. Strauss-Kahn said the 
principle of giving E.U. states freedom in setting their own fiscal 
policy remained important, particularly given the different quality 
of social services they provide. However, he said the E.U. should 
go ahead with harmonization in the areas of corporate and capital 
gains taxation and hoped it would happen by mid-1999. ``Harmonization 
should take place wherever (fiscal) differences are likely to create 
unfair tax competition,'' he said. ``That's why minor differences 
in value-added-tax rates, for example, don't need to be harmonized.'' 
Strauss-Kahn was echoing the conclusion reached by E.U. leaders earlier 
this month to delay decisions on the controversial issue of tax-rate 
alignment until December 1999. The leaders had agreed that tax coordination 
does not have to mean imposing uniform rates across the 15-nation 
bloc, but they said they wanted to agree on E.U. rules for taxation 
of savings, interest and royalties by next December. The Finance Ministry 
issued broad guidelines Wednesday for French government finances for 
the years 2000 to 2002, predicting a decline in the level of tax and 
social security charges. Strauss-Kahn said the decrease would have 
to be phased in slowly, depending on how fast the economy grows. The 
government also aims to trim the public deficit from 2.3 percent of 
gross domestic product to between 0.8 and 1.2 percent in 1999.
