Montana's one-of-a-kind daytime speed limit _ written in law as whatever 
speed is ``reasonable and proper'' but widely interpreted as wide 
open _ has been struck down by the Montana Supreme Court, prompting 
fears that the lack of even the vague limit will lead people to drive 
at breakneck speeds. In a 4-3 ruling on Wednesday, the court said 
the law was unconstitutionally vague and did not give drivers fair 
notice of what speed was fast enough to be illegal. ``The court held 
that based on speed alone you cannot cite somebody because they don't 
reasonably know what speed will violate the law,'' Beth Baker, Montana's 
chief deputy attorney general, said Thursday. ``The Highway Patrol 
will still be citing for careless or reckless driving but won't be 
issuing tickets based on speed alone.'' The challenge to the speed 
limit was brought by Rudy Stanko, a cattle buyer in Billings who had 
contested three tickets. ``I asked a cop how fast I could go and he 
never gave me an answer,'' Stanko said Thursday. ``They said it's 
up to the discretion of the cop and that ain't right. Let us decide 
how fast we want to travel.'' Although the court threw out a speeding 
ticket Stanko had received for traveling 102 mph, it upheld two reckless 
driving counts _ one for traveling 117 mph, the other for 121 mph. 
Both violations were on two-lane highways as he crested a hill. Montana's 
legislature will convene in January and plans have been drawn up by 
state officials and legislative leaders to impose a numerical limit: 
75 mph on interstate highways, day and night, and 70 mph on two-lane 
highways during the day and 65 at night. Montana's current nighttime 
speed limits are 65 mph on interstates and 55 mph on two-lane highways, 
and those are not affected by the court's ruling. A violation of the 
old rule, called the ``basic law,'' brought a $70 fine. Under the 
proposed new law, anyone traveling less than 10 miles over the limit 
would be fined $25 with no mark on the license. The fine would be 
higher for higher speeds. State Sen. Barry Stang, who opposed a move 
to re-instate a numerical limit in the Legislature two years ago, 
now favors the new law. ``Two years on the road with the crazies out 
there'' changed his mind, he said. He drove 50,000 miles in 1998 alone, 
and said it was worrisome to be ``going along at 80 and someone from 
out of state, who doesn't understand the road conditions, passes you 
at 100.'' He said he expected that the bill would pass. Montana is 
the only state without a numerical daytime speed limit. Before a federal 
55 mph limit was imposed to save energy in the 1970s, Montana's ``basic 
law'' was any speed deemed ``reasonable and proper.'' When the federal 
limit was repealed by Congress in December 1995, Montana's basic law 
was automatically reinstated. The number of traffic deaths has risen 
since the speed limit was repealed in 1995, though not by much. In 
1994 there were 202 deaths, in 1995 215, in 1996 196, in 1997 261, 
and so far in 1998 223.
