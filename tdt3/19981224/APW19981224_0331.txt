In the wake of a U.N. call to peace, UNITA rebels launched an intensive 
attack on a central highland city early Thursday. Rebel forces lobbed 
artillery shells through the night into Kuito, some 500 kilometers 
(310 miles) southeast of the capital Luanda, the private Radio Eclesia 
reported. A local state television employee, who was not identified, 
was wounded in the attack that began at midnight and lasted until 
10 a.m. (0900GMT), the radio said. It was not clear whether the government's 
Army Chief of Staff Gen. Joao de Matos, who flew into Kuito Wednesday, 
was still in the city. When the attack died down Kuito's 100,000 population 
_ swollen by a further third from people fleeing battles in the surrounding 
rural highlands _ emerged to stock up on provisions and water, Radio 
Eclesia reported. There were no reports Thursday of clashes in the 
neighboring Huambo province. Huambo has been the other main focus 
of the fighting that flared up earlier this month undermining a peace 
agreement between the government and UNITA brokered by the United 
Nations in 1994. The U.N. Security Council on Wednesday blamed UNITA 
for quashing the 1994 accord, and demanded an end to the clashes that 
have brought months of simmering hostility to the surface. A UNITA 
spokesman in Lisbon on Thursday accused the U.N. of bias for failing 
to denounce government violations of the peace agreement. ``When the 
government shelled Andulo and Bailundo, the Security Council said 
nothing,'' Carlos Morgado said by phone, referring to an army attack 
three weeks ago on UNITA's two central highland strongholds. Once 
the rebels, equipped with unforeseen fire power, had repelled the 
army from Andulo and Bailundo, they launched a broader offensive throughout 
the central highlands. The government has also criticized the U.N. 
for failing to guarantee UNITA's compliance with the 1994 agreement 
that was the latest of several attempts to seal an end to the civil 
war that broke out immediately after independence from Portugal in 
1975. The pact required UNITA to disband a 70,000-strong guerrilla 
army, and hand over control of almost half the country to the government. 
UNITA _ the National Union for the Total Independence of Angola _ 
is estimated to have about 30,000 guerrilla soldiers hidden in the 
vast southwest African nation's bush, compared with the government's 
100,000-strong army.
