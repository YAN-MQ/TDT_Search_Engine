NEW YORK (AP) _ U.S. National Basketball Association commissioner 
David Stern and union director Billy Hunter held a secret meeting 
in Los Angeles Wednesday night, a few hours after the league said 
a settlement must be reached by Jan. 7 to save the season. An NBA 
spokesman confirmed the meeting, which was the first between the men 
since Dec. 11. It took place at the office of agent Leonard Armato, 
who in the past has tried to act as a peacemaker between Stern and 
Hunter. ``Absolutely no progress was made,'' NBA spokesman Brian McIntyre 
said. ``There may or may not be another meeting over the weekend.'' 
Yet sources on both sides of the talks told The Associated Press that 
a deal could be done quickly if they could agree to swap major concessions.
