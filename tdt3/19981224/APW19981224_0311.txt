Boris Yeltsin, who bristles at the notion of being labeled a lame 
duck, scolded his potential successors Thursday for acting as if they 
were already president. ``There is still a year-and-a-half until the 
presidential election, and we already have people who think they are 
the president,'' Yeltsin was quoted as saying by Russian news agencies. 
``This is unpleasant and it won't help them at the polls.'' The next 
presidential election is set for the middle of 2000, but Yeltsin's 
health problems have spurred some politicians to launch informal campaigns 
in case he leaves office early. The president did not mention any 
names, but appeared to be referring to Moscow Mayor Yuri Luzhkov, 
who recently launched his own political movement and has been speaking 
out on national issues such as economic policy and Russia's foreign 
relations. Luzhkov has been an ally of Yeltsin for years, but recently 
the mayor has been critical of the president. Yeltsin, 67, says he 
has no serious illnesses and will serve out his full term. He has 
been unable to work full-time for months, though he has been more 
active since recovering from a bout of pneumonia earlier this month. 
The president said there were some candidates he would not like to 
see in high office. ``For this reason we shall use the strengths of 
our official positions in order to influence the process in a way 
that would make the new president worthy of Russia,'' Yeltsin was 
quoted as saying by Russian news agencies. Other leading presidential 
contenders are Communist Party leader Gennady Zyuganov, Siberian governor 
Alexander Lebed and liberal politician Grigory Yavlinsky. Yeltsin 
met in the Kremlin with the heads of Russia's leading television channels 
and told them he would protect press freedoms. ``I am the guarantor 
of the constitution and it states clearly : freedom of expression 
and the media,'' Yeltsin said. ``For this reason you may keep thinking 
that you are protected by the president.''
