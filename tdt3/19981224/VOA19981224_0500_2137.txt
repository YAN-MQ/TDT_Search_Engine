Israel says it will retaliate for a barrage of rockets fired across 
its northern border by Hespola guerrillas operating in Southern Lebanon. 
VOA's David Gullest reports it is yet another round in the now familiar 
military exchanges along that troubled border. The rocket barrage 
hammered the northern Israeli town of Cariot Shimona, and Israel's 
Western Galilee region, causing heavy property damage, but casualties 
were relatively light because most people in the area were in bomb 
shelters in anticipation of the attack. Has Balah had vowed to retaliate 
after Tuesday's air strike in which an Israeli jet bombed a farm house 
in the Bakah Valley near the Syrian border and killed a Lebanese mother 
and six of her children. Israel is investigating what went wrong with 
the attack. Said to have been aimed at a Has Balah radio station and 
training base and it has apologized in messages conveyed to both Lebanon 
and Syria. Israeli government spokesman, David Baroan. This was a 
mistake on the part of a pilot. We not only explained the mistake, 
but also apologized for it. These things happen. The pilots were attacking 
military targets in Lebanon, which is a part of this war, but we certainly 
do not want, but which continues as long as the Has Balah is attacking 
us. Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu convened a meeting of 
his Security Cabinet to discuss the rocket attack, the heaviest in 
nearly three years, which was answered by Israeli artillery fire. 
Has Balah has been waging a guerrilla war since 1985 trying to drive 
Israel out of the self declared security zone it has staked out in 
southern Lebanon to protect its northern border. Israel has said it 
is willing to withdraw from the 15 kilometer wide bumper strip provided 
Lebanon gives security guarantees for its northern border. But the 
Lebanese government, which is heavily influenced by Syria, insists 
the Israeli withdrawal should be unconditional. Israeli political 
analysts believe Syria is disinclined to support a settlement in Southern 
Lebanon, as long as its contacts with Israel over the return of the 
Golan Heights remain frozen. David Gullest, VOA News, Jerusalem.
