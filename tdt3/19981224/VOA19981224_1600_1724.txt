Buying Christmas gifts can be challenging. This is especially true 
when the buyer is getting gifts for 500 strangers. That is what a 
Michigan couple does every year. Lou and Joy Landale of Oak Park, 
Michigan buy hundreds of gifts for residents of Maxi Boys Training 
School. It is a place in Whitmore Lake, Michigan where young people 
go after being convicted of felonies. They are between the ages of 
12 and 21 and because of their age, they not in the adult prison system. 
This year the Landales have bought and wrapped 380 boxes of candy, 
490 bottles of soft drinks, and 600 decks of playing cards for these 
young people. The couple says they do not distribute the gifts themselves 
because they do not want thanks. Joy Landale, who is 70 years old 
said she would like to continue giving these gifts until she is 100 
years old, if she can. Well, I am sure hope she can and I expect she 
will.
