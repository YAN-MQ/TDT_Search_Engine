There will be a very special Christmas Eve dinner for 30 Canadian 
veterans of World War II tonight. They'll be sharing it with some 
of the Germans they fought 55 years ago in the Italian town of Ortona. 
Canadian veteran Ted Griffiths is in Italy. He says the idea to return 
was first raised at a regimental union. We had a Christmas dinner 
on Christmas Eve in this church of Santa Maria in Ortona, which at 
the time was partially destroyed. In this conversation, the padre 
said, you know, it would be a great idea to go back to Ortona sometime 
and have dinner on Christmas Eve in the church, and this time we should 
invite the Germans to join us. More than 2,000 people died in the 
battle for Otogna. Canadian politician Peter Golding explains why 
he helped raise money for the trip. The public hasn't been aware. 
We're getting time and time again kids saying, "We've never heard 
of Ortona until this. We've looked it up and read about it. We didn't 
know that. Were our soldiers over in Italy?" Canadian politician Peter 
Golding.
