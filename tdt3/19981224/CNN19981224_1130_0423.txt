The last sign of a daytime highway speed limit has been lifted in 
Montana. The state Supreme Court said the requirement for "reasonable 
and proper" speed did not warn motorists when they were driving fast 
enough to get a Ticket. That law had been on the books for more than 
40 years. A federal speed limit replaced it in the 1970s, but it was 
restored after congress repealed the federal limit in 1995. The attorney 
general says he'll ask the next state legislature to establish a 75 
mile per hour speed limit.
