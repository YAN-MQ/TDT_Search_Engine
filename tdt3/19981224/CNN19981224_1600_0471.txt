Doctors in Houston, Texas, say the chukwu octuplets will need time 
to improve. All eight are in critical condition at a hospital. Doctors 
are most concerned about the smallest one, she has a heart defect 
common in premature babies. The condition will be treated with drugs 
for now. We were primarily looking for the presence of something called 
a patent ductus arteriosis, which is a blood vessel that connects 
the pulmonary artery to the aorta. And this is normally present when 
the babies are in mom's womb, and normally closes in term babies when 
babies are born. This blood vessel allows blood to bypass the lung 
in mom's womb, since they do not need blood going to the lung. But 
after birth, it normally closes. And frequently in premature babies, 
that does not happen. So we are concerned when they develop certain 
signs that that could be present, and if it is, we usually treat it 
initially with medication. The octuplets' father faces a simple assault 
charge for allegedly hitting his mother-in-law in September. A trial 
date is set for February. His lawyer says the charge is "bogus."
