The lower house of Russia's parliament has given initial approval 
to a draft budget aimed at rescuing the country's sinking economy. 
A political crisis was avoided after Prime Minister Yevgeny Primakov 
threatened to resign if it was rejected. Steve Rosenberg reports. 
It was a day of high drama and horse trading down at the Duma. For 
a time it seemed that the Communists, the largest grouping in the 
Russian parliament's lower house who had earlier promised support 
for Mr. Primakov, had changed their mind. Prime Minister Yevgeny Primakov 
went on the attack, telling deputies he would resign if the budget 
was voted down. When the vote came, it was overwhelmingly in favor. 
Yevgeny Primakov will now be hoping the International Monetary Fund 
shows its approval and agrees to release urgently needed funds to 
Russia early next year. Steve Rosenberg, BBC News, Moscow.
