Russia's lower house of parliament has given initial approval to an 
austerity budget for fiscal 1999. After an emotional plea by Prime 
Minister, Yevgeny Primakov, the communist-dominated Duma approved 
the measure Thursday on a vote of 303 to 65. The document calls for 
government spending of just $29 billion, revenues of $24 billion, 
and a $5 billion deficit.
