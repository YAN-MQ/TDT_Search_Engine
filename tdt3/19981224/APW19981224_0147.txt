India's state-owned oil companies will have to compete with foreign 
firms in exploration bidding under a liberalized policy outlined by 
the petroleum minister Thursday. Petroleum Minister V. Ramamurthy 
was quoted by Dow Jones News Wires as saying the new policy comes 
into effect in January, when government officials begin trips to London, 
Houston, Calgary, Singapore and Perth to tell entrepreneurs about 
48 planned on- and offshore exploration projects. Earlier, licenses 
for such projects were offered only to foreign companies who linked 
up with state-run Oil and Natural Gas Corp. or Oil India Ltd. Now, 
both ONGC and OIL will compete with private companies for exploration 
licenses through international bidding. Licensed companies will also 
be able to sell crude oil and gas in India. The royalty will be fixed 
at 12.5 percent for onshore areas and 10 percent for offshore areas 
and the government will credit half of the royalty from offshore areas 
to a hydrocarbon development fund. To encourage deep water exploration, 
the royalty on such projects will be charged at half the rates for 
the first seven years after production starts. An earlier tax on crude 
production was scrapped and companies will be exempt from import duty 
on goods imported for exploration activities under the new policy. 
The government has also offered a seven-year tax holiday from the 
date of commencement of commercial production under the new policy.
