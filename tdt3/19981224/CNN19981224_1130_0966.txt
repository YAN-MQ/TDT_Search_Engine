In many real estate transactions, an attorney holds a client's money 
for a Period of time. Those escrow accounts earn interest, but as 
Lauren Thierry reports, you may not be the one who gets to keep it. 
When Jerry liung bought a Manhattan apartment, he put $20,000 in escrow. 
The money sat for eight months. At the closing, liung asked his lawyer 
about the interest earned on the money. He said that it was going 
to go to a fund for the poor. We were kind of shocked, and we never 
hear of this. According to laws now in all 50 states, when a lawyer 
temporarily holds a client's money, he has a choice -- We call those 
qualifying funds. That means they're too small or they'll be held 
too briefly to get enough interest to make it worth all the expense 
of opening an account, generating the tax forms and all of that. In 
other words, interest is supposed to go to the poor only in cases 
where a client would have netted little or no money in bank interest. 
In liung's case, the closing dragged on much longer than expected. 
So he might have earned more than $300 in interest. There's no reason 
why not. I mean, it was going to a good cause, but it's nice to know 
beforehand. The legality of this practice is under challenge in the 
courts. A Texas case has gone as high has the U.S. security which 
sent it back to a Distruct court for more factual findings. That's 
your money, Lauren Thierry.
