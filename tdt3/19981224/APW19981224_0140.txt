Prime Minister Girija Prasad Koirala was sworn in by King Birendra 
Thursday to head Nepal's sixth government in four years, the state-run 
Radio Nepal said. His Nepali Congress party has the support of the 
United Marxist-Leninist Communist Party of Nepal and Nepal Goodwill 
Party in parliament. His partner parties are expected to join the 
government by the weekend. Koirala resigned on Monday after his coalition 
partner _ the Marxist-Leninist Communist Party of Nepal _ withdrew 
its support and he lost a majority in Parliament. He came back to 
power with the help of another communist group. The new coalition 
will oversee general elections the government plans to hold by April. 
Until 1990, Nepal was an absolute monarchy, but a pro-democracy movement 
forced constitutional reforms that reduced King Birendra to a figurehead. 
Since then, no party has won a clear majority in Parliament and successive 
governments have been short-lived.
