Coming up next on The World -- going straight to the source. We visit 
Santa at home on PRI, Public Radio International. The World is made 
possible in part by Merck, a research-driven pharmaceutical company 
discovering, developing and manufacturing a broad range of human and 
animal health products and services. Merck, committed to bringing 
out the best in medicine. And The World is brought to you by the Capital 
Group, investing throughout the world for individuals and institutions. 
This is The World. I'm Lisa Mullins.
