While the pros continue in their role of scrooge, hours after the 
league set a drop dead date of January 27th to cancel the season if 
a new collective bargainning agreement is not reached. Commissioner 
David Stern and union director Billy Hunter met in Los Angeles last 
night, and according to an NBA spokesperson, no progress was made. 
However, after taking away the games, the league is doing its part 
to give something back to the fans. Several teams made stops at hospitals 
and community groups in their respective areas to try and spread a 
little holiday cheer. When you give to somebody, everybody benefits, 
not just the person who is receiving. The people who give also get 
something out of it. And you get this real warm feeling inside. I 
call it a championship feeling. You know, we've had it on the basketball 
court, but we could have it, really, every day of the year.
