A herd of wild elephants went on a rampage in India's remote northeast, 
trampling to death at least five people and critically injuring two 
others, a wildlife warden said Thursday. The attack took place Wednesday 
when nearly 50 wild Asiatic elephants entered the village of Tingri, 
near the Ikhipathar reserve forest where many elephants live, the 
warden said on condition of anonymity. An infant was among the dead 
in the stampede, which also destroyed 50 mud huts. Tingri is in Assam 
state, which has a population of nearly 5,000 elephants. Another five 
people were killed in a similar elephant rampage last week in Sonitpur 
area, 150 miles (240 kilometers) north of the Assam capital of Gauhati. 
Anwaruddin Chaudhary, a wildlife expert, said a shrinking habitat 
and a disproportionate rise in the number of elephants in the past 
15 years have led to change in the elephants' behavior. Wild elephants 
have killed nearly 400 people in Assam in the past 10 years, Chaudhary 
said.
