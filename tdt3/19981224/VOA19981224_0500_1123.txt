The U.S. Justice Department and the FBI are investigating bribery 
allegations in Salt Lake City's successful bid for the 2002 Winter 
Olympics. Three other organizations are already looking into the matter, 
the International Olympic Committee, the U.S. Olympic Committee and 
an independent board of ethics in Salt Lake City. U.S. Justice Department 
spokesman Myron Marlin would not elaborate on the possible charges 
or focus of the investigation. He also refused to comment on the scope 
or duration of the probe. Salt Lake City Olympic officials have admitted 
that scholarship and athlete training programs were arranged for some 
relatives of IOC members during the Olympic bidding process. A top 
ranking IOC member has said cities bidding for Olympics have been 
offered block votes by agents in exchange for millions of dollars.
