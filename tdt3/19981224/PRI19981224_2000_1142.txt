Just ahead on The World, our business report from Wall Street and 
an unlikely source of Russian nostalgia on PRI, Public Radio International. 
The World is sponsored by the Capital Group companies, investing throughout 
the world for individuals and institutions. And The World is sponsored 
by Merck, dedicated to the needs of society through pharmaceutical 
research and consumer education to improve the quality of life. Merck, 
committed to bringing out the best in medicine. This is The World. 
I'm Lisa Mullins.
