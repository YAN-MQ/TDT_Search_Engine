The Gause Ghost doesn't move quite as quickly or as stealthily as 
once upon a time, and sometimes even needs the support of a cane. 
The Gause Ghost doesn't even move so quickly in his car anymore _ 
a champagne-colored 1994 Oldsmobile _ and, the indignity of it all, 
he is even more or less grounded when night falls. And when Joe Moore 
Sr., the onetime speedster from Gause, Texas, known as the Gause Ghost 
and, more formally, Jo-Jo Moore when he played outfield for the New 
York Giants in the 1930s and early 1940s, visits his son's home these 
days, he gets a particular reminder. ``When it's getting into evening,'' 
said Joe Moore Jr., son of the Ghost, ``I'll tell him: `Daddy, it's 
getting late. You've got 45 minutes to drive back before it gets dark.''' 
It's twenty-five miles from Gause (or Hearne, where the post office 
is located) to Bryan, where Joe Sr. lives, having moved to the Grand 
Court retirement home in 1995, four years after his wife, Jewell, 
died, and shortly after the house he bought with his World Series 
checks burned down. ``He's really not supposed to drive in the dark 
anymore,'' Joe Jr. said. ``But if you don't watch him, he will.'' 
And Friday will be more of the same when the Gause Ghost visits, though 
just a little bit different. There will be some 50 friends and family 
_ including his two grandchildren and two great-grandchilren _ at 
the birthday bash for him in his son's home. It will combine with 
a Christmas party, for Joseph Gregg Moore, born on Dec. 25, 1908, 
will celebrate his 90th birthday. And it would not be unusual for 
him to share some of his baseball stories with his family and friends. 
After all, he played 12 years in the major leagues, all with the Giants, 
and finished with a .298 batting average, playing also in three World 
Series and three All-Star games. He played for John McGraw, and played 
with or against Babe Ruth and Lou Gehrig and Joe DiMaggio and Bill 
Terry and Carl Hubbell and Dizzy Dean. ``Sometimes the grandchildren 
and great-grandchildren look at him as if he's describing something 
out of the Dark Ages,'' said Joe Jr. ``But it's good times.'' The 
Ghost _ returning to health after having left the hospital last month 
with prostate problems, gray-haired and with a pair of hearing aids 
and purchased teeth, a little shorter and a bit heavier than when 
he played at 5 feet 11 inches, 155 pounds _ may tell about the time 
there was a ``rhubarb'' in the Polo Grounds infield between the Giants 
and the Cardinals. He sat down in left field waiting for it to end. 
Suddenly he saw Pepper Martin, the Cardinal third baseman, come running 
out there. ``I thought, `Oh, oh, this doesn't look so good,' '' Moore 
recalled by telephone from the retirement home the other day, his 
voice stronger than expected. ``I said, `What are you doin' out here?' 
And he said, `I'm gonna sit with you. The last time I got into one 
of those scraps I got hit in the mouth and never saw it comin', turned 
me upside down.' '' Or Moore would recall Carl Hubbell: ``One of the 
best pitchers of all time. Give him a one-run lead and that's all 
he'd need to win. But don't give him 10 runs because he'd allow 9 
and have you runnin' all over the outfield. But he'd still hold that 
one-run lead.'' Besides all-star games, Moore opposed Ruth when the 
slugger, at career's end, played briefly for Boston in the National 
League in 1935. ``He could still hit the ball,'' said Moore, ``but 
not with the same regularity. Age can take care of a lot of things.'' 
He watches a substantial amount of ball games on television, particularly 
those of the closest home team, the Houston Astros, and, as his son 
said: ``Daddy's not always real complimentary about them. He questions 
their resolve.'' ``Sometimes I think they're in it more for the glory 
than for winning,'' said Moore Sr. ``We used to catch those kinda 
balls in the outfield, and not pull up short on the first bounce. 
And we didn't sit out with any little injury. We didn't dare. Or someone 
else would take our job.'' If he were playing today, he said, he believes 
he'd be making ``three or four million a year.'' Which sounds to be 
in the ball park. What does he remember about the World Series he 
played in? ``The last one I played in'' _ 1937, against the Yankees 
_ ``I got nine hits in the five-game series. Tied a record that hasn't 
been broken.'' He recalled that in his first Series _ 1933 against 
Washington _ he tied another record with two hits in one inning, and 
off the same pitcher, Alvin Crowder. ``And he was having a big year,'' 
said Moore. When he retired from baseball after the 1941 season, he 
returned to Gause in central Texas and bought a farm and ranch. ``We 
spent a lot of time chasing after cows,'' said his son. ``It was a 
simple life and Daddy was happy with it.'' As an added birthday treat 
for Moore, a newly created organization, the New York Giants Historical 
Society, founded by its president, Stuart Leeds, a contributing cartoonist 
for The New Yorker, has dedicated the first publication of its newsletter, 
``Giants Jottings,'' to Jo-Jo Moore, the oldest living former Giants 
player. And will Moore be doing anything special for his birthday? 
``Puttin' on another year on myself,'' said the Gause Ghost. ``One 
good thing _ my mind's still good. And that's worth a whole lot.''
