Albanian villages in northern areas of Serbia's Kosovo province. Ethnic 
Albanian officials say government forces sent civilian residents fleeing 
villages near the town of Poteyava. The ethnic Albanians called the 
operation a serious provocation and a challenge to NATO. The head 
of the European observer mission, William Marker, says this latest 
sweep is nothing new. Over the past two weeks or so, we have had three

operation.
