There is great wariness that what officials think he did in Africa, 
he might try in the U.S. here's ABC's John Cochran. Today, the state 
department issued a warning to all Americans, especially those traveling 
outside the country. "Terrorists, including osama bin laden, continue 
their threats against the United States and have not distinguished 
between military and civilian targets." When the United States began 
bombing Iraq last week, American officials were already bracing for 
a terrorist strike, not from Saddam Hussein but from osama bin laden. 
After receiving what they call credible and specific threats, U.S. 
officials put embassies and military bases in Africa and the mideast 
on a High state of alert. As a result of osama bin laden and some 
of his associates, there have been plans that have been in the making 
on their part to attack U.S. facilities. That is why secretary Cohen's 
morale-building trip to the gulf this week was kept secret until shortly 
before he arrived. Officials also believe a terrorist attack in the 
United States is possible, although less likely than overseas. Washington's 
fear is that osama bin laden and his allies could strike now in the 
belief that during the holiday season Americans here and abroad will 
get sloppy about security. U.S. officials say, if anything, they are 
more careful now than they were before the holidays. John Cochran, 
ABC News, the White House.
