It won't be out in time for Christmas, but by this spring, fans of 
minnesota's new governor will be able to get a copy of the doll that 
helped put him into office. Ads for the former pro wrestler showed 
an action figure of him banging a Desk as he threw out a character 
called "evil special interest man." The doll will sell for $19 to 
$24. Ventura says most of the money will go to charity, but he would 
not rule out using some in a future campaign.
