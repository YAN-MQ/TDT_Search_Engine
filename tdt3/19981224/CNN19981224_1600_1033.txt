As stock trading grows more global, the exchange is considering a 
5:00 A.M. start time. The experiment may begin in the year 2000 and 
could pave the way for an earlier start for the trading of U.S. stocks 
as well. We would see perhaps a three-sectioned day, if you will a 
morning session that might begin at 4:00 or 5:00 in the morning, overlapping 
the continent, and trade 4:00 A.M. to 9:00 A.M., take a pause, go 
from 9:00 or 9:30 to 4:00, if that's going to be the New York day's 
session, if you will, and look to trade again later in the evening. 
The earlier trading time will allow the exchange to compete with European 
exchanges.
