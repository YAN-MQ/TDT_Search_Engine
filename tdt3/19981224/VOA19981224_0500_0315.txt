Three balloonists making a nonstop global record bid are streaking 
eastward across the Pacific. The most dangerous part of their epic 
adventure. Britain, Richard Branson; American, Steve Faucett; and 
Sweden's Para Lynstrom, were soaring in a powerful jet stream today 
after passing out of Chinese air space and over Japan. A flight spokesman 
said the balloon will probably reach air speeds of 250 kilometers 
an hour, as it flies at an altitude of 9,100 meters on its transpacific 
flight.
