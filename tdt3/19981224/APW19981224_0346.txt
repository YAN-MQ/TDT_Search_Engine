Despite a U.N. call for peace in Angola, UNITA rebels launched an 
intensive attack Thursday on a central highland city. Rebel forces 
lobbed artillery shells through the night into Kuito, some 500 kilometers 
(300 miles) southeast of the capital Luanda, the private Radio Eclesia 
reported. A local state television employee, who was not identified, 
was wounded in the 10-hour attack that began at midnight, the radio 
said. When the attack died down, Kuito's 100,000 poeople _ swollen 
by people fleeing battles in the surrounding rural highlands _ emerged 
to stock up on provisions and water, Radio Eclesia reported. There 
were no reports Thursday of clashes in the neighboring Huambo province, 
where fighting has also flared this month, undermining a 1994 peace 
agreement brokered by the United Nations. The U.N. Security Council 
on Wednesday blamed UNITA for quashing the 1994 accord, and demanded 
an end to the clashes that have brought months of simmering hostility 
to the surface. In Lisbon, a UNITA spokesman on Thursday accused the 
United Nations of bias for failing to denounce government violations 
of the peace agreement. ``When the government shelled Andulo and Bailundo, 
the Security Council said nothing,'' Carlos Morgado said by phone, 
referring to an army attack three weeks ago on UNITA's two central 
highland strongholds. Once the rebels, equipped with unforeseen fire 
power, had repelled the army from Andulo and Bailundo, they launched 
a broader offensive throughout the central highlands. The government 
has also criticized the United Nations for failing to guarantee UNITA's 
compliance with the 1994 agreement, the latest attempt to end the 
civil war that broke out after independence from Portugal in 1975. 
The pact required UNITA to disband a 70,000-strong guerrilla army, 
and hand over control of almost half the country to the government. 
UNITA _ the National Union for the Total Independence of Angola _ 
has an estimated 30,000 guerrilla soldiers hiding in the vast southwest 
African nation. The government has 100,000 troops.
