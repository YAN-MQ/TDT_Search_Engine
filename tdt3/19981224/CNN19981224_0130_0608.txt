Doctors say a high-tech method to treat brain tumors shows promise. 
Last week, they used the technique, known as "the magnetic surgery 
system" to perform a biopsy on a patient with a brain tumor. With 
the help of a computer mouse, the surgeon guided a needle through 
the patient's brain, bypassing the most sensitive areas. Doctors hope 
to one day use the technique to treat aneurysms, coronary artery disease 
and other ailments.
