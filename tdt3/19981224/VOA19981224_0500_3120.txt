Government officials have approved Hong Kong Telecommunications' acquisition 
of a local Internet company despite fears the deal will drown out 
market competition. Hong Kong Telecom will control 51 percent of the 
growing Internet market after buying Starr Internet. The director 
general of the government's telecommunications authority, says his 
office will modify the license of Hong Kong Telecom's interactive 
multimedia services to insure the market is not run by the monopoly.
