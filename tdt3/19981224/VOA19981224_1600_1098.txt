Traditionally on Christmas Day, there are some professional basketball 
games here in the United States, however, breaking with tradition 
this year, there will be no hardwood play. At least in the pro ranks. 
National Basketball Association commissioner, David Stern, has said 
there will be no season if a labor agreement between team owners and 
players is not reached by January 7. Now Stern has scheduled a board 
of governor's meeting for that day when he will ask 29 owners for 
permission to cancel the season. All he needs is a simple majority. 
Talks on a new deal between the owners and players' union broke off 
two weeks ago. Stern says there are still serious disagreements that 
led to the player lockout July 1. This is not about the owners expecting 
the players to cave and we wanted a strong union. We wanted the players 
to understand that the system under which the owners have operated 
is just not one that makes economic sense. The dispute centers on 
how to split what would have been $2 billion in revenue this season. 
As well as salary caps for the highest paid players. Two months of 
the season have already been lost as well as the all-star game, players 
have lost millions of dollars in salaries.
