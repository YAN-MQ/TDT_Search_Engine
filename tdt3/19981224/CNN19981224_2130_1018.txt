Frequent fliers blessed with more airline miles than they can use 
this holiday season may want to remember, it's better to give than 
receive. Lori Waffenschmidt has more. It's a ritual familiar to every 
frequent flier -- take the flight, get the miles. But if you have 
more miles than you can use, or if your miles are set to expire soon, 
why not give them away? Say, for example, you don't have enough miles 
to claim a trip anyway. You can give your miles to charities that 
are set up by the different airlines. And these charities can take 
the miles and fly ill children to hospitals. They fly volunteers and 
physician researchers all around the world. According to "insideflyer" 
magazine, last year, 162 million frequent flier miles were donated 
to charity -- an impressive number until you consider 32 billion miles 
went unused and expired. To donate miles, call your frequent flier 
program before they expire. Sometimes you get to designate the charity. 
Sometimes you donate them to the program, and they decide which charity 
gets the miles. If you're worried about blackout rules and seat limitations 
plaguing most frequent fliers, relax. Most airlines waive restrictions 
when it comes to donated miles. But don't expect a break for your 
generosity when tax time comes. Miles aren't considered money, so 
you can't do a tax write-off. What you will get is satisfaction, knowing 
your airline miles have been put to good use in the spirit of the 
season. Lori Waffenschmidt, CNN.
