When Father Ignatius Fidgeon holds services at a Roman Catholic Church 
in Johannesburg, some members of the audience barely stop scratching 
and yawning. It's not a sign the parishioners are bored _ the scratchers 
and yawners are Bella and Sasha, two cocker spaniels who accompany 
Fidgeon everywhere. They're even near the altar when he delivers his 
sermons. There haven't been howls of complaints from Fidgeon's congregation. 
In fact, the dogs have become as regular a part of the church as Bible 
reading and the singing of hymns, which _ to almost everyone's relief 
_ the dogs haven't tried to participate in.
