Chancellor Gerhard Schroeder and his Greens party allies insisted 
Thursday that a feud over scrapping nuclear power won't break up their 
2-month-old government. After Schroeder met his Green environment 
minister, Juergen Trittin, on Wednesday to clear up the first big 
coalition crisis, both were quoted as saying they would seek a common 
stand. ``But my task also is to ensure discipline in this government, 
and that's exactly what I will do,'' Schroeder told Bild, Germany's 
most-read daily. Schroeder publicly rebuked Trittin this week for 
firing two advisory bodies on nuclear safety without clearing it with 
him. He said the move jeopardized talks with utility firms on a timetable 
for closing Germany's 19 nuclear plants. Aiming at the Greens, his 
junior partner, Schroeder warned that anyone who questioned the need 
for a consensus with the industry was endangering the coalition. Trittin, 
meanwhile, backed off. ``There is no reason to assume that anyone 
wants to bolt from this coalition,'' he was quoted Thursday as telling 
the newsweekly Der Spiegel. Both he and Schroeder, a Social Democrat, 
remain committed to an ``irreversible exit'' from nuclear power, he 
said. But he criticized the power industry as ``over-sensitive.'' 
``Christmas peace is not in danger,'' Schroeder told Focus magazine. 
Still, other Greens leaders challenged Schroeder's authority, illustrating 
the fractiousness of Germany's first national government including 
the Greens. Party co-chairwoman Antje Radcke backed Trittin's move, 
saying not every government decision had to cross Schroeder's desk. 
``The coalition partners have a communication problem in general,'' 
she was quoted as saying in the Stuttgarter Nachrichten daily. The 
center-left coalition is to meet Jan. 13 to set a common strategy 
for talks with the nuclear industry, which begin Jan. 26. If a voluntary 
timetable for shutting down nuclear power plants is not agreed to 
within a year, the government has pledged to legislate one.
