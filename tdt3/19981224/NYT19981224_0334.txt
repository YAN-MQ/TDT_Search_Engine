Breaking a longstanding year-end tradition among New York governors, 
Gov. George Pataki on Thursday declined to grant clemency to any of 
the hundreds of state prison inmates who petitioned him for early 
release this year. The decision represents the first time in Pataki's 
four years in office that he has rejected every clemency application 
from inmates who claimed that their behavior in prison was so exemplary 
that they qualified for early release. The last governor to reject 
every clemency appeal made to him was Gov. Mario Cuomo, in 1989. Inmates 
who are granted clemency are immediately eligible for a parole hearing. 
In the past, the state Board of Parole has released most of the prisoners 
whose sentences were commuted by the governor. Pataki, like Cuomo 
before him, has used his power to grant clemency sparingly. In 12 
years, Cuomo commuted the sentences of 35 prisoners, far fewer than 
previous governors, like Hugh Carey, who granted clemency 150 times 
in eight years. Pataki has granted clemency to 13 inmates since taking 
office four years ago. New York's governors historically announce 
grants of clemency around the holiday season. To be eligible, an inmate 
must have served at least half of his or her minimum term and have 
shown progress toward rehabilitation or have a terminal illness or 
a chronic disability that would be lessened by release from prison.
