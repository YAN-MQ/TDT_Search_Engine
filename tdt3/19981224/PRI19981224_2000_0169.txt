Russia's ambassador to the U.S., Yuli Vorontsov, has returned to Washington. 
The diplomat was recalled to Moscow last week to protest the attacks 
on Iraq. But he says his return does not mean that Russia has retracted 
its criticism of the military strikes. Meanwhile, Iraq's UN representative, 
Nizar Hamdoon, says Security Council members are not only opposed 
to the military action, now they also want to see an end to sanctions. 
I would say probably the majority of the council members are concerned 
about the continuation of the sanctions and the suffering of the Iraqi 
people. But the American and the British pressure continues on those 
members to try, you know, to address that issue in any significant 
way. Iraq's UN representative Nizar Hamdoon.
