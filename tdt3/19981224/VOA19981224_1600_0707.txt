Albanian lawmakers have given preliminary approval to a resolution 
urging NATO to intervene in Kosovo to halt bloodshed and return stability 
to the Balkans. The statement to be presented for final approval to 
lawmakers Monday blames Serbian authorities for the increasing violence 
in the troubled province. It urges the international community to 
act to prevent what it called ethnic cleansing in the area. The Albanian 
news agency says the lawmakers urged their colleagues from the opposition 
democratic party to end their boycott of parliament and take part 
in Monday's final vote on the measure.
