Boris Yeltsin, who bristles at the notion of being a lame duck, scolded 
his potential successors Thursday for acting as if they were already 
president. ``There is still a year-and-a-half until the presidential 
election, and we already have people who think they are the president,'' 
Yeltsin was quoted as saying by Russian news agencies. The next presidential 
election is set for the middle of 2000, but Yeltsin's health problems 
have spurred some politicians to launch informal campaigns in case 
he leaves office early. The president did not mention any names, but 
appeared to be referring to Moscow Mayor Yuri Luzhkov, who recently 
launched his own political movement and has been speaking out about 
national economic policies and Russia's foreign relations. Yeltsin, 
67, says he has no serious illnesses and will serve out his full term. 
He has been unable to work full-time for months, though he has been 
more active since recovering from a bout of pneumonia earlier this 
month. Other leading presidential contenders are Communist Party leader 
Gennady Zyuganov, Siberian governor Alexander Lebed and liberal politician 
Grigory Yavlinsky.
