State side politics is probably going to be put on hold for the next 
couple of weeks as members of congress are home for the holidays and 
the general public seemed to be more concerned with family and friends 
than political feuds in far off Washington. However, an informal poll 
by U.S. Senate democratic leader, Tom Daschle, shows President Clinton 
is likely to face censure by the senate instead of a long impeachment 
trial. Mr. Daschle said Wednesday, the 100 member senate does not 
have the 67 votes needed to remove Mr. Clinton from office. Now the 
top ranked republican in the House of Representatives, Tom DeLay, 
says if the senators studied all the evidence against the president, 
the votes needed to convict would materialize.
