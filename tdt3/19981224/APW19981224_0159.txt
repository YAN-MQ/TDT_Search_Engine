An investigator into the illegal importation of 3,000 tons of mercury-tainted 
waste from Taiwan said Thursday that it is still unclear who authorized 
the shipment. The local newspaper Koh Santepheap also reported that 
a second dump of thousands of tons of waste had been found near the 
port of Sihanoukville. The waste, resembling videotape, was packed 
in bags with Korean writing. Pol Lim, deputy chairman of the committee 
assigned to investigate the waste from Taiwanese giant Formosa Plastics 
Corp., said the probe is proceeding slowly because import papers do 
not show who approved the shipment. ``There are several irregularities 
in the processing of the papers,'' Pol Lim said. ``We cannot say now 
who or how many people were involved because we have not been able 
to establish any concrete evidence.'' His comments contradicted previous 
assertions from Environment Minister Mok Mareth that the signature 
of one government official was found on papers seized at the port. 
The waste has been blamed for five deaths _ a dockworker who died 
mysteriously after cleaning the hold of the ship that brought it, 
and four people killed in road accidents as frightened residents fled 
the port. The appearance of foreign waste near Cambodia's only major 
seaport underscores the long-standing problem of developed nations, 
which tend to have stronger environmental laws, using poor countries 
as dumps. In Taiwan, Lee Chih-chun, general manager of Formosa Plastics, 
disputed allegations that the company paid bribes of dlrs 3 million. 
Lee said the Cambodian agent was paid dlrs 300,000 for transport and 
disposal. The company has said it had Cambodian government approval 
to import the waste. Taiwanese Prime Minister Vincent Siew ordered 
officials to investigate and clear up any misunderstandings. Cambodia's 
prime minister, Hun Sen, has demanded that the waste be sent back 
to Taiwan. Taiwan's Environmental Protection Bureau has said it will 
send a team to Cambodia with officials from a third country and will 
order Formosa Plastics to take back the waste if proved hazardous. 
Initial tests have shown the waste contains the poisonous metal mercury, 
but the level of toxicity has yet to be determined. More samples have 
been sent to Thailand for analysis. Soldiers armed with shovels and 
protective rubber suits began packing the waste into plastic-lined 
oil drums Wednesday. The cleanup is expected to last more than a week. 
Twenty-nine customs officials from Sihanoukville were suspended in 
the scandal, but so far there has been only one arrest. A court has 
detained the president of the local import-export company that negotiated 
the passage of the waste through customs, Sam Moeurn. He faces up 
to five years in prison for importing a hazardous substance.
