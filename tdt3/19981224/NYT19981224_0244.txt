President Clinton's impeachment was unlikely to figure prominently 
in Christmas Eve and Christmas Day sermons, according to clergy interviewed 
Thursday who said they planned to preach instead on themes like hope 
and new beginnings, as a way of addressing the holiday's Christian 
significance. ``The focus tonight is a different kind of focus,'' 
said the Rev. Doug Slaughter, pastor of Community United Methodist 
Church in Ogden, Utah. He added, however, that he thought it appropriate 
for clergy to speak on the subject. One who said she would refer to 
the political crisis on Christmas was the Rev. Barbara Crafton, rector 
of St. Clement's Episcopal Church in New York. ``My message on this 
day,'' she said, ``is that we must not allow ourselves as a society 
to descend and remain at the level of our basest motivations, but 
must carry forward as the very best we can be as people, not the worst.'' 
She added that she was ``struck by the contrast between the good will 
and extra mile everyone in this neighborhood goes to at this time 
of year. People all over fall over each other being good to others. 
That is in such stark contrast to the venality of retribution, revenge, 
accusation, defensiveness we see in our leaders.'' The Rev. Robert 
Bruce, pastor of First Presbyterian Church in Austin, Texas, said 
that rather than speak about Clinton, he would preach on Christmas 
Eve about ``Christ pulling us toward each other.'' And the Rev. Walter 
Modrys, pastor of St. Ignatius Loyola Roman Catholic Church in New 
York, said he would not mention Clinton in his homily. ``I think that 
people in a parish like this are pretty well informed and have heard 
a lot of the arguments,'' he said. ``I think the important thing at 
Christmas is to address the underlying spiritual and moral and human 
issues and values people need to live by.'' Some clergy said they 
chose last Sunday to discuss the House of Representatives' vote to 
impeach Clinton, which occurred the day before. The Rev. Rick Pittenger, 
pastor of Vincent United Methodist Church in Minot, N.D., said that 
although he did not avoid controversial issues, he did not plan to 
mention the impeachment. ``I think people are tired of hearing about 
it,'' he said, ``and I think they want to hear some good news.'' Earlier 
this month, the Rev. John Hubers, pastor of University Reformed Church 
in Ann Arbor, Mich., said he preached on ``the need for forgiveness,'' 
although without specifically mentioning the confrontation between 
Clinton and Congress. But some clergy said they would make at least 
a passing mention of the impeachment. At St. Bartholomew's Episcopal 
Church in New York, the Rev. William Tully said he would make ``a 
very simple reference'' to the conjunction of the political crisis 
and the Christmas season as a way of talking about God, through Jesus, 
coming into an imperfect world. In his Christmas Eve sermon, which 
he was working on Thursday afternoon, he had written, ``No matter 
where we begin in the Christmas journey, we know we are likely to 
encounter both the world as it is, the world the Christ came to save; 
and the new world begun in the ministry of Jesus.''
