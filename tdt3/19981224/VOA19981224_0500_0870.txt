It is Christmas Eve, and it is one of the most celebrated occasions 
on the Christian calendar. Here in the United States, the day is met 
with a snap of cold weather that has caused hazardous driving conditions 
and crop damage in some regions. But it is also the kind of weather 
traditional for the holiday, and many people are delighted to have 
a white Christmas in their state. Christmas is celebrated in endless 
ways in this diverse nation, but certainly one of the most festive 
places this time of year is the country's biggest city, New York. 
The city is packed with visitors as we hear from VOA's Martin Bush. 
The headline in one New York City newspaper says the streets are paved 
with people. Not only the streets, but the city's hotels are jammed 
as are its theaters and department stores in the last minute, good 
spirited rush to see a Christmas show or to shop for Christmas presents. 
Despite the crowds, many people insist on driving their automobiles 
into the city. That says newspaper traffic columnist, Sam Schwartz, 
gridlock Sam, as he is known, he is both foolish and a waste of time. 
This may be the heaviest day of the millennium. What we have is a 
Wednesday matinee day before Christmas, which is always very heavy. 
We have record traffic volumes that have been coming in all year. 
New York City is booming. In his double-parked commercial van on Church 
Street in Manhattan's financial district, motorist Carl Kronz complains 
the traffic conditions are terrible. Very bad downtown, especially. 
It is just a lot of people. A lot of people look like they are trying 
to get out, so. If you start going from downtown to uptown, traffic 
is very heavy, bumper to bumper. Late Christmas shopper, Cynthia Myla, 
says large crowds are on the city sidewalks and in its stores, but 
the people at this time of year seem generally like a jolly lot. To 
tell you the truth, the stores were quite overcrowded, they were overcrowded 
and they did not have things. But one friendly Christmas shopper, 
Leroy Pones, wearing a floppy red and white hat for the occasion, 
did not seem to mind the mobs of shoppers. Why did you wear a Santa 
hat? To get into season. Martin Bush, VOA News, New York.
