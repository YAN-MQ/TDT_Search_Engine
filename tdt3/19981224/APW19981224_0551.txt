A golden star of Bethlehem twinkles atop Yousif Habboush's Christmas 
tree and silver and blue streamers hang from his dining room chandelier, 
but once again there will be no turkey on the holiday table. In a 
nearby poorer Baghdad neighborhood, Faris Boutros Mehdi shops for 
presents to put beneath his bare, plastic Christmas tree. He can't 
afford to buy his girlfriend a bottle of perfume for 25,000-dinars 
(dlrs-14), about half of his monthly salary. The rich and poor of 
Iraq's 500,000-member Christian community are struggling to celebrate 
the season of peace on earth in a society devastated by eight years 
of U.N. sanctions. Recent airstrikes have only increased the misery. 
``People are celebrating Christmas Day, but inside they are not joyful,'' 
said Matti Shaba Matoka, the Syrian Catholic archbishop of Baghdad. 
``We hope that this year we will have a Christmas of peace.'' This 
year, Matoka will again urge his flock to stay in Iraq and preserve 
a community that traces its roots to the first century, when St. Thomas 
converted the initial Christians. He is fighting an uphill battle. 
About one-third of Iraq's Christians have left the country since sanctions 
were imposed after Iraq's 1990 invasion of Kuwait. Priests say there 
are some traditionally Christian villages in mostly Kurdish areas 
of the north that are virtually abandoned. Although Muslims have also 
fled, many Christians have relatives in the West from earlier migrations 
and have found it easier to leave. Iraq is officially a secular state, 
and most Christians say they face little discrimination. Christians, 
however, make up only about 5 percent of Iraq's 22 million people 
and many feel alienated in the mainly Muslim society. Deputy Prime 
Minister Tariq Aziz _ a member of the Chaldean sect _ is one of several 
prominent Christians in the government, army and the security forces. 
For the Habboush family, which lives in a luxurious white villa, there 
is much to be thankful for this year: No one was hurt during four 
nights of U.S. missile strikes. Habboush owned a construction company 
before the war and has been able to slowly sell off his equipment 
to help make ends meet under punishing U.N. sanctions. ``We are living 
at 25 percent of our earlier standard of living,'' he said. ``I don't 
want it to fall much more.'' His traditional Christmas lunch _ the 
main holiday meal in Iraq _ will consist of lamb soup, fish and chicken. 
Missing will be the turkey, which can cost up to a month's salary 
for an average family _ when it can be found.
