Even with the bad weather making a mess of things this holiday weekend, 
it's worth remembering it could be a lot worse. Almost two months 
ago, hurricane Mitch devastated much of central America. NBC's George 
Lewis is there. Among the two and a half million people in central 
America made homeless by hurricane Mitch, Jorge aguilera, his wife 
and their four children. A stonemason, now unemployed, Jorge had built 
the family's house along a River which swept it away. "we could only 
save some of our clothing and the baby's crib," he says. As his wife 
breaks into tears, Jorge continues. "It's very hard. It's sad to find 
us in this situation." Honduras, seven weeks after the hurricane. 
Bridges still down. Every trip from town to town a painful journey. 
The damage estimates overwhelming. 100 bridges and 3,300 miles of 
road damaged or destroyed. A projected cost of $458 million to replace 
them. In the fields, thousands and thousands of acres of bananas rotting. 
Losses of key crops expected between $700 million and $800 million. 
Thousands of farm workers, who would ordinarily harvest these fields, 
are now out of work. The economy of Honduras, already the poorest 
country in central America, is devastated. He says, "this is desperate. 
A very serious crisis." When Mitch tore through here in the last week 
of October, it swept away structures, automobiles, and people. The 
number of dead, over 5,000. Along the banks of the choluteca river, 
the waters have receded now, leaving behind huge mounds of mud and 
rubble where homes and businesses once stood. For Jorge and his family, 
home now is this Shelter at a tegucigalpa fairgrounds which the family 
shares with almost 500 other people. We asked them what they dream 
of for Christmas. "A job," Jorge said. His wife's wish -- to have 
her house back. And their 14-year-old daughter would like shoes and 
clothing. As they showed us the place where their home once stood, 
a rainbow appeared near the mountains a few miles away. The aguileras 
pray this is a sign that better times lie ahead for themselves and 
their country. George Lewis, NBC news, tegucigalpa, Honduras.
