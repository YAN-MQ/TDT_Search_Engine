Russia conducted five sub-critical nuclear tests at an Arctic testing 
range from September until this month, a top official said Thursday, 
contradicting Russia's previous denials. Such tests are not prohibited 
by the international Comprehensive Test Ban Treaty because the amount 
of radioactive plutonium used is not enough to create a nuclear explosion. 
But critics warn that carrying out even limited tests could encourage 
other countries to conduct full-scale nuclear tests. Deputy Nuclear 
Energy Minister Lev Ryabev said the tests on the Arctic archipelago 
of Novaya Zemlya were conducted between Sept. 14 and Dec. 13, the 
Interfax news agency reported. Weapons-grade plutonium and enriched 
uranium were used during the tests, but ``there was no discharge of 
nuclear energy,'' Ryabev was quoted as saying by Interfax. Western 
news reports and environmentalists claimed in September that Russia 
was preparing a sub-critical nuclear test on Novaya Zemlya. But Moscow 
denied the reports in October, after they had already begun, according 
to Ryabev. Gen. Igor Volynkin, who heads a Defense Ministry department 
overseeing nuclear weapons, said at that time there were no plans 
for nuclear tests at the Novaya Zemlya range and that Russia only 
carries out ``various physical modeling experiments'' that do not 
qualify as nuclear tests.
