Thousands of children in Romania are having a merrier Christmas this 
year, thanks to some British schoolchildren. Paul Davies has the story. 
a familiar figure making the Christmas of some of Europe's most deprived 
children. But Santa, as always, is just the messenger. The presents, 
packed in the familiar shoe boxes, were all sent to Romania by British 
schoolchildren, whose teachers told them in a country the other side 
of Europe, there were boys and girls who were poor, many without parents, 
children for whom this could be the only present this Christmas. Hundreds 
of British schools participated, and an estimated quarter of a Million 
shoe boxes have been distributed across Romania. Father Christmas 
made a special delivery to these sick children at an AIDS hospice 
in the town of chernevoda in eastern romania. These children, who 
all have AIDS or are HIV positive, are shunned in their own community, 
which makes a present from a faraway friend who's even enclosed his 
photograph a bit more special. You can see that the thrill that these 
kids have, just from receiving a box. It almost doesn't matter what's 
in it. It's just a gift. And you can see them, they're clutching the 
box, and some of them, they haven't even opened them, they're so excited. 
The AIDS hospice has already benefited from British generosity after 
it featured in an itn report 12 months ago. Following our visit here 
last year, itn viewers donated enough money to complete a new floor 
here at the chernevoda hospice. This school classroom, one of five 
new rooms for the AIDS children, a Present for this and many christmases 
to come. And the children have already started work on their thank 
you letters. Paul Davies, itn.
