A Kurdish rebel threw herself in front of a military bus Thursday 
and ignited bombs strapped around her waist, killing herself, a passerby 
and wounding 22 people, police said. The attack in downtown Van, a 
southeastern city bordering Iran and Iraq, was the third such suicide 
bombing in three months by rebels fighting for autonomy in the southeast. 
Gov. Abdulkadir Sari said a passerby, reportedly a 15-year-old student, 
was killed. None of the injured, including officers and civilians 
employed by the military, was in critical condition, Sari added. The 
explosion shattered building windows, including those of a military 
residence and the governor's office, the Anatolia news agency said. 
The rebels from the Kurdistan Workers Party, or PKK, have stepped 
up suicide bombings since their leader Abdullah Ocalan was detained 
in Italy on Nov. 12. In two previous attacks, two suicide bombers 
were killed and a total of 11 people were wounded. Italy later released 
Ocalan but refused to extradite him to Turkey, where he could face 
the death penalty on charges of terrorism. The fighting in Turkey 
has claimed some 37,000 lives since 1984.
