Safety officials are also trying to cut down on the number of children 
killed on America's roads. NBC's fredricka Whitfield tonight. Experts 
say one way to lower the death toll of 600 children each year is to 
redesign the way child safety seats fit into cars. Up to 90% percent 
of the time they are potential danger zones because they are installed 
incorrectly -- It's not tight enough. -- or they simply don't fit. 
Very frustrating. It seems like there should be a better way. It's 
a persistent worry for the isons, parents of three and expecting baby 
number four. The seats didn't transfer to different cars. And it's 
why there's a growing push for change in federal car seat regulations. 
A proposal now under consideration calls for standardizing the way 
more than 100 safety seats on the market attach to the more than 300 
types of cars and trucks. The national highway traffic safety administration 
wants new cars to come equipped with a so called universal anchoring 
system. Here's how it could work -- with rounded, rigid bars installed 
in the back seat, safety seats with special attachment hooks would 
snap into place. Child seats when properly installed will increase 
by 70% a child's chances of surviving a crash without serious injury 
and God forbid a fatality. Other experts say the key is to make it 
easier on parents. Because there are over 1,100 combinations that 
can happen in child safety seat, it's awfully difficult for parents 
to quickly figure out how to install them. But concerned consumers 
like the isons will have to wait. The federal government would have 
to approve of any new child seat regulation, and a decision affecting 
millions of American families isn't expected until sometime in the 
new year. Fredricka Whitfield, NBC news, Atlanta.
