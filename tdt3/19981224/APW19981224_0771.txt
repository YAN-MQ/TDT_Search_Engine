Yasuda Mutual Life Insurance Co., one of Japan's top insurers, and 
PaineWebber Inc., a major U.S. securities company, are forming a joint 
investment-trust business, newspapers reported Friday. The two companies 
will set up the venture by February and start selling funds in Japan 
from April through Yasuda Mutual's nationwide sales network, the Nihon 
Keizai business daily reported. The joint venture will be the latest 
effort by Japanese and U.S. financial institutions to work together 
here and will mark the first such investment-trust joint venture company, 
the report said. In October, Wall Street investment bank J.P. Morgan 
and Co. and Dai-Ichi Kangyo Bank Ltd., one of Japan's largest lenders, 
agreed to set up an Tokyo-based mutual fund company. Japan is currently 
implementing its ``Big Bang'' deregulation aimed at creating a more 
liberalized financial market by the early 21st century. The Yasuda-PaineWebber 
venture will be capitalized at 2 billion yen (dlrs 17.24 million), 
the Nihon Keizai and the Yomiuri, Japan's largest newspaper, said. 
Yasuda's affiliate, Yasuda Capital Management Co., will hold 55 percent 
of the new firm's capital, with the remaining 45 percent to be held 
by PaineWebber, the reports said. The two companies were scheduled 
to announce the agreement later Friday, the reports said. Yasuda Mutual, 
which owns 8.1 percent of PaineWebber, has sent more than 100 trainees 
in its asset-management and system divisions for training at the New 
York-based company, the Nihon Keizai said. The new joint venture will 
also handle investments in defined-contribution pension programs, 
which are to be introduced in fiscal 2000 in Japan, the reports said.
