After swiftly convicting three democracy campaigners, Chinese authorities 
will put on trial Sunday a labor rights activist who tried to set 
up a group to assist unemployed workers. Zhang Shanguang is accused 
of endangering state security by passing on intelligence to overseas 
groups, the Hong Kong-based Information Center of Human Rights and 
Democratic Movement reported Thursday. He faces from three years to 
life imprisonment if convicted. His wife said the court in southern 
Hunan province's Huaihua city told Zhang's lawyer about the trial 
on Tuesday, less than the 10 days notification families are supposed 
to receive under Chinese law. Zhang's case mirrors the handling of 
the trials for Xu Wenli, Wang Youcai and Qin Yongmin. The three, among 
China's most prominent dissidents, were arrested last month and charged 
with endangering state security. They were sentenced this week to 
13, 12 and 11 years in prison for trying to organize the China Democracy 
Party. Amid the arrests and trials, Chinese leaders have made strident 
speeches threatening to destroy challengers to Communist Party rule. 
Chinese President Jiang Zemin ordered law enforcement officials Wednesday 
to eliminate any threats to ``social stability.'' Zhang spent seven 
years in prison in the nationwide crackdown that followed the crushing 
of democracy demonstrations in Beijing's Tiananmen Square in 1989. 
After his release, Zhang informed overseas groups about labor protests 
in Hunan, the Information Center reported. Zhang decided in July to 
set up The Association to Guarantee the Rights and Interests of Laid-off 
Workers. He was detained shortly afterwards and has not been let out 
since. The Huaihua court has decided to try him on Sunday to clear 
a backlog of cases before year's end, the Information Center reported.
