For many Americans, December is a month for compulsory shopping sprees, 
with the urgency escalating as Christmas approaches. But for Olivia 
Hewitt, the seasonal panic goes beyond choosing between a Furby (if 
she could find one) or a Barbie for her niece. Instead she wondered, 
``Should I get a fourth pair of glasses, have my teeth cleaned again, 
do a marathon session with my therapist or try acupuncture?'' Even 
though Ms. Hewitt, 31, a paralegal from Fremont, Calif., is in perfect 
health, she faces the odd quandary of having to spend $500 on medical 
care before the ball drops on New Year's Eve _ or forfeit the money. 
And she is far from alone. Her deadline is shared by many of the more 
than 4 million Americans who have Flexible Spending Accounts _ tax-free 
money set aside by employers for health-care expenses not covered 
by insurance. These increasingly popular accounts provide a hefty 
tax break on medical-related expenses ranging from psychotherapy and 
orthodontia to contact lenses, contraceptives and artificial limbs. 
The IRS allows employees to stash away any amount, deducted from paychecks. 
Employers benefit by avoiding payroll tax on that money. ``It's a 
win-win for everyone,'' said Robert Owen, an owner of Choice One, 
a benefits administration company in King of Prussia, Pa. There is, 
however, a hitch. Participants must pick an amount at the beginning 
of each year, and any money not spent by Dec. 31 goes back to the 
boss, who can use it to pay for administering the program. This use-it-or-lose-it 
rule can lead to an unusual spending binge at year's end, often on 
goods and services people do not need. Podiatrists, optometrists, 
dentists, dermatologists, even psychotherapists _ any provider of 
non-emergency care _ love the program, and don't seem to mind having 
their holidays interrupted. Some are even booking New Year's Eve appointments. 
``Between mid-November and late December, anyone who has money left 
in their account comes in trying to get rid of it,'' said Krishan 
Patel, the manager of Medical Optics, an eyeglass shop in Towson, 
Md. ``For us, it's great.'' But some health-care advocates say the 
program may not be so great for efforts to make health care more accessible 
to all Americans. They say it mostly benefits wealthier Americans 
and deprives the government of tax dollars that would be better spent 
providing medical insurance to the working poor. For many Americans, 
though, the immediate problem is the year-end surplus. Aetna Inc. 
estimates that at least two-thirds of its 400,000 customers who have 
flexible spending accounts find themselves with an average of $150 
at the end of November. ``December rolls around and people suddenly 
realize that they have to get busy,'' said Patty Seif, a company spokeswoman. 
``No one likes to lose money.'' But finding a way to spend it often 
provokes more stress than satisfaction. With $400 in her account last 
week, Caroline Power Gangl was flustered. ``I could get a new pair 
of prescription sunglasses or go to the chiropractor and get an adjustment, 
but it all seems so unnecessary,'' said Ms. Power Gangl, 35, a public 
relations executive in Hershey, Pa. ``If I had crow's feet, I'd go 
in for some surgery.'' Some try a little creative bending of the rules, 
which specifically disallow numerous procedures, like liposuction 
and teeth bleaching, by urging doctors to deem all manner of procedures 
medically necessary. A California woman suffering from psoriasis spent 
down her account on a curative bath in the Dead Sea. Another tried 
to use her tax-free savings on exercise tapes; one man submitted receipts 
for a new hardwood floor that replaced the carpeting he said was making 
him ill. ``People will try anything,'' said Debbie Venie Robinson, 
a spokeswoman for Cigna Corp. The company did accept the woman's airfare 
to Israel as a bona fide medical-related expense. But the new flooring 
and the exercise tapes? Sorry. While the last-minute rush is often 
frustrating for account holders, health-care providers can't praise 
them enough. ``It's better than Christmas,'' said Carl Zyskowski, 
the owner of Eyetopia, a chain of optical stores in Hartford. Like 
many opticians, Zyskowski said lots of people find it easier to spend 
their leftover savings on saline solution, disposable contact lenses 
or designer glasses than submit to another physical exam. Some even 
call on Dec. 31 and beg the store to charge their credit card for 
amounts as high as $300. Then, after the new year, they come in to 
use their credit. ``December used to be the slowest month,'' he said. 
``Now it's just amazing.'' Dr. Cary Silverman, an ophthalmologist 
in Parsippany, N.J., said the growth of flexible spending accounts 
has been a boon to his laser surgery practice. The procedure, which 
permanently corrects a patient's vision, costs $5,000 for both eyes. 
Depending on the tax bracket of the patient, that means it is up to 
$2,000 cheaper for those using flexible dollars. ``That's a real incentive,'' 
said Silverman, who sent out notices to patients last month reminding 
them of the savings _ and the deadline. The response has been so good 
he has scheduled several appointments on New Year's Eve. Dr. Harvey 
Zarem, a plastic surgeon in Los Angeles, said he would have to end 
his Christmas vacation early this year. ``We're all jammed up,'' he 
said, ``but I'm not complaining.'' Physicians and dentists also like 
the fact that there are no insurance forms to fill out; patients simply 
submit receipts to their accounts manager. Although federal tax law 
does not allow the money to be spent on purely cosmetic surgery, some 
patients say they get around the rules by asking their doctors to 
describe procedures as medically necessary. ``We had a woman in here 
the other day who wanted breast augmentation and asked us to say it 
was necessary,'' said Dr. Susan Downey, a Los Angeles plastic surgeon. 
``There can be gray areas, but this clearly was not one of them.'' 
Created by Congress in 1984, flexible spending accounts were designed 
to give workers relief from ever-shrinking health-care coverage. But 
to gain the tax-free dollars, account holders had to risk forfeiting 
unused money at the end of each year. IRS officials explained that 
condition by likening the program to health insurance, noting that 
you can't ask for your premium back at the end of the year just because 
you didn't get sick. ``It's wonderful, inexpensive money, but a lot 
of people are dissuaded by the fear of losing what they don't spend,'' 
said Bonnie Whyte, a lobbyist for the council, which estimates that 
nearly a million people lost an average of $156 in 1994, the most 
recent year for which figures are available. The council has so far 
been unable to persuade Congress to make changes in the law. Rep. 
David Dreier, R-Calif., plans to introduce a bill in the House next 
year that would give participants the option of rolling over their 
accounts from year to year, transferring it into an IRA or taking 
any unused money as taxable income. ``The law is silly,'' he said, 
``and has the perverse effect of forcing people to overconsume otherwise 
unnecessary health care.'' Others say the entire concept is misguided. 
``I can't imagine anything more hare-brained,'' said Uwe Reinhardt, 
a health-care economist at Princeton University. ``I wonder what kind 
of fiendish mind is forcing me to get a fourth colonoscopy every year 
so I burn down my account?'' Like other critics, Reinhardt said the 
plan unfairly benefits those in high tax brackets while lower-income 
workers go without any health-care coverage. ``Why are rich people 
getting a 40 percent discount on their kids' orthodontia,'' he asked, 
``but gas station attendants have no insurance at all?'' Even while 
struggling to spend down their accounts, most of those who use them 
say the benefits outweigh the year-end stress and the occasional lost 
money. Even those who put, say, $5,000 in an account but spend only 
$4,000 will probably win out: Assuming a 30 percent marginal tax rate, 
the account has cost them only $3,500 out of pocket, so they are $500 
ahead. Debbie Venie Robinson of Cigna, who called herself ``a poster 
child for flexible benefits,'' says she finds plenty of use for the 
$1,000 she puts aside each year. Some of it goes toward deductibles, 
prescription drugs, contact lenses and co-payments for visits to the 
doctor. She has also had elective surgery on her feet twice, once 
to treat an in-grown toenail and another time to correct a hammertoe. 
``And my daughter is in day care, which is a germ factory, so I'm 
constantly finding good use for the money,'' said Ms. Venie Robinson, 
who lives in Wilmington, Del. ``If it wasn't for these accounts, I 
would probably still be embarrassed to wear sandals in public.''
