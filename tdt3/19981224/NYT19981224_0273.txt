The phones have not worked in years. The banks are empty. The cars 
were looted in the last rebellion. So it is a little surreal, amid 
the hardship of another rebellion, to watch a grubby group of men 
walk into a shop here called Big Joe's, peel open a wadded piece of 
paper and pluck out the ultimate luxury good: an uncut diamond weighing 
nearly two carats. The food shops may be bare, but a dealer sits with 
his chest pocket full of $100 bills, waiting for diamond diggers to 
come in from the bush. ``We are the wealthiest country in the world, 
and yet we have nothing,'' said Bolea Zetu, 40, a diamond dealer at 
Big Joe's, casually offering up the great paradox about much of Africa, 
but Congo in particular: that it is so rich but so achingly poor. 
Unlike the main diamond mining area 400 or so miles south of this 
rebel-held city in the northeast, diamond digging here is mostly small-time. 
Men chance several months, or years, in holes in the forest floor 
near towns like Buta, Banalia, Lubutu. Many are lucky: one of the 
major shops here says that in good times it buys up to 2,000 carats 
of diamonds a month from local diggers and sells mostly to foreign 
traders. But these are not good times. On Aug. 23, rebels seeking 
to overthrow President Laurent Kabila took Kisangani, the largest 
city in what has since become a huge swath of eastern Congo controlled 
by the insurgents. Diamonds play a major role in that insurgency: 
now that the foreigners have fled, industry analysts and dealers say, 
the rebels as well as Ugandans and Rwandans, whose countries back 
the rebels, are buying up diamonds, presumably to help finance the 
war. Most experts believe that the rebels' next target is the center 
of Congo's diamond mining area, the city of Mbuji-Mayi. It is there 
that Kabila's forces and his foreign allies, Zimbabwe particularly, 
are reported to be building up their defense. But the rebellion has 
been hard on the diamond businesses here, whose shops are decorated 
with loud signs painted with gems and wild animals. Elumbu Kalokola 
Kennedy, the president of the city's association of diamond dealers, 
said that before the rebellion last year that ousted the Zairian dictator, 
Mobutu Sese Seko, and brought Kabila to power, there were 465 dealers. 
After he took office, the numbers shrank to 342. That number has slowly 
dropped to a new low of 47 since the latest rebellion began in August. 
The prices? ``Oh-la-la, a catastrophe!'' Kennedy said in French, the 
language of the Belgians who colonized Congo in the late 1800s largely 
on the promise of the nation's great wealth in gold, ivory, rubber 
and palm oil. Several years ago, he said, he could buy a small diamond 
_ a quarter carat or less _ for $160 and sell it for $190. (U.S. dollars 
are the currency here unless a dealer wants to offer a small incentive 
to a digger. Then he might add something extra in Congolese francs, 
which are valuable only in sackfuls.) After Kabila came to power, 
he could buy the same diamond for $140 to sell it at $160. Now, he 
said, he buys that diamond for $100 to sell at $110. ``In the bush, 
the diggers don't want to dig anymore,'' Kennedy said. ``They know 
at this moment their diamonds are worth nothing.'' The prices used 
to be fairly uniform, dealers said, when they could call brokers in 
Antwerp or Kinshasa, Congo's capital. But now there is almost no way 
to get in touch with the outside world. The problem was evident on 
a recent day at Big Joe's, when three men came in with two diamonds, 
weighing 2.2 carats together, and began haggling. They rarely spoke 
aloud what price they wanted. Rather, dealers and sellers alike madly 
punched numbers into calculators, each performing his own mathematical 
theater, and then showed the other side the result. (In an attempted 
sale at another dealer, four beeping calculators blazed at once.) 
``You're asking too much,'' said Gaby Mbula, a dealer who has been 
the manager of Big Joe's since its Lebanese owner fled. ``The diamonds 
are not really nice. They have some imperfections.'' But Lungwa Mulumbi, 
28, the man in charge of the two diamonds, would come down only a 
little. He wanted $615. Mbula was willing to give $550, which another 
dealer pulled out of his pocket to make the money less theoretical. 
The deal died. Mbula said greed was not necessarily the reason. ``Maybe 
those guys who were here were right about the price,'' he said. ``We 
don't know.'' With the lack of foreign buyers, he and Zetu said they 
have so few places to sell that they are stockpiling what they buy 
_ waiting for the day this latest war is over, its duration measured 
in unsold diamonds. ``Even if you brought $1 billion you couldn't 
buy all the diamonds we have,'' Zetu said. ``One million would last 
you five hours.''
