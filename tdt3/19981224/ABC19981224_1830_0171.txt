In the gulf of Mexico tonight, a few miles after an island, there 
is a Giant ship that no one wants T is causing quite a bit of controversy. 
ABC's stove Osunsami reports the Delta pride and its crew are some 
of the latest victims of the economic crisis which is hitting so much 
of the world. "the Delta pride" is out of fuel, out of money and out 
of places to go. The ship had been held for five months in a Mexican 
port while authorities there tried to get the owners to pay their 
bills. The crew, with little food and water, made a run for it. Eventually, 
we decided to come to U.S. water to save our life. The 23 sailors 
on board ran out of fuel three miles off south texas and are now surviving 
on donated food and water. The U.S. coast guard says the 26-year-old 
ship is not in safe enough condition to enter a U.S. port. The owners 
are Pakistanis who say went bankrupt because of the world economic 
crisis and cannot afford to repair the ship. We want them to take 
responsibility, assume financial responsibility for the vessel. If 
they're unable to do that, I'm not sure where they're going from there. 
The Pakistani company responsible for this freighter owns five others, 
and the entire fleet is stranded at sea, each vessel is anchored off 
the coast of a different continent and all of the ships are staffed 
with crew members who haven't seen a paycheck or their families in 
more than a year. Shah jehan Khan is a machinist with a 2-year-old 
son he barely knows. Nighttime, I sleep, I'm too much cry -- my brain 
-- The same thing is happening to other crews on other ships -- two 
teams of Russian sailors stranded off the coast of Scotland, a Greek 
vessel languishing near Brazil, and a multinational crew whose Chinese 
owner abandoned them in Hong Kong harbor. The shipping industry says 
there are too many freighters and not enough cargo. This year alone, 
35 abandoned ships called authorities for help. The Delta pride may 
have to be seized and sold for scrap. But it's all the crew has to 
hold on to. Many of them say they might refuse to leave unless someone 
comes up with enough money to pay their overdue salaries and send 
them home. Steve Osunsami, ABC News, near south padre island, Texas.
