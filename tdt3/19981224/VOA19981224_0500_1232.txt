Some professional women basketball players now out of work because 
of the demise Tuesday of the American Basketball Association may want 
to go to Minnesota. That is one of the cities where tryouts are being 
held for the first women's profession football league. Among the women 
trying to impress the coaches of the Minnesota Vixens is Gina Houser. 
Now while she is not a household name, Houser says she just likes 
to play football. I am into that. I play hockey. I am into the physical 
aspect of the game. It is not only a mental game but it is also physical 
and that is what I am in here for. The new women's professional football 
league hopes to take the field next year.
