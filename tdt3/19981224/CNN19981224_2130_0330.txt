President Clinton says the latest personal income figures show the 
U.S. economy is still strong. Average incomes increased 0.5% in November 
and nearly 5% for the past year. That's faster than the rate of inflation. 
As for the government's finances, the president is calling for fiscal 
discipline, with spending concentrated on education and health care.
