An appeals court has reduced the jail sentence of a former Tehran 
mayor convicted of corruption from five years to two years, a judiciary 
statement said Thursday. The court also reduced to 10 years from 20 
years the period Gholamhossein Karbaschi was banned from assuming 
public office. It replaced his sentence of 60 lashes with a fine of 
dlrs 3,000, statement said. This would be in addition to the original 
fines he was ordered to pay: dlrs 330,000 as punishment and dlrs 200,000 
that he must pay back the city. Karbaschi, a key ally of moderate 
President Mohammad Khatami, had been a target of hard-line political 
rivals, and many Iranians saw the trial as a political settling of 
scores. The judiciary in Iran is controlled by hard-liners. Karbaschi 
was found guilty in July of embezzlement during his eight years as 
Tehran's mayor. He filed an appeal in August. It was not immediately 
clear when Karbaschi, who has been out on bail, will begin serving 
his sentence. During his trial, which lasted more than a month, Karbaschi 
admitted to making mistakes, but denied stealing public money. Karbaschi 
won wide respect for his work as mayor. He built parks and social 
centers and reduced pollution and traffic congestion. But he also 
made enemies among the merchant class, which resented his taxes and 
his support for Khatami, a moderate cleric who believes in relaxing 
the Islamic social code. His pro-Khatami stance also incurred the 
enmity of hard-liners. Riots erupted in Iran soon after Karbaschi's 
arrest in April. For many Iranians, the televised trial gave the first 
insight into Iran's judicial process and moderates saw it more as 
an indictment of the judiciary than the mayor.
