Up next -- the latest on the octuplets. Holding their own tonight. 
I'm very optimistic about the seven babies, excluding the small baby, 
and sort of guardedly optimistic about her. As the babies improve, 
their stunned father talks for the first time about what it's like 
to have eight at a time. And letters to Santa. Not all wishes for 
furby and videogames. What some children ask for just might surprise 
you. A ouncing an amazing discovery. One-A-day has combined the power 
of herbs with vitamins... to help you during the cold season. Support 
your mood, even memory. New from one-A-day. Just what you need... 
to feel your best.
