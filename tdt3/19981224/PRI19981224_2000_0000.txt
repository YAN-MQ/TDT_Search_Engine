From Public Radio International, this is The World, a co-production 
of the BBC World Service, PRI and WGBH Boston. It's Thursday, December 
24. I'm Lisa Mullins in Boston. Today, as fighting escalates in the 
Serbian province of Kosovo, international monitors watch but, for 
obvious reasons, do not intervene. If you're unarmed, you don't step 
out in front of a tank or in front of a machine gun. Also, from the 
Holy Land, a wake-up call to believers everywhere. I fear for Christian 
presence in Bethlehem and in Jerusalem, in Nazareth, in Galilee. The 
church must wake up. And move over Miss Marple, an amazing Mexican 
mystery. First, this news.
