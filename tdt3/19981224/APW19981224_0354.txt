Austrian border police stopped a group of 40 illegal aliens trying 
to cross into the country from Slovakia on Thursday, media reported. 
The 12 Afghans and 28 Iraqis caught on the border early Thursday near 
the town of Kittsee, 40 kilometers (25 miles) southeast of Vienna, 
have all applied for asylum in Austria, the Austria Press Agency said. 
The group is reported the largest to date to be caught on Austria's 
long, open border shared with Slovakia and Hungary. Since Austria 
dropped all border controls with European Union neighbors last April, 
it is under increased pressure to block illegal immigration from formerly 
communist countries to the east. Germany, the destination for many 
would-be asylum seekers and economic immigrants, has expressed particular 
concern about the influx from the east and urged neighbors to tighten 
their borders with non-EU nations.
