U.S. Senate Minority Leader, Tom Daschle, says the Senate does not 
have the votes to convict President Clinton on two Articles of Impeachment 
in the Monica Lewinski scandal. Mr. Daschle made his assessment Wednesday 
after he and Senate Majority Leader, Trent Lott, made a flurry of 
phone calls and behind the scenes talks with senators, several senators 
in fact. I know that Senator Lott is doing what I did which is to 
caucus with his colleagues one by one on the telephone and that takes 
some time. Media surveys show lack of senate support for convicting 
the president, however. Mr. Clinton faces a senate trial next month 
on two articles, perjury and obstruction of justice stemming from 
efforts to conceal an affair with Ms. Lewinski, a former White House 
intern. A vote by 67 of the senate's 100 members to convict Mr. Clinton 
on either article would remove him from office.
