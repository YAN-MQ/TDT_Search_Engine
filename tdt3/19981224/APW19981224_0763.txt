In a Christmas message to his people, President Saddam Hussein said 
that U.S. and British airstrikes on Iraq violated the teachings of 
Jesus and called on all believers to ``face up to these criminals.'' 
Air raid sirens sounded in Baghdad early Friday, but motorists seemed 
to ignore them and light traffic continued to flow in the streets. 
The Pentagon denied carrying out any military action to cause the 
warning. ``I have no knowledge why the sirens have gone off. The U.S. 
Defense Department is not responsible for it, and it's not doing anything,'' 
Pentagon spokesman Glenn Flood said in Washington. There was no immediate 
explanation for the air raid sirens which sounded after midnight. 
A half-hour later an all-clear siren sounded. No anti-aircraft fire 
was heard. It was the first time that sirens were sounded since the 
end of four-day U.S.-British bombings Sunday. In his Christmas address, 
Saddam said the ``rulers of America and Britain... are the enemies 
of God.'' His message was carried by the official Iraqi News Agency. 
``Their criminal aggression was against not only Iraq but also against 
humanity, mankind and the principles called for by Jesus,'' he said. 
He called on all believers to ``face up to these criminals who respect 
no sanctity.'' Some 5 percent of Iraq's 22 million people are Christians 
and Saddam issues a Christmas address each year. The United States 
and Britain launched air attacks against Iraq in the early hours of 
Dec. 17 after the United Nations withdrew its weapons inspectors saying 
that Iraq was blocking their work. Iraq has said it will not allow 
the inspectors to return. INA, quoting an army spokesman, said late 
Thursday that 14 formations of warplanes violated Iraqi airspace in 
the morning. It did not identify the planes or say how many were involved, 
but said they entered Iraq from Saudi Arabian and Kuwaiti airspace. 
It said the planes were out of the range of Iraqi air defenses. Road 
junctions, strategic sites and main roundabouts in Baghdad are still 
patrolled by militia of the ruling Baath Party, a move taken just 
before the airstrikes began. Air defenses remain ready. Iraq's state-run 
newspapers said Thursday that Iraqis will not be intimidated by U.S. 
threats of renewed strikes to force Baghdad to allow the resumption 
of U.N. weapons inspections. The arms inspection teams now exist only 
``in the sick dreams entertained by America,'' the official al-Iraq 
newspaper said in a front-page editorial. The inspectors are working 
to dismantle Iraq's programs to build weapons of mass destruction. 
U.N. sanctions imposed after Iraq's 1990 invasion of Kuwait cannot 
be lifted until the weapons inspectors certify that Iraq is rid of 
chemical and biological weapons and long-range missiles. Iraq says 
more than 40 civilians and 62 soldiers were killed in the strikes 
on some 100 targets. The Babil newspaper, owned by President Saddam 
Hussein's eldest son Odai, warned that the United States and Britain 
might strike again. ``The possibility of military action which they 
wave as a means of psychological terror will not be more than what 
our people and military units have already seen,'' the paper said.
