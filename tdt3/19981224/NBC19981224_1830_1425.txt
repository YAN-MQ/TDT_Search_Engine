More on the recovery effort in central America tomorrow night. When 
we come back, what happens to those letters to Santa? A happy ending 
next. I work out to keep my body in shape. To help keep my mind sharp 
I take NEWr uanterra ginkgo biloba. It helps me concentrate, maintain 
focus. Why quanterra? All ginkgos aren't the same. The patented quanterra 
extract was proven safe and effective by doctors in extensive clinical 
trials. And it increases oxygen supply to the brain. With new quanterra 
mental sharpness I feel my best, naturally. These days, everything's 
faster. So how come pain relief isn't faster? Introducing Advil liqui-gels-- 
on tough pain, they're stronger and faster... than extra strength 
Tylenol. New Advil liqui-gels. Pain relief just got faster. It's acid. 
It Burns. It travels up. Like a fire in my chest. A terrible taste 
in my throat. If heartburn has you by the throat, you may have the 
toughest heartburn... for this, doctors recommend gaviscon. Only regular 
gaviscon forms a soothing, protective barrier to help keep stomach 
acid down, where it belongs. Mylanta can't. Pepcid ac can't. Only 
gaviscon can. Better. Relief. Sleep.
