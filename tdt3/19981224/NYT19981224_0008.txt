In the world of the Devils, where defense is often top banana, a hat 
trick is a rarity. There was only one for New Jersey last season and 
none in the first 30 games this season. Bobby Holik ended that spell 
on Wednesday night by scoring the Devils' last three goals and leading 
them to a 4-2 victory over the St. Louis Blues at Continental Arena. 
Holik's hat trick gave him 15 goals for the season and helped the 
Devils to their first victory in three games. Scott Niedermayer scored 
the other goal for the Devils, who regained the top spot in the Eastern 
Conference with a record of 19-8-4. ``I felt more responsible how 
the team did tonight,'' said Holik, who was made alternate captain 
for the game because the captain Scott Stevens missed the game with 
back spasms. ``When you're wearing the A, it's an honor.'' Ken Daneyko 
and Denis Pederson are the two regular alternate captains. Holik has 
been playing noticeably better since his two-game suspension by the 
league last month. During the ban, Holik took the time to work with 
the assistant coach Slava Fetisov on his shot release and accuracy. 
``I had almost a week to relax and practice hard with no pressure 
of being ready for the game,'' Holik said. ``I just regrouped myself. 
It may be a coincidence to the outsider but not for me. I looked at 
the suspension as a time to get myself together.'' His three goals 
tonight gave him a total of 15, tops on the team and five more than 
the next players, Petr Sykora and Dave Andreychuk. ``Every time you 
step on the ice and you work hard, things happen,'' Holik said. ``It's 
the result of hard work and effort.'' This was the third career hat 
trick for Holik and his first since 1992. Holik, who had 29 goals 
last season, had no hat tricks in Jacques Lemaire's five-year tenure 
as coach of the Devils. ``There will be a few more,'' Sykora said. 
``We have a lot of guys who are capable to get a hat trick.'' Martin 
Brodeur played goal after missing practice with pain in his ribs and 
improved his record to 15-7-4 with 23 saves. The only Blues players 
to beat him were Pavol Demitra and Todd Gill, both in the first period. 
Stevens practiced the last two days and took part in the morning skate 
before Wednesday night's game, but his back stiffened up before the 
game and he was a late scratch, forcing him to miss his first game 
this season. Stevens injured his back after being hit with a shot 
by Montreal's Jason Dawes in Saturday's tie in Montreal. With Stevens 
out, Coach Robbie Ftorek was forced to shuffle his defensive pairings. 
Dean, who usually plays with Stevens, was teamed with Lyle Odelein. 
The other defensive pairings were Niedermayer with Brad Bombardir 
and Daneyko with Sheldon Souray. Niedermayer opened the scoring for 
the Devils with his third goal of the season and it came the Devils' 
first manpower advantage. Taking a pass from Patrik Elias, Niedermayer 
beat Grant Fuhr 6 minutes 30 seconds after the opening face-off. After 
Demitra matched Niedermayer's goal and Gill brought the Blues back 
following Holik's first goal of the night, Holik gave the Devils the 
lead again at 3-2 with his second goal of the night, 8:09 into the 
second period. He completed his hat trick with 9:50 left in the third 
period, when he beat Fuhr with a rising shot from the right circle.
