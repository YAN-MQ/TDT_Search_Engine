Retailers on rodeo drive are also getting in the holiday spirit. But 
as Gloria Hillard reports, don't expect to find any bargains. Dancin' 
and prancin' in jingle bell square in the frosty air Now, on rodeo 
drive, there's no frosty air, unless it's from the cold cash. Rodeo 
drive -- shopping home to the stars, made famous by the movies like 
"Beverly Hills cop" and "pretty woman." What do you say we go Christmas 
shopping? First stop, tiffany's. Remember the movie, "breakfast at 
tiffany's"? It isn't that I give a hoot about jewelry, except diamonds, 
of course. We still get a lot of people coming in our stores in various 
locations, asking when we're serving breakfast. You can't even get 
a latte, but you can get this diamond and sapphire necklace. $435,000. 
And the ring would add another $28,000 to it. The bracelet is $210,000. 
Or you could get a bracelet that tells time. The price on this is 
$22,500. The next stop, hermes of Paris, where they have the furby 
of handbags -- it's called the birken. There's a waiting list of about 
a year to two years. And the price is $5,000. At chanel, you can get 
an electronic gift card for up to -- $1 million. Oh, it's just like 
one of those phone cards. No wonder the Beverly Hills Christmas parade 
featured dancing shopping bags. We do have quite a few celebrities 
shopping here. Unfortunately, I can't give that information out. Now, 
don't look for the presents under this tree. It's $1 million. No candy 
cane ornaments here. But for your ice cream, there's -- This is the 
flora Danica ice cream dome -- for $25,000. And on rodeo drive, you 
can buy a cigar and then rent a home for it for $180 a month. And 
how much are those cigars? $350. $350? Each. $450 each. And $550 each. 
Buy a bottle of wine, mouton rothschild, you pay $600, $700 a bottle. 
Sure. Or more. A nice margaux from 1892 might be -- might be just 
the ticket. And how much is the ticket? The ticket is about $4,000. 
So if you want cheese to go with that wine -- This is a truffle cheese 
-- For $50 a pound. This bicycle for two is $3,000. You can also get 
a fluorescent cape for your dog. $39.95. But if your dog has more 
expensive taste, there are these dog collars from $300 to $500. It's 
for the well-traveled, well-heeled dog. On rodeo drive, the well-heeled 
dog would also have to be a Patient one. Gloria Hillard, "CNN Entertainment 
News," Beverly Hills.
