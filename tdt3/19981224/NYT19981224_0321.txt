The New York Times said in an editorial for Friday, Dec. 25: The only 
clear message from the recent plebiscite in Puerto Rico is that the 
question of the island's political future remains deeply divisive. 
Congress' failure to sponsor orderly balloting that would give the 
island's 3.8 million voters a meaningful say about their political 
status has not helped. Earlier this year the House passed a bill that 
would have set up a congressionally approved referendum for Puerto 
Ricans on whether the island should retain its current commonwealth 
status, seek statehood or become an independent nation. If statehood 
or independence received a majority vote the federal government would 
develop a transition plan, leading to a vote by Congress for a status 
change within 10 years. Both the Republican and Democratic parties 
have long supported Puerto Rican self-determination. But the Senate 
blocked the legislation and simply said it would review the outcome 
of any nonbinding local vote. The recent ballot, prepared by the Puerto 
Rican government, was crowded with five options: statehood, commonwealth, 
independence, free association or none of the above. Negative campaigns 
mounted by both the statehood and commonwealth camps contributed to 
``none of the above'' picking up 50.2 percent of the vote. Much of 
that was a protest vote from the pro-commonwealth camp, which saw 
the ballot as misleading. The statehood option, championed by Gov. 
Pedro Rossello, received 46.5 percent of the votes, far more than 
the other options but not enough to win. Much of the debate has focused 
on what is possible under a commonwealth status. Puerto Ricans currently 
have U.S. citizenship, and are subject to federal laws and the draft. 
But they do not pay federal income tax and do not vote for president 
or elect voting members of Congress. Some commonwealth supporters 
fear that statehood would jeopardize the island's Spanish-based culture, 
and have argued that getting enhanced rights from the federal government 
is possible without becoming a state. Pro-statehood advocates reject 
that position as unrealistic. Congress can reduce the confusion by 
crafting a referendum with input from Puerto Rican leaders on all 
sides that accurately reflects the options available. ``None of the 
above'' does not move Puerto Ricans any closer to defining their future.
