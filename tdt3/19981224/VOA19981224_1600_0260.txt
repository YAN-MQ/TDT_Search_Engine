The three adventurers flying a balloon over the pacific ocean have 
reached the half way point in their quest to be the first to fly a 
balloon nonstop around the world. They reached the midpoint Thursday 
while flying from Japan to the West Coast of the United States. Britain, 
Richard Branson; American, Steve Faucett; and Sweden's Para Lynstrand, 
were riding the jet stream at more than 200 kilometers per hour. And 
according to project manager, Mike Kendrick, doing some holiday decorating. 
Unfortunately, we forgot to pack their Christmas decorations. And 
so we have sent them some drawings of how to make their own with a 
Swiss Army knife and some paper. We put them some Christmas carols 
on board. The balloon is hoped to be over the U.S. West Coast on Christmas 
Day.
