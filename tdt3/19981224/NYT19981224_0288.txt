Sen. Daniel Patrick Moynihan of New York made clear on Thursday that 
President Clinton should be censured but not removed from office, 
warning that the moves to oust Clinton might threaten to ``very readily 
destabilize the presidency.'' Speaking out for the first time about 
possible Senate action, Moynihan questioned whether the charges were 
strong enough to merit Clinton's removal from office. He said he had 
consulted many of his colleagues and was increasingly confident that 
there was support among Democrats and Republicans to move rapidly 
to cut short a prolonged impeachment trial. His comments will bring 
a measure of relief to the White House, where some officials had feared 
that Moynihan, who has broken with the president often in the past, 
might again turn on Clinton. His seniority, scholarship and independence 
make him an influential member of the Senate. ``We are an indispensable 
nation and we have to protect the presidency as an institution,'' 
Moynihan, a Democrat who has been a fixture of American politics for 
five decades, said in a telephone interview from his home here, where 
he was preparing for a Senate trial by reading The Federalist Papers. 
``There has to be a commander in chief,'' he said. ``You could very 
readily destabilize the presidency, move to a randomness. That's an 
institution that has to be stable, not in dispute. Absent that, do 
not doubt that you could degrade the republic quickly.'' While Moynihan 
stopped short of saying exactly what form of a compromise he would 
endorse, he left no doubt of his support for censure. Asked if he 
backed censure, he replied, ``You obviously can infer that.'' Moynihan 
declined to say whether he thought a censure deal could avert a full 
trial in the Senate, and he did not disclose with whom he has met 
in the Senate to discuss the matter. He also did not explain why he 
believed Clinton's actions did not warrant his conviction by the Senate. 
Because Moynihan is known for his strict interpretation of the Constitution, 
supporters of a censure compromise had feared that he might argue 
that censure had no constitutional basis. He had been critical early 
on of Clinton's failure to adequately apologize for his affair with 
Monica Lewinsky and his conduct after it became public. And in a television 
interview weeks ago, he said that perjury might be an impeachable 
offense. The senator is particularly credible because it would be 
difficult to portray Moynihan as acting out of concern for his own 
electoral prospects; last month, he announced that he would not run 
for re-election when his fourth term ends in 2000. Asked whether he 
was driven by partisan loyalty or by his concern for the presidency, 
Moynihan said emphatically, ``It's the institution.'' In the interview 
on Thursday, Moynihan expressed great annoyance that Clinton staged 
a rally with two busloads of congressional Democrats on the South 
Lawn of the White House after the impeachment vote in the House. He 
suggested that Clinton had turned a somber day for the nation into 
a political spectacle. ``If the rally was meant for the president's 
spirits, that was just fine,'' Moynihan said. ``If it was meant to 
influence the Senate, that's just wrong. We take an oath. Our oath 
is to the Constitution, to uphold and defend the Constitution.'' Moynihan 
also invoked his concerns about the Constitution when asked whether 
he would support levying a fine on Clinton as part of a censure arrangement. 
``Bad, bad, bad!'' he said of the idea. ``Wrong, wrong wrong!'' He 
explained: ``I'm sure the people who are proposing it are doing so 
in perfectly good faith. Impeachment is not about punishment. The 
Constitution is very clear.'' For those who think Clinton should pay 
a fine, he said, ``It might be dealt with elsewhere. We are not a 
court.'' Despite his belief that a compromise would be reached, Moynihan 
said he could not be certain. ``The question is, `Do these allegations 
rise to the level of high crimes and misdemeanors?' '' he asked. ``And 
we will have to judge. We will have to make up our minds. The list, 
high crimes and misdemeanors, begins with treason, bribery.'' Although 
he made clear that he was not pleased with how the House acted in 
voting to impeach Clinton, Moynihan refrained from directly criticizing 
the other chamber. ``Look, they had responsibilities on the House 
side and they carried them out in a manner that is not enviable,'' 
he said. ``No one would wish that on them. I don't have any animus 
whatever.'' Imploring people to read the Constitution, Moynihan said, 
``Pick up the Constitution. Read it. They came to their judgment. 
Now it's with us.'' While he did not suggest a timetable, the senator 
said he hoped that there would not be a drawn-out trial. He said that 
even if a proceeding ran for a month, he did not consider that particularly 
long. ``What's a month in the beginning of a new Congress?'' Moynihan 
asked. ``We never do much more than organize, go back home for a bit 
and wait for the State of the Union.'' Asked if he thought Republicans 
would suffer politically from the party's handling of impeachment 
matter, Moynihan snapped, ``Oh, I don't know and I don't care. This 
is a time to think of the Constitution.''
