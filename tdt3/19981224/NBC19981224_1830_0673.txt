It was meet the press today for the doctors and father of America's 
best-known newborns, those octuplets in Houston. And dad had some 
pretty good news to pass on in his first public appearance. NBC's 
Pat Dawson explains. The babies are still in intensive care, but the 
father of the world's only living octuplets finally emerged today 
admitting he is stunned, but elated. What do I think? Glory be to 
be God. Glory be to be God. It's perfect. The first baby was born 
at Houston's St. Luke's hospital December 8th. Then, four days ago, 
nkem udobi gave birth to the other seven infants in this intensive 
care Ward. Doctors say the infants will all be in critical condition 
for weeks, but they're doing better than expected. I'm very optimistic 
about the seven babies, excluding the small baby. And sort of guardedly 
optimistic about her. The oldest -- a baby girl small enough to fit 
in the palm of a Hand, was born 15 weeks premature. The others, 13 
weeks premature. At birth, the combined weight of the eight babies 
was barely ten pounds. The parents, naturalized American citizens 
from Nigeria, have now replaced the dry, hospital titles of baby a 
through H with names in the tradition of their tribe. Each an African 
name that refers to God. It's a miracle and we decided to glorify 
God for the blessings. Unlike the McCaughey Septuplets born a year 
ago, the udobi births have been practically anonymous. The parents 
preferring to stay out of the media spotlight. Still, since the news 
broke, people from across the country have pledged money and sent 
donations. Everything from tires and Internet access to more traditional 
gifts. We're talking about 1,000 diapers a week, so a lot of work 
needs to be done. Doctors say most of the babies are doing so well, 
they plan to try taking them off ventilators tomorrow. A small step 
for eight tiny infants. A wonderful Christmas present for their parents.
