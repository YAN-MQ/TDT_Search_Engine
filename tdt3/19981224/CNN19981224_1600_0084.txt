Much of the U.S. has been struck hard with winter weather this Christmas 
eve. Dangerous driving conditions have caused dozens of deaths. In 
parts of the south, a mixture of snow, sleet and freezing rain is 
likely. In New York, snow fell for the first time this season. As 
much as four inches are forecast by tonight stretching from Kentucky 
into southern New Jersey. Many people might just be in for a white 
Christmas after all. Added to the snow and the ice is a bone-chilling 
cold.
