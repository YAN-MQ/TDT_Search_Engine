A trio of balloonists soared over the Pacific Ocean on Thursday at 
high speed, bound for North America in their attempt at the first 
nonstop balloon voyage around the world. British tycoon Richard Branson, 
American millionaire Steve Fossett and Per Lindstrand of Sweden caught 
the jetstream after their passage over China on Wednesday and quickly 
gathered speed. By 0815 GMT their helium and hot air ICO Global balloon 
was moving at 150 mph (240 kph), and about 1,000 miles (1,600 km) 
into the Pacific, said ground crew director Mike Kendrick. Kendrick 
sounded ``a note of concern'' about a weather pattern developing over 
the ocean Pacific. ``We are a bit nervous,'' he said. ``We're not 
panicking yet,'' he told Sky TV, explaining that a trough of high 
pressure was about 2,000 miles (3,000) from the balloonists. ``If 
we can average about 125 knots (145 mph, 230 kph) over the next 12 
hours, or maybe 24 hours, we should be okay,'' he said. Kendrick has 
described the Pacific leg of the journey as the most hazardous, saying 
the frequency of shipping is not very high, so that if the balloonists 
had to ditch their craft the rescue would be more difficult. He said 
ground crew were tracking the position of all ships that would be 
under the balloon in the Pacific. ``If we fall out of the jetstream 
into this trough over the Pacific then there is only one way, and 
that is back to Hawaii and they are going to go for a swim,'' Kendrick 
told Sky TV later. He said the crew had been told to ascend to 30,000 
feet (9,000 meters) to try to pick up the speed needed to avoid this. 
``The situation is that the higher you go, the more fuel is used. 
So usually you trade speed for fuel,'' he said. ``At the moment I 
am not interested in fuel. I need speed because we want to try and 
keep them dry.'' ``We are not that concerned at the moment, but we 
are just driving it very hard,'' Kendrick said. ``It is a very dangerous 
place and we are not taking any chances.'' The ground crew said that 
the 272-foot-high (83-meter-high) balloon might cross into North America 
at Washington State or southern Canada, Ground crew said the craft 
is flying at 27,000 to 30,000 feet (8,000 to 9,000 meters) as jumbo 
jets do, and could be visible from the ground if the weather is clear. 
They said it was hoped the balloon would reach North America on Christmas 
Day, most likely in the evening. Balloon pilots navigate by changing 
the lift of the balloon to ascend or descend into different wind systems, 
and cannot plan their courses and speeds precisely. The halfway point 
on the voyage, which began in Morocco on Dec. 18, is in the Pacific 
Ocean. The trip is expected to last from eight days to nearly three 
weeks and finish in Western Europe at the end of a 24,000-mile (38,000 
kms) flight. The team secured permission from 97 countries for overflights 
and initially had only four refusals _ Iran, Iraq, Russia and North 
Korea.
