Time now to answer today's Christmas Eve geography quiz. We're looking 
for a cold region comprising parts of four countries, and in one of 
them resides the season's most popular gift-giver, Santa Claus. The 
answer is Lapland. And this is the busiest post office in all of Lapland 
today. It's in the Finnish village of Napapita. Employees like this 
woman assume the role of Santa's helpers and postmark letters to boys 
and girls all over the world. I'm Santa's helper, and I work in post 
office. I sell stamps, and I receive and send letters. And we send 
a lot of post from here, maybe hundreds of thousands of letters. Since 
1950, when they started counting, Santa and his postal helpers in 
Napapita have replied to more than five million letters. Radio is 
the culprit for the crazy overtime that Napapita postal workers have 
to put in around this time every year. In 1925, Finnish radio announced 
as a gag that Santa Claus, who was said to live in the North Pole, 
actually lived in Lapland, specifically in Finland. So many letters 
came to Finland that the government had to place Mr. Claus somewhere 
more specific, and the village of Napapita got stuck with the task. 
You can write to Santa Claus here at Napapita, and he can answer you. 
Or if you want to be sure to receive a letter, you fill this form, 
which costs 30 marks and Santa Claus will send a letter. So what is 
Santa's address? Santa Claus, Arctic Circle, Finland. And yes, Virginia, 
Santa Claus really does live in Napapita, Finland. And visitors come 
from afar. Visitors like Rosie and Daniel who traveled from England 
to meet the jolly old elf. Rosie and Daniel have come a long way to 
see me. How many days have you traveled? two. Two days. And you came 
from a warm place and now you are in the middle of the snow and winter. 
Have you done any winter sports? no. No reindeer ride yet? Yes, yes. 
That's what you have done. How did you like the reindeer? It was very 
nice. Good. You were not afraid. no. No. Fine. OK, now we can have... 
Incidentally, The World is heard in Finland in Helsinki. Perhaps that's 
why Santa Claus sent us this personal greeting. Ha, ha, ha, ha. Hello, 
everybody. This is Santa Claus speaking from the Arctic Circle in 
Lapland in Finland. I wish all the listeners of The World a very merry 
Christmas and a very happy New Year.
