Analysts say the week's activity represents a classic year-end rally 
with investment managers anxious to add to their before the end of 
the fourth quarter. But some investment managers such as Wayne Nordberg 
of the KBW Company, say it is time to accumulate the stocks of smaller 
companies, which have lagged behind the major averages. I think in 
a year where the underlying conditions are going to be OK for financial 
assets, I think money has to flow into deeper value if the market 
in general is going to make much headway. A report shows Americans 
are increasing their investments in stock mutual funds, reflecting 
growing confidence about the outlook for the stock market next year.
