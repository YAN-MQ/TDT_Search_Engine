There was not a tree in sight, let alone one with decorations, and 
instead of snow they had sand, plenty of it, but some 1,000 U.S. Marines 
tried to make the best of Christmas Eve in the Kuwaiti desert on Thursday. 
The chaplain of the 31st Marine Expeditionary Unit read from the Bible. 
The cooks served a hot dinner of lasagna, baked beans and rice. And 
the troops contributed their own sense of the occasion. ``We will 
light a candle, sing Christmas carols, and exchange rocks for presents,'' 
said Sgt. Tony Williams of Waco, Texas. Lance Cpl. Michael Morris 
recommended the dinner's crumb cake. It was extra crunchy, he said, 
with sand. Morris said he found it hard to ``get in the mood of Christmas'' 
in a windswept camp 20 kilometers north of Kuwait City. Back home 
in Cedar Rapids, Iowa, the festive season is usually ``very snowy.'' 
The marines arrived in Kuwait earlier this week. They were deployed 
as part of the operation in which U.S. and British forces carried 
out four days of airstrikes against Iraq to punish it for its alleged 
obstruction of U.N. weapons inspectors. The United States stationed 
some 5,000 troops in Kuwait to protect the oil-rich state from an 
Iraqi counterattack. Baghdad's troops invaded Kuwait in 1990 and occupied 
it for seven months before being driven out by a U.S.-led coalition 
in the Gulf War. Cpl. Robert Katz of New Rochelle, N.Y., said Christmas 
was about being with the people dearest to your heart, and ``we're 
all friends and family here.'' He said the men had held a competition 
in their trenches to see who could etch the best Christmas tree or 
stocking on the sandy walls. ``Whatever we can do for morale,'' Katz 
explained. As Sgt. Williams put it, ``we were not afforded the opportunity 
to buy things, so we have to make do with our surroundings.'' However, 
the troops will have a real Christmas present on Friday. They are 
being flown out of the sandy wastes to USS Belleau Wood, their amphibious 
assault ship in the Gulf. On board they can expect a Christmas dinner 
with all the trimmings that the U.S. Navy can provide.
