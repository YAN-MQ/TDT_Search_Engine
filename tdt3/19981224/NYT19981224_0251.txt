He might have called it ``Stadium! Stadium!'' Or, in a more classical 
allusion, simply ``The Coliseum.'' Instead, Michael Ilitch, the owner 
of both the Little Caesars pizza chain and the Detroit Tigers baseball 
team, last week sold the naming rights for the Tigers' new stadium 
to Comerica Bank, which will pay $66 million over 30 years. The ball 
park, scheduled to open in 2000, will join more than 40 other major 
league stadiums and arenas in North America that have been named for 
corporate sponsors _ about half of all the venues for professional 
baseball, football, basketball and hockey. There are enough, in fact, 
that the commercialized parks merit a league of their own. So Money 
and Business has created standings, based on the year-to-date stock 
performance of the corporate sponsors of arenas and stadiums now in 
use or under construction. The companies were assigned to divisions 
based on the locations of the buildings they sponsor, with eight or 
nine in each of the four United States divisions and a separate division 
for the five arenas in Canada. The geography keeps Pepsico from competing 
against itself: Its Tropicana Field, home of the Tampa Bay Devil Rays 
baseball team, is in the Southern division, while the Pepsi Center, 
future home of the Colorado Avalanche hockey team and the Denver Nuggets 
basketball team, is in the Central. With the quickening pace of new 
stadium construction and the rising demand for naming rights, more 
expansion teams can be expected to join the Arena League before long. 
The Detroit Lions, owned by William Clay Ford, plan a new stadium 
next to Comerica Park, which will be named for the Ford Motor Co. 
Finding correlations between stock prices and on-field performance 
awaits a sponsor for the research.
