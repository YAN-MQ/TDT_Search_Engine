It is designed to be or look like or represent the star of Bethlehem, 
but unfortunately, many people are mistaking it for a ship from outer 
space. It all happens in Maryville, Tennessee during this and the 
last several Christmas seasons. You see, the First United Methodist 
Church has put up a lighted weather balloon to represent the star 
of Bethlehem. Why they picked a lighted weather balloon, I do not 
know. The balloon is tethered 60 meters above the church and can be 
seen from several kilometers away. The display is part of a live nativity 
scene. But some people see it at a distance and think they are seeing 
a UFO, an unidentified flying object. Which is probably a reasonable 
conclusion. It is indeed an unidentified flying object. Yes, that 
is what the Air Force has always told us. That was not a UFO, it was 
just a weather balloon. That is right. Pastor, James Green, of the 
First Methodist Church says that people rush up the church in their 
cars to report the possible alien spacecraft until the Air Force pulls 
up and says no, no what really happens is they get a clearer view 
of the balloon, and discover their mistake. And then they take off 
for Roswell or New Mexico, right, yes. Infamous place where UFOs are 
spotted you know, yes.
