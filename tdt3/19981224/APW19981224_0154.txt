A dlrs 1 trillion infrastructure spending plan to stimulate China's 
economy won't result in troubled banks being saddled with more bad 
debt, a top regulator said Thursday. The Finance Ministry will supply 
most of the money itself and monitor spending closely to minimize 
unproductive outlays, said Wu Xiaoling, head of the Shanghai branch 
of the Chinese central bank. The three-year spending plan for new 
highways, bridges and other projects is meant to boost a slowing economy. 
At 7.5 percent to 8 percent this year, growth is robust for Asia but 
not enough to create jobs for millions of workers laid off in reforms 
of state-owned industry. The government also has tried to spur the 
economy by easing lending restrictions on state banks, leading to 
fears that would increase uncollectible loans. Wu insisted regulators 
were watching to make sure that didn't happen and said only about 
1 percent of spending on the infrastructure program was expected to 
wind up in unproductive assets. Wu was named head of the Shanghai 
branch of the People's Bank of China last month in a restructuring 
meant to create a regulatory agency modeled on the U.S. Federal Reserve 
System. She said the government was gradually reducing bad assets 
by injecting capital into the banking system. Uncollectible bank debts 
or loans on which payments are temporarily suspended are equal to 
25 percent of bank assets nationwide, Wu said. In Shanghai, she said, 
that figure stands at about 10 percent.
