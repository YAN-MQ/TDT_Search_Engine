Pakistan warned Thursday that a military deal between neighboring 
India and Russia was the precursor to a ``massive new weaponization'' 
drive in South Asia _ home to the world's two newest nuclear powers. 
A foreign ministry statement condemned the new defense pact on military 
and technical cooperation recently signed by its uneasy neighbor India 
and Russia. ``We are heavily concerned and dismayed that at the turn 
of the millennium, when promotion of peace and economic development 
are the focus of endeavors in other regions, South Asia must bear 
the burden of massive new weaponization for the fulfillment of India's 
hegemonistic goals,'' the statement said. Pakistan and India have 
fought three wars since the South Asian subcontinent gained its independence 
from Britain in 1947. In May the two countries exploded underground 
nuclear devices and declared themselves nuclear powers. The international 
community moved quickly to slap on economic sanctions, which have 
since been relaxed because of the danger, particularly to Pakistan, 
of economic collapse. However the United Nations, and the United States 
in particular, has been pushing India and Pakistan to scale back their 
military might to avoid a nuclear arms race on the volatile subcontinent, 
home to more than one billion people. Calling the agreement between 
India and Russia a ``dangerous development,'' the Pakistani foreign 
ministry statement warned that it will only hurt attempts at negotiations 
between the two countries. With more weapons in India's arsenal, Pakistan 
said New Delhi will be less inclined to negotiate and more inclined 
to use military force in regional disputes, most notably the 51-year-old 
Kashmir dispute. Pakistan and India have twice gone to war over the 
Himalayan state, which both countries lay claim to. They fought a 
third war in 1971 over Bangladesh or what was then East Pakistan. 
Kashmir was split between the two countries by departing British rulers. 
Since then both India and Pakistan claim a united Kashmir.
