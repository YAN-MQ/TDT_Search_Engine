Editors from Burkina Faso's three independent daily newspapers suspended 
publication Thursday to mourn and protest the death of a prominent 
colleague. The state-controlled daily ``Sidwaya'' in the capital Ouagadougou 
was printed, despite a call by the country's journalists union to 
halt publication for a day to mark the death of Norbert Zongo. Zongo, 
an outspoken government critic and independent newspaperman, was found 
dead Dec. 13 in his burned-out car. The charred remains of two cousins 
and his driver were also found in the car. The Burkina Faso Journalists 
Association has called for an independent investigation by foreign 
observers into Norbert's suspicious death. Only the inside of Zongo's 
car was burned, while the exterior was undamaged, raising suspicions 
that he and the others were the target of an attack. The French-based 
Reporters without Borders has questioned the circumstances of Zongo's 
death. News of his death triggered several days of mass protests in 
Burkina Faso, including a series of clashes between mourners and police.
