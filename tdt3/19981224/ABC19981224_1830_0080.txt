Good evening. The winter weather is again a major story tonight. Snow, 
ice and cold are making for difficult travel all over the U.S. holiday 
travelers frankly have faced a mess. There have been major airport 
delays and in the state of New Jersey, police are investigating whether 
snow on a highway may have been a factor in the crash of a tour bus 
that killed at least eight people today. Here's ABC's Mark Mullen. 
The bus was on its way to Atlantic City when the driver lost control. 
It lunched through a guardrail and rolled down an embankment. Some 
of th22assengers were thrown from the bus before it stopped. We have 
a lot of severely injured people as well. Many of the injured waited 
hours in frigid temperatures to be extricated, including one passenger 
who was trapped beneath the bus. Though snow had fallen overnight, 
officials say that stretch of the New Jersey turnpike had been plowed. 
They're investigating why the bus went off the road. In other parts 
of the nation, it was sometimes difficult to keep roadways clear. 
In Washington, D.C. and in Washington state. Rain is common in Seattle, 
but snow is not. Ice was the big problem in many cities, including 
Nashville. It was just crazy. People trying to go up there and nobody 
was able to make it up the hill. And when they would get up there, 
they'd start sliding back into other cars. Forasrs are calling for 
snow in many U.S. cities on Christmas day. Mark Mullen, ABC News, 
New York.
