The U.S. state department is warning Americans traveling overseas 
to keep security in mind during and after the holiday season. The 
department says it issued the worldwide travel caution because of 
tensions raised by the recent military action against Iraq and the 
arrests of subjects in the August embassy bombings in Africa. Officials 
say the caution is only a reminder and not related to any specific 
threats.
