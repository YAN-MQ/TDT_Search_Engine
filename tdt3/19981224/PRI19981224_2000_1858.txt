The man who Washington says is the mastermind of the bombing of two 
U.S. embassies in Africa last summer says he wasn't involved. But 
the U.S. wants Osama bin Laden extradited, that is, from Afghanistan. 
Owen Bennett-Jones reports from Islamabad. In his first public statement 
about the allegations made against him, Osama bin Laden said, "I had 
no hand in the bombings in Kenya and Tanzania." "But," he added, "I 
feel no sorrow over the blasts." He said that he was confident that 
the Taliban authorities in Afghanistan would not expel him. The Taliban 
has said that it considers bin Laden to be a guest in Afghanistan, 
but the movement has instructed him not to become involved in any 
hostile activity against another country. Owen Bennett-Jones, BBC 
News, Islamabad.
