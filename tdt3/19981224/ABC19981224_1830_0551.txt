Tonight we'll take "A closer look" at the wer of Christmas all over 
the world. It is already Christmas in much the world. Pope johnpaul 
II celebrated midnight mass tonight. Santa claus made an appearance 
in Baghdad this morning. There are several hundred thousand Christians 
in Iraq. And in Cuba, they are starting over. Fidel Castro outlawed 
Christmas three decades ago. This year, of course, the Pope came to 
Cuba and now Christmas is a national holiday again. As ABC's Deborah 
Amos reports from Havana, Cubans are rediscovering the power of the 
holiday. Cubans jammed Cathedral square and joined in Christmas prayer 
and song. Even this holiday jazz concert began with the music of a 
Catholic mass. Christmas is back, and Cubans are freer than ever to 
celebrate not just at home, but in public. But Christmas cannot change 
certain economic realities. While the government lowered prices on 
the holiday's traditional food, even christmas decorations are too 
expensive for the average Cuban family. These trees are only for the 
tourists. Jingle bells jingle bells jingle all the way And Cuban children, 
who are just learning the Christmas traditions already expect something 
more. I ask Santa claus to bring me a beautiful bashry. Nintendo. 
Toys that aren't available in Cuba, but brought here by those who 
have Cuban-American relatives. There is now more risk of turning Christmas 
into a business kind of thing. It's not exactly what church leaders 
had in mind. This week the archbishop called on Cubans to remember 
the religious meaning of Christmas. So Churches are promoting the 
message. And Cubans have responded by flocking to church classes. 
Jesus was born poor, says this minister. At this Catholic church, 
the poor get a free lunch with the Christmas story. Church leaders 
say it will take time for the country to relearn the religious meaning 
of Christmas. As for the Cuban government, this week the official 
communist newspaper labeled Santa claus a troublemaker, a symbol of 
U.S. consumerism. Deborah Amos, ABC News, Havana.
