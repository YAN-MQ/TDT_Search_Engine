NATO has expressed concern about the escalating tension in Yugoslavia's 
Kosovo province saying the provocations and violence must stop immediately. 
Speaking Wednesday in Brussels, Secretary General Javier Salana said 
the alliance is watching the situation very closely and is ready to 
act to end the violence. He also warned both Yugoslav authorities 
and ethnic Albanian separatists not to take advantage of this Christmas 
and New Year period to undermine the fragile security situation.
