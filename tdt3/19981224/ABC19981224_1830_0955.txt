Tonight we go face-to-face with the man the U.S. has long considered 
the most dangerous terrorist in the world, osama bin laden. After 
the bombings of the U.S. embassies in Kenya and Tanzania, U.S. intelligence 
named bin laden as the man responsible. Just weeks later, the U.S. 
fired missiles at bin laden headquarters in afghanistan. No one has 
seen him since, it was not known for certain if he survived the attack. 
Well, he did. And we talked with him last night. With an ABC News 
exclusive report, here's John Miller. In the same breath osama bin 
laden denied that he was behind the bombing of two U.S. embassies 
in east Africa, but said he supported the bombings, and knew some 
of the suspects who were charged. These are two men we hold in the 
highest esteem. Bin laden's meeting with ABC News, just last night, 
puts to rest speculation by U.S. intelligence agencies that the elusive 
Saudi millionaire was wounded or killed. Bin laden said he was not 
in his camps when the U.S. missiles struck, but bin laden told us 
that he survived an assassination plot that he says was ordered and 
financed by a Saudi prince. They were offered large sums return for 
meeting me. But I was not hurt. Since the embassy bombings and the 
U.S. counterstrike on bin laden's camps in Afghanistan, we have been 
seeking another interview with bin laden. Yesterday, rahimullah yousafsai, 
an ABC News producer in Pakistan, was hastily summoned to a tent that 
had been set up in the afghan wilderness. There, under security, bin 
laden broke his silence and renewed his fatwa, a Religious decree 
calling for attacks on the U.S. and Israel. We are confident that 
the Muslim nation would rid Islamic countries of the -- While bin 
laden denied that he ordered the embassy bombings, he stopped short 
of denying another frightening charge, that he tried to develop chemical 
and nuclear weapons. If I seek to acquire such weapons, this is a 
religious duty. How we use them is up to us. Bin laden's latest message 
to America did give little comfort to american authorities who say 
they have already prevented four bin laden-sponsored attacks overseas. 
Those authorities remain on high alert. John Miller, ABC News, New 
York. That high alert status, speaks volumes about Washington's reaction 
to bin laden's denials.
