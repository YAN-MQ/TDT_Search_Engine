Doctors in Houston, Texas say the world's only surviving octuplets 
are progressing well. Dr. Patty Saverick says the medical team is 
excited about the babies' progress. But she says the smallest is still 
sicker than the others. Doctors say the mother remains in stable condition. 
The proud father E. K. Louie Udibal expressed gratitude for the two 
boys and six girls. I am excited and grateful to God for giving us 
these blessings. Houston's Nigerian community is mobilizing to build 
a support system for the Nigerian- born parents.
