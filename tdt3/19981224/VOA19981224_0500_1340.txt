And finally, Sang Lon, the Chinese gymnast paralyzed in a fall during 
this year's goodwill games in New York, will help bring in the new 
year in New York City. The 17 year-old Sang will share the honor of 
lowering the big ball in New York City's Times Square on New Year's 
Eve with Mayor Rudolph Juliani. Sang says this is a special honor 
not only for her, but also for Chinese people.
