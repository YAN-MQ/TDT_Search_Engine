The curse of the anterior cruciate ligament has struck women's college 
basketball again, but fortunately for the University of Tennessee, 
the latest injury is less serious than feared. A week ago, a torn 
anterior cruciate ligament in the left knee ended the season of Sue 
Bird, the freshman from New York City who was starting at point guard 
for Connecticut (8-0), the nation's top-ranked team. Now Tennessee 
(9-1), the three-time national champion and ranked second this season, 
has lost its starting center, Teresa Geter, for its game against 15th-ranked 
Rutgers (9-2) at Madison Square Garden on Jan. 3, the first appearance 
of women's collegiate basketball at the Garden since the 1981-82 season. 
But Geter is expected to return for the Vols' game against UConn on 
Jan. 10 at Storrs, Conn. Geter, a 6-foot-3-inch sophomore from Columbia, 
S.C., hurt her right knee Monday night during Tennessee's 100-77 victory 
over UCLA. Thursday, Dr. William Youmans, the school's orthopedic 
surgeon, performed arthroscopic surgery to determine whether Geter 
had a tear in her anterior cruciate ligament that would need reconstructive 
surgery. A complete tear would probably have ended her season. A spokeswoman 
for Tennessee, Debby Jennings, said that doctors found the ligament 
was only stretched. Geter was scheduled to leave the hospital Friday 
and is expected to resume practice in two weeks in anticipation of 
playing against UConn. Geter was playing 24 minutes a game and averaging 
7.4 points and 5.4 rebounds. Tennessee, meanwhile, will be regaining 
a player. Kyra Elzy, a quick 6-1 shooting guard who tore the anterior 
cruciate ligament in her right knee last Feb. 1, will return when 
the Lady Vols resume practice Sunday.
