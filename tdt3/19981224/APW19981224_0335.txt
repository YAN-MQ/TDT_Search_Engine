Serb forces backed by tanks and artillery launched a strong attack 
Thursday on a Kosovo rebel stronghold, setting fire to houses and 
killing at least one person, ethnic Albanian sources said. The Kosovo 
Information Center, close to the province's ethnic Albanian leadership, 
said Serb police and military were targeting six villages near Podujevo 
and had sealed off all roads leading to the area, 30 kilometers (20 
miles) north of the provincial capital, Pristina. Hysni Fazliu, a 
spokesman for the party of leading ethnic Albanian politician Ibrahim 
Rugova, said rebels were resisting the attack and a ``fierce battle'' 
was underway. The operation marks a significant setback to the cease-fire 
agreement that ended the worst of the fighting between secessionist 
ethnic Albanians and Serb security forces. Between February and October, 
1,000 people were killed and another 300,000 lost their homes. Jorgen 
Grunnet, a spokesman for the Organization for Security and Cooperation 
in Europe, confirmed that international observers had reported shelling 
and machine-gun fire in the area but had no details of fighting. Grunnet 
said a convoys of Yugoslav army vehicles, including several Russian-built 
T-55 tanks, were seen Thursday morning leaving bases in Pristina and 
Podujevo. He said the OSCE, which is monitoring the October cease-fire 
accord, had no reports of casualties. Grunnet said Yugoslav authorities 
described the attack as a ``limited search operation'' for suspects 
in Monday's killing of a Serb policeman in the area. On Wednesday, 
U.S. State Department spokesman James Rubin warned of the increasing 
violence. ``A large-scale crackdown against the civilian population 
of Kosovo would do nothing to improve the security situation and could 
spark a cycle of violence that would seriously undermine the cease-fire 
agreement,'' Rubin said in Washington. On Thursday, the chief ethnic 
Albanian peace negotiator, Fehmi Agani, called the Serb operation 
a ``very serious provocation'' and a ``a bold challenge to NATO,'' 
which had threatened airstrikes in October to halt the fighting. According 
to the report, Serb tanks had already entered one of the villages, 
Lapastica, a stronghold of the Kosovo Liberation Army, which is fighting 
for independence from Serbia, the main republic of Yugoslavia. The 
report said at least one ethnic Albanian villager was killed in the 
sweep and several houses were set ablaze. There was no comment from 
Serb sources. ``This offensive confirms our worst fears that the Serbian 
regime planned to use the Christmas holidays to launch an action aimed 
at ethnically cleansing the north of Kosovo,'' said Xemail Mustafa, 
a spokesman for the province's ethnic Albanian leaders. Mustafa urged 
U.S. and European governments and international monitors of the two-month 
cease-fire to get Yugoslav authorities to halt the attacks. Lapastica 
is a KLA command post for the north-central region of Kosovo, including 
Pristina. Rebel commanders are based in a walled compound, and new 
recruits are trained there. The initials ``UCK'' _ the Albanian language 
abbreviation for the KLA _ is painted in large black letters on a 
wall at the entrance to the village, and rebel fighters had been guarding 
the dirt road leading to the village. On Wednesday, two top NATO officials 
warned both sides in the separatist province against launching more 
attacks. The alliance's supreme commander, Gen. Wesley Clark, complained 
of ``increasingly aggressive Serb military and police activities.'' 
Speaking to reporters in neighboring Macedonia, he said NATO is watching 
closely to ensure that Yugoslav President Slobodan Milosevic keeps 
his promises under an October agreement reached with U.S. envoy Richard 
Holbrooke to halt the bloodshed. NATO Secretary-General Javier Solana 
echoed those concerns, saying in Brussels that the escalating violence 
and killings in recent days ``pose a grave risk to the cease-fire.'' 
``We remain fully vigilant and ready to act,'' he said. Clark said 
the stepped-up police activities did not conform to Milosevic's pledges 
in an Oct. 12 agreement. He reiterated that Milosevic and top military 
commanders in Belgrade have been told they ``must comply with their 
promises made to NATO.'' NATO's supreme allied commander for Europe 
spoke on a visit to the alliance's 1,800-strong extraction force, 
deployed in Macedonia in case international monitors in Kosovo are 
threatened.
