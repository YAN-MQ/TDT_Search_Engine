Under fire English soccer chief Keith Wiseman hit back Thursday in 
the Football Association's cash for votes bribery scandal by claiming 
he is the victim of a plot to remove him from office. The FA chairman 
became embroiled in controversy when it revealed that he and chief 
executive Graham Kelly made an unsanctioned 3.2 million pound (dlrs 
5 million) grant to the Welsh Football Association. Kelly and Wiseman 
promised the money without telling the rest of the English FA's executive 
committee and the payment has been interpreted as a bribe to gain 
a Welsh vote in Wiseman's favor in an election for a FIFA post. Kelly 
resigned Tuesday but Wiseman refused to tender his resignation despite 
a unanimous vote of no confidence against him by his committee. Instead 
he called for the full 91-member FA Council meeting to decide the 
issue Jan. 4. Wiseman has continued to dispute the grant was made 
in return for a Welsh vote in his plan to become Britain's FIFA vice-president. 
``I regard it as simply mutually beneficial arrangements,'' Wiseman 
was quoted saying Thursday. ``There are people, members of the FA 
council I am quite certain, who would like to take advantage of the 
crisis for their own ends,'' he said. ``There are those who feel it 
is a time when the whole question over who has control and power over 
what within football should be reviewed _ and that's a mild way of 
putting it.'' Kelly has also insisted the payment was not a bribe 
and was in keeping with the F.A.'s policy of helping cash-strapped 
soccer federations. ``With hindsight it would have been better to 
come up front (with the executive committee) much more quickly than 
we did,'' he said. ``That was not a deliberate act and it was something 
which didn't get done in the heat of the moment.''
