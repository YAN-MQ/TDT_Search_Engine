For The World, I'm Derek Stothel in the BBC newsroom in London. Ethnic 
Albanian rebels in Kosovo say they're partially calling off their 
cease-fire. The Kosovo Liberation Army says it's responding to a major 
Serbian offensive against their villages. The BBC's Paul Wood reports. 
Under the original terms of the cease-fire declaration made in October, 
the KLA retained the right to fire if fired upon. In light of what 
appears to have been a major offensive by the Serbian security forces, 
the ethnic Albanian rebels have now declared an end to the cease-fire 
in the area under attack. Serbian officials had warned Western diplomats 
that they weren't prepared to stand by as KLA fighters used the breathing 
space provided by the threat of air strikes to move into positions 
vacated by the security forces. Diplomats say this probably puts Belgrade 
in breach of the UN resolutions. That means NATO air strikes are back 
on the international agenda. Paul Wood reporting.
