Two sailors linked by misfortune and tenacity were battling mountainous 
waves Thursday as the 14-yacht fleet pressed on toward Auckland, New 
Zealand, and the finish of Leg 2 in the 1998-99 Around Alone race. 
The French solo sailor Isabelle Autissier faced gale-force headwinds 
in the Southern Ocean as she coaxed her damaged yacht PRB toward Tasmania 
for repairs, an Australian Maritime Safety Authority spokesman told 
Agence France-Presse on Thursday. And the American Josh Hall filed 
a riveting account of the dangers involved in driving a 60-foot yacht 
in angry seas. The 42-year-old Autissier, fourth in the 27,000-mile 
race around the world, was expected to reach Tasmania late Christmas 
night to make emergency repairs to the mainsail and electrical equipment. 
``A strange celebration for Isabelle,'' said a spokesman for Autissier, 
``whose only Christmas present will be a piece of new sail track. 
But it's a priceless gift because it means she can continue her voyage.'' 
Within hours, Autissier intends to set sail to complete the 6,884-nautical 
mile leg from Cape Town, South Africa to Auckland. But northerly winds 
in excess of 33 knots ahead of a cold front due to pass over Tasmania 
on Saturday threaten to slow the progress of a yacht which, because 
of damage, cannot increase or reduce its mainsail. ``She will experience, 
if not gale-force, very close to gale-force winds tomorrow,'' an Australian 
Bureau of Meteorology spokesman said. ``The northerly winds will intensify 
throughout tomorrow as the cold front approaches the coast. It could 
make headway quite difficult.'' At one stage, Autissier had led the 
16 yachts that set out from Charleston, S.C., on Sept. 26, but she 
has been substantially set back by the sail damage and the Tasmanian 
detour. Two yachts have dropped out of the fleet, and at last report 
the leader in Class I, Giovanni Soldini of Italy, was 1,222 miles 
from Auckland, with Marc Thiercelin 237 miles back in second and Mike 
Golding third. Four years ago, Autissier was rescued from the Southern 
Ocean by the Royal Australian Navy at an estimated cost to taxpayers 
of $6 million Australian dollars ($3.6 million U.S.) after her yacht 
was disabled during the BOC Challenge round the world race. Like Autissier, 
Hall lost his boat in the 1994-95 race and had to be picked up in 
the mid-Atlantic by the Australian competitor Alan Nebauer. His current 
experience sounds similarly demanding: ``By midnight Tuesday, the 
yacht had become more of a submarine as we powered along, surfing 
on the growing swell, hitting 25-27 knots boat speed,'' Hall said 
in an e-mail. ``Most of the time, solid water was gassing across the 
cabin windows and into the cockpit. ``I was standing down below having 
to hang on, white-knuckled, as we hopped, skipped and torpedoed our 
way into the blackness. Outside, the amount of solid water sweeping 
the deck was amazing. I opened the door to a veritable Niagara Falls.'' 
As conditions worsened, Hall decided that it was prudent to lower 
the mainsail. To accomplish that, he had to crawl out onto the deck, 
clip himself to the rail to keep from being thrown overboard, and 
loosen a halyard, the line that hoists the sail. The maneuver proved 
to be even more harrowing than it sounded. ``I clipped on and crawled 
to the mast for the halyard release,'' Hall wrote. ``As far as the 
eye could see the black ocean was slashed with white streaks where 
waves were breaking. The sea was angry and the sky screamed at it; 
this is a raw night. ``The halyard released, hands almost numb with 
cold already, I squirmed around to crawl back and froze as I felt 
the boat rise awkwardly to a huge wave. ``In one of those microseconds 
that at the time feels like an age, I knew I was about to get nailed 
_ hard. I swung to give the mast a bearhug just in time to meet half 
the southern Indian Ocean marching down the foredeck. My white-water 
ride ended up hard against the running backstays at the back of the 
boat.'' Despite the experience, Hall remains in high spirits. He is 
actually enjoying sailing in the Southern Ocean, tested by what yachtsmen 
believe are the world's most challenging nautical conditions. ``It's 
completely and utterly awesome down here, not sure if it's very smart 
to be here, but it is awesome,'' Hall wrote. ``I do feel sad that 
I am missing the run-up to Christmas at home, though. Our boys will 
be so excited by now, and I'd like to have seen that.'' More race
