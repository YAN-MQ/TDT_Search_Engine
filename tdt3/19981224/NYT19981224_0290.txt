On the pine-covered campus with its man-made waterfall, much remains 
the same at Microsoft's world headquarters. The sodas are still free. 
Employees are encouraged to take breaks by congregating on the many 
basketball courts or around whimsical game machines, all part of what 
is known at Microsoft as the ``Sneakernet,'' the face-to-face contact 
that company officials say is vital, even as people here spend much 
of the day communicating via computer. And workers continue to swap 
stories about the famous ``e-mails from Bill,'' the messages that 
can pop up at any hour of the day from the company's co-founder and 
chairman, Bill Gates. One employee in the games group recalls a predawn 
missive from the leader. ``I just tried out the new version of Monster 
Truck Madness,'' Gates wrote. ``Here are five things I liked about 
it and here's what I think we could do better.'' But with the company 
embroiled in a critical antitrust case in the nation's capital, and 
ceaselessly depicted by federal prosecutors and competitors as the 
ruthless bully of the cyber world, the nearly 15,000 workers here 
have a rude reminder that the high-tech behemoth is not necessarily 
the master of its own fate. Even as they generally say they remain 
focused on their own projects and simply trust that company lawyers 
will prevail in court, the case lurks on the Microsoft campus, a large 
menace that no one really wants to acknowledge but that can hardly 
be ignored. ``I have a 75-year-old neighbor and he keeps telling me, 
`I feel so bad for you, because I worked for AT&AMP;T and we went 
through all that,''' said Rick Thompson, vice president of the hardware 
group, who is in charge of everything from a futuristic remote control 
for computers to product development of an interactive children's 
toy, referred to at the company as the ``Barney Project,'' as in the 
big purple dinosaur. Thompson tells his neighbor that the analogy 
with the breakup of the telephone company does not hold. ``You can't 
just say, `Oh, Nevada goes to this one, Illinois will go to this one,''' 
Thompson said. ``Microsoft is not at all like that. It's not the way 
things work. I just don't think it's going to happen.'' The outcome 
of the case may not be known for years. And in an industry where technology 
seems to change at warp speed, many Microsoft employees seem perplexed 
when asked about the critics' contention that the company can flatten 
its competition or dominate markets at will. Echoing the view that 
Gates has expressed repeatedly, they insist that the company has to 
run just as scared as anyone else. ``I know that right now there are 
three kids in a garage somewhere coming up with an idea that will 
make me have to rethink everything I know about what I'm doing today,'' 
said Marissa Martinez, a program manager for a group that makes sure 
company products are immune to the year 2000 problem. ``We rely on 
having that competition. That's just the way this industry is.'' Though 
virtually no one here says that the antitrust case has distracted 
them from their work at the company, the matter can take a psychological 
toll. The company is an American success story and remains widely 
admired, but the praise is no longer universal, and snippets of news 
coverage include things like this recent testimony from a government 
witness: ``Microsoft cannot point a gun to people's heads, but they 
can make them an offer they can't refuse.'' To hear many of the young 
workers here (the average age of employees is 34.4) tell it, proffering 
a Microsoft business card no longer draws a standard response of ``Cool.'' 
``It's a major bummer,'' said Todd Stevens, a 28-year-old product 
manager in the action games group. ``It used to be when I told people 
what I did at Microsoft, they'd want to know what game I was working 
on. Now it's `What's going on with that trial?''' Stevens shrugs off 
criticism of the company, likening it to a college football team that 
wins a bunch of national championships. ``You either love Notre Dame 
or you hate Notre Dame,'' he said with a laugh. ``Everybody has an 
opinion.'' For others, especially those whose job it is to worry about 
integrating a range of Microsoft products, the criticism is more bothersome, 
especially the argument advanced by Microsoft critics that the company 
could easily separate technical features like its Internet browser 
from the rest of its software. ``It's frustrating when you're trying 
to do what you think is a really good thing,'' said Julie Larson, 
group program manager for a unit that develops software for designing 
and managing World Wide Web pages. ``I think they don't fully understand 
what customers are asking for. They want this increased seamlessness 
between different applications. This is all driven by what people 
are asking us for.'' In Washington, D.C., of course, government lawyers 
are arguing almost the opposite position, that the company has insisted 
on knitting its own program for searching the Web and other features 
into its Windows software in a relentless bid to control the market, 
not to make things more efficient for consumers. As the case unfolds 
and that issue is debated, many on the campus are angry that the government 
is already offering solutions as radical as dismantling the company. 
``All this discussion about breaking up the company borders on the 
wacky,'' said Brad Smith, an associate general counsel for Microsoft. 
``From our perspective, it's really unfair and unreasonable that government 
lawyers are out there touting these aggressive remedies before Microsoft 
has even put its first witness forward in the courtroom.'' As the 
company fights its legal case, it is certainly waging the battle on 
other fronts as well. ``Microsoft and the freedom to innovate,'' proclaims 
its site on the World Wide Web, perhaps framing the matter a bit one-sidedly, 
and asking, ``What's your opinion?'' And Gates, presenting a public 
image far different from that of the rapacious baron described by 
prosecutors, has been out dispensing grants for libraries and vaccines 
and talking on ``The Rosie O'Donnell Show'' last week about the intricacies 
of potty training for his 2{-year-old daughter, Jennifer Katharine. 
``We're right in the middle of that,'' Gates, the world's richest 
man, whose wife is pregnant with the couple's second child (referred 
to by some employees here as ``Gates Version 2.0''), told Ms. O'Donnell. 
``She watches `Once Upon a Potty.' It's her favorite video, and `Everybody 
Poops' is her favorite book. She's getting the concepts down but she's 
not quite there yet.'' Even as Gates has been vilified in some circles, 
he clearly remains revered on the company campus. Some people seem 
more incensed by the personal attacks on Gates than by the criticism 
of the company. ``I didn't know John D. Rockefeller,'' said Kevin 
Eagan, a director of business development in the hardware group, referring 
to the mogul whose dominance over oil markets at the turn of this 
century has invited endless comparisons to Gates' control over computer 
software. ``But I do know Bill Gates, and in 30 or 40 years when I 
tell my kids what it was like to work for Bill Gates, I'll tell them 
this was a normal guy who really was incredibly passionate about technology.'' 
Jonathan Sposato, 31, a lead program manager who has been designing 
computer games since he was 13, said: ``I don't get the feeling he 
wants to control everything or anything like that. He cares very much 
about certain problems and issues in technology, and he wants to come 
up with solutions. That's what really drives him.'' And many other 
employees described Gates as an accessible leader who welcomes e-mail 
and motivates with notes of his own. ``It was just great to know he 
tried the game,'' said Jose Pinero, a product manager, describing 
Gates' e-mail concerning Monster Truck Madness. ``He cares about what 
you're doing.'' Whatever the dangers posed by the antitrust case, 
company officials say it has had no effect on their ability to recruit 
workers. Stafford Mays, a senior diversity specialist who travels 
around the country in recruiting efforts, including assembling a force 
of 700 summer interns, says the matter is ``totally irrelevant'' as 
far as young applicants are concerned. ``It just doesn't come up,'' 
Mays said. ``They all want to know if they can work on the next version 
of Windows.'' They also ask numerous questions about what Gates is 
really like, said Mays, though that is a curiosity that clearly extends 
far beyond the circle of prospective employees. ``When I tell people 
I work for Microsoft,'' said Edie Adams, hardware usability and ergonomics 
manager, ``they always want to know: `Have you ever met Bill Gates? 
Have you ever been to Bill Gates' house?''' (Virtually every employee 
meets Gates; invitations to his mansion overlooking Lake Washington 
are a rarer privilege.) Many people who work here expressed confidence 
that the company would win the antitrust case, and several pointed 
to America Online's planned $4.2 billion takeover of Netscape Communications 
Corp., a deal they say will create a mega-competitor and render the 
question of a Microsoft monopoly moot. More broadly, though, they 
insist that the company will continue to face fierce competition on 
all fronts. ``People say they can't imagine anything other than Windows,'' 
the operating system that drives nearly nine out of every 10 personal 
computers, said Erik Strommen, a designer of children's products for 
the company. ``Well, just blink. That's the way things happen.'' Some 
employees expressed the fear that Microsoft could win the legal battle 
but lose the competitive war, its ability to set the technological 
pace sapped by the fight in the courtroom. Others, though, insist 
they cannot imagine that happening. ``I don't have to be personally 
involved'' in the courtroom battle, said Thompson, the hardware group 
vice president. ``I'm able to keep working on great products every 
day without distraction.'' Still, he added: ``It bugs me that the 
perception is out there that Microsoft is not an innovative company. 
I think we're an unbelievably innovative company.''
