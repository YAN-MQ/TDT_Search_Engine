A family in Queens got an early-morning visit Thursday, but it wasn't 
Santa Claus who was sneaking into their house. Instead, it was two 
men who walked into the family's home on 146th Street shortly after 
6 a.m., loaded up a laundry cart with Christmas presents from the 
living room, then calmly walked out with the loot, police said. The 
two men took the gifts to the house of one of the men a block and 
a half away on 147th Street, authorities said. But as any aspiring 
Santa probably knows, people bearing gifts in the snow can often leave 
behind telltale tracks, and in this case, police said, the tracks 
led straight to the house of Timothy Jackman, 22. When police arrived 
at the house, they said, they found Jackman and Hakim Jones, 21, also 
of Queens, on Jackman's bed, sifting through Barbie dolls, video games, 
stereo equipment and jewelry that bore a striking resemblance to the 
gifts missing from their neighbor's home. One of the officers who 
confronted the men, Vincent Papasodero, 26, said that the case against 
the men began to look even better when the officers spotted a framed 
picture of the woman whose home had just been burglarized, Miroslava 
Alexander, 42. The suspects did little to hide their crime, said Papasodero, 
who investigated the thefts with his partner, Officer John Lynagh, 
31. ``The cart they used to steal the stuff was also stolen from the 
house, and it left tracks that went right up to the house, where we 
found the suspects,'' Papasodero said. ``Then when we were let in 
the house, we found them lying on the bed, going though the proceeds.'' 
``They said the stuff was theirs until we asked about the photo of 
the complainant,'' he said. ``Then they stopped talking.'' Papasodero 
said that the men had entered the victims' home through a rear door, 
though it did not appear to have been forced open. He added that Ms. 
Alexander, who had recently moved into the neighborhood, called police 
after hearing a strange noise in her living room. ``She was certainly 
relieved to see her stuff again,'' he said, noting that Ms. Alexander 
had bought the gifts for her three young children. The officer said 
that he felt lucky that the investigation involved ``particularly 
dumb criminals.'' Jackman and Jones were charged with burglary and 
criminal possession of stolen property, police said. The police returned 
the gifts to the family.
