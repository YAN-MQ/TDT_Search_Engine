Years before Oprah, Rosie and Leeza, there was Virginia Graham. The 
pioneer of TV talk shows died of complications from a heart attack 
in New York last night at age 86. Graham started her career in radio 
in the 1930s, and later hosted "girl talk" and "the Virginia Graham 
show" on television. She also appeared on stage and wrote several 
books. Graham also helped found the cerebral palsy foundation in 1947.
