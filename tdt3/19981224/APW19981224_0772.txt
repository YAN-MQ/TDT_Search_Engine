Three balloonists streaked across the Pacific Ocean on a jetstream 
Thursday, hoping to elude a troublesome weather pattern that could 
threaten their bid to achieve the first non-stop trip around the world 
in a balloon. British tycoon Richard Branson, American millionaire 
Steve Fossett and Per Lindstrand of Sweden were moving at 145 mph 
(233 kph), 1,500 miles (2,400 km) east of Japan, when they soared 
past the halfway mark on an eastward circuit of the globe that began 
in Marrakech, Morocco on Dec. 18. ``They are pleased with their progress, 
but there is still a worry about the weather in the Pacific,'' said 
ground crew spokeswoman Jackie McQuillan. ``We are watching it very 
carefully, but we are feeling slightly more confident about things 
than we were this morning,'' she said. The Pacific crossing is dangerous, 
ground crew director Mike Kendrick said, because the frequency of 
shipping is not very high and rescue would be difficult. The ground 
crew were tracking the position of all ships that would be under the 
balloon in the Pacific. Later Thursday, spokesman David Partridge 
said that the balloon was maintaining its height and speed and was 
moving northwards, skirting the depression which meteorologists were 
warning could suck the balloon down and even force it to reverse direction. 
''We are trying to position the balloon to go as quickly as possible 
and outrun the developing weather system,'' Partridge said. The three-man
