An appeals court has reduced the jail sentence of a former Tehran 
mayor convicted of corruption from five years to two years, a judiciary 
statement said Thursday. The court also reduced to 10 years from 20 
years the period Gholamhossein Karbaschi was banned from assuming 
public office. It replaced his sentence of 60 lashes with a fine of 
dlrs 3,000, statement said. This would be in addition to the original 
fines he was ordered to pay: dlrs 330,000 as punishment and dlrs 200,000 
that he must pay back the city. Karbaschi, a key ally of moderate 
President Mohammad Khatami, had been a target of hard-line political 
rivals, and many Iranians saw the trial as a political settling of 
scores. The judiciary in Iran is controlled by hard-liners. Karbaschi 
was found guilty in July of embezzlement during his eight years as 
Tehran's mayor. He filed an appeal in August. It was not immediately 
clear when Karbaschi, who has been out on bail, will begin serving 
his sentence. Karbaschi's lawyer Bahman Keshavarz later said his client 
will protest the decision by the appeals court. ``I do not accept 
the ruling issued by the appeals court,'' said Keshavarz.
