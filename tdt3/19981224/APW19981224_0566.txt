NEW YORK (AP) _ U.S. National Basketball Association commissioner 
David Stern and union director Billy Hunter held a secret meeting 
in Los Angeles Wednesday night, a few hours after the league said 
a settlement must be reached by Jan. 7 to save the season. An NBA 
spokesman confirmed the meeting, which was the first between the men 
since Dec. 11. It took place at the office of agent Leonard Armato, 
who in the past has tried to act as a peacemaker between Stern and 
Hunter. There was no immediate word whether any progress was made. 
Armato, who flew to New York earlier this month and brokered a meeting 
between Stern and Hunter, did not return several phone messages.
