For all the frenzy that can surround the holiday season, it's easy 
to forget those who can't do much celebrating. And that's why post 
offices are filled with letters to Santa every year asking for help. 
We have a story for some of those people sending those letters and 
asking for prayers. He's been pretty busy, again. Toys and games for 
most. But sometimes, even Santa is surprised by what children ask 
for. Not a bag full of presents, but a wish list of needs. Meg Goodman 
has read a lot of Santa's letters. Dear Santa, I wish I could buy 
my mother her headstone, she's been deceased for many years now. If 
I could get some help, I'd appreciate it. Another young lady just 
wants us to find a house for her and her mom. Needy children in Chicago 
have sent more than 600 letters to goodmans' "Santa's kids" organization 
this year. While many ask for toys, about 30% are more basic, food, 
clothing, presents for others. At the city's main post office, at 
least 7,000 letters to Santa have arrived. Here too, the spirit of 
giving is alive as strangers answer the childrens' requests. I picked 
up a letter and it got to me. It just makes you feel really good. 
With bigger than life trees and oversized presents to match, many 
complain we have lost sight of the true meaning of Christmas. But 
after reading these letters from needy children, you can't forget. 
"I never get a chance to get my mom a gift," says a 10 year old. While 
the son of a deaf mother writes, "all I want is my mommy to hear." 
Hi kyeasha. 7-year-old kyeasha Franklin didn't want anything for herself, 
just something for granny. What do you want Santa claus to get for 
her? Coat and boots. why? So she can be warm. I really just don't 
know what to say now. She is something else, marvelous, a sweet little 
girl. Across the country, most Santa writers will get a present for 
christmas, filled by the generosity of others, who want the magic 
of christmas, to continue. Thank you for everything. Roger O'Neil,
