It is the day before Christmas and Christmas Eve shoppers were out 
in force across America. These residents in Wichita, Kansas explained 
their last minute shopping trips. It is too many things to do. I have 
11 month-old twins, and I do not get out very often and my husband 
is home today. I have to wait until my last payday on the 18th. I 
am counting on everybody else to be done. I am doing my last minute 
shopping for myself.
