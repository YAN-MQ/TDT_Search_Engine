Recessions are chilling Japan and much of the developing world, but 
it's springtime in Europe for Toyota Motor Corp. Toyota has invested 
heavily here in this decade, and its planning is about to pay off. 
When European Union quotas on Japanese imports end in 12 months, Toyota 
will be ready with new models, expanded factories, more dealers and 
its high-margin Lexus luxury brand. Globally, Toyota is No. 3, after 
General Motors Corp. and Ford Motor Co. Its weakest region has been 
Western Europe, where it had less than 3 percent of the market in 
1997. But this year it passed Nissan to become the biggest Japanese 
auto company in Europe, and by 2005 it plans to nearly double European 
sales to 800,000 units. That will make it bigger in Europe than Citroen 
and nearly as large as the BMW Group, including Rover. This year, 
Toyota started construction of a second European factory, near Valenciennes, 
France. Starting in 2001, Toyota will build 100,000 units of a new 
small car, the Yaris, there. The Yaris will compete head-on in France 
with other ``city cars'' like the Renault Clio, Peugeot 106 and Citroen 
Saxo. A step up, in the popular European segment where cars like the 
Volkswagen Golf and Ford Focus compete, Toyota is selling more Corollas. 
In September, Toyota started building Corollas on a second assembly 
line at its factory in Derby, England. Last year, Toyota made 115,000 
cars in Britain; in 2001, it will be capable of building 220,000. 
Other projects support the added assembly capacity. In September, 
Toyota began expanding its Welsh engine plant, where capacity will 
rise to 400,000 units in 2001, from 100,000 today. Toyota developed 
the Yaris at its European design center in Brussels; in July, it said 
it would move to a new design center, on the Cote d'Azur of France, 
in 2000. This year, the company established Toyota Motor Europe Manufacturing 
in Brussels to coordinate purchasing and logistics for the French 
and British plants. The employees are moving into a building there 
used as the corporate headquarters for Toyota Motor Manufacturing 
and Engineering, which is familiarly known as Toyota Motor Europe. 
In October, Toyota opened Le Rendez-Vous, a $5.4 million showroom 
on the Champs Elysees in Paris where browsers can receive information 
about Toyotas but not actually buy a car. ``We will get direct information 
from customers'' at the showroom, Tatsuo Takahashi, president and 
chief executive of Toyota Motor Europe, said in a recent interview. 
``And it has some kind of symbolic meaning. Toyota is on the Main 
Street of Europe.'' Another symbol was the recent quiet announcement 
that the company would start offering the Toyota Century, a V12-powered 
limousine that rivals Rolls-Royce, outside Japan. Toyota said that 
only 10 to 20 of the cars would be sold in Europe annually, but the 
Century will put the company in the premium luxury class where BMW, 
DaimlerChrysler and Volkswagen all plan to expand. The Lexus brand 
will bring higher volumes of luxury cars. Last year, Toyota dealers 
with Lexus franchises sold 8,200 of the LS 400 and GS 300 models. 
Next year, when a third model _ the IS 200 _ will be available, Lexus 
will become a second distinct brand in Europe, with separate showrooms 
as it has in the United States. ``Next year, we'll sell 10,000 in 
Europe,'' said Juan Jose Diaz Ruiz, executive vice president of Toyota 
Motor Europe and its highest ranking non-Japanese executive on the 
Continent. ``Long term, we'll sell 25,000 a year.'' The IS 200 was 
designed to compete against the BMW 3-Series, the Mercedes-Benz C-Class 
and the Audi A4. Toyota says it has not decided whether it will sell 
the car in North America. The IS 200 is the key for Lexus, Diaz Ruiz 
said. ``We will be able to enhance the range, build an exclusive dealer 
organization, and build awareness and interest in the Lexus brand,'' 
he said. ``Our goal for 2005 is 800,000 sales, of which 50,000 are 
Lexus.'' Other Japanese carmakers are also assaulting the European 
market. For example, Honda will introduce four new models next year. 
In France, it plans to add 45 dealers by 2000, for a total of 180, 
and increase sales in that period by 36 percent, to 17,000. Mitsubishi 
expects its European sales to grow 18 percent by 2000, to 330,000, 
and Nissan will introduce 16 cars here in the next four years. The 
limits on Japanese car sales are to end as the year 2000 starts. Japanese 
auto imports were once restricted by the governments of Britain, France, 
Italy, Portugal and Spain. In 1993, European Union politics resulted 
in a Europe-wide ``gentleman's agreement'' with the Japanese that 
limits their imports into Europe in total, and into those five countries 
specifically. In 1998, for example, the quota in Europe is 1,167,000 
imported Japanese vehicles; the limit in France is 111,100. The total 
European market is about 15.2 million units. The Japanese responded 
to the quotas by building assembly plants in Europe, learning the 
markets, setting up design studios and engineering centers, and generally 
preparing for 2000. No Japanese maker has been more thorough in its 
planning than Toyota, which has increased employment at its Brussels 
headquarters to 760, from 140 in 1990. ``Toyota's way is to make an 
effort and step-by-step grow,'' Takahashi said. ``Toyota has about 
3 percent of Europe's market. Our goal is achieving 4 percent of the 
market. The next goal is 5 percent. For imported cars, that is a big 
market share.'' Toyota had 2.8 percent of the European market in 1997, 
7.8 percent of North America and 29.6 percent of Japan. It will be 
impossible to get 10 percent in Europe, Diaz Ruiz said, because there 
are many European makers with home markets to rely on. Despite the 
end of quotas, European makers like Fiat, Volkswagen and Renault ``will 
continue to be heavily supported by the culture of Europe,'' Diaz 
Ruiz said. ``About 30 percent of the market is captive.'' But Diaz 
Ruiz did note that Toyota was the market leader in Ireland and Greece, 
two countries with no local automakers and no history of restrictions 
on Japanese imports. Toyota has the money to finance its ambitions, 
in Europe and elsewhere. This year, it opened its third plant in the 
United States, in Princeton, Ind., and its second in Brazil. Besides 
the plant in France, it has one under construction in India.
