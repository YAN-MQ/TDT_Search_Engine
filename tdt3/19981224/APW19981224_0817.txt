Telecom Italian has struck a deal to sell 80 percent of its pay TV 
unit to Rupert Murdoch's media empire and France's TF1, Italy's ANSA 
news agency reported Thursday. The accord has been long anticipated 
and much debated in Italy, where some in government and media have 
argued against foreign ownership of the pay TV industry. Murdoch is 
interested in the lucrative soccer broadcast rights in Italy. Italian 
investors have been scared off by the high investments the operation 
would need in coming years. Telecom owns 100 percent of the pay television 
unit, Stream. It would retain an ``important role'' under the accord, 
including technical distribution, ANSA said. Lawyers still have to 
work out exact wording of the deal, ANSA said. The majority shareholder 
would be NewsEurope Corp., the Italian branch of Murdoch's media holdings, 
ANSA said. Murdoch's News Corp. owns the Twentieth Century Fox studio, 
Fox network, the Los Angeles Dodgers, New York Post, the HarperCollins 
book publisher and newspapers in Britain and Australia.
