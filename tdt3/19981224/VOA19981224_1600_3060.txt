The Ford Motor Company confirms it has sold its nine percent interest 
in the Kia Motors Company of South Korea. Ford will not say to whom 
the interest was sold, but there are reports the buyer is the J.P. 
Morgan Investment Bank, which paid $11 million. It was a big loss 
for Ford, which had paid about $150 million for its stake in Kia.
