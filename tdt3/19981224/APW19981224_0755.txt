Israel denounced Russian Communist Party leader Gennady Zyuganov Thursday 
for making ``anti-Semitic declarations'' and expressed hope that Russian 
authorities would find appropriate ways to deal with his slurs. Zyuganov, 
who finished second in the 1996 presidential election, blamed Jews 
in the Russian government for helping to cause ``the current catastrophic 
condition of the country, the mass impoverishment and the process 
of extinction of its people.'' Zyuganov's remarks Wednesday were in 
response to calls on him to denounce recent anti-Semitic comments 
by others in the party. Israel's Foreign Ministry said Zyuganov's 
statement were not consistent with his claims that the Communist Party 
``aims to build a democratic society in Russia.'' ``Israel severely 
condemns and expresses shock from these anti-Semitic declarations 
that do not contribute to relations between the Russian and Jewish 
peoples and the state of Israel,'' the ministry said in a statement. 
``Israel expresses hope that the Russian powers will find appropriate 
ways to deal with this grave incident,'' it said. Under Zyuganov, 
the Communist party has taken on an increasingly aggressive, nationalistic 
tone. Anti-Semitic rhetoric has grown in Russia since its economic 
troubles have deepened over the last several months.
