The final holiday shopping rush is under way, as procrastinators hit 
the malls for those last minute presents. Patty Davis has an update. 
While bitter winds chill shoppers on state street in Chicago, the 
plunging temperatures couldn't be better news for midwest retailer 
Carson pirie Scott. We are seeing very brisk traffic because of that. 
a warm November and early December kept shoppers out of many stores 
and malls in much of the country. In addition, some analysts say economic 
and political uncertainty could be making consumers think before they 
spend. But some say the slow start may not mean a disappointing Christmas 
after all. Consumers have learned to anticipate what retailers are 
gonna do. So they know if they wait later in the season, they'll get 
better sales and better bargains. Bargains abound at Carson's, one 
of many stores aggressively marking down prices. I found that before 
Christmas, a couple days before Christmas, it's always cheaper. According 
to the international council of shopping centers, sales of apparel 
are now picking up. Home furnishing sales are strong. Jewelry sales 
are on the rise. Also, discounters such as Wal-Mart and Kmart are 
having a good year. And an extra day in the shopping season could 
make a difference. All told, analysts see a 3% to 5% increase in sales 
this year, down from earlier estimates. Retailers are keeping their 
fingers crossed, hoping that shoppers turn out in force in the few 
remaining days before Christmas, traditionally the biggest shopping 
days of the year. Patty Davis, CNN, Chicago.
