In the world of cars, 1998 started as the Age of Aquarius, Part II, 
thanks to the frenzy surrounding the rebirth of the Volkswagen Beetle. 
But it ended as the Year of the Truck, with light trucks outselling 
cars in the United States for the first time, in November. Trucks 
were everywhere. General Motors brought out all-new full-size pickups, 
its best-selling vehicles. Chrysler put four doors on its extended-cab 
Dodge Ram pickups, and Ford went one better, offering four-door versions 
of all its haulers. Ford's big Super Duty pickups, descendants of 
the big work trucks one used to see mainly on farms, building sites 
and the like, started showing up in the driveways of manicured suburbs. 
And after falling short on its first try, Toyota prepared to launch 
another strike on Detroit's best-defended fortress: big, brawny pickups. 
Another booming subset of the truck market, fancy sport utilities 
_ call them ``status utility vehicles'' _ went from very hot to a 
full boil. Toyota and Lexus redesigned their big models. GM brought 
out luxury models, including the first truck ever from Cadillac. Chrysler 
redid its Jeep Grand Cherokee, and other companies _ from BMW to Porsche 
to Volkswagen _ made plans to jump on the off-road bandwagon. But 
in the end, the most significant vehicle of the year may turn out 
to be the Lexus RX 300, which offers the attributes of both cars and 
sport utilities. A huge sales success, it is sure to be widely copied. 
In such a truck-centered year, there was plenty of car news, too. 
Daimler merged with Chrysler, making the $11,000 Neon a stepsister 
of the $130,000 Mercedes S-Class. Mazda, Mitsubishi and Nissan struggled; 
Hyundai bought Kia, and Daewoo, another South Korean car maker, pinned 
its hopes on college students' selling cars on campus. Volkswagen 
and BMW battled for Rolls-Royce in a bidding war that BMW seemed to 
lose, but ultimately won _ getting rights to the Rolls name for a 
fraction of what VW paid for the rest of the company. Business aside, 
how were the cars and trucks of '98? Two contributors to this page 
thumbed back through their notebooks, got out their red pencils and 
graded some of the vehicles they drove this year. Criteria were simple: 
How well did each fulfill its potential? And more basically, at a 
time when many new cars are good but bland, which ones really stood 
out? As in school, the teachers have their pets. At least there are 
no failing grades, and the year will not have to be repeated.
