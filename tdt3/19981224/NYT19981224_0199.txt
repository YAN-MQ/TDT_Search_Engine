Savings bonds have long represented a triumph of convenience over 
sophistication. Available in denominations as small as $50, they are 
ideal as gifts. But when it comes to returns, the 30 year savings 
bonds have usually yielded less than comparable Treasury securities, 
because the rates are pegged at about 90 percent of a five-year Treasury 
bond. Now, however, investors may want to take a look at a new type 
of savings bond, the so-called inflation-indexed variety. These seem 
to be remarkably good deals at the moment, especially for investors 
who want to stave off paying taxes on their investments. ``I have 
clients who would find this very attractive for money that they don't 
need now but may need in the future,'' said Rosilyn Overton, a financial 
planner in Flushing, N.Y. The securities, known as ``I bonds,'' were 
introduced by the Treasury in September. The goal was to bolster sales 
of savings bonds, which have been flat, as well as to offer smaller 
investors a bond as resistant to the effects of inflation as the inflation-indexed 
Treasury bonds introduced in 1997. The I bonds are bought at face 
value in six denominations, from $50 to $5,000, with the guarantee 
that their returns, which are paid when the bonds are redeemed, will 
be protected from inflation for up to 30 years. Rates are adjusted 
for inflation twice a year _ in early May and November. The current 
yield is 5.05 percent. That is the sum of the bond's 3.3 percent fixed 
rate of return and the inflation-adjustment rate of 1.75 percent, 
which is based on the Consumer Price Index from April through September. 
That means the bonds are not only already yielding more than traditional 
Series EE savings bonds, whose current yield is 4.60 percent, but 
even more than conventional 30-year Treasury bonds, now at 5.0 percent. 
How does the I bond stack up against the inflation-indexed Treasury 
bond? The comparison gets tricky, because the Treasury bond is adjusted 
differently. Its coupon is fixed, at 3.625 percent for the 30-year 
variety; the principal is adjusted upward with the price index to 
provide an inflation-adjusted yield. That carries immediate tax implications. 
Investors owe capital gains taxes each year on the increased principal, 
in addition to income tax on the payout. By contrast, holders of I 
bonds, like those of other savings bonds, do not owe tax until their 
bonds mature or are cashed in. (Holders of plain-vanilla Treasury 
bonds pay tax on their income.) Some investors may be able to skirt 
some or all of the taxes on I bonds by applying the earnings toward 
a child's college costs, although the tax break applies only to single 
filers with adjusted gross incomes of less than $67,250 or joint filers 
with less than $108,350. As for convenience, I bonds can be bought 
at most banks and financial institutions, or through some employers' 
payroll savings programs. Buying Treasury securities means going through 
the more tedious Treasury Direct program _ by mail or in person _ 
or through a broker, who will charge a commission. Moreover, Treasuries 
start at $1,000, so they are expensive stocking stuffers. Still, I 
bonds may not be right for every investor's sock. The biggest drawback 
is the possibility that falling inflation will eat into the inflation-linked 
earnings rate. In the event of deflation, the I bond's fixed rate 
may actually be negated _ which means returns can fall to zero. (The 
bond's principal, however, would not be touched.) There are restrictions, 
too. Purchases are limited to $30,000 a year. And investors who cash 
in the bonds within the first five years forfeit three months of earnings.
