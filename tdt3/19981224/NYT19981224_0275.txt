For years, Scott M. Black, president of Delphi Management, a Boston 
money management firm with $915 million in assets, has preached the 
merits of deep value investing. With his thick Down East accent, Black, 
a native of Portland, Maine, was always ready to pull out a passel 
of research showing how small-capitalization value stocks outperform 
other equities. Encountering a sizzling record like Black's, people 
listened. Since he started Delphi in January 1980, Black has returned 
17.6 percent, annualized, to investors, net of fees, through June 
30. That compares to just 14.4 percent for the Russell 2000 index 
of small-cap stocks, according to Ibbotson Associates, a research 
firm in Chicago. Black's minimum investment, $5 million, deterred 
many. But now, for the first time, retail investors are able to invest 
with Black, through the Kobren Delphi Value fund, a new no-load fund 
with a $2,500 minimum that is being marketed by Kobren Insight Group, 
a money manager in Wellesley Hills, Mass. Why the 19-year wait to 
start a mutual fund? ``When we looked at the economics, we didn't 
want to compete with the likes of Fidelity,'' he said, adding that 
pressure from investors finally got the better of him. ``We keep getting 
calls from people who want to invest with us, and I had to turn them 
away. Here's a way for us to capture that money.'' Need anyone fret 
that his style will be diluted in the mutual fund format? No, he said. 
``I don't get tempted to stray,'' Black said. ``What we do isn't glamorous, 
but it works consistently over time.'' Black, 52, is also known in 
the art world for buying Impressionist art at what many consider bargain 
prices. He bought ``Deux Femmes Fait le Lit,'' a Toulouse-Lautrec 
oil of two prostitutes making a bed, at Christie's in November. A 
deal? ``Oh, yes,'' he said. ``It was well under $1 million. If you 
like the subject, it's a fantastic Toulouse-Lautrec. It's been exhibited 
everywhere.'' He brings a similar eye for quality to his deep value 
investing style. In looking at companies, Black watches for growing 
earnings and revenues, for example, along with returns on equity of 
15 percent or more. Often, that means passing up restructuring plays. 
``We don't like cost reductions, which only work short-term,'' he 
said, adding that he likes to keep turnover in his portfolio to below 
50 percent a year. He also favors cash-generating companies with solid 
balance sheets. Cash exceeds debt in 40 percent of the companies he 
owns. For banks and insurers and what he calls other ``mundane businesses,'' 
he pays no more than half the normal market multiple of price to earnings, 
and he sells a stock as the ratio reaches those of its peers. For 
asset-rich companies, like oil concerns, he buys at a discount to, 
say, proven reserves. For media companies, he uses his estimate of 
their takeover value. In both cases, he sells as the discount disappears. 
With an overall P/E ratio of just 14, based on anticipated 1999 earnings, 
the stocks in Delphi Management's accounts have some of the lowest 
valuations in the small-cap universe. ``We're absolute value players, 
not relative value,'' he said. Yet, unlike many value managers, he 
does not shrug off technology companies. ``At times we'll own tech, 
but they have to be down and out, selling at close to book value with 
a prospect of rebound for their earnings,'' he said. Often, that means 
drawing a bead on a beaten-down target and waiting for an improvement 
in the earnings outlook. Black is now watching Silicon Valley Group, 
a semiconductor equipment maker, which closed at $10.75 a share on 
Thursday, down from its 52-week high of $27.875 because of the cyclical 
nature of the business as well as slack demand in Asia. Its book value 
is $17, but he is not yet ready to buy. ``There's more bloodletting 
to come, because the earnings power hasn't come back on,'' he said. 
Black has been adding to his holdings in Grey Advertising, which he 
started buying in 1982 at less than $5 a share. Grey now sells for 
$348.50 a share, less than 13 times Black's 1999 earnings estimate 
of $27 to $28 a share. That compares with P/E multiples of more than 
29 for two rivals, Interpublic and Omnicom. Grey has yet to recover 
from the August selloff, is illiquid and not closely tracked on Wall 
Street. He likes the pricing flexibility of advertising companies. 
``It's what Warren Buffett used to refer to as a `royalty rent franchise,' 
'' he said. ``There's not another business in the U.S. that can mark 
up its prices 5 percent every Jan. 1.'' Black thinks Grey's return 
on equity will be 18 percent going forward. At the end of 1997, Black 
began buying shares of Claire's Stores, a retailer of costume jewelry, 
at $14 a share; it now trades at $18.875. ``It's a legitimate 15 percent 
grower with more than $120 million of cash on its balance sheet and 
no debt,'' he said. The company has annual sales of $300 a square 
foot in its stores, a figure he calls ``amazing'' compared with the 
norm of $150 to $225 at rival stores. For 1999, he expects the retailer 
to have a return on equity of 25 percent and earnings of $1.60 to 
$1.65 a share, giving Claire Stores a P/E of under 12. He is also 
finding wealth in oil-related stocks. ``I'm bottom-fishing the energy 
stocks because they've been blown out _ energy prices are so low,'' 
Black said. One favorite is Cabot Oil and Gas of Houston, a natural-gas 
producer whose output is growing 10 to 12 percent annually. ``I like 
to buy growth, not just assets in the ground,'' Black said. He started 
buying shares last October at $13 to $14. The stock closed at $15 
on Thursday, just five times the low-end of his expectations of per-share 
cash flow next year. Black puts the company's breakup value at $22 
a share, so it sells for a 32 percent discount; many rivals command 
premiums.
