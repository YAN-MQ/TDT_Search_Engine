The Afghan Talabon faction has denied a Pakistani newspaper report 
the Saoudi militant, Osamo Duladin is setting up a new terrorist training 
camp in Afghanistan. Meanwhile, Osamo Duladin has denied involvement 
in the bombing last August of two American embassies in Africa. This 
is the first time Mr. Duladin has commented on U.S. allegations he 
masterminded the attacks. Sarah Horner has the details from Islamabad. 
The Pakistan-based Afghan-Islamic press reports Osamo Duladin says 
he was not involved in the bomb blast which killed 224 people in Kenya 
and Tanzania. Batti is quoted as saying he does not regret what happened 
there. He says African may be responsible for the attacks. The U.S. 
government has indicted Mr. Duladin and is offering a $5 million reward 
for information leading to his capture. Shortly after the bombing, 
the United States fired dozens and cruise missiles into Afghanistan. 
Targeting suspected camps where Washington said Mr. Duladin was training 
terrorists. Talabon authorities have refused American extradition 
requests for Mr. Duladin because they say he is their guest and in 
keeping with Afghan tradition, they will protect him. Sarah Horner 
for VOA News, Islamabad.
