Former UN weapons inspector, Scott Ridder, says he thinks the U.S. 
led bombing of Iraq did little to rid Iraq of bad weapons. In an interview 
with the VOA, Mr. Ridder says last week's U.S. and British air strikes 
are seen as a provocative act, that actually increased world sympathy 
for Iraq. As a result, Mr. Ridder says he expects the UN arms inspection 
program to be changed in ways that will actually help Iraq keep hiding 
bad weapons. Mr. Ridder told VOA Iraq is very good at moving bad weapons 
quickly. He says most targets hit by U.S. forces last week probably 
contained nothing of strategic value.
