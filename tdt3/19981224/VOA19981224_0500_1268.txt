The University of Arizona wants to keep its successful football program 
on a roll. And has assigned head coach, Dick Tomy, to a five year 
extension that will keep him on the sidelines through the year 2004. 
Tomy is the winningest coach in Arizona school history with an overall 
record of 54, 39 and 4. The Wildcats completed an 11 to 1 romp this 
season. The best since Arizona's football program began in 1899. Arizona 
will go for its 12th victory in the Holiday Bowl in San Diego on December 
30 when the team faces Nebraska. Tomy has already paced the sidelines 
in Arizona for 12 seasons, the longest tenure of any active coach 
in the Pac 10 conference.
