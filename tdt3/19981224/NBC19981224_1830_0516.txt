And now the latest on those balloonists trying to fly nonstop around 
the world. Today Richard Branson and his crewmates crossed the half 
way point, over 8,000 miles so far, high above the pacific ocean. 
They're heading toward America's west coast. And they hope to beat 
some nasty weather and fly over the pacific northwest tomorrow and 
celebrate Christmas at 31,000 feet with some Turkey stew.
