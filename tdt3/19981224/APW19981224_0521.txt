One of three men caught tunneling to a bank vault managed to escape 
police by fleeing into crowds of Christmas Eve shoppers in this Normandy 
town Thursday. The trio in their mid-20s was digging a tunnel to the 
vault of a Societe Generale in downtown Caen overnight Tuesday when 
police caught them in the act, managing to arrest two of them. The 
other fled into the night. On Thursday morning, police had driven 
the two handcuffed suspects from jail to the courthouse downtown when 
one of them broke away from two escorting officers and ran, officials 
said on customary anonymity. With his hands cuffed behind his back, 
the suspect managed to evade officers after a short pursuit, blending 
into crowds of Christmas shoppers in the commercial district, authorities 
said. Officials declined to identify the suspects but said the two 
were locals with past police records.
