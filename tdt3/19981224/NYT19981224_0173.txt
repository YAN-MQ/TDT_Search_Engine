For all the technological expertise behind the 2-ton, 15-foot animatronic 
ape (augmented by an actor in a monkey suit) who is the title character 
of ``Mighty Joe Young,'' the beast is still capable of only two facial 
expressions. When riled, Joe roars, bares his teeth, beats his chest 
and acts like a conventional movie monster on the rampage. In a calmer 
mode, embracing his caretaker, Jill Young (Charlize Theron), in his 
giant paws, Joe turns his mouth down in an expression of childlike 
docility. In his heart of hearts, the darling creature is really just 
a hirsute little boy pining for the closest thing he knows to a mommy. 
As long as Jill is around, you can count on him to be a sweetly obedient 
child following the signals of a flashlight she uses to direct him 
like a conductor on a podium. The film, a remake of the 1949 movie 
``Mighty Joe Young,'' starring Terry Moore as Joe's cheesecakey mother 
surrogate, is essentially ``King Kong'' for kids. Very young kids. 
The familiar story begins when Jill is a child growing up in Central 
Africa. One terrible night, both Jill's mother and the mother of the 
baby ape who grows up to be Joe are killed by evil poachers, but not 
before Joe has bitten off two fingers from a hand of one of the villains. 
We flash ahead two decades. Little Jill is now Big Jill, a slinky, 
tomboyish woman who is fiercely protective of her childhood pet, with 
whom she enjoys playing games of hide and seek. Joe's enormous size 
has made him a legend, and poachers and zoo keepers from around the 
world have their eye on him. Arriving just in time to save the ape 
from probable kidnaping is Gregg (Bill Paxton), a kindly American 
zoologist who persuades Jill to let him transport the beast to an 
animal conservancy in Los Angeles. Jill agrees on the condition that 
she remain Joe's caretaker. Recognizing Joe from news articles as 
the ape that cost him his fingers many years earlier, Strasser (Rade 
Sherbedgia), the poacher who killed Joe's mother and who now runs 
his own conservancy in Botswana, descends on Los Angeles, bent on 
capturing Joe. Apes, like elephants, the movie suggests, never forget. 
And when Joe spies his mother's killer, he begins acting up. Not even 
Jill can figure out what's the matter. The movie culminates in Joe's 
going on a mild rampage through the streets of Los Angeles. Compared 
with ``Godzilla'' or ``King Kong,'' it's very tame stuff, and the 
only people who get hurt are the bad guys. That's because Joe is essentially 
an angelic child who identifies with angelic kiddies everywhere. He 
becomes a hero after risking his life to save a saucer-eyed little 
tyke trapped in the top car of a burning ferris wheel. ``Mighty Joe 
Young,'' directed by Ron Underwood from a screenplay by Mark Rosenthal 
and Lawrence Konner, is saddled with dialogue so wooden that Paxton 
and Ms. Theron almost seem animatronic themselves. Little children 
won't notice. In Joe, they can identify with the biggest, cuddliest 
simian toy a 6-year-old could ever hope to own. ``Mighty Joe Young'' 
is rated PG (Parental guidance suggested). Its early scenes of animal 
slaughter could frighten young children. PRODUCTION NOTES: `MIGHTY
