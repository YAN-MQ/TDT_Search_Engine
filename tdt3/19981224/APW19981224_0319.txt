Spain's former interior minister and his deputy left prison Thursday, 
five months after receiving 10-year jail terms for their role in a 
``dirty war'' against Basque separatists. A day after being partially 
pardoned, ex-minister Jose Barrionuevo and his former chief of state 
security Rafael Vera were hailed by dozens of relatives and supporters 
outside the prison. ``We don't feel bitterness, but that does not 
mean we forget what has happened,'' Barrionuevo said in a short statement 
read outside the prison at Guadalajara, 50 kilometers (30 miles) northeast 
of Madrid. His reading was interrupted by chants of ``Innocent!'' 
from the crowd. Barrionuevo and Vera were convicted in July of orchestrating 
the 1983 kidnapping of a Basque businessman who was mistaken for a 
hitman of the armed separatist group ETA. The 1983 abduction was the 
first violation attributed to the Anti-Terrorist Liberation Groups, 
or GAL, that killed 27 people over the next five years in its anti-ETA 
campaign. Many GAL victims were mistaken targets. The conservative 
government of Prime Minister Jose Maria Aznar on Wednesday followed 
a recommendation from the Supreme Court of Justice and granted the 
two former officials a partial pardon that reduced their sentences 
by two-thirds. After the pardon, prison authorities announced a loosening 
of their detention that began with permits to spend Christmas at home. 
The two convicts began serving their 10-year jail terms in September. 
In his statement Barrionuevo thanked his supporters and the Socialist 
party for standing by both him and Vera, and hailed what he called 
the ``generosity and civic courage'' of the Supreme Court for recommending 
the pardon. He also thanked the government for ratifying the court's 
argument in favor of a partial pardon on the grounds that the kidnapping 
took place 15 years ago, and that those convicted had not been seeking 
personal benefit. But Barrionuevo also announced future action aimed 
at achieving more freedom. ``We will fight for the recognition of 
our innocence,'' he said. Revelations about the GAL in the early 1990s 
contributed to the 1996 electoral defeat of Socialist Prime Minister 
Felipe Gonzalez after nearly 14 years in office. Gonzalez has long 
denied that Barrionuevo, Vera, or any of his governments had anything 
to do with the GAL. The partial pardon also affects eight other government 
and security officials also convicted for the 1983 kidnapping, and 
sentenced to between two and ten years in jail. ETA has killed nearly 
800 people in a 30-year-old drive for an independent state in the 
Basque country of northern Spain. It has been observing a unilateral 
cease-fire since Sept. 18, and there are moves afoot for negotiations 
to resolve the conflict.
