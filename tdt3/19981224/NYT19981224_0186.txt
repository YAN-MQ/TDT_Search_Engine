Like Frankenstein, ``The Faculty'' plunders the crypts of cinema for 
its body parts: Here are the paranoia and parasitism of ``Invasion 
of the Body Snatchers.'' There are the slimy, sharp-toothed creatures 
of ``Alien.'' Over there are the movie-wise teen-agers of ``Scream.'' 
The list could be extended, but the point is clear: this mediocre 
sci-fi horror film about an Ohio high school being taken over by thirsty 
space aliens intent on world domination breaks no new ground. But 
it has an engaging cast, with a half-dozen appealing young actors 
playing the roles of teen-agers who are all that stand between the 
Midwestern monsters and the end of the world as certain moviegoers 
know it. In one of the film's wittier passages, the six high schoolers 
puzzling out the mysteries of a small new creature found on a football 
field, a teacher's corpse in a closet and a sudden outbreak of docility 
among their normally brutish and dysfunctional schoolmates speculate 
that paranoid movies of the past may have been part of a plot to soften 
up the public for the real invasion of the body snatchers. By contrast, 
``The Faculty,'' directed by Robert Rodriguez, whose credits include 
``El Mariachi'' and ``Desperado,'' and written by the ubiquitous Kevin 
Williams of the ``Scream'' movies and other adolescent adventures, 
opens with a clunky, bloody, cheap-thrills sequence that colors what 
happens afterward with triteness. So the chief pleasures of the film, 
such as they are, remain the actors: Jordana Brewster as Delilah, 
the beauteous, bitchy cheerleader captain and editor in chief of the 
school newspaper; Shawn Hatosky as Stan, her soon-to-be former boyfriend, 
the quarterback and captain of the Herrington High football team who 
is undergoing a pre-midlife crisis and hanging up his pads; Clea DuVall, 
as Stokely, the unhappy loner and science-fiction aficionado whom 
Delilah taunts as a lesbian; Laura Harris as Marybeth, the sweet blond 
Southern belle who is the new girl in school; Josh Hartnett as the 
cool Zeke, who peddles homemade inhalable substances, condoms and 
fake IDs, among other wares, but happens to be a science genius, and 
Elijah Wood as Casey, the decent little victim of the school bullies, 
who turns out just fine. The adults aren't bad, either: Salma Hayek, 
all but hidden behind her tissues as the sniffling school nurse; Bebe 
Neuwirth as the principal; Famke Janssen as a seemingly shy teacher; 
Piper Laurie as a senior faculty member, and Robert Patrick (the indefatigable 
villain of ``Terminator 2'') as the volatile Coach Willis. Herrington 
High is one of those schools that as the principal, Drake, explains 
at the outset has no money for new computers, a class trip to New 
York City or a school musical this year, but can come up with cash 
for all the new football equipment its team needs. The locals, she 
explains, are football people. If ``The Faculty'' is the only movie 
they see this year, maybe they can be fooled into believing that it 
is fresh and frightening. PRODUCTION NOTES: THE FACULTY Directed and
