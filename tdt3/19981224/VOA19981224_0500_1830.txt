Sandy Berger, the National Security Advisor to President Clinton says 
four days of air raids on Iraq by the U.S. and Britain were effective. 
Mr. Berger told Washington's National Press Club they taught Iraqi 
dictator, Saddam Hussein, some important lessons. He is weaker, deterrence 
is stronger, and the Middle East is safer than before the operation. 
Saddam has learned that we have not lost our resolve to block his 
aggressive aims. He has learned that there is no path of sanctions 
relief. That does not pass through compliance with his obligations. 
And he has learned that what cannot be inspected can, in many cases, 
be destroyed. And National Security Advisor Berger says the strategy 
of the United States and its allies will pursue, is to contain Saddam 
Hussein in the short term, by force if necessary, and in the long 
term, work toward a new government in Iraq. And noting Baghdad's insistence 
that United Nations weapons inspectors will not be allowed to return, 
Mr. Berger said that means sanctions on Iraq will not be lifted. The 
United Nations Security Council makes clear that considerations of 
sanctions relief can only come with verified compliance by Iraq of 
its disarmament obligations, than there is an incentive for Saddam 
to cooperate. Indeed, lifting sanctions before there is verifiable 
compliance, would be a sad day for the United Nations. But even as 
national security advisor, Sandy Berger, was speaking in Washington, 
American and Russian diplomats were tussling at the United Nations 
over a Security Council statement on the bombing of Iraq. The Russians 
who drafted the statement included language, "regretting the raids" 
and giving Secretary General Kofi Annan a direct role in disarming 
Iraq. The United States does not like that language and wants the 
Secretary General's role restricted to diplomatic and humanitarian 
issues alone. The Security Council picks up its debate on this same 
issue next week.
