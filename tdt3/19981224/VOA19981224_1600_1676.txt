Well, here in the United States, a lot of places are going to have 
white Christmases this year, snow and freezing rain have moved from 
the Midwestern United States to the East, disrupting travel for thousands 
of people on Christmas Eve last Thursday. The cold spell that began 
several days ago was blamed for dozens of traffic accidents from Texas 
to Maryland. In California, the chill is blamed for more than $590 
million in damage to the state's citrus crops. Weather related delays 
and cancellations were reported in many airports across the nation 
and hundreds of people were stranded after Greyhound bus lines in 
Tennessee suspended service because of icy roads. I think things will 
clear up by tomorrow. I am sure Erin hopes so because she is going 
to be travelling on Christmas Day. Thank you, Tony.
