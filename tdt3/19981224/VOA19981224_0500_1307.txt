The international ski federation says the women's super giant slalom 
race, wiped out by fog in France, will be held next month in Italy. 
Organizers of the event sent skiers home early for the Christmas break 
on Monday when thick fog continued to blanket the course. The race 
was the first women's world cup race to be postponed this season. 
The competitors will gather again on January 22 in the Italian resort 
of Portino for another try. The super giant slalom will add to a heavy 
schedule at Portino where three other races already scheduled will 
be pushed back by a day to make room.
