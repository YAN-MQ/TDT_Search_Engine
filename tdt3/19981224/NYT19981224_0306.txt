Joseph Esherick, a self-effacing architect who won acclaim for his 
people-friendly designs and turned an old canning factory in San Francisco 
into a renowned shopping complex, died on Dec. 17 at a hospital in 
San Francisco. He was 83 and lived in San Francisco. His firm, Esherick, 
Homsey, Dodge and Davis, said that he died of heart failure after 
several months in a hospital. ``The ideal kind of building is one 
you don't see,'' Esherick liked to say. Accordingly his buildings 
were designed to blend into their surroundings and serve their occupants, 
not shout his name. In 1989 Esherick was awarded the gold medal of 
the American Institute of Architects, making him one of only 47 recipients 
since 1907 and putting him in the company of Frank Lloyd Wright, Le 
Corbusier, Mies van der Rohe and other giants. He was cited as an 
``outstanding designer, an educator steeped in the arts, and a humanist 
with a deep concern for the betterment of the profession and our society.'' 
Characteristically, he seemed taken aback by the honor. ``I was surprised 
that somebody whose achievements have been so modest and simple and 
sort of ordinary was getting recognized,'' he said at the time. Turning 
away a commission once to design a ``signature'' building at Wake 
Forest University in Winston-Salem, N.C., he said: ``I'm not interested 
in doing a signature building, but I would be interested in doing 
a good building to satisfy somebody's problem. My signature isn't 
part of the problem.'' His personal style reinforced the message. 
Tall and laconic and sometimes likened by friends to Gary Cooper, 
he sported a cropped beard and favored khakis and stone-washed denim 
work shirts, often with a colored T-shirt peeping out underneath. 
In his younger years he raced BMWs. Like the man himself, Esherick 
buildings were ``nice,'' said Gerald Gurland, chairman of the Architectural 
Dialogue Committee of the American Institute of Architects, director 
of museum development of the U.S. Holocaust Memorial Museum and a 
former associate of the architect Richard Meier. ``His work was very 
restrained, nice, pleasant, personable,'' Gurland said. ``He was not 
a form-giver. He seemed to have a gift to make buildings pleasant. 
His houses were very natural and fit the California environment.'' 
A faculty member at the University of California at Berkeley for more 
than 40 years, Esherick influenced generations of architecture students, 
teaching that buildings should be designed from the inside out, making 
form secondary to aspects like views and light. ``Beauty,'' he said, 
``is a byproduct of solving problems correctly.'' In addition to the 
Cannery near Fisherman's Wharf, completed in 1967, Esherick designed 
the Monterey Bay Aquarium, which opened in 1984 and incorporated elements 
of the old Cannery Row in Monterey, Calif. His other notable projects 
include Wurster Hall for the College of Environmental Design at the 
University of California at Berkeley, called the first large pre-cast 
concrete structure on the West Coast, and the demonstration homes 
at Sea Ranch, which seem to disappear into the landscape of the Sonoma 
coast south of Mendocino. He also designed Stevenson College at the 
University of California at Santa Cruz and many buildings at Stanford 
University and at Mills College in Oakland. His last project was an 
innovative public elementary school and community center for parents, 
the Tenderloin Community School, now being built in San Francisco. 
Esherick had a fondness for craft and workmanship. When he designed 
a chapel for the YMCA in Berkeley, he included a wooden cross he had 
carved. He was born in 1914 in Philadelphia and apprenticed with his 
uncle, Wharton Esherick, an artist and furniture-maker. He received 
a bachelor of architecture degree from the University of Pennsylvania 
in 1937 and moved to the Bay Area the following year. After serving 
in the Navy in World War II he opened his own firm in 1946. He joined 
the faculty of the UniveRcity of California at Berkeley in 1952 and 
served as chairman of the architecture department from 1977 to 1981. 
He is survived by his wife, Norma; three daughters, Lisa, of Berkeley, 
and Julie and Maria, of San Francisco, and two sons, Joseph W., of 
San Diego, a China scholar and author, and Peter, of Albuquerque, 
N.M. In an interview in The New York Times in 1989 after he won his 
AIA medal, Esherick told of his various hobbies: fly-fishing, bone-carving 
and reading James Joyce and histories of the age of discovery. ``My 
problem is that I like everything,'' he said. ``I get fascinated with 
geology, or I get fascinated with anthropology.'' Then, typically, 
he turned self-effacing. ``I get fascinated with anything I don't 
understand, and since I hardly understand anything, I have a very 
busy life.''
