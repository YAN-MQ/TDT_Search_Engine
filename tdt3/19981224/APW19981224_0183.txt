Prime Minister Yevgeny Primakov urged parliament to swiftly approve 
an austere budget for next year, and threatened Thursday to resign 
along with his Cabinet if the document is rejected. Lawmakers began 
debating the 1999 budget Thursday, and were expected to pass it with 
less commotion than in previous years because of their broad support 
of Primakov's government. Before heading into parliament, Primakov 
met with President Boris Yeltsin in the Kremlin to discuss the budget, 
which is designed to help stabilize Russia's shrinking economy. ``If 
the budget isn't approved, we will not stay on our posts,'' Primakov 
said. ``The budget must be very severe, we can't lie to anyone,'' 
he told Yeltsin, who nodded in agreement. Primakov then told parliament's 
lower house, the State Duma, that a lean budget was essential for 
getting new loans from the International Monetary Fund and other lenders. 
Russia badly needs the aid to help pay off its huge debts. ``Quickly 
passing the budget will strengthen our stance in the talks with international 
financial organizations,'' Primakov said. Despite their support for 
Primakov, some lawmakers criticized the budget as being too dependent 
on foreign help. Finance Minister Mikhail Zadornov acknowledged that 
the budget relies on dlrs 7.2 billion in foreign loans that may not 
come. Also, the budget earmarks only dlrs 9.5 billion to pay off Russia's 
foreign debt, which will total dlrs 17.5 billion next year. The budget 
planners are seeking to reschedule the remaining debts. The draft 
budget is based on the average ruble rate of 21.5 to the dollar, and 
forecasts inflation of 30 percent next year. Alexander Zhukov, the 
chairman of the Duma's budget committee, dismissed both targets as 
overly optimistic now that the ruble has fallen below 20 rubles to 
the dollar and inflation this year is expected to top 70 percent. 
But Zhukov asked the Duma to approve the plan anyway. ``The budget 
rejection or a significant delay in its passage would bring our country 
to such situation that the economic crisis of August and September 
would seem a time of economic prosperity,'' he said. The previous 
government devalued the ruble and defaulted on some of its domestic 
debts in August, triggering Russia's worst economic crisis since the 
Soviet collapse and prompting foreign lenders to freeze further loans. 
Primakov also planned to meet Thursday with members of parliament's 
upper house, the Federation Council, who have balked on the budget 
because it would cut into regional tax revenues. The Federation Council, 
made up of regional governors fiercely protective of their funds, 
has put up little fight in budget proceedings in the past. Before 
the meeting, Primakov told the Duma that he is willing to compromise, 
but wouldn't allow bloated spending. The budget forecasts spending 
of 575 billion rubles (dlrs 29 billion) and revenues of 474 billion 
rubles (dlrs 24 billion), according to the Interfax news agency. It 
must pass four readings by the Duma before going to the Federation 
Council, and is unlikely to be approved before the new year.
