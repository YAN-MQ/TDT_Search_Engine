Italy's justice minister on Thursday rejected a Turkish request to 
order back to jail a Kurdish guerrilla leader who was widely reported 
to be on the verge of leaving Italy. A spokesman for the rebel Kurdistan 
Workers Party said Abdullah Ocalan was still staying at a villa on 
the outskirts of Rome, where he took up residence about a week after 
he was detained on Nov. 12 at the capital's airport. And in Berlin, 
Ocalan's German lawyer, Britta Boehler, told Berlin Aktuell Radio 
that the situation, while now ``quite unclear,'' would be cleared 
up either later Thursday or Friday. Ocalan's other lawyers and advisers 
were talking intensively with the Italian government to find a solution, 
she said. Boehler declined to say which country might take him. Ocalan, 
who showed up in Italy on a flight from Moscow, has been looking for 
a safe place to go since Syria expelled him earlier this year in response 
to heavy pressure from Turkey. Italy's tolerance of Ocalan has angered 
the Turkish government and sparked boycotts there of Italian products. 
Turkey wants Ocalan back to try as a terrorist, but Italy has refused 
to extradite him on grounds that Turkish courts could sentence him 
to death. Private Italian TV network Canale 5 quoted an Ocalan spokesman 
as saying the leader, who had requested asylum from Rome, had now 
definitely decided to leave Italy. Estonia, Ukraine, Libya and North 
Korea had been mentioned in news reports as possible destinations. 
Rejecting a motion filed by a lawyer for Turkey, Justice Minister 
Oliviero Diliberto, in a brief fax sent to an Italian appeals court, 
recommended that Ocalan still be allowed to come and go as he pleases. 
Ocalan was arrested here on a since-dropped warrant from Germany, 
which fears his presence in that country could inflame millions of 
Turkish immigrants, including many Kurds. In Ankara, Turkish Justice 
Minister Hasan Denizkurdu on Thursday said Italy was ``massacring 
justice'' by trying to send Ocalan away even before considering a 
Turkish request for his extradition. ``All the principles of justice 
have been violated since Ocalan arrived in Italy,'' Denizkurdu said, 
vowing that Turkey will ``follow him where wherever he goes. Turkey's 
extradition request remains in place.'' On Wednesday, Italian Premier 
Massimo D'Alema denied there were any negotiations to find a country 
which would take Ocalan. The Kurdistan Workers Party, or PKK, has 
been fighting since 1984 in southeastern Turkey for autonomy for Turkey's 
Kurds, a sizeable minority.
