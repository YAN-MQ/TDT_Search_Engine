Russia's Duma or Lower House of parliament has given initial approval 
to an austerity budget for 1999. VOA correspondent, Peter Heimline, 
reports from Moscow. The communist led Duma voted an overwhelming 
yes at the end of the day when prime minister Yevgeny Primakov first 
threatened to resign unless the budget was approved, then pleaded 
for support. In an emotional appeal to lawmakers, the Prime Minister 
promised his government would put an end to what he called monetarist 
nonsense and place a greater emphasis on the state's role in managing 
economic policy. The yes vote is considered a big victory, but leaves 
several difficult questions unanswered. Mr. Primakov had earlier said 
the budget was designed to restore foreign creditor's confidence. 
But Western analysts say the plan is based on several unrealistic 
expectations, including the willingness of creditors to postpone billions 
of dollars in loan payments. Something they have shown little willingness 
to do. Peter Heimline, VOA News, Moscow.
