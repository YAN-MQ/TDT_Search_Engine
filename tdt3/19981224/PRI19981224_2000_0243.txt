Israel's former army chief, Amnon Shahak, has formally retired from 
the military. There is speculation that he is going to challenge Prime 
Minister Benjamin Netanyahu in early general elections. Mr. Shahak 
says peace is his priority. What we have to do and first inside the 
Israeli society, we have to make peace for ourselves. But we need 
peace at home first and then peace with our neighbors as well. Israel's 
former army chief, Amnon Shahak.
