President B.J. Habibie wants to meet East Timor's Roman Catholic bishops 
to discuss efforts to make peace in the troubled territory, an Indonesian 
official said Thursday. Talks on how to end the conflict in the former 
Portuguese colony have gained ground since the resignation of authoritarian 
President Suharto in May after 32 years in power. Suharto ordered 
the Indonesian military to invade East Timor in 1975, triggering a 
separatist guerrilla war and widespread human rights abuses. His successor, 
President B.J. Habibie, has taken a more conciliatory approach and 
soon wants to meet East Timor's bishops, Carlos Belo and Basilio Do 
Nascimento. ``If possible, (the meeting) could take place before or 
just after the New Year,'' Lopes Da Cruz, Indonesia's ambassador for 
East Timor, said after a meeting with the president. Habibie met Belo 
six months ago in Jakarta. Jakarta has offered greater autonomy to 
East Timor in exchange for international recognition of its sovereignty. 
Pro-independence activists, however, say any autonomy deal must be 
transitional and that a vote on self-determination must eventually 
take place. The United Nations does not recognize Indonesian rule 
over the half-island territory and is sponsoring peace talks between 
Indonesia and Portugal, which it considers the administering power. 
East Timor Gov. Abilio Osorio Soares, who also attended the meeting 
with Habibie, said the president wants the bishops and other public 
figures to promote the idea of autonomy. Belo, co-winner of the 1996 
Nobel peace prize, has been a harsh critic of Indonesian policy in 
East Timor but has been supportive of negotiations. Jamsheed Marker, 
the U.N. envoy for East Timor, left Indonesia on Wednesday after meetings 
with pro- and anti-independence figures.
