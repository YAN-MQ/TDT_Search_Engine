A subsidiary of the U.S. tobacco giant, R. J. Reynolds, has pleaded 
guilty to participating in a multi million dollar scheme to smuggle 
cigarettes across the U.S./Canadian border. Northern Brands, Incorporated 
was fined $15 million after pleading guilty Tuesday in Federal Court 
in Bingamton, New York. The smuggling scheme unfolded in the mid-1990s, 
and it was designed to avoid excise taxes in both Canada and the United 
States. The scheme helped the smugglers evade more than $2 1/2 million 
in U.S. taxes alone. Tobacco companies have long argued that raising 
taxes on cigarettes would create black market smuggling.
