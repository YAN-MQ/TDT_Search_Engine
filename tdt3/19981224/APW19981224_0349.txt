One of Poland's leading conglomerates announced Thursday it would 
pay dlrs 25 million to cancel a controversial, secret agreement that 
sparked an investigation by the Securities and Exchange Commission. 
Elektrim SA, a founding member of the Warsaw Stock Exchange, will 
pay the money to Kulczyk Holdings SA to scrap the 1996 deal that called 
for Elektrim to sell Kulczyk a 6.5 percent stake in Polska Telefonia 
Cyfrowa, a cellular telephone company, for a nominal price. Disclosure 
of the 1996 agreement earlier this month caused Elektrim's shares 
to tumble in value and raised questions about the transparency of 
Poland's securities dealings. The Securities and Exchange Commission 
is investigating why Elektrim failed to reveal the agreement earlier. 
On Tuesday, the president and deputy president of Elektrim resigned 
under pressure from shareholders and investment houses. Elektrim agreed 
in 1996 to sell Kulczyk the 6.5 percent stake in its cellular phone 
holding, which was being set up, for the approximate share value at 
the time. Kulczyk was a financial backer of Elektrim's entry into 
the cellular telephone industry. The cellular phone company became 
one of two that received licenses to operate a digital network in 
Poland, causing the value of the business to increase dramatically. 
Analysts estimate that Elektrim's stake in the cellular phone company 
is now worth as much as dlrs 150 million, perhaps five times more 
than Elektrim would have received under the deal with Kulczyk. Elektrim 
is a diversified company with holdings in telecommunications, power 
generation equipment and other aspects of electrical engineering.
