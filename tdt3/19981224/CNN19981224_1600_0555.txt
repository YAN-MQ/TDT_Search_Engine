Traditional holiday meals are usually centered around some form of 
meat. But there are alternatives for vegetarians and those trying 
to limit their calories and grams of fat. Linda ciampa reports. If 
you're tired of feasting on the same Ole Turkey or roast beast during 
the holidays, there are plenty of meatless options this year, including 
"the unturkey" made from wheat gluten. It doesn't taste exactly like 
Turkey, but, you know, it's more spicy than turkey. It's better. The 
growing focus on healthy eating has many people craving a Change and 
even considering a vegetarian holiday meal. But vegetarian cookbook 
author Diana Shaw doesn't think cooks should pretend vegetables or 
grains can take the place of meat. Instead, her vegetarian cooking 
celebrates the produce of the season. That's why I don't refer to 
it as meatless cooking, because when you call it meatless, that implies 
that something's missing. And that would be like referring to French 
cuisine as jalapeno pepperless. Shaw's suggestion for a vegetarian 
holiday meal -- spinach salad with orange slices, sweet potato soup 
topped with cinnamon, a nest of couscous filled with peppers, dried 
fruits and chick peas and a steamed apple cake. This is really, really 
good food that happens to be healthy. Take a look at the numbers. 
While a traditional holiday meal of roast duck, stuffing, broccoli 
with hollandaise sauce, Cranberry sauce, a roll and pecan Pie will 
run about 1,200 calories and 55 grams of fat, Shaw's meal weighs in 
at 930 calories and 7 grams of fat. But the numbers are just a fringe 
benefit in Shaw's opinion. You don't cook from the nutrition numbers, 
you cook from flavors. But if your holiday table won't be complete 
without the traditional Turkey centerpiece, there's always tofurkey, 
Turkey made from tofu. May I have the carving knife please? Thank 
you, Frank. I want to slit my throat! The reviews may be mixed, but 
tofurkey, complete with stuffing, weighs in at less than 200 calories 
and five grams of fat per serving. Linda ciampa, CNN, Atlanta.
