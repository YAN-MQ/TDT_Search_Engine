Brushing aside NATO and U.S. warnings, Serb tanks and troops struck 
against a Kosovo Albanian rebel stronghold Thursday, dealing a blow 
to U.S.-led efforts to bring peace to the troubled Serb province. 
Ethnic Albanians said at least one person was killed and several others 
injured in what Serb officials reportedly called a ``limited'' operation 
in search of the killers of a Serb policeman slain in the area Monday. 
Ultra-nationalist Serbian Vice Premier Vojislav Seselj said ``our 
police must continue to clamp down against the terrorists,'' referring 
to the Kosovo Liberation Army. The KLA is fighting for independence 
for Kosovo, where ethnic Albanians form 90 percent of the province's 
2 million people. The province is in southern Serbia, the main Yugoslav 
republic. The Kosovo Information Center, close to the province's ethnic 
Albanian leadership, said Serb police and military raided six villages 
near Podujevo, 32 kilometers (20 miles) north of the provincial capital, 
Pristina. Hysni Fazliu, a spokesman for the party of leading ethnic 
Albanian politician Ibrahim Rugova, said rebels resisted the attack 
in a ``fierce battle.'' An Associated Press Television News crew saw 
the body of one man killed by a shell in one of the villages, Glavnik. 
Ethnic Albanians said three others were injured in the blast and that 
many more injuries were reported in other villages that came under 
the attack. Hundreds of ethnic Albanians, including women and children, 
fled the region on foot and by vehicles on snow-covered roads and 
hills around Podujevo. Jorgen Grunnet, a spokesman for the Organization 
for Security and Cooperation in Europe, confirmed shelling and machine-gun 
fire in the area but had no details about the extent of the fighting. 
Grunnet also confirmed one death and said the operation ended by late 
afternoon. He said convoys of Yugoslav army vehicles, including several 
Russian-built T-55 tanks, were seen leaving bases in Pristina and 
Podujevo early Thursday. They converged just west of Podujevo and 
launched the operation. He said Yugoslav authorities told the OSCE 
the sweep was a ``limited search operation.'' But Grunnet told CNN-International 
that the operation seemed more than ``a normal police operation than 
you see in most countries of the world.'' The operation marks a new 
setback to the already shaky U.S.-brokered cease-fire agreement that 
ended the worst of the fighting on Oct. 12. About 1,000 people were 
killed and 300,000 fled their homes in fighting that began Feb. 28 
when Yugoslav President Slobodan Milosevic launched a crackdown on 
ethnic Albanian secessionists. On Wednesday, State Department spokesman 
James Rubin warned of the increasing violence. ``A large-scale crackdown 
against the civilian population of Kosovo would do nothing to improve 
the security situation and could spark a cycle of violence that would 
seriously undermine the cease-fire agreement,'' Rubin said. The chief 
ethnic Albanian peace negotiator, Fehmi Agani, called the Serb operation 
a ``very serious provocation'' and a ``a bold challenge to NATO,'' 
which had threatened airstrikes in October to halt the fighting. Adem 
Demaci, a speaker for the KLA, said that people fled the new Serb 
offensive and claimed that about 100 Serb tanks were involved in the 
operation. According to the ethnic Albanian report, Serb tanks had 
entered one of the villages, Lapastica, a stronghold of the KLA. The 
APTN crew saw one U.S. observer vehicle enter Lapastica moments before 
heavy gunfire was heard in the village. The ethnic Albanian report 
said several houses were set ablaze. A later report by the ethnic 
Albanian center said Serb snipers had taken up positions at ``strategic 
points'' in the area and were firing at civilians, who were fleeing 
deeper into rebel territory. Xemail Mustafa, a spokesman for for the 
province's ethnic Albanian leaders, said ``This offensive confirms 
our worst fears that the Serbian regime planned to use the Christmas 
holidays to launch an action aimed at ethnically cleansing the north 
of Kosovo.'' Mustafa urged foreign governments and the international 
monitors sent to Kosovo to verify a two-month-old cease-fire to intervene 
with Yugoslav authorities to halt the attacks. On Wednesday, two top 
NATO officials warned both sides against launching more attacks. The 
alliance's supreme commander for Europe, Gen. Wesley Clark, complained 
of ``increasingly aggressive Serb military and police activities.'' 
NATO Secretary-General Javier Solana echoed those concerns, saying 
in Brussels, Belgium, that the escalating violence and killings ``pose 
a grave risk to the cease-fire.'' ``We remain fully vigilant and ready 
to act,'' he said.
