When 23-year-old Andonia Lynch walked off the airplane in Barbados, 
customs officials were impressed to see her managing a baby on one 
arm and an 81-pound (36-kilogram) suitcase on the other. They were 
even more impressed, however, by the luggage's contents _ bags and 
bags of high-quality marijuana that had escaped a recent police sweep 
of marijuana farms and processing huts on the nearby island of St. 
Vincent. Lynch, a St. Vincent native, was convicted Thursday of drug 
trafficking and sentenced to three years in jail. She was detained 
Monday night at the Bridgetown airport. Magistrate Valton Bend ordered 
the 11-month-old baby into government custody until family members 
in St. Vincent claim it.
