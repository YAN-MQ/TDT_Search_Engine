An appeals court has reduced the sentence of a former Tehran mayor 
convicted of corruption from five years to two years in jail, a judiciary 
statement said Thursday. The court also reduced the period Gholamhossein 
Karbaschi was banned from assuming public office from 20 to 10 years. 
It replaced his sentence of 60 lashes with a fine of 10 million rials 
(dlrs 3,000), statement said. This would be in addition to the original 
fines he was ordered to pay: 1 billion rials (dlrs 330,000) as punishment 
and 600 million rials (dlrs 200,000) that he must pay back the city. 
Karbaschi, a key ally of moderate President Mohammad Khatami, had 
been a target of hard-line political rivals, and many Iranians saw 
the trial as a political settling of scores. The judiciary in Iran 
is controlled by hard-liners. Karbaschi was found guilty in July of 
embezzlement during his eight years as Tehran's mayor. He filed an 
appeal in August. It was not immediately clear when Karbaschi, who 
has been out on bail, will begin serving his sentence. During his 
trial, which lasted more than a month, Karbaschi admitted to making 
mistakes, but denied stealing public money. Karbaschi won wide respect 
for his work as mayor. He built parks and social centers and reduced 
pollution and traffic congestion. But he also made enemies among the 
merchant class which resented his taxes and his support for Khatami, 
a moderate cleric who believes in relaxing the Islamic social code. 
His pro-Khatami stance also incurred the enmity of hard-liners. Riots 
erupted in Iran soon after Karbaschi's arrest in April. For many Iranians, 
the televised trial gave the first insight into Iran's judicial process 
and moderates saw it more as an indictment of the judiciary than the 
mayor.
