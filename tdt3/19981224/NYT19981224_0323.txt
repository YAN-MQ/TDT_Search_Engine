The New York Times said in an editorial for Friday, Dec. 25: U.S. 
forces are withdrawing from military bases all over the world, but 
in many cases what they are leaving behind is dangerous to the local 
population and environment. Fuels, cleaning fluids, lubricants and 
other chemicals are leaching into groundwater, and unexploded shells 
linger on testing grounds long after U.S. soldiers leave. Under the 
Panana Canal Treaties, which require the United States to give up 
its bases there at the end of next year, Washington must take all 
``practicable'' measures to remove hazards. Washington contends it 
has done that, and is now balking at paying for the cleanup of the 
bases, whose chemicals are contaminating the groundwater. Panama contends 
that unexploded bombs have killed 21 people in the last 20 years. 
The Pentagon says the figure is lower. In the last few years, the 
Pentagon has begun to dispose of waste safely. It is also removing 
hazardous waste, or paying to do so, at bases in important allied 
countries such as Germany and Canada. But in most nations base agreements 
are decades old, signed long before anyone paid attention to environmental 
damage. Where there is no legal obligation, Pentagon officials say, 
Congress bars them from spending money for cleanup after the base 
is closed. Many congressmen feel the security provided by a U.S. military 
base was payment enough. This view is not a popular one in countries 
that lack the money to clean up, or even evaluate, hazards. When the 
United States pulled out of the Clark and Subic Bay bases in the Philippines 
beginning in 1991, it left dozens of sites where toxic chemicals and 
asbestos had been dumped or buried in unsecured landfills. These may 
now be the cause of disease among people living nearby. Washington 
has paid the Philippines nothing for cleanup and has released only 
perfunctory information about the hazards. New laws are needed to 
provide the Pentagon with funds to repair its environmental damage 
and develop new technologies for sweeping up live bombs. The risks 
do not stop at the border, and neither should U.S. accountability.
