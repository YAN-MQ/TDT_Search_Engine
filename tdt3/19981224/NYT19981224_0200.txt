The timing couldn't be better. The Huntington Library in San Marino, 
Calif., has mounted an exhibition on George Washington that focuses 
on ideas instead of artifacts. The wisdom of the first president comes 
through loud and clear in the approximately 130 letters, manuscripts, 
maps and rare printed documents in the show, many eerily relevant 
to the current national debate. As the bicentennial of Washington's 
death approaches in 1999, several exhibitions about him, including 
``Treasures From Mount Vernon: George Washington Revealed,'' now at 
the New-York Historical Society, have been organized. Washington was 
no intellectual; his formal education ended when he was 15. But he 
was a leader who could not bear the political squabbling that dominated 
national affairs in the later years in his presidency. ``Just before 
his second inauguration, the president spoke to Jefferson of the `extreme 
wretchedness of my existence while in office,''' wrote John Rhodehamel, 
curator of the Huntington Library show, in the catalog, ``The Great 
Experiment: George Washington and the American Republic'' (Yale University 
Press). Rhodehamel continued: ``A few months later, Washington told 
his Secretary of State that he regretted `but once' having agreed 
to serve a second term. Unfortunately, that `once,' Washington continued, 
was `every moment since.' He swore that `by God he had rather be in 
his grave than in his present situation.''' Washington was reacting 
to the bitter partisan battles between Alexander Hamilton's Federalists 
and Thomas Jefferson's Republicans that had begun in 1790. Washington's 
disillusionment with American politics shows up again in the draft 
of his 1794 Annual Message, another item in the show. In the draft, 
he expressed fears that the Whiskey Rebellion in Pennsylvania might 
become an insurrection and worried about the precarious state of the 
union. He wrote: ``When we call to mind the gracious indulgences of 
Heaven by which the American people became a nation, when we survey 
the general prosperity of our Country, and look forward to the riches, 
power and happiness to which it seems destined, with the deepest regret 
do I announce to you that during your recess some of the citizens 
of the United States have been found capable of an insurrection.'' 
In 1799, when Connecticut's Governor, Jonathan Trumbull, asked him 
to run for a third presidential term in 1800, he would not even consider 
it. ``Washington explained that new political conditions in the country 
made his candidacy irrelevant,'' Gordon S. Wood, a Pulitzer Prize-winning 
historian, wrote in the catalog. ``In this new democratic era of party 
politics, he said `personal influence,' distinctions of character, 
no longer mattered. If the members of the Republican Party `set up 
a broomstick' as a candidate and called it a `true son of Liberty' 
or a `Democrat' or `any other epithet that will suit their purpose,' 
it still would `command their votes in toto!''' The exhibition reveals 
a truly humane Washington, from his first battles to his last will 
and testament. In one letter to his stepdaughter, Eliza Parke Custis 
(Washington had no children of his own) he tried to advise her about 
the dangers of passionate love. ``There are emotions of a softer kind, 
to wch. the heart of a girl turned eighteen, is susceptible,'' he 
wrote. ``Do not deceive yourself in supposing that the only means 
by which these are to be obtained, is to drink deep of the cup and 
revel in an ocean of love. Love is a mighty pretty thing; but like 
all other delicious things, it is cloying . . . too dainty a food 
to live upon alone.'' The exhibition material is drawn from the collections 
of the Huntington, the Pierpont Morgan Library in New York, Mount 
Vernon and the Smithsonian Institution's National Museum of American 
History. The show will be at the Huntington through May 30, 1999; 
then it moves to the Morgan Library. There may not be too many Washington 
letters about partisan politics around, but Washington letters are 
not as rare as one might think. He wrote long letters about farm management 
at Mount Vernon throughout the entire Revolutionary War. ``There's 
a lot of Washington material still on the market,'' said Chris Coover 
of Christie's. ``Some excellent letters are still circulating privately.'' 
On Dec. 9 Christie's sold a letter from Washington to his commander 
at Fort Pitt during the Western campaign of 1780 for $25,300. ``This 
shows how moderate the prices are, even today,'' Coover said. ``Washington's 
letters are less valuable than Jefferson's or Lincoln's, though Washington 
had better handwriting.'' On Dec. 15 Sotheby's sold four Washington 
letters, three relating to the Revolutionary War, for $7,500 to $21,850 
apiece. Joseph Rubinfine, a veteran autograph dealer in West Palm 
Beach, Fla., also has several Washington letters for sale, though 
nothing on party politics. ``Remember, agriculture was his principal 
interest,'' Rubinfine said. In an essay in ``George Washington's Mount 
Vernon,'' a new book from the Monacelli Press, the architect Allan 
Greenberg tracked Washington's passionate involvement with the house 
he acquired from the estate of his half brother Lawrence in 1752. 
Washington, who never left the United States, was a self-taught architect 
who formed many of his ideas by reading English pattern books, unlike 
Jefferson, who lived in Paris and studied the city's architecture. 
the Legion of Honor, across the street from the Musee d'Orsay.) Greenberg 
points out details in Mount Vernon one might not notice, like its 
asymmetrical facade. He says Washington was making a statement about 
the difference between a mansion in the New World versus the Old. 
He also notes that the plaster decorations in the dining room ceiling 
depict shovels and plows, not the gilded weapons or musical instruments 
seen at Versailles. Such ideas will undoubtedly be studied anew next 
year, as other Washington exhibitions open. On Jan. 28 the Octagon, 
the museum of the American Architectural Foundation in Washington, 
plans to open ``George Washington: Architect.'' In April Greenberg 
will publish his own book on Washington as an architect and on April 
18 will lecture at the Huntington.
