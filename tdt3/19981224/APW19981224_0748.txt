Istanbul's largest Roman Catholic Church called off Christmas Eve 
midnight Mass, citing security concerns due to strong anti-Italian 
sentiment over Italy's harboring of a Kurdish rebel. ``There will 
be no midnight service this year,'' said a notice at the entrance 
of St. Anthony's church. Church officials told Turkey's Anatolia news 
agency a service would be held Friday morning. Italy's refusal to 
extradite Kurdish rebel leader Abdullah Ocalan to Turkey for trial 
has angered many Turks, sparking violent anti-Italian protests and 
boycotts on Italian goods. Turkey is an overwhelmingly Islamic country 
with only a tiny Christian minority. In 1996, a concussion bomb placed 
in a confessional in St. Anthony's went off during a service at the 
church. No one was injured. The war between Kurdish rebels and Turkey's 
military has killed 37,000 since 1984.
