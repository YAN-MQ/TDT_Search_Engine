The stock market has been so volatile, so scary, this year that you'd 
think it would have tossed off investors the way a dog shakes off 
water after a bath. After all, the market took a huge dip last year, 
and right around the time investors were really panicking, it came 
back, only to retreat this past August and then roar back again. Although 
stocks shot up last week, their erratic behavior has created a nervousness 
among investors that could have a lasting effect on the market. An 
economist told me recently that he believed the next time the market 
corrected, many investors would get out and stay out. Some professional 
investment strategists are even questioning the buy-and-hold strategy 
popularized by Warren E. Buffett _ buying stocks in well-run companies 
and hanging on _ saying it may be time to scale back on equities and 
load up on Treasury bills. Until now, baby boomers have generally 
stayed put. But signs are multiplying that many of us are having second 
thoughts. We are coming to realize that our huge market gains have 
more to do with sheer luck than our own brilliance. We became cocky 
because just about any stock we bought went up. Buy, buy, buy and 
hold turned out to be a successful strategy, but how high did our 
SAT's have to be to figure that out? Sure, boomers lived through the 
crash of 1987, but that turned out to be a juicy buying opportunity 
for those with some market savvy. I made a good move by stocking up 
on the Coca-Cola Co. two days after the crash. Then again, I also 
bought Toys ``R'' Us. Altogether, not much of a track record. One 
clue to how investors will react next year is their current behavior, 
and statistics from the Investment Company Institute show skittishness. 
Before last August's plunge, investors were pouring a net average 
of $21 billion a month into stock mutual funds; they yanked out $11.7 
billion in August and then tiptoed back in with net inflows of $6.3 
billion and $2.4 billion, respectively, in September and October. 
Another clue is to listen to the talk around the pool. Many members 
of the Westminster Whales Masters Swim Team, an adult swim team in 
Atlanta, watch the market closely. In the last year, as the market 
danced around, they made some moves. But the message I get from them 
is that while they are still tinkering with their portfolios, they 
are doing so with trepidation. ``I'm not smart enough to pick the 
peaks and valleys,'' said Walter Gillikin, 39, a team member and a 
senior vice president at Wachovia Bank. ``There's plenty of smart 
people who can't even do that.'' Still, when stocks fell this year, 
Gillikin, the father of twin 11-month-old boys, remembered the buying 
opportunities of 1987. So this time he shifted some investments, selling 
some stocks and funds to buy stock in Tellabs and Medtronic and put 
more money into a stock index fund. Altogether, he moved about $35,000 
around. Another member of the swim team, Deborah Maslia, 37, is single 
and a health care consultant for Ernst &AMP; Young. When the market 
fell last year, she adjusted the contributions she was making into 
her 401(k) plan, lowering the portion going into an overseas stock 
fund and putting more into a domestic stock fund. ``The money I put 
in is money I could lose and be O.K.,'' she said. ``For that reason, 
I haven't really changed my strategy. I don't get in it for quick 
gains.'' When the market fell in August, she just watched. ``I had 
the willies,'' she said. ``I didn't know if I had the nerve to jump 
in again.'' Putting two children through college has made Mary Pat 
Mayer, a 46-year-old single mother, very conservative. To cut costs, 
she refinanced her home and cut back her contributions to her Individual 
Retirement Account. She has also taken out a home-equity line of credit 
to help with college costs. But after the market fell in August, she 
sensed an opportunity and asked her broker what to do. Buy, he said, 
so she sold shares in a couple of mutual funds and bought stock in 
Worldcom, now MCI Worldcom, and Home Depot. ``I don't want to be poor 
when I retire,'' she said. ``I want to believe the people who say, 
`Buy it and hang in there.' That's the kind of investor I am.'' The 
common thread is this: As many people did in '87, these investors 
are looking at market dips as opportunities to pick up bargains _ 
but they are not putting new money into the market beyond what they 
were planning to invest in retirement plans. They are continuing payroll 
deductions for those plans and rejiggering the portfolio mix. It is 
as though they have seen the darkness and didn't like it much. Ms. 
Maslia's willies have not gone away, and she plans to be even more 
careful next year. ``I'll be more watchful because of what happened 
this year,'' she said. ``Fool me once, shame on you. Fool me twice, 
shame on me.''
