The UN Security Council is to continue its debate on Iraq next week, 
amid sharp differences among its leading members. Disagreement emerged 
Wednesday, when the United States opposed several proposals from other 
permanent members in the Security Council. Washington opposed Moscow's 
proposal that the Council express regret for last week's U.S. led 
air strikes. The United States also opposes Russia's proposal that 
UN Secretary General, Kofi Annan, be given an important role to deal 
with Baghdad. The United States says Mr. Annan's role should be limited 
to promoting humanitarian relief in Iraq.
