They had been here before, of course, but somehow it all looked different. 
``So clean, well lighted, much more than I remember,'' said Adolph 
Green, words drawn out and tone approving, as he shuffled toward the 
mammoth apotosaurus on the fourth floor of the American Museum of 
Natural History. ``Just like Times Square, all cleaned up,'' responded 
Betty Comden briskly. ``I remember vividly the first time I was here, 
going to the cafeteria and having raisin bread with cream cheese. 
The cafeteria looked Mexican or Aztec. It seemed quite exotic.'' ``What 
I remember best was not being in class, not being in school, what 
a joy,'' Green chimed in. ``An excursion,'' she replied. ``I love 
excursions.'' Since they have become suddenly ubiquitous at the age 
of 83, it seemed a good time to take an excursion with Green and Ms. 
Comden, the longest-running partnership the musical theater has produced. 
The two have been professional but not personal partners since 1938. 
He has been married to the actress Phyllis Newman for 38 years. Her 
husband, Steven Kyle, died in 1979. There is ``On the Town,'' the 
adaptation of the Jerome Robbins-Leonard Bernstein ballet ``Fancy 
Free,'' which was first produced in 1944 and is being revived on Broadway 
by the Public Theater. There is ``Peter Pan,'' this time starring 
Cathy Rigby at the Marquis, and destined, one assumes, to be running 
in perpetuity somewhere on earth. There is even a new libretto for 
the Met's revival of ``Die Fledermaus,'' Johann Strauss Jr.'s operetta, 
which has been around quite a bit longer than Comden and Green have. 
Recreating ``On the Town's'' manic 24-hour jaunt via subway and taxi 
from the Brooklyn Navy Yard to Times Square to Coney Island and back 
was out of the question. And even if the time, energy and patience 
with the Christmas traffic were there, the Navy Yard and the amusement 
park at Coney Island are shadows of what they once were and most of 
the clubs that were the inspiration for the ones in the three sailors' 
one-day leave are gone. But a scaled-down tour seemed worth a try, 
beginning at the museum's magnificent piles of bones _ tyrannosaurus 
rex and apotosaurus _ where the sailor Ozzie, originally played by 
Green, meets the anthropologist Claire DeLoone, originally played 
by Ms. Comden. Ms. Comden, thin, obsessively punctual and as decisive 
as a surgical knife, was outfitted in a dramatic blue Koos fringed 
coat with bold patches of color and a black shawl. Green, warm and 
avuncular, his vision clouded by cataracts and his gait more noticeably 
slowed by age, was in a checked shirt, blue tie, blue blazer and heavy 
winter coat. When it opened in 1944, ``On the Town'' established itself 
as an instant classic. The current production, directed by George 
C. Wolfe, has received hot and cold reviews. It would take a good 
deal more than half a century in the theater to render Ms. Comden 
and Green oblivious to the critical reaction to their work. Indeed, 
the passage of time may have made them that much more attuned. So 
when asked whether it's fair to wonder if the adventures of 1944 resonate 
with audiences in 1998, whether a night of wartime romance can compete 
with Nicole Kidman's curves, Ms. Comden jumped on the question like 
Sammy Sosa getting a chest-high fastball. ``The feelings and thoughts 
and relationships are universal, so it's very contemporary,'' she 
said with a hint of pique. ``And the women in it are very aggressive, 
very forthcoming, very much of today. In wartime all the women had 
men's jobs, so it's very relevant.'' With equal conviction, if less 
edge, Green added: ``It's totally not enveloped in nostalgia of any 
kind. There's not a hint of it. No `Remember what it was like.' We 
couldn't be happier with the production.'' Ms. Comden threw in: ``And 
the music is timeless. Not the jitterbug music of the '40s. It's brilliant 
symphonic music. Very fresh, very original.'' In short, it didn't 
take long to get two things straight. The first is that rather than 
a couple who finish each other's sentences, Ms. Comden and Green are 
more like a single creature with two brains, heads and mouths. They 
both gobble up all questions, ornament each other's thoughts and edit 
each other's declarations, like some agreeable beast out of Dr. Seuss. 
The second is that rather than being content with the status of revered 
eminences grises, they see themselves very much as players, who still 
hole up in a room together almost every day and go to work as they 
have for the last six decades. Neither should be a surprise. Ms. Comden, 
born in Brooklyn in May 1915, and Green, born in the Bronx seven months 
later, got to know each other when they were both going to auditions 
in the 1930s, and began working together in 1938, when Max Gordon 
of the Village Vanguard decided he wanted a musical group to perform 
on a Sunday night. He first recruited Judy Holliday, who brought in 
Green, who recruited Ms. Comden. Eventually there were five of them 
called the Revuers. They thought of themselves more as performers 
who wrote their own material than as writers until their friend Leonard 
Bernstein, who first met Green at a summer camp where Bernstein was 
working in 1937, came to them with the idea of turning ``Fancy Free'' 
into a musical. They had never written a musical but saw no reason 
why they couldn't. By the time they were done, the show became the 
first to be sold to Hollywood before it was even produced on Broadway. 
Their next effort was ``Billion Dollar Baby,'' and as the years went 
by their projects included Broadway shows like ``Bells Are Ringing,'' 
``Applause'' and ``On the 20th Century'' and films like ``The Band 
Wagon'' and ``Singin' in the Rain,'' which is still perhaps the most 
acclaimed film musical of all time. They have won six Tony Awards 
as book writers or lyricists and were nominated for two Oscars. For 
the moment, however, they were less interested in awards then in mugging 
for the cameras, breaking into a hammy rendition of ``Carried Away'' 
from ``On the Town'' as baffled children, parents and dinosaurs looked 
on. ``Let's walk more swiftly, Adolph,'' Ms. Green urged as they made 
their way from the dinosaurs to the Neanderthals. ``I will walk as 
swiftly as will please any summer's day,'' he replied jauntily, as 
they headed toward a waiting car for stop No. 2, Carnegie Hall, a 
place with real-life and theatrical resonance for them. In the show, 
it's where Madame Dilly teaches music and where Gabey, one of the 
three sailors, meets the object of his infatuation, the Miss Turnstiles 
winner whose subway poster sets the plot in motion. But it is also 
where Bernstein used to live in one of the studios that have housed 
such artists as George Balanchine and Isadora Duncan, and where Enrico 
Caruso made his first U.S. recordings in 1904 for $400 a song at the 
Victor Talking Machine Company studio. As usual, there is much back 
and forthing. About whether the music teacher was changed in the movie 
of ``On the Town'' to a ballet teacher named Madame Dilyovska. About 
Bernstein and Green's both being hospitalized for minor operations 
at the beginning of the writing of ``On the Town.'' ``Adolph had his 
tonsils out and had to rest his voice,'' Ms. Comden explained. ``It 
was like losing life itself.'' They made their way through grotto-like 
hallways, an acting studio here, an opera soprano's voice bouncing 
off the walls there, until they came to No. 803, which houses Carnegie 
Hall's marketing department and leads to what used to be No. 805, 
Bernstein's apartment, where Green crashed for months. One of the 
first things they see is a framed photograph of Bernstein, looking 
impossibly young, resting his head on his right hand and looking straight 
at the camera as he posed by the south-facing window in 1943. ``Look 
at this,'' said Ms. Comden, momentarily thrown for a loop. ``It's 
a picture of Lenny.'' ``It's taken by this window.'' ``Look what a 
beautiful young man he was.'' They looked on silently and then together 
recreated the apartment, explaining where the piano, the daybed and 
the few chairs were. Bernstein lived there in the early 1940s; it 
is where he wrote ``Fancy Free.'' They lingered a bit and headed for 
the streets, Green, in a counter-nostalgic mood, grumbling about what 
a dump the old Coney Island was. Then it was time for lunch. Where 
to go? There are no more Nedick's, the Nathan's-like hot dog stands 
featured in the play. Sardi's would be appropriate, but it's crowded 
and noisy. So instead we headed to the Supreme Macaroni Company on 
Ninth Avenue between 38th and 39th Streets, not ``On the Town'' but 
eternal New York. The decor _ white tile floor, Italian family photographs, 
hanging wine bottles _ looks precisely the same as it did when it 
opened in 1947. Ms. Comden briskly ordered antipasto with a glass 
of water. Green fussed about a bit and then ordered antipasto with 
a cup of tea. They swatted away the predictable questions about who 
does what with the predictable response that they both do everything 
together. Still, it's not hard to see some differences. Certainly, 
the brassy independent women of ``On the Town'' could not be more 
like Ms. Comden. And she is the organized one who has put their words 
down on paper, first on a yellow legal pad, now on a computer, while 
he's still trying to make his peace with any kind of technology. ``The 
first thing that confused me was the electric light,'' he said. ``I 
remember how staggered I was back when you picked up the phone and 
said what number you wanted when a dial took its place, for Pete's 
sake. I'm still staggered by that.'' She said: ``One thing we used 
to fight about was time, having spent many days waiting for Adolph. 
But that's over now. He's very prompt, and I'm getting a little messier 
around the edges.'' ``Yes,'' he responded agreeably. ``I've been whipped 
into total submission.'' Still, they agree on more than they disagree: 
on Stephen Sondheim's brilliance, on ``Guys and Dolls'' as the best 
musical of them all, on the mixed blessings of the new, sanitized, 
cleaned-up Times Square, on the contemporary curses of too many skyscrapers 
blotting out the sky and too much traffic clogging the streets. But 
having spent their entire lives living in and chronicling New York, 
they are almost too much a part of the city to notice it. So when 
asked to philosophize whether the city was more a place transformed 
or more a place essentially like the one that entranced their wartime 
sailors, they drew mutual blanks. ``I miss the tawdry, disreputable 
aspects of the old days,'' she said, ``But I don't think too much 
about it. This is where we live and work and get up every morning. 
Does one get up and look at one's environs and decode it? We don't 
do that. But it's still an extraordinary city. Look at all the tourists. 
You can't move because of them. They're not that much different from 
our sailors from Scranton, Peoria and Iowa. I don't think they leave 
disappointed.'' It's only 2:30 and Ms. Comden is hurrying us along 
so she can make her 4 o'clock appointment. But we have one more stop. 
We make it down to the West Village on the off chance someone will 
be at the Village Vanguard, where they played their first job one 
Sunday evening for $5 each. Indeed, it was the first time any paid 
act played there, and the regular poets and village habitues hooted 
and hissed, figuring the place was just fine as the hangout it was. 
The door was locked, but Peter Bondy the piano tuner was there waiting, 
and sure enough someone promptly showed up to let him in. We all descended 
the trapdoor-like staircase together. A moment later, Lorraine Gordon, 
the club owner and widow of Max Gordon, showed up. They reminisced 
about the Sunday comics that used to wallpaper the place and about 
clubs long gone, and then wandered behind the bar where the original 
performing area was until Ms. Comden's 4 o'clock was looming, and 
it was time to go. ``You're welcome to come in for an audition Sunday 
night,'' Mrs. Gordon said sweetly. ``But we don't have any new material,'' 
Ms. Comden replied. ``That's OK,'' she said. ``The old is still good. 
The old is just fine.'' Here is information about shows mentioned
