Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu would lose against each 
of the likely candidates to face him in early elections, according 
to a poll published Thursday. According to the poll taken by the Maariv 
daily and Gallup, the leader of the opposition, a just-announced contender 
and another who has yet to announce his candidacy would beat the hardline 
premier who has led Israel for two and a half years. No single candidate 
is expected to receive enough of the votes in the first round, and 
elections will probably go to a run-off. Labor Party Ehud Barak _ 
until recently the only other serious contender _ would receive 45 
percent as opposed to Netanyahu's 38 percent in a final run for the 
premiership. Those saying they would vote for neither, or didn't know, 
amounted to 17 percent. Support for Netanyahu and Barak had been almost 
even in polls for months until recent weeks when the leader of the 
Labor Party pulled ahead. Dan Meridor, who left Netanyahu's Likud 
Party on Wednesday to announce his candidacy at the head of a centrist 
party that has yet to be formed, would receive 44 percent of the vote 
over 33 percent for Netanyahu in a run-off. Twenty-three percent of 
respondents said they would vote for neither or did not know for whom 
they would vote. The fourth candidate, former army chief of staff 
Amnon Lipkin-Shahak, would come out the winner with 48 percent of 
the vote over Netanyahu's 33 percent. Eighteen percent said they did 
not know for whom they would vote, or would not vote. Shahak left 
the army only Thursday and has yet to officially announce his candidacy. 
He has said he may join Meridor's party and would serve under him 
if polls revealed Meridor had a greater chance to beat Netanyahu. 
Israel's parliament, the Knesset, gave initial approval to early elections 
on Monday when nationalists and doves alike united in opposition to 
Netanyahu's peace policies. Nationalists were incensed at Netanyahu's 
agreement to further territorial concessions to the Palestinians, 
made two months ago at U.S.-brokered talks in Wye, Maryland. Doves 
_ among them, Barak _ say that Netanyahu's recent freeze on the concessions 
is endangering the peace. The election bill is slated to pass its 
second and third readings next month. Israeli media reports say the 
elections may be held on April 27. The Maariv-Gallup poll was conducted 
Wednesday evening and questioned 560 people. It had a margin of error 
of 4.5 percent.
