A stooped, slowed Pope John Paul II celebrated the 20th Christmas 
of his papacy with his mind on the next one, looking forward to the 
jubilee year that will begin Christianity's third millennium. John 
Paul delivered his Christmas Eve homily in a floodlit St. Peter's 
Basilica. From there, on Dec. 24, 1999, the pope will launch celebrations 
for 2000 with the symbolic opening of a door that is sealed during 
all but church anniversary years. ``My thoughts already turn to Christmas 
next year, when, God willing, the church shall inaugurate the great 
jubilee with the opening of the holy door,'' John Paul said in a midnight 
Mass televised in about 40 countries. The phrase was a slight change 
in wording from his prepared text _ in the original, the pope said 
he himself would inaugurate the jubilee. Increasingly frail at 78, 
the pope had kept his schedule light for days to rest for the midnight 
Mass. Flu and a fever had forced him to cancel some events last week. 
John Paul walked slowly up the long aisle of the nearly 4-acre basilica. 
At times when he had to stand in the more than 1 1/2-hour service, 
he often clutched his silver staff with both hands, the rod higher 
than his own bent figure. But he smiled when children came forward 
to the altar to present ceremonial gifts. Leaning forward, he patted 
their heads. Walking back down the aisle after the Mass, John Paul 
crossed slowly back and forth from one side to the other, shaking 
hands with the faithful stretching their arms out to him. John Paul 
has devoted much of his papacy toward preparing the church for the 
third millennium. ``It will be a truly great holy year,'' he said 
Thursday. ``For in a completely unique way, it will celebrate the 
2000th anniversary of the event and mystery of the incarnation in 
which humanity reached the apex of its calling. God became man in 
order to give man a share in his own divinity. ``This is the good 
news of salvation. This is the message of Christmas! The church proclaims 
it tonight by means of my words, too, for the peoples and nations 
of the whole Earth to hear. Christ is born for us. Come, let us adore 
him!'' Thousands listened inside the basilica. Many more lingered 
outside in St. Peter's Square, where lights on the season's nativity 
scene and giant fir tree were lit for the first time earlier in the 
night. John Paul introduced both customs to the Vatican. At midnight, 
church bells rang across Rome to mark the coming of Christmas. The 
pope no longer celebrates Mass on Christmas morning in St. Peter's 
Basilica to allow himself more time to rest up from the midnight Mass. 
He is scheduled to keep up his tradition of appearing before tourists 
and pilgrims in the square at noon on Christmas Day, when he reads 
a Christmas message and gives holiday greetings in dozens of languages. 
After Christmas, the pope plans to have his usual few days of rest 
at the papal residence in a town outside Rome.
