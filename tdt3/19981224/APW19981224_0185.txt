Ethnic Albanian sources claim Serb forces launched a strong offensive 
Thursday on a Kosovo rebel stronghold in the north of the province. 
The report could not be immediately confirmed. The Kosovo Albanian 
Information Center said heavy Serb military and police forces began 
a sweeping attack at 9 a.m. (0800 GMT), targeting six villages near 
Podujevo, 32 kilometers (20 miles) north of provincial capital Pristina. 
The Center said that the focus of the attack was near Lapastica, a 
stronghold of the guerrilla secessionist Kosovo Liberation Army, just 
west of Podujevo. The report said tanks had already entered Lapastica. 
It claimed that Serb army and police, including special police forces, 
were shelling the region's villages across a 17-kilometer (11 miles) 
stretch of terrain and that several ethnic Albanian houses were set 
ablaze. The Center also said that so far, one ethnic Albanian villager 
from Sekiraca village was reported killed in the attack but indicated 
it had no conclusive casualty toll. An ethnic Albanian spokesman told 
reporters in Pristina Thursday that the latest attack was planned 
in advance by Belgrade authorities. ``This offensive confirms our 
worst fears that the Serbian regime planned to use the Christmas holidays 
to launch an action aimed at ethnically cleansing the north of Kosovo,'' 
spokesman Xemail Mustafa said. Mustafa called on urgent action by 
the international community and Kosovo's verifiers to pressure Belgrade 
into halting the offensive. The head of Kosovo Information Center, 
Enver Maloku, told reporters that shelling could be heard on the outskirts 
of Podujevo.
