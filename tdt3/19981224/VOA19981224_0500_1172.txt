National Basketball Association commissioner, David Stern, says if 
a labor dispute with players cannot be resolved soon, he will cancel 
the rest of the season. In an interview with Fox television, Stern 
said he would love to sit down and negotiate with union head, Billy 
Hunter. Stern says the league wants the players to be involved in 
a successful partnership with NBA owners. This is not about the owners 
expecting the players to cave. We wanted a strong union. We want the 
players to understand that the system under which the owners have 
operated is just not one that makes economic sense. Stern warns, however, 
if no talks are held, he will have to call a meeting of the NBA Board 
of Governors to discuss canceling the season. Stern needs permission 
from the board to wipe out the remaining regular season games. The 
team owners locked players out of team facilities beginning in July 
because players' salaries were outpacing revenues. So far, two months 
of the regular season have been canceled. February's all star game 
has been called off and players have lost hundreds of millions of 
dollars in salaries.
