Windy, cold, snowy weather is making its way across much of the United 
States. In some parts of New York, the temperature dropped 25 degrees 
within ten hours. In Dallas, winter weather is delaying air traffic, 
and that's having a Ripple effect as thousands of travelers try to 
get to their holiday destinations. In Memphis, fed-ex says some flights 
for overnight air delivery service have been delayed because of the 
weather. A spokesman for fed-ex says the company plans to deliver 
all of its christmas packages before the holiday. The sudden change 
in weather has caught a lot of people by surprise. It's changing. 
I mean, the beginning of December looks like summer out here. And 
then, all of a sudden, it's snowing. I don't know what the problem 
is. If it was snow, it would be great, but ice, we don't want, you 
know? This isn't pretty. It's not covering the trees and the grass 
and all that, so it's not all that pretty.
