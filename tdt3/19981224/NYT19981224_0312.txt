The New York Times said in an editorial for Friday, Dec. 25: If you 
have ever fallen in love, you know what it means to live in a land 
where all the songs are suddenly true. There are times when Christmas 
is like that, too. Not at first, of course, not when Thanksgiving 
is still a week away, and the outside thermometer sticks at 60 and 
the first Christmas catalog is already months old. Not when you think 
about the shopping left to do and, worse, the wrapping. When the season 
has barely begun and you see a late-night clip of George Bailey running 
the length of Bedford Falls, overcome with joy, he seems a little 
more keyed up than he did the year before, and you can't help thinking, 
``That won't last.'' The same goes for Alastair Sim and his bed-curtains. 
You realize one afternoon that you've never heard anyone say ``Bah, 
humbug!'' and really mean it. But all the reluctance in the world 
never slowed this season down, just as all the childlike wishing in 
the world never sped it up. In the department stores you walk through 
a nimbus of sample perfumes, and some of it sticks to you. The same 
goes for the spirit of Christmas. In early December, it is just a 
phrase. Then one day, on one of the many corners of Rockefeller Center, 
an elementary-school class marches in place, counting off boot-camp 
fashion, when ``Jingle Bells'' breaks out among them. It sounds as 
insurrectionary as the ``Marseillaise.'' It is impossible not to smile 
and let a little of that rendition of ``Jingle Bells'' cling to you. 
Some people love every bit of Christmas, right up to and including 
Burl Ives singing ``Holly Jolly Christmas.'' Plenty of people can 
get no further than the Pretenders' wonderful version of ``Have Yourself 
a Merry Little Christmas'' or Berlioz's ``L'Enfance du Christ.'' But 
even in a warm year such as this one has been, there is usually too 
much Christmas for just one day. To a child, an Advent calendar is 
only a ticking clock, but to adults with the cruel frost of King Wenceslaus 
playing in their heads, it is a way of pacing the holidays, giving 
themselves a chance to measure up gradually to something they remember 
from a time when they were children. Somehow Christmas catches up 
with each of us sooner or later _ perhaps in the satisfaction of finding 
just the right present, perhaps on Christmas Eve when again the decree 
goes out from Caesar Augustus, perhaps on the morning _ here at last 
_ when the tree is knee-deep in torn wrapping paper and discarded 
ribbon, and perhaps not at all until we find a way to make this holiday 
bear upon someone who does not expect it. But one by one the Christmas 
songs become true again _ and if only for a moment, then that is the 
moment that matters.
