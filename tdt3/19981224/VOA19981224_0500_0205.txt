Belgium's highest court has found former NATO Secretary General, Veli 
Clause guilty of corruption charges. And has given him a three-year 
suspended jail sentence. John Frazier in Brussels reports Clause was 
among a number of senior Belgian politicians and officials who were 
convicted in what some call Belgium's trial of the century. The charges 
date back to the late 1980s when Belgium's Dutch and French speaking 
socialist parties were paid bribes in return for awarding two defense 
contracts. Each of which was worth hundreds of millions of dollars. 
Both socialist parties were members of the country's coalition government. 
At the time, Clause was economics minister and he played an important 
role in approving both of the contracts. Clause always denied the 
charges, but he was forced to resign from his top NATO job in October 
of 1995 when it became clear that he faced prosecution. Other politicians 
convicted include the former head of Belgium's French-speaking socialist 
party, Guy Spitals. Who went on to become president of the French 
region of Belgium. And there was a guilty verdict for former Belgian 
Defense Minister, Guy Cohen. Who went on to become deputy prime minister 
until he, too, was forced to resign from political life. French businessman, 
Serge Dusso, who paid one of the bribes to the Belgian politicians 
was also convicted. John Frazier for VOA News, Brussels.
