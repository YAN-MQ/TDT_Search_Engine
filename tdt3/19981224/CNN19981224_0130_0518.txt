This is meteorologist Valerie Voss with your "CNN Headline News Weather" 
forecast for Thursday, Christmas eve. A frontal system will be pushing 
into the northwestern United States, with rain and snow across the 
southeast. Not too much change in the weather -- rather cold and icy 
from Texas up into the carolinas and Virginia. The rest of the country 
will be quiet but cold, as well. Thursday's highs -- single numbers 
and teens through the north central part of the country. The warmest 
air, across the extreme south -- we're talking southern florida, where 
we'll see 60s and 70s. Looking ahead to Friday, Christmas day, icy 
problems will continue through the mid-atlantic, with rain and snow 
in the northwest. On Saturday, snow around the Great Lakes, more rain 
and snow for the northwest. And on Sunday, temperatures will moderate 
in the southern half of the country. We'll look for 50s and 60s, 70s 
in south Texas. In fact, just 20s and 30s across the north, with most 
of the rain and snow confined to the north, as well. Don't forget, 
four-day forecasts, more than 7,200 cities, on CNN interactive. The 
address -- CNN.com.
