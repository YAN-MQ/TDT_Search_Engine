Vice President Gore says he does not believe President Clinton will 
admit to lying under oath. That admission is a condition of censure. 
Two senators tell CNN after judge rehnquist is sworn in and the trial 
has begun majority leader Trent Lott will confront senior senators, 
they will advice him on matters, which could mean helping to broker 
a deal. It seems to me that should there be a censure resolution, 
it would have to be more than a scolding. Tom DeLay issued a statement 
weighing in on the Senate deliberations trying to short circuit any 
rush to censure with this advice. Delay according to a spokesman was 
refering to the entire record of the impeachment investigation not 
one specific part. The record includes material concerning Kathleen 
Willey and other women besides Monica Lewinsky. That was part of the 
documents the house Judiciary committee's chief investigator David 
shippers said could not be publically disclosed. Senators, republican 
and democratic alike expressed views that DeLay's comments were not 
welcome. Patrick Leahy said no one else will decide it for us. More 
republicans are operating on the assumption the votes necessary to 
remove the president will not be there. So now, much of the focus 
is on what it will take to attract the 51 votes necessary to dismiss 
the case. Sources from both parties say there have been no negotiations 
over specifics one democratic senator told CNN while an acceptable 
censure deal will have to be tough, it will also have to be acceptable 
to president clinton. You don't want to go through this, he said, 
and then have the president veto the resolution. Sources say there 
are internal debateds in both parties about how long a Senate trial 
should go before any deal is attempted. Some republicans want to stretch 
this out to further damage the president. Some democrats want to stretch 
it out so the republicans can do political damage to themselves. But 
the prevailing view said one Senate leader is to get this over with 
as soon as possible. Bob Franken, CNN, Capitol Hill.
