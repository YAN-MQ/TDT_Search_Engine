Walter A. Zelman, a self-described health policy wonk and a sometime 
composer of political-parody ditties, wrote a song about Jerry Brown, 
the former California governor, who was running for president against 
Bill Clinton in 1992. ``He's Jerry Brown and he's always a-changin','' 
Zelman sang, borrowing, presciently as it turned out, from ``The Times 
They Are A-Changin,' '' the Bob Dylan anthem. Last month, in his latest 
metamorphosis, Brown was elected mayor of Oakland. Wally Zelman, too, 
is no slouch at switching careers. He went from consumer activist, 
battling for adoption of a Canadian-style health insurance system 
in the 1970s, to market-based managed-care advocate in the early 1990s, 
as a deputy state insurance commissioner of California and later, 
an official on the Hillary Rodham Clinton health policy team. Recently, 
after a stint as an author and academic lecturer, he was appointed 
president and chief executive of the California Association of Health 
Plans, a managed-care lobby, a move that some former colleagues viewed 
as defecting to the enemy. While there is nothing new about the revolving 
door that spins government regulatory officials into industry and 
retreads prosecutors as criminal-defense lawyers, Zelman's switch 
created a special stir in the intense world of health policy. ``I'm 
really glad he came over to our side,'' said Charles N. Kahn III, 
president of the Health Industry Association of America, a national 
trade group that includes several California health maintenance organizations. 
``I think it was a terrific hire,'' added Karen Ignagni, president 
of the American Association of Health Plans, a group of HMOs and other 
managed-care companies. ``He's smart, he's hard-working, and he has 
a very high degree of integrity.'' Perhaps not surprisingly, insurance 
industry critics took a harsher tack. ``He's sort of a man without 
a country,'' said Harvey Rosenfield, president of the California-based 
Foundation for Taxpayer and Consumer Rights, which favors tighter 
government regulation of HMOs. ``I would rather be dog catcher than 
represent the HMOs. He's got a thankless task trying to protect an 
industry that is doomed.'' Zelman, who celebrated his 55th birthday 
last Sunday, was born in Long Island City, N.Y. He was student body 
president at the Little Red Schoolhouse, a private school in Manhattan's 
Greenwich Village; graduated from the University of Michigan in 1965; 
studied for a year at the London School of Economics, and earned a 
PhD in political science from the University of California at Los 
Angeles. His doctoral thesis was on the impact of Vietnam War critics 
on the United States Senate. He let his red hair grow bushy and taught 
at several California colleges. In the 1970s, he campaigned for Tom 
Hayden, the antiwar protester and a defendant in the Chicago Seven 
trial, in his unsuccessful bid to become a United States senator. 
From the late 70s to the late 80s, Zelman was executive director of 
California Common Cause. At its parties, he handed out ``Flak Catcher 
Awards'' to consumer activists who stood firm when attacked by business 
lobbyists. He also played the piano and sang ``The F. and I. Blues,'' 
his tune that poked fun at bankers on the finance and insurance committee 
of the legislature. After helping Rosenfield win voter approval of 
Proposition 103, which made insurance commissioner an elective office 
in California, Zelman ran for the job. He was defeated by John Garamendi, 
who appointed him deputy in charge of consumer affairs. After two 
years with Garamendi, he went to Washington in 1993 to work on the 
Clinton health plan. Then he worked briefly at a federal health policy 
agency, wrote two books and lectured under the auspices of the Harvard 
University School of Public Health. He returned to California last 
summer. ``I decided I wanted something more activist, more directly 
involved in policy,'' he said. He declined to discuss his new salary, 
which is not public information because he is not a registered lobbyist. 
Zelman said he learned a lot about health care economics in Washington, 
but as the Clinton plan went down to defeat, he, too, was rejected. 
``The political people saw me as a health policy person,'' he said. 
``The health policy people saw me as a politico.'' Zelman, who still 
calls himself a ``liberal policy wonk,'' jokes that his hair has turned 
``HMO gray.'' But he says he is working for consumers at the California 
Association of Health Plans. ``Most people might view my new job as 
a great leap,'' he said. ``But a lot of people don't understand the 
economics of health care and the value that managed care has brought 
in terms of lower health care costs, and the potential that it has 
to improve health care quality.'' Industry critics bridle at this 
version of his job description. Harry Snyder, director of the West 
Coast office of the Consumers Union, called Zelman's portrayal of 
his role ``naive.'' And Beth Capell, a lobbyist in Sacramento for 
unions and consumer groups, labeled a legislative proposal backed 
by Zelman for giving HMO members a chance to challenge their treatment 
``completely inadequate and a farce.'' She contended that the HMOs 
would have too much influence over the process. Others in the field 
took a more nuanced view. Drew Altman, president of the Kaiser Family 
Foundation, which supports health policy research, said Zelman was 
``a strong consumer person'' whose appointment ``signals an industry 
that knows it has an image problem.'' Altman added, ``He will probably 
try and do a little more than the industry wants and probably not 
as much as the consumer groups want.'' Perhaps the ultimate pat on 
the back came from Hayden, the once fiery left-wing radical who has 
settled into the political system as a liberal Democratic state senator 
from Los Angeles. ``Wally's role will be to try to support reforms 
that the HMOs can live with,'' Hayden said. ``He won't be able to 
stop reforms. He'll be right in the mix of it.''
