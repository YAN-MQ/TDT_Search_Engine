President Clinton is wrapping up his holiday shopping. He stopped 
at the peace corps store in Washington today, where he bought a Gift 
for the first lady. The White House isn't saying what Mr. Clinton 
bought, but store workers say he looked at several items, including 
earrings and some pottery. The president was greeted by a cheering 
crowd when he emerged from the store. When asked if his holiday shopping 
is complete, Mr. Clinton replied, "not quite."
