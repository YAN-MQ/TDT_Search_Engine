And this follow-up to a story we ran Tuesday about rising anti-Semitism 
in Russia and one Jewish family's fears for the future. Yesterday, 
Russia's Communist Party leader, Gennady Zyuganov, accused Jews of 
bringing on the extinction of Russia's people and causing the country's 
economic woes. Zyuganov also suggested that Russia's Jewish community 
condemn Zionism. And today, a group monitoring United Nations activities 
appealed to the UN human rights commissioner to speak out against 
Russian anti-Semitism, citing recent statements like Zyuganov's. UN 
watch said if the Russian Communist Party and the state Duma refuse 
to curb such hate mongering, the task for censure falls to the rest 
of the world.
