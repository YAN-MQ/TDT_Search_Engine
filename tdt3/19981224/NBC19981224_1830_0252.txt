Despite the hazards out there tonight, there is some good news from 
the road. New statistics on highway fatalities in this country. They're 
down. NBC's Robert Hager has some reasons why. a dramatic decline. 
New figures out tonight show the toll will be down for the second 
year in a row. At well under 42,000, the lowest in a half dozen years. 
And considering that more people are driving than ever, the rate of 
deaths, could be the lowest in history. A major reason why? The national 
safety council's Chuck Hurley. For the first time in five years, we 
are seeing significant increases in safety belt use and child safety 
seats. After highly publicized campaigns to buckle up and police roadblocks 
over holiday weekends, like Thanksgiving, seat belt use suddenly jumps 
from 61% at the end of last year, to nearly 70% now. 16 million more 
people, fastening belts this year. And behind the numbers, people. 
Like Jana house in Louisiana, who heard a plea to buckle up, on the 
car radio. One of my sisters did not have her seat belt on yet, and 
I made her put it on after the announcement. Less than ten minutes 
later they were in an accident. The seat belts did save our lives 
that day. And in California, officer Lou avilas, who trails an unbelted 
driver, pulls him over just after he's suddenly buckled up. You weren't 
wearing your seat belt. You didn't have your seat belt on. Can I see 
your license and registration please? This driver gets a warning, 
but California tickets many. And besides tougher enforcement of seat 
belt use, there's also a continued decline in drunk driving. So it's 
both that help push the death toll down this year and last and reverse 
a previous four-year trend of small increases. But the news isn't 
all good. The number killed in accidents with trucks is up. And so 
may be the number killed on highways where speed limits have been 
raised, some in excess of 75. But otherwise, traffic safety advocates 
are encouraged. California, with tough enforcement, now has the highest 
seat belt use in the nation and the lowest death rate. A message for 
others -- We could save, literally, 10,000 lives a year in this country 
by achieving the excellence of California. The numbers are getting 
better. But during this holiday season, when there could be a death 
every 13 minutes on crowded roads, the ride, for too many, is still 
deadly. Robert Hager, NBC news, Washington.
