NATIONAL FORECAST The unseasonable chill that has gripped the West 
and northern Plains will begin retreating this Christmas Day as westerly 
winds transport milder air eastward from the Pacific. After a frosty 
morning in many locations, ample sunshine will boost daytime readings 
into the 50s and 60s across southern California by afternoon. Farther 
north, a fast flow of air from the Pacific Ocean will direct a plume 
of moisture into far northern California and the Northwest. Heavy 
rain will dampen coastal areas, especially toward evening as a warm 
front crosses the region. Farther inland, freezing rain will glaze 
portions of the Columbia River Valley as the moist Pacific air begins 
to dislodge weighty cold air hovering near the ground. In addition, 
heavy snow will fall in many of the west-facing mountain ranges of 
the Northwest and northern Rockies, as the moist air is further lifted 
and cooled. Expansive high pressure that is splayed across the lower 
Mississippi Valley and northern Middle Atlantic States will promote 
dry weather in much of the East on Friday. An exception will be near 
the southeast coast, where low pressure draws moist air inland. Intermittent 
chilly rain will occur from south Georgia to eastern North Carolina. 
Meanwhile, pockets of ice will fall further inland where surface temperatures 
hover near freezing. In the wake of Thursday's early snow, abundant 
sunshine and light winds will return to the northeast seaboard. Elsewhere, 
cool air crossing the warmer waters of the Great Lakes will induce 
a few snow showers over upstate New York and northern Michigan. Focus: 
Gelid Bakersfield A push of polar air into California has produced 
subfreezing temperatures across the southern San Joaquin Valley, damaging 
much of this year's citrus crop. At Bakersfield, near the southern 
end of the Central Valley, readings fell to 19 degrees on Wednesday 
morning, tying the lowest temperature ever recorded. On seven other 
occasions in the past 70 years, the mercury at the Bakersfield airport 
has reached this level. Light winds and clear skies on the past several 
nights have contributed to the unusual chill. The cold snap will end 
this weekend as milder air from the Pacific returns.
