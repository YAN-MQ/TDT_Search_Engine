Brushing aside NATO and U.S. warnings, Serb tanks and troops struck 
against a Kosovo Albanian rebel stronghold Thursday, triggering what 
both sides called fierce fighting and dealing a blow to U.S.-led peace 
efforts. Ethnic Albanians said at least one person was killed and 
several others injured in what they termed a major Serb offensive. 
Serb officials said the ``limited'' operation was launched in search 
of killers of a Serb policeman slain in the area Monday. In a statement 
distributed Thursday night by the government's Tanjug news agency, 
Serb police said they encountered ``fierce fire'' but ``liquidated''

to clamp down against the terrorists,'' referring to the Kosovo Liberation 
Army. The KLA, 5th graf pvs
