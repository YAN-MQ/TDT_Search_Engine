Fifteen years ago, while taking my driving test, I bashed my car into 
the vehicle behind me. Actually, it wasn't so much a bash as a nudge, 
but the DMV guy was not amused. He flunked me. Traumatized at the 
time, I now realize that untold American drivers can be as klutzy 
as I was then. They prove it every time their cars bang into walls 
or mangle their garden tools while pulling in and out of their garages. 
Such accidents bruise more than egos; they can cost dearly in bumper 
repairs. The Insurance Institute for Highway Safety in Arlington, 
Va., this year subjected dozens of American- and Japanese-made vehicles 
to four kinds of collisions at 5 miles an hour, bumping the front 
of the vehicle into both flat and angled barriers and the rear into 
a flat barrier and a pole. Total damage ranged from $134 for a 1998 
Volkswagen New Beetle to $6,086 for a Lexus LS 400. Currently, California 
and Hawaii require car makers to inform consumers about the sturdiness 
of their bumpers. But neither state sets standards, and federal law 
requires only that a bumper be strong enough to prevent damage to 
the rest of the car _ but not to itself _ in crashes against stationary 
objects at 2.5 miles an hour. No one I know makes enough money to 
be frivolous with his bumper. And though a tennis ball dangling on 
a string from the garage ceiling has proved effective for many as 
a guidepost of when to stop, who really wants such an eyesore in the 
garage? Well, help is at hand for us bumper bashers and wall whackers, 
in the form of the Park Zone, a battery-powered device that gives 
a driver visual warnings as the vehicle approaches physical obstructions, 
whether walls or wheelbarrows. ``Ten years ago, bumpers were pieces 
of protruding aluminum,'' said Charles Balsamo, chief executive of 
Exeter Technologies of New York, maker of the Park Zone. ``Today, 
they're part of the whole body of the car and aren't effective for 
low-speed impact. The garage environment is often overcrowded, and 
damage can be inflicted on other objects.'' Essentially, the Park 
Zone, which looks like a miniature traffic light, guides you into 
the proper parking position. As your car enters the garage, an ultrasonic 
sensor activates a green light. As you inch forward, a yellow light 
warns you to prepare to stop when you are nearing contact. Then a 
red light flashes, indicating that you must stop or the laws of physics 
will come into play. The Park Zone is easy to set up. Attach it at 
eye level on your garage wall, park your car in the desired spot, 
connect the coiled cord, press the activation button, and voila! The 
distance from wall to vehicle is programmed into the sensor. ``It's 
a pleasure,'' said Joseph Fimone of Juno Beach, Fla., who owns a Park 
Zone and whose own jury-rigged systems have let him down in the past. 
``I had a ball hanging from the ceiling that I used to bang my head 
on. Then I had a board, and I tripped on it.'' How well does the gadget 
work? Since I don't have a car, I coerced a friend, Bob Levitt of 
Brooklyn, into helping me with a test. Bob is passionate about his 
car, an emotion many people share. According to a November survey 
by MSN Car Point, Microsoft's automotive Web site, 65 percent of Americans 
think of their cars as members of their families; 1 out of 3 compare 
giving up their car to losing a dear friend. But Bob may have more 
reason than most to love his car. It is gorgeous _ an aqua 1966 Oldsmobile 
Delta that is roughly the size of Trenton, and he admits that he bought 
it partly to impress women. (So far, he tells me, it has attracted 
only ``middle-aged, toothless men who want to know if that's the original 
paint job.'') Even so, he is fanatic about its upkeep, and he parks 
it in a lot where spare tires line the walls, ``so when you bang into 
them, you hit the tire and don't injure your bumper.'' Bob confesses 
to more than one parking misadventure. ``One time, cruising into my 
parents' garage in Massachusetts, I got a little overzealous and took 
out a workbench,'' he recalled, with more than a trace of pride. ``I 
also managed to scrape and break wooden two-by-fours off the side, 
and I assaulted a garbage can.'' Clearly, Bob is a Park Zone candidate. 
We met one Saturday in midtown Manhattan, and after spending 35 minutes 
in search of an empty lot, we pulled into the bottom level of a garage 
at 50th Street and Eighth Avenue. I hopped out, propped the Park Zone 
against the wall, calibrated the distance by pressing the button, 
and leaned up next to it. ``Come on!'' I coaxed as he placed his foot 
on the gas. ``Closer! Closer!'' Bob inched the car forward, his eyes 
transfixed as the Park Zone light shifted from green to yellow to 
red. His gas guzzler's chrome-plated prow was a mere six inches away 
from my knees when he stopped. Happily, both it and they survived 
without a scratch. Frankly, we were impressed. ``It's a good thing 
for the elderly, who'll pay attention to it,'' Bob said, ``and because 
it's mindless, it's good for 16-year-olds, who usually bash into walls.'' 
Then I told him the price: $79.95, or $89.95 for the Platinum Park 
Zone, a silver-colored version featuring an alternating current adapter. 
He turned pale. ``That's dinner and a movie!'' he said. ``What's wrong 
with the hanging ball?'' With that, we made our way out the garage 
and headed down Ninth Avenue. No one commented on the impeccable bumper. 
But they loved the paint job.
