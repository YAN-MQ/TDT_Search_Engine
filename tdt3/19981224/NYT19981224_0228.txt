More than halfway into what they hope will be a nonstop journey around 
the world, the three crewmen of the ICO Global Challenge balloon were 
speeding across the Pacific Ocean toward the United States Thursday. 
Their immediate goal was to try to avoid a patch of weather that could 
force them to end their attempt. The balloonists _ Richard Branson 
and Per Lindstrand, both British, and Steve Fossett, an American _ 
had completed 12,500 miles of the flight by Thursday. They set out 
a week ago from Marrakesh, Morocco, and since then have crossed North 
Africa, Europe and Asia. Leaving Japan and heading out over the Pacific 
late Wednesday, the balloon entered the jet stream and quickly reached 
190 miles an hour. The balloonists need all the speed they can get 
to skirt a low-pressure trough about 1,000 miles away. The depression 
threatened to suck the balloon southward toward Hawaii, where wind 
patterns would not permit it to get back on course and where an ocean 
landing would be inevitable. But Mike Kendrick, the team's operations 
director in Uxbridge, England, said in a telephone interview that 
there was a good chance the balloon would get safely past the danger 
zone and arrive over Oregon late Christmas Day. After that, he said, 
the balloon should be able to cross the United States in about 24 
hours. ``Right now it looks as if we'll make landfall in Oregon, and 
then the balloon may track near Chicago,'' Kendrick said. ``After 
that, it's likely to fly over the Carolinas before heading out over 
the Atlantic.'' Although the balloon will be flying at or above 30,000 
feet over the United States, if skies are clear it may be visible 
from the ground as a small speck in daylight. The crew was looking 
forward to another milestone: breaking the balloon distance record, 
which is held by Fossett. Last August Fossett, who has made four previous 
round-the-world attempts on his own, traveled 14,232 miles from Argentina 
to a crash landing in the Coral Sea, breaking his own record. On the 
current trip, Fossett joined his onetime competitors, Branson and 
Lindstrand, and by midday Thursday they were within 2,000 miles of 
setting a new record. ``We'll be relieved to get over the United States,'' 
Kendrick said, ``because it's dry land and the weather should be safer.'' 
The ICO Global Challenge team has been deluged with inquiries about 
the flight. A spokesman said that in the first week the team's Internet 
site, http://www.icoglobal.com, had received more than 40 million 
``hits,'' or visits. In another development, news agencies reported 
that China had barred any future overflights by balloonists. Since 
balloon flights also are banned by Libya, Iraq, Iran and Russia, round-the-world 
flight attempts in the northern hemisphere may have been ruled out. 
Branson's team was given Chinese overflight permission in November, 
but last week, as his balloon was crossing into Tibet from Nepal, 
the Chinese government rescinded its permission and ordered him to 
land. After intense diplomatic efforts, however, the balloon was allowed 
to proceed.
