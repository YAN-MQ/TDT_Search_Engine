Leading Japanese financial institutions caught in a scandal involving 
payoffs to a self-confessed corporate racketeer also funneled millions 
of dollars to dozens of other gangsters, news reports said Thursday. 
Five companies _ Dai-Ichi Kangyo Bank Ltd. and brokerages Nomura Securities 
Co., Daiwa Securities Co., Nikko Securities Co. and the now-defunct 
Yamaichi Securities Co. _ paid a total of 1.1 billion yen (dlrs 9.5 
million) to 35 other ``sokaiya'' racketeers, national broadcaster 
NHK said, quoting the Tokyo Regional Tax Office. Public trust in Japan's 
financial firms plummeted last year following revelations that the 
five companies made almost dlrs 100 million in illegal payments and 
questionable loans to a single corporate extortionist, Ryuichi Koike. 
Dozens of executives resigned and were arrested in the Koike scandal. 
Koike has admitted to taking the payoffs. On Thursday, Japanese tax 
officials _ who have been investigating the companies' books in the 
wake of the scandal _ revealed that Koike was but one of several racketeers 
demanding hush money from Japan's top financial executives. Japan's 
sokaiya buy shares in companies and solicit cash payments by threatening 
to disrupt or make embarassing revelations at shareholder meetings. 
The practice has been rife in Japan for decades, but it is only recently 
that authorities have cracked down. The bribes revealed Thursday were 
reportedly made over a five year period up to March 31, 1997. The 
companies made the payments by funneling trading profits to the racketeers 
or by buying luxury goods, such as art-works or golf club memberships, 
from them at inflated prices. The tax bureau declined to reveal details 
of its probe. The investigation reportedly showed that Nomura paid 
370 million yen (dlrs 3.19 million) to nine other sokaiya; Daiwa paid 
70 million (dlrs 630,000) yen to five; Yamaichi paid 280 miilion yen 
(dlrs 2.4 million) to five; and Dai-Ichi Kangyo Bank paid 300 million 
yen (dlrs 2.59 milion) to 12. Tax officials on Thursday also ordered 
all of the financial institutions involved in the scandal _ aside 
from failed Yamaichi _ to pay a total of 900 million yen (dlrs 7.76 
million) in corporate taxes and penalties for hiding income, which 
included kickbacks to Koike. It was unclear what further legal action 
may be taken against the companies following Thursday's reports of 
payoffs to several corporate racketeers. The main figure behind the 
sokaiya scandal _ Koike _ has pleaded guilty to taking bribes of dlrs 
5.3 million from Nomura, Daiwa, Nikko and Yamaichi. He also has admitted 
taking hidden loans worth dlrs 91 million from Dai-Ichi Kangyo Bank, 
one of the world's largest. He is believed to have used the money 
to buy the shares needed to gain admission to the brokerages' annual 
shareholders' meetings.
