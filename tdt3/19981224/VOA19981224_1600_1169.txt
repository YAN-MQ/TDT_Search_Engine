In U.S. College basketball, top tanked Connecticut won its ninth straight 
game that is Wednesday night. Routing Fairfield 102 to 67. Elsewhere 
firth-ranked Maryland scored its most lopsided victory in team history. 
A 132 to 57 thumping of winless North Texas. The Terrapins are now 
12 and 1. In other games involving ranked teams, St. Louis upset number 
11 Kansas 78 to 64. Kansas shot only 36 percent and committed 24 turnovers. 
The Jayhawks fall to 8 and 3 on the season and Kansas coach, Roy Williams, 
admits his team is struggling. Right now people think we are a little 
wounded and perhaps we are, and like the sharks, you smell that blood 
it makes you want to go a little bit harder. But I do believe if we 
say, ah, we are young, or we are hurt, and all that stuff. I think 
that you make an excuse and I do not think we need to hide behind 
that. We did not play very well. Also Wednesday night, number 12, 
UCLA beat American University 66 to 56. Fourteenth-ranked Michigan 
State topped Alabama 75 to 58. And number 20 Arkansas defeated Wake 
Forest 75 to 59.
