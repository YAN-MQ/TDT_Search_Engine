State-run newspapers on Thursday said Iraqis will not be intimidated 
by U.S. threats of strikes to force Iraq to allow the resumption of 
U.N. weapons inspections. The weapons inspection teams now exist only 
``in the sick dreams entertained by America,'' the official al-Iraq 
newspaper said in a front page editorial. The U.N. Special Commission, 
or UNSCOM, began work in 1991 to dismantle Iraq's programs to build 
weapons of mass destruction. It withdrew its inspectors Dec. 16, saying 
Iraq was scuttling their work. That night, the United States and Britain 
launched airstrikes, and Iraq this week said UNSCOM will never be 
allowed to resume its work. ``To say ... UNSCOM still exists ... is 
like chasing a mirage,'' the official al-Iraq newspaper said in a 
front-page editorial. ``The vicious role of this American and British 
commission is over and their treacherous aggression was the final 
bullet,'' the paper said. Until UNSCOM certifies that Iraq has dismantled 
its programs to build nuclear, chemical and biological weapons along 
with long-range missiles, U.N. trade sanctions imposed on Iraq for 
its 1990 invasion of Kuwait cannot be lifted. Iraq says more than 
40 civilians and 62 soldiers were killed in the U.S.-British strikes 
on some 100 targets described as military and defense related sites. 
Iraq says civilian sites also were hit. The Babil newspaper, owned 
by President Saddam Hussein's eldest son Odai, warned that the United 
States and Britain might use force again. ``The possibility of military 
action which they wave as a means of psychological terror will not 
be more than what our people and military units have already seen,'' 
the paper said. The government has kept the military on alert. Road 
junctions, strategic sites and main roundabouts in Baghdad are still 
patrolled by militia of the ruling Baath party, a move taken just 
before the airstrikes began. Air defenses remain active. Iraq has 
not taken foreign reporters to military sites hit during the four-day 
bombing. But the impact of the bombing on civilian life is evident. 
Telephone lines between Baghdad and the rest of the country remain 
cut. The popular Shebab Channel, or youth television run by Odai, 
is off the air. Iraq's satellite television channel also no longer 
broadcasts. Radio and television stations that can still transmit 
are not clear and apparently only cover Baghdad and the surrounding 
areas. Iraq has repaired some of the damage in residential areas. 
Water and sewage pipes hit in the Karada neighborhood have been fixed. 
Reconstruction teams, however, have not yet been seen at the former 
defense ministry complex, which housed the military intelligence, 
or the headquarters of the General Security Directorate. Both were 
badly damaged. On Wednesday, Iraq ordered the U.N. observer force 
that monitors the Iraq-Kuwait border to cancel a scheduled flight 
to Iraq. U.N. officials said they hoped the move was temporary.
