In the Washington suburb of Gaithersburg, Md., far from the intrigue 
of the capital and even farther from the North Pole, employees of 
the Consumer Product Safety Commission test toys of every description 
for dangers and defects. Bob Hundemer, an engineering technician, 
has tested toys at the agency for two decades. He has cultivated a 
scrupulous and unforgiving eye for potential hazards and quickly detects 
whether a toy is up to standard _ whether it is safe as well as inviting 
beneath the Christmas tree. ``This is a killer,'' Hundemer said, pointing 
to a fluorescent yellow rattle with an unusually thin stem and tiny 
ball at the tip. ``The end could get jammed in a baby's mouth so easily 
and cause choking.'' Hundemer's office is a 5-year-old's paradise. 
A bookcase overflowing with brightly colored tops, dolls, toy cars, 
and jacks-in-the-box covers the back wall. A sign reading ``Caution: 
Adults at Play'' adorns his door. Robert Garrett, the acting director 
of the engineering laboratory, said: ``After years in the private 
sector, I realized that I could get a job with the government doing 
about the same thing. I thought I'd died and gone to heaven.'' At 
the annual Toy Fair in February, giant manufacturers like Mattel and 
Hasbro, as well as small toy companies from around the country, gather 
in New York City to display their wares. Representatives from the 
CPSC attend the show and examine all the new toys. They discuss potential 
problems with the manufacturers and then work with them to insure 
that potential hazards are eliminated. ``The big retailers don't want 
to recall their products,'' said Kathleen Begala, the CPSC director 
of public affairs. ``With mailings and bad press, it's a very expensive 
process for them, and so there is an incentive to cooperate with us.'' 
Mindful that injuries kill more children than any illnesses, the CPSC, 
which has requested just over $57 million for its 2000 budget, performs 
four tests on toys it reviews. One, the template test, examines small 
parts of a toy that could catch in a child's throat and affect breathing. 
Hundemer uses a truncated cylinder that represents an average child's 
mouth and throat. Any piece of a toy that fits into the cylinder is 
considered dangerous. Another, the sharp-edge test, uses a special 
tape to indicate whether any side of an object could cut the skin. 
The force test determines how easily parts of stuffed animals, like 
eyes and noses, can be removed from the toy. Hundemer users an instrument 
that resembles pliers to grasp the eye of a stuffed toy, for example, 
and applies 15 pounds of pressure, about the strength of a 2-year-old. 
He tries to rip off the part for about 20 seconds. In the impact test, 
a toy is dropped four and a half feet to test durability. ``We use 
something pretty cheap,'' Hundemer said. ``It's called gravity.'' 
If pieces of the toy break off, and the shards of plastic fail the 
template test, the toy is considered not safe. The CPSC officially 
approves toys that survive the tests. Like veterans telling war stories, 
Ms. Begala and Hundemer recalled some of the most troublesome toys. 
They remembered the Cabbage Patch doll accused of ``eating'' a child's 
hair, the Chinese slap bracelets made with cloth and sharp metal that 
could cut a child and Woody, the cowboy with plastic spurs that had 
sharp edges and a small plastic badge.
