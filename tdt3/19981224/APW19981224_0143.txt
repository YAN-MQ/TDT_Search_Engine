Three tourists who refused to stand when the Kenyan national anthem 
was played in the Kenya Cinema were ejected from the theater, the 
customer service manager said Thursday. In all movie theaters in Kenya, 
a message is flashed on the screen before the film informing the audience 
that standing is mandatory when the anthem is played. ``It is not 
a case of they did not know,'' said manager David Mwaura. Mwaura said 
the German and two Americans who had intended to see ``Antz'' Wednesday 
were seen sitting during the playing of the anthem by the hall manager 
who approached them and told them to leave. Once outside, Mwaura said, 
the tourists tried to argue, but when the hall manager told them he 
would summon the police, they left. The tourists' names were not available. 
Under Kenyan law, everyone is required to stand wherever the national 
anthem is played.
