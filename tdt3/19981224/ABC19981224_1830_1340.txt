For our regular report about "cutting edge" technology tonight, making 
that everyday technology we use more efficient. And that means less 
expensive. Almost all technology requires some kind of power source 
to operate. The problem is some things use power even when you're 
not using them. ABC's Lisa Stark reports, now there is a way to fix 
that. It's lights out at the schardt household, but while the family 
has called it quits for the night, their electric meter has not. It 
continues to show a lot of energy is being used while the family sleeps. 
And it's not just the refrigerator drawing power. It is the coffeemaker, 
cordless phone, the silent television, and VCR, even the alarm system 
and the doorbell. All using Watts of energy in stand-by mode. Stand-by 
power is essentially invisible, you do not know you're using it. Most 
people do not realize when the TV is sitting in the off position, 
it is actually using some energy. Inside TVs and VCRs the circuitry 
runs all the time to pick up the signal from the remote and to maintain 
the clock and channel settings. It's estimated Americans spend $3.5 
billion a year just to pay for stand-by power, generating the energy 
needed for this power produces the same amount of pollution as 7 million 
cars a year. When you add it up, it's a real impact, both in terms 
of global warming, air pollution levels and costs to the consumers. 
For years, no one thought much about this wasted energy, but now sony 
and other manufacturers are redesigning TVs and VCRs to use less power 
when the unit is off. For sony, the solution was simple. It basically 
is two power supplies, one that's on all the time, and one that's 
only on when the customer is choosing to watch TV. By putting in a 
separate power supply, sony managed to cut the stand-by electricity 
use on its television sets from 5 to 13 Watts an hour, to less than 
one Watt an hour. Nationwide, the energy savings on TV and VCRs alone 
could be $500 million a Year. The EPA has already worked to reduce 
stand-by power in computers, it will next take aim at all that stereo 
gear and there's plenty to target after that. Lisa Stark, ABC News, 
Washington.
