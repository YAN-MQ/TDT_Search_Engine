Angola's Unita rebels have renewed their attack on a strategic town 
in the central part of the country. The rebels shelled the town of 
Kyoto overnight and into Thursday morning. A catholic radio station 
in Angola says one person was wounded in the latest attack adding 
to its report of Wednesday's casualty toll, 26 killed and 24 wounded. 
The United Nations says as many as 100,000 people have fled their 
villages around Kyoto this month.
