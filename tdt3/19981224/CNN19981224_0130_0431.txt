The state department has ordered three Cuban diplomats at the United 
Nations to leave the United States for spying. The Cuban mission to 
the U.N. was given 24 hours to argue against the expulsion, but they 
didn't respond. The diplomats allegedly tried to get information on 
military bases, and infiltrate a group that opposes Cuban President 
Fidel Castro. They have until Tuesday to leave.
