What's in a name? Well, for one man, it could mean the successful 
resurrection of a classic brand of motorcycle. Don Knapp has the story. 
Power, noise, chrome, leather. These prototype bikes deliver that, 
and promise something you wouldn't ordinarily expect on a brand-new 
motorcycle -- a very old American tradition. The Indian brand dates 
back nearly 100 years. It stood for heavyweight powerful cruisers, 
adored as much for style as performance. The original manufacturer 
went out of business in the '50s, and for 40 years, court battles 
raged over use of the brand name. In the end, Murray Smith won the 
battles and the label. His new Indian motorcycle will sell for about 
$24,000. With the baby boomers now approaching their 50s and beyond, 
they do have that discretionary income and are looking more towards 
the art of motorcycling. California motorcycle company built the prototypes. 
The response has been phenomenal. My phone has been Ringing off the 
hook. It's not just standard motorcycle components that buyers are 
after, but classic cosmetics. Fender lights that light up. You can 
see it really nice at night. This is the Indian head, all cast in 
aluminum, and then polished in chrome. All steel. No aluminum. No 
fiberglass. It gives you a longer wheelbase. It gives you a smoother 
ride. These motorcycles are meant to get on, drive up to San Francisco, 
have dinner, and ride back home. The first new Indians will be on 
the road in January. The company says it will build 1,000 next year 
and 25,000 by the year 2001. There is nothing about this 80-cubic-inch, 
70-horsepower modern motorcycle that resembles the 1953 Indian, except 
its appearance and the nameplate. And the owners spent $17 million 
for the nameplate, and they expect it to sell. Don Knapp, CNN, Gilroy, 
California.
