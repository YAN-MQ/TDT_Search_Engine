In a holiday radio address to the country's troubled pig farmers, 
Agriculture Secretary Dan Glickman announced steps Thursday to slow 
the slide in hog prices and offered the farmers hope for easier credit. 
Glickman said the Agriculture Department would temporarily stop lending 
money for construction of new pork-production plants. ``Because the 
crux of the problem is oversupply, we want to stop any government 
action that could exacerbate the situation,'' he said. Glickman also 
said the department hoped to ``nail down in the next few days'' actions 
to make it easier for farmers ``whose long-term outlook is positive'' 
to get credit. He encouraged farmers to be more aggressive in applying 
for the department's loan-guarantee programs. The secretary's announcement 
coincided with the bleakest winter in memory for many hog farmers. 
A 250-pound hog that fetched $118 a year ago brings about $45 today, 
a five-decade low, and many farmers face bankruptcy in 1999 if the 
trend is not reversed. Glickman also announced that his department's 
inspection branch would speed a program to eliminate up to 1.7 million 
hogs that may be carrying the pseudo-rabies virus. Though the virus 
does not affect humans, it is fatal to dogs, cats and other domestic 
animals. The ability to certify hogs as virus-free through the eradication 
program would open new foreign markets to U.S. pork products, the 
secretary said. ``For the longer term,'' Glickman said, ``we are taking 
a hard look to determine whether prices are truly competitive and 
whether producers are being treated fairly.'' Though pig farmers are 
making far less money than they were a year or two ago, shoppers are 
not paying less at the supermarket. In trying to explain that contradiction, 
some retailers have said they are reluctant to lower prices now for 
fear they would incur shoppers' resentment if they had to raise them 
sharply in the future. Sen. Charles E. Grassley, a Republican from 
Iowa, the nation's leading pork-producing state, said he welcomed 
an investigation of industry prices. The secretary's remarks also 
were greeted warmly by the American Farm Bureau Federation and the 
National Pork Producers Council, whose president, Donna Reifschneider, 
called the official's actions ``a positive first step.'' The Agriculture 
Department has been trying for months to reduce the supply of pork, 
by encouraging federal agencies to buy more and by increasing exports, 
both through regular commercial channels and through food-aid programs. 
``In the spirit of the season, I'm reminded of the movie `It's a Wonderful 
Life,' when Jimmy Stewart called on all the folks in his town to not 
panic, to come together,'' Glickman said. Exports, as measured in 
volume, are up 19 percent this year and have more than doubled since 
1992, Glickman said, and domestic consumption remains healthy. But 
U.S. hog farmers have been victimized, in a sense, by their own efficiency. 
There are far fewer of them today than 40 or 50 years ago, yet this 
year they have produced a record 19 billion pounds of pork.
