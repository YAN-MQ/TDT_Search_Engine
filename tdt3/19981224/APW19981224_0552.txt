An apology is not enough for the death of a Lebanese women and six 
of her children killed in an Israeli air raid on eastern Lebanon, 
the Egyptian foreign minister said Thursday. Amr Moussa also called 
on Israel to respect international laws that forbid attacking civilian 
targets. A Lebanese woman and six of her seven children were killed 
Tuesday during an Israeli bombing raid on the eastern Lebanese village 
of Nabi Sheet. The woman's husband and an 11-year-old son were wounded 
in the attack. The Israeli army later expressed regret for the loss 
of civilian lives, saying its jets struck a civilian target by mistake 
while trying to hit a guerrilla training facility and broadcast station. 
``Egypt condemns the killing and attacks against civilians, and an 
apology is not enough,'' Moussa told reporters Thursday. Lebanese 
guerrillas retaliated Wednesday by showering northern Israeli settlements 
with Katyusha rockets, injuring 16 Israelis _ 15 suffered from shock, 
and one suffered moderate wounds. ``Israel should respect international 
laws and charters that prohibit attacks on civilians,'' Moussa said, 
adding that Lebanese and Palestinian people were as human as Israelis. 
The latest violence threatened to undermine a U.S.-brokered ceasefire 
agreement reached in April 1996 to spare civilians.
