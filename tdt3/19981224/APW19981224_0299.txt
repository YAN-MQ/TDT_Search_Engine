A newspaper published the first photos of Russia's most advanced fighter 
jet, but reported Wednesday that the country can't afford to mass 
produce the plane any time soon. Almost everything about the MFI _ 
the Russian acronym for the Multi-Functional Fighter _ has been kept 
under wraps since development began in late 1980s. But Nezavisimaya 
Gazeta published a front-page photo Thursday of the MFI, known as 
``Project 1.42'' in the West. The newspaper claimed the MFI can match 
the most advanced U.S. fighter, the F-22 Raptor, and has a ``thrust 
vectoring'' system that allows the plane to make sharper turns than 
current fighters. The single-seat, twin-engined MFI is designed to 
fly faster than Mach 2, and can be equipped with custom-designed air-to-air 
and air-to-ground missiles. Like its U.S. counterpart, the new aircraft 
has stealth capabilities, relying on composite materials and a special 
shape to avoid detection by enemy radars. But unlike the F-22, which 
made its maiden flight last year, the Russian fighter has yet to fly. 
The plane's development has been slowed by severe funding shortages. 
``The MFI's faces a difficult future,'' the newspaper said. ``The 
current economic situation won't allow its production in the foreseeable 
future since one plane is expected to cost around dlrs 70 million.'' 
The Russian air force doesn't have enough money to maintain its current 
fleet or properly train pilots. Without citing sources, the newspaper 
claimed that China has offered to help finance development, but only 
if it can buy the aircraft and maybe even the technology. Russian 
leaders recently raised the prospect of a strategic partnership including 
Russia, China and India to counter perceived U.S. domination in global 
affairs. China has evolved into a key customer for the Russia's ailing 
weapons industries, purchasing combat jets, missiles and navy ships.
