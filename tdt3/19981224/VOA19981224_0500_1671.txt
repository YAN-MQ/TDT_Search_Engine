Ho, ho, ho, it is Christmas Eve, it is Thursday, December 24, 1998. 
It was a Christmas Eve 30 years ago when Americans saw not only looked 
for Santa streaking through the sky, but they were also kept an eye 
for the Apollo VIII space craft which was in orbit around the moon 
at that time. In a television broadcast from their spacecraft, as 
it whizzed 112 kilometers above the lunar surface, astronauts Frank 
Borman, William Andard, and James Lovell, Jr. read a portion of the 
book of Genesis from the bible and Frank Borman also sent this greeting 
back to earth. From the crew of Apollo VIII we close with goodnight, 
good luck, a Merry Christmas, and God bless all of you, all of you 
on the good earth. The main goal of that mission 30 years ago was 
to get close up photos of the moon, especially of areas that might 
be suitable for future man's landing and that landing took place less 
than a year later in July 1969. It was 60 years ago today in 1938, 
representatives of the United States and the other nations in the 
Western Hemisphere signed a declaration of Lima. This document proclaimed 
their solidarity against aggression in the hemisphere by European 
dictators. Signed in the Peruvian capital on the eve of World War 
II, the declaration supported joint action by the American republics 
to meet the possible threat posed by Nazi Germany and fascist Italy. 
The agreement said that the foreign ministers of the Western Hemisphere 
would meet in any one of them, if any one of them called for a conference 
to discuss an outside threat. The chief of the U.S. delegation assured 
the conference that President Roosevelt solidly supported it. Well,
