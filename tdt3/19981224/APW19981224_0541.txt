Brushing aside NATO and U.S. warnings, Serb tanks and troops struck 
against a Kosovo Albanian rebel stronghold Thursday, dealing a blow 
to U.S.-led efforts to bring peace to the troubled Serb province. 
Ethnic Albanians said at least one person was killed and several others 
injured in what Serb officials reportedly called a ``limited'' operation 
in search of the killers of a Serb policeman slain in the area Monday. 
In a statement distributed Thursday night by the government's Tanjug 
news agency, Serb police said they ``liquidated'' several ``terrorists'' 
in the rebel stronghold Lapastica after guerrillas fired at the police 
with ``different arms.'' Ultra-nationalist Serbian Vice Premier Vojislav 
Seselj said ``our police must continue to clamp down against the terrorists,'' 
referring to the Kosovo Liberation Army. The KLA is fighting for independence 
for Kosovo, where ethnic Albanians form 90 percent of the province's 
2 million people. The province is in southern Serbia, the main Yugoslav 
republic. The Kosovo Information Center, close to the province's ethnic 
Albanian leadership, said Serb police and military raided six villages 
near Podujevo, 32 kilometers (20 miles) north of the provincial capital, 
Pristina. Hysni Fazliu, a spokesman for the party of leading ethnic 
Albanian politician Ibrahim Rugova, said rebels resisted the attack 
in a ``fierce battle.'' An Associated Press Television News crew saw 
the body of one man killed by a shell in one of the villages, Glavnik. 
Ethnic Albanians said three others were injured in the blast and that 
many more injuries were reported in other villages that came under 
the attack. Hundreds of ethnic Albanians, including women and children, 
fled the region on foot and by vehicles on snow-covered roads and 
hills around Podujevo. ``I just had time to pick up my children and 
flee,'' said Shukrije Bashota, 28, from the rebel-controlled village 
Lapastica. ``I have nothing else with me.'' An elderly woman from 
Glavnik, who identified herself only as Cefzere, said Serb attackers 
``opened grenade fire at us even before our children were awake. We 
are in the mountains without bread. I don't know what we are going 
to do.'' Jorgen Grunnet, a spokesman for the Organization for Security 
and Cooperation in Europe, confirmed shelling and machine-gun fire 
in the area. Grunnet also confirmed one death and said fighting was 
continuing late Thursday. Police sources, speaking on condition of 
anonymity, said ethnic Albanian snipers were firing in the area. Grunnet 
said convoys of Yugoslav army vehicles, including several Russian-built 
T-55 tanks, were seen leaving bases in Pristina and Podujevo early 
Thursday. They converged just west of Podujevo and launched the operation. 
He said Yugoslav authorities told the OSCE the sweep was a ``limited 
search operation.'' But Grunnet told CNN-International that the operation 
seemed more than ``a normal police operation that you see in most 
countries of the world.'' The operation, ``11th graf pvs
