Three Dutch university hospitals have joined forces in an effort to 
pioneer a Viagra-style impotence pill for women. Pfizer, the U.S. 
pharmaceutical company that makes Viagra, is funding the effort by 
researchers at the principal teaching hospitals in Amsterdam, the 
northern city of Groningen and the southern city of Maastricht, Dutch 
media reported Thursday. One target of such a pill would be treating 
the vaginal dryness that can make intercourse painful, particularly 
for older women, a spokesman for the study said. Viagra, while stimulating 
sexual desire in men, has little or no effect on increasing a woman's 
sexual appetite, the researchers said.
