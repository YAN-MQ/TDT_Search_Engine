Russia's nuclear industry exports are expected to bring in dlrs 2 
billion to dlrs 2.2 billion this year, a four-fold increase since 
1991, a senior official said Thursday. Nuclear technology and materials 
are among Russia's few profitable exports, and the cash-strapped government 
is eager to continue the deals in spite of uneasiness on the part 
of the United States. Washington worries that Russia's nuclear technologies 
will find their way to ``rogue'' nations like Iran and Libya. Russia 
says those fears are groundless. Russian Deputy Nuclear Energy Minister 
Lev Ryabev said Thursday that Moscow's revenues from nuclear exports 
are likely to further increase in the future, partly because of lucrative 
deals to build nuclear power plants in China, India and Iran. The 
U.S. government worries that Iran will use its plant _ being built 
under a contract said to be worth about dlrs 800 million _ to develop 
its potential to make nuclear weapons. Moscow rejects the suggestion. 
Ryabev said that Russia is also working on deals with several unspecified 
African and Middle Eastern countries to build floating nuclear power 
plants, the Interfax news agency reported. Russia is also selling 
uranium from decommissioned nuclear weapons to the United States under 
deals that bring in dlrs 500 million to dlrs 600 million each year, 
Ryabev said, according to Interfax. Russia's nuclear export revenues 
have quadrupled since 1991, when the country made dlrs 500 million 
to dlrs 600 million over the whole year, he said. This summer, the 
Clinton administration imposed sanctions on seven Russian companies, 
banning them from doing business with U.S. firms, in an attempt to 
scare these companies away from deals with Iran. The companies weren't 
doing business with America.
