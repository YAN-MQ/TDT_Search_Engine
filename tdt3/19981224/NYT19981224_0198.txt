The Standard &AMP; Poor's 500-stock index hit a new high last week. 
The Dow Jones industrial average of 30 stocks did not. Since June, 
the S&AMP;P is up 37 percent, while the Dow is up 20 percent. Measured 
over the last two years, the divergence is even wider, with the S&AMP;P 
up 60 percent and the Dow up 38 percent. These are unusually wide 
gaps between the two most popular and closely watched indexes, which 
usually move at about the same pace, up or down. The divergence leaves 
investors wondering how strong the market has really been this year. 
The S&AMP;P's bettering of the Dow is likely to fuel its own growth 
in the new year, said Greg A. Smith, chief investment strategist at 
Prudential Securities, as investors throw money at index funds based 
on the S&AMP;P. Much of the divergence is explained by what is going 
on in the American economy. While computer shares have soared recently, 
manufacturing stocks, especially those of many exporters, have been 
crushed by economic turmoil in the rest of the world. The energy industry, 
meanwhile, has been hit hard by lower oil prices. In sum, the venerable 
Dow is more heavily loaded with the companies that are being hurt 
and short on those that are doing well. In the last four weeks, announcements 
of expected disappointments in earnings have often been from Dow companies. 
Nine of the Dow 30 _ Merck, Boeing, Minnesota Mining and Manufacturing, 
Union Carbide, Coca-Cola, J.P. Morgan, Caterpillar, Sears and Procter 
&AMP; Gamble _ said their fourth-quarter profits would be below expectations. 
But other factors are at work, too. One is the fact that the two indexes 
are calculated differently. Since the Dow is based on price, Dow stocks 
with higher prices have a bigger impact on the change in the total 
index. The S&AMP;P is based on the change in a company's market capitalization 
_ the product of the change in price and the amount of stock outstanding. 
The bigger a company's market cap, the bigger its impact. In the last 
year and a half, investors have been favoring a very small group of 
big, well-known stocks. More of them are in the S&AMP;P than in the 
Dow. Thirteen stocks, according to Merrill Lynch, accounted for over 
half of this year's move in the S&AMP;P. But only five of them _ Wal-Mart 
Stores, IBM, Merck, Exxon and General Electric _ are in the Dow. Those 
not in the Dow, but in the S&AMP;P, were Microsoft, Intel, Cisco Systems, 
Lucent Technologies, Dell Computer, Pfizer, Home Depot and Time Warner. 
At the end of November, 50 stocks accounted for half the total market 
capitalization of the S&AMP;P 500, its greatest bias toward bigness 
in 16 years. David Blitzer, chairman of the index committee at S&AMP;P, 
noted that if the S&AMP;P 500 index were calculated on a basis that 
weighed each stock price equally _ which would bring it closer to 
the way the Dow is calculated _ it would be up only 10.8 percent through 
November. That is because almost half of the stocks in the S&AMP;P 
are down for the year. But in an index that favors big market caps, 
the stocks that have dropped have much less impact because the better 
performers are so much bigger. In addition, it is not the best price 
gainers that account for most of the jump in the S&AMP;P 500. Instead, 
it is the companies whose market capitalizations have increased the 
most. The 10 S&AMP;P stocks with the biggest price moves through Wednesday 
were Dell, EMC, Apple Computer, Ascend Communications, Lucent Technologies, 
Cisco Systems, Unisys, MCI Worldcom, Staples and Providian Financial. 
Only three of these are among the top 10 movers of the S&AMP;P. General 
Electric was one of the top movers of the S&AMP;P, but its price is 
up just 34 percent, well below Dell's increase of 242 percent. Microsoft, 
having a big year, is up 117 percent. Providian Financial, the 10th-best 
performer, is up 130 percent. The question is what index reflects 
best what is going on. John A. Prestbo, editor of the Dow Jones indexes, 
said: ``Despite the vast difference in the stocks and the difference 
in the calculation, over time the Dow and the S&AMP;P correlate 95 
percent of the time. They are both telling the same story about the 
market.'' Blitzer of S&AMP;P argues that his index is a better reflection 
of the entire economy because it is bigger than the Dow and because 
it is changed more regularly with the addition and subtraction of 
stocks. America Online will be added this week. But he acknowledges 
that most individual investors focus on the changes in their stocks' 
prices and, therefore, would probably be more comfortable with the 
Dow. ``The Dow,'' he said, ``is an index that the average guy would 
relate to more.''
