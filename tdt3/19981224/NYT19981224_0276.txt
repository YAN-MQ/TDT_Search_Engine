In a week when temperatures in the 20s with low gray clouds, sleet 
and whipping winds made this central Arkansas city where Bill Clinton 
grew up uncommonly cold and gloomy, many residents' feelings about 
the president would surely warm his heart. From Rocky's Corner, the 
bar and restaurant that was a favorite of his mother, to the Hot Springs 
Country Club, and from Hester's cafe, where some of the local political 
pundits gather for breakfast, people defend Clinton despite what they 
acknowledge to be his moral mistakes, attack Kenneth W. Starr for 
``hound-dogging'' a trail they think would have been best left cold 
and rail against their congressman, who voted for the two articles 
of impeachment that the House of Representatives adopted. Of 65 people 
interviewed, 10 said they would like to see him ousted, and two more 
said he should resign. But the rest were in his corner, some for the 
first time. ``I have never voted for him before in my life, but I 
would vote for him now,'' said Cliff Crook, a furniture store owner 
who had stopped at Rocky's. ``He hasn't done anything anybody else 
hasn't done.'' Crook denounced the impeachment votes cast by Rep. 
Jay Dickey, a Republican whose district includes Hot Springs, and 
predicted continued public support for Clinton. ``He's good for the 
country,'' Crook said, ``no matter what kind of reputation he has.'' 
Mike Simonovich, the owner of Rocky's, who proudly pointed out the 
table that was once frequently occupied by Clinton's mother, the late 
Virginia Clinton Kelley, often after her visits to the Oaklawn Park 
race track across the street, said the president could ``still take 
care of business.'' Yet some did lament what they saw as the unfulfilled 
potential of Clinton's second term. One was Wendy Watterson, a recent 
college graduate and resident of nearby Arkadelphia, who had stopped 
by Rocky's for a pizza. Ms. Watterson was herself a White House intern 
in 1996 and, she said, had three ``face to face'' meetings with Clinton, 
always with many others around. So, she said, she was surprised at 
disclosure of the president's Oval Office encounters with Monica S. 
Lewinsky, whom she never met. Ms. Watterson, who favors censure of 
the president rather than his removal, said: ``What is really disappointing 
is that he had such lofty goals, especially about a real dialogue 
on multicultural issues, that in the end will be overcome by something 
unfavorable and very personal.'' Mark Moore, a manager for a stereo 
manufacturer, attacked the investigative methods of Starr, the independent 
counsel. ``I think Starr had a vendetta against Clinton,'' Moore said. 
``A $50 million hound dog will eventually force someone into a mistake.'' 
At Hester's cafe, about a mile south of Rocky's, there was greater 
disappointment directed at the conduct of the president himself. Almost 
everyone who was asked whether his behavior reflected badly on the 
state said it had damaged the country as a whole far more. ``He's 
our man _ he was bad, but we've got to forgive him,'' said John Bates, 
a builder. ``He's not hurt Arkansas as bad as he's hurt the nation.'' 
Among the toughest on Clinton was Zeke Hogeland, a retiree, who said 
the Senate ought to remove him. ``I never liked the man since he was 
in high school,'' Hogeland said. ``He was a spoiled brat who could 
do no wrong in his mother's eyes. If he had not lied under oath, this 
would never have come about.'' But others, especially men, saw a distinction 
between lying, on one hand, and lying about sexual matters, on the 
other. ``If you're talking about lying about having an affair with 
an intern,'' said Larry Johnson, a builder, ``that's not lying. That's 
survival.'' Peggy Jackson, a waitress, saw politics behind the effort 
to drive Clinton from office, and was also critical of Ms. Lewinsky. 
``This woman is going to be a multimillionaire because of what happened, 
and he's going to lose his career,'' Ms. Jackson said. ``If I were 
Hillary, I would sue Monica for alienation of affection in a minute.'' 
OPTIONAL CUT Ms. Jackson was one of several people angered by congressman 
Dickey's votes for impeachment. In a telephoned response to the criticism, 
he said, ``I expected the harsh reaction, and I hope I can explain 
to the voters it was a vote of conscience.'' Asked whether he might 
join those members of the House who voted for impeachment but have 
since appealed to the Senate to consider censure, Dickey replied: 
``I've released myself completely from the final results. Whatever 
happens in the Senate will be completely acceptable to me.'' In the 
oldest part of the downtown section of Central Avenue, known as Bathhouse 
Row, luncheon diners at the upscale Faded Rose restaurant were largely 
opposed to the president's ouster. Shirley Robins, who works at a 
mental health center, said: ``He's been hounded from the minute of 
his election. It's just a shame that his personal life got in the 
way of his career. He could have done a lot more. He's got me hypnotized 
_ like Elvis Presley.'' END OPTIONAL CUT At St. Joseph's Regional 
Medical Center, about five miles south of downtown, Dr. Devi Jayaramanm, 
a pathologist who was a longtime friend of Mrs. Kelley, a nurse-anesthetist, 
said of her son, ``It would be bad to kick him out of office when 
he's doing a good job.'' Another friend of Mrs. Kelley, Mabel Taylor, 
a nurse, said: ``I love Bill. I think he should be punished but not 
kicked out.'' ``He loves black people,'' said Ms. Taylor, who is black. 
``He grew up around them, and it made no difference to him or Virginia 
whether you were black or white.'' In the Stag Room of the Hot Springs 
Country Club, where about 15 members, mostly retired, were gathered 
for card games, the heated positions on both sides of the issue generally 
subsided into mutters when an interviewer asked for names. Of the 
several who identified themselves, one was Scott Campbell, former 
chief prosecutor here in Garland County, who said the president ought 
to be allowed to complete his term. ``What would be accomplished if 
Bill Clinton were removed?'' Campbell said. ``How would it affect 
the dollar, the economy, the market and, maybe most important, the 
foreign situation? These are not offenses that would interfere with 
his carrying out his duties as president.'' Campbell added, as a prosecutor 
``I never charged anyone with perjury.'' Jim Guerin looked up from 
his cards to say, ``The pope couldn't stand up under this investigation.''
