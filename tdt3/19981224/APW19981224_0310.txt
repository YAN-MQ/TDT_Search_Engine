Some 1,500 teachers and 3,000 administrative workers at a Yemeni university 
ended a strike after authorities agreed to give them a 50 percent 
salary hike, the weekly al-Sahwa reported Thursday. The San`a University 
employees in the capital San`a and its several campuses across the 
country returned to work on Wednesday after President Ali Abdullah 
Saleh asked officials to accept the strikers' demand for a raise, 
the Arabic-language paper said. Since the strike began on Dec. 8, 
some 70,000 students had been left without classes. The government 
had agreed to a 50 percent raise after a strike in June also, but 
the university employees said the promise was never fulfilled. University 
teachers earn between dlrs 300 and dlrs 500 a month in Yemen. A special 
government committee had promised a monthly salary raise of about 
170,000 riyals (dlrs 128) in 1995, but that too never came through.
