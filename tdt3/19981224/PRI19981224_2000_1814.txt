For The World, I'm Derek Stothel in the BBC newsroom in London. The 
rebel Kosovo Liberation Army, the KLA, says it's partially calling 
off its cease-fire. The move comes after Serbian security forces launched 
a new attack against ethnic Albanians in Kosovo. But the rebels have 
stressed they're not mounting an all-out war against Belgrade. NATO 
secretary-general Javier Solana expressed regret over the KLA's decision. 
I think that it would be a tremendous mistake. But I would like to 
use this opportunity to make it very clear, appeal to both sides to 
comply with the cease-fire they had agreed and to continue with the 
only solution to that dramatic problem, which is a political solution. 
NATO secretary-general Javier Solana.
