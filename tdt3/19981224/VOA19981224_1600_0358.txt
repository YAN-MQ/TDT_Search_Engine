In Israel, a former chief of the armed forces says he is retiring 
from the Army, paving the way for an election challenge against Prime 
Minister Benjamin Netanyahu. Ross Dunn in Jerusalem reports opinion 
polls indicate the former Israeli military chief, Amnan Liptin Shihat, 
could win the elections. After months of speculation, Mr. Shihat announced 
his retirement from the Army and said he wants to be at the forefront 
of a new Centrist Party. He told an Israeli newspaper that he will 
serve either as the leader or deputy of the new political grouping. 
Which would aim to oust Mr. Netanyahu. Opinion polls have suggested 
that Mr. Shihat, until five months ago, was the chief of staff of 
the Israeli Defense Force, could be the front runner in the direct 
elections for prime minister. As a serving general, he was prevented 
from making political statements and he remains reticent about declaring 
his policies, despite his decision to retire from the Armed Forces. 
He has told reporters he will be making an official announcement of 
his election platform only after the Israeli parliament completes 
the passage of legislation for an early poll. The date of the election 
has not been decided, but political leaders say it could be set anywhere 
between March and June. By remaining vague about his policies, Mr. 
Shihat has indicated that he will run a campaign based on his high 
standing in the community, possibly making it more difficult for his 
opponents to attack him. Observers say that by keeping policy positions 
to a minimum, the former general has more chances to pick up electoral 
support from both the left and the right. He is feared by Mr. Netanyahu 
and the opposition labor party leader, Ahud Barak, the other main 
candidate. Mr. Barak's supporters have expressed concern that Mr. 
Shihat will draw voters away and cost labor the election. Ross Dunn
