Doctors in Houston say they are increasingly optimistic a set of eight 
brothers and sisters will survive. Their father, who made his first 
public comments about their births today, says he is "excited and 
grateful to God." Tony Frassrand has more. Stunned beyond belief. 
A simple explanation from a man thrust into an extraordinary situation. 
Iyke Louis udobi, the father of the world's only known surviving octuplets 
expressed gratitude in his first public comments since the birth of 
the children. I'm excited and grateful to God for giving us these 
blessings. Me and my wife are very elated. We thank God. We thank 
the doctors, and the therapists that made this possible. And we thank 
the world that has been praying for us. Five girls and two boys were 
born by Cesarean section Sunday, ten weeks premature. The eighth, 
a girl, was born naturally December 8th. The babies ranged in weight 
at birth from 11 to 28 ounces. The smallest, the size of a Beanie 
baby. Doctors have high hopes. I'm very optimistic about the seven 
babies, excluding the small baby, and sort of guardedly optimistic 
about her. She has done better than we have expected thus far. All 
eight of the babies have been given Nigerian names relating to god. 
The world has reacted to the births with an outpouring of support 
and gifts such as a year's supply of groceries and a lifetime supply 
of diapers. And speaking of diapers, the mother's brother put the 
situation in perspective. We're talking about a thousand diapers a 
week, changed. So there's a lot of work to be done. The 27-year-old 
mother is recuperating and has yet to see the babies because of her 
weak condition. For now, at least, eight is definitely enough. Tony 
Frassrand, "Headline News."
