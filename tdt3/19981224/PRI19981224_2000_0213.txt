One of the teams hoping to be first to fly around the world nonstop 
in a balloon says China won't let any more balloons pass through its 
airspace. Swiss balloonist Bertrand Picard says that means he'll have 
to postpone his expedition. He blames British tycoon Richard Branson 
and American millionaire Steve Fossett for the setback. Branson and 
Fossett are more than half way through their flight, heading east 
across the Pacific. They hope to reach the West Coast tomorrow. With 
the time at four minutes past the hour, I'm Derek Stothel. You're 
listening to The World.
