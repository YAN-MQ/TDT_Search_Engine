A toy train winding through a tiny village is sure to put a smile 
on a Child's face. Gina London reports, some firefighters in Baltimore, 
Maryland, are keeping the tradition chugging along. There's two trains." 
Here comes another one. Toy trains enthralling kids of all ages is 
nothing new, but what makes this display special, is it's put on by 
firefighters, who have been throwing the switches here for more than 
40 years. The elaborate fantasy land where the six trains chug through 
and around keeps people coming back. I remember coming here as a child, 
we lived not too far away. Work on the annual display begins in August. 
Firefighters search their imaginations, and the news, to come up with 
something different. They're just very clever about it. A lot of good 
imagination. If you just walk through once, you don't get the full 
effect. You think, "oh, they just thought it up," but it's no -- it's 
a lot of work involved. More than 200 motors bring the village and 
its tiny inhabitants to life. Look over there, Mike. What? It's a 
lot to see. Michael's finding a lot of people he knows. The characters. 
Some kids you don't get any expression at all, they're just in awe. 
There's more! Other kids are very vocal. Pointing at everything and 
it actually makes you feel good. The train garden is supported completely 
by donations. And since the firefighters can't squeeze those mountains 
alongside the fire trucks year-round, the landscape is leveled, built 
anew each year. It's a lot of work. It's worth it, just to see their 
face. Gina London, CNN, Baltimore.
