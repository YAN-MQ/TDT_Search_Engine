There is no George Bailey in this holiday tale, no central figure 
who is, spiritually, the richest man in the pro basketball lockout. 
There are only those so spoiled by wealth, so drunk with fame, that 
they have forgotten to whom they owe their wonderful life. The Frank 
Capra classic is being shown on NBC Friday evening instead of the 
New York Knicks and the Chicago Bulls, but if only there were a tailored 
remake, an angel to help David Stern and all his players understand 
how their careers could have otherwise turned out. Two angels, in 
fact, might have co-starred in the role of Clarence, given a slight 
variation on the original theme. ``See, commissioner, there is no 
more Christmas Night game, because, without us, the ratings were never 
good enough to get it going,'' Magic Johnson would have said. And 
Larry Bird would have informed Michael Jordan that the United Center 
doesn't even exist, saying, ``The league never became important enough, 
so Jerry Reinsdorf never had the money or the power to build it.'' 
Without Johnson's and Bird's grass-roots appeal, I wonder how globally 
celebrated Jordan would be, and how brilliant a star-maker Stern would 
be, how much the master manipulator David Falk would be. Would there 
have been a National Basketball Association takeover of U.S.A. Basketball, 
a Dream Team, a Barcelona Olympics? Would there have been taxpayer-financed 
largess for owners, more than $9 million a year for Stern, $100 million 
payouts to players, and the resulting windfalls for Falk? Would teams 
teetering on the edge of bankruptcy during the early 1980s still be 
in business? Would there have been hundreds of ownership millions 
shared and player jobs created by expansion into cities like Minneapolis 
and Vancouver? Would the players be the out-of-touch lot they have 
exposed themselves as these last few months? Would Stern have dared 
to jet off to Aspen while his shuttered league burns, and hard-core 
fans boil? ``Commissioner,'' Bird would drawl in the movie remake, 
``you have no vacation home, because you never made enough money to 
buy one. You can't even ski.'' ``The finals never did make network 
prime time,'' Johnson would chime in. ``You had to put your championship 
games on cable, just like hockey.'' When Johnson won his first championship 
with the Los Angeles Lakers, in 1980, he had one of the sport's greatest 
individual performances in the Game 6 title-clincher _ a game shown 
in the New York market by CBS on delayed tape because it could not 
out-rate a rerun of ``Dallas.'' That's where the NBA was when Johnson 
and Bird created an instant rivalry, East versus West, black versus 
white. As much as the latter component was exploited, the best of 
the NBA transcended color because Johnson and Bird were too good and 
too compelling to be cast as one-dimensional props. They were rare, 
selfless artists on teams that won. Best of all, they were populist 
by nature, eminently likable, the forgotten, crucial element of a 
labor war coldly defined by both sides as a battle over $2 billion. 
Without its makeup, today's NBA looks more like Lionel Barrymore than 
Jimmy Stewart. The owners and players keep faxing out proposals, taking 
out full-page ads, when shockingly few care. Assuming the Jan. 7 ``drop 
dead'' date produces a settlement between Stern and Billy Hunter, 
who met Wednesday night in Los Angeles, the public apathy should terrify 
them all. ``Without us, you had no magic,'' Johnson would tell Stern. 
``Never had the international air space to fly in,'' Bird would tell 
Jordan. Johnson and Bird didn't invent the NBA, but they surely did 
reinvent it, and then Madison Avenue took notice, and the money poured 
in, and the players, from Jordan on down, joined Stern in the grand 
sellout, of arenas and values. I recall once asking Stern if he was 
worried about the escalating ticket prices. He shrugged and remarked 
that most NBA fans watch games at home. Stern had a corporate vision 
for this baby, and the players never did complain about that race 
card, about an audience growing richer and whiter with each passing 
year. Now, when they threaten a new ``players' league,'' they talk 
as if Patrick Ewing will be commissioner and they won't need underwriting 
from some new corporate daddy. Lightheaded from their rare leverage, 
the owners make cancellation of the season sound no more injurious 
than sending kids to their rooms. Meanwhile, college games crowd the 
airwaves and fill the breach, and every time a buzzer sounds, another 
NBA fan gets his or her wings, and flies away.
