The holidays are full of festivities and food. While overindumb jing 
can be hazardous for some, most will just have a Stomach ache. If 
you can't resist all the good99 goodies and get stuffed, here are 
tips. Go for a walk. Walk around the house a bit. Brush your teeth. 
Changing the taste in your mouth may help you feel refreshed. Chew 
gum, and finally, place yourself. If you leaded up on dinner, wait 
for dessert. As for the guilt -- Don't feel guilty, but you don't 
have to overdo it to be good.
