Rescue crews spent hours today getting people out of an overturned 
bus on the garden state parkway in New Jersey. The tour bus went through 
a guardrail and flipped over an embankment after the driver lost control 
on the icy highway. Police say at least eight people were killed and 
many more hurt. The bus was taking passengers from Brooklyn to casinos 
in Atlantic City.
