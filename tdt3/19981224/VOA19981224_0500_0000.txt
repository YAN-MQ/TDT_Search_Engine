The UN Security Council divided in their ideas on policy towards Iraq 
meets again next week to resume the debate. And a former UN arms inspector 
talks about the likelihood that the inspectors will ever return to 
Iraq. The Russian Prime Minister promises to step down if parliament 
rejects the lean budget he proposes. The Duma receives that budget 
today. We will talk to our correspondent in Moscow. The world's Christians 
are celebrating Christmas Eve. We will stroll the holiday streets 
of New York City. Hello, I am Les Carpenter. I am Charlene Porter. 
Other Christmas stories also ahead. A taste of the season's cooking, 
sampling of the music. Stay tuned for details on all these stories, 
sports and business all in this hour of VOA News Now. First, the news. 
I am David Chadwick, VOA News.
