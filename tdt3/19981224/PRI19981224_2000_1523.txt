As 1998 draws to a close, businesses are already worried about the 
final days of 1999 and whether their computers will be able to register 
the year 2000. Liz George has more now from our business desk in New 
York. In almost every economic forecast for 1999, the Y2K problem 
-- or the millennium bug as it's known -- gets a mention. Predictions 
range from worldwide crisis, as computer systems crash throwing everything 
into chaos, to the more balanced view that the problem will be contained 
with only a few minor inconveniences. Whatever vision you subscribe 
to, it's clear that money, time and effort is being spent preparing 
computers for the year 2000. Abby Cohen is the managing director of 
Goldman Sachs. Year 2000 has been a serious issue for three years. 
U.S. banks, insurance companies and others have already spent a great 
deal and have devoted a great deal of time and attention to fixing 
the problem. When January 1, 2000, comes, we expect it to be not a 
particularly important event. Some statistics may get fouled up a 
little bit. There may be some odd things that happen that last week 
of December and that first week of January. But however well the U.S. 
is prepared, it's not isolated from computer systems around the world. 
Abby Cohen says her concern is with countries like Japan. The Japanese 
banking system does not have the same culture that you find in the 
United States or the UK or much of Europe in terms of having the best 
possible computer systems available. That being the case, I think 
they're already far behind where we are in terms of year 2000 preparedness. 
If we see in Japan what we see in the United States, that is, an investment 
in new improved computer systems and not just the year 2000 fix, this 
is something that may be very worthwhile. And while companies are 
devoting money to ensure their computers are ready for the millennium, 
that's cash that can't be used for other investments. And that could 
have an effect both on growth for the individual firm and the economy 
as a whole. For The World, I'm Liz George in New York.
