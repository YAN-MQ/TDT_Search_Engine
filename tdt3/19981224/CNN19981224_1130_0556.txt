The parents of octuplets born in Houston, Texas, are fielding offers 
of help from America and their native Nigeria. Charles Zewe reports, 
doctors give the babies an 85% chance of survival. Treating the world's 
only octuplets say there is no change in their condition. That is 
good news. With peoples as premature as these babies, they need time 
for their hearts and lungs to develop an their bodies strengthen. 
That prevents intern bleeding in their brain. We think by minimizing 
wide springs in their vital signs, minimizing their stress, we can 
minimize that event which we have very little to control. The babies 
have been named in the tribal tradition of their parents. Only the 
eldest is breathing on her own and eating formula. The as a matter 
of factest, 10.3 ounces is considered the least likely to survive 
is improving. The amount of oxygen she's receiving has been reduced 
slightly. As the babies fight to live, the parents have hired an agent 
to represent them to market the chukwu's story and the first pictures 
of the infants to the highest bidder. The father of the octuplets 
is facing allegations over a September incident in which he allegedly 
assaulted his mother-in-law after threatening his pregnant wife. His 
attorney says he's innocent and faces trial in February. In the same 
hospital nursery as the octuplets, another set of babies is also struggling 
for life. They are the Collins quintuplets six were born in November 
to a lous ton area couple, five survived. The parents already have 
a 17-month-old son who suffers from cerebral palsy. They say they 
know what the chukwus are experiencing. I know we're worrying all 
the time. One day our kids are doing fine, two days later they will 
call us up and say, they have this infection, that infection. So, 
yeah, you are just never out of the Woods. I have lost about ten pounds 
since Chris had the babies. I think it's just from the stress. They 
hope to meet the chukwus. They say they may be able to support each 
other through rough days ahead wondering if their children will live. 
Charles zee wee, Houston.
