From the Wright brothers to space walking astronauts, this century 
has seen plenty of aviation heroes. But there's a pilot in Alabama 
who's done more flying than any Earhart, lindbergh or Glenn. Rick 
Lockridge reports in this edition of tech trends. This is Ed long's 
office -- and this is his view. Not a bad job. Flying all day at 2,000 
feet, checking power lines for an Alabama utility. Still, it's a little 
low-profile for a guy who should be one of the most famous pilots 
in the world. If he weren't so determined not to be. I don't care 
anything about fame or fortune. I just boost the aviation business. 
The 83-year-old long is in the Guinness book of world records for 
most flight time by a pilot. More than 64,000 hours, seven years in 
the air and still climbing. He doesn't drink whiskey, and he doesn't 
smoke cigarettes. He doesn't do anything but fly. He's obsessed. No, 
he'll never give it up. He'll fly until he drops dead. Really, I mean 
that's his life, his whole life. Born just a dozen years after the 
Wright brothers' historic flights at Kitty hawk, Ed long yearned to 
fly from early on. I went to work for this flying school. They agreed 
to give me 30 minutes of flying time for a week's work. No pay, just 
the flying time. That's how I learned to fly. I worked my way through 
flying school. Never a daredevil himself, Ed long watched and admired 
those who pushed the envelope. Amelia Earhart. Charles Lindbergh. 
And recently, John Glenn. Another man who wasn't about to let age 
stop him from doing what he loved. Age is no factor. I don't notice 
much difference in what I do now than when I started years ago. If 
I did, I'd quit flying. Ed long, quit flying? Well, someday they're 
gonna bury him, and then he'll quit. Thing gets higher and higher. 
I still enjoy it. I still look forward to each morning when I get 
up and go to work. Glad I'm able to go. Rick Lockridge, CNN, Montgomery, 
Alabama.
