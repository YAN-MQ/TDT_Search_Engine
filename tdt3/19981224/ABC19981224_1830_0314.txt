"On the money" tonight -- income and spending. Personal income rose 
.5% in November. That's the biggest gain in nine months. Spending 
rose just .1%, but that followed a big gain in spending in october. 
Of course, what everyone wants to know, how much are Americans spending 
at christmas? Well, final figures aren't in because, American express 
says, half of us don't finish our Christians shopping until today, 
Christmas eve. But it is possible to report that some categories of 
goods have been winners, some losers. Here's ABC's Morton dean. Shoppers 
paid a lot of attention to housewares and home furnishings, to jewelry 
and various computerized items, especially palm pilots. They are the 
hottest product out there and are selling like crazy. a terrific season 
for palm pilots. And palm tree lamps. And I think it's because it's 
a jungle theme. A lot of things this season are doing well for us 
in the jungle theme. Jungle theme or not, it's been a huge holiday 
for home gifts, practical items. We're doing very well with fabric 
covered boxes, place mats, wipeable, a Little microwave -- the Mike 
microwave, heaters and humidifiers. But anyone anxiously awaiting 
a luxury gift should not despair. Jewelry stores have also been very 
busy. What's selling in this jewelry store? Diamond earrings, rolexes, 
high ticket items. And an old favorite among fabrics emerged again 
this Christmas. Cashmere sweaters, cashmere cloves, cashmere scarves 
at all price points. And wonderful colors. However, trendy clothing, 
including polar Fleece sweaters and jackets promoted by specialty 
shops, were bigger hits. The biggest surprise for us has really been 
the fact that the specialty retailers continue to take a lot of market 
share from others. Shoppers were less interested in athletic shoes 
this year. Mass-marketed toys were off except, of course, for furby. 
Heavy clothing was ignored until this week. Colder weather arrived 
just in time to provide an incentive for those who were running out 
the clock. It starts again Saturday, returns and sales making the 
day's after christmas one of the biggest shopping periods of the year.
