Among Olympic perks, there are gifts, favors and possibly bribes. 
And then, there are bulldogs. As the International Olympic Committee 
wrestles with its greatest ethics scandal and three panels investigate 
alleged bribery in Salt Lake City's bid for the Winter Games, IOC 
members and potential host cities face the issue of where friendliness 
ends and corruption begins. Atlanta, like most bid cities, handed 
out gifts to visiting IOC members, and at least one had four legs 
and a wet nose _ a bulldog for a Cuban delegate. ``You get caught 
up in the entertainment mode and you may do things that stretch the 
rules,'' said Charlie Battle, who was in charge of international relations 
in Atlanta's winning bid for the 1996 Olympics. ``You go over the 
top.'' In what may have been one of the most creative acts of gift-giving, 
Atlanta boss Billy Payne gave a bulldog to IOC member Manuel Gonzalez 
Guerra after he admired Uga, the mascot of Payne's alma mater, the 
University of Georgia. ``The biggest problem we had was getting Customs 
to let him take the dog back,'' Battle said. ``They don't like people 
taking things to Havana from the United States. Maybe they were afraid 
we were hiding spy gear in his collar.'' There's no way of knowing 
if Guerra voted for Atlanta in the secret balloting in Tokyo in 1990, 
and IOC rules now limit gifts to a total of dlrs 150 a member - meaning 
any current canine giveaways would probably involve a mutt. In the 
two weeks since the Salt Lake Organizing Committee said families of 
six IOC members received dlrs 400,000 in college scholarships during 
its successful bid for the 2002 Winter Games, Olympic organizers past, 
present and future have defended their work amid allegations that 
the scandal extends far beyond Utah. Marc Hodler, the IOC's senior 
member and one of its most respected, said 5 to 7 percent of the committee's 
115 members were open to bribes and that vote buying occurred in the 
campaigns for the 1996, 1998 and 2000 Olympics. Olympic organizers 
and IOC members say they have done nothing wrong and played by the 
rules, but they also acknowledged that those rules are now being drastically 
tightened by the Salt Lake case. ``The USOC has made it clear to us 
what we can and cannot do,'' said Nick Vehr, the head of Cincinnati's 
bid. ``We have their entire undertaking on limits of gifts and such.'' 
The USOC had no rules on bidding when Salt Lake City finally won the 
Olympics on its fifth try in 1995, according to committee president 
Bill Hybl. The IOC imposed its first limits in 1986, after the volume 
of gifts and favors in the campaigns for the 1992 Games became embarrassing. 
Those ``tokens'' included fur coats, diamond jewelry and unlimited 
first-class travel for members who wanted one more peek at cities 
like Paris, Barcelona and Brisbane.
