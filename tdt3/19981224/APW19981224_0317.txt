A gunman pumped a round of bullets into the chest of a parish priest 
Thursday as he went to celebrate Mass in a small town, killing the 
man who previously was a local politician, investigators said. The 
Rev. Graziano Muntoni, 57, was shot to death in a tiny alley in Orgosolo, 
about 6:40 a.m. as he walked to the local Roman Catholic church for 
the first service of the day, Italian news reports said. A report 
on RAI, the Italian state TV, from Orgosolo, which is about 30 kilometers 
(20 miles) south of the inland city of Nuro, said Muntoni became a 
priest late in life, in 1990, after years of being a Christian Democrat 
politician. It quoted investigators as saying the priest might have 
been made to pay for his campaign against crime, including kidnappings, 
which are masterminded by gangs of Sardinian bandits. ``He was a holy 
priest who loved the people of Orgosolo,'' said the town's pastor, 
the Rev. Pietro Meloni, telling reporters he could not give a motive.
