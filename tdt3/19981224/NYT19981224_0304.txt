When Lea Cloud, 29, a project architect, opened the door to a trailer 
on a remote college campus in western New York, she was confronted 
by a table full of men. ``I was really intimidated,'' Ms. Cloud said. 
The trailer was the construction headquarters for a major addition 
to a library, and she was in charge. ``I was afraid they were going 
to ask me something I didn't know the answer to,'' she recalled, ``and 
they did.'' But she got through the experience, and the renovation 
to the Reed Library at the State University of New York at Fredonia 
won an award from the American Institute of Architects in 1995. Now 
she is part of an anomaly, a small group of women changing the face 
of architecture, a profession long dominated by men. In 1995, she 
and Victoria Rospond, a classmate at the Rhode Island School of Design, 
started CR Studio. According to the institute, women own only 7 percent 
of the 15,000 member firms; 18 percent of all architects are women, 
compared with 26 percent of physicians and 27 percent of lawyers. 
No woman has the name recognition of Frank Gehry, Richard Meier or 
I.M. Pei. Only Maya Lin comes close, but many regard her as more a 
sculptor than an architect. ``The funny thing about architecture is 
that unless you win a competition, the process of getting larger and 
larger commissions is very slow,'' said Charles Gwathmey of Gwathmey 
Siegel &AMP; Associates of New York. ``Architects my age have proven 
themselves. We've been working 40 years. Unfortunately for women, 
this group today are the pioneers.'' There has been progress. In 1997, 
the institute said, 31 percent of the graduates of architecture schools 
were women, up from 25 percent 12 years earlier. Women agree that 
the prospects are looking up. ``I think that now it's easier to be 
a woman architect than in any other period,'' said Frances Halsband, 
principal of her own firm in New York. One reason is that architects 
are often chosen on the basis of design competitions, where the work, 
not the sex of its creator, is all-important. And some clients are 
trying hard to hire more women, Ms. Halsband said. Eileen Fisher, 
a clothing designer who commissioned CR Studio for a showroom on Seventh 
Avenue in the garment district and a store on West Broadway in SoHo, 
said of Ms. Cloud and Ms. Rospond: ``They were young and talented. 
I liked that they were women. I felt that they understood what I was 
trying to do. They understood my sensibility.'' The store on West 
Broadway _ with its minimalist design and public garden for use by 
shoppers and area residents _ won CR Studio its latest coup, a 1998 
Architecture Design Citation from the New York chapter of the institute. 
After graduating from the Rhode Island school, Ms. Cloud spent 13 
years with Pasanella, Klein, Stolzman &AMP; Berg Architects in New 
York, becoming an associate within five years. But she wanted to become 
a partner, and when that didn't happen, she decided to join Ms. Rospond, 
who had opened her own office in 1991 after working six years for 
a New Jersey developer, designing and detailing large-scale office 
buildings and doing site planning. ``Having grown up in the era we 
grew up in, and both of us having fathers who had their own businesses, 
we knew and understood the risks of starting our own business,'' Ms. 
Cloud said. Still, she revels in controlling her own projects, instead 
of being a name on the list of architects at a big firm. ``It's all 
ours,'' she said. ``If we did it right, it's because we did it right. 
It's our accomplishment. And if we did it wrong, it's because we did 
it wrong.'' In some ways, they have started modestly. An institute 
citation won by Ms. Rospond in 1995, for the Takashimaya Tea Box Cafe 
at 693 Fifth Avenue, hangs next to a postcard on a partition in the 
office they share with another architect. Still, Ms. Rospond is concerned 
with gaining recognition. ``I want to be in the show,'' she said. 
So far, their show is getting good reviews. Bill Swinson, director 
of the Millburn (N.J.) Free Public Library, where CR Studio was picked 
to design a $2 million renovation, said, ``We looked seriously at 
five applicant organizations'' before choosing CR Studio, the only 
one owned by women. ``Even though CR Studio didn't have the length 
of experience as the others,'' he said, ``the building committee was 
really taken with their approach to the esthetics, work flow and traffic 
flow.'' CR Studio's latest project is the renovation of the Frederick 
H. Leonhardt People's Center at the Museum of Natural History in New 
York, which is a place for lectures, films and performances that try 
to attract people who may not be typical museum visitors. ``We weren't 
looking to get your typical architectural firm,'' said Teddy Yoshikami, 
the museum's manager of multicultural programs. ``It was unusual that 
they were women.'' Even so, the pair are not eager to stay anomalies. 
They strongly encourage other women to start their own architectural 
firms. ``Get out there and do it,'' Ms. Rospond said. ``There aren't 
enough women in architecture who are in the position of being the 
boss.''
