Coming up after "Dollars & Sense" -- a school nativity scene unlike 
you've seen before. Next, our top stories. I will remember you will 
you remember me in December, every minute you talk on AT&T will mean 
an AT&T donation don't let your life to the American red cross. The 
more calls you make, pass you by... the more help we can give. And 
I will remember you this year, why not reach out to everyone you love, 
so we can all reach out to those who need it most. Will you remember 
me there's a school where the toughest courses are the most popular, 
lectures are a joy, and no one ever cuts class. This renowned institution 
is the Nicklaus flick golf school. Can you feel that? Yeah. Where 
the faculty is unparalleled... your elbow softer. And the dean has 
6 masters. People might confuse you for a golfer. When you go, bring 
your visa card. Because at the Nicklaus flick golf school, they don't 
take American express. Ooh, yeah! You've done your homework. Visa... 
remember that whole "back to basics" movement? Neither do we. Lincoln 
town car. What a luxury car... should be.
