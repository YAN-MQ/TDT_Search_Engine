I am Dave DeForest, VOA News. Serbian forces backed by tanks and artillery 
have swept through ethnic Albanian villages in northern areas of Serbia's 
Kosovo province. Ethnic Albanian officials say government forces sent 
civilian residents fleeing villages near the town of Padugo. A Serbian 
interior ministry statement says government forces, in its words, 
eliminated many terrorists in the operation. The ethnic Albanians 
called the operation a serious provocation and a challenge to NATO.
