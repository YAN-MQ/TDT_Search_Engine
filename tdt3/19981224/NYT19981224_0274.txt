In a small, but telling sign of the political fallout from the House 
impeachment vote, a handful of local election officials in various 
parts of the country say a surprising number of people have officially 
changed their party registration from Republican to Democrat. At this 
point, the number of party switchers is far too small and occurring 
in far too few places to qualify as any sort of national trend. Typically 
they number less than 100 in localities where the total registration 
among Republicans and Democrats is in the hundreds of thousands. Still, 
county election officials say it is rare during this time of year 
for anyone, even this small number, to change party affiliation. A 
month after the election with thoughts generally focused on the upcoming 
holidays, politics and party registration is the last thing on voters' 
minds, the officials say. ``It is significant for this time of year,'' 
said Deborah Clark, deputy administrator for the Florida Election 
Division office in Pinellas County. ``During the holidays our file 
is usually pretty static. So this is different from the same time 
frame in previous years.'' Ms. Clark said that her office, which encompasses 
the Clearwater area recorded 75 people dropping their Republican registration 
between Dec. 7 and Dec. 21, at the height of the House impeachment 
action. Of those, 55 registered as Democrats. ``We've had about 100 
people change from Republican to Democrat in the last week to week 
and a half,'' said an election official in Polk County, Iowa, which 
includes Des Moines, and who asked not to be identified. ``Some of 
these guys have been Republican for a long time. It's very unusual 
for this time of year.'' Although there are scattered instances of 
party switching that appear to be connected to the Dec. 19 vote by 
the House to impeach President Clinton, election officials in a large 
number of counties say they have not discerned any movement away from 
the Republicans. ``We haven't had anybody do it,'' said Rebecca Khalifa, 
the deputy registrar of Voters in Portland, Maine ``In the past two 
weeks, I don't think there's been one single person who's done it.'' 
When party switching has occurred it has caught the eye of some local 
election officials, especially when there seems to be no apparent 
explanation for the change. The Associated Press this week reported 
a number of people switching parties in Contra Costa and Santa Clara 
counties in northern California. Again, the numbers were very small 
_ 20 requests to change parties in Contra Costa, 10 people switching 
a day in Santa Clara. Election officials say changes are surprising 
since California recently went to an open primary system, making party 
registration less important. ``It's highly unusual for us to get any 
requests for party change,'' said Steve Weir, the Contra Costa elections 
chief.
