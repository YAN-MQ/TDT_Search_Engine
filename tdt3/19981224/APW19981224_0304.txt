Kurdish rebel chief Abdullah Ocalan is not in Russia and is not expected 
in the country any time soon, Russian officials and sources close 
to rebel leader said Thursday. ``Abdullah Ocalan is not and will not 
be on the territory of the Russian Federation,'' Foreign Ministry 
spokesman Vladimir Rakhmanin was quoted as saying by the ITAR-Tass 
news agency. Rakhmanin was responding to Russian television reports 
that said Ocalan, who left Moscow for Rome on Nov. 12, had returned 
to Russia seeking asylum again. His November plea for asylum was backed 
by the Communist-led Russian parliament, but Prime Minister Yevgeny 
Primakov rejected the bid. Ocalan has been looking for a place to 
live since he was expelled from Syria in response to heavy pressure 
from Turkey. Turkey wants to try him as a terrorist. Italy has refused 
extradition, because Ocalan would face the death penalty in Turkey. 
But Italy also has been reluctant to grant him asylum. Merabi Shamoyev, 
head of Russia's Kurdish Union, said Kurds would not try again in 
the near future to arrange for Ocalan to come to Russia after the 
Russian government refused to grant him political asylum. And officials 
at Russia's Federal Security Service, a successor to the KGB, bristled 
at suggestions that they were working with Italian secret services 
to smuggle Ocalan to Russia, news reports said. ``We categorically 
refuse to comment on such assertions,'' Federal Security Service spokesman 
Alexander Zdanovich said, according to the Interfax news agency. Ocalan's 
Kurdish Workers' Party has been waging a 14-year war for autonomy 
in southeast Turkey. Close to 37,000 people have been killed during 
the fighting.
