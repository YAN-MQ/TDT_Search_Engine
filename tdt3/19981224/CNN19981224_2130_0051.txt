Merry Christmas, everyone. This is "CNN Headline News." I'm holly 
Firfer. Winter weather is bearing down on much of the country this 
Christmas eve. Ice storms are blamed for several fatal traffic accidents 
in the south. And in the north, it's still an open question whether 
bad weather caused a Tragic bus accident in New Jersey, killing eight 
passengers. Kate snow has more. It was supposed to be a quick getaway 
from New York City to a Casino in Atlantic City. Instead, the trip 
ended here, just off the garden state parkway. 22 passengers were 
onboard when the driver lost control. It left the roadway and entered 
the median between the inner and outer roadway, overturning several 
times. This eyewitness ran to the bus to help. They just seemed to 
be in shock. They were sitting there, you know, blood on their face, 
and, you know -- The tour bus landed on the driver's side. He survived, 
with head injuries, but others were less fortunate. Some were thrown 
from the bus as it tumbled. Others were trapped inside. Hours after 
the accident, rescue workers were still trying to get at them. People 
are being accessed from actually the bottom of the bus, because the 
wreckage crushed them, and they're pinned through their own limbs 
and the bus configuration and the seats. The injured were taken to 
local hospitals. But police weren't immediately sure who they were. 
Sgs travel scope, the Brooklyn, New York, company that sold the tickets, 
said it didn't know the identities of the passengers. It's the kind 
of tour where passengers buy their tickets at a local candy counter 
or drugstore. This is as severe accident of my 20 years in the state 
police. I've seen some tragedies. This is certainly one of the worst, 
tragic scenarios during a supposedly festive time. The national transportation 
safety board will investigate the accident. Kate snow, "Headline News."
