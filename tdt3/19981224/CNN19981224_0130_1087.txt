Middle income Americans may be getting a break from uncle Sam this 
year. According to the joint committee on taxation, those earning 
between $40,000 and $75,000 will pay less in federal taxes this year, 
than they did in 1997. The declines are due to the debut of several 
new tax credits, including ones for children and education. The biggest 
tax increases will be carried by those making $200,000 or more.
