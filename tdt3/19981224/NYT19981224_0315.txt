Advocates for the poor, who had hoped to force New York state to provide 
food stamps to thousands of able-bodied legal immigrants who have 
not become U.S. citizens, lost a lawsuit this week when a judge upheld 
the state's denial of such assistance. Justice Harold Tompkins of 
state Supreme Court in Manhattan said state officials acted reasonably 
when they decided to provide food stamps only to legal immigrants 
who are at least 60 years old, or younger than 18, or disabled. The 
state program was created last year to help legal immigrants who were 
denied federally financed food stamps under the federal welfare law 
of 1996. The state's policy ``targets the limited funds available 
to the assistance of those most likely to need help, that is, the 
elderly, the infirm and minors,'' Tompkins wrote in his decision, 
which was signed Monday. ``Focusing benefits on those categories of 
persons most likely to need assistance is well within the Legislature's 
authority as having a reasonable basis,'' the justice wrote. Helen 
Lee, a lawyer for the Legal Aid Society, which filed the lawsuit against 
the state in August in partnership with lawyers at the Welfare Law 
Center, said the advocacy groups would appeal the justice's ruling. 
The decision marks the second legal defeat for advocates who have 
been trying to restore benefits that were denied legal immigrants 
under the federal welfare law. Last year, advocates lost a similar 
suit against the federal government when a judge ruled that federal 
officials, who control immigration, had the right to deny benefits 
like food stamps to legal immigrants. In the case decided this week, 
the lawyers sued the state on behalf of people affected by the state's 
policy, claiming officials violated equal-protection provisions of 
the federal and state constitutions when they denied food stamps to 
more than 31,000 impoverished, able-bodied immigrants between the 
ages of 18 and 59. Those provisions, the lawyers said, did not allow 
state officials to choose which poor people would receive aid. New 
York's constitution also requires the state to provide for the needy, 
and the plaintiffs' lawyers charged that the food stamp denial also 
violated that legal obligation, leaving many people struggling to 
survive. Tompkins did not address the state's constitutional obligation 
to provide for the needy, however. Instead, he cited federal rulings 
that found that reasonable policies do not ``offend the Constitution 
simply because the classification is not made with mathematical nicety 
or because in practice it results in some inequality.'' He said the 
lawyers for the poor had failed to prove that the state's policy lacked 
a rational basis. The plaintiffs in the lawsuit included Geraldo Alvarino, 
who said in legal papers that he ate only one meal a day, and Francisco 
Santos of Catskill, N.Y., who said he relied on food pantries. ``The 
court is sympathetic to the plight of the plaintiffs and their real 
need,'' Tompkins wrote. ``However, it cannot ignore the settled principles 
of law.'' ``We're very disappointed,'' Ms. Lee, the Legal Aid Society 
lawyer, said yesterday. ``We believe the decision is wrong. And as 
a result, more people are going to go hungry than need to.'' John 
Madden, a spokesman for the state's Office of Temporary and Disability 
Assistance, which runs the food-stamp program, said state officials 
were pleased with the judge's decision. ``New York state is doing 
more than most states and more than the federal government requires 
on this issue,'' Madden said. About a dozen states created food-stamp 
programs for poor legal immigrants who are not naturalized citizens 
in response to the federal welfare law. Some of those states, including 
New York, restricted participation. The New York lawsuit appears to 
be the first in the nation to challenge restrictions on a state food-stamp 
program for immigrants.
