Pope John Paul II celebrated this Christmas with his mind on the next 
one, looking ahead eagerly to the opening of the jubilee year that 
will launch Christianity's third millennium. John Paul was delivering 
his Christmas Eve Mass homily from St. Peter's Basilica. From there, 
on Dec. 24, 1999, the pope will open 2000 celebrations with the traditional 
jubilee-year opening of the basilica's usually closed main doors. 
``My thoughts already turn to Christmas next year, when, God willing, 
I shall inaugurate the great jubilee with the opening of the holy 
door,'' John Paul said in an advance text of his Christmas Eve homily. 
``It will be a truly great holy year. For in a completely unique way, 
it will celebrate the 2000th anniversary of the event and mystery 
of the incarnation in which humanity reached the apex of its calling. 
God became man in order to give man a share in his own divinity.'' 
``This is the good news of salvation. This is the message of Christmas! 
The church proclaims it tonight by means of my words, too, for the 
peoples and nations of the whole Earth to hear. ``Christ is born for 
us. Come, let us adore him!'' John Paul, increasingly frail at 78, 
has long looked forward to the Jubilee Year as a culminating event 
of his papacy, now in its 21st year. The Christmas Eve Mass opens 
a busy few days for the pope, who has kept his schedule light to save 
his strength for the holiday services. He fell sick with the flu last 
week, forcing him to cancel some of his events on his calendar. The 
pope no longer celebrates Mass on Christmas morning in St. Peter's 
Basilica to allow himself more time to rest up from the midnight Mass 
Christmas Eve. He is scheduled to keep up his tradition of appearing 
before tourists and pilgrims in the square at noon on Christmas Day, 
when he reads a Christmas message and gives holiday greetings in dozens 
of languages. After Christmas, the pope plans to have his usual few 
days of rest at the papal residence in a town outside Rome.
