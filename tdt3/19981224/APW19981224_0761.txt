Brushing aside NATO warnings, Serb tanks and troops struck an ethnic 
Albanian rebel stronghold Thursday in Kosovo, dealing a blow to U.S.-led 
efforts to bring peace to the troubled Serb province. NATO Secretary-General 
Javier Solana told BBC-Television that the Serb offensive was a ``clear 
violation'' of a cease-fire agreed on by Yugoslav President Slobodan 
Milosevic in October to end eight months of fighting and avoid NATO 
airstrikes. At least one person was killed, and ethnic Albanians said 
several others were injured in what they said was an assault by Serb 
police and troops backed with tanks on six villages outside the town 
of Podujevo. Serb police, quoted by the government's Tanjug news agency, 
said they encountered ``fierce fire'' but ``liquidated'' several guerrillas 
in the rebel stronghold Lapastica. The operation was continuing Thursday 
night, they said. Serbian officials reportedly told international 
observers the action was a ``limited operation'' to find the killers 
of a Serb policeman slain on Monday. ``Our police must continue to 
clamp down against the terrorists,'' said ultra-nationalist Serbian 
Vice Premier Vojislav Seselj, referring to the Kosovo Liberation Army. 
The KLA is fighting for independence for Kosovo, where ethnic Albanians 
form 90 percent of the province's 2 million people. The province is 
in southern Serbia, the main Yugoslav republic. In a statement issued 
in the provincial capital Pristina, the KLA stopped short of ending 
its unilaterally declared cease-fire, but said the rebels would ``not 
sit idly by'' and instead would ``attack with all means available.'' 
In neighboring Albania, the foreign ministry called for NATO to intervene 
to ``end the Kosovo drama'' and bring peace to the province. In October 
it took the threat of NATO airstrikes to push Milosevic to accept 
the cease-fire. The deal ended the worst of the fighting after a seven-month 
crackdown by Serb troops on separatists that left 1,000 dead and drove 
300,000 from their homes. Thursday's action by Serb police and military 
struck six villages near Podujevo, 32 kilometers north of Pristina, 
according to the Kosovo Information Center, which is close to the 
ethnic Albanian leadership. An Associated Press Television News crew 
saw the body of one man killed by a shell in one of the villages, 
Glavnik. Ethnic Albanians said three others were injured in the blast 
and many more were injured in other villages under attack. Serb tanks 
entered Lapastica and several houses were set ablaze, the Kosovo Information 
Center said. Serb snipers were also firing at fleeing civilians, it 
said. Hundreds of ethnic Albanians fled the region on foot and in 
vehicles on snow-covered roads and hills around Podujevo. ``I just 
had time to pick up my children and flee,'' said Shukrije Bashota, 
28, from Lapastica. ``I have nothing else with me.'' An elderly woman 
from Glavnik, who identified herself only as Cefzere, said Serb attackers 
``opened grenade fire at us even before our children were awake. We 
are in the mountains without bread. I don't know what we are going 
to do.'' Jorgen Grunnet, a spokesman for the Organization for Security 
and Cooperation in Europe, said Serb authorities had told the OSCE 
that the sweep was a ``limited search operation.'' But Grunnet said 
the operation seemed more than ``a normal police operation.'' He said 
convoys of Yugoslav army vehicles, including several Russian-built 
T-55 tanks, were seen leaving bases in Pristina and Podujevo early 
Thursday. They converged just west of Podujevo to launch the attack. 
The chief ethnic Albanian peace negotiator, Fehmi Agani, called the 
Serb operation a ``very serious provocation'' and a ``a bold challenge 
to NATO,'' which had threatened airstrikes in October to halt the 
fighting. On Wednesday, State Department spokesman James Rubin warned 
against increasing violence, saying it could ``spark a cycle of violence 
that would seriously undermine the cease-fire agreement.'' The American 
head of the OSCE verification force, William Walker, expressed frustration 
at the apparent lack of will for a peaceful settlement, saying ``both 
sides have been looking for trouble and found it.'' Walker said the 
unarmed international verification force was ready to help ``but we 
cannot go out there with arms to stop them if they want to kill each 
other.''
