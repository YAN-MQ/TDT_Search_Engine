While his investment-banking peers brave crowded airports and pack 
into jets bound for long-awaited ski vacations, Saeed Abtahi isn't 
planning to do anything but walk out his front door. He doesn't have 
to: He lives here in the Wasatch Mountains _ at an elevation of almost 
8,000 feet _ with ski slopes all around him. When, after 10 years 
at Bankers Trust in New York and London, Abtahi decided to strike 
out on his own in 1996, he couldn't think of a good reason for living 
or working in a big city, or even a suburb. Since then, his 11-person 
investment firm, Hunter Capital Group, has arranged $1.3 billion in 
private financings out of a low-rise office building in this ski resort 
of 12,000 people, a former mining town an hour's drive from Salt Lake 
City. With modern computer and communications technology, investment 
bankers like Abtahi are finding that they can do business successfully 
from almost anywhere. ``We're a modem country now,'' Abtahi said. 
``This allows for a movement _ maybe 10 to 15 percent of the high-end 
people _ to operate anywhere they want, including places like Park 
City.'' The trend could have ominous implications for major financial 
centers. As manufacturers and financial back-office operations have 
deserted central cities, scholars like Saskia Sassen of Columbia University 
and many urban planners have maintained that urban core regions can 
still thrive by dominating so-called producer services like investment 
banking, money management and financial consulting. But the digitization 
of financial services _ Abtahi's ``modem nation'' _ threatens even 
that dynamic. Already, more than two-thirds of the leading on-line 
brokerage firms are based away from New York City, in places like 
New Jersey, California or Florida. Over time, according to David Krell, 
chief executive of the International Securities Exchange, the very 
idea of the trading floor and centralized financial markets will become 
as obsolete as vacuum tubes. ``We can provide the information, the 
order flow of a traditional market, but with the efficiency of an 
electronic marketplace,'' said Krell, whose firm, based in New York, 
is developing a screen-based options trading system that it hopes 
to put in service in January 2000. ``Our market-makers don't have 
to be in New York, San Francisco, Chicago or Philadelphia _ they can 
be in Sun Valley.'' With anywhere to choose from, many of the new 
breed of rural financiers are attracted to Jackson Hole, Wyo. The 
sprawling town, with a year-round population of just 6,400, is home 
to at least two important financial market players: the Brandywine 
mutual funds and the Data Broadcasting Corp., which supplies financial 
and market information to investors. The Brandywine funds, with more 
than $5 billion in assets, are run by Freiss Associates and the fund 
manager Foster S. Freiss from a two-story log cabin-style office building. 
Data Broadcasting, with 760 employees scattered around New York, California 
and Utah, is managed from the outskirts of Jackson Hole by two other 
Wall Street players, Allan R. Tessler and Alan J. Hirschfield, who 
was once a top executive with the Wall Street firm of Allen &AMP; 
Co. and is a former president of 20th Century Fox. ``What's driving 
growth in places like this is not only technology, but the fact that 
people can now get both quality of life and do their business,'' Hirschfield 
said. ``It's creating a new exodus from urban areas, particularly 
among younger married professionals.'' Indeed, places like Jackson 
Hole; Santa Fe, N.M.; the Colorado Rockies, and the New England coast 
are prime magnets for affluent baby boomers, according to William 
H. Frey, a demographer at the Population Studies Center of the University 
of Michigan. They are migrating in large-enough numbers to make places 
like Aspen and Snowmass among the most expensive in the nation, with 
median home prices often higher than in Beverly Hills. Many of these 
refugees are like Richard Jaycobs, who postponed having children until 
his late 30s and now is based on Nantucket. ``There's a big generational 
thing playing out now,'' said Jaycobs, formerly a fund manager with 
the Computer Trading Corp., who grew up in Brooklyn but moved to Nantucket 
three years ago, at the age of 36. ``I see people my age _ this is 
really about raising children _ and they don't want to stay in the 
city or do the long commutes,'' he said. ``They have the contacts 
enough that they can make the life style choices.'' His new financial 
risk-management consulting firm, Acknowledge Systems, is based in 
Nantucket, though it still has a presence in New York. After all, 
some of the young finance experts and programmers it employs are not 
quite ready to settle down in a sleepy New England village. But as 
these people age and contemplate having families, Jaycobs believes, 
they will become more amenable to moving to the island. Urban cores, 
of course, still possess important advantages, notably elite business 
schools, unique agglomerations of specialized service providers and 
an exciting cultural environment that remains attractive to many young, 
skilled people. But their hold on the nation's financial elite is 
no longer unchallenged and may well fade. Abtahi, for one, is counting 
on it. He wants to entice three or four more Wall Street investment 
bankers up to the mountains. ``Everyone complains about worrying about 
getting laid off, so it's easy to recruit,'' he said. ``People who 
come here, they all have this incredible reaction: This is a great 
way to live.''
