Air raid sirens sounded in Baghdad early Friday, but motorists seemed 
to ignore them and light traffic continued to flow in the streets. 
The United States denied carrying out any military action to cause 
the warning. ``I have no knowledge why the sirens have gone off. The 
U.S. Defense Department is not responsible for it, and it's not doing 
anything,'' U.S. Defense Department spokesman Glenn Flood said in 
Washington. There was no immediate explanation for the air raid siren, 
which sounded after midnight. An all-clear signal was given a half-hour 
later. No anti-aircraft fire was heard. Journalists at the Al-Rasheed 
Hotel were briefly blocked from leaving the hotel and were asked by 
management to go to the bomb shelter. On Tuesday, the Iraqi News Agency 
reported that U.S. and British warplanes violated Iraq's airspace 
and fired two ``stray missiles'' in the direction of the southern 
city of Basra. The Pentagon and the British Defense Ministry denied 
that report. The United States and Britain enforce a no-fly zone with 
air patrols above the 36th parallel in Iraq, as well as just south 
of Baghdad. The Iraqi News Agency, quoting an army spokesman, said 
late Thursday that 14 formations of warplanes violated Iraqi airspace 
in the morning. It did not identify the planes or say how many were 
involved, but said they entered Iraq from Saudi Arabian and Kuwaiti 
airspace. It said the planes were out of the range of Iraqi air defenses. 
Early Friday was the first time air raid sirens were sounded since 
the United States and Britain ended a four-day military strike Sunday. 
In his Christmas address, Iraqi President Saddam Hussein said the 
``rulers of America and Britain ... are the enemies of God.'' ``Their 
criminal aggression was against not only Iraq but also against humanity, 
mankind and the principles called for by Jesus,'' he said in a message 
carried by the Iraqi News Agency. He called on all believers to ``face 
up to these criminals who respect no sanctity.'' Some 5 percent of 
Iraq's 22 million people are Christians and Saddam, who is Muslim, 
issues a Christmas address each year. Iraq has said the U.S.-British 
air and missile attacks killed more than 40 civilians and 62 soldiers. 
The strikes, which began in the early hours of Dec. 17, were launched 
after the United Nations withdrew its weapons inspectors, saying that 
Iraq was blocking their work. Iraq has said it will not allow the 
inspectors to return.
