It is time now for the business news. The New York Stock Exchange 
is staying in town after New York offered the world's largest stock 
exchange a $600 million incentive package. The deal ends months of 
speculation that the exchange dissatisfied with its present quarters, 
would leave New York. VOA correspondent, Elaine Johansen, has details. 
The stock exchange will move across the street from where it now resides 
in lower Manhattan, probably by the year 2004. New York officials 
have offered the exchange a substantial deal, which includes a new 
more modern building for $400 million and some $160 million in tax 
incentives. All this is designed to keep the New York Stock Exchange 
from moving across the Hudson River to neighboring New Jersey. New 
Jersey already has taken many finance-related jobs out of the city 
and tried to lure the big board as well with its own very attractive 
incentive deal. City officials clearly were relieved when the chairman 
of the stock exchange, Richard Grassio, signaled a long-term commitment. 
The partnership we started more than 200 years ago will today be renewed 
well into the next millennium. The New York Stock Exchange for its 
part will pay $350 million for technology and trading floor systems. 
Rent at the new site will start at $10 million a year. The New York 
Stock Exchange, which lists over 3,000 companies on its big board 
is considered the city's economic jewel. It generates about $2 billion 
of economic activity a year. And accounts for 20 percent of the city's 
tax base. It employs nearly 1,500 people and some 3,000 brokers and 
support staff use its floor on an average day. The chairman of New 
York state's development commission, Charles Gargono, says keeping 
the Stock Exchange is good for the entire Wall Street area. That it 
great news to New York state, New York City, but it is also great 
news for downtown. It impacts an area that we have been trying to 
revitalize over the last three or four years. And this certainly will 
be a big boost for that downtown core. The Wall Street area draws 
hundreds of thousands of visitors a year. The building currently housing 
the New York Stock Exchange was built in 1902. The exchange has grown 
dramatically over the decades, so has its reliance on computers. The 
new site will end the cramping of space. An unbefitting condition 
many say, for what is considered the heart of the country's financial 
system. Elaine Johansen, VOA News, New York.
