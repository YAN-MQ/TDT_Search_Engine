A California school's effort to save money on its utility bills has 
put a Chill on its students. Rusty Dornin has the story. Take college 
classrooms, combine finals, a cold snap, and no heat, and you have 
a situation that's downright chilling for students at cabrillo community 
college in Santa Cruz, California. It's cold! We were all shivering. 
I had gloves. Your students? They were shivering worse than me. The 
college is one of 1,100 utility customers in northern california that 
get a big discount on rates. In return, they lose gas or electricity 
if demand is too great. It was. The college, and 55 other businesses, 
watched the indoor temperatures plummet. And this was considered a 
cost-effective means of saving some money -- about $100,000 a year. 
Tell that to the ceramic students who couldn't fire up the kiln. I'm 
more concerned with the fact that the gas was shut off, and my students 
were unable to complete their work. Cold spells are rare in California, 
and the school took a Gamble. It was a probably a pretty good bet, 
but it was still a bet. And when you make a bet, you're taking a chance. 
We haven't had to curtail gas like this since 1990, because it just 
doesn't get that cold in California. Today? I think it's pretty toasty 
today. It's -- what is it, about 44 degrees in here? Something like 
that? How can you write with your gloves on? It's really hard. My 
hand is sliding down, hitting the page. But if you're not wearing 
your gloves, then what? Then my hands are really cold, and I can't 
write anyway. ooh! The school provided space heaters, free coffee 
and hot chocolate. The gas came back on after 48 hours, but administrators 
may feel the heat from students and faculty over a utility contract 
that left them in the cold. Rusty Dornin, CNN.
