The United States is expelling three Cuban diplomats at the United 
Nations for alleged espionage. The State Department says the action 
was taken after an investigation by the Federal Bureau of Investigation. 
Two other members of the Cuban UN mission are also implicated in the 
alleged spying, but the State Department says they have already left 
the country. U.S. officials say this case is linked to the arrests 
in Miami last September of 10 people on charges of spying for Cuba. 
The 10 were accused of collecting intelligence about U.S. military 
installations in Southern Florida and trying to infiltrate local anti 
Castro groups. No comment on the arrests from the Cuban mission.
