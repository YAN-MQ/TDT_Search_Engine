Macedonian customs officials detected the largest known single haul 
of marijuana at the country's border with Greece, media reported Thursday. 
Over one ton of the narcotic substance, packed in specially designed 
small boxes, was discovered late Wednesday in a secret compartment 
under the trailer of a truck with Macedonian plates arriving from 
Greece. The bust is reportedly the largest single quantity of marijuana 
ever confiscated while being smuggled into Macedonia. The street value 
of one gram of marijuana is priced around dlrs 3 in Macedonia, bringing 
the estimated total of the haul's worth to dlrs 1.5 million. The truck 
driver was immediately arrested but his identity has not been revealed, 
Macedonian state radio reported. Macedonian police announced that 
Prime Minister Ljubco Georgievski will hold a press conference later 
Thursday at the border crossing where the bust was made.
