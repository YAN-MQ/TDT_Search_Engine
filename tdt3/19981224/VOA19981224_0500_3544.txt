Well, it is another Christmas note here. Santa needs to go on a diet 
that is what a cardiologist named Jesus Yapp, of Stanford, Connecticut 
suggests. You know so many folks leave cocoa and cookies out for Santa 
and so he will have a little snack when he stops down and leaves the 
presents under your tree. And Dr. Yapp, is saying, neigh, neigh, do 
not leave Santa any cookies. Leave him some carrot sticks... no, no. 
...the guy is too heavy. no, no, no. That is what Dr. Yapp is saying... 
Although I, I have to admit I did put on some weight when my kids 
were little.
