Watching children unwrap their presents is a joy of Christmas. Another 
joyful tradition is watching them put on Christmas pageants. Gloria 
Hillard visits some kids who're getting into the spirit of the season. 
Now, either mom got carried away with wrapping, or it's the annual 
Christmas pageant. Oh, sometimes, I got stage fright like five times 
in my life before. Good evening, ladies and gentleman. Well, like, 
this is my second time being in stage fright. Backstage, it looked 
like a rummage sale. We're shepherds! a scarf on a head, a bathrobe, 
and you've got a -- Shepherd that just came out of the jacuzzi. You 
wear a robe or you wear a scarf or a cap or sheet. With some high 
heels. Now, you're probably wondering what kind of Shepherd wears 
high heels. It's like an Angel. No wonder they're tall. An Angel is 
something that goes up there and watches over you. While the santas 
rapped, the wrapped presents watched, while in the wings, visions 
of -- Presents. Danced in their heads. And on the stage, the presents 
-- well, it must have seemed like Christmas morning -- they kept opening. 
How can you have Santa's phone number? What's Santa's phone number, 
Kimberly? Mommy has it. I don't have it. There's Santa's number. And 
this Santa number -- laughing all the way ha-ha-ha ha-ha-ha Take two. 
And so the story went. Joseph took off with baby Jesus. And hark, 
the Herald Angel Sang off Mike. And the shepherds Sang -- and Sang 
-- and Sang -- for God so loved the world everlasting love Gloria 
Hillard, "CNN Entertainment News," Los angeles.
