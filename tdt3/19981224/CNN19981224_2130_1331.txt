The Vikings know a good thing when they see it. A 14-1 record has 
led to Minnesota extending the contracts of quarterback randall Cunningham 
and tackle Corey stringer each by five years. It's something that 
I am satisfied that I'm not going to say in the future and say, "wow, 
I should be making more." Or this or that. I'm content with what God 
has blessed me with through the Vikings. And I'm very happy with it.
