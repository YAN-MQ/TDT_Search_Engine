Australian cricket bowler, Glen McGraph, is expected to be ready for 
the fourth ashes test match against England Saturday. Despite being 
sidelined recently with a virus. McGraph complained of the illness 
nine days ago at the end of the third test match in Ataly. Australian 
captain, Mark Taylor, said Thursday that after some time off, McGraph 
is feeling much better. Meanwhile, England's team is expected to spend 
Christmas Day practicing in temperatures around 37 degrees. More than 
70,000 fans are expected to crowd the Meldon Cricket Ground when the 
Boxing Day tests get underway on Saturday. Australia has already retained 
the ashes by taking a two-nothing lead in the best five match series. 
The first test was a draw. And that is sports, I am Dave Byrd.
