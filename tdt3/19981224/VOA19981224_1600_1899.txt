An appeals court in Iran has upheld a conviction on corruption charges 
of the former mayor of Tehran, a close ally of reformist President, 
Muhammad Atomed. However, the Court has considerably reduced his punishment, 
as we hear in this report from Middle East correspondent, Scott Bond. 
The Tehran Court Thursday, reduced the prison sentence of former mayor, 
Golam Hussein Gotobaschef, from five to two years. And cut in half 
his 20-year ban from politics. The Court also reduced the punishment 
of 60 lashes to a fine of $10 million rieals or about $3,000. It upheld, 
however, other fines totaling one-half million dollars. Mr. Gotobaschef's 
conviction last July on charges of embezzlement sparked violent demonstrations 
in Tehran. He appealed saying the charges were part of a campaign 
by hard lined conservatives against reforms of Iran's President, Muhammad 
Cutaveif. During his eight years as mayor, Mr. Gotobaschef built parks 
an social centers and tried to reduce pollution. But he ran afoul 
of powerful business interests for raising taxes. Scott Bond, VOA 
News, Middle East Bureau.
