And Isuzu Motors of Japan says it will cut its work force by 4,000, 
slash its debts, and boost profitability. That announcement came less 
than a week after General Motors said it will invest an additional 
$450 million in Isuzu stock. That will raise GM's ownership of Isuzu 
to 49 percent. Breck Artery, VOA News, New York. Thank you, Breck.
