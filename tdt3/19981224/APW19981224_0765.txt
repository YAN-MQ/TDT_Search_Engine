Yasser Arafat's helicopter landed in Bethlehem on Christmas Eve _ 
delayed by a manhunt for a Palestinian fugitive but still in time 
for celebrations in the town of Jesus' birth. Troubles intruded on 
holiday celebrations elsewhere in the world, too, with refugees of 
Hurricane Mitch finding Christmas spirit hard to come by and Christians 
in Indonesia shaken by attacks on churches. Still, the sacred business 
of celebration took precedence for many Christians. Christmas was 
being reborn in Cuba, and Pope John Paul II was to deliver his Christmas 
Eve Mass homily from St. Peter's Basilica. Even the dragnet in the 
town of Jesus' birth could not dampen festivities. Boy Scout bagpipe 
bands marched throughout the day, and crowds of well-wishers _ along 
with mounted Palestinian police _ greeted the Latin patriarch, Michel 
Sabbah. As soon as darkness fell, the snap and sparkle of firecrackers 
filled Manger Square _ despite pleas by Mayor Hanna J. Nasser, who 
says such displays are inappropriate at Christmas. Bethlehem was handed 
from Israeli to Palestinian rule just before Christmas 1995, and the 
fireworks were a celebration of independence. Heather Taylor, a 25-year-old 
teacher from Winnsboro, Texas, said she didn't mind the intrusion: 
``I'm here to be near to the place of the person I love, the Savior 
I love.'' Decorum was to come later in the evening with Midnight Mass 
in the Church of St. Katherine, next to the fourth-century Church 
of the Nativity that was built on the traditional birthplace of Jesus. 
A 10-foot by 10-foot television screen was set up for the overflow. 
The nationalist tone of previous Christmases in a Bethlehem under 
Palestinian authority has been played down: Instead of the 2-story-high 
portrait Arafat of earlier years, smaller depictions of the Palestinian 
leader were hanging from streamers over Manger Square. A manhunt for 
Jamil Jadala, a Bethlehem native accused of involvement in the October 
killings of two Israelis, was still under way when Arafat arrived 
in Bethlehem early Thursday evening. Arafat is under pressure from 
Israel to contain political violence, and Jadala's escape from a Nablus 
jail earlier this week has embarrassed him. Bethlehem police surrounded 
his house after receiving a tip he had returned to his hometown. Arafat 
was 45 minutes late to the Christmas festivities because the manhunt 
required security rearrangements. Tensions intruded into Christmas 
celebrations elsewhere in the world, but festivities were not lost: 
_In Jakarta, Indonesia's Christian leaders appealed for racial and 
religious harmony following recent attacks by Muslim mobs on Christian 
churches. Rising social and religious tension has rocked a nation 
struggling through its worst economic crisis in three decades. _In 
the Kuwaiti desert, 1,000 U.S. Marines in the region to meet any Iraqi 
threat, tried to make the best of Christmas Eve in the desert. Cpl. 
Robert Katz of New Rochelle, N.Y., said Christmas was about being 
with the people dearest to your heart, and ``we're all friends and 
family here.'' _On the others side of the Kuwait-Iraq border, President 
Saddam Hussein delivered a Christmas message, saying recent U.S. and 
British airstrikes on Iraq violated the teachings of Jesus. He called 
on all believers to ``face up to these criminals.'' Eight years of 
U.N. sanctions has limited celebrations among Iraq's Christian minority. 
Still, Faris Boutros Mehdi shopped for presents to put beneath his 
small, bare, plastic Christmas tree. A bottle of perfume for his girlfriend 
cost him nearly $15, about half his monthly salary. _In some Central 
American towns, Hurricane Mitch wiped out the holiday entirely. ``What 
Christmas?'' asked Gregorio Sanchez, who lives with his wife and five 
children in a dirt-floor shelter of plastic in Posoltega, Nicaragua, 
alongside hundreds of other refugees. _In Havana, however, Cubans 
crowded markets to buy pork roasts and other traditional foods for 
a Christmas made especially festive by the recent reinstatement of 
Dec. 25 as a permanent holiday.
