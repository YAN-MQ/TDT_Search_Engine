Canadian police have freed an 18-year-old girl kidnapped from her 
home 11 days ago for ransom. The teen-ager was found bound and gagged 
in the trunk of a car Tuesday night, the same night two men were arrested 
while driving around in separate cars in the Vancouver suburb of Richmond. 
Gary Chong, 21, and Chi Wai Chan, 24, appeared in provincial court 
Wednesday charged with kidnapping, unlawful confinement and sexual 
assault. It was unclear how police found the teen-ager. A publication 
ban has been placed on the proceedings. Police said they were still 
looking for at least one other suspect. After she was found, the teen-ager 
was taken to Richmond Hospital and later transferred to Vancouver 
General Hospital. She was released Wednesday. ``She's in terrible 
shape,'' said police spokesman Sgt. Willy Laurie. ``She was very seriously 
traumatized ... she was treated poorly.'' The teen-ager was kidnapped 
Dec. 11 when a group of armed men forced themselves into her home 
in Richmond. She is the only child of a Hong Kong couple who immigrated 
to Canada four years ago. The men dragged the girl out of the house 
and warned her mother not to call police or they would harm the girl, 
Laurie said. Despite the threat, the family called police. A few hours 
later, the kidnappers called the family back and demanded a ransom 
in ``the mid six-figures,'' Laurie said. The amount demanded was more 
than the family could pay, he said.
