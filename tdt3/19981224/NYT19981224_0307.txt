Osama bin Laden, whom U.S. intelligence authorities consider one of 
the world's most dangerous terrorists, has denied that he had any 
role in the deadly bombings of two American embassies in Africa. ``I 
was not involved in the bomb blasts, but I don't regret what happened 
there,'' bin Laden told the Taliban rulers of Afghanistan, The Associated 
Press said. The AP said it had obtained its information from an independent 
Pakistani news agency, which spoke to the Taliban. Bin Laden said 
he knew some of the men suspected in the Aug. 7 bombings in Kenya 
and Tanzania, which killed more than 250 people and wounded several 
thousand. ``These are two men whom we respect and hold in the highest 
esteem,'' he said through an interpreter in a separate interview broadcast 
tonight by ABC News. Bin Laden did not specify which two men he was 
talking about. The federal authorities have indicted at least 14 people, 
including bin Laden, in their investigation of the embassy bombings 
and what investigators have called a global terrorist organization. 
They also suspect bin Laden of financing the 1996 bombing of an American 
military apartment complex in Saudi Arabia in which 19 servicemen 
were killed and several hundred people wounded. Bin Laden told his 
interviewers that he was not at his Afghanistan headquarters and training 
camp when the United States attacked with cruise missiles on Aug. 
20 in retaliation for the embassy bombings. A pharmaceutical plant 
in the Sudan that administration officials said was believed to be 
involved in chemical weapons production for bin Laden was also hit. 
About two dozen people were killed in the two missile attacks. Just 
after the missile strikes, bin Laden said, he survived an assassination 
plot ordered by a prince in Saudi Arabia, which expelled bin Laden 
nearly a decade ago. ``They were offered large sums of money in return 
for assassinating me, but I was not hurt,'' he said. Wearing camouflage 
garb and seated in a tent that ABC News said had been set up in the 
Afghan wilderness for the interview on Wednesday night, bin Laden 
renewed his fatwa, or religious decree calling for attacks on the 
United States and Israel. ``We are confident that the Muslim nation 
would rid Islamic countries of the Americans and the Jews,'' he said. 
The interview, which ABC News said was conducted by Ramiullah Yusufzi, 
its news producer in Pakistan, was bin Laden's first public appearance 
since the August attacks, but it produced no surprises. Asked about 
suspicions that he is trying to obtain chemical and nuclear weapons, 
he said: ``If I seek to acquire such weapons, this is a religious 
duty. How we use them is up to us.''
