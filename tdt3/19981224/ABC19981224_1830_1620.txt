Finally this evening -- a little holiday cheer from the streets of 
New York. A way to combat the tension of last minute shopping. This 
is Mike zappulla, and we New Yorkers appreciate that he takes much 
of the tension out of Christmas shopping. He works outside lord & 
Taylor's on fifth avenue, getting taxis for last-minute shoppers. 
And doing it with a personal touch. Watch your coat. Those of you 
outside New York will have to take me at my word. You can't get a 
cab on the days before Christmas on fifth avenue. Mike can. It's great. 
If I could buy that whistle, I'd take it somewhere for a Christmas 
present. It's brilliant. Somebody else is taking my taxi. Get out 
there and whistle again. Welcome sounds amid the cacophony that is 
Christmas in New York. Happy and healthy holiday. And not once did 
we or he use the words whistle while you work.
