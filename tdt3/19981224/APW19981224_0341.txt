Two workers were killed and one was hospitalized with severe burns 
after a fire in a pottery plant in eastern Ukraine, a news agency 
reported Thursday. A fourth worker was missing. The fire at the plant 
in the village of Budy, in the Kharkiv region, broke out Wednesday 
evening and raged for more than four hours in the plant's packing 
house, the Interfax news agency said. Another plant worker was still 
missing after firemen put out the flames, which damaged a 620 square 
meter (6,674 square yard) area and cost the plant around 900,000 hryvna 
(dlrs 263 million). Plant officials have not yet determined the cause 
of the fire.
