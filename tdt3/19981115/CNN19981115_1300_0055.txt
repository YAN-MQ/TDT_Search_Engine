Diplomacy may have prevailed in the Persian gulf, but the United States 
plans to maintain a military force in the region, just in case. President 
Clinton announced today the United States will accept Iraq's latest 
pledge to allow U.N. weapons inspectors back into the country and 
to do their jobs without any restrictions. But Mr. Clinton hinted 
one more broken promise, and Baghdad will face a "Without-warning" 
military attack. The United States actually launched an attack yesterday, 
but it was aborted after Iraq made a diplomatic overture. Today's 
agreement also requires Iraq to accept all United Nations resolutions 
regarding weapons of mass destruction, and to turn all relevant documents 
over to the U.N. Mr. Clinton says there's a clear advantage to a Diplomatic 
solution. As I have said since this crisis began, the return of the 
inspectors, if they can operate in an unfettered way, is the best 
outcome, because they have been and they remain the most effective 
tool to uncover, destroy and prevent Iraq from rebuilding its weapons 
of mass destruction and the missiles to deliver them.
