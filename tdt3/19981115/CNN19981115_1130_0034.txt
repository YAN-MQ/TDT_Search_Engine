Diplomacy carried the day once again in the Persian gulf. President 
Clinton just announced the United States will accept Iraq's latest 
promise to let U.N. weapons inspectors back into the country with 
no conditions. But administration officials are said to remain deeply 
skeptical of Iraqi president, Saddam Hussein, and U.S. aparently plans 
to continue the military buildup in the region. Plus, the next time 
Baghdad breaks its promise, the U.S. will apparently take immediate 
military action without warning. The agreement comes about 24 hours 
after Mr. Clinton ordered an attack, which was aborted with Iraq's 
initial diplomatic overture yesterday. The United States, together 
with Great Britain and with the is up prt of our friends around the 
world, was poised to act militarily if Iraq had not reversed course. 
Our willingness to strike, together with the overwhelming weight of 
world opinion produced the outcome we preferred, Saddam Hussein reversing 
course, leting the inspectors go back to work without restrictions 
or conditions. U.S. military forces continue to deploy to the Persian 
gulf region, despite iraq's diplomatic overtures. Secretary of state 
Madeleine Albright says the military option still is on the table. 
Pentagon sources say President Clinton ordered a cruise missile strike 
against Iraq yesterday, but the strike was called off after Iraq offered 
to resume cooperation with the U.N.
