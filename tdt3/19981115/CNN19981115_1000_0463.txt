They're cleaning up in Jakarta, Indonesia, today after a week of student-led 
protests that killed at least 12 people. Officials there are holding 
several people in custody in connection with looting and arson. Several 
businesses were looted and burned yesterday. A military spokesman 
says certain elements in Indonesia's society took advantage of student 
protests to cause trouble. The students were demanding the government 
make more democratic reforms.
