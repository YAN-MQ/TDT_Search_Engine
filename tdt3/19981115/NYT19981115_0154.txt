They were, surely, the lads of destiny. Yes, it was only halftime 
of the 10th game of the season, but, hey, let's start making reservations 
for when we check into Miami for the Super Bowl in two months. The 
Jets, at 6-3 and tied for the East lead in the American Football Conference, 
and winners of four consecutive games, had on the last play of the 
first half in the RCA Dome Sunday gone ahead of the Colts, 23-10. 
And this was no ordinary play. It had demonstrated conclusively that 
they had suddenly become the darling of the dieties, no? Aaron Glenn, 
the Jets' kick-return specialist, had executed a 104-yard, 17-second 
run from not only one end zone to the other, but virtually from one 
sideline to the other. With a second to go in the half, he had grabbed 
a 63-yard field-goal attempt by Mike Vanderjagt which fell short of 
the yellow uprights. The Colts chased and fell and stumbled and missed 
tackle after tackle as Glenn, at 5 feet 9 inches and with the moves 
of a New York taxi driver, swept into the end zone. But the coach 
of the Jets, Bill Parcells, is no dummy. He was obviously aware that 
his personnel might have been believing that this game was in the 
bag, that the lowly Colts, at 1-8 for the season, understood that 
they were no match for the big, bad, bodacious Jets. Maybe he caught 
a few players admiring their triumphant visages in the locker-room 
mirrors. Maybe even in the back of the helmeted minds of those Jets 
with a sense of history, they remembered that 30 years ago this season 
_ before many of them were even born _ the Jets with Joe Namath stunned 
the football world by upsetting the heavily favored Colts to win Super 
Bowl III. At halftime, Parcells went over adjustments as is conventional. 
And since Parcells is far from stupid, he said to the team just before 
it went through the door to the field: ``How would you guys feel if 
they came back to beat you?'' This was not question and answer, of 
course. It was a warning: Be overconfident at your peril. Turned out 
to be more than a warning. It was an omen. It was, well, Domesday. 
The Jets never scored again in the game. But, oh, how fickle may be 
the index finger of fate. For the Colts scored 14 points in the second 
half and beat the Jets, 24-23. Not only that, but the Colts made an 
excruciating 80-yard touchdown drive in the last three minutes of 
the game _ scoring on a 14-yard pass with 30 seconds left _ to reverse 
their fortunes which had looked so bleak only slightly earlier in 
the afternoon. Perhaps the Jets had, like Talmudic scholars, spent 
so much time studying their glowing press clippings of late that they 
forgot certain fundamentals, like blocking and tackling. ``All that 
stuff in the papers fattened us up for this loss,'' said Bryan Cox, 
the linebacker. ``It showed the immaturity of our team.'' ``We couldn't 
tackle and we couldn't catch the ball,'' Parcells said. ``It makes 
me sick.'' ``We should have known,'' said Ernie Logan, the Jets' right 
tackle, ``that a two-touchdown lead in this league is nothing.'' But 
what about Parcells' admonition? ``I didn't think about it,'' Glenn 
said. ``I mean, I didn't think they'd come back.'' So here were the 
rookie Colts quarterback Peyton Manning showing the poise of Namath 
in the crunch, Marshall Faulk running the way Matt Snell once had, 
and Marcus Pollard and Marvin Harrison snaring passes like Don Maynard 
and George Sauer _ wait a minute, but those guys Sunday were wearing 
blue and white, not the green and white of those hallowed Jets of 
yesteryear. And try as they might, nothing the current crop of Jets 
did could recreate once-upon-a-time _ not the previous 30 years, nor 
the previous 30 minutes. The sad capper came when, with 30 seconds 
to go in the fourth quarter, tight end Pollard caught Manning's pass 
on about the 3-yard line. Otis Smith, the cornerback, threw his arms 
around Pollard, like a long-lost brother come home from the sea. But 
Pollard pulled Smith into the end zone for the killer touchdown. ``What 
I thought at that moment?'' Smith said. ``I thought, `I gotta get 
stronger. I gotta get back into the weight room.''' It was symbolic 
of the second-half tackling futility. Someone, seemingly trying to 
ease his anguish, suggested to Smith that some of those Colts were 
very good at breaking tackles. ``But we gotta know how to break the 
tackle-breakers,'' he said, irrefutably. Parcells was smart enough 
to take two teams to three Super Bowls and win a pair of them. He 
took over the forlorn Jets after a 1-15 season two years ago and now 
has made contenders of them _ despite Sunday's second half. ``This 
is a big loss,'' he said. ``I'm very disappointed. It's a step backward.'' 
He added, ``We have to go forward and get back on track.'' If history 
is judge of a Parcells team, the chances of that happening are good. 
For starters, though, he may have to hide them from any future rave 
notices. Maybe remove the mirrors in the locker room, too.
