They were sentenced to die, but were later found wrongly convicted. 
Patty Davis reports on a gathering of former prisoners who are working 
to change the justice system. Rolando Cruz is haunted by the memories. 
I prayed in the morning that I would be able to go to sleep at night. 
And at night, I prayed I'd be able to wake up in the morning. Memories 
of time served on Illinois' death row. Cruz was convicted twice and 
sentenced to death for the rape and murder of 10-year-old jeanine 
nicarico. More than 12 years later, the courts set Cruz free and indicted 
four county police officers and three prosecutors for allegedly lying 
and concealing evidence in the case. Another man, a convicted child 
killer, has confessed he alone killed the young girl. What was it 
like? Well, it was worse than hell. I think I'd rather go to hell 
and meet satan than have to go back to death row. Cruz and dozens 
of former death row inmates gathered in Chicago saturday, the main 
attraction at northwestern University's conference on wrongful convictions. 
They are fighting for changes to the death penalty. 75 death row inmates 
have been exonerated and freed since the United States Supreme Court 
reinstated the death penalty just over 20 years ago. More than 3,500 
people now await execution on the nation's death rows. Rolando Cruz's 
attorney is the force behind the conference. There are people on death 
row, hundreds of people on death row today who are innocent and who 
will be killed unless they are lucky enough, as Cruz was, to have 
the true killer confess in time. Critics dispute that. They say the 
courts do work. It's as certain as anything can be in the criminal 
justice system that only the guilty are being executed. This is just 
an attempt on the part of some -- some people with agendas to, like 
I said, weaken public support for the death penalty. The latest CNN/"USA 
today" Gallup poll found 54% favor capital punishment. As for rolando 
Cruz, his death warrant -- now framed -- serves as a daily reminder 
of his new mission in life. I know my path in life leads to trying 
to straighten out this judicial system. I have to. He's now speaking 
out -- I am who I am now because this is who they made me. Thank you. 
-- to make sure what happened to him doesn't happen to anyone else.
