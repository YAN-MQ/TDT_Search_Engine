Pacific Rim nations failed on Sunday to reach an agreement on the 
terms a massive trade pact to cut tariffs in nine key industries. 
The 21 members of the Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation forum said 
they would now submit the trade proposal to the World Trade Organization 
for resolution. The pact would lift tariffs on dlrs 1.5 trillion in 
global trade. Trade and foreign ministers from the APEC meeting over 
the weekend in the Malaysia capital had hoped to conclude the pact 
for APEC leaders to sign during their summit meeting Tuesday and Wednesday. 
But the leaders will now be requested to approve a ministers' statement 
asking the WTO to try to do that instead. ``I think the financial 
crisis has had a chilling effect on the package that we put together 
last year,'' said Canadian Trade Minister Sergio Marchi. ``There's 
not enough of a critical mass here. So the package essentially goes 
to the WTO, and ultimately to New Zealand,'' where APEC leaders will 
meet next year, Marchi said. APEC leaders in Vancouver, Canada, last 
year agreed to reduce tariffs in nine sectors by 2002, as a start 
toward APEC's ultimate goal of free trade in the Pacific by 2020. 
But that was before Japan and the United States, the world's two largest 
economies, began arguing over some provisions. Japan has refused to 
cut border taxes in two sensitive areas _ forestry products and fish 
_ at a time when its economy is in its worst recession since World 
War II. The United States believed that Japan had to be on board in 
all nine sectors to give the pact weight. Washington had argued that 
it would send a strong signal that Asia was not turning protectionist, 
despite its worst economic crisis in 50 years. ``The basis for the 
choice was that every APEC economy gains something, every APEC economy 
would have to give something. But overall those nine sectors provided 
APEC as a whole significant balance,'' U.S. Trade Representative Charlene 
Barshefsky told a news conference. ``Obviously the United States would 
have wished that Japan, as all of the other countries, had agreed 
to cut tariffs now on fish and forestry,'' she said. Japan emphasized 
that APEC ground rules say the trade-pact was ``voluntary'' and said 
it believed each country was free to pick and choose the parts of 
the accord it would go along with. Japanese Minister of Foreign Affairs, 
Masahiko Komura said Sunday's decision adhered to the ``principles 
of volunteerism'' and would ``further advance global trade liberalization.'' 
But at a briefing for Tokyo press, a Japanese government official 
expressed relief. ``We managed to protect the two sectors,'' said 
the official who spoke on condition of anonymity. The official said 
Japan doesn't regard the ``WTO process'' to be implemented next year 
as ``actual negotiations,'' suggesting that the country won't be bound 
by any pact until the next round of WTO negotiations start in 2000. 
Nevertheless, the Philippines foreign minister, Domingo Siazon, said 
it was unfair to characterize the lack of an agreement as a failure. 
``What you cannot finalize here, you pass onto the WTO,'' Siazon said. 
Thai Foreign Minister Surin Pitsuwan also refused to call the trade 
pact a setback because Japan was not fully on board. ``In the spirit 
of realism, APEC has reached a decision that everybody can live with,'' 
he said. ``We will have to count on it as another success that we 
can build on at the next APEC meeting.'' APEC comprises Australia, 
Brunei, Canada, Chile, China, Hong Kong, Indonesia, Japan, South Korea, 
Malaysia, Mexico, New Zealand, Papua New Guinea, the Peru, Philippines, 
Russia, Singapore, Taiwan, Thailand, the United States and Vietnam.
