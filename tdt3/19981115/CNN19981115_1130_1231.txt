Week 11 in the NFL features eight early games. In Atlanta, first place 
in the NFC west is on the line. San Fran visits a jam-packed Georgia 
dome -- the first sellout in three years. For the falcons to overcome 
Steve young and company, they must follow olivia Newton-John's lead 
and get physical. You smack 'em around the first half, first quarter, 
you can smack 'em around the rest of the game. 'cause you know, as 
a winning team, that's how you are. That's your mentality. We have 
to start fast, and we have to protect the ball. Error-free ball. And 
we gotta smack 'em in the mouth. That's gonna be critical to our success. 
Critical to the Vikings' success is a productive Randall cunningham. 
He will start against Cincinnati less than a week after undergoing 
knee surgery. If Randall has problems, look for Jay fiedler to see 
some action, as Brad johnson is out with a broken finger.
