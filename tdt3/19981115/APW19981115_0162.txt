The United Nations has delayed returning its relief workers to Baghdad 
because of continuing debate in the U.N. Security Council over the 
weapons inspection crisis, a U.N. official said Sunday. There had 
been reports from New York on Saturday that the 150 U.N. humanitarian 
workers evacuated last week to the Jordanian capital Amman would begin 
moving back here on Sunday. But the Security Council was unable to 
conclude its discussions on Iraq's offer to renew cooperation with 
the weapons inspectors, and a further session was scheduled Sunday. 
``Because of the extended deliberations in the Security Council, it 
has been decided that the staff should remain in Amman for the time 
being,'' U.N. spokesman Eric Falt told reporters. ``Of course, we 
are anxious to have them return as soon as possible and to return 
to full operations as soon as possible.'' The evacuations last Wednesday 
and Thursday reduced the U.N. relief staff in Baghdad to about 55 
people. An additional 230 U.N. humanitarian workers remain in the 
north supervising aid to Iraqi Kurds. They monitor the U.N.-approved 
oil-for-food program. It is an exception from U.N. sanctions that 
allows Iraq to sell limited amounts of crude oil to buy needed food 
and medicine. The food is distributed as monthly rations to Iraq's 
22 million people. The program also was set back with the British-headquartered 
Lloyds Register evacuated its workers. Lloyds must certify incoming 
shipments at border points or suppliers don't get paid. ``The United 
Nations is concerned by the implications of the absence of personnel 
at the four border points, and we are in touch with our parties to 
find a solution either through Lloyds or through other venues,'' Falt 
said. He said lines of trucks were forming at the Zakho border entry 
point from Turkey. More than half of food shipments come in at Iraq's 
southern port of Umm Kasr, Falt said. They also enter at Trabil on 
the Jordanian border and Al-Waleed on the Syrian border, he said. 
He said there were no signs of shortages and that food distribution 
was continuing smoothly. U.N. food stocks are ``fairly satisfactory,'' 
he added.
