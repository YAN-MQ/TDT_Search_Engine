Rep.-elect Tom Tancredo flashed a good, long smile for posterity on 
the steps of the Capitol as he huddled with his freshmen cohorts, 
but the usual exhilaration was not altogether there. ``I feel like 
the dog who caught the car,'' joked Tancredo, a Republican state legislator 
from Colorado, about his election to a House of Representatives that 
is engulfed in all sorts of intrigue and chaos. Truth be told, the 
past two weeks have brought changes that few of the incoming 40 House 
freshmen, especially the 17 Republicans, expected when they decided 
to make a run for Congress. The speaker of the House, Rep. Newt Gingrich, 
R-Ga., is out, the victim of Republican discontent. A politician they 
know next to nothing about, Rep. Robert Livingston, R-La., is taking 
his place. Meanwhile, the Republican caucus is warring over who will 
lead it into 2000. And, to top it all off, impeachment, a word most 
of them liken to a guillotine, is still dangling over their heads 
in search of a few unsuspecting victims. ``I would like to see that 
dealt with swiftly,'' said Ken Lucas, a Kentucky Democrat who represents 
a district where being a Democrat is not necessarily an asset. Judy 
Biggert, a moderate Chicago-area Republican, nodded her head in agreement. 
``I certainly would like it to be over,'' she said, with mock exasperation, 
``because of what we heard from the voters.'' And because of something 
else, too. Long, long ago, before Monica Lewinsky became a household 
word, Ms. Biggert made the error of expressing interest in a seat 
on the House Judiciary Committee, a panel that members appear to be 
shunning in droves since the impeachment inquiry landed on its lap. 
Nobody, it seems, has forgotten her words. ``We'll let you have it,'' 
said Ms. Biggert, a state legislator, relaying the chorus of ribbing 
her freshmen colleagues have been giving her all day. ``I figured 
this was a great committee. I don't know now.'' Little, so far, has 
played out as she had pictured, Ms. Biggert said, starting with the 
post-election rest and relaxation she envisioned once the Champagne 
ran dry. Instead, she has been bombarded with telephone calls from 
House members who are running in this week's leadership race, and 
their allies. ``I got at least one call from each,'' Ms. Biggert said, 
``and voice mails that went on and on.'' This is not the revolutionary 
freshman class of 1994, with its outside-the-Beltway novices and conservative 
bravado. In fact, the voters have produced a crop of seasoned legislators, 
23 Democrats and 17 Republicans, in all. Fifteen of them come directly 
from state legislatures, 27 have held elected office at some time 
and three are former Capitol Hill aides. There are a few exceptions. 
One new member is a doctor; another is a clinical psychologist. And 
Rush Holt, the Democrat who unseated Rep. Mike Pappas, R-N.J., is 
a physicist and a five-time champion on the television game show ``Jeopardy.'' 
It is seldom difficult to spot a new member of Congress, and this 
class is no different: They are the ones who squint up at the Capitol's 
white-washed beauty, their mouths slightly agape, or who find themselves 
trapped at the end of a dead-end basement corridor with a cluster 
of equally befuddled tourists. They are also refreshingly straightforward. 
``I'm a businessman,'' said Douglas Ose, the millionaire Republican 
real estate developer from California who replaced a retiring Democrat, 
Rep. Vic Fazio. ``I've never been in office. I don't know how to count 
votes. Big majority, small majority. Come on.'' They also do not expect 
much, maybe an office ``with a roof on it,'' Ose said. ``Give me something 
in the basement. That's fine.'' Friday's first day of orientation 
was accompanied by a dose of typical confusion. The future members 
learned that they, unlike everyone else, do not have to walk through 
metal detectors. They puzzled-out the fact that meetings tend to drone 
on and on, and that lunch is usually as glamorous inside these staley 
rooms as a chicken salad. Mike Simpson, a freshman from Idaho who 
served two terms as speaker of the House in the state Legislature, 
caused a stir of his own as he ambled about with a name tag that mistakenly 
labeled him a Democrat. When he thanked Gingrich Sunday for holding 
a fund-raiser for him in Idaho, a shocked freshman Democrat who had 
noticed the word Demcrat on his lapel, asked incredulously, ``He did 
a fund-raiser for you?'' ``I said, `Yeah,''' Simpson said chuckling. 
``These Democrats want those six seats so badly,'' he said, referring 
to his name tag, ``they are willing to do anything.''
