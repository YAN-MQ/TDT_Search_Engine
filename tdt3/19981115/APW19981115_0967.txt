John McEnroe beat Mats Wilander of Sweden 6-0, 6-2 Sunday to reach 
the final of an ATP senior tournament in which Iranian Mansour Bahrami 
provided some humorous moments. Bahrami lost to Bjorn Borg 6-3, 6-4. 
On one point, when he couldn't reach a Borg serve, he took another 
ball from his pocket and ``returned'' it. Later, they staged a mock 
fight in front of the refrigerator over who would take the drinks 
first. The argument ended when Borg jokingly threw Bahrami into the 
refrigerator. Borg will play for third place in this robin-round tourney 
against Frenchman Henri Leconte, a 6-2, 6-3 winner over Guillermo 
Vilas of Argentina. Guy Forget of France will face McEnroe in Monday's 
final, even though he lost to Croatia's Goran Prpic 2-6, 6-4, 10-5. 
That's because Forget's overall results in the Croatia Classics tournament 
were better than Prpic's.
