Prime Minister Tony Blair said Sunday he gave orders to British warplanes 
to attack Iraq on Saturday, but the strike was called off when Iraq 
promised to allow U.N. weapons inspections unconditionally. ``This 
is not over until absolute and unconditional compliance is guaranteed 
and delivered,'' said Blair, speaking outside his Downing Street office 
after a stream of phone calls into the early hours with U.S. President 
Bill Clinton and U.N. officials. Blair said that unless Iraq delivered 
he would not hesitate to order strikes again. ``There will be no warning 
whatsoever,'' said Blair. In Washington, the U.S. Administration said 
Saturday that waves of American bombers had also headed toward the 
Gulf to strike. Blair's aides said British warplanes would have provided 
one-fifth of the air power for an allied attack on Saturday. Britain, 
America's most hawkish ally over Iraq, has sent 12 Tornado fighter-bombers 
to Kuwait, and has two antisubmarine frigates, HMS Cumberland and 
HMS Grafton in the Gulf region. HMS Grafton carries Sea Wolf and Harpoon 
missiles. ``This thing is not over yet, until we have every single 
bit of this bolted down and in place. We remain ready, willing and 
able to strike at any point in time,'' said Blair. ``The inspectors 
have got to carry out their work without any hindrance ... we know 
from our long experience that Saddam Hussein is not a person we can 
trust.'' Blair denied that Britain and the United States were out 
of step with other members of the U.N. Security Council _ less dismissive 
of an initial Iraqi letter which seemed to link the resumption of 
weapons inspections to ending U.N. sanctions. ``Without our preparedness 
to use force, Saddam Hussein would not be climbing down at all,'' 
said Blair. ``... There is no way we can allow him to develop these 
weapons of mass destruction.'' Blair spoke nine times with President 
Bill Clinton and other top U.S. officials through Saturday and the 
early hours Sunday, said a spokesman at his Downing Street office. 
Earlier, Foreign Secretary Robin Cook said that the ``basis of a decision 
is going to be, does Saddam mean this?'' Cook added that Saddam was 
the loser because he had to accept the return of U.N. weapons inspectors, 
the continuation of sanctions and know that if he breaks his word 
this time ``there will be a solidarity of support for international 
action.''
