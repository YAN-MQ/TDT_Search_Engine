This is Orelon Sidney with your "CNN Headline News Weather update." 
A persistent trough of low pressure will keep rain in the gulf coast 
states for Sunday. Look for showers and snow across portions of Maine, 
continuing northward into new Brunswick and Nova Scotia, as a frontal 
system moves off to the northeast. Two fronts in the central plains 
will mean cooler air across the plains states and the Rockies and 
a chance of snow in the central Great Lakes. A new frontal system 
moving into the northwest also generates a chance of rain and high-elevation 
snows across the northern Rockies. Temperatures will be on the chilly 
side today for most of central Canada into the lake superior and lake 
Michigan areas. Highs will only be in the 20s and 30s. Look for 40s 
and 50s across the eastern U.S., with 60s and 70s from the virginias 
down into Texas and across the southwest. The extended forecast on 
Tuesday includes heavy rainfall in the northwest, with snow and a 
mix of rain and snow for the Great Lakes to the chesapeake bay. Scattered 
thunderstorms are possible into Florida through Wednesday, and we'll 
see mostly a heavy mix in the Great Lakes Thursday. The extended forecast 
is at CNN.com.
