Traffic jams aren't just a big-city problem anymore. Researchers for 
the Texas transportation institute say their study of the 70 largest 
urban areas shows congestion in small and medium-sized cities is growing 
at a much faster rate than in big urban areas. Commuters in small 
and medium-sized cities are spending four times as long in traffic 
as they did in 1982. Suburbs with the highest congestion include Los 
Angeles, Washington, the miami area, Chicago and the San Francisco-Oakland 
area. Those suburbs least congested Bakersfield, California, Laredo, 
Texas, colorado springs, Colorado, Beaumont, Texas and corpus Christi, 
Texas.
