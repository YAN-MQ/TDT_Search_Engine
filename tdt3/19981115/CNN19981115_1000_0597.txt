They were sentenced to die but were later found wrongly convicted. 
Patty Davis reports on a gathering of former prisoners who are working 
to change the justice system. Rolando Cruz is haunted by the memories. 
I prayed in the morning I would be able to go to sleep at night. I 
prayed at night I would be able to wake up in the morning. Memories 
of time served on Illinois' death row. Cruz was convicted twice and 
sentenced to death for the rape and murder of 10-year-old jeanine 
nicarico. More than 12 years later, the courts set Cruz free and indicted 
four county police officers and three prosecutors for allegedly lying 
and concealing evidence in the case. Another man, a convicted child 
killer, has confessed he alone killed jeanine nicarico. What was it 
like? It was worse than hell. I think I'd rather go to hell and meet 
satan than go back to death row. Cruz and dozens of former death row 
inmates gathered in Chicago saturday, the main attraction at a northwestern 
University's conference on wrongful convictions. They are fighting 
for changes to the death penalty. 75 death row inmates have been exonerated 
and freed since the Supreme Court reinstated the death penalty just 
over 20 years ago. More than 3,500 people are now awaiting execution 
on the nation's death rows. Rolando Cruz's attorney is the force behind 
the conference. There are people on death row, hundreds of people 
on death row today who are innocent, who will be killed unless they 
are lucky enough as Cruz was to have the true killer confess in time 
-- in time being before they, themselves, are executed. Critics dispute 
that. They say the courts do work. It's as certain as anything can 
be, that only the guilty are being executed. This is an attempt on 
the part of people with agendas to, like I said, weaken public support 
for the death penalty. The latest CNN/"USA today" Gallup poll found 
54% favor capital punishment. As for rolando Cruz, his death warrant 
-- now framed -- serves as a daily reminder of his new mission in 
life. I know my path in life leads to trying to straighten out this 
judicial system. I have to. He's now speaking out. I am who I am today 
because of what they did to me. To make sure what happened to him 
doesn't happen to anyone else. Patty Davis, CNN, Chicago.
