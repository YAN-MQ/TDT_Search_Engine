Joining the small cadre of cable networks sticking their toes into 
the unclear waters of digital television, the A&AMP;E Network plans 
to announce two spinoff channels Monday, the Biography Channel and 
History Channel International, which will become widely available 
only when digital television does. The network's one-hour series ``Biography'' 
is one of the most successful series in cable television, so it made 
sense to start a Biography channel, said Nickolas Davatzes, president 
and chief executive of A&AMP;E Television Networks. Davatzes had originally 
planned a drama channel or a documentary channel. But research found 
that A&AMP;E's viewers thought the History Channel's perspective was 
too strictly American and wanted other viewpoints. ``The reality is 
we're a reflection of our culture,'' he said. ``We would see an event 
differently than the Brits would see it or the Japanese or the Brazilians 
would see it.'' Both new channels will be linked to World Wide Web 
sites, whose addresses will be featured on screen. Starting Monday, 
the channels will be available on a Tele-Communications Inc. service 
that reaches about a million homes. Davatzes said he hoped to make 
other distribution deals, but that real growth would depend on how 
quickly consumers bought digital television sets or set-top boxes 
and what networks cable operators made available. MTV, Nickelodeon, 
Fox Family Channel, Discovery Networks and a few others have also 
started spinoff channels geared for a time when today's 70 or 80 channels 
may multiply as much as fivefold.
