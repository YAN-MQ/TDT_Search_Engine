In Honduras and Nicaragua, they are still digging out from the devastation 
of hurricane Mitch. And now, a new danger is emerging from the mud. 
ABC's Mike Von Fremd reports that this threat is likely to be around 
for years. Everywhere, the cleanup effort is a back-breaking process, 
but along the nicaraguan/Honduran border it is terrifying. Tens of 
thousands of land Mines planted during the 1980s, primarily by the 
leftist government of Nicaragua, are now threatening farmers and peasants. 
In the torrential rains, everything, including land Mines, washes 
down the mountain to the river. And the problem is this is where the 
poor come to get water and wash their clothes. Already, one nicaraguan 
family has lost a loved one who stepped on a mine, and this man was 
blinded in an explosion. A group of American advisers who trained 
mine-clearing teams in Bosnia and afghanistan has flown here to help. 
They are military and law enforcement veterans, and they say that 
it could take as long as ten years to clear the Mines scattered over 
such a wide area by hurricane Mitch. Now, instead of doing 200,000 
square meters, we might have to do 200 million square meters, because 
everything has moved. These specially trained dogs can smell the explosive 
charge. And teams from Nicaragua, Honduras and costaica are now learning 
how to work with the animals. "We have to do this," this nicaraguan 
soldier says, "so that fewer people will die." It is a dangerous process, 
but Terry Fischer has lost only one dog in an explosion -- that was 
in Afghanistan. Here's what they do. A piece of Lint is dropped to 
determine the wind direction. The dog moves into the wind so he can 
smell the explosive before he steps on the mine. Then he sits to Mark 
the spot and waits for the command to carefully retrace his steps. 
The Mines are then dug up and detonated. It is a painstaking process, 
and in a region that has lost many of its homes, roads and bridges, 
the rebuilding cannot begin until many areas have been cleared of 
Mines. Mike Von Fremd, ABC News, tegucigalpa.
