Congo Foreign Minister Jean-Charles Okoto Lolakombe is to meet Monday 
with his South African counterpart, Foreign Minister Alfred Nzo, to 
discuss the Congo crisis, a foreign affairs spokesman said Sunday. 
Lolakombe, who recently criticized President Nelson Mandela for meeting 
Congo rebel leader Ernst Wamba dia Wamba, will meet Nzo at the Union 
Buildings in Pretoria early on Monday. Last week, Mandela met with 
Rwanda's Deputy President Paul Kagame, another foe of Congo's President 
Laurent Kabila. The spokesman, Marco Boni, said the talks would be 
a ``continuation of discussions aimed at securing a ceasefire''. African 
officials and heads of state have been crisscrossing the continent 
since August trying to bring an end to fighting in the Congo that 
now involves at least five outside countries.
