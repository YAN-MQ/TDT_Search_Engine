At the U.N. they're focusing on the present and not the future and 
resuming weapons inspections. NBC's Pat Dawson is at the headquarters 
where the security council met tonight. The security counsel meeting 
concluded moments ago and moments ago the secretary general wrote 
the official diplomatic conclusion to the latest crisis with Iraq. 
U.N. weapons inspectors will go back to Iraq and once again Saddam 
Hussein has promised that they'll be allowed complete access. It's 
a story the U.N. security council has heard before. This is a victory 
for all those who expressed their firm determination that United Nations 
security council resolutions must be respected. It is a vacatery for 
diplomacy and resolve. For the crisis to be put permanently behind 
us, Iraq must move swiftly to ensure complete and unconditional compliance. 
And that is the best way towards a lifting of the sanctions and the 
better life for the people of Iraq. But remember these are the kinds 
of agreements as I said that have been struck with Iraq before. Perhaps 
the most striking part of the secretary general's remarks as he concluded 
that meeting, he said that next time there may not be time for diplomatic 
appeals. Clearly signaling that perhaps there could be military action 
without any kind of action here at the United Nations. NBC's Pat Dawson 
at U.N. headquarters, thank you.
