Religious marriages will carry legal weight in Poland under a law 
starting Sunday that eliminates the communist-era necessity for an 
additional service before a state registrar. The decision follows 
a treaty between Poland and the Vatican that, among other provisions, 
called for legal status for religious marriages. Under the new law, 
a priest, pastor or rabbi must inform local registrars of a wedding 
within five days after the ceremony. Couples still need registrar 
certificates that they are free to marry and are at least 18, the 
legal age.
