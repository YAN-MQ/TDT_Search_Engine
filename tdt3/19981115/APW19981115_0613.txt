Despite a strong showing in the first round of Czech Senate elections, 
leaders of the main opposition party said Sunday they weren't assured 
of increasing their strength in Parliament. The Civic Democratic Party 
of ex-Premier Vaclav Klaus advanced the most candidates to the second 
round of any party competing in the Friday and Saturday elections. 
Updated results Sunday showed they had qualified for runoffs in 22 
of 27 districts. The governing Social Democrats are next with 15 candidates 
in next weekend's runoffs, a showing they called disappointing. A 
grouping of four opposition parties led by the Christian Democrats 
and Freedom Union finished third with 14 candidates, while Communist 
candidates made it in three districts. But no one received the majority 
needed to win outright victory, and Civic Democratic Party officials 
cautioned that the results were inconclusive and could be reversed 
in the next round, as in 1996. ``It was just the semifinals,'' Klaus 
said on Czech television. ``Nobody should rejoice too much.'' He said 
the first round did send a ``good signal for the future,'' as it did 
not confirm an anticipated turn to the left. The senatorial voting 
is considered a test of support for Prime Minister Milos Zeman's government, 
which took over from Klaus' party after elections in June. The stagnant 
Czech economy and poor law enforcement are among the top issues. A 
third of the seats in the 81-member Senate are at stake. The top two 
vote-getters in each district will face each other in the runoffs 
next Friday and Saturday. Turnout was 42 percent, 7 percent higher 
than in the first Senate elections in 1996. The Civic Democratic Party 
currently controls 29 seats in the Senate, 12 of them up for grabs 
in the vote. The Social Democrats have 26 senators, with six up for 
re-election. The rest of the seats are held by four smaller parties, 
including the Christian Democrats, Freedom Union and Communists. The 
Senate is by far the less important of the two legislative bodies 
in the Czech Republic, confirming or rejecting laws adopted by the 
lower chamber. Complete unofficial results from local elections, which 
also took place Friday and Saturday, showed that independent candidates 
fared well in small villages while the Civic Democratic Party led 
in big towns. Nationwide, independent candidates gained 57.1 percent, 
followed by the Christian Democrats with 11.8 percent and the Communists 
with 9.6 percent. The Civic Democratic Party finished fourth with 
9.5 percent. In the country's 13 biggest towns, the Civic Democratic 
Party won with 30.6 percent followed by the Social Democrats with 
22.5 percent. The turnout for local elections was 45 percent. More 
than 60,000 local posts were at stake. Official results are expected 
Monday.
