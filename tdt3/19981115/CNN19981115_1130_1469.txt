Some residents in northeast Thailand are looking to get a big boost 
from a Big event. Hundreds of elephants were brought together yesterday 
for an annual showcase of pachyderm skill. The jamboree featured the 
animals in races, playing tug-of-war and participating in games. Elephants 
were used for logging in the area, but the industry is in decline. 
The so-called "elephant roundup" is now a major source of income for 
the region.
