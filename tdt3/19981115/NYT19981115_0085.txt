HOLLYWOOD _ ``Meet Joe Black,'' the lavish three-hour film made by 
Universal Studios, opened over the weekend to poor reviews and a disappointing 
box office, increasing the expectations in the movie industry that 
the studio's owner, the Seagram Co., planned to oust Frank Biondi 
Jr., Universal's chairman and chief executive, and overhaul Universal's 
corporate structure. Entertainment industry executives close to Edgar 
Bronfman Jr., the chairman of Seagram, predicted Sunday that he would 
dismiss Biondi within the next few weeks, possibly earlier. At the 
same time, these executives said, Bronfman planned to revamp the corporate 
set-up so that various divisions like movies and music report directly 
to him. Previously, Biondi, who has had a troubled two-year reign 
at Universal, ran the entertainment divisions and was in charge of 
corporate strategy. ``At some point, the company has to bring clarity 
to the situation,'' said one top Universal executive. Another executive 
close to Bronfman said Bronfman was deeply angry at the lackluster 
performance of the film division, and may remove its top executive 
there, Casey Silver, as well as Biondi, a well-liked figure on Wall 
Street and in the entertainment business. ``The movie division is 
embarrassing to Edgar; he has to apologize at board meetings for it,'' 
said the executive, who also spoke on the condition of anonymity. 
A Universal spokesman said that the company would not comment on ``rumors 
and speculation.'' Biondi declined to comment. More than two years 
ago, Bronfman wanted Biondi enough to offer him a five-year deal valued 
at as much as $76 million. Biondi himself was not directly involved 
in the day-to-day operations of the movie side, leaving those responsibilities 
to Ron Meyer, his No. 2, and to Silver, who reported to Meyer. But 
Biondi's power in Universal was seriously diminished last fall when 
Bronfman unexpectedly sold most of Universal's television assets and 
its cable programming services to Barry Diller, chairman of USA Networks 
Inc., in exchange for stock in Diller's television company. Biondi's 
career was built on his television and cable expertise, first at Home 
Box Office and then at Viacom. At the same time, Biondi's responsibilities 
are being further limited by Seagram's planned acquisition of Polygram, 
the huge record company. That deal, which is expected be completed 
by the end of the year, will result in the consolidation of the Universal 
and Polygram music groups. By all accounts, Biondi's role in the deal 
was limited. ``What Frank oversaw changed in a dramatic way,'' one 
executive close to Bronfman said. Executives within Universal said 
Bronfman planned to alter the structure of the company so that he, 
essentially, would not only run the wine and spirits divisions but 
take over many of the responsibilities in entertainment now held by 
Biondi. Among the divisions set to report directly to Bronfman is 
the revived and successful music company, run by Doug Morris, former 
head of Warner Music, as well as the movie and amusement park divisions 
that will be placed in the hands of Meyer. The recent opening of ``Meet 
Joe Black'' has left a chill at Universal. The film cost at least 
$90 million _ and the studio has probably spent $30 million more to 
promote it. The reviews for the romantic drama, starring Brad Pitt 
and directed by Martin Brest, have been mostly devastating because 
of its three-hour length. On Friday, The Wall Street Journal called 
it ``a folly of epic proportions.'' The film came in third at the 
box office this weekend, earning about $15.6 million, lagging far 
behind ``The Waterboy,'' the Adam Sandler hit comedy, which took in 
$25.4 million in its second week, as well as ``I Still Know What You 
Did Last Summer,'' a new teen-age horror movie whose box office reached 
about $17.5 million. In fairness to Silver, who runs Universal Pictures, 
virtually every other studio in town would probably have approved 
``Meet Joe Black'' because of the clout of its star, Pitt, as well 
as the track record of its director, Brest, whose films include ``Beverly 
Hills Cop,'' and ``Scent of a Woman.'' But Universal seems to be facing 
additional difficulties with a second film, ``Babe, Pig in the City,'' 
which also cost at least $90 million. Although the family film is 
set to open over Thanksgiving, its Los Angeles premiere, set for Monday, 
was canceled because the movie is still unfinished. In contrast to 
entertainment giants like Time Warner and Disney, Universal, previously 
known as MCA, has been besieged by management turmoil and an uncertain 
strategy in the three and a half years since the giant liquor company 
bought 80 percent of MCA from the Matsushita Electric Industrial Co. 
for $5.7 billion. Seagram's stock has lagged, partly because of a 
downturn in its liquor business in Asia and also by worries about 
Universal.
