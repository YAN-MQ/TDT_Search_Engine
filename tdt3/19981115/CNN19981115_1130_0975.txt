Events in Iraq are affecting travel in the Middle East and one airline 
is expanding its operations. Lori Waffenschmidt has this and more 
in this edition of "working ahead." Due to increased tension in the 
Persian gulf, the U.S. state department advises Americans to consider 
departing Israel and Kuwait. We put out occasionally, travel warnings 
when the situation in an entire country is problematic and we recommend 
that people defer travel to that particular country. There is no indication 
how long the travel warning will be in effect. Head to the Internet 
at travel.state.gov for further updates.
