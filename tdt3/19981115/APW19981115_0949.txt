Michel Trudeau, son of former Canadian Prime Minister Pierre Trudeau, 
was missing and presumed drowned after an avalanche swept him and 
fellow skiers into a lake, police said Saturday. Trudeau, 23, was 
with three friends who were caught in the snow slide in British Columbia's 
Kootenay Mountains on Friday. The three others were picked up by helicopter 
Saturday after they made their way to shore. The Royal Canadian Mounted 
Police said Trudeau was last seen in the water and described the chances 
of finding him alive as ``very slim.'' ``It would appear he wasn't 
able to get to shore,'' said Cpl. Randy Koch. The former prime minister, 
who held power from 1968 to 1984 except for a nine-month gap, has 
two other sons, Sacha and Justin. He and his wife, Margaret, are divorced. 
The area where the accident occurred is popular with back country 
skiers, and there have been avalanche fatalities in the past. In January, 
six skiers were killed in an avalanche not far from the site of Friday's 
accident.
