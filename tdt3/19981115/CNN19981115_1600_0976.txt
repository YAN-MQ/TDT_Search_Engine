With the value of Internet stocks surging, investors are betting online 
shopping will really take off this holiday season. Bill Tucker has 
a look at the changing style of shopping online. Internet retailing, 
or E-tailing, is starting to take hold as a Real alternative to store-based 
buying and catalogs. Online marketing firm channelseven.com predicts 
Internet retail revenues will increase eightfold over the next four 
years. And visa released a study showing almost half of all shoppers 
this christmas plan to do some shopping online. This should be a good 
quarter to own these stocks. Advertising is very strong in the fourth 
quarter. There's a lot of excitement about Christmas. But definitely, 
these are highly volatile stocks. Shopping online is expected to more 
than double last year's figures, with revenues in '98 pushing $5 billion. 
Good money, but it's nowhere near the catalog companies. L.L. Bean 
had sales of more than $1 billion last year alone. And that's just 
one of 10,000 catalogs. This year, it's estimated that Americans will 
spend $87 billion from catalogs, and that's up from $81 billion last 
year. But if E-tailing is to really take off, there are a few hurdles 
to clear first, like easing fears about credit card security and building 
better shopping networks. Another one -- customer service. A recent 
survey by Jupiter communications of 125 top-rated web sites found 
that 42% took five days or longer to respond to E-mail inquiries -- 
that is, if they responded at all. Jupiter argues that the web should 
be setting new standards for customer service, because in cyberspace, 
the competition is just a click away. Bill Tucker, "CNN Financial 
News," New York.
