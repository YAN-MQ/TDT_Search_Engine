The U.N. security council is scheduled to reconvene this afternoon 
to consider Iraq's offer to avoid a military confrontation. The council 
adjourned shortly before midnight as Iraq tried to convince diplomats 
of its sincerity. The security council has been divided over Iraq's 
overture. Iraq's ambassador to the United Nations says he's optimistic. 
I think we've got a majority of the council members that do appreciate 
iraq's cooperation and appreciate Iraqi flexibility on trying to find 
a way out of this crisis, and I hope the council tomorrow will come 
up with a Forthcoming statement that could help out in the process 
of trying to reach out to a peaceful solution to the current situation. 
And I really hope that all the council members open up the door for 
something that could be constructive.
