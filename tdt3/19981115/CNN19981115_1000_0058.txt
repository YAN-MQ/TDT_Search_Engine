The White House says President Clinton will make an announcement on 
the crisis with Iraq in about half an hour in Washington. Mr. Clinton 
has been working overtime, talking with advisers and allies about 
Iraq's offer to let weapons inspectors return to work. A two-front 
approach has been keeping the administration busy today. On the one 
hand, U.S. military forces in the mideast remain on alert for possible 
missile and air strikes against Iraqi targets. On the diplomatic side, 
secretary of state Madeleine Albright is returning early from the 
apec summit in Malaysia. She'll meet with President Clinton about 
the next moves for the United States.
