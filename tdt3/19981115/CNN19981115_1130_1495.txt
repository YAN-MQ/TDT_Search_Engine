Actress roseanne's new talk show is not proving to be as big a hit 
as her former comedy series was. But roseanne says she's not giving 
up. Sherry Sylvester reports. It was supposed to be a homage -- -- 
to "all in the family" creator Norman lear. Do you want me to go like 
that? And Coolio and roseanne -- and you knew who you wanted -- finally 
Sang that tune. Those were the days But getting viewers to pick up 
the beat on her talk show is a Struggle. So far, a striptease from 
Stephen Baldwin, a duet with Bette Midler and barry manilow, and a 
smooch from Larry king have not been Nielsen hits. Kiss me like you 
did Marlon Brando. But roseanne loves the format. I feel like what's 
owed by people who haul barrels full of cash out of -- out of, like, 
the world, is to give something back in the way of hope and redemption 
and stuff, those kind of stories. She is offering barrels full of 
cash to hear Monica Lewinsky's story. I'm getting a little tired of 
waiting on Monica. Are we gonna get Monica or not? Probably not. While 
Britain's channel 4 is in negotiations for her overseas interview, 
lewinsky's stateside tell-all is to be determined. ABC News is reportedly 
the front-runner. Roseanne, through king world, has offered her more 
than $2 million. I truly believe that everybody on this earth has 
the right to tell their story the way they want to tell it, and that's 
where I'm different from journalists. Because I'm not gonna try to 
entrap her, embarrass her, make her go anywhere she doesn't want to 
go. It's her story, so I offer her that and my protection and a whole 
lot of cash. And if I was her, I'd take it, 'cause, you know, she's 
gonna need to buy a Condo on an island or something. Roseanne is also 
using the show to search for a son-in-law. So far, few takers. We 
asked for the mentally stable, successful, you know, reasonably good-looking 
Jewish males to send in videotapes to marry my daughters. Maybe they 
don't believe I'm serious or else they don't want me as their mother-in-law 
-- that's frightening -- but I encourage them to send them in. Because 
I'm serious, if my girls don't get married, I'm gonna lose my mind. 
Roseanne, searching for ratings and for relatives. Sherri Sylvester, 
CNN, Los Angeles.
