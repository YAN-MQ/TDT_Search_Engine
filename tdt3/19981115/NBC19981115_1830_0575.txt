To Malaysia, where finance ministers trying to stem the spread of 
Asia's economic crisis are making decisions vital to many Americans. 
President Clinton ho to skip it because of Iraq, but the economic 
matters being discussed there affect millions of American workers. 
More from NBC's John Palmer. As the representatives of the 21 countries 
began arriving at the summit, there was concern that Mr. Clinton's 
absence would hamper efforts to forge a consensus for dealing with 
Asia's massive economic problems. To the White House, the apec countries 
represent the most important economic region in the world vital to 
U.S. interests. At apec, we hope to continue the process of trade 
liberalization that is important for continued world-wide growth. 
At last year's summit, President Clinton was able to persuade the 
leaders to begin lowering trade barriers. But the economic turmoil 
that swept through Asia since then has caused a Number of apec states 
to reverse course trying to limit damage to their countries by isolating 
their economics. Just today, apec trade ministers failed to agree 
on a U.S.-backed proposal that would have reduced tariffs by $1.5 
trillion in global trade. Vice President Gore will substitute for 
Mr. Clinton at the summit. Trying to get a message across to Asians 
and the rest of the world that they have to get their economic houses 
in order, and we're going to be leader -- a locomotive. Pulling them 
along can't be done as effectively by a vice president as it can by 
a president. Even though he will miss the apec summit, the White House 
says President Clinton still plans to travel to the far east this 
week visiting south Korea and Japan, two key U.S. trading partners, 
where he will deliver his economic message in person. John Palmer, 
NBC news, at the White House.
