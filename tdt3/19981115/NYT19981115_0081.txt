Eight people found themselves at a crossroads in history Saturday, 
visibly uncomfortable with their task of creating the first real government 
for an online world and intimidated by the level of distrust _ sometimes 
outright animosity _ they encountered when facing their constituents 
for the first time. At a reception on Friday evening, the members 
of the ad hoc board that will establish a private system of Internet 
governance huddled with one another, unsure how to reach out to the 
many factions that have been battling for years over who will rule 
cyberspace. They had reason to be intimidated. Many of these factions 
have been quarreling for years. As the panel's chairwoman, Esther 
Dyson, pointed out, a key goal of this first public meeting was to 
earn their trust. But as the nearly 200 people who traveled from as 
far away as Malaysia lined up at microphones to introduce themselves 
Saturday morning, a single message to the new board came across loud 
and clear: We don't trust you. The dialogue did turn much more constructive 
as the day wore on, and most of the group, despite their criticism, 
expressed a willingness to work with the board and offer specific 
suggestions for insuring that the new nonprofit group _ the Internet 
Corporation for Assigned Names and Numbers _ is not taken over by 
corporate and other special interests. Still, many said the new board 
members had done little to put their minds at ease. ``There is no 
feedback from the board,'' said Tony Rutkowski, an Internet consultant 
from California. ``Esther is the only one who has asked any questions.'' 
Ms. Dyson, chairwoman of Edventure Holding, an information technology 
company in New York, acknowledged that the board seemed intimidated 
by its first meeting with its public _ which included critics of the 
process that led to their selection. Indeed, Hans Kraaijenbrink, a 
board member from the Netherlands, indicated he had never seen such 
passion at a public meeting. But the purpose of the meeting, Ms. Dyson 
said, was to listen and get input, to begin the process of building 
a consensus with the wary factions that have yet to endorse the corporation 
plan. The U.S. Department of Commerce has tentatively selected the 
corporation to take over the administrative functions of the Internet, 
which are currently handled under government contracts. Crucial issues 
the new corporation will decide include how to introduce competition 
into the lucrative business of registering Web site names in the popular 
top-level domains of ``.com,'' ``.net'' and ``.org.'' Network Solutions 
Inc., the government's contractor, currently has a monopoly on the 
business. The skepticism about the corporation stems, in part, from 
continuing questions about how its interim board was picked. Critics 
contend the nonprofit corporation was created secretly and not in 
the open consensus-building fashion that the Clinton administration 
called for when it proposed getting the government out of the Internet 
business. One person in the audience referred to the creation of the 
board as a ``virgin birth.'' Eight of the 10 board members made it 
to the first meeting, and they tried to explain how they got there. 
Kraaijenbrink, the chairman of the executive board of the European 
Telecommunications Network Operators, said he was called by the European 
Union. ``I said, `I know nothing about the Internet.' They said, `That's 
good.' ``I said, `I know nothing about the discussions that are going 
on.' They said, `That's good,''' he told the audience. Others explained 
how they were approached, directly or indirectly, by Joe Sims, the 
lawyer for Jonathan B. Postel, an Internet founder who drafted the 
corporation plan just before he died last month. But the explanations 
seemed too simple for much of the audience, who seemed convinced the 
board was selected to carry out a secret agenda for unknown special 
interests. Sensing that the audience was not satisfied with the explanations, 
Sims jumped to the microphone and explained that Postel chose the 
interim board himself, with input from around the world. The goal, 
he said, was to find people who had no history or stake in the years-long 
international debates over how to move Internet governance from the 
public to the private sector. Sims said Postel made the selections 
only after ruling out an election because there was no clear electorate. 
The interim board now faces the same problem as it tries to finalize 
the process for establishing a membership and supporting organization. 
Gregory Crew, a board member and the chairman of the Australian Communications 
Industry Forum Ltd., said the corporation would appoint an advisory 
panel to make recommendations on how a board-electing membership should 
be structured to insure sufficient accountability. ``There needs to 
be a mechanism where people who come up with an idea in their garage 
can be heard,'' one participant said.
