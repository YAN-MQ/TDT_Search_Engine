Big news is being made with big changes involving three big automakers: 
Nissan Motor Corp. USA, Mitsubishi Motor Sales of America and DaimlerChrysler 
AG, the behemoth formed by the merger of Chrysler Corp. and Daimler-Benz 
AG. The changes are indicative of the continual shifts that make automotive 
advertising one of the most fascinating, closely followed categories 
in consumer marketing. They include an agency spinoff, an account 
consolidation and a multinational, multimillion-dollar ad blitz that 
was the result of an unusual collaboration among several shops. The 
spinoff affects Nissan, which has been struggling to reverse a serious 
sales slump. Nissan and its longtime agency, TBWA/Chiat/Day, are discussing 
a spinoff of the retail dealer advertising portion of the Nissan American 
account to form a stand-alone shop that would be named Blacktop Advertising. 
Blacktop would handle duties that compose about half of the estimated 
$400 million Nissan American account at TBWA/Chiat/Day, part of the 
TBWA Worldwide unit of Omnicom Group. The spinoff is being considered 
five months after TBWA/Chiat/Day shook up management of the Nissan 
worldwide account. Jeremy Miller, a spokesman for TBWA/Chiat/Day in 
Venice, Calif., declined to comment on Friday and referred questions 
to Nissan. Debra Sanchez Fair, a spokeswoman for Nissan in Carson, 
Calif., said, ``We're always looking for ways to maximize our advertising 
communications.'' She declined further comment. Dealers have complained 
that recent Nissan campaigns from TBWA/Chiat/Day emphasized entertainment 
at the expense of hard-selling product pitches. The grumbling grew 
louder with ads carrying the theme ``Life is a journey. Enjoy the 
ride,'' that featured an avuncular character, Mr. K, and his dog. 
Both Mr. K and the pooch have disappeared, replaced by more traditional 
ads meant to stimulate showroom traffic. But for the first 10 months 
of 1998, Nissan's American vehicle sales fell 16.9 percent from the 
corresponding period a year ago. Blacktop would join a lengthy list 
of free-standing shops that handle automotive assignments. Others 
include Team One Advertising in El Segundo, Calif., a unit of Saatchi 
&AMP; Saatchi PLC that works for the Lexus division of Toyota Motor 
Sales USA, and Pentacom, part of the BBDO Worldwide unit of Omnicom, 
which handles media services for DaimlerChrysler. Sometimes, though, 
spinoffs can spin out of control. In May, Grey Advertising closed 
G2, a stand-alone shop in Huntington Beach, Calif., that had handled 
national brand advertising for Mitsubishi after G2 lost assignments 
to Deutsch Inc. Turning to Mitsubishi, the company consolidated its 
national advertising at the Marina del Rey, Calif., and New York offices 
of Deutsch, which in May was named agency of record for the 41 Mitsubishi 
regional dealer advertising associations and was awarded the task 
of introducing the 1999 Galant sedan. Those assignments had billings 
estimated at $115 million to $135 million. The consolidation, which 
increases Deutsch's total Mitsubishi billings to an estimated $250 
million, includes national consumer brand advertising, interactive 
campaigns, direct marketing and ads in Spanish. Those tasks had been 
handled by agencies including the CKS Partners unit of CKS Group in 
Cupertino, Calif., and Direct Partners in Santa Monica, Calif. ``We 
feel that in Deutsch we've found a strong marketing communications 
partner,'' said Peg Dilworth-Hunt, marketing director at Mitsubishi 
in Cypress, Calif. She praised Deutsch's campaign for the Galant, 
which introduced the theme ``Wake up and drive'' for Mitsubishi. Galant 
sales in October rose 62 percent from October 1997, Ms. Dilworth-Hunt 
said, and the share of car shoppers considering the Mitsubishi brand 
increased 29 percent. An 11.9 percent sales gain last month from October 
1997 enabled Mitsubishi sales for the year to date to pass sales for 
the first 10 months of last year, by four-tenths of a percent. As 
for DaimlerChrysler, the multinational ad blitz will herald the formation 
of the company, ranked fifth in sales volume among vehicle makers 
worldwide. The elaborate campaign, carrying the theme ``Expect the 
extraordinary,'' is scheduled to begin appearing on Wednesday, the 
day after what DaimlerChrysler executives are declaring ``Day One,'' 
when DaimlerChrysler stock will begin trading. (The merger actually 
became official on Thursday.) ``We're trying to build on the strengths 
that the two companies bring to this merger,'' said A.C. ``Bud'' Liebler, 
vice president for marketing in Auburn Hills, Mich. ``Our thought 
was `Let's do something, let's do it big and let's do it as soon as 
we can.''' Asked if there were concerns about promising ``extraordinary'' 
results from a merger that is rife with uncertainties about meshing 
two distinctly disparate operations, Liebler replied: ``Is it easy 
to live up to? No. But nothing worthwhile ever is.'' The collaborative 
process by which the ads were created may be seen as a trial run for 
what will be required from executives of Chrysler, Daimler and their 
agencies. ``One of our charges from the Chrysler and Daimler marketing 
clients was, `Hey, guys, you've got to work together,''' said Scott 
Thornton, managing partner on the Chrysler corporate account at Bozell 
Worldwide in Southfield, Mich., a unit of True North Communications. 
``And we embraced that.'' On the creative front, Bozell collaborated 
with Springer &AMP; Jacoby in Hamburg, Germany, the Daimler corporate 
agency, and another Chrysler agency, Ross Roy Communications in Bloomfield 
Hills, Mich., a unit of Omnicom. The media planning and buying for 
the three-week campaign, which is to appear in more than 100 countries, 
is being jointly handled by Bozell, Springer &AMP; Jacoby, Pentacom 
and a Daimler European agency, GFMO. ``Whenever someone asks you to 
work with another agency, it's strange,'' said Bela Ziemann, account 
director on the Daimler corporate account at Springer &AMP; Jacoby, 
which also creates campaigns for Mercedes-Benz in Germany. ``But we 
put away the strangeness,'' he added. ``It was fun.'' The campaign 
includes two-page newspaper ads, a 12-page magazine ad insert and 
130,000 brochures to be sent to so-called opinion leaders like investment 
bankers, union leaders, suppliers and journalists. The ads and brochures 
feature striking black-and-white portraits, shot by the photographer 
Richard Avedon; each pairs a Chrysler employee with a Daimler employee. 
For instance, an ad in English, with the headline ``Vision meets vision,'' 
shows Juergen Schrempp, Daimler's chairman, with Robert Eaton, Chrysler's 
chairman. An ad in German, with the headline ``Neugier begegnet neugier'' 
(``Curiosity meets curiosity'' in the English version), matches Irina 
Motzek, a consultant with the Debis Automotive Lease Finance subsidiary 
of Daimler, with Ralph Gilles, a senior designer with Chrysler. There 
is even an ad teaming up two crash-test mannequins, ``Mercedes-Benz 
Dummy Series No. 433'' and ``Dodge Dummy Series No. 516,'' which embrace 
under the headline ``Passion meets passion.'' The captions describe 
433 as a dummy that ``loves to feel the wind in his, umm, hair,'' 
and his counterpart as a dummy that ``requests country music on the 
radio.'' Looks as if DaimlerChrysler may favor its American side, 
at least in terms of sense of humor.
