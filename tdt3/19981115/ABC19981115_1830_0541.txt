Next door in Indonesia, where the dictator Suharto was driven from 
power this spring, things are starting to fall apart again. It is 
quiet today, but after two days of terrible violence, no one is very 
confident it will last. ABC's Mark Litke is in the capital, Jakarta. 
For several days, Indonesia appeared to be heading toward the abyss. 
The armed forces fired point-blank on thousands of student demonstrators. 
Buildings were set ablaze, shops looted. Senseless mobs attacked ethnic 
Chinese, the usual scapegoats in times of civil unrest here. Then, 
almost as suddenly as it started, the chaos stopped or at least paused. 
Today, Jakarta and its University campuses were remarkably quiet, 
the troops in the street, relaxed and friendly. And no one here can 
say for certain what it means. Everywhere, there are mixed messages. 
The uncertainty here tonight is not unusual for Indonesia. This is 
a country in which the national art form is shadow puppets, plays 
in which the identities and motivations of characters are hidden from 
view. While President B.J. Habibie appeared on television this weekend, 
promising some political reforms demanded by the students, he's also 
ordered the armed forces to do whatever is necessary to keep the peace. 
Students, who have seen their friends and colleagues gunned down, 
have denounced the military as murderers. Yet they cheered and embraced 
this contingent of well-disciplined Marines who arrived yesterday 
and brought order to the streets. There are so many questions. Are 
students being led by idealistic reformists or hardcore revolutionaries? 
Is the new President a friend of reform or another dictator in the 
making? Is the military split between hard-liners and moderates? Whether 
Indonesia's terrible pain in recent days will lead toward greater 
democracy or greater repression depends on so many factors and so 
many answers, which tonight are still in the shadows. Mark Litke, 
ABC News, Jakarta.
