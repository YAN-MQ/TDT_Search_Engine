When NBC decided to pay $13 million an episode to keep showing new 
episodes of ``E.R.'' this fall, it made history: No one had ever paid 
more for a show. And with the show's ratings still by far the best 
in television, the network is at least getting value for price. But 
NBC was not the only network spending big money for the series this 
fall. The cable channel TNT also paid a record price of $1 million 
an episode for four years of repeats of the series. Judging by the 
ratings from the first two months of the season, the value-price quotient 
in this case is a bit more risky. The deals point up some continuing 
conflicts adding financial pressure to the television business. Most 
shows do not make money for the studios that produce them until their 
repeats are sold in syndication; but the play of repeats in syndication 
frequently has a negative effect on the continued life of a series 
in its first-run episodes on a network. And in the increasing vertical 
integration of the television industry, corporations are facing tough 
decisions when their separate divisions have competing interests in 
a show's future. In the case of ``E.R.'' TNT, one division of Time 
Warner, has found it impossible to maximize its investment in the 
show's repeats because of opposition from another division of Time 
Warner, the Warner Brothers television studio. And the result has 
been a ratings return for the ``E.R'' repeats that is not in the same 
league with the ratings still being scored by the show's new episodes 
on NBC, which is owned by General Electric Co. Certainly if TNT was 
expecting ``E.R.'' to dominate cable ratings the way it does broadcast 
ratings, the results would have to be labeled disappointing. So far 
this season the repeats of ``E.R,'' which run on TNT each weeknight 
at 7 p.m., have pulled in an average audience of about 1.6 million 
people a night. That is only marginally better than the 1.45 million 
the network was averaging last fall with repeats of ``Lois and Clark,'' 
a series nobody would ever accuse of having dominated broadcast television. 
(It was canceled after three seasons.) But TNT's executives profess 
to be unworried. Barry Koch, vice president of research for TNT, pointed 
out that the show's ratings have been improving in recent weeks, having 
grown from just a 1.3 rating in homes that receive the channel to 
a 1.7 rating in the most recent weeks. (A ratings point for TNT represents 
745,000 homes, as opposed to a rating for a broadcast network, which 
represents 994,000 homes.) Koch also noted that ``E.R'' is greatly 
improving the channel's performance among women viewers, especially 
in the 18-to-49-year-old group that the channel can sell best to advertisers. 
The problem TNT faces with ``E.R.'' is the 7 p.m. starting time. On 
NBC the series runs at 10 p.m. as befits its status as a heavyweight 
drama. TNT originally wanted to run ``E.R'' each weeknight at 8 p.m. 
but was blocked from that plan when NBC protested to Warner Brothers, 
fearing how the repeats of ``E.R.'' seven times a week at 8 p.m. might 
affect the new episodes once a week at 10 p.m. NBC contended that 
it had exclusive prime-time rights to ``E.R.,'' perhaps not much to 
ask when you are spending $286 million a year. Warner Brothers agreed 
and passed the word to its sister company, TNT. TNT executives said 
they had a contract which allowed them to run ``E.R.'' whenever they 
chose. They even floated an idea to advertisers last spring that would 
have placed three repeats of ``E.R.'' at 7, 8 and 9 p.m. on Thursday, 
leading into the new episodes on NBC. But after what one Warner executive 
described as ``pitched battles'' in the company, TNT backed off all 
those plans and agreed to limit exposure to 7 p.m. Koch said, ``We 
went into this with our eyes open.'' Without citing any specific details 
of what rating TNT guaranteed advertisers, he said: ``There were certain 
financial expectations, which we are meeting. We're not doing a 5 
rating, but we didn't expect a 5 rating.'' But the question of how 
much better the show could be doing if it played in prime time clearly 
still intrigues TNT executives. ``We've looked at other options,'' 
Koch said. So far those options are not available because of the complications 
arising from the relationships between Time Warner and NBC and Time 
Warner and TNT. Koch said the one advantage to the 7 p.m. time period 
was that ``E.R'' could provide a better lead-in for TNT's prime-time 
schedule every weeknight. TNT's results in prime time this season 
are clouded because of its loss of National Football League games 
this fall. Overall, the network's prime-time ratings are down more 
than 25 percent, but Koch said that if football were excluded the 
network would be even with where it was at this time last fall.
