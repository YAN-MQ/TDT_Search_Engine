Pope John Paul is asking the world to pray for a peaceful end to the 
Iraq crisis. In his Sunday morning address at the Vatican, the Pope 
asked for prayers to "Illuminate the minds and hearts" of world leaders, 
so that they will continue to use diplomacy to end the standoff. He 
also said that he hopes the people of Iraq, whom he called "an already 
hard-tested population," will be spared further suffering and sorrow.
