Mark Whitaker, the new editor of Newsweek, brought up the subject 
last week as one of his first acts as editor. In an interview in his 
office, he said he was dismayed at recent decisions at Time magazine 
that he said blur the line between editorial and advertising priorities. 
``I think it's pretty well known that they're doing things now that 
seem tailored for specific advertisers,'' Whitaker said. He was alluding 
to Time magazine's recent agreement with Ford Motor Co., in which 
Ford will be the sole sponsor of new editorial sections that focus 
on the environment. In the magazine industry, ``Them's fighting words.'' 
In response, Time's managing editor, Walter Isaacson, defended Time's 
separation of powers as a ``great system of church and state.'' Toward 
the end of last week, however, magazine editors were talking about 
Time's latest advertising coup. The first issue of Time in the new 
year will be titled ``The Future of Medicine.'' There is only one 
advertiser: Pfizer Inc., the third-largest pharmaceutical advertiser 
in the country, after Glaxo-Wellcome PLC and Bristol-Myers Squibb 
Co. Pfizer spent $85.4 million last year advertising in consumer magazines. 
The issue appears ``in cycle,'' as a regular weekly edition of the 
magazine. This is the first time Time has had one advertiser in a 
regularly scheduled, not additional, issue of the magazine. Single-advertiser 
special issues are not new, and they are appearing with increasing 
frequency. Time did one with Sears, for a special issue on women in 
1990. In 1993, a special issue on multiculturalism had one advertiser: 
Chrysler. The single advertiser in a cyberspace issue in 1995 was 
AT&AMP;T. And Glaxo-Wellcome was the advertiser both in the fall of 
1996, for a special issue on the frontiers of medicine, and in the 
fall of 1991, for one on the heroes of medicine. What has attracted 
attention is that not only is the issue a regularly scheduled issue 
of Time magazine, but the special-projects editor of Time, Barrett 
Seaman, who is overseeing the issue on medicine, recently spent the 
day with Pfizer product managers in their offices on East 42nd Street 
in Manhattan. While both Isaacson and Seaman said in no way would 
Pfizer help to shape the issue, Seaman nevertheless conceded that 
he was disturbed by the trend toward having single advertisers featured 
in an issue solely about the subject they address. ``I am troubled 
by the continuing movement toward having these big advertisers on 
the subjects where the advertiser is in the same business more or 
less,'' he said. ``But let's face it, those are the kind of advertisers 
you're going to attract. If you do a special issue on the future of 
the automobile industry, you're not going to attract Eli Lilly.'' 
Seaman said his visit yielded little for the editorial side of the 
magazine. ``It was at the request of our ad sales people that I go 
spend a little time and sort of as the editorial representative give 
them a chance to talk a little bit about Pfizer,'' Seaman said in 
defense of his visit. ``And I would also add that those conversations 
had absolutely nothing to do with the editorial product that we're 
working on.'' Last Monday, Time reporter Christine Gorman paid a separate 
visit to Pfizer's research department in Groton, Conn., to begin reporting 
a story for the issue, Seaman said. Editors at several magazines said 
they were certain that Time would not allow Pfizer to interfere with 
the contents of the issue, but that the perception of the arrangement 
might be damaging in readers' minds. ``I think the reader might ask 
questions,'' said Richard Smith, chairman of Newsweek magazine. ``People 
who are writing, reporting or editing _ line-editing _ should not 
be getting too close to advertisers, even if that is just to head 
off the perception that the advertiser has influence over the editorial 
copy.'' Newsweek has produced its own single-advertiser issues: An 
edition about children was sponsored by Johnson &AMP; Johnson, the 
eighth-largest advertiser in consumer magazines. According to a former 
Newsweek staff member, who insisted on anonymity, Johnson &AMP; Johnson 
executives and Newsweek editors attended planning meetings for the 
special issue. E. Bruce Hallett, president of Time magazine, said 
Seaman ``certainly went over there and outlined the conception of 
the editorial proposition, about which we are very enthusiastic, of 
course. That's part of doing a good job for any advertising customer. 
Conceptually, it's not different from putting Walter into a roomful 
of advertisers to talk about the magazine. The editorial is a core 
part of what we are selling to the advertising community.'' Why do 
a single-advertiser issue at all? Why not allow in a multitude of 
advertisers? ``I think in the business of advertising,'' Hallett said, 
``an advertiser wants to draw attention to itself and I think that 
these issues obviously telescope that kind of effect, so I think for 
an advertiser, it's very attractive. It does what advertising is supposed 
to do. It makes a statement on behalf of yourself about who you are 
and what you stand for and what you do for your customers. And I think 
this particular issue is a particularly good statement of that.'' 
Seaman added: ``I've been doing this for four and a half, five years 
now, since we did multicultural American back in 1992, and over the 
years I have finally learned the drill to walk the line and still 
look at myself in the mirror every morning.'' But Jacqueline Leo, 
president of the American Society of Magazine Editors, which monitors 
practices by magazine editors, said she was concerned by Seaman's 
visit. ``On the surface, on the outside, this doesn't look kosher,'' 
she said. ``It sends a signal to other advertisers in the field. First, 
what happens to the other advertisers? You're eliminating a lot of 
other people who may have wanted to be in that issue for whatever 
reason.'' Allan Siegal, an assistant managing editor at The New York 
Times, said The Times has also published single-advertiser special 
sections. ``We have on rare occasion in the past, published special 
sections with single-advertiser sponsorship,'' Siegal said. ``The 
news staff is not usually comfortable with it because it creates the 
appearance of more influence than advertisers have in our news columns.'' 
Asked whether an editor would ever participate in a meeting or visit 
with an advertiser in a single-advertiser section, he said, ``I can't 
imagine that we would allow that.'' Ms. Leo of the magazine association 
said: ``I can't say that they violated any specific guidelines of 
ASME, unless their editors were urged to participate in something 
they didn't feel comfortable with. But it doesn't bode well in the 
long run. Because it's a perception problem. There's another guy down 
the street who will say, `See, look what they did, that editor visited 
Pfizer, when's my turn?' and there goes the whole ballgame.''
