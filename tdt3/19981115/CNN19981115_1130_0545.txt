Internet job opportunities are hard to find for many young people 
living in the inner city and that's changing in governmenten thanks 
to some young entra pren sures. An Kellan reports. This used to be 
all vacant lots and trash and weeds and rats. Tony alves and kelby 
mendes say living in the inner city of boston wasn't always easy. 
I grew up in Roxbury, Massachusetts. It's a pretty rough neighborhood 
to grow up in. I find that there aren't as many opportunities in the 
neighborhood as if you were to go to another neighborhood. Kelby started 
college but couldn't afford to continue. Tony was working odd jobs 
and was thinking about becoming a cop. Then Nick gleason, a community 
organizer and entrepreneur, sparked their interest in computers. I 
knew a lot of people in inner-city areas who were good friends of 
mine who could clearly be doing this work but didn't have the networks, 
didn't have the connections. Nick gleason, along with business partner 
Jim picariello, started a company called "citysoft" to give people 
that connection. First, they found places like this, right in the 
inner city, where kelby, tony and others could learn computer programming. 
Specifically, how to design web pages. With about five months training 
under their belts, kelby and Tony were assigned by citysoft to work 
at "the Boston globe" newspaper's web site. I cut wire photos off 
the Internet, and we publish them onto their web site. It was weird, 
I just enjoyed it right away. It automatically blows up the picture 
for you, and it allows you to rotate it. And they love that they are 
now role models for others in training and in the neighborhood where 
they grew up, where they have decided to stay. It's kind of like radical 
to be from an urban neighborhood and to be really fluent in computers 
and technology and stuff, so people kind of -- they kind of look up 
to me in a way. A lot of individuals see what I'm doing right now, 
and they hear about citysoft through the media and they know what 
I do and then they look at me and then they say, "I want to do that, 
too." Ann Kellan, CNN, Boston, Massachusetts.
