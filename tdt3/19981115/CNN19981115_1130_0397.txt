The earth is about to pass through the tail of the Comet temple-tuttle. 
The effect is known as the Leonid meteor shower and it happens every 
november. But this year should be more spectacular than usual because 
the Comet recently passed by earth. That means there are more pieces 
of sand and dust from the Comet for the planet to pass through. People 
in Australia and Asia will get the view the storm at its peak during 
their night-time hours.
