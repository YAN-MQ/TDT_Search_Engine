Voters throughout this dusty and wind-swept West African country turned 
out Wednesday to participate in presidential elections that opposition 
leaders had hoped to derail with a boycott. Polling stations were 
packed after opening just early in the day and continued to see an 
steady flow of voters show up to cast their ballots. ``I just want 
to participate in democracy,'' said businessman Louis Diallo while 
leaving a voting center in Burkina Faso's capital of Ouagadougou. 
Critics have maintained that incumbent president, Blaise Compaore, 
manipulated the elections in his favor. His only contenders are both 
seen as supporters of the president and not genuine candidates. Candidates 
from the country's leading opposition parties refused to run in the 
election, calling it ``anti-democratic.'' Compaore denied the charges 
and urged all eligible voters to cast their ballots. ``I'm confident 
in the ongoing democratic process,'' he said after voting. Despite 
tensions between Compaore's supporters and his political opponents, 
there were no major incidents reported. Additional police and paramilitary 
troops were deployed in Ouagadougou as a precautionary measure. Opponents 
contend the election lacked transparency, although observers from 
the European Union and the Organization of African Unity were on hand 
Sunday to monitor the voting. The weekend voting was the second presidential 
election in the past seven years. Compaore transformed his military 
leadership into a civilian administration by holding the first polls 
in 1991. The head of state since he helped depose Capt. Thomas Sankara's 
military leadership in 1987, Compaore later resigned his military 
commission in order to stand for election in 1991. Opposition parties 
working together boycotted those polls and mounted a campaign to keep 
people from voting. Only 26 percent of eligible voters took part in 
those elections. This time around, a coalition of oppositions parties 
mounted a similarly visible anti-election campaign, posting notices 
saying ``Do not vote'' or ``I boycott.'' The boycott strategy is partially 
in response to poor showings in previous elections that opposition 
parties have participated in. In National Assembly elections earlier 
this year, opposition candidates won only 9 of 111 seats.
