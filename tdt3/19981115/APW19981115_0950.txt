UNITED NATIONS (AP) _ U.N. Secretary-General Kofi Annan stepped in 
Sunday to defuse a potentially serious glitch in the Security Council 
over Iraq's pledge to cooperate fully and unconditionally with U.N. 
weapons inspectors. The council meeting was delayed by more than an 
hour because some members were concerned that a statement by Iraq's 
Deputy Prime Minister Tariq Aziz Sunday might have repudiated three 
key letters from Iraq's U.N. ambassador clarifying Iraq's position. 
It was the contents of these letters from Iraqi Ambassador Nizar Hamdoon 
that led U.S. President Bill Clinton to reverse the U.S. position 
and declare Sunday that Iraq's promise to allow U.N. arms inspections 
to resume was indeed unconditional. Annan said in a statement that 
Clinton's ``statesmanlike response today will be welcomed by the entire 
international community.'' He warned, however, that in a future crisis, 
military force might be the only way out. ``Some governments have 
made it clear that next time around there may not even be time for 
diplomatic appeals,'' Annan said in an interview with CNN. Doubts 
about Iraq's unconditional commitment to inspections arose when Aziz 
told CNN Sunday that ``Iraq is only committed to the contents of the 
letter'' he sent to Annan on Saturday. The letter said weapons inspectors 
could resume their ``normal duties'' _ but it also contained an annex 
with Iraq's terms for a comprehensive review of its compliance with 
U.N. resolutions, many of which have already been rejected by the 
United States. And Washington rejected the Iraqi offer as unacceptable. 
During nearly five hours of meeting Saturday night, Hamdoon provided 
three letters of clarification stating that Iraq's decision to allow 
unfettered inspections was unconditional, that the annex represented 
only the Iraqi government's ``views and preferences,'' and that the 
inspectors could immediately resume all their activities. After Aziz 
appeared on television, the Security Council president, who this month 
happens to be Deputy U.S. Ambassador Peter Burleigh, asked the secretary-general 
to clarify whether the deputy prime minister's statement was a repudiation 
of Hamdoon's letters. The council meeting was delayed while Hamdoon 
met Annan and Burleigh. According to a U.S. diplomat, Hamdoon arranged 
a phone call to Aziz during the meeting, and with Burleigh listening, 
Aziz said his letter included the three letters of clarification from 
the ambassador. U.N. spokesman Fred Eckhard said a note from that 
telephone conversation was presented to council members. It stated 
that Aziz had authorized Hamdoon's letters to the council, and ``they 
therefore formed part and parcel of his letter.'' After the meeting, 
Hamdoon told reporters: ``I think this matter is behind us now.'' 
The council then began meeting behind closed doors to continue consultations 
on a response to Iraq's offer to resume cooperation with inspectors, 
and its subsequent clarifications that the offer was without additional 
demands. Diplomats said they were considering two draft statements, 
one from Russia and one from Britain. ``I think the council should 
make it clear it is now up to Iraq to make sure that their promises 
hold and that UNSCOM should have good access and it should be successful,'' 
said Slovenia's U.N. Ambassador Danilo Turk. ``I think we're quite 
close to consensus on moving the inspectors back under terms that 
require absolutely full and complete and unconditional observation 
by Iraq of Security Council resolutions,'' said Britain's U.N. Ambassador 
Jeremy Greenstock. Richard Butler, head of the U.N. Special Commission 
charged with eliminating Iraq's weapons of mass destruction, told 
reporters that he had already started the logistical process of arranging 
an aircraft and making other plans to send the inspectors back to 
Baghdad. ``I told the council that the minute the `go' order is given, 
we could be back at work in 24 hours, and that remains the case,'' 
he said. Butler said Clinton had ``superbly defined'' in his speech 
Sunday morning what full cooperation with the weapons inspectors should 
mean ``and I earnestly hope that Iraq says that's fine by us.'' Clinton 
said Iraq must resolve all outstanding issues raised by UNSCOM and 
the International Atomic Energy Agency, give inspectors unfettered 
access to all sites without restrictions, turn over all relevant documents, 
accept all U.N. resolutions related to its weapons of mass destruction, 
and not interfere with the independence of the inspectors. Hamdoon 
said he wanted ``to put the record straight,'' when asked about Clinton's 
points. ``Iraq abides by the relevant Security Council resolutions,'' 
agreements with UNSCOM and the memorandum of understanding Aziz signed 
with Annan in February, which ended the last crisis with Iraq, he 
said. ``There is nothing more, nothing less,'' Hamdoon said. Iraq 
halted U.N. inspections Oct. 31, saying it would only resume cooperation 
with the arms experts if the council moved to lift sanctions imposed 
after Iraq's 1990 invasion of Kuwait. The sanctions have paralyzed 
exports of oil, Iraq's economic mainstay. U.N. resolutions that ended 
the Gulf war, which was sparked by Iraq's invasion, say sanctions 
can only be lifted after inspectors certify that Iraq has destroyed 
its weapons of mass destruction.
