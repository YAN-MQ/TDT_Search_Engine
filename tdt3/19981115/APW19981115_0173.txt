A rocket fired by the northern-based opposition slammed into the Afghan 
capital on Sunday, but there were no immediate report of casualties, 
witnesses said. The rocket landed near the combined military and civilian 
airport. This was the first rocket attack on Kabul since a cease fire 
between the Afghan warring factions ended last week. In recent days 
there has been fierce fighting between the Taliban fighters and the 
opposition forces loyal to Ahmed Shah Massood's Jamiat-e-Islami in 
northern Takhar and Baghlan provinces. The Taliban, or the students 
of Islam, are Sunni Muslims and are mostly Pashtun _ the majority 
ethnic group of Afghanistan. The Taliban rule roughly 90 percent of 
the country, including the capital. The opposition comprise mainly 
of religious and ethnic minorities including Shiites, Tajiks, Uzbeks 
and Hazaras.
