The trial of a 30-year-old computer executive, soon to begin in Shanghai, 
heralds a new electronic battleground for China's political dissidents 
and security forces determined to preserve Communist Party control. 
Lin Hai, the defendant, is charged with ``inciting subversion of state 
power.'' Prosecutors say that from September 1997 until his arrest 
in March, Lin gave tens of thousands of Chinese e-mail addresses to 
``hostile foreign publications.'' In particular, they say, he provided 
addresses to an electronic newsletter called VIP Reference, which 
is compiled by Chinese democracy advocates in Washington and sent 
to hundreds of thousands of computer-users inside China. According 
to the indictment, Lin helped the newsletter ``carry out propaganda 
and incitement by distributing essays inciting subversion of state 
power and overthrow of the socialist system.'' Lin appears to be the 
first legal casualty of a building struggle, as Internet users here 
and abroad make shreds of the government's efforts to censor political 
debate and filter foreign news. VIP Reference _ which sends out reports 
on dissident activities, essays and reprinted articles on human rights 
and other issues _ is the most prominent of several electronic forums 
that are breaching China's information defenses. ``We're promoting 
freedom of speech on the Internet,'' said Feng Donghai, a software 
engineer at Columbia University who moved to the United States three 
years ago and helped start VIP Reference last fall. ``They are putting 
Lin Hai on trial to set an example.'' The main VIP Reference, sent 
out every 10 days, mostly includes essays and debates on democratic 
topics. A subsidiary Daily News edition, sent daily, includes detailed 
accounts of dissident initiatives and arrests. The main newsletter 
is now sent to more than 250,000 addresses in China, said its publisher, 
Lian Shengde, who spoke from Washington. The Daily News edition goes 
to about 25,000, and the numbers are steadily climbing as sympathizers 
send in lists of Chinese addresses. The newsletter accepts addresses 
indiscriminately _ many are from commercially traded lists _ then 
mails to everyone. The theory is that when so many are automatic recipients, 
individuals cannot be accused of deliberately subscribing. ``We're 
posing a new problem for the Communists,'' said Lian, a software engineer 
in his 30s who moved from China after the 1989 military crackdown 
on student-led demonstrators in Beijing's Tiananmen Square. ``I don't 
think there's any way they can stop us.'' Another, similar publication 
is Tunnel, a self-described ``webzine'' of commentary written in China 
and sent electronically to the United States from where it is wired 
back to thousands of accounts inside China. The sites, which require 
Chinese-script software, are at www.ifcss.org/ftp-pub/org/dck for 
VIP Reference and www.geocities.com/SiliconValley/Bay/5598 for Tunnel. 
A third newsletter, Public Opinion, is edited and distributed electronically 
from inside China. It includes commentaries and reprints of items 
taken off the Internet and is produced by a group of young computer 
company workers who call themselves ``political netters.'' Over the 
last year, these newsletters, plus assorted online discussion groups, 
have become important means of communication among political activists, 
said Xiao Qiang, executive director of Human Rights in China in New 
York. China now has some 1.2 million Internet accounts, many shared 
by several users, with the numbers zooming. The government has encouraged 
hookups in the interest of promoting national development, but is 
fighting a losing battle to control political uses. China uses an 
electronic ``firewall'' to block access to Web sites it deems objectionable, 
including those of human rights groups and some considered pornographic. 
But it cannot keep up with new sites, and clever users can sidestep 
the firewall. E-mail is virtually uncontrollable, although agents 
can identify a particular individual and read that person's mail. 
China's security agencies have formed special units to fight not only 
conventional computer crimes like illegal break-ins and fraud, but 
also the spread of dissident information. To evade government filters 
and electronic disruptions, VIP Reference is mailed from a different 
American address every day. Somehow, the authorities zeroed in on 
Lin. Last week, Lin's wife, Xu Hong, learned that his trial will begin 
on Nov. 26 but will be a closed proceeding so that she cannot attend. 
The lawyers she hired will be present but, Ms. Xu said by telephone, 
``I'm afraid the lawyers won't have much influence on the results.'' 
If convicted as charged, Lin may face a prison sentence of five years 
or more. He and his wife have a 20-month-old son. Ms. Xu, who says 
her husband is innocent, said that e-mail addresses are ``public information, 
like telephone books, which can be exchanged or purchased.'' He has 
never been involved in politics, she said.
