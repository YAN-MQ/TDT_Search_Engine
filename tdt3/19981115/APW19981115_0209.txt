Fearing possible Western air strikes against Iraq, Moscow began withdrawing 
some Russian personnel from Baghdad on Sunday, a government spokesman 
said. More than 100 people, mostly employees of the Russian embassy 
in Iraq and some of their family members, left for the city of Kermanshah 
in Iran by bus, the duty officer at the Emergency Situations Ministry 
said. The ministry sent two planes to Kermanshah to pick up the Russian 
citizens, who were expected to arrive in Moscow late Sunday or Monday. 
Despite the evacuation, Russia thinks that the standoff with Iraq 
will be resolved without air strikes. ``There are good prospects for 
a political settlement of the crisis,'' Foreign Minister Igor Ivanov 
said, according to the Interfax news agency. Iraqi leader Saddam Hussein 
halted United Nations' monitoring of weapons sites Oct. 31. But the 
latest crisis has been building since Aug. 5 when Iraq prohibited 
field inspections for nuclear, biological and chemical weapons. Iraq 
sent a letter to the U.N. Saturday saying arms inspectors could return, 
but the United States has said it fails to meet American conditions 
to resume checks. Russia has consistently argued against the use of 
force against Iraq, and has sought to mediate in Iraq's frequent confrontations 
with the West.
