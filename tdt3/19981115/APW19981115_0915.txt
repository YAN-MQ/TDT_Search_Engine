Poor weather and the risk of further snowslides delayed the search 
Sunday for former Prime Minister Pierre Trudeau's youngest son, believed 
killed when he was swept into an icy lake by an avalanche. Michel 
Trudeau, 23, was on a back-country ski expedition Friday when he was 
thrown into Kokanee Lake in the Kootenay Mountains of southeast British 
Columbia. The two other skiers with Trudeau survived. A team of police 
divers was ready to search for his body once weather conditions permitted. 
But rain and low clouds prevented authorities from dispatching helicopters 
to the site of the avalanche, which is inaccessible by overland vehicle. 
Cpl. Randy Koch of the Mounties' local detachment said he had spoken 
by telephone with Pierre Trudeau. ``He's deeply shaken by this,'' 
Koch said. ``He was very quiet, but he told us to go on to recover 
the body.'' Three hikers were walking along the same ridge behind 
Michel Trudeau's group when the avalanche struck. They tried to help, 
but were swept away themselves by a second avalanche. One of the hikers, 
Paul Williamson, said Trudeau was ``still alive, shouting for help 
and groaning. We could see him. But we couldn't reach him. He was 
in the middle of the lake.'' After digging themselves out, the hikers 
had to walk about four miles in soggy clothing to reach their car 
and drive to seek help. Michel Trudeau had visited the area earlier 
this year with his father and one of his brothers. He was an avid 
skier and hiker, and had worked as a ski lift attendant in the Kootenay 
Mountains last winter. Prime Minister Jean Chretien called Pierre 
Trudeau from Singapore to express his condolences. ``Mr. Trudeau is 
a man who doesn't easily express his emotions,'' Chretien told Radio-Canada. 
``But his tone of voice was heavy and it was obvious he must have 
been suffering enormously.'' The former prime minister, who held power 
from 1968 to 1984 except for a nine-month gap, has two other sons, 
Sacha and Justin. He and the boys' mother, Margaret, are divorced.
