Fiorentina's coach and players expressed anger and disappointment 
Sunday after the club's appeal of its expulsion from the UEFA Cup 
was denied. Argentine striker Gabriel Batistuta called the decision 
``a great injustice.'' ``I feel very bad,'' the Serie A leader's captain 
said. ``It's like they sent us to jail even though we did nothing. 
We're all upset, we're broken up about it. What happened is ridiculous.'' 
UEFA ruled Sunday that there will be no replay of the Nov. 3 cup game 
between Fiorentina and Swiss club Grasshoppers, a match suspended 
at halftime after an explosive device tossed from the stands injured 
an off-field official. That game was played at Salerno, Italy, because 
Fiorentina's home field was suspended for violence at a 1997 match. 
The decision ``means we will concentrate on the league and the Italian 
Cup, trying to get our revenge there,'' Fiorentina coach Giovanni 
Trapattoni said.
