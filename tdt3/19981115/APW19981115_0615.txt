If the United States were to attack Iraq, even after the Arab state 
capitulated to U.N. demands, it would be simply an act of ``naked 
aggression'' with no legal merit, an Iraqi official said Sunday. In 
a letter sent Saturday to U.N. Secretary-General Kofi Annan, Iraq 
said the government of President Saddam Hussein was reversing its 
decision to halt cooperation with the U.N. weapons inspectors. U.S. 
President Bill Clinton said Sunday that Iraq had narrowly averted 
a military strike and warned Baghdad that it must live up to its pledge 
to cooperate unconditionally with the inspectors. There was no immediate 
reaction from Baghdad to Clinton's statement. In London, Prime Minister 
Tony Blair also warned that the crisis ``is not over until absolute 
and unconditional compliance is guaranteed and delivered.'' Russian 
Defense Minister Igor Sergeyev, however, cautioned that airstrikes 
would ``be counterproductive,'' the Interfax new agency reported.
