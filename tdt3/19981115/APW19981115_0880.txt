WASHINGTON (AP) _ U.S. B-52 bombers arrived in the Gulf over the weekend 
as part of the American military buildup aimed at threatening Iraq, 
but other warplanes were diverted to Europe instead, Air Force officials 
said Sunday. In announcing that Iraq agreed unconditionally to allow 
U.N. weapons inspectors to do their work, President Bill Clinton said 
Sunday that the buildup of about 400 warplanes by Thanksgiving would 
continue to ensure Saddam Hussein meets his obligations. But Defense 
Secretary William Cohen said the buildup might not reach full planned 
strength because the United States already has plenty of firepower 
in the region, with more than 170 aircraft, one aircraft carrier and 
about two dozen other ships. Military strength can be ``increased 
at a moment's notice if we have to do so,'' Cohen said. Some of the 
diversions were due to ``a lack of clearances'' for some of the aircraft 
to land in the region, said a senior defense official, who spoke on 
condition of anonymity. The official wouldn't say who denied the clearance. 
Defense officials weren't saying where the warplanes were supposed 
to land in the Gulf region. Previously, American jet fighters and 
bombers have used bases in Qatar, Bahrain, Kuwait, Saudi Arabia and 
some of the other Gulf states. Within about two weeks, two aircraft 
carriers, more than two dozen ships, some 400 warplanes and about 
45,000 U.S. troops were supposed to be in the Gulf as part of the 
buildup. Ground forces would include 4,500 in Kuwait prepared to defend 
against any Iraqi action if the U.S. troops are sent as previously 
planned. Ten of 12 F-117 stealth fighters slated to go to the Gulf 
left on Saturday from Holloman Air Force Base, New Mexico, said Capt. 
Gregg Bottemiller, public affairs director for the base. There was 
no confirmation on where or when the aircraft landed. Six B-52s out 
of Barksdale Air Force Base, Louisiana, arrived at the Indian Ocean 
island of Diego Garcia, according to Air Force Capt. Sandy Troeber. 
But six other B-52s, which can launch Tomahawk cruise missiles, remained 
at Fairchild AFB at Spokane, Washington. Meanwhile, some of the more 
than three dozen F-15 and F-16 jet fighters that had departed various 
U.S. bases on Friday and Saturday were diverted to Europe. Troeber 
said several fighter aircraft went to bases in Spain and Italy for 
``operational reasons'' and were expected to continue to the Gulf 
when conditions permit. Six B-1 bombers also left over the weekend 
for the region. Some 550 Air Force personnel were leaving Sunday and 
Monday to support the aircraft. An E-8C Joint Surveillance and Target 
Attack Radar System aircraft, known as Joint STARS, left for the Gulf 
on Saturday. The surveillance planes have long-range air-to-ground 
systems designed to track targets in all weather conditions. Three 
other surveillance aircraft, E-3C AWACS, for Airborne Warning and 
Control System, left Saturday as well. Three EC-130s, electronic jammers, 
were scheduled to leave on Monday, the Air Force said.
