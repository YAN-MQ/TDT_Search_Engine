Ivan Shapiro, a real estate lawyer and former president of the Ethical 
Culture Society, who was also a leader in organizations concerned 
with civil liberties and the homeless, died Nov. 5. He was 69 and 
lived in Manhattan. The cause was complications from Alzheimer's disease 
and cancer, his wife, Maria, said. Shapiro was born in New York City 
in 1928. He graduated from City College in 1948, and from Harvard 
Law School in 1951, specializing in real estate law. He became a partner 
at the law firms of Wein, Lane &AMP; Malkin and Greenbaum, Wolff &AMP; 
Ernst before joining Willkie, Farr &AMP; Gallagher in 1981 as a specialist 
in large commercial real estate transactions. Parallel to his legal 
career, Shapiro became a leader of the Ethical Culture Society; he 
was its president from 1972 to 1978 and chairman of its schools from 
1977 to 1982. Shapiro also became a member of the New York Civil Liberties 
Union, joining its board in 1966 and later becoming its treasurer. 
There, he focused on abortion rights and on the separation of church 
and state, a topic he often addressed in speeches broadcast from the 
Ethical Cultural Society's Sunday meetings. ``He was someone who didn't 
get the visibility, but he was a pillar of the development of the 
modern-day civil liberties union,'' said Norman Siegel, executive 
director of the New York Civil Liberties Union. ``He helped frame 
some of the most important civil liberty issues of the late 20th century, 
and he did it in a humanistic way.'' More recently, Shapiro was the 
president of Urban Pathways, a nonprofit agency that serves the homeless 
population of New York City. During his time as president, the agency 
acquired an empty plot in Hell's Kitchen and built a residence for 
55 formerly homeless men and women who are mentally ill. In 1996, 
the six-story building on West 46th Street, with individual studio 
apartments and supervised treatment, was named Ivan Shapiro House. 
Shapiro's first marriage, to Florence Goodstein, ended in divorce. 
In addition to his wife, Shapiro is survived by two daughters, Alexandra 
Shapiro of Malibu, Calif., and Lisa J. Kubiske of Annandale, Va., 
and two grandsons.
