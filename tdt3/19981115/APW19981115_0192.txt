Lee Westwood shot a 3-under-par 69 Sunday and became the first golfer 
in the tournament's 27-year history to win three consecutive Sumitomo 
VISA Taiheiyo Masters titles. The Englishman rebounded from bogeys 
on the first two holes. He sank a 33-foot (10-meter) birdie putt on 
the third and went on to score five more birdies against another bogey, 
finishing with a 13-under 275 total. Japan's superstar Masashi ``Jumbo'' 
Ozaki shot the day's best round, a 67, and finished at 277. Colombia's 
Eduardo Herrera turned in a 71 and was alone in third at 278. Overnight 
leader Frankie Minoza of the Philippines struggled to a 74 and finished 
fourth at 279. Westwood, 25, now has won six times worldwide this 
year and has 12 career victories in the past three years. On the European 
Tour alone, he won four times and finished third on the money list 
behind Colin Montgomerie and Darren Clarke. The victory Sunday was 
worth 21 million yen (dlrs 168,000). ``I got off to a slow start but 
I kept my composure,'' said Westwood. ``I knew I had to dig in there 
and play a little better. I've shown a lot of material the last two 
days. ``This course obviously suits me. I look forward to coming back 
next year and the year after that and the year after that,'' he said 
of the 7,072-yard (6,436-meter), par-72 Taiheiyo Masters Gotemba course, 
near snow-capped Mount Fuji. Westwood knew somebody was making a late 
charge but did not know it was Jumbo Ozaki, who was seeking his fourth 
title this year and 110th overall. ``All the scoreboards are in Japanese,'' 
he said. ``Jumbo is a good player and you expect him to make a charge 
on the last day, like he did last year.'' Last year, Jumbo and one 
of his two younger brothers, Joe, tied for second at 273, just one 
shot behind Westwood's 272. Playing ahead of Westwood this time, Ozaki 
birdied the par-5 18th and set the score to beat. When Westwood left 
himself with a 7-foot (2-meter) putt to save par at the 17th, a playoff 
became a real possibility. However, Westwood sank the putt, keeping 
a one-stroke lead, and then easily birdied the last after finding 
the green with his second shot.
