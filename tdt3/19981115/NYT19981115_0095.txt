In an attempt to rebuild religious identity among young Jews, who 
are marrying non-Jews and abandoning the faith in large numbers, Jewish 
organizations plan to start a program that will pay for any Jew in 
the world between age 15 and 26 to travel to Israel for 10 days. The 
program, Birthright Israel, is expected to cost $300 million over 
five years and to be financed by the Israeli government, a group of 
major Jewish donors from North America and the Council of Jewish Federations. 
Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu plans to announce the program 
in Jerusalem on Monday night in a speech to the General Assembly of 
the Council of Jewish Federations _ whose many American participants 
had intentionally defied a State Department travel advisory that warned 
American civilians to leave Israel because of a possible Iraqi attack. 
The program's backers concede that they cannot estimate how many will 
take part, whether enough funds will be raised, or how they will determine 
who is eligible to travel _ a knotty question that reopens the whole 
controversy over ``who is a Jew.'' The assumption behind Birthright 
Israel is that even a spring break spent in Israel can form a connection 
to Jewishness for young people who have little or no affiliation with 
synagogues or other Jewish institutions. The program is also an effort 
to mend the fraying ties among Jews, who find themselves increasingly 
divided over both the Israeli peace negotiations with the Palestinians 
and the theological conflicts between the Orthodox and more liberal 
branches of Judaism. Israel is the cement that can bind the Jewish 
community together, say Michael H. Steinhardt, one of Wall Street's 
wealthiest money managers, and Charles R. Bronfman, co-chairman of 
the Seagram Co. in Montreal. The two men initiated the Birthright 
Israel program, and each is contributing $5 million. ``It's my hope 
that over time, 10 or 15 years perhaps, the Birthright trip can develop 
into a tradition analogous to that of the Bar or Bat Mitzvah,'' Steinhardt 
said last week in an interview in his office. ``Our hope is that a 
trip to Israel will be another rite of passage of Jewish life.'' For 
more than a decade, American Jewish organizations have agonized over 
``Jewish continuity,'' or how to preserve Jewish heritage among successive 
generations. Some leaders have concluded that Jewish day schools, 
summer camps and youth groups are far more effective than quick trips 
to Israel. ``I think that six-week trips, 10-day trips are very nice 
_ no harm is being done,'' said Steven Bayme, National Director for 
Jewish Communal Affairs at the American Jewish Committee. ``But I 
don't think the faith that is being placed in these kinds of programs 
is justified. The Jewish community is looking for a silver bullet 
when there are no magic solutions. Jewish continuity requires a great 
deal of sustained effort over many years.'' And yet trips to Israel 
receive broad backing while Jewish day schools struggle for contributions, 
said Bayme. The reason, he said, is that ``there is no consensus on 
how to insure Jewish continuity, because we really are divided on 
what constitutes Jewish life _ but Israel still has a certain consensual 
power among American Jews.'' Steinhardt, an atheist who said he grew 
up in a ``nominally Orthodox'' home, agreed. He said that ``Israel 
has frankly _ through my life, for much of my life _ been a substitute 
for theology.'' ``I have lived an important part of my Jewishness 
through association with Israel rather than through adherence to a 
religious law and substantial observance,'' he said. The World Jewish 
Congress has projected that the Jewish population outside of Israel, 
which has about 8 million people, will decline to about 4 million 
in the next 30 years, said Steinhardt. In the United States, about 
half of all Jews marry non-Jews, and the children of a large majority 
of those intermarried couples do not remain Jewish. Young people who 
have visited Israel are far more likely to marry other Jews, according 
to a report by the American Jewish Committee published in 1994. But 
the report said that a large majority of American Jews _ 69 percent 
_ have never visited Israel. Promoting trips to Israel is not a new 
strategy. ``Israel Experience,'' an organization already financed 
by Bronfman, has tried to increase youth travel to Israel in the last 
two years through advertisements in magazines like ``Seventeen'' and 
``Teen People.'' The campaign resulted in a ``slight blip of an increase'' 
of young American Jews visiting Israel, said Ivy B. Abrams, vice president 
of marketing for Israel Experience. But for 10 years, despite these 
and other efforts, the numbers of American youth traveling to Israel 
has remained pretty flat _ at about 16,000 a year, she said. Steinhardt 
and Bronfman are now hoping that by essentially giving away the trips, 
they will attract many more takers. Under their plan, beginning in 
the year 2000, Birthright would cover the cost of air fare and first 
ten days of a trip to Israel with any one of over 200 established 
Israeli travel programs. There is a wide menu of choices _ kibbutz 
trips, archeological trips, hiking treks, ecological journeys, and 
historical trips. The expenses for the rest of trips lasting more 
than 10 days would have to come from another source, Bronfman said. 
``Jews today,'' Bronfman said, ``particularly in the United States 
and Canada, are free to be whatever they want to be, and that's a 
pretty new situation for Jews. So now what we have to do is undertake 
the selling of Jewishness to Jews.'' The idea for Birthright originated 
with Yossi Beilin, a former Cabinet minister and a member of the Israeli 
Parliament, who talked about an initiative to send every Jewish boy 
or girl on an all-expense-paid 13th birthday trip to Israel. The idea 
appealed to Steinhardt, who pulled Bronfman aside during a fund-raising 
ball at the Israel Museum over a year ago. The two went outside and 
sat on a stone wall overlooking Jerusalem, and Steinhardt suggested 
that they adopt Beilin's idea and undertake something ``very big and 
very audacious,'' as Bronfman recalled. Eventually, for younger Jews, 
Bronfman said the program would become at least partly ``self-financing.'' 
Under the plan, local Jewish Federations would notify every Jewish 
couple who have a baby that they have deposited a $180 check for every 
Jewish baby born in a special account. The amount was determined by 
multiplying 10 times chai, the Hebrew characters that represent 18 
and also form the word ``life.'' That original investment could be 
augmented by friends and relatives, bar mitzvah money, and community 
organizations, eventually building up to enough for a trip to Israel, 
Bronfman said. He acknowledged that many details are still dangling: 
how many Jewish babies there are and how to find them, who will govern 
a worldwide program, how to fund trips years from now for children 
whose friends and relatives do not add to the basic sum and how to 
determine _ perhaps the stickiest question of all _ who is eligible 
for the program. One of the most divisive issues among Jews today 
is the question of who is a Jew. Orthodox and Conservative Judaism 
recognize only the children of Jewish mothers, while Reform Judaism 
has opened the door to patrilineal descent. The different streams 
are also divided over what constitutes conversion. Steinhardt said 
he would lean toward ``inclusiveness,'' and open the program to any 
young person ``who chooses to voluntarily associate his or her future 
with that of the Jewish people.''
