They're cleaning up in Jakarta, Indonesia, following a week of student-led 
protests, in which 12 people were killed. Authorities are holding 
several people in custody in connection with looting and arson. Several 
businesses were looted and burned yesterday. A military spokesman 
says certain elements in Indonesia's society took advantage of student 
protests to cause trouble. The students were demanding the government 
make more democratic reforms. Indonesian President B.J. Habibie is 
promising his government will involve students and people more as 
a way to reduce the danger of mass unrest.
