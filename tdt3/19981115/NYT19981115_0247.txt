Valerie Hobson, a British movie star who stayed loyal to her husband, 
John Profumo, after he figured in a sex scandal as a member of Britain's 
Conservative government in 1963, died on Friday at a London hospital. 
She was 81. The cause was a heart attack, the British news agency 
Press Association said. Miss Hobson, a British naval officer's daughter, 
starred in British films of the 1930s and 1940s. As the the movie 
historian Ephraim Katz put it, ``She developed into one of the prime 
leading ladies of the British screen, gentle, graceful and elegant, 
the personification of the well-bred upper-crust English lady.'' She 
retired as an actress after starring as the governess, Anna, in the 
1953 stage production of the musical ``The King and I'' in London. 
That role, The Daily Telegraph said on Saturday, was her greatest 
success, and ``as an actress, she knew, like Garbo, when to quit.'' 
The British critic W.A. Darlington wrote in The New York Times that 
in the musical her singing voice ``was true and clear'' and ``besides 
the great good looks which had taken her on to movies, she proved 
to have a warm and charming personality.'' Earlier she starred as 
Estella in David Lean's ``Great Expectations'' (1946), which the critic 
Leonard Maltin has called ``one of the greatest films ever made, a 
vivid adaptation of Dickens' tale of a mysterious benefactor making 
a poor young orphan a gentleman of means.'' Another of her best-remembered 
film roles was her starring part, with Alec Guinness, in the much-applauded 
black comedy ``Kind Hearts and Coronets'' (1949). In 1954 she married 
Profumo, a Conservative member of Parliament. He stepped down in disgrace 
as Secretary of State for War in 1963 after it had become known that 
he was having an affair with a British call girl, Christine Keeler, 
who was also involved with a Soviet military attache. Later Profumo 
did much to redeem himself by throwing himself into unpaid charity 
work. Miss Hobson also did volunteer work, for a leprosy relief organization 
and for children with mental handicaps. In 1975 she and her husband 
went to Buckingham Palace, where he was honored for his good works 
by being made a Commander, Order of the British Empire. The 1963 scandal 
became the basis for the 1989 film ``Scandal'' _ which, the critic 
Vincent Canby of The New York Times wrote, ``so abridges and elides 
the real-life case that it isn't easy for a non-student to follow 
the chronology of events.'' Born in Larne in Northern Ireland, Miss 
Hobson went on to attend the Royal Academy of Dramatic Art. She began 
her performing career on the London stage, acted in some modest British 
films, then made some Hollywood movies for Universal _ largely forgettable, 
except for ``The Bride of Frankenstein,'' where she played the baron's 
wife _ and returned to Britain in the mid-1930's. Her 1939 marriage 
to Sir Anthony Havelock-Allan, a baronet who had produced several 
movies she was in, ended in divorce in 1952. Besides her husband, 
she is survived by two sons, Mark Havelock-Allan and David Profumo.
