It appears the apec economic summit in Malaysia will not end with 
a deal to cut tariffs. Delegates from 21 pacific Rim nations had hoped 
to broker an agreement to lift tariffs on more than $1 trillion worth 
of global trade. One major roadblock was Japan's refusal to lift tariffs 
on forestry and fish products while the country is in a recession. 
The pacific Rim heads of state are due to meet in Kuala Lumpur this 
week.
