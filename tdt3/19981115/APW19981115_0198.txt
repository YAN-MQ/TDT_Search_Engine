The conservative coalition that already is assured of leading Macedonia's 
next government sought to strengthen its mandate in elections deciding 
a final handful of parliament seats Sunday. Balloting was repeated 
in seven constituencies where minor irregularities occurred in the 
previous two rounds. The center-right coalition that clinched at least 
58 of the 120 seats in previous voting was hoping to gain an outright 
majority from the latest results, which will be known on Monday. The 
incumbent ruling party of ex-communists can count on having only 25 
deputies in the next parliament based on earlier results. A coalition 
of ethnic Albanian parties has won 23 seats, and another six went 
to three smaller parties. Even with seven seats still undetermined, 
the parties have been negotiating intensely on alliances under the 
next government, which will be led by the coalition of VMRO-DPMNE 
and Democratic Alternative. Ljupco Georgijevski, the leader of VMRO-DPNE, 
is the likely future premier. Even if his coalition holds a parliamentary 
majority, it would seek to include some ethnic Albanians in the cabinet 
because of sensitive ethnic issues. Ethnic Albanians form nearly a 
quarter of the country's 2.2 million people. The armed struggle for 
independence by ethnic Albanians in Kosovo, in neighboring Serbia, 
has heightened tensions. There are fears that Macedonia's ethnic Albanians 
could also press for autonomy. Part of the NATO monitoring mission 
for Kosovo _ aircraft for surveillance and accompanying personnel 
_ is being formed in Macedonia, and there are plans to station a rapid 
reaction force here as backup security for ground monitors in Kosovo. 
Both the outgoing and incoming governments place importance on having 
good relations with NATO and with Serbia, the dominant Yugoslav republic 
_ a delicate balancing act considering Western condemnation of Serbia's 
harsh crackdown on its ethnic Albanian separatists. The new Macedonian 
parliament is to be formed after the mandate of the existing one expires 
on Thursday.
