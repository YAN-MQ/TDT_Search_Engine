New York Jets Coach Bill Parcells is being investigated for possible 
tampering by the National Football League over a telephone call he 
made to quarterback Drew Bledsoe of the New England Patriots, whom 
Parcells once coached. But Parcells said after Sunday's game that 
he had made the call merely ``to thank him.'' Parcells denied Sunday's 
CBS-TV report that suggested he had telephoned Miami Dolphins Coach 
Jimmy Johnson to provide him with information about the Patriots that 
Bledsoe had given him. An NFL spokesman, Greg Aiello, said, ``We have 
made an inquiry into the reported telephone conversation with Drew 
Bledsoe and Bill Parcells.'' Aiello added that the league had written 
to the Jets early last week and asked Parcells about the conversation. 
Parcells, who is believed to have already replied to the league's 
questions, said Sunday, ``Let's take the depositions and see who did 
what.'' League rules describe as potential tampering ``any contact 
between members of one organization and another that could potentially 
interfere with employer-employee relationships. Clubs that do so do 
so at their own risk and could risk forfeiture of a draft choice.'' 
However, Parcells described the talk as an innocent outgrowth of an 
emotional reunion. Bledsoe had a problematic run under Parcells, who 
left New England after the 1996 season. Bledsoe was quoted several 
times since as denigrating Parcells. But after the Jets defeated the 
Patriots, 24-14, last month at Foxboro, Mass., Bledsoe sought out 
Parcells to shake his hand. Parcells said Bledsoe's action led him 
to call Bledsoe the next day. CBS reported Sunday that Bledsoe told 
Parcells that wide receiver Terry Glenn was injured and unlikely to 
play against the Dolphins, and that Parcells then passed on that information 
to Johnson. ``I haven't called Jimmy Johnson,'' Parcells said. Last 
year, the league conducted a similar review when Bill Belichick, the 
Jets' assistant head coach, spoke with one or two players for the 
Baltimore Ravens days before a game between the teams. No disciplinary 
action was taken against the Jets, but they were warned by the league 
not to repeat the action.
