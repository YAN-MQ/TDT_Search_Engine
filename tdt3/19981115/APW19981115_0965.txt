After visiting Guatemalan communities hard hit by Hurricane Mitch, 
French President Jacques Chirac announced Sunday that his government 
would forgive dlrs 134 million owed by all Central American countries. 
The French government announced Tuesday it was wiping away the debts 
of the two most affected nations _ Honduras and Nicaragua. But Guatemala 
and El Salvador also suffered serious damage earlier this month. Costa 
Rican crops were hurt as well. Chirac also vowed to propose that a 
Central American reconstruction fund be established, to be overseen 
by the World Bank. ``The international community should mobilize to 
reconstruct all that has been destroyed,'' Chirac told a news conference 
in Guatemala City after he visited three heavily damaged Guatemalan 
communities. Two weeks after Mitch dumped heavy rains across the isthmus, 
sweeping away entire villages and burying others in mud, foreign aid 
continues to pour into the region, where officials estimate more than 
10,000 people died. Chirac's visit is the latest by a number of world 
leaders and celebrities traveling to Central America to see the damage 
first hand. Hillary Rodham Clinton arrives Monday in Honduras for 
a previously scheduled trip to Central America, which now will be 
focused in large part on disaster relief efforts. Tipper Gore, the 
wife of Vice President Al Gore, recently toured heavily damaged regions 
of Honduras and Nicaragua. Chirac arrived in Guatemala on Saturday 
and met with Indian rights activist and Nobel peace laureate Rigoberta 
Menchu. On Monday, he was to travel to Honduras to tour the devastation 
there. Spanish Crown Prince Felipe de Borbon was in neighboring El 
Salvador on Sunday, continuing his own tour of storm ravaged areas. 
The crown prince walked along the banks of the River Lempa, some 70 
kilometers (45 miles) outside the nation's capital, where many lost 
homes when it overflowed its banks. And he stopped by a school converted 
into a shelter to house several hundred homeless people. ``We come 
to express Spain's solidarity,'' the prince said. ``We have not stood 
by with crossed arms while our Central American brothers undergo hard 
times.'' Although Mitch didn't strike El Salvador as hard as Nicaragua 
or Honduras, the storm killed 175 people in the country, according 
to government figures. Another 65 people remain missing and 84,000 
were left homeless or temporarily displaced. Total damage has been 
estimated at dlrs 113 million. Spanish First Vice President Francisco 
Alvarez, who accompanied the prince on his tour, said that his country 
would send more than dlrs 200 million to hard-hit countries. ``This 
is a tragedy without precedent,'' he said.
