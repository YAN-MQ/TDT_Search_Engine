Parts of the earth could witness a spectacular but potentially damaging 
show on Tuesday when the earth passes through the Leonid meteor storm. 
For about ten hours, the planet will get pelted with dust particles. 
Most will burn up in the atmosphere. But the fast-moving particles 
could damage some satellites, including ones operated by the U.S. 
military. That's of particular concern with American forces poised 
for action in the persian gulf. But the U.S. space command says there 
are backup satellites if one is knocked out.
