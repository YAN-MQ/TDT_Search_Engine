This is Orelon Sidney with your "CNN Headline News Weather update." 
A stationary front in the gulf of Mexico keeps a chance of rain in 
your monday morning forecast. Look for rain and snow for the upper 
peninsula of Michigan, most of minnesota and Wisconsin, southward 
to near saginaw. A cold front will be moving across Nova Scotia. That 
will mean rain and snow ending across most of New England, but look 
for a chance of snow to continue across the Rockies as a pacific storm 
system enters California and Oregon. A chance of rain is expected, 
mainly along the coast. High temperatures on Monday stay on the chilly 
side, in the 30s, 40s and 50s for most of the northern tier of states. 
We'll see 60s and 70s in the south, with southern Texas and southern 
florida topping out in the 80s. The extended forecast includes heavy 
rainfall for the northwest coast tuesday, with scattered thunderstorms 
in southern Florida through wednesday. Look for a mix of rain and 
snow, some of it heavy, for the Canadian plains stretching down into 
Wyoming and Colorado. Temperatures remain cold for the Great Lakes, 
so a mix of rain and snow on the heavy side is expected for lake superior 
and lake Michigan on Thursday. The extended forecast is at CNN.com.
