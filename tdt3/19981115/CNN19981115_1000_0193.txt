As a precaution against possible American air strikes, some Russian 
embassy employees and their families are leaving Iraq. Jill Dougherty 
reports Russia is still hoping for the best while also preparing for 
the worst. Sunday, the Russian government prepared two planes to evacuate 
its women and children from Baghdad -- 107 family members of Russian 
embassy staff. The Russian ministry of emergency affairs said the 
evacuees were driven to iran. And from there, were to be flown to 
Moscow. The step came even as the Russian foreign minister was telling 
reporters there were "good prospects" for averting military action 
against Iraq. He spoke after meeting with U.S. secretary of state 
Madeleine Albright in malaysia. The council meets again and we believe 
there are good prospects for a Political resolution of the crisis. 
Russian state television broadcast pictures of the United States military 
buildup in the Persian gulf, saying the Russian government, for its 
part, wants a strictly peaceful resolution to the crisis. But Russia 
also has been urging Iraq to resume cooperating with the United Nations 
on weapons inspection, sending messages from President Boris yeltsin 
to Iraqi President Saddam Hussein. In previous showdowns with Iraq, 
Russia launched rounds of shuttle diplomacy to Baghdad. Last March, 
Mr. Yeltsin bluntly warned President Clinton he risked starting world 
war III by taking military action against Iraq. This time, Russia 
itself seems frustrated with Saddam Hussein's brinkmanship. Here's 
how a reporter for Russian commercial TV network ntv explained it 
-- most likely, Baghdad realized that this time, it was in complete 
isolation. Russia is eager to have the crisis with Iraq resolved quickly 
-- and peacefully. It was Jill Dougherty reporting from Moscow.
