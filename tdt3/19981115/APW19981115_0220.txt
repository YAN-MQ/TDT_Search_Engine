An American teen-ager appealing an extradition order will not contest 
the facts of the case if he stands trial for murder in Israel instead 
of returning to Maryland, a defense attorney told Israel's Supreme 
Court on Sunday. David Libai, attorney for Samuel Sheinbein, said 
the defense case would focus on the mental condition of the 18-year-old 
from Silver Spring, Md., and would not involve the high cost of bringing 
witnesses from the United States. ``It will not be necessary to bring 
a single witness from abroad,'' Libai told the court. ``We will admit 
to all the facts in the case. Our contention will be the mental condition 
of the defendant.'' However, Libai told The Associated Press during 
a break in the hearing that he would not describe the plea that would 
be entered or whether it would be innocent or guilty. ``It could be 
insanity, or something like that, I don't know,'' Libai said. The 
Sheinbein case caused an uproar in Israel and the United States and 
threatened relations between the two allies. Members of the U.S. Congress 
called for delaying Israeli aid packages if Sheinbein was not returned. 
But the United States backed down when Israel's Justice Ministry rejected 
Sheinbein's citizenship claims. State attornies led by Irit Kohn sought 
to reopen the issue of Sheinbein's citizenship, but the five-judge 
Supreme Court panel refused to deal with the question. In September, 
Jerusalem District Judge Moshe Ravid upheld Sheinbein's claim to Israeli 
citizenship but said that his ties to the country were not strong 
enough to shield him from prosecution abroad. Israeli law allows for 
citizens to be tried in Israel instead of being extradited. The summary 
of the 39-page appeal argues that the lower court decision clearing 
the way for extradition ``reflects only the desire of the judge to 
arrive at a certain conclusion which is not anchored in the language 
of the law, and the language of the law cannot support it.'' Shmuel 
Sheinbein, who was sitting between two policemen, wore a gray shirt 
and conferred briefly with one of his attorneys before the appeal 
hearing began. His parents were sitting at the end of the first row. 
Sheinbein's father Sol, who watched the proceedings Sunday with trembling 
lip and sweat streaking his face, told reporters he wanted his son 
tried in Israel because he believed his life would be in danger if 
he served time in a U.S. prison. ``In the United States, his situation 
will be very difficult, and it is possible that he could be killed 
in prison there. I am very concerned for him,'' said Sol Sheinbein. 
Sheinbein fled to Israel on Sept. 21, 1997, two days after the mutilated 
body of Tello was discovered in the garage of an empty house near 
the Sheinbein home. Shortly after arriving, he was picked up by police 
and hospitalized briefly, suffering from a drug overdose. Aaron Needle, 
a second suspect, hanged himself in April on the eve of his murder 
trial was in Montgomery County, Maryland. Sheinbein claimed Israeli 
citizenship through his father who was born in pre-state Palestine 
which was under British rule before the Jewish state was founded in 
1948.
