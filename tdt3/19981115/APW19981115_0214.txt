A grieving wife got the shock of her life when the husband she thought 
was dead called her from the hospital, news reports said Sunday. Housewife 
Han Lau Loke, 47, was making preparations for her husband's funeral 
in Kuantan, 260 kilometers (150 miles) east of Kuala Lumpur. Her 48-year-old 
husband, Lee Ching Poon, had been missing since Nov. 2. Police found 
a decomposed body near her husband's car. ``Thinking that the body 
was that of my husband, I began finalizing funeral arrangements yesterday,'' 
the new Sunday Times quoted her as saying. According to the Sunday 
Star, Lee had been admitted to the state hospital in Kuantan, and 
due to a miscommunication, the wife was not informed. The decomposed 
body was kept in the morgue of the same hospital. The news reports 
did not say whose body it was. Relatives who were on their way to 
attend the funeral from all parts of the country were quickly informed 
of the mistake.
