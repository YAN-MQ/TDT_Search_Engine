Football is blocking and tackling. Simple. But tell that to a wide 
receiver. Try convincing him. All day long here in the Georgia Dome, 
where the Atlanta Falcons and the San Francisco 49ers tangled for 
first place in their division, the Falcons asked receiver Terance 
Mathis to block. All day long. Block, block, block. Asking a receiver 
to block all day long is like asking a cowboy to grab a bow and shoot 
nothing but arrows. ``They expect so much of me, I do my job, but 
I wanted the opportunity to contribute at what I do best _ catch passes,'' 
Mathis said. ``We were winning at halftime and it was sort of a bad 
reflection on my part the way I was sitting in the locker room. I 
wasn't down, but I was a little frustrated. It's a team game _ but 
I wanted to do something more than block.'' The Falcons led the 49ers, 
7-3, at halftime. Mathis had not caught a pass. Before the Falcons 
returned to the field, linebacker Cornelius Bennett saw the dejected 
look on Mathis' face. ``I told him to cheer up,'' Bennett said. ``I 
told him he would catch one ball today and it would be for a touchdown. 
I told him it might even win the game.'' Late in the game, Atlanta 
led, 24-19. The 49ers had scored on two long, fourth-quarter touchdown 
passes. And then Mathis caught one ball. That was it for his entire 
day. It went for 78 yards, and it made all of his blocking worthwhile. 
That pass with 3 minutes 9 seconds remaining from Chris Chandler insured 
the victory, 31-19, for the Falcons, the new Falcons. The team that 
after each of its scores offers a new dance _ the dirty bird _ and 
that sent the 49ers home repeating, for them, dirty words: second 
place. Atlanta is 8-2 and stands alone atop the National Football 
Conference West. San Francisco, the longtime king of the West, fell 
to 7-3 and found itself before a sellout crowd of 69,828 fans in a 
strange position. The 49ers were forced to bow to the Atlanta Falcons. 
``Very tough loss,'' 49er linebacker Ken Norton said. ``They played 
very hard. They outplayed us.'' San Francisco cornerback Darnell Walker 
said: ``The 49ers have been beating the Falcons for so long, I can 
imagine how excited they are in the other locker room.'' Excited? 
Thrilled. Because in this showdown for the West lead with six regular-season 
games remaining, the Falcons played for keeps. They took a game that 
was scoreless after a quarter and produced an 11-play, 80-yard drive 
that took nearly eight minutes of the second quarter. The drive was 
exacting and punishing with Jamal Anderson runs inside and outside. 
It showed patience and resolve and gave the Falcons a 7-0 lead 2:56 
before halftime. The 49ers gained field goals just before and quickly 
after halftime. But with an acrobatic Ray Buchanan interception and 
return to the San Francisco 1 and more Anderson running, Atlanta built 
a 17-6 lead with 14:56 to play. Only 56 seconds later, the Falcons 
gained another touchdown when Falcons tackle Shane Dronett sacked 
Steve Young, forcing a fumble, and linebacker Jessie Tuggle recovered 
at the 49er 1 and rolled into the end zone. It was the fifth fumble 
recovery for a touchdown in his career, a National Football League 
record. ``Going into the game we knew we had to close quarters on 
Steve Young and keep him from scrambling like crazy,'' Dronett said. 
``I got hold of him, and the ball popped out.'' Young, who was 21 
of 40 for 342 yards, said: ``Atlanta defended us very well, almost 
to the point of frustration.'' But Young zipped touchdown passes of 
54 yards to Terrell Owens and 65 yards to Jerry Rice over the next 
11 minutes of the fourth quarter, and the game was set for Mathis. 
One catch. That's it. ``The options on the play were the tight end; 
he was in traffic, and I was waiting for him to clear,'' said Chandler, 
who completed 12 of 21 passes for 198 yards with a touchdown and no 
interceptions. ``I had Tony Martin on a corner route, but he looked 
double-covered. Terance was running free down the sideline. He got 
a great release off the line. I thought, `Why not throw it deep instead 
of trying to run out the clock?' Terance is always a great option.'' 
One catch. That's it. ``I know the kind of person Terance is,'' Bennett 
said. ``He looked way down at halftime. But I just had a feeling. 
You know, all receivers are hungry for the ball. But blocking in this 
offense is a priority. And if you love the game, you love your team, 
you do your job.'' The Falcons did. They blocked so much because they 
ran so much. Anderson finished with 31 carries for 100 yards. Atlanta 
ran the ball 36 times, San Francisco only 20. That helped the Falcons 
gain 11 rushing first downs to the 49ers' 3. That helped the Falcons 
lead in possession time by 34:30 to 25:30. That limited the number 
of chances the 49er offense could damage the Falcons. Atlanta gained 
the lead, making its own breaks. The 49ers made the mistakes. In this 
series, in which the 49ers had won 10 of the last 12 games, it was 
novel. ``Big-time players make big-time plays,'' said Dan Reeves, 
the Falcons' coach. ``This puts us in position to have control. We've 
worked hard. They make it fun. They've done everything we've asked.''
