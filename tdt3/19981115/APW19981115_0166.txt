Iraq's letter welcoming back U.N. arms inspectors means any attack 
carried out by the United States would amount to ``naked aggression'' 
without legal grounds, an Iraqi official said Sunday. The Iraqi letter, 
sent Saturday to U.N. Secretary-General Kofi Annan, said the government 
of President Saddam Hussein was reversing decisions taken in August 
and October to halt cooperation with the inspectors. President Bill 
Clinton's National Security Adviser, Sandy Berger, described it as 
failing to meet American conditions by being ``neither unequivocal 
nor unconditional'' and said a punishing military strike remained 
an option. The U.N. Security Council adjourned late Saturday after 
five hours of inconclusive discussion and scheduled a further session 
on Sunday. Khudeir ad-Duleimi, acting director of external information 
and editor of the state-run Baghdad Observer, told Associated Press 
Television News that Iraq's letter ``deprived the United States of 
any pretext to commit its aggression.'' ``If they want to launch an 
aggression, it would be a naked aggression without any political or 
legal justification,'' he said. U.N. sanctions were imposed after 
Iraq invaded neighboring Kuwait in 1990, sparking war in the Persian 
Gulf. They limit the sale of oil and other trade dealings and have 
devastated the Iraqi economy. The Security Council has said the sanctions 
will not be lifted until the U.N. Special Commission and the International 
Atomic Energy Agency certify that Iraq is free of weapons of mass 
destruction. Editorials Sunday in state-run newspapers said the United 
States was seeking any opportunity to attack Iraq. All front pages 
carried the text of the letter to Annan, along with photos of Saddam 
meeting with his Revolutionary Command Council and the leadership 
of the ruling Baath party, which approved the letter. Al-Thawra, the 
newspaper published by the Baath party, said ``the leadership's decision 
pulled the carpet out from under the American administration, which 
continues to present misleading information about Iraq ... and hunts 
continuously for opportunities to start an aggression.'' It accused 
the United States of attempting to ``destabilize security and safety 
in the region'' and ``blackmail'' Arab countries to support its threats. 
Babil, which is published by Saddam's son Odai, said the American 
threats of a military strike were seen by Iraqis as ``a cruel joke.'' 
Meanwhile, Secretary of State Madeleine Albright will cut short her 
visit to the 21-member Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation forum in 
Malaysia, State Department officials said Sunday. Albright was to 
head back to Washington Sunday night to deal with the situation with 
Iraq.
