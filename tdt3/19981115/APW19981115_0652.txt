Despite a strong showing in the first round of Czech Senate elections, 
leaders of the main opposition party cautioned Sunday that they weren't 
assured of increasing their strength in Parliament. The Civic Democratic 
Party of ex-Premier Vaclav Klaus advanced the most candidates to the 
second round of any party competing in the Friday and Saturday elections. 
Updated results early Sunday showed they had qualified for runoffs 
in 22 of 27 districts. The governing Social Democrats are next with 
15 candidates in next weekend's runoffs, a showing they called disappointing. 
A grouping of four opposition parties led by the Christian Democrats 
and Freedom Union finished third with 14 candidates, while Communist 
candidates advanced it in three districts. But no one received the 
majority needed to win outright victory, and Civic Democratic Party 
officials cautioned that the results were inconclusive and could be 
reversed in the next round, as they were in 1996. ``It was just the 
semifinals,'' Klaus said on Czech television. ``Nobody should rejoice 
too much.'' The first round, however, was a ``good signal for the 
future'' because it did not confirm an anticipated turn to the left, 
he said. The senatorial voting is considered a test of support for 
Prime Minister Milos Zeman's government, which took over from Klaus' 
party after elections in June. The stagnant Czech economy and poor 
law enforcement are among the top issues. A third of the seats in 
the 81-member Senate are at stake. The top two vote-getters in each 
district will face each other in the runoffs next Friday and Saturday. 
The Civic Democratic Party currently controls 29 seats in the Senate, 
12 of them up for grabs in the vote. The Social Democrats have 26 
senators, with six up for re-election. The rest of the seats are held 
by four smaller parties, including the Christian Democrats, Freedom 
Union and Communists. The Senate is by far the less important of the 
two legislative bodies in the Czech Republic, confirming or rejecting 
laws adopted by the lower chamber. Complete unofficial results from 
local elections, which also took place Friday and Saturday, showed 
that independent candidates fared well in small villages while the 
Civic Democratic Party led in big towns. More than 60,000 local posts 
were at stake. Official results were expected by Monday.
