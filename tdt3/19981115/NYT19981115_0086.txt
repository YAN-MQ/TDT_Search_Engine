NATIONAL FORECAST A band of snow will develop to the north of the 
track of low pressure as it moves east from the central Great Lakes. 
The steadiest snow Monday will be from northern Michigan to the Adirondacks 
of northern New York. Patchy light snow will streak into northern 
New England on Monday afternoon and become steadier overnight. Accumulations 
will average a few inches across these regions; however, up to six 
inches of snow will fall in some of the higher elevations. To the 
south of the low, clouds and spotty rain will occur, spreading from 
southern Michigan early Monday to southern New England by Monday night. 
The Middle Atlantic states will be partly to mostly sunny and mild 
as breezes from the southwest increase. Farther south, a weak disturbance 
will promote clouds and scattered light showers from the eastern Gulf 
Coast to the Carolina coast. Ample sunshine and comfortable warmth 
will prevail over a large area from the southwestern states to the 
central and southern Plains. Some patchy low clouds near the Texas 
coast will dissipate gradually. Mostly cloudy and cold conditions 
will occur from the northern Mississippi Valley to the eastern Dakotas. 
Meanwhile, breezes from the west will deliver milder air and ample 
sunshine near the east slopes of the northern Rockies. A strengthening 
disturbance will promote mostly cloudy skies over northwestern states. 
Patchy showers will develop across southern parts of Oregon and Idaho. 
Steadier rain will develop in the onshore flow over the Olympic peninsula. 
FOCUS: STUDYING METEORS Major meteor showers like the Leonids that 
will reach a peak on Wednesday always prompt telephone calls to meteorologists 
seeking explanations of the event. However, despite their name, meteorologists 
have no special expertise concerning the meteors that illuminate the 
night sky. Astronomers are the scientists who can lay claim to detailed 
knowledge of meteor showers. Long ago, when science was in its infancy, 
the fields of meteorology and astronomy were more closely allied. 
Indeed, the word meteorology comes from the Greek meaning ``the study 
of things in the sky.''
