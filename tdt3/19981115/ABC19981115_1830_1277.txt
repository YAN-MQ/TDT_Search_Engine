Attorneys general from most of the states in the nation will spend 
this week studying a new deal with the tobacco industry. It will be 
officially announced tomorrow. Under the plan, the tobacco companies 
would pay $206 billion over the next 25 years to compensate states 
for the cost of treating sick smokers. The agreement would not protect 
the companies from individual or class-action lawsuits.
