As President Clinton left the White House briefing room to escape 
questions, his national security adviser, Sandy Berger, stepped up, 
fiddled with electric lectern switches and muttered into a live microphone: 
``How do we lower this damn thing?'' In a nutshell, that summed up 
the Clinton administration's half-measured approach to the threat 
posed by Saddam Hussein. Its limited aim is to lower temporarily Iraq's 
ability to make weapons with which to blackmail the world. That desire 
for delay is why Clinton hesitated for months after Iraq shut down 
inspections that were getting too close to finding weapons. It's why 
he sought a last-minute negotiation, and why he aborted air strikes. 
When Saddam's semiannual promise to permit ``unfettered'' inspections 
finally came, the U.S. president eagerly took yes for an answer. His 
acceptance of the dictator's delaying tactic may mean peace for his 
remaining time, though hardly peace for our time. His decision to 
abort _ an unprecedented display of presidential irresolution _ was 
consistent with what Clinton says is ``the best outcome'': a new round 
of searches starting from scratch, now that the Iraqis have had plenty 
of time to conceal anew their weapons development. The central question 
remains: Is off-and-on inspecting the best outcome? Consider what 
is likely to happen, based on what has gone before. Saddam, having 
``backed down'' yet again, will let the inspectors go wherever they 
want for the next three to six months. That costs him nothing: Saddam 
has reshuffled the deck, as our Scott Ritter puts it, and it will 
take at least that long for the CIA's sources to suggest the new hiding 
places in a large country. Meanwhile, Iraq's anthrax and nerve-gas 
stockpiling will proceed apace, as replacement Russians and others 
on the U.N. inspection team tip off the ex-spymaster Yevgeny Primakov 
to its plans, thereby ensuring that no ``surprise'' inspections actually 
surprise. American forces stay on alert and stick around the area 
until we get tired and bored. When somebody suggests we charge the 
billions this costs us against our U.N. arrears, home will come our 
sailors, home from the sea. Then, sometime next summer, under heat 
from Primakov &AMP; Co., the United Nations' complaisant Kofi Annan 
will say: ``See? Nothing really sensational has been found. Time to 
lift sanctions.'' Little by little, in Saddam's inimitable style, 
the fetters of inconvenience and slowly rising defiance will go back 
on the inspectors. Lest we offend Moscow and Paris, Secretary of State 
Madeleine Albright will again support Annan in resisting what he deplores 
as ``confrontational inspections.'' What then? The Clinton White House 
would have us believe that as soon as Saddam claps one little fetter 
on inspections, boom! _ without warning _ missiles will fly, Stealth 
aircraft will pose for cameras and B-52s will smart-bomb until it's 
over over there. But you can't do that without withdrawing the inspectors 
and evacuating diplomatic missions. Figure on plenty of warning _ 
time for new non-negotiations at the last minute _ and another story 
of Saddam ``backing down'' followed by the triumphant announcement 
of the success of our resolve. One more such diplomatic victory, as 
King Pyrrhus said, and we are undone. Perhaps, next time, Saddam will 
take the week's bombing. The loss of innocent life would not harm 
his regime, and what Clinton calls the ``degrading'' of Iraqi weapon-making 
is in the eye of the degrader. Contrary to Clinton's belief, the ``best 
outcome'' is not the status quo; it is the removal of the growing 
threat. In pulling our bombing punch, the president offered the hope 
that the Kurds under our protection may hook up with Iraqis we slip 
money to and, listening avidly to our radio broadcasts, overthrow 
Saddam. Worth trying, but quite a covert burden on a CIA otherwise 
focused on diplomatic monitoring of the West Bank. Come the unraveling 
of the latest agreement next year, we will see if candidate George 
W. Bush shares the containment-only purpose of his father and Clinton, 
or if Sens. McCain and Lugar can make the case for dislodging Saddam 
before he can develop the terror weapons he would surely use. The 
next president will have to ``lower this damn thing'' before it razes 
an American city.
