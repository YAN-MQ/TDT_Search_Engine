The image of a howling coyote is a romantic symbol of the still untamed 
wild West to some, but to many hunters and ranchers it represents 
a destructive predator. And so in another Western tradition, hunters 
from several states gathered during the weekend to compete in the 
annual National Coyote Calling Contest. The hunters, who came from 
as far away as South Africa and as near as Colorado, paid an entrance 
fee of about $150 each to compete for a purse of several thousand 
dollars, won by a man who killed nine coyotes. The hunt was legal 
and included about 150 hunters who worked in pairs over a day and 
a half in the mountains here in south-central Wyoming that are home 
to sheep and cattle as well as antelope and deer. Using only a specialized 
``call'' to lure the coyotes, the hunters killed 200 of the 545 coyotes 
they said they had spotted. Hunting contests across the nation, primarily 
in Western states, have had environmentalists facing off against farmers 
and ranchers. ``While acceptable at one point in the past, there is 
no biological or ecological justification for these types of activities 
anymore,'' said Andrea Lococo, Rocky Mountain coordinator of the Fund 
for Animals, which is based in New York. ``Traditions in the West 
are sometimes hard to break,'' Ms. Lococo added, ``but we find this 
to be particularly egregious _ killing for kicks, for fun and money, 
bloodsport.'' Such opposition has led to the cancellation of two contests 
in Arizona earlier this year, a review of the regulations on hunting 
contests in that state and new restrictions on small game hunting 
in Colorado. In both Arizona and Colorado, hunters and animal-rights 
activists have found themselves in an awkward alignment over the issue. 
``Those contests give a black eye to hunting,'' said Diane Gansauer, 
executive director of the Colorado Wildlife Federation. ``It's as 
much hunting as shooting fish in a barrel.'' But one of the hunters, 
Jeff Barnes, a 36-year old electrical contractor from Utah, said: 
``We would hunt for no money. And we probably only kill 2 percent 
of what the state kills.'' Johnson, and most of the hunters here, 
said this hunt would not make a dent in the local coyote population, 
and that they kill far fewer than the government agencies, like state 
Animal Damage Control agencies, which kill thousands of coyotes annually 
with poisons and in aerial hunts. The attitudes of many state officials 
about the hunting contests were summed up by Wyoming Gov. Jim Geringer 
in a recent letter to an opponent of the contest: ``Briefly, these 
species are unregulated and are allowed to be taken by any legal method, 
anytime during the year. The number of coyotes taken is relatively 
small compared to the statewide coyote population and the economic 
impacts of the losses of livestock and wildlife.'' Though she oppose 
the weekend coyote hunt, Ms. Gansauer, who is a hunter, herself said: 
``It's our strong opinion this is not an animal rights issue. The 
hunters need to police their own so the reputation of hunting is not 
in serious jeopardy.'' The contests have historically involved prairie 
dogs and coyotes because of their abundance and damage they can do 
to livestock, grazing areas and household pets. In Arizona, home of 
the Phoenix Coyotes hockey team, there are an estimated 200,000 to 
300,000 coyotes, and there are unofficial estimates in Wyoming of 
about 100,000 coyotes. In Wyoming, the second largest wool-producing 
state in the nation, ranchers and hunters say the contests are a cost-effective 
way to manage the coyote population. ``Man is supposed to be a manager 
of the land and animals,'' said Dan Thompson, a sheep rancher and 
founder of the contest here. ``We want to live with them, not in spite 
of them.'' The Wyoming Department of Agriculture recorded 59,000 sheep 
and lambs lost to coyote predation in 1997, which accounted for 69 
percent of the total loss of sheep and lambs. There are no statistics 
to show how many sheep were killed by other predators such as bobcats, 
eagles and dogs. Wool production in Wyoming is a $55-million-a-year 
industry and losses from predators in 1997 was $7.73 million _ $3.56 
million of that from coyotes. Another 15,000 sheep and lambs were 
lost to disease, severe weather and old age in 1997. Over-population 
of coyotes also can increase diseases such as distemper, rabies and 
mange among their packs, as well as decrease big-game populations 
of antelope, deer and elk, the Geringer pointed out. However, this 
reasoning is no consolation to David Gaillard of Predator Project, 
a nonprofit conservation group in Bozeman, Mont. ``It's rooted in 
the culture to make the West safe for people and livestock,'' Gaillard 
said. ``But simply shooting the coyotes doesn't solve predation. The 
coyotes respond by producing larger litters and dispersing adults.'' 
According to a U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service survey in 1996, 13 percent 
of men and 1 percent of women in the United States go hunting; 14 
million hunting licenses were sold last year. As the hunters face 
opposition, including that from sometimes violent animal rights groups 
such as the Animal Liberation Front, they shy away from discussing 
their hunts. Many will go from here to the World Coyote Calling Contest 
in Elko, Nev., next weekend or to another local hunt in the state. 
``We're not barbarians,'' said Allen York, the winner of this year's 
hunt here. ``But the `anti's' spread so much negativity.'' Last year, 
a photograph in the local paper showed the carcasses of 242 coyotes 
side by side in a dirt parking lot sparked outrage over the hunt. 
This year, each animal was hastily loaded into a horse trailer as 
hunters in camouflage stood around sipping light beer and diet soft 
drinks, discussing sightings of wild horses and the bone-chilling 
wind. The pelts are used for trim on the collars and cuffs of leather 
and other winter coats. The proceeds from sales of the white to gray 
and fawn-colored pelts, at about $12 to $14 a piece, will go to a 
domestic violence project in Wyoming. ``About the worst thing to happen 
to hunting was Walt Disney,'' said Thompson. ``The animated voice 
doesn't make them human. ``The coyote is smart, elusive. I respect 
him,'' he said. ``I don't hunt him because I hate him, but we have 
to have checks and balances.''
