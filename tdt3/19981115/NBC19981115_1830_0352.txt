Iraq's reaction to today's events and the close call it had with being 
bombarded by American missiles -- a declaration of victory. In Baghdad, 
here's NBC's Ron Allen. The celebration is called "Baghdad day," honoring 
this ancient city that's survived more than 1,200 years. But these 
days, it's all another reason to honor Saddam Hussein, for protecting 
his nation from imminent attack. Tonight, Iraq claims it's won over 
the world, declaring victory over the United States but warning of 
dangers ahead. They are planning a conspiracy against Iraq, why they 
are planning a Conspiracy against Iraq, because Iraq is defending 
its rights, living peacefully in the region. Iraq doesn't threaten 
anyone in the region. The toast is first to our sect general. Celebrations 
tonight as well at U.N. headquarters, Baghdad. The weapons inspectors 
could rejoin the staff that stayed behind tomorrow or Tuesday. Former 
inspector Scott Ritter says their job won't be easy. It's back to 
square one. Look, the inspectors, in order to find these weapons of 
mass destruction, it's a continuous process. You can't just pick up 
where you stopped. Because the Iraqis shuffle the deck, you start 
with a new game every time they shuffle. Tonight, the inspectors still 
awaiting instructions in nearby bahrain. The plan may call for them 
to immediately investigate a controversial sight, a test of Iraq's 
promise of unconditional access. But a quick test may be just what 
the Iraqis expect, the reason Ritter urges taking it slow. The inspectors 
need to deconstruct the body of lies Iraq has surrounded its weapons 
program with, and then, only then, can we do a test, once we know 
what we are going after, where it is and what we are trying to achieve. 
That will take time. While the U.S. insists Iraq still has the ability 
to make huge amounts of chemical and biological weapons, tonight the 
government here again claimed it has no program for weapons of mass 
destruction. Confrontation seems all but inevitable once the U.N. 
investigation teams return. Ron Allen, NBC news, Baghdad.
