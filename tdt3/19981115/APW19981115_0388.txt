Serb authorities have invited Kosovo Albanians to hold face-to-face 
talks on a political settlement for the restive province, state media 
reported Sunday. There was no immediate response by ethnic Albanian 
leaders to the offer by Serbian President Milan Milutinovic. The Albanians 
have rejected several such invitations in the past, but the latest 
comes amid a flurry of U.S.-led diplomacy and could signal that the 
Serbs and Albanians are closer to long-sought direct talks. ``There 
are all conditions for a direct meeting and discussion on finding 
a political solution for Kosovo problems,'' said the statement issued 
by the Serbian president's office. Milutinovic is prepared to lead 
the talks Wednesday, it said. Christopher Hill, the U.S. envoy for 
Kosovo, met with both Milutinovic and ethnic Albanian political leader 
Ibrahim Rugova in the previous two days as part of efforts to mediate 
a lasting settlement for the province, where the ethnic Albanian-dominated 
population favors independence. Scattered violence has continued in 
Kosovo despite an Oct. 12 agreement in which Yugoslav President Slobodan 
Milosevic pledged to halt his months-long offensive against separatist 
rebels and start talks aimed at restoring Kosovo's autonomy. Milosevic's 
potential involvement in talks with the Albanians is not clear. The 
Yugoslav leader is scheduled to meet on Monday, however, with U.S. 
diplomat William Walker, head of the still-forming international monitoring 
team that is to verify the status of Milosevic's pledges in Kosovo. 
Walker was heading to Belgrade from Pristina on Sunday for the talks, 
said a spokesman for the Organization for Security and Cooperation 
in Europe, which is organizing the verification mission. OSCE Chairman 
Bronislaw Geremek, the Polish foreign minister, requested the meeting 
``to raise concerns about the levels of violence in Kosovo and the 
tit-for-tat nature it appears to be taking,'' spokesman Duncan Bullivant 
said. In an indication ethnic Albanian rebels have no intention of 
scaling down their fight for independence, the Kosovo Liberation Army 
on Sunday demanded financial donations. The KLA said in a statement 
published in the Albanian-language newspaper Koha Ditore that ethnic 
Albanians ``are obliged to help the KLA fund inside the country because 
by helping the war, they help freedom, independence and democracy 
in Kosovo.'' ``We ask from our citizens wherever they are in the world 
without hesitation to help and to join our just war of liberation,'' 
the statement said. The KLA receives financial help from ethnic Albanians 
living abroad, mainly in Switzerland and Germany. The rebel force 
opposes any political settlement that does not entail full independence 
for Kosovo.
