Congressional leaders are reacting cautiously to today's diplomatic 
breakthrough. But they welcome President Clinton's call for a "new 
government" in baghdad. We have a very, very dangerous international 
climate, where terrorists are at war with the United States, where 
you have Iraq in effect flaunting u.N., flauntding international law. 
The Senate passed a resolution early this year to try Saddam Hussein 
as a War criminal. There has been a revision of the U.S. legal doctrine 
as to how to handle foreign leaders when there is terrorism, when 
there are acts of war against the United States, and I think that 
the president has put that issue into play today. I think it requires 
more analysis. My instinct that we'll come out with a policy to do 
what it takes to get rid of monsters like Saddam Hussein. The Iraqi 
people also have to know that we in America have no quarrel with them 
and there are many of us who want the sanctions to end. At the same 
time, we know that this government has in fact put together VX, did 
intend or may have well attached it to war heads. That this government 
has in fact used poison gas against its own people and that this government 
in fact is a major threat to the security of the region and security 
of the world. So in a sense, this is up to the Iraqi people.
