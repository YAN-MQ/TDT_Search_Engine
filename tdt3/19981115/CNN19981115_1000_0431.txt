Boeing and the FAA are investigating whether cracked hydraulic valves 
that were intended to correct possible flaws made their way into the 
rudder assemblies of 1,000 737 jets. Cracks were found in nine valves 
still at the manufacturer. Boeing says the planes are safe to fly, 
even with the faulty valves. The national transportation safety board 
is investigating whether a Potential flaw in the 737's original rudder 
assembly could have caused several 737 crashes. Boeing says there's 
no proof of any such link.
