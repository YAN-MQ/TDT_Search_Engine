U.N. inspectors insist they need full access to Iraq sites to do their 
job properly. Without it, one U.N. official says their duties would 
be meaningless. At the outcome of all this is that the commission 
and its inspectors have only a limited ability. There is a legitimate 
question that could be asked about whether a partial system of inspection 
provides a full sense of security. Those are tough judgments. We have 
been telling the security council that we need full access. We believe 
that Iraq could provide us the full information that they require. 
They have not done so. And if the demand were made for them to put 
documents on the table tomorrow, we believe that they could do that.
