Once shown only in the United States, the PBS children's show "Sesame 
street" is seen now in 140 countries. Jill Brooke examines the program's 
success as it celebrates its 30th birthday. Sunny days "Sesame street" 
is seen by a lot more people than when it started 30 years ago. But 
its mission is the same -- it teaches kids about the alphabet -- a-b-c-d 
And about what can be done with those letters. It's found in words 
like open and wow it's found in octopus it's found in cow The show 
also teaches kids how to count -- 1, 2 -- How to observe -- Down, 
up -- Down. And how to be a friend. Two good friends me and you each 
with an opposite point of view I think the most important thing that 
we do is we show children a wide variety of people living together 
in a neighborhood -- all races, all cultures, all monsters, a little 
girl in a wheelchair. And I think that shows children that different 
is not something to be frightened of and that all kinds of different 
people live together and support each other. Oddly enough, the biggest 
challenge facing "Sesame street" is its success. Originally designed 
for preschool kids, now younger kids are also watching. It's a tightrope 
that you're walking because a 2-year-old is very different from a 
4-year-old or a 5-year-old. But they manage to do it, introducing 
segments like "elmo's world" for the little tots. da da da da And 
having big bird skits for the older ones who aren't only in preschool. 
Aside from its baby-sitting duties, parents also love it for other 
reasons. Wabba, wabba, wabba It seems to have been written for adults. 
It's not only the familiar faces, but the parodies in songs from Tony 
bennett -- slime me to the Moon Bruce springsteen -- cause kids like 
you and me baby were born to add And even Judy Garland -- you made 
me love you me didn't want to do it Of course, this is the show's 
intention. It's a connection between the older generation and the 
newer generation. It's something existing in both their lives. Perhaps 
this is the reason that it's hard to find anyone who doesn't love 
"Sesame street." Jill Brooke, "CNN Entertainment News," New York.
