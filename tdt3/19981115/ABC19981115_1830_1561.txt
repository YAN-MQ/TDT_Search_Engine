Finally tonight, there will always be an England, as the refrain goes, 
but it may not always look the same. ABC's Jim Wooten on the hair-raising 
-- make that wig-raising -- scheme now before the house of lords. 
In this land of pomp and circumstance, no circumstance is more pompous 
than the queen's opening of parliament, a ceremony unchanged since 
henry VIII was in diapers. The lord chancellor, this fellow with the 
big hair, can't even turn his back on the queen. Because she can't 
be trusted? No, out of respect -- though last year was the last time. 
"This backward walk is silly," he told the queen. And she said, "fine, 
just don't do it anymore." And now, the lord chancellor, who presides 
in the house of lords in full regalia, wants to get rid of that, too. 
For male adults of sound mind like myself, I hope I am, that the days 
of breaches and tights and buckled shoes should really go. "why not 
an ordinary business suit," lord Irvine asks. For traditionalists 
like baroness young, he may as well be advocating nudity. Next year, 
we'll have something else. We've already had a cutting down of the 
ceremony of introduction, and all this is chipping away at the house 
of lords to no good purpose at all. Although the issue of breaches 
might be seen as a slightly small and trivial issue, for many peers 
it is considered the thin end of the wedge. Now, if this is the thin 
end of the wedge, then I don't like it at all. Michael Skinner's haberdashery 
makes all those outfits and costumes. To have one of the officers, 
great officers of state, talking about downgrading his illustrious 
uniforms, I think it's an absolute travesty. Indeed! And from the 
traditions of saville row to other, more common streets of london, 
the argument is no less intense. Britain is steeped in tradition, 
and it should be kept like that. I think it should change, yeah. I 
think it's pretty stuffy. Change the underwear and leave the top, 
okay? I agree that you shouldn't walk backward. That, I think, is 
absurd. But to wear the uniform, you know, is England. Ah, yes, the 
uniform is England. How very British. And when the house of lords 
debates and votes on this question tomorrow, that will probably be 
its verdict, too. For a few more centuries at least, the lord chancellor 
will be stuck with the wig, the robes and the tights. Jim Wooten, 
ABC News, London.
