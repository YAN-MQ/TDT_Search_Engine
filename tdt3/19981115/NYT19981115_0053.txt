The Microsoft trial is not merely a legal prizefight. With its parade 
of witnesses and mountains of documents, it has opened a window to 
the inner workings of Microsoft Corp. and how it deals with the rest 
of the computer industry, raw material for a digital-age ``Dynasty.'' 
Last week's episode: Family Feud. The story told in a federal courtroom 
in Washington was how, from the spring of 1995 to the summer of 1996, 
an extraordinary rift developed between Microsoft and Intel Corp. 
_ partners in the most lucrative business relationship in modern capitalism 
_ and how it was patched up. At the time, people in the computer industry 
knew about the Microsoft-Intel split over multimedia software developed 
by Intel, called ``native signal processing,'' or NSP. But the depth 
of the rift, its significance and the personal animosities involved 
were not really apparent until last week with the testimony of an 
executive of Intel and internal e-mail and documents from both companies 
that were submitted as evidence. The crack in the partnership was 
repaired personally by the chief executives of the two companies, 
Bill Gates of Microsoft and Andrew Grove of Intel, over lengthy dinners, 
which included shouting matches and frequent e-mail dialogues. In 
the end, Intel backed down from a technology initiative that Grove 
once described in an e-mail to Gates as ``key to the growth of the 
PC industry.'' The antitrust issue in the case is: Why did that happen? 
The government argues that the Intel episode demonstrates how Microsoft 
unfairly uses its market muscle to bend the industry to its will _ 
in this case even Intel. Nothing so sinister, Microsoft scoffs. Intel, 
Microsoft says, was eventually persuaded to stop pushing a misguided 
technology effort that could have hobbled the rollout of new personal 
computers running Windows 95, the operating system Microsoft released 
in August 1995. It was a decision that assuredly helped Microsoft, 
the company admits, but it was also in Intel's enlightened self-interest 
because the giant chip maker's main business is selling new computers 
powered by Intel microprocessors, and the increased demands of each 
new iteration of Windows sends buyers scurrying to buy more powerful 
computers. To be sure, Microsoft and Intel often debate which technology 
standards to champion. But the debate over NSP became a more public 
and a more significant issue than most. Intel's senior executives 
had declared at industry conferences that NSP could help encourage 
more households to buy personal computers because improving audio 
and video performance would make ``the PC sing and dance.'' And as 
a software effort, NSP was clearly seen by Microsoft as an unwelcome 
foray into its domain. ``The main issue was that it was crucial software 
that Microsoft did not control,'' said Richard Doherty, president 
of Envisioneering, a research firm in Seaford, N.Y. The e-mail submitted 
in court sheds light on the ambivalence in the Microsoft-Intel relationship, 
painting an environment in which they circle each other warily. There 
is mutual distrust and personal sniping on both sides. Yet ultimately, 
the benefits to both sides of the sometimes bumpy ``Wintel'' partnership 
led them back to a pragmatic accommodation. By April 1995, Microsoft 
had awakened to the potential significance of Intel's NSP effort. 
After a meeting with Microsoft executives, Gerald Holzhammer, an Intel 
executive, wrote in an e-mail to his colleagues on April 13, 1995, 
that Microsoft was ``upset with us being in `their' operating system 
space _ no surprise there.'' By May, Gates decided to protest directly 
to Grove. In an e-mail on May 25, 1995, Gates called NSP ``a significant 
problem here that is on a path to get a lot worse.'' Clearly upset 
by software being developed at the Intel Architecture Labs in Hillsboro, 
Ore., he complained to Grove, ``I don't understand why Intel funds 
a group that is against Windows 95.'' Later, he added, ``In software 
you have a group that won't allow us to lead and has all the prestige 
and profits of Intel to drive them forward.'' Commenting on Gates' 
e-mail, Paul Maritz, a senior Microsoft executive, noted on the same 
day that there was ``a strong faction within Intel'' that wanted to 
use NSP as a step toward expanding Intel's intellectual property claims 
in the industry. ``We have to be very careful about this,'' Maritz 
wrote in his e-mail to Gates and others, ``given our recent discussions 
about needing balance to Intel in the market'' _ an apparent reference 
to Microsoft's work with other chip makers to keep Intel from becoming 
more powerful. On June 8, 1995, Grove made his appeal for NSP to Gates. 
Terming it ``key to the growth of the PC industry,'' Grove added that 
while Microsoft and Intel had ``differences of opinion on the detailed 
approach,'' he was confident that the two companies could resolve 
them. In a philosophical digression, Grove wrote, ``I think Microsoft 
and Intel have special responsibilities toward the PC industry.'' 
Later, he added: ``If you believe that what we are trying to do is 
good for the industry, please help us (plural us: Intel and Microsoft 
and whoever else needs to participate) achieve it. Merely being critical 
of what we have undertaken is not helpful.'' On June 22, 1995, Maritz 
wrote to Ron Whittier, an Intel executive, to inform Intel of Microsoft's 
stance on NSP in no uncertain terms. Microsoft, he wrote, had told 
personal computer makers that ``we have major issues with NSP and 
our advice to them is NOT to use it.'' On July 7, 1995, Gates sent 
an e-mail to a group of Microsoft executives briefing them on a three-hour 
dinner with Grove two days earlier in San Jose, Calif. ``Fundamentally,'' 
Gates began, ``Intel and Microsoft have not been doing a very good 
job of working with each other in most areas.'' ``The main problem 
between us right now is NSP,'' Gates wrote. ``We are trying to convince 
them to basically not ship NSP.'' Not known for being awed by the 
intelligence of others, Gates included an aside about Grove: ``Although 
Andy is super-smart in software-related areas and in some aspects 
of the PC market, it is amazing what he doesn't know.'' By August 
1995, when Windows 95 was released, Microsoft's pressure on Intel 
and personal computer makers to step back from NSP had succeeded, 
Steven McGeady, an Intel vice president testified last week. By then, 
McGeady said, he believed Intel's NSP program had been ``shot in the 
head.'' In an Oct. 18, 1995, e-mail, Gates told several executives 
that Intel felt that after Microsoft's ``NSP chill'' personal computer 
makers would not do anything to fine-tune their machines to exploit 
Intel's new multimedia chip, the MMX, for Windows 95 ``unless we say 
it's OK.'' Gates added, ``This is good news,'' because it meant the 
computer makers ``are listening to us.'' The regular meetings between 
Gates and Grove continued. While conflicts persisted, especially over 
what Microsoft viewed as Intel's support for its rivals in the Internet 
software business, like Netscape Communications Corp. and Sun Microsystems 
Inc., the Microsoft-Intel relationship clearly was on the mend after 
the NSP issue was settled. On June 9, 1996, Gates wrote an e-mail 
to his senior executives, briefing them on a two and a half hour meeting 
he had had two days earlier with Grove. ``Our relationship with Intel 
is advancing on many fronts,'' Gates began in a lengthy e-mail sent 
at 10:26 p.m. on a Sunday. The strengthening of the Microsoft-Intel 
relationship was a message Gates was eager to communicate to a wider 
audience. He and Grove had recently given a chummy performance for 
Fortune magazine. He passed this along in his e-mail to his colleagues: 
``The Fortune magazine coming out in a week features a joint interview 
with Andy and I where we are very friendly to each other.''
