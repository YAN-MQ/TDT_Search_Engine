A champion of press freedoms welcomed Cuba's decision allowing The 
Associated Press to reopen its bureau in Havana. Danilo Arbilla, chairman 
of the Inter American Press Association's Committee on Freedom of 
the Press and Information, called the Cuban government's action a 
``positive development'' in press relations on Saturday. Arbilla, 
of the Uruguayan newsweekly Busqueda, has pressed for greater press 
liberties within Cuba as head of the key committee of the IAPA, which 
is composed of more than 1,300 publishers and editors from 30 countries. 
He called the decision another apparent ``sign of opening'' by Cuban 
President Fidel Castro's government. After 29 years, The Associated 
Press will reopen its bureau in Cuba. Approval came from the Cuban 
Foreign Ministry on Thursday during a visit to Havana by a delegation 
of senior AP officials. The office will be the news agency's 95th 
international bureau and its 240th overall, including bureaus in the 
United States.
