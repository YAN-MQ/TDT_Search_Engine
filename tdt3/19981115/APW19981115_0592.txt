Singer and medieval musicologist Barbara Thornton, whose performances 
of an opera by a 12th-century abbess popularized the little-known 
work with scholars and medieval music aficionados, died Nov. 8. She 
was 48. Thornton, who died of complications from a brain tumor at 
the Caritas hospice in Cologne, founded and directed the Cologne-based 
Sequentia medieval music ensemble with her partner, Benjamin Bagby. 
A specialist in the sacred music of Hildegard von Bingen, Thornton 
introduced the abbess's opera ``Odro Virtutum'' to a wide audience 
when Sequentia performed it for the first time in 1982. The ensemble 
has since recorded all of Hildegard's music, and its summer production 
of the opera at New York's Lincoln Center Festival was one of three 
versions performed this year. ``Her instrument was her voice, which 
was particularly suited to medieval music,'' said her mother, Margaret 
Thornton, of Exeter, New Hampshire. Thornton was born in Summit, N.J., 
and graduated from Sarah Lawrence College. At 19 she moved to Europe, 
where she studied in the Netherlands and Italy, and received a diploma 
from the Schola Cantorum Basiliensis in Basel, Switzerland. After 
moving to Cologne, she founded Sequentia in 1977 with Bagby, a singer 
and medieval harpist. In addition to the works of Hildegard, the ensemble 
has recorded sacred works from Spanish monasteries and courtly love 
songs from the 14th and 15th centuries. In addition to her mother, 
Thornton is survived by her father, Fletcher Thornton, also of Exeter, 
New Hampshire, and sisters Susan Frey Starbuck of Seattle and Anne 
Thornton Bridges of Woodstock, Vermont. Thornton will be buried in 
Ascona, Switzerland, her mother said.
