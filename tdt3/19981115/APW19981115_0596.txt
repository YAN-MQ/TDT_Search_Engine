Saying ``our rifle is ready,'' Palestinian leader Yasser Arafat hinted 
darkly at armed conflict Sunday, prompting a sharp rebuke from Israel. 
The escalation of rhetoric came as U.S. envoy Dennis Ross sought to 
jump start implementation of the latest Mideast peace accord. A senior 
adviser to Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu said Arafat's 
comments were a ``declaration of war on the peace process.'' David 
Bar-Illan told The Associated Press that Netanyahu ``views such statements 
with the utmost severity,'' and would bring them up when his Cabinet 
meets later this week before Israel begins withdrawing troops from 
the West Bank. In the West Bank, clashes broke out when soldiers moved 
on a group of Palestinians trying to prevent a bulldozer from beginning 
work to pave a road for Jewish settlers. Israel had confiscated 40 
acres (16 hectares) of Arab land in the West Bank village of al-Khader 
for the road. About 30 soldiers beat back 20 protesters, who responded 
with a hail of stones. Soldiers then shot rubber bullets and tear 
gas canisters into the crowd. Two Palestinians were treated for tear 
gas inhalation, including Palestinian lawmaker Salah Tamari. One Israeli 
soldier was injured from a chunk of rock. The sharpening rhetoric 
came as Ross tried to get both sides to implement the Wye River memorandum, 
which calls for a 13 percent Israeli withdrawal from the West Bank 
in exchange for stepped up Palestinian security measures. Ross met 
with Israeli officials Sunday and negotiators from both sides met 
later in the day. He urged moving the debate off the airwaves and 
to the negotiating table. ``One thing that is key: it is always better 
for the two sides to talk to each other instead of at each other,'' 
Ross told reporters after meeting with Israeli Foreign Minister Ariel 
Sharon. Sharon said Arafat's comments made it ``difficult to conduct 
negotiations'' and reiterated that Israel would ``annex'' the areas 
of the West Bank it holds if Arafat unilaterally declared a Palestinian 
state. Palestinian officials indicated Arafat's strong language came 
in response to Israeli annexation threats and as a result of the delay 
in implementing the withdrawal agreement. The first pullback had been 
slated for Monday, but Israel said it would be delayed for a matter 
of ``days.'' Speaking to members of his Fatah faction in the West 
Bank town of Ramallah, Arafat said: ``Our rifle is ready, and we are 
ready to use it if they try to delay us from praying at al-Aqsa,'' 
the holiest mosque in Jerusalem. Defying Israeli and the U.S. wishes, 
Arafat said, ``We will declare our state on the 4th of May next year. 
This is our right... .'' Netanyahu told reporters that Arafat's threats 
were undermining the agreement. ``This endangers the entire Oslo agreement 
and casts a very dark shadow over the Wye agreement, as well,'' he 
said. Speaking in a radio address broadcast Sunday, Arafat sought 
to allay Israeli fears of an independent Palestinian state, saying 
it will be the ``bridge of love and peace.'' In a 30-minute broadcast 
on the official Voice of Palestine, Arafat coupled his appeal with 
a warning to Islamic militants and their supporters in the Arab world 
that he would not tolerate interference. ``We are not going to allow 
anyone to attack our dream and to destroy our Palestinian national 
project,'' he said, adding that anti-Israel attacks now would provide 
Israel with an excuse to back out of the agreement to hand over land. 
Following attacks attributed to Islamic militants on an Israeli school 
bus and a Jerusalem market, Netanyahu delayed the time table for implementing 
the land-for-security accord. Sunday, Bar-Illan said Netanyahu told 
Arafat in a telephone call there would be a further delay because 
of those events and pending approval of the accord in the Israeli 
Knesset, expected Tuesday.
