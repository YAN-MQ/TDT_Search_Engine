Fiji's Vijay Singh tied the course record with a 10-under-par 62 Sunday 
for a two-stroke victory over last year's champion, Jesper Parnevik 
of Sweden, in a golf tournament played in four different countries. 
Singh finished the Johnnie Walker Super Tour at 19-under 269 after 
earlier rounds of 70 at the Palm Resort and Country Club in Malaysia, 
66 at the Thai Country Club in Bangkok and 71 at the Ta Shee course 
in Taipei, Taiwan. His 62 on the 6,970-yard course at the Mission 
Hills Golf Club in Shenzhen, southern China, tied the course record 
set by Japan's Hisayui Sasaki at the 1995 World Cup of Golf. He collected 
dlrs 100,000 from a purse of dlrs 350,000. Parnevik, who led Singh 
by two strokes after the third round, shot a 6-under 66 in Shenzhen 
and finished at 271, good for dlrs 60,000. ``I started really well 
and I am delighted to win this tournament,'' said Singh, who won the 
PGA Championship earlier this season and the Sprint International 
a week later. South African Ernie Els shot a 69 and finished third 
at 278, one stroke ahead of Brian Watts. The American also shot a 
69 Sunday. Felix Casas of the Philippines had a 71, finishing fifth 
at 282. Thailand's Prayad Marksaeng was sixth at 285 after slipping 
to a 74 Sunday. Taiwan's Michael Chang shot a 75 for 286, and Malaysia's 
Marimuthu Ramayah had a 76 for 291. Britain's Laura Davies, the only 
woman in the tournament, had a disastrous 78 for a four-round 308.
