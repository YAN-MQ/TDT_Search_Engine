In the 22 years since the nation resumed executions, the anti-death 
penalty movement has been battered, bloodied and ignored. Public opinion 
polls show strong support for capital punishment. Democratic and Republican 
candidates from the city council to the White House argue about who 
supports it more, and the march to the death chamber continues to 
pick up speed. But on the edge of Lake Michigan during the weekend, 
death penalty opponents mounted a public relations counterattack, 
bringing together for the first time 28 of the 73 men and two women 
released from death rows across the country since 1972, usually after 
many years, for crimes they did not commit. It was a chilling flesh 
and blood reminder of the greatest fear of opponents and supporters 
of the death penalty _ the execution of the innocent. One by one, 
the black artist and the white yoga teacher and the Hispanic man who 
wants to be a lawyer marched across a stage at the Northwestern University 
School of Law here on Saturday and introduced themselves as death 
row survivors. Then they sat together in what one of them called ``a 
living graveyard'' and one of their lawyers, fighting back tears, 
called ``a stage of honor.'' ``My name is Dennis Williams,'' the artist 
said. ``Had the state of Illinois gotten its way, I'd be dead today.'' 
For about every seven executions in the United States since 1976, 
one condemned inmate has been freed, like Williams, who served 17 
years on Illinois' death row; and like Walter McMillian, who served 
six years in Alabama, and like Sonia Jacobs, who served five years 
in Florida. Each was convicted of murder and sentenced to death. And 
each was eventually freed, largely based on the grounds of outright 
evidence of innocence or other overwhelming doubts. Because they are 
free today and not dead, supporters of the death penalty say that 
they are living proof that the system works. The men and women released 
from death row say that they bear living witness that the system can 
make dozens of deadly mistakes. ``Had the state gotten its way, I'd 
be dead today,'' floated through the hall 28 times. The march of survivors 
was the emotional highlight of a three-day national conference on 
Wrongful Convictions and the Death Penalty held at Northwestern and 
attended by more than 1,000 lawyers, law students, professors and 
death penalty opponents. ``We want to start a dialogue with the rest 
of the country,'' said Lawrence Marshall, the Northwestern University 
law professor who organized the conference and helped get two of the 
men on the stage off death row. ``We want to bring the faces of these 
wrongfully convicted men and women who could be dead right now into 
every village and hamlet in the country.'' The conference was part 
reunion, part strategy session and part pep rally to energize a movement 
that silenced the nation's death chambers for years in the late 1960s 
and much of the 1970s. ``The death penalty has been abolished once 
before in this country,'' said Robert Meeropol, executive director 
of the Rosenberg Fund for Children, which is named after his parents, 
Ethel and Julius Rosenberg, executed in the 1950s on charges of spying. 
``The next time, we have to make sure that it stays abolished for 
good.'' But there were also panel discussions about flawed forensics, 
investigative techniques and DNA evidence. Barry Scheck, a professor 
at the Benjamin N. Cardozo School of Law in New York and co-director 
of the Innocence Project, which has used DNA evidence to help free 
more than two dozen wrongfully convicted people, said that after the 
conference he expected to see similar projects in every state. ``If 
we can get more people on the ground looking for evidence,'' Scheck 
said, ``we can free a lot of innocent people.'' Another panel focused 
on the effects of incarceration. ``Being wrongfully convicted and 
incarcerated is a huge trauma,'' said John Wilson, a psychologist. 
and a pioneer in the treatment of post traumatic shock in war veterans. 
``Such experiences rip these people forever. How do you give someone 
back what they've lost after 5, 10, 15 years of wrongful imprisonment?'' 
That is what Walter McMillian would like to know. After six years 
on death row, he lost his logging business and his marriage. Sonia 
Jacobs went to prison as a wife and a mother. When she got out, she 
was a widow and a grandmother. Ms. Jacobs served five years on death 
row in Florida after being convicted of killing two policemen and 
12 more years in the general prison population before her conviction 
was overturned in 1992. Some people at the conference talked about 
changing the death penalty to ensure that innocent people are not 
condemned to die. But the overwhelming thrust of the weekend was the 
ultimate abolition of the death penalty, and the wrongfully condemned 
people _ the ``75 reasons to care.'' Joseph Burrows, 45, is one of 
the reasons, but do not tell him that he is alive today because the 
system worked. He said the reality is that the system almost killed 
him. The reality is, the nightmares still come to get him like executioners 
in the middle of the night. The reality is, he has trouble holding 
a job and his three teen-age children refuse to listen to him. Why 
should they? he asks himself. He was not around when they were growing 
up and needed him most. He was on death row in Illinois, awaiting 
execution for a crime he did not commit. He says he will never be 
the same, that a big piece of Joe Burrows, a house painter from small 
town Illinois, will always be a dead man walking and ``that ain't 
right.'' Three times while he was on the row, the state set a date 
to kill him. In his head, he knew he had plenty of appeals left and 
sooner or later someone would just have to wake up and let him go 
home. In his soul, each death date ate him up a little bit more. ``After 
a while,'' he said, ``it affects you so bad that you're not the same 
person no more.'' Carl Lawson, 33, a self-professed former ``hustler'' 
from East St. Louis, Ill., and Burrows were on the row together, with 
Rolando Cruz from the Chicago suburbs. The three men, one white, one 
black and one Hispanic, used to talk about their innocence and that 
magical land called ``freedom,'' a place that Lawson said he had despaired 
of ever seeing again. ``A lot of the time, I thought I was going to 
be executed,'' he said. ``I thought about hanging myself. I thought 
about escaping. But a lot of the time, I just wanted to get in a corner 
and get to screaming and hollering.'' On Saturday, all three men sat 
on ``the stage of honor,'' alive and free, death row far, far away 
_ and right around the corner.
