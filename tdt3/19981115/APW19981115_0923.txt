Saying ``our rifle is ready,'' Palestinian leader Yasser Arafat hinted 
darkly at armed conflict Sunday, prompting a sharp rebuke from Israel. 
The escalation of rhetoric came as U.S. envoy Dennis Ross sought to 
jump start that latest Mideast peace accord. A senior adviser to Israeli 
Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu said Arafat's comments were a ``declaration 
of war on the peace process.'' David Bar-Illan told The Associated 
Press that Netanyahu ``views such statements with the utmost severity,'' 
and would bring them up when his Cabinet meets later this week before 
Israel begins withdrawing troops from the West Bank. An Israeli official, 
speaking on condition of anonymity, said that Israel has asked the 
United States, which mediated the recent peace agreement, to condemn 
Arafat's comments as well. And in comments certain to heighten tensions, 
Foreign Minister Ariel Sharon called on Jewish settlers Sunday to 
grab West Bank hilltops now before the two sides reach a permanent 
territorial agreement over the area where the Palestinians want to 
build their future state. ``Everyone there should move, should run, 
should grab more hills, expand the territory. Everything that's grabbed, 
will be in our hands, everything that we don't grab, will be in their 
hands. That's how it will be,'' Sharon said at a meeting with members 
of the right-wing Tsomet party, a coalition partner in Netanyahu's 
government. His comments were broadcast on Israel radio. The United 
States has called on Israel to refrain from building in settlements 
or changing the current status of the West Bank in any way and the 
latest peace accord signed at the White House last month says both 
Israel and the Palestinians will not carrying out any unilateral actions. 
Bar-Illan said Sharon's comments did not conflict with the wording 
or spirit of the latest peace accord because Sharon was referring 
to hilltops which neighbor Jewish settlements and which Israel already 
considers to be part of existing settlements. Settlers have begun 
placing trailer homes on several hilltops adjacent to their settlements 
in order to stake a claim over areas still up for discussion. But 
Sharon's comments Sunday were the first indication that the settler 
actions have government approval. In the, 5th graf pvs
