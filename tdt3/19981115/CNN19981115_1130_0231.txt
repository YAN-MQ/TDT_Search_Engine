Iraqi newspapers are claiming victory over the standoff with U.N. 
weapons inspectors. One official says with the Iraq's latest diplomatic 
move, the United States no longer has grounds to launch an attack. 
Jane arraf has more on the mood in Baghdad. In the working-class neighborhood 
of new Baghdad, a long night was just beginning as Washington decided 
whether Iraq has done enough to avoid an attack. Jabar haider feeds 
the working poor with five-cent eggplant sandwiches. If there were 
an agreement and sanctions were eased, he says, perhaps more of his 
patrons could afford them. But haider, who lives with his 12 children 
in a two-room house, wasn't counting on it. Neither was daud sulaiman 
zaydan, 19 years old and a soldier. "We're strong," he said. "We've 
gotten used to sanctions over the past eight years." Although an attack 
may have been temporarily averted, most people realized their problems 
weren't over. "We've understood that with the experiences over the 
last seven years, the United States isn't going to leave us alone," 
said student Hussein Ali. Many say Washington wants to keep them week. 
In another time, Ali might have been among Iraq's outward-looking 
elite. Now he wears second-hand clothes he blames on the sanctions 
and rails against America, asking, "why don't they find another country 
to plunder?" At the bus station, where night workers and soldiers 
drink tea and wait to go on duty, a city brought to the brink of attack 
went on with business as usual. Jane arraf, CNN, Baghdad.
