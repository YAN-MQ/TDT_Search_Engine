c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service The New York Times said in an editorial 
on Monday, Nov. 16: When Congress debates taxes and spending decisions, 
it is the Congressional Budget Office that sets the terms of the debate, 
with its estimates of just how much each provision will cost or bring 
in to the Treasury. That office has developed a reputation for impartial 
professionalism that must be preserved. With June O'Neill, the director 
of the office, stepping down at the end of the year, the appointment 
of her successor will provide an early indication of whether the new 
Republican leadership in the House will continue on the same disastrous 
course begun by Speaker Newt Gingrich and his colleagues last summer. 
Frustrated by Ms. O'Neill's refusal to bend the numbers to make huge 
tax cuts appear to cost little in the way of revenues, the speaker 
and the rest of the outgoing House Republican leadership sent a letter 
threatening to ``review the structure and funding'' of the office 
if it did not start making more congenial assessments. Now, some Republicans 
are arguing that the new director should be a Republican partisan 
who will run the office in a blatantly political way. It is up to 
the chairmen of the Budget Committees, Rep. John Kasich and Sen. Pete 
Domenici, to assure that does not happen. The incoming speaker, Robert 
Livingston, should make it clear that he wants professionalism, not 
rigged numbers.
