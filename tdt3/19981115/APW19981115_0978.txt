UNITED NATIONS (AP) _ U.N. weapons inspectors and other U.N. personnel 
will return to Iraq in the next two days after Iraq agreed to resume 
cooperation with the inspectors unconditionally, U.N. officials said 
Sunday. At the end of a Security Council meeting, chief U.N. weapons 
inspector Richard Butler said he was ordering the return of the inspectors 
on Tuesday. Earlier, Benon V. Sevan, the head of the humanitarian 
program in Iraq, said all 151 U.N. international staff would return 
to Iraq by Monday evening.
