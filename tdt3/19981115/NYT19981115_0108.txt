When America Online bought the small Israeli start-up company Mirabilis 
in June for $287 million, people in the industry scratched their heads 
and wondered what the buyer was getting. Mirabilis makes a software 
program called ICQ for chat and instant messaging that has been distributed 
free to Internet users, who give it a cultish dedication that one 
executive likened to fans' devotion to the Grateful Dead. Analysts 
wondered how America Online would recoup its investment in Mirabilis, 
which had yet to make a profit from its grass-roots chatters, without 
offending them. Many ICQ members wrote notes of protest on the company's 
Web site (www.icq.com) after the sale, expressing fears of commercialization. 
Since the sale, America Online has publicly kept its distance from 
ICQ, although it is managing the business closely and has installed 
a senior America Online executive, Fred Singer, as chief operating 
officer of the Mirabilis unit, now called ICQ. With ICQ's latest version 
a few weeks away from public release, there are now some clues to 
a possible strategy. The new software contains all the features of 
a Web gateway, or portal, built right into its control panel, and 
to accommodate the large international audience of the product, translates 
information it finds into any language. A variety of search engines, 
like Alta Vista and Excite, as well as news, financial and weather 
sites and a dictionary are among the features provided _ though, at 
least initially, they are not paying to be included. This means that 
an ICQ user need not open a separate Web-browser program to find some 
information. ``This is a communication tool with a sophisticated search 
integrated into it,'' said Anya Sacharow of Jupiter communications. 
``It's redefining search and navigation.'' Through ICQ, America Online 
appears to be seeking to go beyond the so-called portals in keeping 
Web users within its own confines _ all the better to present advertisers 
with a semicaptive audience. But there may be limits to America Online's 
ability to promote ICQ directly. ``AOL can't really put its brand 
near ICQ, because ICQ users will become totally alienated by that,'' 
Ms. Sacharow said. Singer said the ICQ user base had grown by 60 percent 
since the acquisition, to 21 million users. That compares with America 
Online's subscriber base of 13 million users. Is the new strategy 
the first step toward introducing advertising into the ICQ community? 
Singer's answer to that question was cryptic. ``Because the community 
is so large and powerful, and usage is so high, what we're trying 
to do is make it better, build an audience,'' he said. ``The good 
news is if you have a community like this one, and we can continue 
to provide for them and make them happy, the other issues will solve 
themselves.''
