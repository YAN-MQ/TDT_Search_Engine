love you, too. A e Klein eyewear by Luxottica. I want you to see fearlessness. 
The unexpected. I want you to see... you don't need words to make 
a statement. Let them see you in A e Klein eyewear... by Luxottica. 
La, La, La, La unlike ordinary pickles, claussen just won't bend... 
La, La, La when it comes to taste. - We make 'em cold and keep 'em 
cold. - so enjoy the cold snap of claussen.
