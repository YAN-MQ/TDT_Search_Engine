A new edition of "the boy scout handbook" comes out tomorrow. 1 million 
Scouts will get a lesson in subjects that are a lot more complicated 
than fishing or tying a slipknot. ABC's Jami Floyd explains. Boy Scouts 
still learn how to set up tents and build fires. But the new "boy 
scout handbook" is changing with the times. What we have decided to 
do is to look at the book from the point of view of, "how is it going 
to work for kids in the 21st century?" a lot has changed since 1910, 
when the boy Scouts of America was founded and the first handbook 
was published. It's updated every ten years. We have a section in 
the new handbook called "prepared for life," and it deals with the 
things that young boys run into every day. Expanded sections on smoking 
and sex and an all-new section on the Internet. There are several 
pages in the book that deal with indicators for the scout who may 
be communicating in a chat room to look for that may be from a Potential 
predator. Scouting has always been about knowing right from wrong. 
Some of the topics in the new handbook are distinctly modern. But 
the values taught to this generation of boy Scouts are the same values 
taught to their fathers. It's in the family. My father was, my uncle 
was, my grandfather was. So it's like a rotation. Even as the world 
around them changes at breakneck speed, the pledge and the values 
of the boy Scouts do not. The 12 words of the scout law -- trustworthy, 
loyal, helpful, friendly, courteous, kind, obedient, cheerful, thrifty, 
brave, clean and reverent -- those 12 simple words don't change. But 
the packaging for the words has changed. It's slick, color-coded and 
linked to the Internet. Jami Floyd, ABC News, New York.
