President Clinton on Sunday all but called for a coup against Saddam 
Hussein, vowing to work with Iraqi opposition groups until ``a new 
government'' took power in Iraq. President Bush did much the same 
at the end of the 1991 Gulf War, calling on the Iraqi people to rise 
up and ``force Saddam Hussein the dictator to step aside.'' Thousands 
of Iraqis died trying to heed that call. And in the seven years since 
the Gulf War, thousands more have faced prison and death. The CIA 
has come up with at least six different plans to undermine the Iraqi 
leader. Coups against dictators are ``harder to do than to talk about,'' 
in the words of Gen. John Shalikashvili, the former chairman of the 
Joint Chiefs. In the case of Iraq, it may be much harder. Senators 
and representatives have been talking openly all year about the need 
to topple Saddam. The CIA's overseers in Congress have debated how 
best to carry out a coup. Two weeks ago, the president signed an unusual 
$97 million bill that proposes to unify the deeply divided Iraqi opposition. 
The CIA has spent nearly that much money since the Gulf War backing 
four different groups trying to subvert Saddam: Kurdish dissidents 
in northern Iraq, Iraqi military defectors in Jordan, Shiite Muslim 
groups in southern Iraq and a coalition of exiles based in London. 
None proved effective. They were plagued by internal divisions and, 
in some cases, infiltration by Iraqi intelligence agents. Their weakness 
was exposed in September 1996 when Saddam crushed a cell of dissidents 
run by the CIA inside Iraq. The operation was destroyed because a 
Kurdish opposition leader, Massoud Barzani, betrayed it as part of 
a power struggle with a rival. This past September, the State Department 
brokered a settlement between the two factions, both of whom had been 
backed by the CIA. This year, at the request of the White House, the 
agency has twice drafted plans for covert action against the Iraqi 
government, only to see them blocked by skeptics in the administration 
and Congress. The more ambitious of these plans, drafted in February, 
would have mounted a major campaign of sabotage inside Iraq, enlisting 
Kurdish and Shiite agents to blow up government broadcast stations 
and utility plants. The plan was leaked to The New York Times by a 
senior government official who opposed it, effectively removing the 
element of surprise. The plot was not finally approved by Clinton. 
This fall, Congress passed the $97 million Iraq Liberation Act, which 
Clinton signed on Oct. 31. It authorizes the president, but does not 
require him, to give guns, money and political support to the fragmented 
Iraqi opposition. Gen. Anthony Zinni of the Marines, the American 
commander in the Gulf, opposed the act. ``I think a weakened, fragmented, 
chaotic Iraq, which could happen if this isn't done carefully, is 
more dangerous in the long run than a contained Saddam is now,'' he 
said. ``I don't think these things have been thought out.'' Iraq's 
deputy foreign minister, Tariq Aziz, Sunday condemned Clinton's statement, 
calling it ``a flagrant violation of the Security Council resolutions 
as well as international law.'' But Clinton said he would carry out 
the Iraq Liberation Act as best he could. ``Over the past year we 
have deepened our engagement with the forces of change in Iraq, reconciling 
the two largest Kurdish opposition groups, beginning broadcasts of 
a Radio Free Iraq,'' he said. ``We will intensify that effort.'' And 
then, correcting himself in mid-sentence and tacitly acknowledging 
how difficult the job would be, the president said Washington would 
work ``to make sure the opposition _ or to do what we can to make 
the opposition a more effective voice.''
