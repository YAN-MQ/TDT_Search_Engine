Russia's Mir space station will stay in orbit until the end of 1999 
or the start of 2000, and possibly longer, an official said Sunday. 
Earlier government estimates said the aging Mir, which has been in 
orbit for more than ten years, would be decommissioned in the middle 
of next year. Russian space officials insist it could stay up for 
another two years. Presidential aide Yevgeny Shaposhnikov said Mir's 
life expectancy depends on scheduling for the launch of a Russian 
service module for an international space station project, set for 
mid-summer, 1999. Mir would stay in orbit for a few months after. 
The United States and other countries want Russia to dedicate all 
its resources to the International Space Station, which has been delayed 
by funding shortages on the Russian side. NASA is paying the Russian 
Space Agency up to $60 million to make sure it completes a service 
module, scheduled for launch in the middle of next year, on time. 
Astronauts and cosmonauts cannot live on the space station until the 
service module and its life-support systems are in orbit. It costs 
Russia about 225 million rubles (dlrs 13.6 million) each year to keep 
the Mir in orbit. But Russia's sentimental attachment to the Mir has 
made it tough to let go of the accident-prone station. Meanwhile, 
Sunday was the 10th anniversary of the launch of the Buran spaceship, 
one of the last efforts in the space race between the Soviet Union 
and the United States. Russia sunk millions of rubles (millions of 
dollars) in the Buran ships, modeled after U.S. space shuttles. An 
unmanned Buran circled the earth twice in a test flight in 1988, but 
the project was scrapped without any further launches because of lack 
of funds.
