Fourteen hostages have been freed from captivity in Chechnya in the 
last week, a news report said Sunday. Among the 14 captives freed 
were Russia's presidential envoy to Chechnya, Russian soldiers, and 
a teenage girl, the Interfax news agency said, citing Chechnya's Deputy 
Minister for State Security Nasrudi Bazhiyev. Police detained 20 people 
in the same period and also seized a large amount of guns and ammunition, 
Bazhiyev said. He said the government's campaign against kidnapping, 
dubbed Operation Sword of Justice, will continue ``until a radical 
turn in the campaign to combat kidnapping is ensured,'' Interfax reported. 
Chechnya, a breakaway region in Russia's southwest, fought a bloody 
independence war in 1994-96. Since then, the area has seen an explosion 
in crime and kidnappings. Government officials say that over 700 people, 
including Russian soldiers, local civilians, and a number of foreigners, 
are still being held in the region.
