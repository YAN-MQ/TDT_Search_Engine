Who's number one? We will know soon. According to the new coaches 
poll it's Kansas state. They now sit alone on top, fol log the wild 
40-30 win over Nebraska. Their first victory against the huskers since 
1968. The coaches have Tennessee at two. They pulled off a dramatic 
win against Arkansas. The Vols stay undefeated. UCLA is third, extending 
the nation's longest winning streak to 19. The associated press ranking 
should be released later today.
