With his latest act of brinkmanship, some analysts and officials say 
President Saddam Hussein of Iraq is closer to what he wants most: 
keeping a secret cache of biological and chemical weapons while gaining 
support for an end to the economic sanctions crippling his country. 
Saddam's tactics, which American officials label ``cheat and retreat,'' 
have long frustrated many in the White House and State Department, 
and widened divisions within the U.N. Security Council over how to 
handle Iraq. Many American officials predict that he will once again 
rebuff U.N. weapons inspectors in a few months, again risking an attack, 
to protect his secret weapons. Why does he do it? His goals are simple 
_ far simpler than those facing U.S. officials trying to thwart his 
ambitions. ``Saddam Hussein has vast megalomaniacal ambitions of being 
the leader of the Arab world and the hegemon of the gulf, and he sees 
that his political survival depends on his keeping these weapons,'' 
said Jonathan Tucker, a leading expert on biological and chemical 
weapons. ``His political survival is his primary objective,'' Tucker 
said, ``which is why he has accepted such a price to retain them.'' 
The threat that he might someday unleash biological and chemical weaponry 
makes him a world figure. Without them, he is just another tyrant 
presiding over a starveling Third World country. ``Without weapons 
of mass destruction, Saddam is not Saddam,'' said Judith Kipper of 
the Council on Foreign Relations. ``With them he's a regional and 
an international factor.'' His secret weapons are his ace in the hole 
as he fights to keep his status as a leader in the Arab world and 
to preserve his ability to fight and deter his enemies, who include 
the Iranians, the Saudis, the Israelis and the Americans, say American 
officials and international analysts. To maintain his chemical and 
biological weapons _ and the ability to build more _ Saddam has sacrificed 
more than $120 billion in oil revenues and endured a harsh seven-year 
economic embargo. He has devoted his intelligence service to an endless 
game of cat and mouse to hide his suspected weapons caches from U.N. 
inspections. Twice in the last year, when it appeared that the inspectors 
were getting close to the heart of his biological and chemical weapons 
secrets, he cut off cooperation with them, setting off another round 
of threats and defiance and risking a devastating attack by the United 
States. Now, by agreeing to readmit the U.N. weapons inspectors, Saddam 
took a step that members of the Security Council have said is required 
before they can consider lifting economic sanctions imposed after 
Iraq invaded Kuwait in 1990. Allowing the inspectors back in is a 
gamble the Iraqi leader may well feel is worth taking. He and his 
intelligence services have managed to keep Iraq's biological weapons 
programs largely hidden from them despite nearly seven years of intense, 
intrusive inspections. It has been 101 days since the last full-fledged 
inspection. The U.N. Special Commission, known as UNSCOM, which conducts 
the inspections, may well have lost track of developments at 120 suspected 
chemical weapons sites and 90 sites suspected of biological weapons 
activities. The previous seven years of inspections have destroyed 
some 38,500 chemical weapons and a secret biological weapons site, 
far beyond what seven weeks of bombing did in the Persian Gulf war 
of 1991. But much about the Iraqi biological programs is unknown, 
and they remain ``a black hole,'' in the words of Richard Butler, 
chief of the special commission. Tucker said the inspections had reduced 
Iraq ``to a core of military resources that Saddam Hussein will never 
give up,'' and biological weapons are the heart of that arsenal. ``We 
know they have produced tons of anthrax and botulism,'' Tucker said. 
``It's possible they retain a significant stockpile of these agents. 
The Iraqis seem to retain some kind of missile capability, and they 
were determined to retain some kind of VX capability.'' VX is a deadly 
nerve agent. The Iraqi leader, say government officials and private 
analysts, doubts that the United States and its allies have the will 
to remove him from power by any means necessary, as they lacked the 
will at the close of the Gulf war in 1991. ``He survives and thrives 
by acting and provoking,'' said Chibli Mallat, a Beirut lawyer and 
political analyst of Iraq. ``If Saddam agrees to have UNSCOM back 
and review his compliance, he'll be in a stronger position _ having 
held back the wave'' of the threatened American attack. He emerged 
from the latest crisis Sunday in control of his secret weapons sites, 
his soldiers, his spies, his palaces and his secret police _ the pillars 
of his power, which were in the cross hairs of the cruise missiles 
almost launched by the United States. He may now be confident that 
he can weather any political storm, protect his secret weapons and 
his personal power and emerge unscathed, just as he did during and 
after the Gulf war.
