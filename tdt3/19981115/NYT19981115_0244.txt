Mary Main, a novelist who also wrote a highly regarded biography of 
Eva Peron, died on Nov. 8 at her home in Ridgefield, Conn. She was 
95. Ms. Main was born to British parents in Buenos Aires, where her 
father was general manager of the Buenos Aires Western Railway. She 
grew up in privileged Anglo-Argentine society, attending finishing 
school in England before returning to her home, where she married 
James Main, a British engineer, in 1927. In 1941, the couple moved 
to the United States and Ms. Main began writing short stories for 
The Saturday Evening Post, Collier's and other magazines. She published 
two novels in the late 1940's, and in 1950 Doubleday asked her to 
write a biography of Eva Peron, who with her husband, Juan, was at 
the peak of power in Argentina. Fearing trouble from the Peronistas, 
Ms. Main researched the book clandestinely in Argentina and published 
it under the pseudonym Maria Flores. ``Evita: The Woman With the Whip'' 
appeared in 1952, shortly after Eva Peron's death. After Juan Peron 
was thrown out of power, subsequent editions appeared under Ms. Main's 
real name. The success of the Andrew Lloyd Webber musical ``Evita'' 
in the 1970s and the appearance of the movie version in 1996 revived 
interest in Ms. Main's book, and it was republished several times 
in the United States and Britain. ``I felt compassion, not sympathy,'' 
Ms. Main said in a 1980 interview in The New York Times. ``Eva did 
evil things, but she wasn't really evil. She lived a life of fantasy. 
She was her own creation.'' As Maria Flores, Ms. Main wrote two other 
books based on events in Latin American dictatorships: the novel ``The 
Call From Calle Moreno,'' about a doctor called in to treat a victim 
of Juan Peron's police, and ``The Benefactor,'' a story inspired by 
the disappearance of the Columbia University professor Jesus de Galindez, 
who was widely assumed to have been kidnapped by agents of Rafael 
Trujillo, the Dominican dictator. Ms. Main's eyesight began to fail 
slowly in the 1940's, but it was many years before she could accept 
that she was going blind. She was totally blind by the early 1960's, 
but she continued to write, dictating her works on tape and editing 
by going back and forth from one tape to another. But she published 
only one more book, ``The Girl Who Was Never Queen,'' a historical 
novel, in 1962. In 1973, she moved to Connecticut to live with her 
son, Jeremy. She joined the National Federation of the Blind, founding 
its Stamford-area chapter and serving as its president. In addition 
to her son, she is survived by three grandchildren, two stepgrandchildren 
and seven great-grandchildren.
