From showdown to stand-down. Military moves against Saddam Hussein 
are now on hold. Iraq has backed down, but that is not enough. Now 
Iraq must live up to its obligations. Until we see complete compliance, 
we will remain vigilant. We will keep up the pressure. We will be 
ready to act. The test of Iraqi cooperation will come quickly. U.N. 
weapons inspectors plan to be back in Baghdad within 48 hours. This 
is not a question of faith. This is a question of action. broadcasting
