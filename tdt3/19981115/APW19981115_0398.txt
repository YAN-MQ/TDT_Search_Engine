The government said Sunday that former President Suharto has total 
bank deposits of 21 billion rupiah (dlrs 2.6 million) _ but not the 
trillions (billions of dollars) reported by the media. State Secretary 
Akbar Tanjung said the Attorney General's Office had already inquired 
at some 70 banks in the country in investigations of the autocratic 
former leader's wealth. Many Indonesians believe that during his 32-year 
rule, Suharto and his children amassed riches through government contracts 
and siphoned off wealth from projects and state-owned corporations 
including oil company Pertamina. The U.S. magazine Forbes estimates 
the former president's wealth at dlrs 4 billion. Suharto, 77, quit 
in May amid riots and protests fueled by Indonesia's worst economic 
crisis in three decades. He has denied corruption or stashing cash 
overseas, but his denials have been greeted with disbelief by many 
Indonesians. ``Attorney General (Andi M. Ghalib) has received an official 
report on the accounts of former President Suharto that the amount 
of ex-President Suharto's accounts is 21 billion rupiahs, and not 
trillions as reported by the media,'' Tanjung said after accompanying 
President B.J. Habibie in a meeting with the National Commission on 
Human Rights. During the meeting at Habibie's residence, the commission 
asked the government to expedite investigations of Suharto's wealth 
as required by a new decree issued by a special convention of the 
People's Consultative Assembly, Indonesia's highest legislative body. 
The 1,000-member assembly, made up mostly of holdovers from the Suharto 
era, passed a decree Friday on clean government that also named Suharto 
and his family as targets of a wealth investigation. Demands for an 
immediate trial of Suharto and rejection of the assembly's decision 
to reserve special seats for the military in parliament have led to 
student protests this week that claimed at least 16 lives in the capital.
