Industrial espionage has become so pervasive in Brazil that even President 
Fernando Henrique Cardoso and his top ministers are vulnerable, the 
nation's chief security officer said Sunday. ``We are well aware that 
knowledge of commercial affairs of state is big business,'' Gen. Alberto 
Cardoso told reporters. ``That's why the spy market is sophisticated 
and expanding.'' Gen. Cardoso, no relation to the president, was referring 
to recorded conversations made public Sunday between the president, 
Communications Minister Luiz Mendonca de Barros and Andre Lara Resende, 
the president of the state development bank. Taped in July on the 
eve of the dlrs 19 billion auction of the state-run telephone company, 
the recordings apparently show Mendonca de Barros and Resende, the 
two officials who headed up the sale, favoring a consortium of personal 
friends in its bid to purchase a conventional telephone line company. 
It is unclear where the tapes came from or who made them. These revelations 
came as Finance Minister Pedro Malan was on an official visit to the 
United States and Europe in an effort to get credit lines from foreign 
banks. And President Cardoso recently introduced an austerity program 
to reduce the nation's budget deficit. Some analysts fear the tapes 
and other recent allegations that President Cardoso and three political 
allies hid millions in an overseas bank account will divert attention 
from the government's attempt to revive South America's largest economy, 
said Alexandre Barros, a Brasilia-based business consultant. This 
is the third time since Cardoso took office in 1995 that a wiretapping 
incident has embarrassed his administration. In 1995, a wiretap recorded 
a presidential aide, Julio Cesar Gomes dos Santos, apparently asking 
a representative of the U.S.-based Raytheon Co. whether he had paid 
the finance committee chairman of Brazil's Senate for approval of 
the company's dlrs 1.4 billion project to build an Amazon Basin radar 
system. And last year, two congressmen resigned after taped phone 
conversations revealed them discussing bribes to vote for a constitutional 
amendment allowing Cardoso's re-election. The federal police said 
in a 1994 reports that Brazil's 600 largest corporations lose dlrs 
7 billion annually to electronic eavesdropping, most likely conducted 
by former intelligence agents. In Rio de Janeiro, wiretappers brazenly 
offer their services in newspaper classified sections. Gen. Cardoso 
said his security agents have revamped the telephone system in the 
presidential palace and key ministries and make periodic sweeps for 
bugs in government offices. Despite those precautions, Gen. Cardoso 
is not optimistic that he can stop the bugs. ``It's practically impossible 
for any government to have a foolproof system against wiretapping,'' 
he said.
