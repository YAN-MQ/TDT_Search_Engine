The United States is taking a "wait and see" approach with Iraq. Baghdad 
officials have promised to allow U.N. inspectors access to suspected 
weapons sites with no strings attached. President Clinton is keeping 
the U.S. military on alert and warns Iraq, the United States will 
not tolerate any conditions on the inspectors. John king has the latest. 
The president is declaring victory in the latest showdown with iraq, 
but making it Crystal clear he isn't ready to trust Saddam Hussein. 
Iraq has backed down, but that is not enough. Now Iraq must live up 
to its obligations. The United States says the Iraqi president is 
promising complete cooperation with United Nations weapons inspections, 
no strings attached, including pledges to turn over long-withheld 
documents about his chemical and biological weapons programs. Iraq 
must accept once and for all that the only path forward is complete 
compliance with its obligations to the world. Until we see complete 
compliance, we will remain vigilant, we will keep up the pressure, 
we will be ready to act. That means the U.S. military buildup in the 
Persian gulf region will continue, as Saddam Hussein's latest promises 
are put to the test. We have a significant force in place which can 
be augmented within a very short time frame, and we've indicated by 
our actions that we can augment that very quickly. We continue to 
have forces flowing into the region. The chief U.N. weapons inspector 
says his teams can get back to work almost immediately. You've gotta 
assume that Iraq does its part of this, and then the council will 
put together the final decision package, and I can get my people going 
-- And, as I said, from word "go," they can be back on the job in 
Iraq within 24 hours. Administration critics are already asking why 
the White House didn't act more quickly to punish Iraq with military 
strikes. These critics see an all-too-familiar pattern, and predict 
it won't be long before Saddam Hussein provokes another confrontation. 
John king, "Headline News," the White House.
