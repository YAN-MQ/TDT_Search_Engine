Kwame Ture, the flamboyant civil rights leader known to most Americans 
as Stokely Carmichael, died Sunday in Conakry, Guinea. He was 57 and 
is best remembered for his use of the phrase ``black power,'' which 
in 1967 ignited a white backlash and alarmed an older generation of 
civil rights leaders, including the Rev. Dr. Martin Luther King Jr. 
The cause of death was prostate cancer, for which Ture had been treated 
at Columbia-Presbyterian Medical Center in New York in the last two 
years. He once said his cancer ``was given to me by forces of American 
imperialism and others who conspired with them.'' Ture, who changed 
his name in 1978 to honor Kwame Nkrumah and Ahmed Sekou Toure, two 
African socialist leaders who had befriended him, spent most of the 
last 30 years in Guinea, calling himself a revolutionary and advocating 
a Pan-African ideology that evoked little resonance in the United 
States, or, for that matter, Africa. Ture's advocacy of Pan-Africanism 
was the last phase in a political evolution that passed from indifference 
to the civil rights movement, when he was a high school student, to 
emergence as an effective nonviolent volunteer risking his life in 
the battle against segregation, to honorary prime minister of the 
Black Panther Party. Though his active participation in the struggle 
for civil rights lasted barely a decade, he was a charismatic figure 
in a turbulent time, when real violence and rhetoric escalated on 
both sides of the color line. Stokely Carmichael was inspired to participate 
in the civil rights movement by the bravery of those blacks and whites 
who protested segregated service with sit-ins at lunch counters in 
the South. ``When I first heard about the Negroes sitting in at lunch 
counters down South,'' he told Gordon Parks in Life magazine, ``I 
thought they were just a bunch of publicity hounds. But one night 
when I saw those young kids on TV, getting back up on the lunch-counter 
stools after being knocked off them, sugar in their eyes, ketchup 
in their hair _ well, something happened to me. Suddenly I was burning.'' 
Rejecting scholarships from several white universities, he entered 
Howard University in Washington in 1960. By the end of his freshman 
year, he had joined the Freedom Rides of the Congress of Racial Equality, 
hazardous bus trips of blacks and whites that challenged segregated 
interstate travel in the South. The Freedom Riders often met with 
violence, and at their destinations Carmichael and the others were 
arrested and jailed, the first incarcerations he experienced. One 
early arrest brought him a particularly harsh 49-day sentence in Parchman 
Penitentiary in Mississippi. Graduating with a bachelor's degree in 
philosophy from Howard in 1964, he joined the Student Nonviolent Coordinating 
Committee. It was the ``Freedom Summer,'' the year that SNCC (popularly 
pronounced ``snick'') was sending hundreds of black and white volunteers 
to the South to teach, set up clinics and register disenfranchised 
black Southerners. Tall, slim, handsome and a dynamic speaker, Carmichael 
soon emerged as a leader, cocky enough to be described as someone 
who could look as if he was strutting when he was standing still. 
Parks wrote that watching Carmichael made him believe that the young 
man could ``stroll through Dixie in broad daylight using the Confederate 
flag for a handkerchief.'' As a SNCC field organizer in Lowndes County 
in Alabama, where blacks were in the majority but were politically 
powerless, he helped raise the number of registered black voters to 
2,600 from a mere 70 _ 300 more than the number of whites registered 
to vote. Displeased by the response of the established parties to 
the success of the registration drive, he organized the all-black 
Lowndes County Freedom Organization, which, to fulfill a state requirement 
that all parties have a logo, took a black panther as its symbol. 
The panther was later adopted by the Black Panther Party. The young 
Carmichael was radicalized by his experiences working in the segregated 
South, where peaceful protesters were beaten, brutalized and sometimes 
killed for seeking the ordinary rights of citizens. He once recalled 
watching from his hotel room in a little Alabama town while nonviolent 
black demonstrators were beaten and shocked with cattle prods by the 
police. Horrified, he said that he screamed and could not stop. Carmichael 
was arrested so many times as a nonviolent volunteer that he lost 
count after 32. His growing impatience with the tactics of passive 
resistance was gaining support, and in 1966 he was chosen as chairman 
of the SNCC, replacing John Lewis, a hardworking integrationist who 
is now a congressman from Georgia. Barely a month after his selection, 
Carmichael, then just 25, raised the call for black power, thereby 
signaling a crossroads in the civil rights struggle. Increasingly 
uncomfortable with King's resolute nonviolence, he sensed a shift 
among some younger blacks in the direction of black separatism. Many 
were listening sympathetically to the urgings of Malcolm X, who had 
been assassinated a year and a half earlier, that the struggle should 
be carried out by any means necessary. It was June 16, 1966, and Carmichael, 
a spellbinding orator, was addressing a crowd of 3,000 in a park in 
Greenwood, Miss. James Meredith, who had integrated the University 
of Mississippi, had been wounded on his solitary ``Walk Against Fear'' 
from Memphis, Tenn., to Jackson, Miss., and civil rights volunteers 
were marching in his place. When they paused to set up camp in Greenwood, 
Carmichael was arrested and his frustration was obvious. ``This is 
the 27th time,'' he said with disgust. ``We been saying `Freedom' 
for six years,'' he continued, referring to the chant that movement 
protesters used as they stood up to racist politicians and hostile 
policemen pointing water hoses and unleashing snarling dogs. ``What 
we are going to start saying now is `Black Power!''' The crowd quickly 
took up the phrase. ``Black Power!'' it repeated in a cry that would 
soon be echoed in communities from Oakland, Calif., to Newark, N.J. 
But if Carmichael's call for ``black power'' galvanized many disenfranchised 
young blacks, it troubled others, who thought it sounded anti-white, 
provocative and violent. And it struck fear into many whites. Adverse 
reaction was powerful and immediate. After the integrationist, nonviolent 
speeches and sermons of King and others, few Americans, white or black, 
were prepared for the uncompromising demands of black militants who 
rallied to Carmichael's cry. Newspapers deplored the term and editorials 
warned of ``reverse racism.'' Contributions to civil rights groups 
from sympathetic whites fell. Voting results that November in many 
state and local elections reflected a white backlash. Many black leaders 
of the civil rights movement, though eager to avoid a split in the 
movement, were clearly upset by the use of the phrase and the separatism 
it seemed to connote. King called it ``an unfortunate choice of words.'' 
Roy Wilkins of the NAACP scorned it as an example of ``the raging 
of race against race.'' Perhaps the most indignant response came from 
Whitney Young Jr, the director of the National Urban League, who said: 
``Anyone can arouse the poor, the despairing, the helpless. That's 
no trick. Sure they'll shout `black power,' but why doesn't the mass 
media find out how many of those people will follow those leaders 
to a separate state or back to Africa?'' Young said mockingly that 
as he rode the train from his suburban home to his office in New York 
City, Carmichael's words had forced him to consider whether he should 
get off in Harlem. ``Should I get off this morning and go over to 
the bars and pool halls on Lenox Avenue and cuss out Whitey to show 
I'm tough? That will get me a lot of publicity. Or should I go downtown 
to the office and call up officials at Ford or General Motors and 
work on getting 10,000 jobs for unemployed Negroes?'' In the book 
``Black Power,'' which Carmichael wrote in 1967 with Charles Hamilton, 
now a professor of political science at Columbia University, the authors 
tried to explain the term. ``It is a call for black people in this 
country to unite,'' they wrote, ``to recognize their heritage, to 
build a sense of community. It is a call for black people to define 
their own goals, to lead their own organizations.'' But even as the 
book, which is still in print, appeared, Carmichael's speeches became 
more provocative. ``When you talk of black power, you talk of building 
a movement that will smash everything Western civilization has created,'' 
he told black audiences. And as civil unrest flared in Detroit and 
Newark, Carmichael's call became associated, as Hamilton put it, ``with 
riots and guns and `burn, baby, burn.''' Instead of young people singing 
``We Shall Overcome,'' new images of militant black men and women 
were being shown on television _ black berets, raised fists, men with 
guns. And along with goals of social justice and integration came 
ideas of black separatism and power harking back to the black nationalism 
that had been preached in the 1920s by Marcus Garvey. In 1966 and 
1967 Carmichael lectured at campuses around the United States and 
traveled to countries including North Vietnam, China and Cuba. He 
made perhaps his most provocative statement in Havana. ``We are preparing 
groups of urban guerrillas for our defense in the cities,'' he said. 
``It is going to be a fight to the death.'' In 1967, a declining SNCC 
severed all ties with him. Soon afterward he became honorary prime 
minister of the Black Panthers, the ultramilitant urban organization 
begun by Huey Newton and Bobby Seale. But he soon found himself embroiled 
with the other Panther leaders for opposing their decision to seek 
support among whites. He moved to Guinea, in West Africa, in 1969, 
saying, ``America does not belong to the blacks,'' and calling on 
all black Americans to follow his example. In July 1969, three months 
after he had moved to Africa, he made public a letter announcing his 
resignation from the Black Panther Party because of what he called 
``its dogmatic party line favoring alliances with white radicals.'' 
The letter signaled Carmichael's break from the main currents of American 
life. He lived in Conakry as the guest of Sekou Toure, the Marxist 
head of a one-party state, who had replaced French technical assistance 
with Russian aid. His next-door neighbor was Kwame Nkrumah, the Pan-Africanist 
first leader of independent Ghana, who after being deposed in a coup 
in 1966 was offered sanctuary in Guinea. In 1968 _ by now, calling 
himself Kwame Ture _ he married Miriam Makeba, the South African singer. 
They lived in a seaside villa where he sometimes greeted visitors 
wearing the green uniform of a Guinean soldier, a pistol at his side. 
After they divorced, he married Marlyatou Barry, a Guinean doctor 
who now lives in Arlington, Va., and from whom he was also divorced. 
He is survived by a son, Bokar, from his second marriage. He became 
a globe-trotting exponent of the All African Peoples Revolutionary 
Party, returning to American campuses to recruit. He maintained that 
continued progress for black Americans could be made only through 
``mass political organization on a Pan-African scale.'' ``Black power,'' 
he said, ``can only be realized when there exists a unified socialist 
Africa.'' He sounded the idea that blacks must work with blacks for 
their cultural, economic and political liberation. As early as 1971, 
he was already on the margins. Julius Lester, who had once helped 
Carmichael draft a radical speech in Havana, compared the speeches 
of Malcolm X with the speeches and essays that Carmichael collected 
in a book called ``Stokely Speaks.'' Lester wrote in The New York 
Times Book Review: ``Though dead, Malcolm is terrifyingly alive in 
his speeches; Carmichael is alive but his speeches are depressingly 
dead.'' Stokely Carmichael was born on June 29, 1941, in Port-of-Spain, 
Trinidad, and he spent his first 11 years there. His father, Adophus, 
was a carpenter who moonlighted as a taxi driver, and his mother, 
Mabel, was a stewardess for a steamship line. They had emigrated to 
the United States when he was a toddler, leaving him in the care of 
his grandmother. In 1952 he joined his parents in Harlem. By the time 
he was in the seventh grade, his family had moved to an old Jewish 
and Italian neighborhood in New York's East Bronx. He said in a 1967 
interview that he was the only black member of the Morris Park Dukes, 
a neighborhood gang, and described himself as ``a wild, aggressive 
boy, boozing it up and getting a kick out of petty theft.'' But after 
he passed the admissions test for the elite Bronx High School of Science, 
he broke with the Dukes. ``They were all reading the funnies while 
I was trying to dig Darwin and Marx,'' he told Gordon Parks. He was 
popular in high school, he said, and remembered dating white classmates 
and visiting luxury apartments. ``Now that I realize how phony they 
all were, how I hate myself for it,'' he said in the 1967 interview. 
``Being liberal was an intellectual game with these cats. They were 
still white, and I was black.'' Ture never publicly criticized Toure, 
who was known to jail and torture his opponents. The Guinean leader 
died in 1984, and two years later Ture's alignment with him led to 
his arrest by the military government that had taken over. He spent 
three days in jail accused of trying to overthrow the government. 
Ture continued to live in Guinea. To the end he answered his telephone 
with the greeting he had used for more than 20 years, ``Ready for 
the Revolution!''
