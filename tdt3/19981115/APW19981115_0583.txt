Gen. Augusto Pinochet may soon be moved from a London hospital to 
a more private place to await a final ruling on Spain's request that 
he be extradited to face genocide charges, a Chilean congresswoman 
said Sunday. ``I was informed that Scotland Yard is looking for a 
safe place, away from pressures by reporters and demonstrators,'' 
Maria Angelica Cristi said. Pinochet was arrested Oct. 16 at the request 
of Spanish judge Baltasar Garzon, who wants to try him for genocide 
during his 1973-90 dictatorship. Chilean newspapers reported Sunday 
that Pinochet, who will turn 83 on Nov. 25, will be moved closer to 
the Brize Norton air base near London. The Chilean air force has two 
planes stationed there ready to bring Pinochet back home should he 
be released. The reports said the transfer may occur as early as Monday. 
The High Court of London recognized Pinochet's immunity from prosecution, 
in his capacity as a former chief of state, but prosecutors appealed 
that ruling. A final decision by the House of Lords is expected this 
week. Cristi, who visited Pinochet twice last week, said he is improving 
slowly after undergoing back surgery on Oct. 9. ``He is walking somewhat 
better, but still using a cane or crutches,'' she said. Meanwhile, 
the Supreme Court was expected to announce Monday or Tuesday its decision 
on a government request that one of its justices take over 12 lawsuits 
against Pinochet that are being handled by a lower level judge. Media 
reports indicate the Court will turn down the request, leaving Judge 
Juan Guzman in charge of the suits filed by human rights organizations, 
relatives of victims of repression, the Communist Party and the National 
Organization of Journalists. The government request sought to prove 
that Pinochet would face justice at home if he is freed in Britain. 
At the same time, according to the government, its move emphasized 
that it is for Chile's courts, not Spain's, to try possible crimes 
that happened in Chile.
