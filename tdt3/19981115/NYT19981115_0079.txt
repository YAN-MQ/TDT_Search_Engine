For most weeks in the past year, the competition among the network 
evening newscasts has been a one-sided three-way race. With a few 
exceptions, NBC's ``Nightly News'' has been winning consistently enough 
for the network to brand itself on the air with impunity: ``America's 
News Leader.'' With ``Today'' dominant in the morning, ``Meet the 
Press'' the regular champion among the Sunday-morning talk shows, 
and ``Dateline NBC'' filling prime-time hours with solid ratings, 
that claim has had ample justification. But at least in terms of the 
evening newscasts, some doubt is beginning to creep in. While not 
a definitive trend, ABC's newscast, ``World News Tonight,'' has interrupted 
the weekly march to the top by the ``Nightly News.'' Over the last 
five weeks, ABC has been first in some category of measurement in 
the newscast competition. It does not exactly qualify as a winning 
streak because some weeks were unsettled by NBC's coverage of the 
baseball playoffs and because NBC still eked out a win in some categories, 
such as the 25-to-54-year-old age group. For the last reported week, 
from Nov. 2 to Nov. 6, for example, ABC had more overall viewers than 
NBC, with slightly more than 11 million to about 10.7 million for 
NBC. But NBC still had more viewers in that 25-to-54 group, 4.32 million 
to 4.23 million for ABC. Still, the movement does seem to be toward 
ABC and away from NBC. Compared to the same week last year, NBC was 
down 10 percent and ABC was up 2 percent. Has either broadcast undergone 
significant changes? Not really. But NBC is not dominating the other 
networks with its prime-time programs the way it has in recent years. 
Inside the NBC News department, the fall-off in prime time is being 
blamed for at least some declines. ``Of course we're looking at it,'' 
said one NBC executive, who insisted on anonymity. No other NBC show 
seems to have been affected by the network's slide in prime time. 
Both the ``Tonight'' show and the ``Today'' show continue to win their 
time periods. NBC's margin in the news competition has been much thinner; 
both CBS and ABC won an occasional week in the last year. That may 
have made the newscast more vulnerable to NBC's downturn in prime 
time.
