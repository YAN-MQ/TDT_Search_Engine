Miles Pennybacker, who helped start the Raytheon Co. 1925, died Nov. 
9 at the Watrous Nursing Home in Madison, Conn. Pennybacker, who lived 
in Westport, Conn., was 97. He started Voltarc Tubes in 1927 to make 
neon tubes for electric sign companies. He was able to fight off an 
infringement suit by Claude Neon, who held the neon patent, because 
of a singular design for an electrode that heated the helium gas in 
the neon tubes. He sold the company and retired in 1967. It was renamed 
Voltarc Technologies in 1989. He is survived by his wife, Jean; two 
daughters, Anne Watts of Rockville, Md., and Claire Wilson of Putney, 
Vt.; a son, Bruce, of Chapel Hill, N.C.; six grandchildren, and four 
great-grandchildren.
