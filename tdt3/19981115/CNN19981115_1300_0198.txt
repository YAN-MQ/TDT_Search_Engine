The Russian government is pleased with Iraq's decision to fully cooperate 
with U.N. weapons inspectors. But as Jill Dougherty reports, Russia 
didn't take any chances with its citizens in Iraq. Sunday, the Russian 
government prepared two planes to evacuate its women and children 
from Baghdad -- 107 family members of Russian embassy staff. The Russian 
ministry of emergency affairs said the evacuees were driven to iran, 
and from there, were to be flown to Moscow. The step came even as 
the Russian foreign minister was telling reporters there were "good 
prospects" for averting military action against Iraq. He spoke after 
meeting with U.S. secretary of state Madeleine Albright in malaysia. 
The U.N. security council meets again, and we believe there are good 
prospects for a political resolution to the crisis. Russian state 
television broadcast pictures of the United States military buildup 
in the Persian gulf, saying the Russian government, for its part, 
wants a strictly peaceful resolution of the crisis. But Russia also 
has been urging Iraq to resume cooperating with the United Nations 
on weapons inspections, sending messages from President Boris yeltsin 
to Iraqi President Saddam Hussein. In previous showdowns with Iraq, 
Russia launched rounds of shuttle diplomacy to Baghdad. Last February, 
Mr. Yeltsin bluntly warned President Clinton he risked starting world 
war III by taking military action against Iraq. This time, Russia 
itself seems frustrated with Saddam Hussein's brinksmanship. Here's 
how a reporter for Russian commercial TV network ntv explained it 
-- "Most likely, Baghdad realized this time, it was in complete isolation." 
That is one thing on which this time the Russian government and the 
U.S. government agree, that Saddam Hussein isolated himself. Jill 
Dougherty, CNN, Moscow.
