Fans of the TV show "the X-files" have a special episode coming up 
on november 22nd. Creator Chris Carter borrowed a technique pioneered 
by the late master of suspense, Alfred hitchcock. He filmed the show 
in real time. Real-time filmmaking is where the action takes place 
in long scenes, seemingly without changing camera shots. The episode 
is called "triangle" and involves a trip back in time where a Ship 
is taken over by Nazis.
