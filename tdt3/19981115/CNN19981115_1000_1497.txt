If you ever wondered how movies get a "pg," "R" or "X" rating, you're 
about to find out. It all starts in a building outside of Los Angeles. 
Ron tank explains. They are just letters and numbers, but for the 
last 30 years, movie ratings have advised us of films that were nude, 
those that were rude, movies that were lewd, or just crude. Dude! 
Dude! There has to be some kind of rating system, obviously, as long 
as children have the access they do. I'm not in favor of ratings systems 
at all because they end up being censorship. The motion picture association 
of America runs the rating system from this building near Los Angeles. 
A board of 12 screens each film and decides on a rating. But before 
they give their rating, I have said that they have to answer one question. 
Is the rating I'm about to propose for this film one that most parents 
in america would judge to be accurate? Ratings, of course, are subjective. 
The best picture of 1969, "midnight cowboy," was originally rated 
"X" for sexual content. The same movie is now an "R." And Clint Eastwood 
talked the board into changing "the bridges of Madison county" from 
"R" to "pg-13" in spite of some bad language. Back in the '30s, the 
so-called "hays code" prohibited dozens of words and actions and most 
moviemakers generally complied until "who's afraid of virginia woolf?" 
in 1966. And when is the little bugger coming home? And for the first 
time you heard on the screen language that had never before been allowed, 
"screw," "hump the hostess." That same year, "blow-up" ignored another 
taboo, nudity. Local governments rushed to form their own review boards. 
None of them exist today because what we're doing, we can do better 
than any government agency. There have been changes. "M" became "pg," 
and "pg-13" was added. "Henry & June" opened the door to "nc-17," 
the rating designed to separate serious adult themes from explicit 
sex films. But many theaters won't show "nc-17" films. The producer's 
of the sex spoof "orgasmo" are fighting its "nc-17" rating, claiming 
the board is more sensitive to sex than violence. "Saving private 
Ryan" I think might have been a perfect "nc-17" film, but because 
it's Spielberg, they gave it an "R." Surveys show that, for all its 
faults, most moviegoers would give the ratings system a "G," for good.
