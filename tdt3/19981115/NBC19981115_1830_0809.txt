From Africa tonight, word of the death of a key figure in America's 
civil rights struggle. As stokely car mikele in the mid60', he popularized 
the phrase black power. By the end of the that decade he'd move to 
Africa and taken another name. The cause of his death today, cancer. 
He was 57 years old.
