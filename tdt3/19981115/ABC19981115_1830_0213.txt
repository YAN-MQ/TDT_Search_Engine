Washington is claiming victory in getting Saddam Hussein to back down, 
but saddam Hussein is also claiming victory tonight. ABC's Morton 
dean is in Baghdad. On television this evening, there was a long special 
on today's celebration of Baghdad day, 1,200 years old, first called 
"the city of peace." There were no specials on the crisis. And on 
the main evening news, it was not even the lead story, but ten minutes 
in, there was no mention of President Clinton's statement. The government-controlled 
morning newspapers had already helped prepare public opinion on the 
wisdom of Iraq's doing the about-face -- the decision was wise, it 
was a new victory. It pulled the rug from under the feet of the American 
administration. Most Iraqis could not have known how close an attack 
was on Saturday night, that B-52s were already in the air. No mention 
of that on TV or in the papers. Even though Iraq has been through 
all this before, diners tonight said that the threat of an attack 
was not taken casually. He said, "yes, of course, we were expecting 
a strike at any moment, and we were prepared for it." In an interview 
tonight, Iraq's deputy prime minister, Tariq Aziz, strongly condemned 
President Clinton's statement, especially his suggestion that it might 
be time for someone else to become president of Iraq to replace saddam 
Hussein. Morton dean, ABC News, Baghdad.
