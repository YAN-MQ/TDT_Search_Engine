Saying ``our rifle is ready,'' Palestinian leader Yasser Arafat hinted 
darkly at armed conflict Sunday, prompting a sharp rebuke from Israel. 
The escalation of rhetoric came as U.S. envoy Dennis Ross sought to 
jump start implementation of the latest Mideast peace accord. A senior 
adviser to Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu said Arafat's 
comments were a ``declaration of war on the peace process.'' David 
Bar-Illan told The Associated Press that Netanyahu ``views such statements 
with the utmost severity,'' and would bring them up when his Cabinet 
meets this week before Israel begins withdrawing troops from the West 
Bank. An Israeli official, speaking on condition of anonymity, said 
the government had asked the United States, which mediated the recent 
peace agreement, to condemn Arafat's comments.
