Iraq's letter welcoming back U.N. arms inspectors means any attack 
carried out now by the United States would amount to ``naked aggression'' 
without legal grounds, an Iraqi official said Sunday. The Iraqi letter, 
sent Saturday to U.N. Secretary-General Kofi Annan, said the government 
of President Saddam Hussein was reversing decisions taken in August 
and October to halt cooperation with the inspectors. U.S. President 
Clinton's National Security adviser, Sandy Berger, described it as 
failing to meet American conditions by being ``neither unequivocal 
nor unconditional'' and said a punishing military strike remained 
an option. The U.N. Security Council adjourned after five hours of 
inconclusive discussion on Iraq's decision and scheduled a further 
session on Sunday. Khudeir ad-Duleimi, acting director of external 
information and editor of the state-run Baghdad Observer, told AP 
Television News that Iraq's letter ``deprived the United States of 
any pretext to commit its aggression.'' He added: ``If they want to 
launch an aggression, it would be a naked aggression without any political 
or legal justification.'' The United States apparently was concerned 
that a two-page ``annex'' to the letter, written by Deputy Prime Minister 
Tariq Aziz, amounted to placing conditions on the return of the inspectors. 
The Security Council had insisted they be allowed to return unconditionally. 
After the fuss arose, the Iraqi ambassador to the United Nations, 
Nizar Hamdoon, wrote another letter saying the annex only presents 
Iraq's views which ``are not linked to the clear and unconditional 
decision'' by Iraq to welcome back the inspectors. The annex outlined 
Iraq's expectations that a promised U.N. Security Council review of 
its cooperation with the council's resolutions would lead to easing 
or lifting trade sanctions imposed to punish Iraq for its 1990 invasion 
of Kuwait. The sanctions, which limit the sale of oil and other trade 
dealings, have devastated the Iraqi economy and made the country's 
22 million people dependent on U.N. relief. The Security Council has 
said they will not be lifted until the U.N. Special Commission and 
the International Atomic Energy Agency certify that Iraq is free of 
weapons of mass destruction. Iraq on Aug. 5 and Oct. 31 sharply limited 
the work of the inspection teams, but now has agreed to allow them 
to return ``to perform their normal duties.'' Editorials Sunday in 
state-run newspapers said the United States was seeking any opportunity 
to attack Iraq. All front pages carried the text of the letter to 
Annan, along with photos of Saddam meeting with his Revolutionary 
Command Council and the leadership of the ruling Baath party, which 
approved the letter. Al-Thawra, the newspaper published by the Baath 
party, said ``the leadership's decision pulled the carpet out from 
under the American administration, which continues to present misleading 
information about Iraq ... and hunts continuously for opportunities 
to start an aggression.'' It accused the United States of attempting 
to ``destabilize security and safety in the region'' and ``blackmail'' 
Arab countries to support its threats. Babil, which is published by 
Saddam's son Odai, said the American threats of a military strike 
were seen by Iraqis as ``a cruel joke.'' The U.N. sanctions, the paper 
said, had made Iraqis ``a daily target'' of the United States ``which 
made them suffer more than a military attack.'' A U.N. spokesman in 
Baghdad said, meanwhile, that a decision was reversed to send back 
to Iraq about 150 U.N. humanitarian workers pulled out last week for 
fear of a U.S. attack. Their return was announced Friday in New York 
after initial reports about Iraq's letter. But spokesman Eric Falt 
said the workers _ who help run food distribution to the Iraqi people 
_ would stay out ``because of the extended deliberations in the Security 
Council.''
