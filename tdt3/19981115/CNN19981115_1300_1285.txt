Who's number one? According to the new coaches' poll, it's Kansas 
state. The Wildcats now sit alone on top following the wild 40-30 
win over nebraska yesterday in Manhattan. State's first victory against 
the huskers since 1968. The coaches have Tennessee at number two. 
The Vols pulled off a dramatic 28-24 win against Arkansas and the 
volumes stay undefeated. UCLA is third, extending the nation's longest 
winning streak to 19 games by beating Washington, 36-24. The associated 
press rankings should be released later today.
