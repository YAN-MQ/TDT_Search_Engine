U.N. secretary-general Kofi Annan is welcoming President Clinton's 
acceptance of Iraq's reversal, describing it as "very statesman like." 
He also warns Iraq, a diplomatic solution may not be available if 
there are more problems. It seems like a repetition of what happened 
in February. This one seems to be a bit more complicated than February. 
And in February, after the agreement, there was compliance for a while. 
And then we were back at this in October. In August, sorry. I hope 
this time around, we will have sustained cooperation, sustained effort 
and we will not be back to this, because I think all the members do 
not appreciate the periodic crisis, and would want to see sustained 
cooperation with UNSCOM.
