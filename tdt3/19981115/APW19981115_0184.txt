Lebanese President Elias Hrawi has been discharged from a hospital 
after successfully undergoing heart treatment but will spend his last 
week as president recuperating at home. ``The president has recovered 
from a ballooning procedure to clear a blocked artery and is now ready 
to leave the hospital,'' a statement issued late Saturday by the Sacre 
Coeur Hospital said. Hrawi was discharged shortly afterwards and headed 
straight to his home in Yarze at Beirut's southeastern outskirts, 
where doctors said he must rest for one week. Hrawi, 73, was admitted 
to hospital Tuesday after a mild heart attack. He is due to step down 
as president on Nov. 24 at the end of an extended nine-year term. 
His successor is Emile Lahoud, who had bee commander of Lebanon's 
military. Hrawi is scheduled to chair the last Cabinet meeting of 
his term on Saturday. It was not clear if the president would attend 
or whether he will take part in Independence Day celebrations Nov. 
22.
