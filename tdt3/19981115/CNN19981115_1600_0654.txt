In two days, the earth will rendevouz with a dense cloud of dust left 
behind by a Comet. Sherry rauh looks at what that means for stargazers 
and spacecraft. From earth, it will appear as a dazzling, but harmless, 
display of shooting stars. Nothing more than a spectacular meteor 
shower. But the view from a spacecraft orbiting earth would be quite 
different -- more like driving on a dusty gravel road right behind 
a big truck. The Leonid shower happens every year without event, when 
earth crosses the dust trail left by Comet tempel-tuttle, around November 
17th. They all appear to come from the constellation Leo, hence the 
name "Leonid." But this year it's expected to be particularly intense 
-- a storm rather than a shower. That's because the Comet, which circles 
the sun every 33 years, has just left a fresh trail of dust where 
its path intersects earth's. Meteors -- small particles mostly from 
comets -- strike the earth all of the time. But only, very rarely, 
once every few decades, does the earth's orbit intersect a concentrated 
cloud of these particles to produce a meteor storm. Because the cloud 
is so dense and moving so quickly, it could pose a threat to the 600 
or so satellites orbiting earth -- satellites we depend on for everything 
from weather reports to telephone calls. For that reason, companies 
that operate satellites will be watching the storm as closely as any 
avid stargazer. Sherry rauh, "Headline News."
