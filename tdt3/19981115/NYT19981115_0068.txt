Prepare for the next Internet feeding frenzy. Sharks from several 
industries are already circling the nascent market for products and 
services that will enable consumers to receive and pay their monthly 
bills online. Electronic billing systems are expected not only to 
save merchants and banks billions of dollars in printing, paper and 
postage costs, but also to save time and deliver a new level of convenience 
for consumers. And the customer base is already a captive audience. 
By some reports, 60 percent of the 62 billion pieces of first-class 
mail delivered annually by the U.S. Postal Service are bills. Calculating, 
verifying, creating, mailing, collecting and processing those 37 billion 
statements have been estimated to cost $370 billion _ an average of 
$10 a bill, according to the report ``On Bills, Banks and Bill (Gates),'' 
published by Diamond Technology Partners (www.diamtech.com), a Chicago-based 
consulting firm. Diamond estimates that presenting and paying bills 
electronically could save 10 percent of that amount _ a huge incentive 
for large companies, in particular, to embrace e-billing. Merchants 
have already said they would be willing to pay as much as 40 cents 
a bill for such a service, instantly creating a market with a $15 
billion potential. Last week, Netscape Communications Corp. announced 
plans to offer Web-based e-billing software for online sellers. Transpoint, 
a joint venture of Microsoft Corp., First Data Corp. and Citigroup, 
plans to introduce its e-bill service this quarter. And the Integrion 
Financial Network, a consortium of banks, financial services and technology 
companies including Checkfree, IBM, RSA Data Security and Visa USA, 
is preparing to start an e-bill pilot with one of its owners, Bank 
One, in January. One version of an e-bill system would allow merchants 
to send monthly bills in an e-mail format that could be forwarded 
directly to a customer running bill-payment software like Quicken 
from Intuit. Another would allow consumers to view all their bills 
from one Web site. But the potential impact of e-bills could be much 
more significant than cost savings and simple convenience. William 
Fenimore, chief executive and managing director of Integrion, says 
that although e-bills are inevitable, such sweeping change comes slowly 
to big financial institutions. ``The biller community is further ahead 
than the banking community in terms of distributing these bills and 
getting them paid,'' he said. And that disparity presents an opportunity 
for the law of unintended consequences to kick in. That is because 
the Internet has given many different kinds of companies _ from Microsoft 
and Intuit, to brokerage firms and insurance companies _ the ability 
to offer financial services more cheaply and without the regulations, 
including those governing consumer privacy, that banks and other financial 
institutions must obey. Because merchants and financial institutions 
are unlikely to build e-bill technology themselves, many will be forced 
to yield their precious customer data to a technology or service provider 
_ Microsoft's Transpoint venture, for example _ to run the system 
for them. Clearly, companies like Integrion, with owners that are 
almost all banks, are a hedge against that. But that hedge may not 
hold. Once companies start delivering digital bills, says Gordon Bell, 
a senior researcher for Microsoft, other opportunities present themselves 
rather quickly. Bell says he has for years encouraged Microsoft's 
chairman, Bill Gates, to create a version of the Checkfree service. 
``The other thing is to give WebTV away to do just this kind of thing, 
with a bank account or whatever,'' he says. Some analysts say that 
such opportunities will forever change the balance of power between 
customers and merchants. Referring to software applications, Chunka 
Mui, a partner in Diamond Technology, said, ``The real reason this 
is a killer app is because the technology provides a platform for 
doing other things.'' Mui predicts that e-bill systems will start 
a new ``aggregator'' business that enables people to pay all their 
bills online in one place, rather than with individual merchants all 
over the Web _ as well as allowing those merchants to deliver precisely 
aimed junk advertising. ``All these folks are talking about how this 
becomes the marketing machine from heaven,'' he said. ``What they 
don't understand is that once these bills are in digital form, they 
are infinitely controllable by the customer. It won't take 25 seconds 
for someone to realize, `I could make a lot of money selling a filter 
for this junk.''' What is more, he said, ``It would only take another 
25 seconds to say, `Hey, if I work for the customer and not for the 
merchants, maybe I can create an alliance of consumers.''' To date, 
there are few consumer bill aggregators. One new start-up, Cyberbills.com 
in Santa Clara, Calif., recently began a consumer service that sends 
customers all their bills electronically. Mui says that such a service 
_ started as a cost-saver for merchants _ is actually ``stealth technology,'' 
a first step in returning the power over personal information to consumers 
who are tired of being bombarded with e-mail spam and junk advertising 
in all media. ``It's about aggregating power,'' says Mui. ``It's not 
about selling information to merchants. It's about going to the people 
and saying, `I know what you've bought _ let's do price comparisons 
for shopping, let's provide a direct connection to the seller when 
you have problems, things like that. This bill becomes the interface 
for so much _ it's a tremendous window onto the electronic world.''
