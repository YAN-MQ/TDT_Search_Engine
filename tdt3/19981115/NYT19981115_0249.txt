The acquisition of Ken Caminiti signaled the rebirth of the San Diego 
Padres' franchise four years ago, but now the third baseman is headed 
back to the Houston Astros. Caminiti, the National League's most valuable 
player in 1996, agreed to a two-year, $9.5 million contract with the 
Astros Sunday. The Padres, who acquired Caminiti as part of an 11-player 
trade with the Astros in December 1994, hoped to re-sign him. Given 
his diminished production, however _ he batted .252 with 29 home runs 
last season, after hitting .326 with 40 homers in 1996 and .290 with 
26 homers in 1997 _ San Diego wanted to pay him about $3 million a 
season, far below what other teams were offering. Caminiti was a Gold 
Glove winner in 1996 and 1997, but his defensive skills were dramatically 
hampered by injuries last season; playing against the Yankees in the 
World Series, he botched several plays, and twice his knee appeared 
to buckle as he took a swing. Even so, Caminiti, 35, has a well-earned 
reputation for toughness, and the Detroit Tigers dangled a three-year, 
$21.5 million contract in front of Caminiti before they signed Dean 
Palmer. Caminiti preferred to remain with the Padres or return to 
Houston, the team with which he broke into the big leagues in 1987. 
Houston also holds a $5.5 million option on Caminiti for the 2001 
season. Caminiti was happy to return to Houston, in part because he 
maintained his home in nearby Richmond, Tex. ``Baseball is a strange 
life on a family, and I think happiness is being with my family, my 
kids and my wife,'' he told The Associated Press. Like the Padres, 
the Yankees may have to fill an opening in their World Series lineup. 
Center-fielder Bernie Williams is considering offers from other clubs, 
so the Yankees are looking elsewhere. Brian Cashman, their general 
manager, flew to Arizona last night, apparently to meet with Albert 
Belle, the slugger who has another two weeks to decide if he wants 
to leave the Chicago White Sox. Belle, 32, would fit neatly into the 
cleanup slot in the Yankee lineup, between right-fielder Paul O'Neill 
and first-baseman Tino Martinez. An improved outfielder, Belle would 
play left field, and the Yankees would use either Ricky Ledee and 
Chad Curtis in center field, or acquire another center fielder, such 
as Anaheim's Jim Edmonds, or the free-agent Brian Jordan, who will 
meet with the Yankees on Wednesday. Boston also has interest in Belle, 
who others say is seeking a huge contract and wants to be among the 
game's highest-paid players. The Yankees are on the verge of completing 
a minor trade with the Minnesota Twins. The Yankees will receive Dan 
Naulty, a 28-year-old right-handed pitcher who has pitched in 97 games 
in the majors. In return, they will deal the minor-league infielder 
Allen Butler, an eighth-round pick in the 1996 draft.
