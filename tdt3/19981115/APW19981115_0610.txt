With choirs, prayers and speeches from politicians including President 
Roman Herzog, Germany held annual memorial day services Sunday remembering 
the victims of the century's two world wars and those killed in acts 
of terrorism. Before an audience of 1,500 in Berlin's lavish, gilded 
cathedral, Herzog read a traditional remembrance statement beginning: 
``We remember today the victims of violence and war, children, women 
and men of all nationalities.'' Giving the main address was Roland 
Ries, the mayor of Strasbourg, France, who urged France and Germany 
to guard against extreme right-wing movements. ``These voices, which 
make use of our democratic institutions, succeed in being heard by 
those who lack direction,'' Ries said. The leader of Germany's Jews, 
Ignatz Bubis, and the German army's chief of staff, Hartmut Bagger, 
laid wreaths Sunday morning at a cemetery for German Jewish soldiers 
killed in World War I. Berlin police held services remembering officers 
killed in the line of duty.
