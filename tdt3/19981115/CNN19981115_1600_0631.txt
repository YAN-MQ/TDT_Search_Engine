A Russian space official says the Mir space station will stay in orbit 
for at least another year. It had been scheduled for decommissioning 
next summer. Mir has been in orbit for more than ten years, and it 
costs the Russian government $13.6 million a year to operate. The 
United States and other nations want Russia to devote its resources 
instead to the international space station.
