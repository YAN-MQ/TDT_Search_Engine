It was Mayor Rudolph Giuliani's second visit to this largely rural 
state, and for the second time, he came to boast about his success 
in cutting taxes, crime and the welfare rolls back in the big city. 
But by Sunday morning, inquiring minds in Iowa had heard so much about 
New York that reporters decided it was time to question him about 
pressing local issues. What, for example, did the mayor of New York 
City think about Iowa's hog problem? In the interest of controlling 
odors and pollution, should state government limit the size of the 
confinement systems that large-scale hog enterprises employ? Or should 
the farms grow unfettered, so that Iowa can remain the nation's largest 
producer of pork? The mayor, who has a detailed opinion about most 
quality-of-life issues back home, said that it would be arrogant of 
him to propose a solution, but that he had asked a lot of questions 
about the matter, which he said he found fascinating. ``I just read 
an article in the newspapers today about the terrible problem of the 
independent and the small producers who are losing their businesses,'' 
Giuliani said Sunday during a morning taping of a television interview. 
``It's something that I would have to spend a lot of time looking 
at and studying.'' And so, whether the mayor came here because he 
is considering a run for higher office, which he has all but denied, 
or because he wants to help other Republicans around the country, 
as he says, he got a more realistic sense on his trip this time about 
what it might be like to run for national office. And Iowans got more 
of a sense of how he would deal with their concerns. Giuliani began 
his weekend visit here with a speech on Saturday at Iowa State University 
in Ames, on civility. It turned out to be his best chance to tout 
his accomplishments in New York. For the rest of his time in Iowa, 
he was thrown question after question about his ambitions for higher 
office and about how a quintessentially urban politician could succeed 
as a presidential candidate. There were questions about Giuliani's 
support of abortion and gay rights, and how he could win over the 
social conservatives who tend to dominate the nominating process for 
Presidential candidates. Giuliani waded delicately through the queries, 
saying he had far more in common with social conservatives than it 
seemed. ``They are entitled to their viewpoint and I am entitled to 
mine, and we should respect each other,'' he said in the television 
interview. ``In areas where there are differences of personal conscience 
or whatever, let's agree that the party is broad enough to embrace 
both of us.'' For that matter, Giuliani wanted people to know that 
he had a lot more in common with Midwestern farmers than it seemed. 
``This is without reference to running for President,'' he said, ``but 
to give us a sense of how connected we are as human beings, 90 percent 
of the issues that I read about in The Des Moines Register or that 
I've talked about in Iowa or South Carolina or all over, are the same 
in New York City.'' Local reporters were not the only ones treating 
Giuliani as a Presidential candidate. Hugh Winebrenner, a professor 
of political science at Drake University in Des Moines, came to the 
Mayor's speech at Iowa State University to compare him with other 
politicians who have trooped through Iowa recently. The first thing 
that Dr. Winebrenner said he noticed was Giuliani's security detail: 
two guards standing in the front of the room where the Mayor spoke 
to a crowd of about 450, and at least one more in the back, whispering 
into a microphone on his wrist. There was also a state trooper stationed 
by the door. ``The guy comes in here like he's already President of 
the United States,'' Dr. Winebrenner said. ``Most of them come in 
by themselves, or with a single staffer. This is a little too big-time 
for Iowa.'' But despite his prominence, Giuliani has plenty of obstacles 
to overcome if he is to be considered a serious Presidential contender 
in Iowa, said Dr. Winebrenner, who studies the Iowa caucuses and keeps 
a running tally of every politician who visits. ( Giuliani has spent 
only three days here, he noted, but Lamar Alexander spent 36 and Dan 
Quayle 19.) ``He certainly starts out with a well-known name, and 
that was a heck of a good crowd there today,'' Winebrenner said Sunday. 
``But it's yet to be seen whether there's a place for a moderate like 
Rudy Giuliani in Iowa this year.'' Tom Rice, the political science 
professor who invited the Mayor to speak at Iowa State University, 
had a different view. People outside New York state know Giuliani 
not so much for his politics, he said, but for his appearances on 
national television shows: ``Saturday Night Live,'' ``The Late Show 
With David Letterman'' and, most recently, ``The Guiding Light.'' 
In other words, Rice said, they know Giuliani as a celebrity. ``When 
I tell my students Giuliani is coming, they think `Saturday Night 
Live,' and I mean that in a good way,'' he said after the speech, 
waiting for Giuliani to finish taping an interview with a CNN crew 
who had flown in from Atlanta. ``He's someone people can identify 
with beyond politics. I don't want to say a cultural icon, but he's 
crossed the line from politics into a broader appeal.'' Rice said 
he had invited a number of ``major politicians who are talking like 
Presidential candidates,'' and that Giuliani was the first to accept. 
[After Iowa, the Mayor flew to Detroit to deliver a speech, and was 
to continue his travels on Monday in Tennessee, after a hasty return 
to New York for John Glenn's parade.) Neelika Jayawardane, a graduate 
student at Iowa State, said she was impressed by the size of the crowd 
_ only the rap musician Ice-T and the anthropologist Stephen Jay Gould 
have drawn larger audiences there in recent years, she said. But people 
were too focused on Giuliani's celebrity status, she said. ``People 
stop using their critical thinking skills when they are gullible enough 
to buy into someone's celebrity,'' she said. ``He has this fame that 
he has developed by going on television shows, and that's very smart. 
But who is he, really?''
