A 90-day moratorium on Russia's foreign debt repayments expired Sunday, 
but the government and the country's troubled commercial banks may 
not be able to resume payments. The Russian government decided Aug. 
17 to impose the 90-day moratorium on repayments of foreign commercial 
debt when it devalued the ruble. A number of foreign creditors threatened 
to seize Russian assets overseas as a result, but little action came 
as a result. Some of the country's larger banks will be able to pay 
their debts, but many will face law suits and see their foreign assets 
seized, the Interfax news agency said. Russian banks' debt on forward 
contracts to foreign banks totals about dlrs 6 billion, but the banks 
will probably be able to pay off no more than dlrs 2 billion, Interfax 
said. And as the banks scramble for dollars to pay off the debts, 
the ruble rate is likely to fall hard, Interfax said, citing an unidentified 
source. The Central Bank will ``help our banks keep the negotiations 
with Western creditors going'' and try to head off any law suits, 
said Central Bank Vice Chairman Andrei Kozlov, according to Interfax. 
But Central Bank Chairman Viktor Gerashchenko said the body would 
only support those banks that can insure debt settlements and retain 
``the skeleton of the banking system,'' according to the ITAR-Tass 
news agency.
