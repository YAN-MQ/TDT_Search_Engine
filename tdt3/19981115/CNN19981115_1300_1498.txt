The annual cattle fair at pushkar in India is one of the largest in 
the world. But Anita Pratap reports, it's also a place of pilgrimage. 
It's fair time in pushkar. Every November tens of thousands of villagers 
come from miles around to buy and sell camels, cows and Buffalo. There 
is a wide range of animals to choose from. And they're all in one 
place, otherwise we have to roam around in different villages. Prices 
are cheaper too. a camel costs $300, a cow $100. But it's not just 
animals they come for. Men come to buy farm tools, women jewelry and 
cosmetics. Then there are the contests. There's the one to judge how 
many men a camel can carry. And, of course the one to see how fast 
the camels can run. And it wouldn't be a fair without a beauty pageant. 
But this is no ordinary beauty contest. My cow has been declared the 
beauty queen of pushkar fair. She also got the first prize for producing 
the most milk. She gave 54 liters of milk in a day. There's even a 
tug-of-war between local women and the tourists. Oh, it's very hard, 
my arms are so tired, pulling and pulling. We just can't last. Of 
course we won. We are strong. We eat plenty of fresh butter. There's 
something else that brings these people to pushkar. This is a cattle 
fair, but it's also a place of pilgrimage. That's why we come every 
year. Pushkar is the only place in India where there is a temple to 
hindu God brahma, the creator of the universe. This is one of the 
most sacred places in India and during these four days it becomes 
even more holy, because pilgrims believe this is the time when all 
the 330 million Hindu gods descend to this spot. It's also a time 
when many Hindu holy men descend from the mountains to join ordinary 
worshipers for a sacred dip in the pushkar lake. Then after washing 
away their sins, villagers trek back home laden with goods. But they'll 
be back next year, when once again it'll be fair time in pushkar.
