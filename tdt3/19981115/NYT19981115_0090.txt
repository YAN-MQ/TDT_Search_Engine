It seems like the middle of nowhere, dunes dotted with little more 
than herds of sheep and the occasional camel carcass. But it is home 
to 1,500 American soldiers _ roving the desert just 30 miles east 
of the Iraqi border _ and some of them are getting sick of Saddam 
Hussein. ``I think we should just go ahead and do it,'' Pfc. Carlos 
De La Cruz, 22, of Newark, N.J., said Sunday as he stood guard on 
a sandy berm at the camp there. ``No sense in us keep coming back 
every time.'' He was not spoiling for a fight, but echoing what he 
and other soldiers said was a common view the day after Saddam announced 
that he would comply, after all, once again, at the last moment, with 
conditions for United Nations weapons inspections. ``I think he's 
playing games,'' De La Cruz said. And so, he added, the United States 
should strike at Iraq despite its leader's promises. Few Americans 
are closer to the dispute with Iraq than the soldiers here. Several 
thousand of them rotate in and out for training with the Kuwaiti military. 
And, along with other soldiers stationed around the Persian Gulf, 
the last several days have been tense ones, as the possibility of 
a military confrontation _ perhaps a fierce one _ neared, then apparently 
receded after Iraq said it would comply with the inspections. In February, 
the last time Saddam decided not to comply with the weapons inspections, 
the military presence here in Kuwait ballooned to some 10,000 men 
and women over five weeks. In all, there were some 44,000 U.S. troops 
in the Persian Gulf. So far this time, only a handful of additional 
troops have arrived in Kuwait. While military officials here have 
declined to discuss numbers, military officials in Washington said 
that another 3,000 ground troops are eventually scheduled to reach 
Kuwait, starting early this week, largely to serve as defense against 
any possible Iraqi attack here. In addition, air power will be increased. 
As of Sunday evening, military officials said they were not aware 
that Saddam's offer of an agreement without conditions _ and President 
Clinton's conditional acceptance of that offer _ would halt that buildup. 
``There is nothing that has changed,'' said Col. Ron Williams, the 
head Army spokesman in Kuwait. ``The question is how much will that 
change. The military is continuing to plan.'' Since the United States 
went to war with Iraq in 1991, in part to free Kuwait from an Iraqi 
invasion, the American and Kuwaiti militaries have worked together 
closely. They conduct joint desert training on the Udairi range _ 
where De La Cruz has been living in a tent for three months now _ 
and at two air bases, Ahmad Al Jaber, about 25 miles south of Kuwait 
City, and at Ali Al Salem, about the same distance to the northwest. 
In addition, there is a permanent U.S. military base on the Kuwait 
Bay, Camp Doha. Although the information is not normally secret, military 
officials were reluctant to give out even basic details about the 
bases, and the soldiers themselves have been kept largely behind base 
walls. But in a handful of interviews Sunday, soldiers expressed frustration 
at what they said they saw as a problem with Iraq that would not go 
away. Saddam, several said, should have been a casualty of the 1991 
war. ``It has been a couple of times for me,'' said Pvt. Erik Tackett, 
27, of Newport Beach, Calif., who has served in the region before 
and was standing guard with De La Cruz. ``I'm getting real sick of 
it.'' Pvt. Michael Bucci, 23, of Chambersburg, Pa., said he felt the 
same way. ``My opinion,'' he said, his head poked out of a Humvee 
and his machine gun swinging out into the desert, ``we should just 
bomb the hell out of him _ get it over with.'' But like soldiers everywhere, 
he said, he was also not sad if he did not have to fight. ``If we 
go in, we go,'' he said. ``If not, even better. We'll be home by Christmas.'' 
But his partner in guarding the range, Sgt. James Rundberg, from New 
Baltimore, N.Y., outside of Albany, said that going to war was something 
the nation should approach with caution. ``There is no need for us 
to rush into it, as long as he's going to comply and he's going to 
comply fully,'' Rundberg said. ``If not, I guess we're going to have 
to do whatever the higher-ups think we ought to do.''
