The title of John Maddox's arresting new book, ``What Remains to Be 
Discovered,'' is in one sense self-contradictory, simply because you 
can't foresee what must still be obscure. Maddox, for 23 years the 
editor of the journal Nature and now its editor emeritus, is the first 
to concede this point. In his introduction, he reviews the high points 
of all that has been discovered in the last four centuries, and he 
emphasizes how little of what was to come was discerned in the years 
1700, 1800 and 1900. ``The record of previous centuries,'' he concludes, 
``suggests that the excitement in the years ahead will spring from 
the answers to the questions we do not yet know enough to ask.'' Nevertheless, 
he writes, if ``the nature of the discoveries that will deepen understanding 
of the world cannot be perfectly anticipated,'' those discoveries 
will tend to ``spring from current understanding, and usually from 
contradictions that have become apparent.'' So he sets as his task 
in ``What Remains to Be Discovered'' a review of the current understanding 
of and apparent contradictions in the areas he identifies as ``Matter,'' 
``Life'' and ``Our World.'' He asks the big questions and reviews 
the current status of answers that have been proposed. How did the 
universe begin? How does it work? What came first, the galaxies or 
the stars? How did life begin? When did sexual reproduction arise? 
What is consciousness? Memory? Imagination? In the 20th century, great 
progress has been made in offering some answers to these questions. 
Einstein's ``general relativity (gravitational) theory'' and the theory 
of quantum mechanics are ``perhaps the two outstanding intellectual 
achievements of this century,'' Maddox writes. ``As a direct consequence 
of the structure of DNA,'' he continues, ``both the internal working 
of the cell and the mechanism of inheritance in plants and animals 
(including the development of embryos from fertilized eggs), has become 
susceptible to laboratory investigation.'' And, he adds, ``the past 
century has marvelously described and cataloged the properties of 
the cells in the working brain as well as its several separate structures.'' 
Yet, he concludes, the more we have come to understand in these various 
fields, the deeper are some of the contradictions that have arisen. 
And out of these contradictions must come future discoveries. For 
instance, he argues, the fact that the amount of matter estimated 
in the universe ``obdurately falls short of expectation'' suggests 
that ``there is more to empty space than the name suggests'' and that 
out of it may come ``what many physicists refer to as a `new physics,' 
a physics regulated by principles not yet imagined.'' For another 
instance, he argues, the more that is understood about genetics, the 
more complex appears the challenge of ``understanding how a particular 
sequence of DNA determines the character of the organism to which 
it belongs.'' He concludes: ``Already it seems probable that the protein 
products of most genes will turn out to have more than one function 
_ that for which they are named and several others. Like the cell 
biologists, geneticists will be driven to make computer models of 
the genome before they will be able to make sense of all this complexity.'' 
Finally, he argues, for all that has been learned about brain cells, 
``how the brain functions both in the everyday world and as the human 
attribute of mind is hardly clearer now than at the beginning of the 
century.'' For Maddox these gaps and contradictions suggest how science 
will progress. To his limited predictions he adds practical suggestions. 
``Cosmology has a crying need of an accurate map of the nearby universe,'' 
he writes. Progress must also be made on the Human Genome Diversity 
Project, a debated plan to study systematically the genetic structure 
of different populations. ``It is potentially a way,'' he says, ``of 
uncovering in great detail the cultural and even ethnic history of 
Homo sapiens.'' And the human mind should be further modeled by means 
of computers, the author's implication being that by this means such 
mysteries as long-term memory and imagination will eventually be cleared 
up. More practically still, Maddox concludes his book by envisioning 
four potential calamities to humankind and by proposing what might 
be done to avoid them. These are climatic change resulting from ``the 
accumulation of carbon dioxide in Earth's atmosphere''; the rise of 
``novel and resurgent infections''; the possibility of ``meteoric 
impacts on the surface of the Earth,'' and the possible unstableness 
of the human genome, meaning that people could simply cease to exist, 
there being no guarantee that even the fittest of species must survive 
indefinitely. ``In reality,'' the author concludes, ``there is no 
reason why any of the potential calamities now foreseen, even the 
most scary among them, cannot be avoided. But avoidance requires vigilance 
and courage. Will we have enough?'' A reader sizing up Maddox's book 
100 years from now would no doubt be struck by how little he was able 
to foretell. But ``What Remains to Be Discovered'' is still useful 
as a summing up of present knowledge. Future readers will gain perspective 
on the latest millennial juncture in history. Present readers can 
learn just how much we already know. PUBLICATION NOTES: `WHAT REMAINS
