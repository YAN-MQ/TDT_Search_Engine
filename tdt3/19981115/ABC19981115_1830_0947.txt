As deadly as the storm was, few people felt the full fury of hurricane 
mitch because it weakened to a tropical storm shortly after hitting 
land. 31 crew members aboard the tall ship "fantome" did feel Mitch's 
fury, and none of them survived. The question now being asked by their 
families is why was the "fantome" at sea at all? ABC's Bill Redeker 
reports. She was the flagship of windjammer's fleet, a 300-foot reconditioned 
tall ship called the "fantome," a schooner that plied the caribbean, 
carrying vacationers to exotic ports of call. Three weeks ago tonight, 
Anthony moffa and Karen rutlidge boarded the ship for what would be 
its final voyage. There was the ship sitting there, all lit up. It 
just was a very impressive sight to see the ship out there. So even 
though we had the rain, there wasn't an ominous feeling at that point. 
But when the "fantome" weighed anchor that night, she was doomed to 
the fury of hurricane Mitch and its 180 mile per hour winds. Setting 
sail from Honduras to avoid the storm, captain guyan March first headed 
west and then north to Belize. All 97 passengers disembarked safely. 
I felt somewhat guilty that we were all going to a safe haven and 
the future for captain guyan and his men was questionable. "questionable" 
because the captain and his crew of 30 headed back out to sea, a frequently 
used strategy to avoid losing a ship in the harbor. We had a choice 
to stay in the path of the storm or get out. And, of course, our choice 
was to get out of the way. But once at sea and now headed southeast 
away from the storm, something unpredictable occurred -- hurricane 
Mitch suddenly changed course and for an unbelievable 18 hours raged 
around the ship until all that was left was scattered wreckage. What 
happened is that the forecasters were wrong. The "fantome" was virtually 
cut off by the change of course of the hurricane. The families of 
some of the crewmen are now suing windjammer, charging the captain 
should never have set sail that awful night, that the company cared 
more about saving its ship than the lives of its crew. To attempt 
to sail out in the most terrible hurricane in 100 years is just insanity. 
It was a suicide mission. While the courts now take up that question, 
nearly everyone agrees that no matter how good the ship and crew, 
sometimes storms seem to hunt down ships until they win. Bill Redeker, 
ABC News, New York.
