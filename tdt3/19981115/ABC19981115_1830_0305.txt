Among Iraq's neighbors, the reaction to today's news is mixed. There 
is mistrust of Saddam Hussein, but there is also criticism of the 
U.S. ABC's Richard Gizbert has that story. In Cairo this morning, 
well before the White House made its announcement, the headlines were 
already saying Iraq had given in to america. But not all Egyptians 
were happy with the way it happened. "America shouldn't make military 
threats every time there's a problem," he says. In Jordan, state-run 
TV quoted President Clinton on Baghdad backing down and on his call 
for a change of Iraqi government. However, nowhere in the Arab world 
is the hostility for Saddam Hussein as great as it is here in Kuwait. 
Having suffered at the hands of Iraq's military once, Kuwaitis have 
good reason to mistrust the intentions of the Iraqi leader. And some 
don't like the idea of Saddam Hussein being able to negotiate yet 
another diplomatic solution. U states to make him, to teach him very 
well. But there were signs that after so many showdowns in Iraq, some 
kuwaitis were less worried about the possible consequens. This sre 
sd about 000 gas masks during the buildup nine mont ago. This time, 
it got a lot of calls, but only about 100 buyers. And the TV sets 
at Kuwait city's desert storm cafe were tuned out of the news this 
evening and tuned in to American wrestling -- two indications that 
while people in Kuwait still consider Saddam Hussein its enemy, they're 
weary of his pattern of defiance followed by capitulation at the 11th 
hour. Riard Gizbert, ABC News, Kuwait city.
