Now to a new complication for divorcing couples trying to sort through 
who gets what. CNBC's Sharon Epperson reports on custody fights over 
company stock. The Wall Street boom of the '90s has put a spotlight 
on the latest battlefront in divorce wars stock options. The area 
of stock options, whether vested or unvested stock options, is probably 
the hottest area in family law right now. Employees are awarded stock 
options to buy their company's stock in the future at a set price. 
If the stock goes up, employees can make money when they finally cash 
in. They've become mainstream incentives at more than 120 U.S. companies. 
In fact, some companies are granting option grants to every single 
one of their employees worldwide. As more of them are being offered, 
divorce courts, in almost every state, are struggling and lawyers 
are battling over what to do with stock options, particularly those 
that can't be cashed in until years after the marriage has ended. 
Because now they've become valuable, people who received them in the 
early '90s are now beginning to get divorced, and the issue has to 
be dealt with. Lorna wendt's divorce case and stock option feud has 
already gained national attention. She was a corporate wife, married 
for 31 years to Gary wendt, the CEO of GE capital, an extremely profitable 
arm of General Electric, the parent company of NBC. She got a $20 
million judgment that included $3 million in cash for a Portion of 
his vested and unvested stock options. Lorna wanted a 50/50 split 
on all assets, including those stock options. It gets down to the 
principle of how we treat one another, and two people, when they marry, 
are equals. And in my case that translates into stock options, restricted 
stock units. But the Connecticut judge ruled she wasn't entitled to 
half his options because all of them hadn't come due yet. The judgment 
involved a complex formula of what was hers versus what was his. Wendt 
is appealing her case. Experts say devising such formulas isn't uncommon 
and figuring out how much stock options are worth can be confusing 
and contentious. You have to find out when they were earned, what 
the parties doing to earn it, whether they were for past services 
or for future services. They're supposed to have a division of wealth 
that is accumulated to the point and time when the marriage ends. 
With options that's a very complicated question. Leading to complicated 
answers that will likely vary in every case in every court in the 
fights over this increasingly common form of property. Sharon Epperson, 
for NBC news, New York.
