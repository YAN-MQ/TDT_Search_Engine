One result from the standoff with Iraq can be found just outside the 
country's borders. Food supplies have been piling up over the last 
week. The U.N. staff that distributes aid under a food-for-oil deal 
was pulled out of the country. There is no immediate danger of shortages 
though. Iraq gets the supplies on a monthly basis, and this month's 
rations already have been distributed.
