He had to wait 11 years after his first attempt, but on Sunday, Rocco 
Morabito finally drove his sister all the way to the beach. He was 
safe at last from the police, thanks to the learner's permit he got 
on his 16th birthday, and he handled the car even better than he had 
the first time. ``It's easier when you can see over the top of the 
steering wheel,'' he explained as he pulled out of the garage at his 
family's home in Port Chester, navigating the same narrow driveway 
where his famous ride began the morning of Dec. 4, 1987. At the time, 
Rocco was 5 years old and 3 feet tall. His 2-year-old sister, Brandi, 
wanted to go the beach, and Rocco got halfway there, cruising at 20 
miles an hour along a main thoroughfare in Westchester County. Then 
a police officer in Rye, Robert Vogel, spotted their car, which appeared 
to be driverless. Rocco responded to the flashing lights and siren. 
``He pulled over perfectly,'' Vogel reported. ``He didn't even hit 
the curb. It was a beautiful job.'' The two children, who were wearing 
pajamas, started crying for their mother, but Rocco regained his composure 
when Vogel said she would be summoned to pick them up. ``My mommy 
can't come here because I have the only car,'' Rocco told the officer. 
``I can drive. I'll go get her.'' Rocco was front-page news (``JUNIOR 
JOY RIDE'') in New York City, and for a while his ride was better 
known internationally than Paul Revere's. Well-wishers and automotive 
companies showered him with cards and gifts. He was interviewed by 
David Letterman and countless journalists, who happily reported his 
ambition to become a truck driver. His best media moment came when 
he was asked on ``A Current Affair'' if he had learned any lesson 
from the experience. ``Yes,'' he replied. ``I learned how to drive.'' 
Actually, he'd had a little practice beforehand, because his grandfather 
had let Rocco sit in his lap and drive the car around a parking lot. 
But it still took remarkable initiative to make off with the car. 
``We always knew he was a smart, observant kid,'' said his mother, 
Susan Morabito. ``He'd carefully watch everything you did. But we 
never imagined he could figure out how to take the car. I almost had 
a heart attack when they called me.'' Rocco got the car keys by standing 
on a chair to reach his mother's purse on top of the refrigerator. 
He opened the garage door, put his sister in the back seat and buckled 
her seat belt. Then he moved the automatic front seat all the way 
forward and the steering wheel all the way down. He set off, carefully 
avoiding the wall lining the driveway. ``It was raining, so I stopped 
in the driveway to turn on the windshield wipers,'' he recalled. ``I 
knew how to do that from watching my dad. Then I pulled out of the 
driveway and watched for other cars. I could just see over the dashboard 
if I looked through the steering wheel.'' As he retraced the route 
Sunday along Midland Avenue, he pointed out the stoplights where he'd 
dutifully observed the law, and recalled the little drama at the intersection 
with Peck Avenue. ``When I was stopped at this light,'' he said, ``a 
man came up to me and said: `You're not supposed to be driving. Get 
out of the car.' He tried to reach in and turn off the engine, but 
I hit the power window. As the window was rolling up, I started to 
drive away. He got his hand caught for a moment and then let go.'' 
But it was only a temporary escape, because the man found Vogel in 
a nearby deli and sent him in pursuit of the two outlaws. ``We were 
really scared when he pulled us over,'' Rocco said. ``My sister tried 
hiding under the back seat. I slid over to the passenger's seat to 
pretend I hadn't been driving.'' Alas, Vogel was onto them. On Sunday, 
after safely conducting his family's new station wagon to the beach 
at Rye Playland, Rocco said he still found driving exciting, but confessed 
that he had set aside his truck-driving ambitions. As a junior at 
Port Chester High School, he plays on the football and baseball teams, 
and is hoping to get a sports scholarship to college. ``I'd love to 
play professional sports,'' he said. As they looked out at the water 
Sunday, Rocco and Brandi still couldn't explain exactly what came 
over them that morning in 1987. ``I've been asked over and over why 
I did it,'' Rocco said, ``but I don't know. The only reason I can 
think of is that my sister wanted to go to the beach.''
