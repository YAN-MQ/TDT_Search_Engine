Early games in the NFL are under way. Less than a week after arthroscopic 
surgery on his knee, 35-year-old randall Cunningham got the start 
for Minnesota against Cincinnati. Co-leaders in the AFC east, Miami 
at Carolina. The jets, right up there with the dolphins, are in Indianapolis. 
Doug Flutie facing his former team. The bills in New England. Philly 
at Washington. Great AFC central battle. Interesting to see if the 
steelers let down after beating green bay. Kerry Collins gets the 
start for the saints as they host St. Louis. The big one -- sellout 
crowd in Atlanta for the first time in three years. The falcons battle 
San Fran for sole possession for sole possession of first place in 
the NFC west.
