A French man who had lit a fire in his chimney to keep warm was burned 
alive after he felt ill and fell into the fireplace where the flames 
consumed him, police said. Jean Pautier, 63, lived alone and there 
was no one to help him escape the flames Saturday evening in his home 
in the Dordogne region of central France, police said. A neighbor 
who had come to bring Pautier a document found the elderly man about 
8:30 p.m. (1830 GMT) and quickly alerted the police.
