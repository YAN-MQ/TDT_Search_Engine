The appeals panel of European soccer's governing body Sunday confirmed 
the decision to kick Fiorentina out of the UEFA Cup for the rest of 
the season because of an explosion that injured a match official. 
The UEFA Appeals Body announced its decision after listening to the 
Italian club's bid to have the game replayed. The incident stopped 
the match earlier this month in a game against Switzerland's Grasshoppers. 
The game was played in Salerno and not in Florence, and the fan who 
tossed the explosive device from the stands was apparently a supporter 
of rival Italian club Salernitana. UEFA ruled last Sunday that Fiorentina 
was responsible for order and security both inside and around the 
stadium, but said the ``mitigating circumstances'' stopped it being 
excluded from future UEFA club competitions.
