People for the ethical treatment of animals has a celebrity spokesman 
this thanksgiving season. Actor Joaquin Phoenix is appearing in a 
new television commercial for the group. The commercial tries to persuade 
Americans to forego eating Turkey at thanksgiving. Phoenix, who is 
a vegetarian, characterizes the holiday as an occasion for the murder 
of turkeys. In the commercial, the sight of a frozen Turkey in the 
supermarket prompts phoenix to call "peta" for vegetarian recipes.
