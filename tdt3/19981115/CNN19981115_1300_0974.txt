Compaq computer plans to go head-to-head with direct computer Sellers 
gateway and Dell. It will offer customers the opportunity to buy new 
computers over the phone and the Internet. Charles Molineaux has more. 
The rise of direct computer Sellers Dell and gateway has become an 
industry sea change other computermakers can't ignore. And Compaq's 
new emphasis on direct sales is a powerful endorsement of the strategy. 
We believe this will become the winning model in the PC industry because 
it gives customers the choice of doing business the way they want. 
Direct sales now accounts for 35% of all PCs sold, and analysts expect 
it'll make up half the market within the next five years. PC watchers 
call it an approach ideally suited to computer sales. Technology products 
in general decline in value 1% or 2% every week, so every week of 
inventory adds an incremental 1% to 2% of cost to your product. And 
that's why it's very important to have very lean inventory levels. 
Selling direct is sometimes one way to achieve very low inventory 
levels. Buying direct also has great appeal for the most desirable 
PC customers -- big corporate buyers -- which usually have their own 
computer support staffs and would rather not pay a premium for conventional 
retail frills. Still, analysts say the ideal model may ultimately 
be a hybrid that combines the inventory efficiencies of direct build-to-order 
operations and the physical presence of a real live store -- a dual 
strategy being aggressively pursued by CompUSA. Everyone recognizes 
direct and this build-to-order is a more profitable business method, 
as opposed to stocking your shelves and hoping the product moves off 
of them. I don't believe that retail is going away, either. Industry 
watchers say there will always be people who want to go to a store, 
talk to a live person and see and touch their PCs before buying one, 
something especially true for first-time computer buyers, whose ranks 
are growing as PC prices fall. Charles Molineaux, "CNN Financial News,"
