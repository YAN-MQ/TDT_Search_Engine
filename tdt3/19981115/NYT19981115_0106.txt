The youngest son of former Prime Minister Pierre Trudeau was swept 
into a mountain lake by an avalanche in British Columbia on Friday 
and is presumed drowned, police officials said Sunday. Heavy snow 
has forced rescue teams to suspend their search. The young man, Michel 
Trudeau, 23, was trying to make his way out of the Kokanee Glacier 
Provincial Park, about 100 miles north of the Washington-Idaho border, 
when he and three friends were caught in a snowslide that pushed them 
down the mountain and swept two of them into the frigid waters of 
Kokanee Lake, the police said. Skiers who witnessed the avalanche 
hiked to a nearby town and called the police. A rescue helicopter 
arrived Saturday morning and picked up three of the skiers but Trudeau 
was not found. Sgt. Russ Grabb, a spokesman for the Royal Canadian 
Mounted Police, said divers would be sent to search the lake once 
the weather clears and the snow surrounding the lake can be stabilized 
by dropping explosives from a helicopter. Grabb said Trudeau was considered 
``missing and presumed drowned.'' Trudeau, a microbiologist, spent 
the last year in British Columbia working as a ski instructor. Grabb 
said Trudeau and five friends had hiked to a back country cabin in 
the park on Wednesday to ski. On Friday afternoon, Trudeau and three 
others decided to hike down the mountain and return to their car. 
As they hiked, the four men were hit by an avalanche. Trudeau and 
a friend, Andrew Bednarz, 23, were swept into the lake, the sergeant 
said. The other two were dragged to the edge of the water. Hikers 
who came along the trail just after the accident said Trudeau and 
his heavy backpack had been carried about 300 feet into the lake. 
One hiker, Paul Williamson, told police that he could see Trudeau 
``shouting for help and groaning.'' ``We could see him,'' Williamson 
said. ``We knew it was going to be a slow and painful death. But we 
couldn't reach him. He was in the middle of the lake.'' A spokesman 
for Pierre Trudeau, who is now 79 and lives in Montreal, issued a 
statement saying the former prime minister is deeply saddened at the 
accident of the youngest of his three sons but will be making no further 
public comment. Nor has his former wife, Margaret, made any public 
comment.
