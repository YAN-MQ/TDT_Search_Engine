President Joseph Estrada announced Monday that an abducted Italian 
priest has been freed unharmed by kidnappers in the southern Philippines 
after more than two months of captivity. The kidnappers handed over 
the Rev. Luciano Benedetti to Muslim rebels belonging to the Moro 
Islamic Liberation Front in a thickly forested area in southern Zamboanga 
province late Sunday. The rebels then turned the priest over to government 
officials. ``This is good news. Father Benedetti was not hurt. He's 
strong and we greeted each other over the phone,'' Estrada told a 
Manila radio station. Officials plan to escort Benedetti to a meeting 
with Estrada before the Philippine leader flies to Malaysia later 
Monday for a summit of Pacific Rim nations. Benedetti, 54, from Treviso, 
was kidnapped Sept. 8 by suspected Muslim rebels in Sibuco in Zamboanga 
del Norte province, and his kidnappers have demanded a ransom of 10 
million pesos (dlrs 250,000), officials and rebel leaders have said. 
Several other people remain in the hands of different groups of kidnappers, 
including the family of a Taiwanese businessman, a pair of Hong Kong 
citizens and a Malaysian, all kidnapped in the southern Mindanao region. 
Al Haj Murad, the vice chairman of the MILF for military affairs, 
said the MILF secured Benedetti's release without paying a ransom. 
The MILF is the larger of two Muslim rebel groups still battling the 
central government in an attempt to establish a separate Islamic state 
in the southern Philippines. It is involved in on-and-off peace negotiations 
with Manila and has promised to help the government combat rampant 
kidnappings in Mindanao, although the military says the rebels might 
be involved in some abductions. Estrada has launched a high-profile 
campaign against the kidnappings and scored a major victory last month 
with the rescue of several victims and the arrest of their alleged 
abductors in Manila. He promised upon taking office in June to end 
the kidnappings within six months.
