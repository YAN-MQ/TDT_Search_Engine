Barbara Thornton, a singer and musicologist who, with Benjamin Bagby, 
founded and directed Sequentia, the medieval music ensemble, died 
Nov. 8 at the Caritas hospice in Cologne, Germany. She was 48 and 
lived in Cologne. The cause was complications from a brain tumor, 
Jon Aaron, her manager, said. Ms. Thornton, whose soprano voice had 
a mezzolike hue and a texture that gave it a distinctive character, 
was a specialist in the music of the 12th-century abbess Hildegard 
von Bingen, and it was largely because of Ms. Thornton's performances 
and recordings with Sequentia that Hildegard and her works have lately 
become the focus of scholarly and popular interest. In 1982, when 
Sequentia toured with a production of Hildegard's ``Ordo Virtutum,'' 
an allegorical work in which the soul is confronted by both the Virtues 
and the Devil, Hildegard was virtually unknown outside a small circle 
of musicologists and students of medieval sacred works. Since then, 
the ensemble has recorded nearly all of Hildegard's extant music for 
the Deutsche Harmonia Mundi label, including two versions of ``Ordo 
Virtutum.'' When Sequentia offered its production again last summer, 
at the Lincoln Center Festival, it was a popular draw, and one of 
at least three versions of the work presented in New York City this 
year. Ms. Thornton was born in Summit, N.J., and graduated from Sarah 
Lawrence College. During a tour with the Sarah Lawrence European Chorus 
in the early 1970's, she decided to continue her studies in Europe, 
and coached in the operatic repertory with teachers in Amsterdam, 
Zurich and Cremona, Italy. Her growing interest in early music led 
her to Basel, Switzerland, where she enrolled at the Schola Cantorum 
Basiliensis, from which she received an advanced diploma in performance 
practice in 1977. She met Bagby, a singer and medieval harpist, in 
Basel in 1974, and started Sequentia with him in 1977. Like many early-music 
ensembles, Sequentia expanded and contracted as the music required, 
sometimes using solo voices and a single accompanying instrument, 
sometimes drawing on a men's choir, the Sons of Thunder; a women's 
choir, Vox Feminae, and medieval harps, strings, flutes and hurdy-gurdy. 
Ms. Thornton often wrote program notes for Sequentia's performances 
and recordings. Besides its Hildegard series, the group recorded three 
disks of sacred works from Spanish monasteries _ including the ``Codex 
las Huelgas'' and works composed for King Alfonso X (``El Sabio'') 
_ as well as several collections of courtly love songs and a compilation 
of sacred and secular works by Oswald von Wolkenstein, a knight, poet 
and composer who straddled the 14th and 15th centuries. She is survived 
by Bagby, her companion; her parents, Fletcher and Margaret Thornton 
of Exeter, N.H., and two sisters, Susan Frey Starbuck of Seattle, 
and Anne Thornton Bridges of Woodstock, Vt.
