Top congressional leaders are split over what to do about Iraq. Republican 
senator John McCain of Arizona says, if Iraq is willing to fully cooperate 
with weapons inspections, the United States should not attack. His 
GOP colleague Richard Lugar disagrees. The Indiana senator says the 
U.S. should attack, regardless. He predicts it will take U.S. ground 
troops in Iraq to get rid of Saddam hussein.
