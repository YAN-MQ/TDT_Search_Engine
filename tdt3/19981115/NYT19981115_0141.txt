There was one Red Holzman who was barely mentioned and certainly not 
eulogized in the newspapers this weekend, or Sunday at the Parkside 
Memorial Chapel in Forest Hills, Queens. This Holzman was not considered 
the architect of New York's most sophisticated sports team, or, as 
Dave Checketts lovingly called him, the ``patriarch of the Knicks.'' 
This Holzman seldom inspired his troops to ``see the ball,'' or the 
game of basketball as a means of joyful collective expression. This 
Holzman won no championships, no playoff games. This Holzman, the 
one I knew best, was still remarkably true to his core, faithful to 
his employer, loyal to his players, even those who deserved less. 
None of those whom Holzman coached during his so-called comeback years, 
1978 to 1982, were in the chapel on Sunday to hear Checketts, the 
president of Madison Square Garden, deify Holzman in a quivering voice. 
``A great coach who forced his will on a group of players,'' Checketts 
said, with a nod to those who lifted the level of their sport and 
united once more to carry their old coach in his coffin, to the hearse, 
on the way to his eternal rest. There was no need to mention names. 
No one could confuse Ray Williams with Earl Monroe, Sly Williams with 
Dick Barnett. Holzman, who returned to the bench after an absence 
of one season plus 14 games, never publicly complained about what 
he had come back to. Never compared a single player to those they 
couldn't measure up to the championship past. Never distanced himself 
to protect the luminous standing he had earned. ``Red played the game 
with the hand he was dealt, and never once said, `Why me?''' said 
Norman Blass, his longtime friend. Blass was talking about the leukemia 
that finally claimed Holzman last Friday night at the age of 78. Same 
idea. Holzman jumped at the offer of Sonny Werblin, the Checketts 
of his time, to replace Willis Reed. He never worried if he could 
make himself look good. The No. 1 draft pick that year was a mercurial 
guard named Michael Ray Richardson. Reed had put him right in the 
lineup, but that wasn't Holzman's way. He harnessed the kid's mistake-ridden 
game by sitting him down. One night in Cleveland, a furious Richardson 
called a couple of reporters over to his locker following another 
night on the bench. ``This old man doesn't want to play me,'' Richardson 
stammered, loudly. ``I'm calling my agent, tell him to get me out 
of here. Print it.'' Richardson didn't see Holzman a few feet behind 
him, shaking his head. ``Know what the funny thing is?'' Holzman hissed, 
as I passed him by. ``He thinks you're going to help him.'' ``Things 
had started to change about then,'' Butch Beard said Sunday out on 
Queens Boulevard, after serving as pall bearer with Reed and the rest. 
``But Red was so good at what he did, and he truly believed the only 
way to win was to have the players learn to motivate themselves.'' 
Beard played some point guard for Holzman in the mid-1970s, then retired 
in a huff himself when he suspected Reed was about to cut him, a few 
days before Reed was fired. Beard got home from the barber shop in 
Louisville one afternoon and found a message from Holzman. ``Come 
back and be my assistant,'' said Holzman. The returning coach was 
more accustomed to working by himself, in the years before the invention 
of the clipboard. But, yes, the changes in the average player had 
come, certainly to the Garden. From the time Holzman's championship 
Knicks had ruled the town, New York as a sports city had become perceptibly 
meaner, as well. Steinbrenner had risen. Murdoch had a newspaper. 
The big-money era in which athletes, as Checketts said, were seen 
as ``assets and pawns'' was born. It wasn't as easy for a company 
man to hold the line. Players, reporters and even some owners didn't 
want to hear it anymore. ``I can tell you that he was the fairest 
guy I've ever seen, always honest, and you just don't see that anymore,'' 
Beard said. In 1980-81, Holzman took an athletically gifted team out 
of training camp. It happened to be an all-black team, an organizational 
first. ``I said, `Red, do you know what you're doing here?''' Beard 
said. ``He said, `I don't care if they're red, black or green. They're 
the best we have.''' That team won 50 games and along the way, Werblin 
gave Holzman a 10-year contract, with the right to become general 
manager _ at Eddie Donovan's expense _ along the way. One day when 
the team was in Denver, Werblin slipped me the details of this deal 
by phone. At dinner that night, I sidled up to Holzman, after we had 
both had a couple of drinks, and said, in a singsong, ``I know something 
you don't want me to.'' He snorted and said, ``Yeah, what?'' Though 
his lips were always sealed, this was one company secret he didn't 
mind getting out. Holzman had resented Donovan's conspiring to replace 
him with Reed two years before. When it was said Sunday that this 
was a man without ego, no one would deny he had fierce pride. As it 
turned out, Holzman never got to be general manager; he didn't last 
long as coach. A trade or two didn't work out. The following season, 
the Knicks lost 49. Those troubled young players never did learn to 
motivate themselves. And on the last day that season, knowing he was 
as good as gone, Holzman was asked if he wished to say something about 
a team that had, essentially, given up. Had cost him the life style 
he loved. ``Not now, it's too close,'' he said. ``Maybe I'll say something 
soon.'' Holzman looked away, then back with his trademark sly grin. 
``Probably not,'' he said, softly. He never lowered his standard, 
never did knock a player. Never will.
