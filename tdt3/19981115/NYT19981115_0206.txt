When Harold Bloom was 15, he saw the Old Vic perform ``Henry IV, Part 
1'' on Broadway. Ralph Richardson played Falstaff and Laurence Olivier 
was Hotspur (doubling in ``Henry IV, Part 2'' as Justice Shallow). 
To this day, Bloom has no recollection of who played Prince Hal (it 
was Michael Warre), but seeing Richardson was, for him, a transcendent 
experience. Although he had already read many of the plays, that performance 
began his lifelong love for Shakespeare and in particular for the 
character of Falstaff. That love culminates 52 years later in ``Shakespeare: 
The Invention of the Human'' (Riverhead Books). ``The book is in a 
sense a tribute to what Richardson did to me,'' Bloom said in a recent 
interview. This is his 23rd book and the one, he said, on which his 
reputation ultimately will rest. In the intervening years, Falstaff 
has become Bloom's alter ego. A man of comparable girth and outrageousness 
_ intellectual and linguistic as well as corporeal _ he looks like 
Falstaff, or, rather, like the actor Charles Laughton might have looked 
in that role. In antic moments, this polymathic professor and literary 
critic refers to himself as Sir John Bloomstaff, enthusiastically 
accepting any twinning of the two, even warming to a friend's notion 
that the real author of ``The Invention of the Human'' is Falstaff. 
One fully expects him to sprinkle his conversation with ``Zounds!'' 
In characteristic Bloom fashion, the book is voluminous, idiosyncratic 
and dutifully unscholarly, with no footnotes and not even an index. 
He wants it ``to be useful to common readers and common playgoers'' 
and not to those academics that he scathingly criticizes. ``I don't 
want a single person, with a few honorable exceptions, who ostensibly 
teach Shakespeare to even look at the book. They're hideous ideologues, 
pseudo Marxists, pseudo feminists, pseudo historicists and disciples 
of Foucault,'' ending his list of enemies with the French philosopher. 
In contrast, Bloom regards himself as a man without ideology, as ``a 
pure esthete.'' ``I care about Shakespeare,'' he said, ``because he 
not only meets the highest esthetic and cognitive standards, he sets 
our esthetic and cognitive standards.'' In conversation as in the 
book, he is filled with highly opinionated, often injudicious comments, 
like his suggestion that ``King John'' is a better play than ``Richard 
III.'' Comparing Shakespeare to contemporary politics, he says that 
Newt Gingrich is a parody of Gratiano in ``The Merchant of Venice,'' 
while Kenneth Starr is ``Polonius on the outside, Iago on the inside.'' 
About Hamlet, he said: ``He is a coldblooded fellow who winds up loving 
absolutely no one. He simply is the most intelligent character in 
any work of literature I've ever read.'' About Rosalind, the love 
of his Shakespearean life, he has no reservations: ``She's wholly 
normative _ a miracle of healthiness, good sense, lovability.'' For 
Bloom, Falstaff is not the taproom roustabout who leads Prince Hal 
astray, but a quintessential lover of life and a man of great wit 
and acumen. ``I like him because he is alive beyond belief,'' he said, 
quoting the character's line ``Give me life,'' and adding, ``How often 
have I said to a friend, `Before I knew thee ... I knew nothing and 
now am I, if a man should speak truly, little better than one of the 
wicked'?'' This was a case of Falstaff's turning the tables on Prince 
Hal, suggesting that it was Hal who had corrupted Falstaff. On the 
Bloom-scape, Hal is not a hero but a ``charming villain.'' Bloom follows 
with a characteristically sweeping statement, ``No king is a good 
guy, except for poor Lear.'' Among the saddest lines in Shakespeare, 
of course, is Hal's regal snub of Falstaff, ``I know thee not, old 
man.'' Mr. Bloom seems to take that statement personally. Because 
the book deals in detail with his favorite Shakespearean characters, 
in addition to Falstaff and Rosalind, Hamlet, Cleopatra, Iago and 
Edmund the Bastard, as well as his favorite plays (``Henry IV,'' ``Twelfth 
Night,'' ``Antony and Cleopatra''), he thought about calling it ``The 
Characters of Shakespeare's Plays,'' borrowing the title from a work 
by William Hazlitt. Then he decided that ``The Invention of the Human'' 
was more specific and more comprehensive, although to those unfamiliar 
with Bloom, it might sound Frankensteinian rather than Bloomstaffian. 
Explaining the title, he said that with writers before Shakespeare 
_ with the exception of Chaucer _ characters did not change inwardly: 
``I think our kind of inwardness, which really means our sense of 
personality, is a Shakespearean invention. He more than prefigured 
our humanity, its quandaries and dilemmas. Shakespeare so deeply pervades 
not just Western culture but by now, so far as I can tell, all the 
world's culture.'' And wherever his plays are done ``even people who 
are not overwhelmingly literate recognize themselves and feel that 
Shakespeare has put them on the stage.'' He is amazed not only at 
Shakespeare's productivity, ``39 plays of which 24 or 25 are in every 
way masterworks,'' but also that no one else ``has had so powerful, 
fecund and inventive a mind, such a control of language and mastery 
of human psychology.'' He continued: ``As Bottom says of his dreams, 
the plays are bottomless. The miracle of Shakespeare is that he is 
all this and he's also a popular entertainer. His plays sold out in 
his day, and they will always sell out.'' Steadfastly, Bloom maintains 
that Shakespeare's characters are capable of change, even a villain 
like Edmund in ``King Lear.'' This, he said, was revolutionary in 
drama, and altered the perception of human behavior. Asked how he 
himself had changed over the years, Bloom spoke about the shifts in 
his role as a scholar and writer: ``I began as a fierce Romantic revivalist 
of Blake and Shelley, in particular, pushing aside T.S. Eliot and 
the New Critics as they were then called. They seemed to be a kind 
of neo-Christian cabal.'' In his ``middle phase,'' starting with his 
1973 book, ``The Anxiety of Influence,'' he became preoccupied with 
the question of literary influence. In 1990, with ``The Book of J,'' 
he began his third, religious phase. With ``The Western Canon,'' his 
territory was all of Western literature. At the end of that book was 
a greatly disputed list of the most valuable works of literature. 
Now he says: ``You don't need a list. All you need is Shakespeare.'' 
Bloom's ``Shakespeare'' has been nominated for a National Book Award, 
but as is often the case with his work it has received a mixed critical 
reception. A review in The New Yorker said it made more sense ``as 
an enraptured, incantatory epic than as a courteous explication of 
the plays.'' At the beginning of the interview, Bloom announced that 
he had not read that entire review, but within minutes he was quoting 
from it: ``He said that for those who like me, I was a Prospero of 
criticism waving his wand; and for my detractors, I was nothing but 
a baffled and superannuated old Lear.'' Tossed between ``The Tempest'' 
and ``King Lear,'' naturally he would prefer Falstaff. Even though 
it was a performance that turned Bloom into a Shakespearean, with 
rare exceptions (Brian Bedford, Ian McKellen) actors are not high 
on his list as interpreters. Nor are directors. He called Peter Brook's 
historic gymnastic production of ``A Midsummer's Night Dream'' ``a 
disaster,'' a word he ecumenically applies to Kenneth Branagh ``in 
general.'' And he said he walked out on Ralph Fiennes' ``Hamlet'' 
because he thought that the actor played it as if ``he were a poor, 
spoiled little rich boy.'' Bloom insists that he wants better productions, 
but his theatrical visits have been sporadic and exclusionary. He 
added with evident pride, ``I missed as many performances as I could, 
after a certain point.'' He is completely dismissive of several Shakespearean 
plays, beginning with ``Titus Andronicus,'' saying he does not want 
to see it again unless it is spoofed by Mel Brooks. One of many innovative 
productions that he did not see was Deborah Warner's version at Stratford-on-Avon. 
It stressed not the play's grotesquerie but its heightened sense of 
reality, turning Titus into a peasant warrior. Nor did Bloom see Sam 
Mendes' version of ``Troilus and Cressida,'' or Peter Brook's ``Timon 
of Athens,'' which illuminated the play through the prism of the modern 
liberal dilemma: Timon as an easy mark. In each case, a director shed 
new light on a problem play. Bloom also missed Robert Stephens' authoritative 
portrayal of Falstaff in Adrian Noble's 1992 production at Stratford-on-Avon. 
As always, Bloom emphasizes the text. Growing up in the Bronx in a 
Yiddish-speaking family, he taught himself to read English before 
he was 5. An omnivorous speed reader, he could cover 500 pages in 
an hour, he said, and also has a prodigious memory. For the last 34 
years, he has been teaching at Yale (and concurrently at New York 
University), and for the last 20 years he has been teaching Shakespeare: 
``I told the very amiable current president of Yale that I intend 
to be carried out of my last Yale class in a body bag, hopefully many 
years down the road.'' In their home in New Haven, Conn., he and his 
wife, Jeanne, ``drown in books,'' some 60,000 with thousands more 
in his two Yale offices. His next book, a change of pace, will be 
a slim volume entitled ``How to Read and Why.'' Because of his affinity 
for Shakespeare, he was asked if he would have preferred to have lived 
during the Elizabethan Age. He answered in the negative: ``Obviously 
if one is Jewish, it is better to be alive in either 19th- or 20th-century 
America than anywhere else in human history. I will settle for having 
been born in 1930 in the East Bronx. Transpose me back to some other 
period, and I'm in trouble.'' But, were he to time-travel, he might 
find Falstaff in a pub lifting a tankard. Was there, in fact, a real 
Falstaff? ``Yes,'' he said. ``William Shakespeare, himself. The fat 
man was inside the skinny fellow. There was more of Shakespeare in 
Falstaff than in Hamlet, or in Rosalind.'' Bloom's idea of Arcadia 
is the Forest of Arden in ``As You Like It.'' His voice brimmed with 
emotion as he merged with his favorite character and recounted Bloomstaff's 
Dream: ``To be Sir John Falstaff, not rejected in dead of grief, but 
still boisterous and sitting on a tree stump in the Forest of Arden, 
trying to outfox Rosalind.''
