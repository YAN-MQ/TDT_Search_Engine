It's a good time for pork chop lovers. Prices are down, supplies are 
way up, but that has farmers in the midwest very worried. Ceci Rogers 
explains. Conditions are a little tough right now. John Kellogg is 
losing money on every one of his 8,000 pigs. I'd say we're losing 
$30 to $35 per pig that we produce. Pork prices are the lowest in 
30 years, under 20 cents a pound. It's simply the law of supply and 
demand. Demand is down, in part due to slumping economies overseas. 
Supply is up 10% it was only two years ago that hog prices soared 
to record highs. That encouraged hog farmers to increase production 
as fast as they could. But then boom turned to bust and farmers are 
stuck with hogs that nobody wants. The crisis has pork producers pleading 
with grocers to lower retail prices. Prices at the meat counter have 
been falling, but much more slowly than on the farm. We need to move 
product, that's the bottom line. We've got large supplies of pork 
available today and we need to move it through. But analysts say lowering 
prices at the stores might not help, since consumers tend to buy about 
the same amount of pork, regardless of price swings. What needs to 
happen, they say, is for the market to thin out on its own. Ceci Rogers,
