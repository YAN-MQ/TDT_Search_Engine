Its history is filled with triumph, its members have braved brutal 
Russian winters. They have stopped advancing armies led by Napoleon 
and Hitler. But today's Russian army isn't quite what it used to be. 
Some of its soldiers are still growing up. From Moscow, the soldiers 
of misfortune. Graduation day for a Russian anti-chemical warfare 
battalion. But Alexander rogozin is not a typical Russian solider. 
He is a member of a special platoon of 11 to 14-year-olds wandering 
no more as homeless children in the nearby community, but now marching 
as soldiers in the Russian army. "Here we'll become good men," he 
says, "before were just hooligans." In Russia new recruits are scarce. 
Grown men increasingly refuse to answer the mandatory draft. Now, 
a neglected army is taking in neglected children. "When they arrived 
here they were like wolf cubs. Now they've become softer, kinder," 
says commander. The problem is staggering. There are 2 million kids 
in Russia living on the streets, sniffing glue, stealing. As Russia's 
economic crisis has deepened in the last two months, a 50% increase 
in the number of children in this Moscow Shelter -- new ones almost 
every day. Director Sergei solomin -- The economic situation in the 
country has changed. If the mother is the only working member of the 
family, she physically can't support her own child. 14-year-old Sasha 
has been in the Shelter for six months. Says he'd join the army thinking 
it's a route to a better future. But international agencies condemn 
any move by the army to take children off the streets. The job they 
say should be done by social workers, not generals. Putting children 
in the army is not the solution. What we need is a social net. And 
the social net doesn't exist. There's been a tradition in the Russian 
army to care for the orphans of soldiers. 10,000 children live and 
study on Russian military bases. But only recently have kids slipped 
into official army uniforms never designed to camouflage age. Boy 
soldiers in from the cold but still in harms way. Dana Lewis, NBC 
news, Moscow.
