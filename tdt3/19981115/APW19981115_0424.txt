A drunken guest shot and killed his ex-girlfriend and her parents 
at a wedding party in eastern Serbia following a bitter quarrel, the 
Beta news agency reported Sunday. Bojan Andjelkovic, 22, used a shotgun 
to kill Slavomir and Slavica Aleksic and their 18-year-old daughter 
in the town of Bor on Saturday, the report said. Andjelkovic got into 
an argument with the family over his earlier affair with Marija, the 
report said, and was beaten up by Marija's brother Milan. He returned 
with the shotgun and killed the parents in a parking lot and Marija 
inside. Other guests restrained him when he tried to reload the shotgun 
to kill Milan, according to Beta. Andjelkovic was then arrested.
