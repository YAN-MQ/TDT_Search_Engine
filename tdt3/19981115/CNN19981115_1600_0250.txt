Iraq denies the threat of military action prompted its offer to resume 
cooperation with U.N. weapons inspections. Iraqi deputy foreign minister 
Tariq Aziz tells CNN it was the appeal of "Friends" that resulted 
in Baghdad reversing its position. Aziz adds he believes weapons inspections 
are still linked to a timetable of lifting the sanctions imposed on 
Iraq following the gulf war. He says the arms inspectors can resume 
work immediately. My letter yesterday is very clear. They can return 
to Iraq any time they wish. They can perform the normal work.
