Iraqi defiance leads to a U.S. military buildup, then to a last-minute 
diplomatic solution. Saddam Hussein's small neighbor has repeatedly 
lived this scenario _ and feared its consequences _ since the Gulf 
War. But this time around, very few seem to be alarmed or even bothered. 
``People are sick of this song and dance,'' said Masouma al-Mubarak, 
who teaches political science at Kuwait University. ``They want a 
solution, an end to this situation with Saddam as a source of tension 
in the area.'' In February, during the last crisis between Iraq and 
the United Nations, Kuwaitis stocked up on food and water. Some sealed 
rooms against a possible retaliatory Iraqi attack with chemical or 
biological weapons. Some even bought gas masks. ``We got used to this,'' 
Jamal al-Naki, a 40-year-old Kuwaiti, explained as he selected fresh 
vegetables at a supermarket. He was not buying anything extra. Al-Naki 
echoed some newspapers in calling for vengeance against Iraqi President 
Saddam Hussein over his army's invasion of Kuwait in 1990. ``This 
time they will get him. He will be their target,'' al-Naki told The 
Associated Press. And columnist Fouad al-Hashem, anticipating an attack, 
wrote in the Sunday edition of the daily Al-Watan: ``Saddam, his family, 
his cronies and his Baath Party will have dug their own graves. We 
will shovel dirt on them and their history.'' For most Kuwaitis though, 
the most recent threat of airstrikes against Iraq concerned them less 
than their soccer team's performance in the Gulf cup. They won. As 
more American soldiers prepared to deploy to the region Friday, young 
Kuwaitis danced in the streets and waved flags to greet the returning 
champions. Around 1,500 U.S. soldiers are in Kuwait training in the 
desert or maintaining equipment prepositioned to protect the country. 
On Sunday, the Cabinet was informed of contingency plans should there 
be airstrikes on Iraq, but the plans were not made public. The country's 
tiny military is on alert, but a Defense Ministry spokesman told the 
AP the measure was ``precautionary.'' Officials have urged Iraq to 
rescind its decision to halt cooperation with U.N. arms inspectors 
but have made it a point to stay out of any confrontation. Defense 
Minister Sheik Salem al-Sabah said last week that Kuwait was ``not 
a party'' to the tensions. Some U.S. Embassy families have made plans 
to depart, but there are no signs of widespread panic among Kuwait's 
8,000 American residents, who were advised to consider leaving by 
the State Department. Still, the Kuwaitis' public nonchalance has 
brought one warning _ from a columnist for a pro-government daily. 
``This repeated heating and cooling should not become like the famous 
`cry wolf' story,'' wrote Sami al-Nisf. ``We should not take it easy 
because nothing has happened in the past, only to be caught unprepared.''
