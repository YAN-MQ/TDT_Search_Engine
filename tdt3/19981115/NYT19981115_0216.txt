To understand the labor dispute between ABC and its union of 2,200 
off-camera workers, grab the remote control and click. Now click again. 
And again. It is the proliferation of cable channels and new television 
networks, staffed by free-lance and other non-union technicians, that 
is driving the wedge between the network and its largest union, the 
National Association of Broadcast Engineers and Technicians. With 
media competition increasingly intense and new technology cutting 
the number of people needed to produce programs, broadcast and labor 
experts said the current standoff could trigger a shift in how television 
crews are organized. ``The world is not the same as it used to be,'' 
said Christopher Dixon, a media analyst for Paine Webber. ``The normal 
day-to-day of producing, manufacturing and distributing television 
has changed dramatically.'' After two weeks of noisy picketing in 
New York and four other cities _ Chicago, Los Angeles, San Francisco 
and Washington _ as well as boycotts of the network by some politicians 
and celebrities, the two sides await a ruling from the National Labor 
Relations Board on whether ABC's refusal to provide certain information 
about its health care plan to the union constitutes an unfair labor 
practice. But broader, more fundamental differences remain over how 
many temporary workers should be allowed, and control over certain 
jobs and machines. Ultimately, participants on both sides say, the 
crucial issues are competitiveness and job security. ``ABC, CBS and 
NBC no longer have a virtual oligopoly, and the oligopoly was the 
largest reason the union could be so powerful,'' said Stanley Aronowitz, 
a sociologist at the City University Graduate Center. ``It's a changed 
culture. You have schools of communication turning out technicians 
like popcorn.'' Julie Hoover, a spokeswoman for ABC, said the network 
needed a contract with its union of editors, engineers and camera 
operators more like the one such workers have with NBC and CBS. That 
means allowing raising the level of daily hires for temporary jobs 
to 35 percent or 40 percent rather than the current 14 percent, and 
taking advantage of computerized editing machines, for example, that 
let writers produce their own station promotions. ``The real issue 
is that ABC has the most expensive, most restrictive contract in the 
industry,'' Ms. Hoover said. ``We want more flexibility and more opportunities 
to control costs.'' But it is that competition that scares many union 
members. ``Too many people don't have any security anymore,'' said 
Yolanda Rodriguez, an ABC tape operator and editor. ``These people 
are so hungry, they're willing to take our jobs.'' After 19 months 
of working without a contract, the union staged a one-day strike on 
Nov. 2, timed to disrupt ``Monday Night Football'' and election news 
coverage. The network responded by refusing to let the employees back 
to work unless they agreed to give advance warning of any future strikes 
_ 72 hours for in-studio broadcasts, two weeks for programs on the 
road. While such requests are common in a time-sensitive business 
like broadcasting, notification would undercut the union's power by 
severely diluting the impact of any job action. With the lockout, 
ABC and its parent, the Walt Disney Company, are using an increasingly 
popular hardball tactic intended to reduce labor's leverage by proving 
employers can operate with temporary workers. But it is also a gamble: 
if courts rule the lockout illegal, ABC could be ordered to pay the 
workers back wages, plus interest. That decision, however, often takes 
months, or even years. Meanwhile, workers collect only $200 a week 
from their union for walking the picket line. ``The company's strategy 
is to push them out of the driver's seat,'' said Tom Juravich, director 
of the Labor Center at the University of Massachusetts at Amherst. 
``It's very difficult, once one is outside, to leverage back in.'' 
ABC is paying bonuses to its own employees and hiring temporary workers 
to keep programs on the air. Most technical glitches have been invisible 
to the average viewer, but Whoopi Goldberg, Tony Bennett and Adam 
Sandler, along with many Democratic politicians, have refused to appear 
on the network. The White House has refused to give the network any 
exclusives, and Vice President Al Gore canceled an interview earlier 
this month with ``Good Morning America.'' ``Lockouts often blow up 
in the employer's face,'' warned Kate Bronfenbrenner, director of 
labor-relations research at Cornell University. ``The support of the 
public is much greater when workers are saying, `We want to work _ 
they won't let us work.''' So far, Wall Street analysts say the lockout 
has had little financial impact, in part because ABC is only a tiny 
part of Disney's operations. With its famous fat salaries for top 
executives _ Michael Ovitz recently received an estimated $140 million 
to leave the company _ Disney, which bought ABC in 1996, has been 
the target of much of the union's ire. Outside ABC's headquarters 
on the Upper West Side of Manhattan, workers have hung a Mickey Mouse 
doll from a noose. Disney has long been unionized, though relations 
are sometimes contentious. Unions at Disney World in Orlando, Fla., 
are in negotiations with the company over health-care concerns, and 
workers at Euro Disney in France spent a month on strike this summer. 
Ms. Hoover, the ABC spokeswoman, said the new ownership did not change 
the network's commitment to working with the technicians' union and 
its 19 other unions. Last week, she noted, a union representing 500 
stagehands reached an agreement with ABC for a new four-year contract. 
But the future may depend just as much on what happens to independent 
contractors working on small cable programs as it does on the big 
three networks and their unions. ``The underlying issue here is the 
dramatic changes in the broadcast industry,'' said Greg Tarpinian, 
a union consultant. ``In the long run, they will have to organize 
all the nonunion operations or else lose their bargaining clout.''
