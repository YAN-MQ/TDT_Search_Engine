France's Environment Minister appealed to the government Sunday to 
give residency permits to illegal immigrants, saying it was a ``humane 
solution'' to the problem. Dominique Voynet spoke at a national assembly 
of the Greens two days after police ended a 73-day sit-in by illegal 
immigrants who were demanding the government reconsider their residency 
permits. The French government has legalized the status of some 76,000 
illegal immigrants but has rejected residency requested for more than 
64,000 others. The Greens want the Socialist-led government to provide 
residency status for all of illegal immigrants, who in French are 
called ``sans papiers'' or those without papers. Prime Minister Lionel 
Jospin has been more generous in granting residency permits to illegal 
immigrants than the previous conservative government. But the far 
right National Front, which blames high unemployment on immigrants, 
has accused Jospin of being too soft on the issue.
