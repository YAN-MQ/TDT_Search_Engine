KUALA LUMPUR, Malaysia (AP) _ U.S. Secretary of State Madeleine Albright 
indicated Sunday that there have been some positive developments in 
the U.S. standoff with Iraq. The United States has stood poised for 
several days to attack Iraq, after rejecting a letter from Iraqi leader 
Saddam Hussein in which he agreed to resume U.N. weapons inspections. 
``We consider the first letter as unacceptable,'' she told reporters 
at the end of a meeting with Cabinet ministers from the Asia-Pacific 
Economic Cooperation forum. ``Since this, there have been additional 
statements and some discussion of significance,'' she said. ``All 
options remain on the table, but we are very carefully assessing some 
recent new developments.'' She refused to be more specific. She met 
Sunday with Chinese, Japanese and Canadian officials to discuss the 
events in Iraq. Tokyo said it supported the U.S. position, but was 
hoping for a peaceful resolution. China, however, refused to back 
U.S. military action, and said it was only willing to urge Iraq to 
reconsider its actions and cooperate with the U.N. weapons inspectors. 
Igor Ivanov, the Russian minister of foreign affairs, said Moscow 
did not support ``unilateral action.'' ``There's a good prospect that 
there is a political way out of this situation,'' Ivanov said. ``We 
should continue to work in a coordinated way.'' Albright, who arrived 
in Malaysia late Saturday to attend a summit meeting on Asia's economic 
crisis, spent the night discussing the U.S.-Iraq standoff on the telephone 
with top American, U.N. and European officials. State Department officials 
said she would cut her scheduled three-day visit short and head back 
to Washington Sunday night. ``Time and again, Iraq has promised to 
come into compliance and then broken that promise,'' Albright said 
in a speech to the APEC trade and foreign ministers. During the first 
of her bilateral meetings, Albright told her Chinese counterpart, 
Tang Jiaxuan, that Iraq must back down. Tang agreed that Saddam was 
responsible for the current crisis, according to State Department 
spokesman James P. Rubin. However, Tang told reporters afterward that 
China would not support the use of force against Iraq. ``The Chinese 
government is absolutely against the use of force,'' he said. ``This 
is a very clear stand on this issue. It is pointless to use force 
to resolve the current situation. The use of force only results in 
making things complicated, and will make things worse.'' Tang said 
his government had sent a letter to Iraq urging its government to 
``think carefully'' and restart talks immediately with U.N. weapons 
inspectors. Albright used her meetings with APEC officials to emphasize 
that Saddam's offer to allow the inspectors to resume their inspections 
contained too many conditions, said Rubin. An Iraqi letter, addressed 
to U.N. Secretary-General Kofi Annan, linked a resumption of inspections 
with ``a further chance to achieve justice by lifting sanctions'' 
that the world imposed on Iraq after its 1990 invasion of Kuwait. 
Rubin said Albright also would use her visit to Malaysia to discuss 
the Asian economic crisis and to meet with the wife of former Deputy 
Prime Minister Anwar Ibrahim, who was fired, then jailed and put on 
trial after launching a reform movement opposing the leadership of 
Prime Minister Mahathir Mohamad. ``I think the Malaysian government 
will understand the significance of her (Albright) choosing that meeting,'' 
Rubin said, adding that the secretary of state was not expected to 
hold any private meetings with the Malaysian government. ``We are 
here to discuss issues that APEC brought to Malaysia, not the specifics 
of relations with Malaysia,'' Rubin said. U.S. President Bill Clinton, 
who canceled his plan to travel to the APEC summit because of the 
Iraq crisis, had not planned to meet with Mahathir either because 
of U.S. concerns over Malaysia's treatment of Anwar. The former official 
claims he was severely beaten by prison guards when he was incarcerated 
before his trial. Albright's plan to meet with Anwar's wife, Azizah 
Ismail, drew strong rebukes Saturday from her Malaysian counterpart, 
Abdullah Ahmad Badawi, who said Albright ``should not interfere in 
Malaysia's affairs.'' The secretary of state's meeting with Azizah 
was intended to express concern about ``the treatment of Anwar, the 
mistreatment in prison and the importance we attach to due process 
during the trial,'' Rubin said.
