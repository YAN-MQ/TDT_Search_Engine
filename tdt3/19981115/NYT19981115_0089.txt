In moonshots heard throughout cyberspace, the stocks of two newly 
public companies soared last week as investors once again rushed to 
buy up the promise of the Internet. Small investors, especially those 
glued to their computer screens, pushed the prices of many Internet 
stocks to levels that not only seemed to defy gravity but also common 
sense. The two latest arrivals were among the biggest beneficiaries 
of the general enthusiasm for anything Internet. The stock of Theglobe.com 
Inc., a New York company that helps people design Web pages, raced 
from its initial offering price of $9, to hit $97, before closing 
on Friday at $63.50. Its astounding 606 percent gain marked the best 
first-day performance for any initial public offering, excluding the 
tiniest offerings, according to the Securities Data Co. in Newark, 
N.J. Its performance was more than twice that of any other new stock. 
Theglobe's spectacular debut followed an earlier display by another 
fledgling Internet outfit, Earthweb Inc., which gained 247 percent 
on Wednesday, its first day of trading. Its stock closed on Friday 
at $67, nearly five times its initial offering price. ``The valuations 
being ascribed to these very young companies make almost no sense,'' 
said Lise Buyer, an analyst at Credit Suisse First Boston, who likens 
the current frenzy over the Internet to the mania for tulips in Holland 
during the 1600s. Theglobe.com, for example, now has a market value 
of $622 million, despite the fact that it had $11.5 million of losses 
on $2.7 million of revenues for the first nine months of the year. 
The company ``has a debatable business model, and it's a junior Geocities,'' 
said Keith Benjamin, an analyst with BancBoston Robertson Stephens, 
who is concerned by the ability of very small companies to go public 
and find willing buyers for their stocks. Helping propel these stocks 
upward is the limited number of shares being sold in these offerings. 
Theglobe.com, for example, offered only 3.1 million shares. Companies 
offer a small number of shares if they believe a secondary offering, 
with a much higher stock price, can be a source of future capital. 
With demand so great for these stocks, there appears to be a shortage 
of supply. The performance of Theglobe.com ``would never have happened 
if you did not have the Internet feeding frenzy,'' said David Menlow, 
president of IPO Financial Network in Springfield, N.J. Investors 
who are are piling into Internet stocks may believe they are actually 
reducing their risk because they think that these companies will prosper, 
no matter what happens in Asia or Latin America or where interest 
rates are headed. ``In almost a perverse way, Internet stocks have 
become a safe haven for technology stock investors,'' said Jonathan 
Cohen, an analyst at Merrill Lynch, who believes many Internet companies 
do ultimately have great potential. The enthusiasm for Internet stocks 
may also be reawakening interest in the market for initial public 
offerings, which suffered along with the rest of the stock market 
earlier this year when many investors ran from risk. Theglobe.com, 
for example, had postponed its offering last month. But when Earthweb 
was so eagerly received, the underwriters ``ran it up the flagpole,'' 
said John Fitzgibbon, editor of IPO Reporter, a New York newsletter 
on initial offerings, who thinks other companies may also try now 
to go public. And many investors may simply be trying to go along 
for the ride, even if they do not have the benefit of getting the 
stock at its initial offering price. ``If you get in early and sell, 
you will make money,'' said Ms. Buyer of Credit Suisse First Boston. 
The danger is that some investors may not know when to make an exit; 
instead, they may be caught up in a sudden change in market sentiment 
_ and lose money _ while waiting unsuccessfully for a greater fool 
to relieve them of their shares at a profit. ``How long does it go 
on?'' Ms. Buyer asked on the latest Internet frenzy. ``It could go 
on for years. It could go on for hours.'' But, she said, investors 
should realize that they really are taking risks with their money, 
because the stocks of many of these companies could tumble on the 
slightest dose of reality. ``This is not investing,'' she said. ``This 
is speculating.''
