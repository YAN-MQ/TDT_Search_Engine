The earth is only two days away from the Leonid meteor showers. On 
Tuesday, our planet will pass through the tail of the Comet temple-tuttle. 
For about ten hours, millions of tiny particles in the tail will hit 
our atmosphere and burn up. There is concern the particles could damage 
some of the more than 600 satellites in orbit. You have a problem 
with many satellites have solar panels. And so you can think of if 
you're in a very intense sandstorm. These little particles can erode 
away surfaces that shouldn't be eroded away very quickly. But it's 
hard to say how dense the particle stream is going to be, whether 
this kind of sandblasting effect is going to be significant or not. 
The bottom line is, we don't know. The best view of the celestial 
show of light streaks and shooting stars is expected to be over parts 
of Asia.
