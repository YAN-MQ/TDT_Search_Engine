Now new concerns E.concerns about the environment. At the global warming 
summit that ended yesterday, in bonus aries, scientists discussed 
the potential for catastrophe in Alaska. NBC's donnatella lorch tonight. 
Alaska's icy wilderness is melting. It's getting warmer by more than 
half a degree Fahrenheit every decade. Up to 10 times faster than 
anywhere else. They're looking at a very dramatic change that has 
implications for the rest of the world. These changes are unprecedented. 
The trend is permanently transforming the land and affecting the ecosystem. 
The Columbia Glacier has retreated eight miles in 16 years, leaving 
a Litter of ice floating behind it. The frozen ground over which the 
majority of Alaska's forests grow is thawing for the first time in 
125,000 years. If the warming continues, tens of millions of acres 
of forests will turn into marshy swamps. Already, trees are dying 
in the water-logged soil. As buried ice melts, deep holes are opening 
and telegraph poles have to be tethered to stop them from falling 
over. Warm Summers mean increased beetle and insect infestation, killing 
more trees. Now a third of the trees are dead. This happened in just 
the space of two years of outbreaks of beetles. Wild animal herds, 
like the caribou, are declining. Freezing rain is keeping the food 
out of reach under layers of ice. Once again in Alaska this year, 
winter is late. This river should be frozen by now. And as Alaska 
thaws, its wilderness is being steadily destroyed. Donatella lorch, 
NBC news.
