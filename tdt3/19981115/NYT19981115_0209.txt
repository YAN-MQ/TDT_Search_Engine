One of the groups from Artwalk NY, a series of tours through artists' 
studios, shuffled into Michael Brennan's little work space on the 
Bowery. As the visitors settled in, Brennan, 33, gamely tried to explain 
his paintings, rectangles of evenly applied scarlet paint framing 
smaller rectangles of wild brush strokes and dried ridges in blue 
and white. ``If you don't sign the painting, would you be offended 
if I hung it vertically?'' asked Leny Struminger, a computer consultant 
from East Brunswick, N.J. Brennan frowned. ``Yes, I would be,'' he 
replied. ``I don't think there is any artist who doesn't think about 
the top and the bottom of his paintings.'' This lively collision of 
worlds on Saturday captured the spirit of the fourth annual Artwalk 
NY, a three-part fund-raiser. Peter Jennings, the ``ABC Nightly News'' 
anchor, and the actor Matt Dillon presided over lectures and an auction. 
But the walking tours were the centerpiece of the day. In all, 60 
artists _ from the famous, including Chuck Close, Julian Schnabel 
and Jenny Holzer, to the not yet so famous, like Brennan _ either 
donated works or opened their studios. The event was run by the Coalition 
for the Homeless, which raised an estimated $400,000 for its nine 
programs, including food distribution and a summer camp. Last year's 
Artwalk raised $370,000. The day began around 11 a.m. in the Puck 
Building at Lafayette and Houston streets, where the critic Jerry 
Saltz entertained a crowd of about 450 with an opinionated history 
of the art world in the 1980s and '90s. ``Bodily fluids are extremely 
interesting,'' Saltz said, chiding certain artists for their use of 
unconventional media. ``We just have to do more interesting things 
with them.'' Jennings, who was to interview Close onstage after Saltz's 
speech, was sitting in the audience when he received an urgent page. 
``The White House is skeptical,'' he whispered, referring to negotiations 
with President Saddam Hussein of Iraq that morning. ``But it would 
be difficult for me to be pulled away from this for too long.'' Then 
he took the stage and spent the next 45 minutes questioning Close, 
58, who is celebrated for his large-scale portraits and admired for 
his fortitude in facing an illness that left him partly paralyzed 
in mid-career and forced him to invent new ways to make his art. ``Are 
you surprised that you are still painting heads?'' Jennings asked 
at one point. Close replied in his typical deadpan: ``I never thought 
I would find it as satisfying as it has been. Of all the variables 
that I could alter in my work, the one that was the least interesting 
was the subject. Keeping the heads has kept me engaged with everything 
else.'' After the interview, the crowd broke up into groups of about 
15 and began to go on the art walks. These were 2{-hour walking tours 
of the studios of 40 artists around the city, including Mark Kostabi, 
Kate Shepherd, Alice Aycock, Pat Steir, Louis Mendez and Vito Acconci. 
The walkers, some led by experts and some on their own, visited three 
studios each. In many cases, the artists were present to answer questions. 
The group that visited Brennan's studio was led by Lucas Schoormans, 
an art dealer out of central casting, complete with a German accent 
and a black turtleneck. In addition to Brennan's Bowery studio, Schoormans 
took his group to the TriBeCa home of Antonio Murado, a Spaniard who 
fills canvases with loops made without lifting his brush off the canvas, 
and the SoHo studio of Bing Wright, who makes collages of photographs 
of water and flowers, as well as photos of wet windowpanes. Participants 
said it was an unusual experience for the artists and for their guests. 
Ms. Aycock, whose studio loft is also her home, said it had been a 
tiring but rewarding day. ``I don't know how politicians do it,'' 
she said after being visited by three different tours. ``You had to 
speak to people on all levels.'' The long day ended on a sumptuous 
note as about 1,000 people roamed the Puck Building, grazing on treats 
provided by 15 restaurants including Barocco, Alison on Dominick and 
Le Bernardin. They also spent thousands of dollars at an auction conducted 
by Christopher Burge, the chairman of Christie's. The most expensive 
lot was ``Phil,'' a 1998 Polaroid portrait, mounted on aluminum, of 
Philip Glass by Close which fetched $26,000. Close, who earlier in 
the day had likened attending auctions of his work to watching cows 
go to slaughter, had already gone home.
