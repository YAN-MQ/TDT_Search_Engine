Japan has pledged to help build school buildings in the Philippines, 
which is suffering from a serious shortage, officials said Sunday. 
In some rural areas, public elementary and high school teachers now 
hold classes in the shade of trees or in churches. The government 
projects that the country would lack more than 21,500 classrooms this 
year, up from last year's 14,615 rooms, officials said. The Japan 
International Cooperation Agency has committed to fund the construction 
of 89 of the 630 school buildings the government plans to build nationwide 
in the next six years, a government statement said. JICA oversees 
foreign projects funded by the Japan. Construction of the 89 schools 
is to begin in March. Despite its economic woes, Japan has continued 
to provide grants to the Philippines, an important Asian trading partner.
