Good evening. In Iraq tonight, it is back to square one again. Plans 
for a military strike against Iraq have been put on hold, and United 
Nations weapons inspectors are scheduled to go back to work. But in 
the gulf, the military buildup continues. And in Washington, there 
is plenty of skepticism that this time, Saddam hussein will keep his 
word. ABC's Karla Davis is at the White House. a day after the president 
issued, then rescinded, orders to bomb iraq, Mr. Clinton declared 
the U.S. the winner in the stare-down with saddam Hussein. Our willingness 
to strike, together with the overwhelming weight of world opinion, 
produced the outcome we preferred. Saddam Hussein reversing course, 
Iraq has backed down. But that is not enough. Now, Iraq must live 
up to its obligations. The primary obligation -- unfettered access 
for 120 United Nations weapons inspectors who will now head back to 
Iraq. In letters to the U.N. last night, deputies for Saddam Hussein 
explained iraq's inntn work with the U.N. special commission, inspecting 
chemical and biological weapons programs. Our decision to resume relations 
with UNSCOM is unequivocal and is unconditional. But the United States 
and its staunchest Ally, Great Britain, remain skeptical. The troop 
buildup in the Persian gulf continues. Saddam Hussein needs to know 
that we remain ready, willing and able to strike. And today, six B-52s 
and ten F-117s began arrivingn the gulf region, bringing the number 
of U.S. planes there to nearly 200. It is a force that the president 
should use, not repeatedly threaten to use, according to critics in 
Washington. What he should have said, "next time there's a place that 
you don't allow us to inspect, stand by because it will be destroyed." 
But the Clinton administration is granting Iraq another chance to 
cooperate, saying Saddam may be more inclined to comply this time 
because support from Iraq's allies is dwindling, and because Saddam 
Hussein now sees a military strike may be just one broken promise 
away. The president stopped short of calling for the overthrow of 
Saddam Hussein but did indicate the U.S. will increase efforts to 
help anti-Saddam forces within Iraq to accomplish the long-term goal 
of bringing the current regime down. Karla Davis, ABC News, the White 
House.
