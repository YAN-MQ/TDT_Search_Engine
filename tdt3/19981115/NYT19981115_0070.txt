Monday night's return to Iraq of Arthur Kent, who covered the Persian 
Gulf war, is largely given, as the program's title reveals, to ``A 
Wedding in Basra.'' It's a colorful if not especially revealing look 
at a young couple, Sahar and Ali, and their extended family, celebrating 
a love match in a country where there is not much to celebrate, particularly 
as American ships, planes and missiles were once again being gathered 
for an attack. It's a casual, scattershot sort of report: a hint that 
the Iraqis are doing some oil smuggling to evade the U.N. embargo 
and bring in hard currency, which, it is suggested, is going into 
an arms buildup; comments by a couple of Iraqis in exile on the iron 
controls over the country's people, including the threat of execution 
for going public with any criticism of Saddam Hussein (``the paranoia 
of politically motivated spying,'' as Kent characterizes the state 
of things); a review of the tensions between U.N. inspectors and Iraqi 
officials; views of the nationwide suffering, as children go without 
food and medicine. Kent, who notes that like all foreign visitors 
he is diligently accompanied by a ``minder'' or two to keep him from 
discovering anything surprising, advances the case that the Iraqi 
people do not love their ruler as much as they hate the sanctions 
that make life grim. What with dire shortages and rampant inflation, 
survival is a sometime thing. One man, apparently speaking for many 
others as well as for the state, says his people are ``victims of 
the politics of the U.S.A.'' Only those connected with the ruling 
cadre are prospering. And back Kent goes to the wedding festivities. 
Even while enjoying the preparations (Ali bids a loving farewell to 
his barber), Kent is gloomy about prospects of winning the hearts 
and minds of many Iraqis. However the current crisis turns out, this 
guest at the wedding says, ``Our role is a failure.'' BROADCAST NOTES:
