Germany's 2 million Turks are eager to gain dual nationality under 
a planned easing of the nation's strict citizenship law, a lawmaker 
said Sunday, one day after the controversial deportation of a German-born 
juvenile delinquent of Turkish decent. Muhlis Ari _ known in the German 
media as ``Mehmet'' _ was flown to Istanbul from Munich on Saturday, 
after Germany's highest court upheld Bavarian state officials in revoking 
the boy's residency permit for his long history of vandalism, fights 
and petty thefts. His deportation followed months of debate and legal 
wrangling over whether the state had the right to deport the 14-year-old, 
who feels himself to be German but is not a citizen. A 1913 law bases 
citizenship on German blood ties, not place of birth. Seeking to better 
integrate the foreigners who make up one-tenth of Germany's 75 million 
people, the newly elected government recently agreed to ease the law 
to allow dual citizenship and to give citizenship to those born in 
Germany. ``If Mehmet had had double citizenship, he would have been 
treated like any other German youth,'' said Cem Ozdemir, a member 
of German parliament who is of Turkish decent. The new law has yet 
to be drafted, but Ozdemir said many of Turks are eager to take advantage 
of it after years of living caught between two cultures. Ari's parents, 
for example, have lived for 30 years in Germany. His father, Yusef, 
worked for BMW, and his mother, Guelsen, was a hotel maid. They have 
never been in trouble with the law, yet Bavarian officials also sought 
to deport them, accusing them of endangering public safety by failing 
to raise their son properly. Courts blocked the deportation of Ari's 
parents, but after a swift trial, Bavaria's highest court last month 
upheld the state's decision to deny him a new residency permit, clearing 
the way for deportation. Ari's relatives living outside Istanbul were 
expected to take him in, but they have not yet contacted the boy, 
his lawyer Alexander Eberth said. Ari spent Saturday night in a state-run 
juvenile home and then moved Sunday into an Istanbul hotel with his 
16-year-old girlfriend, who flew with him from Germany. She is expected 
to return to Munich in a week.
