Taking a cue from Duke, which it is expected to rival for supremacy 
in men's college basketball this season, Connecticut on Sunday also 
posted an opening-game rout over a school from the state of Connecticut. 
On Saturday, Duke, which was ranked first in the preseason Associated 
Press poll, among others, dominated Fairfield, 98-66, in Durham, N.C. 
Sunday afternoon, Connecticut, ranked second in the AP poll but first 
in several others, trounced Quinnipiac, 102-60, before a capacity 
crowd of 10,027 at the Gampel Pavilion. Quinnipiac _ a school of 3,500 
undergraduate students in Hamden, Conn., near New Haven _ was making 
its debut in Division I-A with only two returning starters from a 
team that finished at 4-23 last season in Division II. Not surprisingly, 
the game was not a good gauge of a Connecticut team that returns all 
five starters and a strong nucleus of reserves, along with a heralded 
freshman, Edmund Saunders from Waterbury, Conn. Led by forward Richard 
Hamilton, a preseason all-American, and point guard Khalid El-Amin 
who scored 25 and 28 points respectively, the Huskies led by 25 points 
in the opening half. Hamilton, recently recovered from a broken right 
foot that kept him from playing with the U.S. National Team in the 
world basketball championships this past summer, hit on 8 of 16 shots, 
including 3 of 6 from 3-point range. El-Amin was 3 of 4 from 3-point 
range in 9-of-12 shooting. The 6-foot 8-inch Saunders, who sat out 
last year for academic reasons, was impressive in his Connecticut 
debut. Playing only 17 minutes, the smooth freshman connected on 6 
of 8 shots, mostly from inside, and had a game-high 11 rebounds. The 
Huskies outrebounded the visitors, 57-29, and outshot them 46.3 percent 
to 39 percent. Quinnipiac, which is coached by Joe DeSantis, a onetime 
star player at Fairfield, hurt itself with 27 turnovers, many at the 
outset, when Connecticut employed a full-court press. Jim Calhoun, 
beginning his 13th season as the Connecticut coach, was generous in 
his praise of Quinnipiac, which was led by Nate Pondexter's 21 points. 
``I was very impressed with Quinnipiac,'' Calhoun said. ``We had the 
superior size and they were running up against a team that is 10-deep. 
But they handled the ball well and they attacked our pressure.'' As 
for his team, which went 32-5 last season and reached the Final Eight 
of the National Collegiate Athletic Association tournament, Calhoun 
had no complaints. ``We played in spurts,'' he said. ``It was a choppy 
kind of performance. But I'm not disappointed.''
