Lebanese guerrillas fired rockets and mortars Sunday at Israeli positions 
in southern Lebanon along the border with the Jewish state, Lebanese 
security officials said. A statement by Iranian-backed Hezbollah guerrillas 
said the morning attacks were in response to daily Israeli air attacks 
on South Lebanon for the past week. It said the guerrillas targeted 
11 outposts belonging to Israeli troops and their South Lebanon Army 
militia allies in the central and western sectors of an Israeli-occupied 
enclave in South Lebanon. Hezbollah and the security officials, speaking 
on customary condition of anonymity, said the targets included military 
positions in the Lebanese village of Blatt and Abbad, both about 500 
meters (yards) north of the Israeli border. An Israeli army spokesman 
in Jerusalem said the guerrilla shelling damaged an Israeli post in 
the western sector of the enclave but that none of the shells overshot 
the border. ``Following a survey of the area, no remains of shells 
were found in Israeli areas,'' the spokesman said. Israel's army radio 
said explosions presumed to be mortar shells were heard along Israel's 
northern border. The Hezbollah statement said the attacks were ``in 
response to recent Israeli aggression in the form of air raids on 
positions of the Islamic resistance.'' Israeli planes have raided 
suspected Hezbollah positions on a daily basis since Nov. 8. None 
of the raids resulted in casualties. On Saturday, Israeli jets fired 
two missiles at the village of Sojod in Iqlim al-Tuffah, a Hezbollah 
stronghold that faces the occupied enclave. Hezbollah has been fighting 
to oust Israeli forces and their SLA militia allies from the enclave 
that Israel carved out in in 1985 to protect against cross-border 
guerrilla raids.
