Japanese veteran Junko Asari spurted past Ari Ichihashi just before 
the finish line Sunday, winning a neck-and-neck duel that lasted the 
last five kilometers (three miles) of the Tokyo International Women's 
Marathon. Asari, 29, won her second Tokyo marathon in 2 hours, 28 
minutes, 29 seconds. Japanese compatriot Ichihashi was clocked in 
the same time. Asari fell behind her 20-year-old rival with just 100 
meters left, but overtook her again in the final 50 meters. ``I'm 
so happy, because I wanted to win so badly,'' Asari said. She said 
she never lost her composure, because she believed in her finishing 
kick. For the 1993 world champion, the victory marked a comeback from 
her unimpressive 17th-place finish at the 1996 Olympics. Japan's Azumi 
Miyazaki finished third in 2:30:06 in her marathon debut. Germany's 
Katrin Dorre-Heinig, a three-time winner of the event, finished fifth 
in 2:31:44, and 1996 Olympic gold medalist Fatuma Roba of Ethiopia 
ended eighth in 2:36:22 after slowing down late in the race because 
of abdominal pains.
