Iraq's ambassador to the U.N. says the latest crisis has helped bring 
worldwide attention to the economic sanctions frustrating his country. 
He maintains Iraq will comply with the weapons inspections agreement 
brokered by the U.N. secretary-general earlier this year. It will 
be resolved peacefully. I think it's very important, not only for 
Iraq, but probably for the rest of the region over there, that this 
crisis be solved peacefully and that it could lead to some path that 
will help out in the process of both implementing United Nations resolutions 
and also removing the sanctions off the Iraqi people. Iraq has caused 
this crisis. And that's where it starts. It starts with them. If they 
will come back into cooperation, fine. But that's the terms and conditions 
of that for the security council to judge.
