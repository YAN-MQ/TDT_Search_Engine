The home-court advantage didn't help Thomas Johansson. Capitalizing 
on the Swede's sloppy serving, Todd Martin beat Johansson in three 
straight sets to win the Stockholm Open for the first time Sunday. 
The 28-year-old American, who lost the final two years ago to another 
Swede, Thomas Enqvist, won 6-3, 6-4, 6-4 before a sellout crowd at 
the Royal Tennis Hall. Johansson, a member of the Royal Lawn Tennis 
Club, became a hero on the same center court two months ago when he 
clinched another final berth in the Davis Cup for Sweden. But Johansson 
just couldn't get his usual strong serves going against Martin. And 
he couldn't shake off the early jitters. The American didn't serve 
well either in the first set, which featured five service breaks, 
including four in a row. But Johansson only managed to hold his serve 
once in the first set. ``It was a very strange match,'' Martin said. 
``I started off very well and Thomas started off very poorly. He was 
nervous. And the fact that he was a little nervous made me a little 
nervous. ``That's why there were five breaks in the first set. That's 
not the type of tennis you'd expect us to play, especially on this 
(fast) court. But there's one thing I've learned over the last couple 
of years. You don't have to play great to win.'' Martin became the 
first American winner of the Stockholm Open, one of the world's oldest 
indoor tournaments, since John McEnroe in 1985. ``I was very confident, 
because I've played very well in this arena and in the past few weeks,'' 
said Martin, who beat third-ranked Patrick Rafter of Australia and 
fifth-ranked countryman Andre Agassi in the Paris Open a week ago. 
``And I was fortunate to start every set early with the break.'' Johansson, 
23, the highest ranked (18th) Swede on the ATP Tour, played his worst 
match of the tournament. ``I had a good week, but it was a pity that 
I couldn't play better in the final,'' he said. ``It was my worst 
match this week. But he played very well and deserved to win. If you 
want to lose to someone, it's against Todd because he's such a good 
guy.'' The ATP Tour is now over except for its annual season-ending 
World Championships, featuring the top eight players, later this month 
in Hanover, Germany. But the season is not over for Johansson. He'll 
try to get one of the singles spots for defending champion Sweden 
in the Davis Cup final against Italy early next month in Milan. For 
Martin, it was the second ATP Tour title this year. He also won a 
tournament on clay in Barcelona in April. ``I felt like I have played 
better than I ever had in the past five weeks and even before that, 
in the U.S. Open and Indianapolis,'' Martin said. ``It's thrilling 
for me and I hope to continue to improve and enjoy some more success 
like this.'' Martin, unseeded and ranked 21st on the ATP Tour going 
into the event, earned dlrs 112,000 for his seventh career title. 
It was the American's third victory in as many matches with Johansson.
