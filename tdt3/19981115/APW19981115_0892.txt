GENEVA (AP) _ UEFA's appeals panel on Sunday confirmed the decision 
to expel Fiorentina from the UEFA Cup for the rest of the season because 
of an explosion that injured a match official. After close to seven 
hours of testimony and deliberations, UEFA's board of appeal rejected 
the Italian club's bid to have the Nov. 3 second-round, second-leg 
match at Salerno replayed. UEFA's Control and Disciplinary Commission 
suspended the Italian team last Sunday after Belgian off-field referee 
Philippe Flament was injured during halftime by an explosive device 
hurled from the stands, causing the match to be abandoned. As a result, 
Zurich's Grasshoppers advances to the third round of the UEFA Cup 
against France's Girondins de Bordeaux. ``The board made it clear 
that the decision taken by the first instance is appropriate,'' UEFA 
said in a press release. ``The fundamental UEFA principle whereby 
the organising club is responsible for order and security was confirmed. 
``In view of the fact that the security control at the entry gates 
of the stadium were judged insufficient, but also given the previous 
record of the Italian club and the serious nature of the incident, 
the board had no other choice.'' Having won the first leg in Zurich 
2-0 and leading 2-1 after the first half of its home match, Fiorentina 
was expected to easily qualify for the third round. But the match 
was suspended after a spectator tossed the explosive from the stands 
onto the field, injuring Flament and temporarily deafening several 
players. Flament was taken to hospital with a knee injury. UEFA said 
that Fiorentina was responsible for security even though the match 
was played in Salerno and not at Fiorentina's home city of Florence. 
``It was revealed today that the size of the bomb was such that it 
should have been detected,'' said Rene Eberle, head of UEFA's competition 
and logistics department. ``A more thorough search would have detected 
it. But only a random search of spectators was done, where they only 
searched those who looked suspicious.'' The match was being played 
in Salerno because Fiorentina was serving the second and last round 
of its Franchi stadium suspension, resulting from fan violence during 
a 1997 European Cup Winners' Cup game. The one mitigating factor that 
helped Fiorentina was that the suspect in the case, is reported to 
be a supporter of Fiorentina's Italian rival Salernitana. That factor 
saved the team from being banned from all future UEFA club competitions 
as well, UEFA said. Outraged, Fiorentina's General Manager Luciano 
Luca said the club couldn't afford such drastic security measures, 
adding he felt the team had been victimized. ``This sentence is a 
real injustice to Florence,'' Luna said. ``We are the victims of a 
terrorist attack which had nothing to do with sport. ``The rules should 
be revised. It gives the wrong idea. It's not possible to have such 
an interpretation of rules as we enter the new millenium.'' Luna added 
that the punishment would further aggravate Fiorentina's financial 
problems.
