The United Nations security council meets again this afternoon on 
the situation with Iraq. Last night's debate ended shortly before 
midnight without an agreement on whether to accept Iraq's offer. The 
council is considering what Iraqi officials call an "unconditional" 
pledge to resume weapons inspections in Iraq. The United States says 
Iraq's offer does, in fact, carry unacceptable conditions.
