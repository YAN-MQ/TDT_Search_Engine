In Victoria, Texas, flooding along the guadualupe river is sending 
some residents to their roofs and into trees. Boats, helicopters, 
and even jet skis are being used to rescue them. City officials say 
the river is expected to rise even higher tomorrow. 60 south Texas 
counties from San Antonio to Houston are under flood alerts after 
four days of heavy rain. At least 17 people have been killed. Thousands 
of residents are being housed in shelters statewide. We'll have the 
complete extended weather forecast in just a few minutes.
