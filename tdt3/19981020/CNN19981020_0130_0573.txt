Madeline has weakened into a tropical depression at last report, it 
was about 160 miles southeast of Los mochis, Mexico and heading northwest 
at 12 miles an hour. Although the Mexican government has canceled 
all watches and warnings, it says Madeline could spawn heavy rains. 
Further south, hurricane Lester continues moving out to sea, with 
90 mile-an-hour winds.
