President Joseph Estrada on Tuesday ordered gold mining suspended 
in a southern mountain area while the government takes steps to ensure 
miners' safety. Estrada also wanted a government task force to introduce 
safeguards against environmental damage and settle disputes among 
the miners on the slopes of Mount Diwalwal, a vast gold-mining area 
in Davao del Norte province. Environment Secretary Antonio Cerilles, 
chief of the task force, said it would delineate areas assigned to 
small- and large-scale miners to prevent disputes. The government 
also would offer its gold ore processing facilities, which are safer 
for miners, and restrict the use of harmful chemicals and explosives, 
he said. Last year, officials banned the use of mercury in the mines 
after a check on residents showed several children were suffering 
from mercury poisoning. Many of the miners, however, then shifted 
to the use of cyanide, another toxic chemical, officials said. There 
have been indications that chemicals like mercury have seeped into 
river tributaries near Diwalwal, local officials said. Cerilles said 
gold mining would be allowed to resume once the planned safeguards 
are in place. The government said it also plans to set up a central 
bank station near Diwalwal to monitor and buy some of the gold being 
mined there.
