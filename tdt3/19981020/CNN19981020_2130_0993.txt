The securities and exchange commission is going after 6 brokerage 
firms for not reporting how they are preparing for the "year 2000" 
computer bug. It's the first time the S.E.C. has enforced "year 2000" 
disclosure rules. Computer systems around the world are expected to 
interpret the last two digits of the "year 2000" as the year 1900.
