Harvard University is working to cut down on student stress after 
the suicides of three graduate students in the last two years. The 
Ivy league school says grad students are under enormous pressure, 
and many feel overworked and isolated. So it is planning to start 
offering social programs, off-campus psychiatric services and network 
meetings with alumni. A suggestion for more faculty advisers came 
from one student in his suicide note.
