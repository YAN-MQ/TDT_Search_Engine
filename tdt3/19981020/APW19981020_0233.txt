In a grisly trend authorities suspect is linked to Japan's souring 
economy, a record number of suicide victims have been found this year 
in a sprawling forest at the foot of Mount Fuji. More than 300 police 
and firefighters scoured the huge forest southwest of Tokyo on Tuesday 
in an annual search for victims. They found three bodies, bringing 
to 58 the number found in the area so far this year. By year's end, 
the 1998 toll ``would be more than 70 bodies,'' Masaaki Mochizuki, 
spokesman for Fujiyoshida police, predicted. The previous record was 
set in 1994, when 57 bodies were found in the forest, which investigators 
have been searching for suicide victims once a year since 1971. Last 
year, 55 were found, including 20 in the year's last three months. 
The forest is considered a prime suicide spot because of its isolation, 
and was recommended in a book about suicide a few years ago, Mochizuki 
said. He said it was unclear why more people are committing suicide 
there, but Kyodo News agency quoted unidentified authorities as saying 
the country's deep recession could be behind the increase. Suicide 
in Japan is often seen as an honorable way out of a shameful situation, 
and experts say more Japanese are killing themselves rather than bear 
the humiliation of failure in business or at work. In 1997, a total 
of 24,391 Japanese killed themselves _ up 5.6 percent from 23,104 
the previous year, the National Police Agency said. Japan's overall 
suicide rate is high, at 17.2 per 100,000 people. That compares with 
12 in the United States and 7.5 in England, but is well below Finland's 
27.3, according to Japan's Health Ministry. The Aokigahara forest 
is as isolated as it gets in crowded Japan. At 621 square kilometers 
(248 square miles), the forest _ known as the ``sea of trees'' _ covers 
an area the size of Tokyo. The latest three victims were found Tuesday 
by a team of 342 police and firefighters. The other victims were discovered 
by hikers, picnickers and students who explore caves in the area. 
About 40 other people have gone to the forest to commit suicide so 
far this year but failed, Mochizuki said.
