A man who claims to be India's oldest man credits his long life to 
good eating and a healthy lifestyle. Anita Pratap has his story. Rahim 
Khan claims he is 125 years old. He has a document that shows he retired 
in 1938. In those days, people retired at 65. Of course, like most 
Indian elders, he has no birth certificate to prove he was 65 when 
he retired. One day he told me that he attended the funeral of a Noble 
man when he was 10 years old and that was around 115 years ago. Going 
by that, he should now be 125 years old. Whatever be his real age, 
Rahim Khan is no doubt a very old man and rather well-preserved. I 
have managed to live so long because every day I used to eat almonds 
and food made out of pure, clarified butter. I also never had bad 
habits like drinking and smoking. Rahim Khan lost his eyesight 36 
years ago. Other than the fact he is blind, Rahim Khan is remarkably 
fit. He says he has no medical problems. Rahim Khan began his career 
as a water carrier in the king's palace. Later, he joined the royal 
band as a clarinet player. I would still love to play the clarinet 
but I don't have any teeth left. But that does not stop him from eating 
mutton, the meat that he still enjoys. Rahim Khan lives on a pension 
of about $30 a month. He says it's more than enough for his needs. 
He is even able to save $5 to $6 a month. All his five children are 
dead, so he lives with his brother's great-grandchildren, and loves 
telling them royal tales from the past. Nowadays, everyone is after 
money. Nobody has any time. In the old days, people used to sit around 
and chat for hours. Rahim Khan spends almost his whole day in prayer. 
He is not afraid of death and has only one wish. I really hope I can 
go for Hajj pilgrimage. Age has hardly withered his body, much less 
his spirit. Anita Pratap, CNN, jaipur, India.
