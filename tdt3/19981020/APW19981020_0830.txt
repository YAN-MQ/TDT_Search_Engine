A commission investigating what happened on ``Bloody Sunday'' 26 years 
ago, when British soldiers killed 13 unarmed Catholic protesters, 
announced Tuesday it would delay hearings indefinitely because of 
the huge backlog of testimony to collect. Lord Saville, a senior English 
judge heading the independent investigation, said hundreds more people 
than expected had asked to give statements to the commission's lawyers 
in Londonderry, where the shootings occurred. Saville said his hopes 
of launching oral hearings in February had been further complicated 
by the difficulty of determining which British soldiers the commission 
must try to track down. Besides the 10 or so former soldiers who already 
had volunteered to testify, the British army recently presented records 
identifying all 3,000 soldiers stationed in Londonderry at the time, 
Saville said. The Bloody Sunday killings are considered a threshold 
event in the Northern Ireland conflict. A British judicial inquiry 
in 1972 concluded the soldiers fired recklessly but with justification, 
a verdict that united the city's Catholic majority in fury. Officials 
from the United States and New Zealand also are members of the independent 
commission.
