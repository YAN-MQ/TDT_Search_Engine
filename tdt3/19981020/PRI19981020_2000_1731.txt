More news still ahead on THE WORLD. This is PRI. That's Public Radio 
International. Thanks for tuning in to public radio, 91 FM. You know, 
we're a noncommercial service. We don't raise revenue here by selling 
advertisements, and we don't make a profit. We're a public service 
radio station. We raise the money that it takes to put programs like 
THE WORLD on the air through membership pledges, and that's where 
you come in. Become a member today and pledge 60 or $120 now at 215-923-1234. 
That's 215-923-1234. I'm Lisa Mullins. Still to come on THE WORLD, 
Jamaicans rediscover their roots in words. People have been told that 
"You have no language, you have no culture, your function is as beast 
of burden. Your place is on the plantation making profit for me." 
And what black people, African people have said, "But this is nonsense." 
First up, this news.
