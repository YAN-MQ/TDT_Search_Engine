LONDON (AP) _ ``Lord of the Dance'' star Michael Flatley on Tuesday 
settled a multimillion-pound (dollar) lawsuit brought by his former 
manager. Terms of the settlement were not disclosed, but Flatley ended 
the weeks of court proceedings by agreeing to pay former manager John 
Reid a ``substantial'' sum, plus legal costs, a spokesman for the 
dancer said. Reid, who also managed Elton John, claimed he was fired 
just as the popularity of Flatley's Irish dance production surged. 
He filed suit in High Court seeking 10 million (dlrs 17 million) compensation 
for what he contends was a breach of contract. Reid claimed Flatley, 
40, who hung up his dancing shoes in July, dismissed him early into 
the British run of ``Lord of the Dance.'' Flatley countersued, claiming 
the managerial agreement was reached by undue influence and amounted 
to a restraint of trade. ``Naturally, I am delighted to put this behind 
me,'' Reid said. ``It is a real shame that so much time and money 
and effort has been wasted in the process of getting to the point 
which we could have reached two years ago.''
