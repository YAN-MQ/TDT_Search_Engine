Elsewhere in this country, an attorney for Paula Jones has asked a 
U.S. appeals court to reinstate her sexual harassment lawsuit against 
President Clinton saying critical evidence in the case was ignored. 
The plaintiff and the defense presented their arguments in St. Paul, 
Minnesota just a short while ago after their efforts to settle the 
charges out of court failed. Mrs. Jones says Mr. Clinton made crude 
sexual advances to her back in 1991 when he was governor of Arkansas 
and she was a state employee. Mr. Clinton has called the charges bogus. 
Last April, an Arkansas judge dismissed the suit as unsubstantiated, 
but the attorney for Mrs. Jones, James Fisher, says the judge has 
ignored evidence there was a hostile work environment that was created 
for his client. The lawyer for Mr. Clinton, Amy Sabrin, says the accuser 
has failed to provide any proof of that.
