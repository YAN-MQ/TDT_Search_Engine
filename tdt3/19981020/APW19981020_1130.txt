The caretaker of a tiny Antiguan island has been acquitted of trying 
to kill the prime minister's brother during a fight over construction 
of a resort. A jury on Monday found Cyril Thomas ``Taffy'' Bufton, 
a 73-year-old Welshman who tended Guiana Island with his wife for 
32 years, innocent of charges he meant to wound or kill. Bufton had 
been charged with shooting Vere Bird Jr., the brother of Prime Minister 
Lester Bird, on Dec. 16. Bird, 61, claimed Bufton came into his law 
office in St. John's and pulled a gun on him minutes after Parliament 
passed a bill to evict Bufton and his wife, Lorna Eleen ``Bonny'' 
Bufton, from the island. There was a scuffle, and Bufton was injured 
in the hand. Bird was shot in the mouth and underwent reconstructive 
surgery in New York. During the trial, Bufton's defense lawyers argued 
there was confusion as to what happened in the office and that the 
bullet may have ricocheted off a wall before striking Bird. Bird, 
who is a member of the Caribbean country's Parliament, voted in favor 
of the eviction bill, but argued for more leniency for the Buftons, 
the island's only residents. The measured cleared the way for a dlrs 
300 million luxury resort to be built on the 460-acre (184-hectare) 
isle. The Buftons arrived on Guiana Island in the 1960s to farm the 
land for the London lawyer who owned the island, then stayed on after 
the owner's 1972 death in an informal caretaking agreement with the 
government. They tended the island's animals, including a colony of 
rare West Indian whistling ducks. The Buftons were offered dlrs 500,000 
in exchange for leaving the island, but they asked the government 
for four times that amount.
