A new poll shows that while more Americans feel financially satisfied 
than at any time in the past 30 years, most are worried about what 
they see as a Growing economic gap between rich and poor. 67% of respondents 
described themselves as "haves." 24% deemed themselves "have nots." 
Even so, most believe more Americans are getting rich. 74% said they 
believe the number of wealthy people is increasing. That's up from 
65% in 1990. The poll was taken in April and may, before the broad 
UPS and Downs of the financial markets began.
