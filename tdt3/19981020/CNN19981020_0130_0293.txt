Microsoft is expected to make its opening statements Tuesday in its 
anti-trust battle with the government. Justice lawyers made their 
case on Monday. They contend the software giant used its market strength 
to try to crush netscape communications a rival Internet browser maker. 
They played the videotaped deposition of Microsoft chairman Bill Gates 
and presented internal memos that appeared to contradict his statements. 
Microsoft says the government took his words out of context. An analyst 
says the software company may face huge consequences if it loses. 
The court could take further remedies, for example, justice could 
ask that microsoft be broken up into separate companies. Some people 
were talking about the notion that it would be kind of like the breakup 
of AT&T several years ago where you would have a Microsoft operating 
system company that would sell windows and other operating system, 
then the applications, including possible explorer, certainly certain 
Microsoft's office word processing, et cetera, would be handled by 
a different company. Oddly enough, the Microsoft case and Monica Lewinsky 
share some similarities. We'll look at those later in "Dollars & Sense."
