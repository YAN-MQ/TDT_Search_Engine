U.S. refugee officials have resumed aid shipments to ethnic Albanians 
in Serbia's Kosovo province after a one-day halt due to reports of 
new violence. A spokesman for the U.N. High Commissioner for Refugees 
says two convoys delivered supplies to refugees west of Pristina. 
Meanwhile, U.N. experts are in Pristina to access the situation and 
to report back to the U.N. secretary general.
