Wall Street's seismic tremors have barely rattled the glassware in 
most New York restaurants. The question is whether there will be aftershocks. 
``Right now business has been great, but I'm expecting to see a blip,'' 
said Charles Palmer, the owner of Aureole, echoing the views of other 
owners. ``On a couple of the days when the market went crazy, we had 
30 lunch cancellations by 11 a.m.'' Nobody is putting the glassware 
away for safekeeping yet, but despite the market's recent rebound, 
a mood of caution has settled over the restaurant business, which 
has been euphoric for the last few years. At Patroon, Ken Aretsky, 
an owner, expects a turndown early next year. ``The year-end bonuses 
will be off dramatically, and we probably will not be selling $2,500 
bottles of wine,'' he said. Few meals involve a $2,500 bottle of wine, 
though. So for the time being, it's business as usual, more or less. 
While some experienced restaurateurs have suggested that there may 
already be a restaurant glut in the city, New York has so far not 
seen the cancellation of major projects, unlike Singapore, where the 
construction of a four-story rooftop restaurant was recently postponed. 
Openings continue at a steady clip. Last week, Henry Meer opened City 
Hall, a large, handsome American-style brasserie in an 1863 cast-iron 
building in TriBeCa. ``I put computer hookups in one private room, 
so Wall Street firms can have meetings,'' he said. ``I don't know 
how well it will do, but I'm not worried about the restaurant. People 
always want to eat out.'' Restaurateurs predict that the well-known 
places with a solid customer base and good food and service will not 
suffer. And moderately priced places in areas like the East Village 
will also continue to thrive, they say. The niche just below the top, 
where prices may be too high for the neighborhood, may suffer, experts 
say. Tyler Merson, a chef who has been trying to open a restaurant 
with a Wall Street backer since March, has not found any real estate 
bargains. ``I offered $300,000 for a place that's on the market for 
$400,000, but they still want $375,000,'' he said. Caterers are feeling 
a crunch, though. ``We were supposed to do an event this month with 
Morgan Stanley,'' said Diana Barnett, an owner of the Main Event, 
a catering company. ``They have put it on hold for the time being. 
I'm not calling my Wall Street clients just now.'' When the stock 
market crashed in 1987, it took more than a year for restaurants to 
feel the effects. Value became the buzzword. Aurora struggled and 
finally perished while customers stood on line for huge family-style 
portions at Carmine's. The prix fixe menu is another way to deliver 
value to the customer and the restaurant. ``You can be sure that if 
the slide continues, they'll be putting in prix fixe menus as of Jan. 
2,'' said Clark Wolf, a restaurant consultant. The Four Seasons is 
not waiting. It has already changed its dinner menu in the Grill Room, 
from a la carte, with main dishes from $38 to $47, to a prix fixe 
menu, at $59. Some of the closest monitoring of the situation is being 
done by people whose companies depend on restaurants. In 1991, D'Artagnan, 
the Newark supplier of foie gras, lost $60,000 and nearly closed because 
of uncollected bills, said Ariane Daguin, an owner. And now? ``We're 
anxious, and we're monitoring the situation but there is not one sign 
of a problem yet,'' she said. ``The jitters are in people's minds, 
not in the reservation books.''
