PATRICK O'CONNELL, PRI CORRESPONDENT, BUSINESS DESK: American exports 
fall for the fifth straight month, pushing the U.S. trade deficit 
to a record high. I'm Patrick O'Connell at the business desk in New 
York. "The U.S. consumer is the consumer of last resort," the words 
of one Wall Street figure today commenting on the fact that the U.S. 
is buying and the rest of the world is selling to it. Figures released 
today show the U.S. trade gap widened by a hefty $2.2 billion for 
August. It's now higher than it's ever been. The balance between how 
much America buys and how much it sells is in the red by $16.8 billion. 
Exports fell by.3 percent; that's the fifth consecutive drop now, 
the lowest level for exports in more than a year and a half. Roseanne 
Kahn, economist with Credit Suisse First Boston explains. The most 
important determinant of the trade balance is the health of the U.S. 
economy in terms of how much imports were absorbing and health of 
the foreign economies in terms of how much of our exports they can 
afford to buy. And so the biggest negative has been the quite abysmal 
performance of the economies in the Far East. So do you think in an 
average house that such a thing exists in the U.S., there should be 
concern about the fact that the U.S. is sucking in imports and reducing 
the amount of exports? You might even put it differently: the U.S. 
can't afford not to have this kind of trade deficit since we are the 
consumer of last resort and it is rising U.S. demand that is the only 
source of positive demand in Asia. It is incumbent on us to continue 
to fill that role. U.S. exports to China took the biggest hit, pushing 
the trade deficit with that country to nearly $6 billion, the highest 
with any U.S. trading partner. The deficit with Western Europe was 
more than cut in half, though, falling from $5.1 billion to $2.2 billion. 
Meantime, it's been a day of hope for investors as stocks cross the 
board in New York enjoyed a following wind. This is the so-called 
super Tuesday, the days of many of the biggest names in business report 
their profits. After pushing down their expectations, investors find 
that in fact the numbers have come in better than their reduced estimates. 
That's it from the business desk this Tuesday. I'm Patrick O'Connell 
in New York.
