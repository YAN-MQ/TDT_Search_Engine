You're listening to National Public Radio News. This is Paula Goby 
in Rio De Janeiro. The other day, I went to interview a congressman 
on the legislation that was about to be approved. I'm sitting in the 
waiting lounge talking with his chief of staff. All of a sudden, he 
starts telling me how a man cannot live with only one woman. "It's 
inconceivable," he says, then explains to me that he always has several 
lovers who he treats very nicely buys them flowers and takes them 
out for lunch. I understood. The climate can go to your head. Oh, 
with the tropics, the sun, skimpy bikinis, sensualities in the air 
in Rio de Janeiro. The game of seduction is a national sport and it's 
in season all year round. The sex life of a public official, it just 
isn't news in Rio de Janeiro. Public Radio goes to the ends of the
