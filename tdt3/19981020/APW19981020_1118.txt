Could this be the same Vinny Testaverde that American football fans 
have belittled for more than a decade? The guy who won the Heisman 
Trophy, then had his career turn sour when he turned pro? Testaverde's 
12th National Football League season has taken a somewhat unexpected 
turn. He's started half of the New York Jets' three games, and won 
them all. Glenn Foley, the incumbent quarterback, is 0-3 and injury-prone. 
So what's up with Vinny? For one thing, his confidence is soaring. 
For another, his coach, Bill Parcells, has faith in him. For yet another, 
he's surrounded by good offensive talent in running backs Curtis Martin 
and Leon Johnson and receivers Wayne Chrebet, Keyshawn Johnson and 
Dedric Ward. ``It's a little early to tell,'' Parcells said after 
Testaverde threw for 294 yards and three touchdowns in Monday night's 
24-14 victory at New England. ``I think that he likes the system and 
it's not a real big adjustment from the systems he's been in. There 
aren't many guys in the league who can throw the ball like him. ``He 
manages a game well and he works diligently.'' Testaverde is working 
extra hard to erase the image of being the kind of quarterback who 
makes the key mistake. In his career, he's made the playoffs only 
once, with the 1994 Browns, who were coached by current Jets defensive 
coordinator Bill Belichick. Otherwise, it's been lots of losses in 
Tampa Bay, Cleveland and Baltimore. But there haven't been any defeats 
with the Jets. He went 2-0 when Foley was injured earlier this season. 
He's 1-0 after Foley was benched. ``I'm comfortable with what we're 
doing,'' Testaverde said. ``I'm real proud of our guys, because they 
fought hard on the road against a division opponent on a Monday night. 
``A lot of teams have been talking about New England. When we played 
Miami two weeks ago, a lot of people were talking about them.'' It 
will be hard to ignore Testaverde and the Jets if they can win some 
more critical games like Monday's. A loss probably would have doomed 
them to mediocrity _ not that 3-3 is anything special. The win, however, 
makes them believers again. Most significantly for Testaverde, there 
doesn't figure to be any question on who will be the quarterback for 
the foreseeable future. It's Vinny's job. ``Obviously, he's been around,'' 
said Ward, who caught a 43-yard TD pass to clinch the victory at Foxboro, 
Mass. ``He's a seasoned vet who has seen a lot of things and played 
in a lot of big games in that span. He knows how to handle it.''
