The Dominican republic is still recovering from hurricane georges, 
but people there have reason to celebrate today. Native son and Chicago 
cubs' slugger Sammy Sosa has arrived home. Dominicans followed Sosa 
as he and St. Louis Cardinals first baseman Mark mcGwire chased the 
single-season home run record of Roger Maris. Today is a day of national 
celebration across the Caribbean island. Since the hurricane struck, 
Sosa's foundation has sent food and supplies to his Homeland.
