Switzerland has ordered the confiscation of more than dlrs 100 million 
in accounts belonging to the brother of former Mexican President Carlos 
Salinas de Gortari, the federal prosecutor's office said Tuesday. 
The brother, Raul Salinas de Gortari, is in prison in Mexico pending 
completion of trials in Mexico in a political assassination and on 
a charge of illegal enrichment from 1984 to 1988 during his brother's 
administration. The prosecutor's office ``holds that the frozen funds 
in Swiss bank accounts _ of which Raul Salinas is a co-owner _ constitute 
in part the criminal proceeds of protection payoffs,'' it said in 
a statement. The Swiss discontinued their own proceedings on charges 
of money laundering against Raul Salinas and three co-defendants, 
but prosecutor's said the findings of a 2 1/2 year investigation ``inevitably 
suggest money laundering'' of drug profits. ``The business dealings 
Raul Salinas claims to be legal are for all practical purposes unsound 
and incomprehensible and contrary to customary business usage,'' the 
office added. Most of the money _ dlrs 89.9 million _ ordered confiscated 
is in Swiss bank accounts. But the office is also requesting that 
Britain seize dlrs 24.5 million. Salinas has denied any links to drug 
traffickers and said the money in the Swiss accounts was an investment 
fund pooled by several wealthy friends. Prosecutors maintain that 
Salinas used his influence and protected large-scale shipments through 
Mexico from Colombia to the United States. ``A great many witnesses'' 
testified that he had received hundreds of million of dollars in payoffs 
from Colombian and Mexican drug cartels between 1988 and 1994, when 
his brother was president, according to the federal prosecutor's office. 
The witnesses were not identified. Swiss authorities said their own 
criminal case was no longer necessary as Mexican authorites have started 
their own proceedings against Raul Salinas and others on charges of 
money laundering and facilitating drug trafficking. Authorities seized 
his Swiss bank accounts in 1995. Salinas is in prison in Mexico pending 
completion of his trials on charges of masterminding the 1994 murder 
of political rival Jose Francisco Ruiz Masseiu, and of illicit enrichment 
while he held a midlevel government post in his brother's administration. 
No drug-related charges have been brought against Raul Salinas, but 
he was acquitted of money laundering on a technicality. His brother, 
who moved to Ireland shortly after leaving office, has been charged 
with no crime.
