A Bavarian court on Tuesday upheld a lower court's order to deport 
a 14-year-old Turkish delinquent whose case became an election-year 
symbol for Germans demanding action against ``criminal foreigners.'' 
The Bavarian administrative court denied a defense appeal to force 
Munich city officials to renew the youth's residency permit. The decision 
clears the way for officials in the southern state to deport the boy, 
known simply as Mehmet, to Turkey. Mehmet was sentenced to one year 
in jail two weeks ago on a conviction of robbery and causing bodily 
harm. Though suspected of more than 60 offenses, he only has been 
tried for the one case _ the only one committed after he turned 14, 
the age of legal responsibility under German law. Munich officials 
had refused to renew the residency permit based on the 60 offenses, 
and the conviction only strengthened their case. German law allows 
deportation of any foreigner sentenced to a year or more in prison. 
The liberal Greens' party cited the Mehmet case as an example of problems 
in Germany's citizenship laws during election-year campaigning. Those 
laws are set to change under the incoming federal government of Social 
Democrats and Greens, to take office next week. The future partners 
on Tuesday signed an agreement that will grant automatic citizenship 
to some German-born foreigners to promote integration of the 7 million 
foreigners, including 2 million Turks, living here. Though born and 
raised in Germany, Mehmet would not be eligible for automatic citizenship 
under the proposed new laws. That right would be granted only to German-born 
foreigners who have at least one parent who is a permanent resident 
and was either born in Germany or has resided here since age 14.
