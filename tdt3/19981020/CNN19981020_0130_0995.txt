President Clinton has signed legislation to help businesses, organizations 
and local governments avoid potential problems with the Y2K computer 
glitch. The Bill creates a web site that offers information and links 
to the latest solutions. And it establishes limited liability protection 
so companies and organizations will share information on dealing with 
the Y2K problem without the fear of lawsuits.
