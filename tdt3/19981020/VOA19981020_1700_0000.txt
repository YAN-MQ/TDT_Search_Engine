Israeli-Palestinian summit has entered a new phase of very hard bargaining 
with President Clinton and Jordan's King Hussein on hand to mediate. 
Throughout the day, significant gaps were said to remain preventing 
an agreement, so the participants invited King Hussein to join those 
talks, and we'll have a report. The economy in Russia continues to 
be a pressing issue as a delegation from the International Monetary 
Fund arrives for talks with senior officials to work on an economic 
plan. And we'll hear how the city of San Antonio, Texas is coping 
with devastating killer floods. I'm Tom Crosby. And I'm Susan Yackee. 
We'll have details of those stories, sports, and business news. And 
we'll take a look at how real cowboys live in the American West, all 
ahead in this hour of VOA News Now. First a summary of World News.
