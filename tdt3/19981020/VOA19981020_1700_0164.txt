Gun fire has again been reported in the capital of Guinea-Bissau. 
Meanwhile, religious and political leaders continue to try and open 
a dialogue between the government and the rebels. But VOA's West Africa 
correspondent John Pitman reports that efforts appear to have been 
hampered by the violence. Details of the fighting in Guinea-Bissau's 
capital city, Bissau, remains sketchy. However, Portuguese news reports 
from the city say a barrage of artillery fire resumes Tuesday morning. 
It remains unclear which side broke the cease fire on Sunday or why. 
The government has accused the rebels of trying to infiltrate the 
city, however, the rebels have denied that charge saying it was the 
government and its Senegalese allies which shot first. Diplomats from 
the community of Portuguese-speaking countries have appealed for a 
return to calm. A local group of politicians and religious leaders 
is also working to reestablish a peaceful dialogue between the rival 
camps. However, the fighting has prevented the delegation led by the 
bishop of Bissau from crossing the front lines to hold talks with 
both sides. John Pitman, VOA News, West Africa bureau.
