Former heavyweight champ Mike Tyson will get another chance to regain 
his title. In a 4-1 vote the Nevada state boxing commission returned 
his boxing license Monday. Tyson lost his right to fight last year 
when he bit off a portion of evander Holyfield's ear during a match. 
Doctors released a report last week concluding Tyson probably would 
behave if he were allowed to step back in the ring.
