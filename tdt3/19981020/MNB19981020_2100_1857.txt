Hit by a devastating drought last summer, the state of Texas is hit 
by some of the worst flooding in half a century. Hardest hit, the 
area southwest of San Antonio. Jim Cummins is in Victoria, Texas, 
tonight. Dozens of rivers and streams in Texas are out of their banks 
tonight driving more than 7,000 people from their homes, flooding 
more than 60 counties from San Antonio to the gulf of Mexico. Today 
the city of Victoria, Texas, was swamped by plood water from the guadalupe 
river, hardest hit, old Victoria, worst flood here since 1936, city 
officials say. The river looks more like a lake, four miles wide in 
some places. At noon stella nava rushs to the water's edge to look 
for her stepson's house. It's gone. His house was on stilts, a little 
house. It's not there. The people who live in this neighborhood say 
at sunrise this morning the streets were dry. By noon, this place 
was a swamp. This woman's house is under water. We never really thought 
it would get in the house. We thought eight inches off the floor would 
save the furniture. It didn't. Police, the national guard have rescued 
scores of people trapped in their homes, including this man, who was 
reluctant to leave. In Houston, the water is still rising in some 
places on the brazos and San jacinto rivers. Today, three people in 
a tree had to be rescued by a boat. In San Antonio where the flooding 
began Saturday, rescue workers are still finding bodies. Today a 37-year-old 
man. This is just not the fun part of the job having to go in and 
find somebody that did not make it or we weren't able to get to in 
the first place. Victoria is now under curfew, and for now there is 
no rain in the forecast.
