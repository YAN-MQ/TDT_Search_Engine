Contact lenses have come a long way since they were first developed 
in 1887. But one thing that has remained unchanged over the years 
is the importance of properly cleaning and caring for contacts. It's 
best to follow the advice of an eye care practitioner. But some basic 
advice will prolong the life of the lenses and help protect your eyes 
from infection. Always wash your hands thoroughly and rinse off all 
traces of soap before handling a contact lens. Clean, rinse and disinfect 
your lenses every time you remove them. If appropriate, use a weekly 
enzyme treatment to remove protein deposits. Be sure to soak the lenses 
in disinfectant to prevent the enzyme from irritating your eyes. Keep 
your lenses from becoming contaminated by not touching the lens solution 
bottle to the lens. Discard any expired solution or solution that 
hasn't been used for more than 90 days. Replace your lens cases often. 
Contacts can be expensive, with a little effort you can protect your 
investment and the health of your eyes. For the latest health news
