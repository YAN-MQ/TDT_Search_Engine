In Washington today, the House of Representatives was having a final 
look at the $500 billion spending Bill that it's been negotiating 
with the White House. It takes a big effort for anyone to monitor 
it all. We're finding things in the highway Bill passed some months 
ago. ABC's John Martin found the latest right here on the western 
edge of manhattan. This is the west side highway. You just paid $80 
million to repair it. But guess what? You may soon have to spend $200 
million more to move it underground. why? Just so Donald trump, one 
of the country's wealthiest developers, can complete one of the biggest 
New York real estate deals of all time. It's abominable that we should 
be spending a nickel of taxpayers' money to move a highway for Mr. 
trump's benefit. It's more than a nickel. It will cost $6 million 
just to figure out the best way to bury the roadway. Once that study 
is completed, 18 high-rise apartment buildings will go up here. The 
first two are already up. Trump insists the project is a boon to the 
city because he is giving land for a park that will cover the highway 
right in front of his buildings. From a money standpoint, it's not 
even a good deal. From, for me -- ah, it's a park that should be built, 
because it's good for the people of New York. Isn't it a great deal 
for Donald trump? You enhance the property that you're putting up 
there. I enhance the property and I pay a big price to enhance the 
property. Well, not exactly. Opponent batya lewton says an obscure 
federal law just may allow trump to get a subsidy to build the park. 
When you give assistance to poor people, we call it "welfare." So 
this is welfare for the rich. All told, public assistance for trump 
place will be at least $200 million, not even counting the park. "It's 
your money." John Martin, ABC News, New York.
