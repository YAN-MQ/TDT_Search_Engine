Turkey and Turkmenistan have reached a preliminary agreement to build 
a natural gas pipeline. The deal will allow Turkmenistan to export 
its natural gas West across the Caspian Sea to Turkey. Under terms 
of the agreement, Turkey will be required to buy and transport up 
to $16 billion cubic meters of gas from Turkmenistan each year. Turkey 
currently relies heavily on Russia for its gas but is seeking to diversify 
its suppliers.
