The newspaper advertisements were supposed to underscore assurances 
that anyone who had a blood transfusion in the early part of the decade 
need not worry about having contracted an infectious disease. But 
the ads, which were placed by the New York Blood Center, may have 
had the opposite effect, since they caused a flood of calls from frightened 
blood recipients. The language of the advertisements, which appeared 
Tuesday in nine daily newspapers in the New York City region, was 
portentous. Under a large headline, ``To all who received blood from 
January 1991 to December 1996 in a New York/New Jersey hospital,'' 
they warned that ``there may have been a problem'' with the viral 
infections tests done during that period by the center, which provides 
about 80 percent of the blood used in New York City hospitals. As 
a result, blood recipients ``may face a potential risk of transfusion-transmitted 
infections, such as HIV and hepatitis,'' the advertisements said. 
Anyone concerned was encouraged to call (800) 688-0900 to arrange 
for free testing. In fact, the center's executives said, the advertisements 
were intended to reassure anyone with lingering fears stemming from 
a scandal at the center a year and a half ago, in which two employees 
were convicted and sentenced on charges of tampering with blood screening 
tests, creating false records and conspiracy. Although that tampering 
has not been found to have caused any diseases, the center executives 
said, they wanted to offer another check to anyone who received the 
blood. ``We have been doing intensive, sophisticated technical analysis, 
and to date, we have been unable to identify persons who were harmed,'' 
Dr. Robert Jones, president of the center, said. ``But as part of 
our commitment to the safety of blood supply and public health, we 
should go back out again to make sure people who have concerns have 
every opportunity to have it tested at our costs.'' Jones conceded 
that the advertisement might have been worded in a way that caused 
more fear than assurance. ``A message like this can engender some 
emotional response,'' he said. ``But if we were to have a very bland 
message where there was no concern at all, then people might not pay 
any attention to it.'' Although Jones said that the State Health Department 
and the Federal Food and Drug Administration had helped draft the 
advertisements, officials at both agencies said the center had placed 
the ads on its own and simply informed them that it was doing so. 
Last year, after the scandal left some chance that hospitals had received 
improperly screened blood, 4,800 pints were recalled. In addition, 
the president of the center, Dr. John Adamson, resigned. Jones also 
said the advertisement had been timed roughly with an FDA announcement 
that thousands of people would be notified that they might have caught 
hepatitis C from transfusions before blood purity testing began in 
1992. An added benefit, he added, would be the chance to ask callers 
for donations. ``We felt if we were to have our announcements at the 
same time, there would be increased public awareness,'' he said. The 
strategy seemed to work. At the center Tuesday, eight operators were 
kept busy with hundreds of calls from people who had seen the advertisement. 
``We are pretty maxed out,'' he said. ``But the message is not to 
panic.''
