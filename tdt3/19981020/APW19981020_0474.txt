A bank employee who revealed that President Franjo Tudjman's wife 
has huge, undeclared assets turned herself over to police after the 
report caused a nationwide stir, independent media said Tuesday. Ankica 
Lepej, 50, told the daily Jutarnji List last week that Ankica Tudjman 
had deposited dlrs 140,000 in Zagrebacka Banka in March. Police began 
a criminal investigation at the bank's request. If charged with breaching 
contracts of confidentiality and convicted, she faces a sentence of 
one to five years in prison. Lepej said she acknowledged late Monday 
disclosing the controversial information after the bank had posted 
a one million kuna (dlrs 166,000) reward to try to learn the source. 
The discovery of Mrs. Tudjman's wealth came only a month after her 
husband declared in a mandatory financial disclosure that his spouse 
had no considerable valuables apart from a car. Tudjman's office maintained 
in a statement late Monday that the president was not required to 
declare liquid assets. Lepej, a 23-year employee of the bank who is 
just 11 months shy of the pension, said she was offered the reward 
but turned it down so her colleagues wouldn't be harassed or come 
under extra scrutiny. She said she acted out of moral convictions. 
``The president's family should be an example,'' Lepej was quoted 
Tuesday as saying by Jutarnji List. ``I hope my example will inspire 
others to free themselves from fear and silence.'' Independent media 
have often exposed the involvement of top officials in corruption 
and financial scandals. However, the transgressions have mostly gone 
unpunished because the legal system is under the strong sway of Tudjman's 
ruling party. Most Croats subsist on less than dlrs 500 per month. 
The publicity over the bank account raised further doubts about the 
legality of fortunes amassed by Tudjman's family since the 76-year-old 
leader's tenure began in 1990. Although the founder of a humanitarian 
agency for children which turns over millions of unaccounted dollars 
per year, Ankica Tudjman is formally unemployed and receives a pension.
