Alan S. Donnahoe, a former president and chief executive of Media 
General, died Oct. 10 at his home in Richmond, Va. He was 82. The 
cause of death was heart disease, said his wife, Elsie Pitts Donnahoe. 
Donnahoe was the president and associate publisher of Richmond Newspapers 
in 1969, when he helped organize the Media General communications 
company, by combining Richmond Newspapers Inc. and the Tribune Co. 
of Tampa, Fla. Both companies were controlled by the Bryan family. 
Richmond Newspapers owned The Richmond Times-Dispatch and The Richmond 
News Leader, which merged in 1992. Tribune owned two Tampa newspapers 
and a television and radio station. Donnahoe was named president and 
chief executive of Media General Inc. when it was formed. During the 
next two decades, the company bought several regional newspapers, 
a newsprint company and television stations in the Southeast including 
Jacksonville, Fla., and Charleston, S.C. Media General also entered 
the cable industry in 1983, with Fairfax Cable. Donnahoe became vice 
chairman of Media General in 1982. He retired in 1984, but served 
as a consultant and remained vice chairman through 1990. Donnahoe 
served in the Army Corps of Engineers during World War II. He joined 
Richmond Newspapers in 1950, and, after serving in the Pentagon during 
the Korean War, he returned to the company and was named vice president 
for marketing in 1955. He became an executive vice president in 1959 
and president and associate publisher in 1966. In addition to his 
wife, he is survived by a daughter, Mrs. C. Porter Vaughan III, of 
Richmond.
