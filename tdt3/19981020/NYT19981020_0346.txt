Stock prices went on a wild ride Tuesday, soaring for most of the 
session only to retreat in the last hour or so of trading and end 
up narrowly mixed. The Dow Jones industrial average gained ground 
for the fifth consecutive session, the first time since June it has 
rallied for that many days in succession. The blue-chip index, which 
at one point during the morning was up 186 points, closed at 8,505.85, 
up 39.40 points, or slightly under one-half of a percent. It is the 
first time the Dow closed above 8,500 since Aug. 26. For the year, 
the 30-stoc index is up 7.6 percent. The broader Standard &AMP; Poor's 
500-stock index eked out a gain of 1.54 points, or a little more than 
0.1 percent, to 1,063.93. But the Nasdaq composite index fell 9.54 
points, or 0.6 percent, to 1,639.19. So far this year, the S&AMP;P 
500 has gained 9.5 percent; the Nasdaq is up 4.4 percent. Traders 
said business did not seem especially brisk Tuesday, but trading volume 
on the New York Stock Exchange was heavy at 954 million shares. As 
conditions in the equity markets stabilize, money continues to flow 
out of the bond market. The price of the benchmark 30-year bond fell 
by more than a point, and the yield rose 5.07 percent, from 4.97 percent. 
Short-term interest rates rose. While some stock investors apparently 
had second thoughts late in the session about the wisdom of holding 
highly liquid, well-known stocks, issues of smaller companies were 
popular all day. Traders said they were encouraged by the continued 
improvement in small caps, which have been battered so far this year. 
The Russell 2000 index, made up of small-company stocks, rose 5.86 
points, or 1.66 percent, to 358.31. And the New York Stock Exchange 
composite index gained 2.78 points, or 0.5 percent, to 528.28. ``There 
is enormous opportunity in small caps if we have stability here,'' 
said Michael Clark, head of U.S. stock trading at Credit Suisse First 
Boston. Clark and others said the market has run too far, too fast, 
and may be due for a selloff. And the rise in the Dow has indeed been 
dizzying: so far this month, it is up more than 10 percent, its best 
monthly showing since January 1987. Stocks got a big boost early in 
the day from several big banks, including Chase Manhattan and Wells 
Fargo, which reported third-quarter earnings that were better than 
expected. Chase, the nation's second-biggest bank, rose 1 15/16, to 
45 5/16 after it said it earned 82 cents a share in the period, 5 
cents a share better than the consensus forecast from Wall Street 
analysts. Wells Fargo, which is merging with the Norwest Corp., rose 
11 116, to 3789 16 after it said earnings rose 20 percent, which also 
exceeded expectations. The results encouraged investors to believe 
that the worst is over for the battered financial-services sector 
and helped to lift stocks of money center banks and brokerage firms. 
Citigroup rose 2 9/16, to 45 5/16. J.P. Morgan gained 2{, to 95]. 
Fueled by reports it might be acquired by Deutsche Bank AG, Europe's 
biggest bank, Bankers Trust gained 4], to 59[. And Merrill Lynch jumped 
2 7/16, to 54 13/16. ``At this point, just over one-third of the companies 
that make up the S&AMP;P have reported third-quarter earnings, and 
the good news is they have come in as expected, even though the bar 
was lowered,'' said Bob Gasser, head of block trading at J.P. Morgan 
&AMP; Co. ``But the bigger test will come after we are through this 
earnings season and people start looking out in the future, trying 
to determine when they will trough,'' he said. IBM gave investors 
reason to start thinking about the future. The computer company reported 
Tuesday that third-quarter earnings rose 10 percent, a number that 
exceeded Wall Street expectations. But the company gave analysts a 
cautious reading its prospects, saying that continued problems in 
Asia and Latin America and decreased spending by corporations on high-technology 
equipment could crimp profits in the fourth quarter and into 1999. 
IBM ended the day at 137~, down 1{. Early in the session, the stock 
traded as high as 142 7/16. ``We are going to have to contend with 
this sort of earnings picture for a couple of quarters to come,'' 
Clark of Credit Suisse First Boston said. ``We still have battles 
to fight, because people are not looking forward.''
