I'm meteorologist Dave Hennen with your "Headline News weather." A 
cool day today over the northern Great Lakes, only in the 30s and 
40s in many locations. And the cooler weather has already spread into 
the Rockies. As we head on over the next couple of days, the cooler 
air will be building in as high pressure builds in through the upper 
midwest, spreading the cold temperatures in from Canada. In fact, 
even cold enough that by late tomorrow, could see some rain and snow 
mixed through sections of the southern Great Lakes. Most of the wet 
weather will be in the southwest and into wet Texas, that's associated 
with some tropical moisture, which could bring some heavy rains in 
through that region. We check now your extended forecast -- we are 
looking for showers in portions of the Great Lakes during the day 
on Thursday. Scattered showers continue in the southwest. Cold temperatures 
will be spreading through much of the eastern half of the U.S. both 
Thursday and on into Friday, with 40 degree high temperatures for 
much of the northeast on Friday. Showers will be scattered in New 
England. By Saturday, it's dry, most of the U.S. cool temperatures 
continue from the Great Lakes all the way into the northeast. For 
more weather information, including four-day forecasts for 6,100 cities,
