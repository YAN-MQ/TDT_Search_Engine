The state department says the Middle East peace negotiations have 
entered a Stage of very hard bargaining. King Hussein of Jordan joined 
the talks today, and President Clinton canceled a trip to California 
in order to participate. Walter Rodgers has the latest. Both Israelis 
and Palestinians say President Clinton is exerting great pressure 
to close a Middle East peace agreement. Mr. Clinton seeking concessions 
from both sides. The president and the U.S. plays a unique role in 
helping the parties understand each other's position, helping to make 
the tough choices that need to be made. Israeli sources close to the 
talks expect a deal soon, although state department spokesman James 
Rubin said gaps remain to be closed. Helping nudge the parties together, 
Jordan's king Hussein, ailing, but determined to again be the dealmaker. 
It was king Hussein who helped break the 1997 deadlock before the 
hebron agreement. Jordan already has a peace agreement of its own 
with Israel. Mr. Clinton has been demanding compromises on both sides. 
Sources close to the talks say the president wants Israel to go ahead 
with a 13% land transfer to Palestinians. Additionally, he wants Israel 
to forfeit 14% of the West Bank, now under joint control, exclusively 
to the Palestinians. In return, Israel would get a tough security 
package from Arafat. Mr. Clinton is apparently pushing Arafat to arrest, 
if not extradite, 30 fugitives wanted by Israel and cancel clauses 
in the Palestinian charter offensive to Israel. One issue apparently 
will not be resolved here. Under the 1997 hebron agreement, Israel 
was required to make a third West Bank troop redeployment. Mr. Netanyahu 
has been resisting that. According to Palestinian sources, the issue 
has now been given to U.S. Middle East envoy Dennis Ross to solve. 
Recall this is the Middle East where an 11th hour crisis could yet 
derail an agreement. Still both sides, Israelis and Palestinians seem 
to be saying the finish line is in sight. Walter Rodgers, CNN, wye
