Taiwan's president, Lee Teng-hui has called for expanded dialogue 
with China but says Beijing must treat the breakaway island as an 
equal partner. Mr. Lee made the remark as he greeted senior Taiwanese 
envoy Kuton Fu who returned late Monday after a landmark visit to 
the mainland. The senior negotiator spent almost a week in China reopening 
the talks that were cut off in 1995. President Lee says the two sides 
can advance what he termed constructive dialogue only if they honestly 
face the reality of one China separately governed. Beijing has insisted 
Taiwan acknowledge Beijing as the soul authority over all of China. 
It has offered the island autonomy like that enjoyed by Hong Kong. 
Taipei resists those terms saying union is only possible after China 
becomes a multi-party democracy.
