The Clinton administration says there are still some significant gaps 
preventing an agreement at the Middle East summit meeting near Washington, 
so they invited King Hussein of Jordan to try to break the deadlock. 
Correspondent Kyle King reports. With the talks now in their sixth 
day and no sign of an agreement in sight, the White House has asked 
King Hussein to try to use his influence to bridge the differences 
between the Israelis and Palestinians. The 62-year-old king has been 
undergoing cancer treatment in Minnesota. State Department spokesman 
Jamie Rubin says the monarch can play a helpful and constructive role 
at he talks. We think he has a unique ability to bring home to the 
delegation the importance of making the tough choices necessary to 
achieve peace. President Clinton will also be meeting with the delegations 
again today after canceling a fund-raising trip to California. The 
talks are believed to be focused on an interim accord that would bring 
a further Israeli troop withdrawal from the West Bank in exchange 
for Palestinian security guarantees. In a telephone conference call 
with reporters this morning, State Department spokesman Jamie Rubin 
dismissed reports that a full or partial agreement was at hand. I 
would disagree with that characterization and tell you that in our 
view, there are still gaps, significant ones. Officials say there 
is no indication how long the marathon talks will continue, but they 
say King Hussein and President Clinton will spend the day meeting 
with participants. As far as the schedule, officials say they are 
taking things one day at a time. Kyle King, VOA News at Wye, Maryland.
