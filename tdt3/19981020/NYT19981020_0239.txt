If you called Rob Bartlett at the Eugene O'Neill Theater on Saturday 
during the matinee of the show he wrote and starred in, ``More to 
Love: A Big Fat Comedy,'' you got this message on his answering machine: 
``Hi, it's me. I can't take your call right now because I'm not in 
the dressing room, I'm onstage trying to find a last bit of dignity 
left. Or I'm somewhere in the basement of the theater, opening a vein.'' 
The reason for Bartlett's despondent message was that Saturday's performances 
quickly became the last; the show opened on Thursday, was panned by 
critics on Friday and closed after the evening performance on Saturday. 
Bartlett's experience seems to be a lesson in the risks of taking 
a ride on a new playwright. This fall several unknowns are seeing 
their work produced, namely Michael Chepiga and Mark Victor Olsen, 
who have plays opening on Broadway, and David Shaber, whose play is 
still searching for a home. Plays by obscure writers open all the 
time in the many small theaters around New York City. But it is unusual 
to see so many untested authors get a shot at the Great White Way, 
particularly given the cost of mounting a Broadway show. Moreover, 
these are not your typical fresh faces: young, hungry, starry-eyed. 
They are mostly middle-aged men, and sometimes older _ Shaber is 68 
_ who have regular careers. Bartlett, 41, is a comedian best known 
as Don Imus' sidekick on the radio. Chepiga, whose play, ``Getting 
and Spending,'' directed by John Tillinger, opens on Sunday at the 
Helen Hayes Theater, is a 50-year-old corporate lawyer. Olsen, whose 
play ``Cornelia'' is to open sometime in the spring, directed by Jerry 
Zaks in a yet-to-be-determined Broadway house, is a 44-year-old former 
corporate lawyer. And Shaber, whose play, ``Second Coming'' is in 
search of a theater, has spent 20 years writing screenplays. So why 
are producers gambling on these guys? To fill theaters? Because they're 
desperate? Mitchell Maxwell, one of the producers of ``More to Love,'' 
said he backed Bartlett because he believed in him _ and still does. 
And he insisted there was no cautionary tale in his predicament. ``If 
we give up the desire and the passion that's supposed to fuel the 
theater by saying, `Oh my God, the last time out I got bludgeoned 
to death,' then what do we get?'' he said. ``Disney and `Beauty and 
the Beast' and conglomerates who are only interested in selling merchandise 
and creating multiple companies for the road.'' One would expect, 
in this competitive climate, that playwrights would be positively 
giddy about having their work produced, on Broadway, no less. Instead, 
for nearly all of them, enthusiasm is clearly tempered by a sober 
realism; they've been around, and they know that what happened to 
Bartlett can happen to them. They say they hope for the best but sound 
prepared for the worst. ``Maybe I'm fatalistic in that I think what 
will be will be,'' said Chepiga, wearing a yellow tie decorated with 
kites. ``I've had a good life, a varied life; I love my wife and kids. 
I could not foresee the path that this play took, so I have no idea 
what the future will bring.'' Chepiga's road to play writing has been 
particularly circuitous. He started out planning to become a Franciscan 
priest, dropped out to attend Fordham University, taught at Washington 
Irving High School in Manhattan and at La Guardia Community College 
in Long Island City by day while he got a Ph.D. in English at New 
York University at night, then went on to Yale Law School and clerked 
for two federal judges in Manhattan. For 17 years he has specialized 
in securities law and mergers and acquisitions at the firm Simpson 
Thacher &AMP; Bartlett. He said he continues to practice not just 
because he has to but also because he wants to. ``I'm so used to juggling 
both,'' Chepiga said. ``I enjoy it, and it's never been a question 
before of doing only writing. It was something else I did.'' It is 
his day job that has enabled Chepiga to put two children through New 
York City's private schools and to take ski vacations. In fact, it 
was on a ski vacation that Chepiga began to write ``Getting and Spending,'' 
a drama about an investment banker who goes on trial for insider trading. 
As the only member of his family who does not like to ski, he stayed 
in the condominium to write. He had spent summers at the Eugene O'Neill 
Playwrights Conference in 1978 and 1980, so he had some idea of what 
he was doing. By the end of the vacation Chepiga had 13 handwritten 
pages. He dropped the project until a year later, during the next 
ski vacation. This time he finished the play, and spent the next few 
months refining it late at night or on weekends until 1995, when he 
submitted it in a play writing competition and won. The play, shepherded 
by the producer Martin Markinson, has had readings in New York and 
Florida and was produced at the Old Globe Theater in San Diego over 
the summer before moving to New York. Olsen has been working on his 
play for nine years, ever since he stumbled on a collection of essays 
from the 1975-76 presidential campaign while poking around the public 
library. It eventually became ``Cornelia,'' a play about Cornelia 
Wallace, the second wife of Gov. George Wallace of Alabama. Olsen 
said the play paralleled his own childhood in Oregon and Nebraska 
in a rigid household. Having attended the Democratic National Convention 
at age 15 with the McGovern campaign, Olsen thought he would wind 
up in electoral politics, that he would be Oregon's U.S. senator. 
He started out as a lawyer but, at age 30, decided to leave law and 
move to Latin America, where he spent the next eight years trying 
freelance journalism before moving back to New York to write plays. 
``Cornelia'' got its start at the Ensemble Studio Theater's Oktoberfest 
presentation of new works in 1990 and is being produced by Fran and 
Barry Weissler. ``There is such a thing as hopes being dashed that 
I'm very wary of,'' said Olsen, a tall lanky man who wears a ring 
on his index finger. ``So to the extent that this is moving forward 
and will reach some fruition, I am excited.'' Bartlett's story seemed 
like a fairy tale until its recent unhappy ending. He was performing 
his stand-up comedy act in the Copa Room of the Sands Hotel in Las 
Vegas two and a half years ago, and after the show Maxwell, the producer, 
went backstage. ``He was spectacular, he was fresh and he was funny 
and he was politically incorrect in the right way,'' Maxwell said. 
``I said, `Let's turn this into a play.''' Bartlett kicked around 
several ideas and finally came up with the subject he knew best: his 
own life. So he wrote a comedy about a middle-aged stand-up comedian 
living on Long Island who is trying to make it big. The play, ``More 
to Love,'' featured Bartlett as himself, Dana Reeve as his wife and 
Joyce Van Patten as his agent. Bartlett said the play's themes grew 
out of his own midlife crisis: ``I was facing my 40th birthday and 
really taking stock.'' A friendly, heavy-set man born in Brooklyn, 
Bartlett describes himself as a nerdy kid who used to put on Beatles 
records and pretend he was one, was chosen last in football and made 
up for being unpopular by being funny. From age 10 on, Bartlett grew 
up on Long Island, where he and his wife now live with their three 
children. He wrote little one-act plays as a child _ ``Mystery on 
Skull Island'' was one of his fifth-grade works _ majored in English 
and theater at Alfred University in upstate New York, and got started 
in stand-up comedy at the White House Inn on Long Island, the place 
where Eddie Murphy began. In an interview this fall, Bartlett said, 
``I really feel as if it's all been working up to this.'' Now, after 
his brief Broadway debut, he said: ``Obviously, it's a sad thing. 
But I'm proud of the work. I hold my head up high.'' For Shaber, too, 
this would seem to be the moment he's been waiting for. His play, 
``Second Coming,'' about a disgraced former attorney general and the 
ousted president who betrayed him, was written in 1983. It had a troubled 
production under a different title, ``Bunker Reveries,'' at the Roundabout 
Theater about 12 years ago. One producer, Gene Wolsk, a friend for 
more than 40 years, recently decided it was worth another try. ``Thank 
God he likes this play,'' Shaber said. ``Second Coming'' is to open 
sometime this season; Wolsk said the Manhattan Theater Club was considering 
it. ``Trying to find a theater is like 16 different kinds of a nightmare,'' 
Shaber said. Yet Shaber does not seem discouraged. Over a plate of 
potatoes with his breakfast coffee, Shaber said theater was all he 
had ever loved. It was long ago that he abandoned plans to go to medical 
school, attended Yale Drama School and moved to New York to be a playwright. 
By writing films _ ``Rollover'' with Jane Fonda and ``Nighthawks'' 
with Sylvester Stallone _ he has been able to live with his wife in 
New York and raise two daughters, now grown. ``It all depends what 
bug bites you when you're 11 or 12 years old,'' Shaber said. ``If 
the theater bug bites you, you can never get over it. If you feel 
that way, having a play done in New York _ there's simply nothing 
like it.'' At the same time, Shaber does not even venture to call 
this his big break. He has been around too long for that. ``I think 
if you wait for breaks you're in trouble,'' he said. ``Maybe once 
upon a time, in the 1930s, it was possible to become an overnight 
sensation, but does that really happen anymore?''
