North African and new age are terms that are not usually uttered in 
the same breath, but musician Pascal Perez is shown that it's a combination 
that actually works pretty well. THE WORLD's Marco Worman has more. 
For centuries, the Moroccan coastal city of Esojuerda has played host 
to a succession of visitors. Hundreds of years ago, it was the destination 
of Jews fleeing the Spanish inquisition. Much later, in the 1950s, 
writer Paul Bowles there to record Moroccan music for the Library 
of Congress. In the '60s, hippies and hash fiends made it their mecca. 
Today, it's a center for wind surfing, and it was Esojuerda that Algerian 
born musician Pascal Perez chose as a locale to record his debut solo 
CD, "Blueprint." Pascal Perez is better known to the hep cats of European 
music as Emotep. He's recorded several albums with the hip-hop band 
he fronts in Marseilles, IAM, an acronym that stands for Imperial 
Asiatic Men. The drum and base that Emotep brought to IAM comes thumping 
through on "Blueprint" over the layers of Moroccan flutes or neras 
and talawats, and a dreamy soundscape of synthesized North African 
ambiance. Emotep has managed to create musak with a hip sound sensibility. 
You can let his stuff roll in the background or sit down and actually 
listen to it. Emotep's music may sound techy but it has its roots 
in trance, the ancient essence of North African music. One of Emotep's 
primary influences is the trance music of the Ganowa, a Moroccan religious 
brotherhood whose members are descendants of Sub Saharan African slaves. 
The fugue-like rhythms of traditional Ganowa trance music functioned 
not as entertainment but as healing therapy. And just to remind us 
where we are, Emotep begins "Blueprint" with street sounds from Esojuerda. 
Before it was a refuge for Jews, hippies, and musicians, Esojuerda 
was and remains the capital of North African trance music. That you 
can even hear in the streets. For THE WORLD, this is Marco Worman.
