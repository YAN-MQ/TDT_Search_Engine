An attorney for Paula Jones has asked the U.S. appeals court to reinstate 
her sexual harassment lawsuit against President Clinton saying critical 
evidence in the case was ignored. The plaintiff and defense presented 
their arguments in St. Paul, Minnesota today after the effort to settle 
the charges out of court failed. Ms. Jones says Mr. Clinton made crude 
sexual advances to her back in 1991 when he was governor of Arkansas 
and she was a state employee. Mr. Clinton has called the charge bogus. 
Last April, an Arkansas judge dismissed the lawsuit as unsubstantiated, 
but the attorney for Ms. Jones, James Fisher, said the judge ignored 
evidence that a hostile work environment was created for his client.
