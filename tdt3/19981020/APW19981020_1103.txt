Francisco Narvaez Machon Kiko scored twice for Atletico Madrid's 4-2 
victory Tuesday over local CSKA in the first leg of the second round 
UEFA cup tournament. Atletico's defender Stefano Torrisi opened the 
scoring in the 41st minute with a high shot that found the CSKA goalie 
Ivailo Ivanov unprepared. A minute and a half later Osvaldo Giroldo 
Junior Juninho sneaked through the CSKA defense and passed the ball 
to Kiko, who scored from a short distance. In the 53rd minute CSKA 
forward Boncho Genchev used a mistake by Atletico's goalie Pedro Luis 
Jaro to up the score 2-1. Bolstered by Genchev's goal, CSKA launched 
a series of attacks, but in 75th minute Atletico's Roberto Fresnedoso 
Pietro scored with a header. In the 87th minute, Kiko eliminated CSKA 
defense with a solo action that sealed Atletico's victory with a goal 
from a small angle. The match, played at the Balgarska Armia stadium, 
was attended by some 25,000 people.
