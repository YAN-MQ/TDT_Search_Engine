With "Headline Sports," I'm Russell Biven. They are still scoreless 
in game three of the world series. Both pitchers look fantastic. Hitchcock 
for the padres and cone has a no-hitter for the Yankees. Meanwhile, 
the Indians who lost to New York in the alcs picked up a $3 million 
contract option on shortstop Omar vizquel through the year 2002. It's 
already been a busy off season for Sammy Sosa. Today the slugger flew 
into the Dominican republic for the first time since blasting 66 home 
runs. Sosa plans to help his country in the relief efforts after it 
was devastated by hurricane georges.
