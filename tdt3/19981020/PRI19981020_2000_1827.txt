For THE WORLD, this is Pamela McCall in the BBC newsroom in London. 
King Hussein of Jordan has joined President Clinton and Israeli and 
Palestinian leaders at the peace talks in Maryland which are in their 
sixth day. The king has been in close touch with talks from the Minnesota 
clinic where he's being treated for cancer. U.S. State Department 
spokesman James Rubin said the U.S. has invited the king to help persuade 
the two sides to make the tough choices for peace. Since the meeting 
that the president and the secretary had with Chairman Arafat and 
Prime Minister Netanyahu yesterday, clearly we're into a phase of 
very hard bargaining. A lot of the under brush has been cleared away, 
and it's a part of the end game that is getting more and more serious. 
State Department spokesman James Rubin.
