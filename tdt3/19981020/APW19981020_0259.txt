Russia has a vested interest in ensuring stability in the Asia-Pacific 
region, particularly in avoiding a nuclear arms race, Russian Defense 
Minister Igor Sergeyev said Tuesday. Sergeyev, speaking to Russian 
reporters after his arrival in Hanoi to start a three-nation trip, 
pointed out that two-thirds of his country's territory lies in Asia. 
``The development dynamics of the Asian Pacific are making the region 
one of the most important political and economic centers of the world,'' 
Russia's Interfax news agency quoted him as saying. ``Unfortunately, 
sources of tension and potential conflicts still remain in Asia, primarily 
because territorial, ethnic and other clashes have not been settled.'' 
Sergeyev is spending two days in Vietnam, which the former Soviet 
Union supported during its protracted war against the U.S.-backed 
government in what used to be South Vietnam before the nation was 
reunified in 1975. Although ties between Russia and Vietnam are nowhere 
near as close as they used to be, there have been increasing signs 
of an improved climate in relations. The Vietnamese are interested 
in Russian weaponry to modernize their military, along with spare 
parts. The ITAR-Tass news agency says Hanoi is planning to buy up 
to 24 Su-27 jet fighters worth about dlrs 800 million, along with 
MiG-29s, patrol and torpedo boats and Molnia-class missile-firing 
vessels. Sergeyev was to confer Tuesday afternoon with Vietnamese 
Defense Minister Pham Van Tra on the future of the Cam Ranh air base, 
a former U.S. naval base rented to the Soviet navy in 1979. Russia 
and Vietnam signed an agreement in 1993 allowing the Russian navy 
to continue using the base until 2004. Hanoi wants to renegotiate 
the deal, saying Russia has reduced the amount of arms it gives Vietnam 
as compensation for using the base. Sergeyev also is to visit China 
and India. He indicated that the latter stop will include talks on 
a possible nuclear arms race between India and Pakistan, both of which 
exploded test bombs earlier this year. He said he also was concerned 
about the spread of missile technology and ``the attempts of the United 
States to involve some Asian countries in joint development of an 
anti-missile defense theater,'' Interfax reported. ``In our opinion, 
the fulfillment of such intentions in the future may shift the balance 
of power in the region,'' he said.
