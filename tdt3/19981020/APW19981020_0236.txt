The hub cap heist had an ill-fitting _ but happy _ ending. After discovering 
recently that a thief had removed her car's wheel covers, a woman 
from this southern Dutch village reported the theft to police and 
thought little more of it, the daily De Telegraaf reported Tuesday. 
Until this week, that is, when the hub caps were anonymously returned 
to their owner with a note saying: ``You're lucky. They didn't fit.'' 
The woman's name was not reported by the newspaper.
