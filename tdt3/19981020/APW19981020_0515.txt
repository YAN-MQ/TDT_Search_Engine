It could be a bad omen for the Wye summit. A plane chartered by a 
prominent rabbi to encircle Israel seven times and deliver prayers 
for the successful conclusion of the Mideast peace talks was forced 
to make an emergency landing. A little more than an hour into Monday's 
flight, the small plane's electrical system malfunctioned. ``We changed 
the subject of the prayers from the plight of the Israeli people to 
our plight,'' said Yitzhak Batsri, the son of Rabbi David Batsri and 
one of four passengers aboard. ``My father ... called out the names 
of chapters in Psalms, chapters named after angels, and then he asked 
them to come and help,'' the younger Batsri said. The pilot eventually 
brought the plane down safely in northern Israel, and Yitzhak Batsri 
said the passengers' deliverance was proof that a similar miracle 
could happen at the Wye talks.
