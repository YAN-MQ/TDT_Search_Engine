Now no American influence in Kosovo. It is a week since the U.S. and 
NATO pressured the Serbian leader, Slobodan milosevic, to end the 
Serb violence against the ethnic Albanians there. Today the Pentagon 
said we have not seen full compliance or anything close to it. Sheila 
MacVicar is in Kosovo tonight. This is what the first American and 
European monitors are seeing as they drive throughout Kosovo. Past 
miles of destroyed and empty villages, Serb police checkpoints where 
traffic is stopped and identity papers checked. On hilltops, fortified 
Serb positions, and sometimes Serb armored vehicles -- Dozens of tanks 
and heavy weapons dug in and camouflaged. These certainly look like 
violations of the agreement. The problem is, the agreement itself 
is so short on specifics, western monitors cannot say what is a violation 
and what is not. I think that this is going to have to be worked out 
on a case-by-case basis. With officials still trying to sort out just 
what the deal means, the bottom line is that the ethnic Albanian refugees 
are supposed to feel safe enough to go home and stay home. But that 
is not happening either. "The Serb police are just up there," this 
man says, "and they have a new checkpoint down there." And for the 
last several nights, the Serbs have shelled these villages. So while 
people have been coming home in the morning, every night people leave 
the village and go back to the mountains. I was really disappointed 
to come back after the agreement was signed. I expected to see an 
improvement. The agreement has done virtually nothing to change the 
Serb position, that they have the right to deploy their forces as 
they see fit. Sheila MacVicar, ABC News, Kosovo.
