At last there's a liar we can all root for. Her name is Riley Weston 
_ though she was born Kimberlee Kramer _ and last week she was pilloried 
in the fiercely moral town of Hollywood, where she is a TV actress 
and writer. Her crime: having gulled her producers, agents and lawyers 
into believing she was 19 when in fact she turns out to be an old 
lady of 32. Ms. Weston, who has the acting ability and looks to play 
a teen-ager, had pulled her ruse to land a role most recently on ``Felicity,'' 
the heavily promoted would-be ``Ally McBeal'' of the new season, and 
then to get writing assignments for it and other TV projects. Now 
she twists in the wind. Touchstone, the Disney division that lately 
signed her to a $300,000 writing contract, is considering dumping 
Ms. Weston _ surely not because she's suddenly lost her writing talent. 
Her real sin may have been to make TV executives look like fools who, 
as Newsweek put it, ``wouldn't know a real teen-ager if one walked 
in the door.'' When I spoke to Ms. Weston this week, she said she 
``felt terrible'' about hurting the feelings of those she duped. But 
she added unapologetically: ``I lied to get an acting job _ to get 
my foot in the door. That's it.'' As she reached her late 20s _ she 
has been acting on network TV for almost a decade _ she found that 
casting agents wouldn't even allow her to audition for teen-age roles 
she knew she could play. So she changed her name, dropped old credits 
from her resume and reinvented herself, like actors of both sexes 
since the dawn of show biz. Also like her predecessors, she found 
that shrewd self-marketing ignited the hype of show-biz journalism: 
Entertainment Weekly, more correctly than it may have foreseen, put 
her on this summer's ``It List'' of the 100 most creative people in 
entertainment. Why, then, is Ms. Weston vilified for an age-old ``crime''? 
One producer says she is resented for having successfully dropped 
so many years from her age, rather than the standard few. But her 
real offense may be to have focused attention, however inadvertently, 
on the accelerating pathology of Hollywood's perennial worship of 
youth, especially female youth _ and its fallout into the culture 
imbibed by us all. It is pandering to teen-agers and the barely adult, 
the holiest demographic, that has led to phenomena like Fox's ``Miniskirt 
Monday,'' so breathlessly promoted during the World Series over the 
weekend. And that has increasingly led studios to match male stars 
nearing or over 60, from Harrison Ford to Warren Beatty, with nearly 
intern-age love interests from Anne Heche to Halle Berry, in every 
romance-minded movie. ``By their early 30s women are passe, unless 
they're Meryl Streep,'' says one woman producer. Or as a line famously 
had it in ``The First Wives Club,'' there are only three ages for 
women in Hollywood _ ``babe, district attorney and `Driving Miss Daisy.''' 
That this obsession would affect not just on-camera Hollywood players 
but those off-camera is the unsavory recent evolution dragged into 
the light by Ms. Weston's hoax. Though it's hard to imagine a producer 
insisting that only elderly writers write elderly characters or only 
black writers write blacks, Ms. Weston discovered that casting-couch 
youthfulness, not just her talent, could bring her writing as well 
as acting gigs on ``young'' projects. Were she 32, she might not get 
a meeting with middle-aged TV executives panting for the next hot 
young voice. Larry Gelbart _ co-author of ``Tootsie,'' the movie about 
an actor who makes himself into a woman to land a TV role _ knows 
colleagues who won't list their credits from his classic series ``M.A.S.H.'' 
on their resumes ``because it dates them'' in an industry where ``inexperience 
is a prized asset.'' He finds the hypocritical self-righteousness 
attending Ms. Weston's case laughable. ``Everyone here lies about 
everything,'' he says. ``They have their faces changed. They have 
their photos airbrushed. They lie about their last salaries. They're 
probably being interviewed by somebody who just lost a Pulitzer Prize 
because of lying.'' He wonders if Ms. Weston ``is dying for all our 
lies.'' That remains to be seen. In the meantime, you can see her 
last performance as a teen-ager on the Nov. 17 ``Felicity.'' After 
that, she'll suffer what in Hollywood is a fate worse than death _ 
middle age.
