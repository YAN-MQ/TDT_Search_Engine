The Securities and Exchange Commission has charged 37 brokerage firms 
with failing to abide by SEC rules and disclose what they know and 
how they're preparing to deal with computer glitches in the year 2000. 
NPR's Kathleen Chalk reports. This is the first enforcement action 
the SEC has taken since the rules went into effect. SEC Chairman Arthur 
Levitz said investors have the right to know what steps their brokers 
have taken to address possible computer failures that could affect 
their investments. Broker dealers are supposed to provide information 
about how they're getting ready for the end of the millennium and 
what contingency plans they've made in case their computers don't 
work properly. The SEC says it needs this information to identify 
potential problems and gauge the industry's overall readiness. Nineteen 
of the 37 firms charged have agreed to settlement offers including 
censures and fines ranging from 5- to $25,000, depending on how much 
of the required paperwork they fail to turn in. Kathleen Chalk, NPR 
News, Washington.
