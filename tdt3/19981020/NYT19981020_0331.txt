IBM reported a 10 percent increase in third-quarter earnings Tuesday 
because of stronger computer sales, but the company's executives warned 
that global economic uncertainty could lead to short-term problems 
in the months ahead. IBM, the world's largest computer company, posted 
a profit of $1.49 billion, or $1.56 a diluted share, compared with 
$1.36 billion, or $1.35 a share, in the quarter a year earlier. Revenue 
for the period increased 8 percent, to $20.1 billion. The results 
were slightly above analysts' expectations of $1.53 a share, and the 
anticipation of a strong quarter had pushed the company's stock up 
$10 over the last week, to a new 52-week intraday high of $142.4375 
Tuesday before retreating. The stock fell $1.50, to $137.875, before 
the third-quarter earnings were announced. Behind the numbers is a 
mixed business story. The company's sales of hardware, from its giant 
mainframes to personal computers, increased by 4.2 percent, to $8.7 
billion. This is a turnaround from the first half of 1998, when a 
glut of personal computers and delays in mainframe purchases hurt 
sales. The company's information technology services segment, which 
provides software and computer equipment services to corporations, 
was also strong, with revenue rising by 22.6 percent, to $5.7 billion. 
(IBM does not release earnings results for individual business segments.) 
The company attributed this rise to a desire by corporations to improve 
computer-related business efficiencies when faced with an economic 
downturn. On the negative side, however, was a decline in business 
in Asia and Latin America along with continued problems in the company's 
microelectronics business, which reflects severe price competition 
in the manufacture of computer memory chips. ``While IBM is entering 
the fourth quarter with some real momentum,'' said Louis Gerstner 
Jr., the company's chairman and chief executive, ``we are facing a 
number of significant short-term issues, including an uncertain global 
economic environment, ongoing weaknesses in some parts of Asia and 
Latin America and continued price pressures in semiconductors.'' With 
strong earnings against a backdrop of business uncertainty, IBM's 
chief financial officer, Douglas Maine, warned in a conference call 
with analysts against overly optimistic fourth-quarter earnings estimates. 
``While we are pleased with our strong third-quarter performance,'' 
he said, ``economic uncertainties should lead to a conclusion not 
to raise earnings estimates.'' David Takata, an analyst at Gruntal 
&AMP; Co., said: ``The good news is that IBM wasn't hit as bad as 
what the worst fears might have indicated. I'm conservative, and I've 
expected the company to get hit with some economic fallout. But it 
just hasn't happened yet.'' Gary Helmig, an analyst at Soundview Technology 
Group, said, ``Loud and clear, we got a lot of good news.'' ``They 
certainly had a strong revenue performance and they are well positioned 
in Europe and North America for a sustained performance,'' he added. 
``Still, with currency risks and with the world economic scene, we'd 
all be better off to watch and see how it unfolds rather than taking 
the good news of the moment and increasing our expectations. That's 
the prudent approach.'' With a cost reduction program in place, most 
of the increase in revenue fell to the bottom line. Still, the company's 
gross profit margin of 37.2 percent in the 1998 third quarter fell 
slightly, compared with 38.2 percent in the quarter a year earlier.
