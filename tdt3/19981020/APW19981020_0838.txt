A retired Russian naval officer accused of high treason pleaded innocent 
Tuesday at the opening of his long-awaited trial, and the judge evicted 
most of the public after a half-hour, a defense lawyer said. Alexander 
Nikitin is accused of giving secret documents to a Norwegian environmental 
group, the Bellona Foundation, which compiled a 1996 report criticizing 
the handling of nuclear waste and reactors in Russia's Northern Fleet. 
Nikitin pleaded that he was ``not in any way guilty,'' though he told 
the judge he did not understand the charges against him, said Ivan 
Pavlov, a lawyer working in Nikitin's defense team. The Defense Ministry 
decrees that Nikitin is accused of breaking have never been published 
and were shown to his lawyers for the first time Tuesday. Pavlov said 
that some parts of the decrees were old and not valid under Russia's 
constitution, but provided no other details about them. Nikitin's 
lawyers have long argued that under the Constitution, criminal charges 
cannot be filed on the basis of unpublished laws. Nikitin and Bellona 
also maintain that the information used in compiling their report 
came from public records. Human rights groups criticized Judge Sergei 
Golets' decision to close the court proceedings. ``To close the trial 
at the outset ... is a tactical mistake because it will guarantee 
increased public outrage,'' said environmental lawyer Stephen Kass, 
a member of the board of directors of Human Rights Watch. Nikitin 
was not discouraged by the judge's decision. ``The court was in a 
difficult position,'' he said after court adjourned for the day. ``I 
think that everything will be all right.'' His lawyer, Yuri Schmidt, 
was also positive. ``We are feeling completely confident ... because 
we are speaking the truth, and as one (author Mikhail) Bulgakov hero 
said, speaking the truth is a pleasant and easy thing to do.'' The 
maximum penalty for high treason is 20 years in prison. Prosecutors 
are asking for 12 to 20 years, the Interfax news agency said. A crowd 
of supporters greeted Nikitin outside the courtroom Tuesday morning. 
Dressed in a gray suit, the 46-year-old former navy captain looked 
tense as he answered preliminary questions from the judge. Golets 
then closed proceedings, although a handful of people including Russian 
parliamentary deputy Alexander Shishlov, who is observing the trial 
on behalf of the Council of Europe, were allowed to remain. Prosecutors 
then read the indictment, which ran over 30 pages. Nikitin's lawyers 
said they will push for parts of the case to be open later. Golets 
said proceedings will be closed at least while Nikitin is questioned 
by the court. Nikitin's trial comes at the same time as proceedings 
against Capt. Grigory Pasko, a Russian military reporter accused of 
passing secrets about the Russian Pacific Fleet onto Japanese media. 
Pasko maintains that the documents simply detailed environmental problems 
at several Russian Pacific Fleet bases.
