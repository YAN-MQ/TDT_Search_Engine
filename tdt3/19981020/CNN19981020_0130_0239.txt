At least 90 people were arrested during a protest in New York against 
hate crimes and the beating death of a gay Wyoming college student. 
Mayor Rudy guliani said it began as a peaceful vigil with about 200 
people but turned into a March down fifth avenue by 4,000 protesters. 
Police said most of the arrests were for disorderly conduct. Matthew 
shepard died last week after he was found beaten and tied to a Fence. 
Two men are charged in his killing.
