Tonight we are going to take another look at the expanding role of 
the internet in so many people's lives. You hear it all the time now, 
people saying to one another, "looking for medical information? Try 
the Internet." Two surveys we have seen referred to say that nearly 
40% of the people who use the Internet are seeking medical information. 
In fact, there is so much advice out there, and so many products now 
that the "journal of the American medical association" has dedicated 
this week's issue to it. Our intention tonight is to take "A closer 
look" at how reliable it all is. So first, here is ABC's John MacKenzie. 
The Internet can be a treasure CHESTst medical news T once took days 
rummaging through a library to find what you can now pull up in a 
Matter of seconds. Anybody with $19.95 can have a web site. They can 
put anything they want on it. So you can't take things you find on 
the web at face value. A novice, who has just come there who doesn't 
really know much about medicine, health or the Internet, can really 
get bushwhacked badly. "the journal of the American medical association" 
suggests four basic criteria in evaluating any health news you get 
online -- who are the authors? Where do they work, what are their 
credentials? Is the information current and who owns the web site? 
In other words, who stands to profit? Go with a trusted brand name. 
You can trust the national institute of health, the centers for disease 
control. You can trust the American medical association. You can trust 
"the New England journal of medicine," among others. But web sites 
from these "established stugss ""still seem to use language -- and 
medical controversies. Using the Internet for health news seems to 
be a learning process for those at home trying to sort out what's 
of true value. John McKenzie, ABC News, New York.
