Dana corp., one of the world's largest auto parts suppliers, is cutting 
3,500 jobs or nearly 4.5% of its workforce. Dana will also close 15 
plants as it tries to focus more closely on its parts distribution 
business. The cuts should save the company $575 million over the next 
two years. The announcement follows Dana's $3.9 billion purchase of 
auto partsmaker echlin in July that was one of the biggest mergers 
ever in the auto parts industry. Dana shares were down about a point 
today, to 39 1/2.
