NATIONAL FORECAST Snow with lightning and thunder occurred at elevations 
above 10,000 feet in the western Colorado Rockies Tuesday as high-level 
moisture continued to stream into the West from the tropics. Wednesday, 
moisture will make inroads into the interior West at both high- and 
low-levels as a weak upper-level low pressure system over California 
summons a broad southerly flow of moist winds into Utah, New Mexico 
and Arizona. Scattered rains will develop, with totals of an inch 
or more possible in the Rockies as moist low-level winds from the 
southeast are forced to ascend the sloping terrain. Over the southern 
half of Florida, scattered showers and thunderstorms will develop 
as moist winds from the east continue unabated. A few showers and 
storms will produce moderate to locally heavy rains. The chilliest 
air mass of the season will spread eastward from the Great Lakes to 
the northern and central Appalachians on Wednesday. Chilly showers 
will form downwind of Lake Erie and Lake Ontario as Canadian air is 
moistened in transit over tepid lake waters. Snow may mix with rain 
at high elevations of northwest Pennsylvania later in the day. Generally 
light accumulations are possible at night. Snow is also possible later 
in the day and at night from the highest elevations of West Virginia 
and western Maryland to the mountains of northern New England. Increasingly 
chilly air will spill east of the mountains to the Northeast and northern 
Middle Atlantic Seaboards on gusty winds from the west-northwest averaging 
15 to 25 mph. Focus: Winter Falters For the moment, winter lost its 
grip on the panhandle of Alaska on Tuesday as newly fallen snow in 
the mountains near Juneau melted away under a fierce assault of warm 
air. But the cost of surging Pacific warmth was high. Winds gusted 
to 64 mph at the federal building in downtown Juneau early Tuesday, 
while the capital city's 24-hour rainfall ending at 4 a.m. was 3.36 
inches, with heavy rain still falling. Downpours came after recurrent 
rains over the weekend, leading to flood warnings. The threat of mudslides 
mounted on mountains just recently blanketed in white.
