A French court has decided to free the doctor of the Festina cycling 
team jailed during the doping scandals surrounding this year's Tour 
de France. Eric Rykhart of Belgium, who has been in jail since July 
17th was released after paying bail of about $18,000. He'll remain 
under judicial surveillance. Rykhart has admitted the Festina team 
used doping products, although star rider, Rareshard Veronk, continues 
to deny that he knowingly took any such substances. Festina team director 
Bruno Rousell and Masury Willevote are also under investigation.
