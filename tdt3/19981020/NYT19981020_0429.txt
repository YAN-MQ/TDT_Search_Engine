Edmond A. Levy, an Academy Award-winning documentarian, died on Oct. 
10 at St. Rose's Home in Manhattan. He was 69 and lived in Manhattan. 
The cause was cancer, his stepson William H. Judson said. Levy wrote, 
produced and directed more than 120 documentary films. He won an Oscar 
in 1966 for ``A Year Toward Tomorrow,'' a documentary short about 
the Vista volunteer program. Two other short films, ``While We Run 
This Race'' and ``Beyond Silence,'' brought him Academy Award nominations. 
He also directed ``Mom, the Wolfman and Me,'' a feature film starring 
Patty Duke. His television work included writing and directing films 
for NBC, CBS and ABC as well as PBS and the Disney Channel. Born in 
Toronto, Levy moved with his family to Buffalo, N.Y. He was a graduate 
of Harvard University and studied acting at the Yale Drama School 
and directing at the Actors Studio in New York. He was the author 
of ``Making a Winning Short.'' In addition to William Judson, of New 
York City, he is survived by his wife, Denise; two sons, Jonathan, 
of San Francisco, and Jeremy, of Pittsburgh; two other stepsons, Stephen 
Judson, of New York City, and Peter Judson, of Los Angeles; a sister, 
Kay Michaels, of New York City; and three grandchildren.
