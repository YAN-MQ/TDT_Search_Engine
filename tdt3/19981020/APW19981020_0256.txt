The International Monetary Fund mission arriving in Moscow on Tuesday 
will not discuss food aid, officials said Tuesday. ``The question 
of sending humanitarian aid to Russia, the need for which was declared 
by IMF Managing Director Michel Camdessus a few days ago, will not 
be discussed,'' Deputy Finance Minister Oleg Vyugin said, according 
to the Interfax news agency. ``The IMF isn't a charity institution,'' 
he said. Camdessus said it was necessary for the European Union to 
subsidize deliveries to Russia of chicken and pork in order to prevent 
food shortages in Russia this winter and avert social unrest. The 
Russian government responded with a statement Monday expressing gratitude 
and interest but reiterating its request for new credits. ``They offer 
pork and chicken instead of new loans,'' the liberal daily Segodnya 
said in a front-page commentary on Tuesday. ``Food is a good thing, 
but Russian authorities expected to get some money.'' The IMF leads 
a group of international lenders that amassed a dlrs 22.6 billion 
bailout package for Russia last summer. Only about dlrs 4.7 billion 
was delivered before the crisis hit in August. The IMF suspended further 
payments, saying it wants the government to put forward a credible 
economic plan and evidence it is being implemented. Prime Minister 
Yevgeny Primakov's Cabinet has yet to offer any comprehensive program, 
and little is expected to come out of the IMF visit. ``A call for 
humanitarian aid is merely a diplomatic way to soften the refusal 
of loans,'' the business daily Kommersant said on Tuesday. It added, 
however, that food aid wouldn't be unwelcome against the background 
of this year's grain harvest _ the lowest in decades _ and a sharp 
drop in imports caused by the ruble's devaluation. More than half 
of the food sold in stores recently has been imported. While no serious 
food shortages are expected, Prime Minister Yevgeny Primakov said 
the government wants to be prepared in case of hardship this winter. 
The government has already set up emergency food reserves at a cost 
of dlrs 600 million. They are supposed to last for two weeks and cover 
the needs of one-third of the population.
