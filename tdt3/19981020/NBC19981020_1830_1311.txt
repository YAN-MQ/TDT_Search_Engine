Now to health news, and the dangerous problem of high cholesterol. 
In "living longer, living better" tonight, a new margarine, yes, margarine, 
with an ingredient that can actually improve your health. Here's NBC 
chief science correspondent, Robert Bazell. Imagine eating margarine 
as a way to lower your cholesterol. Tests out today show that if people 
eat two or three pats a day of a new type of margarine, their cholesterol 
goes down as much as 14%, better results than many people get from 
cutting fat in their diet and almost as good as some medications. 
It is most likely to help people who are middle-aged or elderly who 
are at elevated risk of heart disease by virtue of the fact that their 
cholesterol is elevated. The margarine contains plant extracts that 
cut cholesterol by blocking the absorption of animal fats. Two competing 
brands will go on sale next year. Benecol from Johnson and Johnson 
and take control from unilever. The companies also plan to add the 
extracts to salad dressings and other foods that normally contain 
vegetable oils. These, too, should lower cholesterol, although the 
tests are not finished. 0 million Americans have elevated cholesterol 
above 200. The margarine might allow someone with 200 to drop down 
to 172, a healthy level without medication. Then they don't feel as 
though they are marked as having a disease, which many people feel 
if they are taking a drug. Benecol has been available in Finland for 
four years. So far, no one has discovered adverse side effects. The 
margarine is one of the first examples of so-called "functional food," 
food designed to have a medicinal value beyond its basic nutrition. 
Experts predict that functional foods could grow into a $24 billion-A-year 
market in the next few years as the population ages. So what you spread 
on your bread and mix in your salad could soon help you "Live longer, 
live better." Robert Bazell, NBC news, New York.
