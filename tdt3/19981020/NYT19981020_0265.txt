How often does a performer appear who has the vocal power and charisma 
to make you believe in a better musical future? Once in a generation? 
When Audra McDonald, the 28-year-old phenomenon who made her Broadway 
debut four years ago in a revival of ``Carousel,'' unfurls her operatic 
alto with its bright, quickening vibrato, then breaks into a triumphal 
cry before dipping into an ominous funk-tinged blues shout, a better 
musical future seems not only possible but upon us, right here, right 
now. The world evoked by her voice is a place rich with fantastic 
art and extravagant feeling, a realm where genres become weak in the 
knees and helplessly collapse into one another. Whether singing opera 
(``Master Class,'' ``Porgy and Bess''), Broadway pop (``Carousel'' 
and ``Ragtime''), folk or rhythm-and-blues, Ms. McDonald is so fearlessly 
true to her own musical and dramatic instincts that you quickly stop 
wondering if what she's singing is opera or pop or gospel. You surrender 
to the spell of a voice that pounces on the inner life of a song and 
sets it on fire. Ms. McDonald's singing is rooted in paradox. She's 
a formalist (trained at Juilliard) with perfect pitch and impeccable 
diction, yet when she overrides generic boundaries, you sense a bursting 
spontaneity. When an operatic phrase suddenly breaks into a gospel 
cry, this is not a trained singer slumming; the choice feels like 
a necessity summoned from deep within. But behind that spontaneity 
exists a rigid, self-imposed discipline that respects the written 
musical phrase. The tension between Ms. McDonald's enthusiasm and 
her training makes for singing that is high-strung but never hysterical, 
intensely dramatic but not ostentatiously self-dramatizing, free-flowing 
but never flighty. Ms. McDonald, who gave the first of three Monday 
evening performances at Joe's Pub, the sleek, red-lighted new cabaret 
at the Joseph Papp Public Theater, recently released a significant 
debut album, ``Way Back to Paradise'' (Nonesuch), that is all about 
imagining a better musical future. And on Monday, she performed most 
of the album's 14 songs, which showcase a younger generation of theatrical 
composers. Ricky Ian Gordon, Michael John LaChiusa, Jason Robert Brown, 
Adam Guettel and Jenny Giering are all gifted songwriters whose work 
falls somewhere in the nebulous region separating Broadway, serious 
folk-pop, and the concert art songs of Ned Rorem, Samuel Barber and 
other conservative romantics. The father figures of this eclectic, 
genre-bending movement _ and a movement it is _ are George Gershwin 
and Leonard Bernstein. But in tilting as much toward the concert and 
operatic stage as toward Broadway, the Young Turk composers so far 
seem to lack the populist touch of their forerunners. Think of Barber's 
``Knoxville: Summer of 1915,'' for soprano voice and orchestra, but 
flavored with bass, light drums and guitar, as a precursor of ``Way 
Back to Paradise.'' Since it's unlikely that Barbra Streisand, Celine 
Dion and their ilk would put any of these songs on a collection, the 
worrisome question arises: Will any of the new composers be welcomed 
by a Broadway audience conditioned to view Andrew Lloyd Webber as 
the high end of musical theater composition? On Monday, Ms. McDonald, 
accompanied by a trio led by Ted Sperling, was joined at different 
moments by all the composers who contributed to her album. Very much 
in the mode of Barber's ``Knoxville'' were two numbers from Gordon's 
song cycle ``Only Heaven,'' based on poems by Langston Hughes. Guettel 
joined Ms. McDonald on ``Come to Jesus,'' an aching art-pop gospel 
song about a woman about to have an abortion, from his song cycle 
``Saturn Returns.'' Ms. McDonald bit deeply into LaChiusa's ``Way 
Back to Paradise,'' a caustically funny song distilling centuries 
of sexual politics. The evening's most wistful note came with Ms. 
Giering's lovelorn reflection, ``I Follow.'' Its finest story song, 
Brown's ``Stars and the Moon,'' recounted the life of a woman who 
forgoes romantic excitement to marry wealth. But for unalloyed vocal 
passion, nothing matched Ms. McDonald's version of ``Some Days,'' 
Stephen Marzullo's pop-gospel setting of a James Baldwin poem, a song 
not on her album. And passion was what this show was about. If Ms. 
McDonald and her collaborators accomplish nothing else, they have 
arrived just in time to rescue a dying form, the concert art song, 
by infusing it with the open-heartedness of rock, gospel, folk and 
blues. It is an act of salvation.
