Question, who should manage the stock portfolio in your house? The 
study of clients at one brokerage house found that women are more 
successful investors than men. It isn't that women do a better job 
of picking stocks, but they tend to stick with their choices. Men 
are more prone to buying and selling, which costs money in trading 
fees.
