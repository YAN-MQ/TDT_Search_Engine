In a CNN interview, Cuban President Fidel Castro admitted there are 
Cuban spies in the United States. However, he says they're only trying 
to gather information on terrorist activities by anti-Castro exiles 
and they were not sent to spy on the U.S. military. Ten suspected 
Cuban spies were arrested recently for allegedly trying to penetrate 
U.S. military bases in Florida. Three have pleaded guilty to espionage. 
A spokesman for an anti-Castro lobbying group says Castro's statements 
prove he is a threat to U.S. security.
