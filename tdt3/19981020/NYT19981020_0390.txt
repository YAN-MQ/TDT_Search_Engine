Four of the world's largest drug makers reported higher profits Tuesday 
for the third quarter, thanks largely to sales of new drugs and to 
direct-to-consumer advertising campaigns that bolstered sales of older 
products. While all four companies were encouraged by their profit 
gains, their performances were anything but equal. Profits at Schering-Plough, 
one of the industry's hottest companies, rose 22 percent, to $432 
million, or 58 cents a diluted share, compared with $353 million, 
or 48 cents a share, in the quarter a year earlier. It was a penny 
above analysts' expectations measured by the First Call Corp., which 
tracks earnings. Drug companies have had such a boom this year in 
sales that earnings gains of 20 percent are now regarded as average. 
Analysts have applauded any company that topped that mark, which only 
two have done so far in the third quarter: Schering-Plough and Warner-Lambert, 
whose profit was up up 49 percent. Eli Lilly is expected to post a 
30 percent third-quarter earnings gain Thursday. Only one other company 
that reported earnings Tuesday earned praise from analysts. Bristol-Myers 
Squibb, buoyed by sales of its cholesterol-reducer Pravachol and its 
diabetes drug Glucophage, posted a 13 percent gain in net income, 
to $966 million, or 95 cents a share, up from $855 million, or 84 
cents a share, in the quarter a year earlier. The gain matched the 
consensus of forecasts by analysts, who have come to regard Bristol-Myers 
Squibb as one of the industry's most consistent earnings performers. 
American Home Products and London-based SmithKline Beecham, which 
have three aborted mergers between them this year, including one with 
each other, have not performed as robustly as competitors. Profits 
at American Home Products rose 12 percent, to $619 million, or 46 
cents a share, compared with $552.5 million, or 42 cents a share, 
in the quarter a year earlier. SmithKline reported a 10 percent gain 
in net income, to $441 million, or 40 cents an American depository 
receipt, up from $401 million, or 37 cents. Both companies' earnings 
gains matched analysts' expectations. Investors have passed over the 
industry's hot companies in recent weeks to snap up shares of steady 
performers. Tuesday was no different. Despite its 22 percent earnings 
gain, Schering-Plough's shares dropped $1.9375, or 1.9 percent, to 
$98.50. Shares of Bristol-Myers Squibb, meanwhile, increased 68.75 
cents, to $105.6875, while SmithKline Beecham's American depository 
receipts jumped 3.2 percent, to $57.375. American Home Products' stock 
held steady near $50 a share throughout most of Tuesday until investors 
began to take profits in the early afternoon. In the last three hours 
of trading, its shares fell $3.9375, or 7.8 percent, to $46.1875. 
``Investors know that when the economy goes bad, they can still depend 
on the drug industry's most dependable stocks, Johnson &AMP; Johnson 
and Bristol-Myers Squibb,'' said David Saks, managing director at 
Gruntal &AMP; Co. ``They may be wondering if Schering-Plough and Warner-Lambert 
can keep up such huge gains. And I think the answer is yes.'' One 
of Tuesday's stock blips especially captured the imaginations of analysts. 
Of particular interest was SmithKline Beecham's 3.2 percent gain in 
American depository receipts on a third-quarter performance that was 
lackluster at best. There were two views on investor enthusiasm. Jan 
Leschly, the chairman of SmithKline, said the company had strong sales 
from several of its products, including Paxil, its popular antidepressant. 
Wall Street had another thought. Analysts said investors were reacting 
to speculation that Leschly might soon leave the company, a move that 
could open the door for another merger opportunity. That thought did 
not sit well with Leschly, who stressed to reporters Tuesday that 
he had no intentions of leaving. ``There are lots of rumors that I 
may retire early,'' he said Tuesday in an interview. ``It is absolutely 
not true. This is entirely a UK issue, started by the UK press. People 
just write too much here in the UK.''
