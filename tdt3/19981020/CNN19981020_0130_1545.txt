The most famous accordion in polka music is now silent. Polka legend 
frankie yankovic was laid to rest Monday in Ohio. Lydia esparra of 
CNN affiliate wjw was there. And he will raise you upon eagle's wings 
Remember America's polka king, frankie yankovic. East 160th and Midland, 
Saranac road. This is where it all began. Yankovic grew up in Cleveland. 
He made a name for himself when he picked up a button box at age 6. 
decades later, he became the biggest star in polka music. It was happy 
music played with love by a man who always had a smile on his face, 
not just playing music, but living and loving his music. Now he's 
gone, but not forgotten. For many of those who attended frankie's 
funeral say it wasn't a sad occasion. They were playing the music 
he loved on the instrument he loved. And of course, that's what frankie 
would have wanted. Even his wife Ida says frankie wanted a big celebration 
after his death. And I thought of frankie's words, he says, "I don't 
want people crying when i die." He says, "'cause I'll always be with 
you." His fellow musicians say it's an honor to play for him one last 
time. He said, "when I am done and at my funeral," he says, "I don't 
-- the hymns are great." But he says, "we need to have fun." And fun 
they had. Just because, just because Lydia esparra, colinwood.
