If you've ever wondered how a benedictine monk spends an average day, 
you can now find out thanks to an unique web site. The life of a monk 
is not for everybody, but a web site about the life of a monk is. 
Go to the address below, and enter the world of St. Michael's abbey. 
Take a look at some of the daily activities of the benedictine monks 
and read an account of their lives, past and present. And take heed 
-- the site warns if you're looking to escape the daily grind by joining 
a monastery, the busy lives of the monks may have you escaping the 
monastery. You can take a virtual tour outside and inside the monastery. 
Read some of the history of St. Michael's abbey, built as the final 
resting place for Napoleon III. CNN.com offers links to this and other 
sites. That's what's "on-line."
