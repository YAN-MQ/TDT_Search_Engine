Historic flood waters that killed at least 18 people in Texas continued 
coursing down the Guadalupe River today, washing out more homes and 
driving more residents to shelters. NPR's John Burnett reports. The 
Guadalupe, normally a picturesque winding river that averages 150 
feet wide, was estimated at four miles wide at one place today. Record-breaking 
rains fell on South Central Texas over the weekend, at one point, 
swamping parts of 60 counties, nearly a quarter of the state. San 
Antonio received more than two-thirds of its annual 31 inches of rainfall 
in a single weekend. Cattle whose pens and fences were washed away 
wandered through neighborhoods until makeshift posses of cowboys could 
round them up. Local television reports showed dramatic footage of 
the river carrying entire houses downstream. Texas Governor George 
Bush overflew the area in a helicopter earlier today and declared 
it the most terrible damage he's seen since becoming governor. He's 
seeking a federal disaster declaration for 20 counties. John Burnett, 
NPR News, Austin.
