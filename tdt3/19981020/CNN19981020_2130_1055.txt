Some companies are avoiding the high cost of business travel by buying 
airline tickets in bulk. Kalin Thomas-Samuel explains the deal in 
this edition of "working ahead." How you doing today? Oh just fine, 
thank you. To cut the cost of flying, Chrysler and General Motors 
made a Deal with start-up airline pro air for discount tickets. Enjoy 
your flight, all right. The Detroit-based businesses pay pro air a 
flat monthly fee, guaranteed for five years, no matter how many employees 
fly. We expect to save anywhere from $1 million to $3 million annually. 
Having a guaranteed revenue stream worked very well for us. And having 
the competition in the markets worked very well for them. So it was 
a good match. The automakers are bypassing the big carrier in the 
region, northwest, and the main Detroit metro airport. Major corporations 
are so fed up with high fares that they're willing to deal with an 
airline as tiny as pro air. Smaller companies can benefit from a bulk-seat 
purchase agreement, between continental and virgin atlantic airlines, 
and American express corporate travel agency. We're willing to put 
our capital at risk to get them savings. So that by doing business 
with a partner like American express, they're going to be able to 
garner greater savings than working with any other partner. 20 years 
after deregulation, economic uncertainty could bring about more corporate 
airline deals. Kalin Thomas-Samuel, CNN, reporting.
