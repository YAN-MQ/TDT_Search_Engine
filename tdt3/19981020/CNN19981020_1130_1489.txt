Another study shows a rare form of dementia may spark exceptional 
creativity. A researcher at the University of California says five 
people developed artistic skills even though dementia was chipping 
away at their ability to talk. He says these patients have a form 
of dementia that affects the part of the brain that controls social 
behavior. Artists like Vincent Van gogh and Francisco goya exhibited 
similar behavior.
