The International Maritime Bureau condemned China on Tuesday for setting 
free 12 Indonesians held in connection with the hijacking of a Malaysian-registered 
oil tanker. In a statement obtained by The Associated Press, the London-based 
bureau accused China of violating international pacts on piracy and 
suggested the move was part of ``a deep plot to cover up China's participation 
in criminal activity.'' The Malaysian government notified Beijing 
in June of its wish to extradite the 12 Indonesians. They were being 
sought on charges of armed robbery and hijacking of the vessel, the 
Petro Ranger. Malaysia and China have an extradition treaty. A spokeswoman 
for China's Hainan province, where the vessel had been detained, confirmed 
the Indonesians were repatriated Friday. The spokeswoman, who identified 
herself only as Miss Fu, said the 12 were accused of smuggling but 
Malaysia had never filed any formal extradition documents. Chinese 
marine police held the Indonesians for questioning after the vessel 
was discovered off the southern port of Haikou on Hainan Island on 
April 26. There was no word, however, of charging the Indonesians. 
China had the first option to try the men after taking them into custody. 
According to the IMB's statement, however, Chinese authorities released 
the suspected pirates on Oct. 15 and sent them back to Indonesia. 
``It is unbelievable that the 12 persons who had committed a serious 
offense of hijacking a vessel were simply sent home without being 
prosecuted,'' said the statement signed by Jayant Abhyankar, deputy 
director of the IMB, which monitors piracy worldwide. ``This is not 
the first time the Chinese ports have been used to shelter hijacked 
vessels,'' said the statement, dated Oct. 16. The Petro Ranger disappeared 
April 17, one day after it set sail from Singapore to Vietnam with 
11,000 tons of diesel and kerosene. The cargo was worth an estimated 
dlrs 1.5 million. Chinese authorities detained the vessel on April 
26 in the South China Sea. The information was not reported until 
May 1. China released the ship's 21-member crew on May 30 and detained 
the 12 additional men suspected as hijackers for investigation. Neither 
the ship's Singapore-based agent nor the Chinese authorities have 
said what happened to the cargo. ``Yet another attempt to deal with 
piracy has been thwarted by the Chinese authorities,'' the statement 
said. It added that repatriating the suspects was ``in blatant disregard'' 
of various international pacts, notably the Rome convention of 1988, 
of which China is a signatory. It obliges member states to submit 
piracy cases for prosecution. ``The industry can only conclude that 
China is not sincere about the part it says it wants to play in international 
maritime affairs,'' the statement said.
