Firefighters in southern California are getting some relief from slower 
winds and cooler temperatures. They are battling fires in Ventura 
and Santa Barbara counties. Both are expected to be contained by tomorrow. 
More than 7,000 acres have burned. Three firefighters have been injured. 
Some residents in the town of Fillmore had to be evacuated, but there 
have been no reports of damaged homes.
