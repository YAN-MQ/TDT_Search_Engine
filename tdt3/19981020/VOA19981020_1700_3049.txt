And as Elaine Johannsen reported a few moments ago, the U.S. trade 
deficit continues to rise reaching a record level in the month of 
August. Correspondent Barry Wood tells us because of the Asian recession, 
the Commerce Department expects the U.S. deficit to remain at record 
levels for several months. The August deficit in goods and services 
totaled just under $17 billion. That's the highest monthly deficit 
ever and continues the deterioration in the U.S. trade balance that 
began early this year. Because of the recession in Asia, U.S. exports 
fell in August for the fifth straight month, while imports continue 
to rise. The 1998 U.S. trade deficit is expected to total $153 billion 
which would be a 40 percent increase from last year. The August trade 
deficit was bigger than outside experts had anticipated, and the widest 
gap was with China, nearly $6 billion. The gap with Japan was $5 billion. 
Both figures are substantially higher than previous months. China 
and Japan have experienced sharp slowdowns in growth and are buying 
fewer U.S. airliners, computers, and raw materials. Meanwhile, a rise 
in imports confirmed the United States remains what is increasingly 
called the importer of last resort to countries in economic distress. 
The sharp devaluation of Asian currencies against the dollar has given 
Asian exporters significant price advantages in the U.S. market. Japanese 
steel exports in the United States have doubled during the past year. 
The United States remains both the world's largest exporter and its 
largest importer. Barry Wood, VOA News, Washington.
