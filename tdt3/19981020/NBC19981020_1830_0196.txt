Texas and all it's been through is a perfect example of the whims 
of the wild weather buffeting the globe in recent years. And tonight, 
new evidence of steadily rising temperatures. Here's NBC's Robert 
Hager. New signs the earth may be warming, from researchers just back 
from the once-frozen Arctic. 12 months spent deliberately stuck in 
the ice, aboard the Canadian research ship "Des groseilliers." Stuck 
on an ice flow that drifted 1,000 miles over that time, before the 
ship finally started its engines and broke free. Now, researchers 
report that, although temperatures sometimes dropped more than 40 
degrees below zero, on average, the entire 12-month period was warmer 
than past years. This spring, the ice was much thinner than normal, 
perhaps the thinnest ever. Ice began breaking up sooner than normal. 
Patches of open water appeared much farther north than normal. And 
the water was fresher, less salt, indicating a greater amount of melted 
ice water in the ocean. The new reports come during a year that meteorologists 
say is on its way to being the warmest ever recorded, worldwide. But 
the Arctic observations are of intense interest, because the earth's 
poles are considered bellwethers of climate change. It was also an 
adventure. Shifting ice that sometimes broke suddenly and threatened 
to separate researchers from their ship. Polar bears that haunted 
the site forced researchers to arm themselves with guns. As to the 
basic research, is it yet another sign of permanent warming of our 
earth, perhaps caused by pollution or Greenhouse gases that trap heat 
close to the earth? Or could it be more the result of some short-range 
condition, such as the just concluded El Nino? I would probably be 
more to the skeptic side, but it's pretty hard when you go up and 
you can't find the ice thickness you want. And the water is looking 
so fresh, and you see these changes. It's pretty hard not to start 
to think about the connections to global warming. Scientists already 
knew Arctic ice has been melting for at least the last 20 years. But 
the new expedition could be one more indication it's all happening 
much faster than expected. Robert Hager, NBC news, Washington.
