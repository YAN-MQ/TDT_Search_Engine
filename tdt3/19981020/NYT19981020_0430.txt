Deutsche Bank, eager to buy a concern that will enhance its international 
investment banking business, has been scouting out prospects, including 
Bankers Trust Corp., Lehman Brothers Holdings Inc. and J.P. Morgan 
&AMP; Co., bankers and analysts said Tuesday. Ronaldo H. Schmitz, 
a member of the board of Frankfurt-based Deutsche Bank, recently visited 
with executives from several New York financial companies, including 
Bankers Trust, according to a Deutsche Bank executive who spoke on 
condition of anonymity. Schmitz, 59, who oversees Deutsche Bank's 
investment banking strategy as well as its North American business, 
was traveling in the United States recently for the annual meetings 
of the World Bank and the International Monetary Fund in Washington, 
Macy W. Egerton, a spokeswoman for Deutsche Bank confirmed Tuesday. 
She refused to say what banks Schmitz had met with on his visit. Deutsche 
Bank and Bankers Trust declined to comment on reports published Tuesday 
in The Financial Times of London that their banks were in ``preliminary 
talks'' about a possible merger. Even so, the time may be ripe for 
Deutsche Bank to begin such discussions, whether with Bankers Trust 
or some other United States concern, analysts said Tuesday. The declines 
in the American stock markets in recent months have ravaged the stock 
prices of several big banks and brokerage firms, making them cheaper 
potential acquisitions. While shares of Bankers Trust rose $4.1875 
Tuesday, to $58.9375, on the report of a possible deal, they are still 
well below $58.9375, their price of about $100 two months ago. Deutsche 
Bank's stock, however, has fallen less. Deutsche Bank has signaled 
in recent months that buying an American investment bank is its preferred 
route onto Wall Street, after an expensive strategy of building by 
hiring bankers and traders proved unsuccessful. ``Deutsche has publicly 
stated they want to buy'' a bank, said Evangelos Kavouriadis, European 
banking analyst at Sanford Bernstein &AMP; Associates, ``and they 
have plenty of financial reserves,'' more than 44 billion marks ($27.14 
billion). ``So the will and the money is there. The question is from 
the available candidates, who is the best fit?'' Deutsche Bank is 
looking for American investment banking expertise to counter growing 
international competition. ``It would appear that what Deutsche and 
the big European banks are worried about,'' said Guy Moszkowski, an 
analyst at Salomon Smith Barney, ``is that if they don't rapidly improve 
their capital markets capabilities, firms like Morgan Stanley, Merrill 
Lynch and Goldman, Sachs'' will reap the rewards as capital markets 
in Europe shift to stocks and away from bank financing under economic 
and monetary union. Some American banks may also be more eager now 
to draw closer to a powerful outside partner like Deutsche Bank. Russia's 
default on its debts, the gloomier international financial outlook 
and the sudden contraction of liquidity in many markets has unnerved 
many of those who manage big American financial companies that deal 
in the more speculative markets. Bankers Trust, for example, has been 
the subject of negative rumors in recent weeks in part because of 
its big businesses in several markets that have recently done poorly, 
notably junk bonds, derivatives and growth companies. It also has 
had some rude shocks lately, having to put up $300 million as its 
part in the rescue of Long-Term Capital Management L.P., the hedge 
fund in Greenwich, Conn., that nearly collapsed. In early September, 
Bankers Trust said that it had trading losses totaling $350 million 
in its business with Russia. This Thursday, Bankers Trust is expected 
to report its results for the quarter ended Sept. 30, with analysts 
generally expecting layoffs and losses. But some analysts Tuesday 
were scathing about the wisdom of any such merger by Deutsche Bank 
in the current uncertain and volatile climate. ``It is probably one 
of the worst investment banking decisions I could imagine,'' said 
Mark Hoge, bank analyst at Credit Suisse First Boston in London. ``It 
is the worst possible environment to be buying an investment bank 
at this time, given the market uncertainties, and that you don't know 
how many gremlins are hiding inside.''
