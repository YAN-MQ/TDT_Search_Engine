Researchers believe they know why there's not much thrill in tickling 
yourself. Scientists who watched the brains of people trying to tickle 
themselves found the cerebellum, in the lower back of the brain, tells 
another part of the brain, "it's just you." But it's too soon to say 
whether the cerebellum is the only brain region involved in dampening 
the tickle sensation. The study is published in the November issue 
of the journal "nature neuroscience."
