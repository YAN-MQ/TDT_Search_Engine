Joseph Volpe, general manager of the Metropolitan Opera, announced 
Tuesday that Luciano Pavarotti had withdrawn from the three performances 
he was scheduled to sing next month as Cavaradossi in Puccini's ``Tosca.'' 
The performances were to be on Nov. 7, Nov. 12 and 16. Volpe said 
that Pavarotti still planned to appear in a gala performance on Nov. 
22 to celebrate the 30th anniversary of his debut at the Met. The 
tenor Richard Leech will replace Pavarotti in the Cavaradossi role. 
Pavarotti, who underwent major knee and hip surgery in July, is recuperating 
at his home in Italy. In recent seasons, physical problems made him 
increasingly immobile in performance. The staging of productions he 
appeared in, including ``Tosca'' and ``Turandot,'' had to be adjusted 
because he could not climb stairs or stand for long periods. Surgery 
to correct the problem was long recommended by Pavarotti's doctors, 
according to his manager, Herbert Breslin. But to recover fully, Pavarotti 
needed to lose some weight, which proved to be difficult. ``The problem 
is over,'' Breslin said Tuesday. ``He has finally taken care of something 
he has suffered with for many, many years, and he has made incredible 
progress. He is normally not the person who is going to sit up every 
day and start doing physical therapy. But he has. He is determined.'' 
His first performance since the surgery came in a concert last week 
before an audience of 18,000 at an arena in Cologne. But Pavarotti's 
doctors believe he needs two or three more weeks of physical therapy 
before he will be able to walk comfortably onstage in an operatic 
performance, Volpe said. The 30th-anniversary gala will present Pavarotti 
in Act III of Puccini's ``Boheme'' (with soprano Daniela Dessi), Act 
II of Donizetti's ``Elisir d'Amore'' (with soprano Ruth Ann Swenson), 
and Act IV of Verdi's ``Aida'' (with soprano Aprile Millo).
