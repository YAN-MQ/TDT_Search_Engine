For Murray Louis, landmark events are not only the most obviously 
important occurences. The Murray Louis and Nikolais Dance Company 
will celebrate a 50th anniversary, for instance, in a weeklong season 
that opens on Tuesday at the Joyce Theater. What is being celebrated 
is not the start of either choreographer's career or their companies, 
but rather the beginning of a yeasty, highly productive residency 
at the Henry Street Settlement House on the Lower East Side. Louis 
and Alwin Nikolais, who died in 1993, taught at the settlement house 
and performed in its theater from 1948 until 1970. It was there, Louis 
said in a recent interview, that their pioneering work in modern dance 
came to fruition. ``Everything built to a technique and style and 
point of view at the Playhouse,'' he recalled. For him and Nikolais, 
Henry Street was ``the beginning of everything. ``A 50-year span has 
to be divided by the decades it has passed through, and each has been 
distinct politically, socially and in terms of audience sensibilities 
and financial support,'' he said. ``Even the venues. So you really 
have to break it down into all these little portions. Nothing has 
remained the same over 50 years. The only thing you can count on is 
wrinkles and sore feet.'' The 1990s are epitomized by the television 
and computer in a new narrative piece by Louis, with the working title 
of ``Millennium Loop,'' that will be performed at the Joyce. ``We 
all live in the blue light of the television, of the computer, of 
all the effects on all these screens that we sit in front of and stare 
at,'' he said. ``When the plug is pulled, no one will know how to 
live.'' Other eras, other inventions. The season's second program 
is a retrospective of work by Nikolais that includes dances created 
in the early 1960s. That was a time, Louis recalls, when a dread settled 
over the land following the explosion of the Chinese H-bomb, when 
universities across the nation began to build state-of-the-art theaters, 
and when the federal government began to contemplate giving money 
to the arts. It was also the age of stretch fabric and the tape recorder. 
``Can you imagine? Prior to that we had cotton and wool tights. Cotton 
bagged mercilessly, so when you did a knee bend you came up with these 
huge joints at the knees. Wool tights stretched at the inseams and 
the crotches. We were constantly mending wool and shrinking cotton. 
Now you could choreograph for the whole body, not just for the arms 
and upper torso.'' The advent of the tape recorder meant another kind 
of freedom. ``You had someone in the wings trying to hit the band 
with a very nervous hand,'' Louis said of pre-recorder days. Every 
dance began with ``yowarggh da-de-de-da,'' he said, imitating the 
inevitable scratch of the needle before the music started. Now dances 
could be longer or shorter than the dictates of a record. ``I remember 
that the tape recorder (italics)every(end italics) dancer owned was 
the Wollensak. They were heavy but they were solid and small, and 
every dancer carried a Wollensak around with them. Today, they carry 
their vitamins, their bags of grain.'' Coming full circle, Louis talks 
excitedly of the recent acquisition by Ohio University in Athens of 
the complete Nikolais-Louis archives. The best material, which he 
will chose, will be available to scholars on CD-ROMs. ``Five years 
ago, there was just a confusion about all this. I'm going to do it, 
I thought, when I can grasp it and I know where it's going.''
