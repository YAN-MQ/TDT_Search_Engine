Now to Microsoft, in Washington today Microsoft had its turn to answer 
charges leveled by the justice department yesterday. Today the Microsoft 
lawyers argued that they were aggressive competitors but not out to 
crush the competition. ABC's Terry Moran is following the trial in 
federal court. Yesterday the government told a story about Microsoft's 
behavior, today Microsoft responded with a legal argument denying 
that behavior and saying that the judge should remember that the antitrust 
laws aren't a code of civility in business, to make sure that capitalists 
are nice to each other, that Microsoft competes fairly by adding new 
features into its products and that's what this case is about. They 
also pointed out that Netscape hasn't been damaged. It continues to 
ship millions and millions of Internet browsers. If that's the case, 
Microsoft should win. Yesterday the justice department went pretty 
directly for Bill Gates. Today they went pretty directly for Netscape's 
CEO. James barksdale ho who was challenged by Microsoft's lawyer on 
his contacts with the department of justice, Joel Klein, the assistant 
attorney general breakfasted at his home several years ago. Sore loser 
defense. Microsoft says Netscape couldn't win in the market place 
so ran to uncle sam.
