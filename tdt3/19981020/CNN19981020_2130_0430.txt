The Dominican republic is paying tribute to one of its most famous 
exports, chicago cubs slugger Sammy Sosa. Thousands of cheering fans 
greeted him as he arrived in santo Domingo today. Sosa was awarded 
the country's highest civilian honor, and then headed to his hometown 
of San Pedro for a parade. He electrified the baseball world this 
year by battling Mark McGwire for the single-season home run record. 
Sosa's foundation also sent food, medical supplies and money to his 
homeland to aid recovery from hurricane georges.
