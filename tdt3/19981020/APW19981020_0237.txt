Russian agricultural production slid by 9.4 percent in the first nine 
months of 1998, compared with the same period last year, a news report 
said Tuesday. Because of a crippling financial crisis that broke in 
August, farm production was down almost across the board, the Interfax 
news agency said, citing figures from the State Statistics Committee. 
By Oct. 1, the country had 16 percent fewer sheep and goats, 9 percent 
fewer cattle, and 3 percent fewer pigs, Interfax said. As a result, 
meat production was down by 4 percent and milk production dropped 
slightly by .6 percent. Only egg production edged upward, by 3 percent. 
In September of 1998, the country produced farm goods worth 53 billion 
rubles (dlrs 3.1 billion), down 15 percent from 1997 levels. Still, 
overall farming production was 0.4 percent higher than it was in 1996, 
Interfax said. Last week the State Statistics Committee reported that 
Russia had harvested only half as much grain so far this year as it 
did in the same period last year. Though the government has said Russia 
will not face food shortages this year, leaders on Monday welcomed 
offers of food aid from the International Monetary Fund.
