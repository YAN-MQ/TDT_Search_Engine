Again, they have gone from droughts to floods. The extreme weather 
in Texas is just the latest example of what scientists fear is the 
result of steadily rising temperatures everywhere in the kwlobe. That 
part of the story from Robert Hager. New signs the earth may be warning 
from researchers just back from the once-frozen Arctic. 12 months 
spent stuck in the ice aboard stuck on this ice ship before the ship 
finally started its engines and broke free. Now researchers report 
that although sometimes temperatures dropped to 40 degrees below 0, 
on average, the 12-month period was warmer. The ice was thinner than 
normal, and ice began breaking up sooner than normal, patches of open 
water appeared much farther north than normal, and the water was fresher, 
less salt. The new reports come bringing years scientists say is on 
its way to being the warmest worldwide. The oshesvations of the Arctic 
are of interest because with earth's poles are considered bellwethers 
for changes. There was shifting ice that broke suddenly that threatened 
to break researchers from their shift. Polar bears forced researchers 
to arm themselves with gun. As to basic research, is it another sign 
of permanent warming of our earth perhaps caused by pollution or Greenhouse 
gases that trap heat delose to the earth or more a result of short 
rank condition, such as El Nino? I'm probably more to the skeptic 
side, but it's hard when you go up and you can't finchede the ice 
thickness you want and the water is looking so fresh. It's hard to 
not start thinking about the connections to global warming. Scientists 
already knew Arctic ice has been melting for at least the last 20 
years, but the new expedition could be one more indication it's all 
happening much faster than expected. Robert Hager, NBC news, Washington.
