Poland's government on Tuesday formally recognized the North Atlantic 
Treaty Organization, a necessary step toward membership in the military 
alliance. Parliament now needs to ratify the treaty. The move could 
allow Poland's entry to the Western military alliance earlier than 
the planned April date. NATO Secretary General Javier Solana has not 
ruled out Poland might join NATO earlier, saying the timing depended 
on whether Poland was ready for it. Ever since toppling the communists 
in 1989, Solidarity has pushed for integration with the West's security 
and economic structures. Joining NATO would make Poland ``more secure 
and stable than ever in its modern history,'' said Polish Prime Minister 
Jerzy Buzek, who heads the Solidarity-led coalition government. Poland, 
along with the Czech Republic and Hungary, has been invited to join 
NATO on the pact's 50th anniversary in April.
