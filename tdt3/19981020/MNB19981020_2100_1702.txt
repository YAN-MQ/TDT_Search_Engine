Opening arguements continue today in the anti-trust case against Microsoft 
in its defense strategy, the company says it was aggressive but legal 
in dealing with competitors and that anti-trust laws don't call companies 
to act with any civility. Government claims meist used its dominant

to last six weeks or so. Microsoft is part-owner of the MSNBC cable 
network.
