But first, attorneys for Paula Jones are asking a federal appeals 
court to breathe new life into her sexual harassment lawsuit against 
president clinton. A lower court dismissed it in April, finding that 
even if the allegations are true, there was no evidence that Jones 
was harmed. Today her attorneys argue that then Arkansas governor 
Clinton created a Hostile work environment for Jones, after she refused 
his sexual advances. Mr. Clinton's lawyers also are appearing today 
before the three-judge panel in St. Paul, Minnesota, asking them to 
uphold the dismissal. Recent attempts to settle the suit out of court 
have failed. We were talking to the president's lawyers as late as 
yesterday, and there's no animosity between the lawyers on both sides. 
That's key, the lawyers are talking. And I've been in this case for 
a little over a year, and this is the first time where we've had ongoing 
talks with the other side. And everybody is serious. I think both 
sides want a settlement. It's just, can we put all the pieces together 
and also we have complex clients on both sides? Hillary and Bill Clinton, 
they work as a team. You have Paula and Steve Jones. They work as 
a team. So it's not just about money. It's all these human factors, 
but of course money is a part of it. Jones claims Mr. Clinton propositioned 
her in 1991, when he was Arkansas governor and she was a state employee. 
He denies it. The appeals court is not expected to make a decision 
today.
