Arnold M. Auerbach, a comedy writer who wrote for Fred Allen, Milton 
Berle and Al Jolson and who contributed sketches to the successful 
Broadway revues ``Call Me Mister'' and ``Inside U.S.A.,'' died on 
Monday at New York Hospital. He was 86. Auerbach got his first taste 
of show business in 1932, when his script, ``How Revolting,'' was 
selected for Columbia University's varsity show, which was presented 
in the Grand Ballroom of the Waldorf Astoria. His collaborator for 
this production was Herman Wouk. During World War II, as an Army private 
first class, he contributed sketches to Frank Loesser's ``About Face,'' 
a musical comedy staged by Special Services by, with and for soldiers. 
It starred Jules Munshin and Vincente Gomez and also became Mickey 
Rooney's vehicle for entertaining troops in Europe. He also wrote 
sketches for other Army shows: ``Hi, Yank!'', which had music and 
lyrics by Loesser and Alex North, and ``PFC Mary Brown,'' a Women's 
Army Corps revue with Loesser songs. Auerbach's exuberance on returning 
to civilian life was expressed in his work for the hit 1946 Broadway 
revue ``Call Me Mister,'' with a score by Harold Rome and winning 
performances by Betty Garrett and Munshin. Auerbach wrote the sketches 
with Arnold Horwitt. Auerbach and Horwitt teamed with Moss Hart to 
write the sketches for another successful Broadway revue, ``Inside 
U.S.A.'' in 1948. The show starred Beatrice Lillie and Jack Haley 
and had songs by Howard Dietz and Arthur Schwartz. Auerbach, Rome 
and Munshin were less successful when they put on another Broadway 
revue, ``Bless You All,'' with Pearl Bailey in 1950. He wrote for 
Fred Allen's radio show and and Milton Berle's ``Texaco Star Theater'' 
and also created material for Nat Hiken, who used it in the ``Sergeant 
Bilko'' television series, starring Phil Silvers. Arnold Auerbach 
was born on May 23, 1912, on the west side of Manhattan, the son of 
Dr. Julian Auerbach, a doctor, and the former Olga Offner. He attended 
the Franklin School and Columbia, where he also received a master's 
degree in journalism. Over the years he contributed satirical essays 
to The New York Times and other publications. His books include ``Funny 
Men Don't Laugh'' (1965), an account of his days as a comedy writer 
for radio, and ``Is that Your Best Offer?'' (1971), a novel. He is 
survived by his wife, Justine; a daughter, Nina Auerbach of Philadelphia, 
and a son, Andrew, of New Haven, Conn.
