Israel denied a report Tuesday that it would be willing to deploy 
Arrow missile batteries in Jordan and Turkey in times of need, as 
long as the United States agrees. David Ivri, a senior aide to Israeli 
Defense Minister Yitzhak Mordechai, told the Haaretz daily that nations 
in the Middle East are in a race to deploy weapons of mass destruction 
and that the West has failed to slow the proliferation of such weapons. 
The defense ministry later issued a statement denying that Ivri said 
anything about the possibility of deploying Arrow missile batteries 
in Jordan or Turkey. Israel's Arrow missile, expected to be operational 
by mid-1999, is intended as a defense against ballistic missiles possessed 
by Iran, Iraq and other potential enemies, such as Syria or Libya. 
In the past, Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu has suggested 
sharing the Arrow technology with allies in the region.
