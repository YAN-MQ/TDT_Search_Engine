Thousands of French police were placed on maximum alert Tuesday to 
prevent disturbances during high school students' second major nationwide 
protest in less than a week. Hundreds of thousands of high school 
students were expected to demonstrate across the country to press 
demands for more teachers, better equipment and buildings and a lighter 
course load. Students were hoping to maintain the momentum after last 
Thursday's marches by a half-million students in nearly 350 cities. 
By mid-day, students filled the streets of numerous French towns, 
with at least 7,500 students in Rouen, in Normandy, 4,000 in Nancy, 
in the east, 6,000 in Avignon in the south. In nearby Aix-en-Provence, 
2,500 youths blocked the A8 highway, officials said. ``No promises. 
Action,'' read banners at a morning march in Bordeaux in southwest 
France that, police said, drew 10,000 students. A second demonstration 
was set for afternoon. Hours ahead, 4th graf, 1st Ld (ds-eg-parf)
