The government kicked off its antitrust case against Microsoft Monday 
in washington. And as it turns out, the software company and Monica 
Lewinsky have something in common. Kelli Arena explains. Microsoft 
chairman Bill Gates was not at the trial, but a Look-alike was, as 
a book promotion prop. It's a spoof on Microsoft -- microspoof. There 
were Microsoft critics -- Bill the bigot. That's why we're here. And 
Microsoft supporters -- The only legal basis for this case got thrown 
out by the court of appeals. Nearly two dozen camera crews lined the 
sidewalk, many occupying the same spot they have for months covering 
the Lewinsky trial -- most largely unfazed by this landmark antitrust 
case. It's just another day in the grind. It's hard to top Monica. 
The enthusiasm, dampened a bit by a brief but powerful downpour. For 
the most part, washingtonians are now used to a lot of fuss outside 
this courthouse. During the Lewinsky trial, camera crews went to great 
lengths to get the best shots. And while Monica's musings gripped 
Washington's imagination, the software giant just doesn't hold the 
same lure. Have you ever heard of Microsoft? no. That's not to say 
everyone is disenchanted. The more people come over there are, the 
more business I get. As long as they're here, we know that people 
be coming in and out. The Microsoft trial begins just as Congress 
winds down. Washington, merely swapping one stage for another. Kelli 
Arena, "CNN Financial News," Washington.
