This is THE WORLD. I'm Lisa Mullins. The Mid East summit near Washington 
D.C. entered a grueling sixth day today with a new but familiar face 
at the table. At the request of Secretary of State Madeleine Albright, 
Jordan's King Hussein arrived at the Y Conference Center to help bridge 
the gaps between Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu and Palestinian 
leader Yasser Arafat. Meanwhile, President Clinton canceled a fund-raising 
trip to California to stay close to the talks. According to Israeli 
government spokesman Moshi Volgo, the sticking point for Israel remains 
Palestinian security. If we can have an understanding with the Palestinians 
that they will finally fight terror, that they will take concrete, 
tangible steps that will have a way of measuring what they're doing, 
then I think that we will be able to come to an agreement. But if 
they continue to drag their feet in the fight against terror, we really 
not have an agreement that will stand the test of time. But Hannan 
Ashwari, a former member of the Palestinian Legislative Council says 
the Palestinians are doing everything they can to control terrorism. 
We have accepted every single American proposal and every single European 
proposal pertaining to security. And I think as Israelis are placing 
impossible demands on to insure that they would not comply with their 
part of the deal.
