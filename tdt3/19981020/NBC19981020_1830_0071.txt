Good evening. For a time today, it seemed as if a big chunk of Texas 
would just disappear in a torrent of flood water. And remember, this 
is the same part of the country that was parched to a Crisp by a devastating 
drought last summer. The worst of the flooding is south of San Antonio, 
in Victoria, Texas, and NBC's Jim Cummins is in Victoria. Dozens of 
rivers and streams in Texas are out of their banks tonight, driving 
more than 7,000 people from their homes, flooding more than 60 counties 
from San Antonio to the gulf of Mexico. Today, the city of Victoria, 
Texas, was swamped by floodwater from the guadalupe river. Hardest 
hit, the historic district, "old Victoria," near downtown, worst flood 
here since 1936, city officials say. The river looks more like a lake, 
four miles wide in some places. At noon, stella nava rushes to the 
water's edge to look for her stepson's house. It's gone. His house 
was just on stilts, a little house. It's gone? It's not there. Not 
there. The people who live in this neighborhood say at sunrise, the 
streets were dry. By noon, this place was a swamp. Willa Hewlett's 
house is under water. We never really thought it would get in the 
house. We thought eight inches off the floor would save the furniture. 
But it didn't. Police, firefighters and the national guard have rescued 
scores of people trapped in their homes, including earnest meadors, 
who was reluctant to leave. They kept sayin', "I ain't gonna come 
get ya tonight. I figured I better come out now." In Houston, the 
water is still rising in some places on the brazos and San Jacinto 
rivers. Today, three people high in a tree had to be rescued by boat. 
One's in the boat now. In San Antonio, where the flooding began Saturday, 
rescue workers are still finding bodies. Today, a 37-year-old man. 
This is just not a fun part of the job, having to go in and find someone 
that did not make it. That we weren't able to get to in the first 
place. Victoria is now under a dawn-to-dusk curfew in the flood zone. 
And for now, there is no rain in the forecast. Jim Cummins, NBC news, 
Victoria, Texas.
