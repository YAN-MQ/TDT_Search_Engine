A new study suggests kids are six times more likely to be maltreated 
in a Home where there's an adult who is not biologically related to 
the child. Don Knapp has the story. It's a story too often told. A 
2-year-old is abused, in this case held under water until she drowns. 
Police arrest the mother's boyfriend. Now a researcher says he's confirmed 
a pattern of child abuse behind such stories. The family structure 
and the household composition that was most strongly associated with 
death from maltreatment, was having a live-in boyfriend in the household. 
Dr. Michael stiffman's group studied records of nearly 2,600 children 
under the age 5 who died from maltreatment in Missouri during a Three-year 
period from '92 to '95. He concluded that children are six times more 
likely to die from injuries in homes where there is a stepparent. 
And fatal injuries are eight times more likely if there's some other 
adult in the house who's not biologically related. It's important 
to remember that the vast majority of children who live in homes with 
people who are not biologically related suffer no maltreatment. This 
is a rare event that we're talking about. Dr. stiffman also found 
that overall, more childhood injury deaths occur in homes where there 
is a biological mom and dad. That's because there are many more of 
these homes. Stiffman's study does not explain why the injury death 
risk is less in homes with biological parents. But he does suggests, 
not surprisingly, that perhaps biological parents may are driven by 
an instinct to protect their kids. Don Knapp, CNN, San Francisco.
