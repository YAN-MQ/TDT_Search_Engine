The chairman of the House Judiciary Committee said Tuesday that his 
goal of finishing the impeachment investigation of President Clinton 
by the end of the year was ``all dependent on whether there's reasonable 
cooperation from the White House.'' The chairman, Rep. Henry Hyde, 
R-Ill., placed the burden on the White House to avoid a protracted 
investigation just a day before Charles Ruff, the White House counsel; 
David Kendall, Clinton's private lawyer, and Gregory Craig, a White 
House special counsel, were to meet Republican and Democratic lawyers 
and investigators from the committee spearheading the impeachment 
investigation. ``We will be able to ascertain the level of cooperation, 
which will be interesting to us,'' Hyde said. His remarks appeared 
to be part of a strategy both sides are adopting, to present themselves 
as ready to move quickly through the hearings, but keeping open the 
possibility that the other side would be responsible for any delays. 
The meeting on Wednesday marks the first effort by committee staff 
members and the White House to set ground rules and procedures since 
the House voted to open a formal impeachment inquiry into Clinton's 
efforts to disguise the nature of his relationship with Monica Lewinsky. 
David Schippers, the Republican investigative counsel for the House 
Judiciary Committee, has said there is credible evidence that Clinton 
may have committed perjury, abused the power of his office and obstructed 
justice. The sides are to discuss what rights and privileges the president's 
lawyers will have to question witnesses, sit in on depositions and 
participate in closed sessions of the committee. During the Watergate 
investigation of President Nixon 24 years ago, the White House counsel 
was granted broad power to question witnesses. The parties are also 
expected to explore how much of the evidence submitted to Congress 
by Kenneth Starr, the independent counsel, the White House will contest. 
That could help determine how many witnesses the committee will independently 
depose and for how long. ``We are in favor of a process that is not 
a partisan process,'' said Craig, one of the White House lawyers, 
``that is one that everyone can see is fair and even-handed.'' He 
added, ``We do believe that would include a consideration by the full 
committee of the constitutional standard that should be employed to 
determine whether or not the conduct at issue is at the level of an 
impeachable offense.'' The meeting takes place in the shadow of the 
midterm elections, and both sides are expected to step gingerly because 
of the political stakes. A Republican committee staff member said 
the lawyers were approaching the meeting ``like the Russians and United 
States in the Cold War, with good reason to be cautious because neither 
side wants the other side to use their weaponry.'' Hyde said the committee 
was still working out which witnesses it would call. With political 
strategists predicting that the midterm elections are unlikely to 
give Republicans a sweeping mandate, some Judiciary Committee members 
said November's election results should not be a factor in committee 
deliberations. ``You have to resist trying to apply the elections 
results to the committee,'' said Rep. Asa Hutchinson, R-Ark. ``If 
you turn it around, you could say an overwhelming Republican victory 
should give impetus to impeachment, and I think that would be wrong.'' 
But many House members acknowledged that the impeachment proceedings 
would only be put on an even keel once the political verdict of the 
elections was assessed, and the imperatives of both parties to fire 
up their partisans were finally put aside. ``Look, the rhetoric has 
been raised to a pretty high level right now,'' said Rep. Bill Jenkins, 
R-Tenn. ``We need to let this election cycle pass and let things calm 
down.'' Unless Republicans achieve a large sweep in the House, strategists 
and aides in both political parties say that Republicans and Democrats 
alike will have reason to shy away from a drawn-out inquiry. ``I think 
everybody would like to move it along,'' Hyde said. ``But we have 
to do it appropriately. We don't want to rush to a conclusion that 
hasn't been well thought out.'' Some Republicans said the House would 
have to weigh carefully whether to pursue articles of impeachment 
against Clinton if it appeared that the Senate lacked the votes to 
convict him. Democrats are starting to voice concerns that they could 
suffer if either they or the president are perceived as drawing out 
the impeachment proceedings into a long public spectacle featuring 
a parade of witnesses from Starr to Ms. Lewinsky. Rep. Maxine Waters, 
D-Calif., said, ``Everybody is going to have to do the best job that 
can be done to keep this from being a donnybrook that's unacceptable 
to the public.''
