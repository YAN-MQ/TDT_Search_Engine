David Coulter, the president of the newly merged BankAmerica Corp., 
resigned Tuesday, days after the company stunned investors when it 
announced huge losses because of a loan to a hedge fund. The bank 
announced disappointing third-quarter earnings last week in large 
part because of a $372 million write-down to cover the loss on a loan 
to the hedge fund D.E. Shaw &AMP; Co. in 1997. That write-down followed 
earlier announcements by the pre-merged BankAmerica, saying it had 
pretax trading losses of $330 million, largely because of bad trades 
in emerging markets and Russia. ``There is one element of David taking 
the fall for the D.E. Shaw incident,'' said Ron Mandle, a banking 
analyst at Sanford C. Bernstein. Coulter, who was chairman and chief 
executive of the old BankAmerica before it merged with Nationsbank 
last month, oversaw risk management. His last day will be Oct. 30. 
Coulter did not return phone calls but said in a statement released 
by the company, ``The decision was extremely difficult for me, both 
personally and professionally.'' Hugh L. McColl Jr., the chairman 
and chief executive of BankAmerica, was at a policy committee meeting 
Tuesday and did not return phone calls. But he said in the same statement: 
`It is very painful to me personally to accept his resignation. We 
wish him well.'' But analysts and people close to the company say 
there may be less regret than McColl's comments suggest. There has 
been speculation for months about how long Coulter would stay at the 
merged company, especially given that he could stand to gain more 
than $30 million in cash and stock when he leaves, according to regulatory 
filings. Coulter gave no reason for his resignation, but these people 
say Coulter began to question whether he could work with McColl soon 
after the merger was announced in April. The rift between the two 
grew increasingly more apparent this summer when several jobs that 
were expected to go to BankAmerica executives went to Nationsbank 
employees instead, these people said. ``Dave was feeling more and 
more that the promises upon which the deal was agreed to were not 
materializing,'' one person close to BankAmerica said. In one instance, 
this person said, when a senior executive at the old BankAmerica asked 
to meet his new boss from Nationsbank before being reassigned, he 
was told no and then chided for not being a team player. ``There were 
lots of things like that _ culture clashes and such,'' the person 
said. When the merger was announced in April, Coulter was expected 
to take _ but was not guaranteed _ the top job when McColl retired. 
But McColl, who is known for his military ardor and is famous for 
keeping a hand grenade on his desk, had a different philosophy about 
how to manage the combined company and was growing increasing uncomfortable 
with anointing Coulter as the heir apparent, several people close 
to the company said. The two had not talked to each other for several 
days. After news of last week's losses, McColl sent W.W. Johnson, 
head of the executive committee, to meet with Coulter for breakfast 
on Friday to ask him to resign, the people said. A spokesman for the 
bank would not comment on the relationship between Coulter and McColl. 
A successor to Coulter has not been announced. But he has been replaced 
on the policy committee by Bill Vandiver, who headed up risk management 
at Nationsbank and will report directly to McColl. It is not known 
whether more resignations among top managers are on the way. Whatever 
the outcome, Judah Kraushaar, a banking analyst with Merrill Lynch 
&AMP; Co., said: ``Investors want to get a better fix on what the 
composition of senior management will look like at the company. The 
new BankAmerica has to reassure investors that they are up to the 
task of managing businesses, like international and capital markets.''
