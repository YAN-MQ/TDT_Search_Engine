With fighting reported to be continuing in the troubled province of 
Kosovo, NATO General Wesley Clarke has had talks with Yugoslav leaders 
in Belgrade. General Clarke, the supreme commander in Europe, was 
expected to warn of the real threat of NATO air strikes unless there 
is compliance with international demands to resolve the crisis peacefully. 
A BBC correspondent in Kosovo says the lack of a cease fire is worsening 
the refugee crisis. He says that most people who fled the fighting 
are still living on open hill sides. From the BBC newsroom in London, 
this is Pamela McCall. You're listening to THE WORLD.
