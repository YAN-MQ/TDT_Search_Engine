Cuban president Fidel Castro has admitted to sending Cuban citizens 
to the United States to gather intelligence on the activities of exile 
groups. Mr. Castro denies they tried to penetrate the U.S. military. 
However, last month, U.S. agents arrested ten alleged Cuban spies 
in Florida. The list of charges include attempting to infiltrate U.S. 
military bases. The Cuban leader made his statement last week during 
an interview at the Eighth American Summit in Portugal.
