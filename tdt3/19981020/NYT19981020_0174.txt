Very early one day recently, when the pale sun was still burning the 
last wisps of fog off the vines, a red van rolled to a stop at the 
Grace Family Vineyards winery near here. No one was about. Out jumped 
a slim woman in black slacks and an assortment of jackets meant to 
ward off the morning chill. In vats on the concrete apron before her 
were fourtons of crushed grapes, Grace Family's entire 1998 harvest. 
Pushing up a sleeve, she thrust her arm deep into the red mush. Fermentation 
had begun. And Heidi Barrett had started her day. Ms. Barrett may 
be California's best-known maker of wines hardly anyone will ever 
drink. She is part of a special breed of California winemaker: she 
owns no winery and grows no grapes. And yet, hers are among the highest-priced 
wines in the world, most of them so rare that they never see the inside 
of a liquor store or a restaurant; they are snapped up by connoisseurs 
and collectors who do not flinch at paying $100 and up for a bottle 
and who vye for places on the (very short) waiting lists of steady 
customers. Ms. Barrett is a consulting enologist, which means she 
makes wine for other people. All the wineries in her exclusive group 
are here in the Napa Valley and most of them are very small. Grace 
Family Vineyards, often rated the most coveted wine made in California, 
will make about 150 cases in 1997. Screaming Eagle Winery produced 
500 cases of wine in 1996. Paradigm, with an annual production of 
about 3,000 cases, is the largest of Ms. Barrett's clients. ``I'd 
say I make about 12,000 cases of wine a year,'' she said, ``equal 
to what you'd expect from a conventional small winery.'' All her wines 
bear her imprint: intense richness, dark, almost opaque color, elegant 
texture and beautiful balance. The wines differ from label to label 
depending on the soil, the sun exposure, the grape varieties, the 
vagaries of wine making and aging and, of course, the whims of her 
clients. ``I try for rich, elegant, balanced wines,'' she said, ``preferably 
made from hillside grapes. Cabernet is my specialty but I like to 
make merlot, zinfandel and sangiovese.'' Ms. Barrett and her cohorts 
in this special field are pacesetters; their wines are fashionable 
and have the cache that the big wineries had 10 years ago. These winemakers 
have the control over their product and freedom of expression that 
they might not have if they were as employees of a winery. Ms. Barrett, 
41, has been around wine all her life. Her father is Richard Peterson, 
one of California's best-known winemakers, who worked variously at 
Beaulieu Vineyards, the Monterey Vineyard and Atlas Peak Vineyards. 
Her husband is Bo Barrett, winemaker and general manager at Chateau 
Montelena in Calistoga. ``I really never thought about any other world,'' 
she said. She studied enology at the University of California at Davis 
from 1975 to 1980, taking several quarters off to ``work the crush,'' 
that is, partake in the harvest in Germany and Australia. After school 
she worked for Justin Meyer at Franciscan Vineyards, then at Rutherford 
Hill and Bouchaine. In 1983 she went to Buehler Vineyards, where they 
made her the winemaker even though she was only 25. She stayed at 
Buehler for six years, during which time she met and married her husband 
_ at a wine tasting _ and had two daughters, Remi and Chelsea, now 
10 and 12 years old, respectively. ``I left Buehler because I wanted 
to work part time while the kids were small,'' Ms. Barrett said. ``For 
the first couple of years I had only two or three clients.'' Her business 
gradually picked up, and clients, like Dalla Valle Vineyards, a highly 
respected Napa winery, with whom she worked for eight years, came 
and went. In her book, that's OK ``The variety has always been there 
and that's what I love,'' she said. That variety includes Barbour 
Vineyards, Jones Family Winery, Lamborn Family Vineyards, Hartwell 
Vineyard, Oakford Cellars, and Vineyard 29. Many of her clients are 
hobbyists, wealthy professional people from the San Francisco area 
who have retired in the Napa Valley or who come on weekends. They 
hire part timers like Ms. Barrett to tend their small vineyards and 
to make their wines. ``I confine myself pretty much to the Napa Valley,'' 
she said. ``to a radius of 30 miles from my home.'' The Barretts live 
near Chateau Montelena at the northern end of the Valley. ``That way 
I can drop the kids off at school and sometimes pick them up in the 
afternoon,'' she said. Because most of her projects are so small, 
she can make several in the same place. For example, Vineyard 29 and 
Barbour Vineyards wines are both made in the Grace Family Vineyard 
winery just north of St. Helena. Others are made at the Napa Wine 
Co., a medium-size wine making facility in Oakville, near the Robert 
Mondavi Winery. The Napa Wine Co. is what's known as a custom crush 
facilty. Winemakers like Ms. Barrett rent the company's winemaking 
equipment, using its tanks to ferment their wines and its storage 
space to age them. At this time of year, when the harvest is in progress, 
as many as 75 winemakers, many of them among the best -known California 
names, make all or part of their wines at the Napa Wine Co. Ms. Barrett 
will not take just anyone as a client. She regularly turns down offers 
from winery owners who will give a great deal to get her to work for 
them. ``She's really tough,'' said Dick Grace admiringly. ``She turns 
down some of these rich business types who aren't used to being turned 
down, especially by a woman.'' During harvest time, Ms. Barrett often 
takes her daughters to the wineries. ``They love to jump into the 
vats and punch down the grapes with their feet,'' she said. ``All 
their friends are jealous and plead to be invited to stomp the grapes. 
Some of them end up doing cannonball dives into the vats. We just 
hose them down when they finish.'' In 1994, for the first time, she 
produced wine under her own label, La Sirena. ``One of my clients 
had some surplus wine made from sangiovese grapes, a 250-case lot,'' 
she said, ``It was excellent stuff and I hated to see it sold off 
in bulk.'' She borrowed $25,000 from a bank, finished the wine, sold 
it within a year and paid the money back. ``It was an entirely new 
experience,'' she said. ``I'm a rock for everyone else, but when it 
comes to my own wine, I can't even watch it being bottled _ I feel 
sick. Is it just what I wanted? Did I forget to do something? Should 
I have waited a little longer? ``Fortunately, as soon as the cork 
is in, you feel better about it _ more excited than nervous.'' La 
Sirena, also made in discouragingly small quantities _ 200 cases of 
cabernet sauvignon, 300 cases of sangiovese _ has become, like most 
of Ms. Barrett's other creations, a sought-after cult wine. One of 
her concerns is the price of the wines she makes. Not what the wineries 
get, which is usually around $100 a bottle, but what the wines trade 
for after they've been sold _ from $300 a bottle up. ``I don't get 
it,'' Ms. Barrett said. ``I make them to be drunk and enjoyed. It's 
rather sad that they go into collections and may never be opened.'' 
Still, there appears to be a bit, just a bit, of guilty pleasure in 
knowing that something you've done is so highly regarded. ``I saw 
the Screaming Eagle somewhere at $900 a bottle,'' she said. ``So, 
for my birthday, I drank one we still had in the cellar. It helped 
me get over being 41.''
