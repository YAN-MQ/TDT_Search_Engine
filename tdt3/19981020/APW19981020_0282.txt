Lawmakers seeking to impeach Boris Yeltsin will ask parliament's scheduling 
committee on Friday to put an impeachment motion on the agenda, a 
lawmaker said Tuesday. Yeltsin's parliamentary foes met Tuesday to 
discuss their campaign to impeach the president, said hard-line chairman 
of parliament's Defense Committee, Viktor Ilyukhin. The campaign started 
long before Russia's current economic crisis, and appears likely to 
fail, as several previous attempts have. Impeachment supporters accuse 
Yeltsin of instigating the 1991 collapse of the Soviet Union, sending 
troops and tanks against his hard-line foes in the previous parliament 
in 1993, and launching the unsuccessful war in separatist Chechnya. 
Parliament's Communist speaker Gennady Seleznyov said he will support 
the impeachment motion, but conceded it may be difficult for the motion 
to gather the two-thirds majority vote it needs to pass in the lower 
house of parliament, the State Duma. ``Accusations of the abuse of 
office on three counts evoke no doubts on my part,'' Seleznyov was 
quoted as saying by the ITAR-Tass news agency. But ``we will have 
to score 300 votes in the State Duma, and it will not be easy,'' Seleznyov 
told reporters during a trip to the Ural Mountains city of Chelyabinsk. 
If an impeachment motion is passed in the Duma, it would then need 
to be approved by a two-thirds majority in parliament's upper house, 
and by both the Constitutional and Supreme Courts _ all of which have 
many Yeltsin supporters.
