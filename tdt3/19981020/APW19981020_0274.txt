The roof is up, the cast for its splashy performances is being auditioned 
and the big marketing push has begun. Like a giant insect, 758 million 
pound (dlrs 1.2 billion) Millennium Dome rises next to the River Thames 
_ and with it the government's hopes of showing that Britain is a 
happening place as the third millennium strikes. The idea for the 
world's largest dome was born in 1993, when U.S. television networks 
began calling the Old Royal Observatory to book locations astride 
the Greenwich Meridian, marker of longitude zero degrees, for millennium 
broadcasts. Skeptics initially ridiculed the idea of a millennium 
spectacular, complete with permanent wide-ranging exhibits and multimedia 
spectaculars on the theme of time, saying it was unworkable. But Trade 
Secretary Peter Mandelson, the Dome's guru, insists Britain is the 
only country that has shown the ambition and boldness to create what 
he dubs ``the most famous building offered to the world in the year 
2000.'' While construction in southeast London is on schedule, a third 
of the necessary sponsorship is still missing. Some exhibits had to 
be redesigned. And critics doubt that the dome, tucked onto an isolated 
finger of industrial land, will have the transportation links to cope 
with a huge influx of visitors in the year 2000. Work on a subway 
link has been delayed and will be finished only just in time. ``I 
am deep in disbelief that they can get 12 million people down to Greenwich 
in a year'' as the English Tourist Board predicts, historian Sir Roy 
Strong said recently. Twice as big as the current record-holder, Atlanta's 
Georgia Dome, the Millennium Dome covers 20 acres (eight hectares), 
has a circumference of two-thirds of a mile (one kilometer) and is 
165 feet (50 meters) high. Forty-four miles (70 kilometers) of cabling 
support the Teflon-coated glass fiber roof. Designed by British architect 
Sir Richard Rogers, it can accommodate up to 37,000 people. In the 
center stands a vast 12,500-seat arena, surrounded by 14 lifestyle 
zones that use hands-on technology to explore themes including national 
identity, the mind, the spirit, rest, global, play and work. In the 
body zone, visitors will walk around inside a giant human figure bigger 
than the Statue of Liberty. Rest will take the form of a giant dreamscape 
with floating 16-seater boats designed to look like beds. The multi-faith 
spirit zone, which has had to be scaled down because it was too heavy 
for its foundations, will include a Christian monastic cloister and 
a Japanese Zen garden. Britain's national lottery is providing 400 
million pounds (dlrs 680 million); the rest will come from private 
sponsorship and ticket sales, merchandising and media rights. Many 
tour companies and local businesses can't wait for it to open. Still, 
realtors say other locals are leaving, fearing traffic jams and increased 
pollution. And environmentalists complain that dome-inspired development 
is destroying rare bird habitats. The government insists the dome 
will recycle wherever possible. Cars will be limited to distant park-and-ride 
sites, and most visitors will arrive by boat, train or the new subway 
extension. ``Initially, I was skeptical _ it is costing a lot,'' said 
Jill Vonberg from Stowmarket, eastern England, who toured Greenwich's 
millennium visitor center recently for a preview. ``Now,'' she said, 
``I think it will be something to leave to our children.''
