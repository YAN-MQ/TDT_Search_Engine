Here's Jane pauley with a program note. Thanks, Brian. Tonight on 
"time and again," from television stardom to the big screen. Oprah 
Winfrey and the dream she's dreamed of making for years, "beloved." 
We'll hear from her and Danny Glover and look back to "the color purple." 
Oprah Winfrey coming up next. That is time and again with Jane pauley. 
And that is our broadcast for this Tuesday night. We hope to see you 
right back here this same time tomorrow evening. I'm Brian Williams. 
For all of us working the night shift, good night. The queen of daytime 
television and the movie role of a lif runner. That disclaimer aside 
my prediction was not only wrong it was really wrong. Hopefully you 
did not put your money where my mouth was or wherever manager bruce 
bochy's head was. Thank you for your understanding. We're here twice 
nightly. "The news with Brian Williams" is next. For all of us who 
prepared this program for you, we thank you, we bid you good night.
