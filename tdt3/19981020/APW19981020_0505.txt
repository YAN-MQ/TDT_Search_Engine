Lennox Lewis' manager expects to announce the date and location of 
the heavyweight unification fight with Evander Holyfield by the end 
of the week. Frank Maloney said Tuesday he expects Lewis to sign a 
contract for the fight in the next few days. Lewis was expected to 
sign Monday, but Maloney blamed the delay on ``legal problems and 
contract technicalities.'' Holyfield, the WBA and IBF champion, signed 
last week and is expected to earn dlrs 20 million. Lewis, the WBC 
champion, is expected to earn about dlrs 8 million. Maloney said Mike 
Tyson victory's Monday in getting back his boxing license would not 
affect the Holyfield-Lewis bout, expected in February or March. And 
he welcomed back Tyson. ``I think it's good for boxing,'' Maloney 
said. ``You can't stop a man from earning a living. I just hope he 
uses it for the good of Mike Tyson and good of boxing.'' ``Mike Tyson 
is still the biggest money-maker in boxing,'' he added. ``They made 
such a big thing out of something that happened in the most physical 
and emotional sport we know. We all make mistakes. There are things 
in my life I wish I hadn't done.'' Maloney said he expected Tyson 
to have two warm-up bouts before being ready to fight _ as widely 
speculated _ the winner of the Holyfield-Lewis fight.
