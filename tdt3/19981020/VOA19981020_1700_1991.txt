Hundreds of bodies have been buried in a mass grave in Southeastern 
Nigeria near the site of a deadly explosion and fire. Correspondent 
John Pitman has the report from the VOA West Africa bureau. Local 
officials and media reports say at least 1,000 people were killed 
in the explosion and fire which engulfed a crowd of civilians on Saturday 
as they tried to collect spilled gasoline from a broken pipeline. 
An official death toll has not been released by the government, however, 
local hospitals say hundreds of burn victims have died in the last 
24 hours. Hundreds of bodies that were burned beyond recognition have 
been buried in mass graves near the accident site. Nigeria's military 
government has ordered an investigation into the accident which occurred 
after a pipeline carrying gasoline was punctured sometime late last 
week. The petroleum ministry says the pipeline was sabotaged, however 
no one has claimed responsibility for the damage. John Pitman, VOA 
News, West Africa bureau.
