President Boris Yeltsin, who is still recovering from a respiratory 
infection, returned to the Kremlin on Tuesday and reaffirmed he would 
not seek re-election. During a meeting with Prime Minister Yevgeny 
Primakov, Yeltsin reiterated that he had no intention of running for 
a third presidential term in 2000. ``I have said so many times that 
I will not run in 2000,'' Yeltsin said. ``But they have brought it 
to a point where this is being reviewed by the Constitutional Court. 
I will not run, so why are you tormenting me?'' he said. Russia's 
Constitution appears to rule out another term for Yeltsin, but presidential 
aides have said that his first term began before the constitution 
was adopted, and therefore should not count toward the two-term limit. 
Despite Yeltsin's repeated denials of any intention to run, the parliamentary 
opposition has asked the court to rule on the issue. Hearings began 
last week. The president and his doctors insist that Yeltsin will 
serve out the rest of his term, and adamantly deny speculation that 
he has serious health problems _ a suggestion that is raised every 
time Yeltsin catches a cold. But the influential magazine Itogi quoted 
top Yeltsin aides in its Tuesday issue as saying the president is 
seriously ill and his staff is trying to ``pull the president through'' 
the remaining 20 months of his term. Much of that time will be taken 
up by parliamentary and then presidential election campaigns, as well 
as Christmas and New Year celebrations and summer vacations. So ``the 
president will not particularly interest anybody,'' Itogi quoted an 
unidentified Kremlin aide as saying. But this ``scheme for turning 
the president into a political ghost'' may be derailed by political 
opposition or the worsening economic crisis, Itogi said. ``So pulling 
the president, like a cotton-wool mattress, over the remaining year 
and half, will likely fail,'' Itogi said. During the meeting with 
Yeltsin, Primakov also denied suggestions that he planned to run for 
president in 2000. ``This is nonsense and has nothing to do with reality,'' 
Primakov said. ``I would not be able to head the government now if 
I was thinking about the presidency.'' On Tuesday, Yeltsin also discussed 
the government's measures to pay state workers' back wages and pensions 
during a meeting with Primakov and other officials, the ITAR-Tass 
news agency reported. Yeltsin also met with Defense Minister Sergei 
Stepashin, head of the Federal Security Service Vladimir Putin, and 
Border Guards chief Konstantin Totsky, ITAR-Tass reported. Totsky 
was to travel to the Central Asian country of Tajikistan later Tuesday 
to look into the tense situation on the country's border with Afghanistan, 
ITAR-Tass said. Russia and the former Soviet republics in Central 
Asia are worried about a possible spillover of violence and influx 
of weapons and refugees from Afghanistan. Yeltsin's latest illness 
forced him to cut short a visit to Central Asia earlier this month, 
and he spent most of last week at a country residence outside Moscow. 
The president also has canceled a trip to Malaysia scheduled for next 
month. Yeltsin has been plagued by recurring health problems in recent 
years. He had heart bypass surgery two years ago, and has made fewer 
and fewer public appearances since then.
