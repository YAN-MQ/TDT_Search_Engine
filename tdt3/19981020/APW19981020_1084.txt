Russian researchers have almost completed a new artificial heart and 
can start implanting it next year _ if they can find the money for 
the last stage of its development, a news agency said Tuesday. ``The 
artificial heart is practically ready and its fine-tuning doesn't 
require very big spending,'' top Russian heart surgeon Valery Shumakov 
said, according to the Interfax news agency. The heart is being developed 
by the Russian Health Ministry's Institute for Transplants and Artificial 
Organs. The institute isn't counting on any more government money 
for the artificial heart because ``even the medics' salaries are paid 
in fits and starts,'' largely because of the latest economic crisis, 
Shumakov said. Instead, the institute is looking for a Russian business 
sponsor, Interfax said. Shumakov was the first doctor in the Soviet 
Union to conduct a successful heart transplant, in 1987. Since then 
about 100 heart transplants have been performed in Russia, Interfax 
said.
