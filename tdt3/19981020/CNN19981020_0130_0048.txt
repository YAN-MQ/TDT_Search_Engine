"Headline News," I'm David Goodnow. Those stories in a moment, but 
first the rain is complicating matters in texas, where a weekend of 
devastating storms and flooding killed at least 14 people. Three children 
are missing, whole buildings have been wiped out and a Freight train 
derailed when a rain-weakened trestle buckled. Bob Cain has more on 
the situation. In some areas, so much water came up, so fast, that 
the damage looks more like the aftermath of a tornado than a river 
that overflowed its banks. I don't recognize this river. This isn't 
the river that I saw a couple of days ago. Texas officials say nearly 
a quarter of the state's 254 counties have at least some flooding, 
and the number of texans who have lost their homes, or have been forced 
to leave their homes, has climbed into the thousands. We've had over 
5,200 people sheltered from this particular event. As the governor 
mentioned, we continue to really operate in a 911 operation as we 
speak. The flood watch covers an area roughly stretching from Houston 
to san Antonio to Austin. Authorities say they expect thousands of 
head of livestock to die in the flooding. The river came up so fast, 
no one had a chance to get 'em out in time. And the safe places they've 
been putting them, weren't safe this time. Texas governor, George 
bush, says damage assessment is under way, and Washington has promised 
very quick action on requests for disaster aid. Nature's -- nature 
is devastating, as we know. I mean, it was three months ago that we 
were praying for rain. There were some happy endings -- a cow, stranded 
on a roof and a Horse, stranded on a tiny patch of spongy high ground, 
were both rescued. Bob Cain, "Headline News."
