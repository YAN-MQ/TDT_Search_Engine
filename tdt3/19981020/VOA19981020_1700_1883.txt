The Palestinian militant group, Hamas, has claimed responsibility 
for a grenade attack that injured 64 Israelis on Monday. Israeli officials 
arrested a 29-year-old Salaam Rajab Sarsuer following the attack on 
Beersheba. Israel says Mr. Sarsuer also confessed to other violent 
attacks in the past two months. Palestinian officials say he was being 
blackmailed by Israeli intelligence into working as a double agent.
