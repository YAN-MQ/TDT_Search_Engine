From National Public Radio News in Washington, I'm Frank Stachio. 
The House today passed a $500 billion bill to fund nearly a third 
of the federal government in its last scheduled vote of the year. 
The House voted 333 to 95 for the 4,000-page bill. That's a catchall 
for Congress' unfinished business, including eight of the 13 appropriations 
bills that fund the government.
