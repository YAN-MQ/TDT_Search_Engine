Justice department and Microsoft attorneys returned to court in Washington 
today on day two of the landmark antitrust trial. Microsoft's lead 
attorney wrapped up his opening statement in two hours. John Warden 
said the government is wrong in saying Microsoft operates as a Monopoly. 
He said Microsoft is not creating any barriers to other software companies 
and said there is no law against playing hard in the business world. 
And Microsoft shares, during the session, fell 2 11/16 to 10 3/8. 
Microsoft just announced its earnings for the quarter, well above 
expectations, 62 cents a share.
