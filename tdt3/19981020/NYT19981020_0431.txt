Lenny Bruce's last laugh echoes throughout ``Lenny Bruce: Swear to 
Tell the Truth,'' a cleverly titled documentary recalling his life, 
work and punishing legal travails. In this intimate and affectingly 
nostalgic portrait, the lacerating comic emerges as someone whose 
talent and long shadow have unequivocally withstood the test of time. 
The dirtiest jokester of the 1950s and '60s still sounds as fearless 
here as ever, while his appalled enemies appear small-minded and quaint. 
And Lenny Bruce's notoriously raw humor takes on a rueful innocence 
beside the much more vulgar standards of comedy today. ``As you look 
back on it now, Kafka could not have written it or imagined it or 
created it,'' says Martin Garbus, who was Bruce's lawyer in the 1964 
New York obscenity trial that effectively ended Bruce's career. This 
documentary, directed by Robert Weide, compellingly illustrates that 
point of view. Visibly charting Bruce's ebullient rise and terrible 
fall through the use of home movies, old photos, vintage television 
clips and many interviews with friends and relatives, the documentary 
recalls the sad trajectory of the man who once said, ``It's chic to 
arrest me.'' And it shows Bruce's transformation from the hippest, 
most caustic figure of his day to the broken man who pleaded with 
a judge: ``I so desperately want your respect. Please don't lock up 
these words.'' Weide, who has specialized in producing or directing 
television documentaries about comic performers (among them W.C. Fields 
and Mort Sahl), has compiled this portrait in straightforward talking-heads 
style, but enlivened it with frequent glimpses of Bruce. Bruce's mother, 
Sally Marr, was interviewed at length while at the beauty parlor and 
supplied Weide with running commentary about the son she called ``a 
melancholy child.'' (She died last year.) Ms. Marr, her daughter-in-law 
Honey and granddaughter Kitty, all heard here, also provided the filmmaker 
with family snapshots and film scenes that bring Bruce's jubilant 
side to life. Images of his early days show a lean, sexy iconoclast 
with the world on a string. ``Lenny Bruce: Swear to Tell the Truth,'' 
which opens Wednesday at the Film Forum, offers a look at Bruce's 
developing comic style. Very early, he's seen imitating Katharine 
Hepburn in an act so clean-cut that it pleases the host of Arthur 
Godfrey's television show. But not much later, Bruce was experimenting 
famously with racial epithets on the theory that ``if you say it enough, 
it loses its meaning.'' He briefly tried writing and acting in Z-level 
crime films. Then he began to work in strip clubs and, as the film's 
narrator, Robert De Niro, explains: ``In burlesque joints, clean jokes 
could get you thrown off the stage. The cheesier the dive, the freer 
Lenny became. And before long, Dirty Lenny was born.'' Some of Dirty 
Lenny's best-known bits are heard here, illustrating their streak 
of devastating social criticism. (``How to Relax Your Colored Friends 
at Parties'' is one.) The film strongly maintains that it was this, 
more than the use of profanities now heard freely at multiplexes, 
on records and on television, that sealed Bruce's fate. It traces 
a snowball effect after Bruce was first arrested and accused the legal 
authorities of trying to extort a bribe from him in exchange for freedom. 
Certainly the combined effects of antagonizing the police and the 
Catholic church earned Bruce no good will from those who could break 
him. ``They would arrest him for obscenity, but it was mostly a cover 
for arresting him for blasphemy,'' states one friend, Paul Krassner. 
``And he became almost a Dostoyevskian character in his obsession 
with the law as a redeeming force,'' says another, Nat Hentoff. Candid 
scenes of Bruce clowning with Hentoff also clearly reveal Bruce's 
drug use, another factor in his destruction. Loaded with amphetamines, 
he fools around frenziedly and plays the piano with his feet. Poignant 
images of an increasingly bloated, ravaged Bruce in his final years, 
before his death at 40 in 1966, show a man ruined physically, emotionally 
and professionally for performing with no more license, and so much 
more honesty and conviction, than most of his successors do today.
