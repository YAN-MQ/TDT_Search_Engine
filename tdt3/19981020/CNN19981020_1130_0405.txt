Cuba has sent spies to the United States. That's the word from Cuban 
President Fidel Castro, in an interview with cnn. Castro claims the 
United States allows its residents to carry out terrorist acts against 
Cuba, therefore Cuba has the right to have spies on U.S. soil. He 
says the spies are only trying to gather information on activities 
by anti-Castro exiles, not on the U.S. military.
