The International Football Federation's Women's World Cup Organizing 
Committee is conducting its venue tour for next year's championship 
in the United States. Monday, officials paid a visit to Jack Ken Cook 
Stadium outside of Washington. That's the home of the NFL's Washington 
Redskins. VOA sports editor Parke Brewer has more. As officials tour 
the year-old stadium, brightly colored lights on the huge end zone 
scoreboards flashed out "Welcome FEFA," the nickname for soccer's 
world governing body. Next to that, the huge video screen showed highlights 
of the last Women's World Cup in Sweden three years ago. This tour 
is critical in finalizing decisions on ticketing, technology, press 
operations, television, and hospitality. FEFA's chairman for the Women's 
World Cup, Norwegian Pierre Andall, told VOA Sports Jack Ken Cook 
Stadium is top in the world among facilities not designed exclusively 
for soccer. That's probably the best stadium I ever saw suitable for 
soccer, maybe competing with a stadium in Saudi Arabia, the King Fat 
Stadium. The variety in facilities here is by far better. Women's 
World Cup games next year will also be played in such cities as Chicago, 
New York, and Boston. The FEFA tour ends Friday at the Rose Bowl outside 
Los Angeles where the 1999 championship match will be held July 10th.
