Germany's victorious Social Democrats on Tuesday chose Wolfgang Thierse 
as president of the Bundestag, or lower house of parliament, the first 
time the post has been filled by a politician from the former East 
Germany. Thierse, 54, narrowly defeated Christel Hanewinckel, also 
from eastern Germany, whose candidacy was supported by many female 
members of parliament. The Bundestag president becomes a de facto 
leader of the country in the event anything happens to the chancellor. 
The Social Democrats also voted in lawyer Peter Struck to lead the 
party in the Bundestag. Struck, 55, was elected by a wide margin to 
replace Rudolf Scharping.
