Belarus can play as important a role in Europe as Japan does in Asia, 
President Alexander Lukashenko said Tuesday. ``Our future in Europe 
is equal to the role of Japan in Asia,'' Lukashenko said in an interview 
with Japanese journalists. ``Belarus today, not possessing a huge 
potential of natural resources, has a great intellectual potential, 
a high level of education and a high enough level of technology,'' 
he said in a portion of the interview broadcast on national radio. 
``Thus, in Europe, we must play the role you have played in Asia,'' 
he said. Lukashenko has done little to reform the Belarusian economy 
since the collapse of the Soviet Union. He is frequently criticized 
by human rights groups for cracking down on dissent. ``But for the 
Russian turmoil and the world financial crisis as a whole, this year's 
economic indicators (in Belarus) would be better,'' he told a separate 
group of reporters in Minsk. He said an International Monetary Fund 
delegation was expected in Belarus in November to negotiate a cooperation 
agreement. Lukashenko also called for a restoration of the Soviet-era 
Comecon trading bloc that linked the Soviet Union with its eastern 
European and other Communist allies.
