A Boston hospital has found computers can cure one widespread problem 
-- doctors' unreadable handwriting. It found the number of serious 
medication errors dropped by more than half once doctors started typing 
their prescriptions into a computer. The computer also limited doses 
to appropriate amounts and double checked for other problems, like 
drug allergies. The report is in this week's "journal of the American 
medical association."
