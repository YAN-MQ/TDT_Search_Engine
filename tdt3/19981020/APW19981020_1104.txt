Four more Daimler shareholders have filed lawsuits challenging the 
planned merger with Chrysler, a Stuttgart court said Tuesday. After 
two were filed last week, Daimler said the suits could delay the deal, 
expected to be finalized by the end of the year. A regional court, 
meanwhile, ruled that the company's offices could not be searched 
to produce the minutes of Daimler's extraordinary Sept. 18 shareholders 
meeting approving the merger demanded by one of the plaintiffs. Shareholder 
Karsten Trippel received only his own questions and answers from Daimler 
officials when he asked for the full transcript. Daimler argues it 
is not obliged to produce the records. Another Stuttgart court is 
due to rule on the company's position later this week. Board member 
Manfred Gentz said the legal challenges may delay the deal, but would 
not weaken the new company. The deal is at a critical stage, as Daimler 
shares must be swapped by Friday for shares in the new company. ``If, 
as expected, the necessary exchange of shares is reached, then the 
merger will happen,'' Gentz said. Seventy-five percent of Daimler 
shares on an undiluted basis must be exchanged for shares in the new 
company for the deal to go through. But the two automakers want an 
exchange of at least 90 percent, which will allow them to use the 
more favorable ``pooling of interests'' accounting method
