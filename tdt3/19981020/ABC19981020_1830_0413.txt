In St. Paul, Minnesota, today, lawyers for Paula Jones tried to convince 
a Panel of judges that her sexual harassment suit against President 
Clinton should be reinstated. The case that spawned the Monica Lewinsky 
investigation was thrown out of court last April. Here is ABC's Jackie 
Judd. I'm not going to answer any questions. Lawyers for the president 
and for Paula Jones entered the courthouse frustrated that weeks of 
settlement talks went nowhere. Inside, the new argument that Jones' 
lawyer James Fisher made was the case should be reinstated because 
Mr. Clinton "split hairs, dodged questions, flat out lied" when he 
fefed last January about his relationship with monica Lewinsky. This 
court needs to send a clear message that will be heard all the way 
to the district of Columbia that our civil justice system will not 
tolerate nor countenance perjury obstruction of justice subornation 
of perjury. One of Mr. Clinton's lawyer's Amy sabrin argued the Lewinsky 
matter was irrelevant to the sexual harassment case, that the lower 
court was right in throwing out the lawsuit because Jones' never proved 
she was harmed by Mr.Clinton. There were no explicit threats of reprisal 
and there were no reprisals. The judges may take weeks, maybe even 
months, on whether to reinstate the case. All the talk was about a 
financial settlement. What happened? Well, they were pretty close, 
somewhere in the neighborhood of $700,000 to $1 million. Than Paula 
Jones heard that once the lawyers got their cut, she wouldn't be left 
with much. The lawyers started hiring lawyers to protect their own 
financial stake. A New York developer said he would put $1 million 
of his own money into the pot. The joans' liked that. They wanted 
his money swelgs the president's. And not likely to happen now. Not 
in the near future, but maybe down the road. Jackie Judd on the Paula 
Jones case today.
