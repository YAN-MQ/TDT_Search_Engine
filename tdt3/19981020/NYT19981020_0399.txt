In a move that repudiates the purported turnaround of the Sunbeam 
Corp., the troubled maker of home appliances said Tuesday that it 
had restated financial results from six quarters to adjust for inflated 
profits and greater losses than previously reported. The restatement, 
which amends the results from the fourth quarter of 1996 through the 
first quarter of this year, contradicts claims by Albert J. Dunlap, 
the company's former chairman and chief executive, that he had fixed 
the company and delivered its best year ever in 1997. The company 
now says that some of the revenue gains and profits for that year 
reflected errors in accounting rather than a big recovery for the 
maker of Oster blenders and Sunbeam electric blankets. Sunbeam said 
that restated revenues from the first quarter of this year are $248 
million, not the $244 million originally reported. The restatement 
also reflects a substantially larger net loss for the period of $54 
million, or 63 cents a share instead of $45 million, or 52 cents a 
share. For 1997, Sunbeam said sales were actually $1.073 billion instead 
of $1.168 billion and that net income for the year was nearly three 
times lower than what was originally reported: $38 million, or 44 
cents a share, instead of $109 million, or $1.25 a share. What is 
more, had it not been for a $59 million gain in certain one-time benefits, 
the company would have reported a loss from continuing operations 
of $6.4 million instead of earnings from continuing operations of 
$52 million. Also, revenue generated from so-called bill and hold 
tactics and guaranteed consignment sales resulted in sales being booked 
in the wrong quarters. For 1996, the results were actually better 
than first reported. The company is now reporting a net loss of $215 
million, or $2.59 a share, instead of the $235 million, or $2.83 a 
share, loss it initially reported. The loss was originally reported 
after Dunlap arrived in July 1996 but well before he implemented his 
turnaround plan. At the time, he said the company was ``a disaster'' 
and needed his talents. Sunbeam dismissed him last June after his 
drastic cost-cutting failed to strengthen the company's stock price. 
Tuesday, Dunlap characterized the restatement as ``technical accounting 
issues'' and said he had relied on the company's outside auditors. 
``The items at issue in Sunbeam's restatement are items that were 
fully disclosed to and examined by Sunbeam's outside auditors, Arthur 
Andersen, before they certified Sunbeam's 1996 and 1997 financial 
statements, and the conclusions certified by Arthur Andersen were 
fully reviewed by Sunbeam's audit committee prior the their release,'' 
he said. The Sunbeam audit was conducted by the company's audit committee 
of its board of directors, Arthur Andersen and Deloitte &AMP; Touche, 
which was hired as a consultant to assist. Sunbeam's stock closed 
at $7.6875 Tuesday, up $1.1875, indicating that investors considered 
the announcement as removing ``a piece of uncertainty,'' said Scott 
Graham an analyst with CIBC Oppenheimer. Investors also seemed to 
give a vote of confidence to current management, which said it was 
focusing on returning the company to profitability. But with such 
dismal results overall for the restated periods, massive debt of $1.4 
billion and inflated inventory levels, analysts said Sunbeam's future 
still seemed bleak. ``They're just trying to see how long they can 
hold it up,'' said Nicholas P. Heymann of Prudential Securities. That 
is not the way management portrayed the company's outlook. ``With 
the restatement behind us, we will now be able to fully focus our 
efforts on growing the business and restoring profitability,'' said 
Jerry W. Levin, Sunbeam's president and chief executive officer. But 
he also said that the company's financial performance for the rest 
of the year would be poor. Even with the restatement, analysts said 
that by not offering a look at its balance sheet, Sunbeam's management 
failed to provide key information that could have given a clearer 
picture of the company's potential. ``When you consider the debt load 
and the fact that the company has no operating momentum whatsoever 
and the time it will take to work off inventory, I don't think the 
company did much in terms of showing us how it is going to manage 
for the long term,'' Graham said.
