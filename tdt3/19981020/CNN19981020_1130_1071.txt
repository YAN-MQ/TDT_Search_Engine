Online travel agents say they're being treated unfairly. The U.S. 
department of transportation is looking into whether airlines discriminate 
against online travel services. Among the complaints, Internet travel 
agencies say they earn lower commissions and have tighter restrictions 
than traditional travel agents. Airlines such as southwest say the 
tighter restrictions are designed to prevent users from booking tickets 
they don't intend to buy. The Internet accounted for about $900 million 
of travel last year.
