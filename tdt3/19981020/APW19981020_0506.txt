To escape poverty at home, hundreds of Indonesian women are working 
for just one Singapore dollar (62 cents) a month as domestic servants 
in Singapore. The regional economic crisis has increased the supply 
of imported maids in this prosperous island state, prompting local 
maid agencies to cut already low rates to a symbolic fee. About 100,000 
house maids work up to 90 hours a week in often grueling conditions, 
and earn an average of 250 Singapore dollars (dlrs 150) a month. Most 
of the maids are from the Philippines, whose government recently declared 
it will not let them travel to work in Singapore for anything less 
than 350 Singapore dollars (dlrs 212) a month. But in April, Singapore's 
Delijoy Employment Agency began offering Indonesian maids at a dollar 
a month for the first five months, after which their salary should 
increase to 230 Singapore dollars (dlrs 140) a month. The agency receives 
a finder's fee from the employers. Protesting the token fee, the Indonesian 
government last week suspended all maid exports to Singapore for the 
next three months. So far, about 1,000 Indonesian women have agreed 
to work under the new scheme, Delijoy said Tuesday. ``I don't mind,'' 
Yuyun Juju, 28, told The Straits Times newspaper. ``Life is difficult 
in the kampung. That is why I need this job.'' Singaporeans, who rely 
on maids for their typical dual career lifestyle, seem divided on 
the issue of cheap maids. ``For us employers, we have nothing much 
to lose if we send the maid back or when she runs away,'' said Leong 
Yoke Yeng, a 40-year-old businesswoman who had just hired an Indonesian 
maid from Delijoy. ``My experience with maids is that for the first 
few months when they go without pay, they tend to be more hardworking,'' 
she said. ``Anyway, she doesn't really need money. Everything she 
needs she can get at home, or I will pay.'' However, teacher Lim Su 
Mei, 29, disagreed with the cheap maids. ``I think it's disgusting. 
We're hiring a maid, not buying a slave.'' Because most Filipinas 
speak English, they remain the most sought-after maids in Singapore 
despite their relatively high salaries. Indonesian maids mostly communicate 
in Bahasa Indonesia. Though a maid's working hours or living conditions 
are not regulated by any law, they live under severe restrictions. 
A maid must not get pregnant or get married to a citizen while working 
in Singapore. They are also regularly screened for pregnancy as well 
as for venereal and other diseases.
