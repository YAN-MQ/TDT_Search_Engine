An arbitrator has rejected the NBA players' union claim that all players 
with guaranteed contracts should be paid during the lockout. The ruling 
saves owners from having to pay more than $700 million in salary. 
The decision affects 226 players, who were hoping to see some cash 
during the lockout.
