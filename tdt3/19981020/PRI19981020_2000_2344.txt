Tread carefully because we're going to a land where humans are merely 
visitors in today's Geography Quiz. We're in Alaska searching for 
protected federal wilderness. This place is huge covering 300,000 
acres of rolling hills and lush forests. Coastal birds love it here 
since it's one of the richest feeding grounds in the nation. Pacific 
black brant goose stop here to munch on mounds of eel grass before 
their 60-hour winter flight to Mexico. Brown bears roam this land 
and a herd of caribou spends the winter here. Recently, this natural 
paradise became a battleground. Alaska won a congressional vote to 
build a 27-mile dirt road through our mystery location to connect 
the remote town of King Cove to the less remote town of Cold Bay. 
King Cove residents wanted the road for medical emergencies but environmentalists 
insisted it would threaten the wilderness and the wildlife. So where 
is this pristine place? We'll have the answer in just a few minutes.
