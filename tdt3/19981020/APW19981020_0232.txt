An International Monetary Fund mission is scheduled to arrive in Kiev 
this weekend to consider the disbursement of new installments of its 
recently approved loan to Ukraine, a news agency reported Tuesday. 
The IMF team is to discuss with Ukrainian officials new measures to 
increase the budget revenues that the cash-poor government needs to 
finance its welfare expenditures, Finance Minister Ihor Mitiukov said, 
according to Interfax. ``Balancing budget revenues and expenditures 
is going to be the main, the most serious, topic of our negotiations,'' 
Mitiukov said. The IMF dist republic will receive another dlrs 125 
million from the IMF by the end of the year if it meets the fund's 
requirements for granting the aid. Ukraine's government is chronically 
short of cash due to poor tax collection. It's suffered another blow 
to its shaky financial system from the the economic crisis in neighboring 
Russia. The government has asked the European Union for an ECU 150 
million (dlrs 182 million) loan to support its currency market and 
provide for currency reserves to be used by importers. An EU delegation 
is currently negotiating with government officials in Kiev over disbursing 
an ECU 50 million (dlrs 60.6 million) tranche of the loan by the end 
of 1998, according to Joly Dixon, who is heading the visiting EU team. 
Dixon said Monday that disbursement of the EU loan would depend on 
Ukraine's taking quick measures to liberalize foreign trade, and reform 
the banking system and energy sector. Ukraine has already asked the 
Japanese government for a dlrs 80 million credit, and hopes to finalize 
the deal soon, Mitiukov said.
