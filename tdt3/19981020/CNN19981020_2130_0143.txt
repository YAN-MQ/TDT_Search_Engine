Federal appeals court judges are considering whether to reinstate 
Paula jones' sexual harassment lawsuit against President Clinton. 
Her attorneys made their case today, arguing the president lied under 
oath when he was asked about his relationship with Monica Lewinsky. 
Mr. Clinton's attorneys say the Lewinsky affair has nothing to do 
with the jones case, and even if Jones's allegations are true, they 
don't constitute sexual harassment. Both sides have indicated they 
are open to a settlement. The wheels of justice sometimes grind very 
slowly. We would agree that, if justice can be obtained through a 
reasonable, fair settlement more promptly than further litigation, 
we'd be happy to consider that. But justice will not be obtained by 
an unreasonable settlement. I don't think our client will consider 
such a settlement offer. The stumbling block, the deal breaker throughout 
was the requirement of paula Jones that President Clinton apologize 
for conduct which the president adamantly denied occurred. This we 
would not do. A few weeks ago, council for Paula Jones communicated 
with me and demanded a settlement, but they dropped this requirement 
of an apology. President Clinton denies making a sexual advance toward 
Jones in 1991, when he was governor of Arkansas.
