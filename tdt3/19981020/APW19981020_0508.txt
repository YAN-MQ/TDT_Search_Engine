Vietnam will be host for an international meeting next week to assess 
the ``20/20 initiative,'' which was aimed at increasing spending in 
poor countries for basic social services. Representatives from 29 
developing countries, 21 donor nations and 12 multilateral organizations 
are expected to attend the three-day session opening Oct. 27. Under 
the initiative, governments are supposed to allocate about 20 percent 
of their budgets _ and donors 20 percent of their aid budgets _ to 
ensure basic education, primary health care, reproductive health and 
population programs, nutrition programs and safe water and sanitation. 
According to a joint statement issued Tuesday by the U.N. Children's 
Fund, the U.N. Development Program and Vietnam's Labor Ministry, partial 
data suggest that about 13 percent of national budgets and 10 percent 
of donor funding is being allocated to such basic services. The first 
20/20 initiative meeting was held in Oslo, Norway, in April 1996.
