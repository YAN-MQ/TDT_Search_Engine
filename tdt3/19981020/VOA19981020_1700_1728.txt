Thank you, Tom, for that look at some personality. Time now to talk 
about frequencies. If you're listening to us in Oceania or the Pacific, 
you can consider switching over right now to 9.705 megahertz short 
wave, which we're now broadcasting on from 21 hours to zero hour universal 
time. You know, we'd be happy to mail you a VOA frequency schedule. 
Just send us your name and address. Our address is VOA News Now, Voice 
of America, Washington D.C., 20547, USA. Or you can E-mail us that 
information. Our E-mail address is newsnow@voa.gov. and this time 
"newsnow" is one word. Our Web site address is www.voa.gov/newsnow. 
It's 21 hours, 30 universal time, and this is VOA News Now. Jordan's 
King Hussein joins the Mid East peace summit near Washington as President 
Clinton returns to the talks. Aid shipments resume to ethnic Albanians 
in Serbia's Kosovo province. Serbian lawmakers ban what authorities 
call propaganda broadcast funded by foreign governments. All that 
and disturbing reports about the renewed strength of diabetes coming 
up in our next half hour of VOA News Now. First, a summary of late 
world news.
