Good evening. We are going to begin tonight with two big investments 
of American time and money. Tonight, in two of the world's most dangerous 
places, the Middle East and the former Yugoslavia, millions of people 
want to know whether the Clinton administration is going to make their 
lives better and safer. The first test involves the Israelis, the 
Palestinians an Mr. Clinton. Here's ABC's Sam Donaldson. Once again, 
President Clinton traveled to the wye plantation conference center 
on Maryland's eastern shore to supervise the mideast negotiations. 
And today, he called in some help. King Hussein of Jordan, ill with 
cancer and in this country recuperating from chemotherapy, was invited 
by the president to come to wye to lend his good offices. Hussein 
has been able to deal with both sides effectively in the past. The 
president met separately with Israeli prime minister Netanyahu and 
palestinian leader Arafat. At dinner last night, the principals had 
met face-to-face and made some progress, enough so, that today, state 
department spokesman Jamie Rubin was able to say this afternoon -- 
We're, I think, past the atmospherics and down to hard bargains. The 
core of the bargains is over the security arrangement worked out with 
the help of the U.S. central intelligence agency. Israeli prime minister 
Netanyahu and his hawkish foreign minister ariel sharon say the security 
timetable for dismantling terrorist organizations isn't specific enough. 
Bringing the charge from Palestinian leader Arafat that the Israelis 
really are just looking for an excuse to walk out without a deal. 
Still, aides at the wye center this evening are drafting the language 
of a Comprehensive agreement on almost all the issues, including security, 
and how much longer before it is either accepted or not. This cannot 
go on indefinitely, but we're taking it one day at a time. In fact, 
the negotiations will almost certainly continue tomorrow with a wrapup 
session there will be a signing ceremony at the White House. Although 
that could happen on Thursday. Whether the agreement is truly substantive 
remains to be seen. It's hard to see how the sides can't come up with 
something they can at least call progress and the president will quickly 
be able to claim success. Many thanks. Sam Donaldson at the White 
House.
