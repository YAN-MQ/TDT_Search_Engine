With Jordan's King Hussein coming from a hospital bed to join President 
Clinton at the Middle East peace talks on Tuesday, optimism rose that 
at least a partial settlement will be reached between Israelis and 
Palestinians after more than 19 months of stalemate and six days of 
talking here. But the Americans and the Palestinians are still pushing 
for a full settlement of this interim accord, so that final status 
talks can start now, just seven months before the Oslo process is 
due to end on May 4. Some officials said that the parties were working 
on a ``grand bargain'' that would involve tradeoffs on the key disputed 
issues and produce a comprehensive settlement. But no one would predict 
success in this effort. American officials cautioned that agreement 
of any sort was by no means assured and that the talks, originally 
scheduled to end on Sunday night with a signing ceremony on Monday, 
would go late into the night again on Tuesday and then into Wednesday. 
But the officials were also laying plans for a signing ceremony at 
the White House on Thursday and another ceremony, at the State Department, 
to mark the resumption of intensive talks on a final peace settlement 
between Israel and the Palestinians. However, one official cautioned: 
``The easiest thing in the world is to create a ceremony. I wouldn't 
take a tentative date too seriously.'' Clinton's spokesman, Joseph 
Lockhart, said the president would fly to Los Angeles on Saturday, 
picking up a fundraising trip for Democratic candidates he postponed 
to continue these negotiations. Clinton left the talks just after 
midnight on Tuesday morning after making ``significant progress,'' 
officials said, on key aspects of the security package that Israel 
demands from the Palestinians in return for another 13 percent of 
West Bank land. He returned here just after noon on Tuesday for another 
long round of meetings, continuing his extraordinary personal investment 
of 45 hours over five of the last six days. Hussein, who is battling 
non-Hodgkins lymphoma, is expected to remain overnight at the Wye 
Conference Center near here. The State Department spokesman, James 
Rubin, said on Tuesday that ``there are still gaps _ significant ones'' 
between the parties. He said that Israeli-Palestinian negotiations 
were continuing on issues besides security, like safe passage for 
Palestinians between the West Bank and Gaza Strip. ``Clearly we're 
in a phase of very hard bargaining,'' Rubin said. ``A lot of the underbrush 
has been cleared away. The end game is becoming increasingly serious.'' 
One sticking point is the Israeli demand for putting on trial a specific 
list of Palestinians, including some members of the Palestinian police 
and self-defense forces. Another is the method by which Israel will 
guarantee safe passage for Palestinians between the West Bank and 
the Gaza Strip. The Israelis are offering regularly scheduled trains 
and busses, while the Palestinians are insisting that individuals 
be allowed to travel in cars. The Palestinians also want clear assurances 
that a third Israeli redeployment, required under the Oslo agreement, 
will take place and be of a certain percentage. The issue will be 
handled by the border commission of the final-status talks, but the 
Palestinians want American guarantees of the outcome, officials say. 
A senior American official said that the work between the two sides 
had turned serious in the last 12 to 15 hours, especially after Clinton 
and his team had a two-hour meeting with Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu 
of Israel and Palestinian leader Yasser Arafat before dinner Monday 
night, and then afterwards. ``But I've seen this before, and I've 
seen this phase not lead to an agreement,'' the official said. ``It's 
better than before, but by no means enough to close.'' Another American 
official said that the Palestinian grenade attack on an Israeli bus 
stop in Beersheba, Israel, early Monday, wounding more than 60 people, 
``acted as a sort of shock therapy to get them moving.'' But the official 
noted a degree of luck: ``If 10 or 12 Israelis had been killed in 
the attack,'' he said, ``the Israelis would have had to pack up and 
leave these talks.'' The talks here have followed a familiar pattern, 
another official said. ``In the beginning, both sides came in with 
their demands and won't move and repeat them and repeat them and repeat 
them until everyone's sick of it, and then they begin to discuss bridging 
ideas.'' Hussein, who flew to his Maryland home on Monday after being 
discharged from the Mayo Clinic in Minnesota, was asked by the Americans 
to come here on Tuesday. ``We think the king will help bring home 
to the two delegations the necessity of making the tough choices that 
lead to peace,'' Rubin said. ``We think he could play a helpful and 
constructive role.'' In particular, Rubin said, the king ``will be 
available during the course of the day where we think he can make 
the most difference in encouraging the leaders and their delegations 
to focus on moving ahead, rather than focusing on longstanding complaints 
and concerns.'' Hussein has proven indispensable to peacemaking in 
the past, making a peace treaty with Israel in 1994 and helping the 
Americans to get the Israelis and Palestinians to agree to the Hebron 
accords of January 1997.
