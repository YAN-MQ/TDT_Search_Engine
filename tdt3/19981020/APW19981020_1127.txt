Switzerland's federal prosecutor on Tuesday ordered the confiscation 
of dlrs 114.4 million in accounts in Switzerland and Britain after 
a 2 1/2-year investigation into the brother of former Mexican President 
Carlos Salinas de Gortari. Raul Salinas is in prison in Mexico pending 
completion of trials in a political assassination and on a charge 
of illegal enrichment during his brother's 1988-1994 administration. 
Carla del Ponte said the investigation had concluded that funds in 
the accounts, of which Raul Salinas de Gortari is co-owner, came partly 
from protection payoffs from drug traffickers. The Swiss halted their 
own proceedings on charges of money laundering against Raul Salinas 
and three co-defendants, but said their findings ``inevitably suggest 
money laundering'' of drug profits. Del Ponte said Switzerland couldn't 
try Salinas because he is imprisoned in Mexico. Mexican proceedings 
against Salinas and others on money laundering charges made a Swiss 
criminal case unnecessary, she added. Most of the money seized _ dlrs 
89.9 million _ ordered confiscated is in Swiss bank accounts. But 
a further dlrs 24.5 million is in London, administered by a Swiss-based 
financial institution. Salinas' lawyers can appeal the decision, taken 
Monday, within ten days. That would send the case to Switzerland's 
supreme court, but Del Ponte said she was ``very confident'' it would 
uphold the seizure. At a Mexico City news conference, Raul Salinas' 
lawyer, Eduardo Luengo Creel, said he would appeal. In a letter written 
from his prison cell in central Mexico, Raul Salinas accused the Swiss 
prosecutors of illegally trying to grab his money. He said they relied 
on questionable witnesses, exaggerated the size of his accounts and 
falsely accused him of taking bribes from drug smugglers. Salinas 
has denied any links to drug traffickers and said the money was an 
investment fund pooled by several wealthy friends. In his letter, 
Salinas said the ``sole purpose of the Swiss authorities is to illegally 
take control of the money.'' Despite Raul Salinas' claims of innocence, 
Del Ponte said ``the business dealings he claims are beyond all economic 
logic.'' Valentin Roschacher, the chief of Switzerland's antinarcotics 
police, said investigators concluded that Colombia's Medellin and 
Cali drug cartels as well as Mexican traffickers paid Raul Salinas 
at least dlrs 500 million over 10 years to protect drug shipments 
through Mexico. Witnesses spoke of ``green light days'' on which, 
after agreement between drug traffickers and corrupt officials, drugs 
destined for the United States could be transported through Mexico 
on certain routes. ``With all his contacts and his power, he could 
guarantee protection for those loads,'' Roschacher added. Salinas' 
contacts with drug traffickers started in the 1980s and became more 
intense under his brother's presidency in the early 1990s, he continued. 
Seven countries including Mexico and the United States collaborated 
with the Swiss inquiry. Six U.S. Drug Enforcement Administration analysts 
helped with the investigation in Bern at various points, Roschacher 
said. The investigators interviewed 78 witnesses, 31 of them bank 
employees, and 16 of them had to testify anonymously for their own 
safety, Roschacher said. Raul Salinas himself was questioned four 
times. A number of witnesses have been killed in Mexico in the course 
of the investigation, he added. Swiss authorities did not release 
the full 230-page police report on Salinas. Authorities seized his 
Swiss bank accounts in 1995. Some dlrs 7.8 million have since been 
unblocked as the money was proved unlinked to drugs or protection 
payments, Del Ponte said. Salinas is in prison pending completion 
of his trials on charges of masterminding the 1994 murder of political 
rival Jose Francisco Ruiz Masseiu, and of illicit enrichment while 
he held a midlevel government post in his brother's administration. 
No drug-related charges have been brought against Salinas and he was 
acquitted of money laundering on a technicality.
