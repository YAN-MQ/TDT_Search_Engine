Lewis gets a lot of loot. I'm Anthony Keith James, and this is "Headline 
Sports." First up, baseball -- and game three of the fall classic 
between the yankees and padres. David cone will make his fourth career 
world series start. He's 2-0 with a 2.89 E.R.A. this postseason. San 
Diego, down two games to none in the best of seven, is hoping lefty 
sterling hitchcock can stop New York and put the padres back on the 
winning track. I'm just going to have to, you know, stay within myself 
out there, get the ball over the plate and go after people.
