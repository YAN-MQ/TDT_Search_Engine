Finally, hard work, good friends and a drink. The way they live. Last 
night we saw how well the people of crete in Greece were living. Tonight, 
we go to a small village on the Japanese island of oshima. It is not 
a place where they think of retiring at 65. ABC's Mark Litke has been 
checking it out. Sheltered by the calm waters of Japan's inland sea, 
time has been kind to oshima island, and to the village of towa. People 
here celebrate the changing of the seasons well into their 70s, 80s 
and beyond. With half the population above the age of 65, this is 
the oldest and, arguably, the healthiest community in all of Japan. 
So what is the secret of this island, this village? The climate? The 
food? The lifestyle? Actually, people here say it's no secret at all. 
At 75, chuichi yamamoto still works almost every day of the year as 
a Commercial fisherman. And his wife, a youthful 71, still prepares 
every meal -- fish, fresh vegetables, steamed rice, just the way they've 
always eaten. Chuichi yamamoto still drinks a half bottle a day of 
sake, Japan's traditional rice wine. They are perfect examples of 
what the Japanese call genki, meaning "happy and healthy." High in 
fiber and calcium and the fact they stay active. Health professionals 
couldn't agree more. Many elderly in towa still work in the fields, 
like the haras, aged 90 and 88. Or there's 80-year-old tsurue inokawa, 
who does volunteer work making box lunches for those who can't care 
for themselves. Yes, people here eventually do become too old or too 
weak. Yet, the aging process clearly slows down on this island with 
so little stress. Those who've moved here from other places have even 
seen their medical bills drop by an average of 15%. But there's still 
something more -- at the Buddhist temple in towa, the head monk says 
there's a powerful sense of community and belonging here, a Quality 
that eases the fear of growing old and adds to everyone's well-being. 
People here lead simple, contented lives. This is truly a unique and 
special place. But not so unique, he adds, that it can't be duplicated 
elsewhere. Mark Litke, ABC News, oshima island.
