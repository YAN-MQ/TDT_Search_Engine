Foreign ministers of eight Arab countries are expected to meet next 
month to discuss closer military cooperation in the wake of a recent 
standoff between Syria and Turkey, news reports and diplomats said 
Tuesday. The Nov. 11-12 meeting in Qatar will discuss the eight countries' 
game plan should Turkey carry out its threats to use military force 
against Syria in their row over Turkish Kurd rebels, the diplomats 
said, speaking on condition of anonymity. The countries participating 
in the conference are Egypt, Syria and the six Arab Gulf nations: 
Saudi Arabia, United Arab Emirates, Qatar, Bahrain, Oman and Kuwait. 
The eight countries are part of a political alliance called the Damascus 
Declaration, which for long has unsuccessfully tried to forge a regional 
military cooperation pact. Al-Khalij, the main newspaper in the United 
Arab Emirates, said the ministers will review ``a new formula for 
security cooperation.'' It said this has become necessary due to ``the 
threats which the Arab region faces on the security level.'' Arab 
diplomats in Cairo said members of the alliance are worried that Turkey 
might actually use the military option against Syria if the current 
diplomatic efforts fail to resolve the crisis. Turkey accuses Syria 
of harboring Kurdish rebels fighting for autonomy from Turkey, and 
wants them expelled. Syria denies hosting the rebels or supporting 
them. On Monday, Turkey warned that talks now taking place between 
Turkish and Syrian officials were Syria's last chance for a peaceful 
solution. The two countries also are at odds over how to share water 
from the Euphrates river and Turkey's growing ties with Israel. The 
eight-country Arab alliance was born out of their common opposition 
to Iraq in the 1991 Gulf War following its occupation of Kuwait. It 
has tried to gain an economic impetus by discussing Egypt's long-cherished 
dream of setting up a common Arab market. The economic goals will 
again be discussed during the Qatar meeting, said the diplomats.
