President Clinton is offering federal assistance to victims of floods 
and tornadoes in Texas, the storms are blamed on 14 deaths, and as 
Bob Cain reports, the worst may not be over yet. The rains have been 
relentless, more than a foot dumped on San antonio just over the weekend. 
And they have been devastating. We have 5,200 people sheltered. We 
continue to operate in a 911 operation as we speak. Monday, the national 
guard planned to send a helicopter up to help search for a missing 
11-year-old girl and a 7-year-old boy in a Vehicle swept away by floodwaters, 
but the weather grounded the helicopter. The flood watch covers an 
area roughly stretching from Houston to San antonio to Austin, authorities 
say they expect thousands of head of livestock to die in the waters. 
The river came up so fast nobody had a chance to get them out in time. 
The safe places where they had been putting them weren't safe this 
time. Governor George bush says damage assessment is under way and 
washington has promised quick response. Nature is amazing. Just a 
few weeks ago we were praying for rain. There were some happy endings. 
A cow stranded on a rooftop and a horse stranded on a tiny patch of 
spongey high ground were both rescued. Bob Cain, CNN, "Headline News."
