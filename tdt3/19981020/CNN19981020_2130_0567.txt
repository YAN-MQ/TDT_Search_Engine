Former White House press secretary Mike McCurry might not want to 
hit up President Clinton for a job recommendation. In a speech at 
the University of Pittsburgh, McCurry jumped in the air and shouted, 
"free at last" when he was asked how he felt about quitting. McCurry 
described Mr. Clinton as an enormously gifted and richly qualified 
leader, who is exasperatingly stupid in his personal life. When asked 
about McCurry's remarks, the current press secretary accentuated the 
positive. If you look at the whole remarks, he paid a pretty extraordinary 
tribute to the president and his ability as a -- both a domestic, 
I think he called him an exceptionally gifted domestic leader and 
foreign leader, you know, as a world leader with the respect he gets 
around the world. As to the subject of personal behavior, the president 
-- there's no one who can be tougher on the president than the president 
himself. McCurry also admits he was duped by the president's initial 
public claim that he did not have an affair with Monica Lewinsky.
