Cuba has sent spies to the United States. That's the word from Cuban 
President Fidel Castro in an interview with CNN. Mr. Castro claims 
the United States allows its residents to carry out terrorist acts 
against Cuba, therefore Cuba has the right to have spies on U.S. soil. 
He says the spies are only trying to gather information on activities 
by anti-Castro exiles, not on the U.S. military. We are not interested 
in any type of strategic information about the United States. We aren't 
interested in strategic matters, nor are we interested in information 
about military bases. We're not interested at all, because these are 
matters in which we have no power or decision. For what do we need 
to know where the United States situates its missiles? Ten suspected 
Cuban spies were arrested recently for allegedly trying to penetrate 
U.S. military bases and anti-Castro exile groups. Three have pleaded 
guilty to being agents of a foreign government without notifying the 
U.S. attorney general.
