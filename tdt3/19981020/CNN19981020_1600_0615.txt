Florida is getting federal relief from the legal and economic burdens 
of mass migrations. Pat Neal has details. Flashback to 1994 -- thousands 
of haitians and Cubans sail for south Florida, and a full-scale migration 
crisis erupts. With memories of 1980, where more than 125,000 Cubans 
sailed to Florida, including criminals and psychiatric patients, Florida's 
governor declared a State of emergency and asked where is the federal 
government? He has an answer now, with this landmark agreement. The 
federal government has stepped up and will assume full responsibility. 
The first line of defense continues to be stopping migrants at sea 
and repatriating them. This became policy during the 1994 crisis after 
thousands of rafters made it to Florida's shores. Then, state law 
enforcement officers did not have the legal authority to apprehend 
migrants. They now do. Even more, the immigration and naturalization 
service plans a quicker response. The federal government will deploy 
assets for apprehending migrants as soon as they arrive on shore. 
In 1994, many migrants were released to Florida streets without thorough 
medical or criminal background checks. Now, collection points and 
screening procedures have been established. Before, the huge financial 
Burden of the crisis fell on the state. Now, recognizing immigration 
is a national responsibility, the U.S. government will pay the Bill. 
Just last month, more than 400 haitians tried to come to south Florida 
after a devastating hurricane made economic conditions throughout 
the caribbean even worse. Florida fears more may try to flee, and 
wants to make sure mistakes from the past don't happen again. Pat 
Neal, CNN, Miami.
