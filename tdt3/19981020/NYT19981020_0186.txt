Wynn's Cabernet Sauvignon 1995, Coonawarra, Australia. About $14. 
Winemakers from South Australia like to send out samples of the red 
soil from the Coonawarra region to help explain the character of their 
red wines. They are redolent of plums, are both soft and intensely 
rich and, at their best, have a pleasingly long aftertaste. The South 
Australians have described their 1995 vintage as ``challenging,'' 
but not to worry; Coonawarra is probably that continent's best source 
of cabernet and this particular example is a good wine at a good price. 
No one will ever mistake an Australian cabernet for a wine from America 
or Europe, for which we should be grateful. The homogenization of 
wine styles around the world proceeds apace and is depressing to contemplate. 
The Australian style is proudly different, just like the people, and 
worth getting to know.
