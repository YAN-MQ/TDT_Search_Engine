For the first time, Cuban leader Fidel Castro has admitted sending 
agents to the U.S. to spy on opposition groups. The admission in a 
CNN interview comes only weeks after ten alleged Cuban spies were 
arrested in Florida. Liz Rawsall in Miami has the details. Mr. Castro 
acknowledged that Cuban citizens were sometimes sent to the U.S. He 
admitted that the aim was to spy on groups opposed to his rule and 
to collect information about any plans for terrorist activities. The 
Cuban president said such action was justified given that Washington, 
as he put it, had spies in industrial quantities. However, Mr. Castro 
said he believed that the U.S. was not planning any acts of aggression 
against Cuba. And for that reason, his government was not interested 
in gathering military or strategic secrets. Liz Rawsall, BBC News, 
Miami.
