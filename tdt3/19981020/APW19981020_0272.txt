Facing sharp declines in government orders, Russian defense enterprises 
suggested Tuesday that they produce equipment for the oil and gas 
industry, a news report said. During a conference of leaders from 
the defense and energy industries in Votkinsk, 1000 kilometers (625 
miles) southeast of Moscow, senior defense executives released a document 
calling for the government to provide funds in 2000-2006 for the conversion, 
the ITAR-Tass news agency said. The defense officials said they could 
produce oil and gas equipment that would be competitive with foreign-made 
machinery. Leaders at the conference also urged the government to 
scale back imports of foreign-made oil and gas equipment. They said 
foreign companies should invest more in Russia and start more joint 
ventures with Russian firms instead.
