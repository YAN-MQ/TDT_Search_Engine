A Star Trek-type implant that enables direct communication between 
the brain and a computer is allowing a paralyzed, mute stroke victim 
to use his brainpower to move a cursor across a screen and convey 
simple messages such as hello and goodbye. Researchers believe the 
tiny implant the size of the tip of a ballpoint pen is the first device 
that allows direct communication between the brain and a computer. 
``Of all things people lose, the ability to communicate is the most 
frightening thing _ to know what you want to say and not to be able 
to say it,'' said Dr. Warren Selman, a neurosurgeon at University 
Hospitals of Cleveland not involved in the research. ``This is the 
first step to unlocking that.'' Doctors implanted a device into the 
53-year-old man's brain that amplifies his brain signals. Those signals 
are then transmitted to a laptop computer through an antenna-like 
coil placed on his head. Like a computer mouse, the brain signals 
can move a cursor across the computer screen and point at icons with 
messages such as ``See you later. Nice talking with you.'' The man 
can also use the cursor to tell others that he is hungry or thirsty. 
``It's like we're making the mouse the patient's brain,'' said Dr. 
Roy Bakay, one of two Emory University doctors who developed the technology. 
Eventually, researchers hope to use the technology to teach patients 
to write letters, send e-mail and turn lights off and on via computer. 
``It opens up a very exciting new chapter in rehabilitation for such 
patients,'' said Dr. William Friedman, program director and associate 
chairman of neurosurgery at the University of Florida. The patient, 
identified only as J.R., suffered a brain stem stroke and is dependent 
on a ventilator at the Atlanta Veterans Affairs Medical Center. His 
brain functions normally, but its signals do not reach their intended 
destination. Six months ago, Bakay and Dr. Phillip Kennedy implanted 
a tiny glass cone into the man's brain. A substance that encourages 
nerves to grow prompted the brain's nerves to link up to electrodes 
in the cone, forming what Bakay calls ``a little brain'' inside the 
cone. The electrodes can transmit electrical impulses produced by 
the brain to a computer. To train J.R.'s brain, researchers told him 
to think about grabbing a glass. The cone is implanted in an area 
of the brain that can produce signals designed to cause movement. 
Bakay and Kennedy have been testing the technology on animals for 
12 years. Kennedy has patented the technology. The first human patient, 
a woman suffering from Lou Gehrig's disease, was able to control computer 
signals for 76 days before she died. J.R. is their second patient. 
The National Institutes of Health have awarded funding to continue 
research on at least one more patient. For more than a decade, some 
paralyzed people have communicated with a computer program that translates 
their coded blinking into letters on a screen. J.R. can blink, but 
``I think he enjoys doing this,'' Bakay said. Selman expressed caution 
about using the technology on anybody except patients with long-term 
paralysis. ``You'd hate to put something in somebody in an area they're 
going to recover,'' he said.
