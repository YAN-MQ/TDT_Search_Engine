Typhoon Babs gathered strength Tuesday as it pushed toward the southern 
tip of Luzon Island and the central Philippines, threatening to hit 
some of the poorest regions in the country. At 5 p.m. (0900 GMT), 
Babs, with maximum sustained winds of 160 kilometers (100 miles) per 
hour and gusts of up to 195 kph (122 mph), was over the Pacific Ocean 
about 230 kilometers (144 miles) east-southeast of Borongan in Eastern 
Samar province, weather forecaster Susan Dampog said. She said Babs, 
the ninth storm to hit the country this season, was moving northwest 
at 11 kph (7 mph) but its movement was too erratic to determine exactly 
when it would hit land. ``It's difficult to determine where it will 
proceed,'' she said. ``But we are sure it will continue to gain more 
strength before it hits land.'' Dampog said the typhoon will begin 
to be felt in Samar and Luzon's southern Bicol region by late Tuesday 
or early Wednesday. Defense Secretary Orlando Mercado said military 
rescue units, including air force helicopters and navy vessels, are 
on standby. ``They know what to do but we are praying that we will 
not have a direct hit,'' he said. Dampog said the bureau is advising 
against sea travel because the typhoon is likely to create large waves. 
Residents of the eastern coastline also have been told to move to 
higher ground because the typhoon is expected to create ``surges'' 
that could engulf coastal villages, she said. Another typhoon, Zeb, 
struck the northern Philippines last week, leaving at least 74 people 
dead and 65 others missing. About 415,000 people fled their homes 
at the height of the typhoon but most have now returned. After hitting 
the Philippines, Zeb skirted Taiwan, where 31 died, before cutting 
a swath across Japan, where it killed at least 12 people.
