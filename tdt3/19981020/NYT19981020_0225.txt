Q. My chiffon and sponge cakes occasionally fall while still in the 
oven, even if I do not open the door. Why? Q. I recently made a meringue 
frosting for a layer cake. A day later, the frosting began shrinking. 
By the third day I was down to a bare cake. What happened? A. Although 
these two questions may seem to have little in common, in each case, 
the problem was that the beaten egg whites broke down. When this happens, 
the air trapped in the mixture is released, causing it to shrink or 
fall. As egg whites are beaten, their proteins, which start out as 
tight, irregular coils, begin to unfurl and bond with each other. 
Ideally, they link together, forming a loose, flexible network. The 
air that is incorporated into the whites through beating gets trapped 
by this network and creates that fluffy, white mound. This cloud is 
relatively unstable, and there are several reasons it might deflate. 
The most likely is overbeating. When egg whites are overbeaten, the 
protein network becomes rigid (because the loose bonds between the 
proteins strengthen). In the meringue frosting, the proteins squeezed 
the liquid from the foam, bursting the air bubbles and releasing the 
trapped gas. Hence, the icing shrank. (Even a perfect meringue frosting 
will eventually break down, but overbeating hastens the process.) 
A chiffon cake relies on beaten egg whites for leavening. When it 
is baked, the gas trapped by the whites expands, which causes the 
cake to rise. Overbeaten egg whites, with their firm protein network, 
cannot stretch when the gas expands. So the cake either will not rise 
at all or will rise only until the brittle protein network bursts. 
Unfortunately, it is easy to overbeat egg whites. The idea is to catch 
them when they reach their maximum volume, but before they dry out. 
To make perfectly beaten egg whites, begin beating with an electric 
mixer set on low. As the whites thicken, increase the speed, and gradually 
add any sugar. If the recipe calls for cream of tartar, add it now. 
(Rose Levy Beranbaum, the author of ``The Cake Bible,'' advises adding 
[ teaspoon cream of tartar per egg white to prevent overbeating.) 
The whites are ready when they form shiny peaks as the beaters are 
lifted. If you tilt the bowl, they should slip slightly. If they cling 
to the bowl, look coarse and clump together, you've overdone it. Then, 
just start over.
