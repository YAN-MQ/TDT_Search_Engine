There are 91 reasons to support 91 FM. Here's a good one. Hi, my name 
is Faiza. I live in Wayne. 91 FM is programmed as the number one button 
in my car radio, and I don't even know why I bother to program it 
because it's the only thing I ever listen to in my car. I get "Morning 
Edition," "All Things Considered," Terry Groves, Tony Kahn, "The World." 
"The World," I get "The World" with WHYY is what I get. And I enjoy 
being a member. Well, if you're that excited about 91 FM and THE WORLD, 
why don't you pick up the phone and become a member of this terrific 
public radio service? The number to call is 215-923-1234. Call collect 
if it's long distance. 215-923-1234. Programs like "The World" and 
"All Things Considered" and "Talk of the Nation" exist here on the 
station because people like you become members of WHYY. And give their 
financial support. The number again is 215-923-1234.
