British Foreign Secretary Robin Cook on Monday urged Bulgarian officials 
to clarify circumstances of the sensational 1978 umbrella murder of 
dissident Georgi Markov. Cook, on a working visit to Sofia, discussed 
the matter with President Petar Stoyanov. After the meeting Stoyanov 
told journalists he had assured Cook that this is a painful issue 
for all democrats in Bulgaria. ``We don't want you to assume that 
the current government does not want to assist the investigation, 
but communism is gone, taking along some of its secrets. Part of them 
are those linked with Georgi Markov's murder,'' Stoyanov told the 
British Foreign Secretary. Markov, a writer and journalist who left 
communist Bulgaria in the early 1970s, worked for the Bulgarian language 
service of the British Broadcasting Corp. Investigators said he was 
jabbed with the poisoned tip of an umbrella. The Markov case has never 
been solved, but British investigators long have suspected Bulgarian 
agents. Former KGB agent Oleg Kalugin has said that Bulgaria asked 
Moscow for help in the assassination. Bulgaria was the most loyal 
Soviet ally under decades of communist rule. Post-communist leaders 
have vowed to clear the Markov case in an effort to clean up Bulgaria's 
image.
