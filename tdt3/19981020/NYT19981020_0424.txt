The pace of transactions involving agencies specializing in advertising, 
public relations and other marketing communications services has accelerated 
again, this time with the announcement of five acquisitions. Financial 
terms of the deals were not disclosed. The frenzy reflects how the 
dynamics of traditional advertising and marketing keep changing as 
independent shops are rapidly snapped up by larger agencies. One deal 
involved the communications and marketing division of the MDC Communications 
Corp. in Toronto, which further expanded its presence in the United 
States by acquiring a majority interest in Source Marketing, a strategic 
promotion agency in Westport, Conn. Source, founded in 1989, has 24 
employees and billings estimated at $7 million from clients including 
the Campbell Soup Co., the Eastman Kodak Co., Home Box Office and 
Reckitt &AMP; Colman. Howard Steinberg, 40, president, will continue 
to head Source, owning a minority stake in the agency. ``We had been 
approached by a number of organizations looking to acquire us over 
the years,'' Steinberg said. ``However, we agreed to partner with 
MDC because of their philosophy of independence and autonomy and their 
ability to bring additional resources to enhance the growth prospects 
for our business going forward.'' The Source deal is the third this 
year in the United States for MDC, which owns three agencies in Canada 
including a sales promotion shop, Accumark Promotions in North York, 
Ontario. In August, MDC acquired a majority interest in Margeotes/Fertitta 
&AMP; Partners in New York and in May, the company bought 75 percent 
of Cyber Sight, an Internet marketing agency in Portland, Ore. ``Sales 
promotion is a $80 billion sector of marketing services that is growing 
11 percent per year,'' said Miles S. Nadel, president and chief executive 
of MDC. ``The acquisition of Source Marketing represents an important 
step for us to swiftly obtain a significant presence in this market 
in the United States.'' MDC also said it had signed letters of intent 
to buy another American advertising agency, a public relations agency 
and a corporate design company, but did not identify them. The second 
deal involved the acquisition of a Canadian agency. Euro RSCG Worldwide 
in New York, part of Havas Advertising, bought Sharpe/Blackmore in 
Toronto, which has been renamed Sharpe/Blackmore Euro RSCG. The agency, 
which was founded in 1996, has 25 employees and billings estimated 
at more than $20 million from clients including Absolut vodka, Dell 
Computer, RJR Nabisco and Xerox. Bill Sharpe, 44, chairman and chief 
executive, and Tom Blackmore, 49, president, will head Sharpe/Blackmore 
Euro RSCG in those posts. The third deal also involved a unit of Euro 
RSCG. Healthview Euro RSCG, a division of Euro RSCG Healthcare Worldwide, 
acquired Nethod LLC, a strategic online communications agency in New 
York. Nethod has 10 employees and projected revenue of $3 million 
from clients like the American Cyanamid division of American Home 
Products, the Perkin-Elmer Corp. and Rhone-Poulenc Rorer. Gregg Trueman, 
42, president of Nethod, will continue to head the agency. ``Nethod 
will provide online program development and management of online communications 
services to all of Healthview's divisions,'' said Ron Pantello, chief 
executive of Healthview and Lally McFarland &AMP; Pantello Euro RSCG. 
The fourth deal involved Doremus &AMP; Co. in New York, the business-to-business 
agency owned by Omnicom Group, which acquired Colligan Group, a corporate 
advertising and direct marketing agency in New York. Colligan has 
five employees and billings estimated at $8 million to $10 million 
from clients like Dictaphone, First Union National Bank and the National 
Geographic Society. Richard Colligan, 47, president, continues to 
head Colligan and becomes an executive vice president of Doremus. 
Finally, Ogilvy Public Relations Worldwide in New York acquired Alexander 
Communications Inc., a technology public relations agency in San Francisco. 
Alexander will operate as Alexander Ogilvy Public Relations Worldwide. 
Pam Alexander, 44, president and chief executive at Alexander, continues 
to head the agency, reporting to Bob Seltzer, president and chief 
executive at Ogilvy Public Relations. Alexander has 158 employees 
at seven offices in cities including Atlanta, Boston, Dallas and Denver, 
handling accounts with billings estimated at $15 million from clients 
like Ascend Communications, Hewlett-Packard, Merrill Lynch &AMP; Co. 
and Qwest Communications. Ogilvy Public Relations, part of WPP Group 
PLC, has 550 employees in 31 offices worldwide, handling accounts 
with billings estimated at $55 million; clients including Glaxo Wellcome, 
IBM, Pfizer and Quaker Oats.
