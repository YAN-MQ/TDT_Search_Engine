If there is a commonly followed barometer of the wealth of universities, 
it is surely Harvard's endowment, which, thanks to generous donors 
and the long stock market boom of the 1990s, stood close to $13 billion 
at the end of June, more than the gross national product of most developing 
countries. No other college or university comes close. Still, from 
the University of Texas system (the second richest, with $7.6 billion) 
to Princeton to the University of California, other wealthy colleges 
and universities have seen their endowments soar. A dozen now have 
$3 billion or more, up from six just two years ago. Despite the recent 
market slump _ including losses taken on some hedge funds and other 
investments _ many of these institutions are beginning to loosen their 
purse strings and spend some of their newly acquired bounty. Tuition 
increases are being moderated. Financial aid packages are being sweetened. 
Faculty members are getting more money for research. Academic initiatives 
are bursting forth, frequently with new laboratories or classrooms. 
Harvard recently said it would give larger scholarships and reduce 
the size of its nonlecture classes. Yale is adding faculty slots for 
the first time in years. Washington University in St. Louis is creating 
a department of biomedical engineering. Rice University in Houston 
is adding majors in biophysics and bioengineering. The University 
of Chicago will spend about half a billion dollars on an athletic 
center, two dormitories and a center for the biological and physical 
sciences. Hugo F. Sonnenschein, president of the University of Chicago, 
sums it up succinctly: ``The world is much better for us now, as it 
is for colleges and universities everywhere.'' For universities like 
Stanford, the new era is particularly welcome. ``In the early 90s 
we had cost cutting,'' said John Ford, Stanford's vice president for 
development. ``Now we have come around that corner and are making 
strategic investments.'' Mindful of the public outcry over tuition 
costs, many private colleges and universities are using some of their 
extra revenue to moderate the growth in tuition _ which is still rising 
faster than inflation _ and to raise financial aid. But wholesale 
tuition cuts are unlikely. For one thing, relatively few colleges 
and universities have any significant endowment, and most have established 
policies that restrict them to spending only a small part of their 
wealth each year. ``You don't want to pay out so much that you beggar 
future generations, or so little that you beggar the current one,'' 
said Dean Currie, vice president for finance and administration at 
Rice, which saw its endowment grow 51 percent to $2.8 billion as of 
June, and is adding new buildings for the humanities and the biosciences. 
Typically, universities try to even out the impact of booms and busts. 
They usually spend no more than about 4 or 5 percent of their assets 
a year _ even if investment gains for the year equal 20 or 25 percent 
of their assets _ and they base their calculation of average assets 
over three, four or five years. This caution means that the market 
run-up of the last few years has translated into higher spending only 
very slowly, and in many places that spending is just becoming visible. 
``We tend to be very careful,'' said Rebecca S. Chopp, the provost 
at Emory University in Atlanta, which has seen its endowment increase 
to $5 billion in June from $3 billion two years ago. ``We want to 
be here for a long time.'' Most universities are embracing a number 
of priorities, including old themes, like financial aid and salaries, 
and some newer ones, like bioengineering departments and international 
studies. Mindful of the public outcry over tuition costs, many private 
colleges and universities are using some of their extra revenue to 
moderate the growth in tuition and to raise financial aid. Williams 
College, for example, which raised its tuition by 4.6 percent last 
year, held its increase to 3.5 percent this year _ its lowest increase 
in about 25 years. Like many other colleges, Williams also decided 
to allow students to keep all outside scholarships, rather than partly 
reducing its own scholarship aid for each dollar they bring in from 
the outside. ``What the extra money has done is enabled us to respond 
to some pressures,'' said Stuart Crampton, the college's provost. 
Building and maintenance, an area that colleges and universities often 
skimp on in tight years, is also getting new emphasis. Even universities 
like Columbia that are already in the middle of major building programs 
are beginning to dream about further building. ``The remarkable endowment 
returns of the past few years will allow us to continue projecting 
further investments in facilities,'' said George Rupp, Columbia's 
president. Columbia is expanding undergraduate housing, rehabilitating 
its library and building a new student center. Emory has found that 
the added dollars from the market are helping it move faster on its 
strategic plan. Besides creating new scholarships, it has put $1 million 
a year into improving teaching, and an additional $250,000 a year 
into sending faculty members and graduate students overseas and to 
bring foreign visitors to its campus. A few universities are liberalizing 
their spending formulas. Washington University, which saw its endowment 
increase 52 percent in the last two years, to $3.5 billion, is permitting 
the spending of an extra $7 million in its $850 million budget. The 
university is adding new buildings and has increased financial aid. 
``Perhaps we would have done the same things without this growth,'' 
said Mark S. Wrighton, Washington's chancellor, ``but not as quickly.'' 
Moreover, when financial crises shook Asia last year, the university 
was able to tell students it could help them if needed. About 600 
of its 10,000 students are from Asia. University officials caution 
that some of the changes may loom larger symbolically than in reality. 
At Yale, for example, the decision to add new faculty positions for 
the first time since 1992 seemed to represent a major policy shift. 
But Charles H. Long, the deputy provost, said the university made 
the decision because it saw a particular ``opportunity to make a difference'' 
by giving the political science department six new openings. ``There 
was a series of retirements over the last decade that had taken some 
of the luster off the department, and relative to student interest, 
it was very understaffed,'' Long said. Even with larger endowments, 
not all universities feel richer. At the Massachusetts Institute of 
Technology, the extra income from the higher endowment is helping 
to offset reductions in federal research money, said Glenn P. Strehle, 
the university's treasurer and vice president for finance. ``That's 
impacting everybody,'' he said, ``but it is impacting us more, since 
a larger portion of our budget comes from sponsored research.'' Strehle 
said MIT had to replace about $55 million a year in revenue. ``For 
us,'' he said, ``the question is not how flush we are, but how tight 
the belt is.''
