Here in Washington, lawyers for Microsoft portrayed the giant software 
company as an aggressive but legal business competitor that did not 
violate U.S. anti-trust laws. VOA's Rick Nunez reports. Microsoft's 
lead attorney, John Warden, wants to prove that evidence presented 
against his client by the Justice Department is dangerously out of 
context. Prosecutors are using company memos to contradict a videotaped 
deposition by Microsoft chairman Bill Gates. In his testimony, Mr. 
Gates denied using illegal business practices to try and force competitors 
to stop using Internet software and other programs made by rival companies 
such as Netscape. But the internal Microsoft documents presented by 
the Justice Department show company officials met with other firms 
allegedly to persuade them to drop plans to use Netscape's Internet 
browser program. In written testimony, Netscape chairman Jim Barksdale 
said it was clear to him that Microsoft was suggesting his company 
stop competing or be wiped out. A Microsoft spokesman says the government 
has misrepresented what occurred at the meetings. The anti-trust trial 
is expected to take between six and eight weeks. Rick Nunez, VOA News, 
Washington.
