Wounded badly by last month's pilots strike, Northwest Airlines reported 
a $224 million third-quarter loss yesterday. Also yesterday, Southwest 
Airlines, following the pattern of other booming carriers, announced 
record earnings for the period. Northwest, the nation's fourth-largest 
airline, said that it lost $2.91 a diluted share, compared with a 
profit of $290 million, or $2.53 a share, in the corresponding quarter 
last year. Revenue declined 31 percent, to $1.93 billion, from $2.8 
billion in period a year earlier. Northwest also said that negotiations 
with the antitrust division of the Justice Department over its plan 
to buy a controlling stake in Continental Airlines would be resolved 
in ``days rather than weeks.'' Douglas M. Steenland, Northwest's chief 
counsel, said he expected the government to file suit to block the 
deal and a proposed alliance between the two carriers if no agreement 
was reached soon, and he predicted that Northwest would win in court. 
``Because we believe this transaction is pro-competitive, we would 
anticipate that we would prevail,'' he added. The airline said its 
operations were recovering quickly from the strike, with traffic around 
normal levels. ``There has been some talk that the market might be 
softening, but we don't see that in our own bookings at the moment,'' 
said Michael E. Levine, an executive vice president in charge of marketing 
and international operations. Still, Northwest continues to suffer 
more than most United States carriers because of the strike and its 
substantial exposure in Asia, which accounts for nearly one-third 
of its revenue. The airline put the total cost of the walkout, which 
grounded operations for 18 days, at $630 million. It said it expected 
to post another loss in the fourth quarter and for the full year. 
Shares of Northwest fell $2.375 Tuesday, to $24.8125. Southwest, the 
largest discount airline, said its net income surged 40 percent in 
the quarter, to $129.6 million, or 37 cents a diluted share, compared 
with $92.5 million, or 27 cents a share a year earlier. Revenue increased 
10 percent, to $1.1 billion, from $997 million in 1997. Gary Kelly, 
Southwest's chief financial officer, said the key factors in the quarter 
were strong passenger demand and low fuel prices. Southwest's planes 
left the ground with an average of 70 percent of their seats filled, 
one of the highest levels ever. Fuel costs dropped nearly 19 percent 
from a year earlier. Kelly added that Southwest _ which is sought 
out each year by officials of hundreds of cities hoping to attract 
its low-cost flights _ planned to expand capacity 13 percent in 1999. 
Average seat growth for the industry is forecast at 5.5 percent, according 
to analysts. Kelly said Southwest would like to grow even faster if 
it could add more Boeing 737 jets to its fleet at attractive prices. 
Shares of Southwest Airlines fell 62.5 cents Tuesday to $20.25.
