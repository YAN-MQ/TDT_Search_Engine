A deal in which a group of Aborigines swapped their rights to claim 
a special form of land title for two kidney dialysis machines was 
criticized by doctors Tuesday as setting a dangerous precedent. The 
Australian Medical Association said the deal traded Aboriginal land 
rights for health services that should be provided by government anyway. 
In the first deal of its type in Australia, the Jawoyn Association, 
representing Aboriginal people in the Katherine area of the Northern 
Territory, said it will sign an agreement with the territory's government 
to end a native title claim to about 2,470 acres (1,000 hectares) 
of Outback. In exchange, the government will provide renal dialysis 
facilities in Katherine and land for an alcohol rehabilitation center. 
Jawoyn leader Robert Lee said the government should provide basic 
health services, but Aborigines could not afford to wait for the slow 
wheels of bureaucracy. ``We can't wait that long. A lot of people 
are dying,'' Lee told The Australian newspaper. Robyn Cahill, executive 
director of the territory branch of the Medical Association, said 
the rate of final stage kidney disease in the Northern Territory was 
the highest in the world and up to 50 times the Australian average. 
Most cases were in the Aboriginal community. Association figures show 
Australia's indigenous Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander people 
die of diabetes _ a major cause of kidney failure _ at a rate 12 to 
17 times greater than white Australians. But trading land rights for 
public health services set a dangerous precedent, said Cahill. ``What 
we have here is a government doing deals for provision of health care 
services that they are supposed to provide regardless,'' Cahill said. 
``After this, Aboriginal groups with land claims across the country 
will feel pressured into forgoing what they fundamentally believe 
they should have (land rights) to get another thing that they should 
have, namely appropriate health care.''
