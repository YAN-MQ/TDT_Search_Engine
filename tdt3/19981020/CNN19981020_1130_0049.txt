In a few hours, lawyers for Paula Jones will try to revive her sexual 
harassment lawsuit against President Clinton. They are asking a three-judge 
appeals court panel in Minneapolis to reinstate it. A federal judge 
in Little Rock, Arkansas, threw out the suit last April, saying that 
even if Jones could prove her allegations against the president, there 
was no evidence she was harmed. Jones claims Mr. Clinton propositioned 
her in a Little Rock hotel room in 1991 when she was a state employee. 
Talks aimed at settling the case have stalled.
