Greeted by a crowd of thousands that included his country's president 
and baseball Hall of Famer Juan Marichal, Sammy Sosa finally returned 
home Tuesday. ``I feel very happy and honored that my people are on 
their feet, waiting for me,'' said Sosa, in the Dominican Republic 
for the first time since his 66-homer season. ``To see that in the 
United States they applauded a Dominican makes me happy and proud 
to be Dominican.'' On a day of national celebration, President Leonel 
Fernandez was among the throng to cheer the Chicago Cubs slugger as 
he emerged from a private jet at Santo Domingo's international airport. 
``After suffering the effects of Hurricane Georges, we know what it 
felt like for the teams facing Sammy Sosa to feel the force of Hurricane 
Sosa,'' Fernandez said. Also in the receiving line on a rainy day 
was Marichal, the great San Francisco Giants pitcher who is now the 
Dominican sports minister. Before Sosa arrived, cars with windshields 
painted ``Welcome Sammy'' and ``Go Sammy!'' jammed the two-lane highway 
from the capital to the airport. Thousands more fans took free bus 
rides to welcome Sosa, who has become an idol like none this Caribbean 
nation has known. ``He scrapes, he gives his all, it's the Dominican 
style!'' gushed Maximo Sosa, a fan who is no relation to Sammy. Since 
the season ended, Sosa received the keys to New York City, threw a 
ceremonial first pitch in the World Series and raised money for hurricane 
victims. In his homeland, he had a winter league season named for 
him and will receive the nation's top medal. After his stopover in 
Santo Domingo, Sosa headed for San Pedro de Macoris, his hometown 
40 miles (64 kilometers) east of the capital, where a victory procession 
and merengue party awaited. In San Pedro, the seaside boulevard was 
lined with palm trees before Georges smashed them Sept. 22. Thousands 
lost their homes, and many are still waiting for electricity and water. 
Nationwide, the storm killed at least 283 people and left 100,000 
homeless. Sosa's final home runs became Dominicans' only cause for 
celebration after the storm, even though Mark McGwire took the crown 
with 70 homers. San Pedro provincial Mayor Sergio Cedeno said Tuesday 
that Sosa sent home three planeloads of food and medical supplies. 
``For being a humble person who has reached the hearts of many people 
... he's the best ambassador we could have to show the disaster that 
has stricken us,'' Cedeno said. The government also has diplomatic 
plans for Sosa. Fernandez planned to name him a ``Roving Ambassador 
to the Glory of Sport'' when he presents him with the nation's highest 
honor, the Grand Cross of the Order of Duarte, Sanchez and Mella, 
at a National Palace ceremony Friday. But Sosa's most precious gift 
to Dominicans was one that couldn't be quantified. ``Sammy is not 
someone for what he gives anyway,'' said motorcycle taxi driver Luis 
Alex, who wears black batting gloves on both hands, just as Sosa does. 
``He's someone we hold here inside,'' Alex signaled to his heart, 
``for what he gives as pride.''
