After bemoaning the closed-door, last-minute haste that produced the 
federal budget, the House on Tuesday night overwhelmingly approved 
the $500-billion catch-all spending package, an unwieldy, 40-pound 
document that ran nearly 4,000 pages and that virtually no one had 
time to read before the vote. With the entire House up for re-election 
in just two weeks and most lawmakers anxious to get home to campaign, 
the House voted 333-95 to accept the colossal package, copies of which 
arrived on the House floor for review by members less than four hours 
before Tuesday night's vote. Republican leaders had to rely on Democrats 
to help pass the bill. In the end, 170 Democrats joined 162 Republicans 
and one independent to support it, while 64 Republicans and 31 Democrats 
voted against it. The biggest defection came from conservatives, who 
complained that the bill raided this year's anticipated budget surplus, 
provided no serious tax cut and expanded spending for social programs. 
They blamed President Clinton and liberals, but they held House Speaker 
Newt Gingrich accountable for what they said was his selling out his 
revolutionary fervor of 1994. Just before the vote, Gingrich roared 
back, presenting himself on the House floor as a statesman and a consensus-builder. 
He denounced the conservative firebrands, his former allies for whom 
he was once their spokesman, as ``perfectionists'' who did not understand 
the art of compromise and who had become ``petty dictators'' in their 
own little worlds. ``Surely those of us who have grown up and matured 
in this process understand after the last four years we have to work 
together on big issues,'' he declared. ``If we don't work together 
on big issues, nothing gets done.'' He said of the final cost of the 
package: ``Yes our liberal friends get a few things, and in a free 
society when you are sharing power between the legislative and executive 
branch, that is precisely the outcome you should expect to get.'' 
The omnibus bill, which allocates money for hundreds of programs large 
and small and incorporates numerous policy decisions that Congress 
never debated, now goes to the Senate. Along with many House members, 
several senators expressed outrage on Tuesday at the final price tag 
and the 11th-hour wheeling and dealing among congressional leaders 
and the White House that brought the spending package to fruition. 
But the Senate is expected to it on Wednesday anyway, bringing down 
the curtain on the 105th Congress. The package accounts for about 
one-third of the $1.7-trillion budget. After a generation of deficits, 
it includes a surplus, but many members were infuriated that it spends 
about $20 billion of the anticipated $70 billion surplus for ``emergency'' 
tasks, from immunizing the government's computers to the 2000 bug 
to helping farmers trying to cope with the loss of Asian export markets. 
Anger at the Republican leaders for spending so much and for turning 
the budget into a free-form bazaar dominated by special-interest pleadings 
came from across the political spectrum. Rep. Bob Livingston, R-La., 
who is chairman of the Appropriations Committee, called the process 
``ugly'' and said, ``I hated it.'' On the other side of the Capitol, 
Sen. Robert Byrd of West Virginia, the ranking Democrat on the Appropriations 
Committee who is famous for the huge amount of pork-barrel spending 
he directs to his home state, complained: ``This is a creation without 
a mother or father. It's more like a Frankenstein monster patched 
together from old legislative body parts that don't quite fit.'' But 
those grievances, once aired, seemed to melt in the face of more money 
for most congressional districts and a widespread desire to get the 
whole thing over with and with Gingrich's impassioned plea for support.
