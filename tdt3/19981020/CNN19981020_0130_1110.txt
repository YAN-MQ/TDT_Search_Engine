Disney will share the stage with the United Nations. They're working 
together to build a U.N. pavilion at Walt Disney world's epcot center 
in Florida. U.N. secretary-general Kofi Annan made the announcement 
on a visit to epcot. The pavilion will include exhibits from as many 
as 50 countries and will be part of the new millennium village scheduled 
to open next year.
