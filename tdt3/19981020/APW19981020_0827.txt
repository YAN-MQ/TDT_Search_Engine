Government troops clashed Tuesday with rebels in Guinea-Bissau, raising 
the prospect of a return to civil war in the west African nation, 
Portuguese officials said. The fighting in the interior of the country 
prompted the International Committee of the Red Cross to suspend relief 
operations in the capital Bissau, on the coast, and the second-largest 
city Bafata, 100 kilometers (60 miles) east of Bissau, ICRC spokesman 
Michael Kleiner said. Rebels and troops backing President Joao Bernardo 
Vieira exchanged mortar fire in Bafata and nearby Bambadinca, a spokesman 
for the Portuguese Defense Ministry said. Clashes were also reported 
in Quebu, near the former Portuguese colony's southern border with 
Guinea, which has an airfield. ``Our concern is that the fighting 
is spreading to the interior,'' Defense Ministry spokesman Vasco Colares 
Pereira told The Associated Press in Lisbon, adding that the extent 
of the clashes was unclear. Meanwhile, fighting in the capital subsided. 
An official at the Portuguese embassy in Bissau, who declined to be 
identified, said there was sporadic fire during the night, but everything 
was calm by morning. Neighboring Senegal and Guinea deployed troops 
to help Vieira contain the rebels, but it was not clear whether they 
were involved in the renewed fighting. On Tuesday, hundreds of residents 
gathered at Bissau's port, looking to leave the battered capital for 
the Bissagos islands, some 50 kilometers (30 miles) off its western 
coast, Kleiner said by phone from Geneva, where the ICRC is based. 
Others chose southwestern and eastern land routes, adding to some 
300,000 already displaced by the conflict that began in early June, 
he said. He said he had no reliable information on the total number 
of refugees. Hostilities restarted Sunday in the capital as army dissidents 
led by Brig. Ansumane Mane and government soldiers clashed near the 
presidential palace, breaking a 13-week truce. The Community of Portuguese-speaking 
Countries, or CPLP, which brokered the July 26 cease-fire, on Tuesday 
called on both sides to restrain their forces, the Portuguese news 
agency Lusa reported. The CPLP also asked their negotiating partner 
_ the Economic Community of West African Countries _ to ``urgently 
resume a joint mediation effort,'' Lusa reported. Fighting erupted 
June 7 in this country of 1 million, when a rebel military faction 
seized Bissau's main army garrison and airport, demanding that Vieira 
step down for alleged corruption.
