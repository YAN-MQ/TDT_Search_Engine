Ukraine plans to burn radioactive trees from around the Chernobyl 
nuclear plant to produce electricity and heat, an official said Tuesday. 
The contaminated trees will be reduced to charcoal, which will be 
easier to dispose of than other radioactive waste, said First Deputy 
Emergency Situations Minister Volodymyr Kholosha. Chernobyl's reactor 
No. 4 exploded and caught fire in April 1986 in the world's worst 
nuclear accident. The plant's immediate surroundings were heavily 
contaminated. Residents were evacuated from a 30-kilometer (19-mile) 
``dead zone'' around the plant. Only Chernobyl workers are allowed 
in on a rotating basis. Kholosha said only a few tree-burning factories 
will be built at first while officials study whether the project is 
economically sound, the Interfax news agency reported. One of the 
stumbling blocks to closing the Chernobyl power plant is Ukraine's 
insistence on foreign aid to come up with replacement sources of electricity.
