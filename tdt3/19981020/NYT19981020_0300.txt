The playwright's fading family photographs hang virtually unnoticed 
on the walls of the set. In one frame, a black World War II soldier 
grins beneath a rakishly tilted cap. In another, a shy young woman 
glimmers in a gown that sweeps her toes. They are his parents, long 
buried, their era long gone. But when the stage lights dim, their 
lost world springs to life. Suddenly, it is 1943 in Harlem, with Ella 
Fitzgerald crooning, newly arrived Southerners gawking and housekeepers 
calling to Jesus in storefront churches and lindy-hopping until dawn 
at the Savoy Ballroom. The playwright John Henry Redwood recreates 
those heady days in ``The Old Settler,'' a bittersweet comedy in previews 
Off Broadway at Primary Stages, where it opens on Wednesday. It is 
the story of Elizabeth Borny, a lonely, middle-aged domestic who rents 
a room in her apartment to a naive young Southerner and falls in love 
with him, despite the disapproval of her sister, Quilly, who knows 
better. In bringing this slice of black America to a New York stage, 
Redwood has woven a tale from the lives of his relatives who migrated 
from North Carolina to New York, scrubbed floors on Long Island and 
partied in Harlem during the 1940s. The play, directed by Harold Scott 
and starring the actress and singer Leslie Uggams as Elizabeth, has 
won praise in different productions at regional theaters. The sisters, 
Elizabeth and Quilly (portrayed by Lynda Gravatt), are loosely modeled 
on Redwood's mother and aunt, who bickered and quarreled in foot-stomping 
battles and loved each other fiercely until they died. As a boy growing 
up in Brooklyn, Redwood absorbed their stories, their love of collard 
greens and Big Band sounds, and their reverence for a time when young 
men tipped their hats to young women, and when saying ``shoot'' was 
the closest one came to swearing in polite company. Redwood eventually 
left home to satisfy a variety of curiosities. Entranced by John Wayne's 
performance in the movie ``Sands of Iwo Jima,'' he joined the Marines 
for three years. He earned master's degrees in history and religion. 
He even tinkered with computers on Wall Street before becoming an 
actor (appearing in the Broadway production of ``The Piano Lesson'' 
by August Wilson) and writing plays. (``Got four full-length plays 
produced,'' Redwood said, laughing, ``and 150 in the drawer.'') His 
mother was dead by the time he completed ``The Old Settler'' in 1994, 
and so were his father, his grandmother and many of the old-timers. 
But their voices and their music lingered in his memory and echoed 
in his work. ``Sa-tan, we're gonna tear your kingdom do-own,'' sang 
Redwood softly, as he perched on the stage during a recent rehearsal, 
his baritone rumbling through the words of an old spiritual sung by 
his mother's church choir. ``Whoa-ho, Sa-tan, we're gonna tear your 
kingdom down ...'' ``Those are the voices I heard growing up,'' said 
the author, who appears to be in his 50s but declined to divulge his 
age, saying that as an actor he does not want to be typecast in age-specific 
roles. ``Nineteen forty-three was my parents' period,'' he continued, 
``when they were young, when it was more the norm to be respectful 
to women, more the norm to look out for one another. And when they 
went out, they would come up to Harlem, even though they lived in 
Brooklyn.'' Redwood, who had small roles in the films ``Mr. Holland's 
Opus'' and ``Passion Fish,'' said he started writing out of frustration. 
The world he knew so well rarely appeared in plays, movies or on television. 
Where were the solid, working-class black families supported by men 
like his father, a mechanic and World War II veteran?, he asked. Where 
were the characters like his mother and aunt, the spunky, religious 
women who inspired his love for the Bible and his (brief) yearning 
to become a Baptist preacher? ``All of us don't walk around screaming 
and cursing and cutting and solving our problems with knives or guns, 
but that's what you see,'' said Redwood, who has three grown children 
and a daughter in high school. He started dabbling in the theater 
after falling for an aspiring actress in an era he calls ``pre-August 
Wilson.'' So he began scribbling on the road while performing in regional 
theaters, writing ``Mark VIII,'' a play about two mothers, one white, 
one black, whose babies are swapped in a hospital; ``A Sunbeam,'' 
about a mother's tortured love for her retarded son, and ``Acted Within 
Proper Departmental Procedure,'' which chronicles a black police officer's 
struggle to balance her work and personal life. In 1995, ``The Old 
Settler'' caught the attention of Lloyd Richards, the veteran director 
who has brought a number of Wilson's plays to Broadway and who was 
then running the National Playwrights Conference, the prestigious 
summer workshop at the Eugene O'Neill Theater in Waterford, Conn. 
At the time, Richards, who had cast Redwood in ``The Piano Lesson,'' 
knew him only as a ``very solid actor.'' But after thumbing through 
nearly 1,500 manuscripts to select the 15 plays to be given staged 
readings that summer, Richards was captivated, he said, by the authentic, 
lyrical language of the characters in ``The Old Settler.'' In the 
play, young domestics are said to dance their feet sore at the weekly 
``Kitchen Mechanics' Night'' at the Savoy Ballroom, the one night 
they can dance free of charge. Quilly loves ``swamp seeds'' (rice) 
and ``pot liquor'' (the savory liquid left over after stewing collard 
greens and salt pork). And when Elizabeth rebukes her young suitor 
(Godfrey L. Simmons Jr.) for buying an outrageous suit, Quilly snaps 
at the dumbfounded boarder, ``Ain't no use you standing looking like 
Uncle Ben before he started cooking rice.'' ``John is a writer with 
a wonderful ear,'' said Richards, who put on ``The Old Settler'' that 
summer of 1995 and arranged to have it produced the next year in Russia 
as part of an exchange program with the O'Neill. ``There are rhythms, 
music to the play, to the language,'' he said. Writing about an earlier 
production in The New York Times last year, Peter Marks praised the 
play's ``heartwarming'' and ``ruefully funny'' story, as it was presented 
at the McCarter Theater in Princeton, N.J., in a co-production with 
the Long Wharf Theater in New Haven. But he said that the ``tried 
and true'' formula resulted in a somewhat predictable plot. Emily 
Mann, the artistic director at the McCarter, said theatergoers, both 
black and white, had responded effusively. ``It's a love story that's 
so dear and so sweet and so moving,'' Ms. Mann said. Accustomed to 
the twists and turns of an unconventional career, Redwood seems to 
shrug off both praise and criticism. On the night of the play's first 
preview at Primary Stages, he wore blue jeans and a baseball cap and 
had a matter-of-fact manner. When asked whether he was excited to 
see the New York production finally coming together, he announced 
unexpectedly that ``The Old Settler'' was never his best play. ``Not 
that there's anything wrong with it,'' said Redwood, who stands 6 
feet 3 in his blue Converse All-Stars. It's just that ``A Sunbeam'' 
is his favorite. Nevertheless, he has worked hard to get ``The Old 
Settler'' produced, ``and produced properly,'' in regional theaters. 
He leaves scolding telephone messages for directors who use upbeat 
tempos for gospel songs meant to be melancholy. When a casting director 
told him there was no way to get Ms. Uggams to play the lead role 
in New York, Redwood took matters into his own hands. Describing how 
she met the playwright at a reading in Manhattan, Ms. Uggams recalled: 
``All of a sudden, I hear this big, deep voice saying, `I've been 
looking for you.' I turn around and there's this man standing there. 
I hadn't heard of him, but he's going on and on about this play. ``He 
says, `I just so happen to have it with me,' and whips it out of his 
bag. It seemed so bizarre.'' But she took the manuscript home that 
night and by 10 o'clock the next morning was calling Redwood at his 
home in East Orange, N.J. ``I just loved the play immediately,'' said 
the actress, who grew up in Washington Heights in northern Manhattan 
and had relatives who lived in Harlem. She said the characters felt 
like old familiar friends and the story captured the flavor of a period 
when North and South were colliding as the Great Migration swept thousands 
of blacks from Southern farms to Northern factories. ``I said, `I've 
got to be a part of this,' '' Ms. Uggams remembered. ``It's one of 
our stories, and that's so rare to find.''
