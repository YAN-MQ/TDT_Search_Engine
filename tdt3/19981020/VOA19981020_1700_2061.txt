An attorney for Paula Jones has asked a U.S. appeals court to reinstate 
sexual harassment lawsuit against President Clinton, saying critical 
evidence in the case was ignored. VOA correspondent Michael Leland 
reports. Lawyers for Ms. Jones say a lower federal court judge ignored 
critical evidence and facts in dismissing the lawsuit in April. Tuesday 
in St. Paul, Minnesota, Jones attorney Donovan Campbell and his colleagues 
had 30 minutes to convince the appeals court Ms. Jones does have a 
valid complaint. We thought that the questioning by the Eighth Circuit 
was very fair and very thorough on both sides. We don't think that 
anyone can predict how the Eighth Circuit will rule based on the questioning 
that was raised. President Clinton's attorney, Robert Bennett, said 
he was also pleased with Tuesday's proceedings. Mr. Clinton denies 
the incident Ms. Jones alleges ever happened. The lawsuit was dismissed 
in April when a federal judge ruled Ms. Jones had failed to show she 
suffered on the job after turning down the alleged advances. Michael 
Leland, VOA News, Chicago.
