You're tuned to the Voice of America coming to you from Washington. 
I'm Tom Crosby with Susan Yackee bringing you this hour of VOA News 
Now. It's 21 hours, 17 minutes universal time. Here's the hour's top 
news story. U.S. officials say the Israeli-Palestinian summit has 
entered a new phase of very hard bargaining with President Clinton 
and Jordan's King Hussein now on hand to mediate. Details on that 
story and more coming up in our next newscast about 12 minutes from 
now. It's time for sports, and joining us here in the studio with 
the latest details is Steve Shy. And Steve, baseball, baseball, baseball. 
That's right.
