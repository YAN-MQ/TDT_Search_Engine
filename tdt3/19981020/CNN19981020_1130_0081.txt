A new poll shows Americans believe the gap between rich and poor is 
growing. 67% of respondents described themselves as "haves," 24% deemed 
themselves "Have nots." Most of the respondents said money and wealth 
should be more evenly distributed. Even so, most people believe more 
Americans are getting rich. 74% said they believe the number of wealthy 
is increasing. That's up from 65% in 1990. The poll was taken before 
the roller-coaster ride on Wall Street began.
