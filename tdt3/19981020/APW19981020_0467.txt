Israel would be willing to deploy Arrow missile batteries in Jordan 
and Turkey in times of need, as long as the United States agrees, 
an Israeli newspaper on Tuesday quoted a senior Israeli defense official 
as saying. David Ivri, a senior aide to Israeli Defense Minister Yitzhak 
Mordechai, told the Haaretz daily that nations in the Middle East 
are in a race to deploy weapons of mass destruction and that the West 
has failed to slow the proliferation of such weapons. Israel's Arrow 
missile, expected to be operational by mid-1999, is intended as a 
defense against ballistic missiles possessed by Iran, Iraq and other 
potential enemies, such as Syria or Libya. The Defense Ministry had 
no immediate comment on Ivri's remarks. In the past, Israeli Prime 
Minister Benjamin Netanyahu has suggested sharing the Arrow technology 
with allies in the region.
