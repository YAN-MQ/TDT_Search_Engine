A new study shows the number of low-income students having breakfast 
at school has nearly doubled in the last ten years. The "food research 
and action council," a public interest organization, reports that 
in 1988, 3.1 million low-income students participated in the government-sponsored 
school breakfast program. Over ten years, that number increased 94%, 
to 6.1 million. And the number of schools that offer the program nearly 
doubled in that period. Studies have shown children who eat breakfast 
perform better in school, and have fewer behavioral problems.
