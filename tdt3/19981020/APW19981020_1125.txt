Valencia missed two second half chances and Liverpool was thankful 
to hold on for a 0-0 tie in the second round of the UEFA Cup Tuesday. 
A four-time Champions Cup winner, Liverpool looked a pale shadow of 
the team that dominated Europe in the 1970s and early 80s although 
it had chances in the first half. It hopes to do better in the second 
leg in Spain is Nov. 3. Liverpool decided to rest 18-year-old England 
World Cup forward Michael Owen who has been showing signs of weariness 
after playing 80 games in 17 months. The striker entered the game 
17 minutes from the game but made little impact. After defender Vegard 
Heggem had blocked a goalbound shot from Valencia's Miguel Angulo, 
Liverpool twice went close to going ahead. A header by German international 
striker KarlHeinz Riedle was kicked off the line by Gica Popescu in 
the 15th minute and then Paul Ince fired over the top from 12 meters 
after Valencia again failed to deal with a Liverpool corner. Czech 
forward Patrik Berger fired a 25-meter left footer in the 26th minute 
only for Valencia goalkeeper Santiago Canizares to keep it out with 
an acrobatic fingertip save over the top. Popescu squandered a great 
chance when Argentinian striker Claudio Lopez shrugged off and turned 
a Liverpool defender and turned the ball back to the Romanian who 
fired into the crowd from no more than 16 meters. Liverpool sent Owen 
on for Robbie Fowler with 17 minutes to go and Oyvind Leonardsen for 
Berger but the home team still struggled to create openings. Romanian 
forward Adrian Ilie got clear of the Liverpool defense with 10 minutes 
to go but fired wide. Then Liverpool goalkeeper David James, keeping 
American international Brad Friedel out of the team, made a spectacular 
diving save to keep out a free kick from Valencia captain Gaizka Mendieta 
with six minutes to go.
