Now that New York is seeing renovation left and right, with a freshly 
minted Grand Central Terminal and the once-derelict Times Square so 
crowded no one goes there anymore (as Yogi Berra may or may not have 
said about Toots Shor's), how about the island's signature cocktail? 
What happened to the Manhattan? How come (italics)it(end italics) 
has taken so long to get a face lift? A bar standard in the 1940s 
and 1950s, the drink languished for years, along with most other whisky-based 
concoctions in a health-and-hangover-conscious America that favored 
the gentler touch of light beer, wine and vodka. But a more alcoholically 
robust generation has recently rejected such tentativeness and is 
imbibing so-called classic cocktails anew, updated versions of the 
Manhattan among them. ``I'm seeing people in their 20s drink Manhattans,'' 
said Paul Pacult, a co-host of ``The Happy Hour,'' a weekly radio 
show on WEVD-AM that is the ``Car Talk'' of the drinks world. ``When 
I'm in a restaurant and I hear a bar call for a Manhattan specifying 
what they want in it, it kind of pricks up your ears.'' A traditional 
Manhattan consists of rye whisky, sweet vermouth, bitters and a maraschino 
cherry. Sometimes called the whisky martini, it has benefited from 
the retro chic that has brought martini bars and their attendant veneer 
of smartness back into vogue. Certainly a Manhattan is its own experience. 
Whereas a martini is celebratory and chrome-plated, a Manhattan is 
nostalgic, like a black-and-white movie. It is a cocktail noir: sip 
one long enough and its rich, dark retrospection will evoke double-breasted 
suits and Bakelite telephones with Butterfield 8 exchanges (the Lady 
in Red is optional). One reason for the revival is that the current 
taste for single-malt Scotches has spun off into interest in premium 
bourbons. And bourbon, being sweeter than Scotch, complements sweet 
vermouth. When Andrea Immer, beverage director of Windows on the World, 
created her Greater Manhattan drink for the reopening of the restaurant, 
she used bourbon for rye and substituted Harvey's Bristol Cream sherry 
for vermouth. For those few who prefer their Manhattans dry, or ``perfect'' 
(a traditional designation meaning that the vermouth portion should 
be half sweet and half dry), Lori Montfort, a manager at Alva on East 
22nd Street, chose merlot instead of vermouth. The result _ with one 
part merlot and three parts Maker's Mark bourbon plus a dash of bitters 
_ is both dry and dark, so for a bit of brightness, Ms. Montfort uses 
a lemon peel instead of a cherry. The linchpin of the Manhattan is 
the bitters, said Gary Regan, the other host of ``The Happy Hour.'' 
``They bring together the herbal aspects of the vermouth and the forthrightness 
of the whisky and point up the best aspects of both.'' David Marsden, 
the bar manager at City Hall, a new restaurant on Duane Street in 
TriBeCa, calls a good Manhattan the test of a good bartender. ``It 
should taste like rainwater,'' Marsden said, ``a silky, soft, very 
mellow flavor from beginning to end.'' Now, fair is fair. At least 
two other boroughs have namesake drinks: the Brooklyn, an obscure 
combination of rye, dry vermouth, maraschino and Amer Picon (a kind 
of bitters) and the somewhat better-known Bronx, composed of gin, 
sweet and dry vermouth and orange juice. But those are frankly also-rans. 
For people in many parts of the country for whom New York is a distant 
fantasy rather than daily reality, a drink called Manhattan becomes 
a kind of totem. Rex Roberts, who now lives in Brooklyn, grew up in 
John O'Hara country, Schuylkill County, Pa. For him, back in the early 
70s, partaking of a Manhattan at age 18 was a worldly rite of passage. 
``It was the first mixed drink I ever had,'' he recalled. ``When I 
bellied up to the bar, I ordered a Manhattan because I loved the name, 
and I had always been in love with the idea of moving to New York. 
I was awed by the aura of the city. I drank them for quite some time 
without knowing what was in them.'' Legend has it that the Manhattan 
was first concocted at the Manhattan Club in 1874. The drink is very 
much a product of the Gilded Age, favored by the likes of J.P. Morgan. 
In those days, bartenders made liberal use of vermouth, which had 
only recently been imported to America. The sweet or ``Italian'' variety, 
especially, reflected the tastes of the late 19th century, when sugar 
syrup was common in cocktails. And in the Northeast, at any rate, 
whisky usually meant rye. But straight rye was a casualty of Prohibition, 
when it was overtaken by Canadian spirits smuggled across the border. 
(Using Scotch, of course, yields a Rob Roy.) In postwar America, the 
Manhattan was known as a women's drink. ``A Manhattan was more palatable 
than a martini,'' Dale DeGroff, the beverage director of the Rainbow 
Room, said. ``It had a sweetness and a roundness to it _ and a cherry. 
It was seemly and proper.'' Back in the Manhattan's first heyday, 
it was usually served on the rocks and in an old-fashioned glass. 
The drink now often finds itself strained into a martini glass to 
highlight its complex color. ``If somebody wants ice,'' Marsden of 
City Hall said, ``I can tell you it's somebody's mother or grandmother.'' 
Karen King, wine director of the Union Square Cafe, says she is ``very 
attached'' to the Manhattan straight up. ``It's almost a piece of 
art to me,'' she said. ``It's an accessory, like a nice pair of earrings 
_ it looks lovely with the cherry bouncing around in there and the 
light shining down on the glass.'' The secret to fully appreciating 
a traditional Manhattan, or today's variations on the theme, is that 
it should, if possible, be consumed on the island itself. What makes 
the difference? Could it be that rumbling of the subway underfoot 
_ or is it those taxi fumes in the air? THE GREATER MANHATTAN Created
