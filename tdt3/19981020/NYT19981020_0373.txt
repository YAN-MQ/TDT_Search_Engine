The suspicious fires that erupted across a snowy mountain ridge high 
above here on Monday were still unsolved Tuesday, but they have shed 
light on the dark grumblings in the town below about a corporate ski 
giant that is seen by many residents as aggressively acquiring water, 
business, real estate and Forest Service land. ``Vail Resorts used 
to be the 800-pound gorilla, they are now the 4,000- pound gorilla,'' 
said Robert McLaurin, Vail's town manager. He emphasized that the 
skiing giant was ``a pretty good corporate citizen,'' but added, ``If 
you walk the streets of the community, Vail Resorts is not held in 
particularly high regard.'' Since it became a publicly traded company 
almost two years ago, Vail Resorts has bought two ski areas, Keystone 
and Breckenridge, and five hotels, and has started a joint venture 
with Colorado's largest sporting goods chain. While visiting skiers 
routinely rate Vail as the best ski area in the nation, residents 
here say they see a different side, a company that is a monopolizing 
octopus. ``Vail is a little like Microsoft,'' Jan Wanamaker, a 45-year-old 
caretaker, said Tuesday. ``They seem to be buying up everything, hotels, 
real estate.'' No one has claimed authorship of the fires, and it 
is not known if they stemmed from any of the grievances in town. Isolated 
from each other, but apparently erupting in linear sequence, the fires 
destroyed a luxury restaurant, a picnic shelter and the mountain's 
ski patrol headquarters. They also damaged buildings housing machinery 
for four chair lifts. ``I don't think that anything like this has 
happened in the history of outdoor recreation in America,'' said John 
Frew, president of Colorado Ski Country USA, an industry group. Referring 
to the presumed fire setters, Frew added: ``They were very strategic 
in their planning and execution. It was not happenstance, not a series 
of lightning strikes.'' Gov. Roy Romer on Tuesday called the fires 
``an act of terrorism.'' Because the fires took place on U.S. Forest 
Service land, they were being investigated by the FBI and by the Bureau 
of Alcohol, Tobacco and Firearms. ``We are going to look at it as 
a criminal investigation,'' Kim Andree, spokesman for Eagle County 
Sheriff's Department, said Tuesday. ``No one has taken responsibility. 
There have not been any written messages.'' Vail Resorts officials 
said Tuesday that the ski area, the nation's largest, would open as 
scheduled, on Nov. 6. Estimating the damage at around $12 million, 
Andy Daly, the company president, said that three of the damaged chair 
lifts would be working by opening day and that prefabricated, modular 
buildings would be brought to the mountaintop by helicopter to replace 
the destroyed restaurant. The fourth damaged chair lift will be running 
by mid-January, he said. ``Vail will bounce back. This will not affect 
the ski season,'' Daly said, noting that the ski area has 31 chair 
lifts and 12 restaurants on the mountain. But for skiing, a sport 
that has become an industry in recent years, the fires seem to represent 
a loss of innocence. In recent years, as baby boomers aged, the number 
of ski tickets sold in Colorado, the nation's most popular skiing 
state, has increased marginally. Faced with stagnating ticket sales, 
ski companies increasingly try to make more money by moving off the 
mountains into retail, restaurants and real estate. From the winter 
of 1993-94 to the winter of 1996-97, the number of ski lift tickets 
sold in Colorado increased by six percent, to almost 12 million, while 
the dollars generated by the state's ski industry increased by 29 
percent, to $4.1 billion, according to Frew's industry group. Coming 
off the mountains, big ski companies like Vail and American Ski, which 
is dominant in the Northeast, collide with small, independently owned 
stores. ``The corporate world is buying up everything they can and 
trying to monopolize it,'' said Geoff Wells, a Vermont native who 
manages an independent ski store here. Last summer, Wells said, he 
tried to rent a storefront in Beaver Creek, a ski village dominated 
by Vail Resorts. ``Vail told me, you can't sell hats, you can't sell 
gloves, you can't sell socks, you can't rent skis.'' In Vail, restaurateurs 
complain that Eagle's Nest, a popular new midmountain restaurant and 
entertainment complex, is drawing patrons out of the village. ``They 
admit to taking 1,200 people a day out of Vail during the winter season,'' 
said Jonathan J. Staufer, who owns a gourmet kitchen supply business. 
``That's the equivalent of 12 restaurants a day going up the gondola.'' 
Adam Aron, the company chairman, retorted Tuesday, ``There is no evidence 
that we are eating the lunch of anyone around town.'' ``We have shown 
a clear desire that we do not intend to dominate our towns,'' Aron 
continued. Noting that the company rents most of its storefront space 
to outsiders, he said, ``We are willing to work with independent entrepreneurs.'' 
Aron said that by going public the company had been able to attract 
the capital to keep Vail as a world class resort. He said that in 
the last two years, the company had invested $200 million in improvements 
on the mountains of its four areas, had improved its central reservation 
service, and had invested heavily to expand jet service here in the 
winter. While Vail Eagle airport did not have regularly scheduled 
service eight years ago, this winter it will offer direct flights 
to 13 American cities. But environmentalists are seeking to exploit 
local business dissatisfaction with Vail Resorts in their campaign 
to stop the ski area's plan to expand into 885 acres of National Forest. 
Earlier this month, Ancient Forest Rescue, an environmental group, 
mailed letters to 350 ski clubs around the nation asking them that 
if they came to Vail, they should go to establishments owned by independent 
operators. ``The community has been overwhelmingly opposed to what 
Vail is doing in Category 3,'' said Jeff Berman, a leader of the group, 
referring to Vail's back country expansion. ``Ski resort employees 
who have spoken against it have been told to shut up.'' Berman said 
that a Forest Service query period elicited comments from 375 people 
who were opposed to the expansion, from 20 people who were neutral, 
and from 6 who were in favor. Opposition speakers dominated three 
meetings held last spring by the Eagle County Commissioners. Nevertheless, 
the Commissioners voted to approve the project. Environmentalists 
contend that the development would harm wildlife migration and would 
only serve to raise the value of a 6,000-acre parcel of private land. 
The resort company has an option to buy half of it. Aron of Vail Resorts 
said that such opposition flies in the fact of ``facts and science 
and environmental sensitivity.'' ``The expansion was approved by the 
local government, by the state government by the federal government, 
by the district court,'' Aron said of a series of obstacles which 
were finally cleared last week.
