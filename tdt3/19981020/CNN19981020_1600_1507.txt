Hollywood often takes its inspiration from newspaper headlines. The 
new movie "one tough cop" is a perfect example. Cynthia Tornquist 
has the story. In 1981, New York City witnessed a heinous crime -- 
the rape and mutilation of a Catholic nun. They carved crucifixes 
all over her body. What kind of an animal would do this? Bo dietl 
was the street cop who helped break the case. We went on the streets 
and did what we had to do. What they did to that nun in that commune, 
when they beat her up, raped and sodomized her, carved 27 crosses 
into her and did things that I couldn't even mention on the air, that 
really affected us. Dietl's story became the subject of the book "one 
tough cop" and is now the basis of a film by the same name. Martin 
bregman, whose film credits include "dog day afternoon" and "Serpico," 
produced "one tough cop." Dietl was an executive producer, and approved 
the film's star, Stephen baldwin. I whispered in his ear, I said, 
"I'm the guy for this part. And if you can't see that, you're an idiot." 
He almost threatened me, and I looked at him like I wanted to crumble 
him up, but I had a lot of admiration that he had the -- how would 
you say it -- Cahones, to talk to me that way. Baldwin bulked up for 
the role, putting on 30 pounds of muscle. He also worked on dietl's 
Queens accent. Bo's voice is way up like this, and he's talking, he 
gets very hyper-tacious and he talks, he uses crazy words like that. 
He says, you know, "A lot of chaos-itation going on." He adds "itation" 
to everything. He starts to talk like me, he sounds like me. And I 
just tell him, "don't get too used to being me." Since he retired 
from the force in 1985, dietl has used his investigative skills to 
create a $10 million a year private security company. When I left, 
I didn't know what I was gonna do. I was very depressed, but good 
fortune has come my way, and I've been very, very lucky. The movie 
is not totally accurate. Dietl says he was not tied to the mob, as 
the film implies. Don't talk about my mother, all right? However, 
this much is true. Bo dietl was one tough cop. I was an in-your-face 
type guy, that a lot of people didn't like it. It's not difficult 
to see why. Cynthia Tornquist, "CNN Entertainment News," New York.
