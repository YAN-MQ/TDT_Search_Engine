Swimmers on Germany's national team have reacted angrily to claims 
by two teammates that performance-enhancing drugs like EPO are being 
used by the team. But the accusations by swimmers Chris Carroll Bremmer 
and Mark Warnackie drew guarded support Tuesday from the chairman 
of the Anti-Doping Commission of swimming's world governing body. 
Harm Bayer, who is also the former chairman of the German Swim Federation 
said he did not have proof but believes the allegations by Bremmer 
and Warnackie, in his words, "There are too many hints if you hear 
deep voices, see acme, and a sudden improvement in times." Warnackie 
and Bremmer both said swimmers can get around doping controls with 
the help of sports doctors. They say when it's done right, the doping 
cannot be detected by any testing. Teammates of Bremmer and Warnackie 
disputed the allegations in an interview with the "Berlin Daily BZ" 
on Tuesday. They denied seeing or receiving pills and said the accusations 
had smeared the reputation of the entire team.
