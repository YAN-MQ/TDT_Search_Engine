China and Vietnam have agreed to step up negotiations to settle much 
of their disputed land and sea borders, a Chinese Foreign Ministry 
official said Tuesday. Vietnamese Prime Minister Phan Van Khai and 
Chinese Premier Zhu Rongji agreed Monday on accelerated border talks 
to meet a 2000 deadline set last year, Chinese Foreign Ministry spokesman 
Tang Guoqiang said. Making the first visit by a Vietnamese premier 
since the once hostile communist neighbors normalized relations in 
1991, Khai also discussed the disputed border with Li Peng, head of 
China's legislature, and also met with President Jiang Zemin, state 
media reported. Jiang, who heads China's Communist Party, and Vietnamese 
Communist Party General Secretary Do Muoi agreed last year to demarcate 
by 2000 the land border and the waters of the Tonkin Gulf, known to 
the Chinese as the Beibu. Demarcating the border would ``bring a peaceful, 
friendly and stable boundary between China and Vietnam,'' said Tang, 
the Chinese spokesman. He added that many rounds of negotiations have 
produced ``some progress.'' China invaded Vietnam in 1979 to punish 
Hanoi for ousting Beijing's Khmer Rouge allies in Cambodia. Although 
the border war was brief, relations remained tense throughout the 
1980s, and their navies skirmished in 1988 over the disputed Spratly 
islands. The islands _ a set of shoals and reefs in the South China 
Sea _ are not a part of the border demarcation talks and are a constant 
source of friction between Vietnam and China and four other regional 
governments that claim them wholly or partly. Last month, China accused 
Vietnam of sending troops who built structures on two reefs. Vietnam 
said the reefs were not part of the Spratlys. Despite the border disagreements, 
trade between China and Vietnam has boomed, from dlrs 30 million in 
1991 to dlrs 1.44 billion last year, according to one Vietnamese newspaper. 
Vietnam's Khai and China's Zhu discussed ways to promote trade and 
investment, China's official Xinhua News Agency said. Senior economic 
officials were accompanying the two premiers in the talks. Afterward, 
Chinese and Vietnamese officials signed a treaty on judicial assistance 
in civil and criminal cases, a border trade agreement and a consular 
treaty. Xinhua gave no details, but problems between the two countries 
include smuggling and poor quality goods.
