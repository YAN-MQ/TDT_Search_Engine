Cubs slugger Sammy Sosa returned home to the Dominican republic today 
and received a welcome fit for a president. Sosa receiving the Caribbean 
country's highest civilian honor. His homecoming has been declared 
a day of national celebration. Your country has been through so much 
recently with the hurricanes. Do you feel that coming home is giving 
them a relief and a welcome relief? Definitely yes, you know. I can 
do what Sammy Sosa can do. They have to know that I'm not going to 
take care of the whole country because they know that I have family. 
But yes, I'm going to do everything that I can do.
