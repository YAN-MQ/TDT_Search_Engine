A military court on Tuesday ordered three South African soldiers to 
be discharged for misconduct during peacekeeping activities in Lesotho. 
The charges included negligent firing of weapons, losing weapons and 
being absent without leave, said Lt. Col. Laverne Machine, a spokeswoman 
for the South African National Defense Force. The soldiers were among 
1,000 South African and Botswanan troops who entered Lesotho last 
month to quell an army mutiny and protest by opposition parties that 
nearly shut down the capital of Maseru through August and September. 
The government asked the troops for help. Another six soldiers face 
charges to be heard by the military court on Wednesday. Lesotho, a 
tiny mountain kingdom of 2 million people, is surrounded by South 
Africa.
