Real Betis took the lead with five minutes to play but Willem II Tilburg 
equalized a minute later as the sides drew 1-1 Tuesday in their UEFA 
Cup second round first leg tie. Humberto Alexis scored with a delicate 
chip five minutes from time to give Betis a 1-0 lead but almost immediately 
from the restart substitute Mariano Bombarda held off defender Topmas 
Olias, turned and fired a left-foot shot low past Betis goalkeeper 
Antonio Prats from the edge of the penalty area. Prats was Betis' 
hero, pulling off three good saves to keep his team in the match. 
In the 51st minute Marcel Valk let loose a curling 25-yard (meter) 
shot that forced a good diving save from Prats. The athletic 'keeper 
again kept his team in contention in the 56th minute when he dived 
to his right to brilliantly parry a powerful close-range shot by Adil 
Ramiz. Prats was on hand once more to save a strong header by Delano 
Hill from a 68th-minute corner. Apart from the late goal, Betis' best 
chance fell in the 28th minute when Finidi George broke down the left 
flank and crossed to Juan Merino who slipped as he attempted to sidefoot 
the ball past Jim van Fessem in the Tilburg goal.
