Swedish police on Tuesday hunted for an American man suspected of 
assault for allegedly having unprotected sex with women he picked 
up at Stockholm nightspots, despite knowing he was HIV-positive. The 
search was the top story on national radio news and in afternoon newspapers, 
prompting calls from about 100 women to authorities, Ulla Andersson, 
an assistant in the investigation, told The Associated Press. The 
Stockholm District Court identified the suspect as James Patric Kimball, 
40. A statement from the court said he is originally from california, 
but did not give the city. Andersson said the man has been living 
in Sweden since 1992. ``This is a lethal man on the loose in society,'' 
prosecutor Jan Frykman said on Swedish TV. ``To spread a deadly sickness 
in this way shows a murderer's instinct.'' The court on Tuesday ordered 
him taken into custody on suspicion of rape and assault. At least 
eight people in Sweden have been convicted on assault charges for 
engaging in unprotected sex while knowingly being HIV-positive, including 
one man who infected his own wife. Kimball came to police attention 
two weeks ago after a woman said she had gone home with him and was 
given what she believed to be a drug-laced drink. Under police questioning, 
the man said he was HIV-positive, according to newspaper reports. 
Prosecutors said they did not have sufficient evidence to hold him 
in custody at the time. But a subsequent investigation turned up an 
address book in which the man reportedly had listed the names of 190 
women, with marks indicating he had sexual intercourse with at least 
16 of them. Police are now trying to contact all of the women listed 
in the address book. The man reportedly met many women in bars and 
told them he was a party-arranger. In Finland last year, former New 
York resident Stephen Thomas, a rap singer and nightclub doorman, 
was sentenced to 14 years in prison on 17 counts of attempted manslaughter 
for having unprotected sex with women without telling them he was 
HIV-positive.
