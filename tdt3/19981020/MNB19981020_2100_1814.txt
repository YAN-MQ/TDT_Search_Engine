The Middle East peace talks taking place in the state of Maryland 
were deemed to be too sensitive at a sensitive stage, at least, sensitive 
enough to bring in a man respected by both sides and just might make 
a difference at this case. Enter king Hussein of Jordan, who arrived 
today. He interrupted cancer treatments to attend. He appeared thin 
and gaunt in a photo released last week. The president attended for 
the fifth straight day, trying to broker a Land-for-peace deal. Clinton 
held a one-on-one meeting with Arafat late in the day. And the state 
department is describing the meetings as a phase of hard bargain. 
They'll go late tonight.
