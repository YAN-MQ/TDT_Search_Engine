Before we talk more about the dangerous places around the country 
later on in the broadcast, time for a look at the weather. For that 
we go to WNBC-TV in New York, meteorologist Janice huff. Hi, Brian. 
The main fecuss of weather tonight remains over Texas, where the record 
flooding continues. Many rivers over southeastern Texas remain above 
flood stage. However, the good news is that the heavy rain has shifted 
north now away from the flood-ravished areas. Portions of the northern 
Texas through the Panhandle and parts of Oklahoma seing the bulk of 
the rain tonight and today. Back across the southwest, some moisture 
leftover from hurricane Madeline reducing showers and thunderstorms 
over New Mexico and Arizona. On the west coast, high pressure and 
California seeing typical fall, october weather with warm conditions 
as the winds flow down the mountains from the east and things warm 
up. Temperatures in the 0s today in the bay area and southern California 
as welling. Across the Great Lakes cold rain showers falling. Down 
across the rest of the easterneaboard, nice day today. Tonight's low 
temperatures will be cold across the northern half of the country, 
20's and 30's torrent, 50ings and 60's over the southern half. Highs 
in the 80's tomorrow. Lots of that from Tallahassee down to Miami. 
Chilly across New England and the Great Lakes with the highs in the 
40's and 50's. The reason why is a dip in the jet stream. That will 
dip even farther as we go through the week. The cold air will shift 
south from Canada to even parts of the carolinas. Windy weather for 
Florida and along the gulf coast. The west warms up. Temperatures 
will be above normal from the Canadian border just north of mon tan 
know all the way down south into California and parts of Texas. That's 
the weather around the nation. Back O you. Janice, thank you.
