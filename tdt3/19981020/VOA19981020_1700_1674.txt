President Clinton says he'll travel to Cape Canaveral, Florida next 
week to watch the Shuttle Discovery launch that will return retiring 
Senator John Glenn to space. A White House spokesman says the president 
wants to take part in the historic event on behalf of Mr. Glenn who 
was the first American to orbit the Earth. The astronaut turned senator 
made his first space flight in 1962, and at 77 will now be the oldest 
person sent into space.
