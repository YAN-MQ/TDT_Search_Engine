No more ham and eggs for you. Actually it's a continental breakfast. 
Oh, sorry. They don't eat ham and eggs on the continent? The idea 
is to be with dairy growth. That's the dragging race, not what whether 
you get eggs or not. Well, thanks very much for all the pledges. We 
made the goal of 15 for the break and the goal for the program here 
on 91 FM, WHYY FM, Philadelphia, your member supported NPR station. 
Stay tune for THE WORLD coming up and the news from NPR.
