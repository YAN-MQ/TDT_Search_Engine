In Victoria, Texas, four days of heavy rain have left as many as 500 
homes damaged or submerged by floodwaters. A city spokesperson says 
the guadalupe river has reached 33 feet, breaking the previous record 
from 1936. 27 miles to the northwest in Cuero, the guadalupe is cresting 
at 49 feet, double flood stage. The floods have killed at least 18 
people. We'll have the extended weather forecast for the United States 
coming up at eight minutes past the hour.
