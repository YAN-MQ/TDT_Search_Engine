Lawrence Taylor hasn't tackled anyone in five years, but one thing 
has stayed the same for the former Giants All-Pro linebacker: He hasn't 
avoided drug charges. For the second time in three years, Taylor was 
arrested at a hotel room and charged with possession of crack cocaine. 
His latest arrest occurred Monday morning in Florida, where Taylor 
had gone to play in a celebrity golf tournament. Taylor said he was 
prodded repeatedly by an undercover police officer to buy the drugs. 
``Any time a law enforcement agency can solicit you all day and you 
tell them no and then they have the nerve to come to my room at 2 
a.m. and try to sell me drugs,'' Taylor told The Associated Press 
as he left the Pinellas County Jail after posting $15,500 bail. Admitting 
that he had done some bad things at other times in his life, Taylor 
said, ``I'm just waiting for my day in court.'' Taylor, 39, was arrested 
at 2 a.m. Monday by the St. Petersburg Beach, Fla., police's special 
response team and charged with buying three pieces of crack cocaine 
for $50 from an undercover officer. He also faces a misdemeanor charge 
of possession of drug paraphernalia in his hotel room. According to 
the police, Taylor was ``found in possession of numerous pieces of 
crack cocaine, smoking devices and utensils.'' The police say Taylor 
admitted his knowledge of the drug paraphernalia's presence, after 
they arrested him in Room 509 of the Sandpiper Resort. ``At this point, 
it's only an accusation,'' said Thomas Melani, a New Jersey-based 
lawyer for Taylor. Charged with Taylor was Victoria Corey, 41, an 
employee of Taylor L.T. Enterprises, which Taylor owns. Taylor, who 
lives in Upper Saddle River, N.J., was last arrested on May 3, 1996, 
at a celebrity golf tournament in Myrtle Beach, S.C. According to 
the police, Taylor tried to buy $100 worth of crack cocaine from undercover 
agents. He resolved the case by enrolling in a pretrial intervention 
program that would wipe out the charges after he served 60 hours of 
community service and submitted to drug counseling and random drug 
testing. Taylor underwent rehabilitation for cocaine use in 1986. 
In 1988 he was suspended for the first four games of the season for 
violating the NFL's substance abuse policy for a second time. George 
Young, a National Football League executive who was formerly the New 
York Giants general manager who drafted Taylor, said he was ``deeply 
saddened'' to hear of Taylor's plight. ``The Giants have tried to 
do the best they could to help him,'' Young said. ``They tried to 
help him help himself. Wellington Mara and Bob Tisch have been very 
sensitive to that,'' Young said, referring to the Giants' owners. 
``They've helped him at different times, including since he retired. 
They certainly haven't abandoned him. Wellington is on top of that 
because he cares.'' Young paused and added, ``I know some of his former 
teammates have been worried about him, too. Harry Carson, about a 
month ago, told me he was concerned about him. George Martin, too. 
It's a great sadness.''
