Negotiators at the mideast peace summit in Maryland will spend a sixth 
day tackling unsettled issues. Talks were extended through Tuesday 
as President Clinton met with palestinian authority President Yasser 
Arafat and Israeli prime minister benjamin Netanyahu late into Monday 
night. Sources say negotiators have resumed discussions on several 
issues. Talks Monday were limited to security, after a grenade attack 
in Israel. Both sides reportedly are considering a comprehensive land-for-security 
deal instead of a partial agreement. President Clinton encouraged 
them to stay the course. The United States will do everything we can 
to help. But ultimately, only the parties themselves can bridge their 
differences and put their people on a more hopeful course. The issues 
are difficult, the distrust is deep, the going has been tough, but 
the parties must consider the consequences of failure and also the 
benefits of progress. Monday's grenade attack happened in the city 
of beersheba. Police say a Palestinian man threw two grenades into 
a bus station crowded with Israeli soldiers. Up to 66 people were 
hurt, two seriously. Wire reports say a bus struck the suspect as 
he tried to flee and then a Construction worker jumped him from behind 
and wrestled him to the ground. Authorities say the man has confessed 
to the attack.
