In an interview with CNN, Fidel Castro suggests President Clinton 
is so wrapped up in the investigation of the Monica Lewinsky scandal 
that attention has been diverted away from Cuban issues. Not that 
I'm applauding Clinton's conduct, Clinton's mistakes. But one must 
take into account the efforts Clinton made in the economy, the certain 
advantages that the American people have obtained, the successes of 
his administration. Above all, in my opinion, this has irritated people. 
The polls demonstrate it repeatedly that's correct the way in which 
they have gone after Clinton bothers people T deceit that was used 
in the videotape business.
