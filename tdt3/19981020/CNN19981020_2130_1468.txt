The aerospace industry is set to blast off with a new generation of 
reusable Rockets. Details are "online." Congress recently passed the 
commercial space act. If it's signed into law, private companies will 
be allowed to build reusable launch vehicles like the space shuttle. 
You can watch the construction of the next generation of space planes 
by linking to the NASA address below. The site has two Internet cameras 
in Palmdale, California, where the X-33 is being built. The cameras 
can be accessed through online calendars by date and time. A third 
Internet camera is located at the launch site at Edwards air force 
base. The X-33 is scheduled to roll out of the assembly building next 
spring. Test flights are set to begin in July. Another reusable rocket 
plane, called the X-34, is being built at Marshall space flight center 
in Huntsville, Alabama. You can download photographs of the X-34 from 
the NASA site. You can also get the latest news and information and 
access technical reports from the space transportation library. Visit 
CNN.com/online for links to this and other sites. And that's what's 
"on-line."
