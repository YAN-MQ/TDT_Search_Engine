Officially, the Pentagon still won't confirm that it sent a Barrage 
of more than 60 cruise missiles against suspected terrorist camps 
in Afghanistan two months ago. But U.S. intelligence officials now 
say they believe up to 100 terrorists in training and their leaders 
were killed in the August 20th attack on six separate camps. Still 
the primary target got away. Osama bin laden, accused by the United 
States of masterminding the U.S. embassy bombings in Africa, apparently 
escaped unharmed. Publicly, the U.S. insists killing bin laden was 
not the goal of the mission. We must be prepared to engage for the 
long haul, as there will be no easy or quick victories. But defense 
secretary William Cohen told U.S. troops in Saudi arabia that the 
strikes were aimed at bin laden's colleagues and hopefully bin laden 
himself. The failure to get bin laden has produced some grumbling 
in the Pentagon, that perhaps the wrong weapons were used. Sources 
say the U.S. used specially-equipped Navy cruise missiles that scatter 
shrapnel over a large area, good for taking out "soft targets" like 
radars, planes, and people, but of no use against hardened bunkers. 
Some military planners, particularly in the air force, argue that 
manned bombers, such as the stealth B-2 could have delivered Bunker-busting 
bombs that would have increased the body count, and perhaps the chances 
of hitting bin laden. In fact B-2s were deployed to Guam about two 
weeks after the attack on what the Pentagon claimed at the time was 
just an exercise. Was it an exercise? Well, they weren't used in any 
military action, so I guess in that sense it was an exercise. But 
air force officials now says deployment of the B-2s was, in part, 
a mission to standby for possible follow-up attacks that were never 
ordered. Senior officers dismiss the criticism of the August attack 
as "second guessing by armchair commanders." They point out that in 
a mission where secrecy was Paramount, moving strike aircraft within 
range could have tipped off the bad guys. Jamie McIntyre, CNN, the
