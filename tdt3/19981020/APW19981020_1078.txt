New York City voters apparently lost their last chance to vote on 
whether to replace Yankee Stadium when the state's highest court on 
Tuesday refused to hear a last-shot appeal to place a referendum on 
the Nov. 3 ballot. The 5-0 decision by the state Court of Appeals 
handed New York City Mayor Rudolph Giuliani a victory in his fight 
to keep the measure off the ballot. New York City Council Speaker 
Peter Vallone, a Democrat running for governor, had proposed giving 
voters a chance to decide whether a dlrs 1 billion stadium should 
be built for the Yankees on Manhattan's West Side, about a mile from 
Times Square. Yankee Stadium, one of the most famous ballparks in 
America, was built in the Bronx 75 years ago, and since completely 
renovated. Vallone has no more avenues for judicial appeal. However, 
he said he would ask the U.S. Justice Department to intervene. He 
contended that New York City residents are effectively being deprived 
of the right to vote by the Giuliani administration.
