Is a consolidation coming in the home-building business? That could 
be one message drawn from the announcement Tuesday that Kaufman &AMP; 
Broad Home Corp. will buy privately owned Lewis Homes, a leading builder 
in California and Nevada. The price is $409 million in cash and stock, 
plus the assumption of $135 million in debt. Already the largest home 
builder in California and the West, Kaufman &AMP; Broad said the transaction 
would make it the largest in the country, based on its plans to deliver 
21,000 homes in 1999. The current leader, Pulte Corp., is now building 
about 15,000 homes a year. The deal was not officially announced until 
after the close of trading but Kaufman &AMP; Broad's stock surged 
$1.0625, or 4.7 percent, to close at $23.625. For 1998, Kaufman expects 
revenues of $2.4 billion based on delivery of 15,000 homes. Lewis, 
based in Upland, Calif., expects to deliver 3,500 homes in 1998 and 
record revenues of about $685 million. It is the largest builder in 
fast-growing Las Vegas, and is strong in Northern Nevada, Southern 
California and Sacramento. With low interest rates and a strong economy, 
home builders have been flourishing. But fears that a recession is 
coming have dampened share prices until the most recent week, when 
they have rallied somewhat. Kaufman &AMP; Broad has been expanding 
in the last few years outside California into other Western states. 
But the latest acquisition will strengthen share on its home territory, 
where it is being challenged by Lennar Corp., a Miami-based builder 
that is expanding aggressively in California through acquisitions. 
Kaufman &AMP; Broad and some other builders ``are trying to focus 
less on how many markets they can enter and concentrate on building 
bigger share in the markets they are in,'' said John Stanley, an analyst 
at Warburg Dillon Read, which represented Kaufman &AMP; Broad in the 
Lewis acquisition. Having a big market share gives a company an edge 
in procuring land and subcontractors and provides economies of scale 
in purchasing and advertising. Bruce Karatz, the president of Kaufman 
&AMP; Broad, said that the push for size and market share meant that 
more deals would be in the offing, both for his company and for others 
in home building, historically an industry run by small, locally focused 
entrepreneurs. ``People have figured out that you can successfully 
combine builders,'' Karatz said in an interview. ``It was the unwritten 
rule that you couldn't because they were entrepreneurs and everyone 
had their own way of doing things.'' Randall Lewis said he and his 
three brothers, who run Lewis Homes, decided to sell when they saw 
the benefits of size. ``The bigger companies were getting benefits 
in terms of purchasing, borrowing on Wall Street and buying land,'' 
he said. Still, a consolidation might not offer much opportunity for 
investors. So far, most acquisitions have been of small, privately 
held companies. One exception was the purchase earlier this year of 
Continental Homes Holding Corp. of Scottsdale, Ariz., by D.R. Horton 
Inc. of Arlington, Texas, a transaction valued at $467 million on 
the day it was announced. Growth through acquisition is only part 
of Karatz's strategy. He has launched a program called KB2000 that 
aims to make home building more of a disciplined business. Instead 
of building houses and hoping to sell them, as many builders do, Kaufman 
&AMP; Broad is trying to build to order, much like Dell Computer does. 
It does not offer completely customized homes, but does extensive 
consumer surveys and has built big showrooms to allow buyers to pick 
out the fixtures and designs they like. Karatz said that KB2000 is 
improving the company's sales and margins. But he concedes it is hard 
to isolate the effects of KB2000 on the company's results from the 
effects of the generally strong market in California and the West. 
The real test of KB2000 is likely to be when there is a downturn. 
That could also be when more mergers occur. ``A downturn in the housing 
market will force a greater amount of consolidation,'' said Steve 
Percoco, an analyst with Lark Research in Rahway, N.J.
