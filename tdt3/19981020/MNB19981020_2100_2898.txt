When we come back here tonight a look at tomorrow morning's newspaper 
headlines around the country. And later on, is it a serious run for 
office or the novelty of the moment? The 79-year-old Senate candidate. 
Good financial decisions require expertise. Life needs flexibility. 
Success demands leadership. If there's something you want to achieve, 
the principal has one word of advice. Plan a financial strategy for 
yourself or your business. Start today. 1-888-506-plan. The principal 
financial group. Most of the front pages we canvass tonight are covering 
the mideast peace talks and the Microsoft trial. There's also this. 
The house has approved the spending Bill that was agreed to leaders 
last last week. It pumps $500 billion dollars to farmers, among other 
things. Now it goes to the Senate then to the president for his signature 
so everybody can go home. "Washington Post," the Swiss are quoting 
investigators having concluded that a brother of the former Mexican 
president pocketted at least half a Million dollars from major drug 
cartels. They can't bring him to Switzerland for trial. What they 
can do is seize $114 million of that money. "The my yam mee Herald," 
Sosa's first trip back after baseball. He's an emotional guy. He says 
he will do everything he can to help his country recover from the 
damage of the storms there. The president and thousands of others 
wait for his arrival along with the NBC television station in Miami. 
And on the web site, MSNBC.com, more and more patients are E-mailing 
their doctors with questions about their health. But they're upset 
because the doctors aren't responding as often as the patients would 
like. On-line health experts are saying more uniform policies are 
needed for responding to questions from patients. There is always 
a reminder here, a call or an office visit.
