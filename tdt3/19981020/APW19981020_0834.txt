Floods threatened to inundate low-lying areas along a river in the 
Indian capital, forcing authorities Tuesday to evacuate more than 
16,000 people to safer grounds, news agencies reported. The level 
of the Yamuna River, which flows through eastern New Delhi, had risen 
one meter (three feet) over the danger mark Tuesday after the adjacent 
Haryana state released large quantities of water from a reservoir, 
the United News of India said. But New Delhi Chief Minister Sushma 
Swaraj said there was nothing to fear as all vulnerable points on 
the river bank had been plugged to prevent any breaches. The water 
level was expected to peak at 206 meters (680 feet) Tuesday evening 
but would recede since no more water was expected to enter the Yamuna 
from upstream, local officials said.
