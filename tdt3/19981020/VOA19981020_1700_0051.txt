U.S. officials say the Israeli Palestinian summit has entered a new 
phase of very hard bargaining with President Clinton and Jordan's 
King Hussein on hand to mediate. The U.S. officials say they hope 
King Hussein will be able to use his influence to help bring about 
an agreement on Israel's next withdrawal from the West Bank. Media 
reports quote Jordanian officials as saying an agreement between Israel 
and the Palestinians is imminent after nearly six days of summit talks. 
Palestinians say key obstacles to a new Israeli-Palestinian security 
accord have nearly been resolved by U.S. mediators. Israel television 
is predicting an agreement could be signed by Wednesday. U.S. officials 
say the summit already extended for two extra days cannot last forever.
