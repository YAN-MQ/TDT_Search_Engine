A man irritated by noise from a construction site across the street 
from his home called in a bomb threat in order to get peace and quiet, 
the state news agency MTI said Tuesday. Police investigators turned 
up no bomb but did track down a man they identified only as Laszlo 
J., 52, whom they said admitted to the threat. Despite the man's plea 
that the noise drove him to make the call out of desperation, police 
initiated criminal proceedings.
