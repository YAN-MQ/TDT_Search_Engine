A French court on Tuesday freed the jailed doctor of the Festina cycling 
team, which became the center of a doping scandal during the Tour 
de France. Eric Ryckaert, a Belgian, was released on 100,000 francs 
(dlrs 18,350) bail and was to remain under judicial surveillance. 
He had been jailed since July 17. Ryckaert has admitted the use of 
banned doping products at Festina, though the team's star rider, Richard 
Virenque, continues to deny he knowingly took such substances. Leaving 
a prison in Douai late Tuesday afternoon, Ryckaert said he was relieved, 
and hoped he wouldn't be ``a scapegoat in this doping affair.'' Festina
