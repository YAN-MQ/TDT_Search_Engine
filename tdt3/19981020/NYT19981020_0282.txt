In its early days, publicists for American Ballet Theater frequently 
called it ``a museum of the dance.'' That remains a good phrase to 
describe the company, provided one realizes that great museums can 
encourage new art as well as preserve old. Ever since its debut in 
1940, Ballet Theater has done both. It has staged the classics, often 
in elaborate productions. It has commissioned major world premieres 
like Jerome Robbins' ``Fancy Free,'' Agnes de Mille's ``Fall River 
Legend,'' George Balanchine's ``Theme and Variations'' and Antony 
Tudor's ``Pillar of Fire.'' It has also had a shrewd eye for acquisitions; 
its repertory over the years has included de Mille's ``Rodeo,'' Tudor's 
``Dark Elegies'' and Eugene Loring's ``Billy the Kid,'' all of them 
originally produced under other auspices but now closely associated 
with Ballet Theater. Kevin McKenzie, the troupe's current artistic 
director, is continuing these policies. As evidence, take Ballet Theater's 
two-week season, which opens on Tuesday at City Center. At various 
times in the past, the company would dance in more than one New York 
theater during the course of a year. More recently, it confined appearances 
here to one long summer engagement at the Metropolitan Opera House. 
Last year, however, McKenzie also offered an autumn season at City 
Center, and he is doing so again. Like an astute museum director, 
he has definite curatorial tastes. The Met, he explained in a recent 
interview at Ballet Theater headquarters, is for big spectacles, the 
dance equivalents of murals and monumental sculptures. But smaller 
works can look better at City Center. He recalled that last year at 
City Center balletgoers were often heard to exclaim in delight, ``You 
can see the dancers' eyes!'' McKenzie also wants to stress creativity 
and have City Center performances feature world premieres, as well 
as New York premieres of existing ballets, that he thinks deserve 
to be shown here. Thus the current season will give New Yorkers their 
first look at John Neumeier's ``Spring and Fall,'' a work to Dvorak 
from the repertory of Neumeier's Hamburg Ballet, and new creations 
by Twyla Tharp, Nacho Duato and John Selya, one of Ballet Theater's 
own dancers. On the basis of what he had observed in rehearsals, McKenzie 
called Ms. Tharp's creation ``complex and multitiered'' and Selya's 
offering ``jazzy.'' The title ``Spring and Fall,'' he noted, is ``a 
bit of wordplay referring both to the seasons and to two types of 
actions. ``I'm delighted that these particular choreographers happened 
to be available,'' he said, ``for they represent what I want to show 
at City Center.'' Ms. Tharp and Neumeier are internationally established 
figures. Duato is what McKenzie called a ``cutting-edge choreographer'' 
who is steadily achieving prominence. And, as Robbins was in the 1940s, 
Selya is a choreographic newcomer from the company's ranks. Of all 
these choreographers, Duato perhaps arouses the most curiosity. His 
ballets are well regarded abroad; he successfully brought his Madrid-based 
Compania Nacional de Danza to New York in 1994 and created the all-male 
``Remanso'' for Ballet Theater last year. Yet this 41-year-old Spanish 
choreographer is still comparatively unknown here. His new work, ``Without 
Words,'' which receives its premiere on Thursday, is a lyrical tribute 
to the power of nonverbal communication. ``People don't need to talk,'' 
Duato said as he paused between rehearsals at Ballet Theater. Nevertheless, 
he proved highly articulate as he spoke in fluent English about his 
24-minute work. The accompaniment is Schubert songs. Yet not a word 
will be sung. Instead, the songs will be heard in arrangements for 
cello and piano by Mischa Maisky. Explaining his decision to do without 
verbal poetry, Duato said: ``I could feel the poetry in the music 
itself. So I let my imagination flow and develop its own images apart 
from the text. And I hope the ballet will also stimulate the audience's 
imagination.'' The way a woman places a hand in front of her mouth 
becomes a central gesture in the action, one that is also seen in 
photographs of the dancers by Nancy Ellison that will be projected 
on a curtain during the ballet. ``The photographs represent other 
types of images without words,'' Duato said, ``and the dancers will 
interact with them. The curtain has slits through which people can 
enter or exit. The photos sometimes duplicate the dancers' poses. 
At other times they'll take on a life of their own apart from my choreography.'' 
Although Duato created ``Without Words'' in three weeks, the music 
had been in his head for more than a year. ``I want it to be a Romantic 
piece,'' he said, ``yet also very earthy and without the usual Romantic 
cliches.'' It requires eight dancers, all of whom are given solo roles, 
and Duato has rehearsed two casts in it. In one, an important pas 
de deux near the conclusion will be performed by Julie Kent and Vladimir 
Malakhov; on other occasions, it will be danced by Susan Jaffe and 
Ethan Stiefel. Duato is busy these days. In addition to creating two 
new ballets a year for his company in Madrid, which is steadily expanding 
its performing schedule both at home and abroad, he is being sought 
after by many other groups. He takes all such requests seriously. 
Yet, he noted, ``When I'm invited somewhere else, I first have to 
see the dancers. Then I have to get an idea of the company's repetiteurs, 
the people who will maintain the work in rehearsals. Some companies 
have good dancers, yet their rehearsal directors don't know how to 
keep ballets alive.'' Duato is pleased with Ballet Theater's staff. 
And he called it a company of ``real dancers.'' ``Real dancers,'' 
he explained, ``are ones who want to work and explore. They are the 
most humble, disciplined and versatile of all performers, and they 
are hungry to do new things.''
