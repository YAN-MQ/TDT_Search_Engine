Hong Kong's recession has been slightly worse than officials first 
believed, with the economy shrinking by 5.2 percent in the second 
quarter, or 0.2 percentage point more than originally estimated, the 
government said Tuesday. Hong Kong officially went into recession 
after the economy contracted for two successive quarters in the first 
half of the year. The figures for April-June were gloomier than expected 
because of ``the further slackening in local consumer demand and export 
performance,'' the government said Tuesday in releasing revised statistics. 
Officials noted, however, that the downturn was somewhat exaggerated 
by a surge in growth during the second quarter of 1997. The Hong Kong 
economy, which had grown by around 4.5 percent annually over the past 
decade, expanded 5.3 percent in 1997 before the Asian economic crisis 
started taking its toll. In August, the government estimated the economy 
would contract by 4 percent this year, compared with 3.5 percent growth 
forecast earlier this year. No new official estimates were given Tuesday. 
``Local consumer demand continued to be depressed by slackening income, 
rising unemployment and further slump in asset prices,'' the Hong 
Kong Census and Statistics Department said. Unemployment is at a 15-year 
high of 5 percent and property prices have fallen by up to 50 percent 
since their peak last year. Meanwhile, a broad measure of Hong Kong's 
inflation dipped to 1.6 percent in the second quarter, from 4.2 percent 
in the first quarter.
