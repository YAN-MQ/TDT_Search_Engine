Lazio's Chilean striker Marcelo Salas, who limped out with an injured 
left ankle during last Sunday''s league match with Inter Milan, is 
recovering quickly and may be started against Partizan Belgrade in 
the Cup Winners Cup first-leg second-round Thursday. Sven Goran Eriksson, 
the Swedish coach of the Roman team, said Salas will undergo a final 
test Wednesday. ``If he proves fit Salas will lead the attack along 
with Roberto Mancini against Partizan,'' Eriksson said Tuesday. Salas 
was injured shortly after scoring a quick goal in Lazio's 5-3 rout 
of Inter at San Siro stadium.
