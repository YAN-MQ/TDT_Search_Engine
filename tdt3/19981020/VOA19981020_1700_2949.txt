Time now for business news. Stock prices were up Tuesday in the United 
States as many U.S. companies reported stronger than expected earnings 
for the third quarter. VOA correspondent Elaine Johannsen has more 
on all that from New York. Selling pressure in the last two hours 
took the steam out of a major rally. The Dow Jones Industrial Average 
however stayed in positive territory closing at 8505, a gain of 39 
points. Standard & Poors 500 index closed almost flat while the technology 
dominated NASDAQ lost nine points after having been well up most of 
the day. Volume was extremely heavy. Better than expected U.S. corporate 
earnings for the third quarter made their mark with the recently battered 
bank stocks driving the Dow Jones up throughout the day. A gloomy 
report from Washington on the growing U.S. trade deficit which reached 
a record high in August did not appear to dampen the quiet optimism 
investors have been showing lately. Traders said investors seem to 
think that the worst of the global financial crisis may be over. Elaine 
Johannsen, VOA News, New York.
