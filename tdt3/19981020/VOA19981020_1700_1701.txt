And talking about star power, Jerry Hollowell may no longer be a member 
of the wildly popular British music group, The Spice Girls. She's 
still sending, however, the message of the group of girl power. At 
a crowded news conference at U.N. headquarters in New York, Hollowell

and reproductive rights. The 26-year-old Hollowell is now the new 
good will ambassador the U.N. Population Fund in Britain.
