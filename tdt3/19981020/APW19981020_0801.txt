Guinea-Bissau government troops clashed with rebels in the tiny west 
African nation Tuesday, raising the prospect of a return to civil 
war, Portuguese officials said. The fighting in the interior of the 
country prompted the International Committee of the Red Cross to suspend 
relief operations in the capital Bissau and the second-largest city 
Bafata, some 100 kilometers (60 miles) east of Bissau, ICRC spokesman 
Michael Kleiner said. Rebels and troops backing President Joao Bernardo 
Vieira exchanged mortar fire in Bafata and nearby Bambadinca, a spokesman 
for the Portuguese Defense Ministry said. Clashes were also reported 
in Quebu, near the former Portuguese colony's southern border with 
Guinea, which has an airfield. ``Our concern is that the fighting 
is spreading to the interior,'' Defense Ministry spokesman Vasco Colares 
Pereira told The Associated Press in Lisbon, adding that the extent 
of the clashes was unclear. Meanwhile, fighting in the capital subsided. 
An official at the Portuguese embassy in Bissau, who declined to be 
identified, said there was sporadic fire in the capital during the 
night, but everything was calm as morning broke. Senegal and Guinea 
deployed troops in the neighboring country to help Vieira contain 
the rebels, but it was not clear whether they were involved in the 
renewed fighting. Hundreds of residents gathered at Bissau's port, 
looking to leave the battered capital for the Bissagos islands, some 
50 kilometers (30 miles) off its western coast, Kleiner said by phone 
from Geneva, where the ICRC is based. Others chose southwestern and 
eastern land routes, adding to some 300,000 already displaced by the 
conflict that began in early June, he said. He said he had no reliable 
information on the total number of refugees. Hostilities restarted 
Sunday in the capital as army dissidents led by Brig. Ansumane Mane 
and government soldiers clashed near the presidential palace, breaking 
a 13-week truce. The Community of Portuguese-speaking Countries, or 
CPLP, which brokered the July 26 cease-fire, on Tuesday called on 
both sides to restrain their forces, the Portuguese news agency Lusa 
reported. The CPLP also asked their negotiating partner _ the Economic 
Community of West African Countries _ to ``urgently resume a joint 
mediation effort'', Lusa reported. Fighting erupted June 7 in this 
country of 1 million, when a rebel military faction seized Bissau's 
main army garrison and airport, demanding that Vieira step down for 
alleged corruption.
