In Washington, the computer software giant, Microsoft, has opened 
its defense in court against the case brought by the government. It's 
accused of using its dominant market position to try to squeeze out 
competitors. David LaValle has this report. In his opening defense 
argument, Microsoft lawyer John Warden tried to portray the company's 
tactics in the so-called browser wars as aggressive but legal. That 
logic sets the stage for Microsft to try and refute Justice Department 
complaints the company engaged in anti-competitive business tactics. 
Warden ridiculed the government's case saying it was their competitor 
Netscape that had a monopoly until, in his words, "the great Satan 
Microsoft came along." He said anti-trust laws are not a code of civility. 
For THE WORLD, I'm David Lavalle. Meanwhile, Microsoft reported a 
58 percent rise in earnings in the last quarter compared with a year 
ago.
