It's 4,000 pages long, and many members say they don't know exactly 
what it contains, but for better or worse, the house is expected today 
to vote and approve the proposed 1999 federal budget. The Senate is 
likely to do the same tomorrow. A vote on the $500 billion spending 
package will officially end the duties of the 105th Congress, just 
two weeks before election day. Farmers, school districts and the international 
monetary fund are among the big winners in the proposed budget.
