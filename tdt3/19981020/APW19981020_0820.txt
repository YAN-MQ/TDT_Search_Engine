Calling for close cooperation among Balkan countries in the Kosovo 
crisis, British Foreign Secretary Robin Cook arrived Tuesday in Macedonia, 
the second stop on his tour of the region. Cook is scheduled to meet 
Macedonian President Kiro Gligorov later Tuesday. On Wednesday, he 
will meet a leader of ethnic Albanians in Kosovo and U.S. ambassador 
in Macedonia and Kosovo envoy, Christopher Hill. Macedonia borders 
Kosovo, a Yugoslav province whose ethnic Albanians are fighting for 
independence. Macedonia has its own restive ethnic Albanian minority 
and there are fears that Kosovo bloodshed could spill over. Cook said 
earlier in Bulgaria that all Balkan countries must work together in 
order to prevent the clashes from engulfing the region.
