A retired Russian naval officer accused of high treason pleaded innocent 
Tuesday at the opening of his long-awaited trial, and the judge evicted 
most of the public after a half-hour, human rights observers said. 
Alexander Nikitin is accused of giving secret documents to a Norwegian 
environmental group, the Bellona Foundation, which compiled a 1996 
report criticizing the handling of nuclear waste and reactors in Russia's 
Northern Fleet. Nikitin pleaded innocent, though he told the judge 
he did not understand the charges against him, Diederik Lohmann, director 
of the Moscow office of Human Rights Watch, said. He was in St. Petersburg 
for the trial. The Defense Ministry decrees that Nikitin is accused 
of breaking have never been published and were shown to his lawyers 
for the first time Tuesday. They were revealed after the court was 
closed, and no details were released. Nikitin's lawyers have long 
argued that under Russia's Constitution, criminal charges cannot be 
filed on the basis of unpublished laws. Nikitin and Bellona also maintain 
that the information used in compiling their report came from public 
records. Human rights groups criticized Judge Sergei Golets' decision 
to close the court proceedings. ``To close the trial at the outset 
... is a tactical mistake because it will guarantee increased public 
outrage,'' said environmental lawyer Stephen Kass, a member of the 
board of directors of Human Rights Watch. Nikitin was not discouraged 
by the judge's decision. ``The court was in a difficult position,'' 
he said after court adjourned for the day. ``I think that everything 
will be all right.'' His lawyer, Yuri Schmidt, was also positive. 
``We are feeling completely confident ... because we are speaking 
the truth, and as one (author Mikhail) Bulgakov hero said, speaking 
the truth is a pleasant and easy thing to do.'' The maximum penalty 
for high treason is 20 years in prison. Prosecutors are asking for 
12 to 20 years, the Interfax news agency said. A crowd of supporters 
greeted Nikitin outside the courtroom Tuesday morning. Dressed in 
a gray suit, the 46-year-old former navy captain looked tense as he 
answered preliminary questions from the judge. Golets then closed 
proceedings, although a handful of people including Russian parliamentary 
deputy Alexander Shishlov, who is observing the trial on behalf of 
the Council of Europe, were allowed to remain. Prosecutors then read 
the indictment, which ran over 30 pages. Nikitin's lawyers said they 
will push for parts of the case to be open later. Golets said proceedings 
will be closed at least while Nikitin is questioned by the court. 
Nikitin's trial comes at the same time as proceedings against Capt. 
Grigory Pasko, a Russian military reporter accused of passing secrets 
about the Russian Pacific Fleet onto Japanese media. Pasko maintains 
that the documents simply detailed environmental problems at several 
Russian Pacific Fleet bases.
