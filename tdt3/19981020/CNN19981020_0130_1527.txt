The royal yacht "britannia" opened to the public Monday, after serving 
as a Traveling home for the royal family for almost 44 years. The 
luxurious 412-foot ship was retired in December, because it had grown 
too costly to operate. It now is permanently docked in Scotland as 
a tourist attraction, expected to draw 200,000 visitors a year.
