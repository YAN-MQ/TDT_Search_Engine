Firefighters in southern California are struggling to fully contain 
two fires that have charred about 7,000 acres. Two dozen planes and 
helicopters and 1,700 firefighters are trying to bring the fires under 
control. Calmer winds and cooler temperatures have helped in the effort 
today. Yesterday flames came within 200 yards of some homes, and a 
condominium complex was evacuated. A 3,800-acre wildfire in Ventura 
county is now 50% contained. A 3,300-acre blaze in Los padres national 
forest is 40% contained.
