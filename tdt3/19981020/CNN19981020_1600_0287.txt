It's Microsoft's turn to make opening statements in the antitrust 
trial against the software giant. Microsoft attorneys today said the 
company is a tough but fair competitor, and insisted antitrust laws 
"are not a code of civility in business." In the days ahead, we will 
show that the government's case is a groundless exercise, designed 
to benefit just a handful of Microsoft's competitors who do not compete 
with us on the merits of their technology. This is not a case designed 
or that will accomplish any benefit for consumers. In opening statements 
yesterday, justice department attorneys charged microsoft broke antitrust 
laws when, for example, it allegedly tried to coax Netscape to split 
the Internet browser market. When Netscape refused, the government 
claims Microsoft retaliated by pricing them out of the market. The 
trial is expected to last six to eight weeks.
