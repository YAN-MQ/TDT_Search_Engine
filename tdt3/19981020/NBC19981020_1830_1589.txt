If I say Las Vegas, what comes to mind? Bright lights, big names onstage, 
big bucks on the table, and someone trying to get your money in some 
way at every turn, right? Well, one of the architects of the modern 
Las Vegas thinks it is time for a Radical change, from the lowbrow 
to the highbrow. NBC's Mike Boettcher tonight. Think of this as the 
first shots fired in an epic Las Vegas struggle between class and 
crass. And at $1.6 billion, the bellagio, the costliest hotel casino 
ever built, hopes to forever change the way the public thinks of Vegas. 
With visitors and revenues declining, Las Vegas is trying to recast 
itself as a sophisticated destination. The past one or two years it 
started to slow down a little bit, so they needed an infusion of good 
ideas, something different. Something different, on a grand scale. 
Forget all you can eat buffets. Here, it's Crystal and caviar, at 
a branch of New York City's Le cirque restaurant. Neon is out, flora 
is in. There are 117 full-time botanists on staff. And most important 
of all, the big headliners -- a troupe of great masters. I won't have 
a chance to go to Europe, so I came all the way from L.A. just to 
see this. $300 million worth of masterpieces, from picasso to Monet, 
Hang in the bellagio. But art and Vegas? The hotel's owner, the acknowledged 
"king" of Las Vegas, Steve wynn, has a Lofty goal. To make it acceptable 
to people as an alternative to Paris, New York or San francisco. Steve 
wynn's huge wager, that sophistication and slot machines, beauty and 
baccarat can coexist, is one huge Gamble. But wynn believes. The trick 
is not getting people to play blackjack. The trick is getting people 
to come visit. Wynn said it would be a perfect day if he found someone 
in his gallery who'd never visited a museum. So we went in search 
and found them. John and Arlene pasturelo, who paid the $10 admission 
with their slot machine winnings. Until now, a book was their only 
gallery. I have a book at home, 50-year-old book, that's got about 
100 pictures of the famous paintings in the world. In this room I 
see two of them, the originals. I get a feeling you'll come back. 
If that's true, then that's great. a lot is riding on the hope that 
it is true all in the hands of a Vegas marriage between picasso and 
poker. Mike Boettcher, NBC news, Las Vegas.
