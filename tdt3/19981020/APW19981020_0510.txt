The Hanoi Civil Court has rejected a scriptwriter's lawsuit against 
a film company for allegedly violating his copyright, a film company 
executive said Tuesday. Nguyen Kim Anh, author of the novel ``Common-law 
Marriage,'' accused Film Studio No. 1 of the Ministry of Culture and 
Information of changing his script without notifying him. The court 
rejected his suit, the first in Vietnam's movie industry, saying the 
director followed the script's main themes but cut some parts because 
of budget problems, said the executive, who spoke on condition he 
not be identified. The court also ordered the author to pay dlrs 400 
for the fees of the script examining board. The court rejected Anh's 
demand that the movie's title be changed and his name removed from 
the credits. It said the movie can be distributed and the studio does 
not have to apologize to Anh, the executive said. Anh could not be 
reached for comment. The Capital Police newspaper reported that he 
vowed to appeal after the three-day trial ended Monday. Copyright 
violation is common in Vietnam, but very few cases have been brought 
to court. Vietnam and the United States signed a copyright agreement 
last year, but the deal still is awaiting U.S. ratification.
