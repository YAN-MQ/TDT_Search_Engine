Zimbabwe will host the summit of Congo Kinshasa and its allies Wednesday 
to discuss strategy in light of the rebels' increasing hold in Eastern 
Congo. Zimbabwe's president, Robert Mugabe, pledged to hold the forum 
after Congo's rebels took control of the government's eastern stronghold, 
Kindu. Zimbabwe has not officially announced the deployment of its 
troops in Eastern Congo, but it admitted Tuesday that 16 of its soldiers 
have been captured by rebels earlier this week.
