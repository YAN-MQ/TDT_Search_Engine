The U.N. health agency on Tuesday announced plans to develop a global 
strategy to fight tobacco, backing up scattered national efforts. 
World Health Organization experts want to create a new international 
convention to set global standards on controversial issues such as 
tobacco tax, smuggling, advertising and commercial sponsorship. ``Tobacco 
control cannot succeed solely through the efforts of individual governments, 
national (organizations) and media advocates,'' said WHO Director-General 
Gro Harlem Brundtland in a press release. ``We need an international 
response to an international problem.'' Brundtland, who made the fight 
against tobacco a mainstay of her campaign for election to the post 
three months ago, was not present at the announcement. It's the first 
time the WHO has agreed to use its right as a U.N. agency to draw 
up an international convention. The WHO's anti-tobacco task force, 
known as the Tobacco Free Initiative, will develop the convention's 
framework. The accord will also tackle issues including international 
trade, package labeling and encouraging alternatives to tobacco farming. 
``We're focusing on ways of addressing tobacco control, the tried 
and true ways which have been steadfastly used in some countries with 
success,'' said Derek Yach, the Tobacco Free Initiative project manager. 
``There's nothing fancy about price and taxation increases, yet most 
countries haven't done it. Nothing new about calling for advertising 
bans, yet the vast majority haven't addressed it. We're just not doing 
it as a world community.'' It isn't being done fast enough either, 
according to the WHO. WHO statistics show one person dies every 10 
seconds from a tobacco-related illness. If nothing is done in 20 years, 
the rate of death in Europe will climb 20 percent. It is estimated 
200-300 million smokers will die by 2025 if the trend continues. However, 
just ratifying the convention may take that long. While some of the 
more scientific-based conventions have been approved within 10 years, 
rubber-stamping others can take up to 40 years. The WHO would like 
to see the actual framework agreed upon perhaps within five years, 
Yach said. Meanwhile, the Tobacco Free Initiative is seeking legal 
ways of ensuring ``the tobacco industry meets its financial obligations 
for death and disease caused by the use of its products.'' In the 
United States, 46 states are engaged in a multi billion-dollar lawsuit 
with tobacco companies. ``The industry has hidden information for 
40 years,'' said Yach. ``When we hear they are scared of the WHO, 
we're thrilled because what they're scared of in reality is the public 
and government support that backs the WHO.'' Supported by the World 
Bank and other agencies such as UNICEF, the U.N. children's agency, 
the WHO spends just dlrs 5-6 million a year on its fight against tobacco. 
The United States alone spent dlrs 1 billion this year. Both efforts 
are just a tiny fraction of the lucrative dlrs 400 billion tobacco 
industry.
