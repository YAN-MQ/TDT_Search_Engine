Vietnam will double government spending for agriculture, which has 
helped the country avoid the political and social instability that 
some regional countries have faced, a senior Communist Party official 
said Tuesday. Nguyen Duc Trieu, a member of the decision-making party 
Central Committee and chairman of the Farmers Association, said a 
committee plenum decided last week to raise spending for agriculture 
and rural development to 20 percent of state budget expenditures. 
Allocations for other sectors may have to be cut as a result, he said. 
Most agricultural spending has focused in recent years on irrigation 
projects. Now, it may expand to improve processing industries to add 
value to farm products and research new seeds and varieties to improve 
productivity, Trieu said. Agriculture is very important for Vietnam, 
helping to ensure stability and limit the impact of the Asian economic 
crisis, he said. ``Agriculture produces materials for processing industries, 
and richer farmers will help to increase the society's purchasing 
power, which in return helps to boost the economy,'' Trieu said. About 
80 percent of Vietnam's 78 million people live in the countryside. 
Spending for agriculture has fallen to about 10 percent of the state 
budget in recent years from 21.7 percent in 1985, Trieu said. The 
five-day plenum, which ended Saturday, has decided to lower the national 
economic growth target to 5 to 6 percent for 1999. The original 1998 
goal of 9 percent was adjusted in July to 6 to 7 percent. The 1999 
target and doubling spending for agriculture must be approved by the 
National Assembly, which starts a monthlong session Oct. 28.
