The U.S. Olympic Committee is preparing for a controversial process 
that seeks to upgrade medals for American athletes who lost to East 
Germans in cases where the use of performance-enhancing drugs can 
be documented. The first request could be made within the next several 
weeks, and involves seeking a gold medal for American women who finished 
second to East Germany in the 400-meter medley relay at the 1976 Summer 
Games in Montreal. Since the fall of the Berlin Wall, documents and 
testimony have established what had been long suspected: a state-sponsored 
system of performance-enhancing drug use that existed in the former 
East Germany from 1968 to 1988 and that may have involved 10,000 athletes. 
After first saying that it could not rewrite history, the International 
Olympic Committee said earlier this year that it would consider adjusting 
results on a case by case basis. Urged on by athletes who felt they 
were cheated out of medals, the U.S. Olympic Committee has begun preparations 
to challenge East German results, particularly in swimming, where 
50 possible cases could come under scrutiny, Bill Hybl, president 
of the committee, said. The USOC has got ammunition for its challenges 
from trials this year in Germany in which a former East German doctor 
and a swimming coach admitted giving performance-enhancing drugs to 
young female swimmers, were convicted of causing bodily harm and were 
fined about $4,000. Hybl said in an interview that challenges would 
be made only in cases where there was an admittance of drug use or 
a conviction in court. The USOC would not seek to take medals away 
from East Germans, Hybl said, but would seek to give Americans ``appropriate 
recognition'' for their achievements. This means seeking to give an 
American a duplicate gold medal if he or she had won a silver or to 
have an asterisk placed by the result of a particular race. The first 
case that may be challenged involved the 400-meter medley relay in 
Montreal, where the East German team of Ulrike Richter, Hannelore 
Anke, Andrea Pollack and Kornelia Ender defeated an American team 
of Linda Jezek, Lauri Siering, Camille Wright and Shirley Babashoff. 
Rolf Glaeser, a former East German coach, admitted in court last summer 
that he had given Pollack and other swimmers performance-enhancing 
drugs. The USOC is awaiting a German judge's written decision in which 
Glaeser was convicted last summer of causing bodily harm to swimmers. 
Once that decision is received, perhaps within the next two or three 
weeks, Hybl said that the USOC might use the medley relay as the first 
case in challenging the East German swimming dominance. ``We want 
our gold medal,'' said Wendy Boglioli, an alternate on the American 
relay team, who also won a bronze medal behind Ender and Pollack in 
the 100-meter butterfly in Montreal. ``We deserve to have that in 
the record books.''
