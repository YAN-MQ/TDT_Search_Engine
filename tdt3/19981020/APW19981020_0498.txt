Nine years after the demise of Communism, Jewish history and culture 
are still taught inadequately in Czech schools, the American Jewish 
Committee in Prague said Tuesday. The Treatment of Jewish Themes in 
Czech Schools was the second in a series of reports prepared for the 
committee's Central and East European Curriculum Review Project that 
focuses on countries that have recently emerged from Communist rule. 
The first report dealt with Poland. According to the report, Czech 
textbooks devote less attention to Judaism than to other religions, 
as Judaism is generally included under Christianity in the curricula. 
The legacy of Jewish monotheism is neglected and Judaism as a living 
religion of today is completely ignored, the report said. The study 
also complained that Jewish history is taught in an unsystematic fashion 
without a larger historical context. ``Based on the information available 
in the textbooks, it is impossible to form a clear picture of the 
integral role of Jews in modern history,'' the report says. The author 
of the report, Leo Pavlat, told reporters that the study is aimed 
at fighting intolerance and xenophobia in the Czech population through 
education. ``Our aim is not to simply announce the result and walk 
away,'' David Singer of the American Jewish Committee said, adding 
that in the next several years the committee will try to monitor whether 
the study had any practical result. ``Attitude towards Jews is a barometer 
of general tolerance within the society,'' Singer said. ``It's not 
because the Jews would consider themselves a special phenomenon that 
would require special treatment,'' Pavlat said. ``It's a historical 
experience.'' He said that Czech educators have said they want to 
improve the situation but that there have been problems in ``translating 
the good will in concrete deeds.'' He warned that should the education 
towards tolerance remain limited to a few campaigns or handbooks, 
``the endings cannot be good.'' Prague traditionally was one of Central 
Europe's most important Jewish cultural centers. But the Jewish community 
was decimated by Nazi occupation in World War II, when some 80,000 
Czech Jews perished in death camps. Only some 10,000 Jews now live 
in the Czech Republic. Expressions of racism are now more often directed 
at the Gypsy minority.
