Western nations will continue opposing the aspirations of ethnic Albanian 
separatists in Kosovo for full independence from Yugoslavia, British 
Foreign Secretary Robin Cook said Tuesday. He said Britain is ``firmly 
committed to the territorial integrity and security of the countries 
in this region.'' ``One of the reasons why it is so important that 
we resolve the instability in Kosovo is to make sure that it doesn't 
spread over into wider insecurity in the region,'' Cook told reporters 
after talks with Bulgarian Premier Ivan Kostov. ``The international 
community has never given its support to an independent Kosovo. We 
believe that the way forward is for the countries of the region to 
cooperate together to break down the barriers between them rather 
than to try to create new boundaries,'' Cook told a news conference. 
He also said the people of Kosovo do not accept autonomy as a sufficient 
statement of their aspirations and that it is the right of the Kosovars 
to run their own affairs and to have control on their own police. 
``That is why we have called for the self-government of Kosovo,'' 
Cook said and added that there should be elections within the next 
nine months and that those elections should be supervised ``not by 
Belgrade but by the OSCE.'' Cook arrived late Monday on the first 
stop on his Balkan tour, then flew on to Macedonia for a meeting with 
President Kiro Gligorov on Tuesday night. Before leaving for Romania, 
he was to meet in Skopje on Wednesday with other Macedonian officials 
and with Kosovo Albanian leader Fehmi Agani. On Monday, Cook said 
in London that Britain will continue pressuring Yugoslav President 
Slobodan Milosevic to ensure he complies with agreements made to end 
civilian deaths and fighting in the troubled Serbian province of Kosovo. 
Hundreds of people on both sides have been killed during more than 
seven months of clashes between Serb forces and the rebel Kosovo Liberation 
Army. Some 300,000 people, mostly ethnic Albanians, have been displaced 
from their homes in the province, which is predominantly ethnic Albanian.
