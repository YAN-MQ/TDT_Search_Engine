A federal appeals court in St. Paul, Minnesota, will begin hearing 
arguments Tuesday to determine whether to re-instate Paula Jones' 
sexual harassment suit against President Clinton. His legal team has 
rejected a $2 million out-of-court settlement offer. Bob Franken has 
more. That in turn has put added pressure on both parties to settle. 
The Jones legal team tells CNN it believes the president is much more 
willing to deal because of his admission that his Jones deposition 
testimony was at the very least questionable. While my answers were 
legally accurate I did not volunteer information. But there is a question 
whether the Lewinsky disclo surs make a Difference. If he slept with 
half the women in America that doesn't mean he harassed paula Jones. 
The president has a big political decision to make Indeed, in the 
wake of what has happened since, it might be best to get out from 
under the suit that sparked the Lewinsky investigation. And the appellate 
court is all republican appointees. Jones's lawyers have warned her 
that it is unlikely the Supreme Court would accept the case if she 
loses now and that would mean no money for Jones who has hefty legal 
bills. Is she going go goord, this going be settled? What will happen 
to her? Add to her pressure her husband Steven who resists any setlement 
that would not leave them with no legal bills and several thousand 
dollars. There is nothing to prevent the appeals arguments from going 
on as scheduled. Bob Franken, CNN, Minnesota.
