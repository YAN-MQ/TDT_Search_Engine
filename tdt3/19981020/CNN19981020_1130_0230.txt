The White House says President Clinton will be leaving Washington 
in less than an hour to join mideast peace talks in Maryland. He canceled 
a campaign trip to California so he could attend the summit. Israeli 
and Palestinian leaders have been working in wye mills, Maryland, 
for six days to reach a peace deal for the West Bank. Another leader 
scheduled to join negotiations this afternoon is Jordan's king Hussein, 
who is in the United States for cancer treatment. Sources have suggested 
a comprehensive interim deal is close to being reached. White House 
press secretary Joe Lockhart says now is not the time to speculate. 
We don't read any conclusion into his arrival and his participation. 
I'd say obviously that there is serious work that's going on. The 
president was there again last night until late in the evening. Meetings 
have already begun there this morning with secretary of state and 
the delegations but there are significant gaps between the parties 
and the president is determined and to sused on helping the parties 
make the tough choices they need to make to move the peace process 
forward. To recap the latest on the mideast summit developments in 
Maryland -- President Clinton has canceled a California campaign trip 
to attend the summit. Jordan's king Hussein is scheduled to join negotiations 
today. And sources suggest leaders are discussing a total, comprehensive 
package.
