Dr. Edward Watson Hook Jr., a national authority on infectious diseases 
like salmonella and influenza, died on Oct. 5 at a hotel in Gettysburg, 
Pa., where he had gone for a meeting. He was 74 and lived in Charlottesville, 
Va. The cause was a coronary thrombosis, according to the University 
of Virginia, where Hook formally retired this year as Mulholland Professor 
of Medicine at the Health Sciences Center. He was chairman of department 
of internal medicine at Virginia for 21 years, until 1990. During 
his tenure he established the humanities in medicine program, offering 
classes to awaken medical students to the personal, human aspects 
of medicine. He frequently contributed to professional journals and 
trained hundreds of specialists in internal medicine. Hook, who was 
born in Sumter, S.C., graduated from Wofford College in 1946 and received 
his medical degree at Emory University three years later. Before joining 
the faculty in Charlottesville in 1969 as a professor and department 
chairman, he was associated with Cornell University Medical College 
and New York Hospital. He was a past president of national medical 
organizations, including the American College of Physicians, was elected 
to the Institute of Medicine of the National Academy of Sciences and 
served on the American Board of Internal Medicine. He was a former 
board chairman of the Robert Wood Johnson Foundation's Clinical Scholars 
Program. Hook is survived by his wife of 49 years, Jessie Thurecht 
Hook; two sons, Dr. Edward W. III, of Birmingham, Ala., and Robert 
R., of Crystal River, Fla.; two daughters, Susan Norton, of London, 
and Jane Brosig, of Sausalito, Calif.; and four grandchildren.
