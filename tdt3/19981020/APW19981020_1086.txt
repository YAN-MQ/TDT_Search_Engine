A Palestinian man arrested after throwing hand grenades near a bus 
stop in southern Israel told his interrogators that he also killed 
a rabbi in the West Bank town of Hebron this summer, the army said 
Tuesday. The suspect, 29-year-old Salem Rajab Sarsour, started out 
as an activist on the fringes of the Islamic militant group Hamas, 
but after killing Rabbi Shlomo Raanan was admitted into Hamas' military 
wing and was trained in the use of hand grenades, the army said. Sarsour 
also confessed to throwing two hand grenades at Israeli soldiers in 
Hebron on Sept. 30. Two dozen Israeli troops and Palestinian civilians 
were injured in that attack. After an initial silence, Hamas on Tuesday 
claimed responsibility for Sarsour's grenade attack in the southern 
Israeli town of Beersheba a day before. The attack wounded 64 Israelis. 
The Palestinian Authority said in a statement that Sarsour was a double 
agent who had provided information to the Israeli security service 
Shin Bet. After being blackmailed by his Shin Bet handlers who threatened 
to reveal his identity if he did not provide more information, Sarsour 
carried out the attacks to clear his name, the statement said. The 
Palestinian Authority ``holds Israel responsible'' for the attacks, 
the statement said. Israel TV reported that Shin Bet agents had met 
with Sarsour about two weeks ago in an effort to hire him as an informant. 
At the time, Shin Bet thought Sarsour was a minor Hamas activist and 
did not know his involvement in previous attacks. After a friendly 
discussion Sarsour reportedly agreed to help the Israeli agency and 
only after Monday's attack did the Shin Bet realize who Sarsour was.
