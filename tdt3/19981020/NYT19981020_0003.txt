Outside and inside Foxboro Stadium on Monday night, the rivalry was 
there to be seen and heard. Seen in the banner on U.S. 1 that growled, 
``Grill the Tuna T-shirts.'' Heard in the barbecue of boos for Bill 
Parcells as the Jets' coach returned to where he coached the Patriots 
to the Super Bowl two seasons ago. In a subplot, Curtis Martin, the 
Jets' $35 million running back, was also returning to where he rumbled 
for 3,799 rushing yards in three seasons as a Patriot. And the Patriots, 
perched in first place in the American Football Conference East, were 
waiting. Reminded last week that Parcells had suggested that maybe 
Coach Pete Carroll overworked Martin last season, the Patriot coach 
blurted: ``Oh, that was the biggest crock. Everything he says is a 
crock. You might as well make a list. He's just full of it.'' Told 
of Carroll's reaction, Parcells quietly replied, ``I don't want to 
get involved in that.'' The Jets' professor of psychology was having 
enough problems trying to press the buttons that would get his team 
airborne in the divisional race. And with a 24-14 upset victory on 
Monday night, the Jets are now 3-3 for the season, and 3-0 in the 
division. Parcells' latest psych job was walking out of Friday's practice 
in disgust before it was over. He took his coaching staff with him 
and left the Jets players out there on the practice field for the 
final hour of that day's rehearsal. Over the years, Parcells has often 
been described as a coach who ``knew the right buttons to press.'' 
But with these Jets, sometimes those buttons appear to be disconnected. 
It seemed that way when Parcells tried to press those psychological 
buttons before the Jets' visit to St. Louis a week ago Sunday. The 
Jets lost languidly, 30-10. ``The way I attempted to do it, I think 
I know where I made a mistake,'' the coach later confessed. ``I tried 
to call their attention to certain things that weren't obvious by 
the Rams' record. I was logical in my manner of thinking, but not 
effective in the result. I do better with the team when I'm illogical.'' 
Leaving players to practice by themselves on Friday is about as illogical 
as a coach can get. But Parcells has done it before. According to 
a Patriot historian, the Tuna they love to hate here did it once in 
either his first or second season as the Patriots' coach after taking 
over in 1993. Parcells' turbulent departure to the Jets ignited a 
rivalry that Patriots quarterback Drew Bledsoe has described as ``almost 
like the Yankees and Red Sox.'' Not quite. That baseball rivalry goes 
back nearly 80 years to when the Red Sox dealt Babe Ruth to the Yankees, 
and it has flourished ever since, especially when both teams are contenders. 
But at least the Patriots are the first real rival, both geographically 
and spiritually, that the Jets have ever had. The Jets' natural rival 
should be the Giants, but the two teams don't play each often enough. 
During the American Football League decade, the Oakland Raiders emerged 
as the Jets' notorious rival: Ike Lassiter breaking Joe Namath's cheekbone, 
the Raiders' 43-32 comeback in the ``Heidi'' game at Oakland, the 
27-23 victory in the 1968 championship game at Shea Stadium that put 
the Jets in Super Bowl III. Since then, only the Miami Dolphins, with 
Dan Marino, have passed as an occasional remote rival, but only when 
Ken O'Brien was the Jets' quarterback in their memorable shootouts. 
Mostly, the Jets just haven't been good enough to stir a real rivalry 
with anyone until Parcells returned to Foxboro early last season. 
The Jets pushed that Sunday night game into overtime before losing, 
27-24, but later stung the Patriots, 24-19, in a Giants Stadium rematch. 
Parcells said that Monday night's appearance on ``Monday Night Football'' 
was the start of something big _ a stretch of six games that the coach 
figured would determine whether the Jets would be a playoff contender 
or a playoff bust. After next Sunday's return to Giants Stadium against 
Dan Reeves' Atlanta Falcons, the Jets go to Kansas City, return home 
against the Buffalo Bills, then go to Indianapolis and Tennessee with 
a mandate from their coach to perform. ``If we're not successful in 
the next six weeks,'' Parcells said, ``the ability to do what the 
objectives were would probably be gone. I don't think you'll ever 
find in this league a team that was any good that couldn't win games 
on the road.'' And on Monday night, the Jets won a big game on the 
road.
