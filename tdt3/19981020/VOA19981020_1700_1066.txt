It's World Series time, Susan. The San Diego Padres will try to stop 
the New York Yankees' wave of momentum as they host game three of 
the series tonight. The Yankees took the first two games of the best 
of seven series in New York. The Padres are hoping former Yankee, 
Sterling Hitchcock, can shut down New York's offense. The left hander 
has allowed only one run in ten innings in the National League championship 
series and won the NLCS most valuable player award. He says the fact 
San Diego is playing the Yankees makes no difference. It doesn't matter 
if we're playing the Bad News Bears right now. It's the World Series. 
It's an opportunity to pitch in it, and you know, as a kid that's 
what you dream of. The Yankees will start 20 game winner David Kohn, 
who is making his fourth World Series appearance. Kohn says he's glad 
to prove some early nay sayers in the season were wrong. There was 
a lot of jokes early in the year about me being the weak link of the 
rotation as a starter. And, you know, I just wanted to not hurt the 
team at that point. I wanted to do something to contribute and now 
I've come full circle, and I was able to win 20 games. And, you know, 
it's been one of the most gratifying years of my career in that regard. 
Kohn has two wins and no losses, as well as an earned run average 
of 2.89 during the post season.
