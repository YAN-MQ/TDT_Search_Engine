Parma's midfielder Dino Baggio told Italian television interviewers 
Tuesday that he was injured in the head by a knife hurled by a rival 
fan during a UEFA Cup match in Krakow. ``I was hit by something in 
the head and then I saw a knife on the field. I could not believe 
it,'' said Baggio, who completed the match against Wisla after being 
treated by team doctors. The Italian international displayed to television 
cameras a head cut which required five stitches. The Italian RAI-2 
television channel reported that Parma officials did not immediately 
file an official complaint. The case will be considered by club officials 
on their return to Italy. Parma and Wisla played to a 1-1 draw in 
their first-leg second-round match of the UEFA Cup Tuesday. Baggio 
was injured during the second half and stayed off the field for treatment 
for about four minutes. Baggio's teammates were quoted by the Italian 
television as saying they also saw the knife on the field and that 
a Polish player was quick to hurl it off before the referee could 
see it.
