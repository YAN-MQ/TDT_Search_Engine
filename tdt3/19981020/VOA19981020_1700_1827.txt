U.S. officials say the Israeli-Palestinian summit has entered a new 
phase of very hard bargaining with President Clinton and Jordan's 
King Hussein on hand to mediate. The U.S. officials say they hope 
King Hussein will be able to use his influence to help bring an agreement 
on Israel's next West Bank pull out. Here is State Department spokesman 
James Rubin. Given his charisma, given his special role in the past, 
given the warm and extensively warm feelings that people have for 
him, and given his obvious willingness to try to play a part on the 
drama unfolding here at Wye, he is a very welcomed participant in 
the discussion. Media reports quote Jordanian officials as saying 
agreement is imminent. Palestinians say key obstacles to a new security 
accord are nearly resolved.
