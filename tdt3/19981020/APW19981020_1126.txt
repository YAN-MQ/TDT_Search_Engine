Leeds United hit the posts twice. Marco Del Vecchio scored once as 
Roma downed the British team 1-0 in their first leg second-round match 
of the UEFA Cup Tuesday night. Del Vecchio, an agile Italian forward, 
scored the game winner in the 18th minute at Rome's Olympic stadium. 
As Leeds' South African defender Lucas Radebe failed to clear a precise 
long pass by Francesco Totti, Del Vecchio rushed unmarked into the 
penalty area and put the ball between the post and goalie Nigel Martyn. 
One minute later Totti, who gave Roma a thrilling 2-1 injury-time 
victory against Fiorentina in a league match last Saturday, had the 
chance to make it 2-0 but his shot went past the post by a few inches. 
Leeds, masterminded by young Australian Harry Kewell, pressed on the 
attack after allowing the goal and had consecutive opportunities for 
an equalizer. Portuguese Bruno Ribeiro, left unmarked on a failed 
offside trap by the Roman defense, hit the post in the 23rd minute. 
Ten minutes later it was up up Norwegian Gunnar Halle to hit the post 
of the Roman net with a powerful diagonal shot. Leeds definitely gave 
up offense and control of the game when Ribeiro was sent off the field 
in the 55th minute after receiving his second caution. One player 
down, the British team suffered Roma's growing pressure in the last 
35 minutes but the home team did not produce impressive chances although 
fielding two forwards, Argentine Gustavo Bartlet and Russian Dmitri 
Alenichev, as substitutes for two midfielders. About 43,000 fans, 
including a few hundreds of vocal Leeds supporters, watched the match 
which marked AS Roma's 12th straight home victory in European Cup 
play. Roma's midfielder Luigi Di Biagio, who received his second caution 
in the tournament, will miss the next game, the Nov. 3 second leg 
in England. ``We were unable to take advantage from Ribeiro's expulsion,'' 
said Roma's coach Zdenek Zeman. ``Leeds proved strong, as expected. 
The second leg will be difficult.''
