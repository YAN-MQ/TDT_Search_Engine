It has computer stations instead of wooden desks, digital cameras, 
even electronic debit machines. Mike Collins looks at a school of 
the future, in this edition of "tech trends." a new day is dawning 
on education in this north Detroit suburb. Clarkston high school may 
be the prototype for what high-tech schools of the future will be 
like. At a cost of $58 million, this brand-new school features over 
700 computers. That's one for every three students at a cost of $1600 
each. They are interconnected by some 40 miles of fiber optic cable, 
and even computer-savvy kids are impressed. Bryan Hart's a senior 
interested in engineering. We've got all different things -- you go 
from automotive stuff, to doppler radar, to bridge building, to aerodynamics 
in planes. Then you get to go to another section and fly a plane. 
Why's thy twilight Everything here is interconnected. Even traditional 
music rooms are high tech -- microphones in the ceiling make them 
instant recording studios. School officials here say the schools cost 
is about $13 million more then a Traditional school building. And 
at $107 a square foot, it's worth every penny. Since we just moved 
into our building, we anticipate that our test scores will go up. 
We know they will go up. You're an accomplished writer, that's a -- 
that's a real goal. And teachers say students interest level goes 
up too. I think the computer makes you more creative. I think it allows 
more play, more wonder, more curiosity. And the students seem to be 
more willing to rework, to rethink. As impressive as this new technology 
is, the administration at clarkston high school insists the most important 
element is still the human touch and the teachers who can motivate 
and light a fire in a students mind. And as different as education 
may seem in 1998 -- The pizzas kind of burnt and it's really greasy. 
Some things remain the same. Michael Collins, CNN, clarkston, Michigan.
