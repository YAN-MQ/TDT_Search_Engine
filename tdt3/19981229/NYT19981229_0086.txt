It's surprising who pokes into an Internet discussion such as Usenet's 
newsgroup alt.usage.english. Who knew so many English computerists 
would be there? And the Brits don't care much about impeaching anyone, 
so the dialog is more entertaining. This week they were discussing 
the grand old American phrase ``ice cold brewskis and extra cheese.'' 
What sounds to the colonists like the perfect menu for an afternoon 
of TV football had the guardians of the Mother Tongue wondering, ``How 
do you get pizza out of that?'' The Americans wondered, ``What, they 
put cheese in their beer over there?'' The Brits countered, ``What, 
you've never heard of a pizza without cheese?'' And so the Queen's 
children drift further apart. Or farther, if you consider continental 
drift, because everyone in alt.usage.english knows that ``further'' 
expresses degree while only ``farther'' expresses distance. In other 
groups, these were some of the themes: _ Old friends in misc.rural 
were discussing what to do with frozen water pipes and how to control 
those field mice that come into the house in winter. The crops are 
in, obviously. The contributors had time to revive their old joke 
thread about ``yupnecks,'' their term for exurban gentry who commute 
to necktie jobs in the city. You could be a yupneck if you spent $300 
for a designer goat and he ate your $5,000 landscaping job around 
the barn. Or if your sushi bar is also a bait shop. Or if you like 
everything about the country but the people, the smell, and the music. 
_ In alt.quotations, the argument was about Kahlil Gibran, a poet 
whose fame soared in the 1960s because he was from India and hippies 
thought that was a center of knowledge until they noticed the Indians 
hadn't found a bed for everyone. ``I can't hear a line of his work 
without flinching,'' a contributor said. ``Wherein is he deemed a 
poet, or his works poetry? How did he ever manage to get published, 
let alone famous? In what way is his poetry more profound than a Barbie 
doll...?'' ``Oh, relax,'' another offered. ``Nobody reads Gibran any 
more anyway. Gone, along with Rod McKuen, and Maxwell Anderson, and 
the use of the words `ambience' and `charisma,' and pop art, and 12-tone 
music.'' There were parodies of Gibran in the thread too: ``Even the 
best of friends cannot attend each other's funeral'' and ``I have 
seen the future and it is just like the present, only longer.'' _ 
The group alt.quotations gets a lot of traffic, serving people in 
the world who don't write their own epigrams. G.K. Chesterton's line 
sometimes comes up at newspaper watering holes: ``Journalism largely 
consists in saying `Lord Jones Dead' to people who never knew that 
Lord Jones was alive.'' But unless they read alt.quotations, most 
crusty reporters probably didn't know Chesterton said it. Someone 
asked the source of this quote: ``It was a bright cold day in April 
and the clocks were striking 13'' Came the answer: ``1984, by George 
Orwell.'' Then one imagines a thoughtful interval, followed by the 
addendum, `` ... Why do you ask?'' _ How about those never-happy denizens 
of soc.history.what-if, always arguing alternate timelines, like what 
if Napoleon had won at Waterloo or if Robert E. Lee had brought elephants 
to Gettysburg? The what-iffers have a world map of their own, including 
The People's Democratic and Sovereign Republic of Quebec (founded 
in 1973 after the Quebecois War of Independence in 1971-1972) and 
the Greater Mississippi Republic (successor to the Holy and United 
Mississippi States of King Frederick Douglass, formed after the slave 
revolt in 1880 that toppled the Confederate States of America). All 
of these discussions are open and friendly, although others in Usenet's 
group array are juvenile, pedantic and a waste of bandwidth. It's 
user's choice. Usenet is available through most Internet service providers, 
as well as via DejaNews' search engine. Charles Stough is an editor
