From cataclysmic to merely annoying, experts are differing on the 
possible effects of the year 2000 computer glitch. In this edition 
of "tech trends," Rick Lockridge looks at how the government is preparing. 
It should be a party for the ages -- new year's eve, 1999. But what 
a hangover the next day, if the most dire predictions about the year 
2000 computer problems turn out to be true -- if the phones don't 
work, and the lights go out, and the ATM won't give you cash, if the 
airports are closed, and you can't drink the water, and your check 
is definitely not in the mail. Is the one year we have left to fix 
things enough time to prevent all of this? All the government agencies 
will not be done before the deadline. There will be some failures. 
Joel willemssen of the general accounting office will not sugarcoat 
it. Right now, as a country, we do not know where we stand on Y2K 
readiness on water, power and telecommunications. If you don't have 
water, power or Telecom, you can't get the job done. The so-called 
"Y2K computer glitch" is a programming flaw that prevents some computers 
from recognizing any year after 1999. Fixing the flaw is time-consuming, 
expensive, but unavoidable. This involves not just federal agencies, 
but everyone who depends upon a Computer, which is everyone, directly 
or indirectly. Take money. U.S. banks have spent $8 billion on Y2K 
readiness and say all accounts will be safe. Yet the federal reserve 
has ordered $50 billion in new currency in case there's a run on the 
banks anyway. Air travel? The FAA concedes it is still at least three 
months behind where it should be on Y2K preparedness. Defense? The 
Pentagon received a "D"-minus in the last congressional Y2K report 
card, but plans war games in June '99 to demonstrate preparedness. 
The department of energy got an "F" on that same report card. What 
will it do in '99 to ensure electrical power is available for all 
on y2K day? the irs? So far behind that the general accounting office 
says Americans could get erroneous tax bills in 2000 or refund checks 
they aren't entitled to. Telephones? Problematic. AT&T alone says 
it has 3,000 software programs to inspect and fix. Suddenly, a year 
doesn't seem like much time after all. And those who have not yet 
undertaken the task need to get on it and get on it now. Or the Y2K 
bug could crash the big party. Rick Lockridge, CNN.
