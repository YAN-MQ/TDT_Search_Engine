Former Soviet President Mikhail Gorbachev praised the partial merger 
of Russia and Belarus on Tuesday and spoke admiringly of Belarus' 
authoritarian leader, a news agency reported. Gorbachev said plans 
to forge closer links between Russia and its western neighbor could 
``become the beginning of a new union,'' although he denied that he 
supports a return to the Soviet Union, ITAR-Tass said. Although a 
union of the countries might hurt Russia economically, he said, ``Even 
if we lose, the loss will be momentary, but in the long run we will 
surely win.'' Presidents Boris Yeltsin of Russia and Alexander Lukashenko 
of Belarus have said they would take action to merge some of the functions 
of their governments, including defense and foreign affairs, and that 
the two would share a common currency. Lukashenko is an authoritarian 
president who is openly nostalgic for the Soviet Union. Gorbachev 
dismissed concerns about him, saying, ``Alexander Lukashenko is learning 
on the way, progressing.'' He noted, admiringly, that Lukashenko was 
the only member of the Belarusian parliament in 1991 to vote against 
dissolving the Soviet Union. Gorbachev spoke to reporters at a news 
conference marking the publication of his latest book, ``Thoughts 
on the Past and Future.'' Gorbachev speaks out frequently on political 
affairs, but his views carry little weight in Russia, where he is 
widely reviled for his role in the collapse of the Soviet Union.
