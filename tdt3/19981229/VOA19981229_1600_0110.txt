Iraq says it is challenging the U.S. and British patrolled no-fly 
zones by flying its own aircraft there just a day after American fighter 
jets attacked an Iraqi anti-aircraft missile battery. At the White 
House, correspondent Nick Simeone has the U.S. response to this latest 
Iraqi challenge. In another show of defiance against allied forces, 
Iraq's vice president warns Iraqi aircraft will not be kept grounded 
in the northern and southern no-fly zones telling reporters both areas 
exist only, as he put it, in the sick imaginations of the United States 
and Britain. In fact, a senior U.S. intelligence official says there 
have been a couple of incursions by Iraqi aircraft into the southern 
no-fly zone over the past day or two, but he called the flight so 
minor that they don't warrant concern. In another challenge, the Iraqi 
government says it will continue to fire on allied aircraft enforcing 
the air exclusion zones. On Monday, an Iraqi anti-aircraft missile 
battery did just that, provoking what the United States says was a 
retaliatory missile strike by American fighter jets. A White House 
official says there have been no new challenges to allied aircraft 
since Monday's skirmish and brushed aside these latest warnings from 
Baghdad saying American aircraft will continue to patrol the no-fly 
zones set up to protect Iraq's Kurdish minority in the north and Shiites 
in the south. Nick Simeone, VOA News at the White House.
