Sharply falling imports helped South Korea post a dlrs 3.33 billion 
current account surplus in November, the central Bank of Korea said 
in a preliminary report Tuesday. November's gain pushed the nation's 
combined current account surplus for the first eleven months of this 
year to dlrs 37.24 billion, compared with a deficit of dlrs 11.75 
billion during the same period last year. November's gain was the 
nation's 13th consecutive monthly gain. It compared with a dlrs 860 
million surplus during the same month last year. Exports fell 4.5 
percent to dlrs 11.6 billion but imports plunged 29.7 percent to dlrs 
8.1 billion. Imports have dropped sharply in recent months as businesses 
slashed capital investment and consumers spent less amid the country's 
economic crisis.
