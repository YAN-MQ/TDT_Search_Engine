Just how momentous a time is this when viewed against all of U.S. 
history and the many men who've occupied the highest office in the 
land? Here, with one view, author and presidential historian Doris 
kearns goodwin, "in her own words." In 1868, for the first and only 
time, a sitting president, Andrew Johnson, was impeached by the house 
and then was subjected to a trial in the Senate, where he was acquitted. 
That whole story, in a certain way, I think, gives us an extraordinary 
parallel to what's happening now. For one thing, Johnson was a democratic 
president, who was at loggerheads with a republican majority. They 
looked at him as a southerner, as a poor boy from the south, who in 
many ways, they thought, had a bad lifestyle. The republican majority 
felt that we should be rather harsh towards the south after the defeat 
in the civil war, that blacks should be allowed to be emancipated, 
that they should be allowed to vote. Andrew Johnson was moving more 
cautiously. It was the democrats versus the republicans. And when 
it was in the house, it was almost a strict partisan vote. But once 
it reached the Senate, the Tone really did change. When it got down 
to the final vote in the Senate, the politics did seem to melt away. 
The lesson from the 1868 impeachment for the present proceedings against 
President Clinton is that the standard should be whether or not it 
has a Bipartisan backing and the public considers it a legitimate 
use of the impeachment tool. If not, historians will roundly condemn 
the entire exercise as they did with Andrew Johnson's impeachment. 
Presidential historian and NBC news consultant Doris kearns Goodwin 
tonight, "in her own words." And the only other American president 
impeached, Andrew Johnson, president clinton sent a wreath that was 
laid at his grave today. Johnson was born 190 years ago. At his home 
not far from the grave site, workers used tape to cover the story 
board of his life since he is no longer the only impeached U.S. president.
