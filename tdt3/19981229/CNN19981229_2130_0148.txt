13 house republicans held a closed-door meeting today to discuss their 
strategy for President Clinton's impending Senate trial. The impeachment 
managers, led by Judiciary committee chairman Henry Hyde will act 
as prosecutors in the case. Among the debated issues, whether to call 
witnesses. Republicans say they will consider historical precedent 
in deciding how to proceed. This is not rocket science, folks. I've 
tried murder cases. A lot of us have tried some serious cases. I think 
you can present this case relatively quick. You can get to the points 
of legal interest relatively quick. You can do it in a way that you 
don't demean the Senate, that you don't demean the witnesses. But 
you have an adversarial process. It gets to the core issues rather 
quickly. And that's what we're going to do if people allow us to do 
it. And if we do it that way, history will judge us well. Despite 
democratic calls for a censure compromise, a Senate impeachment trial 
is expected to begin soon after the new Congress convenes on January 
6th.
