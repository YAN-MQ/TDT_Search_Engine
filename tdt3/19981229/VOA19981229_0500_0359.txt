The conflict between Iraq and the Anglo-American Alliance is heating 
up again. Iraq claims to have shot down an enemy aircraft and says 
it will go on shooting at them if U.S. and British war planes continue 
to enforce no-fly zones in the north and south of the country. The 
U.S. Defense Department denies any of its planes were shot down after 
they attacked on Iraqi anti-aircraft site in the northern zone on 
Monday. President Clinton says the pilots fired in self-defense.
