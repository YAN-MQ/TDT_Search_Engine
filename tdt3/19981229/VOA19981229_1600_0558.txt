Iraq has sharply criticized Arab leaders for not supporting its stance 
in the confrontation with the United States and Britain. Iraq's "Al-Kedasiya" 
newspaper warned Arab leaders in an editorial that they must support 
Iraq or risk what it called the wrath of the Arab people. Deputy Prime 
Minister Tariq Aziz echoed the warning, blasting in particular Egyptian 
president, Hosni Mubarak for placing blame for the crisis on Iraq. 
Arab governments have voiced little opposition to the U.S.-led air 
strikes, although there have been widespread public protests and pro-Iraqi 
demonstrations in Arab capitals. Several attempts to convene an Arab 
summit to discuss the crisis have also failed. An Arab foreign minister's 
meeting on the air strikes has been postponed until late January.
