Tottenham has allowed new signing Steffen Freund to take a two-week 
vacation before the German international midfielder plays his first 
game in the Premier League on Jan. 9. The experienced midfielder has 
joined Spurs for 750,000 pounds (dlrs 1.25 million) and is expected 
to make his debut against Sheffield Wednesday. Spurs manager George 
Graham allowed the 28-year-old former Schalke and Borussia Dortmund 
player to go ahead with his vacation plans, which had already been 
arranged to coincide with the Bundesliga's annual mid-winter break. 
``It will be a couple of weeks before he's here but he'll soon become 
a big favorite with the fans,'' Graham said on Tuesday. ``I'm delighted 
to have signed him and he will be coming here to do what he is good 
at _ winning the ball and then passing it. ``There is great enthusiasm 
running through the side now but we still need something more to make 
sure the improvement continues,'' Graham said the day after his team 
crushed Everton 4-1 with three goals from striker Chris Armstrong. 
``It's something that the top teams like Manchester United, Arsenal 
and Chelsea all have, players who dominate the midfield and make others 
play. ``This guy has all the experience in the world with Borussia 
Dortmund in their European campaigns and with Germany as part of their 
squad in Euro 96.'' Freund, who has played 21 times for Germany, had 
to pull out of last summer's World Cup in France because of a calf 
muscle injury.
