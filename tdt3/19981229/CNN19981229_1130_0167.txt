Prosecutors will seek the death penalty for two men charged in the 
death of a gay University of Wyoming college student. The county district 
attorney filed statements yesterday of his intention to seek the death 
penalty against Aaron McKinney and Russell Henderson. The pair are 
charged with beating and robbing 21-year-old Matthew shepard, and 
leaving him to die. Shepard's death focused international attention 
on crimes against homosexuals. Shepard's accused killers will be tried 
separately. If convicted, they could die by lethal injections.
