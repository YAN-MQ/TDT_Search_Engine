The Pentagon is dismissing Baghdad's accusation that U.S. pilots initiated 
yesterday's exchange of fire over the no-fly zone in northern Iraq. 
Michael Skinner reports, U.S. military officials are releasing cockpit 
videotape to back their claim. The video begins with one member of 
the flight of four F-15e fighter bombers spotting a surface-to-air 
missile launch. The timing is critical here. The Pentagon says the 
time displayed on the instruments clearly shows Iraq fired first, 
despite Baghdad's claim to the contrary. The pilots then go over to 
the attack. The screen is split. The left side shows what the pilot 
sees as he looks out the front of his aircraft. The head-up display 
projects flight data on a clear screen in front of the cockpit. The 
right-side image is taken from the aircraft's "lantirn" laser-targeting 
pod. In this case, we're seeing what the plane's laser-guided bombs 
are aiming at. The first F-15e launched two laser-guided bombs at 
the radar and optical equipment guiding the S.A.M.S. Splash, splash. 
I'm outside. a second plane fired at the same target. So does the 
third, but, this time, the control Van, where the missile battery's 
operators work, is also hit. The fourth plane in the flight could 
not clearly identify the target and did not take part in the attack.
