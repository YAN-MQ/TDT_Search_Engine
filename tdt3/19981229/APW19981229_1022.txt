Former Senate Majority Leader George Mitchell promised Tuesday a ``thorough 
and prompt'' investigation into claims that bribes helped Salt Lake 
City win the 2002 Winter Olympic Games. Talking with reporters after 
his initial meeting with members of a special commission investigating 
the allegations, Mitchell noted that the panel has to file its report 
with the U.S. Olympic Committee by Feb. 28. Mitchell said the investigation 
would focus on the circumstances surrounding the selection of Salt 
Lake City by the International Olympic Committee. But he said ``as 
important, if not more important'' will be for the panel to make recommendations 
on improvements in the bidding process to ensure ``it is fair and 
above reproach.'' Past and present officials of the Salt Lake City 
Olympic Committee have acknowledged that they gave members of the 
international committee gifts and paid college tuition to some of 
the committee's relatives prior to the city being selected for the 
Winter Games. ``I entered this process with a completely open mind 
both as to the practices and standards which have been utilized in 
the past and those which ought to be utilized,'' he said. ``We owe 
to them (the athletes) the obligation to make certain that the games 
in which they participate are in fact and are perceived as totally 
fair and above reproach.'' The allegations also are being reviewed 
by the U.S. Justice Department. The IOC is in danger of losing a special 
tax concession worth about dlrs 1.4 million a year from the Swiss 
government because of the corruption scandal, a Swiss paper reported 
Tuesday. The exemption from the Swiss value-added tax was granted 
to the IOC by the Swiss government in September. But the lower house 
of the Swiss parliament may review that exemption late this month 
for the Lausanne-based IOC, the Geneva daily Le Temps reported. Mitchell
