"Titanic" had a gigantic year at the box office, and on the record 
charts. The success of its soundtrack, and others like it, helped 
boost CD sales 4% overall. Mark Scheerer has more. I believe that 
the heart does go on Talk about going on and on. Even though they 
came out in 1997, the sound track to "Titanic" and Celine dion's CD, 
which contained her movie song, finished one-two on top of the best-selling 
album list of 1998. Overall, CD sales were up an estimated 4% over 
last year, reversing a Recent flat trend. But, take away a one-time 
phenomenon like "Titanic" and the music biz could be singing the blues. 
As it is, they're serenading the sound track. And you can't fight 
the tears that ain't comin' Sound track albums like the fifth-ranked 
"city of Angels" were popular with consumers. Sound tracks are kind

longevity of teeny-pop idols, I have just five words for you -- new 
kids on the block. You're still the one I Kiss good night Shania Twain 
carried the country standard, while will Smith and the beastie boys 
turned in top ten hip-hop efforts. One certain thing, as the 1998 
CD sales figures are tallied -- they are celebrating at sony music 
entertainment. Thanks to "Titanic" and Celine Dion, for the first 
time in ten years, in terms of global market share, they are on top 
of the world. I'm the king of the world! Mark Scheerer, "CNN Entertainment 
News," New York.
