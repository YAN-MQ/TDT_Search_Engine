If the Rev. James Henderson has his way, the division of church and 
state in this tiny hamlet will be so narrow, a single Bible verse, 
``Love thy neighbor,'' would cover it. Henderson and some 140 other 
residents of Brooksville, an unincorporated community in northern 
Alabama, want to form a town, but not one in which mortal elected 
officials would have the power to hand out liquor licenses, levy taxes 
and rezone land for strip malls and industrial parks. Instead, Henderson 
said, they want a town guided by the hand of God. The King James Bible 
would be the town charter, the Ten Commandments, its ordinances. The 
people who live here would look out for one another, would look in 
on the elderly, would watch for children in the crosswalk. They would 
not buy or sell alcohol or pornography. They would not steal. They 
would vote _ every woman and man _ in the churches instead of a city 
hall, but there would probably not be many votes because the aim of 
the town would be to preserve the slow life that exists here, not 
mess it up with change, said those in favor of this Bible-based town. 
Henderson, a self-described street preacher who was born in Brooksville 
56 years ago, knows that he is describing what he considers an ideal 
community, an almost impossible utopia. But at least, he said, it 
would be a place founded on Christian ideals, on standards of common 
decency. ``A standard we would hope everybody would live by,'' he 
said. ``It's so basic. When I was a child in the 1940s and 1950s, 
we had a sense of community, built around the church, on people helping 
each other. Over the years, that's gotten frayed around the edges. 
I've watched the issue of the separation of church and state get out 
of control. ``What we are trying to do, with this little country crossroads, 
is bring together the church and state. We want to make life make 
sense again, for people.'' If there is any opposition to such a town, 
it has been silent, as Henderson and a small group of Brooksville 
residents go about collecting the signatures on a petition needed 
to put the decision of incorporation as a Bible-based town to a vote. 
An election on incorporation may come as soon as February, said Hubert 
Porter, 62, an engineer and one of those who favor a Bible-based charter. 
Experts on incorporation, including those at the Alabama League of 
Municipalities, have said there are many practical barriers to such 
a town, since state laws on incorporation require a town to have a 
mayor, and that issues be decided by a council vote. Henderson has 
suggested that most issues can be decided by a simple show of hands 
in meetings held in church sanctuaries. There would be no need to 
spend money on municipal buildings, because residents would not have 
to obtain building permits or such things from the city. Even those 
who favor a Bible-based charter can see there are a lot of problems 
to be worked out, including the legality of such a move. The Brooksville 
community includes 600 people at the most _ probably as few as 400, 
residents said _ and encompasses only about four square miles. Mostly 
Baptist, and mostly white, it is a mix of blue-collar and white-collar 
workers, farmers, school teachers and retirees from Decatur and Huntsville. 
It is a hamlet clinging to the remnants _ some would say the myths 
_ of the unspoiled Southern community, a place where children chase 
fireflies through yards in the summers and people still wave when 
they drive past. But on Highway 67, the strip malls are creeping closer, 
and surrounding cities like Priceville have already annexed parts 
of the community. ``We're in a strange situation,'' Porter said. ``We're 
not looking for growth, for industry. We're not looking for Wal-Marts. 
We like our atmosphere and our community and we want to keep it that 
way.'' Sinners and nonbelievers would not be excluded from this town, 
he said, but they would be expected to abide by its laws even if they 
did not embrace the religion behind them. Henderson said he will try 
to turn them to the Lord, as any evangelical minister would. ``It's 
another pulpit,'' Henderson said. ``Jesus said he loves the sinner 
but hates the sin. My whole approach is to get them into the Kingdom, 
and it doesn't matter if they're adulterers or homosexuals or atheists 
or what.'' The would-be town already has a sign, propped up on Highway 
67. Underneath big red and blue letters that say ``Brooksville Welcomes 
You'' is a verse from Matthew 18:20: ``... where two or three are 
gathered together in my name there am I in the midst of them.'' The 
proponents of a Bible-based town said the concept was not intended 
to exclude anyone, but was a return to the spirit of this country's 
founding fathers. ``You can live with Christian principles anywhere 
in the world, and there's not a country in the world that has embraced 
freedom that has not embraced Christianity first,'' Porter said. ``We're 
not trying to make anybody Baptist or Methodist. Just live by Christian 
principles. ``We've already had calls from people wanting to come 
in, wanting to move here,'' Porter said. Residents could do what they 
like with their property, said the hamlet's residents who support 
incorporation, just as long as they live according to the Bible's 
teachings. Instead of financing a police force, residents would form 
a strong neighborhood watch, Porter said. ``We want to look after 
each other,'' he said, ``protect our own property and lives.''
