Did Einstein know such humiliation? Would Galileo sit still for this? 
Probably not, but Sam Dordoni, inventor of the gravity-powered people-moving 
vehicle _ something like a perpetual motion machine _ is stuck. His 
problem? His machine, which at first blush appears to overcome the 
laws of physics, has been unable to overcome the laws of New York 
City parking, and it is going nowhere fast. ``My dignity won't stand 
for this,'' said Dordoni, a 51-year-old mechanic, truck driver and 
bearded visionary from Watkins Glen, N.Y., who has spent 20 years 
developing his device, the Gravtran. Pelted by a cold rain, he mused 
about his predicament on Tuesday across the street from the memorial 
arch in Washington Square Park, where he has been day and night, protecting 
his contribution to 21st century technology, since Dec. 7. Designed 
as a small tram or shuttle bus system best suited to airports, stadiums, 
shopping malls or other congested hubs of human activity, the Gravtran 
uses simple gravity _ no fuel whatsoever _ to propel people down slightly 
declining tracks or monorails. ``It is not as though I'm pushing some 
kind of newfangled mouse trap here,'' Dordoni said. ``This is something 
that can benefit millions of people around the world, but I've got 
to get moving.'' The stationary fate of his Gravtran prototype is, 
perhaps, a cautionary tale of a grand idea gone awry, or of how pesky 
little annoyances like no-parking signs and a Police Department tow 
truck can alter the course of human progress. Dordoni, whose gravelly 
voice, cowboy hat and slightly bloodshot eyes offer only brief distractions 
from his imposing command of mechanical engineering, is by no means 
short on public support for his invention. Without a patent, corporate 
support or government grants, he has been pursuing publicity and financial 
backing aggressively, particularly in New York City, for more than 
a year. In a seemingly triumphant tour of Manhattan in December 1997, 
he towed the Gravtran behind a gleaming new Chevy pickup from Times 
Square, where he attracted film crews from MTV, to the Metropolitan 
Museum of Art, attracting crowds of curious onlookers. But Dordoni's 
dream turned sour when he and his people-mover, again powered by his 
pickup, returned to Manhattan a month ago. As luck would have it, 
he had been issued three $115 parking tickets during the 1997 tour. 
With interest and penalties, that left him with a bill to the city 
of $364.29 by the time his truck was towed on Dec. 7, leaving the 
Gravtran itself parked on Washington Square North near Fifth Avenue. 
Now, as the late December nights turn frigid inside his unheated Gravtran, 
he has been forced to accept contributions of food, blankets and warm 
clothing from students and faculty members at New York University. 
``In some ways it has been a blessing to be here because of the unbelievable 
wealth of people who pass by,'' he said. Parked by a curb that is 
often thronged by students and professors, he said he had fielded 
hundreds of questions about his invention, and had often been overwhelmed 
by people peering inside the vehicle. Although he has not been robbed 
or accosted _ even when he has left the Gravtran to use a public telephone 
and bathroom in Washington Square Park _ he said he has had to face 
the occasional annoyance of students looking in late at night. All 
that, it might seem, is serving one of Dordoni's objectives _ public 
attention. But he scoffs at any suggestion that his ordeal of 22 days 
and nights has been staged as a publicity stunt. ``Sure I want publicity, 
but not fame, and this is all just getting in the way,'' he said. 
More to the point, he insisted, are the opportunities he is missing 
to show his invention off elsewhere in Manhattan, Connecticut and 
other parts of the region. For now, sleeping in conditions that he 
compared to the inside of a refrigerator, he said his sole intention 
was to move on. Although he has no money to pay for assistance, he 
said he could offer the potentially lucrative, or worthless, alternative 
of stock in a company that he hopes to form to market his dream of 
gravity-powered travel. ``All I need at this point is somebody to 
pull up with a pickup truck and haul me away,'' he said. ``Once that 
happens, I'm on my way.''
