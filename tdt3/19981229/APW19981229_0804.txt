The IOC is in danger of losing a special tax concession worth 2 million 
Swiss francs (dlrs 1.46) a year as a result of the Olympic corruption 
scandal, a Swiss newspaper reported Tuesday. The exemption from value-added 
tax (VAT) was granted to the International Olympic Committee by the 
Swiss government in September, nearly four years after the Lausanne-based 
IOC requested it. Switzerland has exempted the IOC from direct federal 
tax since 1981 due to its public service aims. Value-added tax came 
into force at the beginning of 1995. But the VAT exemption, approved 
by the upper house of parliament, could run into difficulties when 
the tax is reviewed by a commission of the lower house Jan. 25, the 
Geneva daily Le Temps reported. The IOC has come under intense scrutiny 
in the light of the bribery allegations surrounding Salt Lake City's 
successful bid for the 2002 Winter Olympics. Salt Lake officials have 
admitted that six relatives of IOC members were among those who benefited 
from nearly dlrs 400,000 in scholarship aid from the bid committee. 
There is growing evidence of other favors for IOC members, including 
free medical care and gifts in excess of the dlrs 150 limit. IOC executive 
board member Marc Hodler has alleged that other Olympic votes were 
tainted by corruption and claimed that 5 to 7 percent of IOC members 
are open to bribes. Some Swiss lawmakers are undecided on the VAT 
exemption, according to Le Temps. ``(IOC president Juan Antonio) Samaranch 
and his colleagues must put things in order to stop the fiddling,'' 
commission member Jean-Pierre Bonny was quoted as saying. Another 
lawmaker, Jean-Michel Gros, said he ``expects explanations.'' IOC 
director general Francois Carrard said he is confident the IOC's efforts 
``will convince all those who see us objectively.'' The Swiss government 
said in September the IOC's presence in the country is worth some 
100 million francs (dlrs 73 million) per year to the economy.
