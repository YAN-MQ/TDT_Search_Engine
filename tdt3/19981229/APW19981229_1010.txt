Four Westerners held hostage by militant Islamic tribesmen were killed 
on Tuesday as Yemeni security forces stormed their hideout. A statement 
issued by Yemen's Interior Ministry said that the kidnappers killed 
three of the captives and that a fourth, who was wounded in the incident, 
died later in hospital. In London, British Foreign Secretary Robin 
Cook said the dead included three British hostages and an Australian.
