We had another very good day with the Dow Jones Industrial Average 
closing at 9320. That was up 94 points or one percent. Standard & 
Poor's 500 Index closed at a record high 1241. That was up 16 points. 
The NASDAQ index also closed at a record high. The industrial average 
set a record for the year by closing up for eight consecutive sessions, 
and the industrial average is now just 54 points below its record 
high of 9374, which was set just about a month ago.
