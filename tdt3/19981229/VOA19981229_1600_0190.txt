Two senior Khmer Rouge leaders have apologized for their rebel faction's 
murderous reign of terror in the late 1970s. Khu Samfon and Nuon Chia 
said they were sorry at a news conference in Phnom Penh Tuesday after 
meeting with Prime Minister Hun Sen. The two guerrilla leaders defected 
to the government last weekend.
