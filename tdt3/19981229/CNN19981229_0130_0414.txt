Doctors say four of the Texas octuplets are breathing on their own. 
The others are on ventilators. The youngest boy, gorom, is recovering 
from abdominal surgery. All seven are considered in stable but critical 
condition. The hospital estimates care for the babies will cost nearly 
$2 million over the next few months. The smallest baby, a girl, died 
yesterday morning. Their parents are thanking people all over the 
world for their prayers.
