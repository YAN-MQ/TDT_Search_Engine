Benjamin Netanyahu's rivals for the prime ministership on Tuesday 
openly sought to poach his ministers, present and past _ bold forays 
into Netanyahu's power base that underscored the threat he faces heading 
into elections. Labor Party leader Ehud Barak exchanged compliments 
with David Levy, the head of the Gesher party, and Netanyahu's first 
foreign minister. Amnon Shahak, a former military chief-of-staff likely 
to head a centrist party, said he hoped to recruit two current ministers 
known to be unhappy with Netanyahu's leadership. And in another blow, 
his closest political ally, Foreign Minister Ariel Sharon, said he 
hasn't ruled out running for the premier's post. Parliament's Law 
Committee on Tuesday approved May 17 as the date for new elections, 
more than a year ahead of schedule. Netanyahu faces a growing field 
of challengers, including members of his own Likud Party who either 
seek to wrest the party's nomination from him or plan to run on their 
own slate. With five candidates already in the race and Shahak expected 
to announce his bid next week, it is unlikely the elections will be 
determined in the first round. If no candidate wins more than 50 percent, 
a runoff will be held June 1. Shahak _ almost certain to partner with 
another Likud defector, Dan Meridor _ said he would welcome Defense 
Minister Yitzhak Mordechai and Communications Minister Limor Livnat 
to their nascent centrist party. ``I'd be happy to see people like 
Yitzhak Mordechai and Limor Livnat,'' Shahak, who leads Netanyahu 
and Barak in the polls, told Channel Two news. ``I'd be happy to see 
anyone who's ready to go together with the goals we will agree upon 
together.'' Livnat has already met with Meridor, and Mordechai is 
known to be unhappy with Netanyahu's decision to freeze the accords 
with the Palestinians negotiated at Wye River, Maryland in October. 
Israel Television reported that Mordechai was in ``intensive contact'' 
with Labor leader Barak. Levy, who left Netanyahu's government in 
January 1998 because of his unhappiness over social policy and the 
slow pace of Mideast peacemaking, said he admired Barak's emphasis 
on social issues. ``He is the only one who talks about these (social) 
issues and presents a new set of priorities,'' he said after meeting 
with Barak. Labor legislators said their party was Levy's natural 
home. ``He has a warm place in our hearts,'' Dalia Itzik said. Netanyahu 
on Tuesday prayed at the Western Wall, Judaism's holiest site, and 
struck a theme that helped him win in 1996 _ a pledge to keep Jerusalem 
united. ``I draw my strength from generations of Jews who dreamed 
of returning to this place and staying here,'' Netanyahu said. ``And 
this is the major battle that we're fighting right now,'' listing 
settlement projects that the Palestinians say violate the Wye accords. 
Sharon's acknowledgment on Monday evening that he was considering 
a bid for prime minister came as a surprise. On Sunday, he had told 
Likud's Central Committee that he did ``not want to be prime minister.'' 
Less than 24 hours later, he said on a TV talk show that under certain 
circumstances, he might enter the race. ``There is a difference between 
`I don't want to be prime minister' and running under special circumstances,'' 
Sharon said. Asked to elaborate on Tuesday, Sharon told reporters: 
``Use your head and you'll understand.'' There was speculation he 
could enter the race if Netanyahu's popularity drops or key leaders 
abandon the Likud party. Sharon resigned as defense minister in 1983 
after he was held indirectly responsible for the massacre of hundreds 
of Palestinians during Israel's military offensive to chase PLO guerrillas 
out of Lebanon.
