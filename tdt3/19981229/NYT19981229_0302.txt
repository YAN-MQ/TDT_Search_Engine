The concept for the new hourlong HBO series ``The Sopranos'' sounds 
simple enough: An upwardly mobile Mafia capo from northern New Jersey 
slams head-on into a midlife crisis, enters therapy and starts taking 
Prozac. Funny? Sometimes. Scary? Sure. Human? Very. But simple? No. 
It's about as simple as trying to dispose of a fresh corpse in the 
Meadowlands after dark when the lip of the construction trash bin 
is just too high to reach. ``I was looking for the notion that life 
is so complex now that even a wise guy needs help sorting it out,'' 
says David Chase, the creator, writer and co-executive producer of 
the series. ``Plus, the mob as we know it has taken some pretty heavy 
hits from law enforcement. On a realistic level, who's to say that 
a man involved in this wouldn't be feeling tremendous pressure?'' 
That man is Tony Soprano (James Gandolfini), and for 13 weeks, starting 
with the show's premiere next Sunday night, the stress of heading 
two families, the one he lives with and the one he works with, is 
bared to his psychiatrist and the eavesdropping television audience. 
The audience sees Tony in all his many guises, including the inner 
Tony, a man not fully understood by his wife, his girlfriend, his 
passive-aggressive mother or his two teen-age children. She is Dr. 
Jennifer Melfi, a new kind of role for Lorraine Bracco, one of the 
movie screen's more famous mob wives. (Ms. Bracco portrayed Karen 
Hill, wife of the mobster Henry Hill in ``Goodfellas.'') Having lived 
through Mafia home life, Ms. Bracco suddenly finds herself in designer 
suits and eyeglasses, asking questions like ``How does that make you 
feel?'' In preparation, she said, she thumbed through books with titles 
like ``Going Sane,'' ``Sexual Feelings in Psychotherapy,'' ``The Intimate 
Hour'' and ``The Drama of the Gifted Child.'' Tony is a gifted child? 
``Of course he's gifted,'' Ms. Bracco fairly shouted. ``It's heartbreaking,'' 
she said. ``How could you not like a man who is searching to do the 
right thing? It's `Father Knows Best' for the millennium. Tony comes 
to me with these mother issues, a powerful grown man crying about 
not knowing what to do.'' His wife and his daughter are at each other's 
throats and his mother, Livia (Nancy Marchand in a startling departure 
from her famous WASP roles), dispenses guilt with the skill that comes 
only from generations of genetic honing. How can any therapist possibly 
break through? Tony is a guy. A big Italian guy. He has big cars and 
a big white modern suburban house with a circular drive and a big 
in-ground pool, plenty of money (cash, usually) and more on the way. 
Then comes the panic attack, and he ends up on the couch. ``Lately 
I get the feeling that I came in at the end,'' he tells Dr. Melfi, 
speaking of his work, his life, the really important challenges that 
confronted his father's generation. ``The best is over.'' ``Are you 
depressed?'' Dr. Melfi asks. Tony demurs, then fumes. ``Whatever happened 
to Gary Cooper, the strong silent type?'' he says. ``That was an American. 
He wasn't in touch with his feelings. He just did what he had to do. 
See, what they didn't know is that once they got Gary Cooper in touch 
with his feelings they couldn't get him to shut up. It's dysfunction 
this, dysfunction that.'' As for Tony's ostensible career as a ``waste 
management consultant,'' Dr. Melfi is cautious. As her patient starts 
to explain the stress of a recent business transaction _ ``We saw 
this guy and there was this issue of an outstanding loan'' _ Dr. Melfi 
interrupts to point out that anything discussed in her office is private, 
but that if he were to reveal something about, say, a murder, she 
would be obliged to go to the authorities. ``I don't know what happened 
with this fellow,'' Dr. Melfi starts to say, but then Tony breaks 
in with a sincere smile. ``Nothing,'' he says, pausing. ``We had coffee.'' 
At which point the camera leaves Tony's face and refocuses on an office 
park in Paramus, N.J., where the delinquent debtor, having spotted 
Tony, drops his tray of takeout coffee and tries unsuccessfully to 
escape Tony's fists and feet. All in a day's work, which frequently 
provides evidence of Tony's tough _ even inventive _ side. At one 
point, he assaults another wise guy, using a staple gun to fasten 
the man's jacket to his chest. For Dr. Melfi, the brutal Tony is not 
such a big issue. ``Look, I can only approach it in a way that is 
best for him clinically, medically,'' Ms. Bracco said. ``Getting into 
a discussion of stapling the guy's suit to him is not going to help 
me crack his psyche open to see the good and evil.'' Ms. Bracco originally 
read not for this quiet, contemplative part, but for Carmela, Tony's 
wife, played by Edie Falco. ``Actors, we want roles that chew the 
scenery up,'' Ms. Bracco said. ``But I was interested in a character 
no one has given me before. She's so controlled. She's a blank wall. 
This is almost like not speaking. ``She's not just a psychiatrist, 
she's from the neighborhood, you know? How many many Italian-American 
educated women have you seen on screen?'' Ms. Bracco grew up in Brooklyn, 
N.Y.; her ``big, powerful Italian father'' worked at the Fulton Fish 
Market. As Dr. Melfi, she reins in the street-corner Brooklyn dialect 
that is her customary way of chatting. Which leads to the question 
of Italians and stereotyping, and whether ``The Sopranos'' is likely 
to come in for some criticism. Chase, the creator, whose family name 
was originally DeCesare, and the HBO-Brillstein Grey Entertainment 
production team see no problem. Neither do the cast members, almost 
all of whom are Italian-Americans from the New York-New Jersey area. 
Chase grew up in North Caldwell, N.J., where the Sopranos live, and 
insisted on filming the show at locations throughout northern New 
Jersey. Gandolfini called the show an ``equal opportunity drama.'' 
``Certain things lend themselves to drama,'' he said. ``It didn't 
bother me at all. I think people are ready for a certain lack of political 
correctness. We do things with some respect.'' It also appears to 
be true to mob life in the '90s and the notion that art imitates life 
imitating art; that is, today's gangsters like to model themselves 
after their screen idols. The series is peppered with overused epigrams 
from Hollywood mob melodramas. In the scene in which Christopher (Michael 
Imperioli) and his partner (Vincent Pastore) try to dispose of a body 
in the Meadowlands, Christopher intones, ``Louis Brasi sleeps with 
the fishes.'' ``Luca Brasi, Luca, Christopher,'' the partner corrects. 
Celebrating a big cash haul at Newark International Airport, another 
crew member, Paulie (Tony Sirico), invokes Edward G. Robinson when 
he exults dramatically but pointlessly, ``Is this the end of Little 
Rico?'' And crew members analyzing a recent rub-out ruminate on the 
significance of killing someone by shooting him in the eye. Citing 
primary source material, they discuss the death of the casino owner 
Moe Green in ``The Godfather.'' ``It's so funny because it's so real,'' 
said Chris Albrecht, president of HBO Original Programming. ``These 
characters are all completely relatable. The only difference between 
Tony Soprano and me is that he's a mob boss.'' Is Tony Soprano any 
different from the Wall Street sharks who live down the block? Perhaps 
only in that he carries a .45 and they don't. ``I understand him,'' 
said Gandolfini, who grew up in Park Ridge, in North Jersey. ``He 
can be brutal and compassionate. I think that people who have a lot 
of compassion also have a lot of anger. With some people the anger 
gets stuck.'' Yet the compassionate side is often within reach. In 
midseries, Tony and his 17-year-old daughter, Meadow, drive to Maine 
to visit colleges. Cruising along in the family's light-gray Lincoln, 
a pensive Meadow suddenly turns to her father and asks, ``Are you 
in the Mafia?'' ``Am I in the what?'' Tony says. ``That's total crap 
_ who told you that? That's a stereotype, and it's offensive. I'm 
in the waste management business. Everybody immediately assumes you're 
mobbed up. There is no Mafia.'' But Tony's practiced lying is momentary, 
and he relents with one of the few people in the world he loves unconditionally. 
``Look,'' he says, ``some of my money comes from illegal gambling 
and whatnot.'' A pause. ``How does that make you feel?'' ``Sometimes,'' 
Meadow says wistfully, ``I wish you were like other dads.'' But she 
has already inherited the Soprano coyness. She just needed to hear 
it from him. Later, at dinner, the conversation continues, and in 
a single moment, with his daughter's face shining in the candlelight 
of a restaurant, Tony the son, Tony the father and Tony the striver 
merge to confront the newly self-absorbed Tony. ``My father was in 
it, my uncle was in it,'' he says. ``There was a time there when the 
Italian people didn't have a lot of options.'' ``Maybe,'' he adds, 
``being a rebel in my family would have been selling patio furniture 
on Route 22.''
