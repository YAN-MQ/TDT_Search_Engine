Cypress authorities have decided against deploying Russian-made surface-to-air 
missiles on the divided island and instead plan to install them on 
the Greek island of Crete. Cypress president, Glafkos Clerides, says 
his government will open talks with the Russians on the new deployment 
sites. Cypress has insisted the deployment is purely defensive, citing 
the presence of thousands of Turkish troops still on the island. But 
many western countries have opposed the deployment, while Turkey threatened 
to use all possible means to block it.
