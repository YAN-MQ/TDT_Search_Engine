Russia on Tuesday failed to make a $362 million payment on Soviet-era 
debt that it owes to commercial banks around the world, a move that 
U.S. officials, the International Monetary Fund and lenders to Russia 
fear could signal a growing movement in Moscow to simply default on 
the country's obligations. The lenders, led by Bank of America, stopped 
short of calling Tuesday's action a default, even though it appeared 
to be exactly that. In August, in the midst of the devaluation of 
the ruble and the firing of the economic reformers who had negotiated 
a bailout of the country with the International Monetary Fund, Russia 
failed to pay hundreds of millions of dollars it owed to foreign governments. 
But Tuesday's action was the first in which it failed to pay private 
creditors, on whom the country's chances of economic recovery hinge. 
Russia needed to reach agreement with 95 percent of its creditors 
to restructure its debt, essentially allowing it to pay the money 
back over a far longer period of time. But only 72 percent of those 
creditors gave approval to a plan under which the commercial banks 
would accept government-issued bonds as an alternative to cash. Russia 
insists that it only needed to win the approval of two-thirds of the 
creditors, and therefore it is not technically in default. ``Officially, 
the issue of default does not exist at this point,'' Vladimir Yatsenko, 
an aide to the chairman of Vnesheconombank, Russia's paying agent, 
was quoted as saying in a Bloomberg News dispatch from Moscow. Bank 
of America said through a spokesman that it was seeking clarification 
of Yatsenko's reported statement but that the 95 percent approval 
requirement from creditors remained unchanged. The payment itself 
is not a major problem for the banks, and the markets had long ago 
anticipated that Russia would find itself unable to pay, or simply 
would be unwilling to do so. But the signal that Russia's action sent 
seems bound to reverberate in capitals around the world, especially 
in Washington. International economic officials said they suspected 
that Russia had decided to simply default on selected foreign debt. 
``The question,'' said one official who has been engaged in discussions 
with the Russians, ``is whether this is an act of desperation or a 
negotiating tactic.'' One possibility is that the government of President 
Boris Yeltsin has determined that there is little chance that private 
banks will lend it money for years to come, even if Russia begins 
to collect taxes, impose fiscal austerity, and come to terms with 
the IMF over a new loan package. With no relationship left to destroy 
with the commercial banks, this theory goes, the Russians have simply 
made a determination to halt repayments. But others believe that the 
default may simply amount to a negotiating strategy, to force the 
banks to restructure the debt on Moscow's terms. ``This may be their 
equivalent of an offer we can't refuse,'' one banker dealing with 
Russia said last week. ``They want us to think that the choice is 
between getting something _ who knows how much _ someday, or getting 
nothing at all.'' The Russians have been engaged in a parallel negotiation 
with other governments to which it owes money, a group known as the 
Paris Club. But that debt cannot be restructured until Russia and 
the IMF work out a new agreement, to replace the failed accord of 
last July. At that time, the IMF agreed to provide Russia with $17 
billion in additional aid, in return for adherence to a strict agreement 
with the fund on spending, tax collection and social programs. That 
agreement was essentially shattered in August, after Russia received 
a little more than $4 billion in aid. The IMF has cut off further 
payments, and the assumption in Washington is that any future agreement 
with the fund will be smaller and more ``backloaded,'' meaning that 
Russia would have to meet many of the conditions of the new loan before 
much cash is forwarded to Moscow. Tuesday's failure to meet the payment 
schedule came as the Clinton administration announced that the secretary 
of state, Madeleine Albright, would visit Russia from Jan. 25 through 
Jan. 27, to launch long-delayed strategic arms reduction talks and 
to try to patch over differences on how to deal with Iraq. But it 
is unclear how the United States and Russia can begin arms talks over 
Start III when the Duma, Russia's Parliament, has refused to ratify 
Start II. The arms talks and Russia's economic troubles are closely 
linked. Prime Minister Yevgeny Primakov has pledged to win approval 
on Start II, which was signed in 1993, in part because he wants to 
save the money required to maintain and upgrade a large nuclear fleet. 
But it is unclear whether Albright will deal at any length with Russia's 
crushing financial problems.
