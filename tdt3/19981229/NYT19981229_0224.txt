If you haven't already read the best seller and haven't yet caught 
the new hit movie, you can get up to speed on ``A Civil Action'' with 
Wednesday night's hourlong television version of the dramatic case 
that set off the media blitz. Beginning with the suspicions of a few 
parents in the small town of Woburn, Mass., near Boston, that the 
leukemia from which their children suffered and died was caused by 
tainted water, this edition of ``American Justice'' turns to the fight 
by a team of lawyers to win what they hoped would be a billion-dollar 
judgment against two Fortune 500 companies, W.R. Grace and Beatrice 
Foods. One mother says, ``The only thing industry understands is money.'' 
The focus here is on Jan Schlictmann (appearing in the program, but 
played in the movie by John Travolta), described as a flamboyant ``high-stakes 
player'' who took on the suit in the early 1980s and pursued it for 
almost a decade with the prospect of bringing justice to the families 
and making a killing for his firm, which would take a third of any 
settlement. ``This was war, not litigation,'' announces Schlictmann 
of the bitter courtroom struggle that finally drove him into penury. 
As A&AMP;E's ubiquitous narrator, Bill Kurtis, explains matters, the 
plaintiffs had to prove two elements: that the drinking water was 
contaminated by the companies and that the contamination caused the 
leukemia. The critical early decision by the judge, Walter Skinner, 
to postpone the parents' moving testimony until those questions of 
fact were resolved lest the jury's judgment be overwhelmed by sympathy 
deprived the plaintiffs of their most potent weapon. It becomes evident 
from the program that no love was lost between Skinner and Schlictmann, 
whose attacks an opposing lawyer calls ``scurrilous.'' In an interview, 
the judge admits to a certain impatience with what some saw as the 
lawyer's flirtation with paranoia. Despite the occasional slip into 
cliche (``tragedy struck again''), this is a well-reported hour that 
brings together inestimable personal loss, big-money legal wranglings 
and courtroom antipathies. An epilogue tells of belated orders for 
cleanups of the polluted areas. For what comfort that can offer the 
stricken parents and the bankrupt lawyers, Kurtis says, ``By losing 
the battle, the plaintiffs may have won the war.'' PRODUCTION NOTES:
