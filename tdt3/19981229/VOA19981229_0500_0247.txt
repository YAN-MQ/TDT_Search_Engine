Khmer Rouge senior leader accused Khu Sam Pon says only the Cambodian 
people can decide if he should be tried for crimes against humanity. 
The rebel leader spoke to reporters Tuesday in Phnom Penh where he 
and fellow rebel, Neyon Chee, were greeted by Prime Minister Hun Sen. 
Reporter Hugh Watkin in Phnom Penh says there are mixed feelings about 
the two men being received so warmly when others are calling for their 
trial on charges of genocide. It is certainly an extraordinary turn 
of events. Let's not forget that just 19 months or so ago in July 
1997, the streets of Phnom Penh erupted in very fierce tank battles, 
and Hun Sen justified that military action in saying that the Khmer 
Rouge were coming back to Phnom Penh, and yet now we see these two 
very senior leaders of which this would appear is a lot of documentary 
evidence and witness testimonies which clearly implicate these guys 
in command responsibility for the deaths of close to two million people. 
So it's really a remarkable turn of events which has long-term Cambodia 
observers, foreign diplomats, and indeed the Cambodians themselves 
both confused and I think quite angry. In Phnom Penh, reporter Hugh 
Watkin. The two men arrived in the capital earlier Tuesday from the 
former Northern Khmer Rouge stronghold of Paylin, where they had been 
staying since their surrender to the government last week.
