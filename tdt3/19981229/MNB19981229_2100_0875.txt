New pictures to show you tonight but no new activity to report from 
today, at least in the skies over Iraq. Bad weather kept U.S. and 
British warplanes out of the northern fly zone over Iraq today but 
the jets continued their patrol as usual over the southern no-fly 
zone. This as Iraq threatened to shoot down still American aircraft 
they spot. Iraq's vice president said today "the war is still on." 
Now earlier today the Pentagon provided nose cone videotape of an 
attack on a missile location. Splash. Splash. The video taken from 
a front-mounted camera onboard one of the American f-16 fighter bombers 
that carried out yesterday's attacks.
