With Russia and Belarus signaling a new union, Poland finds itself 
once again on the border of Europe's East-West division. But Polish 
officials said Tuesday they don't worry about the Moscow-Minsk agreement 
signed last week because both countries are weak and Poland's upcoming 
membership in NATO means security against instability from the east. 
Russian President Boris Yeltsin and his Belarusian counterpart, Alexander 
Lukashenko, signed a deal Friday that could lead to the former Soviet 
republics becoming a single state _ with a single currency, parliament 
and military. The announcement came as Poland continued final preparations 
to join the Czech Republic and Hungary in becoming the first former 
Soviet bloc countries to gain NATO membership, perhaps as soon as 
March. That means Poland would form the NATO border with the new Russia-Belarus 
state, if the union makes it through the necessary legislative and 
political processes. Most Polish government officials said the economic 
hardships and historical ties between Russia and Belarus made such 
an arrangement likely as former Soviet states continue to struggle 
almost eight years after the breakup of the Soviet Union. ``The move 
is not a surprise,'' said Foreign Ministry spokesman Pawel Dobrowolski. 
He noted Lukashenko and Yeltsin signed similar agreements in the past 
that called for harmonizing their policies, with little effect. ``This 
is going to take time. Perhaps we will have it some day, but this 
is not a threat,'' Dobrowolski said. Poland will be the only NATO 
member that borders both Russia and Belarus, which both have warned 
NATO expansion to the Bug river on Poland's eastern frontier could 
lead to a new East-West division. ``It is not a threat for Poland, 
we hope,'' government spokesman Jaroslaw Sellin said of the Russia-Belarus 
pact. ``In NATO, Poland will feel secure and this is why we are joining 
this pact.'' Some Polish officials hinted that the Russia-Belarus 
pact could be in response to the NATO expansion. ``We can assume that 
everybody is taking part in some kind of integration in Europe, and 
hence the Belarusian idea for integration with Russia,'' Dobrowolski 
said. He stressed that the initiative came from Lukashenko, known 
for his authoritarian rule in Belarus and admiration for the former 
Soviet Union. Stefan Niesiolowski, a leader of Poland's ruling, anti-communist 
Solidarity movement, said the deal may reflect a longing for the old 
Soviet Union among politicians and ordinary people in Russia and Belarus. 
``This is a bad move for us, because it means reconstructing the Soviet 
Union to some extent,'' Niesiolowski said, adding that Soviet rule 
sought to dominate eastern Europe until its collapse in 1991. ``I 
hope that as a NATO member, we will be secure.'' In Polish newspapers, 
editorials and commentators noted that Russia and Belarus had differing 
and basically incompatible systems _ Russia being a democracy implementing 
free market reforms, while Belarus maintained a communist-style economy. 
``As long as those differences exist, further reunification will remain 
on paper,'' the Polityka weekly newspaper said in an editorial Tuesday.
