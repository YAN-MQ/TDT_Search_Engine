Authorities in Tennessee have rounded up all six inmates who escaped 
from a Maximum security prison near Nashville. Two of them, these 
two, were captured this morning. They were found near a lumberyard 
just a few miles from riverbend maximum security prison on the outskirts 
of Nashville. Six inmates overpowered prison guards yesterday morning. 
Three of them were caught before the night was over. And 24-year-old 
Aaron Tyrone James was found in a crawlspace beneath a Nashville home 
this afternoon. Police believe he had been drinking with friends at 
the house the night before. He is serving a 50-year sentence for second-degree 
murder, kidnapping and robbery.
