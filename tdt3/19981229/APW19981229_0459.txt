Public support for Hong Kong's leader, Tung Chee-hwa, has slipped 
to its lowest level since he took over after the former British colony 
reverted to Chinese rule last July, according to an opinion poll released 
Tuesday. Tung's support rating fell to an average 57.6 points for 
1998, down from an average of 62.3 points last year, according to 
Hong Kong University's Social Science Research Center The poll was 
conducted through telephone interviews of more than 500 people every 
two weeks. It had a margin of error of 1 point, or 2 percent. Tung, 
a former shipping magnate, took over as Chief Executive on July 1 
after the departure of Hong Kong's last British governor, Chris Patten. 
Tung has increasingly come under fire for not doing enough to help 
Hong Kong out of its protracted economic recession. Late Tuesday, 
the government announced that gross domestic product fell by 7.1 percent 
for the three months ending Sept. 30. Hong Kong showed its worst quarterly 
economic performance since 1973, the first year when officials began 
measuring such statistics.
