In college basketball, Connecticut and Duke have held on to the top 
two spots in the latest Associated Press poll for the third week in 
a row. The undefeated Yukon Huskies beat Fairfield by 35 points in 
their only game last week to receive 63 of 70 first place votes from 
a panel of national media. Duke beat Kentucky 71 to 60 last week to 
claim six number one votes in second place. Cincinnati moved up one 
spot to number three after wins over Houston and Dayton. That's the 
highest ranking for the Bear Cats since they were number one early 
in the 1996 and '97 season. Maryland and Stanford each moved up one 
place to fourth and fifth, while Arizona moved up two spots to number 
six, Kentucky drops to seven, followed by Indiana, North Carolina, 
and UCLA.
