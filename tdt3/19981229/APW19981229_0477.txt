In a new blow to Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, his closest political 
ally, Foreign Minister Ariel Sharon, said he hasn't ruled out running 
for the premier's post. Parliament's Law Committee on Tuesday approved 
May 17 as the date for new elections, more than a year ahead of schedule. 
Netanyahu faces a growing field of challengers, including members 
of his own Likud Party who either seek to wrest the party's nomination 
from him or plan to run on their own slate. With five candidates already 
in the race and popular former armed forces chief of staff Amnon Shahak 
expected to announce his bid next week, it is unlikely the elections 
will be determined in the first round. If no candidate wins more than 
50 percent, a runoff will be held June 1. In what looked like his 
first campaign stop, Netanyahu on Tuesday prayed at the Western Wall, 
Judaism's holiest site, and struck a theme that helped him win in 
1996 _ a pledge to keep Jerusalem united. At the time, Netanyahu accused 
incumbent Prime Minister Shimon Peres of making too many concessions 
to the Palestinians who hope to set up a future capital in east Jerusalem, 
the sector Israel captured from Jordan in the 1967 Mideast war. Netanyahu's 
campaign used the slogan ``Peres will divide Jerusalem,'' which was 
credited with helping the opposition leader narrowly defeat Peres. 
At the Wall on Tuesday, Netanyahu said Jews have been struggling for 
centuries to regain control over Jerusalem and keep the city united. 
``This is very much the struggle we are engaged in now,'' he said. 
Sharon's acknowledgment on Monday evening that he was considering 
a bid for prime minister came as a surprise. Only on Sunday, he had 
told Likud's Central Committee that he did ``not want to be prime 
minister.'' Less than 24 hours later, he said on a TV talk show that 
under certain circumstances, he might enter the race. ``There is a 
difference between `I don't want to be prime minister' and running 
under special circumstances,'' Sharon said. There was speculation 
he could enter the race if Netanyahu's popularity drops or key leaders 
abandon the Likud party. Sharon, a popular hawk and the most experienced 
minister in Netanyahu's Cabinet, did not say whether he would challenge 
Netanyahu for Likud Party leadership in January primaries or form 
his own slate if he decides to run. Sharon resigned his post as defense 
minister in 1983 after he was held indirectly responsible for the 
massacre of hundreds of Palestinians during Israel's military offensive 
to chase PLO guerrillas out of Lebanon. Later, he served only in second-rank 
posts despite his popularity.
