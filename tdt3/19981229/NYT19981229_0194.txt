Wine books, most of them, are like wine itself: if they are any good 
at all, they hold up for a few years, then fade and are forgotten. 
In the bookstores, wine books are invariably displayed with the cookbooks. 
Ah, but how different they are. There are good cooks who, when asked 
the secret of their success, proudly brandish a stained old tome, 
and insist that everything they know came from Escoffier, Craig Claiborne 
or Julia Child. Wine books, though, are like automobiles: they begin 
to depreciate almost before you've brought them home. After all, the 
chapter on Bordeaux was written six months earlier and based on material 
gathered six months before that. And tasting notes in a book, like 
a railroad timetable, are good for a limited time. Wine is a living 
thing. It improves, it declines, its aroma changes, its color changes 
and so does its taste. A recipe for lentil soup is forever; a comment 
on a wine is ephemeral. So is it foolish to buy wine books? Not at 
all. The best of them deal with what is lasting: wine in history, 
in society, in culture _ its impact on our lives. They tell of the 
unforgettable people who have fostered our wine culture _ or opposed 
it. Most important, they are fun to read. Some of the best wine writing 
is not in wine books _ it turns up regularly in the Bible, for example. 
Closer to our own time, English writers from Shakespeare to George 
Meredith and Evelyn Waugh wrote entertainingly about wine. But wine 
in literature is not the same as wine literature. Is there a body 
of work about wine that is well-written and lasting? I think so, and 
I offer herewith a few examples. A few of these books are out of print 
but a good bookseller should be able to find them without much trouble. 
For my taste, a trio of British writers lead the list: Hugh Johnson, 
Gerald Asher and Clive Coates. Johnson is best known for his ``World 
Atlas of Wine'' (Simon &AMP; Schuster), first published in 1971 and 
now in its fourth edition, 1994, and ``Hugh Johnson's Modern Encyclopedia 
of Wine,'' also in its fourth edition, 1998. But his ``Vintage: The 
Story of Wine'' (Simon &AMP; Schuster, 1989), originally published 
as a companion piece to a television series, is equally impressive, 
and equally enjoyable. Asher is the wine columnist for Gourmet magazine. 
He qualifies for this list because two volumes of his columns have 
been published in book form: ``On Wine'' (Random House, 1986), and 
``Vineyard Tales'' (Chronicle Press, 1996). Asher is one of the few 
writers on wine whose timely pieces are a delight to read long after 
they first appeared. He lives part of the year in California, and 
some of his best articles are on the California wine scene. From London, 
Coates writes, edits and publishes a small, elegant magazine called 
The Vine. Each issue deals with three or four wine properties, usually 
in France; discusses various vintages, and offers Coates' notes and 
impressions from tastings. A number of his profiles of chateaus and 
Burgundy estates have been collected in two magisterial volumes called, 
for Bordeaux, ``Grands Vins'' (1995), and, for Burgundy, ``Cote d'Or'' 
(1997), both from the University of California Press. Coates is a 
superb historian. Even someone only vaguely interested in wine will 
be riveted by his in-depth histories of the vineyards and chateaus. 
Remington Norman's ``Great Domaines of Burgundy'' (Henry Holt, 1996) 
and ``Rhone Renaissance'' (Wine Appreciation Guild, 1996) are large-format 
books, knowledgeably written and handsomely illustrated. The Rhone 
book is particularly valuable because it explains the cultivation 
of the region's grape varieties _ syrah, grenache, mourvedre _ all 
over the world. One isn't likely to curl up before the fire with Jancis 
Robinson's immense ``Oxford Companion to Wine'' (Oxford University 
Press, 1994), but it is essential to even the smallest library of 
wine books. On the other hand, her ``Vines, Grapes and Wine'' (Alfred 
A. Knopf, 1986), about grape varieties around the world, is a surprisingly 
good read. Over the last 20 years, the Dutch writer Hubrecht Duijker 
has turned out a series of first-class large-format books on wine, 
most recently, in collaboration with Michael Broadbent, ``The Bordeaux 
Atlas and Encyclopedia of Chateaux'' (St. Martin's Press, 1998). This 
is mostly a reference book, but I find myself lingering over an irresistible 
combination of geography and history. Just as some of the best writing 
on French wine is by a Dutch writer, one of the finest books on American 
wine, ``Wine Atlas of California'' (Viking, 1993), is by an Australian: 
James Halliday. I hope he updates this book, because it is astonishingly 
thorough and extremely attractive. Alexis Lichine's ``New Encyclopedia 
of Wine and Spirits'' (Alfred A. Knopf), revised in 1987, is becoming 
outdated. His ``Guide to the Wines and Vineyards of France,'' 1951, 
last revised in 1986, is old-fashioned. But it is also a fascinating 
autobiography of the man who taught France how to sell wine to Americans 
and taught us how to drink it.
