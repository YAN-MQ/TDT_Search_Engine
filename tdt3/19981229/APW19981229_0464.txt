Iraq is challenging the no-fly zones patrolled by the United States 
and Britain by flying its warplanes there, Vice President Taha Yassin 
Ramadan said Tuesday. The move came a day after U.S. aircraft fired 
on an anti-aircraft battery in the northern no-fly zone. Iraq says 
four soldiers were killed. Asked if Iraq was flying its own aircraft 
in the no-fly zones, Ramadan said: ``We are doing it right now.'' 
``Iraqi planes in effect are flying in a normal manner in Iraqi air 
space,'' he told Associated Press Television News.
