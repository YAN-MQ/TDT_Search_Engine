A new customs regulation that takes effect Friday requires foreigners 
entering Poland to show they have enough money for their stay upon 
request. Under the existing law, visitors only have to show a passport 
and in some cases a visa, depending on which country they come from. 
Beginning Jan. 1, customs officials also can request proof of sufficient 
finances for the length of the visit. According to the regulations 
announced Monday, tourists and others on private visits who are older 
than 16 must have at least 500 zlotys (dlrs 143), or at least 100 
zlotys (dlrs 28.60) for each day they intend to stay. Those under 
16 must have at least 300 zlotys (dlrs 85.80) or 50 zlotys (dlrs 14.30) 
for each day. Other visitors involved in organized activities _ such 
as tour groups, youth camps or those seeking medical treatment _ must 
have at least 100 zlotys, or 20 zlotys (dlrs 5.72) a day. Foreigners 
using Poland as a transit point also must have money _ 200 zlotys 
(dlrs 57.20) for those over 16 and 100 zlotys for the rest. Since 
the end of communist rule opened Poland's borders in 1989, the country 
has struggled with illegal immigration and smuggling from impoverished 
territories of the former Soviet Union to the east. With Poland planning 
to join NATO in 1999 and negotiating to join the European Union early 
in the next century, it must upgrade its border security to Western 
standards. Polish officials have said the new regulations were intended 
to tighten border controls without having to reintroduce visas from 
former Soviet territories to the east. At the start of 1998, Poland 
began requiring proof of hotel reservations and sufficient money from 
visitors from Russia and Belarus, evoking protests from Moscow and 
Minsk and similar requirements on Polish visitors.
