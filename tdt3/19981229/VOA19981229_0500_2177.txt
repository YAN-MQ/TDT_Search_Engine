The top official of the Organization of African Unity says 1998 has 
been a turbulent year for Africa. Secretary General Salim Ahmed Salim 
cited violence in Somalia, Burundi, Angola, Western Sahara, Southern 
Sudan, the Kamaros, Ethiopia, and Eritrea, Guinea-Bissau, Lasutu, 
and Congo Kinshasa. He urged African nations to work toward peace. 
His remarks were part of his new year's message from the Ethiopian 
capital of Addis Ababa. Mr. Salim said his organization will keep 
searching for solutions to the Congo Kinshasa conflict, the border 
dispute between Ethiopia and Eritrea, and fighting in the Kamaros 
Islands. The secretary general noted there had been modest economic 
improvements during the last year, despite the unrest across Africa.
