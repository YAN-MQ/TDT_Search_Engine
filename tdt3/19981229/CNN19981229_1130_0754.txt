Well, when I T about not being able to see, it's overwhelming. I went 
to the doctor at Lenscrafters... for a regular eye exam. He thought 
he saw a problem. Working with Lenscrafters, I have everything I need 
to give an accurate prescription. But with Elaine, something strange 
showed up. I checked her for glaucoma. I did have the earliest stages 
of glaucoma. I was able to catch something... before it was really 
going to start to affect her life. He helped save my eyesight.
