Former Senator George Mitchell will investigate claims that Salt Lake 
City won the 2002 Olympic winter games by bribing Olympic officials. 
Mitchell led the negotiations during the recent Northern Ireland Peace 
Agreement. Now he's heading a special commission set up by the U.S. 
Olympic Committee. And today, he outlined the tasks ahead. A review 
of the circumstances surrounding the manner in which Salt Lake City 
was selected and to make recommendations to try to make as certain 
as is humanly possible that those processes are fair, above reproach 
and produce the best result, not just for the United States, but for 
the Olympic movement worldwide and, most especially, for the Athletes. 
Senator George Mitchell. His commission has to report to the U.S. 
Olympic Committee by the end of February.
