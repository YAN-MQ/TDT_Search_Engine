On Capitol Hill today, the first meeting of the republican congressmen 
appointed to prosecute President Clinton in a Senate trial. They were 
beginning to plot their strategy, a strategy that might complicate 
the president's defense. ABC's Linda Douglass is on Capitol Hill tonight. 
Linda? Connie, the men who will prosecute the president say they would 
like to call witnesses to the Senate trial to testify as long as the 
Senate will let them do that. They would like to call up to 15 witnesses, 
including Monica Lewinsky, though not including the independent counsel, 
Kenneth Starr. And some of the house prosecutors want to delve into 
other material, material that was not presented to the House of Representatives, 
such as an allegation that President Clinton made an unwanted sexual 
advance on a Woman 20 years ago. But at least one of the prosecuting 
congressmen said woe object to digging into those new areas now. I 
personally don't think that material should be used in the trial that 
was not brought up before the house Judiciary committee or members 
of the house were not privy to formally before we voted on the articles 
of impeachment. But others want the chance to bring in other evidence, 
if the senate will agree. And today, one key conservative senator 
said he will push for a thorough trial, with no consideration of censure. 
The right thing to do is to have a fair and speedy trial and to render 
a Judgment, guilty or not guilty. The Senate republican leader said 
today he too favors an up or down vote on removing the president from 
office. Scoffed at the notion that no democrat would vote to convict 
the president. He said, what are they, all loany left?
