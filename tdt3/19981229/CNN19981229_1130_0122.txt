New developments in the skies over Iraq. The Iraqi vice president 
says Iraqi planes will continue to retaliate against allied planes 
which violate its air space. He says Iraqi planes are currently flying 
in the "no-fly" zones in the northern and southern parts of that country 
for that purpose. Yesterday, the U.S. attacked an anti-aircraft site 
after Iraq launched missiles at U.S. warplanes inside the northern 
no-fly zone. Iraq claims the attack killed four soldiers. U.S. foreign 
policy experts say yesterday's missile exchange is Iraqi President 
Saddam Hussein's latest challenge to U.S. power and U.N. sanctions. 
Analysts say Iraq is trying to bait western warplanes into attacking 
in an effort to gain sympathy from other nations.
