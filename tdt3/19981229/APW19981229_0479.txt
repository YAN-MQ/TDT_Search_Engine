A former postal service employee who killed a bank assistant while 
mounting a revenge robbery on a bank was sentenced to death Tuesday 
by a Beijing court, official media said. Guo Hui, 20, was dismissed 
from the postal service in October for incompetency, the state-run 
Xinhua News Agency said. The next month, on Nov. 14, Guo broke into 
a postal savings bank in Daxing county, in Beijing's southern suburbs, 
in revenge, it said. He killed Zhang Li, a female bank assistant, 
and stole about 5,000 yuan (dlrs 600), Xinhua said. Guo was sentenced 
to death by the Beijing No.1 Intermediate People's Court. His girlfriend, 
18-year-old Ruan Fang, was sentenced to three years imprisonment for 
giving false testimony and covering up for Gao, it said.
