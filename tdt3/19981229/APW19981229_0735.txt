Austrian ski superstar Hermann Maier captured his first downhill victory 
since his dramatic and spectacular spill at the Nagano Olympics _ 
and he did it in style. ``The Herminator'' overpowered the opponents 
in Tuesday's World Cup speed race on a icy and twisty course as he 
led an impressive 1-6 sweep by Austrian skiers in the last Alpine 
event of the year. ``You need courage to win on this course. I was 
brave and I took a lot of risks to clinch this victory. I really wanted 
a downhill win after Nagano,'' the 26-year-old ace from Flachau said. 
At Nagano in February Maier crashed at high speed off the course during 
the Olympic downhill but recovered quickly from bruises and back pains 
to clinch the Super-G and giant slalom titles. The defending World 
Cup champion reached peak speed of up to 123 kph (76 mph) as he mastered 
the 3,070-meter-long (3,359-yard-long) Stelvio course in the winning 
time of one minute, 54.51 seconds in a repeat of last year's triumph 
in this Italian alpine resort. It was the 14th World Cup career victory 
_ the fourth of this season _ for the Austrian ace, who exploded to 
international fame last season by winning the World Cup overall, Super-G 
and giant slalom titles and the two Olympic golds. Maier also earned 
Austria the first downhill victory on the men's circuit in the fourth 
speed race of the 1998-99 campaign. Fritz Strobl and Stephan Eberharter 
placed second and third respectively, to complete the all-Austrian 
podium of strongly built heavyweights. Strobl trailed Maier by 0.70 
seconds. Eberharter, who earned the second podium finish of his career 
in downhill, had a gap of 1.28 seconds. ``I was close to Maier's time 
in the upper part but he was definitely faster in the bottom,'' said 
Strobl. ``I must congratulate him for a great performance. I'm overjoyed 
with my second place.'' Three other Austrians _ Hans Knauss, Werner 
Franz and Hannes Trinkl _ placed from fourth to sixth in an unprecedented 
1-6 finish in men's downhill. Six French women placed 1-6 in a World 
Cup downhill at Abetone, Italy, in 1968. Austrian skiers already had 
set an all-time World Cup record by sweeping the top nine places in 
last week's Super-G race at Innsbruck. Swiss Bruno Kernen, the defending 
world downhill champion, was the first non-Austrian finisher in seventh 
place, 1.99 seconds behind. Maier, nervous and tense before the start, 
piled up a decisive advantage in the bottom section of the course, 
on which most skiers made mistakes due to fatigue. Some, including 
American Chad Fleischer, fell exhausted after crossing the finish 
line. ``It was a tough, difficult race. I attacked throughout and 
only had problems at a jump. It's a great victory,'' said Maier, who 
is headed to succeed retired Alberto Tomba as No. 1 on the world ski 
circuit. Maier, who had captured two Super-Gs and one giant slalom 
earlier this season, strengthened his overall lead in the Cup standings 
by pocketing 100 points, for a total of 640 after 13 events. His closest 
rival, Norwegian Lasse Kjus, was sidelined with bronchitis and did 
not start in Bormio. The Norwegian still held second place overall 
with 537 points and the lead in the downhill standings with 280 points, 
70 ahead of Maier. Kjus dominated the season's first two downhills 
in Val D'Isere and Val Gardena and placed second to Italy's Kristian 
Ghedina in the third. Kjetil Aandre Amodt, another leading Norwegian 
skier, and injured Olympic downhill champion Jean-Luc Cretier of France 
were also missing at Bormio, the site of the 1985 world championships 
which will host the World Cup finals in 2000. Ghedina was a distant 
19th, 3.45 second slower than the winner. The men's World Cup continues 
at Kranjska Gora, Slovenia, with a slalom and a giant slalom, on Jan. 
5-6.
