State prosecutors on Tuesday questioned a son of ex-President Suharto 
as part of a corruption investigation of the former authoritarian 
leader. President B.J. Habibie ordered the investigation of his predecessor 
and onetime mentor after coming under pressure from student protesters 
who want Suharto be put on trial. Suharto quit in May after riots 
and protests against his 32-year rule. Prosecutors have been scrutinizing 
seven charitable foundations owned by Suharto that were allegedly 
used in part to collect money that his family used for its own benefit. 
Suharto, who denies any wrongdoing, has since handed control of the 
foundations to the government. One of Suharto's three sons, businessman 
Bambang Trihatmodjo, was questioned about his activities as chairman 
of one of the foundations, Dana Sejahtera Mandiri. He did not comment 
after questioning at the attorney general's office. News reports said 
the foundation has 1.3 trillion (dlrs 173 million) in cash. While 
critics maintain the probe is largely cosmetic, Attorney General Andi 
Mohamad Ghalib has said Suharto might be named a suspect, a legal 
move that would bring him a step closer to trial. Also under scrutiny 
are a national car project run by another of Suharto's son with huge 
tax breaks and presidential decrees that allegedly benefited the former 
president's family and friends. Prosecutors in the Suharto investigation 
are expected to finish their questioning of witnesses early next year. 
Suharto, whose authority was eroded by his failure to revive Indonesia's 
shattered economy, has been accused of using his position and connections 
to help his six children build huge business empires. The Indonesian 
Observer on Tuesday reported that Suharto and his family own concessions 
to almost 9 million hectares (22,230,000 acres) of forest land in 
Indonesia as well as 205,000 hectares (506,000 acres) of prime real 
estate. The newspaper quoted Land Affairs Minister Hasan Basri Durin 
as saying the land is owned by companies in which the Suharto clan 
controls at least 80 percent of the shares.
