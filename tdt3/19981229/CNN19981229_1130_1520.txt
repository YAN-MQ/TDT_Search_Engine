The Internet is changing the way people communicate. But some say 
it's not for the better. Don Knapp takes a look. Language and literature 
may be a passion for many of these academics, but a paycheck is what 
they may need right now. This is the place to line one up the annual 
meeting of the modern language association department, growing community, 
new casinos. How is the job Mark snet Not too good. For French candidates, 
it's like finding a needle in a haystack. Lots of highly educated 
people, not that many jobs. They offer incentives for the right candidates. 
Say, I have the right credentials. What do you have to offer he? In 
Italian? Tenure position, Italian language, Latin language, great 
department, growing community. New casinos. Las Vegas? Las Vegas, 
that's right. Academicians worry that technology may even further 
shrink the liberal arts job market. You know, some people say, they're 
going to replace the traditional teacher, and we're going to have 
these electronic classrooms, and students can just get in via the 
Internet, and who needs the teacher anymore? Job seekers at the academic 
conference weren't the only ones troubled by the Internet's impact. 
One researcher here worries the English language dominance of the 
Internet threatens the world's other languages and cultures. And if 
American English really does make itself 100% dominant, what that 
will mean is young people in other countries will not see any value 
to their own language. Another researcher says the Internet may be 
subtlety changing the english language. Susan herring studied the 
E-mail records of a group of scientists. I found a decrease in politeness 
over time. So after 11 years, these people were less polite and more 
rude to one another. Scholars like herring theorize that the faceless 
Internet brings out the worst in the way we use language, while language 
teachers looking for jobs seemed to show a face-to-face talk with 
a prospective boss brings out the best. Don Knapp, CNN, San Francisco.
