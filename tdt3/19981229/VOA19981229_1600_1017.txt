This is VOA News Now. I'm Tony Riggs broadcasting to you from Washington. 
Have you talked about your child's health today? Some day, your little 
girl may marry and begin having her own children. Do you know that 
what she eats as a child will have an effect on the health and growth 
of her babies? Girls who are healthy and well fed during their own 
childhood and teenage years have fewer problems later in pregnancy 
and childbirth. Boys and girls need adequate amounts of nutritious 
foods to grow up strong and healthy. Find out from a health worker 
about the best foods to feed growing children. Your child's health 
is your family's future. It's 21 hours 18 universal time, and here's 
the top news story we're following this hour. Yemeni officials say 
four British hostages were killed Tuesday during a rescue of 16 western 
tourists kidnapped by Islamic militants. We'll have more on that story 
and all the days top news in about 12 minutes. It's time now for a 
look at sports. And joining us is Dave Byrd. All right, thanks a lot, 
Tony.
