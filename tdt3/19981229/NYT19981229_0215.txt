For each mile of distance southward from Monterey Bay, the daytime 
temperature rises by one degree. This means that wineries in the southern 
half of Monterey concentrate on hot-weather grapes like cabernet, 
sauvignon blanc, zinfandel and assorted Rhone varietals. And there 
is one more peculiarity to the area: Carmel Valley, a tiny pocket 
at the north end of Monterey County, is protected from wind and fog 
and is therefore hospitable to cabernet. For consumers, the area can 
be tricky to figure out. About 80 percent of Monterey grapes are sold 
to wineries outside the county and, like uncredited actors, slip into 
various blends. Mondavi's Woodbridge wines have used Monterey grapes 
for years, for example. Some wineries, like Testarossa and Nichols, 
use grapes from Monterey and indicate this fact on the label, but 
they are not situated in Monterey. Others, like Wente, the Hess Collection 
and Mirassou, own vineyards in Monterey but do not make the wine there. 
Monterey itself has 20 wineries, but the wines may be designated in 
any of several ways. Many carry the designation Monterey County, but 
some use a specific appellation, like Santa Lucia Highlands, Arroyo 
Seco, Carmel Valley or Chalone. Durney Vineyards prints ``Carmel Valley'' 
on its labels, with no mention of Monterey. Bernardus, also in the 
Carmel Valley, puts ``Monterey County'' on its wines that use grapes 
from vineyards scattered around the county, but its Marinus wine, 
whose grapes come from the Carmel Valley vineyard of the same name, 
is labeled ``Carmel Valley.'' Testarossa makes a Chalone chardonnay, 
but it is, of course, not the same winery as Chalone Vineyard. In 
any case, no one can say what the appellations really mean when it 
comes to the personality of the wine. ``It's a hodgepodge of areas,'' 
said Peter Marks, the wine buyer for Draeger's, the deluxe supermarket 
chain in Northern California. ``It will take a lot more wineries to 
lend definition to these names.'' More broadly, Marks said, Monterey 
remains a wide-open region, with a great deal of land still available 
for vineyards and a lot of detective work to be done before winemakers 
figure out exactly what goes where. ``A lot of these places remain 
to be discovered, but once that happens, Monterey will really take 
off,'' he said. At the moment, Monterey enjoys a solid reputation 
at the lower end of the price scale, with wineries like Estancia and 
J. Lohr turning out approachable, easy-to-drink chardonnays and pinot 
noirs for about $10, and Lockwood Vineyard, at the southern end of 
Monterey County, making some eye-catching chardonnays for about $15. 
At about $10, Mondavi's Coastal label chardonnay and pinot noir deliver 
unexpected elegance. The chardonnay is tart and steely, with an underlay 
of rich butterscotch. The pinot is light-bodied, fruity and bright. 
``At the moment, we're sourcing about two-thirds of our grapes from 
Monterey and a third from Santa Barbara County,'' Shyvers said. ``We'd 
like to evolve everything to Monterey, although it will take time 
to understand the area.'' Upward from the bargain-priced wines, Monterey 
has several wineries that have caught the eye of the critics in recent 
years. Chalone Vineyards, the oldest winery in the region, comes near 
the top of any list, with its lean, minerally chardonnays and a luscious 
pinot blanc. ``After being in a slump for about a decade, they are 
back with a vengeance,'' John Gilman, the sommelier at Gotham Bar 
and Grill in Manhattan, said. ``Their reserve chardonnay came out 
first in a recent tasting we held at the restaurant. We were shocked.'' 
Robert Talbott has attained something like cult status for his classic, 
silken pinot noirs and for his chardonnays from the Diamond T and 
Sleepy Hollow vineyards. They are priced accordingly, from $30 to 
$45. Almost next door, Lee has been making rich, Meursault-like reserve 
chardonnays that sell for about $25. Another standout is a vineyard, 
not a winery. The pinot noir grapes from the Pisoni Vineyard have 
been used to stunning effect by Nichols and Testarossa. Carmel Valley, 
with only five wineries, has two top-level performers in Durney Vineyards 
and Bernardus. In the last five years or so, Durney has been turning 
out luscious, deep cabernets for less than $20 and a fruity, crisp 
chenin blanc that qualifies as a real charmer. Bernardus, just up 
the road, makes a rich, deep Bordeaux-style blend called Marinus that, 
at $30, is the kind of bargain that wine lovers expect from Monterey. 
``In the past, the big guys would trash Monterey and then buy our 
fruit,'' said Robert Talbott, swirling a glass of his pinot noir and 
looking at it with unfeigned admiration. ``Now they're buying up the 
whole valley. Everybody wants to be here now.''
