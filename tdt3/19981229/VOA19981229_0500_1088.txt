It's time now for sports. We want to remind you that the National 
Football League regular season came to an end Monday night, as the 
Jacksonville Jaguars rolled over the Pittsburgh Steelers 21 to 3. 
Jacksonville finishes the season, an 11 and 5 record, having already 
clenched the AFC Central Division title earlier in the month.
