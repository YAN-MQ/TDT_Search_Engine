For "The World," I'm Derrick Stoffel in the BBC Newsroom in London. 
In Yemin the kidnapping of 16 Western tourists, including two American 
women has ended violently. The British foreign ministry says four 
tourists have been killed. Three of them are British, the other Australian. 
The survivors are said to be in a state of shock after the ordeal. 
The BBC's Frank Gardener reports. One man has lost his wife in a shoot-out, 
while an injured woman has lost her husband. The two wounded survivors 
are Britain and American, are both in hospital in intensive care, 
but their condition is not thought to be life-threatening. They say 
that at the time of the shoot-out, they would be moved to -- on foot 
in a mountainous region where their kidnappers were holding them. 
They were broken up into small groups and there is therefore still 
some confusion as to what actually happened next. The Yemini government 
maintains that their forces opened fire to save the hostages from 
being killed by their captors. But only when the survivors returned 
to Britain will the full account of this tragedy be known. Frank Gardener, 
BBC News, Dubais.
