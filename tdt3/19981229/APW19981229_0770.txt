A 49-year-old monk on Tuesday was consecrated bishop by the Roman 
Catholic Church. He's the first Swede to hold the post in about 400 
years. Anders Arborelius was appointed last month by the Vatican. 
He speaks seven languages and spent the past three decades in a Carmelite 
convent in southern Sweden. He was born in Switzerland of Swedish 
parents, and grew up in the Swedish city of Lund. The 16th century 
Reformation religious movement changed Sweden from an almost entirely 
Catholic country into a Protestant one where Catholics were banned. 
Native Swedes were not allowed to be Catholic until 1860. The Catholic 
church claims about 165,000 members in Sweden -- about 2 percent of 
the population. Most of its priests are foreign-born, according to 
the Stockholm diocese, which includes the whole country. Arborelius 
replaced Hubertus Brandenburg, a German, who retired six weeks ago 
when he turned 75, the usual retirement age for bishops.
