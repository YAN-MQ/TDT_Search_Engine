Beijing is getting rid of its fleet of many taxis known as miandis. 
The city wants to reduce exhaust fumes in one of the world's most 
polluted capitals. Carey Gracie reports form Beijing. Although the 
miandis was small, with a tiny and temperamental engine, its box-like 
design and big sliding door meant you could squeeze in not just a 
family and all the weekly shopping, but bulk purchses like a washing 
machine or television, as well. Environmentalists pointed out that 
although miandis constituted only 1 1/2 percent of vehicles on the 
city's streets, they counted for 15 percent of all exhaust fumes. 
Beijingers can see for themselves the black cloud of air pollution 
that hangs over their city. And as they struggle long traffic-clogged 
streets at rush hour, they can smell and taste the damage exhaust 
fumes are doing to their health. Carey Gracie, BBC, Beijing. 3,000 
miandis taxis were melted down today and another 7,000 will be destroyed 
over the coming week.
