Twenty years ago, French high school students were expected to read 
and dissect several plays by Racine before graduating. Today, the 
Education Ministry's curriculum requires them to study just one play 
by Corneille or Racine. So if the teacher's choice is Corneille's 
epic, ``Le Cid,'' Racine remains, well, the name of a street. True, 
at the stately Comedie Francaise, which keeps records dating back 
to the company's creation in 1680, Racine still ranks second _ albeit 
a distant second _ to Moliere as the most produced playwright: 9,291 
performances for Racine against 31,844 for Moliere through 1997. This 
year, the 300th anniversary of Racine's death, two of his plays, ``Andromaque'' 
and ``Mithridate,'' will again be staged by the Comedie. But he is 
clearly not the star he was here 50 years ago. Across Europe, Racine 
is also suffering as French loses its place to English as the compulsory 
second language. His grandiose Greek- and Roman-inspired tragedies 
about lives torn apart by destiny, love, ambition, betrayal and cruelty 
were always regarded as pillars of French classicism. Yet, because 
his genius was thought to lie in his use of language, notably his 
rolling waves of alexandrine verse, the whole point was to read Racine 
in French. And nowadays fewer people can do that: The number of Europeans 
studying French _ or able to understand a play in French _ continues 
to fall. In the afterlife of Racine, then, the acclaimed new London 
productions of his ``Phedre'' and ``Britannicus'' _ in repertory at 
the Brooklyn Academy of Music's Majestic Theater through Jan. 17 _ 
are particularly significant. As presented by the innovative Almeida 
Theater Company, with Diana Rigg and Toby Stephens appearing in both 
plays, the productions have demonstrated that Racine can indeed work 
in translation, that he does have box-office appeal and that he can 
be made relevant to today's audiences. ``In England, Racine has always 
had the slightly gritted-teeth feeling of school exams,'' said Jonathan 
Kent, director of both productions. ``But it's a mistake to see him 
as a sort of statuesque, cerebral academic exercise. He operates at 
a white-hot laser intensity. What's extraordinary about him is that 
he accords with our late-20th-century sensibilities in a way that 
the more humanist Shakespeare does not. The complexity of the psychological 
relationships in his plays is quite remarkable.'' In any successful 
English-language production, the secret to unleashing the full force 
of Racine's words lies in the quality of the translation. For this, 
Kent turned to writers who chose different styles. Ted Hughes, Britain's 
poet laureate who died in October, decided to render ``Phedre'' in 
free verse in the apparent belief that in English, alexandrine couplets 
would restrict the emotional flow of what is perhaps Racine's greatest 
tragedy. For ``Britannicus,'' Robert David MacDonald, a Scottish actor, 
director, playwright and translator, created his own rhyming couplets, 
which seem to suit the more cynical power struggle of Nero's Roman 
court portrayed in this play. Thus, Hughes' language has the heated 
pace of machine-gun fire, while MacDonald's verses are woven like 
spiders' webs. For the director and cast, Hughes' involvement proved 
particularly exciting. Kent said his letter inviting the poet to translate 
``Phedre'' was followed by two months of silence. Then, one day, a 
script arrived in the mail. Hughes was so enthused with the project 
that, although ailing with cancer, he attended rehearsals and saw 
several performances before his death. In a sense, it had also become 
his play. ``Ted's version in free verse acts as a detonation at the 
heart of Racine,'' Kent said. ``It releases the play in a way that 
of course is not true to the letter of Racine but is true to the spirit. 
It is played at a pitch and level of intensity that I hope liberate 
the play from any sense of the museum piece or interesting piece of 
theatrical archaeological dig.'' Ms. Rigg, as Phedre, suffers to the 
point of taking her life over her unrequited love for her stepson, 
Hyppolytus, played by Stephens, the son of the renowned English actors 
Maggie Smith and the late Robert Stephens. In her experience with 
the play, Ms. Rigg said, no less than in the French original, it is 
language _ Hughes' language _ that gradually overwhelms the audience. 
``Ears are starved for abundant rich language,'' said Ms. Rigg, who 
first took on the role 20 years ago. ``Here, it is like a tidal wave. 
It starts and goes and goes inexorably. It is a tradition resurrected, 
which is why I love it so much.'' With ``Britannicus,'' the process 
was simpler. While Hughes worked with Kent and Ms. Rigg on the final 
version of ``Phedre,'' MacDonald delivered his script and simply authorized 
whatever changes were felt necessary. ``Rhyming couplets are perfect 
for `Britannicus' because it is a glittering, political, sophisticated 
piece, a sort of grand soap,'' noted Ms. Rigg, who in this play appears 
opposite Stephens' Nero as his devious mother, Agrippina. ``Wit is 
quite important and rhyming couplets serve wit. I don't think they 
serve high drama terribly well. You tend to get a plonk at the end 
of the line, which can be funny.'' Kent had previously directed English-language 
versions of ``Le Cid'' and of Moliere's ``Tartuffe'' and ``School 
for Wives,'' but this was his first meeting with the youngest of the 
trinity of 17th-century French theatrical masters. As always, though, 
as with Corneille and Moliere, and in his production of Euripides' 
``Medea'' (seen on Broadway in 1994 with Ms. Rigg, who won a Tony 
Award for the role), he said he approaches classical plays as contemporary 
works. ``What's wonderful is that audiences have discovered them as 
new plays,'' the 49-year-old director said in a telephone interview 
from London. ``At most, a few people had a dim folk memory of `Phedre' 
as some mother in love with her son. But people had no idea what `Britannicus' 
is about. And the genius of the play is that it operates as a sort 
of political thriller. People love that.'' Given the vast cultural 
gap represented by the narrow English Channel, it is, of course, unsurprising 
that Kent and his team believe they are presenting Racine with a freshness 
absent in French productions. Indeed, for most English theatergoers, 
classical French theater a la Comedie Francaise is still that of formal 
gestures and grand oratory. In the case of Racine, Kent said, ``The 
language is indulged in a way that I think does him a disservice.'' 
And Ms. Rigg offered: ``We can look at him with reverence and awe, 
but we can also blow the dust off him.'' Certainly, France has a tradition 
of worshipping at the altar of its cultural icons. But it also enjoys 
attacking these icons in the name of historical conflicts _ monarchism 
vs. republicanism, Roman Catholicism vs. secularism, right vs. left 
_ that have a peculiar way of resurfacing. And so it is that Racine 
has of late been deemed politically incorrect in some French intellectual 
circles. For them, Racine's first offense was to have been educated 
by a pious Catholic movement known as Jansenism, based at the Convent 
of Port-Royal near Paris. When Racine moved to Paris in 1658 at the 
age of 19, he turned to writing, first odes to Louis XIV, then a play 
put on by Moliere's company. But he soon broke with Moliere just as 
he broke with Jansenism and, when he was proclaimed the new Corneille 
after the success of ``Andromaque'' in 1667, he added fans of the 
aging Corneille to his list of enemies. In the next decade, as Racine's 
genius flowered, he wrote one comedy, ``Les Plaideurs,'' a satire 
of the French legal system, and six more great tragedies, climaxing 
with ``Phedre.'' Then, after ``Phedre,'' he abruptly abandoned writing 
and became the king's official historiographer and a favorite of the 
court. Although a famous scandal erupted when he was accused of poisoning 
his mistress, in his 50s he rediscovered religion and wrote two plays 
around biblical themes. When he died in 1699, he asked to be buried 
at Port-Royal. ``What irritates me is that for the last 50 years Racine 
has been seen as a villain, a social-climbing courtesan,'' said Anne 
Delbee, an actor and director who has put on most of Racine's plays, 
including eight different productions of ``Phedre.'' ``He was seen 
as someone who betrayed everyone, which I think is ridiculous. It's 
lucky he left Moliere or he might never have become Racine.'' Still, 
based on the reaction of audiences attending her most recent ``Phedre'' 
at the Comedie Francaise in 1996, Ms. Delbee believes young people 
are showing new interest in Racine because modern concerns, such as 
disillusionment with politics and a growing spirituality, are sharply 
mirrored in his plays. Daniel Mesguich, an actor and director of forthcoming 
productions of ``Andromaque'' and ``Mithridate,'' also believes Racine 
to be topical today, though he speaks scathingly of attempts to modernize 
the author's themes and characters. ``When I hear people say you should 
blow the dust off the classics, I say the opposite,'' he explained. 
``I think we should show the dust on stage and work with the distance 
that separates us from the text. We need distance to understand the 
20th century, so why not go back to the 17th century? But that's different 
from crushing the 17th century with the 20th century, as the updaters 
do, or from presenting a pseudo 17th century, as the orthodox do.'' 
Mesguich believes new meaning can always be found hidden in Racine's 
texts because, he said, unlike Corneille and Moliere, Racine wrote 
in a complex manner, at one level with great clarity, at another level 
infusing deep tragedy into his very language. So can Racine survive 
in translation? ``I have always felt that Racine would work there,'' 
Ms. Delbee said upon learning of the new London productions. ``I always 
said another poet should do the translations. Better a parallel poem 
than a word-for-word translation.'' Mesguich was less certain. He 
recently directed a French-language version of ``The Tempest.'' But 
Racine, he cautioned, is not Shakespeare. ``The genius of Shakespeare, 
the greatest writer of all time, is that there is a lot of meaning 
beyond the words,'' he said. ``Racine was a lesser genius and therefore 
more precise and more limited. So, when he is translated, you lose 
more. With Shakespeare, you lose perhaps 30 percent of the impact. 
With Racine, you lose perhaps 50 or 60 percent.'' The problem with 
great classics is that there never is a definitive translation, one 
that acquires an aura of its own by being studied _ and performed 
_ through the ages. But the London productions of ``Phedre'' and ``Britannicus'' 
have also shown this to be a good thing. Thanks to frequent new translations, 
each generation can see old texts through its own eyes. And here, 
at least, Racine has benefited. He may be speaking in strange tongues, 
but he seems to be making himself perfectly clear.
