Hong Kong stocks ended slightly higher Tuesday with few shares traded 
as investors stayed away for the holiday season. The blue-chip Hang 
Seng Index rose 55.83 points, or 0.5 percent, to close at 10,225.97. 
Trading volume was thin, with some fund managers switching to other 
markets in preparation for the inauguration of the single European 
currency _ the euro _ on Monday, said Felix Ngai of Sun Hung Kai Commodities 
Ltd. Selling in big property shares in the afternoon gave a late boost 
to the weak market turnover, which hit 1.33 billion Hong Kong dollars 
(U.S. dlrs 170 million) _ barely higher than Monday's six-year low 
of 1.22 billion Hong Kong dollars (U.S. dlrs 156 million). The day's 
biggest gainers were banking giant HSBC Holdings, up 2.00 Hong Kong 
dollars to close at 197.00; China Light, up 0.50 at 39.40; and Cheung 
Kong Infrastructure, up 0.40 at 17.75. Conglomerate Swire Pacific 
``A'' was up 0.10 at 35.70. Among the losers were Henderson Land, 
down 0.40 at 40.70; Hutchison Whampoa, down 0.25 at 54.75; Sun Hung 
Kai Properties, down 0.25 at 57.25; and Cheung Kong Holdings, down 
0.25 at 56.50. Hong Kong's flag carrier Cathay Pacific gained 0.15 
to 7.65.
