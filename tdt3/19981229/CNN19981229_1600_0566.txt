China is suspending flyover privileges to balloons. The decision comes 
after a team of balloonists drifted off course and over chinese airspace. 
Millionaire Steve Fossett, British tycoon Richard Branson and per 
lindstrand from Sweden were given approval to cross the nation below 
26 degrees north latitude. But the international team ended up further 
north and only through diplomatic appeals were they allowed to continue. 
A team of one Australian and two Americans will be the next to attempt 
an around-the-world balloon flight. They've been delayed by bad weather, 
and now expect to take off on new year's day.
