The cold weather has done some of its worst damage in California's 
citrus groves. The full impact of last week's cold snap is only now 
becoming clear, and the cost could run as high as $600 million. Across 
the country, people will soon be seeing higher prices at the checkout 
counter. ABC's Lisa Salters reports from Porterville, in the San Joaquin 
valley. Though the sun is now shining on central California's citrus 
crops, the damage has been done. At this orange packing house, workers 
separate the good fruit from the bad. We anticipate a loss of about 
50% that's gone right now and then we have to determine how we handle 
the remaining 50% still on the trees. At wholesale produce markets 
around the country, buyers who supply local supermarkets are already 
feeling the effect of the freeze. Orange prices have gone up 200% 
just in the last week. Before the freeze, oranges were selling at 
$8 to $10 a carton. And since the freeze, they've increased to about 
$25 to $30, a cost increase that will be passed along to the consumer 
this week. They'll see retail prices go from like 50 cents to 70 cents 
a pound to $1.50 to $1.99 a pound. There is some good news for citrus 
farmers trying to survive. Today, California's governor declared a 
state of emergency in the four hardest hit areas, Fresno, kern, and 
Tulare county. It's very important to the survival of our industry. 
Tom avinelis relied on state and federal assistance to come back from 
the last freeze in 1990, that not only wiped out the harvest for that 
year, but killed many of the region's young citrus trees. Just over 
the last couple of years has much of the citrus industry really begun 
getting back on its feet again, and having this happen is a real setback. 
And like in 1990, some citrus growers may never recover. Lisa Salters, 
ABC News, Porterville, California.
