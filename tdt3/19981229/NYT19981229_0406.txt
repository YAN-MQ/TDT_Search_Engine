For nearly six months the 19 National Basketball Association players 
on the union's negotiating committee have stood in the background 
and flanked their leader, Billy Hunter, like a support group with 
clinched jaws and firm stances. But now they have been placed under 
intense scrutiny. After the committee rejected what the owners say 
was their final proposal on Sunday, Commissioner David Stern called 
those 19 players a runaway group who will be to blame if the season 
is canceled Jan. 7. He also said they were holding the other 400-plus 
members hostage and expressed thinly veiled suspicions over the influence 
of agent David Falk on the group. ``I think his remarks are unprofessional, 
and I think they're beneath his dignity,'' said Falk, who represents 
three major stars on the committee: Patrick Ewing, Alonzo Mourning 
and Juwan Howard. ``What he says is out of desperation. It's like 
a player complaining about a referee because he's losing the game 
or he's not winning.'' But Stern is not the first person to have raised 
the issue of how and why 19 players were granted the only authority 
to endorse an owners' proposal and present it to their members for 
a vote to save the season. The union says it was simple: In the summer 
of 1997, the union's executive committee was voted into office by 
the league's 29 player representatives. And Ewing was elected president. 
The executive committee then chose a cross-section of players to make 
up the negotiating committee from the low-end salary ranges (Atlanta's 
Ty Corbin) to the upper-middle (Knicks' Allan Houston) and the high-end 
(Mourning, Howard). This summer, when 250 players gathered in Las 
Vegas for a meeting, a vote was taken to give the negotiating committee 
the power to decide when and if to bring a proposal to the membership 
for a vote. ``I've been led to believe that if a player expressed 
that it wasn't such a good idea, he was disciplined,'' Stern said. 
Players on the committee take issue with Stern. ``We don't muzzle 
our players,'' said Danny Schayes, a member of the committee. ``Stern 
is the one who does that.'' Members of the union said they wished 
Stern would have listened in on the over 100 players who were on a 
conference call with Hunter and Ewing on Tuesday. Union officials 
said that of the 30 players who spoke out on the call, 25 were willing 
to scrap the season if the owners failed to move on their last proposal. 
One official said that even Karl Malone _ who has flip-flopped on 
several issues this summer _ changed his view that the owners deal 
was fair and charged that it was not good enough. Not one asked for 
a vote, the union said. Still, there have been reports of players, 
some who wish to stay anonymous and some, like Kevin Willis, very 
public in their concern with the union's negotiating strategy. Several 
players, from John Stockton to Steve Kerr, have been shouted down 
when they've asked for a more pragmatic approach. Even those who believe 
the owners' current proposal is not favorable and is not a deal that 
should be voted on have concerns about the makeup of the negotiating 
committee. ``Any time you have a monopoly _ in that the stars people 
listen to are Falk guys _ it's not good for everyone,'' said Jayson 
Williams, an All-Star for the Nets. Williams noted that the owners' 
deal fell well short of the acceptable threshold for the masses. ``I 
wanted to be on the committee,'' he said, ``but they didn't want me. 
They wanted all of Falk's guys as the leaders.'' Falk's name has surfaced 
through the lockout. He has been accused _ and has even admitted _ 
to putting thoughts in the heads of players like Ewing. And when Michael 
Jordan came swooping in to stir up a collective bargaining session 
in November, Falk took credit for it. But as far as leading the negotiating 
committee down a destructive path, agents call that an insult. ``It's 
a disservice to Billy Hunter and the committee,'' the agent Arn Tellem 
said. ``It shows a lack of respect for the players.'' But it is not 
as if Falk has not tried to wiggle his way into the forefront of negotiations. 
He said he has asked repeatedly to be part of the union's negotiating 
team and wants to pull up a chair to the bargaining table. Falk said 
all requests have been denied by Hunter and the union. ``I wish I 
had more authority and influence,'' Falk said. ``David is accusing 
me of doing the same thing that he is doing. I say this in a praise-worthy 
way, but if David weren't the ultimate manipulator, why would he gag 
29 owners? He assumes total control. No one speaks without his direction. 
If David Stern wanted to be candid _ instead of being incredibly political 
_ he would say this is a negotiation and our sole goal is to significantly 
roll back costs so that the owners can make more profit. His fight 
is not with me.'' Right or wrong, Falk has been viewed as a hindrance 
to the negotiations and as a shadowy figure lurking in the background 
of the negotiating committee. In response to Falk's remarks, Stern 
said Tuesday that Falk should ``stop professing his noninvolvement.''
