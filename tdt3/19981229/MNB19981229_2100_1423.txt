Much more ahead as we continue in our next half-hour from New York 
including the court battle over the Nixon papers. What is the dollar 
value of the artifacts? Which of these two computers is perfect for 
you? The one that was built two months ago or this one, which hasn't 
been built yet? Gateway wants to ask you some questions first. How 
fast do you want to go? Movie buff? How many kids? Any future rembrandts? 
The perfect computer should be exactly what you want it to be. Starting 
at $999 with an Intel celeron processor. Call 1-800-gateway.
