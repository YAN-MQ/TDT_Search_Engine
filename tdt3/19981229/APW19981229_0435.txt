Russia produced an estimated 303.5 million metric tons of oil in 1998, 
and exported 134 million metric tons, the Fuel and Energy Ministry 
said Tuesday. Oil exports are Russia's main revenue earner, and the 
cash-strapped government has been trying to keep up exports, despite 
the slide of world oil prices. This year's exports will mark a 6.3-percent 
increase from 1997, the Fuel and Energy Ministry said, according to 
the Interfax news agency. But revenues were down considerably, officials 
have said. Next year, Russia is expected to produce between 284 million 
metric tons and 296 million metric tons of oil _ down nearly 5 percent 
from 1998, the ministry said. Russia will export between 108 million 
metric tons and 120 million metric tons of oil next year, it said.
