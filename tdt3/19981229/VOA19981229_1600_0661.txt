There is still fighting all across Africa, and on the whole 1998 has 
been a turbulent time on the continent, according to a report issued 
by the Organization of African Unity. But as VOA's Scott Sterns reports, 
there were modest economic gains in some parts of Africa during 1998. 
Secretary General Suwi Mahmed Salim urged African leaders to break 
a vicious cycle of conflict and violence. He said the OAU will continue 
to seek peace in fighting between rival separatists on the Indian 
Ocean island of Anjuwa and the border dispute between Ethiopia and 
Eritrea. None of those peace missions have yet brought results. Secretary 
General Salim says efforts aimed at inculcating a culture of peace, 
tolerance, and democracy are still fragile. He says precious lives 
have been lost in Somalia, Burundi, Angola, Sudan, Western Sahara, 
Guinea-Bissau, Lasutu, Sierra Leone, and Congo-Brazzaville. In his 
New Year's message from OAU headquarters in the Ethiopian capital, 
Secretary General Salim says millions of Africans continue to live 
an unenviable life of exile as refugees and displaced persons. There 
were modest economic gains in some parts of Africa in 1998, with the 
secretary general saying the private sector is becoming more involved 
in promoting development. He says economic reforms are bringing positive 
results including promising improvement in gross domestic product 
and per capita income. But for the overwhelming majority of Africans, 
Secretary General Salim says it's still a life of poverty, unemployment, 
inadequate shelter, lack of education, and malnutrition. He urged 
African leaders to take bolder and more imaginative steps toward peace 
in 1999. Congo's rebellion now involves troops from at least eight 
other countries. There's new fighting in Angola's civil war, and heavy 
combat between Nigerian peace-keepers and rebels in Sierra Leone. 
Ethiopia and Eritrea are dug in around their rocky border, former 
allies now facing each other with tanks and jet fighters in a conflict 
involving Jubudi, Somalia, and Sudan. Scott Stern, VOA News, East 
Africa bureau.
