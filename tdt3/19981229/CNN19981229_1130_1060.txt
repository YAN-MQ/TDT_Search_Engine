Declining gasoline prices have prompted the Internal Revenue Service 
to postpone the start date of a new tax reimbursement rate. Effective 
April 1st, employees can ke deduct 31 krebts for every mile they drive 
their own cars for work purposes. That's down from the current 32.5 
cents and the first ever cut in the reimbursement rate. The IRS originally 
set the change to take effect January 1st, but many companies complained, 
saying the reduction could make it difficult to reprogram their payroll 
software.
