You cannot avoid them if you watch any television at all. 10-10 telephone 
numbers are advertised almost on a nonstop basis these days and they 
claim to save money on phone rates. They are called in the business 
dialing around services. A lot of big celebrities are getting paid 
big money to push them big time on television. But are the big promises 
of big savings for real? NBC news correspondent Anne Thompson offers 
some answers on that tonight. Turn on your TV and you're bombarded. 
You are getting hammered by long-distance charges. Make sure you dial 
10-10-321. It's always 10 cents a minute. Dial-around companies offering 
savings. Punch in special codes, get special rates. Rick Williams 
says he believed the ads and dialed in January thinking he would cut 
the Bill in half. My rates is 10 cents per minute. I thought it would 
be five cents per minute. I thought it would be $50. I wound up with 
an $85 telephone Bill. That's why consumer advocates are crying foul 
over these ads. Many of them have catches. Linda Sherry of consumer 
action points to this promise. 10-10-321 saves over AT&T on every 
call. But does it really? In the fine print the comparison is to AT&T's 
basic rates. Most people don't even though that AT&T's basic rates 
are very high to begin with. So you're not really -- they're promising 
you maybe a cent savings. In fact, New York assembly member Scott 
stringer says he researched seven different dial-around plans and 
sometimes they can cost you more. One example -- a 10-minute state-to-state 
call on Sunday. Using 10-10-321, costs $1.30. that same call can cost 
50 cents using AT&T's simply minutes program. You really should stop 
deceiving people and just become honest about what your product really 
costs. Next week stringer says he will introduce a Bill to require 
dial-arounds to reveal the real rates in their ads and in recorded 
messages when you use their services. They have to disclose what their 
rates are, how much a phone number would cost, time wouldcost more 
than 20 minutes, how much it would cost less than 20 minutes. Stringer 
says he is not the only one looking into dial-arounds. The federal 
trade commission and the federal communications commission are both 
conducting informal investigations into these ads. Telecom U.S.A., 
operator of 10-10-321, says the criticism is biased and that their 
advertising is completely accurate and that their service is one of 
the least expensive calling options. Another major dial-around company, 
lucky dog, says its customers know exactly how much a call costs and 
that they are pleased with the response they are getting. Even the 
critics admit it is possible to save money using dial-arounds. But 
only if consumers do their homework, studying the rate plans and their 
own calling patterns. Homework Rick Williams wishes he had done before 
he picked up his phone and started dialing for discounts. Anne Thompson, 
NBC news, Chicago.
