In Yemen, three hostages were killed when police stormed the hideout 
of islamic militants who had kidnapped 16 tourists. Two British men 
and an American woman died in the shootout, as did two of the kidnappers 
and a police officer. Authorities say it was the first time hostages 
had been killed in Yemen. Two British men and an Australian were injured. 
The other hostages were released unharmed. Yemeni officials say the 
kidnappers demanded the release of a colleague in the Islamic Jihad.
