A new government ruling on imported poultry may not send American 
chicken producers running for cover, but it's big news for connoisseurs 
of foie gras. For the first time, the uncooked livers of French geese 
will be sold in the United States. The Department of Agriculture last 
week removed restrictions on the import of raw poultry products from 
France, as well as from Greece, Luxembourg and Spain, declaring the 
countries free of exotic Newcastle disease, a fatal poultry virus. 
An outbreak in southern California in 1971 cost U.S. taxpayers $56 
million when 12 million birds had to be destroyed. The Agriculture 
Department said it did not expect much immediate impact from the ruling, 
but one importer has wasted no time in capitalizing on it. Ariane 
Daguin, an owner of D'Artagnan in Newark, N.J., the largest distributor 
of American foie gras in the United States, said, ``Goose is the first 
thing I'm going for.'' The fresh foie gras she carries now is all 
from domestic ducks. The only fattened goose livers currently available 
are imported and always at least partly cooked, or mi-cuit. ``If everything 
goes well with customs, we will have some tomorrow,'' she said on 
Tuesday. But they won't be cheap. Fresh, raw goose livers, each weighing 
nearly 2 pounds, will be $56.50 a pound, plus $18 shipping for retail 
customers. The wholesale price, to restaurants, will be $44 a pound. 
Ms. Daguin said she was also importing some fresh duck livers, at 
$37 a pound retail ($29 a pound wholesale), about 50 percent higher 
than the price for domestic duck livers. The ban on raw poultry imports 
was lifted after inspections were requested in 1997 by the Directorate 
General for Agriculture of the European Commission. The ruling also 
declared Luxembourg, Portugal, Belgium, Greece and France free of 
some diseases, including rinderpest and foot-and-mouth, which affect 
swine and cattle. Meat and poultry still may not be imported unless 
they come from processing plants that USDA inspectors have determined 
to comply with safety and hygiene standards and unless they have the 
proper permits. But eventually items like Portuguese linguica sausage 
may also be available in American shops. Although the poultry ruling 
covers not only foie gras but also chickens, ducks, geese, game birds 
and eggs, the department said it did not expect much impact on the 
American market, since the United States already produces more poultry 
than it consumes, and exports more than 10 percent. But Steve Gold, 
the founder and marketing director of Murray's Chickens in South Fallsburg, 
N.Y., which sells chickens to the better restaurants and fancy food 
shops, was skeptical about the new ruling. ``Why allow the import 
of chickens from other countries when small growers are closing down 
because they can't pay their bills and can't afford the price of feed?'' 
he said. Judging by the prices, he may have nothing to fear. If Bresse 
chickens, the French birds with blue feet and great flavor, were imported, 
Ms. Daguin estimated they would be more than $5 a pound, double the 
price of the most expensive chickens sold in the United States. And 
even that could be affected by bananas, strange as it seems. A threat 
by the United States to slap 100 percent tariffs on goods imported 
from Europe, because the European Union has restricted imports of 
bananas, could raise the price of Bresse chickens to $10 a pound and 
goose foie gras to more than $100 a pound. It may be cheaper to get 
on a plane, but it will still be impossible to bring any back in luggage. 
Import bans for travelers remain.
