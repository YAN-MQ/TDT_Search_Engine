There's now a safer way for people with narcolepsy to stay awake. 
Today, the FDA approved provigil, a drug designed to fight frequent 
bouts of sleepiness. Researchers say it is less addictive and has 
fewer side effects than the amphetamines and other stimulants that 
narcoleptics often use. One study indicated the drug improved patients 
day-to-day performance by 50%. Provigil could be available in February.
