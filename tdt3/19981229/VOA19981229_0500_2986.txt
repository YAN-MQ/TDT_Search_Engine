U.S. stocks gave up early gains Monday to end mixed, even though an 
Internet rally helped push the NASDAQ composite to yet another record 
close. The benchmark Dow Jones Industrial Average resumed trading 
today at just under 9227, the seventh straight gain for the 30-issue 
Dow. The big news is the NASDAQ, which added more than 17 points Monday, 
reopens at 2180. Shares of Internet retailers soared on the first 
day of trading since Christmas after a consulting firm in Boston said 
holiday shopping online more than tripled this year over 1997. Analyst 
James A. Wad warns things on the NASDAQ can't go on like this forever. 
The Internet is here to stay. It's going to change the way we do many 
things. And there will be some business models that will be enormously 
successful. But along the way, there will be many casualties, also. 
And most of these stocks are reflecting only good news now. And somewhere 
along the line, you will get some piece of bad news out of one of 
these stocks that's very extended, and it will cause a compression 
in all the stocks, and then a rational sorting out process. But right 
now, I think if I held them, I'd be inclined to sell them. The valuations 
are understandable. Online sales this year are expected to reach $13 
billion, perhaps up to 40 billion next year.
