With an uneasy truce continuing to hold in Serbia's Kosovo province, 
United Nations aid workers are trying to get food and supplies to 
those who fled the four days of fighting. A rebel leader says he will 
observe the truce he agreed to Sunday with international monitors, 
but he will not withdraw his forces. The monitoring agency is setting 
up an office to search for individuals who have gone missing during 
the months of conflict.
