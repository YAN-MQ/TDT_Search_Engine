Work crews in Washington state are struggling to reopen two major 
passes in the cascade mountains, after more than a foot of snow fell 
on the area. Authorities closed them fearing possible avalanches. 
At least 4,000 holiday travelers are stranded and hotels in the area 
are full. Some people are waiting in hotel lounges and lobbies. There 
are other weather problems as well. In gig harbor, a mudslide pushed 
a house off its foundation and forced the evacuation of six other 
homes.
