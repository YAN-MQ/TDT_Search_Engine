The head of Indonesia's armed forces has pledged that the military 
will be neutral and not try to influence national elections next year. 
The armed forces' chief, Gen. Wiranto, said the military, which has 
played a crucial role in Indonesia's politics, would ``keep an equal 
distance to anyone,'' including the governing Golkar party as well 
as opposition parties. At a news conference Monday after meeting with 
President B.J. Habibie, he said the military's main role would be 
to safeguard security for all political parties to contest the first 
free elections since the end of former President Suharto's 32-year 
dictatorial rule in May. But Wiranto reaffirmed an earlier promise 
to form a 40,000-strong civilian militia to help keep law and order 
before the elections June 7. Voters are to elect a 550-seat House 
of Representatives. The election is to be followed in August by a 
meeting of the 1,000-member People's Consultative Assembly, which 
will choose a new president.
