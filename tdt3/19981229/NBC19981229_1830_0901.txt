NBC news "in depth" -- tonight, those ten-ten numbers advertised nonstop 
on television these days, the ones supposed to save money on phone 
rates. They're called "dialing around" services. And a lot of big 
celebrities, are getting paid big money to push them big time on television. 
And they're starting to work. The most recent figures show 11% of 
American households have bought into them, making $2 billion in ten-ten 
calls just in this past year. That's from both home and pay phones. 
But are the big promises of big savings for real? NBC's Anne Thompson 
offers some answers tonight, "in depth." Turn on your TV and you're 
bombarded. You are getting hammered by long distance charges. Make 
sure you dial -- It's always ten cents a minute. Dial around companies 
promising long distance savings up to 50% in some cases. Punch in 
special codes, get special rates. Rick Williams says he believed the 
ads and dialed in January, thinking he would cut his Bill in half. 
I thought my rate would be five cents a minute. I thought instead 
of spending $100 it would be $50. That's why consumer advocates are 
crying foul over these ads. Many of them have catches and that's where 
consumers get caught. Linda Sherry of consumer action points to this 
promise. 10-10-321 saves over AT&T on every call. But does it really? 
In the fine print, the comparison is to AT&T's basic rates. Most people 
don't even know that AT&T's basic rates are very high to begin with. 
So you're not really, they're promising you maybe a cents savings, 
that's not much to be saving. In fact, New York assembly member Scott 
stringer says he researched seven different dial-around plans, and 
sometimes they can cost you more. One example -- a ten minute state-to-state 
call on Sunday using 10-10-321 costs $1.30. that same call can cost 
50 cents using AT&T's simply minutes plan. They really should stop 
deceiving people and just become honest about what their product really 
costs. Next week, stringer says he will introduce a Bill to require 
dial-arounds to reveal the real rates in their ads and in recorded 
messages when you use their services. They simply have to disclose 
what their rates are, how much a phone number would cost more than 
20 minutes and less than 20 minutes. And stringer says he is not the 
only one looking into dial-arounds. Federal trade commission and the 
federal communications commission are both conducting informal investigations 
into these ads. Telecom USA, operator of 10-10-321 and 10-10-220 says 
the criticism is biased and that they're advertising is completely 
accurate and fully substantiated and that their service is one of 
the least expensive calling options. Another major company, lucky 
dog owned by AT&T say its customers know how much a call costs and 
they are pleased with what they are getting. Even the critics admit 
it is possible to save money using dial-arounds. But only if consumers 
do their homework, studying the rate plans and their own calling patterns, 
homework Rick Williams wishes he had done before he picked up his 
phone and started dialing for discounts. Anne Thompson, NBC news,
