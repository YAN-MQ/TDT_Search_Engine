A special commission today opened an investigation into allegations 
that bribery was involved in the selection of Salt Lake City as host 
of the 2002 winter Olympic games. Kathleen Koch reports. Snagging 
the winter Olympics -- it was a grand feat that could mean billions 
to Utah's economy. But now it's alleged that Salt Lake City won its 
Olympic bid by giving selection officials and their families hundreds 
of thousands of dollars in scholarships, medical care and gifts. A 
commission headed by former Senate majority leader George Mitchell 
has opened a two-month investigation for the U.S. Olympic committee. 
We are going to look at it with an open mind. We are going to be as 
thorough as possible. We are going to try to be as fair as possible. 
But we're not going to prejudge it. The international Olympic committee 
has already stated Salt Lake City won't lose the games, nor will it 
ask that any city officials be fired. Instead, it's launched its own 
inquiry, and may punish those IOC members who allegedly took bribes. 
Mitchell's panel will focus not on punishment, but on determining 
what happened and drafting rules to stop future abuses. But with greed, 
humans, and high stakes involved, Mitchell says compliance is a sticky 
issue. That is, what enforcement mechanisms are there? What available 
sanctions are there? The U.S. Olympic committee in 1997 passed rules 
limiting gift-giving to selection officials to just $25. The limit 
internationally is $150, but officials say it's widely ignored. Some 
wonder whether the IOC will tighten its restrictions too, so U.S. 
cities aren't outbid in the gift department. That's a good question 
for the IOC. Our job is to make sure the system in the United States 
is above reproach and that's what we're going to do. There are also 
separate investigations by Salt Lake City and the justice department. 
The four inquiries virtually guarantee the selection process for future 
U.S. Olympic sites will be tightly controlled and closely watched.
