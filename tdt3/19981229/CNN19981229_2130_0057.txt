Iraq's vice president says the war is still on. He says Baghdad will 
exercise its right to retaliate against violations of its air space 
and will continue to fly the no-fly zones and fire at allied aircraft. 
Baghdad has been threatening to shoot down any U.S. or British planes 
patrolling the restricted areas in northern and southern Iraq. Iraqi 
planes actually fly normally in their skies. And our resistance of 
any violation continues. And we consider the violation as a continuation 
of the American/British aggression. Yesterday U.S. warplanes fired 
on an anti-aircraft position in Iraq. Despite Iraqi threats, the Pentagon 
says U.S. and British aircraft will remain on patrol, but bad weather's 
been keeping planes out of the northern no-fly zone today.
