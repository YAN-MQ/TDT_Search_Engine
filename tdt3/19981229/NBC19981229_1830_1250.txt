The U.S. military released gun camera video of yesterday's dust up 
between american fighter pilots and Iraqi forces in the northern no-fly 
zone. The split-screen image shows anti-aircraft fire -- the plume 
of smoke on the right, and the view from the U.S. jet on the left. 
American pilots fired three missiles and dropped six bombs on Iraqi 
surface-to-air missile sites.
