First tonight, we learn more today about the timing and direction 
of what the U.S. Senate is about to undertake, putting the president 
on trial. While talk of a deal of some sort continues to swirl around 
the nation's capital, the case is proceeding. Before we talk live 
here tonight with two men who have played crucial roles thus far in 
this impeachment process including one who will go on to manage the 
case in the Senate, we will begin with a look at where we stand tonight 
from the White House with the latest from Claire Shipman. As the team 
of house republicans known as impeachment managers met today to discuss 
how they want to make their case at trial, Senate majority leader 
trent Lott told NBC news he wants a strome lined proceeding two weeks 
from start to finish. Lott's proposal next Wednesday the first day 
Congress is back, he announces that the Senate is ready to hear the 
bills of impeachment. The next day, the house managers read the bills 
of impeachment and chief justice William rehnquist swears in the senators 
for the trial. The trial itself begins on Monday, January 11, and 
according to Lott could finish with a vote to acquit or convict by 
January 22, two weeks later. A censure resolution would follow. The 
democratic leadership likes this schedule as well and both sides have 
agreed that there's no need to call witnesses. Monica Lewinsky, for 
example. But the house managers are already complaining. Many want 
more time and witnesses. I am anticipating based on everything we've 
discussed today that there would be witnesses. As for the White House, 
the president's advisors like the idea of a Streamlined trial. They 
say they would be willing to give up their right to a lengthy defense 
as long as, as they put it, the prosecutors play by the same rules. 
Claire Shipman, NBC news, the White House.
