Elections to Greenland's local parliament will be held Feb. 16, Premier 
Jonathan Motzfeldt said Tuesday. Motzfeldt, of the social democratic 
Siumut party, has led the Danish territory's home-rule government 
since last year. He replaced Lars-Emil Johansen, who resigned. The 
Cabinet coalition, which also includes the liberal Atassut party, 
holds 24 of the 31 seats in parliament. The last parliament vote was 
held on March 4, 1995. Elections are held every fourth year. Greenland, 
the world's largest island, won substantial home-rule from Denmark 
in 1956 and has had its own parliament since 1979. Denmark continues 
to be in charge of foreign and defense policy, as well as matters 
related to law and the currency of the arctic island's 56,000 people.
