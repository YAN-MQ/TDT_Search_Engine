Many of our local FM and medium wave affiliates are about to take 
a two-minute break. This is VOA News Now. Today is Tuesday, December 
29th, 1998. On this date in 1940, some time before the United States 
entered World War II, President Franklin Roosevelt used the words 
"arsenal of democracy" to describe the nation. The phrase was part 
of Mr. Roosevelt's efforts to rouse American workers to produce more 
ships, tanks, planes, trucks, and other war materials that the allies 
needed to defend themselves against Nazi Germany and fascist Italy. 
The president said that an axis victory in Europe would pose a serious 
threat to America. He said, "Never before has our American civilization 
been in such danger as now. We must be the great arsenal of democracy. 
For us, this is an emergency as serious as war itself." As President 
Roosevelt had correctly surmised, the United States would itself need 
an arsenal of war machines less than one year later when it entered 
World War II. On this date in 1962, President John F. Kennedy praised 
the survivors of the failed Cuban refugee attack at the Bay of Pigs 
in Cuba, 1961. More than 1100 of the captured invaders had been released 
by the Cuban government in exchange for $53 million worth of medical 
and veterinary supplies, food, and farm machinery. About 40,000 Cuban 
refugees in Miami, Florida cheered President Kennedy as he praised 
the bravery of their fighters who, with American support, had tried 
to overthrow Fidel Castro's Communist government in April 1961. President 
Kennedy said their conduct and valor were proof that although Castro 
and his fellow dictators may rule nations, they do not rule people. 
Now stay tuned as VOA News Now continues. It's 21 hours 30 universal 
time, and this is VOA News Now. Yemeni officials say four British 
hostages were killed Tuesday during a rescue of 16 western tourists 
kidnapped by Islamic militants. Iraq says it is flying aircraft in 
the western-declared no-fly zones in the north and south of the country. 
And Dateline today examines persecution of Christians in Asian countries 
in our next half hour of VOA News Now. First, a summary of world news. 
I'm Robert Burns, VOA News.
