A federal court on Tuesday ordered the National Honor Society to admit 
two Kentucky students who were denied membership last spring because 
they had become pregnant. The young women must now be admitted to 
the society for the rest of their senior year while they wait for 
their case to come to trial. In issuing a preliminary injunction, 
Judge William O. Bertelsman of federal District Court in Covington, 
Ky., asserted that the women had ``a high probability'' of winning 
their case. Bertelsman accepted the plaintiffs' argument that membership 
would not do ``much good if they get admitted after they graduate 
from high school in May.'' The National Honor Society had argued that 
``the public interest requires support of the public school's efforts 
to encourage high morals and strong character as part of the educational 
process.'' But Bertelsman ruled that a higher public interest is always 
``to uphold the legal rights of others.'' Therefore, he wrote, ``the 
balance of equities favors the plaintiffs.'' The two woman, Somer 
Chipman, 17, and Chasity Glass, 18, of Grant County High School in 
Williamstown, Ky., were represented by Sara L. Mandelbaum of the American 
Civil Liberties Union's Women's Rights Project. ``This decision sets 
a very important precedent,'' Ms. Mandelbaum said on Tuesday, ``because 
it gives teeth to the under-enforced federal statute prohibiting sex 
discrimination, pregnancy discrimination and marital status.'' Suzanne 
Cassidy, the lawyer for the Grant County School District, the superintendent 
of schools and the faculty committee that selected the society members, 
said her clients would comply with the order even though they still 
believed the district ``did not practice discrimination against the 
two students when it made the decision not to grant them admission 
to the honor society.'' Ms. Glass said she was ``in a state of shock'' 
after receiving word of Bertelsman's decision. ``I'm really, really 
excited about this.'' At the end of their junior year, Ms. Chipman's 
grade-point average was 3.9 on a scale of 4.0, and Ms. Glass' was 
3.7. They said they were never officially told why that out of 33 
students with the required academic standing, they alone were denied 
entry to the National Honor Society. When they asked for an explanation, 
they say they were told that they had not measured up to the criteria 
for admission. Ms. Glass is single, and she and her daughter, Shelby, 
who is 20 months old, live with her parents. Her daughter's father, 
she said, is in the National Guard and sends her $40 a week for child 
support. Ms. Chipman's daughter, Cheyenne, was born in June. Ms. Chipman 
and her child's father, Shawn Hurston, were married in August.
