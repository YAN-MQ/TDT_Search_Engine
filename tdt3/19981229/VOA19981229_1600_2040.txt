The leaders of Uganda and Rwanda say their troops will remain in Congo-Kinshasa 
until security in their own countries is assured. Ugandan president 
and the Rwanda met in the Ugandan border town of Caballe Tuesday. 
Meanwhile, rebels in the former Zaire say they have captured the northwestern 
town of Gamena. There's been no confirmation of the claim.
