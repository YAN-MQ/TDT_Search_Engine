The presidents of the International Olympic Committee and football's 
world governing body, FEFA, will meet next week to try to settle their 
differences over doping regulations. Juan Antonio Samarang and Seth 
Bladder will get together at FEFA headquarters in Zurich, Switzerland 
January 6th. The two organizations have been at odds over the drug 
problem for some time. FEFA, along with the International Tennis and 
International Cycling Olympic Sports Federations expressed reservations 
at an IOC resolution on drugs last month. That resolution called for 
all Olympic sports to impose a minimum two year suspension on athletes 
that use steroids. The sports that do not comply risk being dropped 
from the Olympics. FEFA questioned whether the penalty was enforceable 
and argued that not all of the IOC's banned drugs enhance football 
players' performance.
