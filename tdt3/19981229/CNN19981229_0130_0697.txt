This mouse, and some two dozen others, may be leading the way for 
human victims of spinal cord injuries. The rodents had their hind 
legs paralyzed, leaving them unable to walk. But days after they were 
given an experimental drug, almost all could walk again. The drug 
is called cm 101. If cm 101 can prevent neuronal degeneration in humans 
as it does in mice, then we should be able to do some good in acute 
spinal cord injury. This is how it works. After a spinal cord injury, 
scar tissue forms and can prevent nerves from reconnecting. Cm 101 
stops the scar tissue from growing and allows the nerves to reconnect. 
But just because it works in mice doesn't mean it will in humans. 
The researchers hope to conduct human tests in 1999. For the latest
