Rap artist, busta rhymes is in trouble with the law. He was arrested 
and charged with weapons possession in New York Sunday night. Putting 
his legal problems aside, rhymes has made quite a name for himself 
with hit records and his outrageous fashion sense. Mark Scheerer reports. 
Messin' with the wrong group hope you know what you're doin' Busta 
rhymes is ready to "party like it's 1999." The rap star with the rapid 
fire delivery is out to get his, before the world turns into "apocalypse 
now," a theme touched on in his previous solo albums. Say "fired up!" 
Fired up! Say "fired up!" Fired up! All of the albums actually connect. 
"The coming, "the warning," "when disaster strikes" are preliminary 
signs of the time of the extreme turning point. And although his new 
album offers his darkest view of the future to date, busta rhymes 
prefers to look at the bright side. It's just a bunch of ideas of 
what could be, what might be, and what might never happen. Since becoming 
an MTV darling, thanks in part to his colorful collaborations with 
music video director hype Williams, rhymes has attracted the attention 
of artists from other musical genres. Janet Jackson's desire to work 
with the rapper resulted in a new duet entitled, "what's it gonna 
be?" Not only did I want to get just cool with her on a personal level, 
just so we could always have a communication and just vibe, but overall, 
I wanted the song to be incredible,. Ozzy rules! Fans of ozzy osbourne 
are also in for a surprise, the Oz man also hooked up with rhymes 
on the new album, busting out a remake of his classic heavy metal 
anthem, "iron man." Just to bring it even more so -- closer to the 
home plate of undisputed, full-blast hot record, I reached out to 
ozzy. Busta is also reaching out into the fashion world by unveiling 
his own "booshie" clothing line in '99, which the Brooklyn, New York, 
native describes in only two words -- "unlimited flavor." What else 
could this rap-prophet turned retailer possibly sink his teeth into 
next? Well, of course, the children's entertainment market. Rhymes 
recently Lent his distinctive voice to "the rugrats movie." I am reptar, 
hear me roar. You know what I'm saying? And it was just like, it was 
like, this is bug to me, you know. This is really bugged out to me. 
This former mc and busy bee is working hard to maintain his buzz.
