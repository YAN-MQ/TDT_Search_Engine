China is withholding permission for balloons to cross its airspace, 
after British tycoon Richard Branson and his teammates drifted off 
course during their failed round-the-world attempt, the Foreign Ministry 
said Tuesday. China had earlier approved overflights by three round-the-world 
balloon teams, but is now suspending permission, Foreign Ministry 
spokesman Zhu Bangzao said. Asked when China might permit more overflights, 
he replied: ``It depends. Well, you can wait for the notification.'' 
Branson, American millionaire Steve Fossett and Per Lindstrand of 
Sweden were originally granted permission to cross China below 26 
degrees north latitude. However, the trio drifted further north than 
planned. Following diplomatic appeals from Britain, the balloonists 
were allowed to continue flying. Caught in poor weather, the team 
splashed down off Hawaii on Friday. Following the problems with that 
flight, ``the Chinese side has postponed the permission of balloons 
flying through Chinese airspace,'' Zhu said. A Swiss-based team last 
week postponed its round-the-world attempt because China withdrew 
permission. The Swiss government is now negotiating with China to 
obtain clearance for the balloon, piloted by Bertrand Piccard. Piccard's 
last bid also was abandoned after China refused his balloon entry, 
causing it to miss out on jet-stream winds needed to speed it over 
the Pacific. Another attempt at the balloon record was stalled Monday 
by strong winds over the Re/Max team's launch pad in Alice Springs, 
Australia. Other teams plan take-offs from Chicago and Albuquerque, 
N.M.
