The Clinton administration contends that children who are abused or 
neglected are more likely to become criminals themselves. President 
Clinton has announced an initiative aimed at curbing violence against 
children. The plan has four parts. First, legislation that would, 
among other things, make it a felony to endanger a child's life through 
abuse. Second, additional training for police, prosecutors and investigators 
in dealing with children who are victims of abuse or witnesses in 
court cases. Third, state and community projects aimed at helping 
abused children. President Clinton will announce $10 million in grants 
to get the programs started. And finally, increasing public awareness 
of the problem, including a National conference on children and violence 
next year. Children's exposure to violence has tremendous Negative 
consequences for them and for all the rest of us. A child who experiences 
serious violence is 50%, 50% more likely to be arrested as a juvenile 
and nearly 40% more likely to be arrested as an adult. If you want 
to keep the crime rates going down, you have to do more to break the 
cycle of violence to which children are exposed.
