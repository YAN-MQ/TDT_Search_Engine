Primitivo Salento Cantele 1995, Italy. About $10. Just to uncomplicate 
things a bit, primitivo is the grape, Salento is the region in southeastern 
Italy where it is grown, and Cantele is the name of the family who 
grow it. For a while, primitivo was a prime suspect in the mystery 
surrounding the origin of the zinfandel grape. But then someone came 
along with a Croatian grape that seemed even closer. Scientists now 
say it is unlikely that either grape can claim parenthood. In any 
event, the resemblance of this full, sturdy red to zinfandel is unmistakable. 
Like a suspiciously high number of our California zinfandels, this 
primitivo comes from vines 35 to 40 years old, which accounts for 
its intensity. At $10, it is a good buy.
