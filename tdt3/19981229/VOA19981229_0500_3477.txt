American baseball star Mark McGwire became more widely known than 
ever this year. Of course, you remember he's the fellow we were talking 
about him lot on News Now night after night when he was slamming those 
home runs into the stands. He hit 70 of them, and that was a new record, 
all time, that number of runs in 1998. But now he's been honored in 
another way for his manners. The National League of Junior Cotillions, 
an etiquette and social training program, puts the St. Louis Cardinal 
at the top of its ten best-mannered people list for the year. The 
league cited McGwire for accepting great acclaim with great humility. 
Other people on the best-mannered list include the president's daughter, 
Chelsea Clinton, astronaut and U.S. Senator John Glenn, Evangelist 
Billy Graham, and television talk show host Oprah Winfrey. Where's 
Sammy Sosa? I thought he had great manners, too. I don't know, but 
he certainly had a lot of class. They both did. They both did.
