A top leader of the Khmer Rouge muttered an apology Tuesday, saying 
he was ``sorry, very sorry'' for the suffering he had caused the Cambodian 
people. His apology, in English, came only after aggressive questioning 
at a news conference. At the insistence of Cambodian reporters, he 
repeated it in the Khmer language: ``Knyom som tos.'' But the leader, 
Khieu Samphan, repeatedly urged Cambodians and foreigners to ``let 
bygones be bygones'' regarding the deaths of more than a million people 
between 1975 and 1979, when the Khmer Rouge ruled Cambodia and he 
was head of state. Khieu Samphan, 67, who was welcomed back to society 
on Tuesday with an embrace from Prime Minister Hun Sen and a trip 
to Phnom Penh with accommodations at a luxury hotel, said Cambodia 
should focus on the problems of the present and ``forget the past.'' 
A second high-ranking defector, Nuon Chea, 71, was also asked if he 
had an apology to make to his countrymen. ``Actually, we are very 
sorry not only for the lives of the people of Cambodia, but even for 
the lives of all animals that suffered because of the war,'' he said. 
Some Cambodians said the remark reflected a Buddhist pacifist theology. 
They also noted that Nuon Chea referred specifically to Cambodia's 
long civil war, not to the ravages of the Khmer Rouge rule, when nearly 
a fourth of the country's population was killed or died of starvation, 
disease or overwork. Known as ``Brother No. 2'' to the late Khmer 
Rouge leader Pol Pot, Nuon Chea was the architect of the movement's 
brutal forced evacuation of the cities in 1975. He later had command 
responsibility over a wave of purges in which many thousands of people 
were tortured and killed. Asked whether the Khmer Rouge were indeed 
responsible for large numbers of deaths, he said: ``Please leave this 
to history. This is an old story. Please leave it to the past.'' Khieu 
Samphan was similarly circumspect on the question of guilt, muttering 
at one point, ``To say who is wrong and who is right and who is doing 
this and who is doing that, et cetera,'' and then rephrasing: ``The 
developments of history in our country are very complicated. Please 
don't keep stirring things up.'' He said he had listened Tuesday to 
a foreign radio broadcast in which Cambodians had described the losses 
of family members at the hands of the Khmer Rouge. ``It is normal 
that those who have lost their families, that they _ what to say _ 
feel some resentment,'' he said, speaking in English. ``But I feel 
that most of our compatriots understand that we have much more problems 
to resolve at the present and in the future and we have to forget 
the past.'' He added: ```Let bygones be bygones' is the best solution 
for our country, because it is the only way to reach national reconciliation. 
It is the sine qua non condition for peace and stability in our country.'' 
Prime Minister Hun Sen, a former Khmer Rouge leader himself, said 
the same thing on Monday in somewhat less high-flown language: ``We 
should dig a hole and bury the past.'' Despite his past assurances 
that he wanted and would assist in setting up a tribunal to try Khmer 
Rouge leaders for crimes against humanity, Hun Sen said on Monday 
that those who surrendered should be greeted ``with bouquets of flowers, 
not with prisons and handcuffs.'' While they were indeed greeted with 
bouquets at their hotel Tuesday, a diplomat said work was continuing 
at the United Nations to lay the groundwork for any possible future 
trial. The surrenders by Khieu Samphan and Nuon Chea virtually complete 
the collapse of the Khmer Rouge movement, a process that began more 
than two years ago with widening defections. Only one major figure, 
the battlefield commander Ta Mok, has not given up or been welcomed 
back by the government. Virtually all of his guerrilla fighters are 
gone. During the news conference, Khieu Samphan mostly maintained 
his smile, but he was clearly distressed by a drumbeat of harsh questions. 
Would he at least tell the Cambodian people he was sorry for their 
suffering, a foreign reporter asked. ``Yes,'' he said, barely audibly. 
``Sorry, very sorry.'' In the audience, a Cambodian human rights worker 
could hardly contain himself. ``Sorry is enough? Enough? I want to 
beat these guys up,'' he said. A Cambodian reporter shushed him. But 
later the reporter, who had earlier said he agreed with Hun Sen's 
policy of forgiveness and national reconciliation, said he could not 
hold down a surge of fury when the two Khmer Rouge leaders arrived 
at a luxury hotel in their chauffeured sport utility vehicles. ``When 
I see them, it is difficult to forgive _ very difficult,'' said the 
reporter, who lost most of his family during the Khmer Rouge years. 
``It is just like waking me up when I see them. But we have to forgive 
and move on.'' The two elderly leaders, who gave up their struggle 
four days ago, flew here Tuesday morning by helicopter from the western 
town of Pailin, where they have begun new lives as self-proclaimed 
``ordinary citizens.'' They were treated to lunch by Hun Sen before 
being driven to their hotel, where a manager said they and their families 
had been booked in by the Defense Ministry at a corporate rate of 
$105, including breakfast. The manager said welcome baskets of fruit 
and flowers had been placed in their rooms. The two men were joined 
at the lunch by Ieng Sary, the former Khmer Rouge foreign minister, 
who defected more than two years ago. He is the chieftain of Pailin, 
which has become an enclave for the defecting killers. When a small 
group of Cambodian photographers were allowed to take pictures of 
their meeting with the prime minister on Tuesday morning, the photographers 
said they were instructed in a threatening manner not to publish any 
photographs of a handshake or embrace. Khieu Samphan and Nuon Chea 
arrived in the capital in a strange political vacuum _ indeed, a vacuum 
of reality _ unnoticed and unremarked as the daily life of this threadbare 
city surged around them. Their defection and coming visit had been 
reported in the local press, although their schedule was not disclosed 
in advance. It was the first visit here by Nuon Chea since Khmer Rouge 
times, when Phnom Penh was a dead city, emptied of its citizens by 
his absolutist theory of a primitive agrarian revolution. He walked 
slowly, using a polished and ornamented wood cane, looking straight 
ahead and saying little. Khieu Samphan, one of the movement's chief 
diplomats, had dyed his white hair a rich chestnut brown and seemed 
to want to exude a suave urbanity. But as he left the heated news 
conference, surrounded by jostling, shouting reporters and struggling 
security men, his smile became fixed and even terrified.
