More job cuts to report. Conoco, the sixth-largest U.S. oil company 
will eliminate 75 positions, about 6% of its workforce. The move stems 
in part from low crude oil prices forecast for next year. As part 
of the restructuring, the company will also take a fourth-quarter 
charge of $50 million. Conoco was recently spun off from DuPont. And 
workers at AT&T are leaving so fast, the company says it's one year 
ahead of schedule in reducing its workforce by 18,000. So far, 16,000 
employees have left the company. AT&T says that's mainly due to an 
unexpectedly high number of managers accepting the company's early 
retirement packages. At&T expects the job cuts to save it at least 
$700 million this year.
