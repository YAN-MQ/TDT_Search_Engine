Hong Kong sank slightly deeper into recession in the third quarter 
than economists had originally estimated, but the revised figures 
were not bad enough to warrant a gloomier forecast for the full year, 
the government said Tuesday. Gross domestic product fell by 7.1 percent 
for the three months ending Sept. 30, a drop that was 0.1 percentage 
point more than the preliminary estimate released last month. Hong 
Kong showed its worst quarterly economic performance since 1973, the 
first year when officials began measuring such statistics. The government's 
earlier forecast that the economy would shrink by 5 percent for all 
of 1998 was not revised. Hong Kong's GDP had fallen by 5.1 percent 
in the second quarter and 2.6 percent in the first quarter, according 
to Hong Kong's Census and Statistics Department. A sharp fall of 10 
percent in private consumption expenditure was one of the major reasons 
for the continued recession. Local consumer spending was depressed 
by the rise in unemployment, which hit a record 5.5 percent in the 
three months ending Nov. 30 _ the highest since the government began 
keeping those numbers in 1981. Hong Kong's recession also has been 
attributed to continued slackening in domestic consumer demand, a 
significant decline in investment spending and the further setback 
in export performance. Hong Kong's exports fell 7 percent in the third 
quarter. Inflation was just 0.4 percent in the third quarter. In November, 
the territory registered deflation _ or falling prices _ for the first 
time in 23 years, with the composite consumer price index dropping 
by 0.7 percent. Despite all the gloomy economic news, the government 
said there were some positive signs emerging, including loosening 
of the credit crunch, successive cuts in local interest rates, and 
a rebound in prices of shares and real estate. These factors and improved 
sentiment should boost local demand in due course, officials said.
