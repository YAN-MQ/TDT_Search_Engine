At least four tourists were killed today, after being held hostage 
by an islamic extremist group in southern Yemen. The yemeni government 
says 16 tourists were abducted from a bus by a Splinter group of the 
Islamic Jihad yesterday. After negotiations with the kidnappers failed, 
government troops stormed the hideout. A yemeni diplomat in Washington 
says some of the kidnappers may have been killed. Others were arrested. 
The British foreign secretary confirms three British tourists were 
killed. Officials say neither of two American tourists was killed, 
but one was wounded.
