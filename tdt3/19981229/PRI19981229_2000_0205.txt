Cypress says it will not deploy Russian missiles on the divided island. 
This comes after Turkey had warned the action could lead to war. But 
the president of Cypress Glacov Klarides says they may install the 
missiles on the Greek island of Crete. There, they would be out of 
range of both Turkey and the breakaway Turkish Cypriote region in 
the north of the island.
