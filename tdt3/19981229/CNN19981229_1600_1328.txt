Broncos offensive coordinator Gary kubiak meeting with browns president 
carmen policy today to discuss the vacant head coaching job in Cleveland. 
Kubiak says he's happy in Denver and would need a spectacular offer 
to leave his current post. You know, I look forward to the challenge.

are some people who think I'm ready to do that.
