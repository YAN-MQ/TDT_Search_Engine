About 100 international observers were heading Tuesday to Kosovo in 
efforts to curb fighting in the ethnic-Albanian majority Serbian province 
while NATO reiterated warnings of possible intervention. The observers' 
arrival will boost the Kosovo monitoring mission to about 700 people, 
with the envisaged total of 2,000 expected to be reached by mid-January, 
said Sandy Blyth, a spokesman for the Organization for Security and 
Cooperation in Europe, which runs the operation. The arrivals follow 
violence last week in the north of the province that further frayed 
a shaky de-facto truce established in October. Authorities seeking 
to avert a threatened NATO strike then agreed to end a months-long 
crackdown on Kosovo's separatist-minded ethnic Albanians. The months 
of violence left hundreds dead and hundreds of thousands _ most of 
them ethnic Albanians _ on the run in Kosovo, a province of the dominant 
Yugoslavian republic of Serbia. Reacting to the recent upsurge, NATO 
said Tuesday from its headquarters in Brussels, Belgium, that it remained 
``ready to intervene'' if violence intensifies in the province and 
demanded that both sides respect the informal cease fire. KLA spokesman 
Adem Demaci told reporters in Pristina that the guerrillas will respect 
the cease-fire ``but we will defend ourselves with all means if necessary.'' 
Two bodies were found Tuesday morning under a bridge on the road leading 
north from the province's capital Pristina, close to the town of Kosovska 
Mitrovica. Police were trying to identify the two frozen corpses. 
The Kosovo Information Center, run by the pro-independence Kosovo 
Albanian leadership reported some overnight shooting on the outskirts 
of Kosovska Mitrovica which ``made the situation there very tense 
and difficult.'' In the wake of the recent fighting, Serbs from the 
region most affected demanded protection from Yugoslavian President 
Slobodan Milosevic. In an open letter, made public in Belgrade, they 
said they don't want to continue being victims of ethnic Albanian 
guerrillas seeking the province's independence. The Serbs, from the 
northern Podujevo region, said this was their last ``desperate'' appeal 
to the Yugoslav authorities before they pack up and flee Kosovo because 
of ``the terror'' of ethnic Albanian guerrillas who control much of 
the region. ``We demand that you use all available means to protect 
our lives and territory,'' the letter said. ``If you are not ready 
to help us, tell us loud and clear so we don't keep on dying in vain.'' 
The most recent fighting began on Christmas Eve and lasted four days, 
killing 15 people, wounding dozens and displacing at least 5,000. 
Serbs, a tiny minority in the Podujevo region, said that 13 Serbs 
remained missing after the fighting. They said they evacuated some 
200 of their children from the region, where ethnic Albanian guerrillas 
continue patrols. Blyth said Tuesday that Kosovo was ``reasonably 
quiet ... although there are still areas which are tense.'' He said 
Italians, Finns, Germans, Swedes, Turks, Americans, Britons, Canadians, 
Russians, Spaniards, Norwegians, French, Estonians and a Lithuanian 
were in the latest group of observers.
