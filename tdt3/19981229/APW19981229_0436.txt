Hong Kong's top anti-corruption agency on Tuesday charged a police 
sergeant and seven others with fixing soccer matches, government radio 
reported. The police sergeant was also charged by the Independent 
Commission Against Corruption for allegedly offering bribes to a police 
superintendent and a chief inspector in return for information on 
raids on bookmaking centers, Hong Kong Radio reported. The unidentified 
police sergeant allegedly offered up to 100,000 Hong Kong dollars 
(U.S. dlrs 12,820) each to the police officers, it added. All defendants 
were charged with operating an illegal bookmaking center in Hong Kong 
to fix local and international matches from June last year to June 
this year, the report added. The defendants, including an assistant 
bank manager and four unemployed men, were ordered to enter pleas 
in court next month. Their names were not given. The case followed 
an earlier ICAC investigation which resulted in the prosecution of 
six professional players for fixing matches, including a World Cup 
qualifying match against Thailand last year. Top player Chan Tsz-kong 
was jailed for one year in July on the match-fixing charges after 
he pleaded guilty to accepting 80,000 Hong Kong dollars (U.S. dlrs 
10,256) in exchange for giving up two goals against Thailand.
