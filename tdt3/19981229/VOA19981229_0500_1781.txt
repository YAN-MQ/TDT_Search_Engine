It's 10 hours 30 universal time, and this is VOA News Now. Iraq vows 
to continue shooting at Western military planes that enter its air 
space to patrol no-fly zones. The son of Israel's Likud Party founder, 
Menachem Begin, announces that he's a candidate for prime minister 
in elections scheduled for next May. We'll have details on those stories, 
some business news, and a look back at the best in country music for 
1998, all coming up in this half hour of VOA News Now. Hello, again, 
from Washington, I'm Charlene Porter, along with Les Carpenter.
