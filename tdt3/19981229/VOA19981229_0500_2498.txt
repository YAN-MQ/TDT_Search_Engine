An uneasy truce is holding in Serbia's Kosovo province. A spokesman 
for the Organization for Security and Cooperation in Europe said no 
fighting had been reported to the group on Monday. U.N. aid workers 
taking advantage of the respite in the fighting are trying to get 
food and supplies to people who ran from four days of fighting. The 
International monitors in Kosovo have set up an office to handle reports 
of missing persons in the province, but so far, they have been given 
a list of 700 people, including Serbs, ethnic Albanians, and others. 
The commander of ethnic Albanian forces who want independence for 
Kosovo say Monday that they will honor a truce he agreed to Sunday, 
but they will not withdraw forces. There have been reports over the 
past few days that Serbian forces withdrawn under the threat of NATO 
air strikes in October are returning to the region.
