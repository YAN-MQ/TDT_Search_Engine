Iraq is claiming it shot down an allied warplane today. An Iraqi army 
communique states the aircraft was patrolling the no-fly zone in northern 
Iraq, when it was downed by anti-aircraft batteries. The Pentagon 
is denying that version of the incident. It says two U.S. warplanes 
were fired on while patrolling the no-fly zone, but they were not 
hit. The United States says the planes then returned fire, destroying 
several iraqi targets. President Clinton says enforcing no-fly zones 
is Paramount. The no fly zones have been and will remain an important 
part of our containment policy. Because we effectively control the 
skies over much of Iraq, Saddam has been unable to use air power to 
repress his own people or to lash out again at his neighbors. Our 
pilots have the authority to protect themselves if they're threatened 
or attacked. They took appropriate action today in responding to Iraq's 
actions. Once again, I want to tell you that I'm very proud of the 
work they do, the risks they take, the skill and the professionalism 
with which they do it. They attacked because they were attacked. And 
they did the appropriate thing. We will continue to enforce the no-fly 
zones. Iraq says today's U.S. attack was completely unprovoked. It 
says the missiles killed four soldiers, and wounded seven others.
