Well, the NFL playoffs begin on Saturday with Miami Dolphins hosting 
the Buffalo Bills. The winner will meet the Denver Broncos in the 
second round. In Dallas the Cowboys will host the Arizona Cardinals. 
That winner will go on to play the Atlanta Falcons. Two more games 
will be played Sunday. The New England Patriots will be in Jacksonville, 
Florida to face the Jaguars. The winner earns the right to play the 
New York Jets in the second round. The Green Bay Packers will battle 
the 49ers in San Francisco. One of those two teams will advance to 
face the Minnesota Vikings, which finished the regular season with 
the best record in the NFL.
