The yacht "sayonara," owned by American billionaire Larry ellison 
is the winner of this year's Sydney-to-hobart yacht race off Australia, 
but ellison is in no mood to celebrate. A storm left four contestants 
dead and two others missing. Paul Marshall reports. The storm behind 
her, "sayonara" sailed into the sea soon after sunrise. Big, powerful, 
beautiful, but she's beat up and so is her crew. Everyone okay on 
board? Yeah. Phil keily's ankle is broken. That's lachlan Murdoch 
in the yellow. Sayonara is 80 feet, but they broke things, tore sails 
and the Hull is coming apart. They missed the record by some five 
hours. Nobody cared. There was none of the jubilation of the hobart 
victory, a wave at best. But mostly just hand shakes among a crew 
who've been there. Owner Larry ellison was on the wheel. How was it 
out there? Horrible. There was a welcome, a small one, but no band, 
no fireworks. It wouldn't have been right. Out there dying, this is 
not what this is supposed to be about. Chris Dickson said if they'd 
known how bad it was going to be, they would have thought twice. I 
speak for every member of the team when I say that we're thinking 
about those that are still out there. Lachlan Murdoch says he's hooked 
on ocean racing now, but this is tough. I think everyone here is very 
saddened and gives you a very sort of mixed feeling about being part 
of it at all, in many ways. And certainly our thoughts go out to the 
families that have lost loved ones. They helped Phil keily off the 
boat. He broke his ankle a day ago when "sayonara" was hit by a wave. 
My foot sort of went sideways and with the full weight of me come 
crashing down from about four feet up, just snapped. They say they'll 
take time to get over what they all went through. Larry ellison and 
Chris Dickson won't be back for a while. I'm not sure I'll be back 
for the next one in a hurry. This boy's had enough hobarts for a while. 
Will you be back? Not if I live to be 1,000. Last year's winner, "brindabella" 
was second across the line, three hours behind "sayonara." In hobart, 
Paul Marshall, 7 nightly news.
