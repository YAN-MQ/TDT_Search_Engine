The government has released Ruth Simon, an Eritrean working for Agence 
France-Presse, after 20 months in detention without charge, an official 
said Tuesday. The official, who asked not to be further identified, 
said Simon had benefited from an amnesty but did not provide further 
details. Simon, the mother of a young child, was at her home in Asmara, 
but neither she nor members of her family wanted to comment on her 
detention or release. Simon, a veteran of Eritrea's 30-year independence 
war with neighboring Ethiopia, was also the chairwoman of Bana, an 
association of demobilized women fighters seeking a place for the 
female veterans in Eritrean society. She was arrested April 25, 1997 
after reporting that President Isaias Afwerki told a meeting of cadres 
of the ruling People's Front for Democracy and Justice that Eritrean 
rebels were fighting alongside Sudanese rebels in neighboring Sudan. 
Afwerki denied making the statement, and officials said Simon had 
attended the meeting as a cadre and that it was closed to the press. 
Eritrea hosts the National Democratic Alliance, an umbrella organization 
of parties and groups opposed to Sudan's National Islamic Front government. 
Simon was never charged with any crime during her imprisonment. On 
Oct. 18, Simon and four other journalists were named recipients of 
the International Press Freedom Awards by the New York-based Committee 
to Protect Journalists. U.S. first lady Hillary Clinton met Simon 
at the Bana headquarters in March 1997 during an African tour.
