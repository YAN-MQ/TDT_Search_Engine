Floatmakers are worried that unstable temperatures could take some 
of the bloom off of the annual rose parade. Jennifer author reports. 
a couple of cold fronts followed by above-normal temperatures have 
worked to send nerves into orbit in southern California. But organizers 
hope you won't notice on January 1st, when the rose parade's 50-foot-tall 
depiction of astronaut buzz aldrin plants a U.S. flag on the moon. 
It's been a roller-coaster ride. A week or so ago, it was freezing. 
Bill lofthouse and family have been building rose parade floats for 
the past 43 years. The day before Christmas, when a lot of Flowers 
came in, we had to put heaters in the tents. Two days ago, it was 
85 degrees. We're not using the warm room, we're thinking of putting 
refrigerator trucks in. This year, under the theme "echoes of the 
century," the lofthouses have 26 of the parade's 56 floats. Just for 
our floats alone, we're probably going to use somewhere around a 500,000 
carnations. We're probably going to use 300,000 Roses. We're probably 
going to use somewhere from 75,000 to 100,000 orchids. While weather 
poses the most serious challenge for florists and float decorators 
of the rose parade, it is also the primary reason this tradition began, 
January 1st, 1889. For 110 years now, the rose parade has done its 
part to promote california's climate. You know, it was a real estate 
ploy. California, over the last century or more has traditionally 
grown at a very fast rate -- much faster than the nation as a whole. 
According to the professor, climate remains the number one reason 
people come to California from other states. Perhaps another sign 
that some people take Bloom as bait. Jennifer Auther, CNN, Pasadena, 
California.
