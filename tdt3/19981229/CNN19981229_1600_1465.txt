A theatreowner in South Carolina is ending his ban on "R" rated movies. 
David crenshaw stopped showing the movies back in August, saying he 
wanted to take a stand against sex and violence. After a month, attendance 
at his theaters dropped by almost half, and crenshaw figures he's 
lost about $20,000. So the "R" rated movies return this week. Crenshaw 
said he had lots of vocal support, but people just didn't show up.
