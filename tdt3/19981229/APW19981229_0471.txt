Two U.S.-based Chinese dissidents who sneaked back into China were 
caught by police and sentenced without trial to three years of forced 
labor, China's Foreign Ministry said Tuesday. In the first official 
word on the whereabouts of Zhang Lin and Wei Quanbao since they slipped 
into China seven weeks ago, the ministry said police arrested them 
Nov. 12 in the southern city of Guangzhou in a barber shop operating 
as a brothel. The ministry said the two men confessed to hiring prostitutes 
and evading border police by hiding inside a truck from Hong Kong 
on Nov. 11. For those alleged crimes, police sentenced both to three 
years of ``labor reeducation'' _ the maximum sentence police can order 
without a trial. Members of the men's families asked the Chinese Consulate 
in New York on Monday to help locate the pair, but consular officials 
were evasive, according to Chinese dissidents in New York. Meanwhile, 
in a letter penned in handcuffs from prison, another dissident defiantly 
protested as ``political persecution'' his 13-year sentence for trying 
to form an opposition party. Xu Wenli said he would not appeal his 
sentence out of contempt for the judicial system that prosecuted him 
last week. ``My so-called open trial was in truth nothing but a means 
of political persecution,'' Xu wrote in the letter, dated Monday and 
made available to foreign news organizations. ``First, I will not 
answer any questions. Second, I will not defend myself. Third, I will 
not appeal to a higher court. This is a silent protest against political 
persecution.'' Xu is among four dissidents tried and given lengthy 
sentences in the past two weeks in China's harshest crackdown on political 
dissent in two years. Xu, Qin Yongmin and Wang Youcai were sentenced 
to 13, 12 and 11 years respectively for trying to organize the China 
Democracy Party. Labor rights campaigner Zhang Shanguang was sentenced 
to 10 years Sunday for telling U.S. government-funded Radio Free Asia 
about a farmers protest. Xu is the oldest and most experienced campaigner 
of the four. His prison protest accused Communist Party leaders of 
protecting their vested interests by using China's legal system to 
defend one-party rule. ``Pluralism in the political sphere is historically 
inevitable. No individual or political party can prevent this,'' Xu 
wrote. ``History will judge us fairly,'' wrote Xu, who earlier spent 
12 years in prison, much of it in solitary confinement. His statement 
ended with the words ``penned in handcuffs'' and instructions to his 
lawyer to deliver copies to his wife and court authorities. In its 
statement, the Foreign Ministry identified Zhang and Wei as members 
of another party, the China Democratic Justice Party. It called the 
group a ``hostile foreign organization'' and said the two men ``engaged 
in activities to oppose the Chinese government while in the United 
States.'' The party, set up to unite dissidents overseas and in China, 
claimed earlier this year to have 100 members in as many as 10 branches 
in China. Zhang, 35, is a veteran democracy and labor rights campaigner. 
He served two stints in prisons and labor camps for a total of five 
years between 1989 and 1997, and went to the United States after his 
sentence ended last year. Wei, 38, went to the United States in 1994. 
Both reportedly have U.S. residence permits. Separately, jailed journalist 
Gao Yu has been moved from a prison near Beijing to another location, 
although there are no signs that she will be granted early release, 
her husband said Tuesday. Gao was moved because the Yanqing prison 
where she was held is shutting down its women's section, said Zhao 
Yuankang. He said Gao has heart problems and sometimes faints. She 
also has an allergy on her hands, so ``she can't pick up anything,'' 
he said. A former deputy editor of an economics weekly, Gao was arrested 
Oct. 2, 1993. She was tried in secret and sentenced to six years in 
prison for leaking state secrets, apparently for writing about Communist 
Party politics for a Hong Kong magazine.
