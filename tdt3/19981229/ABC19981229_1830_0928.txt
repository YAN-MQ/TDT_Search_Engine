"On the money" tonight -- eight straight days of gains in the Dow 
Jones industrial average. That hasn't happened since 1996. The Dow 
was up more than 4 points today to close at 9320. On the NASDAQ, stocks 
were up more than a point to close at 2181, a record high gain. The 
gains in the NASDAQ are being driven by the feeding frenzy over internet 
stocks. The housing market is booming. Sales of existing homes were 
up 2.7% last month, on pace to set a record for the year. There's 
also enormous demand for new homes. Builders will put up more square 
feet of housing this year than at any time in history.
