Khmer Rouge senior leader, Ku Sam Pan, says his state is in the hands 
of the Cambodian people, that only they can decide if he should be 
crimes against humanity. The rebel leader spoke to reporters Tuesday 
in Phnom Penh where he and fellow Khmer Rouge leader Nun Chia were 
greeted by Prime Minister Hun Sen. Ku Sam Pan did not respond to questions 
about his role in the genocidal regime. Human rights groups, foreign 
governments, and the Cambodian opposition have all urged that senior 
Khmer Rouge leaders be put on trial for crimes against humanity. Even 
Hun Sen was saying that they should stand trial before an international 
tribunal, but now he says he is opposed to a trial on genocide charges. 
Sixty-seven-year-old Ku Sam Pan was the nominal head of the Khmer 
Rouge, and 71-year-old Nun Chia was its ideological chief. Both were 
associates of the late Pol Pot, who founded the rebel group. He died 
last April.
