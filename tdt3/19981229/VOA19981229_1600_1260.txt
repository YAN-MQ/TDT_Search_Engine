National Basketball Association Commissioner David Stern has repeated 
the league's intention to cancel the season and has put the ball in 
the players' court. We've made our final offer. They've told us they 
reject it. They've made an offer that doesn't even come close to it, 
and they said they had nothing left, in effect. And we've duly reported 
that to our committee, and now we're heading for the vote on the 7th. 
But one day meeting in Denver, union chief Billy Hunter said Monday, 
he was not inclined to take anything to the membership for a vote. 
He says canceling the season will also hurt the owners. And say that 
the down side is severe for us. It's just as severe and grave for 
the owners. The difference is that they may be independently wealthy, 
and they may be able to survive it, but I don't think that they'll 
be able to put a league back together. Stern says meanwhile he thinks 
it is likely the season will officially be canceled January 7th. That 
would be a dramatic turnaround for a league that had never lost a 
game to a work stoppage before this year. And that's sports.
