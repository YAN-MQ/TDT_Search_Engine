Buoying the hope that the Catskills may someday be transformed from 
their Borscht Belt past into a gambling destination of the future, 
a key federal agency has endorsed an Indian tribe's proposal to operate 
a $500 million casino at the Monticello Raceway. In a memo dated Dec. 
9, Brenda Bennett, acting director of the Bureau of Indian Affairs' 
eastern office, wrote that the proposal tendered by the St. Regis 
Mohawks of northern New York State ``satisfies all requirements'' 
and would ``positively impact the tribe and the surrounding community'' 
by creating 3,000 new jobs. The memo said the casino would eventually 
result in ``4.4 million day trips to the area, inducing spending outside 
the proposed casino of $337 million.'' In so doing, the memo concludes, 
the casino ``will revitalize the area's tourism industry and provide 
the impetus for additional tourist-related developments.'' The plan 
still must be approved by BIA headquarters in Washington. Then it 
must be approved by Gov. George Pataki, who to this point has not 
disclosed his leanings. ``The governor recognizes that gambling might 
be a valuable option for resort areas like the Catskills,'' said Charles 
Deister, a spokesman for Pataki. ``But we're going to have to wait 
and see what the federal decision is.'' Philip Tarbell, the Mohawks' 
former legislative chairman, who helped to draft the casino plan, 
said, ``I think it's a crucial step because the central office very 
seldom overrules the area office.'' Neither the Washington office 
nor the eastern office, in Arlington, Va., returned calls seeking 
comment on the agency's endorsement, which was reported Tuesday in 
The Daily News. The plan calls for the construction of a 700,000-square-foot 
casino and convention center at Monticello Raceway, under a partnership 
between the Mohawks and three New York developers _ Watermark Investments, 
America Towers Partners and Alpha Hospitality. Unlike many other tribes 
that offer gambling, the Mohawks are planning to operate a casino 
far from their home territory, which is several hundred miles to the 
north. The casino would be built on a piece of land that would be 
placed in trust, and not subject to taxes. The tribe would share its 
revenues with various local governments.
