Reacting to the latest U.S.-Iraq clash, the Russian Foreign Ministry 
on Tuesday called on both sides to show ``restraint'' but stopped 
short of condemning the U.S. action. ``It's necessary to show common 
sense and composure in order to overcome the crisis,'' Foreign Ministry 
spokesman Vladimir Rakhmanin said at a briefing. On Monday, U.S. warplanes 
fired missiles and precision-guided bombs to strike an anti-aircraft 
site in northern Iraq that launched three missiles at U.S. jets on 
patrol, the Pentagon said. Iraq reported four soldiers killed. The 
Pentagon says U.S. and British patrols in the ``no-fly'' zones over 
Iraq will continue in an atmosphere of increased tension after the 
incident. Rakhmanin said that the creation of ``no-fly'' zones hadn't 
been authorized by the United Nations, but he steered clear of direct 
criticism of the U.S. action. Moscow denounced U.S. and British air 
raids against Iraq earlier this month in harsh rhetoric reminiscent 
of the Cold War and briefly recalled its ambassadors to Washington 
and London. Russian officials have since changed their tone, stressing 
they want to have good relations with the United States and Britain. 
Moscow, which is owed billions of dollars by Iraq, has pushed for 
the early lifting of the U.N. sanctions against Iraq while urging 
its long-time ally to comply with the U.N. resolutions.
