Trading in the new European currency, the euro, is expected to get 
off to a slow start in its first day in Asia, but dealers there expect 
it to strengthen as the year goes on. Trading in the euro will begin 
in Australia early on January 4th local time, or 18 hours universal 
time Sunday. Robert Salomon, economist of the private Brookings Institution 
in Washington says the common currency will mean more competition 
in Europe, as well as for U.S. exporters. Nobody else has the same 
currency you have, you're more likely to trade with them, buy from 
them, sell to them, seek them out as a customer, so on. I think trade 
will increase which means more competition among the European countries, 
which will only make them more competitive. And that will provide 
in turn some competition for American exporters. The European Central 
Bank says low inflation and steady monetary policy will insure a smooth 
launch for the euro, and the Central Bank says it will act to counter 
inaccessibly fast shift to the new unit. Dealers in Asia expect the 
euro will move in a range of less than one percent around 1.175 to 
the dollar on the first day of trading.
