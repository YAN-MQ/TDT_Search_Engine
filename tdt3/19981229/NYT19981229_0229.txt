NATIONAL FORECAST Bitterly cold air will pour from southern Canada 
across the Great Lakes into the interior Northeast on Wednesday. Locally 
heavy snow squalls will lash areas near the southern and eastern shores 
of the Great Lakes, especially during the first half of the day. Snow 
showers will also be common near the northern and central Appalachians, 
particularly along west-facing slopes. Winds from the northwest averaging 
15 to 25 miles an hour with frequent gusts over 35 miles hour will 
intensify the chill of the day. East of the Appalachians, readings 
will be near or above freezing at dawn, but temperatures will fall 
steadily during the day. Ample sunshine will develop in the Middle 
Atlantic states, but plenty of clouds will linger farther north. Heavy 
snow will gradually end over northern Maine, however, snow showers 
and flurries will persist in the hilly terrain of New England. The 
Southeast will turn brisk and chilly in the wake of a cold front. 
Despite ample sunshine afternoon temperatures will average around 
10 degrees below the seasonal average over interior sections. A broken 
band of snow will streak from the northern Plains toward the central 
Mississippi Valley in advance of a moisture-starved low pressure area. 
Up to a few inches of snow may accumulate in parts of the southern 
Missouri Valley by Wednesday night. Onshore breezes will promote some 
coastal showers in the Pacific Northwest. Intermittent snow will fall 
along the west-facing slopes from the northern Cascades to the Bitterroots. 
Meanwhile, the Southwest will be mild and dry. Focus: Snow Drought 
The nation's capital is not a snowy place. On average, about 18 inches 
falls each year. But recently, the absence of snow has reached record 
proportions. On Dec. 23, 0.4 inches of snow fell, ending a string 
of 378 days without measurable snow at the observation site at National 
Airport. The previous record was 321 days ending on Feb. 22, 1973. 
It has now been almost 23 months since the last time there has been 
an inch of snow on a single day which also is a record for lack of 
snow. A major winter storm will bring the threat of some snow, ice 
and rain to Washington this weekend.
