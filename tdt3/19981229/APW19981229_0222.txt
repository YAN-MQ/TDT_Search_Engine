More than 100 illegal refugees fleeing violence or hardship at home 
reached Italy's southern shores in rubber dinghies Tuesday, police 
said. Encouraged by calm seas, hundreds of immigrants from Kosovo, 
Iraq and northern Africa have been making the journey across the Adriatic 
in recent days. Renewed fighting between Serbs and ethnic Albanian 
rebels in Kosovo also has sent the number of ethnic Albanian arrivals 
soaring. At least 27 of Tuesday's arrivals were from Kosovo. The 101 
would-be immigrants were taken to detention centers in the region 
of Puglia, at the ``heel'' of the Italian peninsula, near where the 
refugees reached shore. Authorities must now decide whether to grant 
the immigrants residency documents or send them back home. Police 
said they detained two Albanians suspected of smuggling immigrants 
and drugs across the Adriatic. Most would-be immigrant see Italy as 
a gateway to relatives and jobs in northern Europe and pay smugglers 
large sums of money to make the trip. To avoid being caught by navy 
and coast guard patrols, the smugglers often abandon their charges 
in the seas off the Italian coast and some refugees die trying to 
swim ashore. On Monday, Italy renewed complaints that Albania was 
doing little to stop the exodus.
