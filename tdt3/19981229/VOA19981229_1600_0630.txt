Ugandan president, Yoweri Museveni and President Pasteur Bizimungu 
of Rwanda have met in a Ugandan border town to discuss the conflict 
in Congo-Kinshasa. Both have troops backing Congolese rebels seeking 
to overthrow President Laurent Kabilla. The two met amid unconfirmed 
reports that their soldiers in Congo-Kinshasa had turned against each 
other after backing separate rebel groups. Officials from both countries 
deny the reports by Uganda's "Monitor" newspaper.
