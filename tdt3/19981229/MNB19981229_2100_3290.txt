When we come back, we will take our first look at the Wednesday morning 
newspapers around the country. Let's take a look at the morning papers 
beginning with "U.S.A. today." Murder rate down in 1998. The murder 
rate in the nation's 10 largest cities dropped by more than 12% in 
1998 according to a survey conducted each year by the newspaper. That 
would make the fifth year in a row the murder rate has gone down. 
The general crime rate also continues to fall. Miami Herald, gang 
war has erupted there. The assassin in this drive-by shooting was 
apparently so eager to fire he didn't even roll down his car window 
as he erupted and his weapon went off. Denver post, two stories of 
note. The public library in the suburb of englewood will give a card 
to children surfing the Internet. The card knows the age of the card 
Holder. It's called a net nanny and it limits kids to about 5,000 
pre-approved kid friendly sites. A lot of parents would hack off an 
arm to have it. The two twin polar bears born Monday at the Denver 
zoo, they give cute a New definition. They are -- the parents are 
oloo and Olaf. The parents who gave birth to abandoned twins in 1994. 
We will get pictures as soon as they hold their first photo-op at 
the denver zoo. Before we go tonight here is Jane pauley. Thanks, 
Brian. Tonight on "time & again," the Clinton everybody likes. First 
daughter Chelsea Clinton. She's grown up before our eyes and during 
the controversy surrounding her father with uncommon dignity. In raising 
Chelsea, Bill and Hillary got it right. With a little advice from 
Jacqueline Kennedy Onassis. Chelsea Clinton coming of age in the White 
House up next on "time & again." Again, "time & again" hosted by Jane 
pauley next up on MSNBC. That's going to do it for our broadcast for 
this Tuesday night. We hope to see you back here at this same time 
tomorrow for the Wednesday edition. I hope to see you on "NBC nightly 
news" from here in New York. Growing up in public in the biggest fish 
bowl in the world. A look at first teenager Chelsea Clinton. I'm Jane 
pauley and this is "time and again." Hello and welcome to "time and 
again." Growing up isn't easy but try doing it in the White House 
with the leader of the free world as your dad and secret service agents 
as your constant companions. Then throw in a scandal that opens your 
parents' public livesthe problem to be solved and not create more 
problems. Some advice perhaps for the U.S. Senate now thinking about
