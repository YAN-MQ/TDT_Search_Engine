A quiet night is a good night for the seven surviving chukwu octuplets. 
All seven babies are in critical but stable condition. Their mother 
has improved and could go home tomorrow. Nkem chukwu has been able 
to touch her children, but she has not been able to hold them yet. 
Three babies are on ventilators and the other four are getting assistance 
breathing with supplemental oxygen. The babies' doctor says she is 
encouraged. The smallest of the octuplets died Sunday from heart and 
lung failure.
