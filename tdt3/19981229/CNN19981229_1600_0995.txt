'tis the season for optimism among American consumers. I'm Beverly 
Schuch in New York with this edition of "Dollars & Sense." The conference 
board says its index of consumer sentiment is holding the month steady 
after a strong showing in November. That's a good sign the U.S. economy 
will remain strong as it heads into 1999. A separate report shows 
sales of previously owned homes rose 2.7% in november. And that's 
a stronger showing than had been expected. And it puts last month's 
total sales just below the record level reached back in July.
