President Glafcos Clerides said Tuesday that he was canceling plans 
to deploy controversial, Russian-made missiles in this island nation. 
His decision was announced in a statement issued at the end of a meeting 
of the policy-making Greek Cypriot National Council, which is composed 
of political party leaders. The move likely will reduce tensions with 
Turkey _ which had threatened to block the missiles' deployment _ 
but will add to Cleridis' political troubles since he reversed his 
own pledge to put the missiles in place. Other Greek Cypriot leaders 
insist the SS-300 anti-aircraft missiles be deployed to counter Turkey's 
defense of the Turkish Cypriot northern part of the divided island. 
Participants at the meeting of party leaders said there were intense 
disagreements and that, in the end, Clerides took responsibility himself 
for canceling the deployment. Clerides admitted ``that there was lack 
of unanimity'' at the meeting. He said he would now negotiate with 
the Russian government for the deployment of the missiles on the Greek 
island of Crete. The announcement in Nicosia followed Clerides' talks 
in the Greek capital Athens earlier in the day with Greek Premier 
Costas Simitis and Greece's defense and foreign ministers. Cyprus 
has been divided into a Greek Cypriot-controlled south and a Turkish-occupied 
north since 1974, when Turkey invaded after a short-lived coup by 
supporters of union with Greece. The United States and NATO have criticized 
Clerides' decision two years ago to purchase the missiles, fearing 
conflict between NATO members Turkey and Greece. Athens has a defense 
pact with the Greek Cypriots. Clerides denied his decision was ``the 
result of submission to pressures, threats and blackmail.'' ``It was 
simply a the result of the responsible evaluation ... of the current 
conditions and factors affecting the national cause,'' he said. The 
outcome of Tuesday's meeting could affect the survival of Clerides' 
government. The Socialist EDEK party, which holds the ministries of 
defense and education, has warned it will withdraw from the government 
if the missiles are not deployed as planned. Other opposition parties 
maintain Clerides should resign, following his promise to do so if 
the missiles are not deployed. The Cypriot president had said previously 
that he would cancel the missiles' deployment only if Turkey accepted 
his demilitarization proposal or if there was progress in the U.N.-sponsored 
talks for the reunification of the island. A U.N. Security Council 
resolution adopted unanimously last week called for a reduction of 
weapons and troops in Cyprus and the resumption of the talks. On Tuesday, 
the European Union applauded the cancellation of the missile deployment. 
Austrian Foreign Minister Wolfgang Schuessel _ whose country holds 
the rotating EU presidency _ said the decision represented ``a great 
success for quiet diplomacy'' by the EU, Britain and the United States.
