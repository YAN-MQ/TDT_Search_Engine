Sen. John McCain of Arizona plans to announce on Wednesday that he 
will form an exploratory committee to begin soliciting money for a 
presidential bid, a move that his advisers say makes it all but certain 
that he will seek the Republican nomination. McCain is the first in 
a wave of Republican candidates who will signal their candidacies. 
His advisers said McCain was out of the country on vacation and would 
announce his actual candidacy in several weeks. While McCain has for 
months openly toyed with running and has traveled to early primary 
states like New Hampshire to gauge reaction, his plans had not been 
as definite as those of several other prospective contenders _ including 
Lamar Alexander, the former Tennessee governor, and Steve Forbes, 
the publishing magnate _ who have made no secret of their designs 
on the White House. Several of his advisers said McCain had been weighing 
whether he wanted to endure scrutiny into his personal life; they 
said he decided that the White House was probably worth the risk and 
possible unpleasantness. Former Sen. Warren Rudman of New Hampshire, 
who is co-chairman of the McCain exploratory committee with Sen. Jon 
Kyl of Arizona, said McCain's ultimate candidacy ``is likely but is 
not a certainty.'' ``I'm not going to comment on the other candidates,'' 
Rudman said, ``other than that I don't think any of them have the 
world view and the tough, real world experience of John McCain.'' 
McCain, who is 62 and has served in the Senate since 1987, stands 
out from many other prospects because he has a reputation as a consensus 
builder who reaches across party lines to champion issues that are 
not always popular in his party such as the tobacco bill and campaign 
finance legislation. But despite his conservative bona fides and record 
as a foe of abortion, McCain's close relationships with Democrats 
could cost him some support in his party's primaries, which are dominated 
by hard-edged partisans. His supporters note that McCain has a most 
compelling personal story: He was imprisoned for more than five years 
after his plane was shot down in the Vietnam War. Many Republicans 
believe that the senator's biggest liability is his lack of a national 
base to collect contributions. ``Obviously, to be competitive, we 
need somewhere in the $15- to $20 million dollar range,'' said John 
Weaver, a San Antonio strategist who was political director of Sen. 
Phil Gramm's unsuccessful presidential campaign in 1996; he plans 
to fill the same job for McCain. ``His biggest danger right now is 
the ability to raise the entry fee money,'' said Scott Reed, who was 
the campaign manager for Bob Dole, the Republican nominee in 1996. 
``He does not have a natural fund-raising base. He's not like Dole, 
who had a house file of 100,000 names.'' But, Reed said, McCain has 
``the potential to be a top-tier candidate'' because ``he has an interesting 
background of foreign affairs, of cutting government pork and of populist 
issues.'' McCain's advisers said the senator may not need as much 
money as other contenders because he is nationally prominent and could 
draw publicity because he is popular with reporters, who find him 
direct and accessible. ``Our consensus, right or wrong, is he probably 
doesn't have to raise as much as the other candidates because he is 
very well known and he has a very distinctive record,'' Rudman said. 
``And, the truth is, members of the press have an admiration of this 
guy.'' Perhaps wanting to weigh how the issue could play in the primaries, 
McCain has kept an uncharacteristically low profile in the impeachment 
matter now before the Senate. He has not stated his position about 
a Senate trial. ``I've turned down at least 500 _ maybe six or seven 
hundred requests to go on talk shows on this issue,'' McCain said 
in an interview several days ago. He said impeachment was the one 
issue he did not want to touch, explaining, ``If it's Iraq I'm glad 
to respond. I'm about as big a media hound as anyone.'' The senator's 
aides said one reason for their timing of McCain's announcement was 
to upstage his rivals. Sen. John Ashcroft of Missouri, for one, is 
expected on Tuesday to be the first Republican to deliver his formal 
announcement of candidacy, in Springfield, Mo. McCain has lined up 
several advisers for his expected bid: Greg Stevens will be media 
consultant; Bill MacInturff, the pollster, and Carla Eudy will be 
finance director, a post she held in the Gramm campaign. Other advisers 
include Kenneth Duberstein and Michael Deaver, veteran Republican 
insiders who had prominent posts in the Reagan White House, and former 
Rep. Vin Weber of Minnesota. Howard Opinsky will be the spokesman, 
a job he held in the Gramm campaign. Although McCain was Gramm's national 
chairman in 1996, McCain's advisers went out of their way to distance 
themselves from the Gramm campaign. The Gramm drive had showed great 
promise and fund-raising prowess in 1995 but quickly fizzled once 
the primaries began. McCain's advisers contended that Gov. George 
W. Bush of Texas, who leads the Republican field in early polls, now 
had many more ties to Gramm. ``The Lion's share of the Gramm people 
have gone with George Bush,'' Opinsky said.
