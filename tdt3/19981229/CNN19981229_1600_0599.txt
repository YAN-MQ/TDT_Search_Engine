Many people traveling by air this holiday season are facing the same 
problem -- too few seats on the plane. Lori Waffenschmidt has more. 
I had a confirmed seat, and there was no room on the plane. Airlines 
say they overbook flights, because they expect no-shows. But if there 
aren't enough seats, they can bump you whether you agree to it or 
not. The department of transportation says -- but others find it frustrating. 
If I buy a ticket, I like to be assured that I'm going to get on the 
flight on the plane. I don't agree with it. I don't think it's ethically 
right. Knowing a few strategies could help you avoid being bumped. 
First, show up on time. Airlines can bump you if you arrive at the 
gate past check-in time -- usually 10 to 20 minutes before the scheduled 
departure on domestic flights. And if you get to the airport and see 
your flight has been delayed, resist the temptation to take your time 
getting to the gate. You have to still check in at the check-in deadline 
that was originally specified even if the plane is taking off late. 
The more you've paid for your ticket, the more likely you'll make 
it onto the plane. Nowadays, they are starting to bump people according 
to the ticket price. If you've done everything right and still get 
bumped, know your rights. If they can get you to your final destination 
within that one to two-hour period of time, they don't owe you anything. 
But if they can't, that's where the department of transportation regulations 
kick in. "rules of the air" published on the Internet at onetravel.com 
lists rules and compensation for involuntary bumping. Lori Waffenschmidt, 
CNN, reporting.
