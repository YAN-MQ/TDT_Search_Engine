Wall Street is giving the thumbs up to a tough restructuring plan 
for auto partsmaker, SPX. Charles Molineaux has details. Investors 
applauded SPX's latest moves Monday. Its stock quickly jumped $3 a 
share on news the company plans to shut down 25 manufacturing, sales 
and administrative locations, cut 1,000 jobs and take a quarter billion 
fourth-quarter charge. Analysts say the changes represent a stronger-than-expected 
plan for streamlining at general signal, which SPX acquired in October. 
It's about time. And it was a company that was just not very efficient. 
And they're starting to take -- they're only starting to really take 
a lot of cost out of the business and trying to make general signal 
a better supplier to its customers and a company that can create more 
value importantly for its shareholders. And industry watchers say 
SPX is only starting what is likely to be a series of acquisitions, 
like general signal, and its unsuccessful bid to buy eclan early this 
year. And several other big players in auto parts in particular and 
industrial manufacturing in general now also stand out as likely acquirers. 
Dana, federal mogul, lear corporation. I would also say that other 
names to come to mind would be Johnson controls, TRW. You're seeing 
the emergence, I would argue, of probably what will be five to possibly 
seven major companies involved in the auto parts industry, not just 
in north America but also worldwide. By grabbing general signal, analysts 
say SPX is expanding its emphasis, from car parts into general manufacturing. 
And this latest round of efficiencies gives it a strong position to 
make that move, with the confidence of the market behind it. Charles 
Molineaux, "CNN Financial News," New York.
