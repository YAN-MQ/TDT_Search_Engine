An air force general's comments to a parliamentary committee that 
it is ``not natural'' for women to be pilots has sparked outrage among 
female lawmakers. Legislator Marina Solodkin, who chairs the Committee 
on the Status of Women, said Tuesday that the comments showed that 
the air force has not changed its attitude toward women despite some 
reforms. Last year, Israel's Supreme Court ordered the air force to 
change its policy of training only men as pilots and to admit women 
to the course. One of the new recruits completed a combat navigation 
course Tuesday, the first woman to reach such an advanced stage of 
training. The latest controversy began Monday when Brig. Gen. Gil 
Regev told Solodkin's committee that women don't have the stamina 
to be pilots and that the job interferes with child-rearing. ``I'm 
concerned about the survival rate of the female soldiers,'' Solodkin 
quoted Regev as saying. ``I also think it's not natural for there 
to be female pilots.'' Regev was not available for comment Tuesday 
and the army spokesman's office said only that the air force is implementing 
the Supreme Court decision allowing women to train as pilots. ``On 
Thursday, for the first time, a female candidate will successfully 
complete the course,'' the spokesman said. After her graduation on 
Thursday, Second Lt. Sari, 21 _ a native of the well-appointed Tel 
Aviv suburb of Raanana _ will fly F-16's in northern Israel, Israel 
TV said. It is army policy to only release the first names of combat 
pilots. At a ceremony Tuesday to mark completion of a navigation course, 
Sari marched alongside her male colleagues in air force khaki, her 
brown hair neatly tied into a single braid. Other women began the 
rigorous pilot course with her, but she was the only one to complete 
it successfully, Israel TV said.
