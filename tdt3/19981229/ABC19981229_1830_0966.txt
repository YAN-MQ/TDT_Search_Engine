For many months now, Americans have been relieved to know that crime 
rates have fallen across the nation. Many people no longer fear big-city 
crime the way they used to. But the picture is not completely rosy. 
Just where you'd least expect it out in the countryside, robberies 
are rising. ABC's Bob Woodruff reports. In this little country store 
three years ago, Norman Herndon's wife Joan was murdered by an armed 
robber. She was working alone and there were no witnesses. I'm trying 
not to cry, but I still can't talk about it to nobody. That murder 
marked the beginning of a terrible trend in rural virginia. In the 
last three years, ten shopkeepers in country stores have been killed 
during armed robberies. And nationwide, as most crimes are falling, 
robberies in rural areas are up, last year almost 11%. So, in Virginia, 
police are trying to change the way country store owners do business. 
They believe it is largely the physical layout of these stores that 
makes them a target -- too many places for criminals to hide. Lock 
that door. Too few precautions. Put a mirror in that corner. 7-11, 
the national chain, recognized this problem more than two decades 
ago, so they opened up the layout of their stores, they lowered the 
shelves and they added more lights. Most of the cash is deposited 
into a computerized drop-safe that cannot be opened by the clerk. 
Security cameras are always on, and the windows in the front are kept 
clean of advertisements so that clerks are in full view from the street. 
This program has cut 7-11's robbery rate by 70% since 1976. Although 
small, independent stores lack the money of large chains, trooper 
robert hill says even minor improvements will help. What you have 
to do is very simple. Clean the area up, lock the door. It doesn't 
cost you anything but a few minutes of your time, and that could save 
your life. After his wife was killed, Norman Herndon never made those 
changes to his store. He just closed it down. The country, he says, 
is not the peaceful place it once was. Bob Woodruff, ABC News, Buckingham 
county, Virginia.
