Former U.S. Senate Majority Leader George Mitchell promised on Tuesday 
a ``thorough and prompt'' investigation into claims that bribes helped 
Salt Lake City win the 2002 Winter Olympic Games. After his initial 
meeting with members of a special commission investigating the allegations, 
Mitchell noted that the panel has to file its report with the U.S. 
Olympic Committee by Feb. 28. Mitchell said the investigation would 
focus on the circumstances surrounding the selection of Salt Lake 
City by the International Olympic Committee. But he said ``as important, 
if not more important'' will be for the panel to make recommendations 
on improvements in the bidding process to ensure ``it is fair and 
above reproach.'' Past and present officials of the Salt Lake City 
Olympic Committee have acknowledged that they gave members of the 
international committee gifts and paid college tuition to some of 
the committee's relatives prior to the city being selected for the 
Winter Games. ``I entered this process with a completely open mind 
both as to the practices and standards which have been utilized in 
the past and those which ought to be utilized,'' he said. ``We owe 
to them (the athletes) the obligation to make certain that the games 
in which they participate are in fact and are perceived as totally 
fair and above reproach.'' The allegations also are being investigated 
by the Justice Department. The International Olympic Committee also 
has an investigation under way. The IOC is in danger of losing a special 
tax concession worth about dlrs 1.4 million a year from the Swiss 
government because of the corruption scandal, a Swiss paper reported 
Tuesday. The exemption from the Swiss value-added tax was granted 
to the IOC by the Swiss government in September. But the lower house 
of the Swiss parliament may review that exemption late this month 
for the Lausanne-based IOC, the Geneva daily Le Temps reported. Mitchell 
said that in the initial meeting in Washington Tuesday, the five commission 
members, appointed by the U.S. Olympic Committee, ``established for 
ourselves a process which we will use to conduct an investigation 
that is at once thorough and prompt.'' Mitchell said the commission's 
objective was ``to encourage and enhance and live up to'' the ideals 
of the Olympic movement. He described the panel's effort as ``a review 
of the circumstances surrounding the Salt Lake City bidding process'' 
as well as to ``make recommendations to the U.S. Olympic Committee 
for its use in future bidding processes, to try to make as certain 
as humanly possibly that those processes are fair and above reproach.'' 
Accusations of scandal and bribery have rocked the Olympic movement, 
prompting the IOC to call for the first inquiry, followed by Salt 
Lake organizers early this month asking its independent ethics panel 
to investigate. The IOC expects to wrap up its own probe by Jan. 23. 
Salt Lake organizers, meanwhile, have said its ethics board would 
report its findings no later than Feb. 11. Any delays would likely 
irritate sponsors who pay an increasing percentage of the multimillion-dollar 
sports budget and have told Olympic officials that they want the controversy 
handled swiftly. Olympic officials have been contacting sponsors to 
assure them that action is being taken to maintain the Olympics image 
of high ideals and ethics.
