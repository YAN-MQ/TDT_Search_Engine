This is Orelon Sidney with your "CNN Headline News Weather" update. 
Two low-pressure storms and two cold fronts will be moving across 
the eastern United States with extensive snow fall for the Great Lakes 
into New England. Some coastal areas could see rain early until the 
second front passes through and brings in cooler temperatures and 
a chance of frozen precipitation. An Alberta clipper will move down 
the Rockies into the plains states as we head into Wednesday with 
snow showers possible from near Paducah, Kentucky, back into the northern 
Rockies. A pacific front will keep things wet across most of the Oregon 
and washington coasts. High temperatures will range from below zero 
readings in the northern plains to the 50s, 60s and some 70s across 
the south and the southwest. 80s in southern Florida. The extended 
forecast includes rain and wind on new year's eve across the west 
with snow showers expected for the Great Lakes. The trough starts 
to flatten out to the west. So you'll see mostly cold temperatures 
in the north and warmer temperatures in the south with a chance of 
thunderstorms heading eastward as we move into Saturday. The extended 
forecast for more than 7,000 cities is at CNN.com.
