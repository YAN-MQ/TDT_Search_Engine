Osso buco, the glorious Italian dish of fork-tender veal shanks in 
a natural sauce, takes time but almost no attention in my streamlined 
version. In the two hours or so it takes to cook, you'll need to stand 
over it no more than 20 minutes. Even better, the meat holds up well 
enough overnight for 90 percent of the cooking to be done while you're 
watching television the night before you serve it. The key to osso 
buco lies not so much in the flavors you add but in the main ingredient 
and how carefully you handle it. The ``milk-fed'' veal sold in supermarkets 
and most butcher shops remains a product of enforced confinement and 
formula feeding. The alternative, sold by natural-food stores and 
some supermarkets and butchers, is ``natural'' veal, from calves that 
may have been raised at the mother's side or at least allowed some 
room to roam before slaughter. It is darker, a little more intense 
in flavor and perhaps a bit tougher. I actually prefer the latter, 
although my preference may be influenced by guilt. As for the shanks 
themselves, the decision is easier: Buy center slices, about 1{ inches 
thick. Slices from the narrow end have very little meat; those from 
the thick end contain little or no marrow. Careful handling means 
slow cooking. After browning the shanks and adding a liquid, cook 
them covered at a bare simmer. Use kitchen tongs to turn them every 
30 minutes or so, making sure each side spends some time bathed in 
the flavorful cooking liquid that becomes the sauce. OSSO BUCO Time: 
About 2 hours 1 tablespoon olive oil 4 center-cut slices veal shank, 
2 pounds or more Salt and freshly ground black pepper to taste 3 or 
4 cloves garlic, lightly mashed and peeled 4 anchovy fillets 1 cup 
dry white wine, chicken or beef stock, or water 2 teaspoons butter, 
optional. 1. Heat a large, deep skillet over medium-high heat for 
a couple of minutes. Add the oil, swirl it around, and pour out any 
excess. Add the veal slices and cook until nicely browned on the first 
side, about 5 minutes. (For even browning, you can rotate the slices, 
but try not to disturb them too much.) Turn and brown the other side. 
2. When the second side is just about completely browned, sprinkle 
with a little salt and pepper and add the garlic and anchovies to 
the pan. Cook, stirring a little, until the anchovies dissolve and 
the garlic browns, about 2 minutes. Add the liquid and let it bubble 
away for about a minute. 3. Turn the heat to low and cover the skillet. 
Five minutes later, check to see that the mixture is simmering _ just 
a few bubbles appearing at once _ and adjust the heat accordingly. 
Cook until the meat is very tender and pulling away from the bone, 
at least 90 minutes and probably somewhat more; turn the slices every 
half-hour or so. (When the meat is tender, you may turn off the heat 
and refrigerate the dish for up to 24 hours; reheat gently before 
proceeding.) 4. Remove the meat to a warm platter and turn the heat 
to high. Boil the sauce until it becomes thick and glossy, about 5 
minutes. Stir in the butter if you like, and serve the meat with the 
sauce spooned over it. Yield: 4 servings.
