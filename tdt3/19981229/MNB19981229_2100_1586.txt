Been talking all day about the severe weather across the country. 
It is making news as well here in the New York area tonight where 
advisories are posted. Let's take a look at the national picture. 
We go to New York, meteorologist Janice huff. Janice? Hi, Brian. The 
news about the Arctic express is that it's fast approaching the Great 
Lakes and northeast tonight. An Arctic front is moving through the 
northeastern portion of the country tonight. Bitter cold temperatures 
will return. They've already entered into portions of the northern 
plains. Meanwhile the warm weather will be suppressed way south into 
the Florida keys over the next several days. Look at the temperatures. 
It's minus 14 right now in international falls with the wind chill, 
feels like it's about 40 below. 14 in Chicago. Meanwhile it remains 
mild across the pacific northwest. Temperatures in the 50's around 
Seattle and more rain and flooding and half the snow pack has melted 
in some areas due to the mild air and the rain. Flooding continues. 
Snowing across Idaho and parts of Montana. Also snowing in parts of 
New England and the northeast tonight. Here comes the bitter cold. 
Teens, below zero, single digits into Iowa, 20's down around Birmingham 
tonight. Highs only in the 30's there and Atlanta today maybe 40. 
20's in the northeast. Warm over the southwest and over south Florida 
with 70's. Miami, still nice, 74. Some snow possible in Boston. Temperatures 
will be dropping from this 40 by the afternoon. Only seven in Minneapolis. 
Rain continues in Seattle and so will the flooding. That is not expected 
to change even into new year's day. The pattern remains the same. 
Warm temperatures across the southwest into California. South Florida, 
freezing rain is expected to develop over the mid mississippi valley 
on new year's day and the cold air continues to invade the northeast 
and New England with highs only in the teens and 20's. Those are the 
cold facts, Brian. That's the forecast. Now back to you downstairs. 
Janice, thank you very much.
