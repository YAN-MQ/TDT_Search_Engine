Severe weather is making life miserable across much of the United 
States. From crippling ice storms to winter floods, Allan Dodds Frank 
looks at the dangerous situations. In Oregon, a dairy community along 
the pacific coast, flooding on the wilson river split the town in 
half. The coast guard came to the rescue ferrying nurses to the local 
hospital. The coast guard brought me across by vehicle to this point. 
Now I'm going to be taking a boat the rest of the way across, then 
an ambulance will pick me up to take me to the hospital. 60 miles 
from Seattle, mountain passes were closed stranding 4,000 most ritzs. 
I figured by the time I got here, it would be clear. Sometimes it 
doesn't take too long. I found out differently. In northern California, 
fog was the wet blanket. Cutting vis act at airports to less than 
a hundred feet. In Denver, travelers going from Chicago to San Francisco 
were stranded. We were on our way to San Francisco and two hours into 
the flight, they came on the loud speaker and said, I'm sorry we have 
bad news. Your flight is San Francisco is cancelled. We're stopping 
in Denver. And that was it. There is a foot of snow in Idaho and it's 
windy in Wyoming where gusts approached 75 miles an hour. Along the 
east coast and in the south, power was gradually being restored in 
areas slammed by ice storms during the Christmas week. In Williamsburg, 
Virginia, the sound of ice cracking resounded. There as well as in 
Alabama and Tennessee, tens of thousands of people are waiting for 
telephone and cable TV and power to be restored. While relief is coming 
to most areas, it is belated comfort to those living through the worst 
storm yet this winter.
