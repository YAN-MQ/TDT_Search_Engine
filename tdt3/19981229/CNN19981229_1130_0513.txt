I'm meteorologist Dave Hennen with your "CNN Headline News Weather." 
It's going to continue to be wet in the pacific northwest, keeping 
the rainfall along the coast and snow in higher elevations. Cold air 
will be building in through the midwest dropping temperatures and 
creating dangerous windchills today. By tomorrow, that high into the 
southeast, much colder air will be filtering into the southeast as 
well. 50s and 60s in the southeast. Temperatures falling tomorrow 
as they will be today through the upper midwest where we'll see some 
below zero high temperatures in Minnesota and on through North Dakota. 
Thursday, we're looking for snow showers through the lakes and rain 
and more mountain snow is expected in the pacific northwest. It will 
be a snowy new year's leave in the northwest through the Rockies. 
On new year's day, we'll find showers back through the midwest. As 
you head further north, that will be changing to snow. Thunderstorms 
are possible into the southern Mississippi river valley. On Saturday, 
showers and storms in the southeast and snow through the mideast.
