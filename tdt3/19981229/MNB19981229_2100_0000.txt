What we now know about what awaits the president when his trial goes 
to the senate amid continuing talk of a deal of some sort in Washington. 
We'll be joined tonight by one of the men managing the case and another 
who voted no in the house. You cannot turn on the television these 
days without seeing at least one of them, those commercials for those 
10-10 numbers. Whether it's 321, 9000, they all say they save you 
money but there's something you should know before dialing 10-10 anything. 
The western front tonight. Anything but quiet. Awful weather in parts 
of the country and awful timing as millions of americans get set for 
more holiday travel. We'll look at where the worst of it is tonight. 
And the year that appeared to be the very worst of times, the war, 
the assassinations, the images that made up 1968. Tonight a look back 
30 years later at what could have been through the eyes of those who 
were there to watch it unfold. And good Tuesday evening to you from 
New York. We'll be covering all of those headline stories here. We 
will also have a new view of yesterday's air strikes in Iraq. The 
fight over the value of the Nixon presidency. Word of something else 
to worry about as 2000 approaches and our first look here this evening 
at the morning newspapers across the country for wednesday morning.
