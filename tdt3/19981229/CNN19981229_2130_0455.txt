The pacific northwest is getting more rain today. Driving rain and 
melting snow already have triggered floods and mudslides in Oregon 
and Washington. Scores of people have been evacuated from their homes. 
And parts of U.S. highway 101 are still closed. On the other side 
of the country, the effects of the Christmas eve ice storm are still 
being felt in the south. Thousands of people in Virginia, Tennessee 
and Alabama and Mississippi are still without power. Utility officials 
say everyone should have electricity by tomorrow.
