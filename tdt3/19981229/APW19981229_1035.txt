The Security Council urged the Angolan government and UNITA rebels 
on Tuesday to immediately grant U.N. forces access to the site of 
a downed U.N.-chartered plane to determine the fate of the 14 people 
on board. ``Any further delay jeopardizes the lives of possible survivors,'' 
the council said in a statement to the press read by the president, 
Jassim Mohammed Buallay. The C-130 transport plane, chartered by the 
U.N. Observer Mission in Angola, crashed Saturday 10 minutes after 
takeoff in the bush near the central highland city of Huambo, about 
500 kilometers (310 miles) southeast of the Angolan capital Luanda. 
The United Nations immediately asked that the government and UNITA 
grant safe passage to a search and rescue team to get to the site 
but hasn't yet received a positive response from either side, officials 
said Tuesday. The area is the site of renewed fighting between the 
government and UNITA that has shattered the 1994 U.N.-brokered peace 
accord that sought to end two decades of civil war in the former Portuguese 
colony. U.N. officials said Tuesday the plane's owner, TransAfric, 
flew another plane high over the site and saw that it was seemingly 
intact. But a U.N. spokesman in Luanda, Hamadoun Toure, said there 
was only a ``very, very minor chance'' of survivors being found. The 
council was particularly concerned that neither side had taken effective 
action after the disappearance of three other planes over UNITA territory, 
Buallay said. He did not elaborate on the incidents. A government 
plane was shot down Dec. 14, but the military hasn't said who was 
responsible. ``Council members renew their appeal to the government 
of Angola and UNITA to guarantee the safety and freedom of movement 
of MONUA personnel and encourage the secretary-general to take additional 
steps to ensure adequate security and protection for its personnel,'' 
Buallay said. The United Nations identified the 14 passengers and 
crew Tuesday: Jose Data and Dala Antonio, both of Angola and both 
contract employees of Dinacom, which works with the United Nations. 
Members of the U.N. team include Rui Cameling of Angola, Assa Salaam 
Galal of Egypt, Wilfried Mateka of Cameroon, Margaret Zulu of Zambia, 
Lt. Paulus Willem of Namibia, Patrick Luckman of Australia, Oleg Kapturovic 
and Savin S. of Russia. The crew include Capt. John Wilkinson of South 
Africa, Carlos Alberto Constantino Tavares Da Silba of Angola, Carlos 
Melgar of Bolivia and Benjamin Montefalcon of the Philippines.
