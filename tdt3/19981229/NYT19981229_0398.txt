A 19-year-old black woman was killed here in a hail of police bullets 
as she sat in her disabled car early Monday, a gun in her lap, leading 
relatives to accuse the officers of murder and local civil rights 
officials to ask for calm. ``A lot of people want us to march and 
protest against the police,'' said Don Bardo, president of the Urban 
League of Riverside and San Bernardino counties. ``But I'm telling 
people to be cool until the investigation is completed. Let's not 
make the tragedy any worse.'' That the death of the woman, Tyisha 
Miller, is a tragedy is about the only thing everyone can agree on 
about the case. Shortly before 2 a.m. on Monday, the authorities received 
a 911 call saying that a woman in a car at a gas station in Riverside 
was asleep or unconscious with a pistol in her lap. At 2:01 a.m. four 
Riverside police officers, three white and one Hispanic, arrived and 
tried to wake the woman as she sat in her locked Nissan Sentra with 
the windows rolled up. A few moments later, Ms. Miller was dead. Her 
family said her body and car were riddled with as many as two dozen 
bullets. Immediately after the shooting, police said that Ms. Miller 
had shot at them once and, fearing for their lives, the officers returned 
fire. On Tuesday, though, a police spokesman, Sgt. Chris Manning, 
said it was unclear whether Ms. Miller had fired. But, Manning said, 
Ms. Miller did grab the gun after the officers smashed the driver's 
side window to get to her. ``As we continued interviews,'' Manning 
said, ``we weren't as absolute that a round was fired.'' Ms. Miller's 
cousin, Anthonete Joiner, 18, who had placed the call to 911, was 
30 or 40 feet away from the car during the shooting. Ms. Joiner had 
gone to the gas station before the police arrived, to help her cousin 
with a flat tire. But when she and a friend arrived at the station, 
they found Ms. Miller either asleep or unconscious, her seat reclined. 
The car's radio was blasting and the heat was turned to high. The 
police were unable to wake her, even after knocking on the windows. 
They also saw the gun on her lap. Ron Butler, the cousins' uncle, 
said that Ms. Joiner had called 911, thinking that an ambulance would 
be sent to the scene, and had no idea that the police would arrive 
instead. But because of the report of the gun, the police came, Manning 
said, ``so that they could remove the threat of a handgun, so the 
medical personnel could respond.'' The Riverside Press-Enterprise 
reported Tuesday that Ms. Joiner said her cousin ``was lying in her 
car shaking,'' her eyes rolling and mouth foaming. Ms. Joiner could 
not be reached for comment Tuesday. Butler said that Ms. Joiner told 
him that when the police arrived at the gas station, they ordered 
her to step back and immediately began pounding on the window and 
screaming at Ms. Miller to open the door. The next thing Ms. Joiner 
saw, said her uncle, was the officers shooting her cousin. ``She wasn't 
a criminal,'' Butler said of Ms. Miller. ``She was a young girl with 
a flat tire and she fell asleep.'' ``Anthonete is devastated,'' Butler 
said. ``She is so upset. She feels guilty because she thinks it's 
her fault her cousin got murdered.'' The four officers, whom the police 
would not identify, have been placed on paid administrative leave, 
pending the outcome of what will surely be a carefully watched investigation. 
Two of the officers had less than five years on the job. The Riverside 
County district attorney's office is investigating the shooting, which 
Michael Soccio, a spokesman, said could take weeks. ``We will be attempting 
to determine if any criminal conduct occurred,'' Soccio said. As the 
yard and the street in front of the Millers' home here filled up, 
the city of Riverside and civic officials such as Bardo were working 
to calm tensions. On Monday night, Bardo, a representative from the 
National Association for the Advancement of Colored People and several 
other neighborhood advocates were briefed by Chief Jerry Carroll of 
the Riverside police on the shooting. ``There wasn't a lot of information,'' 
Bardo said. ``But there was a whole lot of gray.'' On Tuesday, family 
and friends gathered in the front yard of the yellow ranch-style house 
in nearby Rubidous and quietly talked about organizing a neighborhood 
car wash on New Year's Day to raise money for Ms. Miller's burial. 
``They might as well have lynched her,'' said the Rev. Bernell Butler, 
a friend of the family. ``This might as well be Mississippi.'' But 
Bardo said, ``Nobody knows what to believe,'' adding, ``I'm not taking 
any side until I find out what happened.'' This has been a difficult 
year for race relations in Riverside, a city of about 250,000 people 
60 miles east of Los Angeles. In January there was a bitter and embarrassing 
debate about whether to name the new high school after the Rev. Dr. 
Martin Luther King Jr. In the end, it did receive that name. A few 
months later, a black man shot and wounded the mayor, two city council 
members and three police officers. The man, a former city employee, 
had objected to what he said was unfair treatment of young black and 
Hispanic residents.
