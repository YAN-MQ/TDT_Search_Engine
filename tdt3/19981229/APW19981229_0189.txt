An anti-trust panel has levied a total of dlrs 1.5 million in fines 
against Italy's three largest television networks on allegations they 
blocked free bidding on the rights to broadcast sports events. Monday's 
fines targeted state-owned RAI and private media groups Cecchi Gori 
and Reti Televisive Italiane. RTI, the nation's largest private television 
company, is controlled by media magnate and opposition leader Silvio 
Berlusconi. The anti-trust authority says RAI and RTI split the broadcast 
rights to soccer matches, Formula One races and the Giro d'Italia 
cycling race in 1996, shutting out Cecchi Gori. In 1997, RAI., RTI 
and Cecchi Gori divided between them the rights to broadcast Italian 
soccer matches for the next two seasons, the panel said. RAI and RTI 
said they would appeal. The two called the fines unfounded, saying 
the 1996 accord was never carried out and that the 1997 accord had 
the approval of Italy's soccer league. The fines come as Italy's two, 
emerging pay-TV networks try to break into the sports broadcast market, 
vying for the lucrative broadcast rights to Italian soccer. One, Tele 
Piu, is 10 percent controlled by Berlusconi's companies; the other, 
Stream, is the subject of a still-pending deal that would sell a majority 
stake to Rupert Murdoch's media empire.
