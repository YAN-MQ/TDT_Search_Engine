``Console me! I am inconsolable!'' _ Anna, in ``Private Confessions'' 
This bit of dialogue is Ingmar Bergman at his most resonant, a slightly 
ridiculous cry of pain, the ridicule softened by an implicit sympathy. 
How can you not sympathize with someone so pitifully exposed in the 
contradictions of being human? The story of ``Private Confessions,'' 
which opens Wednesday, is classic Bergman territory as well. An unhappily 
married minister's wife has embarked on an affair with a young seminarian; 
torn between guilt at lying and a belief in the essential truth of 
her love, she turns to an old friend, her confirmation priest, whose 
counsel will alter her life in unintended ways. ``Private Confessions'' 
is enormously moving, with a moral and emotional gravity that has 
become increasingly rare in movies. Watching it, I felt the relief 
I always used to feel settling into a Bergman film _ that here at 
last was a filmmaker willing to admit how hard the most ordinary life 
can be, and how alarmingly drastic. But this film has two makers. 
Written by Bergman and directed by Liv Ullmann, ``Private Confessions'' 
opens a new chapter in a relationship that began more than three decades 
ago, when Ms. Ullmann played opposite Bibi Andersson in what is probably 
Bergman's most famous movie, ``Persona.'' Bergman, who is 80, turned 
to directing theater full time 15 years ago, but he continues to write 
films. Ms. Ullmann will direct a second Bergman screenplay _ the Swedish 
title means ``Faithless'' _ later this year. She says she was so delighted 
when Bergman asked her to make ``Private Confessions'' that she accepted 
without even reading it. ``This is a circle that has closed, because 
I missed working with Ingmar, and this meant working with him in a 
different way,'' she said on a recent visit to New York, where she 
keeps an apartment. Once Bergman directed Ms. Ullmann, now she directs 
him. Given her central place in his films and his life, it seems fitting 
that she should. The unhappily married couple in ``Private Confessions'' 
are named Bergman, and they first appeared in ``Best Intentions,'' 
which Bergman wrote and Bille August directed in 1992. With both scripts, 
Bergman continues the task he began in 1984 with ``Fanny and Alexander'': 
to come to terms with his troubled childhood as the son of a harshly 
punitive Lutheran minister and a mother who kept him at arm's length. 
Although Bergman is considered an autobiographical filmmaker, it was 
only when he became involved with Ms. Ullmann that his work made a 
decisive shift in that direction. Beginning with ``Persona'' (1966), 
he turned deeply inward, and the nine films they made together over 
the next 12 years, when Bergman's film career was at its peak, reflect 
his most private concerns. More than any other Bergman actress, Ms. 
Ullmann embodies his core themes of anguish, loss and failure _ the 
anguish of everyday life, the radical loss of faith, and the failure 
of love to console. In ``Persona,'' Ms. Ullmann embodies Bergman himself. 
Here, the anguish of everyday life includes a tormenting sense of 
inauthenticity. This is what causes the breakdown of the actress Elizabet 
Vogler, played by Ms. Ullmann, and plunges her into silence. Elizabet's 
defining gift, the ability to portray the real, is also the root of 
her alienation: She feels fraudulent. Ms. Ullmann's luminous blue 
eyes and softly rounded face are uniquely suited to expressing the 
most naked vulnerability, but in ``Persona'' nearly the opposite happens. 
Elizabet's silence, which begins as a traumatized rejection of the 
world, gradually becomes a form of power. As Elizabet's cheerful young 
nurse, Alma (Ms. Andersson), starts compulsively spilling the contents 
of her own life, Elizabet silently sops them up until nothing is left. 
In the movie's most famous shot, the women's faces fuse: Alma has 
been subsumed into Elizabet, she has become the stronger woman's creature 
_ as an actress may become the creature of her director. ``Luckily, 
the part he gave me was a silent person,'' Ms. Ullmann says of her 
first Bergman role. ``I was Norwegian, I couldn't even have tried 
to speak Swedish, I was probably too scared to talk at all. But I 
did recognize him somehow, and I knew that I was him. That was my 
great understanding at 25. I didn't really understand my part, because 
I was playing someone 40 years old. But I knew it was Ingmar, and 
my instinct explained it for me.'' Ms. Ullmann and Bergman fell in 
love while making ``Persona.'' Both were married but left their mates 
and had a daughter, Linn. In his 1987 autobiography, ``The Magic Lantern,'' 
Bergman says simply, ``Liv and I were overwhelmed by passion,'' and 
describes building a house for them on Faro (pronounced Fora), his 
beloved island retreat off Sweden's Baltic coast. Ms. Ullmann's recollection 
is more complicated. ``We were walking on this stony beach and he 
said, `I have to tell you, this night I had a dream that we were painfully 
connected.' You know, I more or less fell in love with that. I mean, 
Ingmar Bergman is painfully connected to me?'' She laughs at the memory 
of a young actress's susceptibility to the tortured blandishments 
of a great artist. ``Well, I regretted it and went back to Norway, 
and he came to Norway and got me back to Sweden. And then I became 
pregnant, and I left him again. Then he asked me to come back; he 
had written a film for a pregnant woman. So I went back, and that 
was `Hour of the Wolf.' We never married. I moved to Faro, where I 
lived for five years. It was there we did `Shame,' and then `The Passion 
of Anna,' but that was toward the end. And then it was over, that 
part, and I took my child and went back to Norway.'' Bergman's description 
of their end has the terse poetry of an epitaph: ``She stayed a few 
years. We fought our demons as best we could. When she left, we knew.'' 
Ms. Ullmann's description of their serial parting in ``Changing,'' 
her best-selling 1976 memoir, has the humor, passion, sadness and 
desperation of a Bergman movie. ``It was the practical matters one 
had to consider in order to break out,'' she notes drily. To get off 
Faro, there were four gates to open, drive through and close, and 
a ferry to catch, but ``our fights never coincided with its schedule.'' 
Long before this obstacle course could be completed, they would make 
up. Once he ordered a taxi plane to expedite her departure, but ``We 
became friends again, by the suitcases.'' When the final parting came, 
they did the only thing they could: pretend it wasn't a parting at 
all. ``Just a short trip to Norway,'' she writes. With everything 
packed and the bags in the car, they remained carefully casual. It 
was left to their housekeeper to step behind a curtain and weep. The 
Bergman movie this story brings to mind, of course, is ``Scenes from 
a Marriage.'' Made in six parts for Swedish television and trimmed 
to just under three hours for theatrical release in 1973, it has none 
of the visual panache of the films that preceded it: the elegant black 
and white severity of ``Persona,'' the rough documentary chiaroscuro 
of ``Shame,'' the gorgeous reds in ``Cries and Whispers'' that turn 
every room into a bloody chamber. Shot, like those movies, by the 
great cinematographer Sven Nykvist, ``Scenes from a Marriage'' looks 
as unromantic as the fraying union that is its subject. Full of two-shots 
and close-ups of Ms. Ullmann and her co-star, Erland Josephson, the 
film is relentless in its intimacy: embarrassing, revelatory, painful, 
slyly funny and occasionally sublime. When he tells her he is leaving 
her for another woman, we hear him but the camera watches her, avidly 
studying her every reaction. Working fast, with little rehearsal, 
Ms. Ullmann has never been subtler or more fearless. Neither has Bergman's 
writing, with every line at perfect pitch. Perhaps the most striking 
thing about ``Scenes From a Marriage'' is how immediate it feels. 
Much of ``Persona'' remains powerful, but there are moments when its 
stylish solemnity looks dated and naive, the perfect template for 
``Sprockets,'' Mike Myers' wicked ``Saturday Night Live'' send-up 
of art-film pretensions. But ``Scenes from a Marriage'' hasn't aged 
five minutes in its 26 years. Now, as then, it reads like a blueprint 
of the human heart. Bergman made the film when he was 55 and in the 
first years of his fifth and only lasting marriage, to Ingrid von 
Rosen, a close friend. He has said that he wrote the movie ``in order 
to tidy up a huge wardrobe of experiences of different kinds,'' his 
own and others. Ms. Ullmann enabled Bergman to express his deepest 
anxieties in many films, but she held out another possibility. Ms. 
Ullmann often signifies a kind of wholeness for Bergman _ something 
that seems undamaged and therefore implies hope. ``Scenes from a Marriage'' 
reconciles, however tentatively, his conflicted perceptions about 
men and women: For the first time, consolation is possible. Although 
he and Ms. Ullmann made three more films together, this was their 
last truly successful collaboration. In its emotional maturity, ``Scenes 
from a Marriage'' anticipated the work that they are doing now. Even 
people who should know better have a tendency to call Ms. Ullmann's 
``Private Confessions'' a Bergman movie, as if she had dutifully executed 
his detailed wishes. In other words, as if she were his creature. 
But as their professional and personal history makes clear, she has 
not been that in years, if indeed she ever was. In ``Fanny and Alexander,'' 
Bergman wrote the part of the young mother _ his mother _ for Ms. 
Ullmann; when she declined to play it, he was furious. She says she 
regrets now not being part of his last film. ``But I suddenly couldn't 
do it. I couldn't be ashamed any more. I couldn't be guilty. Because 
I'm not anguished the way he is. He struggles with this anguish and 
with the difficulty of being a human being. Life for me is very different. 
He stays on his island, and I want to travel the world.'' Ms. Ullmann 
was breaking out once more, this time in a direction that would eventually 
bring her back to him. By 1991 she was writing and directing ``Sofie,'' 
her first feature and a good one, about a happy marriage and an unhappy 
one and the links between them. ``I called Ingmar from the airport 
and told him. He said, `Oh, my god.''' Her second film, ``Kristin 
Lavransdatter,'' based on Sigrid Undset's epic novel of medieval Norway, 
became that country's ``Titanic,'' seen at least once by more than 
half the population. When Bergman offered her ``Private Confessions,'' 
she wondered if he would try to look over her shoulder. They argued 
over a few things in the rough cut, but in the end, he not only respected 
her choices but embraced them. Although ``Private Confessions'' was 
shot by Sven Nykvist, it doesn't especially look like a Bergman film. 
It has its own look, plain yet suggestive and charismatic, like a 
Hopper painting _ or like the remarkable face of its star, Pernilla 
August. The film has a kind of intimate intensity that seems to radiate 
from her. As the beautifully shaded performances in both ``Sophie'' 
and this film make clear, Ms. Ullmann, like Bergman, is above all 
a director of actors. ``When I started directing,'' she says, ``I 
thought: `This is it. The whole 40 years of being an actress have 
just been a school for this.' I got a new respect for actors and how 
creative they are, and they know that I think that. I don't think 
I was always a good mother, but I know I'm a good mother for actors 
because I allow them to grow themselves and I don't try to make a 
blueprint of myself.'' One of the most memorable scenes in ``Private 
Confessions,'' filmed in a single 10-minute take, is that of the last 
visit between Anna Bergman and Jacob, the dying confirmation priest, 
played by Max von Sydow. At one point, von Sydow says, ``All these 
years I've been thinking about you,'' and stops, apparently unable 
to go on. ``I don't know what was in Max's mind,'' Ms. Ullmann says, 
``but suddenly he's starting to cry and he can't get the words. It's 
almost a minute before the next word comes. And we are so close, he 
knew that I wouldn't stop him, and I knew that he would continue, 
and allow Jacob and Max to come together. Because he knew that this 
was so right for the scene.'' Directors earn moments like that. Bergman 
once told an interviewer that his first job was to make his actors 
feel secure, because it's the actor who goes in front of the camera 
and takes chances. Clearly, Ms. Ullmann is using much that she learned 
from him. As a director, she says, ``He's a wonderful audience, he 
stirs you up a little, and then he allows the actor to take joy in 
doing the work. Because it's not anguish then, it's joy, tremendous 
joy.''
