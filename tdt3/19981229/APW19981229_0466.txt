Despite severe economic problems, Russia is still strong enough to 
develop a new nuclear missile if necessary, Defense Minister Igor 
Sergeyev said in an interview published Tuesday. ``The talk about 
our weakness is an overstatement,'' Sergeyev said in an interview 
published in the daily Segodnya. ``If we need, we may build a heavy 
missile.'' Sergeyev was responding to a question about what the military 
would do if Russia's parliament does not ratify the START II arms 
reduction treaty, under which Russia and the United States are to 
reduce their nuclear forces. Another senior government official, First 
Deputy Prime Minister Yuri Maslyukov, appeared to have a different 
view of the Russian capacity. In current economic conditions, Russia 
can't ``even try to match the U.S. nuclear missile potential,'' Maslyukov 
said on Tuesday, according to the Interfax news agency. He called 
on the Russian parlament to quickly ratify START II, saying that the 
deployment of new Topol-M missiles would allow Russia to preserve 
an effective nuclear deterrent. The first 10 Topol-Ms were put on 
duty last weekend. Russia should mobilize its resources to build up 
to 30 such missiles a year, Maslyukov said. Sergeyev and other military 
leaders have also strongly supported the treaty, saying that by the 
year 2007, the START II's deadline for halving Russian and U.S. arsenals 
to 3,000-3,500 warheads each, Russia's aging heavy missiles will have 
to be decommissioned anyway. Sergeyev appeared to reiterate his support 
for the treaty on Tuesday, but said Moscow can maintain a credible 
nuclear force and develop new missiles if necessary. ``Why should 
we go back to the past? The number of warheads doesn't determine anything,'' 
he said. Russia and the United States signed START II in 1993, and 
the U.S. Senate approved it in 1996. The Communist-dominated Russian 
parliament has delayed ratification, claiming the treaty would damage 
Russia's security. Lawmakers appeared ready to approve the treaty 
earlier this month, but again delayed ratification until next spring 
to protest U.S. and British air strikes against Iraq. Sergeyev and 
other government officials have condemned the strikes on Iraq. ``We 
aren't going to have a confrontation with America,'' Sergeyev said 
in the interview. ``But we couldn't keep quiet, since that (raids 
on Iraq) was a step away from law and toward primeval society.'' ``I 
don't know what our tough stance will bring, but I'm sure that it 
will be taken into account. Many are applauding us under the table,'' 
he said.
