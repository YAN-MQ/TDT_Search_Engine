The coyotes are A-hurtin'. I'm Anthony Keith James, and this is "CNN 
Headline Sports." First up, the NFL, where Deion Sanders is listed 
as doubtful for the cowboys' playoff game with Arizona this weekend. 
A re-examination of the cornerback's left big toe confirms a sprained 
toe has kept him out of Dallas' last six games. Sanders didn't practice 
today. We're able to do a lot more things with him. And he's a great 
football player, and you know, we miss him on the defensive side of 
the ball, we miss what he's able to do with punt returns. And we're 
hopeful that we'll get him back, and he'll be playing. It's frustrating 
that he's not where he wants to be. It really is frustrating 'cause 
you lose such a talent if you lose him. And do we need him? Yes, we 
need him. We would love to have him on the football field.
