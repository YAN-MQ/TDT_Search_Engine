The Organization of African Unity says it has been a turbulent year. 
As VOA's Scott Sterns reports, there's fighting across the continent 
involving more and more countries. Secretary General Salim Ahmed Salim 
urged African leaders to break a vicious cycle of conflict and violence. 
He said the OAU will continue to seek peace in Congo's civil war fighting 
between rival separatists on the Indian Ocean island of Anjuwah and 
the border dispute between Ethiopia and Eritrea. Secretary General 
Salim also cited violence in Somalia, Burundi, Angola, Sudan, Western 
Sahara, Guinea-Bissau, Lasutu, Sierra Leone, and Congo Brazzaville. 
There were modest economic gains in some parts of Africa in 1998, 
with the secretary general saying the private sector is becoming more 
involved in promoting development. Scott Sterns, VOA News, East Africa
