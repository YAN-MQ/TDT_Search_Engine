The prosecution has suffered a setback in the trial of the former 
Malaysian Deputy Prime Minister Anwar Ibrahim. Medical evidence presented 
by the defense has contradicted prosecution allegations that he's 
recently had intimate sexual relations with his adopted brother. Mr. 
Anwar faces 10 charges of sodomy and corruption. Simon Ingram reports. 
The explicit, often sordid details exposed before the Kuala Lumpur 
High Court have shocked a largely conservative nation. The latest 
witness, to take the stand is a government doctor, Zahari Neur, who 
was questioned by defense counsel about a medical examination he conducted 
on Suk Madar Mawan, one of two men jailed in September for allowing 
himself to be sodomized by the former Deputy Prime Minister. Dr. Zahari 
said that he'd found no physical evidence that Mr. Suk Mar had engaged 
in anal intercourse. Dr. Zahari's testimony is a welcomed boost to 
Mr. Anwar's lawyers who are trying to prove that he's been framed 
in an attempt to ruin his political career. Zimon Ingram, BBC Bangkok.
