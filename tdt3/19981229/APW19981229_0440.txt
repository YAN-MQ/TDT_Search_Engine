Twenty-nine illegal immigrants from Iraq and Afghanistan were found 
hidden in a van Monday during a routine traffic control, the news 
agency CTK reported Tuesday. The agency quoted police spokeswoman 
Dagmar Bartonikova as saying that driver of the van escaped when police 
stopped the car and was not yet detained. Bartonikova said that the 
refugees asked for political asylum and were placed in a refugee camp. 
The Czech Republic is becoming a popular transit destination for refugees. 
More than 33,000 illegal immigrants have been caught in the Czech 
Republic this year, but only a fraction have asked for asylum, as 
the final hoped-for destination for most of them is Germany.
