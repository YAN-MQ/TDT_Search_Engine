Another interesting story developing on the scene today about what 
archaeologists are finding and what it tells us about our past. Archaeologists 
now believe that they have found a 4,000-year-old stone calendar carved 
by the Tequesta Native Americans in downtown Miami, Florida is where 
they found it. That's not where the... OK, that's where they found 
it. That's not where the Tequestas hung out, no. Perhaps they were 
there long before Miami was is I think the way this story would be 
unfolding. This type of Indians died out shortly after Spanish explorer 
Ponce de Leon arrived in Florida in 1513. The Miami... Did he have 
anything to do with it? I don't think so. If it's 4,000 years old, 
that's only 400. You lost a decimal point there on your math. The 
"Miami Herald" newspaper... Math was never my strong point. ... reported 
Monday that researchers found an 11-1/2 meter round stone at a construction 
site near the city's financial district in August, 11-1/2 meters round. 
Historian Paul George was quoted as saying that the small notches 
and holes that cover the stone could have been used to measure the 
time, the sun, and the stars. That's a pretty big stone. That's a 
big old rock. Certainly not a pocket calendar, I would think. No, 
not at all. And I think it does sound... Hang that one on the wall. 
It does sound like one of the more sophisticated artifacts that they 
have found from the Native American cultures in North America, actually. 
None of the other things that they found indicate a more primitive 
lifestyle at that stage at 4,000 years old, so this could be a major 
find.
