Saying they were ``very sorry'' but refusing to accept responsibility, 
two top Khmer Rouge leaders asked Cambodians to ``let bygones be bygones'' 
Tuesday and forget about the genocide of the 1970s. Khieu Samphan 
and Nuon Chea were flown by helicopter from a former rebel stronghold 
to the capital to defect _ in effect, surrender _ to Prime Minister 
Hun Sen after he pledged they would not face trial for crimes against 
humanity. At a news conference, they were asked by journalists _ many 
of them Cambodians who lost family members _ if they felt any remorse 
for causing the deaths of as many as 2 million of their countrymen 
out of a population of about 9 million. ``Yes, sorry, very sorry,'' 
Khieu Samphan said, looking red and sullen. ``We would like to apologize 
and ask our compatriots to forget the past so our nation can concentrate 
on the future,'' Khieu Samphan said. ``Let bygones be bygones.'' The 
Maoist revolutionaries won a civil war in 1975 and forced the population 
into slave labor camps. One Cambodian in five perished from overwork, 
starvation, disease and executions. Khieu Samphan called the nightmare 
_ laid out in his doctoral thesis as a communist student in Paris 
in 1959 _ a ``historical experiment.'' The Khmer Rouge were overthrown 
in 1979 by a Vietnamese invasion, but spent two decades waging civil 
war. Stalemate ended in 1996 when the government began offering pardons 
to leaders and guerrillas to get them to make peace. With the movement 
all but extinct, calls are being heard for someone to finally be held 
accountable. The defections of Khieu Samphan and Nuon Chea have no 
bearing on the military situation. Only one leader, Ta Mok, remains 
at large with an estimated 100 loyalists. Hun Sen's reversal of previous 
support for a tribunal and the warm reception given the Khmer Rouge 
leaders was met with shock by the human rights group Amnesty International. 
``It's a black day for the Cambodian people and a black day for international 
justice,'' group representative Demelza Stubbings said. Khieu Samphan 
was the nominal Khmer Rouge leader, though he is viewed as a front-man 
for the notorious Pol Pot and others who held real power. Nuon Chea 
was seen as Pol Pot's second-in-command and chief theorist. Pol Pot 
died in April of a heart attack. Neither accepted personal responsibility 
Tuesday at the news conference before as hostile an audience as they 
are ever likely to face now that a trial is out. Demands were shouted 
by some reporters for personal apologies to the families of those 
who perished. Nuon Chea, asked who was to blame for the massacres, 
said: ``Let's consider that an old issue. I cannot clarify that.'' 
``We are very sorry, not just for the human lives, but also animal 
lives that were lost in the war,'' Nuon Chea said. Khieu Samphan indicated 
there would be no trial, especially one abroad by an international 
tribunal. The United Nations recently sent a team of experts to weigh 
the possibility of such a court. ``Please let the Cambodian people 
resolve this problem,'' Khieu Samphan said. ``If we have to say who 
was wrong and who was right, etc., etc., we cannot have national reconciliation,'' 
Khieu Samphan said. ``We cannot put an end to the war.'' But U.S. 
officials still insist that they should be held accountable for their 
actions before an appropriate tribunal and noted that ``while there 
have been a number of conflicting statements from Cambodian authorities, 
we note that Prime Minister Hun Sen has not ruled out the possibility 
of a trial.'' Neither man looked well after months on the run when 
rebel areas came under government control. Nuon Chea, 71, walked with 
a cane. Khieu Samphan, 67, needed help up the stairs. Khieu Samphan's 
normally white hair was dyed black in an apparent attempt at disguise. 
In the five-hours meeting with Hun Sen, they were joined by leading 
members of the Cambodian People's Party. Like Hun Sen, many were once 
Khmer Rouge cadres before fleeing murderous purges in the late 1970s. 
The pair later called on Prince Norodom Ranariddh, president of the 
National Assembly and son of King Norodom Sihanouk. Hun Sen says that 
both have approved the defections. It was Nuon Chea's first visit 
to the capital since the Khmer Rouge were overthrown in 1979 by a 
Vietnamese invasion. Khieu Samphan came to Phnom Penh in 1991 after 
a peace treaty _ later broken by the Khmer Rouge _ was signed. He 
was stoned by a Hun Sen-controlled mob.
