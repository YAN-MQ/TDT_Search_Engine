A somber ending for the annual Sydney-to-hobart yacht race in Australia. 
A small group of people greeted the American crew of "sayonara" Monday 
as it sailed to victory in hobart. The end of the race was overshadowed 
by the powerful storm that capsized several boats, killing at least 
five sailors. One other sailor is still missing. Ships and helicopters 
from the Australian Navy braved the gale-force winds and 35-foot waves 
to rescue others washed overboard. Of the 115 yachts entered, 59 had 
to seek Shelter, and several were abandoned altogether.
