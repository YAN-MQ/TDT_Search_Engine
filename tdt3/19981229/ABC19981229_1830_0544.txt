In the pacific northwest tonight, a mix of rain, melting snow and 
mud is creating a weather nightmare. After heavy snows paralyzed the 
region, blocking roads and stranding travelers, the big worry now 
is flooding. ABC's Brian Rooney reports from Seattle. Heavy rain fell 
this morning on the mountains east of Seattle, melting recent snowfall. 
A national guard tank was used to shoot down avalanches in mountain 
passes before they fell down on motorists. All this rain and melting 
snow is sending torrents of water downhill. Six Washington rivers 
had some flooding today. The snoqualmie falls are evidence of just 
how water running down river, that's at 15,000 cubic feet per second. 
And it's expected to go to 25,000 cubic feet by tonight. And further 
south, residents spent last night sandbagging in the town of mcKenna, 
where the river was threatening to flood low-lying areas of town. 
It did flood in pacific city on the Oregon coast, but the water was 
receding by this afternoon. We're a lot more fortunate than other 
people. Outside corvallis, Oregon, a house was crushed by a mudslide. 
In San franciscothe problem hasn't been rain, it's been two days of 
fog that crippled air travel. The skies cleared today, but not all 
the confusion. This couple was held over for two days. We started 
out from Charlotte, North Carolina, and we're going to Honolulu. The 
high school band that my son plays in has been in Honolulu since sunday. 
Not only were passengers separated from families, as many as 5,000 
pieces of luggage were separated from passengers. Do you see it? I 
didn't see it either. It's the right shape, but the wrong color. As 
they sort things out in San Francisco, it's still raing in the northwest, 
but that's expected to taper off and most of the rivers should start 
dropping tomorrow Brian Rooney, ABC News, Seattle.
