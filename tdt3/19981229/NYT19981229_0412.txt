The Miami Dolphins have been through an emotional wringer over the 
last three weeks. Down, up, down. Now, as they prepare for Saturday's 
wild-card playoff game against the Buffalo Bills, they are finding 
two huge sources of optimism. Their names are Richmond Webb and Kevin 
Donnalley. The two offensive line regulars _ the 320-pound Webb at 
tackle and the 305-pound Donnalley at guard _ are coming off the injured 
list for this game. Tight end Troy Drayton's face brightened Tuesday 
at that prospect. ``Those guys being back will really help us big 
time,'' he said. ``Webb is a Pro Bowler who always blocks well against 
Bruce Smith. And Donnalley is Donnalley. He's scrappy and intense 
and he's going to give 1,000 percent. Maybe we can get our running 
game going again with them in there.'' The Dolphins' running game, 
never that great, evaporated over the last two weeks of the regular 
season, with Karim Abdul-Jabbar, having suffered a concussion, missing 
the 38-16 loss to Atlanta last Sunday. That has left them with an 
all-too-familiar problem _ relying solely on Dan Marino's passing 
arm. Miami totaled 62 rushing yards in its final two regular-season 
games. Coach Jimmy Johnson is acutely aware that his team can't live 
by Marino alone. ``I think the running game, whether or not we're 
gaining yards, has to be a factor,'' Johnson said. ``I'm not saying 
we're going to gain a lot of yards. I'm saying we have to have some 
attempts running the ball because if we don't, we're going to allow 
the defense to tee off and rush the passer every down.'' That's exactly 
what happened in last season's playoffs, when New England sent the 
Dolphins home early, 17-3, as Marino was sacked four times and intercepted 
twice. Miami unquestionably has a better defense this time around. 
It is first in the league in interceptions with 29 and rated third 
over all. Even so, end Jason Taylor, who has 9 of the team's 45 sacks, 
will be missing Saturday. He broke his clavicle in last Sunday's 22-point 
loss to Atlanta. Whether the Dolphins' offense is more fit for the 
playoffs is more debatable. The team's receivers have been widely 
criticized through much of the season. That's what prompted Lamar 
Thomas, who caught three touchdown passes in Miami's 31-21 upset of 
Denver, to launch into a profanity-laced attack on a South Florida 
columnist after the bitter loss to Atlanta. ``We know we're easy to 
criticize, because we don't have a lot of big-name guys,'' Thomas 
said Tuesday. ``In a lot of games, we were just being consistent and 
not putting up the big numbers, and people were calling for our necks 
to be split. We're definitely underrated.'' For Marino, now 37, this 
is one more try at an elusive Super Bowl ring. The National Football 
League's most productive passer has played in 14 playoff games in 
16 seasons, including one Super Bowl, a loss to the San Francisco 
49ers in 1985. ``It's what you work all year for,'' Marino said. ``This 
is why I play. And I believe we have a chance, I really do, if we 
can play consistent. We've shown at times this season where we're 
a strong football team and we can beat anybody. We just need to be 
more consistent and understand what the circumstances are.'' Marino 
now fully embraces how imperative the running game is to Miami's success. 
``If we intend on going deep into the playoffs, we have to be balanced,'' 
he said. ``If you look at the history of playoff games, teams throwing 
the ball 50, 60 times, it's difficult for them to win.'' Buffalo is 
a familiar and intense division rival. The Bills have ended Miami's 
season three times in the 1990s, though they have lost four straight 
at Pro Player Stadium, where Saturday's game will be played. Still, 
the Dolphins have been anything but consistent in recent weeks. A 
loss to the New York Jets started the roller-coaster ride three weeks 
ago. Defensive end Trace Armstrong, a 10-year pro, was asked if the 
Dolphins are a better team than last season. He paused. Finally, he 
said: ``I honestly don't know. We'll find out Saturday.''
