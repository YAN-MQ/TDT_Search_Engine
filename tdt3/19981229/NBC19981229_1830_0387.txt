Still ahead tonight, dialing around -- NBC news "in depth." Those 
ads for the 10-10-phone numbers. They promise big savings but is there 
a catch? The reality is if you're not careful, you can end up paying 
20% more to a Call. And you never even realized it until you got your 
phone Bill. The hottest trend in long-distance phone service -- is 
it too good to be true? And later, easing the pain -- state of the 
art drugs offer new hope for sufferers of arthritis. I ate quaker 
oatmeal for 30 days. It helped me cut my cholesterol by 15 points. 
How would you describe that, Bob? A little off the top. Did you know 
harsh winter weather can leave even unexposed skin itchy and dry? 
Did you know moisturizers aren't always up to the challenge of itchy, 
dry skin? That's why there's new cortizone 10 plus. Among these, only 
cortizone 10 plus has 10 moisturizers, like aloe and vitamins, plus 
the power of cortizone 10 to stop itch and help heal. So for itchy 
patches of dry skin, even eczema or psoriasis, try new cortizone 10 
plus.
