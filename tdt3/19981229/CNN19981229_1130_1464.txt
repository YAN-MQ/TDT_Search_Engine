If you can't seem to find the perfect word, we have the perfect web 
site, a Visual thesaurus is what's "on-line." This is definitely one 
of the wordiest web sites on the Internet. The think mat visual thesaurus 
synonymizes words. Just type the word in question and watch the words 
float before you in a Mesmerizing matter. Please excuse our prolixity. 
To be honest, an old-fashioned thesaurus will be the best choice for 
genuine wordsmiths. The main value is the most fun you've had with 
words since the last time you watched "sesam street." That's what's 
online.
