The European Union on Tuesday applauded a decision by Greek Cypriot 
President Glafcos Clerides that he was canceling plans to deploy Russian-made 
missiles in his island nation. Austrian Foreign Minister Wolfgang 
Schuessel said the decision to scrap the missiles represented ``a 
great success for quiet diplomacy'' by the EU, Britain and the United 
States. Austria currently holds the rotating EU presidency. Schuessel 
said the Cypriot government appeared to have been influenced by its 
desire to join the EU and had made ``a significant contribution to 
stability in the region.'' The United States and NATO have criticized 
Clerides' decision two years ago to purchase the air defense missiles, 
fearing conflict between NATO members Turkey and Greece. Athens has 
a defense pact with the Greek Cypriots. Turkey had threatened military 
action if the missiles were actually deployed. The missiles issue 
has also caused political tensions in Cyprus, where the outcome of 
Tuesday's meeting could affect the survival of Clerides' government.
