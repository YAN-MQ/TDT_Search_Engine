The Senate majority leader, Trent Lott, and the 13 House Republicans 
planning to prosecute an impeachment trial of President Clinton in 
the Senate clashed on Tuesday over whether to call any witnesses. 
Lott also proposed beginning the Senate trial on Jan. 11, after initial 
procedural steps next week, and finishing within two weeks, a timetable 
many Democrats dismiss as overly optimistic. How long a trial lasts 
depends in large part on whether the Senate relies on the evidence 
gathered by the independent counsel, Kenneth W. Starr, or whether 
the House managers present witnesses. ``Are witnesses required? I 
don't think so,'' Lott, R-Miss., said in a telephone interview from 
his home state with The Associated Press. ``I think the record is 
there to be reviewed, read, presented in a form'' that the House prosecutors 
choose, the senator said. ``I think that would be sufficient.'' But 
in their first strategy meeting since Dec. 19, when the House approved 
two articles of impeachment, Rep. Henry J. Hyde, R-Ill., who is chairman 
of the House Judiciary Committee, and his 12 hand-picked managers 
agreed that they had to present witnesses to make their best case 
to remove the president from office. ``We cannot proceed to a trial 
without witnesses,'' Rep. Steve Buyer, R-Ind., said after the meeting. 
Rep. Bill McCollum, R-Fla., told reporters afterward, ``I'd think 
they'd want to hear some people live.'' The Senate, however, has control 
over the rules and procedures of the trial, a fact that McCollum acknowledged 
on Tuesday when he noted that the House managers are ``guests'' of 
the Senate. Lott has made it clear that he wants the Senate to wrap 
up an impeachment trial quickly, although the White House could call 
witnesses in Clinton's defense. But even one of the president's strongest 
Democratic defenders, Sen. Robert G. Torricelli of New Jersey, said 
on Tuesday, ``there is a bipartisan belief that there should be no 
witnesses.'' Under Lott's proposed schedule, the two articles of impeachment 
approved by the House would be read on the Senate floor on Jan. 7, 
the day after the 106th Congress convenes. The trial, Lott said in 
an interview on NBC News, would begin on Jan. 11 and last ``a week 
or two,'' with Jan. 22 being a target date for finishing. The president 
is scheduled to deliver his State of the Union address on Jan. 19. 
Under this scenario, the Senate would vote on the two articles _ perjury 
before a federal grand jury and obstruction of justice. Most senators 
have said they do not believe there are the 67 votes necessary to 
remove Clinton. So if the president was acquitted, the Senate might 
vote on a resolution of censure. White House aides were amused on 
Tuesday to see the division among the Republicans over calling witnesses. 
And they said they were pleased with Lott's plan for a two-week trial, 
though they have not formally agreed to it. Ranit Schmelzer, a spokeswoman 
for Tom Daschle of South Dakota, the Senate minority leader, said 
no one had ``conclusively signed off'' on Lott's proposal, including 
his insistence that no witnesses be summoned. ``There is a feeling 
that that's the way they are moving,'' said Ms. Schmelzer, who noted 
that Daschle and Lott were talking at least twice a week during the 
congressional recess. ``There is no unanimous consent resolution that 
has been written,'' she said. ``Until that happens, anything can happen.'' 
But Ms. Schmelzer added that Democrats would like to see a speedy 
trial and that witnesses would probably make it more protracted. The 
House managers, however, were nearly insistent on a full-blown trial 
with as many as 15 witnesses. While the managers did not discuss specific 
witnesses in their meeting, lawmakers said afterward that they could 
include Monica S. Lewinsky; Betty Currie, the president's secretary, 
and Vernon Jordan, Clinton's longtime confidant. The managers and 
House Republican aides said they were stunned and angered by Lott's 
remarks, which they learned about from reporters and television news 
reports. ``It's like swimming the English Channel with your feet tied,'' 
said one House Republican aide. ``It's a slap in the face of the House.'' 
Hyde left the meeting without speaking to reporters, but aides said 
he was troubled by Lott's comments. At their meeting, the House managers 
were assigned specific tasks for the trial. F. James Sensenbrenner 
Jr. of Wisconsin will give the opening statement. James E. Rogan of 
California and Hyde will give the closing arguments. Four managers 
were assigned to prepare for witnesses, George W. Gekas of Pennsylvania, 
Steve Chabot of Ohio, Christopher Cannon of Utah and McCollum. Asa 
Hutchinson of Arkansas, Ed Bryant of Tennessee and Rogan would question 
and cross-examine witnesses. Three managers would argue procedural 
motions, Lindsey Graham of South Carolina, Charles Canady of Florida 
and Buyer. Bob Barr of Georgia and Sensenbrenner would deal with any 
evidentiary objections.
