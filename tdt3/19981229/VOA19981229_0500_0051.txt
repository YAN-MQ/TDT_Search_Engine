Iraq has vowed to continue shooting at U.S. and British war planes 
if they continue to enforce no-fly zones in the north and south of 
the country. Hours after firing missiles at U.S. planes in Northern 
Iraq, Baghdad's U.N. envoy Nizar Hamdoon told Reuters his government 
does not recognize the zones. Iraq says four of its soldiers were 
killed, seven others wounded Monday when U.S. planes attacked an Iraqi 
anti-aircraft site in the northern zone. U.S. officials say the installation 
fired missiles at the planes. Iraq says it shot down one of the U.S. 
planes, but the United States denies it.
