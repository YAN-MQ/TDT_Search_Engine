The Vatican Museums, which include access to the Sistine Chapel, are 
raising entrance fees from 15,000 lire (dlrs 9) to 18,000 dire (dlrs 
10.90). The Vatican said Tuesday the higher ticket prices will go 
into effect on Saturday, the first day in 1999 when the museums are 
open. The museums already are one of the most-visited attractions 
in Italy, and crowds are expected to grow in the Holy Year in 2000, 
when an extra 20 million visitors are expected in Rome. Prices of 
discount tickets, for religious pilgrims and students, will rise from 
10,000 lire (dlrs 6) to 12,000 lire (dlrs 7.25). Entrance will remain 
free on the last Sunday of every month, unless those days correspond 
with Vatican holidays. Entrance is also free on Sept. 27, World Tourism 
Day. The Vatican attributed the rising ticket prices to higher operating 
costs.
