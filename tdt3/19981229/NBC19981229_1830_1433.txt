I'll be right back with some very good news for people with a very 
common health problem -- arthritis. If you ask all the dermatologists 
listed here... to recommend a therapeutic shampoo, neutrogena T/gel... 
would come out #1. T/gel works on all three itchy, flaky scalp conditions. 
Neutrogena T/gel: eating quaker oatmeal on a daily basis... can help 
lower cholesterol. Mine dropped 29 points. That's one under the speed 
limit here in Lafayette, Colorado. Just a reminder.
