Dennis Russell Davies is about to give up the music directorship of 
the American Composers Orchestra, a contemporary-music ensemble he 
helped found in 1975. But his formal parting will be as protracted 
as a diva's farewell tour. His final project as music director, ``20th-Century 
Snapshots,'' a series of 11 thematic concerts, begins next Sunday 
with ``The Gershwin Circle'' and ends in 2001. A survey of Cuban works 
in March and a program of Walt Whitman settings in May round out the 
first season. These programs and the others Davies has outlined for 
the next two seasons _ ``Protest,'' ``Roots,'' ``Lindbergh,'' ``Copland-Sessions,'' 
``Pacifica,'' ``Ellis Island to JFK,'' ``Berlin, 1931'' and ``Hollywood'' 
_ describe both a large repertory and a vast historical backdrop. 
``What I tried to do was to think about the United States, the century 
we're leaving and what some of the broad themes were,'' Davies said. 
``So `Hollywood,' `Pacifica,' `Lindbergh,' these were evocative themes 
that are both very American and very international.'' And when the 
series ends, is it curtains for Davies' relationship with the orchestra? 
Hardly. He hopes to take this ensemble of New York freelancers, and 
the 11 ``Snapshots'' programs, on tour. He will also return to lead 
it regularly as conductor laureate, and will join the orchestra's 
board. ``Dennis has typically conducted three of the five concerts 
the orchestra plays in a season,'' said Michael Geller, executive 
director of the American Composers Orchestra. ``But with this series, 
we'll have him for 11 programs in a row, so it turns out that now 
that he's leaving, we'll have more of him than we've had before.'' 
And that does not include Davies' appearances with the orchestra in 
Carnegie Hall children's concerts in June. Indulging a penchant for 
mixing old and new that goes back to his days as music director of 
the St. Paul Chamber Orchestra in the mid-1970s and principal conductor 
of the Brooklyn Philharmonic in the early '90s, he will offer the 
children programs split between Beethoven and Philip Glass. Departing 
music directors do not typically end their tenures with multiyear 
celebratory windups, but Davies' intensification of activity with 
the orchestra is odder still, since his main reason for stepping down 
is that he feels he cannot give the orchestra the time it needs. His 
workload elsewhere has increased: Besides guest-conducting in the 
United States and Europe, he is juggling the directorships of the 
Stuttgart Chamber Orchestra and the Vienna Radio Symphony Orchestra, 
and last February he began to teach conducting at the Salzburg Mozarteum. 
His living arrangements are accordingly scattered. He moved to Stuttgart, 
Germany, in 1980, when he began a seven-year tenure as general music 
director of the Stuttgart Opera, and re-established his home there 
in 1995, when he became chief conductor of the chamber orchestra. 
(In between, he was general music director of the City of Bonn.) He 
has maintained an apartment in Vienna, Austria, since he took over 
the radio orchestra in 1996, but he is now considering making Salzburg 
his base. He also keeps a sparsely furnished pied-a-terre in the New 
York's East Village, although his visits there may be little more 
than layovers. His most recent visit, in August, lasted less than 
24 hours, during which he conducted a recording session (finishing 
Glass' music for ``The Civil Wars,'' with the American Composers Orchestra, 
for Nonesuch), held business meetings, and had dinner with Glass, 
whose opera, ``The White Raven,'' was about to have its premiere, 
led by Davies, in Lisbon. ``I've just had one of those five-day periods 
that people are supposed to avoid,'' Davies said at the time. ``Lisbon 
on Sunday, Vienna on Monday, Salzburg on Tuesday, New York today, 
and tomorrow I'm going to visit my parents in Toledo.'' At 54, Davies 
has dropped the quasi-hippie trappings of yore. As his hair has started 
to gray, the long locks he sported around a balding pate in the early 
1980s and the ponytail of more recent years have given way to a shaved 
head and a closely trimmed salt-and-pepper beard that makes him look 
like Sean Connery. In Stuttgart, he has just started a complete traversal 
of the Haydn symphonies, which is scheduled to take 10 years, running 
through the bicentennial of Haydn's death, in 2009. This is an opportunity, 
he says, to work his way through the 107 works _ of which he has until 
now led only 25 _ at a comfortable pace, much as Helmuth Rilling did 
several years ago with the Bach cantatas. ``I had Rilling's Bach series 
in mind as a model, to be honest,'' Davies said. Yet the charms of 
the series for him are only partly musical. It is also an inventive 
packaging idea, and packaging is something European orchestras will 
have to take more seriously as government support dwindles. In this 
case Davies saw an opportunity to win the support of DaimlerChrysler, 
maker of Mercedes automobiles, which has a concert space in its new 
headquarters in Stuttgart. Davies explained: ``I went to them and 
said: `Why not do something really individual and serious? If you 
start now, you can celebrate the 200th anniversary of Haydn's death 
by finishing the series.''' He proposed five programs a year, each 
with two or three symphonies, and a young soloist in contrasting repertory. 
``So it's both an introductory series for young artists and a forum 
for the Haydn, which we are presenting in theme groups, rather than 
chronologically,'' he added. ``We can have a series of pieces about 
splendor, the Masons, different cities, the seasons. It's a way to 
do No. 43 and No. 97 together without worrying about it.'' The concerts 
are being recorded for CD release by ECM, the label for which Davies 
and the orchestra are also recording the major Mozart symphonies and 
piano concertos (with the jazz pianist Keith Jarrett as soloist) as 
well as a series of 20th-century works. Davies conducts a lot of new 
music in Stuttgart, but the Vienna Radio Symphony is even better bred 
to contemporary styles. And although it ranks behind the Vienna Philharmonic 
and the Vienna Symphony, its appearance last summer at the Salzburg 
Festival and its recent recordings of works by Glass and John Adams 
have given the orchestra an international profile. ``There are two 
special things about it,'' Davies said. ``One is that it has all the 
good women players, because the philharmonic wouldn't have them. Officially, 
that has now changed, and I believe the philharmonic, because they 
don't have any choice. If you look at the music schools, the majority 
of the good players are women, and they are especially motivated. 
Our orchestra is 40 percent women. ``The other thing I love about 
this orchestra is that you can't put a new score in front of them 
that they can't immediately sight-read. There is nothing they haven't 
done or don't know how to do. You're not confronted with opinions 
about the music. They just play it. I find that refreshing. And when 
we do the mixed programs I like to do, we can spend time working on 
Beethoven and Brahms, because the new music is the least of our worries.'' 
Like many American maestros, Davies has found that despite the availability 
of guest-conducting jobs with major American orchestras, music directorships 
are still offered mainly to Europeans. He does not seem particularly 
bitter about this situation and betrays little emotion when discussion 
turns to the number of big American orchestras _ principally, the 
New York Philharmonic and the Philadelphia and Cleveland orchestras 
_ now shopping for music directors. His response has been to build 
a solid career in Germany, and now Austria, over two decades, as well 
as a respectable discography of standard and contemporary works. His 
teaching post, too, suggests a permanent presence in Europe. At the 
Mozarteum, someone appointed to a professorship before age 55, like 
Davies, can retire at 68 and continue to draw a full salary. ``I was 
thinking about my later years,'' Davies said, ``and this seemed a 
bit of nice, prudent planning.'' In a way, Davies' slow departure 
from the American Composers Orchestra also represents prudent planning 
in that it leaves the organization ample time to find a successor, 
a process that has just begun. ``The orchestra is something Dennis 
and I cooked up over lunch, back in September 1975,'' said Francis 
Thorne, a composer and the orchestra's president. For the ensemble's 
first 15 years, Davies was its principal conductor, rather than music 
director; the programming was a collaboration with an advisory board 
of composers. When Thorne proposed changing the title to music director, 
in 1990, Davies imposed two conditions: that the orchestra increase 
the number of its concerts and that it adopt a definition of ``American'' 
that would embrace composers from all over the Western hemisphere. 
The series ``Sonidos de las Americas,'' which was started as a result 
in 1994, has explored the symphonic, chamber and folk music of a different 
Latin American country every year. In recent years he has allowed 
a few European composers into the programming, and the ``20th Century 
Snapshots'' series will embrace several more, including Ravel, whose 
Concerto for the Left Hand is featured in ``The Gershwin Circle.'' 
``For a long time, it was felt that there were too few opportunities 
for American composers, and our orchestra addressed that,'' Davies 
said. ``When we started `Sonidos,' some of the composers objected, 
until I was able to convince them that we had a chance to expand our 
influence in the community and that composers from other countries 
who participated would take American works home with them. And that 
has happened. ``This orchestra has done yeoman's work for more than 
20 years, and now I think it's time for it to become more international. 
You make friends for American music that way.''
