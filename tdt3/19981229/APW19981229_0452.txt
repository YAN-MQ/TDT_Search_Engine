Over 1,000 people, most of them Sarajevo cab drivers, blocked the 
downtown streets of the Bosnian capital Tuesday in a protest prompted 
by the murder of their colleague. Muslim cabdriver Denis Imamovic, 
22, went missing Sunday night after three men were seen entering his 
car. After a joint search of cabdrivers in the city as well as from 
Bosnian Serb territory, his body was found a few kilometers (miles) 
away from Sarajevo, in a pit next to the road that connects the capital 
with the wartime Bosnian Serb stronghold of Pale. As the news about 
the murder spread through the taxi radio system, more then 300 cab 
drivers from Sarajevo drove to the spot where Imamovic was found. 
But the drivers said that three people in a Bosnian Serb police car 
fired at them as they arrived at the scene. Some of the cabdrivers 
told the Sarajevo daily Dnevni Avaz that they recognized the Pale 
police chief among those who fired and that they were told that Imamovic's 
car was seen that morning in front of the Pale police station. Car 
theft appeared to be the motive, just like in three other previous 
killings of cabbies, that occurred since 1996, when the city opened 
up after the years-long Bosnian Serb siege. The bodies of all three 
other victims were also found in Bosnian Serb territory. Within hours 
after the shooting incident, more than 1,000 angry Sarajevo taxi drivers 
blocked roads into the city for several hours, demanding police from 
both entities to jointly control Sarajevo's entry points. U.N. spokeswoman 
Frederike Seidel, confirmed the body of the victim was found. Seidel 
said some of the demonstrators mobbed a U.N. vehicle damaging the 
car. Local police escorted the vehicle to safety without anybody being 
injured, she said. Seidel was unaware of the cabbies' demands for 
police checkpoints. Such checkpoints are forbidden by the Dayton Peace 
Agreement of 1995, which ended the 3 1/2 year long war. The aim was 
to encourage freedom of movement between the Muslim-Croat and the 
Bosnian Serb halves of the country. Cab drivers said Tuesday they 
want at least police checks of the identity of their passengers when 
they cross over to Bosnian Serb territory.
