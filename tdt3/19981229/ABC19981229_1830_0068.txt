Good evening. We begin tonight with more defiance from Iraq. "The 
war is still on," the Iraqi vice president said today. Iraq claims 
it is now patrolling the no-fly zones along its northern and southern 
borders and will shoot at any more planes that try to enter them. 
Pentagon officials say it's an effort by Saddam Hussein to provoke 
the U.S. into more military action, a day after the U.S. and Iraq 
traded fire. Today, the Pentagon released gun-sight video of the U.S. 
attack on an Iraqi military site. ABC's Barry Serafin reports. The 
Pentagon says this video shows an Iraqi surface-to-air missile being 
fired at U.S. planes yesterday. Military analysts do not quarrel with 
that, but say it is extremely difficult to see. It is not difficult 
to see what happened next, as American F-15s responded with laser-guided 
bombs. The U.S. Flyers describing each hit on the missile battery 
as a "splash." Splash, splash. Lasers on. Splash. There were a number 
of secondary explosions, indicating that the bombs hit either explosives 
or missiles stored at the site. Six bombs hit the target area. Iraqi 
leaders today continued to insist they will challenge U.S. planes. 
American officials do not believe a significant challenge will come 
from Iraq's air force, which is limited by training and maintenance 
problems. But missiles remain a concern. There are hundreds of launchers 
available to the Iraqis, and they probably have several thousand surface-to-air 
missiles left. That means they can scatter these systems all over 
southern and northern iraq. In fact, there are 19 surface-to-air missile 
batteries unaccounted for in Iraq, some of them believed to be in 
the no-fly zones. So it's a game of hide-and-seek, in which we have 
a lot of assets, but it's also a game that they can play well and 
they're not risking very much. The U.S. military is trying to downplay 
any sense of continuing crisis with Iraq, while, at the same time, 
stepping up its air reconnaissance search for the Iraqi missile batteries 
and making it clear that American planes will respond to any further 
challenges. Barry Serafin, ABC News, at the Pentagon.
