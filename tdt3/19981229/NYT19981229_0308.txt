Stock prices rose Tuesday for the eighth consecutive trading day, 
the longest winning streak in more than two years. Trading volume 
accelerated a bit from Monday but remained light. Still, year-end 
momentum pushed the Standard &AMP; Poor's 500-stock index and the 
Nasdaq composite index to new highs and propelled the Dow Jones industrial 
average to within 55 points of breaking its 9,374.27 record, which 
was set on Nov. 23. At the close, the blue-chip Dow index had gained 
94.23 points, or a little more than 1 percent, to 9,320.98. Over the 
last eight sessions, the Dow average has risen by 530 points, or 6 
percent. The Dow last rose for eight straight trading days in November 
1996, after President Clinton was re-elected. Extending its extraordinary 
gains this quarter, the S&AMP;P's 500 index rose 16.32 points, or 
1.33 percent, to 1,241.81. Since the end of September, the index is 
up more than 22 percent. The latest record in the Nasdaq composite 
index came despite a decline in red-hot Internet stocks. The index 
closed at 2,181.77, up 1.47. And the Russell 2000 index of small stocks 
gained 2.13, to 410.41. Analysts cautioned against reading too much 
into the market rise. ``Since there is generally an upward bias to 
prices as we move to the end of the year, it is quite possible year-end 
activity is distorting the significance of eight straight days of 
rallies,'' said Hugh Johnson, chief investment officer at First Albany 
Corp. ``But there is at least some significance to the fact that the 
market is doing well,'' Johnson said. ``Whether you look at the last 
eight days or at the quarter, the stock market is sending a fairly 
clear, strong message: The outlook for the economy and earnings is 
upbeat.'' According to data released Tuesday by the Investment Company 
Institute, a mutual fund trade group, the rally that began in October 
seems to have encouraged investors to funnel more money into stocks. 
But a spot check of leading mutual fund companies suggests that the 
flows have slowed this month. Partly because of tax reasons, the flow 
of new money into mutual funds generally eases in December. A net 
$13 billion was invested in stock funds in November, the institute 
said, up sharply from $2.5 billion in October. Bond funds attracted 
$9.14 billion, up from $5.4 billion in October. Flows into money market 
mutual funds remained strong, at $34.1 billion. But that figure represented 
a decline from the $45.8 billion that went into such accounts in October. 
The institute said that at the end of November, assets under management 
at all mutual funds totaled a record $5.37 trillion, up nearly 20 
percent from the start of the year. At the Vanguard Group, one of 
the largest mutual fund companies, business remains brisk, said John 
Woerth, a spokesman. So far this month, Vanguard has taken in about 
$3.8 billion, half of it directed into stock funds. By contrast, the 
pace at Fidelity Investments and Charles Schwab &AMP; Co. has been 
slower. At Fidelity, sales in equity and bond funds in December have 
been ``basically flat,'' said Anne Crowley, a spokeswoman. But more 
than $1.5 billion has moved into money market funds. Glen Mathison, 
a Schwab spokesman, said the company has had net inflows of just $22.6 
million into its funds so far this month, compared with $657 million 
for all of December 1997. Stocks were helped Tuesday by gains among 
such major retailers as Wal-Mart Stores and Gap Inc. on expectations 
that holiday sales were stronger than expected. Drug stocks rose on 
optimism that earnings growth in the sector will outpace those in 
other large-capitalization industries. And telephone shares advanced 
on hopes that they will benefit from growth in the Internet, since 
data for the worldwide computer network is carried over phone lines. 
Among the drug stocks that are included in the Dow, Johnson &AMP; 
Johnson rose 3 1/16, to 83|, and Merck gained 3 1/16, to 151 1/16. 
Bristol-Myers Squibb and Pfizer, drug companies that are major components 
of the S&AMP;P 500, also gained. Bristol Myers rose 4 15/16, to 133}. 
Pfizer gained 5 3/16, to 124|. Among telephone stocks, AT&AMP;T was 
the best-performing component of the Dow, rising 3}, to 78}. MCI WorldCom 
jumped 2 5/16, to 74\. And BellSouth rose 2\, to 48{. Technology stocks, 
which have rocketed higher over the quarter, retreated some Tuesday. 
Amazon.com fell 19|, to 332 5/16. Yahoo lost 5{, to 270. America Online 
dropped 2|, to 154|. And Microsoft lost 1~, to 140{.
