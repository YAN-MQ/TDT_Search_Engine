After months of political wrangling, Israel's parliament on Tuesday 
gave preliminary approval to a budget bill that is the backbone of 
the proposed 1999 state budget. The government had already canceled 
three votes on the ancillary budget bill for fear that Israeli Prime 
Minister Benjamin Netanyahu's fractured coalition could not muster 
the support necessary to approve it. When it finally came before the 
Knesset Monday, lawmakers defeated it by a tie vote of 55-55. In Tuesday's 
re-vote, the Knesset approved the bill 46 to 37. Defeating the budget 
is traditionally a sign of no-confidence in the government, but the 
Knesset has already indicated that by voting last week to dissolve 
itself and hold early elections on May 17. The Knesset's failure to 
approve the bill had prevented lawmakers from moving ahead with deliberations 
on the 1999 state budget. By law, the Knesset must approve a budget 
by midnight Thursday, but passage is unlikely by then because the 
spending plan still has several political obstacles to hurdle. The 
Knesset has to approve both the ancillary bill and the actual budget 
bill in two more readings. Before that, the bills head back to the 
Knesset Finance Committee, where political parties traditionally try 
to wrest concessions in exchange for supporting the budget. The budget 
bill itself passed by a sliver-thin 54-53 vote in a first reading 
in early November. Israel's budget has fallen victim this year to 
a riven coalition whose members withheld support to press political 
and budgetary demands on Netanyahu. The political wrangling over the 
budget was a major factor Finance Minister Yaakov Neeman resigned 
earlier this month.
