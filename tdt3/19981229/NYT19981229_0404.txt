Hans Oeschger, a Swiss geologist who sounded early warnings about 
the risk that emissions of industrial waste gases might bring on climate 
change, died on Friday, after a long illness, according to press reports 
from Bern, Switzerland. He was 71. He spent nearly 40 years in the 
Department of Physics at the University of Bern before retiring as 
emeritus professor of physics in 1995. He was honored for his life's 
work a year ago by the American Geophysical Union, which awarded him 
its Roger Revelle Medal. Oeschger believed that the emission of greenhouse 
gases had to be brought under control. To that end he pleaded for 
scientific and political action and for international documentation 
of the problem. His specialty was isotope geochemistry, and he contributed 
more than 200 articles to scientific publications. He was an advocate 
and practitioner of ice core research in both polar regions to track 
the world's climate as far back as possible. The American Geophysical 
Union, in its citation, said his teams of fellow scientists and students 
``pioneered many innovations, which have led to a better understanding 
of how the carbon cycle currently operates, how it might have differed 
during glacial time, and how human activity might alter it in the 
future.'' The carbon cycle is the exchange of carbon between living 
organisms and the nonliving environment. Oeschger's research covered 
many of its vital aspects as he studied climate changes occurring 
over many thousands of years. Snow that fell on woolly mammoths during 
the last ice age turned to solid ice and remains in place to this 
day. Oeschger suspected that the air breathed by the mammoths was 
there as well, trapped in bubbles for scientists to evaluate. He analyzed 
bubbles of fossil air locked deep into the layers of polar ice in 
Greenland and Antarctica and developed new methods for gaining information 
from the ice, including applying radiocarbon dating to this process. 
He invented the Oeschger counter, a contraption that measures tiny 
amounts of natural radiation. His work, going back 40 years, made 
him a world authority on the greenhouse effect. While he hypothesized 
that recurring ice ages brought drastic climate shifts throughout 
the earth's geological history, his research indicated that carbon 
dioxide in the atmosphere had markedly increased over the past 200 
years. Hans Oeschger was born in Ottenbach, near Zurich, Switzerland. 
He studied at the Federal Institute of Technology in Zurich and earned 
his doctorate in 1955 at the University of Bern, where he became a 
professor.
