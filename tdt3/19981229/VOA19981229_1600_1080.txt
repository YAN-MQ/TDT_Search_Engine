The U.S. college football post season continues today with Kansas 
State playing Purdue in one of three bowl games on the schedule. At 
the Alamo Dome in San Antonio, Texas, Kansas State takes on the Boilermakers 
in the Alamo Bowl. Wildcats coach, Bill Snyder, says Purdue has a 
lot of offense his team will have to control. It's pretty obvious 
for us that we would have to play very well on defense in order to 
have an opportunity to win the ball game. It's a very fine offense 
and they're very capable of moving the ball and have done so against 
any and every opponent that they've played against. Purdue coach, 
Joe Tiller, says the K State quarterback, Michael Bishop, is not the 
only weapon his Boilermaker defense will have to worry about. They've 
got an awful lot of talent in all those positions offensively, and 
you better be prepared to defend the running game or they might just 
run the ball, hand it off all night long. You may never see Michael 
Bishop throw a pass. Kansas State will be playing in a bowl game for 
the sixth straight year. Purdue is making its second straight trip 
to the Alamo Bowl. Meanwhile, Virginia Tech squares off against Alabama 
in the inaugural Music City Bowl in Nashville, Tennessee. And in the 
Micron P.C. Bowl, the University of Miami Hurricanes take on the North 
Carolina State Wolf Pack.
