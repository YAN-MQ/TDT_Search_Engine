The United States returned the stalled money for the fighter planes 
ordered by Pakistan, pushing the country's foreign exchange reserves 
above dlrs 1 billion for the first time since the nuclear tests in 
May, the finance minister said Tuesday. Washington has returned dlrs 
324.6 million for 28 F-16 fighter planes that Pakistan paid for in 
1989 but never received, Ishaq Dar told reporters. Delivery of the 
aircraft was stopped after 1990 when the United States ended all military 
and humanitarian aid to Pakistan to protest a program to develop nuclear 
weapons. A rise in remittances from Pakistani expatriate workers and 
export proceeds are also factors for the jump in foreign exchange 
reserves, the official said. Pakistan's foreign exchange reserves 
slumped sharply in the wake of economic sanctions from the major world 
powers for its nuclear tests in response to similar tests by rival 
India. India also faces sanctions, but its robust economy has not 
been affected as much as Pakistan. Pakistan's reserves hovered around 
dlrs 430 million until recently, barely enough to meet the country's 
import bill of three weeks. The reserves stood at dlrs 1.021 billion 
by late Monday, Dar said. ``The government has managed the economy 
in a reasonably good manner despite worldwide recession, economic 
turmoil in South East Asian countries and contraction of the Japanese 
economy,'' he said. Pakistan is scrambling to raise funds from global 
donor agencies to support its balance-of-payments gap and meet its 
obligations on external debt worth dlrs 32 billion. It is negotiating 
a dlrs 5.5 billion package with the International Monetary Fund which 
also includes restricting of debt from bilateral lenders. The United 
States has eased sanctions on India and Pakistan and said it will 
not oppose new loans to Islamabad from the IMF. ``Pakistan has already 
paid dlrs 300 million in debt repayments during the last couple of 
months and we will continue to meet our commitments on debt servicing,'' 
Dar said. ``The worst part of the crisis is over and the country's 
economic indicators are showing signs of improvement,'' he added. 
Pakistan's industrial growth rate was 3.0 percent for the July-October 
quarter compared to minus 1.3 percent during the corresponding period 
last year, Dar said. Inflation remained relatively low at 6.6 percent 
during the same period compared to 10.2 percent a year ago, he added. 
The trade deficit fell by 46 percent during July-November to dlrs 
554 million from about dlrs 1 billion last year for the same time 
span.
