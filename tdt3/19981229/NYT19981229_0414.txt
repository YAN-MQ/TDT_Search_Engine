A legislator who helped negotiate New York state's charter school 
law said Tuesday that ministers and religious groups who sought public 
funds to establish charter schools on church property were ``on shaky 
ground,'' and could easily run afoul of the new law. Assemblyman Steven 
Sanders, D-Manhattan, who is chairman of the Assembly Education Committee, 
said it would be a perversion of the bill for ministers to set up 
charter schools that would be in any way associated with their churches. 
The Rev. Floyd Flake of Queens and the Rev. Wyatt Tee Walker of Harlem 
have both said they want to set up secular schools, possibly on church 
property, with religious instruction available before and after school. 
``The stuff that Wyatt Tee Walker and Floyd Flake are suggesting they 
can do, they can't do,'' Sanders said. ``You can't take charter school 
money and put that charter school money in religious schools that 
have unused space.'' But aides to Gov. George Pataki, a Republican 
who pushed the law past resistance from the Democratic-controlled 
Assembly, disputed Sanders' interpretation. They said that while the 
law clearly prohibits the public funding of religious schools, it 
does not prevent a charter school from leasing property from a church 
or from including ministers and members of religious groups in its 
board of trustees. They pointed out that even now, some New York City 
public schools lease unused school buildings from the Roman Catholic 
Church. Norman Siegel, director of the New York Civil Liberties Union, 
said his organization would monitor any church-initiated charter schools 
on the separation of church and state. He said that providing religious 
instruction outside school hours might raise questions about the use 
of public money for religious purposes. ``The bottom line is that 
charter schools can't be a pretext for religious indoctrination,'' 
Siegel said. He said the NYCLU would also monitor the new schools 
to insure that they were not racially segregated and that they upheld 
due process rights like free speech. United Federation of Teachers 
president Randi Weingarten said Tuesday that she feared religious 
leaders intended to use charter schools as a first step toward government-funded 
vouchers to pay for private school tuition. ``Without the ink being 
dry on the bill, someone is trying to make this a subterfuge for directing 
funds into private schooling, whether it's religious schooling or 
other schooling,'' Ms. Weingarten said. Sanders acknowledged that 
ministers could not be barred from opening charter schools. But he 
said the law specifically prohibits private schools from converting 
to charter schools, and it sets up a series of criteria to make sure 
a charter school is distinct from existing private or church-affiliated 
schools. This includes showing that each school has substantially 
different officers and employees. He said this meant a janitor from 
a charter school could not then ``walk across the hall and pick up 
the garbage from a religious school.'' Flake, pastor of the Allen 
AME Church in Queens, said Tuesday that his goal was to provide strong 
education, with a curriculum approved by the state, for any child, 
not just church members. ``Whether those schools are chartered under 
faith-based charters or not is irrelevant,'' he said. Asked if charter 
schools might be racially segregated, he said: ``No more so than the 
public schools are.'' Chester Finn, a senior fellow and expert on 
charter schools at the Hudson Institute, a conservative research organization 
in Washington, said he was not at all troubled by the idea of clergy 
starting charter schools. He said that if universities with religious 
affiliations, like Brandeis and Notre Dame, are entitled to public 
money in the form of loans and grants, then charter schools should 
be also. ``The most interesting thing about the charter phenomenon 
in America is the number of different needs that it meets, the problems 
that it solves and the opportunities that it creates,'' Finn said. 
He said that in Arizona, it is common for children in charter and 
public schools to walk across the street to a Mormon seminary for 
religious instruction during free periods. Chris Carpenter, a spokesman 
for the New York State Board of Regents, which will monitor and approve 
charter schools, said applications would be examined to insure that 
they do not ``allow any inappropriate influence of religion.'' But 
he said the Regents would not ``automatically reject an application 
from anybody,'' whether clergy or not.
