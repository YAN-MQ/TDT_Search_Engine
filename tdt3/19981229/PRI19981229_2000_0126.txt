and southern parts of the country. U.S. and British planes patrol 
the no-fly zones. Nezar Hamdune is Iraq's ambassador to the United

said, many times, these no-fly zones are illegal. They're not established 
and they're only secured by -- and therefore they have to go. And 
if the Americans stay away from that, I don't see any problem on their 
planes. But if they try again to intrude the Iraqi airspace, the Iraqis 
will have to defend themselves. Nezar Hamdune. Baghdad adds its planes 
are flying normally in Iraqi airspace.
