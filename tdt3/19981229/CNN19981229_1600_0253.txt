President Clinton says the government can do more to protect children. 
During a ceremony this morning, he called for $10 million in grants 
to be given to states to help local authorities educate parents about 
child abuse and neglect. He also wants it to be easier for federal 
prosecutors to prove a felony child murder charge in court. We've 
made significant progress to make our children's lives safer. But 
if you look at the numbers of people who are still involved, that 
the statistics are staggering and unacceptable. So I say, the fact 
that this progress has been made should give us courage, should give 
us hope, but should steel our determination to do the much, much greater 
work that lies ahead. There is no excuse for us to lose any of our 
children. Mr. Clinton is summoning law enforcement, mental health 
experts and others for a national summit next may on children and 
violence.
