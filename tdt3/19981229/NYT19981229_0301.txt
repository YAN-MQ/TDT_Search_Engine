If the theater is a temple, it's no surprise that the most popular 
faith on Broadway this holiday season is ``The Blue Room,'' to which 
pilgrims flock from miles around to worship Nicole Kidman's tush. 
But given the competing prurience on tap this year, anyone who sees 
``The Blue Room'' must be baffled. It's no Starr report. You pay your 
money _ even $35 balcony seats are scalped for hundreds _ and all 
you get is 100 minutes of arch acting-class skits in which Ms. Kidman's 
backside (and only her backside) is visible undraped for about five 
seconds. The dim lighting hasn't been turned up a watt since the similar 
faux-nude tableau in ``Hair'' 30 years ago. Let the sunshine in _ 
please! The shortfall between the show's lurid reputation and its 
PG-13 content _ as well as that between its status as a highfalutin 
cultural event and its slim theatrical rewards _ once more proves 
that our waning century's most powerful invention, publicity, can 
alter even empirical reality once harnessed to sex to sell a product. 
The notoriously rapacious promotional machine of Ms. Kidman and her 
husband, Tom Cruise, has pulled off the feat of making cynical, allegedly 
sophisticated New Yorkers look like rubes who shell out big bucks 
for a carny show that's all smoke and mirrors once they're inside 
the tent. What brought the product, Ms. Kidman, to Broadway? She isn't 
a has-been, like the usual TV refugees who turned up as novelty acts 
in ``Grease.'' Nor is she in the category of Christian Slater, currently 
doing penance in another play, ``Side Man,'' to re-establish his employability 
after a highly public detox. And she doesn't need her paltry Broadway 
paycheck. (The entire box-office gross for the 12-week run of ``The 
Blue Room'' equals roughly a fifth of what Cruise alone makes per 
picture.) Officially, yes, Ms. Kidman simply yearned to return to 
her stage roots in a classic. (``The Blue Room'' is an updating of 
Arthur Schnitzler, albeit in Cliff Notes form.) The actual motive, 
though, is a stalled screen career. Ms. Kidman's recent movies (``The 
Peacemaker,'' ``Practical Magic'') didn't set the world on fire, so 
it's time to manufacture buzz _ and where cheaper or easier to do 
it than on star-and-sex-deprived Broadway, where the biggest celebrities 
are ``Lion King'' puppets, vanity productions can be assembled for 
a fraction of Hollywood's cost, and only 1,000 seats a night need 
be sold to earn the accolade ``smash hit''? The ``Blue Room'' agenda 
was dictated to a compliant Newsweek, which set the tone for the monkey-see 
media to follow. Ms. Kidman, we were told, is no longer ``Mrs. Tom 
Cruise, a nepotistic status assigned to her by a twitchy, bitchy Hollywood,'' 
but a budding superstar heading for ``what may be a career unlike 
any other.'' Eager to hop on the ``Blue Room'' gravy train for its 
own commercial purposes, Newsweek oversold the sexual come-on, taking 
a lead from the British critic, apparently on sabbatical from a monastery, 
who had fatuously labeled Ms. Kidman's performance ``pure theatrical 
Viagra'' at its debut in London. The magazine's cover announced that 
``Nicole Kidman bares all,'' and its article led with the empty promise 
that the star would be seen on stage ``in various percentages of undress 
(including a climactic 100 percent).'' The play's artistic bona fides 
were similarly hyped: the director, Sam Mendes, and adaptor, David 
Hare, lent ``The Blue Room'' their cachet but not their best efforts. 
Ms. Kidman is a good actress. If she had found a stage vehicle as 
challenging as her best movie, ``To Die For,'' she might have had 
an acting rather than a publicity triumph. Instead she became one 
of the few stars of recent seasons to be denied a unanimous standing 
ovation on her Broadway opening night. The morning after, New York 
critics blew the whistle on the whole stunt, noting its acute shortfall 
as both sex show and cultural event. Too little, too late. Ticket 
buyers had already been suckered into spending some $4 million in 
advance to subsidize Ms. Kidman's image makeover, and what New Yorker 
wants to admit he's been had? A ticket to ``The Blue Room,'' the terminally 
tedious club no one can get into, still confirms status, even if anyone 
in search of pure theatrical Viagra might have had a better shot with 
the Rockettes.
