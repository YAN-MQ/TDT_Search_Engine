And now with the rest of the day in sports, here's Jim Stevenson. 
Tennessee football coach Phil Folmer may be thinking his favorite 
number is one. Not only are the volunteers ranked number one among 
U.S. college football teams, but Folmer is to sign a new contract 
that will raise his earnings to more than $1 million a year. The deal 
will make Folmer the second highest paid coach in the southeastern 
conference behind Steve Spurrier of Florida, who is taking home $11.7 
million over six years. Folmer stands to earn an additional $40,000 
if his volunteers can defeat the Florida State Seminoles in the national 
championship game. The two teams will meet in the Fiesta Bowl in Tempe, 
Arizona on January the 4th.
