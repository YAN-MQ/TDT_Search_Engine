Former Senate Majority Leader George Mitchell called the first meeting 
Tuesday of a panel investigating claims that bribes helped Salt Lake 
City win the 2002 Winter Olympic games. He planned a news conference 
early this afternoon to discuss the direction of that investigation. 
Mitchell, who helped broker a peace accord in Northern Ireland, was 
appointed by U.S. Olympic officials last week to head the investigation. 
He's also been mentioned as a possible point man in President Bill 
Clinton's efforts to avoid impeachment. Accusations of scandal and 
bribery have rocked the Olympic movement, prompting the International 
Olympic Committee to call for the first inquiry, followed by Salt 
Lake organizers early this month asking its independent ethics panel 
to investigate. The Justice Department is conducting a preliminary 
review of the case. And the USOC appointed a five-member panel headed 
by Mitchell to look into the bidding process by American cities. The 
IOC expects to wrap up its own probe by Jan. 23. Salt Lake organizers, 
meanwhile, have said its ethics board would report its findings no 
later than Feb. 11. Any delays would likely irritate sponsors who 
pay an increasing percentage of the multimillion-dollar sports budget 
and have told Olympic brass they want the controversy dealt with swiftly. 
Olympic officials have been contacting sponsors to assure them action 
is being taken to maintain the Olympics image of high ideals and ethics.
