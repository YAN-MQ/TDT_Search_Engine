Iraq is challenging ``no-fly'' zones over its northern and southern 
territory by flying its warplanes through skies patrolled by the United 
States and Britain, Iraq's vice president said Tuesday. During an 
interview with Associated Press Television News, Taha Yassin Ramadan 
was asked if Iraq was flying its own aircraft in the no-fly zones. 
He replied: ``We are doing it right now.'' ``Iraqi planes, in effect, 
are flying in a normal manner in Iraqi airspace,'' Ramadan said. The 
move came a day after U.S. aircraft fired on an Iraqi anti-aircraft 
battery in the northern ``no-fly'' zone. Iraq says the U.S. attack 
killed four soldiers and wounded seven others. Ramadan also said Iraq 
will continue firing at any aircraft that intrudes on its airspace. 
``Our resistance will continue against any penetration,'' he said. 
``The war is still on.'' He did not specify whether the Iraqi aircraft 
flying in the zones were military or civilian, but almost all of Iraq's 
passenger aircraft are either out of the country or unusable. Ramadan's 
statements came on a day when U.S. and British jets were not in the 
air in the north. Lt. Col. Jane Rinell, spokeswoman for the Northern 
Watch operation at Incirlik airbase in Turkey, said allied planes 
``did not fly today strictly due to the weather and nothing else.'' 
In Washington and London, defense spokesmen said U.S. and British 
warplanes won't be intimidated by the latest threats. ``We will continue 
to enforce the 'no-fly' zones,'' Lt. Col. Stephen Campbell said at 
the Pentagon. ``Nothing has changed.'' The United States says its 
planes fired Monday in self-defense after coming under Iraqi missile 
attack, while Iraq claims it fired in self-defense after Western warplanes 
intruded on Iraqi skies. The United States and Gulf War allies set 
up the ``no-fly'' zones in northern and southern Iraq in 1991 and 
1992 to protect Kurdish rebels and Shiite Muslims from President Saddam 
Hussein's forces. But Ramadan said Tuesday that ``the so-called air 
exclusion zones exist only in the sick imagination of the British 
and American administrations.'' The Iraqi defiance is likely to escalate 
its confrontation with the United States and Britain, which bombed 
Iraq for four nights from Dec. 16 and Dec. 19. The state aim of the 
airstrikes was to diminish Iraq's ability to build weapons of mass 
destruction, which U.N. weapons inspectors were trying to dismantle 
until they withdrew Dec. 16, complaining of Iraqi obstruction. Iraq 
says 62 soldiers and more than 40 civilians were killed in the strikes. 
Iraq alleges that many civilian targets were hit, and not just defense 
sites as the United States maintains. Iraq also claimed Monday that 
it shot down an ``enemy plane,'' but U.S. officials said all American 
planes had returned safely. The claim appeared in banner headlines 
in all Baghdad newspapers Tuesday. ``An enemy plane is shot down and 
search is under way for the wreckage and pilot,'' the Babil newspaper, 
owned by Saddam's oldest son, Odai, trumpeted. But commentaries and 
editorials made no mention of the four Iraqi soldiers reportedly killed 
in the U.S. attack. The new challenge over the ``no-fly'' zones comes 
as Iraq is trying to boost its support in the Arab world, where there 
is widespread sympathy for Iraqi civilians suffering under U.N. economic 
sanctions imposed after Iraq's 1990 invasion of Kuwait. Iraqi newspapers 
Tuesday hailed widespread public protests in Arab capitals against 
the U.S.-British airstrikes and criticized Arab governments, which 
have voiced little opposition to the bombardment. Under U.N. resolutions, 
the sanctions cannot be lifted until U.N. weapons inspectors certify 
that Iraq is free of nuclear, chemical and biological weapons along 
with long-range missiles. Arab leaders must either support Iraq or 
risk the ``wrath'' of the Arab masses, the newspapers said, noting 
the Arab League's failure to convene a proposed meeting to condemn 
the bombardment. In a front-page editorial, Iraq's al-Qadissiya newspaper 
warned Arab leaders that ignoring ``the snowballing Arab wrath ... 
will shake the ground from under their feet.''
