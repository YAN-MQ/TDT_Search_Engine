Three buses full of passengers, three serious accidents over the space 
of just this past holiday week. The deaths and injuries and the timing 
have raised serious questions about what's being done to protect passengers. 
Our report tonight from NBC's Pat Dawson. Most tour bus trips end 
without incident, but the exceptions can be serious, even deadly. 
On Christmas eve, eight people died in this charter bus to Atlantic 
City. Federal investigators still don't know the cause. But some passengers 
claim speed was a factor. There are numerous factors. It could be 
vehicle maintenance. The Christmas eve crash was the first of three 
in New Jersey in the last five days injuring 59 people. And before 
that, in September, a tour bus headed from San Francisco to reno, 
skidded off interstate 80, killing two and injuring 37. In June, a 
bus crashed into a tractor trailer on a Pennsylvania turnpike, killing 
seven. Despite these dramatic crashes, U.S. highway statistics show 
fatal tour bus accidents are pretty rare. But even so, investigators, 
industry figures, even many drivers admit there are plenty of safety 
problems. While ten people were killed in commercial bus crashes in 
1997, there were 51,000 accidents. People have been passengers on 
buses to Atlantic City clearly know that with great degree of regularity, 
those buses are speeding. At Hansen's bus world in Atlantic City, 
drivers who've dropped off their passengers wait long hours to take 
them home. Some of the guys have to really run really hard. But I 
guess everybody has to make money. Federal regulations limit charter 
bus drivers to ten hours of driving a day. But that regulation dates 
from the 1930s when driving was much easier, speeds were much slower 
and distances traveled, much shorter. And while none would say so 
on camera, drivers privately admitted they often violated another 
federal regulation, limiting their total work day, driving and waiting, 
to 15 hours. There are also no laws requiring seat belts on commercial 
buses. But safety experts point to speeding as the most serious problem. 
There needs to be strict enforcement. These recent crashes are likely 
to result in calls for just that. But with thousands of commercial 
bus companies at work across the country, establishing one standard 
and enforcing it isn't likely to be easy. Pat Dawson, NBC news, New 
York.
