None of the inmates who escaped from a Tennessee prison got far before 
being captured. Aram Roston reports, they claimed an important victim, 
the credibility of the Tennessee security system. Police found the 
last of the inmates hiding in a crawl space beneath a west Nashville 
home, convicted murderer Aaron tyron James had less than 36 hours 
of freedom before heading back to prison. We got two in custody. Convicted 
burglar Jay Roy Denton and Lyle Van ulzen, a convicted murderer and 
arsonist, were arrested six hours earlier, filthy after a Night in 
the cold and rain. The first three escapees had been captured the 
night before. The prison break early Sunday morning by a group that 
included three convicted killers has raised some serious concerns 
about security at the relatively new prison. I'm very, very disturbed 
and worried about a maximum security prison having six inmates at 
one time -- one inmate is too many -- but having six inmates at one 
time escape from a maximum security prison in Nashville, Tennessee, 
makes me very upset. The corrections department says three officers 
were subdued by inmates armed only with a homemade knife. The commissioner 
of corrections says no prison is escape proof, but says it's not clear 
who's at fault. Wouldn't you say it's kind of obvious somebody may 
have done something wrong here? They escaped, so I think that's a 
good assumption. The six inmates managed to run all the way to a 12-foot 
razor-wire fence and climb over it. They were not detected until the 
fence alarm system went off. And then, no one got there in time to 
catch them. Aram Roston, CNN, Nashville, Tennessee.
