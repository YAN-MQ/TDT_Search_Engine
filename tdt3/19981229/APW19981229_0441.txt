A Swedish priest was sentenced to 30 days in jail on Tuesday after 
admitting he attempted to smuggle two men into Denmark. The 62-year-old 
Lutheran priest, whose identity was not publicly disclosed, was arrested 
late Monday in Nakskov, southern Denmark, upon arrival from Germany 
by ferry. During a random check, police found the men, who were believed 
to be from Iraq, hidden in his car trunk. The priest told the court 
in the town of Maribo that his motives were humanitarian. He picked 
up the men in Austria and Germany, Danish radio reported. The court 
banned him from entering Denmark for the next five years. The two 
refugees likely would be returned to Germany.
