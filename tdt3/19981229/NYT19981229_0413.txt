Andrew Johnson, the only U.S. president other than Bill Clinton to 
be impeached, is suddenly a media personality of the late 20th century. 
Imagine what he would say to Geraldo. (``It was petty vindictiveness 
by my Radical Republican enemies''?) In his absence, people are making 
do with Eric Foner, DeWitt Clinton Professor History at Columbia University 
and author of a definitive work on Reconstruction, the era of Johnson's 
political demise. Foner knows Johnson better than most, and perhaps 
more than he would like. ``The main reason they tried to get rid of 
him is that he was a total incompetent,'' the historian said Tuesday, 
cheerfully, about the nation's 17th president, who was impeached in 
1868, then acquitted by one vote in a Senate trial. ``But unfortunately, 
that is not an impeachable offense.'' Johnson, he added, was ``a strange, 
strange person'' _ Foner's book describes him as self-absorbed, lonely 
and racist _ who was ``really not that equipped for the position.'' 
The similarity of Johnson's impeachment to Clinton's? ``Both are culminations 
of long periods of hostility,'' Foner said. ``And the immediate cause, 
or catalyst, is not the real issue.'' In the case of Johnson, Foner 
said, it was not his apparent violation of the Tenure of Office Act 
when he ousted Edwin Stanton as secretary of war, but the three years 
of conflict between the president and Congress over what kind of nation 
post-slavery America should be. In Clinton's case, he said, it was 
not the relationship with Monica Lewinsky, but the continuation of 
the cultural wars of the 1960s _ the decade, Foner said, that saw 
both anti-war protests and the rise of Barry Goldwater. ``Conservative 
Republicans have hated Clinton since he was elected,'' Foner said. 
``He represents draft-dodging in Vietnam, he represents moral decay, 
he represents feminism and the decline of family values.'' Foner, 
55, describes himself as ``on the left'' (he is on the editorial board 
of The Nation) and says he has little respect for Clinton. ``He's 
going to be seen as a big wasted opportunity,'' Foner said. ``I'm 
not a fan of his, because I think that his personal recklessness has 
helped to sabotage whatever hopes people had for his presidency.'' 
Nonetheless, Foner thinks that both impeachments were ``not the right 
mechanism for solving these problems.'' Foner talked in his office 
in Columbia's Fayerweather Hall, built in 1910 and seemingly not touched 
since. Foner, who has a large office entirely lined with books, likes 
it that way. He talked happily for an hour and a half, as rain fell 
moodily on the red brick walkways outside. After the interview, he 
took his 11-year-old daughter, Daria, to the Christmas show at Radio 
City Music Hall, and said he liked the camels. Foner's wife, Lynn 
Garafola, is a dance critic and dance historian. The family lives 
in a big Columbia faculty apartment on 116th Street. It seems like 
a nice life, although Foner does not necessarily recommend that spouses 
who are historians work together on a project, as he and his wife 
have for an exhibit about 50 years of the New York City Ballet at 
the New-York Historical Society next spring. ``It's like playing mixed 
doubles with your wife,'' Foner said. ``It's a bad idea.'' Last fall, 
Foner said he had ``a minor little career as a public figure'' when 
he went on a tour promoting ``The Story of American Freedom,'' his 
latest book. And now this. ``Suddenly, with impeachment,'' he said, 
``I've had a new lease on life.'' The radio shows are calling, and 
so on. His best-known book is ``Reconstruction: America's Unfinished 
Revolution,'' published in 1988, which won numerous awards and synthesized 
the revisionist view of Reconstruction that began in the 1960s. In 
this view, Johnson was not trying to carry out Abraham Lincoln's magnanimous 
policies toward the South. Rather, Johnson was a racist opposed to 
black suffrage, and the blacks themselves were central actors in Reconstruction. 
One of Foner's lesser-known works is his five-minute version of American 
history for the Hall of Presidents at Disney World. ``Even Disney 
realized that the idea that the United States had begun perfectly 
and was getting better ever since was not right,'' he said. His version 
suggested ``that the history of the United States is on ongoing conflict 
between ideals and reality.'' Foner learned that in part growing up 
in Long Beach, N.Y., where his father, a historian, struggled to make 
a living by free-lance writing and lecturing after he was fired in 
1941 from City College _ along with some 50 others _ for what was 
called ``subversive activities.'' (Foner described his father as part 
of the ``Old Left.'') Foner went on to Columbia, wanting to be an 
astronomer, but by his junior year couldn't handle the math. At the 
same time, he was inspired by a course he took in Civil War history, 
in 1962, which made him realize that the racial crises of the time 
were rooted in the events of a century before. He was hooked. How 
will historians look back on political America in 1998 and 1999? ``If 
Clinton is removed from office, it will be a major turning point,'' 
Foner said. ``If the Senate ends up censuring him, historians will 
view the whole episode with a certain bemusement, and will wonder 
how it got to be such a big thing in Congress for a while.''
