Israel will likely vote to elect a prime minister and new parliament 
on May 17th. A parliamentary committee has given initial approval 
to early elections. The full parliament will vote on the date Monday. 
The body decided last week to hold advance elections. The move was 
approved after many hardliners said they had lost confidence in current 
prime minister Benjamin Netanyahu because he agreed to trade land 
for peace with the Palestinians. Meantime, Israeli foreign minister 
ariel Sharon says he hasn't ruled out running against Netanyahu for 
prime minister. Sharon was the architect of the Israeli invasion of 
Lebanon in 1983.
