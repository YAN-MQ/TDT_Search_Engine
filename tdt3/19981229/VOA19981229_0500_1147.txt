While the end of the year is bright for Phil Folmer, there are five 
coaches in the National Football League who are now looking for new 
jobs. After his third straight losing season and tenth consecutive 
loss to the Green Bay Packers, the Chicago Bears have fired coach 
Dave Wanstadt. The Carolina Panthers will have a new coach next season 
after firing Dom Capers, the only coach in the franchise's history. 
Capers says he did not win enough games to keep his job. I understood 
at the time I took the job that our responsibility was to win football 
games. And this year, we did not win enough football games. And that's 
life in the NFL. And so I'm sorry to say that that's the reason that 
the Carolina Panthers will have a new head football coach next year. 
Ray Rhodes also felt the sting of losing but says he understands why 
the Philadelphia Eagles let him go. This has been - It's about production, 
and I'm very well aware of that. When you don't win, you know, changes 
have to be made. And this is a part of the business - This is a tough 
part of the business, but this is part of the business. Other NFL 
coaches fired on Monday included Ted Marchabroda of the Baltimore 
Ravens and Dennis Erickson of the Seattle Seahawks.
