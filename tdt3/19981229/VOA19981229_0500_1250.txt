The season appears to be over before it beings in the National Basketball 
Association after five hours of secret negotiation Sunday ended with 
both sides still far apart. With a January 7th league imposed deadline 
to reach a deal or scrap the entire season, commissioner David Stern 
and players chief Billy Hunter offered no optimism. Stern says he 
made a final proposal with some improvements, but the league's chief 
legal officer says he thinks it's not enough. Only six people were 
on hand for the secret meeting in Denver with no announced plans to 
get together again.
