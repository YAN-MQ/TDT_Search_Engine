It may be winter, but it's no wonderland for many residents of the 
pacific northwest and the southeast. Flood warnings are posted for 
half a dozen Washington state rivers, and more rain is on the way. 
A mudslide caused by flooding buried a 100-foot section of U.S. highway 
101 in Oregon yesterday. Other rural roads across Washington and Oregon 
are under water. Across the southeast, tens of thousands of people 
who lost power in a Prechristmas ice storm still have not had their 
electric service restored. Virginia was especially hard hit. Power 
company officials say crews are working to get the lights back on 
for about 50,000 virginians. This last 50,000 is taking some time, 
because the areas hit there were just, we're having to rebuild the 
system itself. That is putting in new poles, cross beams and wire.
