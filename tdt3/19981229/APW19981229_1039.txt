Russia attracted dlrs 2 billion in foreign direct investment in 1998, 
only about half what was invested the year before, a news agency reported 
Tuesday, citing an Economics Ministry official. The relatively paltry 
foreign capital inflows, given the country's size, reflected investors' 
concerns over the Russian economy, heightened by the recent financial 
crisis and the ruble's collapse, Vladimir Yefimov said. ``Unfortunately, 
this is a very small volume given the state of our industry,'' Yefimov 
told the ITAR-Tass news agency. By comparison, foreign direct investments 
in Poland, the Czech Republic and Hungary, whose combined population 
of almost 60 million is less than half that of Russia, will total 
about dlrs 11.4 billion in 1998. Direct foreign investment in Russia 
reached dlrs 3.9 billion in 1997 before collapsing this year. Yefimov 
predicted that direct investment _ that is, investment directly in 
companies, as opposed to stocks or other financial instruments _ would 
reach dlrs 2.5 billion in 1999. With the Russian economy plagued by 
barter, most Russian manufactures are cash-starved and use obsolete 
equipment, producing goods that often fail to compete with more expensive 
imports. Given the size of the market, many foreign corporations were 
willing to overcome endless hurdles to come in Russia in early 1990s, 
betting on the economy's turnaround by the end of the century. In 
light of the economic crisis that gripped the country after the ruble 
was devalued in August, that turnaround seems more remote than ever. 
The government expects the economy to have shrunk about 5 percent 
in 1998 after posting modest signs of recovery in 1997. Investors 
prefer countries that are open, stable and provide promising return 
on their capital, Yefimov said.
