Floods and mudslides in the Northwest of the country are blocking 
roads and stranding residents. Rain, mud and snow have hit Oregon, 
particularly hard. Melting snow is creating mudslides in Washington 
state, as well. In the Southeast, electricity should be fully restored 
in Virginia by tomorrow. Good news in San Francisco, however, where 
dense fog is lifting.
