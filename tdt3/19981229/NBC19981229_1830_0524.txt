We learned more today about the timing and direction of what the U.S. 
senate is about to undertake -- putting the president on trial for 
impeachment. Even though talk of a deal still swirls around Washington. 
NBC's Claire Shipman with us from the White House tonight with the 
very latest. Brian, tonight we're seeing a preview of just how difficult 
it may be for the Senate to avoid a lengthy trial. The Senate leadership 
on both sides has agreed to move quickly. The White House likes the 
idea. But key players could prove to be spoilers -- the White House 
and the prosecution, house republicans. As the team of house republicans 
known as impeachment managers met today to discuss how they want to 
make their case at trial, Senate majority leader trent Lott told NBC 
news he wants a streamlined proceeding -- two weeks from start to 
finish. Lott's proposal -- next Wednesday, the first day Congress 
is back, he announces that the Senate is ready to hear the bills of 
impeachment. The next day, Thursday, the house managers read the bills 
of impeachment. And chief justice William rehnquist swears in the 
senators for the trial. The trial itself begins Monday, January 11th, 
and according to Lott, could finish with a vote to acquit or convict 
by January 22nd, two weeks later. A censure resolution would follow. 
The democratic leadership likes this schedule as well. Both sides 
have agreed there is no need to call witnesses -- Monica lewinsky 
for example. But the house managers are already complaining. Many 
want more time and witnesses. I'm anticipating, that based on everything 
we've discussed in there today, that there would be witnesses. As 
for the White House, the president's defense team likes the idea of 
a streamlined trial and is willing to give up their right to a Lengthy 
defense as long as house republicans do the same. Brian? Claire Shipman 
at the White House for us tonight.
