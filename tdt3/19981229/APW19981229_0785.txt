Saying they were ``very sorry'' but refusing to accept responsibility, 
two top Khmer Rouge leaders asked Cambodians to ``let bygones be bygones'' 
Tuesday and forget about the genocide of the 1970s. Khieu Samphan 
and Nuon Chea were flown by helicopter from a former rebel stronghold 
to the capital to defect _ in effect, surrender _ to Prime Minister 
Hun Sen after he pledged they would not face trial for crimes against 
humanity. At a news conference, they were asked by journalists _ many 
of them Cambodians who lost family members _ if they felt any remorse 
for causing the deaths of as many as 2 million of their countrymen 
out of a population of about 9 million.
