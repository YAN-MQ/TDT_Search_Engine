An Indonesian businessman who escaped from jail in 1996 after being 
convicted of fraud is running a successful brewery in China, local 
media reported Tuesday. Eddy Tansil, who was sentenced to 20 years 
in prison in one of Indonesia's biggest financial scandals, has business 
ties to Germany's Beck's Beer Co., a watchdog group said. Minister 
of Justice Muladi said the government has asked its embassy in Beijing 
to check the validity of the report. If true, Indonesia will ask Beijing 
to extradite Tansil, Muladi told the state-run TVRI television station. 
``There is no extradition agreement (between Jakarta and Beijing) 
but we are arranging for that,'' he said. Tansil is owner of Putian 
Golden Key Brewery Co. in the Chinese city of Putian in Fujian province, 
newspapers quoted the Gempita group as saying. Gempita is the acronym 
in the Indonesian language for Movement of Concerned Citizens to Save 
State Assets. Established in 1992, Putian Golden Key is now a major 
player in China's premium beer market and is worth dlrs 10 million, 
Gempita chairman Albert Hasibuan said. It allegedly has a licensing 
agreement with Beck's Beers. Tansil was convicted in 1994 of defrauding 
the government of dlrs 430 million in a case that became a symbol 
of official corruption in Indonesia. Prosecutors said he obtained 
the money as a loan after bribing officials of state-owned Bank Pembangunan 
Indonesia, or Bapindo. Tansil said he would use the loan to build 
a petrochemicals factory, but then pocketed part or all of the money. 
The factory was never completed. Two former Cabinet ministers were 
questioned in court, but never indicted. After serving two years of 
his sentence, Tansil escaped from jail after bribing jail officials 
and eluded a nationwide manhunt. Gempita said Tansil has not changed 
his name since his arrest and is known in China as ``Mr. E.T.'' Widespread 
allegations of official corruption helped erode the credibility of 
former President Suharto, who quit in May after riots and protests 
against his rule. Much of the rioting by Indonesia's poor was directed 
at the homes and shops of ethnic Chinese because of their relative 
wealth and perceived links to corrupt government officials.
