There was a time when memories were painful. They just reminded me 
of how far away I was from feeling like myself. I couldn't get out 
of bed. I was always tired. I hardly ate. I stopped wanting to be 
around people. Sometimes, I felt like, "what's the use?" My friends, 
they'd say, "cheer up. You have everything." But I was so depressed, 
I couldn't snap out of it. You can't just snap out of clinical depression. 
No one can because it's a real illness with real causes. But you can 
get your life back. A first step is giving us a call. We'll send you 
a free, confidential information kit... with facts about depression 
and treatment that's worked for millions... and a symptoms checklist 
that can make it easier... to talk with a doctor about how you're 
feeling. Now, I already have my wish. I have my life back.
