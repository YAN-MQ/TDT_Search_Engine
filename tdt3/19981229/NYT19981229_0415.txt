If you saw her at all, you'd see her in a cemetery late at night. 
She'd be clambering about one of those huge cemeteries in Brooklyn 
and Queens, the ones beneath the flight paths to La Guardia and Kennedy; 
graveyards with names like Evergreen, Mount Neboh and Cypress Hills. 
She was there on the hottest summer night when New Yorkers without 
air-conditioners couldn't sleep, and she was there when the temperature 
was below zero and the snow was hip-deep and nobody was awake. Amid 
the polished marble sentries guarding the dead of a great city, Gloria 
Marie De Martini Stradtner looked only for life. Mrs. Stradtner, who 
died on Dec. 22 at the age of 72, looked for stray animals. She looked 
for the thousands of dogs and cats abandoned every year by people 
who, having tired of their pets, thought not of bringing them to an 
animal shelter but of leaving them in a cemetery. Humans may think 
of cemeteries as woodland-like sanctuaries. But for animals, they 
are only places to starve to death in the wild. But Gloria _ as everyone 
called her _ was determined that this was not to be. Not for her strays. 
And so for 50 years or maybe more (nobody can remember when she did 
not make the rounds of the graveyards at night), she would go forth, 
lugging large bags of dog food and cat food and traps of the type 
that cannot hurt animals. She would bait these traps and go back to 
her car and wait. In an hour or so, she would return to her traps. 
Sometimes, she would entrap a dozen animals or more in a single night, 
her prisoners of love. And then she would feed them. Mrs. Stradtner 
never had much money, and so to supplement the dog and cat food she 
bought with her Social Security money she would take jobs working 
in catering halls, even when she was getting on in years, so she could 
scoop up the scraps and bring them to her strays. When she was younger, 
back in the 1950s, she worked as a clerk and data entry specialist 
for IBM. But she did not mind doing menial work in a catering hall. 
Not if it meant she could feed the animals. And after she fed them, 
she would spend the next day making the rounds of veterinarians, imploring 
their help to neuter the dogs and cats (they usually charged her reduced 
fees). And then she would visit the shelters, asking them to take 
and care for the abandoned pets. One shelter was Pegeen Fitzgerald's 
Last Post Animal Sanctuary in Litchfield County, Conn., near the Massachusetts 
line. They try to specialize in housing cats there, but when Mrs. 
Stradtner showed up with dogs from the graveyards of New York, they 
took in dogs, too. ``I would estimate she saved thousands of animals,'' 
said Jeanne Toomey, who runs Last Post. ``She was wonderful. She'd 
name dogs and cats in the cemetery and she'd bring them up here. Nobody 
could refuse her.'' She visited animal sanctuaries in Long Island, 
upstate and in New Jersey, too, and nobody refused her in those places, 
either. Sometimes, her friends would go with her on her night visits. 
Michael Puccino, an executive with a Manhattan computer consulting 
firm, and his wife, Anne Marie, a veterinary nurse, would help whenever 
they could. And the cemetery workers helped, too. When it was bitter 
cold, the workers in at least one cemetery opened the door to a heated 
mausoleum so the strays could spend the night there. In another cemetery, 
they built little igloos in the bitterest part of the winter, hoping 
that Mrs. Stradtner's strays would use them to keep warm. Puccino 
told her more than once that cemeteries are not the safest places 
to be after dark. But she scoffed at such advice. ``She was the most 
adventurous, the liveliest individual you'd ever meet,'' Puccino said. 
When she was in her 70s, everybody thought she was in her 50s. Last 
August, somebody stole her car, which was parked on a Brooklyn street 
near the house on Chestnut Street where she lived. ``She called me, 
and she didn't care about the car,'' Puccino said. ``She was angry 
because there were 100 pounds of dog food in the trunk.'' Last summer, 
there was a dog she was worried about. She called the dog Peekaboo 
because it peeked around gravestones at her. Peekaboo kept having 
litters; one time, she delivered 10 pups. Mrs. Stradtner was determined 
that Peekaboo be spayed, but Peekaboo was elusive. She would come 
when Mrs. Stradtner called her name, but no closer than 10 feet. Peekaboo 
was quite wild, covered with fleas and ticks, and she trusted nobody. 
One day about six weeks ago, Mrs. Stradtner's speech became slurred. 
Puccino spoke to her on the telephone and asked her if she had been 
drinking. He knew she had not been drinking. She never drank and had 
not smoked for 20 years. She stayed with the Puccinos briefly, and 
Puccino had her examined at Southside Hospital in Bay Shore. Doctors 
said she had cancer. It had started in her lungs and spread to her 
brain. Then, she moved to Lenox Hill Hospital in Manhattan; she knew 
somebody who worked there. She called Puccino on Dec. 20, two days 
before she died. Puccino said she wanted to make sure that Peekaboo 
had been spayed (she was) and that her own two dogs, Lance and Ivy, 
would be taken care of after she died (he promised her they would 
be). People who knew her were not sure Tuesday about her next of kin. 
She had been married to a man named Stradtner for three years, maybe 
40 years ago. They had no children. Her sister, Gladys Semino, had 
predeceased her. Somebody found a poem she was believed to have recently 
written, and at her funeral last Saturday, it was read. It was entitled 
``Weep Not'' and began this way: Do not weep for me when I am gone 
For I have friends in the great beyond. All the little ones I used 
to feed Will come to me in my time of need. They will purr and bark 
in great delight, And I will hold and hug them tight. Oh what a great 
day that will be When my furry friends all welcome me.
