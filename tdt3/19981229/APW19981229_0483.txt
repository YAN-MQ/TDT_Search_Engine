A moderate pro-Basque independence candidate was Tuesday expected 
to be elected premier of the new regional government with the help 
of deputies linked to the armed separatist group ETA. Two months after 
the Basque elections, the 71-seat regional parliament convened in 
this northern city to elect its new lehendakari _ a Basque word for 
president. The victory of Juan Jose Ibarretxe from the Basque Nationalist 
Party, the largest single party with 21 seats, was being treated by 
Spanish media as a forgone conclusion, although the electoral debate 
was scheduled into the night. Ibarretxe's election would follow a 
pact signed Saturday between his party and the minority Euskal Alkartasuna 
aimed at establishing the first entirely pro-independence coalition 
government since the region gained autonomous status in 1979, following 
the death of dictator Gen. Francisco Franco. But Ibarretxe's election, 
and the pact's survival, also requires the support of the radical 
pro-independence grouping Euskal Herritarrok that is dominated by 
Herri Batasuna _ long recognized as ETA's political wing. With the 
debate well underway, Euskal Herritarrok's 14 deputies had not openly 
declared their voting intentions. Ibarretxe centered his address on 
the fledgling Basque peace process founded in ETA's observance of 
an unlimited cease-fire since September, and the conservative government 
of Prime Minister Jose Maria Aznar's gradual softening of its anti-negotiation 
stance. ``We are all Basques, we all have responsibility and we must 
also all participate in the construction of peace,'' Ibarretxe told 
the Basque parliament. ``Dialogue without exclusion and without conditions 
and with respect for the decisions taken by Basques is the key, and 
nothing else,'' Ibarretxe said referring to a peace plan signed by 
Basque nationalists just before ETA called its truce. Known as the 
Estella Pact, the plan foresees cross-party negotiations on the status 
of the Basque region running parallel with disarmament talks between 
the government and ETA. But the Estella Pact was slammed by Carlos 
Iturgaiz, the only other candidate for lehendakari, as an ``imposition'' 
of pro-independence parties. Iturgaiz heads the Basque branch of Aznar's 
Popular Party that rejects any change in the status of the Basque 
region. The candidate also said that the treat of violence remained 
and needed to be ``combated'', despite ETA's truce. Popular Party 
politicians were ETA's favored targets in the months prior to the 
cease-fire, and Iturgaiz has been consistently suspicious of the slow 
move towards possible peace negotiations since the group's cease-fire. 
ETA has killed nearly 800 people since beginning its violent campaign 
for an independent Basque homeland straddling parts of northern Spain 
and southern France in 1968.
