Synchronized swimming is an Olympic event, so why not synchronized 
diving? Swimming's world governing body (FINA) says synchronized diving 
is likely to be included on the program of the 2000 Sydney Olympics. 
FINA said that, upon its recommendation, Sydney organizers had petitioned 
the International Olympic Committee to accept the addition of the 
event. The IOC executive board will announce its decision in March, 
FINA said in its latest newsletter. Synchronized diving, recognized 
since 1995, is now included in most major international competitions, 
including the world championships. The event involves divers plunging 
into the water side by side from either the 10-meter platform or from 
parallel 3-meter springboards. The divers are judged on individual 
technical skills and the ability to coordinate their movements and 
enter the water together.
