Under pressure from the food industry, the Environmental Protection 
Agency has modified a new brochure about pesticides, putting less 
emphasis on their health risks and barely mentioning organic foods 
as an alternative to foods grown using toxic chemicals. The brochure, 
to be distributed in grocery stores under a food safety law that Congress 
passed unanimously in 1996, was first drafted about a year ago. Only 
a few pages long, it nonetheless was hotly debated. Food industry 
groups called it unduly alarmist; environmental and consumer advocacy 
groups complained that it did not refer to pesticides as poisons. 
In August, seven food, farm and pesticide industry groups called on 
the Clinton administration to eliminate any references to organic 
foods and to make other changes. The final version of the pamphlet 
does not completely ignore organic foods. It advises that ``your grocer 
may be able to provide you with information about the availability 
of food grown using fewer or no pesticides.'' But that wording is 
a concession to industry groups, which had complained about an earlier 
version. That version offered tips for washing, peeling and cooking 
food to reduce pesticides, then added, ``If you are still concerned, 
consider buying food that says `certified organic' _ food certified 
by a public or private certification agency that has been grown in 
an area where fewer or no man-made chemical pesticides were used.'' 
A final draft of the pamphlet was provided to The New York Times by 
Consumers Union, an advocacy group that publishes the magazine Consumer 
Reports. The consumer group has long criticized the environmental 
agency for not writing a tougher pamphlet to begin with. ``Fundamentally, 
EPA took what could have been a really good brochure and turned it 
into a propaganda piece for the food industry, which has always denied 
that there is a problem with pesticides on food,'' said Jeannine Kenney, 
a policy analyst in the group's Washington office who said she obtained 
the pamphlet from a government official. Agency officials confirmed 
that the revised brochure was being printed and said it should be 
in stores by January, five months after the deadline set by the law. 
``We had very exhaustive consultations,'' said Loretta Ucelli, a spokeswoman 
for the agency, ``and I think there are and have been concerns about 
giving consumers the information they need, but not causing alarm 
or indicating that food that is not organic is not safe. ``We believe 
that we have arrived at aggressive but consumer-friendly language 
that will give people the information that they need to make their 
own choices.'' Gene Grabowski, a spokesman for the Grocery Manufacturers 
of America, said the group continued to oppose the reworded pamphlet. 
``Even with the change in the language, it still promotes organic 
foods in a brochure that was supposed to be about pesticides,'' Grabowski 
said. The latest draft differs from earlier ones in several ways, 
most of which seem to make less of the health risks of pesticide residues 
on food. The earlier brochure, for example, was entitled ``Pesticides 
on Food,'' but the new version is called ``Pesticides and Food.'' 
The new version says that ``while pesticides have important uses, 
studies show that some pesticides cause health problems at certain 
levels of exposure.'' But it omits the details listed in the earlier 
version, which said, ``Some pesticides have been shown to cause health 
problems such as birth defects, nerve damage, cancer and other toxic 
effects in laboratory animals.'' And a section about washing, peeling 
and cooking food, which used to be called ``Tips to Reduce Pesticides 
on Foods,'' is now entitled ``Healthy, Sensible Food Practices.'' 
It emphasizes in bold type the importance of eating at least five 
servings of fruits and vegetables daily. The environmental agency 
plans to make more information available on World Wide Web pages devoted 
to pesticides and food, but the pages have not yet been posted on 
the Internet. Over the objections of the industry, the Web address 
will be listed in the brochure.
