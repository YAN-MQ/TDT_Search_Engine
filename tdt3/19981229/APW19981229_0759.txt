The Dutch government wants to study the use of instant replays to 
rule on controversial soccer calls and prevent crowd trouble during 
the Euro 2000 championships, an official studying anti-hooliganism 
measures claimed Tuesday. The Netherlands and Belgium are jointly 
hosting the 16-team European championships from June 10 to July 2, 
2000, the first time such a major soccer tournament has been held 
in two countries. Civil servants in both nations are already considering 
ways of preventing crowd trouble from marring the tournament. ``If 
technology can limit the number of questionable decisions by referees, 
that will lead to less emotion among supporters and hooliganism will 
decline,'' said Henk Mannen, the head of a Euro 2000 team at the Dutch 
Ministry of Health, Welfare and Sport. ``It would therefore be useful 
to get all those involved around a table to discuss technological 
support for referees,'' he wrote in the ministry's in-house magazine, 
which was released Tuesday. Many of the worst hooligan incidents at 
this year's World Cup, however, occurred before kickoff and experts 
have long doubted the influence of the match results on soccer violence. 
There was virtually no crowd trouble inside grounds during World Cup 
matches in France despite a slew of controversial calls. Belgium's 
worst hooligan incident happened at Brussels' Heysel in 1985, when 
39 fans were crushed to death, trying to escape fighting before the 
European Champions' Cup final between Juventus Turin and FC Liverpool. 
In March 1997, an Ajax Amsterdam fan was beaten to death by supporters 
of Feyenoord Rotterdam during a battle organized by the rival fans 
well away from any heavily policed stadium. Euro 2000 organizers are 
expecting 1.2 million fans to buy tickets for the championships' 31 
matches. Nobody at European soccer's governing body, UEFA, was immediately 
available for comment, but during the World Cup finals, UEFA President 
Lennart Johansson said all available resources should be used to get 
calls right. ``We have to see about using modern technology in the 
matches,'' he said. ``We can't go too far. We don't want the referee 
running to the TV screen all the time. The match would take nine hours.'' 
Sepp Blatter, the president of world soccer's ruling body FIFA, adamantly 
opposes the use of instant replays.
