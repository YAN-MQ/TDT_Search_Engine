Finally tonight -- a "last word" about innovation in, of all places, 
the paris subway. The Paris underground is usually spotless, which 
is a revelation to American tourists in France. Imagine fine art adorning 
the walls instead of graffiti. So what's the problem? In a phrase, 
it stinks down here. Somewhat like the sewer. The Paris transit people 
say the odor comes from the engines and the brakes on the trains, 
but regular riders know better. Some people do their -- I don't know 
the name. The same thing in Paris, about the dogs in the streets. 
Whatever the cause, the city decided to do something about it. That's 
perfume covering the floor -- yes, perfume. It will take 18 tons of 
it at a cost of 2 million francs, or about $350,000. That's a lot 
of dollars for a scent. Yes, I smell an odor. There is a hint of floral 
bouquet, as well as a touch of citrus, some lavender, wood, topped 
off with a dollop of vanilla. It's called "Madeleine." The city hired 
one of the world's leading perfumemakers to come up with this concoction. 
When added to the regular cleaning fluid, it appears to do the job. 
You'll have to take our word for it. Do you smell something here?
