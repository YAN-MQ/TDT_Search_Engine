Matt Yallof, "CNN Headline Sports." Remember the Alamo bowl? We'll 
see if it's one for the ages. We do know that Kansas state will remember 
the big 12 title game. It cost them a shot at a national title. At 
11-1, the Wildcats missed out on a major bowl and will face Purdue 
tonight in the Alamo in San Antonio. Also tonight, Virginia tech faces 
Alabama in Nashville. That's at the music city bowl. While Miami faces 
North Carolina state in the Micron PC bowl at pro player stadium.
