People thought nothing could top Joel Grey's portrayal of the seedy, 
seductive master of ceremonies in ``Cabaret.'' Then they saw Alan 
Cumming in the role (in this year's Roundabout Theater revival). So 
until now, a lot of people thought nothing could top Cumming. On Wednesday 
night there is opportunity for direct comparison, and synergy, when 
the two men sing and gyrate together to the show's opening song, ``Wilkommen,'' 
on CBS. Then Bebe Neuwirth, who played Velma Kelly in the current 
revival of ``Chicago,'' and Chita Rivera, who created the role in 
the original Broadway production, sing and dance a duet of that show's 
signature number, ``All That Jazz.'' Then they all join Liza Minnelli 
(not in her best voice) in a rendition of ``New York, New York.'' 
It's all to honor John Kander and Fred Ebb, who wrote those songs, 
on ``The Kennedy Center Honors: A Celebration of the Performing Arts.'' 
It takes skill to present a two-hour special that begins in a decadent 
Berlin nightclub and ends with a stage full of small children singing 
``On the Good Ship Lollipop,'' or at least to do it without some pretty 
jarring transitions, and the producers and director have largely pulled 
it off. The experience is nothing like seeing these performers live 
(Cumming's performance is much, much nastier and more effective in 
the stage production), and the show suffers from the limitations of 
all awards broadcasts, but the latest ``Kennedy Center Honors'' presentation, 
taped on Dec. 6 in Washington, is very good of its kind. The clips 
showing past performances by award recipients _ Kander and Ebb, Bill 
Cosby, Willie Nelson, Andre Previn and Shirley Temple Black _ are 
some of the best parts. The portion of the show devoted to Cosby manages 
a nice transition, from irreverence to touching tribute. Sinbad does 
a stand-up comedy routine about Cosby's supposed shortcomings with 
comments like: ``He used to eat up all his rations and ask you for 
your food. That's the kind of guy he was.'' Sinbad says of ``A Different 
World,'' a Cosby spinoff: ``I did it free for four years. I never 
talked about this.'' As the segment ends with a tribute from students 
in college on Cosby scholarships, the camera catches President Clinton 
singing along with the students in ``That's What Friends Are For.'' 
Tommy Lee Jones, Dwight Yoakam and Kris Kristofferson show up to honor 
Nelson, who wrote country classics like ``Crazy'' and ``Hello, Walls'' 
before becoming a distinctive singing star himself. Kristofferson 
pays tribute with ``On the Road Again,'' performed in front of Nelson's 
tour bus, brought onstage for the occasion. Mia Farrow begins the 
tribute to her ex-husband Andre Previn with an anecdote about his 
complete inability to make Jell-O. The tribute covers his career as 
a composer of Oscar-winning Hollywood movie scores, as a symphony 
conductor and, most recently, as the creator of an opera based on 
Tennessee Williams' play ``A Streetcar Named Desire.'' Renee Fleming's 
admirable performance of ``I Want Magic,'' one of Blanche Dubois' 
numbers from the opera, goes a long way toward explaining why the 
work hasn't received rave reviews. If Shirley Temple Black ever received 
any bad reviews, nobody remembers them now. Jack Lemmon begins the 
tribute, calling her ``a child who will forever define the magic of 
the movie screen.'' She later became a U.S. delegate to the United 
Nations and ambassador to Ghana, but she will always be remembered 
for her movie career, which began in the 1930s when she was 3. And 
before you know it, a marching band is onstage and fifth graders from 
the U.N. School are singing ``Let there be peace on earth.'' The show 
does indeed end with dozens of would-be Shirley Temples, male and 
female, tap-dancing, singing about a trip to the candy shop and taking 
their bows in a shower of pink and white balloons. The people behind 
this show really know how to create a sense of event. PRODUCTION NOTES:
