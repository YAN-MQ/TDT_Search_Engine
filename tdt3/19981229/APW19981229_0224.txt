Greeks and Greek Cypriots held crucial talks Tuesday in Athens geared 
toward defusing a political crisis which developed after Cyprus decided 
to deploy Russian-made missiles. Both Cypriot President Glafcos Clerides 
and Greek Premier Costas Simitis refused to comment after their meeting, 
but a joint communique was expected later in the day. Speculation 
has increased that the two sides will agree to divert the S-300 anti-aircraft 
missiles to the southern Greek island of Crete, instead of deploying 
them on Cyprus as planned for sometime in the next few weeks. Such 
a move could defuse tensions with neighboring Turkey, which has threatened 
military action to stop the missiles' deployment on war-divided Cyprus, 
claiming they pose a threat to its security. The United States and 
NATO have criticized Clerides' decision two years ago to purchase 
the missiles, fearing conflict between alliance members Turkey and 
Greece. Athens has a defense pact with Nicosia and would be obliged 
to come to its aid in the event of an attack. Cyprus has been divided 
into a Greek Cypriot-controlled south and a Turkish-occupied north 
since 1974 when Turkey invaded after a short-lived coup by supporters 
of union with Greece. The missiles issue has also caused political 
tensions in Cyprus, where the outcome of Tuesday's meeting could affect 
the survival of Clerides' government. The Socialist EDEK party, which 
holds the ministries of defense and education in Clerides' cabinet, 
has warned it will withdraw from the government if the missiles are 
not deployed as planned. Other opposition parties maintain Clerides 
should himself, following his promise to do so if the missiles fail 
to arrive. The Cypriot president said previously that he would agree 
to the cancellation of the deployment of the missiles only if Turkey 
accepted his demilitarization proposal, or if there was progress in 
the U.N.-sponsored talks for the reunification of the island. A U.N. 
Security Council resolution adopted unanimously last week called for 
a reduction of weapons and troops in Cyprus and the resumption of 
the talks. Athens has said the final say for the missiles' deployment 
rests with Nicosia, although it has stressed it will support any decision 
made by Cyprus.
