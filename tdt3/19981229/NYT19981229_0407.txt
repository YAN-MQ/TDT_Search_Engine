You have heard the litany over and over: the pro football playoffs 
are starting. It is a new season. The intensity level rises. Players 
must rise with it or be left behind. All of the above are true. And 
many football people will say that one other truism applies: No coach 
can get players to rise to the occasion better than Bill Parcells. 
In his 13 previous years as a National Football League head coach, 
notably with two Super Bowl titles with the Giants and an American 
Football Conference crown with the New England Patriots, Parcells 
has made his players understand how to win the big games, especially 
the playoffs. Now he faces the same task with his Jets, who take a 
12-4 record into their playoff game on Jan. 10, their first with Parcells 
as the coach. How does Parcells get his players to become more intense? 
Listen to Carl Banks and Steve deOssie, who played for him in the 
past, and Pepper Johnson, David Meggett and Keith Byars, key players 
for him then and now. They remember what Parcells did before and think 
they know how he will prepare the Jets for the playoffs. ``Everybody 
says you have to step it up a notch now,'' Johnson said, ``but we've 
been pushing it the last five or six weeks. You don't have to push 
any more. You know how long we've been waiting for this? He won't 
let anybody slack up now. ``We've gotten better because we practice 
hard. A lot of teams are like a country club. Our practices are physical 
during the year. I remember Bill saying years ago: `There are 28 teams 
in this league. If we practice harder than the other 27, we will win.''' 
In Johnson's rookie season of 1986, the Giants won Super Bowl XXI. 
``Phil Simms and Harry Carson and other veterans told us then that 
the intensity rises, the sense of urgency rises and it better rise 
with everyone,'' Johnson said. ``Because if those other guys on your 
team aren't fighting as hard as you are, it doesn't matter how hard 
you're trying. ``We aren't there yet. We aren't anywhere. Joe Namath 
has a Super Bowl ring with the Jets. We don't.'' Banks, an old Giants 
hero, is now in the Jets' front office. ``At playoff time your attention 
has to go up another notch,'' he said. ``It just doesn't happen quickly. 
You build all year. This time of year he lets you know it isn't OK 
if you drop a ball, that mistakes are not OK because it's a one-game 
elimination. ``He'll tell you he won't take a chance on you in the 
playoffs if he's not sure. He'll say point blank, `If you're not ready, 
I'm not going to play you.' That's not a passing comment. That's in 
your face. If you're not practicing well, you're in trouble.'' Banks 
remembered his rookie season in 1984, when the Giants played a wild-card 
playoff game in Los Angeles against the Rams. ``I was on the punt-return 
team,'' he said, ``and I drew a roughing penalty. Bill shot me a look 
and he followed me off the field with his eyes until I got to the 
bench. Then he said: `You sit there the rest of the game. Don't move.' 
I was sure I was going to lose my job. He just wanted me to know penalties 
are unacceptable this time of the year. I didn't ever want to see 
that look again, and I don't think I ever did that again. ``There 
are many fringe guys he's not sure of. He wants to play them. He wants 
them to contribute and he may pressure them all week, every day in 
practice to see how they respond to it. Dave Meggett got pressure 
like that a lot and responded. So did Solomon Miller and Stephen Baker, 
who made big catches. To a degree, so did Jeff Hostetler when Phil 
Simms couldn't play in Super Bowl XXV.'' Meggett said Parcells did 
not climb over veterans who had been through the playoff grind. ``To 
some of us,'' Meggett said, ``he doesn't do much. He lets you exercise 
your responsibilities because he feels confident in you. He hasn't 
treated the younger guys different yet, and I'm not sure if he will. 
I don't think they need a whole lot of minding. Guys on this team 
don't. They've been playing big games. But Bill Parcells is going 
to be Bill Parcells. He's a different coach at playoff time.'' DeOssie, 
now a sports broadcaster in Boston, said Parcells' preparation involved 
a building process rather than flicking a switch. ``The way they played 
Buffalo the week before last, so physically, that was a step up,'' 
deOssie said. ``He tries to make you understand the closer you get 
to the playoffs, the more you've got to step up, even if you think 
you have stepped up already. ``Every day, he puts pressure on guys 
a little more. He'll rely on Pepper Johnson, Curtis Martin, Bryan 
Cox and Dave Meggett, guys who have playoff experience. He'll get 
them to explain to the other guys what's going on.'' DeOssie recalled 
when the Giants won Super Bowl XXV in Jumbo Elliott's second pro season. 
``Jumbo had to play against Richard Dent and Pierce Holt in the playoffs 
and Bruce Smith in the Super Bowl,'' deOssie said. ``I remember Bill 
telling Jumbo: `What we do in the playoffs depends on you. If you 
play up to your capabilities, we will win the Super Bowl. It's all 
on you.' Bill was on him every day, and Jumbo responded and dominated 
those three great defensive ends. Jumbo got edgy, but you want your 
guys on edge. Football is not a game for the relaxed.'' Byars said 
that Parcells has made it easy to understand why he does what he does. 
``If you don't keep winning in the playoffs,'' Byars said, ``some 
people say, `Wait till next year.' But next year never comes. You've 
got to start meeting the opportunities now.''
