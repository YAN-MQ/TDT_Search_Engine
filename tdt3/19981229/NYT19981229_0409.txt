Students at Hunter College were making posters for the game Saturday 
on campus. ``They'll read,'' Mike Brown, the Hunter basketball coach, 
was saying recently, ``come see us play Savannah College of Art and 
Design _ and their legendary coach, Cazzie Russell!''' Brown considered 
that for a moment. ``Well, I hope kids around here will recognize 
the name,'' he said, uncertainly. He meant ``Cazzie Russell,'' who 
played for the Knicks in the late 1960s and early 1970s, and not necessarily 
the Division III Savannah College of Art and Design, which is not 
quite as widely known as he is in basketball circles. ``But if the 
kids don't know about Cazzie Russell, I do,'' Brown said. ``I was 
a high school student from Taft, and I'd go to the old Madison Square 
Garden and with my student G.O. cards sit way up at the top with my 
friends and cheer him and the Knicks. Cazzie was a great scorer _ 
instant offense. I remember the chant _ `Caz-zie! Caz-zie!' It's a 
thrill now for me to be playing against him.'' Russell has moved around 
quite a bit since his days with the Knicks. The 6-foot-5{-inch forward 
was traded to Golden State, then the Lakers and ended his National 
Basketball Association playing career with the Bulls in 1978. He has 
coached in the Continental Basketball League and was an assistant 
coach under Mike Fratello with the Atlanta Hawks. He coached the Centennial 
High School basketball team in Columbus, Ohio, before moving to Savannah, 
Ga., three years ago with his wife, Myrna, a former Alvin Ailey dancer 
in such Broadway shows as ``A Funny Thing Happened on the Way to the 
Forum'' and ``West Side Story.'' The Russells reared three children 
_ all boys, all grown and living in Los Angeles _ and Cazzie also 
found time to become a Baptist minister, being ordained in 1989. He 
is now 54, his hair shows signs of gray and he is not quite as spry 
as once-upon-a-time after hip-replacement surgery a few years ago. 
``I love coaching here,'' Russell said recently, by telephone from 
Savannah. ``Nobody expects anything from us _ a team of graphic designers, 
cartoonists, architects. We come into another team's gym and they're 
going, `Yummy, yummy.' But we often fool 'em. ``And I'm looking forward 
to coming back to play in New York. Love it there _ it's the No. 1 
city for the greatest sport.'' After Russell took over the Bees, who 
regularly had losing seasons, his charges went 16-9 the first season, 
18-6 the next and this season they are 10-5. ``He's a great man and 
a great coach,'' said Richard Rowan, president of the college and 
a former basketball player at Furman. ``The amazing thing about him 
as a coach is that, when he was a player he was not known for his 
defense. But here, we win because of the defense. He's a very good 
teacher, and he's concerned about the whole student, not just the 
basketball player.'' The team's co-captain and high scorer, Trokon 
Nagbe, a senior art major, had an offer last year to be an intern 
at Marvel Comics in New York City. ``It would mean that he would miss 
a good part of the basketball season,'' Rowan said. ``Another coach 
might have been unhappy. But Cazzie said, `That's great. Go.''' ``There 
was never a question about it,'' Russell said, ``that's what they're 
here for. To prepare for their future.'' Nagbe returned this season 
to contribute to the coach's future, leading plays in which they call 
out, ``Picasso,'' in a halfcourt offense, or ``Van Gogh,'' for their 
press. Little else is fancy about the Savannah team's trappings. Because 
of the demands of schoolwork _ Division III schools do not offer athletic 
scholarships _ Russell says he may see his players ``maybe three times 
a week.'' There is no adequate gym on campus, though plans call for 
one in a year or two, so the team practices at either the nearby YMCA 
or the Salvation Army. Home games are played in the Civic Center. 
It's a long way from the NBA. ``What's this I heard about you being 
drafted No. 1?'' one of his players said to him one day. ``Oh, I played 
a little,'' Russell told him. In fact, their coach was the first player 
chosen in the NBA draft in 1966 as a first-team all-American at Michigan. 
``Red Holzman scouted me and signed me,'' Russell said. ``And I played 
on the Knicks' first championship team. No one will ever be able to 
take any of that away from me.'' He recalls that he had, as he describes 
it, ``certain limitations'' as a player. Mostly it was his defense. 
And he eventually lost his starting position to Bill Bradley. ``And 
when I was traded, I was hurt, but I understood it wasn't personal, 
and that professional basketball is a business,'' he said. A few days 
after the trade, Russell sent a plant to Selma Holzman, the wife of 
the then Knick coach, who was hospitalized after an automobile accident. 
``Selma thought that was wonderful _ it was so unexpected,'' the late 
Red Holzman had said. ``She loved Cazzie.'' Russell has seen some 
of the people he played with and against, from Pat Riley to Phil Jackson 
to Lenny Wilkens, become high-profile N.B.A. coaches. ``I don't feel 
any remorse,'' he said. ``Maybe I've been overlooked. I don't know 
why. But I'm not going to lose any sleep over it. I do know that when 
I was an assistant with Atlanta, I worked well with the players, like 
Kevin Willis, helping to develop his jump hook, and Austin Carr and 
Spud Webb.'' Fratello, now coach of the Cleveland Cavaliers, said: 
``Cazzie was with me about 10 years ago. I run into him on occasion 
and he's just as upbeat, just as positive as he's always been. I thought 
he was terrific with the players. And I liked a guy who had been on 
a championship team _ who knew what it took _ to work with my players. 
Why someone doesn't get a certain job and someone else does is many 
times a mystery. There's a lot of twists and turns in the coaching 
business. And if you want to stay in it, you have to decide how choosy 
you want to be.'' Brown, the Hunter coach, said, ``I don't know Cazzie, 
but it's obvious from where he is that his heart is really and truly 
in basketball.'' In Savannah, Russell and his group of artists are 
devising strategies and plays to deploy against Hunter. Who knows 
_ a Rembrandt may come out of it.
