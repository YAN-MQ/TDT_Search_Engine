Meantime, the Iraqi defiance remains at the forefront in discussions 
at United Nations headquarters in New York. VOA's Max Ruston reports. 
Member countries are deadlocked in trying to determine how to deal 
with Iraq. U.N. officials say there are two key trends contributing 
to the deadlock concerning Iraq. The first is the growing frustration 
among some members of the international community and Iraq's failure 
to abide by its international commitments. The second is Iraq's growing 
confidence in defying the international community. They say those 
factors, combined with a lack of compromise by all sides, can only 
lead to further tension and possibly conflict. The U.N. officials 
say the character of relations with Iraq has changed since the mid-December 
U.S. and British military strikes against that country. They say Iraq 
appears to feel it achieved several victories as a result of those 
strikes, including the survival of President Saddam Hussein's government, 
the ousting of U.N. weapons inspectors, the growing divisions within 
the U.N. Security Council, and the increased pressure for the removal 
or weakening of sanctions imposed after the Gulf War. Diplomats say 
there is little agreement in the Security Council over how to deal 
with these issues. They say weeks or months will be needed to develop 
a consensus among the five permanent members of the council: Russia, 
China, France, Britain, and the United States, on what action if any 
to take next. There have also been no public initiatives in recent 
days from U.N. Security General Kofi Annan aimed at resolving the 
situation. Officials say that with the main parties in the conflict 
so unwilling to compromise, there is little the U.N. chief can do. 
Diplomats say they now expect to see Iraq attempt to build international 
support for the removal of sanctions. They say Baghdad may hope to 
follow the precedent recently set by Libya in its battle against sanctions. 
Libya was able to gain some concessions in the terms for lifting sanctions 
against it after convincing some of its neighbors to defy the sanctions. 
U.N. officials say they expect the United States and Britain to continue 
their efforts to get U.N. weapons inspectors back into Iraq and to 
preserve the effectiveness of international sanctions. Max Rustin,
