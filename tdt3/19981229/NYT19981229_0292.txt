The sight of sons and daughters standing beneath the porch light in 
police custody is not a settling one for parents in most places, but 
here it can be. Hamilton is the first community in Britain to impose 
a curfew on its young people, with special child safety police officers 
questioning anyone they know to be under the age of 16 on the streets 
after 8 p.m. and taking them home if they cannot supply a sound reason 
why they are out. If there is no one at home _ and in the gritty, 
hard-living housing project neighborhoods here, that is often the 
case _ the children are taken to a community room set aside for the 
purpose in the station house until a family member comes for them. 
While the measure has not unexpectedly drawn little praise from the 
youngsters themselves, it has met with almost unanimous approval from 
parents. Studies by Stirling University show that it has cut theft 
and vandalism, crimes associated with youth, by 49 percent and overall 
crime by 23 percent. ``It has been a great success,'' said Anne Gibson, 
33, a resident. ``The streets now are awfully quiet, and you're not 
trying to fight your way past cheeky kids if you go out at 9 o'clock.'' 
Although the Glasgow area has a reputation for having some of the 
meanest streets in Britain, the kind of crime that the Hamilton curfew 
is aimed at curbing is more of the cheeky kid variety, youths on street 
corners marking out territory, smoking and drinking sweet Buckfast 
wine made by monks in Devon that sells here for $6 a bottle. ``It's 
frightening,'' Karen Murphy, 62, said, describing how she used to 
be afraid to leave her two-story row house after dark. ``You see four 
or five kids coming at you, and they may be all right on their own, 
but together in a crowd they're more aggressive. They have no respect 
for anyone and no fear in them.'' Dun Graham, 13, said he and his 
friends didn't like the police intrusions, and his sister Melanie, 
20, said she sympathized. ``All they're doing is talking on the street, 
and they resent the police stopping them,'' she said. At the Hamilton 
Youth Project, Grace Quigley, 33, a counselor, reported: ``They think 
the police jump to conclusions when they see kids standing around. 
Often it's not abusiveness, it's just cheek.'' A colleague, Lorna 
Campbell, 31, said the problem wasn't the youngsters. ``Kids are abusive 
because that's how their parents talk to them,'' she said. Started 
a year ago in three housing projects where some 6,000 people live, 
the curfew has now been extended to the entire town of Hamilton, which 
has a population of 49,000, and been adopted as a model for programs 
elsewhere in Britain. Under a new Crime and Disorder Act passed by 
the British Parliament in London, communities in England and Wales 
will now be empowered to set up programs similar to the one here, 
which exists under Scotland's separate legal system. The Hamilton 
experiment has attracted inquiries from law enforcement agencies in 
a number of European countries and has been studied by local academics 
interested in seeing that it strikes a balance between crime control 
and regard for civil liberties. John Orr, the Chief Constable of the 
Strathclyde County Police, said he had little time for ``individuals 
on the minority fringe who carp and gripe about the so-called alienation 
of the generations and denial of children's rights.'' In a study report 
of the program, he said: ``We do not allow young people to be in danger 
in the home, so we shouldn't permit it in the street. Our hope is 
that by taking vulnerable and impressionable youngsters out of harm's 
way, there will be a double spinoff. They will be safer, and they 
won't be tempted to get caught up in mischief-making or worse.'' The 
word ``curfew'' stirs sensitivities, and anyone using it around the 
Strathclyde Police will be quickly corrected. ``We call it the Child 
Safety Initiative,'' said Louis R. Munn, chief superintendent in charge 
of the Hamilton program. The British Parliament didn't mince words. 
The part of the new law that outlines the proposal is called the Child 
Curfew Section. Hamilton is a town with housing projects created in 
the 1960s for people driven out of Glasgow by urban renewal, and some 
of these areas have become caught up in more than just teen-agers 
drinking cheap wine, scrawling graffiti on buildings and terrorizing 
passers-by. In January in the nearby project of Easterside a 13-year-old 
boy became the youngest person ever to die of a heroin overdose in 
Britain. ``This is not just about getting kids off the street, it's 
more about helping parents,'' said Joe Lowe, a local councilman who 
has been a vocal champion of the plan in the Fairhill project he represents. 
He said that many parents had told him that before the curfew they 
had no way of controlling their own children's whereabouts at night. 
In a report on the first six months of the Hamilton project, Orr said, 
``Some of the situations my officers come across beggar belief.'' 
He said a 9-year-old girl was found wandering in a cul-de-sac at night 
this year dressed only in her underwear and dressing gown. ``This 
little girl was upset and told the officers that her mother was dead,'' 
he said. ``When my officers took her home, they found her mother dead 
all right _ dead drunk.'' Orr said that another 9-year-old, a boy, 
was found out in winter weather underdressed and that when officers 
took him home, there was no one there. ``His mum was traced at the 
bingo, and his dad was at the pub.'' Almost all of the 280 children 
escorted home during the six months of what was then a weekend-only 
curfew went along peacefully, he said. Five were subject to criminal 
charges. Munn said the police had difficulties at first persuading 
officers to take up the assignment. ``We call them child safety officers, 
and at first there was a lot of reluctance because they saw it as 
a being kiddy cops, just taking kids home to parents,'' he said. ``We 
had a big selling job to do.'' Constables Pat Duffy, 35, and William 
Simpson, 33, didn't need to be sold. ``It's always been a problem 
getting kids to trust police, and now they're beginning to,'' said 
Duffy, himself the father of two children. Several blocks into their 
evening foot patrol, they ran across the familiar faces of Stacy Falconer, 
8, Thomas Allen, 10, and Debbie Montgomery, 12. The youngsters were 
standing beneath a street light rubbing their hands in the clammy 
cold, and the officers greeted them cheerfully. ``You be getting home 
now,'' Simpson said. ``And remember to stay close together,'' his 
partner added. They waved at the officers as they sprinted away.
