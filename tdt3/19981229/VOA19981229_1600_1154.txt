Former United States Senate Majority Leader George Mitchell has held 
the first meeting of a panel investigating claims that bribes helped 
Salt Lake City win the bid for the 2002 Winter Olympics. After the 
meeting in Washington today, Mitchell said the five-member panel will 
keep an open mind to the bid practices and standards. Both as to practices 
and standards which have been utilized in the past and those which 
ought to be utilized, part of our analysis and the basis upon which 
our recommendations will be made will necessarily involve looking 
at what has happened in the past. The former senator, who helped broker 
a peace accord in Northern Ireland was appointed to head the investigation 
by U.S. Olympic officials last week. Accusations of scandal and bribery 
have rocked the Olympic movement prompting the International Olympic 
Committee, the U.S. Justice Department, and Salt Lake City organizers 
to make their own inquiries.
