The U.N. says it has picked up a distress signal from a U.N. charter 
plane that went down over a battle zone in Central Angola, raising 
hopes there are survivors among the plane's 14 passengers. Pressure 
is being put on UNITA rebels to agree to cease-fire so that a search 
for the plane and possible survivors can be carried out. U.N. Angola 
envoy appealed Monday for UNITA to help in rescuing any survivors.
