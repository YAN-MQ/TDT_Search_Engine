With a look at your "CNN Headline News" weather, I'm Karen Maginnis. 
The mildest readings will be found across the southwester U.S. into 
Texas and into Florida. While bitterly cold air sweeps down from Hudson 
bay into the midwest. Temperatures will be below zero to the teens. 
Here's what we're looking at for the Tuesday forecast going into Wednesday. 
Frontal system slips across the midwest and the central Mississippi 
valley and the Great Lakes bringing with it some gusty winds but temperatures 
behind the front will be drop rather dramatically. Expect more snowfall 
into the Rockies mountain region and wet weather expected for the 
pacific northwest. Minus 15, that is expected high temperature for 
Tuesday in Fairbanks, alaska. Our extended forecast for Wednesday, 
still calling for snowfall into the midwest. On Thursday, colder temperatures 
sweep through the central plains and now invading the northeast and 
New England. And then by Friday, more snowy weather across the Canadian 
border states and temperatures moderate just a few degrees across 
the northern tier. For more weather information log on to CNN.com.
