The snowy hills of northern Kosovo, where village kids used to engage 
in marathon snowball fights, have turned into a much crueler battlefield 
at the end of the bloodiest year in recent Kosovo's history. Now it's 
the parents, not the kids, in the hills, some in the uniform of the 
ethnic Albanian guerrillas fighting for Kosovo's independence from 
Serbia. Clashes that erupted Christmas Eve around the town of Podujevo 
added at least another 15 people to the more than 1,000 dead in Kosovo 
since February, and observers fear an avalanche of violence may come 
next spring. ``Winter is the time when snowballs start rolling and 
growing so big that they get out of control,'' says William Walker, 
the American head of the international observer team hoping to cap 
the violence. ``I hope that's not the case.'' Walker says the unarmed 
verification force _ now 700-strong and set to be increased to 2,000 
in the coming weeks _ will not be pulled out despite the increased 
danger posed by the recent upward spiral of bloodshed. ``We have to 
do whatever we can to stop violence, that's what we're here for,'' 
Walker told The Associated Press. Still, the fierce battles around 
Podujevo, about 30 kilometers (20 miles) north of the provincial capital 
Pristina, show that unarmed observers may not be enough to end the 
fighting between government forces and the Kosovo Liberation Army, 
which is battling for independence from Serbia, the main Yugoslav 
republic. After a string of major defeats elsewhere, the guerrillas 
appear to have reorganized and increased their presence in the Podujevo 
area in the wake of an Oct. 12 truce negotiated by Yugoslav President 
Slobodan Milosevic and U.S. envoy Richard Holbrooke, which was supposed 
to end seven months of fighting. According to Fehim Rexhepi, an ethnic 
Albanian journalist who reports on the rebels, there are between 2,000 
and 3,000 KLA soldiers and their armed supporters in the Podujevo 
region, home to about 20,000 ethnic Albanian villagers spread across 
15 scattered settlements. ``They are more disciplined, better equipped 
and prepared for any battle than several months ago,'' Rexhepi says. 
And he said total KLA strength has grown to about 6,000 province-wide 
since the Oct. 12 agreement. Many of the snowed-in villages in the 
Podujevo area are deserted in the wake of the latest fighting, except 
for KLA men in uniform, who hide behind trees or in wrecked houses, 
fingering triggers of their sniper or semiautomatic rifles. They are 
particularly strong in Lapastica, now sheltering hundreds of refugees 
of nearby burned-out villages. In Podujevo, 2 kilometers (little more 
than a mile) northeast of Lapastica, Serbs are anxious, whether they 
are among the refugees who fled homes now in rebel-held territory 
to the west of the town or the few permanent residents still holding 
out despite the closeness of the rebels. If the KLA takes Podujevo, 
near the northern border of Kosovo, it can control traffic between 
Pristina and central Serbia. KLA trenches already are only a few hundred 
meters (yards) away from the 30-kilometer (20-mile) road linking Pristina 
with Podujevo. ``The KLA will do everything to keep these positions,'' 
Rexhepi forecasts. In Podujevo, Srboslav Bisercic, a local official, 
says that fellow Serbs now account for less than 3 percent of the 
20,000 people remaining here. Another 10,000, mostly Serbs, have left 
for safer regions. ``Soon there will be no Serbs here unless the state 
... finishes off these bandits and savages,'' he tells a visitor angrily. 
A group of grim-looking men nearby smoke nervously as they wait to 
hear news of how a Serb police evacuation effort in rebel-held territory 
is going. ``My mother and father are there,'' says one of the Serbs, 
refusing to give his name . ``They wouldn't listen to me when I told 
them to evacuate in time.'' Another man curses the West for what he 
perceived as the latest manifestation of an anti-Serb conspiracy _ 
the NATO threat to attack that forced authorities to call off the 
crackdown on the rebels in October and allowed the rebels to regroup. 
``Our hands are tied, the world is against us,'' he says.
