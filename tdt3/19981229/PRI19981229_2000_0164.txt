Two Kamir Rouge leaders have apologized for the deaths of more than 
a million Cambodians during the rule of Paul Pott in the 1970s. The 
two men defected to the government last week. One of them, Kiu Sampan, 
says Cambodians should now work together and leave past crimes behind. 
We must let our compatriots understand that you have -- not -- problem 
-- in the future. And we've had to forget the past. Kiu Sampan. The 
State Department meanwhile says the former Kamir Rouge leaders should 
be held accountable for their actions before an appropriate tribunal.
