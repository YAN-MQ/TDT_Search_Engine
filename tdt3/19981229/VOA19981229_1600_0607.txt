The Israeli-backed South Lebanon Army militia has evacuated two outposts 
in the Jazzin area of Southern Lebanon. Israeli military sources are 
quoted as saying the militia men left the positions for tactical reasons. 
They moved to the nearby village of Rome. Militia men have been subjected 
to many guerrilla attacks in that area.
