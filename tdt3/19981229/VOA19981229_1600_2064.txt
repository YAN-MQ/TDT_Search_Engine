An Israeli parliamentary committee has approved next May, the 17th 
as the date for the country's elections. The date moved up a year 
and a half after the breakdown of Prime Minister Netanyahu's right-wing 
coalition. VOA's David Gullis reports from Jerusalem. The Knesset 
law committee approved the election schedule that had been negotiated 
Monday by leaders of Israel's main parties and sent it on to the full 
parliament, which is all but certain to approve it next week. Israeli 
voters will go to the polls May 17th and again June 1st if it appears 
likely no candidate for prime minister gets a majority in the first 
round. Mr. Netanyahu was expected to again be the nominee of the far 
right Likud Party, but five challengers are already in the race, including 
two senior Likud figures who have broken away to set up new parties. 
The campaign has brought the peace process to a halt, prompting complaints 
not only from Palestinians, but also some Israeli leaders, including 
President Ezzer Veitsman who wanted earlier voting and say the parties 
can't afford six months of stalemate. David Gullis, VOA News, Jerusalem.
