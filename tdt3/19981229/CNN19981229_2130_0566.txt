In Nevada, investigators are calling it the worst slaughter of horses 
in over a decade. This, after 25 wild horses were found shot at close 
range Sunday, outside of the Reno/sparks area. Officials say they 
don't believe the killings are related to the long-standing disagreement 
between ranchers and the government. A $10,000 reward is being offered 
for the arrest of the people responsible.
