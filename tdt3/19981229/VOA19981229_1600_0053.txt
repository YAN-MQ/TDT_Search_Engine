Yemeni officials say four British hostages were killed Tuesday during 
the rescue of 16 western tourists kidnapped by Islamic militants. 
The rest of the hostages were freed, but three of them, an American, 
a Briton, and an Australian were injured. VOA Middle East correspondent 
Scott Bob reports from Cairo. The Yemeni official said the surviving 
hostages were all freed and the kidnappers were arrested after security 
forces stormed the site where they were being held in Southern Yemen. 
Sixteen tourists traveling in a convoy were seized Monday near the 
town of Maldiya, 200 kilometers south of Sanha by Islamists demanding 
the release of their leader. The leader was arrested two weeks ago 
in a government crackdown on religious extremists. The tourist group 
included 12 British citizens, two Australians, and two Americans. 
A British official said earlier they had been located and were unharmed.
