Two former hosts of the nation's largest home shopping network are 
expected to file a $100 million class action lawsuit Wednesday in 
Manhattan federal court accusing the television network of discriminating 
against its black and Hispanic hosts. Victor Velez and Gwen Owens, 
two former hosts of the QVC network, say that the network relegates 
its black and Hispanic hosts to late-night programs that have fewer 
viewers, and therefore lower sales. The lawsuit says that in its 12-year 
history, QVC has never featured a black or Hispanic salesman or woman 
as the permanent host of one of its lucrative daytime or prime-time 
programs. ``It's more than just a glass ceiling,'' Velez said. ``It's 
concrete. You can't penetrate it at all.'' Ellen Rubin, a spokeswoman 
for QVC, said Tuesday that she would not comment on the specific allegations. 
But she called the suit's central charge an ``erroneous statement,'' 
saying that black and Hispanic hosts do appear on QVC during the day 
and prime time. ``One of our hosts, who is an African-American, just 
hosted a two-hour, prime-time special on Harley Davidsons which was 
a huge, huge hit,'' Ms. Rubin said. The lawsuit offers a rare, behind-the-scenes 
glimpse of the home shopping networks. QVC, based in West Chester, 
Pa., near Philadelphia, is the nation's largest network, followed 
by the Home Shopping Network in St. Petersburg, Fla., and Minneapolis-based 
Valuevision. QVC made more than $2 billion in sales in 1997, according 
to the company's Web site. Ms. Rubin said hosts are paid a fixed salary 
no matter how much they sell. But Velez, a 34-year-old from Astoria, 
Queens, who is now pursuing an acting career, said Tuesday that hosts 
are under pressure to sell. A host's salary is not formally based 
on sales commissions, Velez said, but he contended that sales volumes 
affected raises, bonuses and contract renewals. Velez said that as 
a late-night host, he earned $80,000 a year. Some hosts working the 
prime-time periods earned more than $500,000, he said. He said that 
he and other black or Hispanic hosts were occasionally offered prime-time 
specials _ such as the one Ms. Rubin cited _ as ``bones'' to keep 
them happy. But white hosts repeatedly leapfrogged over them onto 
the busier daytime and prime-time programs during his two-year stint 
at QVC, Velez said. ``Their idea of being politically correct is to 
do a Kwanzaa show at 2:30 in the morning when no one is watching,'' 
Velez said. ``I repeatedly suggested that we do something for Hispanic 
Heritage month, but nothing happened.'' Alan Rich, Ms. Owens' lawyer, 
said his client did not wish to be interviewed. He said that Ms. Owens, 
a native of Philadelphia and a former television news anchor, worked 
as a host for QVC for just under four years. Velez's contract with 
QVC was not renewed in December 1997 and Ms. Owens' contract was not 
renewed this November.
