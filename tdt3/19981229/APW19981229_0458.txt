BEIT EL, West Bank (AP) - An Israeli military court on Tuesday charged 
a Palestinian American businessman with funneling money to the Islamic 
militant group Hamas. The court said the money went to Adel Awadallah, 
a top Hamas fugitive and mastermind of suicide bombings in Israel. 
Awadallah was killed in an Israeli commando raid in September. The 
defendant, Jamil Sarsour, denied any connection to Hamas. ``I only 
made a small contribution to the family (of Awadallah), that's all 
I did,'' Sarsour, a resident of the West Bank town of Ramallah, said 
on Israel army radio. Sarsour's hometown in the United States was 
no immediately available. The indictment said Sarsour channeled funds 
to Hamas from the United States, using an Israeli bank account. The 
money was cashed by a 70-year-old woman and was transferred to Awadallah. 
Awadallah also asked Sarsour to get him a false passport or any other 
identification that would enable him to flee the country. ``From the 
investigation it became clear that Awadallah felt the ring tighten 
around him,'' the military prosecutor, Sgt. Eli Baon, said on the 
radio. Sarsour did not get Awadallah a passport, but did provide him 
with other false papers, the radio said. The military court spokesman 
was not immediately available for comment.
