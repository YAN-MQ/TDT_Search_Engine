A minister in the state of West Virginia thinks it's wrong to have 
your photograph taken, so he's suing the state over his driver's license. 
The West Virginia chapter of the American Civil Liberties Union has 
joined Benjamin Cyrus in his legal fight in a federal court. The Reverend 
Cyrus is a minister in a group known as the Church of the Firstborn 
at New Jerusalem. His interpretation of the second commandment, which 
forbids graven images, is that it prohibits photographs. Like many 
state governments, West Virginia requires a photo on its drivers licenses. 
The Reverend Cyrus says forcing him to have his picture taken would 
violate his rights to freedom of religious expression.
