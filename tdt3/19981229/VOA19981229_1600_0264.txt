U.S. House impeachment trial managers are meeting today in a private 
session to map out strategy for the Senate trial of President Clinton. 
House Judiciary Committee Chairman Henry Hyde, the chief prosecutor 
for the Senate trial, convened the meeting with 12 other Republican 
members of his committee. The managers will discuss such issues as 
whether to call witnesses or simply present evidence already gathered 
for the House impeachment trial. Congressman George Gekas doesn't 
think it is necessary for the president to call witnesses. Here, I 
think it behooves the president to whom we should defer in this as 
much as we can. It would be in the president's interest to stipulate 
to a lot of the testimony because he does not argue with the facts 
as it would appear up to now but argues as to the legal effect of 
those facts. There are continuing calls for a censure resolution instead 
of a trial, but Senate Majority Leader Trent Lott told a newspaper 
interviewer legislators need to hear a full presentation of the evidence 
before deciding on the president's fate.
