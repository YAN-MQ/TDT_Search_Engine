The South African blood transfusion service is urgently appealing 
for more donors. It says it only has a one-day supply of blood left 
to cope with a huge number of traffic accidents. Jane Stanley reports 
from Johannesburg. South Africa's blood transfusion service says it's 
operating on a day-to-day basis and urgently needs at least 6,000 
liters of blood. Many regular donors have gone home to rural areas 
or to the coast for the holiday season. But the real problem is the 
huge number of accidents on South Africa's roads. Six hundred people 
have been killed since the holiday period began at the start of December. 
Hundreds more have been injured. Jane Stanley in Johannesburg.
