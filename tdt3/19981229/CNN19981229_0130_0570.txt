It's a common problem in the teen years, being teased for being different. 
But some Muslim kids say they're harassed more than most because of 
their religion. Gary Tuchman has more. It's another day of school 
at Al-iman in Queens, New York, the only Islamic "K"-through-12 school 
in New York City. In the morning assembly, the lesson of the day is 
the U.S. constitution. The first amendment of the Bill of rights guarantees 
several basic freedoms -- One of those freedoms is freedom to worship 
as one chooses, but for many of these Muslim young people, that right 
comes entangled with discrimination from others. They judge us because 
of the way we dress, and that's not good. They should judge us according 
to who we are from the inside, not the way we look from the outside. 
Many of these students say they're used to taunts, but say it gets 
considerably worse during times like these, when the leader of a Largely 
Islamic country clashes with the west. The Oklahoma bombing, no one 
said, "oh, that was a Christian terrorist." Why do they relate terrorism 
with a religion? The council on American/Islamic relations has come 
out with a Report that shows religious and ethnic offenses against 
Muslims have increased in recent years. There are quite a few problems. 
The main problem is the misunderstanding of Islam. What is superstition? 
The students here, many of whom say they transferred from public schools 
because of prejudice, are in agreement about that. Some of them say 
their lives would be much easier if people just knew more about what 
they believe. I mean, if they just studied the religion, it's very 
similar to christianity and Judaism. There is something else many 
of these students want their taunters to learn about, and that is 
tolerance. If you don't believe in it, don't. You know, just respect 
it. You don't have to laugh at it. At the Al-iman school, they'd like 
the whole world to hear that message. Gary Tuchman, CNN, New York.
