Nathan Minter is one of those overbearing men who believe that success 
in their chosen professions makes them, without further effort, successful 
sons, husbands and fathers. As Alan Brandt sets out to demonstrate 
in ``2{ Jews,'' his understanding and compassionate debut play, which 
bares a man's flaws but shies from tragedy, Nathan Minter is a winner 
as a humanitarian lawyer but a loser in his personal relationships. 
Oh, his 78-year-old immigrant father, Morris, may refer to him as 
the ``Jewish Clarence Darrow,'' and his Yale-educated son, Marc, may 
call him the ``Albert Schweitzer of the legal profession,'' but the 
descriptions are drenched in bitterness. Nathan, played by Richard 
M. Davidson, may boast of his victories against the odds and his commitment 
to hopeless and indigent clients, but he is blind to his self-absorption, 
his anger and the damage he inflicts on those closest to him. His 
gentile wife of 34 years can no longer accept his repeated absences, 
for professional reasons, from important family occasions like their 
son's graduation and Thanksgiving dinner. ``She likes being married 
to a winner'' is Nathan's arrogant explanation for why he is certain 
she will understand his latest failure to appear. Nathan's son (Tyagi 
Schwartz) may have followed in his father's footsteps to become a 
lawyer and a newly minted partner in a white-shoe law firm. But he 
is the object not of his father's unalloyed pride but of suggestions 
that he should have spurned upscale lawyering in favor of partnership 
with Nathan. And while the obstreperous Morris (Sam Gray), a free-thinking 
immigrant who arrived at 16 from Lithuania and settled in the Bronx, 
can see Nathan clearly from the vantage point of his years and experience, 
Nathan doesn't want to listen to him, either. Nathan will have to 
pay a price before he can begin to achieve self-understanding. Brandt, 
the author of ``2{ Jews,'' which is playing until Feb. 7 at the Raymond 
J. Greenwald Theater in Chelsea, comes to play writing at 75 after 
a career as a lyricist of songs like ``That's All,'' a publicist and, 
more recently, a dealer in primitive art. So, like Morris, he brings 
the experience of a lifetime to his intergenerational drama. Brandt 
spends too much time at the outset trying to milk humor from a brush 
with the law that brings Nathan to Morris' defense, and his warm heart 
makes him opt for a convenient ending after his exploration of family 
relationships raises other interesting subjects like residual bigotry 
in the midst of philosophical altruism. But ``2{ Jews,'' sprinkled 
with lighthearted moments, remains an easy-to-watch cautionary tale. 
Under the direction of Joe Brancato, the conflicts are clear, and 
the cast is well chosen, with Gray as the feisty Morris a particular 
delight. PRODUCTION NOTES: `2{ JEWS' By Alan Brandt; directed by Joe 
Brancato; lighting by Jeff Nellis; sets by David Harwell; sound by 
Johnna Doty; stage manager, Denise Pera. Presented by Do Gooder Productions, 
Mark Robert Gordon, founding artistic-executive director. At the Raymond

M. Davidson (Nathan), Sam Gray (Morris) and Tyagi Schwartz (Marc).
