Baghdad says it will challenge the no-fly zones imposed over its northern 
and southern air space following the gulf war. Iraq's vice president 
says his country will continue firing on any aircraft flying over 
its territory. U.S. and British warplanes patrol those sectors to 
make sure no Iraqi aircraft are using them. But the vice president 
told a news conference Iraqi planes are ignoring the restrictions. 
Iraqi planes actually fly, normally in their skies, and our resistance 
of any violations continues. And we consider the violations as a continuation 
of American and British aggression.
