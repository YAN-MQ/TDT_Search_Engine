Sweden's decision not to adopt the euro on Jan. 1, when 11 other European 
Union countries do, denies significant cost savings to carmaker AB 
Volvo, a company official said Tuesday. ``Our main competitors are 
in the euro zone, and if Sweden would have joined the single currency, 
our costs would have been several hundred millions of kronor less,'' 
said Lars Persson, in charge of Volvo's euro strategy. That's tens 
of millions of dollars. Volvo plans to adopt the euro as a group currency 
from Jan. 1, 2001. Projected benefits should start earlier. As currency 
exchange operations in the 11 other countries -- including Germany, 
France and Italy -- tend to disappear, price comparisons will be more 
transparent. ``We expect to save perhaps a couple of hundred of millions 
of kronor even though we are not participating, but the serious thing 
for us is that the advantage for our competitors is even greater,'' 
said Persson. Volvo has approximately one-third of its group sales 
in the euro zone. Only about 10 percent of sales are in Sweden. However, 
production and administrative operations here are far greater than 
that, which means Volvo will be a buyer of Swedish kronor even after 
it has adopted the euro internally. From Jan. 1, Volvo will require 
its subcontractors in the euro zone to submit prices and bills in 
euros.
