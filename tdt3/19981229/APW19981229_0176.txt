The National Assembly on Tuesday approved a new name for South Korea's 
spy agency, hoping the change will help polish an image tarnished 
by years of human rights abuses. The new name, National Intelligence 
Service, will take effect as soon as the country promulgates a law 
approving the name change in mid-January. Since he took office in 
February, President Kim Dae-jung, himself a former dissident once 
kidnapped and tortured by government agents, has been overhauling 
the agency, now officially called the Agency for National Security 
Planning. In April, the agency said it wanted to change its name to 
National Intelligence Service to have ``a new beginning as an intelligence 
agency trusted by the people.'' On Tuesday, the single-house Assembly 
approved the name change with support from both the ruling and opposition 
parties. Formerly called the Korean Central Intelligence Agency, the 
organization adopted its current name in what skeptics viewed as a 
cosmetic change to clean up its image following the 1979 assassination 
of former President Park Chung-hee by the agency's chief. The country's 
past military rulers used the agency to suppress dissidents. Among 
its targets was President Kim, who was jailed, tortured and kidnapped 
by government agents in the 1970s and 1980s. Since Kim took office, 
two-thirds of the agency's senior officials have been fired in a purge 
aimed at removing the agency from domestic politics. Hundreds of lower-ranking 
agents also were dismissed.
