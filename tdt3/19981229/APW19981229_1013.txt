The failure of a Red Brigades member serving a life sentence for a 
double slaying to return to prison after a Christmas furlough has 
fueled the latest debate over Italy's practice of leniency for some 
terrorists and other inmates. Investigators said Tuesday it was still 
possible that Marcello Ghiringhelli, for personal reasons, just couldn't 
make it back at the end of his two-day furlough from a prison near 
Turin, in northern Italy. But under Italian law, a prisoner who fails 
to go back to his cell more than 24 hours after the furlough ends 
is considered to have escaped from prison. In Italy, inmates with 
good behavior are often granted permission to work outside prison 
during the day, as Ghiringhelli was, or allowed furloughs of several 
days to stay with family. Ghiringhelli's presumed escape this week 
came in the middle of Italy's latest round of debate over how to treat 
convicts, especially those linked to the painful decades of terrorism. 
Last week, President Oscar Luigi Scalfaro granted a Christmas pardon 
to a founder of a leftist terrorist group who had served 28 years 
of a life sentence. Just as happened a year earlier when Scalfaro 
had pardoned six convicted terrorists for Christmas, politicians and 
commentators immediately began debating about the wisdom of the practice. 
A leader of the rightwing National Alliance party, Maurizio Gasparre, 
demanded that parliament review the law that allows some leniency 
for convicts. Ghiringhelli's disappearance shows the state's ``tenderness 
toward he who acted without pity toward the victims,'' said Maurizzo 
Puddu, who heads a group of victims of terrorism. Ghiringhelli was 
convicted of killing two bank security guards during a 1982 holdup 
to get cash for the Red Brigades, a far-left group which claimed kidnappings 
and killings of politicians and other officials in the 1970s and 1980s 
when Italy was gripped by terrorism by rightwing and leftwing extremists. 
A former Red Brigades member, Barbara Balzerani, who also was allowed 
to work outside prison, said politicians needed once and for all to 
decide how to close the books on the terrorist years. ``History is 
finished with responsibility that's a little one-way,'' Balzerani 
was quoted as saying by the Italian news agency ANSA. The bank guards 
were shot point-blank in the nape of the neck after being disarmed 
and made to lie on the floor. Italy's justice minister, a former Communist, 
ordered a report on the Ghiringhelli case. An anti-death penalty group 
Hands Off Cain claimed that only 1-to-2 percent of inmates on passes 
fail to return to Italian prisons.
