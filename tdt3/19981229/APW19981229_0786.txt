Somalis weary of eight years of anarchy in their capital city on Tuesday 
cheered the first public appearance of 2,100 policemen, outfitted 
and paid for by Libya. The new cops marched in their crisp khaki uniforms 
across the October 21 parade grounds that had been decorated with 
flowers, ribbons and a banner declaring ``we finally have law and 
security'' as warlords and Egyptian and Libyan diplomats looked on. 
The Somali flag _ a single white star on a skyblue background _ flapped 
in the breeze, the symbol of the state that collapsed nine years ago. 
Police commander Col. Abdi Hassan Awaleh Qeybdid said the force would 
soon patrol Mogadishu's streets to enforce a return to stability in 
the capital and to permit the reopening of the city's airport and 
seaport. Both have been closed because of factional fighting over 
access and tax revenue since the ill-fated U.N. peacekeeping mission 
to Somalia withdrew in March 1995. The police parade included 63 ``technicals'' 
_ pick-up trucks mounted with machine guns _ transformed into police 
vehicles by coats of dark blue paint. In October, north Mogadishu 
faction leader Ali Mahdi Mohamed and south Mogadishu leader Hussein 
Mohamed Aidid agreed, with Libyan help, to set up a joint administration 
in the capital. On Tuesday, Ali Mahdi called on capital residents 
to cooperate with the new police force in identifying bandits and 
looters, often rogue militiamen and minor warlords who, fearful of 
losing out on the benefits of the joint administration, have taken 
to extortion and kidnapping to obtain funds. Several faction leaders 
opposed to the Ali Mahdi-Aidid alliance have assembled hundreds of 
armed militiamen and gun-mounted trucks known as ``battle wagons'' 
in areas of the capital under their control. In south Mogadishu, four 
Islamic courts have set up a common leadership and established their 
own fighting force to combat banditry in the capital. ``Now is the 
time to forgive each other and forget about the past,'' Ali Mahdi 
said at the graduation ceremony. He added, however, that those ``opposing 
the common good of the people,'' would be apprehended. Somalia has 
been without a central government since 1991, when rival warlords 
Ali Mahdi and Aidid's late father, Gen. Mohammed Farah Aidid, joined 
forces to oust dictator Mohamed Siad Barre and then turned on each 
other for control.
