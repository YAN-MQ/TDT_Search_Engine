This is meteorologist Valerie Voss with your "CNN Headline News Weather 
forecast" for Wednesday. It remains unsettled in the northwest, which 
will aggravate problems of flooding in Washington and Oregon. We'll 
see snow and wind over the northern Rockies. And a cold front will 
move rapidly off the east coast, bringing much cooler weather and 
also snow to northern New England, the Great Lakes region and parts 
of the middle Mississippi river valley. High temperatures on Wednesday, 
single numbers and teens over the upper midwest. Just 50s and 60s 
in Florida. There will be some 70s across the desert southwest. Looking 
ahead to Thursday, snow showers in the Great Lakes, rain and wind 
in the northwest with some mountain snow. A little warmer in the southeast. 
Friday, rain and snow is moving into the middle part of the country 
with not much change in temperatures. Perhaps a little warmer in Florida, 
once again. Saturday, not much change temperaturewise. Rain showers 
continue in the northwest. It'll be wet in the eastern half of the 
country. Don't forget, four-day forecasts for more than 7,200 cities
