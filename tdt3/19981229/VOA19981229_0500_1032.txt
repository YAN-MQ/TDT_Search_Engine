You're tuned to the VOA America. We're broadcasting from Washington. 
I'm Charlene Porter, along with Les Carpenter on this hour of VOA 
News Now. Have you talked about your child's health today. My baby 
eats well, but how do I know if she's getting the proper nutrition? 
The growth of your child is a good way to tell if she's getting all 
the nutrients she needs. What's the best way to measure my baby's 
growth? By getting your baby's weight checked regularly. A health 
worker can then compare your baby's weight to the ideal weight of 
children the same age and height. So if there's a problem, it can 
be detected early? That's right. Give your baby a healthy start. Find 
out from a health worker about the best foods to feed growing children. 
Your child's health is your family's future. At 10 hours 18 universal 
time, the top story of the hour: Iraq vows to continue shooting at 
Western military planes that enter its air space to patrol no-fly 
zones. Details just 12 minutes away.
