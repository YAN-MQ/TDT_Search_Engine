Two senior Khmer Rouge leaders have apologized for their rebel faction's 
murderous reign of terror in the late 1970s. Khu Samfon and Nuon Chia 
said they were sorry at a news conference in Phnom Penh Tuesday after 
meeting with Prime Minister Hun Sen. The two guerrilla leaders defected 
to the government last weekend. This was the first apology issued 
by Khmer Rouge leaders for the genocide that occurred when the rebels 
held power from 1975 until 1979. An estimated two million people died 
as a result of the Khmer Rouge atrocities during the period.
