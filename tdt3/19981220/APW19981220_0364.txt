French President Jacques Chirac is ``delighted'' by the end of U.S. 
and British airstrikes against Iraq, according to a presidential statement 
issued Sunday. Chirac's statement also said ``problems remain'' and 
that the solution of those problems will entail a review of the relationship 
between the United Nations and Iraq. France is ``ready to make an 
important, positive contribution to the necessary way out of the crisis. 
The efforts of everybody in the world must come together,'' Chirac's 
statement said. Chirac said the lives of Iraqis who have been suffering 
for so many years must be improved quickly. The international community 
must be able to have an ``effective control on Iraqi weapons and their 
eventual development,'' Chirac said in the statement. The French President 
said he had proposals to make on how to bring about such control, 
but he did not elaborate in the statement. French Foreign Minister 
Hubert Vedrine, speaking late Saturday night, said his country was 
working on proposals for ``a new form of cooperation between the United 
Nations and Iraq to restore the role of the U.N. Security Council.'' 
The way Iraq uses earnings from foreign sales of oil must also be 
controlled, Chirac said in the statement. Some French political leaders 
denounced the U.S. and British airstrikes. Francois Hollande, the 
leader of the Socialist Party, said that the airstrikes had not ``accomplished 
any of their objectives'' and had hurt civilians. Former Foreign Minister 
Herve de Charette, a member of the conservative Union for French Democracy, 
criticized ``the unbearable hegemony of American diplomacy.'' De Charette 
appealed to France to play a greater role in international politics.
