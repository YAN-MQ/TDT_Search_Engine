A moderate earthquake and two aftershocks rocked an eastern Turkish 
city that a strong quake had leveled 15 years earlier, the Anatolia 
news agency said Sunday. There were no immediate reports of injuries 
or damage. The first earthquake, with a preliminary magnitude of 4.7, 
struck on Saturday. A quake of such intensity can cause slight to 
moderate damage. Two aftershocks, the strongest of which had a preliminary 
magnitude of 3.2, jolted the city early Sunday, the agency said. A 
magnitude-6.8 earthquake ravaged Erzurum and its environs in 1983, 
killing more than 1,300 people. Erzurum lies 900 kilometers (560 miles) 
east of the capital, Ankara. Turkey's entire eastern region sits atop 
an earthquake-prone belt known as the Anatolian fault.
