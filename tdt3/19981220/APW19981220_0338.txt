VIENNA, Austria (AP) -- With the end of U.S.-British air attacks on 
Iraq, Austria is hoping U.N. Secretary-General Kofi Annan can revive 
a dialogue with Baghdad to ensure Iraqi disarmament and maintenance 
of U.N. humanitarian programs. ``We trust that a political dialogue 
can be undertaken as soon as possible, primarily with the involvement 
of U.N. Secretary-General Kofi Annan,'' Austrian Chancellor Viktor 
Klima told the newsmagazine ``Profil.'' In a statement Sunday, Foreign 
Minister Wolfgang Schuessel expressed satisfaction with the end of 
the air campaign, which President Bill Clinton and Prime Minister 
Tony Blair announced Saturday evening. Schuessel said the priority 
now should be finding a ``longterm political solution'' to ensure 
that Iraq complies which U.N. orders to destroy all longrange missiles 
and mass destruction weapons. Iraq's alleged failure to cooperate 
with U.N. weapons inspectors was cited by Washington and London to 
justify the punishing air campaign. Schuessel said such a political 
solution must ``bring to an end the humanitarian suffering of the 
Iraqi people'' and restore cooperation between Baghdad and the United 
Nations. Iraq has long maintained it has complied with U.N. disarmament 
resolutions. Iraqi Vice President Taha Yassin Ramadan on Saturday 
night announced that the Baghdad regime no longer would work with 
U.N. weapons inspectors, declaring their ``mission is over.'' The 
U.N. Security Council has refused to lift crippling economic sanctions 
until U.N. weapons inspectors certify that Iraq has complied with 
disarmament resolutions issued at the end of the 1991 Gulf War. The 
sanctions were imposed in 1990 after President Saddam Hussein invaded 
Kuwait, touching off the Gulf conflict.
