President Saddam Hussein on Sunday said Iraqis have been victorious 
against the ``enemies of God'' during four nights of airstrikes by 
the United States and Britain. In his first public comment since the 
strikes ended Saturday, Saddam said the Iraqi people and the army 
have proved to be ``worthy of what your leadership expected from you.'' 
``God will repay well and crown your heart with clear victory, which 
will be attested by your enemies,'' he said in a brief speech on radio 
and television. Earlier Sunday, Iraqi newspapers also declared victory 
in the airstrikes that pounded Iraq with the most severe firepower 
since the 1991 Gulf War. Iraq offered little resistance other than 
anti-aircraft guns. No final casualty toll has been released, but 
previous reports indicated that at least 42 people were killed and 
96 wounded. In halting the strikes, U.S. President Bill Clinton said 
the 70-hour assault severely damaged Iraq's ability to build weapons 
of mass destruction. But the rhetoric in Iraqi newspapers Sunday was 
as strident as before the assault. ``Victorious again!'' crowed the 
banner headline in Al-Musawir Al-Arabi weekly. ``Iraq does not deserve 
but victory with God's help,'' said Al-Thawra, which is published 
by Saddam's Baath Party. In his speech, Saddam also criticized the 
Arab world for pretending to be ``asleep ... or sick'' and not supporting 
Iraq. ``A new aggression (was) started by the enemies of God and the 
nation. With it, the resistance started again,'' he said. After calling 
off the attacks, Clinton said he hoped that U.N. weapons inspectors 
will be able to go back into Iraq to resume their 7 1/2-year-old mission 
to search for and destroy Iraq's illegal weapons. The strikes were 
launched after accusations that Iraq was obstructing the work of the 
weapons inspectors of the United Nations Special Commission, or UNSCOM. 
Iraqi Vice President Taha Yassin Ramadan declared Saturday night that 
UNSCOM's ``mission is over.'' ``Swear by God, we will never negotiate,'' 
the government newspaper, Al-Jumhuriya, said in a red headline on 
the front page Sunday. In the streets of Baghdad, there was anger. 
If ``Clinton has achieved his mission, why does he say the inspectors 
must return?'' asked Ali Mahmoud Abdel Munaim, an unemployed 32-year-old 
man. If ``they have destroyed everything illegal (in the airstrikes) 
the next step ought to be lifting of sanctions,'' he said. Under U.N. 
resolutions, the U.N. economic sanctions imposed after Iraq's 1990 
invasion of Kuwait cannot be lifted until UNSCOM certifies that Iraq 
is free of all nuclear, chemical and biological weapons and long-range 
missiles. UNSCOM spokeswoman Caroline Cross said in Bahrain that 50 
inspectors were waiting in Bahrain ``for further instructions from 
New York.'' UNCSOM chief Richard Butler said it was necessary to get 
the inspectors back in Iraq. ``There is a need to bring those weapons 
to account. And there is a need not to lose the Iraq case because 
it is test case in the field of nonproliferation of weapons of mass 
destruction,'' he said in an interview with Associated Press Television 
News. In Iraq, many were coming to terms with the attack's aftermath. 
Adil Mohammed Nori, a 50-year-old spice store owner, said he is preparing 
to drive 300 kilometers (185 miles) to the southern town of Ali al-Gharbi. 
Asked why, he said: ``To attend a funeral for a mass destruction weapon 
that Clinton has destroyed: my 12-year-old niece.'' The girl, Zehra, 
was killed in one of the missile strikes, he said. He said he still 
hasn't received the details. The Pentagon says 425 Tomahawk cruise 
missiles were fired during the campaign, compared to 290 fired in 
the entire Gulf War to evict Iraq from Kuwait. Iraq says its gunners 
shot down more than 100 Tomahawks. The offensive involved 650 aircraft 
missions, including 32 sorties by 12 British Tornado fighter-bombers. 
When Clinton called off the attack, it apparently caught the British 
by surprise. Royal Air Force spokesman Group Capt. Bryan Collins said 
four Tornadoes were en route to Iraq to bomb Republican Guard positions 
when the stand-down order reached British forces based in Kuwait. 
Collins said the fighters were recalled. In the final stages of the 
attack, one missile struck near the Labor and Social Affairs Ministry, 
gouging a 40-foot (12-meter) hole into the earth. The last attack 
came hours after Baghdad's residents broke their fast on the first 
day of Ramadan, the Muslim holiday that marks the prophet Mohammed's 
receipt of the Koran from God 1,400 years ago. Muslims fast during 
daylight throughout the month. A statement by Iraq's General Command 
of the Armed Forces said the missiles targeted presidential sites, 
civil establishments, government offices, colleges, students' dormitories, 
factories, refineries and some military units. It did not elaborate. 
Meanwhile, the U.N. special envoy in Baghdad, Prakash Shah, said more 
than 100 international workers of the U.N. humanitarian program will 
return to Baghdad on Wednesday, possibly Tuesday. The workers were 
evacuated to Jordan on Friday. The humanitarian program monitors the 
food distribution under an oil-for-food program.
