"Operation desert fox" marked a new era in aerial warfare -- the use 
of precision weapons. Richard Blystone looks at the people aboard 
the "USS enterprise" who helped carry out the campaign. They call 
themselves the "mag rats." It's 2:00 in the morning but that doesn't 
mean much if you spend your days and nights deep inside the U.S. carrier 
enterprise, making bombs that pilots will carry deep into Iraq. How 
much sleep have you had in two days? Here and there. Hour here, hour 
there. Three hours. Sleep? What's that? a brute 1,000-pound capsule 
of high explosive, costing maybe $5,000. The guidance system costs 
tens of thousands, and it is the precision work of these tired men 
that turns the two into the precision weapon on which U.S. commanders' 
hopes are fixed. The appendage can spot where a laser beam, aimed 
from the air, illuminates a target and steer the bomb to the end of 
that bombardier's rainbow. Hit a target. Theel will move the controller. 
With this, you could put a garbage can through a window thousands 
of feet below. It will go where you put it. Signing off, one way of 
personalizing this job. I autographed a couple. Myrrh cry Christmas 
Saddam. Have a nice day. They are under no illusion that the recipients 
will read T Everything, all the metal. Who, if anyone, it hits, they 
will never know. Richard Blystone, in the gulf.
