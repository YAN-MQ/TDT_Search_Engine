Resignation, indignation, and scandal have played a big part in this 
political year. Our coverage continues with NBC's Rick Davis. It was 
a bad year for politicians, starting at the top, and earned the president 
the dubious distinction of sharing "time" magazine's man of the year 
cover with his tormentor, independent counsel Kenneth starr. Two men, 
according to time's editor, entwined in a sullied embrace and paired 
for history. But scandal traveled down the political ladder and across 
the nation. Speaker-elect Bob Livingston of Louisiana resigned after 
admitting a series of extramarital relationships. A relationship Judiciary 
chairman Henry Hyde had decades ago was disclosed. Congressman Dan 
Burton had to admit he fathered a child out of wedlock. Congresswoman 
Helen Chenoweth had to admit having an affair with a married man. 
Congressman Jay Kim pleaded guilty to illegal use of campaign funds. 
Stories watched and read and heard in a constant barrage from 24-hour 
TV news, talk, radio and the Internet. And in Minnesota's mall of 
America, Americans don't like it. I have no respect for politics or 
politicians anymore. Grow up and run the country. Grow up. I thought 
we had better material than that in government. And it is having an 
affect. I think I've been leaning towards one party all these years 
and I think I will lean toward a split ticket now. It makes me want 
to run away to marakesh. And potential candidates may decide the political 
game is too rough. It's going to give some politicians who may be 
clean as a whistle pause about whether or not they even want to go 
through this. Is service to the public or policy leadership worth 
the personal toll it's going to take on myself, my family or my friends? 
Even though many Americans say they've heard enough about politicians 
and scandals, they fear there's more to come. Rick Davis, NBC news.
