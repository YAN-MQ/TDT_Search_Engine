During the debate yesterday, house speaker designate Bob Livingston 
stunned his colleagues when he announced he would not accept the speakership, 
and would resign. The Louisiana republican confessed last week to 
marital infidelities. Livingston says he wants to serve as an example 
to the president. I was prepared to lead our narrow majority as speaker, 
and I believe I had it in me to do a fine job. But I cannot do that 
job, or be the kind of leader that I would like to be, under current 
circumstances. So I must set the example that I hope President Clinton 
will follow. I will not stand for speaker of the house on January 
6th. But rather, I shall remain as a back bencher in this Congress 
that I so dearly love for approximately six months into the 106th 
Congress, whereupon, I shall vacate my seat and ask my governor to 
call a special election to take my place. Republicans chose Livingston 
last month to replace outgoing speaker Newt gingrich. I think everybody 
is awestruck, because if there was ever the perfect definition of 
what leadership is all about, it is the way Livingston has handled 
this whole thing. I think president is very disappointed with the 
news he's heard from the capitol today. He likes and respects representative 
Livingston. He has enjoyed working with him. He thought he was an 
abled chairman of the appropriations committee over the last four 
years and he looked forward to working with him on a Bipartisan basis 
over the next two years to push an agenda for America forward.
