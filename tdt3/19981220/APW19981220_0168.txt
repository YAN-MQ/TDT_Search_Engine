An Israeli injured in an explosion at a gate of Jerusalem's walled 
Old City was detained Sunday by police who suspected him of attempting 
to harm Arabs. The man was brought to a Jerusalem hospital early Sunday 
morning with wounds to his hand and was held for questioning, police 
spokeswoman Linda Menuhin said. Israel's army radio speculated that 
the suspect was trying to plant the bomb in the Old City's Muslim 
quarter when it exploded at the New Gate. The radio said that police 
believe the man may be responsible for seven stabbing attacks on Palestinians 
in Jerusalem since January 1998. Two Palestinians were killed and 
five injured in the attacks. Police believe an Israeli Jewish nationalist 
seeking revenge for attacks by Palestinians on Israelis carried out 
the attacks. Most of the attacks occurred in Mea Shearim, an ultra-Orthodox 
Jewish neighborhood just outside Jerusalem's Old City. The New Gate, 
facing northwest, is the closest Old City gate to Mea Shearim. Menuhin 
wouldn't comment on the investigation but did say that the suspect 
was being questioned by the same unit investigating the stabbings. 
``It's up to you to draw your own conclusions, since it's the same 
unit,'' she said.
