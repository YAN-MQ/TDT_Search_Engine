A day after the House impeached President Clinton, senators from both 
parties pledged on Sunday to restore civility to the proceedings even 
as they quickly divided largely along party lines over whether the 
president must face a Senate trial or could be subject to censure. 
Senators on Sunday promised a different tone than in the House. ``Take 
politics out of it completely,'' said Sen. Arlen Specter, R-Pa., in 
a televised appearance on the CBS news program ``Face the Nation.'' 
But some prominent Republicans and Democrats were already staking 
out the same kinds of party-line positions familiar from the House 
proceedings. Sen. Mitch McConnell, R-Ky., who will be the chairman 
of the Rules Committee, which will preside over the impeachment trial, 
insisted that the Senate is obliged to proceed to a trial. On the 
Democratic side, Sen. Christopher Dodd called for a quick agreement 
on censure. Strategists and political power-brokers all across Washington 
struggled to assess the changed landscape. On Saturday, a bitter House 
of Representatives voted closely along partisan lines to impeach Clinton 
for perjury and obstruction of justice in his attempts to conceal 
his affair with Monica Lewinsky. Clinton remained as popular as he 
has ever been, according to the latest New York Times/CBS News poll, 
taken after the House voted on Saturday and continued on Sunday. Less 
than a third of those polled thought it would be better for the nation 
if Clinton resigned, while two-thirds of respondents thought it would 
be better if he completed his term. By contrast, only 36 percent expressed 
a favorable view of the Republican Party, while 58 percent expressed 
an unfavorable view. That put the Republican Party at a lower level 
of popularity than it reached after the government shutdown three 
years ago. Indeed, it was the worst standing recorded for the party 
in the 14 years that the New York Times and CBS News have been asking 
the question. Despite public sentiment, the road ahead is far from 
clear for Clinton, the only elected president ever to be impeached. 
The Senate has conducted an impeachment trial of a president only 
once before, making this a matter with little precedent. The trial 
of Andrew Johnson in 1868 left the Senate with 26 impeachment rules 
_ from an age before television _ which were updated after the Watergate 
scandal. Under the direction of Sen. Trent Lott, the majority leader 
from Mississippi, the Senate legal counsel has been studying those 
rules. McConnell, in an appearance on the NBC' program ``Meet the 
Press,'' said he did not think a trial had to run for very long, and 
he set the stage for blaming the president's lawyers if it becomes 
a drawn-out affair. ``I think if the president's lawyers were cooperative 
this could be a very short trial because it's not a complicated case,'' 
he said. The Kentucky Republican also said that if the Senate does 
end up having to hear from witnesses, it could do so in closed session. 
``This will not be a spectacle,'' he said. ``It will not demean the 
Senate. McConnell was joined in his insistence on a trial by Sen. 
Don Nickles of Oklahoma, the second-ranking Republican in the Senate 
leadership. ``The Constitution does not provide for censure,'' Nickles 
said in an appearance on ``Fox News Sunday.'' ``It also doesn't preclude 
it. But I just don't see circumventing the Constitution with some 
extra-constitutional authority.'' Democrats made clear that just like 
their House counterparts, they would prefer a quick censure deal. 
Dodd, who appeared with McConnell on ``Meet the Press,'' called for 
negotiations to begin immediately, without waiting for the 106th Congress 
to convene on Jan. 6. ``I think it's in everyone's interest here to 
try and find some resolution of this matter,'' he said.
