French President Jacques Chirac is ``delighted'' by the end of U.S. 
and British airstrikes against Iraq, according to a presidential statement 
Sunday. Chirac's statement also said ``problems remain'' and that 
the solution of those problems will entail a review of the relationship 
between the United Nations and Iraq. France is ``ready to make an 
important, positive contribution to the necessary way out of the crisis. 
The efforts of everybody in the world must come together,'' Chirac's 
statement said. Chirac said the lives of Iraqis who have been suffering 
for so many years must be improved quickly. The international community 
must be able to have an ``effective control on Iraqi weapons and their 
eventual development,'' Chirac said in the statement. The French President 
said he had proposals to make on how to bring about such control, 
but he did not elaborate in the statement. The way Iraq uses earnings 
from foreign sales of oil must also be controlled, Chirac said in 
the statement.
