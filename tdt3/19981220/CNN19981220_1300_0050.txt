"CNN Headline News," I'm Tony Frassrand. The future of William Jefferson 
Clinton's presidency is now in the hands of the Senate. The House 
of Representatives delivered impeachment papers to the Senate, after 
passing two of the four impeachment articles against president clinton. 
The two articles that passed deal with perjury and obstruction of 
justice. Yesterday's vote makes Mr. Clinton only the second president 
in U.S. history to be impeached. Democrats say both parties should 
work to end the matter as soon as possible. Senator Orrin Hatch says 
whatever the outcome, the effort should be bipartisan. We've got to 
come together as senators who are acting in the best interest of the 
country. There is room enough to impeach here. It may not be in the 
best interest of the country to do so. We have to arrive at that conclusion. 
I haven't arrived at it myself. I'm going to do everything I can. 
One bottom line for me is, am I going to treat this president the 
same if he was a republican? The answer to that is, yes. You don't 
want to tie up the branches of government. There are huge international 
problems. Significant domestic issues. I think there is within the 
Senate leadership -- I have great confidence in members of the Senate, 
people of good will will find a solution working with the White House. 
We should begin today to do that.
