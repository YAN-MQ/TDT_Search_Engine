Germany's powerful biathlon team capped an extraordinary week by capturing 
both World Cup pursuit races Sunday. Uschi Disl captured her third 
World Cup victory in a week and led a German sweep in the 10-kilometer 
women's pursuit. Sven Fischer overcame two shooting errors to win 
the men's 12.5K event and hold on to first place in World Cup standings. 
Germans won seven of eight events held in this Slovak resort during 
the week. Simone Greiner-Petter-Memm, who won Saturday's 7.5K sprint, 
placed second in the pursuit, and Katrin Apel was third. All three 
Germans missed three targets each. Disl clocked a time of 31 minutes, 
26.5 seconds to gain her 17th World Cup victory and grab a share of 
the overall season lead. Magdalena Forsberg of Sweden, who had to 
do four penalty laps after missing four targets, finished fourth, 
33.6 seconds behind Disl. Both women now have 154 points, but Disl 
holds the advantage because of more victories in the current season. 
Fischer posted a time of 33:11.1, beating Raphael Poiree of France 
by 43.7 seconds and Pavel Rostovtsev of Russia by 44.5. Fischer leads 
the season standings with 134 points, ahead of Poiree with 125.
