Now tonight, the jaguars, with Rookie Jonathan Quinn under center, 
have a tough assignment, playing in Minnesota. Jacksonville still 
trying to wrap up the central, while the vikes are playing for home 
field throughout the postseason. A win, and the road to the Super 
Bowl in the NFC goes through the metrodome. I've really crammed for 
this game. You know, we've scaled back a little bit. I think I understand 
our game plan fairly well. I don't know how much smarter I am than 
last week, but I think I have a Good grasp on what we're trying to 
do this week. The big thing for him is just to, you know, settle down. 
You're gonna be on the road. Just keep your composure. I mean, just 
play like you always -- like you always have played. It's a game. 
Remember it's a game. Don't put no added pressure on yourself. Have 
fun.
