Enrique Martinez, a ballet dancer and rehearsal director at American 
Ballet Theater who staged the classics for ballet troupes in North 
and South America and Europe, died on Nov. 17 at St. Luke's-Roosevelt 
Hospital Center in Manhattan. He was 72 and lived in Manhattan. The 
cause was hepatitis, his family said. Martinez was born in Havana, 
where he received his ballet training. His teachers included Alicia 
Alonso and Igor Schwezoff. He was offered a contract with Ballet Theater 
after Lucia Chase, director of the troupe, saw him performing with 
a Cuban company. He joined the New York troupe in 1947 and remained 
with it until 1980. Martinez started as a corps dancer and moved up 
to soloist before becoming a ballet master, ballet director and assistant 
director of Ballet Theater. He was known for a serenity that did not 
fail him even when tested by the most volatile of ballet stars. In 
1968, Martinez created a sunny, good-natured production of ``Coppelia'' 
for Ballet Theater and became associated with that ballet. Martinez 
choreographed and staged the classics for companies including the 
National Ballet of Cuba; the Duesseldorf Ballet; troupes associated 
with La Scala in Milan, Italy, and the opera houses of Rome and Helsinki, 
Finland; the Milwaukee Ballet; and companies in Denver, Atlanta, Detroit 
and Norfolk, Va. During the 1980s and early '90s he directed and helped 
organize ballet companies in Mexico; Caracas, Venezuela; and Rio de 
Janeiro, Brazil. His most recent productions, created in the late 
1990s, were stagings of ``Coppelia'' for the Atlanta Ballet and companies 
in Canada and France. He is survived by two brothers, Jose and Rodolfo, 
and a sister, Teresa, all of Virginia Beach, Va.
