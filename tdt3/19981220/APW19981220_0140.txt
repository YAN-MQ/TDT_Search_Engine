The buzz of rebel military activity across Kosovo during this uneasy 
Balkan winter is unmistakable. And ominous. From the frozen farm plains 
in the north across the forested hills of the war-blackened Drenica 
region to icy mountain passes along the western border with Albania, 
the Kosovo Liberation Army is increasingly visible _ expanding, reorganizing, 
rearming. For the ethnic Albanian fighters, bent on winning the province's 
independence from Serbia, a resumption of full-scale war is not a 
question of if but when. This is a new, improved KLA by all appearances 
and experts' assessments _ stronger and more disciplined than the 
ragtag force that was routed over the summer. It is preparing to battle 
Serbian forces for years if necessary in the predominantly Albanian 
province. ``We have learned from our mistakes,'' declares a young 
rebel commander named Remi, who is based at a heavily guarded compound 
in Lapastica, a village in northern Kosovo. ``We are trying to form 
a professional army.'' A two-way radio on his desk crackles with reports 
from the field, and a line of young recruits marches past the window, 
wearing jeans and camouflage backpacks. ``We know what to do when 
fighting breaks out again,'' the 27-year-old commander says. ``We 
are ready to go fight in every part of Kosovo.'' New camouflage or 
all-black uniforms are only a symbol of the changes the KLA has undertaken 
during the 10 weeks since a U.S.-brokered truce brought a tenuous 
halt to months of combat. Using the lull to its advantage, the KLA 
has reshuffled its ranks to put professionally trained officers in 
key posts, instituted a draft, acquired satellite communications and 
put military police in many villages. In the wake of Serb withdrawals 
required by the Oct. 12 truce agreement, it has moved boldly back 
into all the territory it controlled at the high point last July _ 
some 40 percent of Kosovo. Perhaps most important, foreign analysts 
and the rebels themselves say they've smuggled in significant amounts 
of anti-tank rockets, anti-aircraft guns, shoulder-fired Stinger anti-aircraft 
missiles and long-barreled sniper rifles that can pierce armored vehicles 
or take a man's head off from three-quarters of a mile away. ``We're 
getting more and more arms every day,'' says the deputy commander 
in Lapastica, Daja _ a 38-year-old soldier respected in the KLA for 
his four years heading a commando force that fought for Croatia in 
its war of independence from Yugoslavia. ``By spring we'll have five 
times what we have now.'' The KLA remains no battlefield match for 
the 11,000 Yugoslav army soldiers and 10,000 Serbian police officers 
stationed in Kosovo. Western intelligence sources conservatively estimate 
KLA strength at 1,000 trained, professional soldiers and a few thousand 
armed supporters. But Western observers agree the rebels now enjoy 
widespread support in villages and are better-armed, better-equipped 
and better-organized than in the seven months of fighting earlier 
this year. ``They're a little bit more sophisticated, and they have 
bigger weapons,'' says Frank Larsson of Sweden, a European Union observer 
in Kosovo. ``They have learned from before.'' Rebel fighters are everywhere, 
it seems, in central and western Kosovo these days. Venture down a 
dirt road and grim-faced guerrillas carrying automatic rifles emerge 
from behind bushes or houses, fingers on triggers. KLA officers wearing 
berets and carrying field radios cruise the back roads of Drenica, 
where their central command is believed to be located, in Mercedes 
or sport-utility vehicles. A small army of black-clad, special-force 
rebels lay by invisibly when Serb civilians staged a protest march 
to a command post this month, springing into view only after the event 
ended. While the rebels are still struggling to get all fighting units 
coordinated, enlisting new support is hardly a problem. A secret ceremony 
takes place every few days in a different village, where KLA commanders 
swear in new recruits who recite oaths of loyalty, sing the Albanian 
anthem and salute the Albanian flag. Most of the fighters are men, 
but women are helping, too, making uniforms and donating jewelry and 
valuables. Remi takes a handful of gold coins out of his desk drawer 
as proof. ``Except for a small group, more or less everybody backs 
the KLA,'' says Belul Beqaj, an ethnic Albanian political analyst 
and freelance journalist who reports on the rebel movement. Military 
experts aren't convinced the outmanned rebels have learned all their 
lessons from the Serbs pushing them out of stronghold after stronghold 
in July and August. Some think the rebels may be too devoted to trying 
to hold territory, rather than relying on guerrilla raids. But the 
rebels say that even as they try to transform into a regular army 
_ a people's army _ they haven't abandoned the hit-and-run tactics 
that give them their best chance. ``We are a new army, and that means 
we had no experience before this,'' says Agim Cervadiku, 38, cradling 
a Russian-made anti-tank rocket at a rebel stronghold in Drenica. 
``But now we know what we need to fight against the Serbs, and we 
have it. ``We are ready to start guerrilla actions again soon.''
