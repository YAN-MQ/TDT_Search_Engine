Hours before the announced end of U.S. and British airstrikes on Iraq, 
a leading Iraqi official said the attacks had prompted his government 
to end all dealings with U.N. arms inspectors searching for Iraq's 
prohibited weapons. U.S. President Bill Clinton, in announcing an 
end to the attacks, said he hoped U.N. arms inspectors could return 
to Baghdad with full Iraqi cooperation. But Vice President Taha Yassin 
Ramadan suggested the arms inspection program would never resume. 
``The Special Commission is now behind us. Its mission is over,'' 
Ramadan told a news conference Saturday night, referring to the U.N. 
agency in charge of the inspections. The implications of Iraq's decision 
to end U.N. inspections are grave. UNSCOM is charged with eliminating 
Iraq's weapons of mass destruction as well as overseeing long-range 
monitoring to ensure Iraq does not rebuild its lethal arsenal. Despite 
the halt to American and British airstrikes, air raid sirens sounded 
in Baghdad at about 8:15 a.m. (0515 GMT) Sunday. The sirens were not 
accompanied by any anti-aircraft fire, and it appeared they were sounded 
in error. After Clinton's announcement, some Iraqis said the president's 
decision to bomb had only produced more destruction in Iraq and failed 
to change the situation of Iraqis suffering under U.N. sanctions. 
``What has he gained? All these missiles and destruction ... all this 
suffering and it ends as if nothing has happened,'' said Muhend Fawzi, 
an engineer.
