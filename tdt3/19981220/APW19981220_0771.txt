HAVANA (AP) _Several women and children huddled Sunday around the 
plastic figurines of Mary, Joseph and the baby Jesus on sale for dlrs 
1 outside the Miraculous Medallion Roman Catholic church. ``Pretty!'' 
a 7-year-old girl proclaimed, holding up one of the three kings. The 
crudely painted nativity sets are among the rare religious manifestations 
of Christmas, declared a permanent holiday in Cuba this year for the 
first time in nearly three decades. The government granted a Christmas 
holiday last year as a one-time favor to Pope John Paul II and decided 
last month to make it permanent. Thus far, most of the holiday trappings 
in this formerly atheistic nation are secular: small plastic trees 
with twinkling lights, cardboard cutouts of a winking Santa Claus 
in store windows, government discounts on traditional holiday offerings 
such as roast pork. Church leaders now find themselves echoing a lament 
heard around the world, reminding their parishioners not to forget 
the holiday's religious origins. ``Something of the sense of the birth 
of Jesus Christ has been lost,'' the Rev. Carlos M. Piedra Lopez, 
of the Reformed Presbyterian church, said during a news conference 
of Protestant ministers last week. Even so, he and other Cuban pastors 
see the resumption of the holiday as an opportunity to restore fading 
family traditions. ``If for only one night a year, the Cuban family 
will sit down together,'' for a holiday meal, said the Rev. Pablo 
Oden Marichal Rodriguez, an Episcopal priest and president of the 
Council of Churches of Cuba. Those traditions have always been part 
of family life for Mariem Garcia, 20, who brought her 2-year-old daughter 
to Sunday Mass at the Christ Child Catholic parish in the October 
10 neighborhood. ``We have always celebrated Christmas as Christians,'' 
Garcia said. ``But this year, we feel better to share this happiness 
with everyone.'' Despite increasing tensions between Cuban churches 
and a government that declared itself atheist in 1962, Christmas remained 
an official holiday in Cuba until 1969, when the government was throwing 
much of the country's resources into an unsuccessful effort to harvest 
10 million metric tons of sugar. The government argued that holidays 
interfered with the harvest and also canceled the New Year's holiday 
that year. The New Year's holiday _ which also marked the triumph 
of the revolution led by Fidel Castro _ soon returned. But Christmas 
remained a day of work. In November, the Communist Party said mechanization 
had reduced the need for manpower in the sugar harvest and declared 
that Christmas once again would be a holiday. The party insisted that 
the abolition of the holiday in 1969 ``was not inspired by any anti-religious 
sentiment'' even though the government at the time was avowedly atheist 
and often clashed with the Catholic hierarchy. In 1976, Cuba's constitution 
guaranteed freedom of religion and in 1991, the Communist Party dropped 
its ban on religious believers. A year later, Cuba declared itself 
a secular rather than an atheist state. Restrictions on believers 
have fallen away and church-state relations have warmed, especially 
since the pope's visit here early this year. In downtown Old Havana 
on Sunday, Cubans formed long lines outside state stores to take advantage 
of government discounts on holiday foods, which are also prepared 
for the New Year's holiday. On a street leading from Old Havana's 
broad Plaza de Armas, bystanders gaped at wooden Santa Claus music 
boxes decorating the windows of a government stationary store. Inside, 
a brightly painted train was set up around a decorated 10-foot (3-meter) 
high Christmas tree. ``Oh!'' declared a 3-year-old boy named Maximo, 
who ventured inside with his parents to look at the music boxes. ``Santa!''
