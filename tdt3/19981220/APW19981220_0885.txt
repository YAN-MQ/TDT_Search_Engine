The Puerto Rican Independence Party, badly wounded in a recent vote 
on the island's relationship with the United States, is now trying 
to heal its differences with more radical differences. The party central 
committee approved a resolution Sunday to ``open the channels of communication'' 
with other groups ``within a framework of respect toward the diversity 
and integrity of each organization.'' The Independence Party believes 
independence from the United States can be achieved through political 
means. For the last two decades, it has tried to distance itself from 
more militant groups like the New Independence Movement, Common Cause 
for Independence, the Nationalist Party and the Socialist Front. Those 
groups complain that the Independence Party's longtime leader, Ruben 
Berrios Martinez, is too authoritarian. On Sunday, Berrios warned 
the divisions between the factions were deep. ``After 20 years, beginning 
dialogue is the most we can do at this moment,'' he said. ``As the 
dialogue develops, we'll see what consequences the future will hold.'' 
Berrios' party was crippled by a Dec. 13 vote on Puerto Rico's future 
in which only 2.5 percent of voters chose independence. About 46.5 
percent of voters chose U.S. statehood, while 50.2 percent voted for 
a ``none of the above'' option advocated by supporters of the current 
commonwealth arrangement. The results worry party leaders because 
the group could lose its official certification _ and public electoral 
funds _ if it gets less than 3 percent of the vote in the next general 
elections, in 2000. Under the current commonwealth, Puerto Ricans 
are U.S. citizens but cannot vote for president and have no vote in 
Congress. They pay no income tax but receive some federal benefits, 
and they can be drafted into the U.S. military.
