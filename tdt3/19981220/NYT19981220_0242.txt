Antonio Ordonez, a leading bullfighter in the 1950s and the last survivor 
of the dueling matadors chronicled by Ernest Hemingway in ``The Dangerous 
Summer,'' died on Saturday in a Seville hospital. He was 66. The cause 
was cancer, the Spanish news media reported. Ordonez, who was widely 
considered the top bullfighter of his day for his impeccable and daring 
capework, was the son of another famous matador, Cayetano Ordonez, 
whose exploits Hemingway depicted in his 1926 novel ``The Sun Also 
Rises.'' Antonio Ordonez, who also became a close friend of Orson 
Welles, married Carmen Dominguin, the sister of his chief rival, Luis 
Miguel Dominguin, in 1953. Ordonez and Dominguin traveled together 
from one Spanish ring to the next in the summer of 1959, with Hemingway 
in tow, fighting bulls before rapt audiences. Hemingway's book seemed 
to favor Ordonez over Dominguin, who died in 1996 at age 69. ``Antonio's 
first bull came out and he took him with the cape as though he were 
inventing bullfighting and it was going to be absolutely perfect from 
the start,'' Hemingway wrote about a fight in the southern city of 
Malaga in 1959. ``It was how he fought all summer.'' ``That day in 
Malaga, he surpassed himself again and he made poetry of movement 
with the hunting, seeking, pressing mass of the bull.'' Ordonez's 
style also captivated Welles, and their friendship was so close that 
after Welles' death in 1985, his ashes were scattered in 1987 at Ordonez's 
ranch in Ronda. Antonio Ordonez was born in Ronda, a southern town 
with deep bullfighting roots. His family moved to Seville when he 
was 6. He began fighting bulls in 1948. In 1951, he took the ``alternativa,'' 
the test in the bull ring to become a full-fledged matador, who would 
face the oldest, largest and fiercest bulls. By his retirement in 
1971, he had appeared in more than 1,000 bullfights, killing more 
than 2,000 bulls. He was gored in the ring at least eight times during 
the 1950s. That was his peak decade, although his fame and deft technique 
kept him as a top-billed fighter through the first half of the 1960s. 
Ordonez also fought in Peru, Colombia, Venezuela and Mexico, but perhaps 
the warmest praise came from his fellow Spaniards. ``Antonio Ordonez 
is a natural bullfighter,'' wrote Jose Maria de Cossio in his 1967 
edition of ``The Bulls, a Technical and Historical Treatment,'' considered 
the authoritative encyclopedia on bullfighting. ``Nothing violent, 
forced or superfluous in his style. He practices bullfighting with 
a perfection, a charm or severity _ his art is at once joyful and 
deep _ that touches on the miraculous.'' Ordonez's marriage to Carmen 
Dominguin expanded their bullfighting dynasty. They had two daughters, 
Carmen and Belen, each of whom married a bullfighter, and who survive 
him. Ordonez's grandson, Francisco Rivera Ordonez, is currently one 
of the leading matadors in Spain. After the death of his first wife, 
Ordonez in 1983 married Pilar Lezcano, a civil servant, who also survives 
him. In 1981, he briefly toyed with the idea of a comeback to the 
ring but did not go beyond some initial training sessions. Even before 
his retirement, Ordonez laid the groundwork to stay deeply involved 
in bullfighting. He owned a home in Seville next to that city's bull 
ring. He also bred fighting bulls on his ranch and later become the 
owner and promoter of the ring in Ronda, where his ashes were to be 
scattered on Monday.
