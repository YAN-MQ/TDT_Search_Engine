Good evening. There is a development so stunning tonight it moving 
the impeachment of the president furtherer down on the front page. 
Today in Houston the birth of October the up lets is being reported, 
that's right, eight babies. For much of the pregnancy, doctors weren't 
even aware that she was carrying eight children. Jim Cummins joins 
us now. Doctors say that 27-year-old nuh-Kim shuck-woo gave birth 
naturally to a baby girl on December 8th, and they delivered her five 
sisters and two brothers by caesarean section this morning at St. 
Luke's episcopal hospital in Houston. One of the doctors who helped 
with the operation today, Dr. Brian Kirshon, said it was remarkable. 
When you get up to these high-order multiple pregnancies, the uterus 
is so large, it's so unusual to be able to keep a pregnancy to the 
point where you deliver and the babies are able to survive. This is 
where the babies are now, Texas children's hospital in houston. The 
weight of each baby ranges from 11 ounces to 1 pound 11 ounces. All 
of them are in critical condition. The first baby was born 12 weeks 
premature. And those delivered today are ten weeks premature. Doctors 
say the mother is in good condition. The mother had to spend the last 
two weeks of her pregnancy virtually upside down. I think she is remarkable 
in that she was able to tolerate such extreme conditions to lie in 
an upside down position with that degree of discomfort and the degree 
of immobility. She and her husband ee-Kay shuck-woo are native Nigerians, 
american citizens and live in Houston. We've been told that 28 people 
were in the delivery room today. Dr. Kirshon delivered a baby. It 
was handed off and taken outside to the stabilization area. It was 
a parade of people walking out of the delivery room and into the stabilization 
area with the babies. Doctors say the mother should be released from 
the hospital by the end of this week, but her babies will be hospitalized 
for at least two months. Jim Cummins in Texas.
