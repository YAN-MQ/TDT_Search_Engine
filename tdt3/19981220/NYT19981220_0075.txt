Computer security experts are warning clients about a new software 
virus that is spread by e-mail, infects Microsoft Word files and has 
already caused several networks to crash. The virus, officially named 
the ``MS Word Macro 97 Class Virus,'' creates a pop-up box in Microsoft 
Word 97 files that addresses the recipient of the e-mail message by 
name and informs the user that he or she ``is a big stupid jerk.'' 
Large-scale infections of the virus, which are activated on the 14th 
of each month, have been reported worldwide, security experts say. 
The virus itself contains no programming that would cripple a network 
server, but experts said that a big infection of document files can 
start a chain reaction on a computer network that in turn can cause 
a general system failure. ``It is the No. 1 virus in the world right 
now,'' said Vincent Gullotto, manager of the antivirus emergency response 
team for Network Associates, a company that develops and publishes 
antivirus software. In the last few weeks, Gullotto said, he has received 
thousands of complaints about the virus. In one recent case, he said, 
the network server of a major U.S. corporation, which he declined 
to identify, was crippled after 7,000 documents were infected. The 
company's server was set up to sound alerts upon the discovery of 
viruses, and the constant alerts brought down the server. ``It basically 
went into alert overload,'' Gullotto said. On Dec. 15, Don Goff, an 
adjunct professor of information technology at the University of Maryland, 
wrote in an e-mail message: ``In the last 48 hours, a `class virus' 
has been propagating from MS Word attachments to e-mail documents. 
It manifests itself as a pop-up with the phrase `(recipient by name) 
is a big jerk.' It is going around Washington, D.C., like lightning 
_ like a cold through my preschoolers class.'' Noting that ``it has 
to be cleaned from each file,'' he described the macro virus as ``a 
pernicious cuss'' and ``a mean little spud.'' The virus infects only 
machines that are running Microsoft's Word 97 word processing program. 
Since it was first reported to Symantec, an antivirus software company, 
in late July, the virus has sprouted 43 different strains, said Eric 
Chien, a software engineer for Symantec's antivirus research center. 
Because the original virus was not protected by encryption, it has 
been easy to alter. Some variants contain references to President 
Clinton and Monica Lewinsky, and with those variants, pop-up boxes 
about the relationship appear when users open Word documents. ``If 
you don't have Word, it's not an issue,'' Chien said. If a user has 
Word 97, however, and opens the e-mail attachment, he added, ``the 
virus will infect any other Word document'' on the user's hard drive 
or network drive. Microsoft Word documents are frequent targets of 
virus writers because Word enables users to write simple programs 
known as macros that can, for example, automatically end every letter 
that a user composes with the word ``Sincerely.'' That functionality, 
intended to spread instructions through all Word documents on a machine, 
also helps viruses infect documents, experts said. One of the first 
Word macro viruses, known as the Concept Virus, is thought to be the 
most widely dispersed computer virus in the world. Microsoft officials 
point out that people who use Word can instruct the program not to 
run macros, an option that is part of Word's built-in protection against 
viruses. ``You should be careful not to open a document whose source 
you don't know,'' said Andrew Dixon, a group project manager for Microsoft. 
One problem the Word Macro 97 virus can create for networked computer 
systems is that it changes the software registration information. 
System errors can occur when the registration information on an individual 
machine does not match information on the network. The virus changes 
the company name to ``Dr. Diet Mountain Dew,'' and it changes the 
user name to ``VicodinES/CB/TNN.'' Chien said ``Vicodin'' is the pseudonym 
of the virus writer, while ``CB'' stands for ``Code Breakers,'' a 
virus-writing group, and ``TNN'' stands for the writer's own group, 
known as ``The Narcotic Network.'' Vicodin has been quite active lately, 
writing and distributing viruses through the Internet, experts said. 
He even issues press releases, which he attributes to the fictitious 
``Disassociated Press.'' ``The thing about Vicodin is, he has a sense 
of humor,'' Gullotto said. But victims are not laughing. As the virus 
mutates and spreads, antivirus companies, not surprisingly, are recommending 
that corporations be more conscientious about updating their antivirus 
software. Goff wrote in his e-mail message that the latest versions 
of antivirus software defended computers and networks from the virus 
but that earlier versions did not. Gullotto said, ``I can only preach 
so much to customers that they need to update.''
