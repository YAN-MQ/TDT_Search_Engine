As Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu made a last-ditch effort to garner 
support for his hawkish peace policies Sunday, opponents from the 
left and right prepared to face him in new elections. ``Netanyahu 
disappointed his voters at Wye,'' said head of the right-wing Land 
of Israel front Michael Kleiner, referring to the U.S.-brokered Wye 
River peace accords that obligate Israel to withdraw from parts of 
the West Bank. Kleiner told Israel TV that the Land of Israel Front 
would run its own candidate to challenge Netanyahu, but declined to 
say who it would be. The prime minister is slated to ask the Parliament 
in a vote Monday to support several conditions he has demanded of 
the Palestinians before Israel carries out another promised troop 
withdrawal from parts of the West Bank. The opposition Labor Party 
has announced that it will vote against Netanyahu's policies, and 
several right wing members of Netanyahu's coalition pledged to follow 
suit. Regardless of the vote's outcome, a motion for early elections 
submitted by the Labor Party is practically guaranteed to pass on 
the same day. Netanyahu was meeting with Cabinet ministers Sunday 
to garner their support for his peace policies. Labor Party leader 
Ehud Barak opened his campaign Thursday for the elections slated for 
April with an emphasis on social issues, which have typically taken 
a back seat to the peace process in national elections. Saturday night, 
Barak met with Israel's former armed forces chief, Lt. Gen. Amnon 
Lipkin-Shahak, considered a favored candidate for prime minister. 
Shahak declined Barak's invitation to run in the number two slot, 
suggesting that the candidate most likely to beat Netanyahu run against 
him, Israel's army radio said. Barak refused. ``I'll be happy if he 
(Shahak) joins us,'' Barak told the radio, ``(but) I am the one who 
leads us.'' Barak, whose party began the Israel-Palestinian peace 
process in 1993, pledged to implement the Wye River Memorandum. In 
a sudden show of support for Netanyahu, Jewish settler council leader 
Pinhas Wallerstein said the council would try to persuade right wing 
legislators to vote against early elections, Israel Radio said. The 
settlers helped bring Netanyahu to power in 1996 but turned against 
him after he signed the Wye Accords. Monday's announcement indicated 
the settlers' concern that new elections would bring to power a government 
that would carry out further West Bank troop withdrawals. Netanyahu 
advisor David Bar-Illan said he was unconcerned about polls that show 
Barak leading Netanyahu by five percent. ``All I can say is that Netanyahu 
started the campaign in 1996 being 25 points behind Peres,'' Bar-Illan 
said, referring to Labor candidate Shimon Peres whom Netanyahu beat 
in a tight race in 1996.
