Scientists are classifying 9 of the world's 16 Penguin species as 
endangered. The news is causing alarm because the health of Penguins 
is directly linked to the health of the world's oceans. Bill Delaney 
has more. The Penguin tank at Boston's New England aquarium. Very 
decent digs. Plenty of ice-cold water. Room service delivered all 
day long without so much as a phone call -- and rocks. The sort of 
square footage you just can't find anymore in the heart of the city. 
Not a bad life, considering that the outlook for Penguins in their 
natural habitat is about as bleak as it's ever been. It's very shocking, 
especially for someone who works with them. Once you get to know them, 
and once you have a place in your heart for them, it's really hard 
to accept that in 40 years, they may be extinct, this particular species, 
the African Penguin. In all, 9 out of a total of 17 Penguin species 
are endangered. And when these birds are in trouble, biologists say, 
it's yet another indicator of a planet in trouble. Living as they 
do out on some of the world's most isolated coasts, evidence environmental 
dangers reach just about everywhere. What most threatens Penguins 
are continuing oil spills -- damaging the feathers that enable them 
to swim and stay warm -- coastal development that destroys nesting 
areas, overfishing, and, some scientists say, global warming blamed 
for El Nino that heats up the frigid water Penguins need. Threatened 
by a number of things -- At a recent conference on the endangered 
Penguin at the New England aquarium, scientists said humans, even 
living thousands of miles from the nearest Penguin, can make a difference. 
Reduce Greenhouse gas emissions if at all possible. We can stop, you 
know, polluting the seas where possible. We can be very selective 
about the sort of fish we give to our pets, because often that's the 
sort of food that's taken away from Penguins. a bird it's hard not 
to like -- falling, increasingly, on hard times. Bill Delaney, CNN, 
Boston.
