After braving a night of fierce thunderstorms, British tycoon Richard 
Branson and his crew soared over Central Asia on Sunday heading for 
the Himalayas on day three of their historic attempt to circle the 
globe in a balloon. ``Somebody was looking over us last night,'' an 
elated Branson told the ground crew of ICO Global, a mobile telephone 
company that is supporting the trip, after making it through the storms. 
The storms forced Branson, Chicago millionaire Steve Fosset and teammate 
Per Lindstrand to navigate through a narrow corridor bringing them 
close to three countries that had denied them access to fly over their 
territory: Iraq, Iran and Russia. Fosset, who lost a balloon in the 
Pacific two months ago as a result of a thunderstorm, shouted to his 
teammates to put on their parachutes Saturday as they headed north 
over Turkey to avoid Iraq. ``By climbing the winds blew us closer 
to Iraq. What was worse _ a possible storm ahead or the `storms' of 
Iraq? We decided to risk the thunder and press on,'' Branson told 
the ground crew, according to a communique. The balloon missed Iraq 
by just 60 miles (97 kilometers), Iran by 7 miles (12 kilometers) 
and Russia by just 10 miles (16 kilometers). ``I have never seen anything 
like this in the 30 years I have been ballooning,'' said ICO Project 
Director Mike Kendrick, saying going through such a gap was ``like 
threading a needle.'' The crew hoped to have a quiet day Monday, flying 
across Turkmenistan before heading into Afghanistan and then along 
the Himalayas, another potential trouble spot. The balloon was flying 
Sunday at an altitude of 28,000 feet and about 40 miles (64 kilometers) 
per hour. By mid-afternoon, it had already traveled 3,000 miles (4,860 
kilometers) since takeoff. The first, 9th graf pvs
