Ignoring pleas from the government, protesting high school students 
vowed Sunday to step up their campaign to block roads and occupy school 
buildings around Greece. Student representatives, demanding that government 
education reforms be scrapped, voted to expand sporadic blockades 
to Greece's main highways. They also decided to continue school occupations 
into the new year, as well as stage more mass rallies and rush-hour 
roadblocks of Athens' busy streets. Some 2,000 high school buildings 
are currently under occupation by their students. Under the reforms, 
university entrance exams will be scrapped in favor of a more complicated 
continual assessment system. The protest, growing steadily over the 
last two months, has put additional strain on the Socialist government. 
Premier Costas Simitis is already struggling with strike-minded unions 
over an array of labor and economic reforms, which have seen his popularity 
drop sharply in opinion polls. A survey of lawmakers published Sunday 
by the Athens daily Eleftherotypia found that 162 deputies in the 
300-member unicameral parliament now believe the education law should 
be abolished or amended. The continuing school protests come in spite 
of an all-out information campaign by Education Minister Gerasimos 
Arsenis. He has spent weeks visiting schools and holding teleconferences 
with students and educators to explain the new school program.
