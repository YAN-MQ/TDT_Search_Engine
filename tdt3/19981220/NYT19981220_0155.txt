Coast Guard rescue teams looking for six people missing since a speedboat 
carrying 21 Cuban refugees capsized have called off the search and 
charged two men with alien smuggling. The two men were among the nine 
passengers who survived the capsizing on Thursday night and clung 
to the boat's hull for more than 10 hours before being spotted by 
a Greek freighter on Friday morning. They were arrested that night. 
The Coast Guard recovered the bodies of 8 of the 23 people aboard, 
but the search for the six missing was suspended Saturday evening. 
``We don't have hope of recovering the bodies,'' said a Coast Guard 
spokesman, Paul Henley. Both men charged, Francisco Gomez, 34, who 
owned the boat, and Pedro Guevara, 32, are natives of Cuba who live 
in Florida. Border Patrol officials said they had been investigating 
Guevara for previous smuggling incidents. The survivors included a 
4-year-old and a 9-year-old. Three survivors were Guevara's relatives, 
said Dan Geoghegan, the assistant chief of the Border Patrol in Miami. 
Although the smuggling of aliens, a federal crime, normally carries 
a maximum penalty of three years in prison for each person smuggled, 
both men could face the death penalty, which is allowed in cases in 
which lives are lost. The boat, a 30-foot Scarab, flipped over near 
the northern Florida Keys, possibly because of engine trouble and 
overcrowding, according to the Coast Guard. Border Patrol officials 
said it had departed from Tavernier, in the middle Keys, picked up 
the refugees and was headed back to Florida. The officials were not 
sure whether the boat had taken the passengers from Cuba or from the 
Bahamas, a common starting ground for Cuban refugees wishing to enter 
the United States.
