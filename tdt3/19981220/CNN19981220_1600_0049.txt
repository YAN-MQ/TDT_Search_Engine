"CNN Headline News," I'm Tony Frassrand. The future of William Jefferson 
Clinton's presidency is now in the hands of the Senate. The House 
of Representatives delivered impeachment papers to the Senate, after 
passing two of the four impeachment articles against president clinton. 
The two articles that passed deal with perjury and obstruction of 
justice. Yesterday's vote makes Mr. Clinton only the second president 
in U.S. history to be impeached. Democrats say both parties should 
work to end the matter as soon as possible. Senator Orrin Hatch says 
whatever the outcome, the effort should be bipartisan. We've got to 
come together, as senators who are acting in the best interest of 
the country. There is room enough to impeach here. It may not be in 
the best interest the country to do so. We've got to arrive at that 
conclusion. I haven't arrived at it myself yet. One bottom line for 
me is am I going to treat this president the same as I would if he 
was a republican? The answer to that is yes. I don't think you want 
it tie up the three branches of government for the next three months. 
It's the end of the 20th century. There are huge international problems. 
I think there is within the Senate leadership, I have great confidence 
in them, members of the Senate and people of goodwill can come together 
and find a solution working with the White House. We ought to begin 
to do that.
