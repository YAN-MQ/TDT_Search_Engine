Three days after their company managed one of the most successful 
initial public offerings in the short history of the Internet, brothers 
Jack and Murray Hidary, the founders of New York-based Earthweb, made 
a private donation of $10,000 to a nonprofit group known as Mouse, 
an acronym for Making Opportunities for Upgrading Schools and Education. 
Mouse was founded 14 months ago by Andrew Rasiej, a nightclub owner 
turned philanthropist, to help wire and provide technical support 
to New York City's public high schools. Essentially, the organization 
consists of a staff of three and 700 volunteers _ no hardware, no 
software, no wire. The Hidary brothers were among its first volunteers, 
and they represent a growing commitment among Silicon Alley companies 
to share time and, when possible, cash with a new generation of nonprofit 
groups founded to distribute the benefits of technology. Jack Hidary 
said his eyes were opened to a growing social problem when he volunteered 
to help wire Washington Irving High School last year. ``That's when 
I realized what a lack of infrastructure there is in the schools,'' 
he said. ``If we allow students to grow up without being connected, 
they're going to be at a real disadvantage.'' Mouse is now managing 
programs in 13 New York public high schools, and Rasiej is on a crusade 
to enlist members of the city's new-media industry. ``Many of the 
people in the community don't have the ability to write a big check,'' 
he said of an industry full of cash-short start-ups. ``But they can 
leverage something more valuable; they can leverage their expertise.'' 
When seeking companies' resources, Rasiej, who also runs the Intel 
Music Festival for profit, appeals directly to their bottom line. 
``The companies need to realize there aren't any customers if people 
can't get online,'' he said. ``They have to help create their future 
customers and their future employees. You have to light a fire, and 
then the customers will demand it.'' Another high-profile nonprofit 
group that Mouse often passes the baton to when seeking staff development 
is Heaven (Helping, Educate, Activate, Volunteer and Empower). The 
national organization, which is based in New York, was founded in 
1997 with backing from America Online and Time Warner's New Line Cinema. 
It is run by Wendy Dubit, who has forfeited her for-profit new-media 
career as a marketing and Web-content developer to make Heaven work 
for inner-city high school students. ``Heaven exists to use new media 
to benefit society and bridge the digital divide,'' Ms. Dubit said. 
``We want to coalesce the industry and users around using these tools 
for positive social change.'' Heaven operates a job-training and internship 
program, called Angels, for inner-city high school students; Ms. Dubit 
describes it as ``a way of addressing the biggest problem we face: 
narrowing the gap between the haves and the have-nots.'' One of Heaven's 
first students was 15-year-old Gabriel Almanzar, a student at Beacon 
High School on West 61st Street. After completing Heaven's initial 
training course where he learned, among other things, how to use Adobe 
Photoshop, a graphics and digital darkroom program, Gabriel took an 
internship at a small publishing company called Global Liaisons in 
Manhattan where he helped the owner, Wendy Diamond, find and format 
photographs and often worked with other, more technologically sophisticated 
shops on production. ``I really liked meeting all the people,'' Gabriel 
said. ``And I taught Wendy how to use Adobe.'' Tiffany Lee, a senior 
at Benjamin Banneker High School in Brooklyn, is finishing a Heaven 
internship at Silicon Alley-based Theglobe.com, a community-based 
Web site. She works 15 hours a week in the marketing and public relations 
department, organizing media kits, helping with the editorial calendar 
and sometimes helping organize chat groups. Tiffany said she was surprised 
by the reception she got at the company. ``In other jobs I've had, 
the people in charge of me have been really nasty,'' she said. ``But 
there, they respect me a lot.'' Like Heaven, the Digital Clubhouse, 
located at the New York Information and Technology Center at 55 Broad 
St., has an agenda to teach multimedia skills, but not just to teen-agers. 
The original Digital Clubhouse was started in Silicon Valley in 1996 
and opened its New York center in the summer of 1997. It is modeled 
as a community resource and learning center, a place where people 
can come to learn software programs, how to build Web pages or create 
a CD-ROM. ``The Clubhouse came out of a small NASA project,'' said 
Jennifer Douglas, director of the New York center. ``They wanted to 
see how 21st-century technology would be used by communities. What 
came out of talking with focus groups was that something called the 
Digital Clubhouse would make sense.'' The Clubhouse's latest project 
is the Digitally Abled Producers Project, which is financed by Mitsubishi 
Electric America Foundation. ``The program is made up of students, 
half with disabilities, who are learning Web production and digital 
storytelling by creating CD-ROMs,'' Ms. Douglas said. ``They use personal 
photographs, artwork and narration to tell their own stories.'' Back 
in cyberspace, two Web developers, David Perez and Lila Heymann, are 
preparing to start the Silverlining Network, a site for families with 
seriously ill children. ``It's a place where families can meet one 
another,'' Perez said. ``They can link to resources, chat with experts 
in the field or read feature articles, like on how serious illnesses 
affect siblings.'' Perez and Ms. Heymann hope to have the site operating 
by mid-1999. The assets that all of these fledgling nonprofit groups 
say they need are more volunteers and corporate financial support. 
But Rasiej, for one, insists that his organization's potential is 
far too great to leave its fate to the generosity of the Fortune 500 
_ and that the Silicon Alley community has a great deal to gain from 
getting involved. ``You have to get the entrepreneurs to think about 
themselves in the silhouette of a Cooper or a Rockefeller, the leaders 
of the industrial revolution,'' he said. It is a comparison that New 
York entrepreneurs like the Hidary brothers are probably happy to 
accept.
