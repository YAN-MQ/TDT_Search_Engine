The impeachment process now moves into the Senate, where the president's 
opponents have a tougher road ahead. A conviction in a Senate trial 
requires a two-thirds majority, meaning all 55 republicans plus 12 
democrats would have to vote against the president. That's assuming 
the impeachment comes to trial at all. Of course I think there's a 
way to avoid a trial. The first one was already mentioned earlier, 
and that is that 51 members could decide to adjourn the Senate and 
no trial would take place. Or a trial can begin and at some point 
at some crucial point or some strategic point, an alternative could 
be worked out, such as censure motion. When the truth comes out and 
the American people in the United States senate realize the extent 
of the perjury and obstruction of justice by President Clinton, the 
verdict, I think, will be assured.
