Tribesman holding four Germans hostage called the Germany Embassy 
on Sunday and asked for urgent medical help for a woman they were 
holding. A German Embassy official said a cardiologist was dispatched 
to examine the woman, but refused to reveal her identity or her condition. 
The official said the cardiologist was chosen because he spoke German, 
not necessarily because the woman was suffering from heart trouble. 
The official spoke on customary condition of anonymity. The Germans, 
three women and a man, were abducted Dec. 7 by gunmen from the Bani 
Dhabyan tribe and taken to Marib province, 170 kilometers (105 miles) 
northeast of the Yemeni capital, San`a. The four German hostages have 
been identified by the Yemen Times as Norbert Degen, Petra Penglista, 
Rozwita Adlung and Inge Brunner. The names have not been confirmed 
by the embassy. Meanwhile, a German diplomat on Sunday visited a journalist 
who is being questioned by authorities about a meeting with the hostages, 
the official said. Sadek Hamaiel, a Syrian national who works for 
the Berliner Zeitung daily, was taken into custody Thursday as he 
returned from a meeting with the four German hostages. Hamaiel was 
escorted to the area by tribesmen close to the kidnappers. He was 
arrested with two tribesmen and charged with traveling in tribal areas 
without government permission. Authorities have said he will be tried. 
The Bani Dhabyan are asking the government for more schools, hospitals, 
telephone lines and roads in their poor province.
