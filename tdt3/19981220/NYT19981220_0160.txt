The morning after impeachment, the capital city stirred back to life 
in its familiar Sunday ways. Deacon Gary B. Pledger, an alumnus of 
the homeless contingent living across from the White House, had the 
chili and cornbread cooking for his church's weekly homily-and-handout 
spread for his old buddies. ``It's all good food,'' he said, keeping 
his observations simple as he eased into the day and headed out to 
50 or so indigents stirring from their wraith-like sleeping lairs 
within shouting distance of the White House. ``Two years ago, I was 
living with the guys in that park, watching the high and mighty come 
and go.'' Pledger paused to speak of President Clinton. ``The mighty 
is falling, huh?'' he asked, touching on the question that haunted 
Washington on the day after impeachment. Two blocks away from the 
Temple Baptist church, which plucked Pledger from the streets two 
years ago, Tim Russert showed up for work as bureau chief at the NBC 
News television studios, easing his own way into Sunday. ``Unbelievable 
week,'' he said wide-eyed to no one in particular, as if acknowledging 
a hangover of sorts as he hooked up his microphone and earpiece. He 
checked for the latest developments, more than ready for some fresh 
shocker, then made sure Secretary of State Madeleine Albright had 
some hot tea at hand as air time approached for ``Meet the Press.'' 
In his own way, Russert is one of this city's Sunday deacons of the 
here-and-now, not the hereafter, of the political world with all its 
headlined sins, judgments and punishments as politicians fall from 
grace before the nation's eyes. He had as busy a Sunday workload as 
Pledger, what with impeachment and the Iraq bombing runs on the program 
agenda. There was no chili or cornbread cooking, but Russert offered 
catered finger sandwiches and holiday chocolate truffles later, after 
the morning's lineup of talking heads had their say. He brought James 
Carville and Mary Matalin and their two small children on the show 
for the human side of the capital, with the couple mostly feuding 
about impeachment. With his deacon's eye, Russert seized on a politician's 
phrase about granting ``absolution'' to the president and used it 
to stir observations from four guest senators. ``They're trying to 
work it through,'' the moderator estimated afterward, sounding more 
like a hopeful groundling than a stage manager in the capital's grim 
impeachment show. Outside the White House, a man in roller skates 
blithely sped back and forth on Pennsylvania Avenue, saying nothing 
and wearing a protest sign on his helmet: ``SEXUAL WITCHHUNT.'' On 
the sidewalk, a dozen pickets protested the administration's Iraq 
policy, complaining about children dying. A few blocks away, a customer 
complained in a souvenir store that the price of the Clinton nesting 
dolls had been raised overnight from $50 to $70. The customer was 
rudely told to leave. Outside, tourists puzzled over the dolls at 
the shop window. ``I recognize Monica and Paula and Gennifer,'' one 
woman said to a friend, identifying the painted wooden dolls that 
fit one within the other, capped by a Clinton doll. ``But the fourth?'' 
``Kathleen Willey?'' the friend tried. ``Or maybe Hillary.'' Next 
to the dolls sat a full mannequin version of a stupefied looking president, 
reading a book about impeachment and draped with a copy of the Starr 
report printed on a roll of bathroom tissue. The effigy drew little 
more than a routine glance from passing citizens. Across from the 
White House, the homeless lineup was beginning in LaFayette Park, 
the Sunday event unfolding reliably, impeachment or not. ``Jesus took 
the taste for drugs right out of my mouth,'' Pledger preached to his 
patient, needy flock. The chili and cornbread were kept covered until 
he finished. ``Don't worry, it'll be hot and good,'' he said as they 
glanced hungrily at the food. The White House glowed beyond them, 
Christmas-card perfect except for a string of TV news encampments. 
``I know, you're thinking of when you were little and the presents 
and the fun,'' Pledger went on. ``But it doesn't have to be depressing,'' 
he insisted of life, closing with a brief prayer, then the chili. 
Thomas Gary gratefully finished a plateful and faced the White House 
on a park bench, reading impeachment stories in someone's discarded 
Sunday paper. ``It was a circus here yesterday,'' he complained of 
rival pro- and anti-impeachment groups that disturbed his own homeless 
setting as much as the presidential hearth. ``It was so wild, no one 
paid any attention to these two kids playing carols on a clarinet 
and horn,'' he said. ``That impressed me.'' Gary said he had absolutely 
nothing to say about the president's predicament that has not been 
uttered and heard before in this city and the nation. ``I hope he 
survives,'' he said gesturing toward Clinton's home and turning back 
to the impeachment story.
