An Iraqi opposition group claimed Sunday that a cousin of Saddam Hussein 
who commands the military in the southern region has executed several 
army officers for disobeying orders. Among those executed was the 
commander of the 11th Mechanized Division in the southern city of 
Amarah, the Supreme Council for the Islamic Revolution in Iraq said 
in a statement faxed to The Associated Press in Cairo. The cousin, 
former Defense Minister Ali Hasan Al-Majid, was given the command 
of the predominantly Shiite southern region as part of a reorganization 
by Saddam, who divided the country into four military districts on 
Wednesday. The Supreme Council said the executions took place immediately 
after al-Majid took control. The Supreme Council is based in Iran, 
and there has been no independent confirmation of the report. Iraqi 
authorities do not comment on such claims. Besides al-Majid, Saddam 
gave control of the other three new commands to trusted aides. The 
move was apparently aimed at thwarting possible civilian uprising 
in case U.S. and British airstrikes inflicted heavy military damage. 
The southern Shiite districts have long been trouble spots for Saddam's 
government. After the end of the 1991 Gulf War that routed Saddam's 
forces from Kuwait, 14 provinces in the Shiite south as well as Kurdish 
north rebelled against the government, but were put down brutally. 
The Supreme Council said the executed Mechanized Division's commander, 
who was not identified, objected to some arrangements made by al-Majid 
to counter Shiites in case they rebelled again. It said several other 
officers close to the commander were also executed in front of other 
officers. Al-Majid is known for brutality. The Supreme Council statement 
said five other officers, in the al-Rasheed military camp on the outskirts 
of Baghdad, were executed on Friday after being suspected of trying 
to move their units outside the camp.
