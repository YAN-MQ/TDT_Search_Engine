Karin Roten gave Switzerland new hope for a season first podium finish 
on Sunday, grabbing the lead in the first run of a women's World Cup 
slalom. Roten, who has just one other career World Cup victory, a 
slalom in Lillehammer, Norway in 1996, twisted her way around the 
49 gates down the Piste de l'Ours in 42.09 seconds, .23 faster than 
American Kristina Koznick. Koznick, runnerup in the World Cup slalom 
rankings last season and 11th overall, has like Rotin, just one career 
World Cup win, also a slalom in Are, Sweden last season. Australia's 
Zali Steggall, currently third in the slalom standings, clocked the 
third-fastest time, crossing in 42.39, ahead of Norway's Trine Bakke, 
.49 adrift. Ylva Nowen, the reigning World Cup slalom champion, was 
fifth, .64 back, while the current slalom leader Sabine Egger of Austria 
finished sixth in 42.79. Winner of the last slalom in Mammoth Mountain, 
United States, 17-year-old Anja Paerson of Sweden was 20th out of 
the start-hut, but overcame deteriorating course conditions to post 
the eighth-fastest chrono, .96 back. Technical specialist Deborah 
Compagnoni of Italy, the slalom Olympic silver medallist in Nagano, 
ended her chances in the first leg, veering off in the top half of 
the course.
