All but conceding defeat in a planned vote on Prime Minister Benjamin 
Netanyahu's peace policies, his closest allies were planning Sunday 
for an election campaign. The prime minister will ask parliament in 
a vote Monday to support conditions he has demanded of the Palestinians 
before Israel carries out any further pullback from the West Bank, 
according to the U.S.-brokered Wye River peace accords. If he does 
not succeed _ a near certainty as Netanyahu's coalition continues 
to disintegrate _ he has said he will go to early elections. ``The 
big question is not whether or not the early elections law will pass 
tomorrow, the question is how long'' it will be before elections take 
place, said Tourism Minister Moshe Katsav, a member of Netanyahu's 
Likud party and a close ally of the premier. Katzav said he was already 
plotting a campaign against Israel's former armed forces chief, Lt. 
Gen. Amnon Lipkin-Shahak, whom he considers the likeliest opposition 
candidate. Shahak would announce his retirement from the military 
once elections were called, Israel radio reported Sunday night, in 
a bid to stand for election. Netanyahu's Cabinet on Sunday approved 
his conditions for resuming Israel's compliance with the accords. 
Netanyahu says the conditions are necessary because the Palestinians 
have not met their obligations according to Wye. The conditions, published 
by Netanyahu's office, include: _The collection of illegally held 
weapons; _A renunciation by Palestinian leadership the intention to 
unilaterally declare independence by May, and of claims to make Jerusalem 
its capital. _Recognition that Israel never promised to release prisoners 
jailed for killing; _A stop to violence and incitement to violence. 
A fifth condition reported by Israeli media, that the Palestinians 
reduce their police force, did not appear in the final published list. 
The Palestinians, who say they have complied with Wye, derided the 
conditions. ``We have nothing to do with these five points, this is 
an election campaign,'' said Ahmed Abdel Ruhman, the secretary of 
the Palestinian cabinet. Israeli media reports say that Shahak, who 
has been on leave since stepping down as military chief in July, may 
opt to head a centrist list. Polls have shown that that would likely 
push Labor Party leader Ehud Barak out of the race in the first round 
of voting and lead to a run-off between Netanyahu and Shahak. Barak, 
whose party began the Israel-Palestinian peace process in 1993, appeared 
concerned by the prospect of a Shahak bid. ``I feel it's an unnecessary 
division of strengths, there is no `third way,''' he told Israel TV. 
Little is known of Shahak's policies _ as a soldier, he is prohibited 
from expressing an opinion _ but his deep involvement in the peace 
talks suggests that he is a moderate who favors territorial concessions. 
Katzav, Netanyahu's ally, also appeared concerned by the prospect 
of a Shahak candidacy. ``I don't yet know the way to defeat Amnon 
Shahak,'' he told reporters. Netanyahu has already lost the confidence 
of the ministers who back Wye. His defense minister, Yitzhak Mordechai, 
said Sunday night that the only way he saw out was a national unity 
government jointly led by Netanyahu and Barak. Netanyahu also faced 
defectors from hard-liners in his coalition who oppose further concessions 
to the Palestinians . Michael Kleiner, who heads a parliamentary grouping 
that opposes any further concessions, said that the hard-liners would 
run their own candidate. Netanyahu himself already seemed in elections 
mode, striking a tough pose in his one public appearance Sunday _ 
before a collection of 100 bar mitzvah boys and bat mitzvah girls 
from Israel and abroad. Citing the example of the warrior Macbabees, 
whose repulsion of the Greek empire 2,200 years ago is celebrated 
during Hanukkah, he exhorted the youths to ``battle against assimilation, 
hellenization and loss of identity.''
