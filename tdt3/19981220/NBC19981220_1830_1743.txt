That's "NBC nightly news" for this Sunday. Here's Jane pauley with 
a look at what's ahead tonight on "dateline NBC." Tonight on "Dateline" 
-- more political fallout from the historic impeachment vote on Capitol 
Hill as the battle to remove President Clinton grows more bitter by 
the day. Sexual allegations are consuming more and more reputations. 
If the republicans are going to go down the path of impeachment, then 
the republican99 republicans had better watch out in their own rear 
view mirrors. Is it open season on private lives in Washington? Tonight, 
on "Dateline." Thanks, Jane. Tom Brokaw will be here tomorrow. Thank 
you for joining us. I'm A Curry. And I'll see you tomorrow on "today." 
Stay tuned, the Sunday edition of "dateline NBC" is next.
