The government in Israel is in turmoil tonight. The nation's leader, 
Benjamin Netanyahu, faces a no confidence vote tomorrow that called 
oust him from office. Martin Fletcher reports. Benjamin Netanyahu 
doesn't look like a man about to lose his job. But the cheering hides 
desperate last-minute maneuvering by Netanyahu to remain Israel's 
prime minister. After two years of leadership, Netanyahu has lost 
the trust of those who made him prime minister, the extreme right 
who call him a sellout for giving land to the Palestinians and now 
want to topple his government. We lost trust. And we believe his government, 
by his deeds, is endangering the security of the state of Israel. 
In a last-ditch effort to win back right-wing support, netanyahu's 
cabinet today announced it would suspend the peace process until Palestinian 
chairman Yasser Arafat meets five conditions. Arafat must stop threatening 
to declare a Palestinian state next may. And Arafat must accept Israel's 
terms for freeing Palestinian prisoners. He must stop incitement and 
violence against Israelis. Finally, he must collect illegal weapons 
and reduce the size of his police force. In effect, the peace process 
is over until after new elections. It was never clear if Netanyahu 
really supported the peace process. Now, says the left, the truth 
is out. It is not a sacrifice for him to stop the peace process. He 
just doesn't believe in it. Netanyahu's government is collapsing from 
within. Even some of his supporters say tomorrow in parliament they 
will vote for new elections. Voting Netanyahu out of office is one 
thing, electing a new leader is another. Most analysts here, including 
his opponents believe Netanyahu, a brilliant campaigner, still has 
a 50/50 chance of being reelected. Martin Fletcher, NBC, Tel Aviv.
