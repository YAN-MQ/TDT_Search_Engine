South Korean navy ships using sonar scanners continued to search Sunday 
for a sunken North Korean spy boat off South Korea's south coast, 
military officials said. The 12-ton spy boat went down in waters 110 
meters (yards) deep before dawn Friday in a gun battle with South 
Korean navy ships. The body of a crewman armed with a hand grenade 
and knife was recovered after the vessel sank. Officials said navy 
ships were searching for more bodies and wreckage of the sunken boat. 
``Recovery of the sunken ship is needed to determine the exact number 
of crewmen, its equipment and mission,'' said Maj. Gen. Lee Jang-hum 
who heads an investigation into the case. Announcing his team's findings, 
Lee said the communist boat, believed to be carrying up to eight crewmen, 
sailed out of North Korea's western port of Nampo, home to a major 
naval intelligence unit. The spy boat was first spotted shortly before 
midnight Thursday as it approached Yosu, a port on the southern tip 
of the Korean Peninsula. The boat was pursued for hours by South Korean 
warships and air force planes before it was sunk in a gun battle. 
Lee said his team has concluded that the communist craft was foiled 
in an attempt to land spies. He described the sunken vessel as a ``semi-submersible 
craft,'' commonly used by North Koreans to drop off or pick up spies. 
Launched from a ``mother ship'' which stays in international waters, 
such a craft can be operated with virtually all of its body under 
water without being detected by radar, Lee said. ``It is believed 
to be a renovated model, about 12.8 meters (39 feet) long, twice as 
big as the old type,'' he said. A North Korean boat of the same type 
was seized in a gun battle off South Korea's south coast in 1983. 
One agent was killed and two others captured. On Saturday, Seoul's 
Defense Ministry demanded an apology from North Korea for the infiltration. 
North Korea rejected the South Korean accusations as a fabrication. 
Several North Korean spy crafts have been caught infiltrating South 
Korean waters in recent years. In June, a 70-ton North Korean submarine 
was found off South Korea's east coast with its propeller and periscope 
tangled in a fishing net. South Koreans cut through the hatch and 
found nine bodies, all shot dead in an apparent suicide pact. Seoul 
officials said it was on a spy mission. North Korea and South Korea 
are still technically still at war, because the 1950-53 Korean War 
ended in an armistice, not a peace treaty.
