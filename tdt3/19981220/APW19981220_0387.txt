Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu made a last-ditch effort on Sunday 
to garner support for his hawkish peace policies, while his opponents 
on the left and right prepared to face him in new elections. The prime 
minister is slated to ask the Parliament in a vote Monday to support 
conditions he has demanded of the Palestinians before Israel carries 
out another troop withdrawal from parts of the West Bank, according 
to the U.S.-brokered Wye River peace accords. If he does not succeed 
_ a near certainty _ he has said he will go to early elections. Netanyahu's 
Cabinet on Sunday approved his conditions for resuming Israel's compliance 
with the accords. Netanyahu says the conditions are necessary because 
the Palestinians have not met their obligations according to Wye. 
The conditions, published by Netanyahu's office, include: _The collection 
of illegally-held weapons; _A renunciation by Palestinian leadership 
the intention to declare unilaterally a Palestinian state by May, 
and of claims on Jerusalem as the capital of such a state; _Recognition 
that Israel never promised to release prisoners jailed for killing; 
_A stop to violence and incitement to violence. A fifth condition 
reported by Israeli media, that the Palestinians reduce their police 
force, did not appear in the final published list. Foreign Minister 
Ariel Sharon suggested during the Cabinet meeting that Israel prepare 
a bill to annex all the West Bank and Gaza territories Israel still 
controls, to become law as soon as the Palestinians declare a state. 
Netanyahu asked his attorney general to study the possibility of preparing 
such a bill.
