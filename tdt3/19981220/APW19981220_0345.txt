A car bomb in southeastern Iran on Sunday damaged several buildings 
but caused no casualties, state-run television said. The television 
also reported that seven people were killed in a separate explosion 
near the northern city of Qazvin. The official Islamic Republic News 
Agency said the blast in Qazvin was Friday. The blasts come at a time 
of high tension between moderate and hard-line rivals inside Iran's 
Islamic government. They also come amid a series of attacks that have 
taken the lives of five dissidents in just over a month. The incident 
in Qazvin, 150 kilometers (93 miles) northwest of the Iranian capital 
Tehran, took place when ``some explosives caught fire,'' the television 
said. It said seven people died, but gave no other details. The television 
said the car bomb exploded outside an office of the hard-line Basij 
volunteer militia in the southeastern city of Zahedan. IRNA quoted 
provincial authorities as saying they had found clues indicating that 
the perpetrators of the Zahedan bombing had slipped into Iran from 
across the border. The report did not say which border, but Zahedan 
is close to Iran's border with Pakistan. The bomb was hidden in a 
car that was stolen two weeks ago in Zahedan, IRNA said.
