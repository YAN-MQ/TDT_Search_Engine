cold front continues to move off the eastern seaboard on Sunday with 
snow showers possible for lake superior, southward into Wisconsin.

to rapidly move northeastward, dragging a cold front through most 
of the southwest. Snow showers and rain will be prevalent across most 
of the central plains stretching into the Tennessee and Ohio river 
valleys by late Monday. A high pressure Ridge will build into the 
western United States, but a Stationary front just off shore of Washington 
will keep most of that area in rain and snow showers. Temperatures, 
bitterly cold today with temperatures below zero for most of the northern 
plains and the northern Rockies. The only warm spots will be the gulf 
coast where you will see 60s and 70s in your forecast, 80s for southern

plains on tuesday with a heavy mix in the northeast. Scattered showers
