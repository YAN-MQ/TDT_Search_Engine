NICOSIA, Cyprus (AP) _ U.N.-sponsored talks with Greek Cypriot and 
Turkish Cypriot leaders are making progress and reducing tension, 
a U.N. official said Sunday. The remarks were made at a news conference 
by Dame Ann Hercus, who is conducting the separate talks as a representative 
of U.N. Secretary-General Kofi Annan. ``I believe we have a substantive 
and substantial process underway,'' she told reporters. ``I would 
not continue if progress was not being made.'' Hercus, a former New 
Zealand Cabinet minister, has spent the past eight weeks shuttling 
across the U.N. buffer zone for separate meetings with President Glafcos 
Clerides, the Greek Cypriot leader, and Turkish Cypriot leader Rauf 
Denktash. Cyprus has been split into a Greek Cypriot-controlled south 
and a Turkish-occupied north since 1974, when Turkish troops invaded 
following an abortive coup by Greek Cypriot supporters of union with 
Greece. Tension has risen on the island following the Greek Cypriot 
decision to purchase Russian S-300 anti-aircraft missiles. The talks 
``have the dual goal of reducing tension and promoting progress toward 
a just and lasting settlement,'' she said. She said she was ``genuinely 
encouraged by the two leaders' positive and constructive approach 
to the goal set by the secretary-general.'' She refused to give details.
