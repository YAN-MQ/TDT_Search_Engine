Can Chelsea stay there? Gianluca Vialli's team has hit the top of 
the Premier League for the first time in almost 10 years. The question 
now is whether the fashionable west London team can match its only 
other league triumph 44 seasons ago. Chelsea's collection of stars 
from around the world have defied the critics who argued they lacked 
consistency. They are now considered strong title contenders along 
with Manchester United. It's likely that Chelsea will only stay top 
for two days. Saturday's 2-0 victory over Tottenham at Stamford Bridge 
enabled Vialli's star-studded team to jump from third to first and 
head Aston Villa on goal difference. All Villa has to do to get its 
lead back is gain a draw at home to struggling Charlton on Monday. 
So Chelsea, which has not lost in the league since the opening day 
of the season and is unbeaten in 17 games, may not have long to savor 
the moment. Yet all the signs are that Vialli's team has the talent 
and the new-found determination to maintain its title challenge. Chelsea 
has always had talented players. It's problem always has been an inability 
to stay the distance in long title races and the club has been outlasted 
by more consistent teams like Manchester United, Arsenal and Liverpool. 
Performances like last Wednesday's 1-1 tie at Old Trafford, where 
Chelsea fell behind to Manchester United but hit back strongly in 
the last 30 minutes to gain a tie and almost snatch victory, was a 
sign of the new Chelsea. Vialli knows that, even if Chelsea loses 
its place at the top on Monday, it has the character and the players 
to get back. He believes they have the ability to stay there. ``The 
players are very happy and going top might give us a lot of confidence. 
It's important to get into that position but it's even more important 
to stay there,'' Vialli said. ``Now everybody thinks that Chelsea 
are one of the best teams in England and they try everything to beat 
us. Life will be even more difficult in the future. I will be curious 
to see how we will react but I do think we'll be able to cope with 
that as we have experienced players who are used to staying at the 
top.'' While Italian striker Gianfranco Zola has returned to close 
to his best form and French World Cup defenders Marcel Desailly and 
Franck Leboeuf have formed a solid alliance at the back, Vialli sees 
Uruguayan midfielder Gustavo Poyet as probably the biggest influence 
in his team's surge to the top. ``He's one of the most clever players 
that I've played with in all my career,'' the former Sampdoria and 
Juventus striker said. ``He scores a lot of goals and also works very 
hard for the team. He's got an unbelievable attitude and is always 
positive. He's one of the players all the managers would love to have. 
``Unfortunately, he missed six months last season through injury and 
that was very important for Chelsea,'' Vialli said. ``He was one of 
the reasons why we were in a great position last season and probably 
people have only started talking about him this season because he's 
playing regular football. ``He can do everything. He can defend, he 
can play fancy football, his runs are always very clever, his passes 
are very precise,'' the Chelsea manager said. ``He is the complete 
midfielder.'' Poyet hit Chelsea's first goal against Spurs on Saturday 
with 10 minutes remaining to take his total for the season to 10, 
including seven in the league. ``I was a striker in my younger days 
so I know about scoring goals and hopefully I can go on and beat that 
record this season,'' said Poyet, who was a consistent scorer over 
seven seasons for Real Zaragoza including 14 in his last season in 
Spain. Poyet has more chances to score at struggling Southampton on 
Saturday before Chelsea has a high-powered game against Manchester 
United at Stamford Bridge Dec. 29.
