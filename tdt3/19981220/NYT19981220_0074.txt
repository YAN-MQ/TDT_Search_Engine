NATIONAL FORECAST A wintry mix of precipitation will fall Monday across 
interior northern New England as a developing low-pressure system 
over the Great Lakes pushes a warm front toward the region. A few 
inches of snow will accumulate in interior Maine while sleet and freezing 
rain yield to rain in the St. Lawrence Valley. Snow will also fall 
behind the low in parts of Wisconsin and northern Michigan, where 
amounts will reach six inches in a few areas. Rain showers with a 
few rumbles of thunder will accompany a powerful Arctic cold front 
draped from the low from Ohio to eastern Texas. Some of the showers 
will be heavy, as increasing breezes from the south provide ample 
moisture. Ahead of the front over much of the Southeast and Middle 
Atlantic States, temperatures will be unseasonably warm, especially 
along the Carolina and Georgia coastline where hazy sunshine boosts 
readings into the upper 70s. Farther west, patchy freezing drizzle 
and light snow will develop in the shallow cold air just west of the 
front from western Missouri to Colorado. Mainly dry but bitterly cold 
air will predominate from the western corn belt to the central and 
northern Rockies as expansive high pressure continues to funnel cold 
air from Canada into the area. Snow will fall in areas of Washington 
and northern Oregon as a disturbance lifts chilly air over the region. 
A few inches are likely to accumulate, even in Seattle and Portland. 
California and the desert Southwest will be sunny but cool as temperatures 
struggle to reach 60 degrees in many areas. Focus: Official Start? 
The astronomical start of winter occurs Monday evening at 8:56 EST, 
when the sun's rays strike the Tropic of Capricorn perpendicularly 
at local noon. This ``winter solstice'' will take place in the south 
Pacific just south of New Caledonia. Though TV-weathercasters pontificate 
that this astronomical event marks the ``official'' start of winter, 
the start of meteorological winter is commonly accepted as Dec. 1, 
traditionally the first day of the three coldest months of the year. 
Dec. 5, which, on average, marks the start of the coldest three-month 
period, also stakes a valid claim.
