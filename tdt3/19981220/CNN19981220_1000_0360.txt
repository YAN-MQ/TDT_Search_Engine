The next speaker of the house could be a relatively unknown congressman, 
dennis Hastert of Illinois. Tom Watkins reports, despite his lack 
of national notoriety, Hastert has a Proven track record. The man 
who hopes to lead the House of Representatives has proven he can March 
in step, and J. Dennis Hastert III has shown he can twist arms. He 
is, after all, a former high school wrestling coach. Tom cross was 
one of his students. Not flashy, not a guy that yelled and screamed 
but taught you what you needed to know and got the job done. The job 
he now wants to get done is a big one. Only hours after speaker-elect 
Bob Livingston announced his resignation, republican leaders turned 
to Hastert. Well, Denny Hastert is a person who can pull people together. 
He is a good organizer. He's also virtually unknown outside Congress 
and his home district near Chicago. In a statement Saturday, he said 
-- for 16 years, Hastert taught high school. In 1980, he served in 
the Illinois legislature before squeaking into congress in 1986, with 
52% of the vote. Since then, he has consolidated power as chief deputy 
majority whip. He has a strong support across the ideological spectrum 
of the republican party and frankly respect on the democratic side. 
Dr. Doug maines, whom Hastert beat handily two years ago, is not impressed. 
I think Dennis is very partisan. In my opinion, he's on the far right 
of the republican party. I never thought of him as a bridge builder 
at all. But Hastert has strong allies. After the attempted coup from 
Gingrich's own party left the speaker looking for loyal friends last 
year, Hastert filled the Bill. Kindness from such friends may land 
him the job. If so, the question will be, can he lead the parade? 
Tom Watkins, CNN.
