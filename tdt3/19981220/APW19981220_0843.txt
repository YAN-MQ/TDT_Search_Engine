Spain's small Jewish community publicly celebrated Hanukkah on Sunday 
for the first time in more than 500 years, lighting candles at the 
same spot where their ancestors sought protection centuries ago from 
anti-Semitic violence sweeping the country. ``This is an emotional 
and unforgettable day,'' Mayor Joaquim Nadal told the outdoor gathering 
seated in early evening darkness beside the ruins of Gironella Tower, 
where residents of the city's Jewish quarter found refuge from marauding 
crowds in 1391. The ritualistic lighting of candles on the eighth 
and final day of Hanukkah attracted nearly 1,000 people, including 
many non-Jews. ``It moves me to be standing at this spot,'' said Israel's 
chief Sephardic rabbi, Eliahu Bakshi Doron, who led the ceremony. 
Sephardic Jews trace their roots back to Spain. The celebration was 
organized by the Spanish Federation of Jewish Communities with the 
backing of city and regional governments. Doron said the lighting 
of the eight candles _ a ninth candle is used to light the others 
_ in the 4.5-meter (15-foot) tall Menorah symbolized ``peace and love 
in a world of war and tragedy.'' Hanukkah commemorates the Jewish 
uprising more than 2,000 years ago against the Greek-Syrian kingdom, 
which had tried to impose its culture and adorn the Jewish Temple 
in Jerusalem with statues of Greek gods. Jewish legend says that when 
a small group of Jewish warriors tried to rekindle the temple's eternal 
flame, they found only enough oil for one day. But the oil lasted 
eight days and is believed to have been a miracle. Jewish leaders 
said they had wanted to hold public worship services in 1992 to commemorate 
the 500th anniversary of the expulsion from Spain of all Jews, but 
it had taken until this year to organize it in a setting with deep 
Jewish roots. Although no Jews are known to live today in Girona, 
a city of 74,000 in the northeastern Catalonian region, it has one 
of the best-preserved medieval Jewish quarters in Europe. The city 
has spent hundreds of thousands of dollars on its restoration. ``This 
celebration demonstrates that in Spain there is true religious liberty,'' 
said Assumcio Hosta, a city official who helped organize the event. 
Between 12,000 and 25,000 Jews are estimated to live in Spain, compared 
with more than 200,000 when the Catholic monarchs, King Ferdinand 
and Queen Isabella, ordered all Jews to convert to Christianity or 
get out of the country in 1492. Most Jews left for Portugal, which 
in turn expelled all its Jews four years later. Most of the Spanish, 
or Sephardic, Jews ended up in North Africa, although others went 
to France and Italy and the Ottoman Empire. Later, the state-sponsored 
Catholic Inquisition hunted down converted Jews suspected of secretly 
practicing their traditional religion, burning an estimated 20,000 
to 30,000 at the stake. Until 20 years ago, Spain remained an exclusively 
Roman Catholic country, except for some short periods of religious 
tolerance in the 19th century and early 20th century. Sunday's celebration 
was the latest demonstration of Spain's new religious tolerance. Other 
milestones include the 1978 constitution, which reestablished democracy 
and freedom of worship and legislation in 1992 putting Islam, Protestant 
Christianity and Judaism on an equal footing with Roman Catholicism.
