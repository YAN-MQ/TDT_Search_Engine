Olympic downhill champion Jean-Luc Cretier was taken home by ambulance 
Sunday, the day after suffering a season-ending knee injury. Team 
officials quoted the French skier as saying that he was thinking of 
retirement following his worst injury in a 13-year career. Cretier 
added however that he would take a final decision following surgery 
and rehabilitation. The 32-year-old French downhiller tore the cruciate 
ligament of his left knee and fractured his left hand following a 
high-speed spill in the upper part of the icy Saslong track during 
Saturday's World Cup downhill in Val Gardena. Cretier, who lives in 
La Plagne, lost his balance following a jump, skidded off the track 
and fell over a ridge of snow and grass. He was one of the five skiers 
who suffered season-ending knee injuries in falls during consecutive 
downhills in this north Italian valley. Cretier, who never won a World 
Cup race, captured the Olympic downhill title in Nagano this year 
beating Lasse Kjus and Hannes Trinkl.
