Sentimental favorite Stuart Appleby shot a 17-under-par 271 to claim 
on Sunday his first professional victory in his home country and his 
first solo win since the death of his wife in July. Cheered on by 
a gallery which included his parents and members of his late wife 
Renay's family, the 27-year-old Australian shot rounds of 69, 70, 
a course record 63, and a final round 69 to win the Coolum Classic. 
Renay was killed in a freak accident when she was crushed by a car 
outside a London railway station. The tragedy devastated Appleby and 
sent shock waves through the world golfing community. Appleby said 
after his four-stroke win over Australian Craig Spence that he only 
decided to play the tournament because of the good times he and Renay 
had shared together at the host resort. ``I feel very lucky and fortunate 
that I'm here because I was only months ago deciding whether I'd bail 
out,'' said Appleby. ``On sentimental reasons, coming here was probably 
more of a decision made by Renay than me, because she just loved the 
place. ``I was a little worried it was going to be an emotional week 
for me.'' Appleby set up his win earlier in the day, returning at 
dawn to complete his third round, a course record 63 which included 
nine birdies, before starting his final round one shot ahead of Spence. 
At the halfway stage of the storm-marred tournament, Appleby was seven 
shots behind Spence. He won by four strokes despite a bogey on the 
72nd hole _ his first dropped shot in 49 holes. Appleby's confidence 
is high after finishing second at the Australian Open at the tough 
Royal Adelaide course and then helping Peter Thomson's Internationals 
upset a star-studded U.S. team in the Presidents Cup at Royal Melbourne. 
Five-time British open winner Thomson commented after Appleby's win 
that he could now go on and take out either the U.S. or British Open 
next year. ``I believe that too, I had my first top 10 in the U.S. 
Open just gone,'' Appleby said. Spence was satisfied to have fought 
hard against a player who has already won twice on the demanding U.S. 
tour. ``I was really happy the way I held up,'' said Spence, who said 
his chance was lost at the ninth when Appleby made birdie and he dropped 
a shot. ``To lead all the way would have been awesome ... but it's 
not like I played badly and fell back in the pack.'' Tony Carolan 
finished with a seven-under 65 to tie for third place with Appleby's 
Presidents Cup teammate Craig Parry at 278. Australia's Paul Gow crashed 
from 10-under to 5-under after a horrendous quintuple-bogey nine at 
the 371-meter par-4 13th hole. Gow finished in a tie for 11th at 283.

Sunday by four strokes following a final-round three-under-par 69 
for a 17-under total of 271.
