The year may be winding down, but executive changes at agencies show 
no signs of following suit. There were shifts late last week at shops 
including Messner Vetere Berger McNamee Schmetterer Euro RSCG, Partners 
&AMP; Shevack/Wolf, D'Arcy Masius Benton &AMP; Bowles Communications 
and Digital Pulp. The broadest changes came at Messner Vetere in New 
York, a unit of Havas Advertising, which restructured top management. 
Ron Berger, 49, who had been one of four managing partners in an office 
of the chief executive, sharing administrative and management duties, 
becomes the sole chief executive. He continues as chief creative officer. 
The other three managing partners _ Tom Messner, 54; Louise McNamee, 
49, and Barry Vetere, 55 _ become partners, focusing on offering clients 
advice on strategy, marketing and advertising. ``The agency has grown 
over the last four years from under $600 million in billings to close 
to $1.2 billion,'' Berger said in a telephone interview on Friday, 
``as we've produced global work for major clients like Intel, Philips, 
Volvo and MCI Worldcom. It became clear to us that the agency needed 
to be organized around the scope of those needs.'' The other major 
aspect of the restructuring involves the appointments of 10 partners 
to the new positions of managing directors. Six are creative executives, 
paired in three teams: Michael Lee, 46, with Paul Wolfe, 51; Joe O'Neill, 
52, with Marcus Kemp, 47, and Phil Silvestri, 44, with Rich Roth, 
56. The others are: Tom Carroll, 43, who will oversee business development; 
Larry Dexheimer, 57, agency operations, Denis Glennon, 47, worldwide 
agency affiliations, and Joanne Tilove, 50, the MCI Worldcom account. 
At Partners &AMP; Shevack/Wolf, a New York-based unit of Wolf Group, 
Mike Rogers is joining as executive creative director. That post had 
been vacant since 1996. Rogers, 47, had most recently been vice chairman 
and chief creative officer at the DDB Needham New York unit of Omnicom 
Group, where he worked on campaigns for clients like the New York 
state lottery and Michelin. He resigned from DDB Needham New York 
in July after almost 18 years there. At DMB&AMP;B, a unit of MacManus 
Group in New York, Garry Titterton has been named to the new position 
of president for the Asia-Pacific region, based in Hong Kong. The 
position is being created, effective on Jan. 11, as DMB&AMP;B regroups 
various Asian-Pacific offices under a single regional organization. 
Titterton, 50, joins DMB&AMP;B from McCann-Erickson Worldwide Advertising, 
part of the McCann-Erickson World Group unit of Interpublic Group 
of Cos., where he had been executive vice president for the Asia-Pacific 
region, based in Singapore. At Digital Pulp in New York, which specializes 
in Internet advertising, a new top executive is being hired from a 
client company. He is Lee Nadler, 31, who joins from Double Click 
Inc. in New York, where he had held two titles; one was straightforward, 
director for global marketing, and the other was fanciful, marketing 
sherpa. At Digital Pulp, Nadler becomes chief executive, a new position, 
and president, assuming those duties from Steven Sachs, president 
and creative director. Sachs, 32, takes the new post of chief creative 
director. Nadler will also take a fanciful title at Digital Pulp, 
lead sherpa. Bruce Goodman, 33, who founded Digital Pulp with Sachs 
and had been vice president and creative director, becomes chief Web 
architect, a new post. In another personnel move related to Internet 
advertising, Rich LeFurgy has joined Ad Knowledge in Palo Alto, Calif., 
as a consultant, to start and head a strategic advisory board. LeFurgy, 
42, will be based in New York, where he continues as chairman of the 
Internet Advertising Bureau, an industry association. LeFurgy also 
remains the chairman of the FAST Forward Steering Committee, which 
was formed in response to a call from Procter &AMP; Gamble Co. to 
speed the development of Internet advertising.
