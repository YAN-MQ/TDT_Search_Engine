When "NBC nightly news" continues -- fraud at the pharmacy. These 
days, everything's faster. So how come pain relief isn't faster? Introducing 
Advil liqui-gels-- on tough pain, they're stronger and faster than 
extra strength Tylenol. New Advil liqui-gels. Pain relief stronger 
and faster. I shoulda used preparation H. if you had, you wouldn't 
be suffering now. Preparation H helps stop itch and further irritation... 
with a soothing layer of protection. I shoulda used preparation H. 
the other day I'm driving down Broadway when that pastrami on rye 
catches up with me. Heartburn big time. My passenger says "here, take 
a Zantac 75." I say, "what are you, a doctor?" And he says, "yeah." 
The medicine in Zantac 75 is the #1 doctor-prescribed acid reducer. 
It relieves even your toughest heartburn controlling acid for up to 
12 hours. A real gentleman, that doctor. Zantac 75 for tough heartburn.
