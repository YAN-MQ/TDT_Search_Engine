If you've got a cell phone and are looking for ways to save money, 
going completely wireless might make sense. Bruce Francis reports. 
Ten months ago, derby Perez made a decision that changed his life. 
He decided to go completely wireless. That's the way to go. Because 
you have more time in your life. I am definitely, definitely excited 
about the cell phone. The real estate agent is part of an increasing 
number of people who are cutting the cord, so to speak. It's a growing 
trend. People are canceling their home or office phone service because 
as the rates for wireless go down, and with Sprint PCs, we offer some 
very attractive plans that, in fact, encourage this type of behavior. 
One such customer, Kenny Jung, says the savings from going completely 
wireless are considerable. The plan I'm on, if you choose correctly, 
can include all long distance calls. When I travel, I have the convenience 
of using my cell phone without any added cost. There's no roaming 
fees, et cetera. Pricing plans for wireless phones can vary a lot. 
Sprint PCs offers a plan for $69.99 a month. Users get 600 minutes 
for calls anywhere on its nationwide network, which covers 180 major 
markets. Thrown into the package -- all domestic long distance charges 
and standard features such as caller I.D., three-way calling and voice 
mail. AT&T has a similar plan, which runs $89.99 a month. Phones can 
cost anywhere from $30 to $400, depending on the model. Even with 
cheaper phone rates, however, going exclusively wireless may not be 
for everyone. For a family or someone who shares a phone number, it 
doesn't make sense as much. But for single urban dwellers who spend 
little time at home, the future may indeed be wireless. That's "your 
money." Bruce Francis, "CNN Financial News," New York.
