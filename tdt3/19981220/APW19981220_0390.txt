Nepal's Prime Minister Girija Prasad Koirala, whose government appeared 
set to fall, managed to persuade another party Sunday to help keep 
him in power. Koirala struck a deal with the United Marxist-Leninist 
Communist Party of Nepal, one of the two big communist groups. The 
Marxist-Leninist Communist Party of Nepal nearly toppled Koirala's 
government when the party's 13 ministers quit the cabinet over several 
local disputes. A group of opposition parties filed a no-confidence 
motion Sunday. Koirala then asked King Birendra, the titular head 
of government, to call for elections. Birendra refused and instead 
asked political parties to try to cobble together another government. 
Under Nepali law, new elections must be held by November, but the 
agreement reached Sunday calls for elections by April 13, the end 
of the Nepalese year. The prime minister's Nepali Congress has 87 
lawmakers. With the support of 49 lawmakers from the communist group, 
he has a clear majority in the 205-member lower house of Parliament. 
On Monday, Koirala will formally resign as prime minister of the minority 
government, a technical requirement. He will then form a new government 
with the help of the new communist partner and will have to prove 
his majority in a confidence vote in the legislature. Until 1990, 
Nepal was an absolute monarchy, but a pro-democracy movement forced 
constitutional reforms that reduced King Birendra to a figurehead. 
Nepal has been politically unstable since then, with five prime ministers 
in the last four years.
