Saddam Hussein is claiming a victory for Iraq after four nights of 
bombing. But the U.S. is claiming victory as well. NBC's Jim Miklaszewski 
is at the Pentagon tonight. The shooting may have stopped for now, 
but the crews aboard the "USS enterprise" in the Persian gulf remain 
locked and loaded, ready to strike Iraq all over again. In Washington 
today, Clinton administration officials launched their own public 
relations blitz, to declare the 70-hour bombing campaign a success. 
We're very satisfied that the mission was accomplished successfully 
with no loss to either British or American forces. In four straight 
nights of air strikes, American forces pounded nearly 100 targets 
in Iraq. The goal was to degrade Saddam Hussein's ability to produce 
and deliver weapons of mass destruction. We hit nine of his missile 
research and development facilities. We don't think he'll be doing 
any more research and development with his missiles for at least over 
a year. But many of the air strikes were aimed almost directly at 
Saddam hussein himself. Gun camera video shows a tight pattern of 
bombs dropped on the barracks for the special republican guards, Saddam's 
personal protection force, hit with 18 separate strikes. In Bahrain 
today, United Nations weapons inspectors headed home for the holidays, 
but after U.S. air strikes, they may never return. Military force 
may now be the only means to keep Saddam Hussein's deadly weapons 
in check. We have said very clearly that we reserve the right to use 
force again, and i think we've proven our ability to deliver a very 
tough blow. With that as a real possibility, U.S. forces prepare for 
still one more Christmas in the Persian gulf. Despite President Clinton's 
decision to call off air strike strikes, their success is still a 
question tonight. Sources tell us that it will take several months 
to determine what those bombs they have destroyed. Jim Miklaszewski, 
NBC news, the Pentagon.
