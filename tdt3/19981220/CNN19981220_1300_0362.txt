With "operation desert fox" at an end, President Clinton says the 
United States will continue to maintain a strong military presence 
in the region. The U.S. and Britain halted the military action against 
Iraq yesterday, after four days of intense air strikes. President 
Clinton says economic sanctions will continue until Iraq complies 
with U.N. resolutions and cooperates with weapons inspectors. No British 
or American casualties were reported in the operation. U.S. officials 
say Iraq's missile program has been set back at least a Year. As a 
result of this mission that took 70 hours, Saddam Hussein is weaker, 
because all the targets and things that he cares about most have been 
destroyed. Many of them. The region is safer because we have managed 
to degrade his ability to threaten his neighbors. The box that he 
is in is stronger because of the credibility of our use of force, 
and we have done this with all of a minimum of criticism in the international 
community.
