Call it the ``Full Monty'' wager. Last year, flush with money from 
the bull market in stocks and seeing a big upside potential in inexpensive 
little films, three independent film companies were set up by players 
better known as financiers than auteurs. There was Artisan Entertainment, 
bankrolled by the venture capital firm Bain Capital, which had advised 
clients about investing in movie companies, but never before bought 
one. There was Lions Gate Entertainment, headed by Frank Giustra, 
an investment banker in Vancouver, British Columbia, whose prior specialty 
was taking mining companies public. And then there was Stratosphere 
Entertainment, founded by the corporate raider Carl C. Icahn. Driving 
their ambitions was the quest to find or, even better, to make a movie 
as successful as Fox Searchlight's ``Full Monty,'' a 1997 release 
that cost only $3.5 million but grossed $256 million worldwide. Fox 
Searchlight is owned by News Corp. Because of the attendant glamour, 
``there is a huge appeal for people to finance movies, especially 
in good years,'' said Mark Curcio, chief executive of Artisan Entertainment. 
``There are always irrational reasons for investing. If it's not movies, 
it's airlines. And probably casinos and sports teams.'' For each of 
the new, financially attuned companies, the real attraction was the 
prospect of spotting a bargain and playing it like a growth stock 
_ as Artisan did, when it paid $500,000 at the Sundance Festival for 
``Pi,'' a film about a man's mystical obsession with numbers that 
has grossed $3 million at the U.S. box office. ``I got the world for 
$500,000,'' crowed Amir Malin, one of Artisan's two presidents. And 
yet, despite occasionally catching the eye of the critics, most notably 
with Lions Gate's Golden Globe nominee ``Gods and Monsters,'' there 
is no certainty that these independent film upstarts will fare any 
better in the art-film market than the last time a pack of start-up 
companies entered the independent film business _ during the high-flying 
1980s. ``Today mirrors the '80s, when companies like New World, Atlantic 
Releasing and Cinecom were all gearing to go public,'' said Tom Bernard, 
the co-president of Sony Pictures Classics, which, like many of the 
most prominent ``independents'' today, is actually owned by a large 
studio. By the early '90s New World, Atlantic Releasing and Cinecom 
had left the independent film business. This time around, like such 
established independent film companies as Sony Pictures Classics and 
Disney's Miramax, the new crop of independents produces movies as 
well as buys them. And so far, among the three upstarts, Artisan seems 
to be in the lead. Bain Capital, in partnership with the investment 
fund Richland Gordon &AMP; Co., formed Artisan out of the old Live 
Entertainment, which had primarily been a video distributor and owned 
a video library of 1,700 titles including ``Terminator 2'' and ``Basic 
Instinct.'' ``In order to build a lasting independent company you 
need to buy a library and build a stable cash-flow stream,'' Curcio 
said. ``Then you can leverage that into doing smart production.'' 
Artisan has expanded its video library to more than 6,000 titles. 
Among films that Artisan has produced itself, the company this year 
had a critical success _ if not a financial one _ with ``Permanent 
Midnight,'' starring Ben Stiller. And Artisan will soon release Roman 
Polanski's ``Ninth Gate,'' starring Johnny Depp and Frank Langella. 
Curcio said he was satisfied with the first year's results. ``Live 
was $120 million in revenue,'' he said. ``At the end of this year 
we will be over $200 million in revenue, and very profitable.'' He 
declined to elaborate _ the prerogative of a private company. Many 
people heard of Lions Gate for the first time in May, when the magic 
name Leonardo DiCaprio was attached to Lions Gate's planned film ``American 
Psycho,'' based on the controversial Bret Easton Ellis novel. But 
after the director, Mary Harron, was shouldered aside to allow DiCaprio 
to choose his own director, the actor himself backed out of the deal. 
Ms. Harron recently returned to the project, in which the male lead 
will now be played by Christian Bale. Lions Gate Entertainment, based 
in Vancouver, is publicly traded on the Toronto Stock Exchange. And, 
as of last month its shares were listed on the American Stock Exchange, 
where they have drifted in the $3.25 to $3.50 range, closing Friday 
at $3.1875, unchanged for the day. Expanding into the U.S. equities 
market is part of the company's growth plan. ``Now that we have access 
to capital, we can exploit that access,'' said Jeff Sackman, president 
of Lions Gate Films, the film production and acquisition division 
of Lions Gate Entertainment. Lions Gate Entertainment had a net loss 
of $1.34 million (Canadian), or $870,500 (United States) in its fiscal 
second quarter, which ended Sept. 30, but operating earnings of $464,000 
(Canadian) on revenue of $24.3 million (Canadian). The founder, Giustra, 
has set up Lions Gate Entertainment as a broad-based film entertainment 
company. The Lions Gate Films division is the former Cinepix Film 
Properties, which had 800 films in its library before being acquired 
by Giustra. Lions Gate Entertainment also has a production deal with 
the producer Peter Guber's Mandalay Entertainment, which has made 
films with solid box-office results like ``I Know What You Did Last 
Summer.'' Lions Gate Films' year-end hopes rest with ``Affliction,'' 
a film starring Nick Nolte, Sissy Spacek, James Coburn and Willem 
Dafoe that opens Dec. 30 and for which Nolte has been nominated for 
a Golden Globe award. The third new company, Stratosphere, is off 
to a slower beginning. Having started from scratch, rather than acquiring 
other distributors, Icahn's company has no library of old films. And 
it has the added challenge of specializing in the release of foreign 
films _ a hard way for a U.S. film company to make money, despite 
Miramax's success at that game. Of the handful of foreign films it 
has acquired, Stratosphere has released the subtitled Austrian film 
``Inheritors,'' and the subtitled Russian-language film ``The Thief,'' 
which was nominated for an Academy Award for the best foreign-language 
film. ``I know I broke even on `The Thief,' maybe even made money,'' 
said Paul E. Cohen, an experienced independent film executive who 
runs Stratosphere for Icahn. ``We've done about $1.1 million to date.'' 
The company had a rougher time, though, with its U.S. films like ``One 
Tough Cop,'' starring Stephen Baldwin. Stratosphere paid $2.25 million 
for the movie, which has taken in only $1.5 million since opening 
11 weeks ago. But it has high hopes for ``Hideous Kinky,'' a film 
starring the ``Titanic'' heroine Kate Winslet, which Stratosphere 
will release next year. For the independent film companies, the hot 
foreign markets of last year have cooled. Sackman of Lions Gate Films 
acknowledges international concerns. ``Clearly, the worldwide economic 
situation affects this industry as much as any others,'' he said. 
``We know what we're doing, but I wouldn't recommend others get into 
it. Not now.''
