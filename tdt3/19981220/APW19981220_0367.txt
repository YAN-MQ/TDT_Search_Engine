The impeachment vote against U.S. President Bill Clinton made headlines 
around the world Sunday, though most governments remained silent on 
the political turmoil in the United States. The lower house of the 
U.S. Congress impeached Clinton on Saturday for obstructing justice 
and lying under oath about his sexual affair with Monica Lewinsky, 
voting largely along party lines to send his case to the Senate. Government 
leaders elsewhere were reluctant to make public statements about the 
impeachment vote, calling it a matter for Americans to resolve on 
their own. Philippine Pres. Joseph Estrada, who has faced allegations 
of womanizing in the past, declined to respond to questions about 
the vote and British Prime Minister Tony Blair, a staunch ally of 
Clinton's, said it was an internal U.S. matter and that it would not 
be right for him to comment. In France, Jack Lang, the former Socialist 
Culture Minister who is now president of the Foreign Affairs Commission 
in France's National Assembly, on Sunday reaffirmed his long-standing 
support of Clinton. He said the U.S. president has been ``the victim 
of a witch hunt from another era.'' The House of Representatives has 
``just offered the world a festival of hypocrisy,'' he said, adding 
that the proceedings had been a ``parody of justice'' and a ``sectarian 
fundamentalism'' that risks destabilizing a great democracy.'' David 
Bar-Illan, senior advisor to Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, 
and Ziad Abu Zayyad, Palestinian legislator and Minister without Portfolio, 
said an internal issue such as the impeachment vote would not affect 
the Middle East peace process. ``President Clinton has proven he can 
work on international issues while under internal pressure. We hope 
he can continue to do so,'' Zayyad said. Kuwaiti newspaper columnist 
Ayed al-Manaa, who writes for Al-Watan daily in Kuwait, told The Associated 
Press that the impeachment vote ``stressed the power of the constitutional 
institutions in the developed world _ something we hoped we had in 
ours.'' ``I was very sure the strike in the Gulf would not impede 
the constitutional procedures,'' he said. ``In the West, great achievements 
do not automatically mean that you stay in power.'' In a commentary 
on the attacks on Iraq, the China's Communist Party newspaper People's 
Daily accused Clinton of timing the attacks to ``influence the U.S. 
people, opinion and members of Congress and bring a beneficial change 
to the impeachment case.'' A similar editorial appeared in The Sunday 
Independent of Johannesburg in South Africa. ``Despite his (Clinton's) 
claims that the two events were not linked, it is difficult to see 
how they are separate,'' it said. The South Korean state-run news 
agency, Yonhap, said it was a ``very unhappy day for President Bill 
Clinton and the United States.'' It urged Clinton to apologize for 
his ``lies'' to defuse the political crisis and prevent instability 
not only within the United States, but worldwide. British newspapers 
divided along political lines, with left-wing papers attacking Republicans 
and conservative papers demanding Clinton's resignation and replacement 
by Vice-President Al Gore. ``It's time to show Bill the door and say 
hello to Gore,'' said an editorial in Britain's biggest selling tabloid, 
the News of the World, which is owned by media tycoon Rupert Murdoch. 
The Observer, a left-wing broadsheet, said impeachment was ``a tragedy 
for the U.S. and the world,'' but sympathized with Democrats who believed 
that the vote was ``an attempted constitutional coup d'etat by the 
Republicans.'' A German newspaper lamented the loss of American prestige 
due to the scandal. Calling the impeachment vote ``horrible theater,'' 
the Berliner Morgenpost daily newspaper said in a Sunday editorial 
that the Lewinsky affair had ``poisoned the political climate of the 
United States'' and damaged the country's standing abroad.
