Lillian Hellman was someone people seemed to love or hate (sometimes 
simultaneously), and the latest book about her, ``A Likely Story: 
One Summer With Lillian Hellman'' by Rosemary Mahoney, is one that 
people seem to love or hate, but not simultaneously. Ms. Mahoney, 
37, whose ``Whoredom in Kimmage: The World of Irish Women'' was nominated 
for the National Book Critics Circle Award in 1993, spent two months 
before her senior year in high school working for Hellman; and when 
she wasn't washing dishes or answering the phone, she kept a journal 
about what became a summer from hell at the hands of the great lady 
of American letters. What does she think her former employer would 
make of the fuss the book has caused? Ms. Mahoney smiles. ``She would 
either have completely dismissed it, or she might have said, `I never 
met the girl, never had her in my house.' '' The real point of ``A 
Likely Story,'' however, is not so much the catalog of hurts inflicted 
by the elderly, ailing Hellman, but the kind of teen-ager who would 
take a maid's job thoroughly convinced that a literary icon of the 
20th century was just waiting to be her best friend. A rather typical 
one, it turns out. ``I wanted Lillian Hellman to be perfect because 
I wasn't perfect myself,'' Ms. Mahoney says. ``I really wanted a mentor. 
I wasn't thinking about cleaning her toilet. I thought she'd be my 
friend. That was silly. A recipe for disaster.'' Ms. Mahoney has come 
to New York, where she lived for five years until recently, from her 
new home in Providence, which she finds ``peaceful and inexpensive.'' 
She is eating a curried chicken salad at Hanratty's, a Carnegie Hill 
restaurant she frequented while living in the city. Lean and angular, 
she is one of those people who walk miles each day; and now that she 
lives on Narragansett Bay, she also likes to row. She smiles, and 
her thin cheeks pleat. ``The locals can't see the point of getting 
in a rowboat and going nowhere,'' she says. ``The rest of the time 
I'm at my desk alone, writing, in my pajamas with dirty hair.'' Maybe 
so, though on this day her hair is shiny and clean. Ms. Mahoney is 
a serious-looking woman with pale skin, dressed all in black. She 
carries a brown briefcase somewhat awkwardly, as if it belongs to 
someone's father, and even when seated indoors, holds herself as if 
braced against the wind. But she is open and forthright, and when 
it comes to disclosing the role her own troubled family history plays 
in her book, unflinching. As the youngest of Nona and John Mahoney's 
seven children, she was raised in Milton, Mass. Her mother, a graduate 
of the Columbia School of Journalism and a former women's editor of 
The Boston Post, contracted polio after having her first two children 
and never walked without crutches again. Her husband, a doctor, suffered 
from depression, and following hospitalizations that included shock 
therapy, committed suicide when Rosemary was 8. Her mother told her 
younger children their father died of a heart attack, but as Ms. Mahoney 
writes, her attempts to protect them only added to the confusion and 
shame she instinctively felt about her father's death. ``When people 
called the house asking for him, I didn't say he had died, I said 
he wasn't in,'' she recalls. ``I knew something was wrong, but mental 
illness was not talked about in those days.'' After his death, her 
mother started to drink, though she also earned a second master's 
degree and supported her family by working as an English teacher. 
Rosemary Mahoney won a scholarship to St. Paul's in New Hampshire, 
and the summer before her senior year, her only job prospect was to 
return home and work as a waitress at the local Howard Johnson's, 
where, ``my mother went to drink martinis,'' she writes. ``I pictured 
myself on hot afternoons to come, wearing a hairnet and a prim Howard 
Johnson's uniform, waiting on the table next to my mother's, while 
she talked drunkenly at me across the booth divider. . . . I imagined 
myself putting down a tray of hot dogs and fried clams, untying my 
apron, picking up my mother's gray metal crutches, cold now in the 
air-conditioned dining room, and ending the spectacle by driving her 
safely home from my place of work.'' She sighs. ``People say it was 
so brave of me to write to Lillian Hellman and ask for a job,'' she 
says. ``But it wasn't brave. It was pure pride and desperation.'' 
It was in a high school course called Women in History that Ms. Mahoney 
read Hellman's writing and fell in love. ``Her life,'' she writes, 
``even in its smallest details, meant something; it was guided by 
honesty and courage, while mine seemed fearful and tainted and dishonest 
somehow.'' It is almost too predictable that Ms. Mahoney's idol would 
reveal herself to be so completely imperfect. It is jarring, however, 
at her book's beginning, to read of the author's glee years after 
that summer when she comes upon Hellman's obituary in the papers and 
exults in her death. Certainly, by most accounts, her own included, 
the woman _ off the page _ was cheap, petty, even mean. But isn't 
enough enough? Ms. Mahoney nods gravely. ``I think I reacted that 
way because I was ashamed of how that summer went,'' she says. ``For 
several years after, I couldn't look at my journal. I felt I had failed. 
She was a difficult person, but I blamed myself and I still felt bad 
about it. Now I have a lot more sympathy for her. She was very lonely, 
very unhappy. She could be so abrasive and controlling and domineering, 
but she had this other side that was fearful and very insecure. I 
had gone there hoping to find someone who was better than I was. It's 
why we want idols. We don't want them to be human beings. But we're 
all just people.'' Did it ever occur to her at the time that she could 
have tried flattering Hellman to soften her up a bit? Ms. Mahoney 
shakes her head. ``Once I got in the house I was paralyzed,'' she 
says. ``She could be very frightening and I was intimidated. It got 
to the point where I just decided not to tell anything about myself, 
which was childish. I was very insecure in a lot of ways, though I 
did have a bold side. ``I was a good student, sort of funny and athletic, 
I had friends. But at school I would go back to my room at night totally 
scared. I didn't want anyone to know my mother had a drinking problem. 
She was everything to me, but I felt I had to hide her. That was hard. 
But you can't figure it out when it's happening.'' ``I deliberately 
tried to keep the book from the perspective of a 17-year-old girl,'' 
she continues. ``As a teen-ager I was constantly trying to please 
people, which I guess is true of all adolescents. I tried to recreate 
that feeling of powerlessness, wanting to get away from my family, 
be my own person in the world. ``Though most of the response to the 
book has been good, there are some people who think I'm too hard on 
poor Lillian Hellman. They don't get what the story is really about, 
which is my relationship with my mother. Lillian Hellman is the catalyst 
for the story, the hook it's hung on. But it's about being a teen-ager 
and trying to grow up.'' Part of being a teen-ager, of course, is 
cruelty, especially about physical shortcomings and Ms. Mahoney stints 
on none that she observed. Descriptions of Hellman include her ``big 
beaky face of a sea turtle,'' and breasts like ``bladdery bags.'' 
What she only hints at but does not explore is the range of Hellman's 
own insecurities, which apparently led to inventing herself as the 
heroine of other people's stories, then waltzing away with the credit. 
But those real-world complications were more than a 17-year-old seeker 
of truth and wisdom could be expected to grasp, so Ms. Mahoney sticks 
to the everyday slights of a woman who became more imperious, demanding 
and rude in direct proportion to her declining health, diminishing 
eyesight and diminishing pride. The portrait that emerges finally 
is how alone and pathetic she really was. Couldn't Ms. Mahoney have 
woven a bit of hindsight through the harsher threads of the book, 
not only to give a more balanced picture of the woman she worked for, 
but to save her 17-year-old self from looking like the solipsistic 
brat most 17-year-olds are? She shakes her head impatiently. ``Yes, 
the book is dark in places,'' she says. ``It's not all nice. But I'm 
not doing this to be polite. This is reality. Life isn't all pretty, 
it has an ugly side. I actually embrace that. Our flaws and failings 
make us interesting, I think. And it wasn't just about her. I made 
it clear what a big ego I had. I wasn't at all interested in working. 
I was a bad housekeeper, hasty with everything. ``But your job as 
a writer is to have the emotional truth come out. I know some people 
say I'm nasty and a brat, but this is much more than a revenge book. 
My feeling in general is `Let's stop pretending.' We're just desperate 
for idols, desperate.'' So, once she discovered that her own idol 
was such a letdown, why didn't she quit? ``My mother encouraged me 
not to,'' she says quietly. ``She told me: `People don't like to be 
quitters. You made Lillian Hellman a promise.' Also, I think she had 
a sense that the woman really did need help.'' She thinks a moment. 
``Why did she hire me?'' she asks. ``There was nothing to recommend 
me except that I had read her books. People just didn't want to work 
for her. There had been a whole series of young girls before me. But 
my mother said: `Stick it out. It's a way to learn how to handle yourself 
in difficult situations.' '' Her mother, Ms. Mahoney says, is 75 now 
and is mostly confined to a wheelchair. She no longer drinks. And 
after years of searching for the perfect woman to idolize and coming 
up empty with Lillian Hellman, Ms. Mahoney has been able to recognize 
her own mother's heroism. Despite the book's searing honesty about 
her alcoholism, Nona Mahoney applauds it. When her daughter offered 
to remove anything that might be hurtful, Mrs. Mahoney insisted it 
all stay in. ``She thinks we have a right to talk about our experiences,'' 
Ms. Mahoney says. ``Her attitude is: `I know who I am. They don't 
make me who I am. I do.' She always told me, if you want to avoid 
controversy, say nothing, do nothing, be nothing. You have to stick 
your neck out and just say it, whatever it is. Nothing gets learned 
by hiding things.''
