"Operation desert fox" marked a new era in aerial warfare -- the use 
of precision weapons. Richard Blystone looks at the people aboard 
the "USS enterprise" who helped carry out the campaign. They call 
themselves the "mag rats." It's 2:00 in the morning, but that doesn't 
mean much if you spend your days and nights deep inside the U.S. carrier 
"enterprise," making bombs that pilots will carry deep into Iraq. 
How much sleep have you guys had in two days? Here and there. Hour 
here, hour there. Three hours. Sleep? What's that? no. The raw material, 
a brute 1,000-pound capsule of high explosive, costing maybe $5,000. 
The guidance system costs tens of thousands, and it is the precision 
work of these tired men that turns the two into the precision weapon 
on which U.S. commanders' hopes are fixed. The nose appendage can 
spot where a laser beam, aimed from the air, illuminates a target 
and steer the bomb to the end of that bombardier's rainbow. The guy 
that hit his target. And these will move the controller on that laser 
path. With this, theoretically, you could put a garbage can through 
a Window thousands of feet below. All you need is a laser, and it 
will go exactly where you put it. Signing off on the assembly, one 
way of personalizing this anonymous job. I already autographed a couple 
of them. It has merry Christmas, Saddam. Have a nice day. But they're 
under no illusion that the recipients will ever read it. Some shrapnel, 
everything, all the metal, shrapnel. Who, if anyone, the shrapnel 
hits, they will never know. Watch your bags, there. Richard Blystone, 
CNN, aboard the "USS enterprise" in the gulf.
