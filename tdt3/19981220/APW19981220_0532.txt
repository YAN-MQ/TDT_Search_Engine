The admiral went to the ship's bridge. It was 53 minutes to midnight 
on Wednesday. About 8 miles (13 kms) away, a bright white glow lit 
the sea. Rear Adm. J. Cutler Dawson Jr. watched the fiery trail of 
the first Tomahawk cruise missile carry 1,000 pounds (450 kgs) of 
explosives toward Iraq. The firing from the submarine USS Miami opened 
the barrage. Less than a half hour later, warplanes began streaking 
from the deck of the USS Enterprise. Dawson left the bridge and prepared 
for a long night. He made no announcement to the nearly 5,000 airmen 
and sailors aboard. Everyone had known for hours that the attacks 
would begin. They had been readying for the possibility since the 
Enterprise raced to the Gulf at 31 knots, near its maximum speed. 
In the flight area, the air wing commander, Capt. Tom Hagen, gathered 
pilots to review their targets: suspected weapons sites and facilities 
for Saddam Hussein's prized Republican Guard. More than half the airmen 
had experience in the 1991 Gulf War or monitoring the no-fly zone 
in southern Iraq. These were the men Hagen wanted in the air. ``Opening 
night is not the time for the new folks to go,'' said Hagen of Billings, 
Montana. He told the pilots to make sure they had all their survival 
gear and that their flight suits were ``sanitized'' _ free of all 
names and markings in case they were captured. ``I want you to visualize 
yourself up there, dropping the bombs and coming back safely,'' he 
urged. Hagen watched the pilots closely. He didn't want to see anyone 
too cocky or too calm. ``They should have their game face on,'' he 
said. ``It's focused on what needs to be done.'' The first night was 
an all-Navy barrage. F/A-18 Hornet and F-14 Tomcat warplanes, loaded 
with laser-guided rockets and free-fall bombs, flew runs off the carrier. 
About 200 cruise missiles were launched from the Miami and other vessels 
in the battle group during the first assault _ more than one every 
two minutes until sunrise. Fewer than 300 Tomahawks hit Iraq during 
the entire Gulf War. The last plane arrived back at the carrier about 
5:30 a.m. Military planners decided to wage the attacks in the dark 
to take advantage of night-vision technology and the extra concealment 
it gives warplanes. ``We feel that we own the night,'' Dawson said. 
The following evening, the Iraqis fought back with more firepower. 
The flak from the anti-aircraft batteries was heavier. Pilots also 
began seeing more surface-to-air missiles. Still, there was no sign 
of Iraqi jets challenging the air armada. In Kuwait _ rescued from 
Iraqi occupation in the Gulf War _ British Tornado fighters left their 
base to join the air assault. U.S. Air Force B-52 and B-1 bombers 
also took to the sky. Extra American ground troops arrived in Kuwait. 
Tanker planes, with the capability to refuel jets in mid-air, were 
also sent aloft to allow the fighter-bomber pilots to double the duration 
of their missions, what they call ``events,'' to about three hours. 
``The intensity of the (anti-aircraft fire) is about what we expected,'' 
said Dawson. ``It's not overwhelming in any fashion.'' Cmdr. Kevin 
Miller, leader of an F/A-18 squadron, attributed the heavier second 
night anti-aircraft fire to Iraqi preparations. ``The first night 
we had the element of surprise,'' said Miller of Jacksonville, Florida. 
``They were ready for us the second night.'' About 50 cruise missiles 
were fired from the Enterprise battle group. The cruiser USS Gettysburg, 
which arrived with about 100 Tomahawks, had nearly exhausted its supply. 
Day 3: The adrenaline rush was waning. Most of the crew had only a 
few hours' sleep since the attacks began. Officers watched for signs 
of stress or fatigue. ``If I spot anyone getting giddy, I tell them 
to go to bed,'' said Patrick Lynch of Monroeville, Pennsylvania, the 
aviation ordnance chief who oversees the flow of weaponry from the 
storage bays to the flight deck. Deep in the hull, assembly teams 
raced to keep up with the orders for missiles. A dozen men put together 
a missile in about 10 minutes _ from bracing the tail fins to securing 
the guidance system in the nose. The pace is twice as fast as the 
training runs. Aviation Ordnance 3rd Class Randy Self of Cullman, 
Alabama, was getting by on about 90 minutes of sleep a day. ``We were 
going flat out,'' he said. ``We didn't even know if it was day or 
night.'' The Muslim holy month of Ramadan had begun. Arabs around 
the Middle East intensified protests against the attacks. Syrian demonstrators 
ripped the flag from the U.S. Embassy in Damascus and burned it. Palestinians 
raged against the United States _ just a week after President Bill 
Clinton visited the Gaza Strip and boosted Palestinian efforts for 
self-determination. ``With Ramadan coming, we had a very limited window,'' 
said F/A-18 pilot Lt. Cmdr. Eric Rasmussen of Jacksonville, Florida. 
Saddam claimed hospitals and other civilian sites were hit by the 
airstrikes. On the Enterprise, military experts reviewed the digital 
images from the raids. The video is downloaded into computers before 
being sent for more detailed analysis at Central Command in Tampa, 
Florida. Dawson declined to specify the targets hit, but he insisted 
no sites were near medical centers or other large civilian buildings. 
Pentagon officials announced the airstrike could continue into Ramadan. 
In the Gulf, a second U.S. carrier arrived. The USS Carl Vinson led 
its six-vessel battle group into position. Early Sunday, Dawson received 
a call from the military command for Southwest Asia. Desert Fox was 
over. The last warplane returned to the Vinson about 2 a.m. In total, 
650 U.S. and British attack missions were launched against Iraq _ 
about half from the Enterprise battle group. More than 325 cruise 
missiles were fired from Navy ships, and more than 90 from B-52s. 
No flights were planned for the rest of Sunday. Pilots and others 
caught up on their sleep. Unused bombs were dismantled. At a Roman 
Catholic Mass in the ship's chapel, Rev. Bob Panec offered a prayer 
for the Iraqis ``suffering from the rages of war.'' The daily flight 
schedule always features a cartoon on the back. Sunday's drawing was 
a caricature of Saddam running from a shower of rockets. The caption 
read: ``It was fun while it lasted.''
