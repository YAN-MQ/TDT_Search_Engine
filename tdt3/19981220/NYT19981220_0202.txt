WASHINGTON _ ``Your representative owes you, not his industry only, 
but his judgment; and he betrays, instead of serving you, if he sacrifices 
it to your opinion.'' _ Edmund Burke to the voters of Bristol, 1774 
In the teeth of polls showing a strong national majority disfavoring 
impeachment, House Republicans and a handful of Democrats carved their 
own profile in history by indicting the president. On the same day, 
in the face of polls showing a rising tide of scandal-weary Americans 
favoring his resignation _ and despite an invitation by an embarrassed 
speaker-designate to lead him out the door _ President Clinton reiterated 
his determination to serve until the last hour of his term. Neither 
the House's action nor Clinton's shows contempt for public opinion. 
Representative democracy, as expressed by Burke, requires elected 
officials to exercise their judgment in the best interest of the nation. 
The people choose leaders, not agents. Clinton learned the hard way 
that polls are no substitute for judgment. After his Lewinsky testimony 
in the Jones lawsuit became public a year ago, he commissioned a poll 
from Dick Morris to tell him if he should confess or continue to lie. 
The $2,000 poll (never billed) reported that the public would accept 
adultery but not perjury. That's when he decided to try to ``win.'' 
But the poll's prediction was disastrously mistaken. Perjury about 
adultery, as we now see, turned out to be surprisingly tolerable to 
most people. Had Clinton ignored Morris' poll and erased his perjury 
with the truth, he would have been embarrassed then but unimpeached 
today. What nailed him was not the sex but the unnecessary cover-up. 
Where to from here? The pursuers of the president have won their battle 
of principle against lock-step partisan opposition and shown that 
no president is above the law. That huge black headline _ ``Clinton 
Impeached'' _ is his claim to infamy. That is the indelible censure, 
and its inherent punishment fits the crime. Churchill's advice to 
winners now comes to mind: ``In victory, magnanimity.'' Here is where 
a representative's decent respect for the opinion of the electorate 
comes in. With no overwhelming support for removal apparent, impeachment 
should almost be censure enough. In a ``Meet the Press'' greenroom 
a couple of weeks ago, the Senate majority leader, Trent Lott, told 
me that a Senate trial need take no longer than a few days to three 
weeks, and repeated as much on the air. From that I deduced and wrote 
that the leadership had in mind a short trial _ not a fight to the 
finish that would lead to the ``horror'' and ``national paralysis'' 
for six months or more with which the Clinton defenders were scaring 
House members. Having put out that assurance before impeachment, Senate 
leaders now have the obligation to bring about that closure with all 
convenient speed. Unfortunately, Clinton is not helping. He apparently 
recalls another part of the Churchill quote _ ``in defeat, defiance'' 
_ and in his post-impeachment pep rally showed no sense of the constitutional 
occasion. Instead he staged a Democratic love-in to signal that he 
considered this vote (1) was merely the act of rabid partisans engaged 
in ``personal destruction'' and (2) was not bothering him a bit. Senators 
should set aside this self-deluding reaction and start the trial promptly. 
After a week of opening arguments and submission of briefs (and barring 
any New Year bombshells from the Cox Chinagate committee or elsewhere), 
a majority of senators should move to direct the chief justice to 
halt the proceedings, which the Constitution expressly permits. That's 
the proper moment for a joint resolution of censure. A simple condemnation 
for lying under oath and tampering with witnesses would suffice. As 
a sweetener, Congress could express its wish that the signed resolution 
not be entered as evidence in any criminal trial. It would go to the 
president for signature. If he balks, the Senate trial resumes. But 
he'll sign and get to keep the pen. Its auction price will pay his 
staff's legal debts. From then to the end of his term, no humiliation 
imposed nor contrition expected. At the State of the Union address, 
which can await this resolution, those who voted for impeachment should 
rise with those who voted against to applaud the office if not the 
man.
