Among those supporting the president, the man who would replace him. 
Vice President Gore says the impeachment vote is a great disservice 
to a Man he says will be regarded as one of the nation's great presidents. 
I feel extremely privileged to have been able to serve with him as 
his partner for the past six years. And I look forward to serving 
with him for the next two years. I have seen him close at hand day 
after day making the most important decisions about peace, prosperity 
and our future. And making them always by asking what is right for 
the American people? What is right for all of the American people?
