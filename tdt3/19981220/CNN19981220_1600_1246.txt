Matt Yallof, "CNN Headline Sports." We know the Dallas Cowboys have 
locked up a postseason spot, but a win today -- or an Arizona loss 
-- would give them the NFC east crown. But the boys are slumping, 
having lost three in a row, and without Deion sanders for a fourth 
straight game, Dallas must turn things around. A victory against lowly 
Philadelphia would be a good place to start their comeback. Everybody's 
starting to press a little bit. I hope they're doing it in a positive 
way. We need a win bad. I don't care who it's against. It's not any 
one particular thing. It's a breakdown here or there. A different 
position. And offensively, when you have that, then it stalls drives 
and keeps you from doing the things that you want to do, and that's 
been the case for us here the last two weeks. There's a lot of room 
for improvement. Not just in the running game, but in every aspect 
of this team.
