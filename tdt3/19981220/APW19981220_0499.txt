The International Olympic Committee will likely find a new way to 
select host cities for the Summer and Winter Games as a result of 
the widening bribery scandal, according to its powerful president, 
Juan Antonio Samaranch. ``After this scandal, I believe that the IOC 
as a whole must accept that the system needs to change and that we 
can't continue like this,'' Samaranch said in an interview with the 
Le Matin newspaper Sunday. ``We are not happy with the way of selecting 
organizing cities for the games,'' he was quoted as saying. The IOC 
has been shaken to its core by allegations of rampant corruption and 
vote-buying masterminded by crooked agents. A top IOC member, Switzerland's 
Marc Holder, has estimated that 5-7 percent of the 115 members are 
open to bribery. Samaranch said the Olympic movement should aim to 
follow the example of other big sports bodies, which leave major decisions 
to their executive committees rather than the full membership. He 
told Le Matin he had proposed this several times. ``But it's not easy 
to ask members to agree to cut off their own heads,'' he said in the 
two page interview. But given the circumstances, he said it was possible 
that the IOC members give the 11-member executive committee special 
powers, he said. Samaranch said the investigation into wrongdoings 
by Salt Lake City, the host for the 2002 Winter Games, should be completed 
by Jan. 23 and would be discussed at a meeting that day. Salt Lake 
City organizers have admitted to using a dlrs 400,000 scholarship 
fund to let IOC members' families study _ but have said this was a 
humanitarian gesture rather than bribery. There is growing evidence 
of other favors for IOC members, including free medical care and gifts 
in excess of the IOC imposed limit. Many of the allegations focus 
on IOC members from Africa, particularly those from the Congo, Libya 
and Swaziland. Samaranch told the newspaper that the bombshell about 
misdemeanors concerning Salt Lake City had come to him only as a ``semi-surprise.'' 
Even prior to that, senior Olympic officials had doubts that some 
members' behavior was at the ``limit.'' ``We are going to react in 
a strong way and clean up,'' he said. IOC members found guilt of corruption 
will be kicked out of the exclusive club, he said. Under Samaranch 
the Olympic Games have become one of the world's biggest money-spinning 
events. For instance, television rights for the Moscow Olympics in 
1980 were dlrs 100 million. For the Athens games in 2004 they will 
be dlrs 1.4 billion. As the Games have grown, so has the scope for 
abuse. Samaranch indicated that the new selection procedure might 
be in place by next summer, when the choice is made on the host for 
the 2006 Winter Olympics. If successful, the same system would be 
used for the 2008 Games decision, he said. The Swiss city of Sion, 
which lost out to Salt Lake City for 2002, is widely considered the 
front-runner for the 2006 Games. Hodler, a former head of the International 
Ski Federation, is on the Sion organizing committee But there is growing 
concern that by provoking the IOC's biggest ever scandal, Hodler may 
prompt a loss of support for the Swiss bid. In an interview with the 
SonntagsZeitung newspaper, Swiss Sports Minister Adolf Ogi resisted 
demands for Hodler to distance himself from the Sion bid. ``Out of 
the question,'' said Ogi. Ogi also said that the selection procedure 
needed changing so that just the executive committee or evaluation 
committee decided rather than the entire membership.
