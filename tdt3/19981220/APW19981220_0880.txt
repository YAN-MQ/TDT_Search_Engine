The federal attorney general's office has angrily denied reports that 
it seized several hotels and that its own top agent in Cancun was 
under investigation. ``It is the falsehood of all falsehoods that 
the attorney general's office has seized the Palace Resort hotel group,'' 
the agency said, reacting to newspaper reports on Sunday. ``There 
have not even been police or prosecution investigations in that hotel 
group,'' the agency said. Local newspapers have reported on a widening 
probe of drug trafficking in the Cancun area and Quintana Roo state, 
and of complaints by hotel operators about the effect on tourism. 
The agency denounced ``a cynical campaign which tries to denigrate 
the actions of the federal prosecutor, as well as to misinform and 
confuse public opinion'' about drug-fighting efforts in the state. 
It denied that it was investigating its top official in Quintana Roo, 
Jorge Pena Sandoval, army Gen. Gaston Menchaca or several other people 
mentioned in newspaper reports. The agency did, however, that it had 
seized several other hotels on suspicion of money laundering, as well 
as a security company. It also has said it has detained several people 
for questioning. The daily La Jornada on Sunday reported that the 
Palace Resort group of hotels had been seized and claimed that Menchaca 
and a number of officials in Cancun were being questioned. The investigation 
has alarmed Cancun hotel operators, who have complained that it could 
soil the image of the tourist resort. Law enforcement officials say 
that drug smugglers have increasingly tried to use Quintana Roo's 
beaches as a corridor for narcotics and have publicly acknowledged 
investigating drug-related money laundering there. Quintana Roo Gov. 
Mario Villanueva has denied that drug trafficking is a major problem.
