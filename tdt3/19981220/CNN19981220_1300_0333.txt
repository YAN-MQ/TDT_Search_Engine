Dennis Hastert says he never sought to be house speaker, but it's 
his duty to serve if his colleagues choose him. House republicans, 
including majority whip Tom DeLay, are declaring support for the Illinois 
representative after Bob Livingston's decision to leave congress. 
Livingston yesterday announced he would resign and urged President 
Clinton to do the same. His decision came days after he admitted to 
extramarital affairs during his marriage. Sources tell CNN house republicans 
will gather January 6th to choose their next speaker candidate.
