In the latest of a wave of attacks on business owners, police reported 
Sunday that robbers killed a married couple as they locked up their 
general store in eastern Guyana. The killing Saturday night came three 
days after President Janet Jagan's government ordered troops into 
the streets to help police stem the crime wave. Robbers shot and killed 
Mohamed Shaheed Kassim and his wife Dora, both believed to be in their 
40s, as they were closing their general store in Berbice County. Investigators 
said there were few witnesses because of a blackout at the time. Four 
business owners have been killed and one wounded in the last two weeks 
in Georgetown, the capital. Police are blaming the attacks on heavily 
armed groups of muggers. Business leaders are warning the increase 
in robberies could scare foreign businesses from Guyana, which is 
still trying to lure back investors following racially charged riots 
earlier this year.
