RIO DE JANEIRO, Brazil (AP) - Cruzeiro and Corinthians tied for the 
second straight playoff game of the 1998 Brazilian soccer championship 
Sunday before 60,000 screaming fans at Sao Paulo's Morumbi stadium. 
A third and deciding game will be played Wednesday. In the first half, 
the Corinthians kept up a relentless attack but were stopped by tenacious 
defense and several spectacular goals by Cruzeiro goalie Dida. Also 
in the first half, a television replay showed a referee erred when 
he called an off sides after a goal by Corinthian's Freddy Rincon. 
Minutes later, Corinthian defender Gilmar was carried off the field 
with a leg injury and is expected to miss Wednesday's decisive game 
In the second half, Corinthian's Marcelinho opened the scoring by 
tapping in a goal in front of the net in the 59th minute. It was his 
18th goal in the championship series and it caused the partisan crowd 
to dance and chant in unison. In the 70th minute, the crowd went silent 
after Cruzeiro finally scored when defender Marcelo Djian made a brilliant 
pass to Marcelo Ramos, who kicked the ball into the net past Corinthian 
goalie Nei. On Wednesday, the two teams will play for the title at 
Morumbi stadium. Last Sunday, they tied 2-2 at Belo Horizonte's Minerao 
stadium. The Corinthians can win the title with a tie in the next 
game because of a better won-loss record during the championship series. 
For Cruzeiro, they would need a win.
