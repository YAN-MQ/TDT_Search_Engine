Paul Gitlin, a lawyer and literary agent who brokered multimillion-dollar 
deals for authors in the early 1970s, died Dec. 16. He was 83. Gitlin 
came to prominence by negotiating innovative deals in the 1960s and 
early 1970s, when literary auctions were a relatively new phenomenon 
and authors' lawyers and agents were becoming stars in their own right. 
Gruff and charming, Gitlin was credited by novelist Irving Wallace 
with winning the author a $2.3 million, four-book contract in 1972. 
But his role in reshaping the economics of the book industry began 
at least as early as 1960, when he designed the first combined hardcover-paperback 
deal by selling Pocket Books ``The Carpetbaggers,'' by Harold Robbins. 
In addition to Wallace and Robbins, Gitlin's clients included Bill 
Bradley, Sidney Sheldon, Barbara Taylor Bradford, Cornelius Ryan and 
William Saroyan. He also represented the estates of such prominent 
American authors as Thomas Wolfe, Upton Sinclair, Sinclair Lewis, 
Ayn Rand and Raymond Chandler. Born June 17, 1915, in Brooklyn, Gitlin 
was a specialist in copyright law. In 1938, in his last year at Harvard 
Law School, he was the first winner of the ASCAP Nathan Burkan Memorial 
award for his essay on how copyright law should apply to radio broadcasts. 
He was a past president of the Copyright Society of the U.S.A. and 
a partner in the publishing law firm of Ernst, Cane, Berner &AMP; 
Gitlin, which represented, among other clients, the novelist Mario 
Puzo. He also helped found the Walter Derenberg Copyright Library 
at the New York University Law School. He is survived by his son, 
Jonathan, of Manhattan, and a sister, Claire Gnessin, of Syosset, 
N.Y.
