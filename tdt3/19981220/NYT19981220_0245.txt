In 1973, Jacob Gubbay, a Jew from India, placed a tiny classified 
advertisement in The Village Voice that read ``Gay Synagogue: Friday 
Night Service.'' Ten people turned up at the Church of the Holy Apostles 
at Ninth Avenue and West 28th Street. A year later, Gubbay moved to 
Australia, but what he left behind _ the foundation of Congregation 
Beth Simchat Torah, the first and still the only synagogue for gay 
people in New York _ has expanded and thrived against a backdrop of 
social change. As it celebrates its 25th anniversary this year, the 
congregation has grown so large that for Friday evening services _ 
the most heavily attended of the week _ it has had to move out of 
its new quarters nearby and back to its original site at the church. 
Last week, in a joyous ceremony, members carried Torahs into the church 
to celebrate their return to a former home. The move is not intended 
to be permanent. The congregation's leadership is beginning discussions 
this month on a capital campaign so it can buy or build its own synagogue. 
The congregation has about 800 dues-paying members and hundreds more 
who regularly attend services, classes and concerts. For the High 
Holidays, it moves to the Javits Convention Center to accommodate 
the 3,000 or more people who come to pray. ``It is interesting to 
think of what the world was like 25 years ago,'' said the congregation's 
rabbi, Sharon Kleinbaum, who was hired in 1992 after 19 years of lay 
leadership. ``There were no gay rights organizations, no lesbian or 
gay community services, no Gay Men's Health Crisis. AIDS was not recognized 
until 1981. Not one national Jewish organization supported gay rights 
nor did any synagogue welcome gay people on an official basis. ``At 
a time when religion was often the place where people were most deeply 
rejected, a small group came together with the radical idea that it 
was possible to live both openly gay and proudly Jewish,'' she continued. 
``There was no model for that and what those people did was as heroic 
as immigrants leaving the old country.'' One sign of mainstream Jewry's 
increasing acceptance of the synagogue came this year when the Jewish 
Continuity Foundation of the UJA-Federation of New York gave it a 
four-year, $168,000 grant to expand its educational efforts. The first 
year's funds were used to establish a Lehrhaus (House of Learning), 
which has 18 faculty members and offers courses for adults in topics 
from Talmud and Hebrew to ``Biblical Perspectives on Coming Out.'' 
A children's program is planned for next year. ``This is one of the 
big changes since 1973,'' Kleinbaum said. ``No one in the original 
group could have imagined that we would be exploring the question 
of Sunday school, but there is a baby boom going on now among gays 
and lesbians. People are giving birth to children, they are adopting 
or they have children from previous heterosexual relationships.'' 
Kleinbaum herself is bringing up two daughters with her partner. But 
despite the synagogue's growing stature, its leaders have steadfastly 
resisted applying for formal affiliation with any of the branches 
of Judaism, preferring to attract worshippers with Reform, Reconstructionist, 
Conservative and even Orthodox backgrounds. The response to the synagogue 
within Judaism falls along predictable lines _ the Orthodox branch 
rejects it outright, the Conservative accepts gay worshippers but 
not gay rabbis, and the Reform and Reconstructionist offer unqualified 
approval. Though many gay people attend mainstream synagogues, members 
of Congregation Beth Simchat Torah say they could not duplicate in 
other congregations the bonds they have with their fellow worshippers 
and their rabbi. Take, for example, the case of Mark Janover, whose 
partner, Clinton Wilding Smith, bought him a membership before dying 
of AIDS three years ago. Janover found Kleinbaum to be a source of 
steadfast support. ``She was at my house the night he died, and the 
next morning showed up to get things set up and determined what I 
wanted to do,'' he said. ``She called my father and my aunt and told 
my sisters to come to Friday services with me to say Kaddish,'' the 
Jewish mourning prayer, he said. In his loss, Janover said, his connections 
deepened. ``There are not a lot of other places to get validation 
as an AIDS widow,'' he said. Two weeks after Smith died, Kleinbaum 
gave Janover an assignment: ``Somebody's partner just died, and she 
wanted me to give him comfort,'' he recalled. ``I said, `Rabbi, my 
Clinton is barely cold,' to which she responded: `Mark, you know a 
week's worth more about grief. You could help him and lead the way.''' 
Now Janover, who has AIDS himself, leads a committee of 75 people 
who visit the sick. When he was hospitalized with dementia, he said: 
``I would call people at 3 a.m. and they came. I wouldn't be alive 
today if not for the love and support of that community.'' Rita Fisher, 
who was stunned when her son Jay announced 14 years ago that he was 
gay, found herself marching up the aisle for a double ceremony in 
1993: renewal of her vows with her husband, Alex, who has since died, 
and a commitment ceremony for her son and his partner, Michael Lehrman. 
``Whoever dreamed, in my wildest dreams, that I would walk my child 
down that aisle,'' she said. Now she is a maternal pillar of the community, 
commonly known as Mamacita Rita.
