Now that U.S.-British airstrikes against Iraq are over, America's 
European partners are looking to U.N. chief Kofi Annan to find a way 
to maintain arms controls against Baghdad. ``We trust that a political 
dialogue can be undertaken as soon as possible, primarily with the 
involvement of U.N. Secretary-General Kofi Annan,'' Austrian Chancellor 
Viktor Klima said after U.S. President Bill Clinton and British Prime 
Minister Tony Blair announced an end to the airstrikes. Austria currently 
holds the rotating presidency of the 15-member European Union. Austria's 
foreign minister, Wolfgang Schuessel, said the focus should be on 
a ``long-term political solution'' to ensure that Iraq complies with 
U.N. orders to destroy all long-range missiles and mass destruction 
weapons. Schuessel said such a political solution must ``bring to 
an end the humanitarian suffering of the Iraqi people'' and restore 
cooperation between Baghdad and the United Nations. The challenge 
facing Annan, however, would be to find a formula for maintaining 
arms controls against Iraq that would satisfy both President Saddam 
Hussein's government and the United States and Britain. Washington 
and London have traditionally taken the strongest positions within 
the U.N. Security Council in refusing to relax sweeping economic sanctions 
until U.N. inspectors certify that Baghdad has destroyed all its long-range 
missiles and weapons of mass destruction. That is the main condition 
before the U.N. Security Council will lift sanctions imposed in 1990 
after Saddam invaded Kuwait, touching off the 1991 Gulf War. On Saturday, 
Iraq's vice president, Taha Yassin Ramadan, made clear that his government 
will no longer work with inspectors from the U.N. Special Commission, 
or UNSCOM. Claims by U.N. chief inspector Richard Butler that Iraq 
was not cooperating fully with his teams led to the four days of airstrikes. 
French President Jacques Chirac said France, a permanent Security 
Council member, would support a ``new organization, new methods'' 
so that the United Nations could maintain ``effective control on Iraqi 
weapons and their eventual development.'' France's foreign minister, 
Hubert Vedrine, said French diplomats were already working on proposals 
for ``a new form of cooperation between the United Nations and Iraq 
to restore the role of the U.N. Security Council.'' Vedrine gave no 
details, and it was unclear whether those proposals would be acceptable 
to the United States. Any new formula must win the approval of each 
of the five permanent Security Council members _ the United States, 
Russia, China, France and Britain. In Bonn, German Foreign Minister 
Joschka Fischer also called Sunday for a new initiative to maintain 
arms control and to ``improve the conditions of the Iraqi people.'' 
German defense minister, Rudolf Scharping, said Russia should also 
play a role in reviving ``a political dialogue (with Iraq) as soon 
as possible.''
