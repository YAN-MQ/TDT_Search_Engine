When skiers arrive in Vail, Colorado, for the world championships 
in five weeks, American hopes will be riding on one pair of skis: 
Kristina Koznick's. Koznick added to those expectations on Sunday, 
when she reached the World Cup podium for the first time this season 
with a second place finish in a slalom. The result also added to the 
pressure on her as the United States' one legitimate hope at the worlds, 
which they will host starting Jan. 30. With the American ski team 
decimated by injury and retirements, Koznick is the only skier on 
the team _ men and women _ to have stepped onto a World Cup podium. 
Koznick struggled at home during early season races in Park City, 
Utah, and Mammoth Mountain, California, finishing 15th and 27th. But 
on Sunday, Karin Roten showed the American what home advantage can 
do, giving the Swiss women their first win in almost two years. Like 
Roten, Koznick will hope to ride the emotional wave provided by her 
countrymen instead of letting it drown her. ``In Park City and Mammoth 
Mountain, I put a lot of pressure on myself after doing so well last 
year,'' said Koznick, who recorded four podium finishes _ including 
her first career win in Are, Sweden _ and finished second in the World 
Cup slalom standings last season. ``Being at home, even if skiing 
there is not a big deal, also added to the pressure,'' she said. ``But 
maybe that was good practice for the world championships.'' While 
she realizes there are high hopes for her at Vail, world championship 
gold is not Koznick's ultimate target. Though she admits a world title 
would nicely flush out her resume, it is the slalom World Cup crown 
that Koznick covets most. ``Of course I want to be at the top of the 
podium in Vail in front of a home crowd,'' said Koznick, 23, a native 
of Burnsville, Minnesota. ``But my main goal this season is the World 
Cup slalom title, which is more meaningful. ``To win a world championship 
title you just need to be great on one day,'' explained Koznick, currently 
eighth in the slalom standings. ``To be a World Cup champion you have 
to be consistent and strong throughout the entire season. That determines 
who's really the best.'' Having finished second in the World Cup slalom 
last season with just one victory, Koznick's more immediate goal is 
to win a pair of races this campaign. ``I'm capable of doing it,'' 
said Koznick. ``I need to be consistent but I also need wins to come 
out on top.'' The slalom event this season is wide open. At this time 
last year Ylva Nowen of Sweden was putting the finishing touches on 
a four-race winning streak that carried her to the World Cup slalom 
title. This season, three races have produced three different winners, 
with 17-year-old World Cup rookie Anja Paerson of Sweden taking the 
early lead in the standings on the strength of two podium finishes 
_ a win in Mammoth and a third in Sunday's race. Reigning world champion 
Deborah Compagnoni of Italy is far from top form, with just one second 
place to show for her efforts this year. She went out early in the 
slalom in Switzerland this weekend. Urska Hrovat, a bronze medallist 
at the last worlds, claimed the season opening slalom in Park City, 
but since then has only cracked the top-10 once. The Olympic slalom 
gold medallist Hilde Gerg of Germany sits in 34th in the rankings, 
having yet to post a top-20 finish.
