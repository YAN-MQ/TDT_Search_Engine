Bill Parcells, that old softie, wiped his eyes, celebrated with a 
chicken pot pie for a late-night supper and then went to bed Saturday, 
having taken his third National Football League team to a division 
title. And why not allow a bit of a smile _ even tears _ in the locker 
room where the Jets were celebrating their 17-10 victory over the 
Buffalo Bills, having become American Football Conference East champions 
after having won only one game only two seasons ago. And they did 
it in Parcells' second season with memories remaining among the players 
of the 1996 team that went 1-15, a season when fans who spelled out 
J-E-T-S claimed it stood for ``Just End the Season.'' Equally impressive, 
the Jets had a chance to secure a first-round bye Sunday night if 
Jacksonville lost at Minnesota. In any event, Parcells said, it would 
not alter his decision on his starters in the regular-season finale 
next Sunday against the New England Patriots at Giants Stadium. ``You 
want your team to be playing well as you go,'' Parcells said Sunday, 
after having had only about four hours' sleep, his norm for the night 
after a game. ``I've noticed with a lot of teams trying to rest their 
players at the end of the year, it never seems to work out. I've seen 
teams do that and get eliminated.'' But Parcells was not all business 
Sunday. He was uncharacteristically reflective. ``You know, this is 
a team that initially I was a little more distant from because a lot 
of the players weren't sure how to take me and didn't want to cross 
my path, just be inconspicuous,'' he said. ``Now I think it's different. 
They've been around me, the guys I inherited and some of the new ones; 
they know what to expect.'' He thought about the holdovers from 1996, 
when the Jets completed a two-season run of 4-28 with Rich Kotite 
as the coach. Not many are left _ less than a third of the team. ``The 
1-15 guys, those are the guys that said, `OK, we're just going to 
blindly follow and hope we'll just get there,' '' Parcells said. ``There's 
a lot of days in the weight room when you say: `Why are we doing this? 
Isn't there a better way or an easier way?' '' But, as with the Giants 
and with New England, there is only the Parcells way. And on the Jets, 
he has the total control and unquestionable authority handed down 
from the owner, Leon Hess. ``I know there's only one way to do it,'' 
Parcells said. ``Now I think I've become a little more flexible as 
I've gotten older, but I don't think I've ever been a guy to take 
pressure off my team. Pepper said you've got to be a certain kind 
of guy to take it and that's what I believe. It's what I've been taught; 
it's the way I know.'' Pepper Johnson is one of his Giants guys, like 
Curtis Martin is one of his Patriots guys. But now, somehow, they 
are all his Jets guys. ``I said to Victor Green: `So what do you like 
better, Vic? Which way is better?' '' Green, a Jet since 1993, did 
not have to answer. It was, of course, a rhetorical question. ``When 
you saw those players,'' Parcells said of the emotional locker-room 
scene, ``you know the game isn't about money. It's about achievement.'' 
The Jets have done what he believes good teams are supposed to do. 
Indeed, the Jets now fit his definition of a good team. They have 
won in the clutch, on the road. In getting to this point, the Jets 
won three road games against their leading division rivals and had 
to produce second-half surges to win. They were tied going into the 
third quarter against the Bills, they trailed the Dolphins the Sunday 
before in Miami and earlier this season they had fallen behind at 
New England in a Monday night game. ``I feel pretty good about being 
able to win on the road,'' Parcells said. ``A team has to have those 
attributes before being any good. What makes me feel good is going 
to Miami, a real big game, a national game, their crowd in it and 
the Jets do well. Now another national game, we've got to go to Buffalo. 
That's a good sign for a team. We didn't play great football Saturday, 
but we played just to do enough. That's why you win the division.'' 
These are among the accomplishments that have eluded so many other 
Jets teams: Three straight victories in December for the first time 
since 1979. A winning record on the road for only the second time 
in the 1990's. A five-game winning streak in the second half of the 
season for the first time since 1981. ``I think I go on the field 
now without worrying about what's being said,'' Parcells said. ``I 
think we laugh a little more now. I think they understand my personality, 
which can be volatile.'' He spent the rest of Sunday worrying about 
Christmas, what time the players will get off on Christmas Eve. He 
gave them off Sunday and Monday, and will hold practice tomorrow. 
The 57-year-old coach repeated another favorite motto: ``I keep saying 
I'm too old to lose.'' ``Not too many players understand that,'' Parcells 
said. ``But some of my players understand it. I understand it. It 
takes too much out of me. When you win, it makes it all worthwhile.'' 
So he is hardly worried that his team _ finally, his team _ gets what 
he is driving at. He was asked if is concerned about how hard they 
will play against the Patriots. ''I don't think I'll have to stress 
it that much,'' he said.
