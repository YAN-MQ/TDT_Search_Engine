Outlining a strategy of containing Saddam Hussein, British Prime Minister 
Tony Blair said Sunday that the U.S.-British attacks on the Iraqi 
dictator have made the world safer and set back his military machine 
by years. ``We have severely damaged Saddam's ability to produce and 
repair ballistic missiles. We have severely set back his chemical, 
biological and unmanned drone programs,'' Blair told a news conference 
Sunday. ``His air defense radar, control centers and communication 
facilities in southern Iraq have been severely damaged and will take 
years to replace.'' ``Saddam is weaker now than he was before we started. 
His neighbors, the region, and therefore the world, are safer as a 
result,'' Blair said. But, he said, the two nations remain ready to 
attack again if necessary. Part of the containment strategy involves 
maintaining the threat of force and Britain is to send another aircraft 
carrier, H.M.S. Invincible, to the region to that end, Blair said. 
The containment strategy would also include tougher enforcement of 
U.N. sanctions against Iraq and Britain would be discussing ways in 
which an effective weapons inspection program could resume in Iraq 
without ``the previous cat and mouse game,'' he said. Blair rejected 
the argument that the only worthwhile mission would have been to topple 
Saddam, something he said would involve thousands of Allied troops 
in a land war. ``Just because we can't get into the cage and strike 
him down, it doesn't mean we should leave the cage untouched and the 
bars too fragile to hold him,'' Blair said. ``What we have done is 
to put him back firmly in the cage and secure it.'' Allied tacticians 
aimed to disable the sprawling armed forces which keep the dictator 
in power by raining down laser-guided munitions and cruise missiles 
over a 70 hour period on four key sections of the Iraqi military, 
Gen. Sir Charles Guthrie, chief of the defense staff, told the news 
conference. ``I think that Saddam Hussein made a great miscalculation,'' 
Guthrie said. ``I believe that he thought that America might have 
been preoccupied in other business and he might well have thought 
that we would not do anything because of the approach of Ramadan and 
he miscalculated.'' Blair said he found ``utterly grotesque and offensive, 
not just to President (Bill) Clinton, but to me,'' any suggestions 
that the timing of the assault was designed to divert attention away 
from Clinton's impeachment toubles. Delaying an attack until after 
the impeachment vote would have coincided with Rammadan, the holy 
Muslim holiday, and waiting until after the month-long fast was over 
would have given Saddam five weeks to prepare. The bombing campaign 
involved more than 400 cruise missiles, more than were used during 
the 1991 Gulf War, and 200 aircraft strikes, Blair said. A total of 
93 Iraqi targets were hit during the four day assault, Guthrie said. 
He said those included 30 chemical, biological and nuclear weapons 
sites, including a missile repair factory on the edge of Baghdad and 
a hardened bunker at the Tallil airfield in southern Iraq, containing 
robot drones designed to spray anthrax. Also targeted were 33 air 
defence sites, including six airfields, vital to sheltering the Republican 
Guard, and secret ballistic missile installations. A total of 20 command 
centers were hit, as well as 10 Republican Guard barracks and installations. 
``We have sent a powerful message to the Republican Guard which Saddam 
kept out of harm's way during the Gulf War,'' Guthrie said. ``They 
know now they can no longer hide. We have got the ability to reach 
out and strike them.'' The general said the missions had been planned 
meticulously to inflict maximum damage on the Saddam's regime while 
avoiding harm to civilians. The objective had been to disable key 
parts of the Iraqi armed forces and so render Saddam's one million 
strong army useless, Guthrie said. ``The plan was in effect simple,'' 
he said. ``Just as a car is made useless with the engine electronics 
removed, so Saddam's military machine cannot function without a few 
key elements.'' The United States and Britain decided to attack Iraq 
after the U.N. Special Commission reported last week that Saddam's 
regime had failed to cooperate fully with its arms inspectors. The 
two nations say that Saddam has tried to produce weapons of mass destruction, 
and has used them against his neighbors.
