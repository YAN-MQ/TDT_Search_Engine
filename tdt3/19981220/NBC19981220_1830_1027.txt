In "focus" this evening -- cracking down on those who use illegal 
means to acquire legal drugs. NBC's Dan Lothian has our report. San 
Diego form cyst99 cysts have what patients need and what addicts crave, 
prescription drugs, so desirable that some people commit fraud to 
get them. It is against the law. And they have to be flagged to let 
them know it's not okay. And catching the criminal is a major challenge. 
But San Diego police detectives targets those cases. He's a one-man 
unit and his secret weapon is a fax machine. Usually the people are 
not sophisticated criminally. They're regular folks like us that have 
to get the drugs. So he exiles a list based on tips, accomplishes 
a profile and faxes off a flier. There a company acts as a clearinghouse 
relaying the profile 300 San Diego pharmacies clinics, doctor offices 
and hospitals. If somebody walks up to the window and the pharmacist 
has the fax they can call the police. This woman got such a call. 
She responded to a nearby farm zi and arrested a man. He looked like 
a doctor, but he wasn't. The drug he wanted, vike den, a pain medication. 
Police say abusers often become dependent on drugs they mirs took 
because of illness or injury. They've become addicted to it. And when 
the doctor stops prescribing the drug to them, they go trying to get 
the drug through illegal means. Each year, investigators arrest 50 
to 60 people trying to obtain drugs illegally. Sometimes the suspects 
are familiar, arrested time and time again for the same thing. It's 
not a major problem, nor is it unique to San Diego. But the police 
here decided to aggressively address it. And so far this effort to 
fight prescription fraud appears to be working. Dan Lothian, NBC news, 
San Diego.
