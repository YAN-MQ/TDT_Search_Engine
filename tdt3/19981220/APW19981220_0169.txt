An Israeli injured in an explosion at a gate of Jerusalem's walled 
Old City was detained Sunday by police who suspected him of attempting 
to harm Arabs. The man was brought to a Jerusalem hospital early Sunday 
morning with wounds to his hand and was held for questioning, police 
spokeswoman Linda Menuhin said. Israel's army radio speculated that 
the suspect was trying to plant the bomb in the Old City's Muslim 
quarter when it exploded at the New Gate. The radio said that police 
believe the man may be responsible for seven stabbing attacks on Palestinians 
in Jerusalem in the last year. Two of the Palestinians were killed 
and five were injured in the attacks. Police believe an Israeli Jewish 
nationalist seeking revenge for attacks by Palestinians on Israelis 
carried out the attacks. Most of, 6th graf pvs.
