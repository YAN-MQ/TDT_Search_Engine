Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu made a last-ditch effort on Sunday 
to garner support for his hawkish peace policies, while his opponents 
on the left and right prepared to face him in new elections. The prime 
minister is slated to ask the Parliament in a vote Monday to support 
conditions he has demanded of the Palestinians before Israel carries 
out another troop withdrawal from parts of the West Bank, according 
to the U.S.-brokered Wye River peace accords. If he does not succeed 
_ a near certainty _ he has said he will go to early elections. Netanyahu's 
Cabinet on Sunday approved his conditions for resuming Israel's compliance 
with the accords. Netanyahu says the conditions are necessary because 
the Palestinians have not met their obligations according to Wye. 
The conditions, published by Netanyahu's office, include: _The collection 
of illegally-held weapons; _A renunciation by the Palestinian leadership 
the intention to declare unilaterally a Palestinian state by May, 
and of claims on Jerusalem as the capital of such a state; _Recognition 
that Israel never promised to release prisoners jailed for killing; 
_A stop to violence and incitement to violence. A fifth condition 
reported by Israeli media, that the Palestinians reduce their police 
force, did not appear in the final published list. The Palestinians, 
who say they have complied with Wye, derided the conditions. ``We 
have nothing to do with these five points, this is an election campaign,'' 
said Ahmed Abdel Ruhman, the secretary of the Palestinian cabinet. 
``No matter what direction Israel takes or whoever becomes prime minister 
... there are agreements that must be implemented.'' Both opponents 
of further concessions to the Palestinians and doves in the opposition 
who want to accelerate the accords have announced that they will vote 
against Netanyahu's policies. ``Netanyahu disappointed his voters 
at Wye,'' said Michael Kleiner, who heads Land of Israel Front, a 
parliamentary grouping that opposes any further concessions. Kleiner 
told Israel TV that the Front _ which includes legislators in Netanyahu's 
coalition _ would run its own candidate to challenge Netanyahu, but 
declined to say who it would be. Among doves, Labor Party leader Ehud 
Barak, whose party began the Israel-Palestinian peace process in 1993, 
was readying for new elections. Barak met Saturday with Israel's former 
armed forces chief, Lt. Gen. Amnon Lipkin-Shahak, considered a favored 
candidate for prime minister. Shahak, who has been performing well 
in polls, declined Barak's invitation to run alongside him in the 
number two slot, suggesting that the candidate most likely to beat 
Netanyahu run against him, Israel's army radio said. Barak refused. 
``I'll be happy if he (Shahak) joins us,'' Barak told the radio, ``(but) 
I am the one who leads us.'' Israeli media reports say that Shahak 
may opt to head a centrist list. Netanyahu advisor David Bar-Illan 
said he was unconcerned about polls that show Barak leading Netanyahu 
by a statistically insignificant five percent. ``All I can say is 
that Netanyahu started the campaign in 1996 being 25 points behind 
Peres,'' Bar-Illan said, referring to former Prime Minister, beaten 
by Netanyahu in a tight race in 1996. Netanyahu could take heart from 
a last-minute reversal by settlers, who on Sunday pledged to back 
him in parliament. ``At this present time, it would not be beneficial 
for the residents and communities (of settlements) to topple the government,'' 
said settler spokeswoman Yehudit Tayar. The settlers helped bring 
Netanyahu to power in 1996 but turned against him after he signed 
the Wye Accords. The settlers' announcement would move a few legislators 
who had been considering bolting the coalition to back Netanyahu's 
peace proposals _ but not enough to salvage his government.
