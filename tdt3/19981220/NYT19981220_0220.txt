One message from the House for President Clinton on Saturday was that 
he was blessed with the stalwart loyalty of his fellow Democrats. 
Only five Democrats broke ranks and voted for any of the articles 
of impeachment. Afterward, in a striking display, two busloads of 
Democratic lawmakers rallied behind the president on the South Lawn 
of the White House. But many Democrats did not rally around their 
president out of heartfelt fealty. Instead, in opposing impeachment 
and standing, literally, with Clinton many were registering their 
disapproval of how Republicans have handled the inquiry _ as well 
as their belief that impeachment is not warranted. A number of House 
Democrats expressed that view in interviews. ``I don't think you'd 
find a whole lot of loyalty to Bill Clinton around here,'' said Rep. 
Louise M. Slaughter of upstate New York. ``He's not the best Democrat 
any of us have seen. Most of us are scared to death of the constitutional'' 
implications. Rep. Benjamin L. Cardin of Maryland said he, too, was 
``not rallying around the president.'' ``A large number of us,'' he 
said, ``are saying, `We don't have to cross the line of personal loyalty.' 
There are some who are so outraged by how the president was treated, 
the whole process, the Starr investigation. The other half of our 
caucus is somewhat in bewilderment that this even elevates to an impeachable 
offense.'' Rep. David E. Skaggs of Colorado said: ``If you accumulated 
the credit balance on the loyalty account with all Democratic members 
of the House, it's in the black, but not by a lot because there's 
been this general sense over there that there's not a lot of loyalty 
shown in the other direction.'' Skaggs, who is retiring, added: ``We 
all have this running love-hate relationship with the president. On 
one hand he's a charming and good leader. On the other hand, he's 
absolutely infuriating and alienating.'' Asked whether he was rallying 
around the president out of loyalty, Rep. Rick Boucher of Virginia, 
a member of the Judiciary Committee, said: ``Absolutely not. Every 
one here has a deep disdain for his conduct. It is deplorable. He 
has dishonored his office.'' But, in opposing impeachment, Boucher 
said, ``I see myself defending the public interest, the constitutional 
standard for impeachment.'' Even Rep. Robert Wexler of Florida, who 
was one of the most vociferous defenders of Clinton on the Judiciary 
Committee, conceded that his fervency was not borne of affection for 
the president. ``I'm rallying around the Constitution,'' he said. 
``I'm rallying around the American presidency. This has become far 
bigger than Bill Clinton.'' The notion of an outpouring of devotion 
to Clinton may be particularly misplaced because many Democrats are 
still bitter at the president on a number of counts, from accusations 
that he shut them out of numerous policy deliberations _ preferring 
to do business with Republicans _ to blaming him for costing them 
control of the House in the 1994 election. ``Even as recently as last 
fall we were pretty much shut out,'' Mrs. Slaughter said. ``The difficulty 
I've got in my district is people perceive that I'm protecting him. 
My problem is I do believe he is being railroaded.'' Given the lingering 
tensions between Democratic lawmakers and the president, one House 
Democratic leadership aide said he was surprised that members of his 
party had stood behind the president so solidly. ``The don't like 
the president,'' the aide said, speaking on the condition of anonymity. 
``But the Republicans have done a good job at uniting us _ and driving 
us into his arms.'' Mark Mellman, a Democratic pollster, said he believed 
that it was easier for Republicans to be more passionate because even 
many Democrats who oppose impeachment feel a conflict between their 
anger at the Republicans and their rage at Clinton for his behavior. 
``When the cause looks completely holy, you're going to give it your 
all,'' Mellman said. ``If Democrats thought the president did the 
right thing in having this relationship _ and did nothing wrong _ 
it would be easier to be a 100 percenter. It's hard to summon the 
same level of fervency when you think that what the Republicans are 
doing is reprehensible, but you also think what the president did 
was reprehensible _ but not impeachable.''
