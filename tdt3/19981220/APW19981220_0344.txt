Up to a dozen people splattered the walls of the U.S. embassy in Madrid 
with red paint Sunday to protest the bombing raids against Iraq and 
to protest the continuing sanctions against the Gulf nation. The activists, 
members of the Campaign for the Lifting of Sanctions Against Iraq, 
hurled bottles of red paint both at the surrounding wall of the embassy 
compound and also at the embassy building itself. Carlos Varea, a 
spokesman for the group, told reporters that although the airstrikes 
against Iraq had halted, the United States was continuing its war 
against Iraq with economic sanctions. The protest lasted some 15 minutes. 
There were no reports of arrests.
