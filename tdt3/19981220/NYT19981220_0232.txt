Mel Fisher, a former chicken farmer who became a Horatio Alger figure 
among undersea treasure hunters, died on Saturday at his home in Key 
West, Fla. He was 76. The cause was complications from cancer, the 
Mel Fisher museum in Key West announced. Fisher found hundreds of 
thousands of gold and silver coins, jewelry and bars from old-time 
Spanish shipwrecks in the waters off Florida. He hunted doggedly for 
years for the cargo of a single treasure-packed galleon, the Nuestra 
Senora de Atocha, which sank in 1622 near the Florida Keys. Eventually 
his son Kane located the underwater bounty in 1985, and treasure worth 
roughly $400 million was recovered. As a result, a handful of people, 
including Fisher family members, investors, and a lawyer for Fisher, 
David Paul Horan, became millionaires. When asked why he had chosen 
his risky and uncertain trade, Fisher often said, ``For the fun, the 
romance and the adventure.'' While he searched for treasure he liked 
to say hopefully, and repeatedly, ``Today is the day.'' Another, brisker, 
motto was ``Finders keepers.'' He was known for his optimism despite 
skeptical investors, mixed luck in the law courts, a leaky houseboat-home, 
debts and far greater sorrows: a son and daughter-in-law died when 
their boat tipped in 1975. Fisher's success in discovering treasure 
and in winning title under traditional admiralty law led environmentalists, 
historians and archeologists to persuade Congress and states to control 
salvage. In 1987 Congress approved the Abandoned Shipwreck Act, which 
put an end to admiralty law and conveyed to states the title to wrecks 
within three miles of the coastline. By last summer, new regulations 
were putting shipwrecks off limits, or making them hard to retrieve, 
along the American coastline, where laissez-faire had traditionally 
prevailed. By June 1998, of thousands of known wrecks, fewer than 
20 were under salvage permit _ and half were Fisher's. Last month 
Fisher admitted selling several counterfeit gold coins at his gift 
shop in Key West, and agreed to repay to purchasers the prices of 
the coins _ $2,500 to $10,000. It had been asserted that they were 
from a 1733 Spanish fleet that went aground off the Florida Keys. 
In a negotiated plea, Crystals of Delaware, a sales subsidiary of 
a company owned by Fisher, pledged that it would put on sale only 
coins that had been recovered from shipwrecks to which it had federal 
salvage rights. At the time, the counterfeits were said to have been 
bought from a longtime colleague who asserted they were genuine. Michael 
Halpern, a lawyer who negotiated the plea for Fisher's side, said 
last month that Fisher was near death at the time, and that he thought 
Fisher's ill health contributed to the fraud. ``He was taking immense 
amounts of medicine,'' Halpern said. ``He is very, very vulnerable.'' 
The company pleaded no contest and agreed to pay more than $67,000 
to identified claimants. Fisher was born in Gary, Ind., was trained 
as a hydraulic engineer at Purdue University and at the University 
of Alabama, but turned to chicken-farming in California. Then he opened 
a diving shop and began diving for treasure; he soon moved his family 
to Florida and became a serious treasure-hunter and salvager. He is 
said to have been heartened by his finding of a doubloon under water 
at the Florida coast in the 1960s, in an era when salvage was based 
on Britain's admiralty law, which held salvagers' work to be in the 
public interest. Besides his son Kane, of Sebastian, Fla., Fisher 
is survived by his wife of 48 years, Dolores, known as Deo; two other 
sons, Kim and Terry of Key West; a daughter, Taffi Fisher-Abt of Sebastian, 
and 14 grandchildren.
