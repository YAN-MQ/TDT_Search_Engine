Tens of thousands of anti-American demonstrators, including many Islamic 
militants, marched in the the Moroccan capital Sunday to protest airstrikes 
against Iraq. Independent estimates put the number of protesters at 
about 100,000 people, a large demonstration for Morocco. Police presence 
was heavy. The protesters shouted, ``America, Enemy of the people,'' 
and ``Clinton, what if you kept busy with with Monica?'' American 
and British flags were also burned. The demonstration Sunday was organized 
by the National Committee for the Support of Iraq. It was similar 
to protests held in Morocco during the Gulf War in 1991 that were 
organized by the same group. Behind the first group of demonstrators 
was a second composed of Islamic militants. Some of them burned Israeli 
flags. Others marched behind a black banner of a banned Islamic movement 
called ``Justice and Charity. It was one of the biggest protests by 
Islamic militants in Morocco in recent years. The protesters dispersed 
peacefully.
