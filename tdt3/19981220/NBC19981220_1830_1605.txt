Finally tonight, a story that fits the season. Christmas is coming 
to Cuba for a second year in a row. But there is a limit to how much 
people there can celebrate. NBC's Kerry Sanders now. Christmas in 
Cuba -- officially outlawed by Fidel Castro, except for the exemption 
he made last year at the request of Pope John Paul. Now, with the 
communist government's official blessing, a permanent return to public 
celebrations has been authorized. Today, there are displays on downtown 
Havana streets -- the holiday trappings of both the religious and 
commercial meanings of Christmas. Mercy zorsano and her family never 
stopped celebrating the holiday, but now they no longer have to hide 
it. There was almost no way of maintaining the religious faith, because 
at school, you couldn't say anything. At the University you couldn't 
say you went to mass, or believed in God or anything else. So it was 
really difficult. American political experts and religious leaders 
credit the shift in Cuba's policy to the Pope's January visit to the 
island. Traditional communist doctrine holds that religion is the 
opium of the people. But Fidel Castro now says he never outlawed Christmas 
for that reason. Instead, the Cuban government says it suspended Christmas 
celebrations for almost three decades because of economic necessities. 
But today, Cuba's economy is more fragile than it's been in decades. 
When Castro canceled Christmas 29 years ago, the country was getting 
financial help from the Kremlin. A priest in Miami, father Daniel 
Kubala spent four months in Cuba this year he says. While his visit 
is proof the church has been allowed to reawaken, he did not see signs 
that Castro is loosening his tight grip. There is a long way to go. 
I think the church has been very much persevering. There has been 
an absence in the church and still is an absence of the church, just 
the physical church, as well as priests. Christmas in communist Cuba 
-- a religious celebration in a Country where Castro is still the 
supreme power. Kerry Sanders, NBC news, Miami.
