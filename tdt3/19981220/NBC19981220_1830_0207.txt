Now to the impeachment of President Clinton. Today the focused turned 
to preparations for the trial. The U.S. Senate will be seated as jurors. 
And if they convict the president, he will be removed from office. 
John Palmer at the White House tonight. At church today, the president 
heard the minister call for national healing and reconciliation in 
the wake of the divisive impeachment vote. As he was leaving, Mr. 
Clinton and his daughter were greeted by applause and one heckler 
who muttered angrily to the president -- "damn you for what you did 
to the nation." As the impeachment process shifts from the house vote 
to the Senate trial, a key senator indicated today that a lengthy 
trial may be avoided, especially if there's not the two-thirds majority 
needed to convict. We should do a very hard count to determine whether 
there are 34 or more people who will never vote for impeachment under 
any circumstances. And if we find there aren't, then it's apparent 
that we should not put the country through three, four, five, six 
months of trial. I do not think you want to tie up the three branches 
of government for the next four months. But some republicans argued 
a trial could be completed in just a Few weeks. I think you will see 
a trial that will be conducted very fairly, very much in bipartisan 
fashion. And I would hope and expect, very quickly. Several senators 
noted that a simple majority vote could halt the trial at any time. 
To terminate the trial requires bipartisan cooperation, and I think 
the best thing we can do to bring that about is to continue to talk 
to one another and to think of the national interests. Whatever develops, 
the president's lawyers say they are ready. We're preparing for trial, 
we'll mount a vigorous defense of the law and on the fact. And we're 
quite confident that we will prevail, and that the president will 
be acquitted. For now, the main concern of the White House is that 
calls for the president's resignation by some republicans on Capitol 
Hill might take hold with the public. John Palmer, NBC news, at the 
White House.
