Jerrold Nadler knew where duty lay Saturday when his colleague, Bob 
Livingston, resigned from the House of Representatives after confessing 
to adultery. Nadler, a Democrat from Manhattan, promptly rose on the 
House floor to denounce ``a developing sexual McCarthyism.'' His horrified 
reaction was a faithful representation of his constituents' sentiments 
_ or at least those of the older male ones. Nadler was standing up 
for an island whose economy would be in shambles if every adulterous 
male executive had to resign. The only place with a greater need for 
disaster relief would be Hollywood (where Jack Nicholson has been 
spearheading the president's defense). Unlike his counterpart in Washington, 
the New York adulterer is not even required to feign shame. The prototypical 
image of the Washington alpha male these days is a grim-faced President 
Clinton contemplating his shoes while his wife stands awkwardly at 
his side. The New York equivalent is a smiling Donald Trump, sans 
any of his ex-wives, waving at the cameras as he walks into a party 
with a 21-year-old model. The city's modern male ethos was summed 
up in a drawing by Tom Wolfe in the 1970s titled ``The Birds and the 
Bees.'' It's a Norman Rockwell kind of scene, a puzzled boy sitting 
in a duck blind listening to his father, a square-jawed fellow who 
looks to be a corporate titan. ``No, no, son, that's not how it works,'' 
the father says. ``When you're 45 or 50, you'll get a new wife, a 
young one, a girl in her 20s.'' ``What happens to the old one?'' the 
son asks. ``Well, she opens up a needlepoint shop and sells yarn to 
her friends and joins a discussion group.'' New York, like Washington 
and Hollywood, is an adultery capital because it has so many attractive 
young women and so many successful older men. The New York males who 
win the struggles for money, power and fame have a sense of entitlement: 
If you can make it here, you can trade it for sex here. They have 
reacted to the Clinton scandal by arguing that adultery should be 
a private matter, which is reasonable if that means it's not something 
to be legislated or prosecuted. But there's no use pretending that 
adultery is not a social problem, or that the press has been fixated 
on a ``trivial'' sex scandal. President Clinton's libido exemplifies 
what is perhaps the most profound problem facing any society. The 
male instinct to philander has been a perpetual source of misery for 
women, children and non-alpha males. Some groups have avoided hypocrisy 
by allowing rich older men to acquire young new wives _ polygamy, 
the free-market approach _ but that can lead to unhappy older wives 
and neglected children. It also leaves what anthropologists call bachelor 
herds: lots of young, poor men without mates, who are prone to working 
out their frustrations through violence and crime. Monogamy, the socialist 
approach, has never worked either. As long as men have run societies, 
they've generally allowed one another to discreetly break the rules. 
More recently, men like Donald Trump and Ronald Perelman have adopted 
a new form of marriage, serial polygamy _ many wives, one at a time 
_ which is possibly the worst system of all. To New York's alpha males, 
Livingston's resignation may seem a mysterious Washington ritual, 
as exotic as a samurai warrior killing himself over an imperceptible 
grievance. New York men may think such a thing can't happen here. 
But I would remind them once again of Tom Arnold's words. I quoted 
Arnold's philosophy in a column in January, trying to make sense of 
some local sex scandals in which male philanderers received New York's 
version of censure: humiliation by tabloid. I wondered if the men's 
punishment was a result of the emerging power of women in society 
and the media, and of women's superior skills at using gossip to enforce 
moral standards. Two days after that column went to press, the Drudge 
Report broke the news about the president and an intern, a scandal 
brought to public attention by two middle-aged women, Linda Tripp 
and Lucianne Goldberg. Since then, the president has been impeached, 
and the words of other women have apparently stopped Livingston from 
becoming speaker of the House. Before New Yorkers dismiss him as an 
aberration, they might remember what Tom Arnold said last year about 
Frank Gifford. Arnold was on ``The Late Show With David Letterman,'' 
and he refused to join Letterman in chortling over the tabloid revelations 
of Gifford's infidelities. Arnold recognized the perils of the new 
moral order. ``Frank took a bullet for a lot of us,'' he said.
