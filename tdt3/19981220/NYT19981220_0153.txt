Accusations of adultery in a divorce dispute may threaten the political 
future of Lt. Gov. Mary Fallin, who has been mentioned as a likely 
Republican candidate for governor in 2002. Ms. Fallin has denied the 
accusation, made by her husband's lawyer in a divorce hearing on Dec. 
4, that she had an affair with a bodyguard. But the controversy widened 
after news reports confirmed the resignation of a highway patrol trooper 
who had been assigned to protect her. The trooper, Greg Allen, told 
his supervisors in October there was no truth to rumors that he and 
Ms. Fallin were having an affair. But the Oklahoma public safety commissioner, 
Bob Ricks, said Allen later admitted in a meeting that his relationship 
with Ms. Fallin had ``crossed the line.'' Allen, 37, a 14-year veteran 
of the highway patrol who is married and has two children, was allowed 
to resign on Dec. 1. But he now wants his job back. He has insisted 
that his relationship with the lieutenant governor was platonic. Allen's 
lawyer, Gary James, said the trooper consoled Ms. Fallin after she 
confided in him that her marriage was troubled. He said Allen had 
occasionally held Ms. Fallin's hand and hugged her. ``They became 
very good friends,'' James said. ``Greg was Mary's confidant. I guess 
as a security guard, you're not supposed to be a friend.'' Ms. Fallin's 
husband, Joe, an Oklahoma City dentist, has acknowledged that he had 
his wife followed by a private investigator. The Fallins have been 
married 14 years and have two children. Since the controversy became 
public, the lieutenant governor, who easily won a second term last 
month, has kept a low profile, refusing interview requests and occasionally 
working from her home. Her spokesman, John Carsten, said her office 
has received hundreds of phone calls, faxes and e-mail messages. ``Everything 
that I've heard coming across the reception desk has been people calling 
in and offering their support, telling her to hang in there,'' Carsten 
said. Still, one Oklahoma Republican, Mike McCarville, said there 
was ``no doubt this has hurt her.'' ``Even people who will give the 
lieutenant governor the benefit of the doubt privately will say things 
like `Gosh, surely Mary knew better than to be hugging on her bodyguard,''' 
said McCarville, a former political consultant who is now the host 
of a radio talk show in Oklahoma City. McCarville said Ms. Fallin's 
aspirations for the governor's job might hinge on whether Allen is 
reinstated. ``If nothing is proven in terms of a relationship beyond 
this platonic hugging and hand-holding, I don't think it will be fatal 
to Mary Fallin's political future,'' he said. ``But I think it will 
put the question in the minds of some of her supporters. And it sure 
gives the Democrats something to shoot at her with.'' Ricks, the public 
safety commissioner, said the trooper's resignation and request to 
rescind it were being reviewed. If the relationship between Ms. Fallin, 
43, and Allen was platonic, Ricks asked, ``Does it rise to the level 
of being so unprofessional that it would warrant his removal? In the 
final analysis, it's going to be difficult for there to be any winners 
in this.''
