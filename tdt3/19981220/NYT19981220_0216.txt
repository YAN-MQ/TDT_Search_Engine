The New York Islanders lost 4-2 to the sizzling Coyotes Sunday, but 
they will return from their trip with something they have been without 
for weeks: hope. For the Islanders, hope is spelled Z-I-G-G-Y. Zigmund 
Palffy, the Islanders' top scorer the past three seasons, will join 
the team for Monday's practice, which will be his first appearance 
on Long Island since ending a three-month holdout last week by signing 
a five-year deal averaging $5.5 million a season. On Tuesday, Palffy, 
who scored 45 goals and had 42 assists last season, will make his 
season debut against the St. Louis Blues at Nassau Coliseum. ``It's 
going to add a spark to our team just having him at practice tomorrow,'' 
said Trevor Linden, the Islanders' captain. The Islanders (12-19) 
turned in another dogged performance Sunday, taking the Coyotes, one 
of the league's best teams (18-5-4), late into the third period tied 
at 2-2. But with 5 minutes 20 seconds left, Keith Tkachuk, the Coyotes' 
bruising left wing who had missed the two previous games with a strained 
groin, redirected a shot between Tommy Salo's pads on a power play. 
``Their top player did what he does best,'' Mike Milbury, the Islanders' 
coach and general manager, said of Tkachuk, who got his 16th goal 
this season. ``He drove a stake through our heart. That is why he's 
a star player.'' The Islanders had a chance to tie the score with 
38 seconds left in the third period when Claude Lapointe nearly slapped 
the puck between the pads of Nikolai Khabibulin, the Coyotes' goalie. 
It was the last chance the Islanders would have because Phoenix locked 
up the victory at the sold-out America West Arena seconds later with 
an empty-net goal. ``A tie or a win would have been icing on the cake,'' 
Milbury said. ``I told the guys this was a pretty good road trip, 
and maybe we can build on that.'' The Isles were 2-1-1 on their Western 
swing. In the first period, Salo, who made 30 saves, stopped every 
shot he could, and even some he should not have, but the Coyotes still 
managed to score once, taking a 1-0 lead at 16:37. Greg Adams tapped 
in a rebound as Salo lay sprawled on the ice after making an eye-popping 
toe-strap save on Jyrki Lumme. New York came back on a goal by the 
journeyman Mark Lawrence, who beat Khabibulin between the pads at 
17:41, his first goal of the season. Juha Ylonen put Phoenix ahead 
again with a goal at 2:10 of the second period, but the Islanders 
tied it once more when Eric Brewer scored midway through the final 
period. When the Islanders left for San Jose last week, they were 
losers of seven straight games. But they will return to Long Island 
having beaten the Sharks and Kings and tied the Mighty Ducks before 
losing Sunday. It seems the Islanders have rediscovered the game _ 
gritty with a strong defensive presence _that made them successful 
in October. And, they will have Palffy. ``I don't know what kind of 
shape Ziggy is in,'' Milbury said. ``But whatever shape he is in, 
he's going to bring an added dimension.''
