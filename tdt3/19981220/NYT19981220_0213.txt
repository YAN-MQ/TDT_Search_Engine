More homeless people died in San Francisco in the last 12 months than 
in any year since tracking began in 1985, an increase that has alarmed 
and frustrated advocates for the homeless and city health workers. 
The deaths numbered 157. They were detailed in the Homeless Death 
Review, issued last week by the San Francisco Department of Public 
Health and covering the period from December 1997 to Nov. 30. Last 
year's report counted 104 deaths. The previous record was 154 deaths 
in 1996. The review, the third such analysis since the city took over 
the annual project from a neighborhood newspaper, is compiled from 
data released by the medical examiner's office. The figures indicate 
how risky life on the streets has become in San Francisco, where the 
mayor's office estimates that 4,000 people are homeless on any night. 
There are at most 2,000 emergency shelter beds, meaning that 2,000 
people are without a place to stay on any night. The causes of death 
include drowning and asthma, but substance abuse is the leading killer. 
Drug overdoses were responsible in 62 cases, either from heroin alone 
or in combination with other drugs. Ten people died from alcohol-related 
problems. Seven had heart disease, and two died from AIDS. Seven committed 
suicide, six were murdered and five died after being struck by cars. 
The average age at death was 42. Health officials and advocacy groups 
say they cannot explain exactly why the increase occurred. But many 
pointed to the rigors of the intense El Nino winter, and others blamed 
police sweeps that displaced many homeless people from places like 
Golden Gate Park. Housing is scarce, too, said Marian Pena, director 
of the health department's homeless program. ``People just can't find 
housing,'' Ms. Pena said. ``Hundreds of units have been lost to fires 
or to tourism, with a room with no bath renting for $600 and more.'' 
Heroin also played a part. ``We have seen a huge increase in the number 
of heroin-related deaths in the past two years,'' Ms. Pena said. ``It 
has been more pure, cheaper and in some cases contaminated.'' The 
contamination, both bacterial and viral, can come from shared needles 
or from the heroin itself. Kandace Bender, press secretary to Mayor 
Willie Brown Jr., said she agreed that drugs and alcohol were significant 
factors in the number of deaths, and said the mayor was addressing 
the problem. ``Over the last three years,'' Ms. Bender said, ``the 
mayor has provided $11 million for substance abuse programs and mobile 
outreach programs. The mayor is very concerned about this problem, 
and continues to work on a continuum of care that combines shelter, 
outreach, counseling, jobs and transitional housing.'' Paul Boden, 
director of the San Francisco Coalition on Homelessness, who helped 
prepare the reports, said he would like to see city officials find 
a way to better use the information that agencies gather on the homeless. 
``For all these folks that they are finding dead in the city,'' Boden 
said, ``there is a lot of information available about them. They have 
been through intake programs, screenings, for substance abuse, for 
housing. All that information is centralized. But the information 
is simply not being used.'' In a modest effort at intervention, the 
health department last year began a death prevention program made 
up of three health care workers and a nurse. The program, operated 
on a slim budget, does not even have a vehicle for its rounds of the 
city's poorest areas. The team tries to identify high-risk cases and 
get individuals into treatment quickly. ``We have some resources,'' 
Ms. Pena said, ``but we don't have enough. We need to stop pretending 
that we do have enough. And it's absolutely futile to talk about substance 
abuse without dealing with the housing issue.''
