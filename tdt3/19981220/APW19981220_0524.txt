President Boris Yeltsin said Sunday that the U.S.-British airstrikes 
had only complicated any solution to the Iraqi crisis, and welcomed 
the end to the bombardment. ``Reason has finally prevailed,'' he said 
in a statement transmitted by Russian news agencies. ``Now the international 
community should draw serious conclusions from these tragic events.'' 
The United States and Britain halted airstrikes against Iraq on Saturday 
after four days of attacks, saying their forces had inflicted ``significant 
damage'' on Iraq's military. ``It still remains to fully assess the 
negative political consequences the bombardment led to, not to speak 
of the victims among the civilian population and the significant damage 
to the Iraqi economy, which was already bled dry by the sanctions,'' 
Yeltsin was quoted as saying by the Interfax news agency. ``However, 
now it is absolutely clear that the use of force only complicated 
the solution of the Iraqi problem.'' Yeltsin said that Russia insisted 
on the creation of a multipolar system in the world and the strengthening 
of the United Nations' role. ``This is the universal organization 
that is charged with guaranteeing collective responses to the new, 
dangerous challenges confronted by the family of nations. Nobody has 
the right to violate the U.N. charter, which for more than half a 
century has been the reliable guarantee of peace and stability,'' 
he said. Yeltsin called on Iraq to fulfill the U.N. resolutions that 
would allow the lifting of sanctions. However, he said that the world 
must not neglect Iraq's humanitarian needs, saying that ``now like 
never before'' the Iraqis needed massive food and medical aid. The 
Iraq crisis has underlined Moscow's loss of global influence and the 
unhappiness of some Russian political leaders and officials about 
close post-Soviet ties with the West. Part of Yeltsin's anger stemmed 
from his not being informed in advance about the airstrikes.
