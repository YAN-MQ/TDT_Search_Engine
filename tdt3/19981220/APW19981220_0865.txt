Julie Foudy scored three goals, leading the United States' women's 
soccer team over Ukraine 5-0. Foudy scored twice in the first 10 minutes 
of the second half Sunday for a 4-0 lead. Coming into the game, Foudy 
had 24 goals in 137 international appearances. She had three previous 
goals this year for the U.S. team (22-1-2). Tiffeny Milbrett scored 
20 minutes into the game scoring off a centering pass from Shannon 
MacMillan. Foudy then made it 2-0 with a line drive shot from 25 yards 
(20 meters) out. ``I got a great ball in from Kate Sobrero and there 
was a lot of space there,'' Foudy said. Debbie Keller finished off 
the scoring with a goal on a pass from Susan Bush, who was making 
just her second international appearance. Ukraine appeared content 
to stay back on defense and try to keep the game close. Ukraine had 
just two shots on goal the entire game, one in each half.
