Inside Iraq there is relief and defiance. Kevin Tibbles in Baghdad 
now on the fallout after the bombs. Across Baghdad, people ventured 
out of bomb shelters after hearing the news air strikes were over. 
Some raged at the United States for launching the attack. And by sunup, 
the cleanup was under way. Iraqis claim American missiles struck this 
neighborhood, and say they have pieces of cruise missiles to prove 
it. On Iraqi television, Saddam Hussein, not seen in public since 
the raids began, praised his people for their courage saying -- "God 
will repay you well, and crowns your heart with clear victory." Newspaper 
headlines too screamed victory, calling on Iraqis to strike back at 
the forces of evil. One said, "we will never negotiate." Even as children 
came out of hiding and went to school, many Iraqis remained defiant. 
My message to Clinton, the boyfriend of Monica, if he's a human being 
and a Christian, he will not do this. Meanwhile, the chief U.N. official 
was on the streets of Baghdad assessing the damage. With bombing over, 
U.N. humanitarian work is set to resume. The international staff who 
have relocated during the bombing will return on Wednesday or maybe 
as early as Tuesday. They will all be back. And the Iraqi people are 
once again picking up the pieces. They may have survived the attacks 
from the sky, but for them, the punishment is not over. The eight-year-old 
economic sanctions remain in effect. Kevin Tibbles, NBC, Baghdad.
