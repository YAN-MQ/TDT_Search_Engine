China has begun considering a law to compel the growing private sector 
to pay into a new Western-style social welfare system, the official 
China Daily reported Sunday. A law under consideration would require 
all firms, whether state or private, to pay into a nascent national 
social security system system, Jing Shuping, head of a government-backed 
group that represents the private sector, was quoted by the paper 
as saying. He added that without the private sector's participation, 
the social security system would fail. Without nationwide unemployment 
and pension schemes, the government fears expected layoffs of tens 
of millions of unneeded state workers could create social unrest. 
So it views a social security safety net as an essential part of reforms 
to end central planning and privatize state-run industries. But the 
report quoted an unnamed expert as saying that while 90 percent of 
state firms are paying into the social insurance pools, only a minority 
of private ones are doing so. By last year, the industrial output 
of private enterprises had jumped to 75 percent of China's total from 
just 22 percent in 1978, the first year of major free market-style 
economic reforms.
