Graham Kelly, who quit as English soccer's most powerful official 
over an unauthorized 3.2 million pound (dles 5 million) loan to the 
Welsh federation, maintained on Sunday the payment was not a bribe. 
Kelly has agreed that he and Football Association chairman Keith Wiseman 
promised the money to the Welsh FA without telling the rest of the 
executive committee of the English FA and the payment has been interpreted 
as a bribe to gain a Welsh vote in Wiseman's favor in a FIFA/UEFA 
election. Kelly has denied that was the motive. But he has agreed 
that the payment was in keeping with the English FA's long-running 
policy of helping out other cash-strapped soccer federations and he 
could not see anything wrong if that policy had a positive effect 
on England's bid to win the 2006 World Cup. ``A bribe to me is somebody 
slipping something into somebody's back pocket and then they go away 
and stash it in the Bahamas,'' he said. ``What I was doing was in 
the best interests of English football. I went into it with the very 
good intentions of trying to seek to strengthen England's position 
in world football generally and in connection with the World Cup 2006 
campaign.'' Kelly said he believed the World Cup bid didn't need much 
help anyway. ``If the 2006 World Cup is decided on the strength of 
the bids then England is in fine shape,'' he said. ``It is in the 
best position at the moment. It has the best case, the best grounds, 
the best infrastructure and I believe it will stay that way up until 
the time the decision is taken in March 2000.'' Kelly agreed that 
he and Wiseman should have let the executive committee know about 
the Welsh offer at an earlier stage. ``With hindsight it would have 
been better to come up front with it much more quickly than we did,'' 
he said. ``That was not a deliberate act and it was something which 
didn't get done in the heat of the moment.'' But the executive committee 
weren't prepared to accept his explanation and, in the biggest scandal 
in the FA's 135-year history, Kelly quit at a board meeting on Tuesday. 
The committee voted unanimously for Wiseman to go too. The chairman 
refused and called for the full 91-member FA Council to decide the 
issue Jan. 4.
