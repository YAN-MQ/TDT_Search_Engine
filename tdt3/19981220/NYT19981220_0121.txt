In a broad display of internal division that has no precedent in modern 
Mexican history, several dozen dissident soldiers, led by a lieutenant 
colonel, have emerged to publicly criticize government economic policies 
and civilian control of the military as well reputed abuses by military 
courts. The army's top prosecutor responded angrily on Saturday to 
a street protest by the dissident soldiers, vowing a crackdown on 
members of the fledgling movement. ``Any soldier who speaks badly 
of his institution and of his superior officers must be severely punished,'' 
said the prosecutor, Gen. Rafael Macedo de la Concha. The apparent 
head of the group, the Patriotic Command to Raise the People's Consciousness, 
is Lt. Col. Hidelgardo Bacilio Gomez, a 43-year-old army surgeon who 
led about 50 soldiers on a march Friday along Mexico City's main downtown 
boulevard, Reforma. They carried Mexican flags and placards criticizing 
the army high command. At the march's close, Bacilio Gomez, flanked 
by two leftist senators, read a statement criticizing government corruption 
and called for Mexicans to join his protest. Plainclothes military 
intelligence officers surrounded the dissident officers, but made 
no arrests. Bacilio Gomez met briefly with officials and later told 
reporters he had asked the government to guarantee his safety because 
he feared for his life. He voiced admiration for Hugo Chavez, Venezuela's 
president-elect, who as army officer led an attempted coup in 1992, 
and said he hoped to travel to Venezuela. After the march, Bacilio 
Gomez dropped from public view. But on Sunday, news media received 
a faxed statement signed by him accusing generals of corruption and 
criticizing Mexico's system of civilian control over the military. 
Federal police agents, apparently seeking to detain him, swarmed through 
the Mexico City airport on Saturday before the scheduled departure 
of a commercial flight bound for Caracas, Venezuela, the Mexico City 
newspaper Reforma reported. In several statements faxed to news media, 
the colonel has also quoted the leader of the Zapatista guerrillas 
in southern Mexico, Subcommander Marcos, and Gerry Adams, the Irish 
Republican leader. ``It can't be possible that in a country of 98 
million people there is not a single intelligent, pragmatic, innovative 
leader who can assume power with a political, social and economic 
model designed to lead Mexico out of its current difficulties,'' he 
said in a statement issued on Saturday. He said the government should 
provide a life of dignity for its people, ``which means to eat, to 
be dressed, to be educated, to have shelter.'' A Mexico City television 
station reported that Bacilio Gomez has been facing a court-martial 
for murder and robbery. But a statement signed by another dissident 
army officer denied the report, saying he is charged with lesser offenses, 
including insubordination.
