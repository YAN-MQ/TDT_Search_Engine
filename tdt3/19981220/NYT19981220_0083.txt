A sampling of observations about Scrooge from actors who portray him: 
Hal Landon, 57, South Coast Repertory Theater, Costa Mesa, Calif., 
who has played the role for 19 years: ``We admire people who are good 
at what they do, and there is a purity about his miserliness.'' Tony 
Randall, 78, who played the role in Madison Square Garden, New York, 
in 1996: ``He's at a point in life where he's nothing but regrets, 
excluded from happiness by his own acts, and he knows it. He's so 
ready to change he's like a girl whose virtue depends only on the 
fact that no one's ever asked her.'' Bob Thompson, 71, Pollard Theater, 
Guthrie, Okla., who played Scrooge for seven years: ``Most people 
would spend a significant portion of their lives like Scrooge if they 
thought they could get away with it.'' Raye Birk, 55, Actors Conservatory 
Theater, San Francisco; three years as Scrooge: ``There are people 
in the audience who get off on Scrooge's meanness, particularly as 
you get closer to Christmas and they get more fed up. As the hassle 
quotient goes up, the arm's length at which people hold Scrooge gets 
shorter.'' Tom Mula, 47, Goodman Theater, Chicago; seven years in 
the role, this year appearing in his own one-man show, ``Jacob Marley's 
Christmas Carol'': ``If you're honest, the part gets into you a little 
bit. You pick up a little of the meanness, the misanthropy. I would 
wake up in the morning with Scrooge on my face. That's not a pretty 
thing.'' Jarlath Conroy, in his 50s, Guthrie Theater, Minneapolis; 
has played the part four times: ``What I've tried to do this time 
around is put more of the journey Scrooge goes through into the play. 
That means you have to explore your own feelings of what Scrooge lacks, 
what it is to live without compassion, what it is to regain compassion, 
what it is to confront death. The older one gets, the more one is 
prepared to look back with compassion, which is a very relevant thing 
for Scrooge.'' Bill Norris, 50, Goodman Theater, Chicago; played Scrooge 
for last 12 years, this year appears as Fezziwig: ``The whole point 
of the character is that here's a man who has killed the child within 
himself and has to bring the child back to life. In the end he becomes 
impulsive. Not childish. Childlike.'' Sean Griffin, 56, A Contemporary 
Theater, Seattle; played Scrooge three times: ``Nowadays, I think 
a lot of people identify with the first Scrooge, the pre-redemption 
Scrooge. With so many homeless people begging on the streets, a lot 
of us do walk by with eyes turned away. He calls on the shame that 
people walk around with. Maybe we think we are that nasty old Scrooge.''
