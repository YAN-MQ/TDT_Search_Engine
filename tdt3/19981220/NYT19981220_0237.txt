Kent Graham and Conrad Hamilton work on opposite sides of the football 
and sit at opposite ends of the Giants' locker room. Their careers 
lie at opposite poles. On Sunday the veteran quarterback and the young 
cornerback nudged the Giants a step closer to a playoff berth _ a 
berth as improbable as the roles Graham and Hamilton have played in 
getting them there. Graham, who turned 30 on Nov. 1, has emerged as 
the fiery leader the Giants' offense has sorely needed. Hamilton, 
who turned 24 on Nov. 5, has quietly become one of the most dependable 
members of an inconsistent defense. ``We've struggled as a team,'' 
said John Fox, the Giants' defensive coordinator, ``but Conrad never 
has been one of the guys who's struggled. He had to fill some big 
shoes and all eyes were on him. But he hung in and stepped up. I've 
always had strong feelings about Conrad.'' Graham has been a quarterback 
in search of a home throughout his career. He began his college career 
at Notre Dame and transferred to Ohio State to get more playing time, 
though he did not start until his senior season. With the Giants, 
Graham was regarded as a cast-away quarterback at the beginning of 
the season. The perception was from the residue of his original tour 
of duty with the Giants, which ended with his release in 1995. Graham 
went through an emotional wringer in his first tour of duty with the 
Giants, who drafted him in the eighth round in 1992. He played sparingly 
in 1994 and was released before the 1995 season. Graham was quickly 
signed by the Detroit Lions but was inactive for most of the 1995 
season. He was granted unconditional free agency afterward and was 
signed by the Arizona Cardinals for 1996. That is where he met Coach 
Jim Fassel and earned the starting job in 1997 until he injured his 
ankle _ against the Giants. ``There weren't a whole lot of people 
out there that thought I was anything of a quarterback to be reckoned 
with,'' Graham said. ``Coach Fassel was really the only guy that I 
think had the confidence in me from Day One. I never wanted to leave 
there.'' A week after leading the Giants to a remarkable upset victory 
over the Denver Broncos with a last-gasp pass, Graham came back with 
a less dramatic but solid performance Sunday as the Giants beat the 
Kansas City Chiefs, 28-7. He threw 33 passes, completed 16 and even 
caught one for 16 yards. He threw a 32-yard touchdown pass and ran 
three times for 17 yards and another touchdown. When he finally left 
the game with 6 minutes 30 seconds to play, fans stood and applauded. 
Graham said he felt a rush. ``Guys who were here with me when I first 
came to New York know how I felt,'' he said. ``They know how important 
it was for me to come back here and do well. That's why hearing the 
fans, seeing them standing, was so emotional.'' Hamilton's tenure 
has not been so dramatic, his three-year career with the Giants has 
not been punctuated by sharp ups and downs or the politics of N.F.L. 
life. That may soon change. Hamilton's odyssey started during the 
exhibition season this summer when Jason Sehorn, the Giants' all-pro 
cornerback, suffered a season-ending knee injury. Hamilton became 
a starter and for the first six games felt that he was simply house-sitting. 
Now that the season is almost over and he has gained experience, Hamilton 
said he liked being a starter. In fact, that he cannot envision himself 
in any other role. ``Going into this last game, I know it's my job,'' 
Hamilton said. ``But it's not set in stone yet. I guess I've still 
got to earn my stripes. Hamilton is a restricted free agent after 
this season, which means the Giants have the right of first refusal 
on any offer he receives. ``I don't want to come back here as a nickel 
back,'' he said. ``What kind of man would I be to come back and settle? 
I don't want to settle. I see myself differently now. I feel comfortable 
and confident of my skills; all I ever asked for is the opportunity 
to compete.'' Fox, the defensive coordinator, concedes that he has 
thought about the impending traffic jam at cornerback. ``It does cross 
your mind,'' he said. ``Jason will come back, he'll have his job back 
and we'll have tremendous competition. It'll make us a better team.'' 
For now, the Giants' season has come down to mathematics, hopes, prayers 
and miracles. Their only hope of reaching the playoffs is defeating 
Philadelphia next Sunday and having Arizona and Tampa Bay lose. The 
Giants play in a late game next Sunday, as does Arizona. Tampa Bay 
plays in an early game, and the outcome of that one could make the 
Giants brace for a dramatic victory and a possible playoff berth or 
prepare them for a miserable anticlimax. Graham does not want the 
season to end. He's enjoying a once-in-a-lifetime run. ``I just want 
the season to keep going,'' he said, ``and we have a shot to do it.'' 
Opportunity knocks, miracles happen, careers are resurrected. Ask 
Hamilton. Ask Graham.
