It's been a rocky year on Wall Street. After record-breaking gains, 
the stock market took several major hits, only to come back again. 
Peter viles looks back. By midsummer, the bull market had broken the 
9000 barrier and had broken the spirit of many Wall Street bears. 
I'm humbled by the market every day. Several times a day, as a matter 
of fact. But then came the agony of August, when the presidency was 
paralyzed by crisis. Turmoil swept from Asia to Russia. And the bull 
market, with the weight of the world on its shoulders, buckled. The 
Dow lost 299 points August 4th, 357 on the 28th, 512 on the 31st, 
and 15% for the month. We're finally getting fear, we are finally 
getting some capitulation. So we're probably getting very close to 
a bottom in here. But while we're getting it, it's ugly while we're 
-- the process of making a bottom is very ugly. Very scary, and pretty 
nasty. The financial press tossed around words like "crash" and "Armageddon," 
and the bears multiplied. We are in a bear market, whether we like 
it or not. The average NASDAQ stock has been falling for two years. 
The average American stock exchange stock has been falling for a year. 
The average nyse stock is down from where it was last summer. But 
in the early fall, stocks came roaring back. The market's reigning 
bull, abby Joseph Cohen of Goldman sachs, held her ground. Individual 
investors surprised the professionals. They did not panic. The biggest 
force in the comeback may have been federal reserve chairman alan 
Greenspan. The man who once warned of irrational exuberance cut interest 
rates three times, driving the market to new heights in November.
