Ask Jeff Fager, the 44-year-old executive producer of ``60 Minutes 
II,'' whether he has long dreamed of becoming the next Don Hewitt 
at CBS News, and he shakes his head. ``But the years I spent at `60 
Minutes' were the most fun I've ever had in journalism,'' he quickly 
adds. ``And they had to drag me out of there.'' When he was dragged 
out, in 1994, after five years as a producer at ``60 Minutes,'' it 
was to move upward. Fager became second in command of the ``CBS Evening 
News with Dan Rather,'' and was promoted to executive producer, the 
top job, 15 months later. Now he is being asked to become, in effect, 
Don Hewitt II, developing ``60 Minutes II'' in the shadow of its 76-year-old 
creator, one of the few people in television news who can legitimately 
be called ``legendary.'' Fager's ``60 II,'' as it is nicknamed, must 
walk a fine line, living up to the standards of the original ``60 
Minutes'' while not imitating it. And he is forging this cloned creation 
in the wake of a passionate battle waged last spring, when Hewitt 
and the program's five celebrated correspondents vehemently and publicly 
argued against the notion of any form of spinoff of the original. 
He is also steering the format into new territory _ weeknights, when 
viewers are not accustomed to the beckoning of the ticking stopwatch 
that for the last 30 years has introduced ``60 Minutes'' each Sunday 
at 7 p.m., and will now also introduce ``60 Minutes II.'' The new 
program's time slot is Wednesdays at 9 p.m. ``60 II'' will keep the 
format of three segments a show, but one will be a ``60 Minutes'' 
piece from the past, updated. And like the parent show, it will have 
its own cadre of CBS News correspondents _ Dan Rather (who will also 
continue to anchor the ``Evening News''), Bob Simon and Vicki Mabrey. 
But it will also have an unusual addition: Charlie Rose, the host 
and executive producer of his own late-night current-events interview 
show on PBS (who plans to keep that job, too). In terms of talent 
and internal politics, many people at the network agree, Jeff Fager 
is the ideal leader, having been an esteemed producer for CBS News 
and for ``60 Minutes.'' Indeed, he is one of three factors repeatedly 
cited by CBS journalists as critical for the new program's success: 
Fager, Rather and classics. Lest it forever be seen as Hewitt's stepchild, 
the program needed a leader people inside CBS respected as independent 
and capable _ Fager. To avoid being seen as some sort of training 
ground for tenderfoots, the show also needed a correspondent recognized 
as world class _ Rather. And it needed stories, fast, if it was to 
meet the network's target of a mid-January start date. Thus the classic: 
Each week, one of the three stories will be a ``60 Minutes Classic,'' 
in which a story from past years will be updated (usually by the original 
correspondent) to see what has happened to the people or issues since. 
Although such segments may well be interesting in their own right, 
they can also be produced quickly, and having them means the new team 
must produce only two original stories each week. Only the audience 
will determine whether this formula succeeds, of course, but network 
executives are already crediting Fager for having brought ``60 Minutes 
II'' this far, given the initial resistance. Last May, when word got 
out that Leslie Moonves, president of CBS Television, and Mel Karmazin, 
chief executive of CBS Inc., were serious about starting a weeknight 
version of the most-watched news magazine on television, the entire 
senior staff of ``60 Minutes'' protested. The attack was led by Hewitt 
and the program's two longest-serving correspondents, Mike Wallace 
and Morley Safer. ``Do you want another `60 Minutes'?'' Hewitt asked 
pointedly, both to his superiors and to the news media, ``or `Dateline' 
with a `60 Minutes' label?'' Behind the scenes, meanwhile, Andrew 
Heyward, president of CBS News, and Moonves maneuvered like career 
diplomats, trying to get the three to see the wisdom in a carefully-crafted 
second edition. Some of the biggest egos in the news business were 
on the line, after all. How else to explain that the originals at 
first insisted that ``60 II'' consist only of updated pieces? But 
the objections raised were primarily journalistic: It is difficult 
enough to produce one crop of high-quality stories a week, let alone 
two. ``I told Andrew it was a rotten idea, an attempt simply to use 
the logo,'' Safer recalled in an interview. ``Then, almost as an afterthought, 
I said, `Unless you're going to take Jeff Fager off the ``Evening 
News,'' and put someone like Rather or Simon and the very best correspondents 
in the company on it.' ``Well, if they did that,'' Safer continued, 
``how could I be anything but for it?'' He doubted that would happen, 
though. Why would a Fager, a Rather or a Simon want to work for a 
program that their colleagues were already calling ``60 Junior''? 
But Heyward knew at least one key person was amenable. He had discussed 
a second ``60'' with Rather much earlier, in 1997. ``Dan was very 
supportive of the idea before anyone else, and independent of his 
own involvement in it,'' Heyward said. In fact, even before Rather 
decided whether to join the new program himself, he said he would 
give his blessing if Fager left the nightly newscast to take the new 
job. That, plus the prospect that Rather might join ``60 II,'' helped 
Heyward persuade Fager. It was ``a chicken and egg thing,'' Heyward 
said. ``I didn't feel it was fair to secure his commitment without 
knowing there was a critical mass of support and willingness to cooperate 
from Don, Mike, Morley and the rest,'' he said. ``Yet, Jeff being 
attached to the project, as they would say in Hollywood, certainly 
gave the `60 Minutes' people a measure of reassurance.'' In late June, 
after many more discussions, including some between Wallace and Fager 
on simultaneous vacations in Martha's Vineyard, the veterans were 
won over. ``There was a big final meeting,'' Wallace recalled in an 
interview. ``Hewitt and I and Andrew Heyward and Les Moonves and Fager. 
And they made it quite clear, first, that Jeff was going to be doing 
it, definitely. That allayed concerns about whether it would be a 
serious broadcast. ``In addition to which, they said, `He will have 
the resources he needs; he will have sufficient money to get enough 
top producers and first-rate on-air people.' ``And finally, we asked, 
`What if the ratings don't respond in those first six months or so, 
will they be asked to go down market, to pander?' And they told us, 
absolutely not _ repeat, not,' '' Wallace said. What helped clinch 
their support, too, was Hewitt's idea of creating the ``60 Minutes 
Classics.'' Indeed, early on the veterans argued that the new program 
should be made entirely of updated reports, for two reasons. First, 
they were already doing updated reports for ``60 Minutes More,'' a 
show on the little-seen cable network Eye on People. Second, summer 
re-runs of ``60 Minutes'' always rank among the top-rated programs 
with viewers. ``We talked about the strength of pieces we already 
have,'' Heyward said. ``Should that be the new show? Most of the show? 
Out of it came the notion of doing the single classic. ``It's a great 
way to involve them without unrealistic expectations to their workload,'' 
he said of the established ``60 Minutes'' correspondents. ``And it 
helps us assure that the overall quality is where we want it to be 
right off the bat.'' Hewitt agreed, saying that and Fager made the 
difference. ``Considering it's Jeff and considering you'll have one 
foot in our camp, we said, `We're aboard,''' Hewitt said. At that 
point, Fager set out to talk Rather into coming aboard. ``I knew if 
we could attract Dan we'd have a big leg up on the kind of person 
you expect to see when that stopwatch starts to tick,'' he said. Since 
Rather had worked for six years at ``60 Minutes'' prior to becoming 
the ``Evening News'' anchor, and since he has publicly praised Fager 
as the best producer at CBS News short of Hewitt, the sell was not 
too difficult. Simon, CBS' veteran Middle East correspondent, was 
another credibility booster. He is widely considered one of best foreign 
correspondents in the business, and he already contributes five pieces 
a year to ``60 Minutes.'' Although he says he is typically terrible 
at recalling dates, Simon remembers Tuesday, June 30, because he had 
just arrived in a remote Swiss village for his vacation, a long-anticipated 
10-day hike in the Alps. ``I walked into this tiny hostel and the 
phone was ringing,'' he said last week from Perth, Australia, where 
he was working on a story. ``I couldn't believe that work had followed 
me there. And frankly, I had ambivalent feelings about the idea, because 
of the ways it could change my life that I didn't want changed. ``But 
Jeff knew this, because he said, `I really want you to work on this 
show, but if you want go on living in Tel Aviv that's OK, and if you 
want to keep doing your five stories a year for Sunday, that's OK, 
too.''' With Simon and Rather signed on, the search began for perhaps 
the most important staff members: producers, the journalists who do 
most of the groundwork and reporting on each piece. With one or two 
exceptions, Fager was not allowed to raid people at the original ``60 
Minutes.'' But he did manage to fill about half his 22 producer slots 
with people who had worked there at one time or another. ``I phoned 
Patti Hassler right away,'' Fager said. ``She was a star producer 
for years at `60 Minutes,' had produced over 70 stories there. With 
her storytelling ability and her experience at `60,' it was important 
to have her to guide the other producers.'' Ms. Hassler, who had been 
guiding CBS News Productions, which makes documentaries for the network 
and others (like A&AMP;E's ``Biography'' series), is now Fager's second 
in command. Then came several producers from the ``Evening News,'' 
some independents and some from other networks _ including three from 
ABC News' ``20/20.'' It was a helpful coincidence that in August, 
CBS News hired Betsy West, a veteran supervising producer, away from 
ABC News to oversee all prime-time news programs for CBS News, including 
Fager's show. The search for two more correspondents began in the 
traditional way _ looking for a veteran of CBS News who had distinguished 
himself or, in this case, herself. Vicki Mabrey, who had followed 
a route once taken by Rather, Safer and Kroft, through the London 
bureau, was hired. But the other choice was decidedly nontraditional. 
Rose had worked at CBS News from 1984 to 1990, as an anchor on its 
overnight report (seen in the wee hours of the morning), but it was 
on his own PBS show that he made his name. ``Andrew thought of Charlie,'' 
Fager said. ``I took to it instantly, because I admired his work. 
He's a world-class interviewer, and he has a fantastic Rolodex _ and 
he works it all the time.'' With staff in place, Fager's greatest 
worry is replicating the journalistic caliber of most ``60 Minutes'' 
pieces. ``That's what's daunting about it, to look at that program, 
that kind of legacy,'' Fager said. ``Can we live up to it? What will 
it take?'' And though the office politics issues seem to have been 
soothed, ``60 Minutes'' producers and correspondents are renowned 
for their competitiveness with each other. The ``60 II'' team can 
expect to feel that heat. Wallace, with a sly smile, said last week: 
``I'm sure someone like me will say to someone, `You mean you want 
to go do the junior show?'' And Fager showed he is as much a product 
of that competitive culture as anyone when asked what he would like 
to hear his former colleagues say about a ``60 II'' piece. ``I want 
Don Hewitt to say, `I'd like to have that piece Sunday,' or Mike Wallace 
to say, `How come we didn't have that piece?''' Fager said. Hewitt 
now sounds philosophical. ``Slowly but surely, we all realized, `Hey, 
how long in this world of clones can you go uncloned?' '' he said. 
``If we're going to be cloned, I'm glad the father is Jeff.''
