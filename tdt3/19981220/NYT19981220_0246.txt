On the field, Percy Ellsworth spent much of Sunday with his teammates 
celebrating around him, high-fiving and hugging after his two interceptions 
and nearly another one. And in the locker room afterward, he was the 
center of attention, too. But for every happy comment from the third-year 
safety, there seemed to be a bit of frustration seeping through. It 
took only until the third play of the game for Ellsworth to find his 
way onto the field, and even less time to find his way to the ball 
and the end zone. But still, sitting on the bench for even one play 
has made Ellsworth wonder about his future in New York. Another solid 
performance in the Giants' 28-7 victory over the Kansas City Chiefs 
on Sunday only reinforced the thoughts that have plagued him, that 
he believes he must get his chance, whether it is here or somewhere 
else. ``I love the Giants and I'd love to do it here,'' Ellsworth 
said. ``But I refuse, if I can help it, to sit on the bench another 
year. I just feel like, once I start a year, maybe if I mess up, then 
I can accept, `Percy, you're not a starter in the NFL.' '' Ellsworth 
may not be able to do a lot about it, since he will be only a restricted 
free agent at the end of the season, meaning the Giants will have 
the right to match any offer another team makes for his services. 
With the Giants, the 24-year-old Ellsworth finds himself wedged into 
the nickel packages, playing behind Tito Wooten at free safety and 
Sam Garnes at strong safety. Injuries have put Ellsworth on the field 
often this season, though, and he has responded with a career-best 
five interceptions. His two Sunday came with Wooten spending much 
of the game on the sideline with a hamstring injury. In three seasons 
of part-time duty, Ellsworth has 12 interceptions, while Wooten, who 
has played erratically after signing a four-year, $2.9 million contract 
in the off season, has seven interceptions in his five seasons. Wooten's 
struggles on the field this year may represent Ellsworth's best opportunity 
to start. The Giants could release Wooten and leave Ellsworth and 
rookie Shaun Williams competing for the free-safety job. ``I hope 
that next year I'm starting for somebody,'' Ellsworth said. ``Somebody's 
going to think I'm not just a part-time player. This year I think 
I've shown people that when I'm given the minutes, I just produce. 
I think I've done it for three years now. Hopefully, next year somebody 
will allow me to start.'' On the third play from scrimmage Sunday, 
Ellsworth picked off an Elvis Grbac pass at the Chiefs' 43-yard line 
and raced untouched up the left sideline to put the Giants in front 
by 7-0 just 1 minute 14 seconds into the game. The ball tipped off 
the fingers of receiver Derrick Alexander before Ellsworth turned 
it into his second touchdown by interception this season. Ellsworth 
added a second interception in the third quarter, although replays 
showed that he was out of bounds when he came down with it. After 
initially claiming, ``I was in, I was in,'' Ellsworth said, ``I got 
a gift.'' He grabbed another Grbac pass in the fourth quarter, but 
was ruled out of bounds. As he argued his case on that one, he said, 
the official told him, ``Not this time.'' Ellsworth has shown a knack 
for finding his way to the ball in his career, something that even 
he is at a loss to explain. ``I'd like to give a great speech and 
say it's this or that,'' he said. ``But it's just something I've been 
blessed with my whole career. I've been doing it since high school, 
even in little league. I see what happens before it happens. I can 
just anticipate what's going to happen and I've been able to get interceptions.'' 
The defensive coordinator, John Fox, said: ``Every time we've called 
on Percy, he's done an excellent job. No question, there is an instinctive 
part to that position. Whether it's anticipation, film studies, or 
just the ability to judge the ball, he does an exceptional job.'' 
And he believes he will do it in a starting role next season, somewhere. 
``I've thought that from Day One, when I came in as a rookie free 
agent and told everybody I wanted to be a starter and they thought 
I was crazy,'' Ellsworth said. ``But my first game I got an interception 
off of Warren Moon. It got called back, but I make plays.''
