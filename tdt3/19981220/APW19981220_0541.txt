After braving a night of fierce thunderstorms, British tycoon Richard 
Branson and his crew soared over Central Asia on Sunday heading for 
the Himalayas on day three of their historic attempt to circle the 
globe in a balloon. ``Somebody was looking over us last night,'' an 
elated Branson told the ground crew of ICO Global, a mobile telephone 
company that is supporting the trip, after making it through the storms. 
The storms forced Branson, Chicago millionaire Steve Fosset and teammate 
Per Lindstrand to navigate through a narrow corridor bringing them 
close to three countries that had denied them access to fly over their 
territory: Iraq, Iran and Russia. Fosset, who lost a balloon in the 
Pacific two months ago as a result of a thunderstorm, shouted to his 
teammates to put on their parachutes Saturday as they headed north 
over Turkey to avoid Iraq. ``By climbing the winds blew us closer 
to Iraq. What was worse _ a possible storm ahead or the `storms' of 
Iraq? We decided to risk the thunder and press on,'' Branson told 
the ground crew, according to a communique. The balloon missed Iraq 
by just 60 miles (97 kilometers), Iran by 7 miles (12 kilometers) 
and Russia by just 10 miles (16 kilometers). ``I have never seen anything 
like this in the 30 years I have been ballooning,'' said ICO Project 
Director Mike Kendrick, saying going through such a gap was ``like 
threading a needle.'' The crew hoped to have a quiet day Monday, flying 
across Turkmenistan before heading into Afghanistan and then along 
the Himalayas, another potential trouble spot. The first leg of the 
trip has been probably the most politically sensitive, and only intense 
diplomacy overcame a last-minute decision by Libya rescinding permission 
to fly over its territory. ICO spokeswoman Lori Levin-Hyams said Branson 
had recovered from a sore throat he had early in the trip, which began 
with the launch Friday from a Moroccan airforce base. Branson and 
his colleagues, who are all wearing silver jumpsuits, estimate the 
trip could last from eight days to nearly three weeks. The crew hope 
to touch down somewhere in western Europe at the end of a 24,000-mile 
flight which will take them over India, the South China sea, the Pacific 
and the United States. The team secured permission from 97 countries 
for overflights and had only four refusals - Iran, Iraq, Russia and 
North Korea. Fossett has made four tries to ring the globe. Branson 
has tried, and failed, four times to become the first person to circle 
the world in a balloon. Improved technology has been used to make 
the balloon, including a canopy of Kevlar of the kind used for bulletproof 
vest that covers the canopy over the crew's pressurized capsule. At 
least three other balloon crews have been waiting for favorable weather 
to launch their balloon - from Albuquerque, New Mexico, Loves Park, 
Illinois and the Swiss Alps. Yet another team is to take off next 
month from Alice Springs, Australia.
