Gen. Augusto Pinochet's family will have ``to start selling the few 
things we have'' to pay the former Chilean dictator's medical and 
legal expenses in London, a news report Sunday quoted his wife as 
saying. In an interview with the Santiago daily La Tercera, Lucia 
Hiriart called reports that the family has bank accounts in Switzerland 
``pure, nonsense, foolishness.'' Asked how the family will pay Pinochet's 
medical and legal bills, she replied, ``Only God knows.'' Pinochet 
was detained Oct. 16 in London as he recovered from back surgery. 
Since then, he has been fighting in court a request to be extradited 
to Spain to face genocide and torture charges for human rights abuses 
during his 1973-90 dictatorship. Little is known in Chile about Pinochet's 
finances, but the family owns several houses. In the interview in 
London, Mrs. Pinochet said her 83-year-old husband has recovered well 
from the surgery. He is exercising and walking, and spends hours reading 
and working at a computer, she said. The extradition case has left 
Pinochet bitter, she said. He is especially bothered ``by the fact 
that this happened in a country he considered friendly. He had always 
been received well here. Deep in his heart, that is an additional 
suffering,'' she said. Mrs. Pinochet said her husband, who is a senator 
for life, had not decided whether he would retire from politics if 
he returns to Chile, as the government has suggested.
