Ethnic Albanians attacked a police patrol Sunday in central Kosovo, 
Serb sources said, adding to the upsurge in violence threatening the 
province's fragile cease-fire. The Serb Media Center said ethnic Albanian 
separatists opened fire on a Serb police patrol along the province's 
main east-west road about 40 kilometers (25 miles) west of Pristina. 
Police fired back, wounding two of the attackers. They and four others 
were captured, the media center said. The assailants opened fire from 
two parked cars, where police found a Chinese-made semi-automatic 
rifle and ammunition, the media center added. Tensions were already 
running high in the troubled province as the rebel Kosovo Liberation 
Army buried 36 guerrillas killed by Yugoslav border guards and hundreds 
of Serbs protested against the slaying of a local official whose body 
was found last week.
