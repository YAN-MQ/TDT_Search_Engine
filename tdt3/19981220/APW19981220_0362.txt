Russian Prime Minister Yevgeny Primakov expressed apprehension Sunday 
that the U.S. airstrikes on Iraq could be renewed and said Russia 
categorically opposes the use of force to solve the dispute. Speaking 
at the beginning of a two-day official visit to India, Primakov told 
reporters in New Delhi that ``we are satisfied that the United States 
has stopped using force. But we are very upset that it may only be 
a temporary halt and the strikes may be renewed.'' ``Our basic position 
has not changed _ that use of force should be only with the consent 
of the (U.N.) Security Council,'' said Primakov, who is leading a 
delegation that includes eight government ministers. Primakov is the 
first leader of a nuclear-declared state to visit India since the 
May atomic tests India conducted in the deserts of Rajasthan state. 
The tests and a similar series by neighboring Pakistan prompted the 
United States and several other industrialized nations to impose economic 
sanctions on both countries. The visit aims at expanding economic 
and military cooperation between the two countries. India and Russia 
will sign seven agreements, including one on extending military and 
technical cooperation through 2010. The two countries have an agreement 
now that expires in the year 2000. India is a major buyer of Russian 
arms. India also is setting up two Russian-built nuclear power reactors. 
Both countries have demanded an immediate end to military action by 
the United States and Britain in Iraq. On Thursday, Russia recalled 
its ambassador to the United States, protesting the U.S. attack on 
Baghdad. President Boris Yeltsin canceled his visit to New Delhi in 
January after his health deteriorated.
