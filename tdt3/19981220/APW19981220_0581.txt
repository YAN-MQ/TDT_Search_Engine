Three-time Olympic champion Georg Hackl of Germany won his second 
singles race of the season and took the lead in overall luge World 
Cup standings Sunday. Hackl battled through a snowy first run in 55.439 
seconds to take a .18 of a second advantage over his perennial rival, 
Markus Prock of Austria. The 32- year-old German rode that margin 
with a second heat time of 55.047 for a winning aggregate of one minute, 
50.486 seconds. The victory gave Hackl 309 points after four of seven 
events. Prock, 34, winless to date, was second in 1:50.578 and is 
second ranked with 290. Adam Heidt of the United States posted his 
best career finish by coming in third. Armin Zoeggeler of Italy, 11th 
in the event, fell from first to third with 289. ``I like this track 
and I was lucky with the conditions,'' Hackl said after his 20th career 
World Cup victory. Heidt, of Northport, N.Y., overcame the weather 
problems to take third in 1:50.785. ``I hit some snow banks in the 
first run,'' said Heidt. ``I was just trying to hold onto my position 
and not fall back as I have in other races. But the second run was 
really good and I was hoping this would be my day,'' Heidt said. The 
21-year-old appreciated his achievement after the final sled had crossed 
the finish line and his name was announced at the awards ceremony. 
``That is great company to be in,'' Heidt said. ``At the ceremony, 
I felt like a baby. Those guys were racing when I was in diapers.'' 
Heidt also became the third U.S. men singles luger to ever claim a 
World Cup medal. Retired racers Duncan Kennedy and Wendel Suckow were 
the others. Clay Ives of Lake Placid, N.Y., now racing for the United 
States after representing Canada in two Olympics, was 17th in 1:51.639. 
Tony Benshoof of White Bear Lake, Minn. finished 18th in 1:51.702. 
Nick Sullivan, Oakdale, Minn. was 22nd in 1:52.007, and Christian 
Niccum of Woodinville, Wash., a doubles specialist, placed 27th in 
1:52.660. The World Cup tour resumes Jan. 16 in Oberhof, Germany after 
the holiday break.
