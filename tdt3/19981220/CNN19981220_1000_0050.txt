"CNN Headline News." Good morning, I'm Judy Fortin. The Senate will 
likely become a courtroom in the new year as it is expected to put 
a president on trial for only the second time in history. President 
Clinton was impeached by the house yesterday mostly along party lines. 
The gavel calling the house to order signaled the impending vote. 
Democrats tried veinly to substitute a censure resolution for impeachment 
but in the end, two of the four articles were approved. Article II 
charging false testimony in the Jones case and article IV charging 
abuse of office did not get enough votes for passage. Following the 
vote, democrats were bused to the White House for a show of support 
for the president. Mr. Clinton says he hopes the Senate will act in 
a more bipartisan manner than the house. I have invited members of 
Congress to work with us to find a reasonable, bipartisan and proportionate 
response. That approach was rejected today by republicans in the house. 
But I hope it will be embraced by the Senate. I hope now there will 
be a constitutional and fair means of resolving this matter in a prompt 
matter.
