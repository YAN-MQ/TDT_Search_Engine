David C. Leavy graduated from Colby College in Maine six years ago 
and leapt into presidential politics: field director in the Maine 
caucuses for the campaign of Gov. Bill Clinton of Arkansas. Within 
the year, Leavy had a desk up the hall from the Oval Office, making 
him a charter member of the cocky and optimistic class of young men 
and women who lifted Clinton to victory in 1992. Today, Leavy, 28, 
is one of the few remaining people of the class of '92 in the Clinton 
White House. And as the generation that charged into Washington with 
Clinton in 1993 took somber measure of what has become of the promise 
of this presidency this weekend, Leavy was anguished and disappointed 
_ but not with the second president in the nation's history to have 
been impeached. ``He doesn't owe me anything,'' said Leavy, spokesman 
for the National Security Council. ``Quite the contrary. I owe him 
everything. Everything I have professionally is because of him. I've 
worked for him from the day I graduated college, and I will probably 
_ God willing _ for the next two years. ``I will always wear a Clinton 
jersey. Through this crisis and for the rest of my life.'' Leavy's 
testimonial was, perhaps, extreme in its sentimentality, but it was 
not unusual among the people who work, or once worked, for Clinton. 
It appears that House Republicans may have done for the president 
what Clinton could not do for himself: won him an absolution from 
many _ though certainly not all _ of the Clinton associates who had 
felt most violated by his transgressions. The anger that many of them 
once felt for Clinton has been largely drawn away by the Republicans. 
It almost seems that some members of the class of '92, including many 
he has not even spoken to in months, are ready to rally to his support 
once again. ``This looks and smells and is a politically inspired 
impeachment,'' said David C. Wilhelm, who orchestrated some of Clinton's 
early political victories and went on to become chairman of the Democratic 
National Committee. ``I'm angry about it. I think it is completely 
unfair.'' Wilhelm, recalling his disappointment with Clinton earlier 
this year, described the president as ``a good man; not a perfect 
man, but a good man.'' Wilhelm added, ``His behavior pales to the 
actions the Republicans have caused.'' Dee Dee Myers, the former White 
House press secretary who has been sharply critical of Clinton as 
a television commentator, said that ``damage being done to the Constitution 
by an overzealous political party willing to hijack it for political 
purposes is much more serious than anything Clinton has done.'' Levy, 
Wilhelm and Ms. Myers were part of a group of people who changed the 
political face of this city in 1993. They were, for the most part, 
people who had not before worked in national politics. They were Democrats, 
and they were relatively young. They were also often idealistic, invigorated 
by a campaign run by Clinton that was bold in its promises and rhetoric. 
What that meant was that Clinton came into office with extremely high 
expectations. And the prospect now that his term might be defined 
by an impeachment is distressing to people who had seen so much potential. 
``We had this moment,'' Wilhelm said. ``It was a moment ripe with 
possibility, And I guess that's the frustrating thing.'' Ms. Myers 
said: ``You can't help but have a sense of tremendous wasted opportunity. 
And in Clinton's case, wasted potential.'' Still, amid this criticism, 
Clinton's allies are stepping up for one more battle, this time to 
counter the suggestion that the president's failings have ruined his 
hope of achieving the accomplishments he once promised. ``I will tell 
you that I think Bill Clinton did a great job as president,'' said 
Rahm I. Emanuel, who was Clinton's chief fund-raiser in 1992, and 
worked as a senior adviser until this past fall. ``I am proud to have 
worked for him as a president. I am proud to be associated with him.'' 
In the White House, Paul Begala, a Clinton adviser who has made a 
career out of dealing with Clinton's difficulties, went so far as 
to argue that the president's legacy was not only intact, but growing. 
``Be careful, be careful,'' Begala said. ``Go ahead and write his 
political obit because I'm going to clip it and save it and file it 
in my two-inch thick file of all the others.'' Perhaps. But though 
the loyalty, and even some of the affection, for Clinton may be returning 
in some quarters, it is hard to find many people who have the hope 
and enthusiasm that was once so prevalent in the corridors of the 
White House. ``I would never have dreamed two things,'' George Stephanopoulos, 
who is probably the most estranged of the former Clinton advisers, 
said Sunday afternoon. ``I would never have dreamed that the country 
would have been so improved eight years into his stewardship. And 
I never dreamed of the day that I would wake up and see this morning's 
headline. Neither one can be erased.'' Wilhelm and his wife, Degee, 
who also worked on Clinton's 1992 campaign, expressed their feelings 
though an unlikely vehicle this season: their annual Christmas card 
message. ``It is a singularly depressing event, particularly for those 
of us who worked so hard to elect Bill Clinton back in 1992, to see 
the hope and promise that his election seemed to represent in those 
heady days dissolve into a morass of partisanship and wrangling,'' 
the Wilhelms wrote. ``Sorry to be so downbeat in a Christmas note. 
But I thought maybe you'd like one of these that didn't pretend everything 
was hunky-dory.''
