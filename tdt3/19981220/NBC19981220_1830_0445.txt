The scandal that forced Bob Livingston to resign had Capitol Hill 
scrambling today to find who will take his place. Joe Johns reports 
the leading contender was hard at work today. a front runner with 
no opposition was taking no chances today, meeting with members and 
making calls. Alies claim has ert has 130 house republicans who say 
they will vote for him. If true, that means he probably will become 
the next speaker, informally anointed after Bob Livingston dropped 
out. Now we fill the breech with somebody who is capable, confident, 
his demeanor is perfect. He came to Congress in 1986, a former schoolteacher 
and wrestling coach from Illinois. Folks back home have his picture 
in the high school yearbook and hold him in high regard. He's the 
kind of person it doesn't matter who you are, he talks to you. Back 
in Washington, he has kept a low profile. He's a republican point 
man on health care. He has support of Tom DeLay. He's delay's chief 
deputy. One outgoing veteran says he would make a good leader. He's 
independent in terms of who he is. Some in the GOP also hope he can 
soothe the anger between democrats and republicans in the 106th Congress. 
I think he's shown he can work with everyone. I think that's important 
with a majority. So far, no one else has entered the race. And after 
the last several weeks of turmoil, republicans say the country and 
the capital could use a little stability. NBC, Joe sons the capitol.
