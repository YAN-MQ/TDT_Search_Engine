Well, it seemed the 14 players involved in last night's charity game 
were having some fun in Atlantic City. Now, while some involved are 
holding on to hope an NBA season will be salvaged, Charles Barkley 
believes Michael Jordan, who did not partake in the festivities, will 
retire when the lockout ends. Here's M.J. Charles didn't speak for 
Michael Jordan. You know that. And when Michael Jordan has something 
to say, he will say it. And people are gonna say what they want to 
say, you know? I never was against people speaking their own opinions 
and their own feelings. And that's Charles' feeling. And I love Charles.
