President Saddam Hussein on Sunday said Iraqis have been victorious 
against the ``enemies of God'' during four nights of airstrikes by 
the United States and Britain. In his first public comment since the 
strikes ended Saturday, Saddam said the Iraqi people and the army 
have proved to be ``worthy of what your leadership expected from you.'' 
``God will repay well and crown your heart with clear victory, which 
will be attested by your enemies,'' he said in a brief speech on radio 
and television. Earlier Sunday, Iraqi newspapers also declared victory 
after airstrikes that pounded Iraq with the most severe firepower 
since the 1991 Gulf War. Iraq offered little resistance other than 
anti-aircraft guns. No final casualty toll has been released, but 
previous reports indicated that at least 42 people were killed and 
96 wounded. ``Casualties are in the thousands in terms of people killed 
or wounded, but we don't have any final figure,'' Iraq's ambassador 
to the United Nations, Nizar Hamdoon, told CNN. ``There has been enormous 
damage mainly to the civilian infrastructure and to human lives,'' 
In halting the strikes, U.S. President Bill Clinton said the 70-hour 
assault severely damaged Iraq's ability to build weapons of mass destruction. 
But the rhetoric in Iraq's state-run newspapers Sunday was as strident 
as before the assault. ``Victorious again!'' crowed the banner headline 
in Al-Musawir Al-Arabi weekly. In his speech, Saddam also criticized 
the Arab world for pretending to be ``asleep ... or sick'' and not 
supporting Iraq. ``A new aggression (was) started by the enemies of 
God and the nation. With it, the resistance started again,'' he said. 
After calling off the attacks, Clinton said he hoped that U.N. weapons 
inspectors would be able to return to Iraq to their 7 1/2-year-old 
mission to search for and destroy Iraq's illegal weapons. The strikes 
were launched after accusations that Iraq was obstructing the work 
of the weapons inspectors of the United Nations Special Commission, 
or UNSCOM. Iraqi Vice President Taha Yassin Ramadan declared Saturday 
night that UNSCOM's ``mission is over.'' In the streets of Baghdad, 
there was anger. If ``Clinton has achieved his mission, why does he 
say the inspectors must return?'' asked Ali Mahmoud Abdel Munaim, 
an unemployed 32-year-old man. If ``they have destroyed everything 
illegal, the next step ought to be lifting of sanctions.'' Under U.N. 
resolutions, economic sanctions imposed after Iraq's 1990 invasion 
of Kuwait cannot be lifted until UNSCOM certifies that Iraq is free 
of all nuclear, chemical and biological weapons and long-range missiles. 
UNSCOM spokeswoman Caroline Cross said in Bahrain that 50 inspectors 
were waiting in Bahrain ``for further instructions from New York.'' 
Chief weapons inspector Richard Butler said the inspectors must return 
to Iraq. ``There is a need to bring those weapons to account. And 
there is a need not to lose the Iraq case because it is test case 
in the field of nonproliferation of weapons of mass destruction,'' 
he said in an interview with Associated Press Television News. In 
Iraq, many were coming to terms with the attack's aftermath. Adil 
Mohammed Nori, a 50-year-old spice store owner, said he is preparing 
to drive 300 kilometers (185 miles) to the southern town of Ali al-Gharbi. 
Asked why, he said: ``To attend a funeral for a mass destruction weapon 
that Clinton has destroyed: my 12-year-old niece.'' The girl, Zehra, 
was killed in one of the missile strikes, he said. He said he still 
hasn't received the details. The Pentagon says 425 Tomahawk cruise 
missiles were fired during the campaign, compared to 290 fired in 
the entire Gulf War to evict Iraq from Kuwait. Iraq says its gunners 
shot down more than 100 Tomahawks. The offensive involved 650 aircraft 
missions, including 32 sorties by 12 British Tornado fighter-bombers. 
When Clinton called off the attack, it apparently caught the British 
by surprise. Royal Air Force spokesman Group Capt. Bryan Collins said 
four Tornadoes were en route to Iraq to bomb Republican Guard positions 
when the stand-down order reached British forces based in Kuwait. 
Collins said the fighters were recalled. The last attack came hours 
after Baghdad's residents broke their fast on the first day of Ramadan, 
the Muslim holiday that marks the prophet Mohammed's receipt of the 
Koran from God 1,400 years ago. Muslims fast during daylight throughout 
the month. Iraq's army said the missiles had targeted presidential 
sites, civil establishments, government offices, colleges, students' 
dormitories, factories, refineries and some military units. It did 
not elaborate. Meanwhile, the U.N. special envoy in Baghdad, Prakash 
Shah, said more than 100 international workers of the U.N. humanitarian 
program would return to Baghdad on Tuesday or Wednesday. The workers 
were evacuated to Jordan on Friday. The humanitarian program monitors 
the food distribution under a program that allows Iraq to sell limited 
amounts of oil to buy food and humanitarian supplies.
