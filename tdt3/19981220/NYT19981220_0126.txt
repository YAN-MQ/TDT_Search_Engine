It's known as the game ball, the actual pebble-grained leather football 
representing a team's triumph. As the New York Jets' owner, Leon Hess 
had been awarded a few game balls by his team through the years, but 
none as treasured as the ball from the 17-10 triumph last Saturday 
over the Bills at Buffalo that assured the Jets of finishing in first 
place for the first time in 29 years. ``Mr. Hess,'' Bill Parcells 
said after the victory, ``is one of the strong patriarchs of the National 
Football League.'' Hess doesn't have his game ball yet. It's at the 
Jets practice complex at Hofstra University in Hempstead, N.Y., being 
painted with the score and other vital statistics that will forever 
separate it from being simply another football. But for the 84-year-old 
owner of the Jets, it's more of a career ball. Nobody deserves it 
more. When the Jets didn't win in other years, Hess suffered. In silence. 
Unlike some other owners of New York sports teams, he preferred not 
to go public, not to spout sentences that would scream in headlines. 
But some frustrated Jets followers mistook his quietly tough dignity 
for indifference. ``Hess doesn't care,'' they often complained. What 
those frustrated followers didn't know, or didn't want to know, was 
that Leon Hess was more frustrated and more embarrassed than they 
were, that he cared more than they did. The Jets were his team, exactly 
like Amerada Hess was his oil business. And anything that is his, 
he cares about. Deeply. This is a man who started out in the oil business 
in Perth Amboy, N.J., in 1933 during the Depression by driving his 
father's fuel delivery truck, a man who was Gen. George S. Patton's 
oil-supply officer for World War II troops, a man who now, according 
to Forbes magazine, is worth $700 million. If Hess hadn't cared about 
the Jets, he would have sold the franchise long ago. Maybe the Jets' 
struggles made Hess care even more. In 1995, when the Jets were 2-9 
en route to 4-28 with Rich Kotite as coach, he was asked if he was 
thinking about selling. He never hesitated. ``Not at all,'' he said. 
``This is one of the few pleasures I get out of life, win or lose.'' 
More often than not, it was lose. When Hess hired Kotite, he made 
a rare appearance at a news conference and in a rare burst of impatience, 
he blurted, ``I'm 80 years old; I want results now.'' He didn't get 
results with Kotite, but Parcells has quickly produced results. ``Winning 
the division,'' Hess said Sunday, ``is one of the greatest thrills 
of my life, but we're not through.'' Hess had watched last Saturday's 
game at his Park Avenue apartment with Steve Gutman, the Jets president, 
and a few friends. That evening he got a call from Frank Ramos, the 
Jets' director of public relations, about the game ball and Sunday 
morning he talked to Parcells. ``I'm just thankful,'' Hess continued, 
``that Bill was able to rally everyone together. He's a great man, 
a great coach. He took us further faster than I ever thought.'' Hess 
has been the Jets' sole owner since 1984, its principal owner since 
1976, a part owner since 1963 when he was part of the group formed 
by the late David (Sonny) Werblin that purchased the American Football 
League franchise known as the Titans and changed the nickname to the 
Jets. When the 1968 Jets stunned the pro football realm by winning 
Super Bowl III, Hess was there. ``I couldn't believe what I was watching,'' 
he recalled. ``It was like David and Goliath.'' But by 1976, when 
Hess took command as owner following the death of Phil Iselin, the 
Jets were in disarray. Hess approved the hiring of Walt Michaels, 
Joe Walton, Bruce Coslet and Pete Carroll as coaches, then hired Kotite 
himself. ``A couple of those coaches were in over their head; I probably 
kept them two or three years longer than I should have,'' he said, 
reflecting. ``I had the idea the team could be run by committee, but 
it's like business. You need a strong man.'' When Parcells split with 
the Patriots' owner, Robert K. Kraft, after the 1996 season, that 
``strong man'' was available. Gutman's hiring of Parcells as a consultant 
for a year evolved into the Patriots' accepting draft choices in exchange 
for permitting Parcells to become the Jets' coach. ``Bill wanted to 
come back to New York,'' Hess said, alluding to Parcells' two Super 
Bowl rings as the Giants coach and his northern New Jersey background. 
``He never promised me anything, he just worked hard; we have something 
in common.'' And whatever Parcells has wanted to help turn the Jets 
around, Hess has provided _ a bubble for indoor practice, new grass 
and artificial turf practice fields, new weight-lifting rooms and 
medical rooms, a computer link to the NFL offices. And now Parcells 
has provided Hess with a first-place team and a Super Bowl XXXIII 
contender. ``If we don't win another game,'' Hess said Sunday, ``Bill 
doesn't owe us anything.'' But if the Jets win a bigger game than 
last Saturday's, Leon Hess will get another game ball.
