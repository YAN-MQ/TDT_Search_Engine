A funeral for dozens of ethnic Albanian guerrillas and a Serb protest 
against Kosovo's rebellious majority raised tensions in the chaotic 
province even higher Sunday. Meanwhile, an ally of Yugoslav President 
Slobodan Milosevic denounced the United States for allegedly favoring 
separatist ethnic Albanians and also criticized neighboring Albania 
for harboring rebels seeking independence for the Serb province. Relatives 
of 36 ethnic Albanian guerrilla fighters killed in a border clash 
last Monday recovered the bodies from the Serb-run morgue in Prizren 
and were to bury them Sunday. Also Sunday, about 300 Serbs in the 
village of Kosovo Polje, a few kilometers (miles) west of Pristina, 
staged a protest against ethnic Albanian separatists and demanded 
high-ranking Serb officials come to address them. The Serbs were angry 
over the slaying of their mayor, Zvonko Bojanic, whose body was found 
Friday shot between the eyes. Serb leaders have denounced ethnic Albanian 
``terrorists'' for the killing. Tensions aroused by the latest violence 
have dimmed hopes that diplomacy can head off a return to full-scale 
war in Kosovo, a province in the Yugoslavian republic of Serbia. In 
the latest diplomatic effort, a group of international officials talked 
with ethnic Albanian leaders Saturday in an attempt to bring the separatist 
Kosovo Liberation Army and the more moderate followers of Ibrahim 
Rugova to talks with Serbian officials. Rugova has said he will accept 
broad autonomy within Serbia, while the KLA is determined to fight 
for full independence. The United States has been playing the lead 
role in trying to arrange talks between the two sides on the future 
of the province. On Sunday, Milosevic ally Zivorad Igic was quoted 
by the government's Tanjug news agency as blaming Washington's alleged 
``supportive'' stand toward the ethnic Albanian ``terrorists.'' Igic 
said ethnic Albanian rebels had killed dozens of people since an Oct. 
12 agreement between U.S. envoy Richard Holbrooke and Milosevic ended 
full-scale fighting and averted the threat of NATO airstrikes. Igic 
also blamed Albanian for ``becoming the main base for terrorists and 
their main supplier of arms.'' On Saturday morning, three men appeared 
in a car outside the house of William Walker, who leads the roughly 
2,000-strong international observer mission, shouting and pointing 
a machine gun at Walker's unarmed security guards, said mission spokesman 
Jorgen Grunnet. The incident was reported to the Serbian police, but 
Grunnet said the response was not adequate. He said Walker complained 
sharply about the incident to the Yugoslav authorities who are obliged 
to protect the monitors.
