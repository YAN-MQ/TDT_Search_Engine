Germany on Sunday extradited to the United States a man suspected 
of playing a central role in the organization that the U.S. government 
said bombed its embassies in Kenya and Tanzania in August. Mamdouh 
Mahmud Salim, who was arrested in Munich in September, was handed 
over to U.S. officials at the Munich airport and left on a special 
flight, judicial officials said. They declined to reveal his precise 
destination. Washington believes Salim, 40, is a top aide to Osama 
bin Laden, who has been accused by prosecutors in the United States 
of being the leader of the group that bombed the embassies, killing 
more than 200 people. In particular, Salim has been described in government 
documents as a manager of finances for bin Laden, and an important 
intermediary in the group's efforts to buy arms and material for nuclear 
weapons. He is accused of conspiring to murder Americans abroad and 
use weapons of mass destruction. Salim denied the charges, but his 
attempts to fight extradition ended this month when Germany's highest 
court dismissed his appeal. Judicial cooperation between Germany and 
the United States is generally good. German officials said the United 
States had been obliged to guarantee that Salim would not face the 
death penalty. German law prohibits extradition of suspects to countries 
where they could face execution. That U.S. commitment could complicate 
the task of federal prosecutors, who have already said ``the death 
penalty will seriously be considered'' in the case of two other defendants 
who are widely considered to have played a far less important role 
than Salim in bin Laden's organization. The two men are Mohammed Rashed 
Daoud al-'Owhali and Mohammed Saddiq Odeh, who have been charged with 
separate counts of murder in the more than 250 deaths at the embassies. 
They have pleaded not guilty. Previously, the United States indicted 
14 people in its investigation of the embassy bombings and bin Laden's 
organization. Salim's extradition will bring to five the number of 
those men in custody in the United States. One other is facing extradition 
from Britain, and the rest are at large. The United States has described 
the two attacks, on Aug. 7, as being closely coordinated by members 
of bin Laden's group, who are said to have prepared the bombings throughout 
this year in Kenya and Tanzania. It appears possible that Salim could 
provide important details of the plot. Mary Jo White, the U.S. attorney 
in Manhattan, said this month that the U.S., Tanzanian and Kenyan 
authorities would show ``unrelenting resolve'' in apprehending and 
prosecuting ``every single person who participated in the murderous 
terrorist bombings in East Africa.''
