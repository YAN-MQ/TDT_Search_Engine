Rebel forces in Angola eased their offensive on the strategic central 
highland city of Kuito on Sunday and reportedly moved southward to 
crack the government's hold on another provincial town. UNITA rebels 
were proceeding south from Kuito to Chitembo, about 650 kilometers 
(400 miles) southeast of the capital Luanda, suggesting an attempt 
to seize the last town in the Bie province under clear government 
hold, state radio RNA reported. Kuito, the provincial capital of Bie, 
was quiet Sunday, according to RNA. The strategic city, which lies 
some 500 kilometers (300 miles) southeast of Luanda, has been the 
target of fierce battles since fighting between UNITA rebels and government 
forces flared up again this month. The army launched an attack in 
the central highlands Dec. 4 aiming to regain control of Andulo and 
Bailundo, about 480 kilometers (295 miles) southeast of Luanda, where 
UNITA's leadership is based. But the rebels were able to secure their 
strongholds and then counterattacked with an offensive to seize other 
key central highland towns, namely Kuito and Malange, about 350 kilometers 
(200 miles) east of Luanda. Angola has been afflicted by war since 
before the country's independence from Portugal in 1975. The latest 
fighting threatens to scrap entirely the 1994 peace accord that ended 
a two-decade civil war between the government and UNITA, whose name 
is a Portuguese acronym for the National Union for the Total Independence 
of Angola.
