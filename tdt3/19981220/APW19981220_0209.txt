Japan has set its economic growth target at 0.5 percent for fiscal 
1999, the lowest initial growth forecast since the World War II, the 
government said Sunday. The Economic Planning Agency also revised 
down its growth target for the current fiscal year, which ends in 
March, to minus 2.2 percent, said an agency official who spoke on 
the condition of anonymity. The new target for next fiscal year and 
the revised estimate for fiscal 1998 were approved Sunday at an extraordinary 
meeting of Prime Minister Keizo Obuchi's Cabinet, the official said. 
The low forecasts reflect the dim outlook for the world's second-largest 
economy, which is mired in its worst recession in at least five decades. 
They also raise questions about Prime Minister Obuchi's ability to 
fulfill a pledge to engineer a full recovery within two years. The 
previous record low initial estimate of Japan's gross domestic product 
_ the measure of all goods and services produced in the country _ 
was 1.9 percent, which was made for fiscal 1997 and the fiscal year 
which began in April. Japan first revised this year's estimate down 
to a 1.8 percent contraction in October. Sunday's Cabinet decision 
marked the second downward revision for fiscal 1998. The forecast 
for the coming year was made on the basis of expectations for a gentle 
recovery in consumer spending and a slight increase in spending on 
housing and public works projects, the EPA official said. The official 
said consumer spending will likely increase by 0.1 percent on the 
year, housing spending will rise by 0.3 percent and public works-related 
expenditure will grow by 0.8 percent. The Japanese economy shrank 
0.4 percent last year. A second consecutive year of negative growth 
would be a postwar first for Japan.
