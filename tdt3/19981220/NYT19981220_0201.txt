As part of his preparation to become speaker, Bob Livingston was reading 
a book by the master, former Speaker Tip O'Neill's ``All Politics 
Is Local.'' ``It's full of good, common-sense stuff,'' Livingston 
was saying the other day. ``It's good preparation for being speaker 
and a good primer for any politician.'' But nothing could have prepared 
Livingston for the whirligig of recent events. His tenure as speaker-elect 
lasted just 32 days, from his nomination by his party on Nov. 18 to 
his breathtaking resignation on Saturday. Having confessed two days 
earlier to ``having strayed outside my marriage,'' he stood in the 
well of the House during the impeachment debate against President 
Clinton and said he would not stand for election as speaker on Jan. 
6 and would quit the House altogether. There was nothing in his career 
like the leaving of it. As Livingston recently said at a college graduation 
ceremony in his home district in Louisiana, his was a relatively undistinguished 
life. He spent 16 years as a backbencher in the minority in the House, 
and then was plucked from obscurity by Speaker Newt Gingrich to be 
chairman of the Appropriations Committee. He loved it. But it didn't 
pay enough, and earlier this year, Livingston was ready to leave Congress 
and work as a lobbyist. Gingrich convinced him to stay, on the theory 
that some day Gingrich might vacate the speakership and Livingston 
could take over. His chance materialized after the Nov. 3 midterm 
elections, when the Republicans barely held their majority. Livingston 
announced his candidacy on Nov. 6, and Gingrich quit the same day. 
In all of his public pronouncements, there was nothing grandiose in 
Livingston's view of the speakership. He struggled to give rhetorical 
altitude to his fairly earthbound view of his task, which was to make 
the trains run on time. The most memorable phrase from his announcement 
of his candidacy was his promise to be ``a stay-at-home type of speaker.'' 
In his resignation speech on Saturday on the House floor, Livingston 
lamented the destructiveness of the impeachment process. ``The debate 
has done nothing to bring us together, and I greatly regret that it 
has become quite literally the opening gambit of the intended Livingston 
speakership,'' he said. And in perhaps one of his most revealing sentences, 
he seemed near despair: ``We are all pawns on the chessboard, and 
we are playing our parts in a drama.'' Livingston's friends were trying 
on Sunday to make sense of the abrupt end to his political career, 
especially on a day when it was President Clinton who was impeached 
but was still standing. One cited the confluence of overwhelming events 
_ a fear that more damaging details of his private life might come 
out, the declaration by some conservatives that he had lost their 
support, the bruises he had caused within his own family, the recognition 
that whatever followed, he was being introduced to the public as an 
adulterer who voted to impeach the president. Another said that Livingston's 
taste for power was more than satisfied. In recent days, before he 
was swept up in impeachment, he told audiences that he was a little 
nervous about becoming speaker, that from the outside it looked like 
an incredibly difficult job, and he talked about getting hit with 
a ``firehose'' of information. But, he said, he was slowly building 
up the confidence that ``a kid from nowhere'' was up to the task. 
He called himself the Little Engine That Could. ``I can do this,'' 
he said as recently as the weekend before last, sounding as if he 
still needed some convincing.
