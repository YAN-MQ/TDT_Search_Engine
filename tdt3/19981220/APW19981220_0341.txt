Michael Von Gruenigen beat Italian runnerup Patrick Holzer by 0.76 
seconds as he captured Sunday's World Cup giant slalom for the first 
Swiss season victory on the men's circuit. The moustachioed Swiss 
ace, the defending World giant slalom champion, mastered the icy Gran 
Risa course in the winning combined time of two minutes, 41.01 seconds. 
He rallied from second place in the first run, to his 15th World Cup 
career victory, by setting the fastest time in the second run. Holzer, 
a surprising first-run leader, finished in 2:41.77 ahead of Austrian 
teammates Andreas Schifferer and Hermann Maier who placed third and 
fourth respectively. The two Austrians trailed the winner by more 
than one second. Austrian skiers, who had won the two first giant 
slaloms of the season, missed victory for the third consecutive World 
Cup race, including two downhills at nearby Val Badia. Holzer stepped 
on the podium (top three) for the first time in six years at the Italian 
venue which was a favorite course of retired Italian star Alberto 
Tomba. Rainer Salzgeber and Christian Mayer finished fifth and sixth 
respectively as the powerful Austrian team placed four skiers within 
the top six, although missing victory. Norway's Lasse Kjus placed 
tenth, after escaping a near fall in the second run, and kept atop 
the World Cup overall standings.
