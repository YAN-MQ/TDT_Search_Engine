Spain's small Jewish community celebrated its first public Hanukkah 
in more than 500 years Sunday at the same spot where their ancestors 
sought protection centuries ago from anti-Semitic violence sweeping 
the country. ``This is an emotional and unforgettable day,'' Mayor 
Joaquim Nadal told the outdoor gathering seated in early evening darkness 
beside the ruins of Gironella Tower, where residents of the city's 
Jewish quarter found refuge from marauding crowds in 1391. The ritualistic 
lighting of eight candles on the eighth and final day of Hanukkah 
attracted nearly 1,000 people, including many non-Jews. ``It moves 
me to be standing at this spot,'' said Eliahu Bakshi Doron, chief 
Sephardic rabbi, who came from Israel to lead the ceremony. The celebration 
was organized by the Spanish Federation of Jewish Communities with 
the backing of city and regional governments. He said the lighting 
of the candles in the 4.5-meter (15-foot) tall Menorah holder symbolized 
``peace and love in a world of war and tragedy.'' The Hanukkah commemorates 
the story of how some 2,000 years ago a group of Jewish freedom fighters 
known as the Maccabees returned to their ruined temple in Jerusalem 
and found a small jar of undesecrated lamp oil which miraculously 
lasted the eight days it took to acquire more.
