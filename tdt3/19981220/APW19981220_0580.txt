President Saddam Hussein on Sunday said Iraqis have been victorious 
against ``enemies of God'' during four nights of airstrikes by the 
United States and Britain. In his first public comment since the strikes 
ended Saturday, Saddam said in a brief speech on radio and television 
that the Iraqi people and the army have proved to be ``worthy of what 
your leadership expected from you.'' ``God will repay well and crown 
your heart with clear victory, which will be attested by your enemies,'' 
he said. Earlier Sunday, Iraqi newspapers also declared victory in 
the airstrikes that pounded Iraq with the most severe firepower since 
the 1991 Gulf War. Iraq did not retaliate except with anti-aircraft 
guns. No final casualty toll has been released, but previous reports 
indicated that at least 42 people were killed and 96 wounded. In halting 
the strikes, President Bill Clinton said the 70-hour assault severely 
damaged Iraq's ability to build weapons of mass destruction. But the 
rhetoric in Iraqi newspapers Sunday was as strident as before the 
assault. ``Victorious again!'' crowed the banner headline in Al-Musawir 
Al-Arabi weekly. ``Iraq does not deserve but victory with God's help,'' 
said Al-Thawra, which is published by Saddam's Baath Party. In his 
speech, Saddam also criticized the Arab world for pretending to be 
``asleep ... or sick'' and not supporting Iraq. ``A new aggression 
(was) started by the enemies of God and the nation. With it, the resistance 
started again,'' he said. After calling off the attacks, Clinton said 
he hoped that U.N. weapons inspectors will be able to go back into 
Iraq to resume their 7 1/2-year-old mission to search and destroy 
Iraq's illegal weapons. The strikes were launched on the ground that 
Iraq was obstructing the work of the weapons inspectors of the United 
Nations Special Commission, or UNSCOM. But Iraqi Vice President Taha 
Yassin Ramadan declared on Saturday night that UNSCOM's ``mission 
is over.'' ``Swear by God, we will never negotiate,'' the government 
newspaper, Al-Jumhuriya, said in a red headline on the front page 
Sunday. In the streets of Baghdad, there was anger. If ``Clinton has 
achieved his mission, why does he say the inspectors must return?'' 
asked Ali Mahmoud Abdel Munaim, an unemployed 32-year-old man. If 
``they have destroyed everything illegal (in the airstrikes) the next 
step ought to be lifting of sanctions,'' he said. Under U.N. resolutions, 
the U.N. economic sanctions imposed after Iraq's 1990 invasion of 
Kuwait cannot be lifted until UNSCOM certifies that Iraq is free of 
all nuclear, chemical and biological weapons and long-range missiles. 
UNSCOM spokeswoman Caroline Cross said in Bahrain that 50 inspectors 
were waiting in Bahrain ``for further instructions from New York.'' 
After the strikes, many Iraqis were coming to terms with the blows 
the missiles have dealt to their lives. Adil Mohammed Nori, a 50-year-old 
spice store owner, said he is preparing to drive 300 kilometers (185 
miles) to the southern town of Ali al-Gharbi. Asked why, he said: 
``To attend a funeral for a mass destruction weapon that Clinton has 
destroyed: my 12-year-old niece.'' He said the girl, Zehra, was killed 
in one of the missile strikes. He said he still hasn't received the 
details. The Pentagon says 425 Tomahawk cruise missiles were fired 
during the campaign _ more than the number fired in the entire five-week 
Gulf War to evict Iraq from Kuwait. Iraq says its gunners shot down 
more than 100 Tomahawks. The offensive involved 650 aircraft missions, 
including 32 sorties by 12 British Tornado fighter-bombers. When Clinton 
called off the attack, it apparently caught the British by surprise. 
Royal Air Force spokesman Group Capt. Bryan Collins said four Tornadoes 
were en route to Iraq to bomb Republican Guard positions when the 
stand-down ordered reached British forces based in Kuwait. Collins 
said the fighters were recalled. Although that was a ``little bit 
of anti-climax'' there was a ``great sense of relief'' too, he told 
reporters in Kuwait. In the final stages of the attack, one missile 
struck near the Labor and Social Affairs Ministry, gouging a 40-foot 
(12-meter) hole into the earth. The last attack came hours after Baghdad's 
residents broke their fast on the first day of Ramadan, the Muslim 
holiday that marks Prophet Mohammed's receiving the Koran from God 
1,400 years ago. Muslims fast during daylight throughout the month. 
A statement by the General Command of the Armed Forces said the missiles 
targeted presidential sites, civil establishments, government offices, 
colleges, students' dormitories, factories, refineries and some military 
units. It did not elaborate. The strikes also forced the withdrawal 
of international staffers of the United Nations humanitarian program, 
which helps to relieve the hardships of the sanctions. No date has 
been set for the return of the staffers, Paulette Austin, the officer 
in charge of the humanitarian program, said in Amman, Jordan. ``But 
the staff is very relieved ... by the halting of the strikes. We want 
to get back and complete our mission,'' she said.
