A New York architect whose design for a Berlin Holocaust memorial 
that had been favored by former Chancellor Helmut Kohl, but has since 
been called too monumental, said he can't accept a compromise on the 
project with Germany's new culture minister. In an interview with 
The Associated Press in Frankfurt Sunday, Peter Eisenman said he would 
drop out of the memorial project if parliament votes against his design 
next year. ``If they say no, I have to say goodbye to the project.'' 
He added that he would not take part in a museum as a memorial favored 
by Culture Minister Michael Naumann. ``I would have nothing to do 
with it.'' The two men met Saturday for talks in Berlin. Eisenman 
said the talks were ``friendly and fruitful,'' but declined to provide 
any other details. Ignatz Bubis, the head of Germany's Central Council 
of Jews, who also favored Eisenman's project, told the AP he had understanding 
for the architect's position. Bubis said he is in favor of a memorial 
that shows ``acknowledgement of guilt,'' for Nazi persecution of Holocaust 
victims. But he said he would wait calmly for a parliament decision 
and ``not take to the streets,'' in protest if they voted against 
it. Eisenman's design for the Holocaust memorial, which had been heavily 
favored by Kohl, is comprised of 2,500 pillars in a cemetery-like 
field of two hectacres (5 acres) just south of Berlin's Brandenburg 
Gate. But the conservative former chancellor put off a parliament 
vote on the project until after the Sept. 27 elections, which he lost 
to the new center-left coalition of Social Democrats and Greens. New 
Chancellor Gerhard Schroeder has charged Naumann with coming up with 
a rapid solution to the memorial question and the culture minister 
has said that his new concept aims above all at educating young people 
about the Holocaust. He has described Eisenman's design as too monumental 
and a ``lanscape of stone.'' Nauman has also said he wants to cooperate 
with Holocaust museums in Washington and Jerusalem and the Leo Baeck 
Institute in New York in setting up a Holocaust library and research 
center in Berlin as well as a teaching museum. Plans for a national 
Holocaust memorial have been in contention for 10 years, with politicians 
and intellectuals arguing over whether a single, giant sculpture could 
adequately represent an atrocity so sweeping and horrific. Six million 
Jews were killed in the Holocaust.
