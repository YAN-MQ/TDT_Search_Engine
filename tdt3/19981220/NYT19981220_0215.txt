As if the season were nearing the halfway point, Karl Malone has been 
running hills, lifting weights and playing pickup games with his Utah 
Jazz teammates. He said his feelings about the labor dispute resemble 
those of most of his locked-out peers _ he thinks the owners' offer 
is a fair one, and he believes there will be a season. ``It's not 
even something I'm thinking about, that there might not be a season,'' 
Malone said before he and a group of National Basketball Association 
all-stars played a game for charity here on Saturday night. ``This 
isn't one of those games where you say, `This might be the only game 
we play.''' Tim Hardaway, whose 19 fourth-quarter points led his red 
team to victory, said: ``Come on, you know we're going to be playing. 
It's just a matter of time for them to work things out and take care 
of business.'' Either 430 players are not taking seriously N.B.A. 
Commissioner David Stern's comments about losing the season, or they 
know something the rest of America does not, and perhaps a settlement 
is close. Stern and Billy Hunter, the union executive director, waged 
an express mail war last week. After Stern forwarded the league's 
most recent proposals to the players on Wednesday and Hunter issued 
a point-by-point response on Friday, both sides said they were still 
far apart on many key economic issues. Yet most of the players who 
competed in ``The Game on Showtime'' Saturday sounded as if training 
camps would open at the latest in mid-January. To have between a 40- 
and 50-game season, the league would have to begin its season by the 
first week of February. ``To me, a deal is just about in place,'' 
Malone said. ``I was looking at what Stern sent to us in the mail. 
It's a fair deal, but some things still need to happen for us to accept 
it.'' Malone went so far as to say that the majority of the players 
would probably accept the owners' current proposal, a statement that 
could only hurt the union's leverage as it heads for what could be 
construed as the final stages of negotiations. To which Hunter replied, 
``Karl has his own opinion.'' An agreement would not be voted on by 
the union's general body until the players negotiating committee approved 
of the deal. And it should be noted that Malone's public musings have 
been more provocative than substantive. He said that he would not 
play in Utah again, but he recanted a few days later. But his comments 
reflect a feeling among the players that somehow, some way, the owners 
and players will solve their differences and figure out how to amicably 
divide the league's $2 billion in annual revenue before the season 
is lost. Stern has left for Aspen, Colo., and plans to spend at least 
a few days at his vacation home. Hunter is expected to leave for his 
home in Oakland, Calif., early this week. Neither union nor league 
attorneys expected there to be more talks before Christmas. During 
a Dec. 12 negotiation, the players made a major concession by suggesting 
an absolute limit of $10 million on the amount paid to players with 
less than seven years of experience _ Kevin Garnett, who was the fifth 
pick in the 1995 draft, is scheduled to make about $14 million this 
season. But the owners are still trying to limit the high-end salaries 
on every player in the league. While both sides are close on other 
issues, the league and the union cannot agree to the percentage at 
which an escrow system would be triggered. The players' lowest offer 
is believed to be 56 percent, and the owners are currently at 53.5 
percent. Meanwhile, a group of current and former all-stars played 
in one of the few organized games that has been held since last season. 
It was sloppy at times, but also entertaining. Some, like Shawn Kemp 
and Patrick Ewing, appeared a month away from NBA-game shape. Others, 
like Hardaway, Malone and Reggie Miller, looked as if they could play 
48 minutes today. ``It was nice to finally get up and down the court 
and see some fans in the stands again,'' Tim Hardaway said. ``No question, 
it will take a while to get all them back after this is over. But 
we'll do what we have to do to get it done.''
