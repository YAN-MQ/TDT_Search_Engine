After two years of on-and-off negotiations, a deal to sell state-owned 
copper mines in Zambia has finally been reached, the finance minister 
has announced. Anglo American Corp. of South Africa will take over 
the important Nchanga, Nkana and Konkola mines, Finance Minister Edith 
Nawakwi said on Friday. Copper is Zambia's most important industry 
and earns 56 percent of its export earnings. At independence in 1964, 
copper made the country, then Northern Rhodesia, one of Africa's richest 
nations. But decades of falling copper prices and the government's 
failure to invest in new technology turned the mines into a burden 
on the state. Recently, they were estimated to be losing $1 million 
a day. The state-owned copper company, Zambia Consolidated Copper 
Mines, is the centerpiece of the aggressive privatization program 
started by President Frederick T. Chiluba after his election in 1991, 
when the state owned 80 percent of the economy. It was put up for 
sale two years ago, but there have been many disputes along the way. 
Instead of bidding against one another, the buyers _ including Phelps 
Dodge of the United States, Noranda of Canada, Commonwealth Development 
Corp. of Britain and Anglovaal of South Africa _ formed a consortium 
to make a unified bid for several mines and their associated smelters 
and power companies. Negotiations ended in May with the government 
seeking $500 million and the consortium offering $131 million. The 
government accused the companies of trying to grab Zambia's greatest 
asset at a fire-sale price. The consortium countered that the mines, 
smelters and equipment were so old that they would need billions of 
dollars in new investment. Falling copper prices made other companies 
back out of deals for lesser mines. Political uncertainty made matters 
worse; the copper belt is on the border with Congo, which is in the 
middle of a civil war, and Chiluba's government has become increasingly 
repressive. As foreign donors told Zambia it would get no more aid 
until the mines were sold, Anglo American, which already owned 27 
percent of the state copper company, stepped in. The Associated Press 
said the deal includes an agreement to keep paying for the high-quality 
schools, hospitals and water systems that mining communities enjoy. 
The copper belt region, including some of the country's biggest cities, 
depends on them. The state will retain 20 percent of the new company. 
Anglo has agreed to pay $10 million in royalties and dividends on 
profits and eventually to invest $1.1 billion in upgrading the mines. 
It was not clear how many miners would be laid off. If copper prices 
ever rise, the deal could be a rich one. The Konkola mine is estimated 
to have deep ore bodies that could last 100 years and are three times 
as concentrated as those of U.S. mines _ but it will cost more than 
$600 million to get to them.
