The U.S. and British bombing campaign against Iraq dubbed "operation 
desert fox" is now over. David Ensor examines the question, "what's 
next?" In Washington, there has been heightened security around government 
buildings for weeks for fear of terrorism. Officials say there is 
even more concern now. The aftermath of "operation desert fox" is 
likely to include more anti-American protests like the one in Damascus, 
Syria, where the U.S. embassy was attacked and the flag torn down. 
Many Arabs are angry. The military attacks in the view of most Arabs 
were ill-conceived, quite ruthless, and insensitive. But the operation 
also did what U.N. arms inspectors could no longer do, deal a serious 
blow to Iraq's programs to develop weapons of mass destruction and 
the missiles to deliver them. We estimate that Saddam's missile program 
has been set back by at least a Year. And the air strikes made clear 
to Baghdad that the gloves are off. We will be ready, should he try 
to reconstitute those facilities or pose a Threat to the region, we 
will be prepared to act again in the future. In Baghdad, Iraq's vice 
president said that U.N. arms inspectors will never be welcome back. 
He called them the "commission of spies," and claimed the bombing 
has only strengthened Iraq's resolve. Many outside analysts have deep 
concerns about the future, with arms inspectors likely out of the 
picture, and the U.S. facing the increased cost of maintaining a force 
that can constantly threaten more bombing. Considerable costs. I don't 
think there are many other governments that are going to be willing 
to share it with the depressed oil prices even though the governments 
in the region know we are acting in their defense as well as broader 
global interest. The reality will be the inspectors won't go back 
in, we probably won't be able to justify in the eyes of the world 
more air strikes. And we're going to be back to the old-fashioned 
containment policy where saddam can produce some weapons, because 
we're not going to be able to watch him. So it will be a policy of 
containment, using the constant threat of more bombing. Officials 
here say, in their view, there was really no other choice. David Ensor, 
CNN, the Pentagon.
