Echoing the position of the new German government, Austria's chancellor 
says adding new members to the European Union will be untenable without 
reductions in the financial burden of richer members. ``We must ensure 
a just burden-sharing,'' Chancellor Viktor Klima said in an interview 
with the Austrian newsmagazine ``Profil.'' Klima also said the EU 
must ``put the brakes'' on its spending. Klima's comments reflect 
the concerns of the new German government of Chancellor Gerhard Schroeder, 
who has been pushing for a reduction in Germany's payments to finance 
the addition of Cyprus, Malta and 10 countries of Eastern Europe over 
the next decade. Richer EU members such as Germany, France, the Netherlands, 
Austria and Denmark insist on a spending freeze, keeping outlays at 
about dlrs 100 billion in the 2000-2006 period. But Spain and other 
southerners fear they will lose EU funds to newcomers poorer than 
they and argue that outlays must at least rise in line with economic 
growth, adding about dlrs 24 billion to the EU budget by 2006. Eighty 
percent of the EU's budget goes to farm subsidies and aid for poor 
regions. Taking on half a dozen poor East European countries and millions 
of inefficient farmers would break the budget unless serious reforms 
are undertaken. The leaders have set a March deadline to sort out 
budget reform. ``Without time pressure, nothing works'' in the EU, 
Klima said.
