The New York Times said in an editorial on Saturday, Nov. 7: The breakthrough 
in growing human stem cells in the laboratory with private funding 
is not only a stunning achievement, it is a rebuke to Congress for 
banning federal funding of this exciting research. Scientists are 
now poised to explore new therapies for dreaded diseases. Yet, thanks 
to a congressional ban on federal funding for most research on embryos, 
the government may find it hard to accelerate a promising field or 
monitor its ethical issues. The research involves cultivating ``human 
embryonic stem cells'' before they have begun to differentiate into 
the specialized cells that form the individual parts of the body. 
It opens the way to grow heart cells for cardiac patients, brain tissue 
for Parkinson's patients, or bone marrow to treat leukemia and other 
cancers. Such treatments are years away. Scientists must first learn 
how to nudge the stem cells to develop into specific tissues and organs, 
and they must keep the transplanted cells from being rejected by a 
patient's immune system. Thus the first use of the cells will almost 
certainly be for research. Whether the government can play a significant 
role is uncertain. At least one of the studies just reported would 
almost certainly have been barred from federal funding by the congressional 
ban on embryo research. This is a sad state given that the gains are 
potentially enormous and the ethical problems appear minimal. One 
research team used cells from fertilized eggs that would otherwise 
have been discarded after treating infertile couples, and the other 
used cells from already aborted fetuses. They literally created a 
major advance from cells that would otherwise have been wasted.
