Former Louisiana Governor Edwin Edwards and five other men have been 
indicted on federal racketeering and conspiracy charges. Jim Ingster 
reports from Baton Rouge. Edwards, his son, Steven, state senator 
Greg Tybre, and three others are charged in an investigation involving 
the awarding of Riverboat Casinos in Louisiana. The 34-count indictment 
accuses the flamboyant former governor of leading a corrupt enterprise 
whose objectives included illegal manipulation of the Riverboat Gaming 
Licensing process. San Francisco 49ers owner Edward DeBartolo and 
two others pleaded guilty to crimes in exchange for their testimony 
against Edwards that said he rejected an opportunity for a plea bargain. 
Could have made a very sweet deal for myself and my son but I was 
not going to misrepresent my relationship with him, and the truth 
was not acceptable to the government. The 71-year-old Edwards is the 
state's only four-term governor. He was found not guilty of federal 
fraud charges in a 1986 trial. For NPR News, I'm Jim Ingster in Baton 
Rouge.
