The United States has accused Yugoslavia of failing to live up to 
its agreement to allow war crimes in Kosovo to be investigated. VOA's 
Kyle King reports from the State Department. The latest dispute over 
Yugoslavia's commitment to resolving the crisis in Kosovo emerged 
when the International War Crimes Tribunal accused Serb authorities 
of blocking its work by denying visas to investigators. The president 
of the tribunal, Gabriela Kirk McDonald, called the Yugoslav actions 
"totally unacceptable and illegal." Judge McDonald said she had called 
off a visit to Yugoslavia because authorities refused to grant her 
a visa to investigate allegations of war crimes in Kosovo. She said 
the actions of Yugoslav officials had turned the Serb-dominated country 
into a rogue state. U.S. State Department spokesman James Rubin said 
the United States rejects the view of Serbian authorities, who say 
the tribunal does not have the authority to investigate war crimes. 
We agree with Judge McDonald and prosecutor Arbor's statements that 
the Federal Republic of Yugoslavia is failing to comply with their 
obligations by not issuing visas to these investigators. We categorically 
reject the Serbian authorities' view that the tribunal does not have 
jurisdiction in Kosovo. We intend to raise this matter in the Security 
Council as a clear case of noncompliance. U.S. officials say the investigations 
are permitted under the terms of the United Nations Security Council 
resolutions. Meanwhile, the State Department spokesman says tensions 
in Kosovo appear to be increasing as ethnic Albanian fighters move 
back into areas that departing Serb forces had been patrolling since 
their summer offensive. Our observers report that the KLA has carried 
out three apparent retribution killings in the past few days. The 
victims were ethnic Albanians charged with collaborating with Serb 
authorities during the fighting. There are also reports that some 
Serb police appear to be hardening and winterizing positions in Kosovo 
that should have been abandoned under terms of the agreement hammered 
out last month by U.S. Special Envoy Richard Holbrooke. Despite the 
latest setbacks, U.S. officials say the overall situation in the troubled 
province appears to be improving. Kyle King, VOA NEWS, at the State 
Department.
