White House lawyers are reviewing a Letter from house Judiciary committee 
chairman Henry Hyde. It asks the president to confirm or deny under 
oath certain aspects of Ken starr's report. White House lawyers say 
they will answer the letter in due time and as expeditiously as possible. 
CNN has learned the letter asks 81 questions over nine pages. The 
questions concern the scope of his relationship with Monica Lewinsky 
and about gifts to her. Questions also address the president's conversations 
with his secretary, betty Currie, and about his role in hiring private 
investigators. The first question asks him to acknowledge whether 
he's the chief law enforcement officer of the United States. Hyde 
says answering the questions will allow his committee to speed up 
the impeachment inquiry by calling just one major witness -- the independent 
counsel himself. We believe the most relevant witnesses have already 
testified at length about the matters in issue, and in the interest 
of finishing our expeditious inquiry, we will not require most of 
them to come before us to repeat their testimony. The committee will 
invite judge Starr to appear in public session on november 19th. Judge 
Starr led the investigation, and we believe his testimony will be 
helpful to the committee.
