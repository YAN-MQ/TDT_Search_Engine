Spain will ask Britain to extradite former Chilean dictator Augusto 
Pinochet to face charges of genocide, terrorism and torture, a government 
spokesman said Friday. Chile responded by announcing it was recalling 
its ambassador, Sergio Pizarro, from Madrid for consultations, prompting 
the Spanish government to stress that its decision to seek extradition 
was a legal obligation beyond its control. The extradition request, 
approved at a weekly cabinet meeting, had been sought by Judge Baltasar 
Garzon whose warrant led to the arrest of 82-year-old Pinochet Oct. 
16 in London as he recovered from back surgery. ``This was not a political 
decision, rather a legal obligation,'' the Foreign Ministry said in 
a statement issued in response to the Chilean protest. Foreign Minister 
Abel Matutes had earlier told reporters that the request would be 
before the British Home Office on Tuesday, leaving Pinochet's fate 
in Britain's hands. A five-judge panel from Britain's House of Lords 
on Thursday began hearing an appeal of a High Court ruling that Pinochet's 
detention was illegal because he is entitled to immunity as a former 
head of state. The hearing was expected to continue next week. If 
the panel rejects the High Court decision, Pinochet could be handed 
over to Spanish authorities. Should it uphold the earlier decision, 
the former dictator would likely be free to fly home. Spanish Prime 
Minister Jose Maria Aznar's administration had previously frowned 
on Garzon's probe into human rights crimes committed in Chile under 
Pinochet's 1973-1990 rule and in Argentina under similar military 
regimes. But the government had always said it would pass on an extradition 
request if it received one. ``We have to respect the law and the decisions 
of our judges, whether it pleases the government or not,'' Matutes 
told reporters. Spain's National Court ruled last week that the Spanish 
justice system has jurisdiction to try crimes such as those allegedly 
committed by Pinochet. The court said there are grounds to try Pinochet 
for genocide because he allegedly tried to eliminate an entire group 
of people _ his political opponents _ and that under Spanish law, 
Spanish courts can prosecute genocide no matter where it occurred. 
Matutes said ``obviously Chile does not feel the same...but it understands 
that Spain must respect its laws,'' stressing that this was a ``delicate 
matter that must be treated with prudence.'' An official Chilean government 
report says more than 3,000 people died or disappeared under Pinochet's 
rule as he tried to crush a perceived communist threat. Pinochet cannot 
be tried in Chile because he has immunity as a senator for life, a 
job he created in a constitution he guided to enactment before stepping 
down in 1990. Matutes expressed confidence that the decision to transfer 
Garzon's extradition request to the British authorities would not 
hurt Spain's traditionally warm ties with Chile. The later statement 
from his ministry said the government sought to keep the ``excellent'' 
relations between the two countries separate from ``decisions and 
initiatives out of its competence.'' The statement said the government 
hoped for ``a swift return to normality.'' For some, the simple fact 
that Pinochet has been arrested and his extradition sought is in itself 
an achievement. ``Morally, Pinochet has already been condemned by 
all mankind,'' Isabel Allende, daughter of President Salvador Allende 
who was killed during the Pinochet coup in 1973, said in Madrid earlier 
Friday. ``If he returns to Chile, he does so humiliated and knowing 
that at least seven countries have extradition warrants against him,'' 
she said. Allende was confident the British law lords would overturn 
the immunity ruling and added that, although she would prefer a trial 
to take place in Chile, she accepted that it could be held anywhere. 
``There were no borders for the crimes he (Pinochet) committed. We 
feel that in the same way there should be no borders for justice,'' 
Allende said giving the example of Chilean Foreign Minister Orlando 
Letelier who was killed in a car-bomb blast in Washington in 1976.
