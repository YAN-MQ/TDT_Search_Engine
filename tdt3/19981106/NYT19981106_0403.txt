Newt Gingrich isn't a total fool. When he tried to blame his party's 
disastrous election results on the media _ specifically the scandal-fixated 
TV media _ he was betting on the fact that if there's anyone more 
despised by the public than he is, it's the press. And while the speaker's 
ridiculous spin self-destructed within the news cycle _ it would take 
a Goebbels to make the case that All Monica benefits Democrats _ his 
underlying strategy was sound. In this election, the American people 
once again thumbed their noses at the talking heads who have pontificated 
incorrectly all year about ``the American people.'' Americans expressed 
their revulsion at the press perhaps more loudly than they did their 
loathing of Gingrich. ``Who would have predicted that . . . Democrats 
would have gained seats?'' asked Tim Russert on the ``Today'' show 
Wednesday. Certainly no journalists in Washington. Two days before 
the election, The Washington Post surveyed a bipartisan spectrum of 
13 media and political heavies for their predictions; every one of 
them, regardless of party or ideology, estimated GOP gains that differed 
only in whether they were one or two country miles off from the actual 
results 48 hours later. And who could be surprised about their whopping 
misreading of the country _ except them? These experts were, after 
all, drawn from the same pack that all year has been breathlessly 
and erroneously predicting imminent impeachment, resignation or plummeting 
poll numbers for President Clinton each time he was hit with a salacious 
leak, cigar or video inquisition by Kenneth Starr. Monday, The Post 
followed up its cracked-crystal-ball prognostications with a lengthy 
piece by Sally Quinn meant to explain just why Washington's Establishment 
is so outraged by Bill Clinton and by the public's refusal to dump 
him. The piece is such a vivid illustration of the Beltway/American 
people disconnect that it has become an object of ferocious ridicule 
on C-Span and an instant camp classic on the Internet; it surely will 
join the Starr report as an essential document when future generations 
of history students look back on this whole giddy year. Writing like 
Tom Wolfe minus the irony, Ms. Quinn begins with a vignette telling 
us what good folk Washington insiders are: they ``gather to support 
their own'' by showing up at a charity benefit that raised money to 
fight a disease that struck the family of one celebrity power couple. 
(Heaven help those who expect a handout for an illness yet to hit 
the Gridiron Club.) Once these unimpeachable humanitarian credentials 
are laid out, Ms. Quinn lets ``Beltway Insiders,'' among them journalists, 
vent their moral outrage about the president even as they celebrate 
their own righteousness. ``It's a community of good people involved 
in a worthwhile pursuit'' is how Cokie Roberts describes her crowd. 
``We have a sense of community, there's a small-town quality here,'' 
says David Gergen. By contrast, Clinton ``came in here and he trashed 
the place,'' observes David Broder, who is so ritualistically called 
the fair-minded ``Dean'' of Washington journalists that you might 
say he is the Henry Hyde of punditry. Only last Sunday the Dean went 
on ``Meet the Press'' and declared that Al D'Amato would win in New 
York. Ms. Quinn's piece also pays Starr the highest accolade _ ``Starr 
is a Washington insider, too. . . . He has many friends in both parties'' 
_ before concluding that ``Bill Clinton has essentially lost the Washington 
Establishment for good.'' The day after her piece ran, the rest of 
the country went to the polls and once again indicated that the Washington 
Establishment has lost it _ if not for good, then at least until the 
next generational turnover. (The median age of Ms. Quinn's insiders 
is somewhere between Robert Novak and Alice Roosevelt Longworth.) 
The reason the Washington media keep missing the story is that they 
are part of the story. This is the most church-going country in the 
world, but its citizens instinctively recoil at being lectured to 
like recalcitrant Sunday-school children by hypocritical secular sermonizers 
_ whether they be the many preacher politicians defeated this week 
or Kenneth Starr or moralistic Washington insiders bloviating about 
our trashy president in print and on MSNBC. Tuesday's vote was a mandate 
for all of them to shut up.
