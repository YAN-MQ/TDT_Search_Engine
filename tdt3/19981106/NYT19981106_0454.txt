Luther Jerstad, an Oregon mountain guide and member of the first American 
team to reach the top of Mount Everest, in 1963, died Oct. 31 in Nepal 
on a trek up Mount Kala Pattar, a much lesser cousin in the Great 
Himalayan Range. He was 61 and lived in Portland. News reports from 
Katmandu said Jerstad suffered a heart attack a mere 500 feet from 
the summit of the 15,000-foot Kala Pattar, which is best known for 
its spectacular vistas of Mount Everest, at 29,028 feet the world's 
highest peak. Jerstad, who went by the name of Lute, was a teacher 
with a doctorate in drama before he went into business to guide rafting 
adventures and tiger photography trips in Asia. He also ran climbing 
schools on Mount Hood in Oregon and Mount Rainier in Washington. Most 
of that happened after he entered the record books as one of a quintet 
of American alpinists who scaled Everest from two sides, intending 
to meet at the summit in May 1963. Jerstad came away with a mild frostbite 
that numbed his fingers and toes. He and three others nearly died 
when darkness fell and they had to spend the night in the open at 
28,000 feet with just their parkas to protect them when the temperature 
sank to well below zero. At that time, it was the highest point that 
climbers ever lived through a night outdoors, and only the absence 
of strong winds saved the men. Two men had to be evacuated. But Jerstad 
walked back down all the way, carrying his movie camera along with 
the distinction of being the first man to shoot a film atop the highest 
spot on earth. Everest had claimed a number of lives before 1953 when 
Edmund Hillary, a New Zealander, and Tenzing Norgay, a Sherpa, , conquered 
it and the world's attention. Two Swiss teams duplicated their feat 
three years later. The U.S. team split in two to tackle Everest in 
the biggest and best-equipped expedition yet. One fought snowslides 
and windstorms along the perilous and untried West Ridge. The other, 
including Jerstad, reached the summit via the South Col, the route 
taken in the three previous conquests of the mountain. The two teams 
missed each other at the very top but met on a southern ledge just 
below. Lute Jerstad grew up on a Minnesota farm and had not seen a 
real mountain until his family moved to the Northwest when he was 
13. An outstanding athlete, he honed his mountaineering skills on 
Rainier and graduated from Pacific Lutheran University, where he won 
four varsity basketball letters. He also earned a master's degree 
at Washington State University and taught high school. He obtained 
a doctorate at the University of Oregon and taught there and at Lewis 
and Clark College. His career as a professor lasted three years, after 
which he began Lute Jerstad Adventures in Portland, a guide service 
offering treks and rafting expeditions. Jerstad is survived by his 
wife, Susan; two daughters, Kari Jerstad of Portland, and Jana Cox 
of McKinley, Calif.; a sister, Kay Morton of Portland; and three grandchildren.
