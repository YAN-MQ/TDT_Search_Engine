With his shiny blue-and-white jet parked behind him, President Clinton 
appeared Friday in the district where he lost his first race for federal 
office. He reflected with a nostalgic smile on how he and Arkansas 
have changed in the 24 years since, ignoring the tumult among his 
Republican opponents in Washington. ``I learned most of what I know 
driving around on these back roads,'' Clinton said at a dedication 
ceremony for the spanking new Northwest Arkansas Regional Airport 
here. The president was accompanied on the podium by former Rep. John 
Paul Hammerschmidt, who as the Republican incumbent defeated Clinton 
in 1974, and who reminded the president that his political career 
began with that race. ``What he didn't say,'' Clinton added, ``was, 
comma, `when I beat you like a drum up here.' '' Later, as Clinton 
enthusiastically worked the crowd, Hammerschmidt remained on the podium, 
taking pictures of the president. ``That's my wife he was kissing, 
almost,'' he said. Pausing in his picture-taking, Hammerschmidt, who 
represented the 3rd Congressional District from 1967 to 1993, mused 
on the might-have-beens of 1974. ``I don't know whether I did the 
country a favor or not,'' Hammerschmidt said with a smile. ``That's 
still to be decided.'' The $109 million airport, with an 8,800-foot 
runway, was a longtime project of Hammerschmidt and, it seemed Friday, 
just about every other Arkansas politician. It is intended to serve 
the growing business community here, which already includes giants 
like Wal-Mart and Tyson Foods, though several people in the audience 
said there were not yet adequate roads to reach the airport. School 
buses and Wal-Mart trucks formed a protective barrier around the section 
of the runway as Clinton spoke, on a bright, cool, windswept afternoon. 
``It's not just going from here to Chicago,'' he said, ``but from 
here to tomorrow.'' Clinton seemed more focused on memories of his 
youth working the narrow, twisting roads here, and on catching up 
with friends. After the dedication ceremony, he visited late into 
the night in the nearby towns. He spent part of the evening with Jim 
and Diane Blair, friends of the Clintons since their days as law professors 
at the University of Arkansas in Fayetteville. As he pulled up to 
the Blairs' home just after 6:30, Clinton was informed by a senior 
aide, Doug Sosnik, of reports that Newt Gingrich was planning to step 
down as House speaker. Later, Clinton made a statement saying that 
Gingrich was ``a worthy adversary'' and said he appreciated the work 
they had done together.
