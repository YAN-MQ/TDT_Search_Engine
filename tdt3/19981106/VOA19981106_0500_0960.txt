The crew of the U.S. space shuttle "Discovery" is set for its last 
full day in orbit ahead of tomorrow, Saturday's scheduled return to 
earth. The astronauts are shutting down the many experiments they've 
been carrying out during the nine-day mission that returned a 77-year-old 
pioneer astronaut, John Glenn, to orbit. Much of the research has 
focused on what physical changes occur in space, especially among 
older people. Senator Glenn is the oldest person ever to travel in 
space, and NASA doctors will be monitoring how he fares when he returns 
to earth.
