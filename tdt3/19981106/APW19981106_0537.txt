Gen. Augusto Pinochet's arrest in London caused a deep split among 
Chileans, and now an equally profound division is emerging on what 
to do when the former dictator returns home. Some insist _ as they 
long have _ that he should be tried in Chile for human rights violations 
that occurred during his long regime. Others speak of forgiveness 
and the need for reconciliation. One idea appears less controversial: 
Even some staunch Pinochet supporters say that whatever the outcome 
of his legal situation in London, he should retire from politics. 
Pinochet was arrested Oct. 16 in London on a warrant from Spanish 
Judge Baltasar Garzon, who wants to extradite him on accusations of 
genocide, terrorism and torture. The Spanish government, which had 
said Garzon lacked jurisdiction for his probe into human rights crimes 
committed in Chile, approved Friday his extradition request. The government 
has called the affair a matter for courts to decide. The English High 
Court recognized Pinochet's immunity from prosecution as a former 
chief of state, but an appeal on that ruling has yet to be decided 
by the House of Lords. A hearing was to continue Monday and was expected 
to last through Tuesday. It was not clear how soon the judges would 
announce their ruling.
