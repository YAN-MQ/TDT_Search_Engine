This will seem a little tame by comparison to some people. The Dow 
Jones industrials are closing in on the 9000 Mark again. The Dow was 
up again today, nearly 60 points this time to 8975. On the NASDAQ 
market, stocks were up more than 19 points. Since the beginning of 
October, the NASDAQ has gone up more than 30%, the dow 16%. ABC's 
Betsy Stark tonight on what's driving the latest rally. The feverish 
run to 9000 has been fueled by a stream of good news. From Asia to 
Latin America, the global economic crisis at least appears to be stabilizing. 
The prospect of a presidential impeachment is fading. Fed chairman 
Alan Greenspan says the credit squeeze on businesses is easing and 
thanks to healthy American consumer, the outlook for the U.S. economy 
is improving. The economy, yes, is in the process of slowing, but 
there's not going to be a recession and by the second quarter or third 
quarter of next year, the economy will be recovering or much stronger. 
Investors who believe the worst may be over are overlooking the slowdown 
in manufacturing, and the increase in layoffs, instead, the psychology 
and the momentum is upbeat. The fear now is missing out on new gains. 
The train is leaving the station, portfolio managers and individuals 
feel that, so there's a very strong sense of urgency to get that money 
to work in the market and that, of course, is obviously driving stock 
prices higher. The Dow is about 350 points from its all-time high 
this summer, and the question now, as before, is whether stocks are 
worth the lofty prices investors are paying for them. Betsy Stark, 
ABC News, New York.
