The U.N. emergency relief coordinator will travel through Central 
America next week to evaluate the U.N. response to Hurricane Mitch 
and help determine what else the world body can do to help. Sergio 
Vieira de Mello, who is also undersecretary-general for humanitarian 
affairs, will visit El Salvador, Honduras, Nicaragua and Guatemala. 
According to a U.N. statement, the storm has affected some 2.5 million 
people and the death toll, now some 9,000 people, is still rising. 
The United Nations said Vieira's trip, at the suggestion of U.N. Secretary-General 
Kofi Annan, is also meant to attract international attention and support 
for emergency aid and rehabilitation assistance to the battered region. 
Vieira was scheduled to arrive in El Salvador on Monday, fly to Honduras 
on Tuesday, to Nicaragua on Wednesday and then to Guatemala on Thursday.
