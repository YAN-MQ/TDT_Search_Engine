AMMAN, Jordan (AP) _ U.S. Defense Secretary William Cohen ended his 
tour of Arab nations Friday with little sign of support for military 
strikes on Iraq after it ended all links with U.N. weapons inspectors. 
Cohen left for Turkey after talks with Jordan's Crown Prince Hassan 
that began later Thursday and ended in the early hours of Friday. 
Cohen did not speak with reporters, but Hassan's comments indicated 
Jordan was not keen on a military strike. It ``is imperative to find 
a way out of the current crisis and to find the appropriate conditions 
to resume cooperation between the United Nations and Iraq,'' Hassan 
said. However, ``It is important to avert in the region another confrontation 
and to settle the crisis diplomatically,'' he said. Similar public 
statements have been made by officials in some of the other countries 
Cohen visited _ Saudi Arabia, Kuwait, Bahrain, Qatar, Oman, the United 
Arab Emirates and Egypt. In a statement Thursday, Cohen's spokesman 
Kenneth Bacon said the meetings were ``successful'' and that the secretary 
``is confident that the United States will have the support it needs 
to take appropriate action to uphold the United Nations Security Council 
resolutions.'' Meanwhile, the government of Saddam Hussein remained 
defiant, even after a resolution of condemnation Thursday by the Security 
Council. Iraq demands a timetable for the lifting of U.N. economic 
sanctions before cooperation can resume. During a standoff between 
Iraq and the United Nations in February, Kuwait was the only Arab 
state that opened its air bases to U.S. and British warplanes. The 
United States has some 24,000 troops, an aircraft carrier and some 
170 warplanes and helicopters in the Gulf region, according to the 
Pentagon. Iraq's worsening plights under the sanctions has earned 
it widespread sympathy in the region. But the sanctions cannot be 
lifted until the weapons inspectors certify Iraq is rid of all weapons 
of mass destruction.
