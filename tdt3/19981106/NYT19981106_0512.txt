In a ruling embraced by Public Advocate Mark Green as confirmation 
of his mandate as a city watchdog, a state appellate court has ruled 
that the New York Police Department must grant the Public Advocate's 
request _ nearly two years old now _ to review the case files of hundreds 
of police officers suspected of misconduct or brutality. A four-judge 
panel of the Appellate Division of State Supreme Court ruled unanimously 
this week that the public advocate ``is entitled to the records in 
question in furtherance of his independent duties under the New York 
City Charter.'' That ruling upheld a decision issued in January by 
state Supreme Court Justice Edward Lehner, who ruled that the public 
advocate was entitled to the records in his capacity as both ``a watchdog 
over city government and a counterweight to the powers of the mayor.'' 
But the administration of Mayor Rudolph Giuliani, who frequently suggests 
that the public advocate's post is a waste of tax money and office 
space, plans to continue to appeal. Whether it will be successful 
remains unclear; because the decision was unanimous, the city must 
seek the permission of the Appellate Division to bring the case to 
the state Court of Appeals. Although this case focuses primarily on 
the distribution of power in city government, it is one in a series 
of legal battles in which the Giuliani administration has resisted 
releasing information that could be seen as embarrassing. Elected 
officials, members of the public and news organizations, including 
The New York Times, have fought with the city _ often in court _ for 
access to public information. In this case, Marilyn Mode, the Police 
Department's deputy commissioner for public information, said the 
public advocate's request was denied because `` Green's motivations 
are political.'' She added, ``We're going to appeal it.'' When asked 
what she was basing her assessment of Green's motivations on, Ms. 
Mode answered, ``Our feelings and his track record.'' The possibility 
of appeal did not temper Green's exuberance during a news conference 
Friday at City Hall. He called the ruling the ``most important legal 
decision'' in the history of the office of public advocate. His role, 
he said, ``is supposed to be a vigilant ombudsman, watching City Hall, 
cutting red tape and getting essential information.'' Giuliani's opinion 
is decidedly less grandiose; he has often suggested that the public 
advocate's office is more of a municipal annoyance than anything else. 
And several months ago, the mayor asked his own charter revision commission 
to consider proposing the elimination of the office. That request 
went nowhere. In January 1997, Green asked for records that would 
help him assess how the Police Department handled complaints of brutality 
and misconduct that had been substantiated by the Civilian Complaint 
Review Board. He sought the records after learning that in the first 
half of 1996, the department declined to take action in 53 of 96 cases 
in which the independent review board had substantiated and recommended 
discipline. Police Commissioner Howard Safir has since maintained 
that the civilian board's investigations were sometimes poorly conducted, 
and that the department had to prove a case beyond probable cause 
to punish an officer. The city refused Green's request, and said that 
providing the records would jeopardize the confidentiality rights 
of police officers under the state Civil Rights Law. Green's offer 
to have the identities of the officers blacked out did little to resolve 
the matter, and he sued the city in May 1997. Green contends that 
the charter grants him the right to seek such records _ which are 
not available to the public _ directly, in keeping with his responsibility 
as an internal monitor of city government. Leonard Koerner, the city's 
chief assistant corporation counsel, said Friday that the lawsuit 
raised a ``novel issue'' regarding the structure of city government. 
He also said that Green could always have gained access to the records 
by asking the Council to issue a subpoena. ``There's no guarantee 
of that with this administration,'' said Joe DePlasco, Green's spokesman. 
Besides, he added, the larger point is the right of the public advocate 
to the information. ``And now five judges have upheld that decision,'' 
he said.
