In recent years, Branson, Missouri, has become a popular spot for 
visitors, especially those who are interested in country music stars 
and other entertainers. The city is only 3,700 people large, currently 
has more than three dozen theaters and almost 80 different shows. 
Now it also has an official logo. Branson officials decided on a design 
that depicts mountains and lakes under musical notes and stars. But 
sorry, there's no guitar on the logo.
