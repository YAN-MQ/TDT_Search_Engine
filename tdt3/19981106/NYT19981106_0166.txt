In an effort to bolster public confidence in the quality of its Korean-made 
cars, Hyundai Motor America announced this week what it calls the 
best warranty in the auto business. The Hyundai Advantage, as it is 
being advertised in a $25 million print and television campaign that 
runs for six weeks, covers 1999 models with a five-year, 60,000-mile 
bumper-to-bumper warranty on all parts, the longest of any automaker. 
Hyundai's previous basic coverage, like that of most manufacturers 
outside the luxury segment, was three years or 36,000 miles. Under 
Hyundai Advantage, major components like the engine and transmission 
are covered for 10 years or 100,000 miles, up from five years or 60,000 
miles. Volkswagen is the only other manufacturer to offer 10-year, 
100,000-mile coverage of major components, but VW's basic coverage 
on all parts is only two years or 24,000 miles. Hyundai also stretched 
the coverage of its roadside assistance program to five years and 
an unlimited number of miles, making it the second-longest in the 
industry; Mercedes-Benz offers roadside assistance for as long as 
the initial purchaser owns the car. Hyundai's previous roadside assistance 
plan was for three years or 36,000 miles. Hyundai has been plagued 
by real and perceived quality problems since it began selling cars 
in the United States in the mid-1980s. Indeed, sales plunged after 
the poor reliability of early Hyundais became widely known. The company 
said its recent data on matters like warranty costs indicated that 
quality had improved but public perceptions had changed little. ``We 
thought an improved warranty would make a statement about our quality 
and get us on more people's shopping lists,'' Finbarr O'Neill, chief 
executive of Hyundai Motor America, said in an interview. The new 
coverage comes as Hyundai is introducing a redesigned 1999 model of 
its midsize Sonata sedan. For several years, manufacturers made few 
changes in warranties although many added features like roadside assistance. 
Long-term warranties were widely promoted in the 1980s, but were trimmed 
after consumers complained that many items were not covered and that 
they often had to pay deductibles. O'Neill said Hyundai had no deductibles 
on its new coverage.
