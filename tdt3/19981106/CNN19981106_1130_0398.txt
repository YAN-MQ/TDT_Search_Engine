Spain's cabinet has approved a judge's request to extradite Pinochet 
from england. The request will be forwarded to British authorities. 
The judge issued a warrant for Pinochet's arrest, charging him with 
genocide, terrorism and torture during his reign. His fate is in the 
hands of a British appeals court. A lower British court ruled the 
warrant under which he was arrested was invalid because he has diplomat 
immunity. Hearings resume on Monday.
