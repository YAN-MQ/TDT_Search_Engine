The third round of the UEFA Cup will feature intriguing all-French 
and all-Spanish encounters. Friday's draw in Geneva resulted in head-to-head 
showdowns between Monaco and Olympique Marseille and Real Sociedad 
and Atletico Madrid. Monaco and Real Sociedad will be at home for 
the first leg games on Nov. 24. The second leg is scheduled for Dec. 
8. In past years, UEFA has separated teams from the same country in 
the draw. But this time, with four teams each from France and Spain, 
and at least three from Italy, it was impossible to keep clubs apart. 
Italian clubs, which have won seven of the last 10 UEFA Cups, were 
fortunate not to have been drawn against each other. Title favorite 
Parma was pitted against Scottish side Glasgow Rangers, Roma against 
FC Zurich and Bologna vs. Real Bettis. The first legs will be played 
in Glasgow, Zurich and Bologna. Fiorentina, a fourth Italian club, 
will likely not make it into the third round. The club's second-round, 
second-leg game against Swiss side Grasshoppers was abandoned at halftime 
Tuesday after an off-field official was injured by the explosion of 
a device thrown from the stands in Salerno, Italy. UEFA is scheduled 
to annouce the outcome of the game Sunday, with Fiorentina facing 
the likelihood of a 3-0 forfeit defeat and the possibility of a European 
ban. Whichever team is selected to advance will host French club Bordeaux 
in the first leg of the third round. The fourth French club, Lyon, 
is home vs. Belgian side Brugges. Liverpool, England's only survivor, 
was drawn against Spanish side Celta Vigo, which eliminated English 
Premier League leader Aston Villa from the competition on Tuesday. 
Celta is at home for the first leg. It's the first time four French 
clubs have reached the third round of the UEFA Cup. A French team 
has never won the competition, while Real Madrid was the last Spanish 
club to capture the UEFA Cup in 1986. No German clubs made it to the 
final 16 this year. French club officials expressed frustration that 
Monaco and Marseille would face each other. ``Monaco is a team which 
is like Roma, Parma or Liverpool _ a team we really didn't want to 
draw,'' Olympique Marseille's Jean-Michel Roussier said. ``It's a 
shame for French soccer that we should be together.'' ``It's not the 
worst draw but it's certainly not the best,'' Monaco vice president 
Max Poggi said. ``For French soccer this is really not a good draw. 
It's a shame but that's the luck of the draw.'' By coincidence, the 
same two clubs meet Friday night in an important French league match. 
Marseille tops the French standings, while Monaco is in fourth place.
