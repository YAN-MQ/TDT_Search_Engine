Hundreds of mourners on Friday remembered a senior Somali aid worker 
who was killed by gunmen while trying to rebuild roads destroyed by 
floods. Hassan Mohamed Ga'al, an engineer in charge of a U.N. Development 
Office in Somalia, was fatally shot Thursday in Aliyaleh village, 
15 kilometers (10 miles) north of Mogadishu. Six of his colleagues 
were killed in the same attack, which witnesses said was carried out 
by eight men armed with assault rifles and hand grenades. The reason 
for the attack and the identity of the gunmen remained unknown, but 
some sources said there was a contract dispute between Ga'al and the 
gunmen. Witnesses also said the gunmen were seen stealing two sacks 
of Somali shillings from Ga'al's vehicle. Ga'al was oveseeing a project 
to repair roads in middle Shabelle region, which were destroyed by 
floods last year. Somalia has not had a central government since 1991 
when the country's longtime dictator Mohamed Siad Barre was ousted 
by clan factions.
