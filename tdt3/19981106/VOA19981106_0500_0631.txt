Russian agricultural officials resume talks in Moscow today with their 
U.S. counterparts on a deal to provide 3.1 million metric tons of 
food aid to Russia. The two sides were close to completing the deal 
on Thursday but a last-minute dispute over tax exemptions forced the 
postponement of the signing ceremony. The food deal would provide 
Russia with a $600 million line of credit to buy U.S. food products. 
The United States would send 3.1 million metric tons of essentials, 
half donated and the rest funded by a low-interest loan. The aid is 
to ensure that far-flung regions of Russia do not go hungry this winter. 
This has been the worst grain harvest in Russia in 40 years.
