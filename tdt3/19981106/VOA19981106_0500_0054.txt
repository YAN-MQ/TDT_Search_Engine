There's been another bomb attack on a crowded market in central Jerusalem. 
Israeli police say two people were killed and 17 others injured. VOA's 
Al Passen in Jerusalem tells us once again, the bomb was delivered 
by car. A senior police officer on the scene says the bomb went off 
in a car at the eastern entrance to the large Machane Yehuda market. 
The officer says it is not yet clear whether it was a car bomb, or 
whether a suicide bomber was riding in the car on the way to an attack 
inside the market when the bomb went off. The officer says the car 
absorbed much of the force of the explosion and kept outside injuries 
to relatively few and relatively light. Still, the car was destroyed, 
and nearby shops were severely damaged. This is the second attack 
at the Machane Yehuda market, this one coming during busy Friday morning 
shopping time as Israelis prepare for the Sabbath, which starts in 
the evening. Israel's cabinet immediately suspended the second day 
of its deliberations on the Wye River agreement with the Palestinians. 
Al Passen, VOA NEWS, Jerusalem. Israel's cabinet, which was meeting 
to consider the new interim peace deal with the Palestinians, adjourned 
after hearing news of the explosion.
