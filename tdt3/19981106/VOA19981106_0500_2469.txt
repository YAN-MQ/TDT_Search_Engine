The United States is suspending the deportation of Guatemalans and 
Hondurans as a goodwill gesture in light of the devastation caused 
by Hurricane Mitch. An INS statement says the purpose is to avoid 
undue burden on Guatemala and Honduras as those countries grapple 
with the death and destruction left by the hurricane. The Immigration 
and Naturalization Service says the suspension will last until next 
Tuesday, when the situation will be reassessed.
