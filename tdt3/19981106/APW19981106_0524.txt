A Berlin-based Islamic group that won the right to offer religion 
classes in public schools has called on the city's divided Islamic 
community to unite behind the effort. A Berlin court ruled Wednesday 
that the Islamic Federation, an umbrella group representing 12 of 
70 mosques in Berlin, had the right to organize voluntary religious 
instruction in public schools, just like Catholic and Protestant churches. 
The decision has unleashed controversy not only from German conservatives 
skeptical of moves toward what they term ``multiculturalism,'' but 
also from two other Islamic associations that consider the Islamic 
Federation too radical. Its chairman, Nail Dural, also serves as vice 
chairman of Milli Gorus, a group that advocates creating an Islamic 
state in Turkey. The liberal Turkish Union called on Berlin's Muslim 
parents to keep their children out of the religion classes, which 
are expected to begin when the new school term opens next August. 
``The Islamic Federation is not a religious organization, but a political 
one,'' Turkish Union chairman Kenan Kolat told the BZ newspaper. But 
the court, overturning a lower court's ruling, found that the Islamic 
Federation's members represented a broad enough spectrum of Islam 
to qualify it to be accepted by the school system as a religious community. 
Religious classes are mandatory in most German states, but voluntary 
in Berlin and two other states. The classes generally deal with Catholic 
and Protestant teachings, however, North Rhine-Westphalia has offered 
courses on Islam since 1986. In Berlin, the Islamic Federation called 
in a statement late Thursday on all Islamic groups to join them in 
``putting together the religion lessons and filling them with life.'' 
Although Germany has by far the largest population of foreigners in 
Europe _ 7 million, including 2 million Turks _ it has long had difficulties 
coming to terms with the increasingly multiethnic nature of German 
society, especially in big cities like Berlin. In an attempt to promote 
integration, Germany's newly elected center-left government last month 
announced plans to make it easier for foreigners living here to acquire 
German citizenship. Berlin's commissioner of foreign affairs, Barbara 
John, welcomed the court ruling as another step toward promoting integration 
and overcoming prejudices among some Germans who view Islam as a militant 
threat. She also called on all three Islamic groups to form a single 
group that can work out a lesson plan with school officials modeled 
on those taught by the Christian churches. But Berlin's conservative 
interior minister, Joerg Schoenbohm, criticized the ruling as contradictory 
to Germany's western cultural tradition.
