The Dallas Cowboys' Deion Sanders spent more time in the New York 
Giants' end zone than any Giants player during the first meeting between 
the teams this season. In a humiliating 31-7 loss to the Cowboys on 
``Monday Night Football'' on Sept. 21, the Giants floundered as Sanders 
took a punt and weaved 59 yards for a touchdown. And that wasn't all. 
Sanders also helped open a 24-7 lead in the third quarter with a 55-yard 
pass reception in key a touchdown drive and then ended the scoring 
in the fourth quarter with an 80-yard interception return for a touchdown. 
Looking back, the Giants can easily recognize their mistakes. The 
punt was intended to hug the sideline, but Brad Maynard misplaced 
the ball and it went only 37 yards, right down the middle of the field 
with a hang time of only 2.8 seconds. On the interception, a Giants 
receiver fell down. But the common denominator was that every one 
of the mistakes provided an opportunity, and Sanders took advantage. 
So it was only natural that the Giants (3-5) paid special attention 
to special teams for their rematch against the Cowboys (5-3) in Texas 
on Sunday. ``He made a play,'' coach Jim Fassel said. ``That's what 
great players do. When they're presented an opportunity to make a 
play, they make plays. We'll do everything we can to keep him out 
of the end zone. I'm not going to divulge what I'm going to do with 
our punt team, but it's pretty obvious we don't want his hands on 
the ball.'' Larry MacDuff, the special teams coach, added: ``I don't 
want this guy to be made out to be some superhuman being that can't 
be stopped because he certainly can. But he makes you pay for mistakes. 
He's done that on offense; he's done that on defense. Put the ball 
in the wrong place and he slices it and goes. There's going to be 
times every week that he gets his hands on the ball and then it's 
an 11-man proposition. The punter is a big factor involved in that, 
but the other guys, as far as protection and coverage, it's a team 
thing. It's a total unit of 11 guys doing their jobs.'' The Giants 
are not the only team that has been caught in Sanders' whirlwind this 
season. Already, he has returned punts of 69, 60, 59 and 43 yards 
this season, as well as a 70-yard touchdown that was called back. 
``He's one of the most amazing athletes that I've ever been around,'' 
the Cowboys first-year head coach Chan Gailey, said. ``Great things 
just seem to happen around him, and after a while you have to realize 
that it's no coincidence.'' Strahan's Back Improving Michael Strahan 
practiced for the first time this week after back spasms forced him 
out of the lineup after only two plays last Sunday. Even though he 
felt better than he had all week, he is uncertain whether he will 
be able to play Sunday. ``I feel a lot better than I did yesterday,'' 
Strahan said. ``Every day has gotten better. I'm glad we have a couple 
more days before the game because it gives me an opportunity to play. 
At this point, I don't think I could go out there and do every play 
or every down. I don't know if my back would hold up. I don't know 
if the muscles in my back would get tired. The way it felt today, 
maybe I can do spot duty. ``If my back is messed up I'm not doing 
myself or the team any good if I play hurt. It would be great if it 
was something that I could say, `Oh, my knee is a little twisted or 
my ankle is a little sore and I could go out there and chance it.' 
But with a back, it's something that can affect not only football, 
it will affect me getting up and walking around my house. It's not 
like an ankle where I can limp around a little bit until it gets better. 
``If it's messed up I won't play. Right now, it's better. I don't 
know if I'm playing or not.''
