Yankees will defend their 1998 title with their world series MVP. 
New York reportedly agreeing to a three-year deal with free agent 
third baseman Scott brosius for just under $16 million. Brosius batted 
.300 last season with 19 home runs and 98 RBIs. Sammy Sosa just refuses 
to stop chasing Mark McGwire. The cubs slugger went deep this morning 
when his all-star team beat the yomiuri giants, 4-1, in Japan. Curt 
Schilling went five scoreless innings to pick up the win. Trevor Hoffman
