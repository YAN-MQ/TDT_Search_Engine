Stocks are making small gains after dropping in Negative ground from 
the open. The Dow industrials, trying to extend yesterday's 132-point 
rally, with no major news moving the markets so far. One analyst predicts 
stellar gains for the market averages. We can look at 1250, for example, 
as a possible new high on the S&P early in the first half of next 
year. That takes you to the Dow about 9800 or so, then you can really 
have a Hoopla for the Dow -- 10000 if you want.
