Heavy rains in western Ukraine have now flooded more than 100 towns 
and villages, officials said Friday. A total of 107 small towns villages 
and two cities were flooded in the Zakarpattia region, while 11 settlements 
in the Lviv region were hit, the Emergency Situations Ministry said. 
Floods and landslides have damaged roads, railways and electricity 
lines in the region, and several villages in remote areas have become 
unreachable by road, the ministry said. About 3,000 people have been 
evacuated from the settlements as of Thursday, but no casualties were 
reported. President Leonid Kuchma was expected to visit Zakarpattia 
on Friday, where more than 2,500 people supervised by Emergency Situations 
Minister Valeriy Kalchenko were working to repair the damages. State 
emergency officials have been told to calculate losses incurred by 
the floods so that the Cabinet can allocate money from its reserve 
fund. The government has already allocated 1.2 million hryvna (dlrs 
350,000) for repair works.
