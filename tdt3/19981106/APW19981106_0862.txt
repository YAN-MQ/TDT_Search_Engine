DaimlerChrysler shares will start trading Nov. 17 on the Frankfurt 
and New York stock exchanges, under the stock symbol DCX, Daimler-Benz 
announced Friday. Also Friday, Daimler ended its six-week stock swap, 
during which shareholders could exchange Daimler shares for new Daimler-Chrysler 
ones. Shareholders received one extra share for every 200 they swapped. 
About 97 percent of shareholders participated during the first four 
weeks. Unswapped Daimler shares will remain on stock exchanges _ even 
after the DaimlerChrysler merger _ because of lawsuits pending from 
Daimler shareholders protesting the merger, a Daimler-Benz spokesman 
said. The lawsuits do not pose a threat to the merger of the German 
auto giant with U.S. carmaker Chrysler Corp. Daimler shareholders 
who did not voluntarily swap their shares will receive a lower dividend 
payment.
