Pig farmers blocked roads and held noisy rallies across France Friday 
to protest plunging prices and to demand rapid distribution of government 
aid. Four thousand farmers rallied in the city of Rennes, Britanny. 
A delegation of pork producers was to meet with local authorities. 
A rally was also being held in Bailleul, northern France, where dozens 
of farmers at midday set tires and haystacks on fire. Other rallies 
were planned in Montauban and Lyon. In northern France, traffic was 
snarled on a major highway after farmers deliberately drove slowly 
and blocked access roads between Dunkirk and Lille. Farmers have been 
squeezed for months by the price of pork, which was selling Friday 
at 5.18 francs (95 cents) a kilo (2.2 pounds), about 4 francs (70 
cents) below production costs. They say they can't cover their costs 
with such low prices, caused by falling demand and overproduction. 
The French government said Tuesday it would provide 150 million francs 
(dlrs 27 million) in extra aid to the producers. The farmers said 
Friday they would not tolerate any delay. ``Since the end of 1997 
I've been losing money,'' said Pierre Hughes, a pig farmer from Fletres. 
``I had put some money aside, but if this continues the banks will 
cut off my allowance.''
