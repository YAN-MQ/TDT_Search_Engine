Finally, researchers from the University of North Carolina at Chapel 
Hill have discovered a new set mechanism for our circadian body clocks. 
These clocks, driven by light and darkness, calibrate the 24-hour 
rhythms of our bodies. These were once thought to be set by pigments 
in the eye's retina. So how do blind people manage? In the "Proceedings 
of the National Academy of Sciences," the researchers described a 
new set of light-sensitive pigments found in cells all over the body 
that send circadian signals to the brain. So sightless or not, we 
all march to the same drummer. Well, that's it for today. I'm Brian 
Sislack, inviting you to join me next time for another edition of 
Science World.
