In Washington, federal regulators seem determined to find a way so 
that parents most parents for that matter, secure their children safely 
in a car. They are expected to announce a standard system for children's 
car safety seats. Her's ABC's Lisa Stark. Child safety seats dramatically 
decreased the risk of serious injury or death in a car crash. But 
right now, with hundreds of different vehicle and safety seat designs, 
hooking the seats in properly can be a nightmare. The government estimates 
up to 80% of the seats are not attached as securely as they should 
be, leaving as they should be. That was the case with 3-year-old Dana 
Hutchinson, who died in a crash when her car seat flipped forward, 
even though it was belted in. What we learned a few days later was 
that the car seat she was in and the seat belt in the vehicle were 
not compatible. The new system will require car makers to -- new child 
safety seats will be redesigned to attach to these anchors. Also required, 
a tether, to lock in the child seat at the top. Because it is going 
to be easier to use, it encourages people who don't use child restraints 
today to use them. And for those who do use them currently, it is 
going to make it a lot easier for them to be installed correctly. 
Automakers say the new devices won't add to the price of a car, but 
the price of a child seat could increase from $30 to $100. Lisa Stark, 
ABC News, Washington.
