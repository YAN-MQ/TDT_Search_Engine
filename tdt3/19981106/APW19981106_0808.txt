The shell-cratered roads of this border town were deserted but for 
armed fighters, and shops were padlocked shut after Ethiopian civilians 
fled another round of Eritrean shelling. ``We are waiting to regain 
what we've lost,'' Gebremichael Gebreyesus, an elderly militiaman 
toting a machine gun and nursing a shrapnel wound, said Thursday. 
Sporadic fighting has erupted on three fronts in the past two weeks, 
although Ethiopia and Eritrea have agreed to try to settle their six-month 
border conflict this weekend in Burkina Faso. This latest attempt, 
hosted by the Organization of African Unity, followed several failed 
efforts by the OAU as well as U.S. and Rwandan officials. Eritrean 
gunners on Tuesday pummeled Shiraro, 1,000 kilometers (625 miles) 
northwest of the capital Addis Ababa, killing at least nine people. 
When the artillery duel stopped, civilians rounded up a few possessions 
and their livestock to flee to the bush and nearby settlements. Only 
about 200 people, mostly soldiers and militiamen, stayed behind in 
this once-bustling town of 18,000. Animal pens were empty. House were 
boarded up. A few houses and a bar hit by mortars were in shambles. 
Ethiopian authorities have refused to comment on the shelling of Shiraro, 
which has not been reported in state-run media. The incident is awkward 
for the government, which wants to avoid political pressure from Tigray 
Province, bordering Eritrea. Prime Minister Meles Zenawi's government 
gets most of its support from his native Tigray, and its people have 
been pressing the government to chase away the Eritreans. The shelling 
Tuesday was the second of Shiraro since Oct. 24. On Wednesday, Adigrat, 
600 kilometers (370 miles) north of Addis Ababa, was shelled by long-range 
artillery, killing one person and wounding an unknown number, a reliable 
source said. Government spokeswoman Selome Tadesse refused to comment. 
Eritrea previously bombed Adigrat on June 11, killing four people. 
Eritrean officials said bombers were sent in retaliation after the 
Ethiopians bombed the airport in the capital, Asmara. On Oct. 29, 
Eritrean and Ethiopian troops exchanged artillery fire across their 
disputed border at Zala Ambessa, an Ethiopian border town now controlled 
by Eritrean troops. No casualty figures were available. Eritrea fought 
a 30-year war against Ethiopia and was granted independence in 1993, 
but the border between the two countries has never been officially 
demarcated.
