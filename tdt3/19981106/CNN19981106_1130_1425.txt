Evangelist Billy Graham will turn 80 tomorrow. For decades, his crusades 
have attracted tens of thousands of devoted followers. He has also 
been a spiritual adviser to several U.S. presidents. Although he has 
Parkinson's disease, Graham has two crusades scheduled for next year. 
He plans to celebrate his birthday at a quiet lunch with his family.
