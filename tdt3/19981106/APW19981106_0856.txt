Turkey imposed new navigation rules for the Bosporus effective Friday 
in a bold move to eliminate competitors in the race to carry Caspian 
Sea oil to world markets. Bosporus Strait is the sole access to the 
Mediterranean for tankers sailing from Black Sea, from which two main 
competitors, Georgia and Russia, propose to ship the Caspian oil. 
While pushing for a pipeline through its territory, Turkey opposes 
the shipment of Caspian oil through Bosporus, fearing tanker collisions. 
The new rules empowers Turkey to stop traffic according to the currents 
in the strait, stop any ship on legal grounds, require more ships 
to take local pilots, impose traffic regulations on military ships 
and demand more advance notice for the passage of ships depending 
on the size of ships or type of cargo. ``It would also make the Bosporus 
option as the main export route for Caspian oil economically irrational,'' 
State Minister Burhan Kara, in charge of maritime affairs, said. He 
said Turkey also retains the right to increase the current transit 
fees five-fold. Russia criticized a similar crackdown in 1994, saying 
that it violates the 1936 Montreux Convention which requires that 
during peacetime all ships have freedom of passage in the straits, 
``by day and by night, under any flag and with any cargo, without 
any formalities.'' Kara's announcement coincided with a meeting of 
Turkish and Azeri delegations in Istanbul to put the final touches 
on agreements for the construction of a pipeline that would carry 
Caspian Sea oil to a Turkish Mediterranean port. Under the agreements, 
Azerbaijan, Georgia and Turkey, whose territory the pipeline would 
cross, give official consent to the project. ``We expect to finalize 
the host-country and inter-governmental agreements by next week,'' 
Yurdakul Yigitguden, undersecretary of the energy ministry, said. 
``We want them to be realized as soon as possible.'' Turkey and four 
former Soviet republics, Azerbaijan, Kazakstan, Uzbekistan and Georgia 
signed a declaration in Ankara Oct. 29 supporting the Turkish proposal, 
which is backed by the United States. Representatives from an international 
oil consortium that will chose the export route were also taking part 
in the Istanbul meeting. The consortium is expected to announce its 
decision next month.
