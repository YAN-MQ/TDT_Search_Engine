Anytime you turn on the ``The X Files,'' you are bound to be struck 
by the distinctive look: murky, mysterious and just a little bit threatening. 
As the biggest hit on the Fox network enters its sixth season on Sunday, 
the same words might be used for its future. ``The X-Files'' has reached 
an age at which many highly regarded television shows have been known 
to start losing their way. Plus it finds itself in a position no television 
show has ever been in before: following up a big-budget Hollywood 
movie packed with action scenes and the spectacular takeoff of a giant 
spaceship in Antarctica, part of an elaborately constructed plot that 
extended the story line of the television series. If the burden of 
serving as a 22-episode sequel to a movie were not enough of a challenge, 
``The X-Files'' is coming out of a summer in which ratings for its 
repeat episodes have drastically fallen off, most likely as a result 
of the multiple exposure of early episodes on cable and broadcast 
channels. Chris Carter, the creator, producer and chief mythologizer 
of ``The X-Files,'' is fully aware of what is at stake. ``The truth 
is, the movie was a calculated risk,'' he said. The studio behind 
the movie and the television series, 20th Century Fox, was clearly 
looking to create a movie franchise akin to the one started by another 
television show with extraterrestrial themes, ``Star Trek.'' Based 
on the results of ``The X-Files'' movie, with an $85 million domestic 
box-office total, the jury is still out on that prospect. ``You always 
take the chance of damaging the series, because if the movie fails, 
people might not come back to the show,'' Carter said. ``You could 
never recover if you did not do a good movie. But we didn't let that 
happen.'' Of course, Carter will find that out for sure on Sunday, 
when ``The X-Files'' returns to the weekly television wars, trying 
to maintain momentum while recapping last season's final episode as 
well as the movie, complete with selected scenes in letter-box format. 
More than a future movie franchise is riding on the series' continued 
success. ``The X-Files,'' the last show to start again in this television 
season, is the last hope to provide consistent quality in what is 
being widely called a disastrously disappointing new season. It is 
also being counted on heavily by the suddenly struggling Fox network 
that needs the buzz that surrounded previous ``X-Files'' premieres 
to ignite a ratings comeback. Aware of the pressure, Carter dismisses 
its impact on the work he is doing on the show. ``All I can do is 
a good job; it's as simple and as difficult as that,'' he said. ``We're 
all saying, with nine shows done, that this feels like it could possibly 
be the best year yet.'' It might have to be, with all the expectations 
it is carrying. Ted Harbert, the former chief programmer at ABC and 
now a television executive with the Dreamworks studio, said: ``If 
they maintain the quality and still tell great stories, they'll be 
fine. If not, it could start to erode away like any other show that 
starts to age.'' The movie is an unpredictable complication. Carter 
spent five years weaving intricate strands of often dense story elements 
_ suggestions of alien abductions, hints of government conspiracies 
_ usually offering just enough new information to keep fans intrigued 
and confused at the same time. Then came the movie, and Carter recognized 
that he had to tell a separate big story that satisfied the longing 
for some definitive solutions to the show's many mysteries while attracting 
_ and not utterly befuddling _ moviegoers unfamiliar with the television 
show. And it all had to be done in the hiatus between the fourth and 
fifth season, before last season's episodes had even been created. 
``It was all fresh ground for us,'' Carter said in a telephone interview. 
``We had to plan long in advance. Of course, we also had all sorts 
of unforeseen variables like how the film would be edited.'' Harbert 
noted that the difference between movie storytelling and television 
storytelling would be instantly apparent. ``The requirements of the 
movie arena demand such big action elements,'' Harbert said. ``That's 
so different from the intimate kind of storytelling you can do on 
television.'' Carter said Sunday's episode was ``a synthesis of the 
finale and the movie, a crystallization of the mythology of the show.'' 
Mythology has been his word for those episodes of ``The X-Files'' 
that update the alien-conspiracy premise, which began with the initial 
quest of the show's main character, the FBI agent Fox Mulder (David 
Duchovny), to learn the fate of his sister, who as a child was abducted 
by aliens, or so he has believed. His partner, Dana Scully (Gillian 
Anderson), a doctor, has been the voice of scientific reason, demanding 
empirical evidence of Mulder's encounters with the paranormal. Though 
Carter said that he had never created more than four or five mythology 
episodes per season and that ``the rest are just good scary episodes'' 
that stand alone, it has been the mythology shows that have always 
driven the ratings to their peaks, largely because it was these shows 
that inspired the original cult following for the series. The following 
has been intense, and not unlike that for other cult shows of other 
generations: the ``Twin Peaks'' phenomenon of the early 1990s, the 
``Prisoner'' cult of the late 1960s and, of course, the ``Star Trek'' 
mania of the 1960s and beyond. At least in terms of first-run episodes 
most of these television obsessions were short-lived: one season for 
``Twin Peaks,'' one for ``The Prisoner'' and three seasons for the 
original ``Star Trek.'' ``The X-Files'' has easily outdone the others, 
though in network television's diminished empire a cult-size audience 
is nothing to sneeze at. But ``The X-Files'' has grown into something 
much bigger than a mere cult hit: It is routinely one of the Emmy-nominated 
shows for best drama. Its writing and acting have won awards. It is 
critically accepted as one of the best shows of any kind on television. 
Still, its continuing cult appeal is evident in its numerous Web sites, 
where plot developments are parsed like the Dead Sea Scrolls, and 
the sales of books, T-shirts and memorabilia, much of which is sold 
at fan conventions held regularly. Those elements keep ``The X-Files'' 
television show in the same league as ``Star Trek,'' which blazed 
the path in converting characters created for television into a big 
box-office movie franchise. In the biggest leap made in the film the 
alien invasion plot that had been only dimly decipherable in the series 
was given reasonably full credence: Mulder actually saw aliens and 
Scully was kidnapped by them. Carter said the new season would not 
back away from those revelations, though new twists would be piled 
on top of them. ``When the show began, I told Fox executives that 
we would not see aliens for five years,'' Carter said. The time is 
up. Aliens do appear this season. Sunday's episode also gives details 
of both the film and last season's finale, which introduced a mind-reading 
child named Gibson Praise. Recapping that episode is almost as important 
as recapping the movie, because few viewers saw the repeat when it 
was broadcast a few weeks ago; the ratings for repeats of ``The X-Files'' 
this summer dropped off severely. Carter accounted for this by pointing 
out that this was the first summer ``The X-Files'' had to compete 
with multiple showings of its old episodes. But Fox's network competitors 
will be watching the ratings carefully this season to see if the added 
exposure of episodes in syndication will damage the ``X-Files'' franchise. 
One programmer from a rival network pointed to ratings from the last 
several episodes last season as giving some hints of possible problems 
to come for the series. He said the problems might be compounded if 
the movie left some of the longtime fans of the series as cold as 
the Antarctic scenes. Harbert says he doesn't believe that will happen. 
``I don't think it will matter at all, as long as the shows continue 
to be good,'' he said, though he added, ``I imagine the film didn't 
quite live up to expectations.'' That is not how Carter sees it. ``The 
film made $150 million worldwide and $85 million domestically,'' he 
said. ``I think that means it was a very successful movie for Fox.'' 
``The movie was very big with fans of the show and it was successful 
with nonfans, though maybe not quite as successful as some people 
expected,'' he added. Whatever the final assessment of the film, it 
amounted to an enormous complication in Carter's professional life, 
which already rivals that of a mach-speed juggler. He directed the 
movie through the spring and summer of 1997 (after writing it in partnership 
with Frank Spotnitz) while planning last season's episodes and, from 
afar, supervising production of his other Fox show, ``Millennium.'' 
In addition, this season he has decided to inject himself back into 
the day-to-day running of ``Millennium,'' and his new contract with 
Fox calls for him to develop a third series for the network for next 
fall. ``It's kind of what I bargained for,'' Carter said. ``This is 
the life I've chosen.'' As for the future, Carter said it was not 
likely that ``The X-Files'' would go beyond a seventh year. ``The 
stars' contracts don't go beyond that,'' he said. He does know the 
end he is moving toward. ``I'll resolve the question of what happened 
to Mulder's sister in the series finale,'' he said. There is other 
unfinished business to attend to before that, however. ``At some point 
we will do another film,'' Carter said. ``I had hoped to do it this 
coming summer, but with my current schedule I've given that up. But 
we'll definitely do another.''
