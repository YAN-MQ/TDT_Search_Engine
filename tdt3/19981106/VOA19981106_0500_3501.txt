In Loveland, Colorado, Murphy the dog is helping to teach psychology 
to high school students. Teacher Lindsey Morgan uses her dog, who's 
a mix of German shepherd and Rottweiler, to demonstrate learning techniques. 
Ms. Morgan holds a clicker in her hand, and Murphy knows a treat's 
coming as soon as it sounds. Well, the teacher found out that bringing 
a dog to class gets the attention of students, all right. Her lessons 
about the training process seem to be sinking in too. One student 
says she wants to try the conditioning technique on her pet ferret.
