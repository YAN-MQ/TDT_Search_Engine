The first of seven non-PGA tournaments is under way in Brazelton, 
Georgia. Dave Myer has the results of the first round of the Sarazen 
World Open. American veteran Bob Tway birdied three of his final four 
holes to earn a one-shot advantage following round one of the Sarazen 
World Open. Tway, who captured the American PGA 12 years ago, now 
owns a one-stroke edge over Edward Friat. I think that's what we all 
strive for is to have a chance to win golf tournaments. So you don't 
win after the first day, but you get off to a good start and keep 
playing, and the weather is going to get worse, and that was going 
to play tough, so you just play as well as you can. Bryant was five 
under at his night en route to a round of 67. Two-time Masters champion 
Bennard Longer and New Zealand's Greg Turner shared third place at 
four under par after matching 68s, Turner no doubt celebrating his 
selection to the International President's Cup Team. Deadlocked at 
minus three are six players from five nations. Zimbabwe's Mark McNulty, 
Scotland's Andrew Coltard, Sweden's Lars Tingval, Argentina's Ricardo 
Gonzales, and Americans Brad Faxon and Christian Charnook. But with 
one round in the books, Bob Tway leads the Sarazen World Open by one 
stroke. For VOA SPORTS, I'm Dave Myer at the Sarazen World Open.
