Mitsubishi is cutting up to 1,000 jobs in Illinois and California, 
under a Major restructuring plan. That's about 20% of Mitsubishi's 
U.S. workforce. They will be eliminated in the next two years. The 
Japanese automaker will also reduce the number of models it now offers 
by 40%. These moves come, as Mitsubishi reports heavy losses for the 
first half of this year. Mitsubishi says it's been hit hard by the 
economic crisis in Asia and a Sharp drop in car sales in Japan.
