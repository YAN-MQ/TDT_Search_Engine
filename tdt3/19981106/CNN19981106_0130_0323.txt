President Clinton says Iraq must comply immediately with a new U.N. 
security council resolution -- no ifs, ands or buts. The resolution, 
passed unanimously Thursday, demands Iraq resume cooperation with 
U.N. weapons inspectors. It stops short of authorizing the use of 
military force if Iraq does not comply. Saturday, Iraq banned weapons 
inspectors from monitoring previously searched facilities. Since then, 
inspectors have had little to do but change film and videocassettes 
on stationary cameras.
