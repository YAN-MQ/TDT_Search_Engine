India and Pakistan, the world's two newest nuclear powers, failed 
Friday to make progress toward peace in the one place where their 
armies are now killing each other: a wretched, freezing, thin-aired 
border spot 24,000 feet above sea level known as the Siachen Glacier. 
For 15 years, the two enemies, both claiming this 48-mile-long ice 
floe, have been heaving artillery and mortar fire at each other through 
the piercing winds. Military reports often tell of a handful of soldiers 
dying in the crossfire, though these casualties are said to be only 
half of those lost to frostbite, avalanches and fatal slips into deep 
crevices. In a hopeful meeting in New York on Sept. 23, the prime 
ministers of the two nations had laid the groundwork for sessions 
to soothe bellicose tensions. But the first round of talks last month 
in Islamabad produced little conciliation, and now the second one, 
here in New Delhi, is proving even more discouraging. The Indians, 
who occupy the high ground on the glacier, hoped to assume the same 
position in negotiations by offering a cease-fire. The Pakistanis 
rejected this because it did not include the withdrawal of troops 
from their adversary's favorable positions. ``What do you get by freezing 
a situation in conflict?'' asked a Pakistani diplomat who spoke to 
reporters on the condition of anonymity. ``What kind of peace and 
tranquility will you get if all the troops remain?'' During a similar 
news conference, one of India's lead negotiators, Lt. Gen. I.K. Verma, 
was unusually candid in answering such questions. Though a written 
statement said a cease-fire might be a first step toward a ``disengagement'' 
and ``redeployment,'' the general declared: ``This is our area. We 
are in control of it. We dominate the area, and they are telling us 
to vacate it and everything will be solved.'' The very idea made him 
indignant. ``This is our nation's frontiers, and to us it is sacrosanct, 
and if there is a threat to it, we have to take appropriate measures,'' 
he said. Actually, the glacier sits in a kind of icy netherworld within 
the Karakoram Mountains, wedged between India, China and Pakistan-occupied 
Kashmir. For a long time, the matter of who owned it was secondary 
to the question of who would want it. In the late 1970s, Pakistan 
began encouraging foreign mountaineers to go exploring there. In time, 
Indian troops began to venture up the steep ridges as well. One of 
their discoveries were maps of Pakistan that included territories 
_remote though they might be _ that more fittingly belonged to India. 
This alleged land-grabbing through map-making became known as ``cartographic 
aggression.'' India and Pakistan have fought three wars against each 
other since they were separated at birth in 1947. Two of the wars 
were over rival claims to Kashmir. While these hostilities came and 
went in huge flare-ups, the fighting in the Siachen Glacier has hung 
on like a low-grade fever. Both sides are believed to have about 3,000 
troops in the fray. By some estimates, India spends anywhere between 
$1 million to $4 million per day to maintain its hold on the steepest 
perches. The arduousness of the Indian effort on the world's highest 
and coldest battlefield is the stuff of legend here _ how temperatures 
dip to 50 below zero, how the mind plays tricks on a man at such extraordinary 
altitudes. The strategic importance of the glacier is something else 
again. ``Its military value has been debated for years, but its chief 
importance is symbolic,'' said Uday Bhaskar, deputy director of a 
defense think tank in New Delhi. ``It radiates on a national level, 
the way it would be a big deal for the United States if Mexico was 
trying to cheat it of a meaningless piece of desert.'' The dubious 
importance and colossal expense of the Siachen dispute led some to 
speculate that the two sides might find this a reasonable place for 
compromise. The issue had been the subject of talks six times before 
1992. The inability to reach a Siachen agreement Friday, however, 
followed a failure to settle a relatively minor disagreement about 
water on Thursday. Having lost any glow of optimism, the talks will 
continue for another week, moving on to matters like maritime boundaries 
and drug trafficking.
