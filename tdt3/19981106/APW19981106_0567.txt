Government ministers said Friday they remain fully committed to England's 
bid for the 2006 World Cup, denying a report that the country had 
given up hope of staging soccer's showpiece event. The Financial Times 
reported Friday that Prime Minister Tony Blair has withdrawn his active 
support for the bid because FIFA president Sepp Blatter was backing 
South Africa's candidacy. Blatter told Blair in London last week that 
Africa, which has never staged the World Cup, was the ``logical'' 
choice for the 2006 tournament _ provided that the facilities, transport, 
security and accomodations were up to scratch. The Financial Times 
said Blair's closest aides have advised him to distance himself from 
the bid amid ``signs of growing confusion over the status of England's 
application'' to hold the world's largest single sports event. The 
newspaper said the government was now relying on junior ministers, 
such as Sports Minister Tony Banks, to work alongside the 2006 campaign. 
``Other ministers can do their bit but the prime minister doesn't 
want to be too close to something likely to go the wrong way,'' an 
unidentified government member was quoted as saying. Banks went on 
television and radio to deny the report as ``absolutely absurd.'' 
``He (Blatter) also said to the Prime Minister that he thought England's 
bid was a very strong one and a very competitive one and I can tell 
you this, the Prime Minister was hugely encouraged by what Sepp Blatter 
said,'' Banks said. Chris Smith, the cabinet minister in charge of 
sport, also dismissed the newspaper report and reaffirmed the government's 
support for the bid. ``The whole government. ... are putting our full 
backing behind the 2006 bid,'' he said. Smith said Blatter stressed 
that South Africa had to meet strict conditions regarding facilities 
and infrastructure. ``Right now that isn't the case,'' Smith said. 
``We have those things in place. We believe we are still in there 
with a very good chance.'' England bid director Alec McGivan said 
Major was offering his ``total'' support for the campaign. ``The Government 
have been strong supporters of the bid and will continue to be,'' 
he said. ``The Prime Minister has personally been a fantastic friend 
to the bid and he will continue to play an enormous role in the next 
15 months as we build up to the decision as to who gets the 2006 World 
Cup.'' The winner will be selected in March 2000 after a vote by a 
24-member FIFA committee. Apart from South Africa and England, Germany 
has also entered a bidf. Blatter said he also expects bids from Brazil, 
Morocco, Nigeria and Egypt.
