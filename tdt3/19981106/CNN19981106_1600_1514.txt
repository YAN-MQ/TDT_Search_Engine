You might not have to worry about ice storms this winter, if the wooly 
bears are right. According to a prognosticator in hagerstown, Maryland, 
the bands on wooly bear caterpillars indicate this will be a mild 
winter. He says the front bands were of normal width, while the rear 
bands were narrow, meaning an average first half of winter and a warm 
second half. The caterpillar-counting forecaster says the wooly bears 
were accurate last winter.
