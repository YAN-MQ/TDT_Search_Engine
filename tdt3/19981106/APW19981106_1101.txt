The Spanish government on Friday approved 1.89 billion pesetas (dlrs 
13.4 million) in emergency aid for Central America's victims of Hurricane 
Mitch The government also temporarily suspended deportations of illegal 
immigrants from the four countries affected by the hurricane, the 
state-owned news agency EFE reported. Government spokesman Josep Pique 
said the aid would be disbursed immediately and showed Spain's ``complete 
solidarity'' with countries that have a ``special connection'' based 
on linguistic and cultural ties. Spanish humanitarian organizations 
said donations were pouring in for victims of the hurricane, which 
killed thousands and caused widespread damage in what were already 
some of the world's poorest countries. The Spanish branch of the Red 
Cross said it has received 2.1 billion pesetas (dlrs 15 million) this 
week. The Roman Catholic aid group, Caritas, said it had collected 
600 million (dlrs 4.3 million) pesetas over three days. A third aid 
group, Intermon, said it had so far taken in 302 million pesetas (2.1 
million dollars).
