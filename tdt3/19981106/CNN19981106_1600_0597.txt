For years, Santa Monica, California, has been the epitome of friendliness 
and security. But that changed this year. Charles Feldman has the 
story. Los Angeles is supposed to be the city of crime, although the 
crime rate here is actually down. On the other hand, nearby Santa 
Monica -- population of about 87,000 -- is supposed to be the safe 
city of fun. You know, sand, surf, Tony eateries, and only one homicide 
for all of 1997. Jesus, Jesus, Jesus But times and images change and, 
as this vigil and prayer meeting illustrates, not always for the better. 
There have been ten killings this year in Santa Monica. So far, four 
are the result of gang disputes. But it was the nongang-related killing 
of a German tourist in an apparent botched robbery that threatened 
to tarnish Santa Monica's image the most and potentially affect its 
economy. 65% of tourists who visit Santa Monica come from another 
country, many from germany. So far, hotels CNN talked with report 
no drop-off in reservations. When I'm talking to the reservations 
and product managers in Berlin and munich and Frankfurt, to a "T," 
they're telling us the same thing. They're saying they have no inquiries, 
no cancellations, and most importantly, there hasn't been a drop in 
bookings. But Santa Monica is really two cities -- the one tourists 
visit and the one people live in, often in the shadow of area gangs. 
It is in this Santa Monica that police have noticeably stepped up 
their surveillance of what they call "known gang members." Police 
are also spending more time at the city's public schools. Because 
of what has happened, we have more officers on the street to ensure 
safety. We've gone on 12-hour schedules. Police call this recent surge 
in homicides an anomaly. But anomaly or not, it has changed the image 
of Santa Monica in just a few short weeks. Charles Feldman, CNN, Los 
Angeles.
