French daredevil Alain Robert was arrested in Japan Friday on trespassing 
charges after he climbed a 54-story Tokyo skyscraper. Police said 
they waited for Robert on the rooftop of the 232-meter (766-foot) 
Shinjuku Center Building in downtown Tokyo after a witness called 
police. Robert, 39, dubbed ``Spiderman'' for his worldwide stunt-climbing, 
reached the roof in about 30 minutes, said the police official who 
spoke on condition of anonymity. The climber from Valence, France 
makes his living scaling tall buildings as publicity stunts. He uses 
only his bare hands. He has climbed more than 30 skyscrapers, including 
the Empire State Building.
