Time now to get over today's GeoQuiz hump. We were looking for a large 
desert state in India which hosts an annual camel market in the town 
of Pushkar. The answer is the Indian state of Rajistan. And what's 
with that camel market? Well, THE WORLD's Andrew North has been there. 
No, it's not a scene from "Jurassic Park," although the scene is certainly 
dramatic enough for a movie. These are camels, angry camels, thousands 
of them greeting the morning sun as it rises over the desert on the 
edge of Pushkar. The camels have been tied up all night waiting to 
be bought or sold in Pushkar's annual camel market, the largest market 
of its kind in India. Nearby, their owners wearing bright colored 
turbans like fires made out of the dung from their camels to brew 
their morning coffee. By the end of the one week market, these men 
will have traded some 100,000 camels on the doons here, often generating 
animated exchanges between buyers and sellers. How much would a camel 
cost? One thousand. One thousand rupies. Two thousand. So for this 
young one, maybe... One thousand. And what about a really big and 
old camel? Ten thousand, ten thousand. That's about $240 for a huge 
camel more than 12 feet high. During the week, this trader had sold 
almost all the 40 camels he brought with him from another village 
in Rajistan. Over the years, the camel market has turned into a huge 
festival, attracting visitors from across India and the rest of the 
world. Inevitably, it also attracts street sellers and hawkers, selling 
everything from snacks to post cards. But in the heart of Pushkar 
itself, there's a very different scene, a holy scene, because at this 
time of year, Pushkar is full of wandering holy men chanting to the 
incessant sound of miseras, small hand-size cymbals. Many of the holy 
men are naked and painted from head to foot. They wander the streets 
seeking donations from passersby. Pushkar is one of the key sites 
in Hinduism, India's main religion. At the center of the town is the 
holy Pushkar lake which draws thousands of pilgrims who come to bathe 
in its waters. But during the week of the camel market, the big draw 
in town is the vast numbers of large humped beasts waiting impatiently 
in the desert to find out who will be their next owners. For THE WORLD, 
this is Andrew North.
