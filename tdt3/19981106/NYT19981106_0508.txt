Too bad pigeons don't head south for the winter. Then Silvia Medrano's 
family could get a good night's rest. Unfortunately, a brood of cooing 
birds poked and clawed their way into a part of the roof that hangs 
over her third-floor apartment in a Brooklyn housing project. ``The 
other day, my aunt came here to stay,'' Ms. Medrano said. ``She got 
up at night and said someone was trying to open the door. She said: 
`Listen. Get a knife, there's a man coming in!' I told her no, it 
was just the pigeons.'' Ms. Medrano has put up with the birds for 
a year. Ragged bits of roofing dangle outside her windows, which stay 
closed and streaked because of the unending pile of pigeon droppings. 
The birds make such a scary racket at night that her daughters have 
abandoned their bedroom. This Hitchcockian headache is among the causes 
taken up by a tenant group in the Hope Gardens housing project in 
Bushwick. While other residents have been spared the birds, they have 
not been so lucky in staying dry. Leaky roofs and ceilings in some 
buildings once forced tenants to open their umbrellas on rainy days 
just to step into the hallway. The city's Housing Authority has embarked 
on a $13.5 million repair and modernization program that should be 
completed by March. But with winter approaching, members of Hope Gardens 
Leaders for Action want to meet with Ruben Franco, the chairman of 
the city's Housing Authority, to discuss what emergency measures are 
planned for those buildings that have yet to be repaired. ``We've 
asked many, many times to sit down with him and get a grasp of what 
the Housing Authority is going to do,'' said Msgr. John Powis, a clergyman 
from the neighborhood who helped organize the tenants. ``We want to 
push him hard to say what is going to be done.'' Hope Gardens Leaders 
for Action is not the officially elected tenant association for the 
mostly low-rise complex spread over a 30-block area of Bushwick that 
was devastated in the 1970s. Members said they formed their alternative 
group not to supplant the officially elected association, but to spur 
action on problems they suspected resulted from shoddy construction. 
When it opened in the 1980s, the complex was a dramatic departure 
from the towering projects that had become infamous failures across 
the nation. Pleased as they were with the complex, tenants soon discovered 
that poor insulation left them shivering in the winter, gutters and 
roof panels were stripped away by high winds and water dripped through 
the seams in the ceiling panels. ``This started small five years ago,'' 
said Maria Melendez, as she pointed to tiny cracks in her ceiling. 
``They never came to fix it.'' Her downstairs neighbor has a similar 
problem; the walls around her windows are soft to the touch. ``Look,'' 
Ms. Melendez said, showing a soggy box of curtains on her closet floor. 
``You tell me if I don't have a right to talk.'' That has been one 
of the biggest complaints from her group. Organizers said they had 
been subtly rebuffed by city officials, who urged them to work with 
the officially elected tenant association. In 1994, an official with 
the Housing Authority claimed _ incorrectly _ that federal regulations 
prohibited city officials from meeting with anyone but the official 
association. Hilly Gross, a Housing Authority spokesman, said, ``We 
absolutely disown'' that comment, adding that the agency would now 
endeavor to schedule a meeting with the group. But members of Hope 
Gardens Leaders for Change were frustrated enough with city officials 
that they appealed for help from the Department of Housing and Urban 
Development, the federal agency that provides $1 billion annually 
to the city. Bill de Blasio, who is the HUD secretary's representative 
for New York and New Jersey, inspected the development and found merit 
in the group's concerns. ``We have been open with the Housing Authority 
that there has not been the best communication on this,'' de Blasio 
said. ``We believe they are better served to have met with them, not 
to the detriment of the official tenant association, but to engage 
them. Some of this information might have helped put them at ease 
and helped the Housing Authority understand what's happening on the 
ground.'' Silvia Medrano would prefer they look a little higher _ 
exactly three flights up. Her patience is as ragged as the roof, where 
the pigeons await the winter.
