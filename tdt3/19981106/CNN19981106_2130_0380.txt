Vice President Gore's wife, Tipper, will lead a delegation to central 
america next week to begin delivering U.S. aid to victims of hurricane 
mitch. At least 10,000 people were killed by the storm, thousands 
more are missing. First lady Hillary Rodham Clinton will add stops 
in Nicaragua and Honduras to a trip to the region later this month. 
The United States has boosted its aid package to $70 million. And 
supplies are pouring into Nicaragua and Honduras from other countries 
as well, but little is reaching the hardest-hit villages. Roads have 
been damaged so badly supply trucks cannot get through.
