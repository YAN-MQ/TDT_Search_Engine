This is meteorologist Valerie Voss with your "CNN Headline News Weather" 
forecast for Saturday. Snow moves from the rocky mountains into the 
plains states, bringing perhaps the first snow of the season to some 
sections of Iowa. There will be showers ahead of this system down 
into Texas. In the west, a strong system will bring some heavy rains 
to coastal Oregon and northern California with more snow in the mountains. 
There could be a mix of rain or snow over parts of the Great Lakes 
as well. In the southeast, a little bit on the cool side, but dry. 
50s and 60s through that region. We'll see just 20s and 30s over the 
northern plains. Looking ahead to Sunday, more rain in the west all 
the way into southern california, with a mix of rain and snow over 
parts of the upper midwest. For Monday, the western two-thirds of 
the country are wet. And on Tuesday, with showers in the northwest, 
snow in the northern plains and showers and storms down to the gulf 
coast, conditions will be unsettled. Don't forget, you can find four-day 
forecasts for more than 7,200 cities on cNN interactive. The address
