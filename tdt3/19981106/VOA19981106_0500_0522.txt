The United States is preparing to airlift emergency relief supplies 
to Central America, where more than 10,000 people have been killed 
by Hurricane Mitch. U.S. officials describe the storm as the hemisphere's 
worst natural disaster in memory, one which will take years and billions 
of dollars to recover. At the White House, VOA's Nick Simeone has 
details on what the United States is doing to help. The first shipments 
of $20 million in U.S. food assistance are set to leave for Central 
America Saturday, accompanied by millions more in military assets 
to help transport and distribute supplies. U.S. AID director Brian 
Atwood : This is just to deal with the humanitarian consequences of 
this. This is just to save lives. We are at risk of seeing disease 
and major problems resulting from people being stranded without food 
for more than five or six days now in some parts of Honduras. The 
United States expects its total aid contribution will go as high as 
$70 million for storm recovery efforts that AID director Atwood describes 
as hemisphere-wide. This has caused a disaster that was unimaginable 
at the outset. We anticipated wind damage from a storm of 180 miles 
per hour. We never did anticipate that it would take the trajectory 
it took, or that we would see the kind of mud slides. In dropping 
nearly 150 centimeters of rain on parts of Central America, Hurricane 
Mitch claimed thousands of lives and left 2 million others displaced. 
In addition, U.S. officials estimate the storm has destroyed a quarter-century 
worth of investment and infrastructure. Nick Simeone, VOA NEWS, at 
the White House.
