Mediaset SpA, Italy's television and advertising company, said Friday 
that it didn't plan to give up a television channel as part of its 
plan to create a European television venture with Germany's Kirch 
Media Group. ``We're working on the creation of a European network, 
but we're not considering the sale or conferring of a television channel 
(to a joint venture),'' said a spokeswoman, speaking on condition 
of anonymity, for Mediaset, the media arm of Fininvest, former Premier 
Silvio Berlusconi's sprawling empire. A report in Milan's financial 
daily Il Sole 24 Ore Friday suggested that Mediaset could turn over 
one of its three channels -- likely Rete 4 -- into a joint media venture 
with Kirch. The report also said Kirch would give over its channel 
SAT1 while both Kirch and Mediaset would each turn over their 25 percent 
stake in Spanish television station Telecinco to the new company. 
Mediaset and Kirch have been in negotiations for a number of months, 
but talks had previously stalled on a variety of issues. While the 
newspaper report said that a letter of intent could be signed soon, 
Mediaset said that details about the possible timing of an accord, 
as well as other factors, weren't available. In other media developments, 
RAI, Italy's state television, approved a plan to seek a 10 percent 
stake in Telepiu as it seeks to form a partnership in digistal television, 
newspapers reported. The stake might grow to 35 percent through partners 
which may include Olivetti, Wind and Banca Commerciale Italiana, the 
reports said. Italian dailies said the RAI board gave the green light 
on Thursday to the plan, which would mean RAI cohabiting with an offshoot 
of its rival television broadcaster. Telepiu is partially owned by 
Berlusconi's media empire. There was no comment immediately available 
from RAI. RAI was in heated negotiations wich Telecom Italia SpA until 
recent management turmoil there drove RAI to consider other alliances, 
namely the interest of France's Canal Plus AG, which owns 90 percent 
of its Italian digital provider, Telepiu. Telecom Italia chairman 
Gian Mario Rossignolo had been spearheading negotiations with RAI, 
Rupert Murdoch's British Sky Broadcasting Plc, and France's TF1, but 
was forced to resign last month because of Telecom's management upheaval.
