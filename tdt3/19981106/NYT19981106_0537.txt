The chances of ending the National Basketball Association's labor 
conflict grew bleaker on Friday. Talks between the chief negotiators 
broke off indefinitely, another week of games was stricken from the 
schedule, and the union executive director, Billy Hunter, again accused 
the NBA of trying to shatter the players' solidarity. Hunter, Commissioner 
David Stern and their internal negotiating teams emerged from a one-hour 
meeting in Manhattan and gave no indication of when negotiations would 
resume. It was the first time talks had been suspended since Aug. 
6, when the owners walked out of a meeting. With both sides holding 
firm and no bargaining sessions planned, it appears that the lockout 
_ in its 129th day _ will push up against Stern's unofficial, early-December 
deadline for reaching a deal. Asked if he felt pressure was growing, 
Hunter replied that there was pressure on both sides. ``We're not 
going to take a bad deal,'' he said. ``If it means we don't play until 
January or February, that's what it means.'' ``Unfortunately, nothing 
has changed this week,'' said Russ Granik, the league's deputy commissioner. 
``We are still very, very far apart. We haven't moved closer at all.'' 
Granik added: ``As each day goes by, there are just huge dollars that 
are lost. It's hard for me to say there is a particular date as to 
when the window closes to make a deal, but I'm hoping we don't get 
to that point.'' With Granik out of town to attend U.S.A. Basketball 
meetings early next week, the earliest possible negotiation between 
the league and the union could not take place until late next week. 
That would probably mean another week of games would be canceled, 
which would reduce the season to around 60 games. Meanwhile, a participant 
in Wednesday's negotiating session said the union had offered mediation 
to help resolve the dispute _ a tool that major-league baseball players 
and owners unsuccessfully used in 1994. But the league rejected the 
use of a mediator, the participant said. League officials claimed 
they never received a new proposal that the players promised. Hunter, 
who admitted that he and his legal team had decided not to send a 
new proposal, accused Stern and the owners of using the next two weeks 
to lobby the players and exert pressure on the union to sign a deal. 
``It's clear they're trying to split the players,'' Hunter said, adding 
that he knew of seven teams that had contacted players to discuss 
the league's latest proposal. ``They want to take a poll and see where 
our players stand.'' On Wednesday, Stern lifted a 4-month-old moratorium 
that would allow team officials with knowledge of the negotiations 
to explain the deal to players. The agreement does not constitute 
unfair labor practice and the league contends it is doing so for only 
informational purposes. Still, the move angered Hunter and he has 
scheduled a meeting next week of the union's executive committee. 
``We're not going to stand by and let the owners and league attempt 
to have unfettered access to our players and let them manipulate them 
without going back out there and clearing the record up,'' Hunter 
said. Negotiations over the key economic issues _ among them, total 
revenue distribution and the implementation of an escrow system _ 
continue to lag. A week after both sides boasted that a framework 
had been agreed upon, talks have become so unproductive that a fifth 
week has been deleted from the season. That means the NBA could not 
start earlier than Dec. 8. Hunter identified Miami Heat owner Micky 
Arison and team president and coach Pat Riley as having talked to 
players about the deal, along with Celtics president and coach Rick 
Pitino, Boston General Manager Chris Wallace, Boston owner Paul Gaston, 
Milwaukee coach George Karl and Cleveland Cavaliers General Manager 
Wayne Embry. ``From what we've heard, they're talking to the players 
about how good the deal is,'' Hunter said. ``Our players know the 
difference between a good deal and a bad deal. We're confident about 
that. I'm just worried this will create a rift between management 
and players.'' Asked why the union decided not to make changes in 
its most recent proposal, Hunter added, ``Our position is, we're not 
going to show movement until they show movement.'' ``The owners believe 
totally that they will not operate until we have a fair deal,'' Granik 
said. ``And if that means missing the whole season, that's what it 
means. Obviously it's not anything anybody wants to do.''
