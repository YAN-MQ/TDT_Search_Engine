Sport utility vehicles have never been more popular. But there's a 
problem -- they produce more pollution than most passenger cars. Greg 
Lamotte has more. If you've been thinking about buying an SUV -- you 
know, one of those sport utility vehicles -- you are certainly not 
alone. In car-crazy California, SUVs and light trucks account for 
almost half of all new vehicles sold. They are extremely popular but 
there is some bad news. They produce more than three-fourths of the 
state's vehicle emissions. Historically, they were classified as light 
trucks. And light trucks were given a break going back to the late 
'70s, early '80s because it was seen as giving a break to the working 
person. Impact consumer choice. The state is now slamming on the brakes 
and is taking action to bring SUVs to a E screeching halt when it 
comes to pollution. The state has approved a measure to meet the same 
anti-pollution standards adopted for passenger cars by the year 2004. 
California has the greatest air quality challenge in the country. 
Seven of the ten areas in the U.S. with the highest Ozone readings 
are located in California. Manufacturers say the new standards should 
be attainable. The added cost to consumers is yet to be determined. 
What it means for California is clearly that the air is going to be 
cleaner and I'm sure they're all gonna benefit for that and be happy 
about it. Motorists across the nation may be breathing easier as well. 
It's believed the federal EPA may follow California's lead. Greg LaMotte, 
CNN, Los Angeles.
