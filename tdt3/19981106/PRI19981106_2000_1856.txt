Israel is suspending all consideration of the Wye River Peace Agreement 
with the Palestinians. It follows a car bomb attack that killed two 
people in a Jerusalem market. President Clinton is calling on both 
sides to remain committed to the peace process. I ask for your prayers 
and support for the Israelis and the Palestinians who believe in this 
agreement and who are determined to carry out their responsibilities, 
and who understand that the agreement is the best way to protect the 
safety of the Israeli people. The bombing has been condemned by the 
Palestinians who say they're doing everything they can to prevent 
a repeat of the attack.
