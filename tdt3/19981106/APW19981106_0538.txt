The chief of port police in the Russian Black Sea city of Novorossiisk 
was found stabbed to death in his car, a news report said Friday. 
Russia's Interior Ministry sent a delegation led by Deputy Interior 
Minister Vladimir Rushailo to investigate the incident, the ITAR-Tass 
news agency reported. Col. Yevgeny Fedoryakin's body had two knife 
wounds when it was found, the report said. It did not say when the 
body was discovered or give any other details. Novorossiisk, about 
800 kilometers (500 miles) south of Moscow, is the largest outlet 
for Russia's huge oil exports.
