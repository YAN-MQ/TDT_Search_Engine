A bombing in Jerusalem today has set back the Israeli/Palestinian 
peace process. The blast killed the two suspected car bombers and 
injured at least 20 other people in a crowded marketplace. Police 
say the Islamic militant group Hamas claimed responsibility. A Palestinian 
peace negotiator condemned the attack, calling it a crime and saying 
it hurts the interests of the Palestinian people. In response to the 
attack, the Israeli cabinet suspended its consideration of the newly 
negotiated land-for-security deal with the Palestinians. The feeling 
in Jerusalem right now is very tough. I think everybody understands 
right now that we were right to put these anti-terrorist conditions 
into the wye agreement, but that's not enough. We want the Palestinian 
authority to live up to these commitments, otherwise the whole peace 
process is in jeopardy. We believe that these attacks are directed 
to sabotaging the peace process. And we really urge the Israeli government 
to go ahead with the implementation of the wye accord. I believe that 
is the only way to respond to those extremists on both sides who want 
to sabotage the peace process. President Clinton today condemned the 
bombing in Israel. He called it an outrageous and cowardly act by 
the enemies of peace. In a written statement, Mr. Clinton said -- 
the bombing was the second such incident since the wye agreement was 
signed last month.
