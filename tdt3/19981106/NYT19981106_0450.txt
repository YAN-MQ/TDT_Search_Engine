If the pilots at Federal Express carry out their threat to strike 
during the holiday shipping season, it won't be just traditional mail-order 
houses that are grounded. Noah's Ark Original Deli in Teaneck, N.J., 
ships potato knishes and rugelach around the world by Federal Express. 
Customers place orders through its online catalogue (www.noahsark.net), 
which is run by Federal Express for the deli. ``We ship rugelach to 
Puerto Rico, Hawaii, everywhere,'' said David Sokolow, manager of 
Noah's Ark. ``People have to get their fix.'' To bind customers like 
Noah's Ark more closely to them, Federal Express, like United Parcel 
Service and other carriers, has gone far beyond dropping off a stack 
of shipping labels. Large and small companies have hitched their business 
to its technology and logistics services. Federal Express provides 
terminals to print shipping labels and software to manage packages 
from assembly line to customer. All that automation could make it 
harder for customers to switch carriers if members of the Fedex Pilots 
Association approve a strike authorization requested by union management. 
``Everything's set up for Fedex,'' Sokolow said while serving pastrami 
to the in-store lunch trade. ``If worse comes to worst, we'll take 
the orders through Fedex, and ship them out U.P.S.'' The results of 
the strike vote are expected in the first week of December, just in 
time for the union's board of directors to authorize a holiday-disrupting 
strike. The two sides are deadlocked over pay. Federal Express executives 
have issued warnings that the company is on the verge of losing the 
business of several major shippers during the holiday season because 
of the strike threat. Customers have been asking for firm assurances 
that Federal Express, a unit of the FDX Corp., would be able to deliver, 
said Theodore Wiese, the chief executive of Federal Express. Bob Clement, 
a spokesman for the pilots who fly the 326 Federal Express jets, said 
the warnings were a typical ``union busting'' ploy meant to bring 
pressure on the union to settle the dispute. Federal Express' customers 
include the many of the country's largest direct retailers and even 
the General Services Administration. But unlike smaller companies 
like Noah's Ark, the giants are not expressing much worry over the 
strike threat. ``We don't envision a major disruption,'' said John 
Oliver, a spokesman for L.L. Bean, which ships just 2 percent of its 
orders by Federal Express. Recreational Equipment Inc., a Seattle-based 
seller of outdoor gear and clothing, says it is watching the situation 
closely and making contingency plans, but expects to have no trouble 
getting its goods delivered. The strike threat reinforces a lesson 
customers learned last year, when UPS drivers walked out for 15 days: 
Relying on a single carrier can be dangerous. Aside from the pilots, 
none of Federal Express' workers are unionized. If the pilots strike, 
the rest of the employees are expected to keep working, and the company 
says it will be able to lease aircraft and flight crews from other 
companies and increase reliance on ground transportation. ``Fedex 
customers don't know or care whether their packages move on a plane 
or a truck,'' said Gregory M. Rossiter, a Federal Express spokesman. 
``But any significant concern about our ability to be reliable or 
dependable might force a customer to seek additional means of shipping.'' 
Those additional means are likely to be scarce around the holidays, 
the busiest time of year, when even the biggest carrier, UPS, has 
little spare capacity. ``There won't be room in the lifeboats,'' said 
Paul Schlesinger, transportation analyst at Donaldson, Lufkin &AMP; 
Jenrette in Manhattan.
