For our musical closure today, THE WORLD's Marco Worman introduces 
us to a diva from Prague who is not your standard pop star. Her name 
is Vera Beela. In an industry that's mastered the art of marketing 
beautiful nymphet divas, it's nice to know that the big Mama Thorntons 
of the world still succeed on talent alone. Vera Beela is a rotund 
Czech gypsy whose voice echoes the traditions of her Bohemian village. 
Beela began her career singing alongside her violinist father on songs 
like this, "Lolee Roja" the Red Rose. The words are simple: "I'll 
place a red rose in your black hair. I won't sleep all night. I'll 
think of you. God, how I love you." Vera Beela's repertoire includes 
not just sentimental love songs, but also traditional dance tunes. 
This one, "Pashal Pernori," is now working its way up the charts in 
Prague, and the video is getting air play on Czech television. The 
music of Czech gypsy diva Vera Beela brought to us by THE WORLD's 
music man, Marco Worman.
