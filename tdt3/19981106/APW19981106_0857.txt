Russia's Yevgeny Kafelnikov overpowered a lackluster Marcelo Rios 
in the quarterfinal of the dlrs 2.55 million Paris Open on Friday, 
easily beating the world No. 2, 6-3, 6-2. Kafelnikov, the No. 8 seed, 
took exactly one hour to beat Rios, who was roundly booed off the 
court by spectators who felt he hadn't made an effort. The match turned 
in the eighth game of the first set. Kafelnikov broke serve while 
leading 4-3 with a smart backhand drop volley, and held serve to take 
the set. The Russian blasted Rios off the court in the second set 
with a display of blistering serves and powerful returns. Rios could 
have ended the week as world No. 1 by winning the Paris Open, if Pete 
Sampras were to lose in the quarterfinals. But the Chilean never looked 
comfortable against the powerful Russian. ``The first set was unbelievable 
but he let himself down in the second with some loose play,'' Kafelnikov 
said. ``From that point on he gave me a lot of extra confidence and 
I never looked back.'' ``Once you give the idea that you are a bit 
down, or not satisfied with something, that gives your opponent extra 
confidence,'' the Russian said. Kafelnikov's win also improves his 
chances of qualifying for the ATP World Championship in Hanover next 
month. Rios still hopes to end the year as number one. ``Hanover will 
decide it,'' he said. In Saturday's semifinals, Kafelnikov will play 
Britain's Greg Rusedski, the player that beat him in the first round 
of last month's Vienna Open event. Rusedski, who retains a small chance 
of qualifying for Hanover, had little trouble beating Magnus Gustafsson, 
6-3, 6-2 in another quarterfinal contest.
