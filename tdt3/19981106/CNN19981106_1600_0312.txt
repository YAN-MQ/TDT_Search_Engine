Tipper Gore will lead a delegation to central America to begin delivering 
U.S. aid to victims of hurricane Mitch. 10,000 people were killed 
by the storm. Thousands more are missing. First lady Hillary Rodham 
Clinton will add stops in Nicaragua and Honduras to a trip to the 
region later this month. The first lady of Honduras spoke with CNN 
this morning about the devastation in her country. The hurricane has 
devastated the entire country. We have a reported number of almost 
7,000 people dead and 11,000 people who are missing. Their whereabouts 
are unknown, and we have around 1 million people in shelters throughout 
the country. And daily, it's a big challenge to provide these people 
with food and medicine, because the supplies can only be transported 
by helicopters or by boats, because all these communities have become 
isolated. With so many dead, authorities are digging mass Graves to 
help prevent the spread of disease. The U.S. has boosted its aid package 
to the region to $70 million.
