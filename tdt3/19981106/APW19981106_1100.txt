Japan will become the first nation outside the Americas to play in 
the Copa America, the South American confederation announced Friday. 
The Japanese confirmed their participation Friday for the biennial 
South American championship, set for June 29-July 18, in Paraguay. 
``Official communication from the Japanese federation has arrived, 
accepting the invitation from our president, Nicolas Leoz,'' CONMEBOL 
spokemsan Nestor Benitez said. ``The confirmation was delayed because 
the Japanese officials needed time to rearrange their schedule for 
1999,'' he said. Benitez said the draw for the 12-team tournament, 
which also will include CONCACAF champion Mexico, will be staged Dec. 
15 in Asuncion. Argentina already has been slated to play its first-round 
games in the city of Luque, while Brazil will play its first-round 
matches in Ciudad del Este, 390 kilometers (240 miles) from Asuncion. 
Japan becomes the first non-American team to play in the Copa America. 
Mexico and the United States were the first teams from outside South 
America to participate in 1993 when they were invited in an arrangement 
between CONCACAF and CONMEBOL. Mexico and the United States also played 
in 1995, and Mexico also played in 1997. With the United States having 
launched Major League Soccer with an April-October schedule in 1996, 
it declined in 1997 and was replaced by Costa Rica. The United States 
again has declined for the upcoming championship, opening a place 
for Japan.
