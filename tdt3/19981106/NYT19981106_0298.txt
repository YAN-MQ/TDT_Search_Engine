Rwanda acknowledged on Friday for the first time that it has troops 
helping rebels in Congo, an admission that could smooth the way for 
a cease-fire in that troubled country. Since fighting broke out in 
Congo in July, Rwanda has repeatedly denied any involvement. The stand 
has made it difficult for real bargaining to take place and has led 
to heated exchanges between Rwandan leaders and the president of Congo, 
Laurent Kabila. The rebels, a mixture of opposition politicians and 
disgruntled soldiers, are accusing Kabila of corruption, nepotism 
and inciting ethnic hatred. When Kabila came to power 18 months ago, 
ousting the dictator Mobutu Sese Seko, he did so with crucial support 
from Rwanda and Uganda. But those countries have now turned against 
him and are backing the new rebellion. The Rwandans believe that Kabila 
has been arming and training exiled Rwandans and former soldiers with 
the aim of destabilizing Rwanda. The admission on Friday was made 
by Rwanda's vice president, Paul Kagame, at the end of an hourlong 
meeting with President Nelson Mandela in Pretoria. At a news conference, 
Kagame said Rwanda became involved in the Congo rebellion in August 
and had denied such actions because it did not want to be seen as 
fueling the conflict. Kagame said it was important that people understand 
that the rebellion did not spring from the Rwandan presence. ``At 
the beginning there were different complications because people were 
confusing the issues,'' Kagame said. ``They were confusing any information 
about the presence of our troops as the problem. They did not realize 
that the problem was basically an internal one.'' Despite dozens of 
meetings to promote peace negotiations, the fighting in Congo has 
continued for three months, drawing in neighboring countries on both 
sides and threatening to develop into a large-scale war. Kagame said 
Friday that Rwandan forces would not withdraw until Rwanda's security 
concerns were addressed. ``For us it is an issue of making sure that 
whatever solution is found in the Congo, that it must take care of 
all our security concerns,'' he said. Mandela, who sat next to Kagame 
as he spoke, said Rwanda's admission of involvement would be crucial 
in advancing peace talks. Mandela has been working on a diplomatic 
solution to the crisis off and on for months, but has had little success 
so far. ``Now that the Rwandans, through the vice president, have 
made this acknowledgment, I think that we have reason to believe that 
there's going to be progress,'' he said. He said a meeting of the 
regional Southern African Development Community would be held to try 
to work out a cease-fire deal and a framework for the withdrawal of 
all foreign forces in Congo. He gave no date for the meeting. Kagame 
spoke a day after the Congolese rebel leader Ernest Wamba dia Wamba 
said Ugandan and Rwandan troops were helping his rebels fight Kabila. 
The rebels, who control large areas of eastern Congo, have repeatedly 
called for direct talks with Kabila _ whose forces have been reinforced 
by soldiers from Angola, Namibia, Zimbabwe and Chad. But Kabila has 
refused, saying that there is no substantial rebel movement, only 
Rwandan and Ugandan troops.
