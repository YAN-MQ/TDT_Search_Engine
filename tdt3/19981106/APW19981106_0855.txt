The German subsidiary of General Motors Corp., Adam Opel, has recalled 
about 60,000 new Astra models for inspections after customers reported 
steering troubles, the automaker announced Friday. Astra owners complained 
of grinding noises or resistance when turning the steering wheel. 
They will not be charged for the inspections. Opel recalled a previous 
Astra model for problems with the neck of the gas tank.
