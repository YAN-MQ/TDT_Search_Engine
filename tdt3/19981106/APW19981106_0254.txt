Savoring a rare chance to host a U.S. cabinet member, Taiwan on Friday 
welcomed an upcoming visit from Energy Secretary Bill Richardson that 
has already drawn strong condemnations from China. ``Richardson's 
visit illustrates the United States' concern for substantive relations 
with us, including trade,'' said Shen Lyu-shun, the ministry's director 
of North American affairs. Greater attention from Washington is warranted, 
Shen said, because despite Taiwan's small size it buys more than twice 
as many U.S. exports annually as China. Richardson will arrive Monday, 
then on Tuesday address a joint U.S.-Taiwan business conference in 
Taipei on ``economic and commercial issues of mutual interest,'' the 
U.S. Energy Department said. Richardson also was expected to meet 
with Taiwan President Lee Teng-hui, U.S. officials said. Richardson's 
arrival will be just the third by U.S. cabinet member since the United 
States revised its policy in 1994 to allow such visits. The visit 
is an attempt by Washington to reassure Taiwan following President 
Bill Clinton's trip to China this past summer, Taiwan's China Times 
said. In Beijing, China's Foreign Ministry restated its opposition 
to any type of official contact between the United States and Taiwan. 
Such visits violate agreements between China and the United States, 
the ministry said in a statement that warned of possible damage to 
the ``hard-won development in China-U.S. ties.'' A similar visit by 
then-U.S. Transportation Secretary Federico Pena in 1994 prompted 
China to bar Pena from a planned visit to Beijing. Since 1949, China 
has considered Taiwan a rebel province without the right to international 
relations. The United States, Taiwan's largest trading partner, receives 
23 percent of the island's exports and accounts for 20 percent of 
its imports. Despite that trade relationship, Taiwan and the United 
States have not had diplomatic relations since 1979.
