This will be the last night in space for John Glenn and the shuttle 
"Discovery" crew. But the weather in Florida could cause a change 
in plans. Sean Callebs is at the Kennedy space center in Florida with 
an update. Sean? Well, Chuck, this trip is winding down. Right now 
NasA is looking at the Kennedy space center as the primary landing 
site. But the space agency has had to put another crew at another 
site in california because of weather. And this isn't the only problem 
right now. NASA is keeping a close eye on the shuttle's drag chute. 
Remember during launch? An aluminum door that protects the chute fell 
off. During a briefing, the flight manager downplayed any serious 
threat. But the shuttle, in her words, "could have a hard landing 
that might break the spacecraft in the unlikely event the chute deploys 
early and cannot be jettisoned." You may break the strut. It would 
do a lot 06 damage to the Orbiter. It's probably not going to deploy, 
and the mechanism will work. It's been a pleasure working with you. 
The mission went super smooth. John Glenn waited more than 3 1/2 decades 
to return to the earth's orbit. But now as the crew stores gear and 
finishes tests and exercises, Glenn's remaining time in space is measured 
in hours, not days. NASA physicians explain what Glenn and the others 
can expect when they leave microgravity and are back on earth. They 
experience maybe a little bit of light-headedness, particularly if 
they stand in one spot for a length of time and don't move around 
much. Most astronauts experience some dizziness, but doctors will 
decide after landing whether Glenn is up to walking off the ship or 
whether he needs assistance. Reporting live, I'm Sean Callebs. Thanks, 
Sean Callebs, at the Kennedy space center in Florida.
