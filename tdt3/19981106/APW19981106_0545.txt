World natural rubber production will outstrip demand in 1999 for the 
second year running, helped by likely record supplies from Thailand, 
Indonesia and India, the International Rubber Study Group said Friday. 
Figures released by the London-based intergovernmental agency show 
world natural rubber output rising to 6.800 million metric tons in 
1999, from 6.610 million tons forecast for 1998 and 1997's estimated 
figure of 6.420 million tons. Seventy per cent of rubber production 
goes to tire manufacturing. Consumption next year is projected at 
6.700 million tons, compared with 6.560 million tons forecast for 
1998 and the 6.480 million tons used in 1997, the agency said. The 
agency forecast synthetic rubber production in 1998 and 1999 at 10.360 
million tons and 10.310 million tons respectively, against 1997's 
10.050 million tons. Consumption, which totaled 9.990 million tons 
in 1997, is forecast at 10.070 million tons this year and 10.220 million 
tons in 1997, the agency said. The Group's individual 1998 natural 
rubber production forecasts (in thousands of tons, with estimated 
1997 output in brackets) include Thailand 2,123 (2.031), Indonesia 
1,576 (1,505), Malaysia 900 (971), India 609 (580), China 455 (444),
