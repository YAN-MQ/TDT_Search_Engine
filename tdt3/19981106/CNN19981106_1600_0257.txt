400 legal scholars are weighing in on the subject of impeaching president 
clinton. They are releasing a report today that makes a case against 
impeachment. Republicans on the house Judiciary committee may take 
testimony from experts who believe Mr. Clinton has committed impeachable 
offenses. One scholar opposing impeachment says it sets a dangerous 
precedent. We fear that if the house decides to impeach President 
Clinton for the conduct alleged in the Starr referral, it will lower 
the bar for what warrants impeachment, it will make future presidents 
too beholden to congress, it will move us precariously and unconstitutionally 
toward a Parliamentary system, and finally will dangerously weaken 
the office of the presidency. Judiciary committee chairman Henry Hyde 
has sent President Clinton a list of 81 questions about the Monica 
Lewinsky matter. The White House has yet to respond.
