NATIONAL FORECAST Friday, over a half foot of snow fell in the Black 
Hills of western South Dakota as a developing low pressure system 
moved east from the northern Rockies. Saturday, as moist air from 
the Gulf of Mexico is lifted up and over a warm front attached to 
the low, a swath of moderate snow will fall from southern South Dakota 
to the northern half of Iowa. Three to six inches of snow is expected 
in this region. Meanwhile, bands of showers and a few thunderstorms 
will form farther south across the lower Mississippi Valley as the 
humid air intercepts an approaching jet stream disturbance. Behind 
the disturbance, warmer and drier conditions will spread into western 
Texas. A sprawling high pressure system will continue to promote dry 
and cool weather in much of the East. However, as the cool air gathers 
moisture in transit over the Great Lakes, a few flurries will form 
southeast of Lakes Erie and Ontario. Snow flurries will also speckle 
the mountains of interior New England as a weak jet stream disturbance 
passes overhead. Farther east, intervals of sunshine will occur near 
the Northeast coast as breezes from the northwest dry on decent from 
the Appalachians. In the meantime, ample sun will persist across the 
Southeast, including Florida. A powerful Pacific storm will lash the 
Northwest and northern California coasts Saturday with windswept heavy 
rain from near San Francisco to Portland, Oregon. Meanwhile, as the 
moist air is lifted and cooled in the northern Sierra and southern 
Cascade mountains, heavy snow will fall above 6,000 feet. FOCUS: AN 
ODD TWIST There was evidence of an odd twister among the ten that 
accompanied Tropical Storm Mitch in southern Florida. The pattern 
of damage showed that clockwise winds surrounded the center of the 
tornado. Over 90 percent of tornados spin counterclockwise. A tornado 
develops when the motion in large, slowly rotating thunderstorms is 
concentrated into a narrow violent swirl. Since larger scale storms 
are affected by the earth's rotation, the slow spin is usually counterclockwise. 
Rarely, the turbulent motions near thunderstorms can make small areas 
of clockwise rotation that lead to tornados that spin in reverse.
