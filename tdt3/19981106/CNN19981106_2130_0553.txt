The White House may be planning to lift some sanctions against India 
and pakistan. A senior official says it's in response to a moratorium 
on further nuclear tests announced by both countries. Sanctions were 
imposed last spring, after India and Pakistan conducted testing. Formal 
announcement of the lifting of sanctions may come in the next several 
days.
