The United States on Friday formally accepted a ruling by the World 
Trade Organization that its restrictions on imported shrimp violate 
free trade _ but left open whether and how it would change its laws. 
U.S. trade ambassador Rita Hayes said the U.S. administration was 
consulting with Congress and other interested parties on what to do 
and would advise the WTO within the required 30 days. At issue is 
a U.S. embargo on shrimp imports from India, Malaysia, Pakistan, and 
Thailand, which use trawling nets that trap endangered sea turtles. 
Environmentalists say failure to equip shrimp nets with turtle-excluder 
devices costing dlrs 75 causes the death of 150,000 turtles a year 
worldwide. A WTO appeals body last month upheld the findings of an 
expert panel report that the U.S. rules amounted to ``arbitrary and 
unjustifiable discrimination.'' Under WTO procedures, the report of 
its appellate body is final. Although it faulted the United States 
for the way its rules were carried out, the WTO appeals body said 
it recognized the right of members to adopt conservation laws. And, 
in a first, it accepted evidence from environmental groups rather 
than just the governments directly concerned. The WTO has frequently 
come under fire from environmental groups for putting free trade before 
conservation. A fringe group of environmentalists last week hit WTO 
director-general Renato Ruggiero with cream pies, accusing him of 
being a turtle killer. The U.S. view that the appellate body at least 
partly vindicated its policy on shrimp imports may cause problems 
ahead if it doesn't change its laws to the satisfaction of India, 
Malaysia, Pakistan and Thailand. Thailand's representative, Krit Garnjana-Goonchorn, 
said the appeal body's view might set an unwelcome precedent. ``The 
decision may already have opened a floodgate foreshadowing greater 
abusive use of trade-related environmental measures in the future,'' 
he said. The Thai statement said the appeals body should not have 
accepted submissions from environmental groups as they were not a 
direct party in the dispute. Pakistan, India and Malaysia made similar 
comments.
