The job of second-ranking leader among house republicans is also in 
a Shakeup. Today, congressman Steve Largent of Oklahoma announced 
he'll challenge house majority leader Dick Armey. On November 3rd, 
the republican party hit an iceberg. And I think the question that 
is before our conference today is whether we retain the crew of the 
"Titanic" or we look for some new leadership. It's my opinion that 
it would be better to attempt and fail in my effort to run for majority 
leader and provide some new and different leadership for our conference 
than never to attempt it at all. The GOP had hoped to fortify its 
control of Congress in the midterm elections. Instead, republicans 
lost five house seats and gained none in the Senate.
