The Spanish government said Friday it will ask Britain to extradite 
former Chilean dictator Augusto Pinochet to Madrid so he can face 
charges of genocide, terrorism and torture. Approval of Judge Baltasar 
Garzon's extradition request for Pinochet was announced by government 
spokesman Josep Pique after a cabinet meeting. Foreign Minister Abel 
Matutes, present at the briefing, said he expected the request to 
reach the British Interior Ministry on Tuesday. Garzon, whose warrant 
against the 82-year-old Pinochet led to the ex-despot's arrest Oct. 
16 in London as he recovered from back surgery, passed on a formal 
extradition request this week to the Madrid government. Prime Minister 
Jose Maria Aznar's administration has criticized Garzon's probe into 
human rights crimes committed in Chile under Pinochet's 1973-1990 
rule and in Argentina, saying he lacks jurisdiction. But Aznar and 
other government officials had said that they would pass on an extradition 
request to Britain if they received one, calling the affair a matter 
for courts to decide. Matutes reiterated this Friday. ``We understand 
that this is a delicate matter which must be treated with prudence,'' 
he said. ``But most important it is a judicial matter. We have to 
respect the law and the decisions of our judges, whether it pleases 
the government or not.'' Spain's National Court ruled last week that 
the Spanish justice system does in fact have jurisdiction to try crimes 
such as those Pinochet is charged with committing. The court said 
there are grounds to try Pinochet for genocide because he allegedly 
tried to eliminate an entire group of people _ his political opponents 
_ and that under Spanish law, Spanish courts can prosecute genocide 
no matter where it occurred. An official Chilean government report 
says more than 3,000 people died or disappeared under Pinochet's rule 
as he tried to crush a perceived communist threat. Pinochet cannot 
be tried in Chile because he has immunity as a senator for life, a 
job he created in a constitution he guided to enactment before stepping 
down in 1990. The approval by the Spanish Cabinet leaves Pinochet's 
fate in Britain's hands. After Pinochet's arrest, the British High 
Court ruled that his detention was illegal because he is entitled 
to immunity as a former head of state. A five-judge panel from Britain's 
House of Lords is hearing an appeal, which is expected to continue 
next week. If the panel rejects the High Court decision, Pinochet 
could be handed over to Spanish authorities. Should it uphold the 
earlier decision, the former dictator would likely be free to fly 
home.
