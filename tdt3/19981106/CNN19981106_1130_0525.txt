Researchers at Johns Hopkins University are among those who say they've 
grown stem cells. Joining us now is the senior author of that group 
study, Dr. John gearhart. Thank you for joining us. This could be 
a crucial step toward helping people with heart disease, parkinson's, 
many other problems. Can you tell us a little more about it? Certainly. 
For the first time, what these reports demonstrate is that it's possible 
to grow cells in a dish that have the potential of forming a wide 
variety of cell types that are found in the human body. And what we 
would look forward to in the next decade would be our ability to try 
to differentiate or to control what fate these cells would have. In 
other words, can we direct these to form cardiac muscle, in yourens, 
et cetera? And, if we are able to do this with these cells, these 
would serve as a Source for tissue transplantation therapy for some 
of the diseases you've just mentioned. Just to clarify, this is not 
growing organs, this is growing the cells? That's correct. We are 
talking about cells and tissues at this point. Okay. Now, how big 
of an advance is this? Researchers have done this work with laboratory 
mice and other animals, but never humans. Well, one must remember 
this is just a first step. It's a considerable step, but just to have 
the ability to have human cells in culture that, with these characteristics, 
the ability to differentiate, as we call it, into a wide variety of 
cell types, is a major step in the use of human material for transplantation 
therapy. All right. That's all we have time for. Thank you very much, 
Dr. John gearhart of Johns Hopkins University. The top stories are 
just two minutes away.
