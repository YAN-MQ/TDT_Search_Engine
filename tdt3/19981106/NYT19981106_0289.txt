The New York Times asked authors what book _ besides their own, of 
course _ they would most like to have written. Mary B.W. Tabor compiled 
their answers. WILLIAM STYRON wrote ``Darkness Visible: A Memoir of 
Madness,'' ``Sophie's Choice'' and other books. One that stands out 
at the moment for me is the great historian C. Vann Woodward's ``The 
Burden of Southern History'' because I'm a frustrated historian myself. 
``The Burden of History'' is so magisterial in its understanding of 
the spirit and the traditions of the South and the way they evolved 
that it's really kind of a work of almost perfect authority. E.L. 
DOCTOROW is the author of ``Ragtime,'' ``Billy Bathgate'' and other 
novels. I can think of at least 50 books I would have loved to have 
written without even trying. I haven't usually thought this way as 
a writer, because I am always so receptive as a reader. But if you 
pressed me, if there was just one book I could choose, it would be 
``Don Quixote.'' I think the whole world is in that book. JANE SMILEY 
is the author of ``A Thousand Acres,'' ``Moo'' and other novels. I'm 
ambivalent here because to wish I'd written another book is to wish 
that you were another person and in some cases to wish you were dead. 
I wish neither of those. But I guess the other person that I wish 
I could be for a while just to experience that consciousness would 
be Charles Dickens. And the book that I wish to be writing when I 
was that person would be ``Our Mutual Friend,'' his last completed 
novel. He has a very broad canvas in that book, and here he very consciously 
was trying to depict all of London life and all of the social classes' 
interaction. But the most wonderful thing about it for me is that 
he perfected his writing style so that every word is right in half 
a dozen or more ways so that the book becomes, as you are reading, 
a huge network of meanings that the more you read the more meanings 
you apprehend, and it just builds and builds and builds. It's just 
perfect from beginning to end. KINKY FRIEDMAN is the author of many 
books, including ``Road Kill'' and ``Blast From the Past.'' I wish 
I'd written ``The Great Gatsby,'' I suppose. It's a great tragic American 
love story, and to write a book like that requires a great deal of 
heartbreak. You would have to be flying on a lot of alcohol and a 
lot of different kinds of herbs and spices. You'd have to be a pretty 
unhappy American to write something like that. The (other) book I 
would have preferred to have written is ``A Fan's Notes,'' in which 
Frederick Exley very presciently saw the demise of Frank Gifford as 
an American hero. I like books by dead writers, particularly writers 
who died broke or disassociated from their times and society or died 
in the gutter. I like to think I died in the gutter and lived to tell 
about it. People outside the toxic mainstream of Middle America. WENDY 
WASSERSTEIN wrote the play ``An American Daughter'' and the screenplay 
for ``The Object of My Affection.'' I was thinking about Chekhov's 
``The Cherry Orchard.'' What appeals to me is the perfection of the 
play. He calls it a comedy and yet it captures the tones of melancholy. 
Maybe I also think it's the ultimate turn-of-the-century piece. It 
deals with the passing of time and sadness. And I like his ability 
to capture a moment, not realizing it until after its over. The other 
book I would like to have written would be ``J.K. Lasser's Your Income 
Tax'' or any of the ``For Dummies'' books. If you wrote any of those 
``For Dummies'' books, you'd know a lot of things. ANDREW WEIL wrote 
``Eight Weeks to Optimum Health'' and other books. The book I most 
wish I'd written is ``The Autobiography of a Yogi'' by Paramahansa 
Yogananda, because then I would have had all of the fabulous experiences 
he described growing up in India in the early part of this century. 
Who would not want to have known genuine gurus and living saints? 
MARIANNE WIGGINS wrote ``Almost Heaven,'' ``John Dollar'' and other 
books. I accompanied the writer-explorer Tim Severin to the South 
Pacific this summer on his current adventure, ``In Search of Moby 
Dick,'' so I took the opportunity to reread Melville's roisterous, 
rollicking masterpiece after 30-some years in preparation for our 
voyage. As a novel I marvel at, envy and revere, it rules the roost. 
Protomodern, massive, pretentious, turkey-cocking, loony and instructive, 
it is unparalleled as a handbook to what fuels the masculine in the 
American novel. Oh boy, do I wish I had written it _ wish more women 
would write with that prowess and stamina. Its failings are many; 
its rewards are unequaled in number and meaning. MARK CHILDRESS is 
the author of ``Crazy in Alabama'' and ``Gone for Good.'' I suppose 
that more than any of them I wish I'd written ``To Kill a Mockingbird,'' 
not just because it's so beautifully done and has remained so fresh, 
not just because it has provided its author with a rather nice annuity, 
but because I think that one novel has done more to change opinions 
and feelings in the South about questions of race than all the speeches, 
polemics and well-meaning tracts put together. PETER STRAUB, whose 
latest book is ``Circulo Diabolico.'' I first read Donald Harington's 
``Some Other Place. The Right Place'' in 1973. While following Harington's 
career over the intervening 25 years, I read (the book) four times 
over, always, in fact increasingly, with the knowledge of encountering 
a vast, delicate, bawdy, playful, reckless masterpiece filled with 
wit, overflowing invention, tremendous courage, technical wizardry, 
profound feeling and mysteries opening upon further, richer, more 
dazzling mysteries. Who would not wish to have written such a marvel, 
to have had the experience of writing it?
