Worries about the global economic crisis have forced many companies 
to cut back on business travel. Kalin Thomas Samuel has more in this 
edition of "working ahead." Recession in the early '90s brought drastic 
cuts in business travel. Airlines and hotels suffered. Economic analysts 
always look to the travel industry as a very good barometer as to 
what's to come. Fast forward to 1998. Corporate travel, along with 
airfares and room rates, is at peak levels. But the global economic 
crisis hit domestic shores this past summer, and some businesses cut 
travel, which is a company's third largest controllable expense. Nearly 
500 fortune 1000 companies told the national business travel association 
they're feeling the impact of the world economy. The most surprising 
thing was a domestic downturn of about 20% in what they've actually 
traveled. Nbta says corporations are sending fewer people on trips, 
increasing the use of video and teleconferencing, and trying to negotiate 
more discount rates with travel suppliers. But American express says 
business travel costs are only leveling off. It expects companies 
to spend $175 billion on travel this year. And the travel industry 
association says Americans will travel in record numbers next year.
