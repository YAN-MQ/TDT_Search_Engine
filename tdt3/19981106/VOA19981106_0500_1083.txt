Top-seeded American Pete Sampers and eighth-seeded Yvgeny Kavelnikov 
survived three-set scares to advance to the quarter final round at 
the Paris Open indoor tournament. Sampers, trying to hold onto the 
world number one ranking for the sixth straight year, rallied to beat 
Jerome Golmart of France on Thursday, 6-7, 6-4, and 6-4. He will play 
Australian Mark Filipusis, a three-sets winner over Karl Kuchera of 
Slovakia. Kavelnikov came back from a 1-5 third set deficit to beat 
ninth-seeded Tim Hemnan of Britain 6-3, 6-7, and 7-6. The Russian 
next takes on world number two Marcello Riles of Chile, who beat Vincent 
Spadea of the United States. Third-seeded Patrick Rafter of Australia 
continued his struggles as he lost a three-set thriller to Todd Martin. 
The American rallied to beat him 5-7, 7-6, 7-6, and plays compatriot 
Andre Agassi in the quarter finals. The fifth-seeded Agassi beat Switzerland's 
Marc Rosset 6-4, 6-4.
