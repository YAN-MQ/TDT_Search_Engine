World Bank President James Wolfensohn will make a brief visit to Moscow 
next Thursday to examine the country's response to its economic crisis, 
a news report said Friday. Wolfensohn is to meet Prime Minister Yevgeny 
Primakov and top economic policymakers during a stopover from Tokyo, 
the Interfax news agency reported. The International Monetary Fund 
and the World Bank this summer lined up a loan package worth more 
than dlrs 22 billion for Russia this year and next. But the installments 
have been frozen since the country's economic crisis hit in August.
