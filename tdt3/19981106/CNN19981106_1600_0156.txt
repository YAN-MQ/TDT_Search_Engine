The Middle East peace process has taken another costly hit. A car 
bomb exploded outside a crowded open-air market in Jerusalem today. 
Two suicide bombers were killed, 21 shoppers hurt. Israeli police 
say blown-apart suitcases were found in the wreckage, indicating perhaps 
the bombers intended to carry their explosives deep into the crowd. 
The Islamic fundamentalist group Hamas is claiming responsibility. 
Israeli prime minister Benjamin Netanyahu and his cabinet were discussing 
the new land-for-peace plan at the time of the blast. They suspended 
debate and have not scheduled a date for ratification talks to resume. 
President Clinton says this attempt to derail the peace process should 
come as no surprise. When prime minister Netanyahu and chairman Arafat 
signed the wye river agreement they knew they would face this moment. 
They knew when they went home both of them would be under more danger, 
and the terrorists would target innocent civilians. They knew they 
would have to Muster a lot of courage in their people to stick to 
the path of peace in the face of repeated acts of provocation. There 
are some people, you know, who have a big stake in the continuing 
misery and hatred in the Middle East. A similar bombing last year 
at the same market killed 16 people and two suicide bombers. PLO chief 
Yasser Arafat condemns today's bombing as criminal.
