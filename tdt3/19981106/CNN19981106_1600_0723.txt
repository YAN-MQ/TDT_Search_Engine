The federal communications commission says a decision on whether to 
charge consumers per-minute rates for using the Internet will be out 
in two weeks. Officials had originally planned to decide today. But 
they say they need to first consult with state regulators, who are 
meeting in Florida next week. If approved, all Internet calls -- even 
local ones -- would be classified as interstate calls. Consumer groups 
are worried the measure would result in higher bills for internet 
users. The FCC says that's not true.
