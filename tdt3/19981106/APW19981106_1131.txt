The president of the Indian Ocean nation of Comoros, which has been 
undergoing turbulence since one of its islands declared independence 
last year, has died at the age of 62, the country's religious leader 
announced Friday. Mohamed Taki Abdulkarim died overnight, the religious 
leader, Saed Mohamed Toihir, said on state radio. He provided no further 
details, but French radio said the president had suffered a heart 
attack. Abdulkarim was the fourth president of the Comoros islands 
since their independence from France in July 1975. Elections were 
to be held within three months. Meanwhile, the president of the High 
Council, Tadjidine Ben Said Massonde, will be the interim president. 
Paying tribute to Abdulkarim, U.N. Secretary-General Kofi Annan said 
that since his election on March 16, 1996 he had ``ceaselessly worked 
towards the improvement of the economic, social and political life 
of the people of his country,'' according to a spokesman. Annan expressed 
hope that the president's death ``will not be a cause of discouragement 
or a motive to foster division, but rather a catalyst for all Comorians 
to unite and seek a peaceful solution to the country's political problems,'' 
the spokesman said. Annan extended his ``heartfelt condolences'' to 
Comorians and Abdulkarim's family, and his best wishes to interim 
president Tadjiddine Said Massounde ``for a peaceful transition towards 
the holding of new elections,'' the spokesman said. Although the capital, 
Moroni, was calm on Friday, the army was mobilized to keep order. 
The three-island Federal Republic of the Comoros is in the Indian 
Ocean north of Madagascar. It has been undergoing a bitter secessionist 
conflict since August of last year, when the island of Anjouan declared 
independence and asked to be reunited with France. Paris rebuffed 
the request, saying the Comoros islands should stick together. A month 
later the government sent in troops to Anjouan in an abortive attempt 
to stop the rebellion. The defeat of the government troops emboldened 
the secessionists, but the move was rejected by all nations but Libya. 
Moheli, the smallest of the three islands, joined the move for secession 
but did not vote on it. An international conference last December 
failed to resolve the conflict, and in February, Mozambique's president 
was asked to help mediate. Anjouan was also reported calm Friday. 
Comoros depends on the export of cloves and vanilla for its foreign 
exchange earnings. The annual per capita income is less than dlrs 
200 a year. Abdulkarim was elected president in 1996, replacing President 
Said Mohamed Djohar. An engineer, he entered politics in 1967 as a 
deputy in the national assembly. When the Comoros gained independence 
in 1975, he was accused of plotting to topple the first president, 
Ali Soilih. He was imprisoned until a 1978 coup, when he became the 
assembly's president under President Ahmed Abdallah.
