It's time for today's geography stumper, and we're traveling to the 
dusty plains and mountains of a state in North Western India. The 
people here dress in striking colors, red, pink, bright yellow, lime 
green, so they stand out sharply when walking through the dull khaki 
hills. The state is home to the Rothem World Wildlife Reserve, formerly 
the private hunting ground of the Maharajahs of Jaipur. Our mystery 
destination is known as India's desert state. The country's carried 
out its nuclear tests in the Thar Desert, and sure enough, one of 
the main forms of transportation here is the camel. In fact, every 
year around this time, the largest camel fair in the world is held 
in this state in a town called Pushkar. We'll take you to the fair 
when we answer our geography quiz later this half hour.
