Three other new movies go even further and explore the themes of racism, 
hatred and evil. Sherry Sylvester has more. An elderly neighbor, the 
kid down the street and an unseen player in a child's game -- what 
do they have in common? All are subjects of three fall films that 
re-examine Nazism through varied storytelling techniques. I don't 
think it's the responsibility of art to avoid reality or to not hold 
the mirror up to things that are happening in our culture. Tough to 
make and tough to market, "American history X" uses docu-drama realism 
to depict a modern-day skinhead. See this? It means "not welcome"! 
"life is beautiful" revisits a concentration camp through a Child's 
eyes. "apt pupil" takes a Stephen king story and creates horror in 
suburbia. To the whole world, I am a monster. This movie isn't about 
socialism or racism or Nazism or fascism, it's about the pervasiveness 
of evil. One of the things the industry is dealing with right now 
is trying to find subject matter that is edgy and fresh. And they 
need to find new villains. And they need to deal with good and evil. 
That's what drama is all about. And in the case of roberto benigni, 
that is what comedy is about. Italy's favorite cinema clown took a 
huge risk with "life is beautiful," a Holocaust story with humor. 
The film won the grand jury prize at Cannes. It also won over the 
hearts of moviegoers too young to know the horrors of world war II. 
This is my contribution to the Holocaust. And I must say, 'cause I'm 
from Italy, a lot of children wrote me letters and letters. Never, 
I never received such an amount of letters. "life is beautiful" took 
in nearly $40 million in Italy alone, and may be headed for Oscar 
gold. Critics predict Oscar glory as well for "saving private Ryan," 
in which the nazis play the ever-present enemy. Clear the shingles! 
With the cold war being over, we don't have the enemy that we can 
all agree upon, you know, and movies traditionally need good guys 
and bad guys. The movies may share a common enemy, but they don't 
share the same level of success, an uncomfortable subject unlikely 
to become a trend among filmmakers. Sherri Sylvester, CNN, Los Angeles.
