White House lawyers are reviewing a letter from house Judiciary committee 
chairman Henry Hyde. It asks the president to confirm or deny under 
oath certain aspects of Ken starr's report. White House lawyers say 
they will answer the letter as expeditiously as possible. CNN has 
learned the letter is more than nine pages and asks 81 questions. 
Hyde says quick answers to the questions will allow his committee 
to speed up the impeachment inquiry by calling just one major witness, 
independent counsel Ken Starr.
