Ask anyone in the fashion business what is going to be fashionable 
tomorrow, and at the very least, they will hesitate. Ask anyone what 
will be fashionable among teenagers, or to be more precise, what is 
cool and they will tell you that if they were absolutely sure they'd 
be rich and famous. ABC's Gina Smith on the search for cool. If you 
don't know what it is, you're not it. Cool is completely in the eye 
of the beholder. Cool is about confidence and it's about comfortability. 
Matt diamond defines it in more practical terms. It's about $120 billion 
market what teens spend themselves. Alloy designs in New York City 
is trying to get as much of that allowance and part-time job money 
that it can. A shirt from the alloy catalog made it on TV's "buffy 
the vampire slayer." And that's cool. Alloy stays ahead of fashion 
trends by sending cool hunters into the community looking for the 
kids who start trends. This kid's pretty cool. He's got a good sense 
of style. What Karen NGO finds in the streets of New York will end 
up in alloy's catalog. If it's not too weird. 'cause their mom's have 
the credit cards. It's like they can't buy anything unless their parents 
approve it. Parents spend as much on teenagers as they spend on themselves. 
That makes the market worth more than $200 billion. No marketing executive 
is going to want to lose his share of that kind of money. So companies 
have to live in fear of becoming uncool. That would be my biggest 
nightmare, one day you're cool, the next day you're not. James Hardaway 
is in charge of making sure Reebok stays cool. He crisscrosses the 
country trying out next years styles on the teenagers that will buy 
them. The coolest teenagers often buy a pair a month. These guys buy 
three a year and they know what they don't like. Adidas. I don't like 
Adidas. But they tell us there's a rumor on the street that hip-Hopper 
puff daddy is going to wear reeboks in a new music video. He wears 
them. They'll buy them. He's cool. 16-year-old Rachel Smith, it's 
her coat. Next year it will probably end up in malls around the country, 
but Rachel won't like dressing like everyone else. Then you've gotta 
change. And the cool Hunt begins again. Gina Smith, ABC News, New 
York.
