Still to come on THE WORLD, America's passion statement to Europe 
on PRI. That's Public Radio International. I'm Dane Gottlieb. And 
on the next "Voices in the Family," a visit to Temple Hospital's cardiac 
care unit where patients are waiting for a new heart. I'm hoping for 
a bright future, a happy future, but you know, if it doesn't happen, 
then I'll deal with that. I've cried, you know, but then I get over 
it, and I just look to the future. That's Sunday morning at here on 
91 FM, WHYY. Are you baffled by your computer, amazed at the pace 
of high tech living? Still think that Java is a coffee bean, and Windows 
need cleaning? Hi, I'm Ira Flatow inviting you to join me each Friday 
as we talk about science and technology and try to make sense of this 
dizzying world clones and computers, digits and DNA. That's on "Talk 
of the Nation Science Friday" FROM NPR News. Fridays at and 9:00 p.m. 
on 91 FM. This is THE WORLD. I'm Lisa Mullins.
