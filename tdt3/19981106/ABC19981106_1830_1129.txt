John Glenn and his crewmates on the shuttle "discovery" took their 
last turns around the world today. They're returning to earth tomorrow, 
although maybe to California rather than Florida, depending on the 
weather. They have done a lot of work the last eight days, including 
several experiments on a single flower. ABC's Bill Blakemore on what 
happens to a rose when it goes into orbit. Shakespeare's Romeo said, 
"A rose by any other name would smell as sweet." But what if it blossomed 
in space? Would weightlessness change how it smells? Onboard "discovery" 
is the first ornamental flowering plant in space, a Miniature rose 
called "overnight scent-sation." They're investigating the flower's 
scent molecules. In normal gravity on earth, they may come together 
like this. But in weightlessness, the molecules may feel free to come 
together, say, like this. So that when they enter your sniffing nose 
they may smell, like nothing ever smelled before. The astronauts use 
this needle to collect scent molecules from the space rose and bring 
them back to earth. From this information then, we will recreate the 
odor of the miniature rose when it comes from the space. Weightless 
rose molecules may turn out to smell like fish or an oil refinery. 
But if they smell new and nice, then braja mookerjee of international 
flavors and fragrance, who is behind the experiment, may name the 
new fragrance out of this world or -- Heavenly fragrance, made in 
heaven. They'll know within 24 hours after the shuttle lands if they 
really do have something that's heaven scent. Bill Blakemore, ABC 
News.
