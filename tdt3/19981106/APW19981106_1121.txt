Gov. Pedro Rossello spent a second consecutive day Friday giving depositions 
in a lawsuit filed against him and other government officials by the 
island's largest newspaper. ``The governor feels at peace and is confident 
in the end the truth will prevail,'' said the governor's spokesman, 
Pedro Rosario Urdaz, who is also named in the lawsuit. Rosario, who 
spent three days giving depositions in the discovery phase of the 
suit, said most of the defendants have already completed their statements. 
The newspaper and Puerto Rican Cement, both of which are principally 
owned by the same family, accused Rossello and six other officials 
of trying to punish the newspaper for critical coverage by withdrawing 
government advertising. The federal court lawsuit further accuses 
the defendants of abusing government power to attack Puerto Rican 
Cement's business. Rossello has denied all the charges. The case drew 
international attention when the Inter-American Press Association 
issued a resolution criticizing the government and backing the newspaper's 
position.
