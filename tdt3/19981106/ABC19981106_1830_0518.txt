Elsewhere in the Middle East, there has been another carefully timed 
car bomb in a market in Jerusalem. The market was crowded with people. 
The car was already on fire as it came into the market, which people 
took as a cue to run. When the car exploded, 21 people were wounded, 
but the only two who died were in the car. Palestinians and Israelis 
are sure that this was the work of extremists trying to derail the 
latest Israeli/Palestinian peace agreements. When the bomb went off, 
the Israeli cabinet was debating the latest agreement which the U.S. 
helped to negotiate, the Israeli government immediately put the deal 
on hold. ABC's Gillian Findlay reports for us on what's going on in 
Jerusalem tonight. The shock had barely worn off when the anger in 
the market erupted. We want revenge, they shouted. This is peace, 
this man asked? It's a question the Israeli government was also quick 
to ask We see absolutely no action, in fact, a deliberate inaction 
in terms of the war against terrorism. And that cannot continue. The 
Israelis say it's not so hard to stop the terror. The Palestinians 
must outlaw more opposition groups, confiscate more weapons and arrest 
more suspected militants. The Palestinians argue it's not that easy. 
For one thing, today's bombers passed through Israeli checkpoints, 
too. In the past two weeks, Palestinian police have cracked down, 
arrested dozens of Hamas supporters, put the organization's spiritual 
leader under house arrest. Everything's being done. And the last thing 
we need is Israeli officials coming out and pointing fingers at us. 
We are not their enemy. We're supposed to be their partner in this 
process. When they signed their peace agreement, both Israelis and 
palestinians said they knew extremists would fry to destroy it. The 
only way to fight that, they agreed, was to forge ahead and make peace 
work. That was Palestinian chairman Yasser Arafat's message tonight 
as he made a Rare appearance on Israeli television to condemn the 
attack and assure israel his crackdown will continue. Mr. Arafat's 
problem is while his crackdown may please Israel, it's already costing 
him support among his own people. And that could be dangerous, too.
