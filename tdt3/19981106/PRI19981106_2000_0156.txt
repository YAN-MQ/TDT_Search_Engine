The worst violence since late September erupted today in the Serbian 
province of Kosovo. According to government sources, five suspected 
members of the ethnic Albanian Kosovo Liberation Army died in a shoot-out 
with police. Nick Thorpe reports from Belgrade. There have been daily 
reports of shooting incidents in Kosovo despite the cease fire, but 
this was clearly the worst so far, leaving five uniformed members 
of the Kosovo Liberation Army dead. A partial withdrawal of Yugoslav 
security forces from the province in mid-October still left an estimated 
25,000 police and soldiers on the government's side. As the refugees 
have begun to cautiously return to their villages, so have these soldiers 
of the Separatist Army. As both sides regroup their forces, violence 
has been partly avoided, thanks to local deals mediated by Western 
observers. But the much heralded Kosovo verification mission is still 
not in place, leaving parts of the province without visible security. 
And the more deaths on either side, the bigger the danger of reprisals. 
For NPR News, I'm Nick Thorpe in Belgrade.
