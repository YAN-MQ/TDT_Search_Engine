JAKARTA, Indonesia _ PT Astra International, Indonesia's largest automaker, 
offered its creditors two choices Friday: cash out and take a sizable 
loss or join its debt-revamping plan and hope for an improvement in 
the languishing Indonesian economy. `What Astra would like to request 
is time,'' Astra International president Rini Soewandi said in an 
interview after a seven-hour closed meeting with creditors from Japan, 
Europe and the United States. The meeting was a follow-up to one in 
October, when the company announced it was halting payment on $1.4 
billion in loans. Astra said it would offer creditors who wanted to 
get out a chance to do so through a ``Dutch auction'' in which the 
company would set aside $70 million to buy back debt ``at a significant 
discount.'' ``Everybody has the same right and can put in a bid and 
whoever puts in the lowest bid will be able to get out,'' Ms. Soewandi 
said, ``but the amount we buy back will not be more than $70 million.'' 
Lenders to Astra International not interested in taking the loss, 
or failing to qualify, will be repaid in three installments at later, 
still to be determined dates, presumably, when the economy has improved. 
Immediate reactions to the revamping plan, which has been in the planning 
stage since August, were impossible to gauge, with creditors leaving 
the meeting saying they had signed confidentiality agreements. Astra 
has been praised by analysts as one of the only Indonesian companies 
to address its portion of the country's staggering private-sector 
foreign debt problem, estimated at more than $67 billion. Its main 
sources of revenue have dried up since August 1997, when the Indonesian 
currency was trading around 2,400 to the dollar. With the devaluation 
of the rupiah, which closed the week at 8,300 to the dollar, the car 
sales of Astra have been only 30,489 this year, off sharply from the 
173,457 total of 1997. Astra _ the local assembler of Toyota, Daihatsu 
and Isuzu _ predicts just 25,000 sales in 1999. Operating losses are 
projected to rise from 316 billion rupiah in 1998 to 894 billion in 
1999. ``Our cash balance has been depleted because our operational 
cash is not sufficient,'' said Dorys Herlambang, the company's finance 
director. ``We have been using our cash reserves.'' Herlambang said 
the company's cash reserves had dwindled to 300 billion rupiah and 
it was now in discussions to sell holdings in Honda, Isuzu and Daihatsu 
as well as stakes in PT Berau Coal and PT Pama Persada, a mining contractor. 
In addition to the decline in car sales, motorcycle sales at PT Federal 
Motors, the company's main motorcycle production unit, have fallen 
75 percent and sales of heavy machinery at PT United Tractor have 
plunged 90 percent. More than 70 percent of Astra's debt is owed to 
Japanese banks, including the Long-Term Credit Bank, Mitsubishi Trust 
and Banking, Dai-Ichi Kangyo Bank, Sanwa Bank, Industrial Bank of 
Japan, Fuji Bank, Sumitomo, Sakura Bank and Marubeni. The company's 
next meeting with creditors _ which also include Paribas and Societe 
Generale of France, Chase Manhattan, Commerzbank of Germany and ABN-Amro 
Bank of the Netherlands _ is scheduled for two weeks from now in Singapore.
