The death toll in Central America from Hurricane Mitch continues to 
rise as authorities find more victims of the floods and mud slides 
in the region. An estimated 11,000 people have been killed, and authorities 
fear many more may die from hunger or disease. VOA's Bill Rogers reports 
from the Nicaraguan capital. Nicaraguan President Arnoldo Aliman says 
about 3,800 people have been killed in his country by the flooding 
and massive landslides caused by the torrential rains of Hurricane 
Mitch. In an interview with a Mexican television station, Mr. Aliman 
said this death toll figure is not based on an estimate but from actual 
body counts. The Nicaraguan leader went on to make an impassioned 
plea for medicines to be rushed to Nicaragua, expressing concern over 
a possible outbreak of cholera or other illnesses. In Honduras, authorities 
say close to 7,000 people are dead, but warned the death toll could 
go even higher. Some 11,000 people are reported to be missing. In 
flood-damaged areas of both Honduras and Nicaragua, food and uncontaminated 
drinking water are in short supply. However, international aid has 
begun to pour in from the United States, Mexico, and other countries. 
Meanwhile, a new worry has emerged, land mines. Honduran military 
authorities warn thousands of these mines planted during the region's 
conflict in the 1980s could be unearthed by the flooding and erosion.
