Some of our local FM and medium-wave affiliates are about to take 
a two-minute break. We'll be back, though, with more of NEWS NOW. 
It is Friday, November 6, 1998. On this date 30 years ago, President-elect 
Richard Nixon met with reporters following his victory over Democrat 
Hubert Humphrey and one of the most contentious presidential elections 
of the 20th century. The election had been held the day before, but 
the race was tight, and the outcome was not determined until later 
the next morning. Mr. Nixon said his administration would be open 
to new ideas and he spoke about the theme of his presidency, bring 
America together. How he said he got that idea, at a small town, Dreschler, 
Ohio, when a teenager held up a sign bearing those words. A few enterprising 
news reporters went to Dreschler to interview the teenaged girl who 
had held up the sign. She told them that somebody from the Nixon campaign 
committee had handed her the sign moments before the candidate arrived. 
On November 6, 1894, the powerful New York political institution known 
as Tammany Hall began to crumble. The organization, sometimes called

offices were located. The political destruction took place when a 
wave of public indignation defeated Tammany Hall's candidates for 
mayor and swept Tammany's entire slate of candidates from city office. 
History awards part of the credit for the defeat of the corrupt political 
organization to Charles Parkhurst. He's a clergyman. The Reverend 
Parkhurst often visited New York City slums in the company of a sympathetic 
policeman. He used his Sunday sermons to reveal the poverty that he 
had seen. New York newspapers reported his calls for action against 
the political machine that had embezzled city money and that was intended 
to help the poor. That did it. Tammany Hall was out of office. 29;35
