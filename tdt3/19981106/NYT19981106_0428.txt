In an abrupt reversal that ends a tangled legal and literary confrontation, 
Farrar, Straus &AMP; Giroux said Friday that it had canceled plans 
to publish a retelling of ``Lolita'' from the nymphet's point of view, 
in part because of copyright concerns by some of the publishing house's 
own writers. The estate of Vladimir Nabokov filed suit in federal 
court in October to block American and British publication of the 
book, ``Lo's Diary,'' by Pia Pera, an Italian short-story writer, 
calling it a ``rip-off'' of the legally protected original, published 
in 1955. The new novel, in the form of a diary by Lolita giving her 
version of the scandalous love affair with her stepfather, has been 
published to mixed reviews in Italy and six other countries. The lawsuit, 
which Farrar, Straus &AMP; Giroux contested and has now agreed to 
settle, raised far-reaching questions that lawyers said had never 
been resolved by the courts, including the degree to which a character 
in a copyrighted literary work can be reused by another author. Ms. 
Pera, reached in Italy, said she deplored the decision but that she 
did not plan to sue. Lawyers said it was not clear whether MacMillan, 
which had planned to bring out the book in Britain and was named as 
a co-defendant with Farrar, Straus in the lawsuit, intended to proceed 
with publication. Roger Straus, president and chief executive of the 
publishing house, said he decided to cancel its planned publication 
next July despite objections from his editor in chief, Jonathan Galassi, 
in response to concerns by some of his writers that their creations 
could be appropriated through the same literary license claimed by 
Farrar, Straus. The publishing house is now owned by Holtzbrinck, 
the German publishing conglomerate, but the decision against publication 
was made by Straus alone, all parties agreed. Straus said he had been 
questioning his decision to publish ``Lo's Diary'' since the uproar 
began. `` `Is this good for literature or bad for literature?' is 
the question we have been asking ourselves,'' he said. ``Are we standing 
up for writers and for literature by proceeding to publish Pia Pera 
or by acceding to the wishes of the Nabokov estate?'' In the end, 
he said, ``I don't think it right for any publisher to feed off the 
reputation of a literary person.'' He declined to name any of the 
authors who had voiced concern about the planned publication. The 
cancellation was welcomed by Peter Skolnik, a lawyer for Dmitri Nabokov, 
the sole heir and executor of his father's estate. ``Dmitri is, of 
course, enormously pleased and joins me in thinking it is the right 
outcome for the right reasons,'' Skolnik said. He said the decision 
to sue had also been difficult because, given the history of controversy 
over ``Lolita,'' ``few writers have stood more for the right of free 
expression than Nabokov.'' But the estate had to respond to what he 
called ``esthetic and literary vampirism,'' Skolnick added. If the 
appropriation claimed by Farrar, Straus and Ms. Pera had been allowed 
to stand, he said, ``the next author is free to say, `Ahh, there's 
a good idea: I'll tell it from the perspective of a another character.''' 
Why would motion picture producers pay writers for their creations 
``if they could just change the perspective and get away with it?'' 
he added. Leon Friedman, a lawyer for Farrar, Straus who had been 
prepared to defend the book as a ``fair use'' and artistic transformation 
of Nabokov's work, called Straus' action ``a literary decision.'' 
From the Greek legend of ``Pygmalion,'' which became a George Bernard 
Shaw play and then ``My Fair Lady,'' literary characters and entire 
works have long been fodder for other writers but usually the works 
are out of copyright. ``Lolita,'' published in the United States by 
Random House, is under copyright until the year 2030. Ms. Pera, 42, 
reached at home in the Tuscan countryside near Lucca, said she had 
heard about the cancellation only hours before in a call from one 
of her editors. ``I was disappointed,'' she said. ``I thought they 
were going to fight for it. This way we will never know if we could 
have won.'' ``I feel what is at stake here are two fundamental rights 
clashing: property rights and the right of free expression,'' she 
said. ``My book is on some kind of frontier between the two.'' She 
said that if it were possible to secure publication by giving up any 
economic gain from her book, she would agree. She also said she did 
not intend to sue Farrar, Straus to enforce publication. The book, 
first published in Italy in 1995, later came out in Brazil, Spain, 
the Netherlands, Germany, Finland and Greece. It was also bought by 
a French publisher who later dropped it and turned out to be a cousin 
of Dmitri Nabokov, Ms. Pera said. Skolnik said although the Nabokov 
estate did not sue those publishers at the time, legal action was 
still under consideration. Straus' decision to cancel publication 
was strongly opposed by Galassi, editor in chief and executive vice 
president at Farrar, Straus, and by Ethan Nosowsky, the editor who 
worked with Galassi to prepare the manuscript for publication. Straus 
said they had argued strenuously for publication but not acrimoniously. 
``It was an intellectual debate, not who shot John,'' he said. He 
also said the case raised important questions that would remain unresolved, 
at least until another publisher came along to take up the book. ``From 
a lawyer's point of view,'' Straus said, ``it would have been a delicious 
case.''
