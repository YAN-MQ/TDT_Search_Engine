President Clinton condemned today's car bomb attack on a Jerusalem 
market, but he said Israeli and Palestinian leaders must not allow 
the attack to delay implementation of he latest Mid East peace agreement. 
Two car bombers killed themselves and injured 21 other people today 
when their car blew up at a crowded produce market in Jerusalem. The 
Israeli Cabinet suspended its debate on the Y agreement indefinitely 
after the blast.
