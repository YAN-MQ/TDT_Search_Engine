The Israeli Cabinet had convened for a second day in an attempt to 
approve the Wye agreement. ``To our sorrow, since the Wye agreement 
... there has been relentless terrorist attacks against Israeli citizens,'' 
according to a Cabinet statement read on the radio. Israel radio quoted 
officials saying the Cabinet would also decide to renew construction 
of the Har Homa neighborhood in the traditionally Arab sector of Jerusalem. 
Groundbreaking there in March 1997 led to a break-off in negotiations 
with the Palestinians.
