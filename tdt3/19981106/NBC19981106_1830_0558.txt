Now to the Middle East where once again terrorism has threatened the 
search for peace. This time, another car bomb in Jerusalem that killed 
the bombers and wounded 21 shoppers in an open air market. Another 
attempt to sabotage the peace deal President Clinton brokered just 
last month. And today he said, this was not unexpected. When prime 
minister Netanyahu and chairman Arafat signed the wye river agreement, 
they knew they would face this moment. They knew when they went home, 
both of them would be under more danger and that terrorists would 
target innocent civilians. For more on the bombing and what it means 
to both sides, here is NBC's martin Fletcher in Israel. 9:45 A.M., 
Jerusalem. It's the busiest time of the week in the biggest vegetable 
market. Two men in a red Fiat packed with explosives smash into a 
market stall. The car engine smoking. People run for their lives. 
Then, a massive explosion. Across the road, a security camera catches 
the moment. This man Shields his pregnant wife. As shoppers in a pharmacy 
dive to the floor. The bombers drove up this road and wanted to turn 
right into the crowded market. But they couldn't. A truck unloading 
vegables blocked their way. At the time of the blast, less than a 
mile away, the Israeli cabinet debates whether to accept the peace 
deal signed with the Palestinians two weeks ago in Washington. The 
main concern -- security and terrorism. Then word comes of the explosion 
at 10:00, the cabinet session abruptly ends. Two bombers died in the 
blast. 21 Israelis were wounded, the third attack by the Islamic militants 
Hamas in three weeks. 8:15 tonight on TV, Yasser Arafat condemned 
the blast as criminal. Last week, he cracked down on Hamas, arresting 
its top leadership. But why has it been so difficult for Arafat to 
stop these attacks? The Hamas terror network is very hard to penetrate. 
Even the top leadership does not know the identities of its several 
hundred fighters. Local commanders recruit members for specific acts 
of terror, like today's suicide bombings. If you want to corner them, 
isolate them, and eliminate them, you have to pay the price for it. 
Tonight, the Israeli cabinet has suspended debate on the peace deal 
until Arafat forces the terrorists to halt their bombing campaign.
