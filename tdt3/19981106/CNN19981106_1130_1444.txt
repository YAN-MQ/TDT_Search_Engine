The new movie "the siege" is under siege by some Muslim groups. The 
movie depicts what happens when martial law is imposed in New York, 
following a series of terrorist bombings ordered by an Islamic cleric. 
Members of a Detroit Muslim organization previewed the film, which 
opens nationwide today. They say the movie promotes Negative stereotypes 
of Islam. The director of the film says it was intended to show the 
dangers of such stereotyping.
