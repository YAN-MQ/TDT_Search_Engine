World Champion France will play England in a soccer friendly early 
next year at London's Wembley Stadium, the French Football Federation 
said Friday. The match, the first between the two nations since England 
beat France 1-0 in June 1997, is scheduled for Feb. 10, FFF spokesman 
Jean-Yves Le Huede said. France is also arranging a match against 
Morocco in Marseille on Jan. 20. Both matches will serve as preparation 
for France's March 27 European Championship qualifier against Ukraine. 
France's calendar has been eased since pulling out of the Jan. 8-20 
Confederations Cup in Mexico. France withdrew after several European 
clubs complained about losing their French stars.
