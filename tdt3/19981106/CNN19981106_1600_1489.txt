An ice storm in New York state last winter apparently didn't heat 
things up on the home front. Health officials had predicted a baby 
boom in October, nine months after the storm hit and the lights went 
out. But maternity wards report October deliveries were at or below 
average. The head of an obstetrics unit says she thinks baby-making 
was the last thing on everybody's minds. She thinks the real boom 
may come this month nine months after the power came back on.
