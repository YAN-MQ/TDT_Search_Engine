the U.S. Justice Department says a federal grand jury has indicted 
a former Army intelligence analyst on charges of spying for the Soviet 
KGB, beginning in 1988. The Justice Department said Thursday that 
46-year-old David Sheldon Boone was paid $60,000 over three years 
by the Soviet spy agency for several top secret documents. He was 
arrested last month after a U.S. agent posing as a Russian gave Mr. 
Boone $9,000. I'm Becky Bailey, VOA news.
