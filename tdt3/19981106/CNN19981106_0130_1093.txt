Kellogg is moving beyond the breakfast table. The nation's largest 
cerealmaker says it will introduce a new line of foods that actively 
work to lower cholesterol. Kellogg will call its new line ensemble. 
It will include frozen entrees, dry pasta and cookies. The products 
will be available nationwide in the fall of next year.
