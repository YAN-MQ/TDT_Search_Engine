Internet users now have the luxury of making long-distance phone calls 
at local prices. But telephone companies want to take that luxury 
away and it's up to the fCC to find a middle ground. Rick Lockridge 
has more in this edition of "tech trends." Paul elia builds web sites. 
He works out of the basement of his home. He says his business will 
not grow unless the Internet does, too. So if Internet traffic becomes 
more expensive, Internet traffic will go down. And that will definitely 
affect us. Right now, most Internet calls are billed as local, even 
when they connect to faraway computers. Long distance carriers have 
been squabbling for years over who should pay for those connections. 
If the FCC decides to call Internet phone calls "interstate" instead 
of "Local," the long distance carriers could charge for them accordingly. 
That could mean higher Internet access rates for many. I believe there 
would be a great outcry from the public. Cary howell is CEO of an 
Internet service provider. What we would have to do at that time is 
reevaluate whether or not we just increase the base per-month charge 
or if we increase it to an hourly or per-minute connect rate. The 
new charges might not happen. The FCC has a history of protecting 
Internet users from higher telephone fees. But even if the agency 
rules otherwise this time, the threat of competition from cable modems 
and other technologies might persuade telephone companies to keep 
their prices down. Still, in the short term, by-the-minute phone fees 
could take a toll -- particularly on schools and small businesses 
like Paul elia's. Unfortunately, I'm going to have to absorb the increased 
cost. What we're going to have to do is get smarter about the time 
we spend online. Congress recently passed a moratorium on new Internet 
taxes, feeling that such taxes could have a chilling effect on the 
Internet. Now the FCC will have to decide whether by-the-minute phone 
charges could have a similarly harmful effect. Rick Lockridge, CNN, 
Atlanta.
