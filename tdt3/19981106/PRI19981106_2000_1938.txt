Rwanda is admitting for the first time that it's troops are involved 
in the fighting in the democratic republic of Congo. They're helping 
rebel forces trying to overthrow President Laurent Kabila. Regional 
leaders warn the conflict could spark a wider African war. The BBC's 
Jeremy Vine reports from Johannesburg. Rwanda has switched positions. 
Having claimed for so long its troops were not involved in the war 
in Congo, it now admits they were and still are. The official denials 
which have been triggered every time Rwanda was criticized for fueling 
the conflict were looking more and more ragged not least because Rwandan 
troops had actually been seen on the ground in the former Zaire. They've 
been helping the rebels in their efforts to overthrow President Laurent 
Kabila who is backed by Zimbabwe and Angola. Jeremy Vine reporting.
