Today marks the end of fashion week in New York, and several American 
designers were conspicuous by their absence. From our business desk 
in New York, THE WORLD's Liz George explains. Those big name designers 
and up and coming trendsetters alike have deserted America's week-long 
fashion showcase this year, preferring to concentrate their energies 
instead on producing lines for the mass market. Young American designer, 
Todd Oldham, is one of those who believes there's more money to be 
made at the cheaper end of the scale. This time we wanted to give 
it a different go around so corporately, based on many different factors, 
we decided to close our wholesaling division of the collection and 
not have a show this time in New York Fashion Week. We've had 18 very 
successful shows in the past, but it just felt now instinctively and 
hearing rumblings from the market and what I've always wanted to do 
with the clothes, it's a good time to try to branch out and work our 
lines that are more financial accessible. Other designers have also 
found the market for glitzy gowns as dried up, as consumers worldwide 
are forced to make budget cuts to cope with the impact of the global 
economic crisis. Why would you spend 1200 when you can get exactly 
the same look for 200 or less? Mary Lou Luther is the creative director 
of Fashion Group International. She believes the American trends towards 
the mass market is likely to filter through to designers in Europe. 
In this country, it's more casual. It's easier, it's sportier. And 
so far, this has been the big export to Europe. For the first time, 
young French women are understanding casual sporty clothes. And the 
American designers who now design for European companies like Salene, 
Briton, Loevay, Duruti, that they're all being very well accepted 
in Europe. America's fashion industry is worth around $85 billion, 
and so far, it's managed to escape the worst of the fallout from the 
global financial difficulties. For THE WORLD, I'm Liz George in New 
York.
