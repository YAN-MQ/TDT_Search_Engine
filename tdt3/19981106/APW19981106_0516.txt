An Irish Republican Army escapee at the center of a marathon legal 
battle to stay in the United States was the latest convict paroled 
Friday under terms of Northern Ireland's peace accord. Joe Doherty, 
sentenced to life in abstentia for killing a British army commando 
in 1980, walked free from the anti-terrorist Maze prison, six years 
after losing a U.S. Supreme Court appeal against extradition. Doherty 
and seven IRA comrades shot their way out of Belfast's Crumlin Road 
Jail during their 1981 trials, after swapping clothes with their visiting 
lawyers. The others were recaptured, but Doherty used a fake Irish 
passport to reach New York. The FBI found and arrested Doherty working 
in a Manhattan bar in 1983. During his fight to stay in the United 
States, he won broad support from the city's Irish-American lobby, 
even having a street named after him and being honored as grand marshall 
of a St. Patrick's Day parade. Upon his return, he became one of the 
IRA's wing commanders within the Maze prison, which has seen its population 
tumble ever since eight political parties struck April's historic 
accord on how Protestants and Catholics should jointly govern Northern 
Ireland. Three of the Maze's eight H-shaped cell blocks already have 
closed, with more than 200 of an eligible 450 prisoners freed in the 
past two months. The rest are supposed to be paroled by mid-2000 if 
the IRA and rival outlawed pro-British groups maintain their cease-fires. 
Three other IRA escapees from Northern Ireland are continuing to fight 
extradition from California back to the Maze prison, from which they 
and 35 other IRA members escaped in 1983. Last month in San Francisco, 
the trio won the right to a retrial and bail. Also Friday, Irish Prime 
Minister Bertie Ahern returned to Belfast for the second time this 
week to challenge the prevailing deadlock in the peace process, meeting 
with Sinn Fein party leader Gerry Adams. April's agreement specified 
that a new cross-community government for Northern Ireland should 
have begun holding summits by now with Ahern's government. But the 
designated head of the still-unformed Northern Ireland government, 
Protestant politician David Trimble, has refused to form one until 
Sinn Fein's IRA allies start disarming, an objective in the accord 
that the IRA has rejected.
