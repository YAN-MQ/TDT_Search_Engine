Paul Ince was fined 1,500 pounds (dlrs 2,500) by the Football Association 
on Friday for making an obscene gesture after being sent during England's 
Euro 2000 qualifier against Sweden. The Liverpool midfielder, who 
made the gesture as he walked off the pitch in Stockholm on Sept. 
5, was found guilty of misconduct by an FA disciplinary commission. 
The FA said Ince apologized for his action. ``Both the player and 
Liverpool FC pointed out he had already been punished with a suspension 
by UEFA arising from the dismissal,'' the statement said. Ince was 
sent off after receiving a second yellow card in England's 2-1 defeat 
in Stockholm. He later claimed his gesture was made towards England's 
assistant coach John Gorman, but coach Glenn Hoddle later insisted 
that was not the case. Ince received another red card Tuesday night 
during Liverpool's UEFA Cup match in Spain against Valencia, and now 
faces a minimum three-match European ban.
