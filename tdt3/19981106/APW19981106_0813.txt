The United Nations plans to reduce its team of weapons inspectors 
in Iraq because Baghdad has banned all inspections and monitoring 
activities, a spokesman said Friday. The decision to pull back about 
20 percent of the permanent staff dealing with weapons inspections 
was disclosed less than 24 hours after the U.N. Security Council demanded 
that Iraq reverse its decision to end all cooperation with the U.N. 
inspectors. ``This partial paring back doesn't affect our ability 
to be up and running if and when Iraq decides to rescind its decision,'' 
said Ewen Buchanan, spokesman for the U.N. Special Commission, which 
is charged with eliminating Iraq's weapons of mass destruction. The 
commission, known by its initials as UNSCOM, will withdraw 26 people 
starting Saturday, Buchanan said. UNSCOM has a permanent staff of 
about 120 people. ``It makes no sense to keep high-powered people 
sitting there doing nothing when presumably they all have jobs to 
do in their own countries,'' he said. ``These people are all on loan 
to us from governments. ... We are wasting a resource.'' Iraq stopped 
short of expelling the inspectors when it banned all UNSCOM monitoring 
activities Oct. 31, except changing film and cassettes on stationary 
cameras. The Iraqis halted spot inspections of weapons facilities 
on Aug. 5. The Security Council unanimously passed a resolution condemning 
Iraq and demanding that it rescind the ban. But council members are 
still divided on whether the resolution authorizes military force 
to make Iraq comply.
