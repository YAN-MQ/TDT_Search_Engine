The wildfire success of ``Listening to Prozac'' made Dr. Peter Kramer 
possibly the best-known psychiatrist in America _ and, with the headlines 
pigeonholing him as the ``Pied Piper of Prozac,'' possibly the most 
misunderstood. Kramer's 1993 book captured a revolutionary moment 
in psychiatry, the advent of an exciting new class of anti-depressants. 
But he was never painting the portrait of a panacea. He never would. 
For as his work since then _ a nuanced book about relationships and 
a novel-in-progress about an anarchist _ bears out, he, like psychotherapy 
itself, is neither smooth nor easy. In ``Listening to Prozac,'' Kramer 
was raising knotty questions, in part about what he called ``cosmetic 
psychopharmacology'': whether new drugs should be used not only to 
help mentally ill people, but to take essentially normal people and 
make them psychologically ``better than well,'' more confident, more 
assertive, more attractive. But in sound-bite America, at a moment 
when millions were trying out the new, low-side-effect anti-depressants, 
his message somehow morphed into a one-dimensional ``Prozac is good.'' 
In fact, said Dr. Harold Alan Pincus, director of the office of research 
of the American Psychiatric Association, ``Peter is as far away from 
being a simple pill-pusher as anyone I can imagine.'' In a morning's 
conversation in his office by the Brown University campus, where he 
teaches, Kramer seemed strikingly incapable of choosing the easy way 
or the unambiguous message, especially, the take-two-aspirin solution. 
He says his role is rather to raise arguments and then undermine them, 
to offer hard two-handed criticism of contemporary culture at large, 
discussing, for example, how attitudes toward Prozac reflect the society 
that fell in love with it. ``I have a highly analytic side where analytic 
means critical,'' he said. ``I seem to be built to see the flaws in 
the argument on either side, and that might be a different talent 
than theory-building.'' Combine that with a knack for choosing hot 
or about-to-be-hot topics on the psychiatric scene, and the topics 
of his books begin to make a certain kind of sense, dovetailing with 
a moment when new scientific understanding of the brain is seeping 
into the practice of psychiatry and into the general consciousness. 
Last year Kramer came out with ``Should You Leave?'' a book whose 
cut-and-dried title was belied by its nuanced discussion of the serpentine 
complexities of couple relationships. Though not a blockbuster like 
``Listening to Prozac,'' it has won broad attention. Before ``Listening 
to Prozac'' he wrote ``Moments of Engagement,'' subtitled ``Intimate 
Psychotherapy in a Technological Age.'' In that book, Kramer describes 
enlightening moments in his professional life, allowing the reader 
``to look over the doctor's shoulder.'' He raises a cluster of issues 
including the biological basis of personality, with accompanying questions 
about, say, the chemical basis of adolescent angst. `` `Moments of 
Engagement' is about the therapy process,'' said Dr. Jeffrey Blum, 
a psychologist and old friend of Kramer's. `` `Listening to Prozac' 
is about the use of medication in psychiatry and `Should You Leave?' 
is really a book about family therapy or couples therapy; so the three 
books are dividing up the main parts of the field. It's somebody going 
through our whole body of knowledge in psychology and psychiatry and 
pulling out what's relevant and helpful now. Freud wrote in the year 
1900; we're entering the year 2000.'' In that mode, Kramer has used 
his prominence as something of a psychiatric public-health booster. 
(This, despite the conflict he sees between his obligation as a physician 
to inform and ``the obligations of a writer, where I think the prime 
value is ambiguity, elusiveness, being more disturbing than conclusive.'') 
Among the points Kramer explores in ``Should You Leave?,'' for example, 
is his sense that ``depression causes divorce as often as divorce 
causes depression.'' He has found himself emphasizing the point that 
depression is often under-diagnosed, he said, partly because he has 
been disturbed by how often break-ups could have been avoided if only 
a depressed person had received treatment. ``Peter has had both a 
public and a professional impact,'' said Donald Klein, director of 
research at the New York State Psychiatric Institute and author of 
``Understanding Depression'' (Oxford, 1993). ``The public impact was 
to legitimize the use of medications in a broader range of conditions, 
because the general feeling had been that if you take medication, 
you've got to be crazy. The idea that medication could have more subtle 
effects _ people didn't know that. And the profession also has benefited 
from that realization.'' Klein added that Kramer's work also walks 
a middle road in psychiatry between the two principal camps: those 
who favor medication and those who favor talk therapy. Kramer's commentary 
on psychiatry is almost invariably interlaced with a broader critique 
of American culture. With the novel he is now writing about an anarchist, 
he seems to be shifting further in that direction. The story ``very 
much has to do with values of the 60's and what happened to them,'' 
he said. ``And could one logically have held them for a longer period 
of time and not betrayed them the way everyone in my generation seems 
to have done?'' An underlying question, he said, is ``What has happened 
to us in this excess of acquisition that seems to be a characteristic 
of the productive middle class? Everyone who can afford it has the 
second house and the fancy car and the boat, if possible, and maybe 
not all those things but one of them. And again, is that where happiness 
lies? And if you believed it lay elsewhere, could you actually enjoy 
that happiness and in particular, could you raise a child outside 
the frame of McDonald's and the Gap and Nike?'' So, then, is Kramer 
_ married, with three children and having just turned 50 _ really 
a subversive at heart? Not quite: ``I'm someone who enjoys all the 
pleasures of ordinary life at the mall, but wonders about it,'' he 
said. That wondering comes in part from his formative undergraduate 
years at Harvard during the student unrest of the late 1960s (though, 
joked Blum, who knew him then, Kramer was not a radical leader because 
that would not have allowed his usual thoughtful back-and-forth). 
Then came a scholarship to University College in London, where he 
was exposed to a potent mix of cutting-edge literary theory, art history 
and cultural criticism while being psychoanalyzed to boot. Among the 
fruits was a model he adapted from a Roland Barthe essay on tag-team 
wrestling as a phenomenon that shed light on society. ``This was the 
method, many years later, of `Listening to Prozac,' '' he said. ``Which 
was, take this little product in the culture and look at it from lots 
of angles, and hope that just by being very focused on that one product 
of the culture or object we use in the culture, it would say something 
broader without having to belabor the subject, but just resonate in 
some way.'' In that vein, when Kramer looks at relationships in ``Should 
You Leave?,'' he examines them for their own value but also as a reflection 
of what is going on in American society at large: ``How the culture 
decides what happiness is, and whether your wife is an adequate commodity 
for you _ the trophy wife _ and so on. Your status in the workplace 
very much determines your status at home. Intimate life has been invaded 
by materialism.'' His approach has not pleased everyone. ``Listening 
to Prozac'' drew criticism in reviews that he had allowed himself 
to be seduced by the drug's promise, like many doctors with many past 
``miracle drugs,'' and that its gloss would fade with time and more 
information. Other critics complained that he played down problematic 
side effects experienced by 10 to 20 percent of Prozac users _ edginess, 
drowsiness, headaches, sexual problems and more. Still others, like 
Glen Gabbard, a professor at the Menninger Clinic and the author of 
``Psychodynamic Psychiatry in Clinical Practice'' (1994, American 
Psychiatric Press), questioned his suggestion that drugs like Prozac 
alone could transform not only a patient's mood but also his personality. 
``I would conceptualize medication as toning down anger and other 
negative emotions so that psychotherapy can be more effective,'' Gabbard 
said. ``My experience with many patients who have personality disorders 
is that medication alone does not make substantial changes in their 
personality; what does work is the combination of medication and psychotherapy.'' 
Kramer said that his success may also have raised some hackles because 
psychiatric fame has come to him as a writer. Traditionally laurels 
have gone to the great researchers or administrators. Ultimately, 
said Dr. Paul McHugh, chairman of the Johns Hopkins department of 
psychiatry, Kramer will probably be remembered as a psychotherapist 
who pinpointed a major shift in psychiatry through his own painstaking 
observation. ``To have a psychotherapist make this point, rather than 
somebody who's been making his whole livelihood talking about medications, 
I suppose that galls some people,'' McHugh said. ``That the guy who 
captures a new time is a person who's listened to his patients, not 
simply been seeing them for five minutes and giving them a pill.''
