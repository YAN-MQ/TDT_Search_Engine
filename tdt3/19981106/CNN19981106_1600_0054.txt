The fallout from the midterm election continues within the republican 
party. Louisiana congressman Bob Livingston announced today he will 
challenge Newt gingrich for the job of house speaker later this month 
in the GOP leadership election. Livingston referred to Gingrich as 
a "dear friend," but said house republicans had gotten lost in "A 
haze of high rhetoric and miscast priorities." Tuesday, republicans 
lost six seats in the house and made no gains in the senate. Livingston 
says the American people want lawmakers with good ideas, not good 
speeches. I do so because I believe that we're at a crossroads, a 
crossroads for our party, a crossroads for the House of Representatives, 
a crossroads for the country, and a crossroads where we must choose 
between inspirational speeches and perspiration-filled achievement.
