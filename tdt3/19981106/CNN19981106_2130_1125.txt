"CNN Headline Sports" is next. And later -- from "bridges to Babylon" 
to "no security," the rolling stones soldier on. Hi, I'm expecting 
a fax. Room 212 wants the ammunition to deal with her toughest clients. 
Nothing? Davies, 212. I called earlier. Right, fax. It hasn't come 
yet. I need it for a meeting. Excuse me, miss Davies? It just came 
in. Thank you, so much. Good morning, everyone. Business services 
by Marriott. Introducing the all-new Jeep grand Cherokee. While it 
boasts a new vibration-reducing body structure, a quieter, more powerful 
engine, and an agile suspension for a superior level of refinement 
and quietness. Rest assured, it's still as rugged as ever. Welcome 
back, sir. The all-new Jeep grand Cherokee.
