Britain's House of Lords will resume debate today over whether former 
Chilean dictator Augusto Pinochet should be sent to Spain to face 
genocide charges. For two days, prosecutors have appealed a lower 
court decision that General Pinochet's arrest in London last month 
was illegal. The lower court ruled the 82-year-old former head of 
state has diplomatic immunity, and critics say he should be held accountable 
for brutal crimes against humanity allegedly committed during his 
17-year regime.
