On a nippy November afternoon, when he would ordinarily be leaping 
toward the net of a basketball rim trying to imitate the aerodynamic 
glide of his hero, Michael Jordan, 11-year-old Jonathan Figueroa grimaced 
at the mention of basketball. Instead, the once aspiring point guard 
was transforming the Goat Courts at 99th Street and Amsterdam Avenue 
_ one of New York City's most hallowed hoops grounds _ into an asphalt 
baseball field. And with repeated swings of his wooden bat, he tried 
to forget ever having loved Jordan or professional basketball, which 
he says is so ``messed up''in a labor dispute that fans like him have 
been pushed to the sidelines. ``Basketball is dead,'' Jonathan declared, 
continuing to swipe the air with his bat. ``The players only really 
care about getting a lot of money. I don't care if it ever comes back. 
It's all about baseball now.'' By the calendar at least, basketball 
loyalists like Jonathan should be tethered to their televisions, trying 
to glimpse the latest moves, newest phenoms and hottest highlights 
of the National Basketball Association. But this season, a high-stakes 
labor battle between the NBA's more than 400 players and 29 team owners 
has already canceled 194 games in November and is threatening to call 
off the entire schedule. The two sides are at odds over how best to 
split up basketball's billion-dollar revenue base. The players want 
60 percent; the owners are offering 50. On the basketball courts and 
public playgrounds of New York City, which have launched legions of 
basketball dreamers _ and more than a few NBA stars _ hard-core fans 
of all ages are directing sharp words at both the players and the 
owners. While almost no one is well-versed or even particularly interested 
in the details of the day-to-day negotiations, many fans say they 
have heard enough to know this much: Basketball is disintegrating 
into a game of greed. As in many urban areas across the country, basketball 
has long been more than just a sport in New York. It has also been 
a way for young people in poor, isolated neighborhoods to grasp at 
America's modern pastime: success, and the wealth that comes along 
with it. But as with other such pursuits, it has a heartbreaking trail 
of disappointments _ none better known in New York than that of Earl 
(the Goat) Manigault, for whom the Amsterdam court is named. Manigault 
became a local legend for his ability to defy gravity on the court, 
but a heroin addiction spoiled his chances of pursuing a professional 
career. So perhaps the NBA impasse has a particularly sharp resonance 
on the city's concrete playgrounds, where those who sweat and dream 
of an NBA career and its comforts feel betrayed by the few who have 
made it. Players at the famed West Fourth Street Courts in Manhattan 
recently joked about the predicament of Kenny Anderson, a former point 
guard for the New Jersey Nets. Anderson said recently that he may 
have to sell one of his eight luxury cars now that he is unable to 
collect his $5.8 million salary from his new team, the Boston Celtics. 
Anderson, who also has homes in New York and Los Angeles and a fledgling 
entertainment company, told The New York Times that he spends $75,000 
a year on the upkeep of his cars and is currently losing $76,000 for 
every game that he does not play. ``Its insulting,'' said Stephen 
Breslin, 15, a West Fourth Street regular. ``They can go out and buy 
a whole bunch of cars and apartments and we're supposed to feel bad. 
Get real. Even the ones who make only a couple hundred thousand still 
have it better than most people out here. I don't have no sympathy 
for either side.'' Some basketball devotees have so distanced themselves 
from the NBA's troubles that they had to be reminded that the official 
start of the season came and went this week. Last year, Eddo Smalls, 
16, spent his time and money collecting memorabilia related to his 
role models, Penny Hardaway of the Orlando Magic and Shaquille O'Neal 
of the Los Angeles Lakers. But the two have now been dethroned by 
the likes of ``Big Sexy Kevin Nash'' and ``Stone Cold Steve Austin,'' 
starts from the world of professional wrestling. ``Wrestling is the 
last pure sport,'' Eddo said. They don't have big NBA egos, everything 
they do is for the fans.'' Officials at the NBA say they are painfully 
aware of the damage the lockout is doing to the public perception 
of the game. ``We know the lockout is not doing anything to endear 
us to fans,'' said Brian McIntyre, a spokesman for the league. ``But 
we have an economic system that is not working and if left unaddressed 
would only get worse.'' McIntrye said some teams lost so much money 
during last year's regular season because of player salaries and benefits 
that this year's lockout is actually saving money. Officials for the 
National Basketball Players Association union did not return telephone 
calls to their office. But like the baseball strike of 1994-95 _ when 
fans vowed to turn their back on the game but returned en masse by 
this year _ the grousing over the basketball impasse is most likely 
to be fleeting. Gregory Rose, a 27-year-old NBA fan and amateur player, 
said he is mourning the loss of basketball. ``I'm hurting,'' he said. 
``Right now, I'm supposed to be in front of my TV rooting for the 
Bulls.'' And others like Derek Pilgrim, 31, a friend of Rose's, said 
the team owners were at fault. ``Blaming the players is crazy. Basketball 
is a business now. Players know their careers probably won't last 
10, 20 years like they used to, so they have to look out for themselves 
just like the owners are doing.'' At the Brownsville Recreation Center 
in Brooklyn, all the talk about salaries and sticking points was lost 
on the nearly three dozen children who gather each season in front 
of a 52''colored television to watch NBA games. So far this year, 
the children have had to settle for sitting in the gym and watching 
amateurs mimic the moves of their favorite NBA players. ``I don't 
think it's fair,'' 12-year-old Rykeem Robinson said as he lay sprawled 
out over the gym's bleachers, only half watching a loud, sweaty game 
between six men. ``On TV its better than this. If the players weren't 
selfish, we could be watching a real game.''
