Surgery on a recurring foot injury has forced British athlete Liz 
McColgan to withdraw from next week's Tokyo Marathon. The 1996 London 
Marathon winner sustained a heal injury during her second-place finish 
in the London Marathon in April and has not raced since. The injury 
failed to improve despite extensive physiotherapy, forcing McColgan 
to undergo surgery to remove a cyst from her left toe. She is not 
expected to race for at least two months. The Scottish runner usually 
competes in two marathons each year and had planned to compete in 
the Tokyo event on Nov. 15. She has run in the Tokyo event since 1991 
when she took up racing over the distance.
