In an unprecedented move, the Alameda County, California, board of 
supervisors has declared a state of emergency because of the rapid 
spread of AIDS within its black community. Blacks comprise about 18 
percent of Alameda County's population but account for more than one-third 
of its AIDS cases. While AIDS infection rates are declining nationwide, 
minority neighborhoods have shown a reversed trend. The declaration 
makes Alameda County eligible for millions of dollars in new federal 
funds that will boost AIDS prevention and care campaigns for minorities. 
Alameda County is right across the bay from San Francisco.
