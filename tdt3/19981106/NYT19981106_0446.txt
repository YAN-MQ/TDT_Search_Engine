Advisers to both Paula Jones and the White House said Friday they 
believed it was still possible to agree to a settlement sometime in 
the next few weeks in which she would withdraw her sexual misconduct 
lawsuit against the president. The efforts to end the lawsuit have 
become increasingly confused, as Mrs. Jones' lawyers and various sets 
of her advisers have feuded over strategy. The lawyers who have represented 
her in court called President Clinton's lawyer Thursday morning and 
offered to withdraw the case if Clinton paid her $950,000. Lawyers 
involved in the negotiations said Friday that Robert Bennett, Clinton's 
attorney, did not accept the offer. He also told Mrs. Jones' lawyers 
that under contract law, their new offer meant that the president's 
previous offer of $700,000 was no longer on the table. The intent 
of the White House response, sources in the Clinton camp said, was 
to slow down the negotiations but not to end them. Discussions could 
resume in the next few weeks, they said. Nonetheless, large hurdles 
remain, said lawyers and advisers for both sides, who spoke on the 
condition of anonymity. The White House is deeply wary of any agreement 
with Mrs. Jones that would be connected to a $1 million offer from 
Abe Hirschfeld, a New York real estate developer, perennial political 
candidate and one-time owner of the New York Post who is under indictment 
in Manhattan for tax fraud. It remains unclear whether Thursday's 
$950,000 offer was part of a deal that would have included Hirschfeld's 
money. Mrs. Jones has hoped to fashion a large settlement package 
by adding whatever she is able to get from Clinton to Hirschfeld's 
$1 million. The lawyers from Dallas and Charlottesville, Va., who 
have represented Mrs. Jones in court have said that they plan to withdraw 
soon from the case. Susan Carpenter McMillan, a California woman who 
has befriended Mrs. Jones and has served as an adviser, said Thursday 
she believed it was improper of Mrs. Jones' lawyers to attempt to 
negotiate with Clinton if they were planning to withdraw from the 
case. Asked who should represent Mrs. Jones in discussions with the 
White House, Ms. McMillan replied: ``Bill McMillan,'' her husband, 
an attorney who has also been advising Mrs. Jones.
