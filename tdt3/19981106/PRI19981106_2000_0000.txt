This is THE WORLD, a co-production of the BBC World Service, PRI, 
and WGBH Boston. It's Friday, November 6th. Hello, I'm Lisa Mullins 
in Boston. Today, a bombing in Jerusalem pushes Israel and the Palestinians 
further apart. We hear how both sides view the attack and its impact 
on the peace process. Also, we learn how a primitive tribe in India 
is threatened with extinction by home cooking. And we hear some musical 
advice for European bureaucrats. You wrote something long that is 
wrong, it will not do. Keep it plain and short and the message will 
get through. First though, this news. From National Public Radio News 
in Washington, I'm Corey Flintoff.
