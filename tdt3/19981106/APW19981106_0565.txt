Sudan's powerful spiritual leader on Friday called on Egyptians to 
migrate in ``millions'' to Sudan to cultivate government farm lands 
left fallow because of scarcity of farmers. Sudan ``invites Egyptians 
to come in millions to make use of millions of acres (hectares) that 
are not cultivated because Sudan is underpopulated,'' Hassan Turabi, 
who is also the Parliament speaker, told a gathering of doctors in 
Khartoum. His comments were broadcast by state television. Turabi 
has extended similar invitations in the past but without results. 
Sudan covers an area of 1 million square miles (2.6 million square 
kilometers), making it Africa's largest country, and its population 
is estimated at 28 million. Egypt's area is 385,229 square miles (1 
million square kilometers), but about 90 percent of its 60 million 
people live on 5 percent of the land along the Nile river. The rest 
is mostly desert. Turabi has long maintained that Egyptians are master 
farmers, reaping the benefit of Nile Valley, the most fertile land 
in the world. He indicated that the Egyptians who take up his offer 
will be allowed to own lands. But he did not specify the areas where 
arable land has been left uncultivated. Egyptian farmers often migrate 
to other countries in search of work but migration of farmers is not 
known. In September, Libyan leader Moammar Gadhafi also said he will 
accept 1 million Egyptians to cultivate land watered by a new gigantic 
irrigation project but it is not known how many went. Turabi's comments 
come as relations between Egypt and Sudan are at a low point over 
Egyptian allegations that Sudan supports Muslim militants seeking 
to topple the Egyptian government. Also Friday, Sudanese President 
Hassan al-Bashir talked on the telephone with Yemeni President President 
Ali Abdullah. Reports say the tiny Gulf state is trying to patch up 
relations between Egypt and Sudan. The official Sudan News Agency 
said al-Bashir and Abdullah discussed ``security and stability in 
the region.''
