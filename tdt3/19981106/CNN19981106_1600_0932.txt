Checking the top stories -- two suicide bombers injured 21 people 
in a Jerusalem market today. It was packed with shoppers when the 
car bomb went off. Israeli police received a phone call claiming the 
Islamic fundamentalist group Hamas is responsible. The blast prompted 
the Israeli cabinet to halt discussions on ratifying the new peace 
accord with Palestinians. They were to vote by Sunday. The Palestinian 
authority is condemning the attack.
