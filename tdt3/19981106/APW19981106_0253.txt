The Philippines is protesting recent actions by China in a disputed 
reef because they could lead to further Chinese encroachments on Philippine 
territory, Defense Secretary Orlando Mercado said Friday. On Thursday, 
the Department of Foreign Affairs summoned the Chinese ambassador 
to protest the presence of Chinese ships off Mischief Reef, which 
is claimed by both countries. The Chinese started renovating platforms 
on the reef last week in violation of a ``code of conduct'' which 
requires both sides to refrain from provocative actions, Mercado said. 
Foreign Undersecretary Leonides Caday conveyed to Ambassador Guan 
Dengming Manila's demand that the ``activities being undertaken by 
the Chinese personnel on the illegal structures ... be immediately 
halted and terminated,'' the foreign office said. Philippine President 
Joseph Estrada said his administration is determined to resolve the 
issue through diplomatic means, and that he hopes it will not fan 
tensions with China. The reef is part of the Spratlys, a chain of 
islands and atolls claimed in part or in whole by China, the Philippines, 
Brunei, Malaysia, Taiwan and Vietnam. ``What we see as the emerging 
strategy of China is `talk and take,' '' Mercado said in a radio interview. 
``There is a code of conduct, the Chinese president even came here 
... but they are doing something else. That is what is worrisome.'' 
Mercado said the Chinese ships were first spotted by air force planes 
Oct. 28. He showed photographs of the Chinese ships off the reef, 
about 215 miles (345 kilometers) from the western Philippine island 
of Palawan. ``If they are allowed to stay there, what will follow 
next? If we measure the 200-mile exclusive economic zone from Mischief 
Reef, even Metro Manila would be included in the EEZ of China,'' he 
added. ``If we do not protest, they would later be in Palawan.'' The 
Chinese Embassy said in a statement that it is China's sovereign right 
to reinforce the structures because they had been damaged by natural 
forces and were endangering the lives of Chinese staff based on the 
reef. It said the reinforcements were being made to the original facility 
``and it serves completely the purpose of peaceful use.'' Mercado, 
however, said that under the agreement, the Chinese should have just 
abandoned the structures. The Philippines protested in 1995 when China 
built concrete platforms on Mischief Reef, one of several areas in 
the Spratlys claimed by both Manila and Beijing. China said the platforms 
were shelters for fishermen but the Manila government said they could 
be used militarily. China's behavior caused suspicion among countries 
in the region that it might be trying to gradually seize the Spratlys, 
which are believed to lie atop vast deposits of oil, minerals and 
natural gas. Mercado said that since the Spratlys straddle vital sea 
lanes and trade routes, any dispute would affect world trade. ``Let 
us abide by the code of conduct, let us not change it,'' he said. 
``Let the sleeping dogs lie, do not disturb them ... if we want peace.''
