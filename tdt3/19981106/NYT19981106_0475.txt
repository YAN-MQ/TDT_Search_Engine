What will slow the rise in executive pay? A bear market would help, 
many experts say, because shareholders would start voting down management 
plans for issuing shares to reward top executives and other employees. 
Even now, votes against such proposals are rising. Generally, experts 
say, the key is for directors to act more like shareholders. Charles 
M. Elson, a Stetson College law professor who serves on three corporate 
boards, argued that director nominees should be required to buy a 
considerable amount of company stock _ say, $100,000 worth _ before 
joining a board and then be compensated with stock for their services. 
Then, Elson said, directors will consider the company's money their 
own and be more likely to resist a chief executive who wants an unreasonably 
large share of it. ``That way, any penny that is overpaid comes out 
of the director's pocket as opposed to some vague force known as the 
company,'' he said. The amounts involved, he acknowledged, may amount 
to no more than pennies a share, but people nevertheless have a keen 
sense of what is rightfully theirs. Elson has seen the process work 
first-hand. When he was appointed a director of the Sunbeam Corp. 
in 1996, he was required to invest $100,000 of his own money to buy 
5,000 shares in the company. Indeed, Elson had advised Albert J. Dunlap, 
then Sunbeam's chief executive, to impose the requirement on all his 
directors. With the additional compensation he received in Sunbeam 
stock in subsequent years, the total value of Elson's holdings rose 
to $250,000. But after the company foundered earlier this year under 
Dunlap's leadership, the value of Elson's holdings fell steeply, to 
less than $50,000 at one point. And it was Elson who, in June, made 
the motion to the Sunbeam board to remove Dunlap. The Sunbeam board 
has been widely reported to be fighting with Dunlap over his severance 
pay. ``Having a large equity stake in a company,'' Elson said, ``really 
wakes you up.''
