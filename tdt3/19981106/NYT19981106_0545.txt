A group of Arab-Americans gathered outside a Times Square movie theater 
Friday night to protest the debut of a new thriller, ``The Siege,'' 
saying that the movie equates Arabs and Islam with terrorism. But 
after the film received tepid reviews this week, other Arab-American 
groups decided to cancel their protests for fear of giving the film 
free publicity. About 30 people stood outside the Criterion Theater, 
on Broadway at 45th Street, waving some placards that criticized the 
movie and others that gave away the ending. Other protesters, from 
the advocacy group New Yorkers For A Just Middle East Peace, tried 
to talk to moviegoers about the film, which opened across the country 
Friday. ``It reinforced negative stereotypes of Arabs and Muslims 
in America,'' said Laura Haddad, an organizer of the protest. The 
film stars Denzel Washington as an FBI agent investigating a series 
of terrorist bombings in New York City. Bruce Willis plays a general 
who is put in charge of the city after martial law is imposed in an 
effort to stop the attacks. Criticism of the film among Arab-Americans 
began while the movie was being filmed in Brooklyn and some details 
of the plot were revealed. The controversy intensified after previews 
appeared in movie theaters last summer. Arab-American groups in other 
parts of the country have been faxing letters to the studios, writing 
to advocacy groups and holding news conferences. The director of the 
film, Edward Zwick, said he intended to make a film about the difficulty 
an Arab-American has dealing with Arab terrorism and American racism. 
One of the film's heroes is an Arab-American FBI agent. The character, 
portrayed by Tony Shaloub, who is of Lebanese descent, is torn when 
the government detains Arab-Americans. ``The movie makes the point 
that it is impossible to generalize about Arab-Americans,'' Zwick 
said in a telephone interview. Some of the moviegoers in Times Square 
on Friday night agreed. Angel Swanson, 20, left the theater and confronted 
Ms. Haddad. ``I saw it as a way of showing people racism about Arabs 
is just as bad as racism against anyone,'' Ms. Swanson said.
