Gingrich's decision came hours after his colleague, Louisiana congressman 
bob Livingston, launched a bid for the speakership. Livingston called 
Gingrich "my dear friend" and praised him as a Revolutionary but he 
said "day-to-day governing" takes other talents. Our ideas have gotten

and miscast priorities, lost in a management style where process is 
subordinated to polls and self-initiated crises.
