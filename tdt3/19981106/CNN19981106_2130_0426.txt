This is meteorologist Valerie Voss with your "CNN Headline News Weather" 
forecast for Saturday. A strong storm will push into the western United 
States bringing some heavy rains to coastal Oregon and northern California 
and snow to the mountains. Meanwhile, another system moves from the 
Rockies into the plains with snow in the forecast through the northern 
plains. Rainshowers or thunderstorms southward into Texas. There could 
be a mix of rain or snow across parts of the Great Lakes but the rest 
of the east will be quiet and a bit on the cool side. Temperatures 
range from 20s and 30s over the northern plains to mostly 50s and 
60s in the south. Looking ahead to Sunday -- look for wet weather 
all the way southward into california. On Monday, that wet weather 
is pushing eastward with heavy snow, rain or thunderstorms across 
the western two-thirds of the country. On Tuesday, still a push eastward 
of showers and storms and snow north. Temperatures range from 30s 
over the northern Rockies to 80s in southern florida. Don't forget 
four-day forecasts for 7200 cities at CNN.com.
