Last week, on the night before his first day as the new designer for 
Yves Saint Laurent's ready-to-wear collection, Alber Elbaz laid out 
his clothes on a chair like a nervous schoolboy. The gesture was purely 
ceremonial. Elbaz usually wears an all-black ensemble so rumpled that 
it might as well have been slept in. But the glamour and prestige 
of his job was unnerving. ``I asked them at Saint Laurent, `Are you 
sure it's not a mistake? You can still change your mind,''' the designer 
said, with characteristic self-doubt. You might call Elbaz, 37, the 
Woody Allen of fashion, so self-deprecating is his humor. ``If someone 
says, `I don't like that dress,' I think she doesn't like me,'' he 
admitted. ``And if she says, `I love that dress,' I think she has 
no taste. So you see, you can't win.'' Clearly, he is of the Groucho 
Marx school of not wanting to belong to any club that would have him 
as a member. But Elbaz is definitely a member of the club these days. 
Along with an elite of American designers _ including Tom Ford at 
Gucci, Michael Kors at Celine, Marc Jacobs at Louis Vuitton and Narciso 
Rodriguez at Loewe _ he has taken over at a grand, but moribund European 
fashion house, and has been charged with bringing it new life. Elbaz 
is the only one among this group to be named by the very designer 
he is succeeding, Saint Laurent. He won the post after successfully 
modernizing the house of Guy Laroche, a venerable French company that 
had been flailing since the early 1990s. ``Guy Laroche was all about 
pink boucle with gold buttons,'' said Elbaz, who took over in 1996. 
``I couldn't go to black leather overnight. So I started with the 
gold buttons and changed the pink to gray and eventually got to black 
leather.'' At Saint Laurent, his preference for evolution over revolution 
is likely to be just as apparent. His personal aesthetic _ beautiful, 
womanly clothes that are above all else, wearable _ is in keeping 
with his legendary predecessor's. ``To have a good dinner, you have 
to have a good wine and fresh tomatoes, a past and a present, which 
will take you into the future,'' said Elbaz, whose imagination often 
runs to poetic metaphor. Many fashion insiders had complained that 
since Saint Laurent's heyday in the '70s, there had been little innovation 
in the ready-to-wear line, with the same safari styles repeated each 
season. ``We understood that we needed to change because the fashion 
business has changed,'' said Pierre Berge, Saint Laurent's business 
partner and president of Yves Saint Laurent couture. ``Alber is American. 
It's not a question of nationality but of training. American training 
is very good. The French are totally haute couture and chichi. Old 
couturiers pretend to be artists. I don't need an artist. I need someone 
who respects women, craftsmanship and thinks about marketing, strategy 
and communication. That is Alber.'' With Saint Laurent now freed to 
concentrate on couture, it is Elbaz's responsibility to turn the house 
into a global enterprise, a skill he developed at Guy Laroche. ``You 
need colors for South America, New York needs black, California pastels 
only,'' he said. ``The South needs short, the North long. Within Europe, 
the German market is looking for one thing, the French another. You 
make a dress with a coat for the society look or a jacket with pants 
for the career look. ``The collection has to be versatile but mixed 
like a cake, not a salad, which is blended in the wrong way,'' he 
said. ``A cake is blended into one taste.'' Born in Morocco, Elbaz 
grew up in Israel, studying fashion design in Tel Aviv before moving 
to New York in 1986 at age 25. Three years later, he was hired as 
an assistant designer for Geoffrey Beene, a position he held for eight 
years. It was Dawn Mello, formerly the executive vice president of 
Gucci and now the president of Bergdorf Goodman, who helped him land 
the job. ``I was looking for a designer for Gucci, and Alber was recommended 
to me,'' she recalled. ``He wouldn't have been right for Gucci, which 
was on the sporty track. He did dressy evening clothes. He has a great 
sense of fantasy and sophistication, and that's why his evening clothes 
are so good. So I called Geoffrey Beene. Alber learned a lot from 
Geoffrey. His work became very refined, but he always had his own 
style.'' That style is deceptively simple. Without elaborate embellishments 
or silhouettes, Elbaz relies on classic shapes, a few feminine flourishes 
like beading and ribbons, and flattering colors to achieve a look 
that he describes as ``very French _ coquette and chic.'' From his 
mentor, Beene, Elbaz learned how to update styles through daring, 
complicated construction, placing sharp darts and seams in unconventional 
places _ across the chest and lower back, for instance. ``The client 
whom I have in mind wants something beautiful and comfortable,'' Elbaz 
said. ``For evening, the clothes are glamorous but never extravagant. 
When a woman walks into a room, no one will faint, but she will be 
noticed.'' Nicolas Jurnjack, a hairdresser who has worked with Elbaz 
on his last three shows at Guy Laroche, said the designer was never 
directly influenced by past styles or what is trendy. ``He never talks 
about the '60s, the '20s, or makes reference to a magazine,'' Jurnjack 
said. ``Alber is the first designer I've met who never asks me what 
was in the shows in London or Milan, which come before Paris. If I 
make a comparison to someone else, it's already too close, and he 
throws it out. His references come from the street, and they're always 
very social.'' Standing apart from other designers, Elbaz displays 
little interest in fame or stardom. ``It's so '80s,'' he said dismissively. 
He lives in the Bastille, an unpretentious section of Paris, where 
he rents a sparsely furnished apartment. He takes a subway, bus or 
cab to get around. ``I never walk, I don't like to walk, I'm Jewish,'' 
he said, with a laugh. ``Alber is an example of someone getting ahead 
on the basis of his portfolio and talent,'' said Amy Fine Collins, 
a special correspondent at Vanity Fair, who frequently writes about 
fashion. ``There was no PR blitz. From the beginning, he was fascinated 
with a new way to cut cloth and stitch a seam. Those things obsess 
him. These are things in the bright flash of a camera or splashy video 
you can't see. Today, what matters in fashion is what looks splashy. 
It's about superficial effects and not anatomy. Alber gets anatomy. 
Let's just say, he's the real thing. He's not interested in being 
a celebrity or walker for socialites.'' When not working, Elbaz loves 
to eat, food being a passion and frequent topic of conversation, his 
weight a preoccupation. ``I eat a lot when I'm tense or relaxed,'' 
he said. ``I am always tense or relaxed, so there you go. I say I'm 
allergic to sand because I won't wear a bathing suit. But it's because 
I'm fat.'' As a people person with a gentle, upbeat personality, it 
is not surprising that Elbaz was an official social planner for the 
troops while serving in the Israeli army. For three years, he planned 
parties, organized visits to a local nursing home and taught soldiers 
about culture, geography and music. It was also in the army that Elbaz 
came to appreciate loyalty. ``In the army, you know someone is behind 
you,'' he said. ``You depend on him. Fashion is a business, but not 
a Swiss watch business. It's very personal. As a designer, sometimes 
they like you, and other times they throw you to the dogs. Loyalty 
impresses me.'' Elbaz's Israeli background also helps to explain his 
down-to-earth attitude toward fashion and his sense of priorities. 
``There's so much going on there, so much beyond fashion,'' he said, 
referring to the daily political crises in Israel. ``You take everything 
in proportion. You see different perspectives. Let's say you get a 
midnight-blue fabric when really what you wanted was navy. You make 
it work. You do the best you can.'' A frequently recounted example 
of Elbaz's ability to turn an accident into an advantage occurred 
during his first show at Guy Laroche. As the models strutted down 
the runway in rhinestone-studded sandals, the jewels started popping 
off, scattering across the floor. Once the straps had broken, the 
models kicked off their shoes, continuing the show barefoot. ``At 
the end of the show, there was dead silence,'' Ms. Mello remembered. 
``Then, out of the back, burst this little man with hair that looked 
like he stuck his finger in an electric socket. He danced and jumped 
down the runway. No one had ever seen anything like that. People started 
to laugh and they stood up and started applauding, and he got the 
best reviews.'' Recalling the mishap, which to another designer might 
have signaled disaster, Elbaz responded lightheartedly. ``People thought 
we planned it,'' he said. ``It was so good. I laughed about it. This 
is part of life. It gave a human touch to that first show. The whole 
thing was like a big happening.''
