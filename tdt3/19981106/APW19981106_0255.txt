Wrapping up a week that saw Taiwanese stocks fall 5 percent, officials 
vowed Friday to catch and jail speculators alleged to have capitalized 
on the economic slump by spreading rumors that hurt share prices. 
Lin Tsong-yung, head of the Securities and Exchange Commission, said 
authorities will investigate traders believed to have helped the speculators 
by filling the market with damaging rumors. Chen Yao-hao, head of 
the Tuntex textile and chemicals group, said Friday a ``black hand'' 
had emerged in the stock market. ``They spread rumors everyday about 
companies bouncing checks,'' Chen told a news conference. ``We must 
address this issue or it could lead to economic turmoil.'' Tuntex's 
shares tumbled Wednesday and Thursday on rumors that the group had 
bounced checks, but Chen insisted his company remains financially 
sound. Tuntex plans to halt some overseas investment plans, while 
suspending further real estate buys, but only because of Asia's economic 
troubles. The China Times Express reported that a group of speculators, 
claiming themselves as ``Taiwan's Soros,'' a reference to American 
financier George Soros, has raised a fund of at least 100 billion 
Taiwan dollars (U.S. dlrs 3 billion) to sell shares on the market 
in hopes that prices would fall. Hit by Asia's financial crisis, Taiwan's 
economy has slowed and domestic consumption fallen. Several business 
groups faced financial difficulties as they struggled to pay off debts 
that they ran up when times were better. Another conglomerate, Chunghsin 
Textiles, saw its share price plunge and ended up Thursday denying 
rumors that it had bounced checks. Blue chips on the Taiwan Stock 
Exchange fell slightly on Friday to close at 6,889.65 points, shedding 
a total of 5.2 percent for the week.
