You cannot separate the man from his words. Coach Bill Parcells has 
given his midseason soliloquy to the New York Jets. He laid out for 
them how this pennant race is going to unfold, and then Friday he 
put them in pads, a rarity for a Friday. But why not? This is a big 
deal _ on Sunday the Jets are fighting to stay in first place against 
the Buffalo Bills as they start the second half of the campaign. And 
good teams, Parcells has said in his little green-and-white book, 
``put together winning streaks.'' The Jets have produced three straight 
victories. If they win Sunday at Giants Stadium, they will become 
only the second Jets team since the 1986 season to win four straight 
games. Parcells' theory is that without winning streaks, teams never 
go beyond the ordinary by season's end. The Bills have won five straight. 
Each team has done it with quarterbacks who last made it on the national 
stage during the 1980s. From western New York, where Flutie Flakes 
are flying off the shelves, all the way to the South Shore of Long 
Island, where they once held a parade for Vinny Testaverde, the teams 
and their fans have been energized with the kind of excitement that 
only playoff dreams can produce. Buffalo has been playing in these 
kinds of big games for years. But the Jets are still learning about 
themselves. Even Friday, Parcells said he did not know how they would 
react, but he believed they were listening. Will he mention to them 
the fact that they have lost six straight to the Bills and are 3-13 
against Buffalo in the 1990s? ``No,'' he said. ``It's not 1994. You 
know why Buffalo had the streak. They were the best team. I think 
it's irrelevant now, a different set of circumstances.'' Yet, Parcells 
has often evoked Jets history to rid his players of the burden. He 
has warned them of past collapses after halftime, or their inability 
to win on the road, or their failure to hold leads, or their mediocre 
home record. This is what Parcells has been telling them about themselves, 
and about what they need to do: _ In training camp, the T-shirts he 
distributed to everyone read, ``Take Another Step.'' (Last year's 
read, ``Who Says We Can't?'') _ A sign on a wall reads, ``Great Players 
Inspire Others.'' _ On their way into the locker room, the players 
see signs that read, ``Prove you can win on the road,'' and ``Smart 
players very seldom do dumb things.'' ``I was telling the team yesterday 
that all the clubs in this division have weaknesses,'' Parcells said 
Friday after calling recent practices ``pretty good.'' ``But the problem 
is each team presents a unique problem; this guy,'' he said, referring 
to Bills quarterback Doug Flutie, ``is someone different. It's kind 
of out of the mainstream.'' Parcells still does not know how much 
resiliency the Jets have week to week. He wonders how much they will 
carry over what they have learned during recent victories over New 
England, Atlanta and Kansas City. He has told the team that almost 
everybody in pro football has been zeroing in on the four teams tied 
for the American Football Conference East lead _ the Jets and Bills 
share 5-3 records with Miami and New England _ but that most people 
don't even mention the Colts, who are 1-7. ``The fifth team,'' Parcells 
suggested, ``could be the one to decide this division.'' That fifth 
team has Peyton Manning, who has improved significantly from his first 
tentative days as a professional quarterback. The Colts have a second 
game left against the Jets, the Bills and the Dolphins. ``I tell the 
players exactly what's going to happen to all four teams,'' Parcells 
said. And what would that be? ``I'd rather not say publicly,'' he 
said. But why tell them now? ``To get their minds focused,'' Parcells 
said. ``This team we're playing this week could be the team to beat.'' 
Friday, the Jets' Bryan Cox reflected on streaks. ``Both winning and 
losing is contagious,'' said the veteran linebacker, who has been 
with the Jets only since last summer. ``When you start to win it makes 
the team believe it's something it can do every week. And when you 
lose a lot you start to accept it. Winning and losing have the same 
result on your mind.'' Left guard Todd Burger said: ``Looking at the 
standing is a matter of common sense. I've heard it said that winning 
breeds confidence, and we're a confident team right now. But I'm a 
lot more realistic than a lot of the mugs in this room. When you want 
to keep winning, you can't take anything for granted, you can't think 
that just because you're rolling, it continues by itself.'' Meanwhile, 
this was an upbeat day for Parcells at his news conference. Most Fridays 
are when he thinks the team is ``behaving'' _ one of his favorite 
words _ in the right way. He was alternately philosophical and humorous. 
Perhaps he senses something. EXTRA POINTS _ As expected, LEON JOHNSON 
will be sidelined as the third-down back and punt returner because 
of a sprained knee. DEDRIC WARD will return punts and RICHIE ANDERSON 
and JERALD SOWELL may spell CURTIS MARTIN on short yardage or third 
downs. Players have been told not to discuss their injuries with the 
news media, so Johnson asked the reporters he did not know to write 
down their names for him. ``Then I'll check out the stories to see 
if they're true,'' he said. _ The three-game winning streak has helped 
the Jets lower their points-against average to 17.3 a game. If the 
rate continues, it will be the third-best figure in team history. 
_ The game on CBS is the first National Football League broadcast 
of high-definition television (HDTV). Because it will require two 
separate crews, and it also is broadcast over regular television, 
175 CBS workers will be swarming in, out and around the Meadowlands.
