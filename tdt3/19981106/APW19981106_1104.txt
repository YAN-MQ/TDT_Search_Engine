A top U.N. expert on torture has been invited for a ten-day fact finding 
visit to Turkey, which has long been accused of abusing prisoners 
and Kurdish sympathizers. Special investigator Nigel Rodley plans 
to meet Turkish government officials, non-governmental organizations 
and private individuals during his trip there Nov. 9-19, a U.N. statement 
said Friday. He also hopes to visit prisons and other detention centers 
in Ankara, Istanbul and the southeastern province of Diyarbakir _ 
one of the bases of Kurdish rebels seeking autonomy from Turkey. Rodley, 
a British law professor, will present his findings to the U.N. Commission 
on Human Rights at its annual session next March. Human rights organizations 
like Amnesty International maintain that torture is rife in Turkish 
prisons, which house some 9,000 prisoners linked to leftist or Kurdish 
groups. The government is also frequently criticized for its violent 
suppression of the Kurdish separatist movement. Rodley has previously 
made visits to Russia, Rwanda, Colombia, Chile, Pakistan and Mexico.
