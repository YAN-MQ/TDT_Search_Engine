AMMAN, Jordan (AP) _ U.S. Defense Secretary William Cohen ended his 
tour of Arab nations Friday with little sign of support for military 
strikes on Iraq after it ended all links with U.N. weapons inspectors. 
Cohen left for Turkey after talks with Jordan's Crown Prince Hassan 
that began later Thursday and ended in the early hours of Friday. 
Cohen did not speak with reporters but Hassan's comments indicated 
that Jordan was not keen on a military strike. It ``is imperative 
to find a way out of the current crisis and to find the appropriate 
conditions to resume cooperation between the United Nations and Iraq,'' 
Hassan said. He then added: ``It is important to avert in the region 
another confrontation and to settle the crisis diplomatically.'' Similar 
public statements have been made by officials in some of the other 
countries Cohen visited _ Saudi Arabia, Kuwait, Bahrain, Qatar, Oman, 
the United Arab Emirates and Egypt. However, in a statement Thursday, 
Cohen's spokesman Kenneth Bacon said the meetings were ``successful'' 
and that the secretary ``is confident that the United States will 
have the support it needs to take appropriate action to uphold the 
United Nations Security Council resolutions.'' Meanwhile, the government 
of Saddam Hussein remained defiant, even after a resolution of condemnation 
by the Security Council Thursday. Iraq demands a timetable for the 
lifting of U.N. economic sanctions before cooperation can resume. 
During a standoff between Iraq and the U.N. in February, Kuwait was 
the only Arab state that opened its air bases to U.S. and British 
warplanes. The United States has some 24,000 troops, an aircraft carrier 
and some 170 warplanes and helicopters in the Gulf region, according 
to the Pentagon. Iraq's worsening plights under the sanctions has 
earned it widespread sympathy in the region. But the sanctions cannot 
be lifted until the weapons inspectors certify Iraq is rid of all 
weapons of mass destruction.
