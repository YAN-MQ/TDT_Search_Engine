Superstar cricket player Brian Lara has been fired from the West Indies 
team, provoking the worst crisis in West Indian cricket in 20 years. 
Lara and teammate Carl Hooper were kicked off of the team by the West 
Indies Cricket Board late Wednesday after they failed to attend an 
emergency meeting in Antigua. The players were unhappy with playing 
fees and other conditions for a five-test tour which starts next Tuesday 
and ends in February. Lara and Hooper flew to London to protest their 
pay. Seven other players who also flew to London were fined and ordered 
to immediately join the rest the team in South Africa. The dispute 
threatens to disrupt the West Indies cricket team's first official 
South African test tour. The South African president, Nelson Mandela, 
is among the people involved in negotiations to salvage the tour. 
The firings have triggered floods of angry telephone calls to radio 
stations in Barbados, where cricket fans are calling for the board 
to immediately reinstate the players.
