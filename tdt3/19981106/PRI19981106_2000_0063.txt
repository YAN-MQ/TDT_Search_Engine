Republican leader Newt Gingrich is stepping down as Speaker of the 
House. Gingrich led Republicans to majority status in 1994 for the 
first time in 40 years. But today, a powerful committee chairman challenged 
him for the speakership. NPR's Peter Overby reports. In a written 
statement, Gingrich called it a difficult personal decision. He said 
he believes he still has a significant role to play nationally and 
in the GOP, and he promised to do all he can do help Republicans win 
in 2000. It's unlikely he'll finish his House term. Gingrich was the 
toast of Washington after the '94 Republican upset, but this week, 
after the GOP lost House seats in two consecutive elections, he was 
under increasing pressure to step down. This afternoon, Appropriations 
Committee Chairman Bob Livingston, an old friend of Gingrich, announced 
he was running for speaker. Livingston praised Gingrich's skills as 
a revolutionary but said the House needs better legislative leadership. 
Other Republicans may enter the race for speaker, and today Congressman 
Steve Largent announced he's challenging Majority Leader Dick Armey.
