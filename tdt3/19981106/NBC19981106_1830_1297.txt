Back in this country, a prestigious hospital in New York has been 
slapped with a big fine for Gross violations of medical standards. 
And this happens more often than you may want to think. Here's NBC's 
Jim Avila tonight. New York's Beth Israel medical center, one of the 
country's best, now hit with one of the largest fines against a hospital 
in state history -- $30,000. The charge -- during routine outpatient 
surgery, doctors watch as a medical supply salesman demonstrates a 
new machine, actually participating in the procedure on a live patient. 
The unidentified, 30-year-old woman, injected with more than two gallons 
of saline dies on the table. Given that much fluid, she couldn't breathe. 
The patient basically drowned. a Gross medical error, but not rare 
enough. A Harvard study says 120,000 Americans are killed each year, 
victims of a Million medical mistakes. In its journal this week, the 
ama says the current system for investigating medical errors does 
not work. Doctors are not perfect. They must admit errors so patterns 
can be detected and mistakes prevented. I think the culture is still 
a culture of blame. I think that people are still expected to be error-free. 
And we know that none of us are error-free. But under the current 
system, doctors who make mistakes face discipline and lawsuits -- 
incentives to hide trouble. The ama says medical boards should promote 
blame-free reporting, like the aviation industry. We want near misses 
reported in medicine, too, so we can look at the cause and then look 
at the solution. The model -- Massachusetts, where state officials 
force hospitals to report mistakes, but keep the names of the doctors 
involved secret. We want to know what happened medically, and why 
it happened, what you did to find out what went wrong. And what you 
are doing to make sure it never happens again. a major problem -- 
the wrong medicine -- at Boston's brigham and women's hospital where 
6 out of every 100 patients got the wrong medicine in a 1995 survey. 
Fixing the system has dramatically cut the number of errors. A warning 
comes up letting me know that this patient has an allergy to penicillin. 
The new system forces doctors to order medicine by computer. This 
system has decreased the frequency of serious medication errors by 
55%. Part of a new approach leaders in the medical community say would 
lead to less blame and fewer deadly mistakes. Jim Avila, NBC news,
