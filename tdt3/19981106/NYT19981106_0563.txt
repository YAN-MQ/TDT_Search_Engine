Paced by Eric Hasbrouck's faultless ride aboard Miss Fio in the second 
round, the U.S. Equestrian Team won the Samsung Nations' Cup international 
jumping competition Friday night at the National Horse Show at Madison 
Square Garden. The host team's score of 32 faults sent the trophy 
back to the USET's trophy case for the third year in a row. Scoring 
the best three rounds put in by each team's four horse and rider combinations 
in each of two rounds, Canada led after the first session with 18 
1/4 faults. The USET's Alison Firestone, riding Major, and Hasbrouck 
each had four faults. Leslie Burr-Howard collected 16 astride After 
Eight, giving the squad 24 penalties. After Firestone and Major scored 
four faults in the second phase, Hasbrouck, riding in his seventh 
Nations' Cup, moved the Americans into contention with a clear round 
within the time allowed of 79 seconds. After Burr-Howard and After 
Eight jumped all the fences but the next-to-last one without a knockdown, 
the U.S lead was wide enough to allow the fourth rider, Margie Goldstein-Engle, 
aboard Hidden Creek's Alvaretto, to withdraw. Canada's best performance 
was put in by Tani Tops-Zeidler, aboard Starvos, scoring zero jumping 
faults and one time fault in the first round. Sixteen faults charged 
to Sarah Watt and her mount, Arabian, in the second round, coupled 
with 28 from Frankie Chesler, riding Ravenna Z, caused the Canadians 
to settle for second with 68 faults.
