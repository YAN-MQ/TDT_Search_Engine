People who use the street drug ecstasy often say it makes them more 
sensually aware, less inhibited and less anxious. But scientists say 
they now have evidence it may lead to brain damage. Researchers at 
Johns Hopkins University took brain scans of 14 men and women who, 
on average, had taken the illegal drug 200 times or more. They compared 
the results with the scans of people who had never used the drug and 
found ecstasy may affect nerves that release serotonin in the brain. 
Ecstasy is popular with students and other young adults, and researchers 
say many users are unaware of the dangers. The thousands of kids using 
the drug are not getting any clear indication or warning signal that 
they'ring with a highly toxic drug of abuse. Users may not experience 
Negative effects immediately, but scientists speculate that, in the 
long term, ecstasy use could trigger neuropsychiatric disorders, including 
anxiety and depression. For the latest health news online, check out
