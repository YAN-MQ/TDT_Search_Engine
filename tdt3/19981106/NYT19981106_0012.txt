When the space shuttle Discovery touches down Saturday, the tallest 
astronaut, Scott Parazynski, a strapping, 6-foot-1-inch blond who 
looks like an actor and is a doctor, will have completed his third 
mission in space. But for all his achievements, Parazynski will land 
with his greatest dream still unfulfilled: to be a U.S. Olympic luger. 
Those who have followed John Glenn's latest space odyssey have heard 
of Parazynski, the mission specialist and the doctor responsible for 
drawing most of Glenn's blood samples during Discovery's nine-day 
orbit of Earth. But few people know that before earning his Stanford 
medical degree, before his first launch, before his spacewalk outside 
the Russian space station Mir, he discovered luge. ``One of the greatest 
adventures of my life,'' Parazynski has called it. He said his introduction 
to the sport was ``a total fluke,'' but it was more like the natural 
course of events: In the mid-'80s if you lived anywhere near Stanford, 
Bonny Warner, a member of the 1984 Olympic luge team, was there recruiting 
ambitiously for her sport. Warner, then a Stanford student, conducted 
one-day summer clinics hoping to woo college-age athletes to the sport's 
Olympic effort. ``Bonny had these crude training sleds with shopping-cart 
wheels,'' said Jason Curliano, then a collegiate cyclist. ``She'd 
take all of us up a hill behind Stanford and, with helmets on, let 
us try out the pylon course.'' So, Parazynski spent his 24th birthday 
in 1985 with 75 strangers _ including Curliano _ dodging cones on 
a black road under the summer sun and falling in love with the supine 
slalom. At the time, Parazynski was an M.D./Ph.D. candidate in cancer 
biology at Stanford; on that day he became _ and remains _ a self-described 
``luge junkie.'' Warner did not know in 1985 that Parazynski intended 
to be an astronaut, a doctor and an Olympian. When she found out, 
``I laughed to myself,'' she said recently. ``He honestly thought 
he could do it. I remember thinking, `How dare you think you could 
do all three?''' Still, she selected him to represent the Western 
States Luge Club and train in Lake Placid, N.Y., that winter. Curliano 
was also chosen, and he and Parazynski became roommates at the Olympic 
Training Center. They would share practice sessions from 7 p.m. to 
10 p.m. in the icy trough at the bottom of the course. ``Every night, 
Scott and I were out there in the dark, freezing on our sleds,'' Curliano 
recalled, ``but we decided to stay the whole season, thinking the 
more the coaches see us, the more likely we'd be picked for the team.'' 
It was too risky for novices to start at the top of the course. As 
they improved, they started their runs higher. ``Our first goal was 
to make it up to the women's start house _ which was heated,'' Curliano 
said. ``Goal 2 was the men's start house _ the next warm building.'' 
But what lurked in the 200 yards between the start houses made the 
men's track ``the most difficult course in the world at the time,'' 
said Dmitri Feld, a former U.S. team coach. ``At Curve 3, instead 
of looking forward, you were looking into the eyes of God.'' By 1987 
_ within a year of the Winter Games in Calgary _ Parazynski was so 
determined to earn an Olympic berth that he was not only entering 
singles races on the treacherous Lake Placid course, but he was also 
attempting doubles. In the final 1987 national doubles championship 
heat, Parazynski ``found his destiny,'' as Feld put it. Coming out 
of the omega-shaped Turn 11, the rider on top, Parazynski, became 
the bottom. ``For one eternal moment we stared straight down at solid 
ice four feet below while strapped onto a speeding bullet,'' he wrote 
that year in the Stanford alumni magazine. ``Somehow we managed to 
land on our side and keep going, actually finishing the race. We were 
greeted with a tumultuous standing ovation when we regained `full, 
upright and locked' position.'' Parazynski never made the Olympic 
cut, however. He finished ninth in the men's singles at the 1988 U.S. 
trials; only the top three in each event competed in Calgary. At 26, 
his dream of participating in the Olympics seemed over. However, Parazynski 
did get to Calgary. He was the coach of another Camp Warner veteran, 
Raymond Ocampo, whose dual U.S.-Philippines citizenship allowed him 
into the Olympic luge, where he finished 35th out of 36. At 37, Parazynski 
has gone on to become the astronaut and doctor he said he would be. 
He did not become an Olympian, but he will never forget his adventures 
on ice. He takes U.S. luge team shirts and patches to space and back. 
He invites his former teammates to launches. And after the 1998 Winter 
Games in Nagano, Japan, he congratulated the U.S. team on bringing 
home a silver and a bronze _ America's first Olympic luge medals. 
Sometimes, the dream unfulfilled is the one that remains in the heart.
