A combined British-Irish women's golf team on Friday pulled out of 
next week's World Amateur Golf Team Championship in Chile over concerns 
for player safety. The move came as Britain's highest court was to 
resume hearings Monday to decide on the legality of the arrest in 
London of former Chilean dictator Gen. Augusto Pinochet. The tournament 
involving three dozen teams is set for Nov. 12-15 is Santiago, the 
Chilean capital. Jill Edwards, the chairman of the Ladies' Golf Union, 
said she had followed the advice of Britain's Foreign and Commonwealth 
Office and the union's legal advisers. `` We are extremely disappointed 
that we have had to take this course of action,'' she said. ``But 
given the recent developments both in Chile and in our own courts 
we have decided to withdraw the GB and I team from the championship.'' 
The combined Britain and Ireland team members were Rebecca Hudson, 
Becky Morgan, Kim Andrew and captain Claire Dowling. The men's event 
is set for Nov. 19-22 in Santiago, giving the Royal and Ancient Club 
an extra week to decide on the trip. Men's team members are Gary Wolstenholme, 
Luke Donald, Lorne Kelly and Paddy Gribben.
