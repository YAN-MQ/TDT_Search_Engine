We're going to take "A closer look" at the fashion industry. This 
has been fashion week in New York. In many ways, the most important 
week of the year in the United States designers. Get attention and 
approval here from the nation's professional buyers, and you have 
a very good start on a successful season. There is always excitement, 
a new designer may take off. A star may fall. Here is ABC's Debra 
Amos. There's still glamour -- and theater -- sometimes even art. 
But this year's runway is different. You can be the most admired designer 
by the press, but if you don't sell everything, what happens? You're 
out of business. And in the last month, a half dozen big names are 
in trouble. Including kenar and Anne Klein. Designer Issac Mizrahi 
is out of business. The $85 billion a year fashion industry is in 
a slump, with only a 12% rise in sales in the last five years. So 
why would designers still stage $500,000 spectacles with clothes that 
most consumers can't afford and wouldn't wear? There's drama from 
the standpoint, you know, that the designers future depends on how 
people respond to those shows. And how they respond to their names, 
no designer makes a profit from these clothes, it's the sizzle of 
high fashion that creates a saleable brand. Successful designers have 
learned that profits are made on the first floor of department stores. 
The fashion business is not just the fashion business anymore. It's 
the sunglass business. It's the perfume business. It's the jeans business. 
It's the home furnishing business. Here at these counters, customers 
can afford to buy a little piece of well-known designers. And that 
can mean huge profits. Calvin Klein cleared $40 million last year 
on his perfume alone. And that's exactly what all the biggest players 
have done, building fashion empires with their low-priced spinoffs, 
a move that investors have rewarded, but it's come at a price, creativity. 
For example, Todd Oldham stopped designing his outrageous clothes 
that sold at even more outrageous prices. He now sells low-priced 
jeans. I don't know if this industry is set up for great creativity 
anymore. It's available for great there merchandising, and marketing 
know its techniques, and are masters at that. But I don't -- the same 
industry that it was a few years ago. An industry that still pays 
attention to fashion critics. But it's the reviews on Wall Street 
that count now. Deborah Amos, ABC News, New York.
