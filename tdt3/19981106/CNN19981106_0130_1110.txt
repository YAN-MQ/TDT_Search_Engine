The fed ex pilots association is asking its members for the go-ahead 
to strike. They are expected to put it to a vote the first week in 
December. The union wants a retroactive 5% pay increase and an additional 
19% raise over four years. Fed ex has offered a 17% pay raise over 
five years. If a strike were authorized, it could happen during the 
busy holiday season, when fed ex ships more than 4 million packages 
a day.
