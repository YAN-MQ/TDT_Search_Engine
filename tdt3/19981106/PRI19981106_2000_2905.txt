Still to come, we stay in India for a story about a primitive tribe 
that's taken a liking to modern cuisine on PRI. Hi, I'm Chef Jim Coleman. 
And on the next "Chef's Table," nutrition and women's health. We'll 
talk about women's special dietary needs and also the latest research 
on the connection between plant estrogens and cancer prevention. That's 
on the next "Chef's Table" this Saturday at noon here on 91 fm, whyy. 
This is THE WORLD. I'm Lisa
