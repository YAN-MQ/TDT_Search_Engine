Two men wanted for a murder in New York and drug smuggling in Florida 
will be sent to the United States by Jamaican authorities, following 
court hearings this week. Christopher Ashby, a Jamaican, will be sent 
to New York to face charges of murder, attempted murder, robbery, 
burglary and assault. He is accused of robbing a woman at gunpoint 
at her home in Valley Stream, New York, on July 24, 1995, and then 
killing her son and wounding her husband when they arrived home during 
the crime. In a separate case, U.S. resident John Crawford, who was 
convicted of possession of marijuana with intent to distribute it 
on May 19, 1981, in Fort Lauderdale, Florida, waived extradition and 
agreed to return to the United States. Authorities said Crawford had 
fled to Jamaica after his conviction while he was awaiting sentencing 
and was managing a garment factory in Montego Bay when he was arrested.
