The sticky resin that grounded about 20 planes at Milan's problematic 
Malpensa airport has been cleared from the runway and flights are 
back on schedule, airport officials said Friday. One of the airport's 
two runways was closed Thursday after officials discovered that a 
resin applied overnight had melted and was sticking to the wheels 
of aircraft that landed or were trying to take-off. The resin was 
applied to make the runways more visible to pilots. The head of the 
company that runs the airport blamed workers that had been sub-contracted 
for the job and said he would report the incident to authorities. 
Prosecutors in Varese, about 50 kilometers (48 miles) north of Milan, 
on Friday opened an investigation into the incident. Chaos has raged 
at the newly revamped Malpensa hub since it opened Oct. 25. For days, 
baggage was lost and flights were delayed for several hours or diverted 
elsewhere. Escalators broke and passengers had to walk long distances 
to gates. There weren't enough parking places for planes nor shuttle 
buses to transport travelers from boarding gates to the aircraft. 
The EU transport commissioner has reportedly sent a letter to Italy's 
transport ministry demanding explanations for the chaos.
