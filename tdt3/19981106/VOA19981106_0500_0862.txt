Western diplomats are rushing to set up observer missions in Kosovo 
even as some low-intensity fighting continues in that troubled province. 
Philip Smucker reports from Prisrin in southern Kosovo. The observer 
missions are being set up by the Organization for Security and Cooperation 
in Europe. A group of OSCE peace observers from Britain, who were 
on their way to set up operations in Prisrin, had their first brush 
with fighting on Thursday. British Lieutenant Colonel David Myer said 
a Serbian army unit in front of the British convoy came under fire, 
but no injuries were reported. In a similar incident, Serbian police 
say they killed a uniformed ethnic Albanian rebel near the town of 
Klina. The British team was on its way to set up one of the first 
OSCE mission offices outside the capital, Pristina. Fifty British 
observers, most of them with military experience, are expected to 
man the outpost. The OSCE mission will monitor a tense cease-fire 
between Serb security forces and the rebel ethnic Albanian Kosovo 
Liberation Army. The OSCE mandate also includes brokering cease-fires 
and helping to create an ethnically mixed police force in Kosovo. 
British observers in Prisrin, a former Ottoman trading center, are 
to be based in a hotel. Only a few kilometers from their headquarters 
are the winding mountain paths used by Albanian guerrilla fighters 
to smuggle in arms and men. Town residents remain skeptical about 
the unarmed OSCE mission. Ethnic Albanians say they doubt it can end 
police beatings, and Serbs warn that they will not stand for being 
judged by outside powers. Philip Smucker for VOA NEWS, Prisrin.
