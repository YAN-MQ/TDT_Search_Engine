Now, here's the extended weather forecast for the United States. I'm 
meteorologist Dave Hennen with your "CNN Headline News Weather." Cold 
temperatures remain today over parts of Montana and the dakotas, where 
it will not make it above the freezing Mark. Much of the east seeing 
temperatures in the 40s and 50s all the way back down to the gulf 
coast. Your forecast weather maps -- later today on into Saturday, 
first of all, showing high pressure and fair weather, but cool temperatures 
over much of the east. The west is stormy, and that storm moving into 
the plains by tomorrow bringing with it heavier snow and heavier shower 
and thunderstorm activity further to the south. New storm into California, 
Oregon tomorrow, spreading rain along the coast, and higher-elevation 
snows are expected. A look now at the extended forecast -- on Sunday, 
rain could make it into los Angeles as we watch mountain snows develop. 
A few thunderstorms along the gulf coast during the day on Sunday. 
By Monday, a significant snowstorm could be developing in the rocky 
mountains. We'll find heavy snows from Colorado back in through Wyoming 
and Utah. Look for thunderstorms to be breaking out back through the 
plains. Much the same on Tuesday as that storm spreads in through 
the upper midwest. For more weather information, log into CNN.com.
