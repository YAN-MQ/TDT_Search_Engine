The United Nations Security Council is putting more pressure on Iraq 
to resume cooperating with U.N. weapons inspectors. The council approved 
a resolution Thursday condemning Iraq's decision to suspend its cooperation 
with the inspectors. VOA's Max Rustin reports. The resolution was 
approved unanimously by the council after three days of discussion. 
Diplomats say the resolution is clear and forceful, laying the groundwork 
for the use of force against Iraq if Iraq does not agree to resume 
cooperation with the weapons inspection commission. U.S. Ambassador 
Peter Burleigh was one of 15 speakers in the council meeting on the 
resolution. By adopting this resolution, the Security Council has 
sent a clear and unmistakable message to Iraq, noncompliance will 
not be rewarded or tolerated. Iraqi efforts to defy council resolutions 
and obtain a lifting of sanctions without full compliance have failed 
and will fail. Compliance with the council's resolutions is the only 
course which will lead Iraq back towards acceptance within the community 
of nations. The resolution expresses alarm at Iraq's October 31st 
decision to halt cooperation with the inspection commission. It demands 
that Iraq immediately and unconditionally resume cooperation. It says 
Iraq's cooperation is essential for the implementation of resolutions 
concerning Iraq approved after the Gulf War. Those resolutions re... 
... has destroyed all its weapons of mass destruction before international 
sanctions can be lifted. Iraq says it has met all the requirements 
set forward in relevant council resolutions. It accuses the United 
States and Britain of using the inspection process to unfairly prolong 
sanctions in an effort to overthrow the Iraqi government, charges 
Security Council members strongly deny. Security Council members say 
the resolution approved Thursday is the result of a strong consensus 
within the council that Iraq needlessly escalated tension by suspending 
cooperation with the weapons inspection commission. Sweden's ambassador 
to the United Nations says the points in the resolution should be 
viewed by Iraq as a series of exit signs it needs to follow if it 
truly wants sanctions lifted. Max Rustin, VOA NEWS, United Nations.
