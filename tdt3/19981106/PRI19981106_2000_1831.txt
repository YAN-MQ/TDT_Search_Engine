House Speaker Newt Gingrich has told his fellow Republicans he's quitting. 
In the last few days, he's taken much of the blame for the party's 
poor showing in the midterm elections. A fierce battle is expected 
over the next few months to find a successor. Earlier today, a formal 
challenge to his leadership was mounted by the chairman of the Appropriations 
Committee, Bob Livingston. President Clinton says he's surprised and 
called Gingrich a worthy adversary.
