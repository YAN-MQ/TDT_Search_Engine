Sahid Aburish is a Palestinian writer and commentator based in London. 
Mr. Aburish, how are we to interpret events like today's attack? Are 
they intended only to derail the peace process, and are they supported 
by many Palestinian people? Well, I think they are intended to derail 
the peace process. This is by the sound of it, Hamas, and Hamas does 
represent about 20 percent of the Palestinians and the West Bank and 
Gaza. And there is a great deal of sympathy for the 20 percent of 
Hamas for what Hamas does. And that is because Arafat basically has 
not been able to deliver a great deal. So then in that case, when 
Yasir Arafat does what he did in the past couple of weeks, and that 
is to place the spiritual leader of Hamas under virtual house arrest 
and to cut his telephone lines, is that an effective tactic or do 
people see that as something that could possibly backfire and in fact 
mean a good recruiting tool for Hamas? I think that was a most unwise 
move on the part of Arafat to place that old crippled, paralyzed man 
under house arrest and to isolate him from the rest of the world. 
Sheik Yassim... This man is highly thought of by the Palestinian people, 
and if something happens to him, if he dies, we're going to have a 
blood bath in Gaza. I don't know. Arafat seems to be listening to 
his own voices. I don't know where he gets these ideas from. Simultaneously, 
that should not mean ever that other people who may very well be innocent 
should be imprisoned just because we have sympathies or, you know, 
members of Hamas. You're talking about one-quarter of the population. 
And if we listen to the Israelis, they want Arafat to place them all 
in prison. This is just - Humanly, it's impossible. Palestinian writer 
and commentator, Sahid Aburish, speaking with us from Londong, thank 
you very much. Thank you.
