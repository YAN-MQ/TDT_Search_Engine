In another shift in the landscape of the book industry, Barnes &AMP; 
Noble, the nation's largest bookseller, announced the $600 million 
purchase Friday of the leading wholesaler Ingram Book Group. An organization 
of independent booksellers immediately denounced the deal as ``devastating,'' 
and an authors' group compared it to a wedding of Godzilla and King 
Kong. Pressing to expand its distribution network, Barnes &AMP; Noble 
agreed to acquire the privately held subsidiary of Ingram Industries 
Inc. for $200 million in cash and $400 million in stock. The arrangement 
will give the company access to 11 distribution centers, which will 
help it cut costs and reduce delivery time for its growing base of 
online customers, ``I couldn't possibly spell out all of the many 
benefits and synergies we will realize as a result of this transaction,'' 
Leonard Riggio, the chairman of Barnes &AMP; Noble, said in a statement 
announcing the agreement, which was struck after several weeks of 
negotiations with Ingram. The announcement comes amid a series of 
moves by the bookstore giant. It recently formed an alliance with 
the media conglomerate Bertelsmann AG to run its online bookstore 
as a joint venture and announced earlier this week the selection of 
Jonathan Bulkeley as chief executive of the venture. Barnes and Noble 
has been struggling to increase its share in the growing online market, 
where the pioneering Amazon.com is the clear leader. For independent 
booksellers, the worst fear is that a new book conglomerate mixing 
Ingram and Barnes &AMP; Noble could ultimately affect such issues 
as their credit, speed of delivery and access to popular titles that 
are in short supply. Although Ingram, which is based in Nashville, 
is a dominant force in book distribution, it does not disclose its 
market share. Barnes &AMP; Noble accounts for one of every eight books 
sold in the United States, according to Hoover's Inc., a research 
company. Amazon.com, which got its start by relying on wholesalers 
to fill its orders, also depends on the services of Ingram, which 
has been its leading supplier, filling more than 58 percent of its 
orders, according to Amazon.com. On Friday, the Seattle-based Amazon.com 
issued a statement stressing that it purchases books from a variety 
of sources, including Ingram, and will continue to increase its direct 
purchasing from publishers. However, the company also raised concerns 
about the combination of the country's biggest book retailer with 
its biggest distributor, expressing the hope that Ingram will show 
``a strong commitment to treating all bookstores fairly. ``To our 
customers: Worry not,'' Amazon founder, Jeff Bezos, said in the company 
statement. ``Those who make choices that are genuinely good for customers, 
authors and publishers will prevail. Goliath is always in range of 
a good slingshot.'' Federal regulators must review the purchase for 
any antitrust violations under the Hart Scott Rodino Act. That analysis 
will include scrutiny of such elements as prices, delivery and special 
deals. David Brodwin, an associate partner at Andersen Consulting, 
a management and technology consulting firm, said the bookstore chain 
was obviously trying to become a more competitive force in electronic 
commerce so that customers get their deliveries faster and cheaper. 
``As E-commerce takes hold, it puts severe pressure on the distribution 
to be more efficient,'' he said. ``This isn't a completely new thing. 
This is a continuation of all the price competition that's hit book 
retailing. Electronic retailing makes it much more severe than ever 
before so that by pulling together entities like this it's possible 
to get much lower operating costs.'' Brodwin said the acquisition 
probably posed great hazards for independent booksellers, who had 
subscribed to the unwritten rule that ``people in the distribution 
channel don't compete with their customers, their retailers.'' ``Of 
course, when there's a merger like this, it makes the retailers feel 
threatened,'' he said. ``They feel they might not get the best pricing 
or they might not get the most current availability of a book when 
they want a hot title.'' The American Booksellers Association, the 
trade organization for independents, said it had already prepared 
letters for the Justice Department and the Federal Trade Commission 
demanding an investigation of the purchase. Barnes &AMP; Noble said 
it would apply on Monday for the review by federal regulators. In 
a statement, the booksellers group called the deal a ``devastating 
development that threatens the viability of competition in the book 
industry.'' Asked if the organization was considering forming a distribution 
cooperative of its own, its executive director, Avin Mark Domnitz, 
said it was examining all options, including new ``alliances and strategic 
partnerships.'' Many smaller bookstores rely primarily on Ingram for 
book orders, he said, although typically the larger stores place orders 
directly through the publishers, Ingram, and the second-largest wholesaler, 
Baker &AMP; Taylor. The New York Times Co.has a marketing partnership 
with Barnes and Noble that allows readers of the newspaper's World 
Wide Web site to order books directly from the bookseller. The Times 
receives a transaction fee. The New York-based Authors Guild also 
expressed qualms about the effect of the purchase on the shrinking 
base of independent bookstores. ``If I were an independent bookseller, 
I would be scared to death by this,'' said Paul Aiken, the executive 
director of the guild. ``The Godzilla of publishing is wedding the 
King Kong of distribution. These are the two huge players in the field 
and from an author's concern, the independent bookstores have been 
our strongest allies for the barely known author.'' Stephen Riggio, 
the vice-chairman of Barnes &AMP; Noble and brother of Leonard Riggio, 
insisted Friday that Ingram customers will be treated no differently 
than Barnes &AMP; Noble stores are. ``We are going to continue service 
to all of Ingram's customers,'' he said. ``We will continue to provide 
them with the same level of outstanding service. They're obviously 
free to buy whomever they choose, but as I said we not only intend 
to deliver the same level of service, but to increase it.'' Riggio 
said that he expected the deal to close in the next 35 to 45 days.
