Some republicans are saying their party's disappointing showing at 
this week's elections are a reflection of poor leadership at the top. 
And some are saying it's time for house speaker Newt Gingrich to step 
aside. Frank Sesno reports. With republicans still in shock over Tuesday's 
electoral setbacks, the calls for an end to the Gingrich era are intensifying 
and spilling onto national television. We have to pick somebody who's 
a visionary, somebody who can get up and articulate a vision of something 
better. Salmon's comments are the most detailed and public yet and 
come from a longtime critic. But they reflect deep dissatisfaction 
among republicans who blame Gingrich and other house leaders for what 
they consider to be a political disaster on election day. Several 
party leaders who've talked with Gingrich say he is "doing a lot of 
thinking." Well, leadership takes credit when things go right, they 
ought to take the blame when things go wrong. CNN has learned that 
Louisiana congressman Bob Livingston, chairman of the powerful house 
appropriations committee, is telling fellow republicans he plans to 
run for speaker. He's been approached by another house member who 
makes no secret of his views. I think that we're in a period right 
now where we have to reassess our leadership. We have to reassess 
who we are and what we're about. Sources say Largent met with Livingston 
and suggested they run as a team. Livingston rejected the idea after 
consulting with senior republicans, who consider Largent too green 
and too volatile. I think the best hope for the speaker is that no 
single person emerges as an alternative to him. Gingrich's office 
is not commenting, except to underline what he said Wednesday. It's 
pretty hard to argue that the only team to have been successful in 
70 years somehow ought to be replaced by somebody who has not ever 
won a Nationwide election. It's not the first time Gingrich has faced 
an insurrection. But this time, according to several senior republicans, 
there's an emerging consensus that change is needed at the top. Frank
