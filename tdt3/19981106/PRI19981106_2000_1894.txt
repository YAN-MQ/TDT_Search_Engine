Relief is starting to arrive in some parts of Honduras, worst hit 
by last week's hurricane. But in many places, people remain desperate 
for food and drinking water. Tom Gibb is there. Reports from the southern 
city of Choluteca say people are getting desperate for food, clothes, 
and clean water. There, a torrent washed away 12 entire neighborhoods 
killing hundreds of people. There's a smell of death by the river 
suggesting many bodies are still buried in the mud. There's an air 
strip in the town and Honduran military flights have been arriving 
there for at least 24 hours, but the aid is clearly not enough. The 
situation in outlying villages still completely cut off is likely 
to be much worse. Tom Gibb in Honduras.
