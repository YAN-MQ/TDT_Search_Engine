NYON, Switzerland (AP) _ UEFA's control and disciplinary body will 
decide Sunday what action to take over the incident that caused the 
suspension of a match between Fiorentina and Grasshoppers of Switzerland, 
the European body said Friday. UEFA representatives asked the referee 
not to start the second half of Tuesday's second-round second leg 
UEFA Cup match after an off-field official was injured by the explosion 
of a device hurled from the stands. The game was being played in Salerno, 
near Naples, following the suspension of Fiorentina's own ground and 
to raise funds for the victims of recent floodings in southern Italy. 
Fiorentina was paying the second and last round of suspension of its 
Franchi stadium as a result of its fans misbehavior during a Cup Winners 
Cup game against Barcelona in 1997. Although playing away from home 
Fiorentina still was considered responsible for the fans' behavior 
in Salerno. The Italian club could face a ban from European competition 
of one or more seasons and a 3-0 forfeit defeat. The incident occurred 
as players and officials were walking to the dressing rooms at the 
end of the first half. Fiorentina, which had won the first leg 2-0, 
was a favorite to qualify. The Italian club was leading 2-1 in the 
second leg when the game was suspended.
