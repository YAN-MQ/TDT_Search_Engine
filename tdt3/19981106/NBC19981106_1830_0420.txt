Still ahead tonight, the other man who's talked about big time these 
days in American politics. Jesse "the body/the mind" Ventura. "In 
depth" tonight -- does the governor-elect have what it takes to run 
a State? I have personal pride. I have personal pride that I do a 
good job at everything I do. Jesse Ventura, on the issues and what 
the people really think now that he's won the election. And an insider's 
view of the space shuttle. What's it really like up there for John 
Glenn and his fellow astronauts? Something big is happening. It's 
the truck. And it's here. Introducing the new Silverado. It's bigger... 
it's more powerful... it's the truck... from Chevrolet. Like a rock 
oh, like a rock.
