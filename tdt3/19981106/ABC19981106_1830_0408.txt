The United States is getting closer to attacking Iraq. It became much 
clearer today. The U.S. is looking for a way to punish Saddam Hussein 
for refusing to comply with United Nations weapon inspections unless 
economic sanctions are lifted. Here's ABC's John McWethy. U.S. military 
sources say the Clinton administration is moving toward a decision 
that could mean air strikes against Iraq as early as next week. Sources 
say the administration is weighing two options. Option one, limited 
air strikes soon. This plan would be executed without major reinforcements, 
using weapons already in the Persian gulf, planes based on the one 
aircraft carrier there and cruise missiles, plus some long-range bombers. 
Option two -- build up the force in the gulf so air strikes could 
be far more punishing and be sustained over a period of weeks. This 
option would allow more time for a diplomatic solution. ABC News has 
learned that in preparation for either option, the U.S. is taking 
steps toward sending patriot air defense missiles to Israel, just 
in case Iraq trieso retaliate with Scud missiles as it did during 
the gulf war. Those urging the president to strike quickly, argue 
that to delay makes the U.S. look weak and that very few countries 
are likely to change their positions if given time for more debate. 
But others argue that quick use of American force will only further 
isolate the U.S. they point out that, in the past Saddam Hussein has 
been forced to back down without the U.S. firing a shot, simply by 
building military and diplomatic pressure. Officials say a decision 
on which option to pursue could come as early as this weekend. John
