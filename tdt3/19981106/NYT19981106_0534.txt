When Christopher Scala decided to dress up as Babe Ruth for a school 
project two years ago, it brought back memories for his great-grandmother. 
Viola Bevilacque recalled that her late husband, Charles, had been 
given a ball bearing Ruth's signature back in 1927. A hunt through 
her attic in Chatham, N.J., turned up the ball that Ruth is believed 
to have hit for the first home run in Yankee Stadium. And the ball 
is expected to fetch a record price when it is sold Thursday at Leland's, 
an auction house specializing in sports memorabilia. At a news conference 
Friday morning at the Official All Star Cafe in Manhattan, Leland's 
chairman Joshua Leland Evans said the minimum bid allowed would be 
$50,000. ``This is probably the most important thing we've ever auctioned,'' 
Evans said. ``It could sell for a lot of money.'' He refused to guess 
how much, but he cited the current record price for a baseball, $93,500, 
which the actor Charlie Sheen paid for the ball that the Mets' Mookie 
Wilson hit between the legs of Boston's Bill Buckner to score the 
winning run in Game 6 of the 1986 World Series. Evans said he thought 
that this ball was considerably more valuable. Evans and Mark Scala 
_ Christopher's father, who, along with his family, was also at Friday's 
news conference _ both noted the timing of the sale, on the heels 
of a baseball season dominated by the race between Mark McGwire and 
Sammy Sosa to break the single-season home run record. Evans and Scala 
said they expected this to boost the selling price of that baseball. 
``We have Leland's catalog here, and this ball has been generating 
a lot of interest,'' said Phil Castinetti, who owns a sports memorabilia 
store in Boston and runs sports memorabilia auctions. ``It's not the 
flavor of the moment, but it could easily go for over a hundred thousand, 
if it's authentic.'' Evans and Scala both said they were convinced 
the baseball was the one Ruth hit in 1923. Evans said three factors 
were considered when the baseball was evaluated: who and where the 
ball came from; whether it was made with the materials and methods 
of the day, which the ball's Reach logo and its alternating red and 
blue stitching prove it was, and the autograph and inscription, which 
reads, ``First home run hit in Yankee Stadium, April 18, 1923,'' and 
is signed, ``Babe Ruth.'' ``The most important thing is the inscription 
by Babe Ruth, and we've sold, over the last 20 years, thousands of 
Babe Ruth signatures, and you just learn what a Babe Ruth signature 
is,'' Evans said. The ball was found when Scala mentioned to his grandmother 
that Christopher was dressing up as Ruth for school. Bevilacque remembered 
the baseball given to her husband as a prize for being named to a 
New Jersey all-state high school baseball team. But it was not until 
Scala heard the date of Ruth's first home run in Yankee Stadium during 
the broadcast of the 1996 World Series between the Yankees and the 
Atlanta Braves that he realized it was the same as the one scribbled 
on the yellow, tattered baseball, and that his family owned what might 
be a piece of Yankee history. ``It wasn't easy deciding to sell it, 
but we're middle-class people and I have to think about my family's 
future,'' said Scala, 42, a graphic designer who lives in Ramsey, 
N.J. ``Whatever it's sold for, we are going to make a lot of money.'' 
He would not elaborate on what the money would be used for. Christopher, 
11, said he would be sad to see the ball go, but he did not see the 
point in keeping it, either. ``I hope that someone buys it who lets 
other people see it,'' he said. ``It would be great if it ended up 
in the Hall of Fame.''
