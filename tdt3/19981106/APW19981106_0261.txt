Desperate to obtain one of the 38,000 work permits Italy will issue 
in the next five weeks, tens of thousands of illegal immigrants are 
lining up outside police stations day and night, overwhelming authorities 
trying to grapple with the paperwork. Italian dailies reported Friday 
that many police stations had run out of application forms and that 
immigrants were confused and angry. Fights also regularly break out 
among immigrants trying to reach the front of the line. Italy began 
issuing the permits Wednesday under a limited amnesty decree. To qualify, 
immigrants need to prove they entered the country prior to March 27 
and that they have a job and place to stay. Most of those applying 
for permits entered the country illegally and work in the underground 
economy. Lacking proper documents, they are using everything from 
parking tickets to old grocery bills to try to demonstrate when they 
arrived and where they work. Illegals have until Dec. 15 to apply 
for the permits, which would allow them to live and work in Italy 
for two years. Italy plans to accept at least 3,000 Albanians and 
1,500 Moroccans and Tunisians. This is the first time Italy has set 
quotas for immigrants. It previously granted permits on a case-by-case 
basis to those who could prove they were victims of persecution at 
home or had a job awaiting them in Italy. Many businesses, especially 
in the agricultural sector, currently rely on illegal immigrants for 
seasonal jobs such as tomato picking. The legalization of 38,000 immigrants 
is in part intended so that employers have the workers they need for 
jobs Italians won't take, despite the country's 12.5 percent unemployment 
rate. Thousands of would-be immigrants have reached Italy's long coastline 
on boats in the past year, fleeing violence in the Balkans or abandoning 
northern Africa in search of a better life.
