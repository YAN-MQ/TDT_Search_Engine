Mitsubishi Motors Corp. announced a global restructuring drive Friday 
that will include major job cuts in the United States and Thailand, 
factory closures in Japan and a steep reduction in production. Mitsubishi, 
one of Japan's biggest automakers, will lay off 1,000 workers at subsidiaries 
in Illinois and California, which now employ 5,100 workers, as well 
as 1,200 of its 4,000 employees in Thailand, said company president 
Katsuhiko Kawasoe. The company will also reduce the number of its 
car models by 40 percent and close two plants in Japan, Kawasoe told 
reporters. Mitsubishi said it hopes to cut costs by 350 billion yen 
(dlrs 3 billion) by 2001 and return to profitability after suffering 
huge losses from Japan's recession and the Asian financial crisis. 
``The economic situation is very severe, but we have to do our utmost 
to return to profitability as soon as possible,'' Kawasoe said. Mitsubishi 
reported heavy losses Friday for the first half of the current fiscal 
year ended Sept. 30, posting a net loss of 28.64 billion yen (dlrs 
243 million). It posted a profit of 8.60 billion yen (dlrs 73 million) 
for the same period last year. Mitsubishi said it had been hit hardest 
in Japan by a sharp fall in consumer demand for cars and stiffer competition 
among automakers. It said that the economic turmoil in Asia also sharply 
cut into the profitability of its overseas operations. Mitsubishi 
announced that it would cut 700 jobs at its Mitsubishi Motors Mfg. 
of America plant in Illinois, which makes the Galant, Eclipse and 
Eclipse Spider convertible models. The subsidiary now employs about 
3,900 workers. Three hundred jobs, or 25 percent of the employees 
at Mitsubishi Motors Sales of America in California, will also be 
cut. Mitsubishi said it aims to return to profitability on a group 
level by the fiscal year ending March 2001, in which it hopes to post 
a group profit of 20 billion yen (dlrs 170 million) on sales of 4 
trillion yen (dlrs 34.90 billion). In fiscal 1997, ending in March 
this year, Mitsubishi posted a group loss of 101.9 billion yen (dlrs 
864 million).
