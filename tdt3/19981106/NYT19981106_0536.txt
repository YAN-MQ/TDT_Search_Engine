Citing the potential for confusion among viewers between ``fact-based 
entertainment and hard news,'' executives of the ABC television network 
said Friday that the network had dropped plans to broadcast a prime-time 
special, produced by the filmmaker Oliver Stone, about the theory 
that long-range missiles caused the crash of Trans World Airlines 
Flight 800 off Long Island, N.Y. The decision came after several ABC 
journalists had expressed dismay to their superiors about the proposed 
program, called ``Oliver Stone's Declassified,'' fearing that viewers 
would perceive it as an ABC News report. ABC News has reported that 
the missile theories are groundless. ``Clearly, Oliver Stone is a 
gifted writer-director with a strong record of producing compelling 
dramatic movies,'' a statement issued by ABC said. ``On reflection, 
we believe this genre may not be appropriate for a television network 
with a strong news record and identity.'' Patricia Matson, the network's 
chief spokeswoman, said no ABC executive would comment further. Neither 
Stone nor a spokesman for his company, Illusion Entertainment, returned 
phone calls seeking comment Friday. Assorted theories about bombs 
and missiles have been widely discredited since the crash of TWA Flight 
800, on July 17, 1996, in which 230 people died. Most aviation experts 
believe a spark of unknown origin in the center fuel tank caused the 
plane to explode over Long Island Sound. The National Transportation 
Safety Board, the FBI and the CIA have all said there is no evidence 
to support the theory that the crash was caused by a missile or missiles. 
But several former military officers, citing witnesses' accounts of 
streaks of light in the sky before the plane exploded, insist that 
the missile hypothesis has never been adequately examined. Some people 
have accused the FBI of suppressing evidence. The Seattle Times first 
reported ABC's decision Friday, after the newspaper's aviation industry 
reporter, Chuck Taylor, telephoned the relatives of many of the victims 
to ask how they felt about the Oliver Stone television program. According 
to his report, most of the people he spoke to agree with the conclusions 
of the safety board and the FBI. Taylor also reported that some victims' 
relatives said they had written to ABC Entertainment's president, 
Jamie Tarses, urging the network to abandon the Stone project. As 
of Friday, Ms. Tarses said she had not received the letter. Kevin 
Brockman, a spokesman for ABC Entertainment in Los Angeles, said 50 
to 60 specials went into development each year and about half of them 
ultimately appeared on the air. Neither he nor Ms. Matson would comment 
on the amount of money invested in the Stone project.
