A 77-year-old astronaut has touched the child within an entire generation 
of Americans. And his latest mission is reaching a new generation, 
too. Anne McDermott reports. When we were young, the closest we got 
to this kind of action was at breakfast. Tang, proud of even its small 
role in outer space. Well, kids still drink Tang. But they also run 
rovers -- make shuttles -- and sometimes even suit up. And what's 
so good about that? Everything! All right! And now, they're learning 
some new things about an old hero -- a Man most didn't even know existed 
till now. 5, 4, 3, 2, 1, blastoff! Cool! Real cool for an old guy, 
as the kids say, though some aren't all that clear just how old. Um, 
he's 88 years old. not 88. How old is he, guys? 77! Well, they weren't 
around when John Glenn first made headlines. Neither was their teacher. 
And some of these kids' parents weren't even born. But they're learning. 
John Glenn is a famous astronaut because he was the first American 
to orbit the earth. Now teachers are using Glenn's latest voyage as 
a teaching tool for arts and the crafting of essays, like this one. 
Space is one of the places we have just barely begun to scratch the 
surface of exploring. Her classmate wants to do some personal exploring. 
Yeah, I want to find an alien on Mars. But in the meantime, both kids 
got to go to Florida for the blastoff. The blastoff. Children seemed 
so excited about it, so in awe. And maybe that is the real gift of 
this mission -- seeing that wonder again. Remember when we had it?
