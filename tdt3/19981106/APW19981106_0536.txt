About 80 youths, some armed with gasoline bombs and fireworks rockets, 
clashed with riot police in two northern cities after annual ``Bonfire 
Night'' celebrations, authorities said Friday. A crowd gathered near 
the Toller Lane police station in the northern England town of Bradford 
at 1 a.m. (0100 GMT) Friday and refused to disperse, despite orders 
to do so from community leaders and police. In addition to clashes 
with police, a local car dealer's garage was set on fire and destroyed, 
authorities said. No one was injured and no arrests were made. Bonfire 
Night is an annual celebration of the discovery of the 1605 ``Gunpowder 
plot'' by Guy Fawkes to blow up the Houses of Parliament. It is celebrated 
throughout the country with bonfires and fireworks displays. Earlier, 
at about 7 p.m. (1900 GMT) Thursday, violence broke out in nearby 
Halifax, with several police cars set alight. Local community leaders 
and officers from across West Yorkshire were called in to help disperse 
the crowd.
