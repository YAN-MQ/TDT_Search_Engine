$70 million in U.S. aid is headed to central America to help combat 
the devastation from hurricane Mitch. Tipper Gore heads to the region 
Tuesday to formally deliver disaster assistance. In the meantime, 
supplies will be airlifted to supplement relief coming by ship. The 
call is going out for drinking water, medicine, baby formula, blankets 
and food. Jim hill takes a look at some of the people responding to 
the cries for help. The Emanuel Presbyterian church held a candlelight 
vigil in Los angeles, praying for the storm victims of central America. 
And Spanish language radio stations in the city put out the call for 
hurricane relief supplies. The city's large Hispanic population is 
responding. A lot of people come here today. Look, we cannot walk 
here for the donations. Many people donating clothes and food have 
relatives in central america. Ana Garcia says she has three children. 
This relief agency normally AIDS El Salvador, but is now expanding 
its shipments of food and clothing. First of all, we're starting with 
Honduras, which was the most devastated, first of all. And then it 
goes to El Salvador, Nicaragua and part of Guatemala. So we're asking 
for help for all of central America. Hurricane Mitch and its aftermath 
have destroyed many of the roads and bridges in Honduras and Nicaragua. 
Getting supplies where they're needed is a critical challenge for 
relief agencies. This is probably the worst disaster in central America 
in this century, by all estimates. As private agencies amass supplies 
and ask for financial donations, the U.S. government is pledging $70 
million in disaster aid. The need for relief could go on for quite 
some time. The damage in central America is so widespread, it may 
take months or even years for the countries to rebuild. Jim hill, 
CNN, Los Angeles.
