The Clinton administration said Friday that rebuilding the four Central 
American nations devastated by Hurricane Mitch would cost hundreds 
of millions, if not billions, of dollars and last for several years. 
The United States has already committed $70 million to the relief 
effort. But administration officials acknowledged that the four nations 
_ El Salvador, Guatemala, Honduras and Nicaragua _ will require many 
times that amount of aid, and that Honduras and Nicaragua in particular 
have been so devastated that they will be almost entirely dependent 
on the outside world for food and shelter for the next year. ``Those 
two nations have been wiped out,'' said J. Brian Atwood, head of the 
U.S. Agency for International Development, which is overseeing the 
administration's disaster relief effort in Central America. In Honduras, 
he said, ``basically the crops of that country have been destroyed 
in their entirety.'' The Defense Department, which has dispatched 
25 helicopters and four cargo planes to assist in the rescue effort, 
said that several more U.S. military aircraft would arrive in Central 
America this weekend. The government of Nicaragua has said it needed 
at least 20 U.S. helicopters to transport food and supplies to isolated 
regions, and that only eight helicopters had been dispatched so far. 
Still, the Nicaraguan ambassador to the United States, Francisco Aguirre-Sacasa, 
offered no criticism of the United States and other donor nations. 
``I think what happened was that this hurricane threw a sucker punch 
at everybody and no one really understood at first how bad this was,'' 
he said in an interview. ``It took a little while for this to fully 
sink in in the U.S. Now it has, and I want to emphasize that I feel 
very gratified by the announcement of $70 million in emergency relief.'' 
Stephen Lucas, a spokesman for the U.S. Southern Command, the unit 
of the Defense Department that is responsible for Central American 
affairs, said that the United States ``is throwing everything we can 
at this.'' He continued: `` Could we be doing more? Should we be doing 
more? The answer to that is probably yes. But an undertaking of this 
size is not easily organized.'' American charity organizations involved 
in the relief effort strained for words to describe the scale of the 
disaster, which is estimated to have killed more than 10,000 people 
and left vast stretches of Central American underwater. ``This is 
even worse than all the damage done in Central America during the 
decades of war there,'' said Michael Delaney, regional director for 
Latin America and the Caribbean for Oxfam America, a Boston-based 
charity. ``After their wars, Nicaragua and El Salvador had a period 
of peace to develop their local economies, and now all of that progress 
is destroyed.'' Several prominent aid organizations said they welcomed 
President Clinton's announcement earlier this week that the United 
States would organize an initial emergency aid package of $70 million. 
Delaney said that the relief effort mounted by the United States may 
have been slow to start in the hours after the hurricane passed through 
the region. ``But I think that's normal,'' he said. ``I don't have 
any criticism. The $70 million will be important in the short term. 
What we need to watch is the middle to long-term in regards to the 
American response.'' Atwood, the head of AID, said in an interview 
that the United States and other donor nations would have to help 
Honduras and Nicaragua _ and El Salvador and Guatemala, to a lesser 
extent _ rebuild their most basic infrastructure, including road networks 
and telephone systems. ``The $70 million is simply the first major 
tranche of aid,'' he said. ``We really are going to have to be engaged 
in the reconstruction of these countries.'' He said the destruction 
of so much farmland had left much of Central America without any source 
of income. ``The whole agricultural sector has just been wiped out,'' 
he said. ``And so in what are basically rural agricultural communities 
in these countries, their one and key source of income is gone.'' 
Charity groups said that the disaster had produced an outpouring of 
offers of money and other assistance from the American public, a response 
in large part to the dramatic television images of the aftermath of 
the hurricane. ``It's amazing _ we're seeking a response here that 
we haven't seen in quite some time,'' said Cynthia Glocker, a spokeswoman 
for Care, the Atlanta-based relief organization. ``From the minute 
this happened, we've been getting calls offering help. Our phones 
are ringing off the hook. We get 800 calls a day about this.''
