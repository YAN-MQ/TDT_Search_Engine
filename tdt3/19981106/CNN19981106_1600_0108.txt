Congressman Steve Largent of Oklahoma will challenge house majority 
leader dick Armey for his post. Like Livingston, Largent is popular 
with house conservatives. He's a former pro football player who was 
first elected in 1994. Largent says senior GOP leaders must accept 
responsibility for the party's losses Tuesday. On November 3rd, the 
republican party hit an iceberg. And I think the question that is 
before our conference today is whether we retain the crew of the "Titanic" 
or we look for some new leadership. It's my opinion that it would 
be better to attempt and fail in my effort to run for majority leader 
and provide some new and different leadership for our conference than 
never to attempt it at all. Largent says the GOP must look back to 
the Reagan years, when, he says, a Consistent message was merged with 
a believable messenger.
