An opera singer was released from a Milwaukee hospital Thursday after 
a Case of life imitating art. Kimm Julian was accidentally stabbed 
while rehearsing "I pagliacci." In the scene where the actor playing 
his lover's wife declares he is "no longer acting" and stabs him, 
the blade of the prop knife they were using did not retract on cue. 
Julian underwent emergency surgery and is now recuperating at home. 
He has decided to bow out of the production.
