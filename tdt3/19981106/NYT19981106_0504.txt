The City Council is moving to repeal the adults-only clause of the 
law restricting sex-related entertainment to thwart a recent court 
ruling allowing a topless club to stay open by saying it would admit 
minors. But the club's lawyer said the proposed revision would subject 
the law to further constitutional challenges. The latest maneuvering 
over the city's campaign to curb sex-related businesses was prompted 
by a ruling Wednesday by state Supreme Court Justice Stephen Crane 
of in the case of Ten's World Class Cabaret on East 21st Street. The 
city had tried to close the club, citing a ban against such businesses 
within 500 feet of a church. But Ten's argued that its policy of admitting 
minors meant the club was exempt from the law because part of its 
legal definition of sex-related businesses is that they exclude minors. 
The judge agreed. Mayor Rudolph Giuliani denounced the ruling as absurd, 
ordered the city to appeal and predicted that Crane's decision would 
be overturned. Friday, City Council Speaker Peter Vallone announced 
that the council was preparing to delete the exclusion of minors from 
the legal definition. He said that he would present the change to 
the council on Thursday and that it would take about two months to 
wend its way through the land-use review process, which includes Planning 
Commission approval. ``The spirit of our city's zoning regulations 
on adult entertainment businesses has been misinterpreted, and that 
is a shame,'' Vallone said. ``Anyone who thinks a strip club is an 
acceptable place to bring children is not using common sense. I have 
instructed my land-use and legal staff to immediately draft remedial 
legislation to amend the zoning text so that this type of legal maneuvering 
does not have an unintended result again.'' But the lawyer for Ten's, 
Mark Alonso, said he would welcome the revision, which he said would 
make the law unconstitutionally broad, barring most movie theaters 
from showing R-rated movies and Broadway theaters from running shows 
with nudity. ``That means the testing of the entire constitutionality 
starts all over again,'' he said Another critic of the law, Norman 
Siegel, the executive director of the New York Civil Liberties Union, 
said the proposed change ``opens the door to additional legal and 
constitutional challenges.'' At first, Vallone said his revision would 
proceed even if the mayor's court appeal overturned Crane's decision. 
But later, Vallone's spokeswoman, Carolyn Daly, said the council was 
preparing the revision as a backup in case the court appeal failed. 
The mayor continued his attack Friday on Crane's decision. ``Common 
sense would dictate that an adult establishment that is involved in 
sexual activities does not become any better because children are 
brought in,'' he said.
