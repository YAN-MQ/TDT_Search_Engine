The urge to splurge wasn't what many department stores hoped it would 
be last month. Instead, discounters and specialty stores were much 
more successful in enticing shoppers. Susan Lisovicz reports. That 
perennial staple of casual wear, khakis, can be found anywhere. But 
only the gap has resurrected them as cool. The specialty store's appeal 
to a young, brand-conscious customer is credited with pushing the 
gap's sales up 18% in October at stores open at least a year. Meanwhile, 
discounters such as Wal-Mart are drawing another type of customer 
-- the bargain Hunter. Sales at the world's largest retailer grew 
nearly 8% in a month when the numbers at other large retailers, such 
as Sears and jcpenney, as well as department stores such as federated, 
the parent company of bloomingdale's and Macy's, were down. Colder 
weather is expected to help sales of winter apparel this month. But 
some analysts say that's only part of the equation. My bet is that 
70% of it is related to weather, and 30% of it is related to slowing 
off of an unsustainably high level of growth in the first half of 
this year. When it's all said and done, whether it's the second half 
of the year or the fourth quarter, I think we'll look back and say 
it was a good time. The first half of the year would be characterized 
as a great time. That slowdown in spending comes at a critical time 
for retailers, especially middle-of-the-road chains that have been 
squeezed by the success of specialty stores and discounters. Selection, 
inventory and price are likely to determine just what kind of holiday 
season they'll enjoy. Susan Lisovicz, "CNN Financial News," New York.
