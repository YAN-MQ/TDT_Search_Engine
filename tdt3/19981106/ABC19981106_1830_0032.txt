Good evening. We begin tonight with political evolution, the most 
well-connected sources in Washington tell us tonight that the most 
powerful man in Congress has decided to quit. Newt Gingrich, the speaker 
of the House of Representatives is expected to give up not only his 
speaker's job but will likely leave the Congress altogether. It is 
said one analyst, bizarre. Blut when Tuesday's election results were 
all in, the democrats had done better than virtually anyone had predicted. 
So as almost everyone did predict that very same night the republican 
members in the House of Representatives have turned on themselves. 
Here is ABC's Linda Douglass. The revolt began today when two congressmen 
-- first the chairman of the appropriations committee, Bob Livingston. 
I have come to announce my candidacy for speaker of the House of Representatives. 
Then Oklahoma congressman announced that he would try to oust the 
number two leader. On November 3rd, the republican party hit an iceberg. 
And I think the question that is before our conference today is whether 
we retain the crew of the "Titanic" or we look for some new leadership. 
The captain of the GOP ship inspires and infuriates its members. Many 
blame him for Tuesday's elections losses. And that he has given the 
party a snarling image. For example, when he vowed never to let go 
of the president's scandal. I will never again as long as I am speaker, 
make a speech without commenting on this topic. Some members also 
are fed up with the number two leader, Dick armey. Tuesday night he 
dared anyone to challenge him. Well, they're welcome to it if they're 
big enough to take it. By today, Armey's Tone had softened considerably 
he sent a letter to his colleagues conceding the election was a "wake 
up call." Newt Gingrich tried to line up support saying he is too 
eager to make deals with democrats. Livingston said that is what the 
party needs. There will now be a mad scramble to replace the speaker 
and leave the republican party just as republicans are trying to decide 
whether or not to impeach the president. It is a tumultuous time here, 
Peter. Thanks very much. Scramble indeed. A much blanker slate in 
the house now. Among republicans nobody knowing precisely who has 
the inside track to replace Mr. Gingrich.
