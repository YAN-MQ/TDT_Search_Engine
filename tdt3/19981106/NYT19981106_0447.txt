The sharp run-up in the stock market over the last month, which has 
returned the Dow Jones industrial average to within striking distance 
of the 9,000 level, has given almost every major stock group big gains. 
The major exception is utility stocks, which had climbed earlier with 
Treasury bonds as a refuge from global market uncertainty. The fears 
of a bear market that seemed so palpable in early October now seem 
almost forgotten. The U.S. economy continues to grow; the overseas 
turmoil, the market seems to have decided, will be contained. ``What 
they're celebrating is an absence of disaster,'' said Christine Callies, 
chief investment strategist at Credit Suisse First Boston. ``The consensus 
view had been entertaining something that was very close to a full-fledged 
recession. That's now unlikely to happen.'' Airlines were among the 
standout performers, soaring 37 percent in the period, benefiting 
from low oil prices, heavy bookings and reports of buoyant third-quarter 
profits. Stocks in money-center banks, battered through the summer 
from losses in emerging markets and then exposure to hedge funds, 
have rebounded 35.4 percent since Oct. 8, the day both the Dow industrials 
and the Standard &AMP; Poor's 500 hit their early-autumn lows. And 
auto shares advanced 33.3 percent in the period as sales proved remarkably 
resilient in the face of evidence that consumer confidence was declining. 
The volatile technology sector was another stellar performer, with 
the Philadelphia Semiconductor Index racing ahead by 45.3 percent. 
Intel climbed 1 7/16 Friday, to 95 7/16, hitting a record. Shares 
of capital goods companies climbed 24.3 percent, as gauged by a Standard 
&AMP; Poor's index, reflecting investor reassurance that the economy 
would continue to expand, analysts said. Caterpillar, which traded 
below 40 in late September, finished Friday at 49\. On the other hand, 
utility shares, outstanding defensive performers during the summer, 
slumped 4.4 percent during the last four weeks. Energy stocks fared 
a little better, with a 2.7 percent gain during this period. Friday's 
activity produced a gain for the Dow industrials of 59.99 points, 
or seven-tenths of 1 percent, bringing the index to 8,975.46. This 
left it 3.8 percent below the July 17 record of 9,337.97. Merck, up 
3, to 144 15/16, and accounting for 20 percent of the Dow's rise, 
led a powerful drug group, with Bristol-Myers Squibb, Eli Lilly and 
Schering-Plough also gaining more than two points each. The drug group 
is now up 18 percent since Oct. 8.
