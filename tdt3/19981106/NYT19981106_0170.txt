Low inflation, a driving force behind the nation's economic boom, 
is having the perverse effect of making life harder for millions of 
elderly Americans. That is because increases in Social Security payments 
are based on an inflation index _ the Consumer Price Index for Urban 
Wage Earners and Clerical Workers _ that may not accurately reflect 
their expenses. Based on that index, monthly Social Security payments 
will rise an average of 1.3 percent next year. But the costs that 
drain the resources of many retired people _ notably medical treatment, 
prescription drugs and special housing _ are rising faster than consumer 
prices in general. Neither the CPI-W, as the official index used to 
calculate Social Security payments is called, or the more widely known 
Consumer Price Index for urban consumers, designed to be an accurate 
reflector of living costs for 80 percent of the population, looks 
especially at needs of the elderly. Now the Bureau of Labor Statistics, 
which calculates the indexes, has devised an experimental index that 
does track some spending habits of older Americans, and it has shown 
a widening gap between cost increases for them and those for the general 
population. Between December 1982 and September 1998, the experimental 
index rose 73.9 percent while the official index rose 63.5 percent, 
said Patrick Jackman, an economist at the bureau. And as inflation 
keeps a lid on Social Security payments, it also reduces interest 
income from bonds and certificates of deposit, the mainstay of many 
Americans' nest eggs. To retired people, just a few dollars more or 
less a week can make a huge difference in life style. ``A lot of seniors 
skimp on prescription medications, or they don't eat well,'' said 
John Rother, director of legislation and public policy for the American 
Association of Retired Persons. ``But this is a hidden phenomenon. 
It's not being discussed.'' Josephine Sayward, a retired bookkeeper 
from Fall River, Mass., said she was cutting back on daily blood-pressure 
and cholesterol medications because Medicare doesn't cover the cost 
of prescription drugs. ``If I take all my prescriptions, it costs 
over $250 a month,'' said Mrs. Sayward, whose retirement benefits 
are about $12,400 a year, most of it from Social Security and the 
rest from a small pension. ``I told my doctor I'm going off several 
drugs because I can't afford to buy them.'' The 1999 increase in Social 
Security payments, the smallest rise in 12 years, will average about 
$10 a month, raising the average check for the nation's 44 million 
beneficiaries to $780 a month. But some costs for the elderly are 
often rising faster. Monthly premiums deducted from Social Security 
checks for Medicare coverage of doctors' office visits will rise by 
3.9 percent, or $1.70, to $45.50, in 1999. And many prescription drug 
prices and deductibles for hospital stays are climbing rapidly, while 
more health maintenance organizations are cutting off Medicare beneficiaries. 
The experimental index now being calculated by the statistics bureau 
is really only a tweaking of the official index, and statisticians 
say it is subject to more sampling errors. There has been talk, mostly 
from the AARP but also from some members of Congress, of coming up 
with a well-designed and more accurate index for calculating Social 
Security cost-of-living increases. But no one in Congress is actively 
pushing for the change, Rother said. Jackman of the statistics bureau 
said adjusting the payments according to a more accurate index could 
end up costing the government $40 million a year. The official index 
``is understating the true rate of inflation for the elderly,'' said 
Dean Baker, an economist at the Economic Policy Institute, an independent 
research organization in Washington, and the disparity is likely to 
get worse over time. But Baker, the author of ``Getting Prices Right: 
The Battle Over the Consumer Price Index'' (Economic Policy Institute, 
1997), said older people's higher spending for some goods and services 
was not the only reason. The official index also considers price declines 
for consumer goods that they rarely buy, like television sets and 
computers. While Congress balks at the cost, he added, a separate 
CPI for the elderly ``would be the way to go'' to correct the problem. 
Mrs. Sayward said higher medical costs would wipe out her cost-of-living 
increase for next year, which she derided as ``so slight, it's almost 
insignificant.'' Still, she was quick to point out that she's better 
off than many other people. She considers herself in pretty good health, 
and she owns the small two-bedroom house where she has lived for 45 
years. A widow since 1978, she has four grown children she can call 
for help in an emergency, though she doesn't want to resort to that. 
``They all have kids,'' she said. ``Five are in college, and there 
are three more to go.'' So she skimps where she can to save for unexpected 
costs. A recent ear infection required antibiotic drops that cost 
$28 for a week's supply, she said, not including the $5 she paid to 
see a doctor to get the prescription. ``That's my food budget,'' she 
said. ``Does that mean I don't eat that week?'' She won't even think 
about buying new furniture or appliances. She fills her free time 
largely doing volunteer work. ``That becomes my entertainment,'' she 
said. Yet she is not about to take up the advice of Rother, who urges 
older people who are in need to apply for food stamps, low-income 
energy assistance, Supplemental Security Income and senior housing. 
``I've never asked for charity, and I really don't want to start now,'' 
Mrs. Sayward said. She feels that her Social Security payments should 
meet her needs. ``I think my country owes me what it promised: to 
take care of my health needs, to keep a roof over my head and to put 
food in my belly,'' she said. ``If there ever comes a time when I 
can't pay my way, I hope they legalize euthanasia.''
