The United States and Russia signed an agreement Friday for 3.1 million 
tons of U.S. food aid to help see Russia through the long winter. 
``Our common cause has been fulfilled,'' Deputy Prime Minister Gennady 
Kulik said after the talks ended Friday, the Interfax news agency 
reported. A U.S. Embassy spokeswoman, speaking on condition of anonymity, 
confirmed that an agreement had been reached. Russian officials said 
the talks had stalled for a time over American worries about possible 
corruption, and demands for strict guidelines on how the food is distributed. 
Those concerns forestalled an agreement Thursday and pushed the negotations 
into a final, long day. Some of the U.S. guidelines were ``utterly 
unacceptable to Russia,'' Vladimir Scherbak, the first deputy agriculture 
minister, told Interfax. Kulik, who headed the Russian delegation, 
said Russia had agreed to U.S. demands that the food aid be exempt 
from taxes and import duties at the border, Interfax said. He said 
the issue of taxation within Russia would be worked out later. The 
Americans also insisted that profits from food aid sold by the Russian 
government go to the country's Pension Fund, which is chronically 
short of cash. As a result, many retirees have to wait months to receive 
their pension money. Kulik said that issue had been resolved. ``We 
are ready to give (the money) to the Pension Fund and spend it on 
social programs,'' he was quoted as saying by Interfax. In another 
development, Russian Prime Minister Yevgeny Primakov discussed possible 
humanitarian aid with a European Commission delegation. The talks 
were described as preliminary and no details were announced. Russia's 
economic crisis, along with shrinking food imports and the worst grain 
harvest in 40 years, has raised concerns about possible food shortages. 
The State Statistics Committee reported Friday that grain production 
had been tentatively measured at 51.5 million tons this year, down 
45 percent from 1997, Interfax said. Previously, the government had 
said 55 million tons had been harvested this year. Store shelves remain 
well-stocked, but food prices have risen sharply in recent months 
and poor Russians may not be able to afford what's available. Under 
the aid plan, about half the U.S. food would be provided for free. 
The other half would be sold to Russia for around dlrs 500 million 
under a 20-year loan. The shipments would include wheat, corn, soybeans, 
meat and produce. This is the first time in years that the Russians 
have had to look abroad for significant food aid. The United States 
provided food aid in the early 1990s after the collapse of the Soviet 
Union.
