When we come back, what happens to a rose in zero gravity? Hi, pumpkin. 
It's late. You should be asleep. Mommy said that I could stay up until 
you got home. - oh. - What are you eating? - Cheerios. - For dinner? 
They taste just as good at night. And remember, I told you they were 
good for my cholesterol. Oh, yeah. An important new study shows... 
that three cups of cheerios whole grain oats a day, added to a low 
fat diet, can help push your cholesterol down. Do you know what else 
is good for my heart? - uh-uh. - a hug from you. The one and only 
cheerios movies... have taken us places beyond our imagination. Now 
you can take those movies to places you never thought possible. Introducing 
the silhouette premiere from Oldsmobile. The first minivan with a 
video entertainment system built right in. It gives motion pictures 
a whole new meaning. The... only from Oldsmobile.
