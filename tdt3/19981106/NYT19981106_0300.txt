The dusty stalls and roadside shops are open until late afternoon 
now, and people are less afraid to wander out after dark. But learning 
to live with the second rebellion here in two years is not the same 
as loving it, as Gilbert Kombi, an unemployed cabdriver, bluntly pointed 
out. ``The troops who are soldiers in this rebellion are corrupt,'' 
he said the other day. ``In reality this is a foreigners' movement.'' 
Kombi's suspicion of foreign influence _ that the insurrection is 
led by Rwanda and Uganda _ is widespread in Goma, the rebels' home 
base. But it only partly explains what the leaders of the three-month-old 
uprising against President Laurent Kabila acknowledge is one of their 
highest hurdles: despite recent military victories, they are not popular 
here. The mood is much different from last year, when Kabila's forces 
marched from this eastern city across the country to Kinshasa, the 
capital, and were greeted by crowds jubilant at ending 32 years of 
dictatorship under Mobutu Sese Seko. This time people express skepticism, 
war-weariness and outright hostility at another rebellion when the 
last one, many Congolese say, produced so little to improve their 
lives. ``It is true that people have received the war with reservations,'' 
said Lunda Bululu, a prime minister when this country was called Zaire 
and now a top rebel in the year-old state of Congo. Other rebel leaders 
are equally, perhaps surprisingly, frank, even as they say the public 
will soon embrace their vision for rebuilding Congo. But people around 
Goma show few signs of appreciating their honesty. ``There was a first 
liberation,'' said a 21-year-old woman, a law student at the Free 
University for the Great Lakes Countries, who would not give her name 
for fear of reprisals from rebel soldiers. ``Two years later there 
is a second liberation.'' ``I'm wondering,'' she asked, ``they are 
coming to liberate who and why?'' The war that began in early August 
is only the most recent violence in the area around Goma, a city nestled 
between Lake Kivu and a rumbling volcano, which is equal parts beautiful 
and tumultuous. In 1991 Mobutu's soldiers looted the city. Three years 
later hundreds of thousands of Rwandan Hutu, some leaders of the massacres 
of their Tutsi countrymen, fled Rwanda and filled refugee camps north 
of the city. Then in 1996 the Tutsi-led government of Rwanda attacked 
the camps, setting in motion a rebellion led by Tutsi soldiers allied 
with Kabila. That past helps explain the present: Kabila, who purged 
the Tutsi from Congo's leadership after he took power last year, has 
now cast this rebellion as a Tutsi invasion from Rwanda and Uganda. 
The rebels accuse Kabila of stirring the ethnic hatred that many Congolese 
feel for the Tutsi. At minimum, Kabila seems to have tapped a vein 
of nationalism that has bolstered the public's own tepid feelings 
about him. Kombi, the cabdriver, said he liked Kabila, not so much 
for what he had accomplished, but ``because he is Congolese, like 
me.'' There has been no fighting here except a brief attack in September 
by Hutu militiamen allied with Kabila. But residents say hardship 
shows itself everywhere. For the rich, it became impossible until 
the last few days to make international phone calls. Commercial airline 
service stopped. For the masses in the city of 300,000 people _ perhaps 
10 percent of whom are refugees from the fighting _ it has become 
dangerous to travel too far out of Goma. The only way to get messages 
to families in Kinshasa is through the International Committee of 
the Red Cross, and every morning at 8 a.m. people line up to write 
brief, censored letters across the lines. Life is more expensive. 
Gasoline went from $2.25 a gallon to more than $3. The produce at 
a market in the town center is sparse and expensive. Rotten tomatoes 
are sold at one table because, the vendor said, it is too dicey to 
bring fresh produce from the countryside. One 38-year-old shopper 
held a bag stuffed with two cabbages that he said cost triple the 
usual price. ``I don't even like vegetables,'' the man said. ``If 
I had more money, I would buy meat.'' The man said he was afraid to 
give his name, as were most people interviewed here _ many of whom 
said they knew of kidnappings and cases of intimidation by the young, 
well-armed soldiers stationed around the city. The rebel leaders have 
acknowledged what they say are isolated kidnappings, which they say 
they neither knew about nor condoned. In an interview, the rebels' 
military commander, Jean-Pierre Ondekane, made a point of saying soldiers 
who misbehaved would be dealt with severely. ``My soldiers know if 
they rape or loot they will be killed,'' Ondekane said. Rebel leaders 
say that for the moment the lack of public support has not hindered 
their military drive. They have claimed a string of victories in the 
last several weeks in the country's east and say they have broader 
support outside Goma's region, Kivu, which is particularly divided 
among ethnic lines. They also boast of not having to put down any 
uprisings in the towns they hold. But they say they have much work 
to do to convince people. They have held many meetings with tribal 
leaders, students and other groups, and they say people will soon 
come around, especially if they continue to win territory. Their pitch 
is simple: that Kabila did not deliver the democracy he promised. 
``After two years he has done as much bad as Mobutu,'' said Bululu, 
one of the rebel leaders. ``That we must explain.'' Patrick Motindo, 
28, a student from Kinshasa, said he had attended one of those meetings 
and was won over. ``We need democracy,'' he said. ``Mobutu was a dictator. 
We don't need another dictator.'' He even signed up to help spread 
the word, but quit not long afterward, when he realized he could not 
afford to stay in Goma these days unless he was paid. ``I'm sorry 
to say that,'' Motindo said. ``If you are doing something for your 
country you shouldn't do it for money. But it is very hard.''
