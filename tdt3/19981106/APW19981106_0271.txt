The Eiffel Tower, closed to a disappointed public for a week due to 
a strike, reopened Friday after management agreed to workers' demands 
to hire more staff. Some 200 workers at the Eiffel Tower had been 
demanding more personnel, rejecting as insufficient the recent hiring 
of 20 people, with plans to recruit five more workers next year. Management 
on Thursday evening accepted workers' demands to accelerate the hiring 
of seven new employees, the press office said. The strike, which began 
last Friday, cost the Eiffel Tower an estimated 300,000 francs (dlrs 
55,000) per day. November is a slack period for tourists. Some 310,000 
people visited the Eiffel Tower in November 1997, compared to 850,000 
visitors in August.
