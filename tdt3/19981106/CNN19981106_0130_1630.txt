60 years ago, an Ohio couple planted a Christmas tree in their yard. 
Now 73 feet tall, that tree is heading to the big apple as the centerpiece 
of the Christmas display at Rockefeller center. The tree weighs seven 
tons and will be flown to New York on Wednesday. Not to be outdone, 
California has a 115-foot Christmas tree believed to be the largest 
on display this year. Thursday, it was lifted into place in fashion 
island and spruced up with some extra branches.
