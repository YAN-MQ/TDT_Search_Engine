The American automobile association is setting up its own speed trap. 
But it's only a test. The nation's largest auto club will paint a 
series of 90 stripes across the highway leading into waldo, Florida. 
Each strip will be spaced slightly closer than the previous one. And 
that should give drivers the illusion they're speeding up. Aaa hopes 
motorists will slow down and avoid speeding tickets.
