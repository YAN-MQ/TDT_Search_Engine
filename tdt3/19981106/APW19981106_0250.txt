Police near this southern French port have banned the sale of shellfish 
possibly contaminated by a rare toxic algae, dealing a blow to oyster 
and mussel producers before their busiest season. Traces of the algae, 
which is fatal if ingested, were discovered Thursday evening in shellfish 
as well as in the Thau lagoon, according to the French Ocean Research 
Institute (IFREMER). Scientists conducted tests for the algae after 
shellfish were banned for the first time in early October, when abnormalities 
were first discovered in the lagoon. Specialists, who are conducting 
further tests, said they don't yet know the origin of the algae or 
if it will disappear naturally. Shellfish, including oysters and mussels, 
are traditional French fare for the Christmas and New Year's holidays.
