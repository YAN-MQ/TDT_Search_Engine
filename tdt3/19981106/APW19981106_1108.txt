HELSINKI, Finland (AP) -- Alexander Barkov had one goal and one assist 
as Russia snapped Sweden's 21-game unbeaten streak in international 
hockey with a 4-1 victory in the Karjala Cup tournament Friday. The 
Swedes' streak started when they won the World Championships in Switzerland 
in May. They tied the Czech Republic 2-2 in the Karjala Cup opener 
Thursday. Alexander Prokopiev, Vladimir Samylin and Pavel Agarkov 
scored the other goals for Russia. Anders Huusko scored for Sweden, 
tying the score 1-1 in the first period. The Russians prevailed despite 
being outshot 32-15, including 17-1 in the final period. The tournament 
is the second in the European Hockey Tour. Sweden won the first tournament 
in the Czech Republic two months ago and leads the overall standings 
with five points, one ahead of Finland. Finland, which edged Russia 
3-2 in Thursday's opener, face the Czech Republic on Saturday.
