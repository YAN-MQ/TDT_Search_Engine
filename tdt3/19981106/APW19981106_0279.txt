Tajik government and former opposition groups joined forces Friday 
to combat a maverick warlord who has threatened to blow up a dam and 
flood huge territories in Central Asia. Government troops and their 
new allies have retaken control of the northern city of Khodzhand, 
but were still facing some pockets of residence in mountainous northern 
Tajikistan, officials said. The rebel leader, former army Col. Makhmud 
Khudoberdyev, has demanded that President Emomali Rakhmonov free all 
political prisoners and bring his supporters to the government. Rakhmonov 
firmly ruled out any talks with the rebels, saying the government 
will destroy or capture them all. The government has already captured 
about 100 prisoners, the president said on Tajik television. According 
to the government's estimates, more than 100 people have died in the 
fighting that has raged since Wednesday, when the rebels raided Khdozhand, 
the city 200 kilometers (125 miles) north of the capital, Dushanbe. 
The government started gaining the upper hand Thursday, but Khudoberdyev 
said his guerrillas had mined the dam on the Kairakkhum channel as 
a ``deterrence measure.'' ``It will flood vast territories of Central 
Asia,'' Khudoberdyev warned in a statement received by the ITAR-Tass 
news agency. The dam he threatened to destroy holds a reservoir so 
large it is referred to locally as a ``sea.'' Rakhmonov dismissed 
the threat, saying that the government forces were protecting the 
dam. The fighting this week has been one of the most serious outbursts 
of violence since a peace accord was signed last year, ending five 
years of civil war in the small, impoverished Central Asian nation. 
During the war, the secular government battled a mostly Muslim opposition. 
But the main opposition groups are now participating in the government 
and the armed forces, and were taking part this week in the operation 
against the renegade ex-colonel. Speaking on national television Friday, 
the country's Constitution Day, Rakhmonov said the old opposition 
had agreed to help the government crush the new rebellion. ``No one 
will be able to thwart the peace process,'' Rakhmonov said in a television 
address. He said that the government again held Khodzhand and its 
airport, allowing reinforcements to be brought to the region quickly. 
However, some rebels continued their resistance in an ancient fortress 
in the city, Rakhmonov said. Tajik Defense Minister Sherali Khairuloyev 
said Friday that the rebels had driven some 90 civilian hostages to 
the fortress and threatened to shoot them in case of a government 
attack, the Interfax news agency reported. The rebels did blow up 
a bridge on a strategic highway linking Dushanbe with northern regions 
to prevent the government from sending in more troops by land, Rakhmonov 
said.
