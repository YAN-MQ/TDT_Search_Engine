Iranian Foreign Minister Kamal Kharrazi arrived in this Red Sea port 
Friday for talks aimed at enhancing the recently improved relations 
between Iran and Saudi Arabia. Saudi officials said that during his 
two-day visit, Kharrazi will discuss regional development and cooperation 
with his counterpart, Saud al-Faisal. Kharrazi will also discuss plans 
for a visit by Iran's first deputy president to the kingdom, the officials 
said on condition of anonymity. No date has been disclosed for the 
visit. Saudi Arabia used to be extremely wary of Iran owing to Tehran's 
stated policy of exporting its Islamic revolution. The kingdom, a 
Sunni Muslim state, also disapproved of citizens from Iran, a Shiite 
Muslim state, holding demonstrations during the annual pilgrimage 
to Mecca. But relations began to improve after Iran's President Mohammad 
Khatami, a political moderate, took office last year. The ties received 
a boost in February when Iran's former president, Hashemi Rafsanjani, 
visited the kingdom. In May, the two countries signed a wide-ranging 
agreement on trade, exchanges of academics and students, and technological 
cooperation.
