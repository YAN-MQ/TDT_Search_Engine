Back in this country, it was a big finish for the week on Wall Street. 
And when we come back, NBC news "in depth" -- the hottest star in 
politics. Can Jesse Ventura really put mind over body? Raisin bran, 
huh? Uh, yeah. What's goin' on? That raisin bran has less than half 
your folic acid for the day. Even less of your zinc. That's a weenie 
breakfast, Frank. There's almost no vitamin E at all. Looks like you 
need total raisin bran. Just one bowl gives you 100% of ten important 
vitamins and minerals you need for the day. No other raisin bran comes 
close. That a boy, Frank! And there's room for my spoon. Total. Total 
raisin bran. Total corn flakes. What are you getting for breakfast? 
My dad always said: as soon as I get a computer you'll come out with 
something better. So, to make sure people like dad have the latest 
computer we invented your:)ware-- technology that grows with you. 
For just $49.95 a month you can buy a computer with an Intel Pentium 
II processor Internet access and in two years you can trade it in 
towards the purchase of a new one. What do you call this thing? Your:)ware. 
Call 1-800-gateway and let's talk about your:)ware. There is an athlete 
amongst us disguised as a mother and a Neighbor. And when most of 
us are still sleeping, she's running. She also takes the vitamins, 
minerals, antioxidants, and folic acid in women's ultra mega multivitamins 
made by general nutrition centers. Tomorrow, she'll get up and run 
some more. Women's ultra mega multivitamins, made exclusively by gnc. 
Live strong. Live well.
