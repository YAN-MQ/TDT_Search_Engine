Hello, everyone, and welcome to Science World. I'm Brian Sislack. 
Anyone who watches crime dramas on TV or, for that matter, news reports 
of the real thing knows how DNA evidence from the scene of a crime 
can help identify the perpetrators. The same is true when their suspected 
bad guy is a bacterium. A team of researchers from Rockefeller University 
and the Public Health Research Institute has used DNA fingerprinting 
to track antibiotic-resistant staph bacteria through 12 New York City 
area hospitals. The suspect in question, methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus 
aureus, is a common and potentially lethal hospital-acquired infection. 
Writing in "Journal of Infectious Diseases," the researchers describe 
isolating four distinct subtypes of the Staph bacterium. One was identified 
in all 12 of the hospitals being studied, and was responsible for 
over 40 percent of the methicillin-resistant staph infections. The 
other three types were much more localized. By breaking a group of 
infectious organisms down into subtypes, genetic fingerprinting allows 
investigators to track their movements more efficiently and determine 
which subtypes are the most resistant to conventional treatments. 
What's more, the genetic profiles of the most lethal bacterial subtypes 
could be used to identify the organism's weak spots as targets for 
promising new drugs.
