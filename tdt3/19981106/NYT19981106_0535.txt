If the Yankees are concerned about Bernie Williams showing up in center 
field at Fenway Park next season _ wearing the home uniform _ they 
should not breathe a sigh of relief just because the Red Sox re-signed 
their own center fielder, Darren Lewis. The Red Sox and the Colorado 
Rockies, a baseball lawyer suggested yesterday, are playing a game 
of misdirection. Both re-signed their free-agent center fielders _ 
Lewis with Boston, Darryl Hamilton with Colorado _ but both remain 
interested in Williams. The Los Angeles Dodgers do not. After talking 
about Williams only the day before, Kevin Malone, the Dodgers' general 
manager, went out and signed center fielder Devon White yesterday 
to a three-year, $12.4 million contract. White, six years older than 
the 30-year-old Williams, was the first free agent to sign following 
the filing period. Acknowledging that center field was a hole in the 
Dodgers' lineup, Malone had said it was logical for them to pursue 
Williams as they focused on the high-profile free agents. ``But,'' 
he added, ``we also have other directions we can go concerning other 
free agents who aren't as high profile as the big four.'' White, with 
a .279 batting average and 85 runs batted in, was the Arizona Diamondbacks' 
top hitter last season after the Florida Marlins traded him to Arizona 
as part of their payroll purge. He had signed with the Marlins as 
a free agent in 1995, receiving $9.9 million for three years. He is 
three years older, but his new contract with the Dodgers is better 
than that one was. The Yankees remain interested in Williams, but 
another day went by without an offer emanating from Yankee Stadium. 
George Steinbrenner obviously is not prepared to make one yet. ``Scott 
and I had a conversation, a lengthy one, but I have not made an offer,'' 
Yankee General Manager Brian Cashman said, referring to Williams' 
agent, Scott Boras. Cashman and Boras also talked about Kevin Brown, 
one of the two best pitchers in the free-agent market, but the Yankees 
did not make Brown an offer either. At first glance, it appeared the 
Red Sox and the Rockies had abandoned thoughts of going after Williams. 
The Red Sox signed Lewis to a three-year, $7 million contract, and 
the Rockies retained Hamilton with a three-year, $10.5 million contract. 
But both center fielders, who had filed for free agency, agreed to 
new contracts on Thursday, the final day of the 15-day filing period. 
Their signing before the end of the period means they do not fall 
under the trade restrictions that clubs face with free agents who 
sign after the period. A free agent who signs from yesterday on cannot 
be traded without his consent until June 16. If the Red Sox or the 
Rockies should sign Williams, they could trade Lewis or Hamilton without 
his approval. By signing their own players, the baseball lawyer said, 
the clubs gave themselves flexibility. ``If they don't get the premier 
center fielder,'' he said, ``they are protected.'' Boras said some 
clubs made offers for Williams and Brown on Friday, but he declined 
to identify the teams or discuss their offers. ``I'll just say there 
were no surprises about where the market is for either player,'' Boras 
said. Boras had previously said he wanted seven years for Williams, 
six for Brown, with Williams' money exceeding Mike Piazza's $91 million, 
and Brown's money exceeding Pedro Martinez's $75 million. Boras said 
he received one surprise Friday but again declined to name the team 
or even the player the team called about. ``You get calls sometimes 
that you didn't anticipate getting,'' he said. The Yankees want to 
protect themselves in case they do not sign Williams, which is why 
Cashman spoke Friday with Jim Turner, Brian Jordan's agent. ``I tried 
to touch base with a number of agents,'' Cashman said. ``I tried to 
get a little clearer picture of what their interests and dollar expectations 
are.'' Jordan, late of the St. Louis Cardinals, also has attracted 
the Mets' attention. He is a productive hitter (.316, 25 home runs, 
91 runs batted in) who will not cost nearly as much as Williams. After 
speaking with Cashman, Turner said: ``They are not prepared to make 
a proposal now and wanted me to know that. We talked about the overall 
picture. I gather that they are going to hold off on talking seriously 
to anyone else until they make overtures to their own guy.'' Turner 
said he had not heard recently from Steve Phillips, the Mets' general 
manager, but had received a request for information from Phillips' 
office Thursday. INSIDE PITCH One of RANDY JOHNSON's agents, ALAN 
NERO, said Friday that the free-agent pitcher had planned to visit 
New York but now might ask GEORGE STEINBRENNER to visit Johnson at 
his home in the Phoenix area. ``This process is starting to get lengthy 
and wearisome, so we're considering that maybe, in the interest of 
time, it makes sense for the Yankees to come out and visit Randy,'' 
Nero said. Johnson planned to visit the Los Angeles Dodgers and the 
Anaheim Angels in the next couple of weeks, Nero said.
