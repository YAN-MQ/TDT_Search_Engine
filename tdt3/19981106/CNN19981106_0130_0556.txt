The national hurricane center in Miami says hurricane Mitch was the 
most fatal atlantic ocean storm in more than 200 years. Assistance 
is now pouring into central America from Mexico, and help from the 
United States and European countries is on the way. The search continues 
for 13,000 people believed to be missing since the storm blew ashore. 
At least 11,000 deaths are blamed on Mitch. Lucia Newman has more 
on the situation in Honduras. In Comayagua, as in so many parts of 
Honduras, people struggle to salvage whatever they can of their possessions 
in neighborhoods that no longer exist. This mother of six, who lost 
everything, is looking for food, but too weary now to keep walking. 
"I left the other four children behind," she says, "and I could only 
take the small ones with me to see if I can find some help." The desperation 
is everywhere. What you can't see is the stench of death, which is 
nearly unbearable here -- The precarious sanitary conditions in Honduras 
right now are raising the serious danger of diseases, of an outbreak 
of epidemics, such as cholera. As the waters recede, more and more 
victims are being found. There's no longer room in the morgue for 
so many bodies, so those whose relatives can't even afford a simple 
wooden casket are being buried in mass graves. In the capital, people 
line up from 5:00 in the morning for water, water which is contaminated 
because both sewage and drinking water pipes are broken, another major 
sanitary nightmare. "We're surrounded by mud, waste an contaminated 
water. Although authorities are doing what they can, this is going 
to cause epidemics," says the president of Honduras' red cross. The 
capital, meanwhile, remains cut off. This big trench severs the city's 
critical lifeline to the north. While workers labored 'round the clock 
to repair the road, nearby, hundreds of people formed a human chain 
to bring to the city the first supplies of produce, like these onions. 
"It's taken us five days to get here," says this man. And it's not 
just supplies that have been cut off since Mitch hit Honduras nearly 
two weeks ago, but people, too. This old woman, who'd been stranded 
in the capital, braved the treacherous path across the ravine to reach 
her town. "I am going home," she says, a home that she isn't even 
sure she'll find once she gets there. Lucia Newman, CNN, Comayagua, 
Honduras.
