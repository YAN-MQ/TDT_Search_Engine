Sources tell CNN, house speaker Newt Gingrich has not decided when 
he will leave Congress, but he has decided to resign. In a conference 
call this evening, Gingrich reportedly told his associates he didn't 
want to become an excuse for "cannibalism" within the republican party 
in the wake of party losses in this week's elections. Gingrich later 
issued a statement that read, in part -- Gingrich's aides say the 
decision was not made lightly. He decided that as a matter of principle, 
to keep the party together for the things he believed in, because 
he believes in the republican party and the country and the causes 
he believes in, that this was a matter of due city and he should step 
aside.
