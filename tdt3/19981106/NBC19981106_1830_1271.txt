Now to the efforts to help the devastated survivors of hurricane Mitch 
in central America. Relief supplies are pouring in from a half dozen 
countries, including $70 million in aid and equipment from the U.S. 
but there is tremendous frustration because the roads and bridges 
needed to move supplies to starving refugees are gone, almost all 
of them wiped out by floods and mudslides.
