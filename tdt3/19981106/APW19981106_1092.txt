Magnus Larsson, a potential entry for defending champion Sweden in 
the Davis Cup finals against Italy next month, underwent successful 
surgery in his right wrist Friday and will be sidelined at least three 
months. Larsson, 28, a former top 10 player, will also miss next week's 
Stockholm Open, one of the oldest indoor tournaments in the world, 
and the Australian Open in January. ``Three months is a long time, 
but I think Magnus will be hungry to play competively again in February,'' 
said his coach Carl-Axel Hageskog, who also is Sweden's Davis Cup 
coach. Larsson, ranked 37th in the world, was injured in the quarterfinals 
against Germany at Halle, Germany, in July. A quarterfinalist in the 
U.S. Open this year, Larsson has been plagued by injuries throughout 
his career. In 1995, after breaking into the top 10 for the first 
time, he broke his right foot and didn't return until late October. 
Sweden shut out the United States 5-0 in last year's final in Goteborg, 
Sweden. This year's final against Italy will be played in Milan Dec. 
4-6.
