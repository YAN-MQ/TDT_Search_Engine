A new United Nations report described what it calls "horrifying" human 
rights abuses by Taliban soldiers in Afghanistan. The report says 
Taliban forces captured the northern city of Mazari Sharif in August. 
Taliban soldiers went on a killing frenzy against minority Shi'ites. 
The report says as many as 8,000 people, including babies, were murdered. 
The author was unable to get into Afghanistan but says he based his 
account on reliable sources. The Taliban calls the report "imodinary" 
and an insult to Islam.
