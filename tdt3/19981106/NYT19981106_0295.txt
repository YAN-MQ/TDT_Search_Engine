For contemporary historians, Thomas Jefferson has always been an enigma, 
and the new DNA evidence that he fathered at least one child by his 
young slave Sally Hemings simply deepens the mystery of the man. On 
the one hand, Jefferson was the author of some of the most glorious 
sentences in the English language, his ringing affirmation of the 
equality of all men in the Declaration of Independence. On the other, 
he was a slaveholder who wrote some of the vilest sentiments of racism 
in his only book, ``Notes on the State of Virginia,'' published in 
1785. Blacks, Jefferson wrote, have ``a very strong and disagreeable 
odor,'' they are incapable of uttering more than ``a plain narration.'' 
Jefferson also said that racial amalgamation ``produces a degradation 
. . . to which no one can innocently consent.'' Most historians now 
believe that his relationship with Hemings probably endured for many 
years, if not from 1787, when Hemings, then 13 or 14, arrived in Paris 
as a ``nurse'' to Jefferson's daughter. Now that the new evidence 
is in, how can the inconsistencies in Jefferson's character be explained? 
The ability to overlook the contradictions in his own behavior was 
at the core of Jefferson's personality, and his relationship with 
Hemings was only one of many inconsistencies in his character, Annette 
Gordon-Reed, a law professor at New York Law School, contends in her 
book ``Thomas Jefferson and Sally Hemings: An American Controversy.'' 
Jefferson was a republican, an anti-monarchist who saw himself as 
a man of the people, yet he lived luxuriously, with a silver trimmed 
carriage, entertaining lavishly at Monticello. He made his slaves 
skilled craftsmen but said they could not be freed because they were 
basically children. Jefferson's behavior, Ms. Gordon-Reed said, was 
consistent with the essential rationalizations of slavery. Black women 
were seen as animals, but slave owners gave them their children to 
suckle and had sex with them. Black men were seen as infantile, but 
they were also seen as sexual predators, she said. ``He plays hide-and-seek 
within himself,'' Joseph J. Ellis, perhaps the best known of contemporary 
Jefferson scholars, said this week when the DNA evidence was revealed. 
During his lifetime, there were rumors, including a public accusation 
by a journalist, James Callender, that he was having relations with 
a slave woman. Jefferson denied it only once, indirectly. As for ``Notes 
on the State of Virginia,'' it was written before his relationship 
with Hemings seems to have begun. After it apparently commenced, Jefferson 
grew quieter on the subject of racial mixing, though he did speak 
out against it toward the end of his life. In his book ``American 
Sphinx: The Character of Thomas Jefferson,'' Ellis went to some lengths 
to deny that Jefferson could have had a sexual relationship with Hemings. 
And so have most Jefferson scholars, including Dumas Malone, the author 
of a six-volume biography of Jefferson, and Garry Wills, the author 
of ``Inventing America: Jefferson's Declaration of Independence.'' 
Jefferson has always been a kind of American god, one of the three 
figures, including Lincoln and Washington, whom Malone called ``our 
trinity of immortals.'' And as gods sometimes are, he has been imagined 
as sexless. In ``American Sphinx,'' Ellis said that for most of his 
adult life Jefferson was unable to express his sexual energies. He 
cited a contemporary description of Jefferson as somewhat effeminate. 
But Ellis' view of Jefferson's sexuality overlooks the fact that Jefferson's 
wife, Martha, was almost constantly pregnant during their marriage. 
As for Hemings, Wills said that many men ``use prostitutes and use 
women,'' adding, ``There is no evidence he cherished her.'' The assertion 
that Jefferson's relationship with Hemings was probably one of long 
standing has in the past been left to two historians who are women, 
the late Fawn Brodie in her book ``Thomas Jefferson: An Intimate History'' 
and Ms. Gordon-Reed. But how could Jefferson have sustained a relationship 
with Hemings that may have lasted for 38 years if he thought that 
black people smelled, that they were stupid and childlike? ``In general, 
in order to retain someone in slavery, you have to dehumanize them,'' 
said Edmund Morgan, author of ``American Slavery, American Freedom: 
the Ordeal of Colonial Virginia.'' ``It was a standard thing that 
went with slavery.'' Jefferson was also surrounded by examples of 
sexual relationships between masters and slaves. He had witnessed 
the relationships of two men he deeply admired, his father-in-law, 
John Wayles, and his law professor, George Wythe, with slave women. 
Another reason Jefferson may have been able to reconcile his relationship 
with Hemings with his opposition to miscegenation, Ms. Gordon-Reed 
points out in her book, was that Hemings was his wife's half sister, 
the daughter of John Wayles and his slave consort. Jefferson had been 
devastated by his wife's death, and he had promised her he would never 
remarry. Perhaps Hemings, who was known to be beautiful, bore some 
of his wife's characteristics. But perhaps most important, Hemings, 
under Jefferson's notions of race mixing, may have been in some way 
``white'' in his eyes. Indeed, in the 1830 census of Monticello, Hemings 
was listed as white. Jefferson also believed that blacks became ``white'' 
when they had a certain amount of white blood in them, a theory he 
illustrated once in a complex mathematical chart drawn up in a letter 
to a friend. ``Let `h' and `e' cohabit,'' Jefferson wrote, and ``the 
half of the blood of each will be q/2 plus e/2 plus a/8 plus A/8 . 
. .'' He concluded that the more white blood they had, the more ``the 
improvement of the blacks in body and mind.'' Jefferson's attitude 
toward slaves bore some similarities to his attitude toward women. 
``He was very paternalistic; he grouped women and slaves together 
as people who should be protected,'' Ms. Gordon-Reed said. But if 
Jefferson cared for Hemings sufficiently to have a relationship with 
her that endured for decades, why did he not free her? Indeed, as 
the author of the Declaration of Independence, as one who spoke publicly 
about the abominations of slavery, why did Jefferson not free all 
his slaves? One reason may have been the lavish life style he led, 
which depended on his slaves. ``It was more important for him to live 
the way he did than to deny himself much,'' Morgan said. Wills agrees, 
saying, ``He was running up his life style, so he had to take it out 
on his slaves.'' ``Jefferson dwelt in a fantasy world,'' Ms. Brodie 
wrote. He was willing to ignore contradictions between his own life 
and his idea of a just world. To have faced the contradictions in 
his own behavior would have served to destroy his confidence in his 
own destiny as a moral leader of men. It may be that in the end, the 
contradictions within Jefferson the man were paradigmatic of the contradictions 
within slavery itself, contradictions that eventually broke the system 
apart. ``I've been thinking about the symbolism of it,'' Jan Lewis, 
a professor of history at Rutgers University in Newark, N.J., and 
the author of ``Pursuit of Happiness: Family and Values in Jefferson's 
Virginia,'' said this week, ``of the fact that blacks and whites are 
the same family, and of the cost to the country of denying our familial 
relationships; of not understanding, of not being able to claim each 
other as kin, biologically and figuratively. Clinton talks about the 
national conversation about race. My first thought now is the conversation 
may begin now that we have a place to start.''
