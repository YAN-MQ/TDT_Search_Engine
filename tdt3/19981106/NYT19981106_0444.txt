An exchange many viewers probably never expected to hear from the 
likes of Meredith Vieira and Barbara Walters occurred the other day 
on network television. Ms. Vieira, a former ``60 Minutes'' correspondent, 
described how her husband used computer lingo when they were having 
sex. Ms. Walters, far from being tipped off-balance, came back with 
an Internet double entendre of her own. If it seemed that television 
couldn't possibly get more surreal in the age of presidential testimony 
about a White House affair, here comes ``The View,'' ABC's salty, 
year-old talk show on which dialogue as unexpected as this takes place 
regularly. Essentially an unscripted kaffeeklatsch with five bright, 
brash women representing different generations, the show is one of 
network television's most unlikely hits. After a slow start in its 
first season, ratings in the past few months have jumped by 50 percent 
among traditional daytime viewers _ young mothers, older people and 
the unemployed. But what's even more surprising is that it has gained 
something of a cult following, watched in gyms and coffee shops, and 
taped for later viewing by people who are not traditional daytime 
watchers. ``Saturday Night Live,'' which has been lampooning ``The 
View'' in a recurring skit since late last year, already counts the 
routine among its classics. ``It's great material for us, because 
we really don't have to heighten the reality much to make it absurd,'' 
said Tina Fey, one of the writers who created the sketch. She knew 
``The View'' was ripe for parody the moment she saw Ms. Vieria give 
Wesley Snipes a spontaneous lap dance on air. This year's Halloween 
parade in Greenwich Village featured a bevy of drag queens decked 
out as the women of ``The View,'' and they received enthusiastic cheers 
from parade spectators. Despite the layered-on glitter of daytime 
television, it's easy to imagine the women of ``The View'' as co-workers 
at, say, a Long Island insurance firm, who after work go out to talk 
frankly over margaritas. ``It works because these are women whom the 
viewers wish they could hang out with,'' said Garth Ancier, the president 
for entertainment at the WB network, who created ``The Ricki Lake 
Show.'' ``They're just a little funnier and a little more glamorous. 
But not too much more.'' In its 11 a.m. time slot, the show's ratings 
are crushing the talk shows of Sally Jessy Raphael, Roseanne and Montel 
Williams in New York, and it is running neck-and-neck with Jerry Springer's 
show, at the opposite, darker end of the daytime spectrum. ``The View'' 
was nominated for eight Emmys last year and won three. Maybe every 
generation gets the talk shows it deserves. ``My parents had Phil 
Donahue,'' said David Chen, 20, a film student at New York University. 
``It was all about sensitivity. Whereas we have `The View.''' ``The 
View'' is unlikely to be accused of sensitivity. This is surprising, 
considering it is the brainchild of Ms. Walters, a woman known more 
for her telegenic empathy than for her love of a bawdy good time. 
In fact, in the pantheon of daytime talk, from Oprah Winfrey's do-it-yourself 
spirituality to Rosie O'Donnell's child-friendly tour of Broadway, 
``The View'' is as smart and salty as it gets. Each of the women on 
``The View,'' all handpicked by Ms. Walters, plays an amplified version 
of herself. They were chosen not only for their on-camera charm but 
for the different decades and social backgrounds they represent, in 
an effort to appeal to a wide female audience. Joy Behar, a comedian, 
is a divorced single mother in her 50s. Ms. Vieira is a 44-year-old 
married working mother. Star Jones is a flamboyant, 36-year-old single 
black woman. Debbie Matenopoulos, 23, is an NYU graduate with long 
legs and a tattoo. Ms. Walters herself, who appears on the set a few 
times a week when her schedule permits, appeals to the 60-plus demographic. 
As stagy as the show sometimes may seem to be, there is undeniable 
chemistry: by all accounts, the stars get along well in real life. 
Of course, for all of them except Ms. Walters, the bonhomie is heightened 
by their quick rise from relative obscurity to the big time. ``This 
is a pretty great job,'' said Ms. Behar, who after a decade on the 
stand-up circuit and as host of a radio show on WABC recently completed 
a wit-and-wisdom book, ``Joy Schtick'' (Hyperion). Ms. Jones, capitalizing 
on her newfound visibility, recently released an autobiography, ``You 
Have to Stand for Something, or You'll Fall Down,'' (Bantam). Ms. 
Vieira, the group's quasi-moderator, is alternately corny and self-mocking. 
Ms. Jones, every inch the plus-size diva (her term), veers from warm 
to sarcastic. Ms. Behar, who is the most comfortable on stage, insures 
that the conversation never gets too saccharine. Ms. Matenopoulos 
plays the dopey kid who needs life lessons and occasionally deserves 
a bop on the head (which she gets on the ``Saturday Night Live'' parody 
skits). Ms. Walters is the mom, simultaneously encouraging and reproving, 
trying to be hip, but ultimately a bit of a prude. ``I do get a little 
embarrassed sometimes about what we say, and I worry that it's going 
over the top,'' she said on a recent morning after the show as the 
phalanx of hair and makeup artists who trail her like a Secret Service 
detail finally cleared. She tries to maintain her image as a ``serious 
journalist,'' she said, by not participating in the show's more personal 
moments, as when the group shared stories of losing their virginity. 
``I make it look like I'm sharing,'' she said, a little conspiratorially, 
``but I'm actually just moving the focus to the others.'' Still, she 
said, ``people don't realize how much I get a kick out of this.'' 
``The View'' trots out the usual celebrities, most of whom Ms. Walters 
interviews solo with her usual soft-focus style. And there's a viewer-service 
section during the last 20 minutes, dealing with subjects like ``How 
to Love Only the One You're With,'' and the pros and cons of Botox 
injections. But it's the first 15 minutes of ``The View'' that has 
the most verve. That's when ``the ladies,'' as everyone behind the 
scenes calls them, sit around the kitchen table of their elaborate 
``shabby chic'' set and gab about the morning headlines. It's similar 
to the signature loose-patter opener of ``Live With Regis and Kathie 
Lee,'' which plays on a monitor in their makeup room. Although the 
show's producers brief the hosts on the topics to be discussed and 
arm them with factoids culled from the morning newspapers, the conversation 
is unrehearsed. Although it is often frothy banter, it can also be 
unexpectedly intelligent. At its best, the talk is a collision of 
contrivance and spontaneity: racy, sly, dizzyingly anarchic. A case 
in point: after DNA confirmation of Thomas Jefferson's affair with 
his slave Sally Hemmings, the conversation centered on how the report 
might affect impeachment proceedings. Ms. Walters laid out why the 
parallels to the Clinton case were shaky, elucidated some constitutional 
issues and contended that President Clinton's indiscretion was worse 
because he was married. Ms. Jones, obviously appalled, took issue. 
``She was a slave, Barbara,'' she said, cutting off her boss without 
a smile. ``I read about all this this morning,'' Ms. Walters continued, 
gliding past the remark. ``I didn't want you to think I knew it all 
before, though I could have pretended.'' Ms. Vieira, not missing a 
beat, took a potshot at her senior colleague: ``Well, you were around 
then.'' The conversation may not be ``Nightline'' or even ``Letterman,'' 
but it covers topics more sophisticated than ``my boyfriend is sleeping 
with my sister,'' a staple of daytime television. ``You have a difficult 
line to walk,'' said Jessica Stedman-Guff, a senior producer of ``The 
View.'' ``We want to be smart, but you run the risk of alienating 
the audience if you're, well, not upbeat.'' Ms. Walters is the first 
to admit it may seem strange that after working so hard to build a 
prestigious career as a journalist, she would return to the daytime 
ghetto, where she started out as a co-host of the ``Today'' show. 
Some of her friends, she concedes, thought she was ``well, nutty'' 
to dabble in daytime. ``This time slot had been a disaster for the 
network, and so they came to me and asked me if I had an idea for 
a daytime show, and it just so happened I did. The news department 
didn't want me to do it, but I didn't listen.'' Her inspiration for 
``The View'' was ``Girltalk,'' an early 1960s show starring Virginia 
Graham, and the last few minutes of ``This Week'' when David Brinkley 
was the host. ``People just sat around chatting smartly,'' Ms. Walters 
said. A powerhouse at 68, Ms. Walters still does two shows of ``20-20'' 
each week, which is scheduled to expand to three once ``Monday Night 
Football'' ends. She also does four specials a year. ``The View'' 
takes three hours a day at least three days a week, a big chunk of 
her time. On the days she's not on the show, Ms. Walters still exerts 
control from afar. She often relays directions mid-show even when 
she's in one of her other offices or just away from the set for few 
moments. During a recent show, during a short segment that didn't 
include her, Ms. Walters was in the green room with her eyes on the 
monitor when she relayed a message, from her assistant to a producer 
in the control room to Ms. Jones' tiny ear prompt: ``Tell Star to 
get to the point,'' Ms. Walters instructed in a clipped tone. An instant 
later, Ms. Jones interrupted her guest. ``Let me get to the point,'' 
she said with a flourish. ``Perfect,'' Ms. Walters said. It's tempting 
to think of ``The View'' as a mere bagatelle for Ms. Walters, something 
she will soon tire of. But in fact it may turn out to be her idea 
of a condo in Palm Beach, a nice place to spend time when she's ready 
to slow down. ``Chasing the `big get' is really exhausting,'' she 
said. ``Maybe this is what I'd like to do down the road.'' Backstage 
at ``The View,'' its appeal is evident. The scene is as warm and as 
girly _ and as crazed _ as a sorority house on a Saturday night. Just 
moments before air time, in a cloud of powder and hairspray, ``the 
ladies'' dash between the makeup room and their dressing rooms. (Ms. 
Jones' is outfitted like a boudoir, Ms. Matenopoulos' is a dorm disaster 
of rumpled clothes topped by a yellow skateboard. Ms. Walters' looks 
as bare as a motel room). Ms. Vieira, who dashes in late because she 
actually is the conscientious mom she plays on the show, slides into 
a makeup chair and is swallowed up by a gang of hairdressers. (``The 
View'' won an Emmy last year for best hair.) A costumer, Fran Taylor, 
coaxes Ms. Jones into a maroon ensemble to offset Ms. Walters brown 
suit. Ms. Matenopoulos, her blond streaked hair being teased with 
an inch of its life, is given a crash course on John Glenn's first 
historic mission by a segment producer. (``Trust me, it was amazing,'' 
the producer says.) ``Debbie, darling, how's the cold?'' asked Ms. 
Walters, frowning slightly at her stubby nails and iridescent light 
blue polish. ``Much, much, much, much better,'' said Ms. Matenopoulos, 
lunging out of the makeup chair to chase Ms. Walters around for a 
bear hug. It's a ritual they seem to have enacted before. It's hard 
to imagine Ms. Walters doing that with Hugh Downs. ``You're so silly,'' 
Ms. Walters says. It takes her a moment to regain her composure, the 
calm smile bouncing back to her lips out of sheer instinct. ``Now'' 
she said, pulling the edge of her suit jacket back into place, ``Ladies, 
let's behave. At least a little.''
