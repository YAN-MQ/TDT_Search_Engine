The United Nations Security Council has unanimously approved a resolution 
condemning Iraq's decision to halt cooperation with U.N. weapons inspectors. 
The resolution, approved Thursday, calls on Iraq to immediately resume 
cooperation with U.N. inspectors. In a statement released after the 
U.N. decision, President Clinton said the burden is on Iraq to get 
back in compliance and meet its obligations immediately. Iraq maintains 
it will not rescind its decision on the inspections.
