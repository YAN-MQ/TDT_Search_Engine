The New York Times said in an editorial for Saturday, Nov. 7: Daniel 
Patrick Moynihan grew up in Hell's Kitchen on Manhattan's West Side, 
trained as a teacher and scholar and served four presidents as a domestic 
adviser and diplomat before running for the Senate in 1976. The Almanac 
of American Politics describes him as ``the nation's best thinker 
among politicians since Lincoln and its best politician among thinkers 
since Jefferson.'' The formulation seems a little over the top, but 
it also fits a man who always liked to surround his serious concerns 
with extravagant language and gestures. Now, at 71, he has announced 
his intention to retire in 2000, depriving the Senate of one of its 
most distinctive, elegant and independent voices. Moynihan has certainly 
reveled in the image of cerebral public statesman, aloof from the 
muck of politics and patronage. But the truth is more complex. He 
has been an astonishing vote-getter who worked as hard and as effectively, 
though in his own way, to deliver for New York as has his colleague 
Alfonse D'Amato. On the Finance Committee he showed how New York gets 
cheated on federal dollars, and delivered aid and tax breaks for New 
York's teaching hospitals, universities and museums. He won billions 
in transportation funds, and worked to transform the old Post Office 
building in Manhattan into a new Penn Station that could, quite properly, 
be named for him. Moynihan's announcement may diminish his leverage 
over the next two years, and his departure will cost New York's congressional 
delegation seniority and influence. But in return he gives both Democrats 
and Republicans time to seek a worthy successor. Moreover, his authority 
in the Senate has always rested less on his committee positions than 
on the power of his ideas. He made auto safety an issue before Ralph 
Nader. His pioneering study of breakdowns among black families was 
first vilified, then seen as prophetic. With Nathan Glazer he practically 
invented the modern study of ethnicity, and warned in his 1993 book 
``Pandemonium'' of ethnic conflicts around the world. He has battled 
most recently against mindless government secrecy and what he calls 
``defining deviancy down,'' the notion that society is too tolerant 
of destructive behavior. The issue driving Moynihan all his career 
has been welfare and the poor, and here he leaves a formidable legacy. 
As a soldier in the War on Poverty, he came to criticize its obsession 
with citizen participation. As President Nixon's domestic adviser 
he fought and lost his battle for a guaranteed income for the poor, 
but later, in the welfare reforms of 1988, he saw his proposals for 
work incentives and child support codified into law. He blasted President 
Clinton for focusing on health care instead of welfare in 1994, advice 
that many around the president later wished they had taken. When Clinton 
signed a punitive welfare bill, Moynihan declared, ``Shame on the 
president.'' The happiest aspect of Moynihan's retirement is that 
he is certain to remain within earshot as a teacher, writer and strong 
voice of public conscience.
