Kaname Yokoo collected five points Friday and maintained a four-point 
lead after two rounds in the 120 million yen (dlrs 1.02 million) Acom 
International. Yokoo, seeking his first title in three years as a 
pro, scattered four birdies and three bogeys en route to a 36-hole 
total of 22 points at the 6,948-yard (6,323-meter), par-72 Seve Ballesteros 
Golf Club course. The tournament's modified Stableford scoring system 
awards 8 points for a double eagle, 5 for an eagle, 2 for a birdie, 
zero for par, minus-1 for a bogey and minus-3 for a double bogey or 
worse. Toshimitus Izawa, winner of the Tokai Classic last month, also 
had 5 points to share second place at 18 with Shusaku Sugimoto, who 
earned 18 points with nine birdies. Hirofumi Miyase and Katsumasa 
Miyamoto were another point behind at 17, followed by Toru Suzuki's 
16.
