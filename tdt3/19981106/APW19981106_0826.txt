A Council of Europe delegation left Belarus on Friday after trying 
to gauge the possibility of dialogue with this former Soviet republic 
ruled by an autocratic president. The head of the delegation refused 
to spell out his conclusions Friday. The delegation will present its 
views next month to colleagues at the Council of Europe, the continent's 
leading human rights organization. Belarus lost its special guest 
status in the Council of Europe after President Alexander Lukashenko 
disbanded the Belarusian parliament in 1996 and put together a new 
body made up of his supporters. Belarus is the only European nation 
that is neither a member nor a special guest in the Council of Europe. 
The delegation, headed by vice president of the Council's parliamentary 
assembly, Robert Antretter, met with Lukashenko, his government officials 
and lawmakers, and members of the opposition and of the former, disbanded 
parliament. The delegation also studied Belarusian laws on the court 
system, media, human rights and electoral system, Antretter said. 
``The fact that we are here means that we have certain hopes,'' Antretter 
told a news conference in capital Minsk. ``On the map of Europe, this 
country is the only white spot. This situation is intolerable. We 
hope that a time will come when this white spot will disappear.'' 
Lukashenko, meanwhile, again criticized the exclusion of his country 
from the Council of Europe. ``I am absolutely convinced that our state 
meets all standards applied to member nations,'' he said. ``Moreover, 
the level of democracy, the protection of our people's rights is not 
one bit lower than in the countries that have recently joined this 
respected and very influential organization,'' Lukashenko told Antretter. 
Lukashenko has persecuted independent media, banned rallies by his 
political opponents, and his police have routinely beaten and arrested 
demonstrators. But Lukashenko insists that this is the necessary toll 
of his attempt to bring about Soviet-style ``stability'' to Belarus. 
The 40-nation Council of Europe was created in 1949 to promote democracy, 
human rights and the rule of law. It is best known for its European 
Convention on Human Rights that forbids members to impose the death 
penalty.
