Call directory assistance in Massachusetts and ask for ``the mad Russian,'' 
and chances are they'll know who you're trying to reach. Address an 
envelope with the same name and the Boston post office knows where 
to deliver it: a brownstone house in Brookline, whose porch is often 
crowded with smokers furiously puffing away before entering the offices 
of Yefim Shubentsov, a Soviet emigre renowned for curing nicotine 
slaves of their cravings in an hour. Sometimes there are recognizable 
faces amid the clouds of smoke: Billy Joel, Jann Wenner and Amy Tan 
all quit smoking after visits to Shubentsov. An eccentric with an 
often incomprehensible Russian accent, Shubentsov, 58, uses methods 
that seem to owe more to Rasputin than to modern science. His technique 
resists explanation. What looks like hand-waving and suggestive mumbo 
jumbo Shubentsov calls marshaling clients' ``bioenergy'' to rid them 
of the desire to smoke. ``Physically, I transform energy,'' he said. 
Even people who have been cured by Shubentsov have a hard time explaining 
how he did it. ``It was so weird,'' the novelist Alice Hoffman said. 
``I was one of those really bad smokers. I was like the sort who sneaked 
cigarettes during labor. I left there and I had no desire for the 
thing I'd had before. For a long time I couldn't even talk about it, 
like if you talked about it, you'd break the spell.'' Shubentsov even 
cured Jim Fitzgerald, a former editor at St. Martin's Press, and the 
author of ``The Joy of Smoking Cigarettes,'' who kicked his habit 
recently after attending one of Shubentsov's group sessions, which 
are held four times a day, three days a week. On a recent afternoon, 
an eclectic mix of 15 patients came to see Shubentsov, including a 
middle-aged man who had come from North Carolina, a woman suffering 
from emphysema, and a Lebanese-born woman with a cell phone. Each 
had paid $65. The wood-paneled waiting room had the charm of an eccentric 
college professor's office. On the walls hung sunny landscapes painted 
by Shubentsov, who was a commercial artist in Moscow before he emigrated 
with his wife and son in 1979, setting up his quit-smoking practice 
the same year. Shubentsov appeared: a small, compact man in a plaid 
jacket and olive pants. He invited the group to a stark room adorned 
with chairs in a U shape and a desk empty except for a clock and a 
glass of water. ``Relax, relax,'' Shubentsov said, in an accent as 
heavy as a pirogi. Relaxation is a key to his treatment, and since 
he thinks no one who is in pain can relax, he begins sessions by asking 
people for the location of any pains they have. Then he dispenses 
a dose of ``bioenergy'' by making a few movements with his hands near 
the trouble spot. Insisting he is not a faith healer, he explained, 
``It's no magic.'' He worked his way around the chairs, waving his 
hands over an injured ankle, flicking his fingers above a sore neck, 
encouraging people to ask questions. ``Be brave, I don't bite,'' he 
said. Only a few dared. ``How does this work?'' one asked. Shubentsov's 
answer, something about his superior biological fields, elicited confused 
looks. ``Can you cure depression?'' someone asked. ``If it's situational,'' 
Shubentsov said. In a book he helped to write this summer, ``Cure 
Your Cravings'' (Penguin Putnam, $21.95), Shubentsov says that he 
has treated nearly 96,000 people since 1979 for smoking, as well as 
overeating, phobias, depression, even broken hearts. His co-author 
is Barbara Gordon, who wrote the drug-addiction memoir ``I'm Dancing 
as Fast as I Can.'' He cured her of smoking. After reaching the last 
person in the group, Shubentsov stood before his desk and said, ``Now 
we begin.'' A rapid-fire lecture ensued. He flitted from subject to 
subject, gesturing wildly, a tic that has prompted some to speculate 
that he is performing some sort of group hypnosis. But Shubentsov 
later denied it. ``I never hypnotize people my entire life,'' he said. 
``We are born without the desire to smoke,'' he told the group. ``In 
our original condition that desire does not exist. I put back in place 
what was supposed to be.'' He offered a hodgepodge of obvious advice 
(don't eat between meals; get more physical exercise) and hard-to-follow 
digressions. Instructing the group to avoid substitutes for smoking, 
he barked, ```Don't even put your finger in your mouth.'' ``You are 
born without the desire to smoke,'' he repeated in conclusion. ``Smoking 
for you does not exist anymore.'' Afterward, he saw each client individually 
for one minute. Shubentsov told them, with eyes closed, to imagine 
themselves not smoking. Then he waved a hand and made a breathy sound. 
``He kind of sneezes on you,'' Patty Ryan, a graphic artist who had 
come from Los Angeles, said. Does it work? Though he is hard to pin 
down, Shubentsov suggests that his success rate is more than 90 percent, 
an astonishing figure and one that seems like an exaggeration. It 
is not overly difficult to find failed clients. Joel Eichel, an owner 
of Bigelow Pharmacy in New York, took his three-pack-a-day habit to 
Shubentsov, but was not cured. ``You can tell me a lot of things, 
but just because this guy says he's gonna give me bioenergy,'' Eichel 
said, trailing off in a skeptical tone, ``I don't give it a whole 
lot of credence. To me, it's a lot of bull.'' Other hard cases include 
Fran Lebowitz, the author, who failed to shrug off her smoking habit 
after a visit to Shubentsov. She declined to comment further. Shubentsov 
said that he discovered his way with bioenergy some 30 years ago in 
Moscow. One day while delivering artworks, a stranger asked him to 
be in a laboratory test. He was told that he had a ``better biological 
field than average,'' he said. ``I didn't understand what the hell 
is it.'' In the early 1980s, Shubentsov's method was observed by two 
psychotherapists from Harvard University Health Services, Dr. Douglas 
Powell and Dr. Henry Babcock. They sent him 20 patients, who complained 
of phobias, pain and a desire to stop smoking and lose weight. All 
had been previously treated by Powell and Babcock, with little success. 
``He did some pretty good work; it was pretty impressive,'' said Powell, 
director of research and behavioral science at Harvard University 
Health Services. ``These were pretty difficult patients, and he had 
about 50 percent success.'' He compared Shubentsov's technique to 
quigong, an ancient form of Chinese medicine that combines movement, 
meditation and visualization to enhance the mind-body connection and 
assist healing. ``Some people are born to be healers, and he may have 
that in him,'' Powell said. Fitzgerald, the formerly joyful smoker, 
cannot explain Shubentsov's method, but he is impressed. ``There's 
something he does,'' he said. ``It was all so convoluted. I keep hearing 
the words `common sense.' And somehow that gets me to not smoke.''
