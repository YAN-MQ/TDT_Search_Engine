The men's basketball program at the University of Cincinnati has been 
hit with a two-year probation and the loss of three scholarships for 
several rules violations. The National Collegian Athletic Association 
said a lack of institutional control resulted in violations involving 
numerous players, a manager, and an assistant coach. Cincinnati school 
officials say they will not appeal the ruling. Head coach Bob Huggins 
says the situation is unfortunate. A lot of people have made mistakes, 
you know. Unfortunately, it's the basketball program, and he and I 
and the rest of the people are going to suffer the consequences. I 
can't do anything about that now. Cincinnati is the second big school 
to receive a ban in the past three months. In September, Louisville 
received a three-year probation and was banned from post-season play 
for one year.
