Young people often are described by their elders as growing up too 
fast. The same appears to be true of a group of giant dinosaurs that 
roamed the earth 150 million years ago. Apatosaurus, once known as 
Brontosaurus, was a huge plant-eating dinosaur about the size and 
weight of a large diesel locomotive. Common wisdom had it that Apatosaurus 
took many decades to reach its mature size and bulk. Now that's being 
called into question. At last month's meeting of the Society of Vertebrate 
Paleontology in Snowbird, Utah, Christina Curry of the State University 
of New York at Stony Brook presented a new analysis of Apatosaurus 
bones. Core samples from the extinct reptile's shoulder blades showed 
microscopic ring structures similar to those found in the bones of 
modern manatees and sea turtles. Assuming that the rings are annual 
deposits, as they are in the modern creatures, Miss Curry came up 
with an estimate that the bones, and hence the dinosaur, reached full 
size in just eight to 11 years. The journal "Science" estimates that 
at that rate, the huge, lumbering Apatosaur grew as fast as a modern 
duck. Ducks, however, reach full size in just 22 weeks, while a Apatosaurus 
kept up its rapid growth for a decade or more.
