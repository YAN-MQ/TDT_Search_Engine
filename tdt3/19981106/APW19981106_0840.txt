A senior Turkish official urged Germany's new government Friday to 
improve relations between the two countries. Relations have been cool 
since Turkish premier Mesut Yilmaz accused former Chancellor Helmut 
Kohl of masterminding the European Union's refusal to consider Turkey's 
bid for membership last year. Turkish deputy foreign minister Korkmaz 
Haktamir said the election of Gerhard Schroeder as chancellor offered 
``a very important chance'' to overcome the strains. He said Foreign 
Minister Ismail Cem has invited his German colleague, Joschka Fischer, 
for talks as soon as possible. No date has been set, German officials 
said. ``We believe in the strength of our ties,'' Haktamir told reporters. 
However, his German counterpart, Hans-Friedrich von Ploetz, said it 
was ``absolutely irresponsible'' to name a target date for Turkey's 
EU membership. He also said Schroeder's government would stress concerns 
about human rights in Turkey ``at least as much'' as Kohl's did. Both 
officials attended a Bonn meeting of the German-Turkish Cooperation 
Council, a grouping of business and political leaders from both countries 
that was launched in 1993.
