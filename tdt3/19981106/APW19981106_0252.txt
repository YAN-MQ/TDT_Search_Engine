British Foreign Secretary Robin Cook on Thursday issued a fresh warning 
that Iraq faced the ``severest consequences'' if Saddam Hussein did 
not back down in the latest standoff over U.N. weapons inspections. 
Although a U.N. Security Council resolution condemning Saddam did 
not specifically authorize military force, Cook said legal authority 
exists for air strikes if inspectors are not allowed to resume their 
work. ``We are quite confident that if it comes to that, there is 
adequate legal basis for us to proceed,'' Cook said in a British Broadcasting 
Corp. interview. ``All options are open.'' Iraq's decision Saturday 
to end all cooperation with disarmament monitors has been condemned 
by the U.N. Security Council as a ``flagrant violation'' of the country's 
agreements with the world body. On Wednesday, U.S. Defense Secretary 
William Cohen lobbied Gulf states for support of possible military 
action. Prime Minister Tony Blair, speaking to a group of students 
Thursday, also spoke of the government's readiness to use military 
force if necessary. ``The reason that we are supporting the U.S. and 
the U.S. is supporting us is because we believe in what we are doing 
in relation to Iraq,'' Blair said. ``The international community must 
be prepared to act, if necessary by military force, to stop him.'' 
Cook said that while the current emphasis is on a diplomatic solution 
to the crisis, U.S.-led forces assembled in the region in February 
remain ready to strike. The United States has some 24,000 troops, 
more than 20 warships including the carrier USS Eisenhower, and about 
170 warplanes and helicopters in the Gulf region, according to the 
Pentagon. ``What they (Iraq) are reneging on is not an agreement just 
with U.K. or U.S., it is defiance of the whole of the Security Council,'' 
Cook said. ``(Saddam) is not going to get away with it,'' Cook said. 
``He cannot win.''
