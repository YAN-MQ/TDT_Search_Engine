SATURDAY'S KEY GAMES No. 6 Florida 9-1 No. 1 at Florida State 10-1 
As usual for this game, the winner remains in the national-championship 
picture. Florida State has won nine straight games, Florida seven 
straight. Doug Johnson of Florida, who has passed for 1,118 yards 
and 10 touchdowns in his last three games, faces the nation's top-ranked 
defense (215.8 yards a game). But Florida State's quarterback, Chris 
Weinke, is lost for the season, and as Coach Bobby Bowden said of 
his young quarterback replacements, ``They've got ability. It's just 
that you can't coach experience.'' No. 9 Michigan 8-2 No. 7 at Ohio 
State 9-1 A classic matchup of Big Ten teams with strong offenses 
and solid defenses. Michigan, on an eight-game winning streak, plays 
its best in big games, and in the last 10 years it is 8-1-1 over Ohio 
State. If the Wolverines win, they will return to the Rose Bowl. However, 
Ohio State rates the edge on Joe Germaine's passing, which helped 
it roll up 627 yards last Saturday against Iowa. As Hayden Fry, the 
Iowa coach, said of Ohio State, ``They have the greatest conglomeration 
of talent that I've ever seen.'' No. 3 Kansas State 10-0 No. 22 at 
Missouri 7-3 Even after 18 consecutive victories, including an upset 
of Nebraska last week, Kansas State needs to win impressively to preserve 
a shot at the national title. Missouri lost to Texas A&AMP;M on a 
field goal with 90 seconds left, leading Larry Smith, the Missouri 
coach, to say, ``Our guys are feeling anger, severe anger, but we 
can't let this bury us.'' No. 17 Southern California 7-3 No. 5 at 
UCLA 9-0 Despite a suspect defense, UCLA, with 19 in a row, has Division 
I-A's longest winning streak. It has clinched the Pacific 10 championship, 
and if it dosn't make the national-championship game in the Fiesta 
Bowl it will play in the Rose Bowl. Southern California, with a freshman 
quarterback in Carson Palmer, appears outmanned. EAST No. 19 Syracuse 
(6-3) at Temple (2-8) Syracuse's offense is explosive and Temple's 
defense has been generous. Boston College (4-6) at West Virginia (6-3) 
A battle of tailbacks Amos Zereoue of West Virginia and Mike Cloud 
of Boston College. Penn (7-2) at Cornell (4-5) If Penn wins, as expected, 
it will gain the Ivy League title outright. Yale (5-4) at Harvard 
(4-5) An even battle looms in the 115th edition of The Game. Brown 
(6-3) at Columbia (4-5) Columbia's defense, which manhandled Cornell, 
could provide an upset. Dartmouth (2-7) at Princeton (4-5) If Princeton 
throws six interceptions, as it did against Yale, it will lose. Lehigh 
(10-0) at Lafayette (3-7) Lehigh easily in the 134th game of football's 
longest-running rivalry. SOUTH No. 25 Kentucky (7-3) at No. 2 Tennessee 
(9-0) Tennessee should win, but beware of Tim Couch of Kentucky, who 
has passed for 3,938 yards and 34 touchdowns this season. Mississippi 
(6-3) at Georgia (7-2) Mississippi has beaten no one with a winning 
record. No. 15 (tie) Arkansas (8-1) at Mississippi State (6-3) Arkansas, 
which almost upset Tennessee, faces another aggressive offense. Wake 
Forest (3-7) at No. 15 (tie) Georgia Tech (7-2) Wake Forest ends a 
season of high expectations and poor results. Houston (3-7) at Tulane 
(9-0) In beating Army, Shawn King of Tulane passed for 332 yards and 
ran for 133. Rutgers (5-5) at Virginia Tech (7-2) Virginia Tech, despite 
a sleepy offense, is a clear favorite. Army (2-7) at Louisville (6-4) 
Chris Redman of Louisville, who passed for 592 yards and six touchdowns 
against East Carolina, may not start because of a strained left knee. 
Auburn (3-7) vs. Alabama (6-4) at Birmingham, Ala. A bad year for 
Auburn, which gave up 527 yards in losing to Georgia. MIDWEST No. 
22 (tie) Penn State (7-2) at No. 18 Wisconsin (9-1) Penn State's only 
losses (to Ohio State and Michigan) have been on the road, and Wisconsin 
is tough, too. Louisiana State (4-5) at No. 8 Notre Dame (8-1) This 
will not be easy for Notre Dame unless it stops the run. Indiana (4-6) 
at No. 20 Purdue (7-4) Easier prospects for Purdue, which barely survived 
Michigan State's passing. SOUTHWEST No. 13 Wyoming (8-2) at Tulsa 
(3-7) Wyoming's 3-4 pressure defense should get it to a bowl game. 
FAR WEST Rice (5-5) at No. 11 Air Force (9-1) Air Force, known for 
its running game, can play defense, too. No. 12 Oregon (8-2) at Oregon 
State (4-6) In Oregon's last two games, Akili Smith has passed for 
839 yards and seven touchdowns. Stanford (2-8) at California (5-5) 
California must win The Game, West Coast version, to qualify for bowl 
consideration. Ratings by The New York Times computer. All times are 
Eastern.
