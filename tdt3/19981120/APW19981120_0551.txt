Pakistan's prime minister declared a state of emergency in a southern 
province and ordered the army to quell violence that has killed more 
than 1,000 people in the port city of Karachi. Sharif announced setting 
up of military courts in Karachi _ the provincial capital of the Sindh 
province_ to try those behind the violence. These courts will decide 
cases within days, not weeks and months, he said. ``The decision has 
been taken to protect lives of the people and is in the larger interest 
of the city and the country,'' he said. Sharif last month dismissed 
the elected provincial government of Sindh after widespread political 
violence killed more than 1,000 people in Karachi this year, paralyzing 
economic activity. The prime minister invoked Article 245 of the constitution, 
which allows the suspension of civil rights. ``The step has been taken 
because the terrorists were becoming more and more powerful,'' he 
said. ``We want to get Karachi out of this hell.'' Sharif had accused 
his former ally, the Muttahida Qami Movement (MQM), of most of the 
bloodletting in Karachi including last month's murder of former governor 
Hakim Said. The MQM, which changed its name to Muttahida Qami Movement 
from the Mohajir Qami Movement, is locked in a bloody conflict with 
its dissident faction called the MQM Haqiqi. Hundreds of people have 
died in tit-for-tat killings by the militants of these two factions 
in recent months. The party broke into two groups several years ago. 
The MQM is comprised of Urdu speakers who migrated from India at independence 
from Britain in 1947 and their descendants. The government has arrested 
490 people for involvement in terrorist activities since the imposition 
of governor's rule, Sharif said. But Sharif said military courts are 
needed in Sindh because ``terrorists threatened the witnesses, judges 
and their families,'' ``It is also a part of Islamic justice which 
says speedy justice should be provided at the door step. These courts 
will be a lesson for the criminals and terrorists,'' he said. Sharif 
asked the MQM to support government programs to stop the violence 
in Karachi, but it refused. His party dismissed the Sindh government 
on Oct. 30 and imposed federal rule _ a decision bitterly criticized 
by opposition parties. Senator Iqbal Haider, a member of the main 
opposition Pakistan People's Party, said the decision was in total 
violation of the constitution. ``The government does not have any 
justification for this harsh decision. It is a mini-martial law,'' 
he said. A MQM spokesman Shoaib Bukhari said there won't be any justice 
in the military courts. ``The courts will decide cases in haste and 
will not provide any speedy justice,'' he said.
