South Korea says the United States and North Korea will likely hold 
another round of talks early next month on opening a suspected nuclear 
site for U.S. inspection. South Korean officials say Pyongyang has 
asked that the meeting be held in Washington. Earlier this week, special 
U.S. envoy, Charles Cartman, held two days of intensive talks with 
North Korean officials in Pyongyang. Meanwhile, a published report 
says North Korea is building at least two new launch facilities for 
its medium range missiles.
