A new chapter in auction history unfolded here at Christie's on Thursday 
night when a haunting van Gogh self-portrait from 1889 was sold for 
$71.5 million, nearly three times its high estimate. It was the second-highest 
price for a van Gogh at auction and the third-highest price for any 
artwork ever sold at auction. Right from the start, the evening had 
the feel of a winner _ quite a reversal from the previous three nights, 
when buyers were reserved and prices mixed. The sale began with a 
dazzling group of Magrittes from the estate of Harry Torczyner, the 
artist's lawyer, many of which brought more than twice their high 
estimates. And then bidding fever became contagious. The sale totaled 
$166.7 million, far above its high estimate of $134.3 million. Of 
the 68 works offered, 59 found buyers. ``The depth of the bidding 
was extraordinary,'' said Franck Giraud, head of Christie's 19th and 
20th-century art departments in New York. ``Buyers came from every 
part of the world.'' The high price for the van Gogh stunned the audience, 
which overflowed Christie's Park Avenue salesroom. Seven bidders, 
on the phone and in the room, seriously tried to buy it. By the time 
the bids reached $50 million, the competition was down to a telephone 
bidder and Christopher Hartop, director of specialist departments 
at Christie's, who was taking his cues from John Lumley, the head 
of the 19th- and 20th-century art for Christie's worldwide. When Lumley 
discreetly nodded, Hartop's hand went into the air. Speculation about 
the still-unidentified buyer started buzzing as soon as the hammer 
fell. Was it casino owner Stephen Wynn, who has been voraciously buying 
Impressionist, modern and contemporary pictures for several years? 
No, members of the audience concurred, since William Acquavella, the 
Manhattan dealer who frequently bids for Wynn, dropped out of the 
race halfway through. Microsoft mogul Bill Gates was another name 
bandied about, but the buyer is more likely to be a European, since 
Gates would probably have bid through Patricia Hambrecht, as he did 
when he bought the Leonardo Codex for $30.8 million in 1994. More 
likely possibilities, experts said, would include Philip Niarchos, 
son of shipping magnate Stavros Niarchos, who amassed one of the most 
important collections of Impressionist and modern art in private hands 
before his death in 1996. Another was Baron Hans Heinrich von Thyssen-Bornemisza, 
the Swiss billionaire and collector. But the mystery of auctions is 
what keeps the audience riveted, as it did Thursday night. What made 
van Gogh's ``Portrait of an Artist Without His Beard'' so special 
was that the artist painted it for his mother, Anna Cornelia Carbentus 
van Gogh, for her 70th birthday not long before his suicide in 1890. 
At the time, van Gogh was ill in St. Remy, France, and wanted to reassure 
his mother that he was all right. He painted himself with chiseled 
features, a clean-shaven face and an intense stare. (Final prices 
include the auction house's commission, 15 percent of the first $50,000 
and 10 percent of the rest. Estimates do not reflect commissions.) 
The van Gogh was one of 10 paintings being sold by the heirs of Jacques 
Koerfer, a German-born collector and former chairman of the BMW automotive 
company, who died in 1991. This was the fourth block of Koerfer property 
Christie's had sold in the last six years. Five bidders wanted Cezanne's 
``Chateau Noir'' (1904), once in the collection of Lord Kenneth Clark, 
former director of the National Gallery in London. The landscape, 
which Christie's estimated would bring $5 million to $7 million, sold 
for $11.5 million to Simon de Pury, the former chairman of Sotheby's 
in Europe, who is now a private dealer and art adviser. Another popular 
work from the Koerfer collection, Leger's ``Composition (The Typographer),'' 
a colorful synthetic Cubist painting from 1917-18 estimated at $5 
million to $7 million, went to Desmond Corcoran, a London dealer, 
for $6 million. Many of the Magrittes from the Torczyner estate were 
among of the artist's best-known images, and Torczyner bought them 
directly from the artist. ``Personal Values'' (1952), a play on scale 
showing an oversized comb standing upright on a bed, a giant match 
and a green wine goblet on the floor, an enormous pill and a shaving 
brush in a bedroom with sky-patterned walls, was expected to fetch 
$2.5 million to $3.5 million. It sold for $7.1 million, a record for 
the artist, to the San Francisco Museum of Modern Art, which has aggressively 
been building its permanent art collection in the last few years. 
Applause broke out when ``The Fighter's Grave,'' Magritte's painting 
of a room-size rose, sold to an unidentified bidder for $5.7 million, 
nearly three times its $2 million high estimate. Several lots later, 
five bidders tried to buy ``Son of Man'' (1964), a self-portrait in 
which the artist poses in a bowler hat with a green apple obscuring 
his face. Estimated at $2 million to $3.5 million, it ended up selling 
for $5.3 million to an unidentified American collector bidding by 
telephone. Torczyner, who died in April, also owned Francis Bacon's 
``Portrait of George Dyer'' (1967), showing the artist's former lover 
with a twisted face and posed sitting cross-legged above a floral 
carpet on a pedestal chair. Expected to sell for $1.5 million to $2 
million, it went to an unidentified bidder for $2 million. ``Bidding 
stimulates bidding,'' said James Roundell, a London dealer. ``People 
like to see an active salesroom.'' The evening's biggest casualty 
was a nude by Modigliani. There were simply too many Modiglianis on 
the market this week. On Monday night, Sotheby's sold two of the artist's 
wife, Jeanne Hebuterne, clothed, from the Reader's Digest Collection, 
for $15.1 million and $9.9 million. Thursday night's nude, painted 
around the same time, was expected to sell for $8 million to $10 million, 
but nobody was willing to pay more than $5.5 million. Even so, experts 
were amazed at the sale's success, given the cautionary feeling that 
pervaded the week's auctions until Thursday night. ``It's hard to 
believe the market could absorb so much art,'' said Barbara Mathes, 
a Manhattan dealer. ``And at such great prices.''
