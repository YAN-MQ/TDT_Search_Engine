Terry Nichols is appealing his conviction in the Oklahoma City bombing. 
His attorneys filed papers at a U.S. court of appeals, arguing the 
trial judge gave improper jury instructions and mishandled key evidence. 
Nichols was sentenced to life in prison for involuntary manslaughter 
and conspiracy in the April 1995 bombing. 168 people were killed and 
hundreds of others injured.
