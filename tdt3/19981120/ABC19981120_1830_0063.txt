Good evening. We'll begin in Washington tonight where a single lawyer 
may have done the kind of damage to the independent counsel, Kenneth 
Starr, today, than 16 democratic congressmen and the president's lawyer 
didn't quite manage to do yesterday. His ethics adviser has resigned 
his position in protest. He accuses Mr. Starr of exceeding his authority 
when he appeared before the house Judiciary committee yesterday as 
Mr. dash put it, an aglessive advocate. Today for democrats in the 
Congress, he was something of a savior. Here's ABC's Jackie Judd. 
Sam dash accused Kenneth Starr of using his appearance before the 
judiciary committee to become an agreggive advocate for the impeachment 
of President Clinton rather than simply informing Congress of the 
evidence. In a stinging letter of resignation, dash wrote Starr that 
he "violated obligations under the independent counsel statute" and 
"unlawfully intruded on the power of impeachment", which belongs only 
to the Congress. An independent counsel cannot let himself get caught 
up in a political process, particularly as an advocate for the evidence 
of impeachment. Starr defended himself, saying even though he described 
allegedly impeachable offenses by the president, he never advised 
the committee on how it should vote. I tried to say yesterday several 
times, and I hope I said it, that this is your judgment. I've given 
you the information and you've invited me to come forward. Starr hired 
dash shortly after being named independent counsel four years ago. 
In dash, he found a democrat with impeccable credentials as an adviser 
on ethics, who had made his name as chief counsel to the Senate Watergate 
committee. It was dash who advised Starr he could keep his private 
law practice going while independent counsel, and he had a role in 
brokering the immunity deal for Monica Lewinsky. ABC News has learned 
that dash has been under pressure for some time from democrats supportive 
of the White House to drop Starr in a very public way. The timing 
of dash's sudden resignation is a particular blow to Starr. Whatever 
ground he may have gained yesterday in restoring his reputation, by 
fending off attacks from democrats, may well have been lost today.
