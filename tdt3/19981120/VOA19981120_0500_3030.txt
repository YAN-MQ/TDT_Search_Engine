American consumer confidence may be growing again. The Conference 
Board, a private business research group is predicting American consumers 
will spend more during this coming holiday Christmas season than they 
did all of last year. That is good news for retailers, but it is also 
good news for the U.S. economy. Two-thirds of the U.S. economy is 
based on consumer spending. And while there have been predictions 
of a slow down next year, conference board economist Lynn Franco says 
consumers do not seem to be overly concerned. Pretty much what we 
are picking up in this survey, really, is just that, right now, people 
continue to weigh conditions quite favorably. And despite all the 
talk about slow down in the future, consumers are not picking up any 
signals right now other than, you know, what is out there. Which is 
pretty positive. And I think that is reflected in their spending habits. 
Economist Lynn Franco says that one thing that has helped consumer 
confidence has been the recovery in the U.S. stock market.
