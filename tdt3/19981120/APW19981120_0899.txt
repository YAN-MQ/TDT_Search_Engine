Spain's Foreign Minister announced Friday that the Cuban government 
will release two political prisoners, a week after he had lobbied 
in their favor during a four-day tour to the Caribbean island. Abel 
Matutes told reporters his Cuban counterpart Roberto Robaina had informed 
him late Thursday that Jesus Chamber Ramirez and Dessi Mendoza Rivero 
would be released for ``humanitarian reasons.'' Chamber was sent to 
jail for 14 years in 1992, and Mendoza began serving an eight year 
sentence last year. Both were convicted of ``propaganda in favor of 
the enemy.'' ``It is pleasing that the mediation of the minister has 
produced the release of these two prisoners,'' a spokesman from the 
Foreign Ministry said, speaking on customary condition of anonymity. 
Matutes, speaking before leaving the country to attend a Spanish-French 
summit in France, said the two released prisoners would soon travel 
to Spain, the state-owned news agency EFE reported. The visit of Matutes 
to Cuba formally sealed the end to two years of bilateral tension 
ushered in by the election of conservative Prime Minister Jose Maria 
Aznar in 1996. It also paved the way for a visit next spring of Spain's 
King Juan Carlos. The warm welcome given to the head of Spanish diplomacy 
was in sharp contrast to the exchange of insults that followed Cuba's 
rejection of Spain's proposed ambassador in November 1996.
