President Clinton has left Japan after he and Prime Minister Keizo 
Obuchi pledged to jointly help the struggling economies of Asia recover 
from their financial problems. Mr. Clinton flew to South Korea for 
talks with President Kim Dae-jung. While in Tokyo, the president urged 
the government there to urgently carry out economic reforms and VOA's 
Debra Tate wraps up Mr. Clinton's trip to Japan. Mr. Clinton delivered 
a blunt message to Tokyo about what he believes it needs to do to 
recover from its long economic recession. Lower trade barriers or 
face the prospect of retaliatory protectionist measures from other 
nations. Protectionism is a no growth strategy that offers no way 
out of the current economic crisis. If coupled with actions which 
lead to an artificial explosion of exports in other countries, in 
fact, it can promote a protectionist reaction there, further slowing 
growth. Speaking at a joint news conference with Prime Minister Keizo 
Obuchi, Mr. Clinton welcomed Japan's plan to reform it banking system, 
but he said he is not sure if $195 billion stimulus package unveiled 
earlier this week would do enough to spur growth. Late Friday, Mr. 
Clinton left for Seoul South Korea where regional security issues 
are expected to dominate his agenda. Debra Tate, VOA News, Tokyo.
