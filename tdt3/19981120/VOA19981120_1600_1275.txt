American figure skater Nicole Bobeck and Michael Weiss lead after 
the short programs of the LaLique trophy in Paris. One of the skating 
Grand Prix series events. Bobeck skated a clean program to flamingo 
music from the movie, Zorro, and gathered scores ranging from 5.3 
to 5.8 out of 6. Weis skated second in the men's order and had scores 
of between 5.4 and 5.7 for a routine to the music of the rock group, 
Van Halen. In the pairs event, French skaters, Saral Abiqball and 
Stefan Benedict edged former world champions, Marina Yeltsova and 
Andre Buchkov of Russia. Now the short programs count for one-third 
of the total score. The long programs in all events including the 
ice dance, will be held on Saturday. The LaLique trophy is the fourth 
of the international skating union's events that feature Olympic eligible 
skaters.
