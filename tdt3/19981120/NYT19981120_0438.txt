If Laura Davies continues to dominate the par-5 holes at the Pagenet 
LPGA Tour Championship, she will be difficult to catch. Shooting a 
five-under par 67, after an opening-round 66, Davies surged to a four-stroke 
lead Friday after the second round at the Desert Inn Golf Club. Davies 
was 11 under par for the tournament (133), four strokes ahead of Tina 
Barrett and six ahead of Karrie Webb. Davies, the longest hitter in 
women's golf, has overpowered the Desert Inn's four par-5 holes. Through 
two days, she was a combined 11 under par on the par-5 holes, with 
three eagles and five birdies, using those holes to gain an edge on 
the elite field limited to the Ladies Professional Golf Association 
tour's top 30 money-winners this year. ``The par-5's play right into 
my hands,'' said Davies, who eagled the par-5, 471-yard No. 10 Friday, 
reaching the green with a driver and a 6-iron, then making a 35-foot 
putt. ``Today, a 4-iron was the longest I hit into any of the par-5's. 
I'm getting the ball into good position, and I'm taking advantage.'' 
Starting the day with a two-stroke lead over Juli Inkster, Davies 
was pushed by Barrett, who shot the best round Friday, a 66. Playing 
four groups ahead of Davies, Barrett birdied four of the first five 
holes, and when she birdied No. 12 by making a 12-foot putt, she pulled 
into a tie with Davies at seven under par. But the eagle at No. 10 
gave Davies a two-stroke lead, and she was never caught again. Davies 
added an impressive birdie on the par-5, 453-yard No. 15, a difficult 
green to reach in two shots because it is protected by water in the 
front. But for Davies, it was no problem. After a huge drive that 
traveled more than 280 yards, she hit a 9-iron shot 12 feet from the 
cup, then two-putted for birdie. Davies ended the day on a high note 
by making a 30-foot putt for birdie. For Davies, the par-5 holes have 
played more like par-4's, leaving many of her competitors admiring 
her power. ``When she harnesses her talent, she is on a different 
planet,'' said Barrett, who will be paired with Davies in Saturday's 
final twosome. ``I can't worry about what she's doing. A win here 
would be huge, but there are still two more days to go.'' Meanwhile, 
it appears that Annika Sorenstam, who has already won the money title, 
will also win the points race for player of the year. Se Ri Pak, the 
only other golfer who can win player of the year, shot herself out 
of the tournament Friday with a five-over-par 77, leaving her five 
over par for the tournament (149), 16 strokes behind Davies. Sorenstam, 
who shot a 71 Friday, is one over par for the tournament. Sorenstam 
would have to finish fourth or worse and Pak would have to win the 
tournament for Sorenstam to lose the player of the year title. Davies 
has no chance to win player of the year, but for two days she has 
been the best player in the Tour Championship's season-ending field. 
Entering the tournament 24th on this year's money list, Davies had 
hoped to use this weekend to make a statement that she will be a force 
in 1999. ``I want to get back to playing well,'' she said, ``and maybe 
this can be a start.'' But will Davies, who has not won on the LPGA 
tour since March 1997, hold on to her lead? ``I'm glad to be ahead, 
but you can never relax,'' she said. ``I was still nervous out there 
today. If you're not confident, you could lose it. But I'm having 
fun. This is a lot better than trying to make the cut.''
