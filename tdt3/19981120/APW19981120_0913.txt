There was an unmistakable sweet smell in the air in Budapest's downtown 
Voeroesmarty Square Friday, where a couple of hundred young people 
demonstrated against the government's plan to tighten anti-drug legislation. 
The amendment of the existing law would punish not only drug dealers, 
but also users, and the center-right government is hopeful the measure 
will help decrease drug consumption. The government is proposing that 
anyone caught with even the smallest amount of any drug could face 
time in prison. No date to discuss the proposal has been set. ``Don't 
criminalize us,'' a banner said. According to surveys, some 20 percent 
of teen-agers already have tried drugs, and more than 40 billion forints 
(dlrs 180 million) was spent on drugs in the past year. ``I smoke 
marijuana, and don't think I'm a criminal, and don't want to go to 
prison,'' said 19-year-old Robi, who didn't give his last name. Organizers 
of the demonstration agree that drug consumption should be reduced, 
but ``not by handling the question as a penal case,'' teacher Gabor 
Tajta said. It has long been debated in Hungary whether a partial 
liberalization of laws regulating the use of soft drugs, or a total 
ban on all drugs, would be desirable. This year, 28 people already 
have died from overdosing on heroin, twice as many as in 1997. ``The 
extremely low number of hard-drug addicts in the Netherlands show 
that it was a good decision from the authorities to start to differentiate 
between hard and soft drugs,'' Martin Hommenga, spokesman for the 
Dutch Health Institute, told the daily Nepszabadsag. At the end of 
the protest, demonstrators lighted candles in memory of those who 
have died from a drug overdose.
