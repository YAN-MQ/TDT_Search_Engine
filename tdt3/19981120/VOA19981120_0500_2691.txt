While we are on the subject of mood and depression, there is more 
information about how brain structure might be involved. Researchers 
at Washington University in St. Louis have found that people with 
either major depression or manic depression that runs in their families, 
have abnormally low numbers of Gleocells in an area of the brain located 
right behind the eyes. This region called the subgenual prefrontal 
cortex is involved in emotional disorders and stress. Gleocells are 
support cells for the neurons and their importance is increasingly 
becoming appreciated by brain researchers. The researchers obtain 
73 brain tissue samples from cadavers. Some of which have been people 
with depressive disorders or schizophrenia. Others of which had no 
mental illnesses. Microscopic analysis of the samples showed extremely 
low numbers of Gleocells in those who had been afflicted with major 
depression or manic illness and who had had at least one relative 
with those mood disorders. Since psychiatric medications did not seem 
to be the cause of the Gleocell losses, the team concluded that Gleocell 
loss is a factor in mood disorders that run in families. The results 
were published in the proceedings of the U.S. National Academy of 
Sciences.
