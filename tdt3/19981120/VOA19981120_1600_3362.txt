Director Alfred Hitchcock's 1954 thriller Rear Window, with Jimmy 
Stewart, has been remade into a new version to be broadcast next Sunday 
on the ABC television network. The new Rear Window has attracted special 
attention because it stars actor, Christopher Reeve, in his first 
leading role since his paralyzing horse riding accident. The story 
of Rear Window centers on a man in a wheelchair who looks through 
his neighbor's windows across the courtyard and thinks he witnesses 
a murder. With Mr. Reeve in the main role, the film's character has 
been changed from a man who is temporarily disabled with a broken 
leg, to someone with a permanent disability. Mr. Reeve's character, 
an architect known as Jason Kemp, was left a quadriplegic as a result 
of a head on auto collision. As in Hitchcock's original version, costarring 
Grace Kelly, the new Rear Window, directed by Jeff Bleckner, has a 
love interest for Mr. Reeve, actress, Daryl Hannah. Many viewers of 
the new televised version of Rear Window will be tempted to see the 
classic Hitchcock version. A recurring feature of the legendary director's 
films, is its soundtrack. We leave you with some Rear Window music, 
composed by the late German composer, Frans Waxman, who won two Oscar 
awards for his music in the film Sunset Boulevard and A Place in the 
Sun, this is Ray Freeman.
