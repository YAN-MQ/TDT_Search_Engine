Now that the Wayne Huizenga era is nearly over, the Florida Marlins' 
payroll is on the rise. Florida's catcher next season will be Miami 
native Jorge Fabregas, who is in the final year of a two-year contract 
that will pay him dlrs 1.85 million in 1999. The Marlins acquired 
him Friday from the New York Mets for right-handed reliever Oscar 
Henriquez and cash. Gregg Zaun, who made dlrs 280,000 as Florida's 
starting catcher last season, was designated for assignment Thursday. 
The Marlins' payroll sank to dlrs 13 million by the end of the season, 
but with the sale of the team to commodities broker John Henry awaiting 
approval from baseball owners, a payroll of about dlrs 24 million 
is planned for next year. The Marlins are the fifth team in two years 
for Fabregas, 29, a former Miami Hurricanes star. The 28-year-old 
Fabregas, a left-handed hitter, has a career average of .255, but 
an ankle injury limited his effectiveness and playing time last season. 
He hit .199 in 50 games for expansion Arizona and .188 in 20 games 
for the Mets. Fabregas broke into the major leagues with the California 
Angels in 1994 and was traded to the Chicago White Sox in May 1997. 
That was his best year, when he hit .258 with seven homers and 51 
RBIs in 360 at-bats. Henriquez, 24, was 0-0 with an 8.55 ERA in 15 
relief appearances with the Marlins this year. He struck out 19 in 
20 innings but allowed 26 hits and 22 runs. In addition, he was 1-0 
with a 2.56 ERA and 11 saves at Triple-A Charlotte of the International 
League.
