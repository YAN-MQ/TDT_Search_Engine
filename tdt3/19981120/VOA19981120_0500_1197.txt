Romanian tennis player, Irina Spirlea, has defeated Belgium's Dominique 
Van Roost in straight sets to advance to the semifinals of the Chase 
Championships in New York. The unseeded Spirlea beat Van Roost 6-2, 
6-3 Thursday night at Madison Square Garden. She will play again Saturday 
when she faces the winner of the Friday Quarterfinal match between 
Martina Hingis of Switzerland and Mary Pierce of France. Friday's 
other quarter final pits world number one Lindsay Davenport of the 
United States against Nathalie Tauziat of France. In the late match 
Thursday, unseeded Steffi Graph of Germany continued her return to 
form. She came back from a one set deficit to beat fifth seed, and 
fellow former world number one, Monica Seles of the United States, 
1-6,6-4, 6-4.
