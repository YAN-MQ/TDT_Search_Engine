A heavy overnight snowfall in Kosovo forced the rerouting of aid convoys 
Friday amid concerns about reaching refugees sheltered in remote villages. 
The United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees diverted three aid 
convoys carrying food, blankets and mattresses, originally destined 
for three distribution points west of Pristina, to Podujevo, about 
30 kilometers (20 miles) north of the capital, after a snowfall of 
between 20 and 50 centimeters (20 inches), said the organization's 
spokesman, Fernando del Mundo. Although UNHCR says there are no longer 
any refugees living out in the open, many are sheltering in the homes 
of friends and relatives or have managed to rebuild a warm room in 
their destroyed houses and need aid supplies to survive the winter. 
``It's going to be a major problem, especially in mountain areas,'' 
del Mundo said. ``Even in the towns and cities, people are sharing 
food with displaced people sheltering there. ... Until the next harvest, 
they will need support.'' Up to 300,000 people in the Serbian province 
of Kosovo have been left homeless since government forces cracked 
down on separatist Albanian rebels in late February. Hundreds more, 
mostly ethnic Albanian civilians, have been killed. The crackdown 
ended with an Oct. 12 agreement signed by Yugoslav President Slobodan 
Milosevic under the threat of NATO airstrikes. The separatist guerrillas 
have grudgingly accepted a cease-fire. Sporadic shooting has nonetheless 
continued, with each side blaming the other for shooting first. On 
Friday, two Serb police were killed and four others wounded in western 
Kosovo, the Serb Media Center reported. The center said Albanian rebels 
fired a mortar at the police vehicle, then opened fire from automatic 
weapons, while it was traveling a main road near the village of Prilep 
in western Kosovo. Zoran Vrbaski, 25, and Janos Cizmadzija, 45, were 
killed and four of their colleagues wounded, three of them seriously, 
the Media Center said. The report could not be independently confirmed. 
UNHCR has been sending out two to three relief convoys six days a 
week, with large convoys consisting of about 20 trucks going to the 
major distribution points three times a week. From there, the aid 
is transported to villages, using smaller vehicles. But heavy snowfall 
can cause many of the dirt tracks leading to villages to become impassable. 
Aid convoys were not the only ones affected by the snow. The principal 
ethnic Albanian leader, Ibrahim Rugova, failed to appear at his scheduled 
news conference on Friday morning due to the bad weather conditions. 
The weather bureau forecast continued snowfall until Saturday.
