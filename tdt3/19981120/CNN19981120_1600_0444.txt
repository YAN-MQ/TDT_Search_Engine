A new CNN/"USA today" Gallup poll indicates Americans are less afraid 
of becoming victims of violent crimes than they were five years ago. 
70% of those surveyed say they feel very safe alone at night in their 
homes. That's up 9% since 1993. 59% say they feel safe driving at 
night, a slight increase from five years ago. And half of all Americans 
are putting more trust in law enforcement. 55% say they are confident 
the police can protect them from violent crime. That's a 10% increase 
from 1993.
