And right now, let us get all the latest from the world of sports 
with VOA's Dave Byrd. Dave? All right. Thanks a lot Victor. National 
Basketball Association team owners and players have resumed collective 
bargaining talks in New York City today. This is the first time in 
more than three weeks that each side's full negotiating committee 
is present. So far, the labor dispute has caused the cancellation 
of the first six weeks of the season. An agreement would need to be 
reached in the next week or so in order to start the season before 
Christmas. Now why is that important? Other than the fans. Other than 
people wanting to see the best basketball players in the world. Well, 
the league would lose a multimillion dollar television contract if 
it does not get things started by around Christmas time. NBC and TNT 
have contracts with the NBA and, if there is no games being played, 
then the league has to give the hundreds of millions of dollars it 
was paid by those two networks back to the networks before anything 
else can happen. Deputy commissioner Russ Grannak, said there will 
be no new proposal from the owners, but they are prepared to negotiate. 
Players' union officials say they do not want to make any more concessions 
until owners show an inclination to compromise.
