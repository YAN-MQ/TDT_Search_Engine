It's unanimous. All 46 states and 5 territories eligible for a settlement 
with the tobacco industry have agreed to support it. The other four 
states had reached separate agreements. The announcement came this 
afternoon from the attorney general of washington state. She says 
it means "the real truth about tobacco will be available to every 
american." The states will agree not to pursue claims for the costs 
of treating smoking-related illnesses. The settlement calls for the 
four participating tobacco companies to pay $206 billion over 25 years. 
They agree to end advertising on billboards, public transportation 
and apparel, and they will pay for a national anti-smoking campaign.
