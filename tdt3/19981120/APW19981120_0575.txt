Associated Press Writer BAGHDAD, Iraq (AP) _ U.N. weapons teams went 
into the field for the third consecutive day on Friday, usually a 
day of rest in the Muslim world. ``We're going to be working seven 
days a week,'' said Caroline Cross, spokeswoman for the U.N. Special 
Commission, which oversees weapons inspections. ``We want to get on 
with things and get as much done in as short a period of time as possible.'' 
At least three U.N. vehicles left the headquarters compound on the 
edge of Baghdad and were joined, as required, by Iraqi escorts. Neither 
side has been saying much since the U.N. weapons inspectors returned 
Tuesday from Bahrain, where they had been evacuated last week amid 
fears of a U.S. missile strike. The U.N. inspectors must certify that 
Iraq has eliminated its weapons of mass destruction before the U.N. 
Security Council will lift the trade sanctions imposed after Iraq's 
1990 invasion of Kuwait. The inspectors, who generally have not worked 
on Friday, the Muslim Sabbath, refused to talk with reporters. Ms. 
Cross would not say where they were going. Charles Duelfer, deputy 
director of UNSCOM, told The Associated Press in a telephone interview 
from New York on Thursday that this was intentional. ``We're coming 
out of a crisis,'' Duelfer said. ``We're trying to keep the temperature 
down as much as possible.'' In sermons at Friday prayers, mosque preachers 
addressed the standoff that almost led to the American attack. ``We 
thank God that the crisis ended,'' said Imam Bakr al-Samerai at the 
Abdel-Khader al-Gailani Mosque. Abdel-Razak al-Saadi, preaching at 
the 14th of Ramadan Mosque, urged Arabs to ``stand by Iraq and tell 
America that we will not allow this oppression and aggression to continue.'' 
The United States and Britain had threatened military action if Iraq 
did not reverse decisions in August and October to limit the work 
of the inspectors. Iraq backed down last Saturday, pledging full cooperation 
with UNSCOM in a letter to U.N. Secretary-General Kofi Annan. Iraq 
hopes that a promised ``comprehensive review'' by the council of its 
compliance with disarmament resolutions will lead to an easing or 
lifting of the sanctions, which have limited oil sales and crippled 
the economy. But the U.S. ambassador to the United Nations, Peter 
Burleigh, made it clear earlier this week that the United States does 
not see the review as leading automatically to an end of the sanctions. 
Al-Thawra, the paper of Iraqi President Saddam Hussein's ruling Baath 
Party, on Friday quoted an unidentified Information Ministry official 
as saying Burleigh was being provocative. ``This illegal and unethical 
position toward the comprehensive review was the reason behind the 
latest crisis, and the American insistence on bringing the issue to 
the surface again means they are still working to create crises with 
Iraq,'' the official was quoted as saying. Iraq's National Monitoring 
Authority, which provides escorts for the U.N. inspectors, told the 
official Iraqi News Agency that inspectors visited seven sites Wednesday 
and even more Thursday. The teams to date have been going to previously 
designated weapons sites. In the past, they have taken Friday off. 
UNSCOM chief Richard Butler said in New York on Thursday that he had 
begun assembling teams for surprise visits, which in the past have 
been the most contentious. Butler also said he sent three letters 
to the Baghdad government seeking documents, but hadn't yet received 
a reply. ``We will test the whole spectrum of our work'' before reporting 
back to the Security Council in three to four weeks, Butler said.
