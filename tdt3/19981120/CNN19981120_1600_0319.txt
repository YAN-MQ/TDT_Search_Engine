Attorney general Janet Reno says the government has broken up the 
largest immigrant smuggling ring in U.S. history. 21 people have been 
arrested. Officials say the ring made up to $220 million by smuggling 
7,000 illegal immigrants into the United States over the last three 
years. The organizers charged the immigrants $20,000 per person, and 
sold some of them into virtual slave E. slavery.
