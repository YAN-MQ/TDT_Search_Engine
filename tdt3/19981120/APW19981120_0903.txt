Ever wanted to walk around on the arm of Leonardo di Caprio, George 
Clooney or Cindy Crawford? For those unable to realize that ambition, 
now there is at least the chance to walk around with something that 
has been on the arm of a heartthrob. A total of 75 stars of cinema, 
sport, the catwalk and politics have donated their watches for a New 
York auction to raise money for charity, watch auctioneer Antiquorum 
announced Friday. The Famous Faces Watch Auction, organized by Antiquorum 
and retailer Tourneau, will take place Feb. 24. All the money raised 
from the sale of each watch will go to a charity nominated by the 
donor. Their choices range from the Children of Chernobyl Foundation 
to the Palm Beach School of Arts. Among the watches is a ``Desert 
Storm'' watch, worn by Gen. Norman Schwarzkopf during the Gulf War. 
He told Antiquorum he always wore two watches, one on his left arm 
set to Saudi Arabian time and the watch to be auctioned on his right 
arm, set to Eastern Standard Time. Talk show host Oprah Winfrey donated 
her cherished Breguet Marine gold self-winding watch, while U.S. comedian 
Bob Hope handed over his ``red, white and blue watch'', worn on his 
Christmas tours. The idea for the sale came after a watch formerly 
owned by jazz musician Duke Ellington made dlrs 673,500 at an auction 
last year, Antiquorum marketing director Gloria Teresi said. ``It 
was an important watch, but it made an amazing price and we realized 
that the connections between celebrities and fine pieces was very, 
very magnetic.'' Although not all the watches are valuable in themselves, 
some of them will fetch six- or seven-figure sums, said Teresi. A 
display of the watches will tour Geneva, Hong Kong, Tokyo and cities 
across the United States from January.
