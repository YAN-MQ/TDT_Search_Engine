Nomura Holding America, the U.S. unit of Japan's biggest securities 
company, has named a new executive team to decide the fate of Capital 
Company of America, Nomura's once high-flying but now money-losing 
mortgage trading operation. Nomura appointed Michael Hurdelbrink, 
55, the chief operating officer of its London-based Principal Finance 
Group, to serve as chief executive of Capital Company of America. 
He replaces a team of executives headed by Ethan Penner, the star 
bond trader who resigned in September, and Boyd Fellows and Brian 
Pilcher, whose resignations were announced Friday. Capital Company 
of America specializes in making real estate loans and repackaging 
them as securities to sell to investors. The business had been a raging 
success in recent years but faltered badly in the turmoil that hit 
bond markets worldwide last summer. The subsidiary lost $800 million 
in the six months ended Sept. 30 and contributed to $1.7 billion in 
losses for Nomura's consolidated worldwide operations. The executive 
changes come as Nomura Securities ponders options for its U.S. operation, 
which in recent years used risky proprietary trading strategies to 
make big profits. Nomura said in a news release that the company was 
weighing several possibilities for Capital America but did not elaborate. 
After the recent losses were reported, Nomura officials said the firm's 
international units would de-emphasize private trading operations 
and become more like a full-service investment bank, serving clients. 
Nomura officials said recently that Guy Hands, a Nomura managing director 
based in London, had been asked to do a top-to-bottom review of Nomura's 
U.S. businesses, including Capital Company of America. Hurdelbrink 
reported to Hands in London before taking on his new role in the United 
States. Company officials said they expected some results from that 
review within a few weeks. Some rivals on Wall Street have predicted 
that the Japanese company will close or radically shrink Capital America. 
But Atsushi Yoshikawa, chief executive of Nomura Holding America, 
said Friday in a statement: ``Capital America has the full support 
and commitment of NHA.'' In October, Nomura pumped $1.2 billion in 
new equity into its U.S. operations, including Capital America, to 
help them recover. The leadership change means that most people on 
Penner's bond trading team, once among the best-paid group of traders 
on Wall Street, have left Nomura.
