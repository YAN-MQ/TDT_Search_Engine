Lots of people are making a big deal over the fact that the good citizens 
of Minnesota elected as governor a former professional wrestler by 
the name of Jesse ``The Body'' Ventura. Ventura, whose real name is 
James George Janos, beat his Republican and Democratic opponents with 
37 percent of the vote. While this would hardly qualify as a landslide 
victory _ particularly since only 61 percent of registered voters 
bothered to vote _ Ventura won fair and square, which is not always 
the case with professional wrestlers. Voters have elected sports stars 
before (Bill Bradley and Jack Kemp come immediately to mind, as does 
Ronald Reagan, who played Knute Rockne once upon a time, but that 
probably doesn't count), but this is the first time, to my knowledge, 
that voters have elected a pseudonym to high office. It is easy to 
understand how the name Jesse ``The Body'' Ventura would stick in 
voters minds better than the name James George Janos, which sounds 
like an architectural firm or, perhaps, the name you might give to 
a Little League park. When you consider how little of American politics 
is substance and how much is advertising, it's a wonder that more 
candidates haven't adopted pseudonyms as a means of getting elected 
(or staying elected). Bill Clinton might not be in the trouble he 
is today if he had run as Bill ``The Eunuch'' Clinton, rather than 
waiting for Monica to give him her own pseudonym, Bill ``The Jerkface'' 
Clinton. Newt ``The Human Ferret'' Gingrich might have extended his 
political career with a kinder, gentler pseudonym, such as Newt ``Teddy 
Bear'' Gingrich or, possibly, Newt ``The Big, Fat, Squishy Jelly Doughnut'' 
Gingrich. Candidates could also succeed by taking the more direct 
approach. You've got to believe that Bob ``Your New City Councilman'' 
Smith would be more electable than plain, old, everyday Bob Smith. 
Once elected, Bob Smith might change his pseudonym to Bob ``Indicted 
But Never Convicted'' Smith or Bob ``Don't Think of Them As Bribes, 
Think of Them as Campaign Contributions'' Smith, depending on how 
things had panned out. Unless you are a former professional wrestler 
or some other form of tough guy, it would probably not be wise to 
advertise yourself as ``The Body'' or ``The Hulk'' or anything else 
that draws attention to the fact that your idea of exercise is sitting 
through a zoning variance hearing. Once the novelty of Jesse Ventura's 
victory wears off, Minnesota voters may wish that they had elected 
a governor who had more expertise in balancing a budget than in applying 
a sleeper hold or delivering a flying drop kick. Of course, professional 
wrestling and professional politics have a lot more in common than 
some skeptics may wish to admit, and it may turn out that Gov. Ventura 
scores another surprise third-party victory when George Bush Jr. and 
Al Gore knock each other out in the 2000 presidential election. Foreign 
policy issues, particularly those pertaining to the Middle East, might 
be better solved if Yasir ``The Scorpion'' Arafat and Benjamin ``The 
Plague of Locusts'' Netanyahu simply slugged it out in the ring while 
``The Body'' acted as referee. And if one of the combatants bashed 
the other over the head with a folding chair while ``The Body'' was 
looking the other way, well, that's just the way professional wrestling 
goes. And politics. (David Grimes is a columnist for the Sarasota
