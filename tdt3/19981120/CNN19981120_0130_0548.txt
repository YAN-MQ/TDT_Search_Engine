Suspected terrorist leader osama bin laden is being linked to a plot 
to attack U.S. troops with chemical weapons. Bin laden is already 
charged with the bombings at two U.S. embassies in africa last August. 
224 people were killed. A high-ranking intelligence official says 
bin laden was close to developing poisonous gases likely to be used 
against troops in the Persian gulf. The official says after the embassy 
bombings, the U.S. destroyed the plant suspected of producing the 
chemicals.
