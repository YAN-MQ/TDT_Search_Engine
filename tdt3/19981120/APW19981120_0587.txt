The TV company Carlton Communications on Friday called off its bid 
to take over North London soccer club Arsenal. The moves comes just 
a day after angry fans turned up at a Manchester United shareholders 
meeting to oppose a takeover bid for the club by Rupert Murdoch's 
BSkyB television. Carlton announced it was involved in talks with 
Arsenal on Sept. 10, the day after BSkyB unveiled its bid for Manchester 
United. The Manchester United deal has been accepted by the team's 
board of directors, but still needs approval by the government's Monopolies 
and Mergers Commission. No price for the Carlton bid was made public, 
although a figure of 275 million pounds (dlrs 457 million) was widely 
reported. BSkyB has offered 623 million pounds (dlrs 1 billion) for 
Manchester United, the highest ever for a sports franchise. Carlton 
offered no immediate explanation for its reversal. Arsenal's stock 
price Friday was valued at 162 million pounds (dlrs 268 million), 
or 2,900 pounds (dlrs 4,800) per share.
