Israeli warplanes and artillery attacked suspected hideouts of guerrillas 
on Friday after a series of clashes in southern Lebanon. Four guerrillas 
were reported killed. In the first attack, guerrillas of the Syrian-backed 
Amal group attacked Israeli and allied militia positions in the Israeli-occupied 
zone at daybreak, Lebanese security officials said. Three guerrillas 
were killed in the assaults, an Israeli army spokesman said in Jerusalem. 
Amal claimed responsibility for the raids but said none of its fighters 
was killed. Shortly afterwards, two Israeli jets fired two air-to-surface 
missiles at targets between the villages of Toulin and Kabrigha, 14 
miles southeast of Tyre, Lebanese officials said, speaking on customary 
condition of anonymity. The strike was the 100th Israeli air raid 
on southern Lebanon this year, the officials said. Later, the Iranian-backed 
Hezbollah group launched at least two attacks on Israeli forces, including 
a roadside bomb detonated as an Israeli infantry patrol passed near 
Sojod on the edge of the occupied zone, Lebanese officials said. In 
response, Israeli and allied militia artillery pounded the Iqlim al-Tuffah 
area, a Hezbollah stronghold adjacent to the Israeli-occupied zone. 
In Jerusalem, a military spokesman said Israeli and militia forces 
attacked two groups of guerrillas who were laying land mines in the 
central and northeastern areas of the occupied zone. In the northeastern 
clash, which occurred Friday evening, at least one guerrilla was killed, 
the Israeli spokesman said. In a statement issued in Beirut, Hezbollah 
did not mention any losses, but said its fighters had inflicted ``heavy 
casualties'' on the Israeli forces. Israeli warplanes have attacked 
suspected Hezbollah bases almost daily since Nov. 8. None of the raids 
resulted in Israeli casualties. The latest clashes come at a time 
of heightened tension in southern Lebanon. On Monday, a roadside bomb 
planted by Hezbollah killed three Israeli soldiers and wounded four 
others. The casualties were the highest Israeli losses in more than 
a year. Hezbollah, or the Party of God, is leading a guerrilla war 
to try to oust 1,500 Israeli troops and their 2,500 allied militiamen 
from the zone that Israel set up in 1985 to shield its northern towns 
against cross-border guerrilla attacks.
