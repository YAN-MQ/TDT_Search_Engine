It was a sunny afternoon in Tucson last March when Mary Meeker sprinted 
past a cluster of computer executives chatting at PC Forum, an annual 
gathering of the digirati. Ms. Meeker, an analyst at Morgan Stanley 
Dean Witter, is best known for her coverage of Internet companies. 
``Mary, would you sell Yahoo when it hits $5 billion?,'' a reporter 
shouted from the crowd. Yahoo, the top-rated site that guides people 
to destinations on the World Wide Web, had already become the darling 
stock of high-technology investors. Despite tiny sales and microscopic 
profits, it had surged to a total market value of $4 billion. Ms. 
Meeker paused, looking quizzical. The reporter pressed ahead. ``How 
about $10 billion?'' he asked. ``No,'' she said. Then, throwing out 
a value that would have seemed unthinkable at the time, he barked, 
``$20 billion?'' ``If I believe in the company, I buy the stock,'' 
she answered, impatient with the question. Then she zoomed off. So, 
too, would Yahoo's stock market value. It shot past $5 billion in 
April, hopped over $10 billion in September and is now at $18.8 billion. 
And Ms. Meeker, like most of the other analysts who follow the stock, 
continues to rate Yahoo a strong buy. Almost every type of investor 
thinks about valuation in one way or another. The trick of the game, 
after all, is to buy low and sell high _ and that requires a way to 
measure if a stock price is more or less than it should be. But analysts 
and investors who are bullish on companies like Yahoo _ or on other 
new stars like Amazon.com, the bookseller, and Ebay, the on-line auctioneer 
_ are just not interested in the question of whether these stocks 
are climbing too high. If you have to ask, as they say on the Internet, 
you just don't get it. ``If we had been overly focused on value, I 
don't think we would have been able to take the leap of faith to own 
these things,'' said Pamela Cutrell, a vice president of Essex Investment 
Management, one of the few institutional investors that have been 
active in Internet stocks. Ms. Cutrell argues that Internet companies 
are growing so fast that they are bound to become more valuable. Of 
course, many investors who focus on the value question washed their 
hands of Internet companies long ago _ if they ever sullied them in 
the sector to begin with. Indeed, that has been the style of professional 
investors. ``These are not pension fund-type stocks,'' said Shaun 
G. Andrikopoulos, an analyst with BT Alex Brown. Most trading in such 
issues is in lots of a few hundred shares, indicating that individual 
investors, not mutual funds or other institutional investors, are 
the usual players. Of course, brokerage firms and their analysts cannot 
simply wash their hands of these stocks, no matter how unreasonable 
the valuations may seem. There is too much money to be made in underwriting 
the stock offerings of the endless stream of Internet companies. Some 
analysts justify their recomendations with the multiple-multiplication 
method. In this approach, the analyst forecasts continued, rapid growth 
for sales, and just maybe earnings, for the company for several years. 
Then the analyst calculates what the stock would be worth if the company 
achieved those sales forecasts and its stock traded at a certain, 
enormous multiple. A good example of this is the justification used 
two weeks ago by Rakesh Sood, the Goldman, Sachs analyst, for a report 
predicting a $150 stock price within 18 months for Ebay, a company 
that Goldman had brought public in September at $18 a share; it now 
trades at $147. The analyst estimated that the revenue of Ebay, which 
lets consumers auction their attic collectibles, would triple from 
$43 million to $126 million in 2000. If the company exceeded his published 
estimate by 50 percent (``Optimistic,'' he wrote, but hardly unthinkable) 
and it warranted a price-to-sales multiple of 35, then its stock would 
be worth $150. Others, however, don't bother with the mathematical 
contortions to back up their picks. ``Never let valuation get in the 
way of a good Internet story,'' Andrikopoulos said. ``The only way 
to look at Internet stocks is based purely with what is happening 
with the underlying fundamentals.'' Andrikopoulos used to cover computer 
stocks, to which he applied the old-fashioned idea that analysts should 
recommend selling stocks as they became over-valued. He learned his 
lesson with Yahoo's stock when he downgraded it in June 1997. After 
the stock tripled, he upgraded it last April, and it has more than 
tripled since. Now, Andrikopoulos has a buy recommendation on every 
Internet stock he covers. One analyst who argues that some small measure 
of gravity may apply even on the Internet is Paul W. Noglows of Hambrecht 
&AMP; Quist, the San Francisco brokerage firm that specializes in 
small companies. After championing Yahoo for years, Noglows dropped 
his rating to a hold in July, after its market value hit $10 billion. 
``I love Yahoo on a fundamental basis,'' he said, ``but I don't think 
its value should be the same as Viacom or CBS.'' Viacom, he said, 
is expected to post revenue of $15 billion next year, versus $315 
million for Yahoo. Noglows has become a virtual Jeremiah among Internet 
analysts because he dares to speak of value. His initial rating for 
Broadcast.com, the on-line music and news provider, was a hold, a 
shocking move since his firm was among the underwriters. ``I am a 
huge believer that the Internet will dwarf anything we have seen before,'' 
he said. ``But I don't think that people are buying these stocks to 
hold for the next 10 years. I think this is a game of the greater 
fool.''
