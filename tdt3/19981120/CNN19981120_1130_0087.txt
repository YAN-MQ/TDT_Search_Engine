Starr's appearance before the house Judiciary committee went late 
into the night yesterday. Hostile democrats and sympathetic republicans 
traded turns at bat. But the real fireworks came when the president's 
lawyer stepped up to the plate. You mentioned the experience of miss 
Lewinsky at the Ritz-Carlton on friday, January the 16th, 1998. One 
of the reasons you -- your agent -- held Ms. Lewinsky was that they 
-- I have to interrupt. That is, that premise is false. I did mean 
to be offensive. That is false, and you know it to be false. I'll 
rephrase the question. She was not held. Her own psychological state 
will speak for itself as to how she felt. It's in the record in her 
testimony. You said she was held. You didn't say how she felt. You 
said she was held and I think that's unfair to our investigators and 
this issue has been litigated, David, as you well know, with respect 
to the constitutional rights of the individual involved. Excuse me.
