Israel turned 9.1 percent of the West Bank over to full or partial 
Palestinian control on Friday. Here is a look at the next steps Israel 
and the Palestinians are to take under the land-for-security agreement 
signed last month in Washington: _Nov. 23: A joint anti-incitement 
committee convenes, aimed at deterring provocative statements on both 
sides. _Nov. 24: Palestinian airport opens. _Dec. 6: Palestinian police 
begin searches for illegal weapons. _Dec. 14: Israel withdraws from 
5 percent more of the West Bank but keeps security control over that 
area. _Mid-December: President Bill Clinton attends a meeting of the 
Palestinian National Council in Gaza, where the body is to reaffirm 
the revocation of clauses in the PLO charter calling for Israel's 
destruction. _End of January: Israel to withdraw from 6 percent more 
of the West Bank, 5 percent of which will remain under joint security 
control and 1 percent under full Palestinian control. Israel transfers 
7.1 percent of the West Bank from shared jurisdiction to Palestinian 
control.
