Parliament on Friday opened a debate on ratifying the North Atlantic 
Treaty, a necessary legal step that will allow Poland to join NATO 
next year. The government-proposed resolution, which would authorize 
President Aleksander Kwasniewski to ratify the 1949 treaty, received 
support from all political parties in parliament. Speaking to reporters 
during a break, Kwasniewski stressed that all NATO membership plans 
receive support from all major political forces in Poland. ``This 
is a guarantee that our entry into NATO is based on strong political 
agreement and widespread social backing,'' said Kwasniewski. Poland, 
along with the Czech Republic and Hungary, has been invited to join 
NATO on the pact's 50th anniversary in April, but Polish leaders and 
NATO officials have hinted the new nations could become members even 
earlier. Bronislaw Geremek, the foreign minister in the Solidarity-led 
government, stressed that NATO expansion will mean an end to the Cold 
War era division of Europe established by the Allied Conference in 
Yalta at the end of World War II, which put eastern Europe under Soviet 
domination. Ever since toppling the communists in 1989, Solidarity 
has pushed for integration with Western security and economic structures. 
Poland is also among six nations currently negotiating membership 
terms with the European Union.
