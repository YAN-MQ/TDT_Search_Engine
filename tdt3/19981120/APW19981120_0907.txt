Slobodan Milosevic's ruling party denounced NATO Friday for blaming 
both ethnic Albanian militants and Serbian security forces for the 
increase in Kosovo tensions. The target of the Socialist Party main 
board was NATO's statement Thursday which voiced ``deep concern'' 
about the upsurge in violence in Kosovo this month and condemned both 
sides in the conflict for it. ``Since the beginning of November there 
has been a sharp increase in tension resulting from incidents created, 
in some cases by Serbian security forces and in other cases by armed 
Kosovar elements,'' the statement from NATO ambassadors said. The 
Socialists, who are led by Milosevic, the Yugoslav president, said 
in a statement that NATO failed to differentiate between Kosovo Albanian 
``terrorists'' and ``legal'' Serbian forces ``which are protecting 
personal property and security of the people who live in Kosovo.'' 
``The cause of tensions in Kosovo is actions of the terrorist bandits, 
and not legal and legitimate actions of the security forces,'' the 
statement carried by the state Tanjug news agency said. Since the 
Oct. 12 deal U.S. negotiator Richard Holbrooke struck with Milosevic 
over Kosovo, there have been an increasing number of attacks in which 
Serb police or fighters from the rebel Kosovo Liberation Army have 
been killed. The Socialists also claimed that each time members of 
an international monitoring team meet Kosovo Albanian rebels, ``the 
terrorist crimes multiply'' because the ``terrorists are encouraged'' 
by such meetings.
