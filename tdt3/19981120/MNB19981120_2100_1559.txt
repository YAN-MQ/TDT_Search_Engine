Get used to the idea of the international space station, a rocket 
carrying the first component of the much-anticipated space station 
took flight early this morning. The Module, named zarya, or sunrise, 
will serve as the nerve center for the $24 billion project, is said 
to be functioning properly. This took place in Russia. NASA expects 
the space station to be completed in five years' time.
