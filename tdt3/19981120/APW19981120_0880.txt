Russia is in danger of becoming an oil importer after years of being 
one of the world's largest oil producers, a top official was reported 
as saying Friday. First Deputy Prime Minister Yuri Maslyukov, who 
is in charge of economic policy, said oil production has been falling 
for the past 10 years and urgent action was needed to reverse the 
decline, according to the Interfax news agency. Oil is Russia's largest 
source of export earnings. ``The situation in the oil sector is critical,'' 
Maslyukov said, adding that the government must take ``serious measures'' 
to resolve the industry's problems. Russian oil production is likely 
to fall to 270 million metric tons in 1999, and to 220 million metric 
tons in 2000, Maslyukov warned during a meeting with officials of 
Transneft, the operator of Russia's oil pipeline network. In 1997, 
Russia's crude oil production totaled 297 million tons. So far this 
year, crude production has been 244 million tons, 1 percent down from 
this time last year, Interfax quoted the State Statistics Committee 
as saying. The oil industry, like much of the Russian economy, is 
plagued by old and inefficient equipment, corruption and lack of funds 
for developing existing and new oil fields. Meanwhile, the Fuel and 
Energy Ministry has reduced the export quotas for six leading Russian 
oil companies because they haven't been delivering the required amount 
of crude to domestic refineries. The reductions for Rosneft, Sibneft, 
Sidanko, Slavneft, Tatneft and Onako will be reversed if the companies 
fulfill their domestic obligations, the Interfax news agency quoted 
ministry officials as saying.
