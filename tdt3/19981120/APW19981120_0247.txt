The vast business empires owned by China's military and law enforcement 
agencies will be handed over to civilians by the end of the year, 
the official newspaper China Daily reported Friday. Control of military 
businesses was being transferred to the State Economic and Trade Commission, 
which would coordinate restructuring of the enterprises, the report 
said. It contradicted earlier comments by officials and analysts who 
said they believed the process, if carried out, could not be completed 
so quickly. Beginning next year, the commission would reorganize, 
merge or close down poorly managed companies, the report added. In 
July, President Jiang Zemin ordered China's military to get out of 
business to help curb its involvement in rampant corruption and smuggling. 
So far little seems to have been done. The military is reportedly 
resisting efforts to wrest away the factories, hotels and other businesses 
it has grown to depend on for much of its livelihood. PLA businesses 
fund an estimated one-third of the military's operating expenses and 
are a pervasive force in China's commercial life, from cellular phone 
networks to karaoke halls. PLA morale is already sagging as bankrupt 
military businesses lay off employees, including many officers' wives. 
The intricate military-industrial complex also includes many firms 
that were once PLA factories but are now ostensibly supervised by 
the State Council, China's Cabinet.
