Montenegro sharply protested Friday Serbia's impounding of an independent 
weekly, saying the ``repressive'' move further deteriorates relations 
between Yugoslavia's two republics. In a letter sent to the Serbian 
and Yugoslav governments, Montenegro's Information Minister Bozidar 
Jaredic said impounding the weekly represents ``major breach'' of 
the Yugoslav constitution which calls for a free flow of information 
between the two member republics. The letter was made available to 
the Associated Press. On Thursday, Serbian police at the Montenegrin 
border confiscated and impounded all copies of the current edition 
of the Monitor weekly were to go on sale in Serbia the next day. A 
Serbian court later fined Monitor over 2.8 million dinars (dlrs 280,000) 
for breaking the republic's restrictive information law by publishing 
a picture of a clenched fist, the symbol of a Belgrade University 
student group that has called for the toppling of Yugoslav President 
Slobodan Milosevic's regime. The pro-Western Montenegrin leadership 
has been trying to distance itself from Milosevic's autocratic rule, 
and relations with Serbia have been very strained during the past 
year. In the letter, Montenegro demanded ``an urgent end to the illegal 
repressive'' moves by the Serbian authorities, warning such action 
``will further deteriorate relations'' between the two. Three independent 
Belgrade newspapers were briefly banned last month when Serbia's government 
passed a decree demanding strictly ``patriotic'' coverage of events, 
especially the ongoing crisis in Serbia's Kosovo province. The decree 
was then superseded by a restrictive media law that imposed hefty 
fines on publishers of articles that authorities deem anti-state. 
Two other leading papers have already been slapped with draconian 
fines for criticizing Milosevic's regime. Another major independent 
daily temporarily closed down to avoid the fines. Several Serbian 
newspapers tried to avert the media law by publishing in Montenegro.
