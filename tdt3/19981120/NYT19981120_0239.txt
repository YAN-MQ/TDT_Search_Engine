When ``The Bell Curve'' was published in 1994, black groups angrily 
protested the authors' suggestion that because black people score 
lower on intelligence tests, they have genetically inferior mental 
capacities. But amid the outcry, Sander Gilman spotted what he thought 
was an equally insidious assumption about Jews. Although the book 
seemed to pay Ashkenazi Jews a compliment by implying they are smartest 
because they score highest on intelligence tests, Gilman, who studies 
stereotypes, was troubled. ``I thought, `This is really scary stuff!''' 
he said. ``This pseudoscience had come back with a vengeance. Positive 
stereotypes are just as powerful a means of control as negative stereotypes.'' 
One had only to go back to the rise of anti-Semitism in Germany to 
see how ``positive'' stereotypes can become dangerous, said Gilman, 
both of whose parents lost most of their extended families in the 
Holocaust. The myth of Jewish superior intelligence was ``one of the 
arguments used by anti-Semites from the 1890s on, that Jews are over-represented 
in certain professions like law and medicine, when they were trying 
to revoke the professional privileges of German Jews,'' he explained. 
Gilman's response to ``The Bell Curve'' was ``Smart Jews,'' published 
in 1996, tracing the notion of Jewish superior intelligence from the 
19th century through contemporary popular culture. But the study of 
stereotypes is only one object of Gilman's omnivorous intellectual 
appetite. At age 53, he is one of the most prolific scholars in the 
country. He has written, contributed to or edited 58 books, some overlapping, 
on subjects from Nietzsche to the history of plastic surgery. Chairman 
of the department of Germanic studies at the University of Chicago, 
he marches fearlessly across academic boundaries, writing on body 
images of blacks, the depiction of the insane in art, on Brecht's 
Berlin. Speaking of the prolific 19th-century English novelist, Gilman 
once called himself ``the Trollope of the academy.'' His wife, Marina 
von Eckardt, said, ``At one point, I decided if someone was going 
to do an autopsy on him, they would find a filing cabinet in his brain.'' 
Although his interests seem diffuse, to Gilman there is one theme 
that links all his work: how human beings construct images of others 
to define themselves. ``All of us,'' he writes, ``men and women, poor 
and rich, black and white, spend a great deal of our psychic energy 
constantly defining and redefining who we are.'' One way people define 
themselves, Gilman says, is by measuring themselves against those 
they perceive as different. And sometimes, he says, people create 
difference where there is none to throw their own self-definition 
into relief. As a scholar, Gilman has been unafraid to examine areas 
that academics have traditionally shied away from. ``He has been at 
the vanguard of a whole contemporary interest in work on the body,'' 
said Elaine Showalter, a professor of English at Princeton, who has 
collaborated with Gilman and other scholars on a book on hysteria. 
``His work was often so new and took such unexpected turns that some 
people were shocked.'' In a 1985 paper, ``The Hottentot Venus,'' he 
wrote about how the image of the black female in the 19th century 
became a racist icon for deviant sexuality. He said some scholars 
``laced into me because they thought all I was doing was perpetuating 
these images.'' ``It's the `kill the messenger' problem,'' Gilman 
continued. ``I violate a lot of taboos. Academics have a very low 
threshold of anxiety. I've served as a lightening rod.'' From Gilman's 
interest in body images have come his studies of plastic surgery. 
Well over half his new book, ``Written on the Body: A Cultural History 
of Esthetic Surgery,'' to be published in March by Princeton University 
Press, is about the nose. Throughout history, ``good'' and ``bad'' 
images of the nose, Gilman said, show how arbitrary stereotypes are. 
Until the 19th century, nose degeneration was associated with syphilis; 
before there was a cure, some who were stricken had a cavity in the 
middle of their face because the nose had disintegrated. During the 
medieval period, Jews were associated with illness, and anti-Semitic 
images sometimes depicted Jews as having small noses because Jews 
were said to suffer from syphilis. Then ``in the 1880s and the 1890s, 
the model of the nose comes from classical art, what culture calls 
the Greco-Roman nose,'' a nose that is slightly larger and more sculptured. 
``The Germans imagined themselves as Greeks. Race was now a more powerful 
way of making a distinction between me and you than illness,'' Gilman 
said. ``Suddenly, the Jew's nose is not Roman enough, and it is seen 
to be larger or hooked or curved.'' During the wave of Irish immigration 
to England and the United States in the 19th century, the Irish, seen 
as inferior by some, were said to have pug noses. Some Irish had plastic 
surgery to make their noses conform to the Greco-Roman ideal. But 
during the 1950s, when the English actress Kay Kendall had plastic 
surgery that resulted in her having a pug nose, suddenly the pug nose 
became fashionable. Gilman said his interest in stereotypes grew out 
of his childhood in New Orleans. His mother was born in Poland; his 
father, a truck driver, was American-born of Russian descent. Gilman 
said he grew up as a ``double outsider, between white and black.'' 
``Even though I may have appeared white,'' he said, ``I was along 
this fissure line because being a Jew in the South was not being white.'' 
The Ku Klux Klan was both anti-Jewish and anti-black. Not only that, 
but he was also acutely aware of the class distinctions between New 
Orleans' well-established German Jewish community and its newer Eastern 
European Jews. Even within his group, Gilman said, he ``realized that 
some people were whiter than other people.'' His sense of the power 
of stereotypes was heightened by the civil rights movement when as 
a teen-ager he was involved in sit-ins in New Orleans and ``I saw 
what ugly stereotypes could do.'' He understood, he said, that laws 
could be changed, but that wouldn't change stereotypes. During the 
1970s, Gilman came across photographs of insane people from the 19th 
century. ``There was a theory in the 19th century that crazy people 
always look different.'' As a result, he wrote ``Seeing the Insane,'' 
about images of the insane in painting and photography. With ``Seeing 
the Insane,'' ``I started thinking about broader questions of stereotyping, 
the psychology of what happens when stereotypes begin to be internalized.'' 
He realized, he said, that he had been avoiding the personal stake 
he had in his scholarship, his own Jewishness. He began studying how 
Jews responded to stereotypes of themselves. ``Jewish Self-Hatred: 
Anti-Semitism and the Hidden Language of the Jews,'' published in 
1986, was a study of Jewish writers from the 15th century to the present. 
``In every case, the Jew is told either directly or implicitly that 
because he is inherently different, he can never have command of the 
language of the culture. One reaction is to become better than, not 
just as good as.'' Heinrich Heine, who because he was a Jew could 
supposedly never master the language of Goethe, became the most important 
lyric poet of the 19th century. Contemporary Jewish writers like Woody 
Allen and Philip Roth have solved the problem of their split identity 
as writers by mocking their dilemma, Gilman says. ``In the mid-'80s, 
I got interested in intelligence and race,'' Gilman said. He points 
out that intelligence testing in the United States grew out of panic 
at the number of Eastern European Jews and southern Italians entering 
the United States in the early part of the century. The tests were 
used to keep ``mental defectives'' out of the country, some of them 
simply immigrants who couldn't speak English. Intelligence became 
equated with goodness, Gilman said. ``There is the assumption that 
dumb people steal cars, and smart people are good.'' All too easily, 
the notion of Jewish ``intelligence'' has been transformed into ``cunning,'' 
a construct sometimes internalized by Jews themselves. In ``Smart 
Jews'' Gilman examines the way the notion of Jewish intelligence sometimes 
goes along with notions of physical weakness or sexual inadequacy. 
The central character in F. Scott Fitzgerald's 1940 novel ``The Last 
Tycoon'' is Monroe Stahr, modeled after Irving Thalberg. He is brilliant 
and handsome but also sickly. He is depicted as ``a parvenu,'' and 
``his sickliness and his failure at love and sex compensate for his 
Jewish superior intelligence,'' Gilman writes. Such stereotypes are 
also in some ways the result of assimilation, Gilman said. ``Jews 
will become one more group which is incredibly diverse. I think it's 
a great anxiety,'' Gilman said, ``on the part of both the culture 
at large and of Jews themselves. The more Jews become like everybody 
else, the more invisible they are. If you think of different as dangerous, 
you want to know where they are. The great danger to do with Jewish 
identity has to do with normalization.''
