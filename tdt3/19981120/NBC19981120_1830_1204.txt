Now to some very important health information for men, about prostate 
cancer. It is, of course, one of the most common cancers to strike 
men. The good news is, if prostate cancer is caught early, it is often 
completely curable. But how should it be treated? That's a continuing 
controversy. Here's NBC chief science correspondent Robert Bazell. 
For these men along with more than 107,000 every year, a critical 
decision -- You don't have to die from this disease, there are treatments. 
They have early-stage prostate cancer. It has not yet spread. What 
next? Surgery, radiation, or perhaps even nothing at all. If you go 
to a surgeon, he's going to recommend surgery. If you go to a radiation 
oncologist, he's going to want to give you radiation. Conflicting 
opinions from the experts leave men on their own. Surgery remains 
the top choice with about a 70% chance of stopping the cancer from 
returning within ten years, but the downside -- more than 20% have 
become incontinent. And more than 50% have become impotent. John Marino, 
72, chose the newest technique -- radioactive seed implants to kill 
cancer cells. I've talked to different people, and to what I can see, 
in my case, seed implant would be the best thing. The latest studies 
show radioactive seeds have far fewer side effects and work as well 
as surgery for ten years. But beyond that, no one knows. Right now, 
men that opt for implant therapy are taking somewhat of a risk in 
that they don't know what the long-term outcome is going to be. When 
he was diagnosed four years ago, syd parlow, 76, chose the riskiest 
course of all, doing nothing, called "watchful waiting." Parlow accepts 
the greater chance the cancer will spread in exchange for escaping 
the side effects of treatment. You have to balance quality of life, 
versus length of life. And frankly, my tendency is to opt for quality 
of life. At first glance doing nothing might seem foolish. But in 
fact, the majority of prostate cancers grow so slowly they never threaten 
a man's life. It's very hard to know by looking at a tumor right now 
in an individual whether this is a cancer that is likely to progress 
or not likely to progress in that person's lifetime. And that's exactly 
the problem that scientists are working hardest to solve -- which 
treatment if any is best in the early stages. For men like John Marino 
and syd parlow, it's a critical decision, because if the cancer does 
spread it becomes life threatening and there are even fewer choices.
