Israel started handing over land in the West Bank to the Palestinians 
today in accordance with the agreement signed last month in the United 
States. But the redeployment of Israeli troops hit a snag. It was 
briefly held up when the Palestinians questioned last-minute Israeli 
changes in the redeployment map. The problem reportedly has been resolved. 
The pullback will give the Palestinians an additional 1% of the West 
Bank.
