Teachers here defied a judge's back-to-work order Friday and extended 
their strike to a second day, crippling the state's second largest 
school district, where five public high schools were closed and grammar 
schools were open only half a day. The attendance rate at grammar 
schools was 30 percent, down from the usual 90 percent, district officials 
said. But the day was relatively peaceful compared with Thursday, 
when several schools descended into chaos because there were too few 
substitute teachers to supervise the students. Much of the trouble 
Thursday _ including fights in the hallways, students overturning 
furniture and throwing bricks and bottles, and the looting and vandalizing 
of businesses _ occurred in and around the high schools. School officials 
returned to court Friday and persuaded Hudson County Superior Court 
Judge Martin Greenberg to fine the Jersey City Education Association, 
the union representing the striking teachers, $100,000 a day for each 
day it defied his back-to-work order. A negotiating session is scheduled 
for Sunday afternoon, said Schools Superintendent Richard DiPatri. 
But he added that if an agreement is not reached, the district will 
seek to impose fines against individual union members, too. ``I think 
we're talking about money here,'' DiPatri said about the concerns 
of the union, which, among other things, include a call for a pay 
raise in a new three-year contract. ``I cannot succumb to demands 
that I think are outrageous.'' In spite of the judge's order Thursday 
that they return to work, teachers picketed the schools Friday morning, 
holding signs criticizing DiPatri, whose management they say is at 
the heart of their strike. ``This superintendent has said publicly 
that every teacher should come to work with a little anxiety, and 
that every principal should have twice as much anxiety,'' said Thomas 
Favia, the president of the union, which represents 2,500 teachers 
and 1,000 support personnel. ``In my 42 years here, I have never seen 
an atmosphere of fear more prevalent in our district.'' The district 
has been under state control for 10 years because of poor performance, 
but union members say that DiPatri is the only superintendent since 
the takeover who has driven them to strike. ``Money is not the issue,'' 
Favia said. A teacher in the Jersey City system earns, on average, 
$58,254, compared to the statewide average of $52,000, district officials 
said, and the union is seeking a pay raise of 5.2 percent in each 
of the three years. At a press conference this morning, Police Director 
Michael Moriarty said about 50 police officers were assigned to the 
schools in the two days of the strike _ about twice the normal contingent. 
In addition, the Board of Education has hired about 60 or so off-duty 
officers at $25 an hour. But he said more security personnel could 
not have prevented the bedlam that erupted inside the schools Thursday. 
The district had only about 200 substitute teachers on hand _ even 
though they knew for weeks the teachers might strike _ to oversee 
36 schools with an enrollment of 36,000. Mayor Bret Schundler on Friday 
urged teachers to go back to work, and he appealed to the school administration 
to work harder to recruit enough substitute teachers to avoid Thursday's 
chaos. ``There's three things that the mayor can do,'' Schundler said. 
``You can encourage the teachers to go back to work; you can provide 
the resources to make sure there's a safe environment for the students; 
and you can appeal to the community to support the schools.'' Teen-agers 
who were walking around the city's downtown during what would normally 
have been school hours said they were told to listen to the radio 
to find out whether there would be class Monday. Carmelo Valez, 17, 
a sophomore at Dickinson High School, and his friend Richard Gonzalez, 
17, a senior at Ferris High School, spent the gray day on Friday in-line 
skating downtown. They said they knew they would have to make up these 
missed days in June. ``We're going to trade a nasty day for a good 
day,'' Valez said. At a rally around noon Friday, teachers celebrated 
their unity, saying that about 98 percent of the membership of the 
union had stayed off the job to show their support for its position 
on the new contract. The issue that most teachers have brought up 
is the practice, introduced under DiPatri, of having teams of educators 
enter classrooms unannounced to evaluate teachers, and then not giving 
the teachers a chance to respond to the teams' written report. They 
also said they are also opposed to the district's proposal to extend 
the school year by two days, and the school day by 15 minutes, while 
cutting the lunch period to 30 minutes from the current 45 minutes. 
``I believe in my profession,'' said Oscar Velez, who teaches health 
and basic skills to seventh and eighth graders. ``I believe we are 
professionals. But I believe we are being treated in a childlike and 
condescending manner.''
