A Rome court freed a Kurdish rebel leader on Friday pending a ruling 
on his appeal for political asylum from Turkey, drawing immediate 
threats of retaliation against Italy by angry Turkish leaders. Hundreds 
of Abdullah Ocalan's supporters danced in a central piazza at news 
of his release from a military hospital in Rome, where Ocalan had 
been held since his flight landed at Rome's international airport 
on Nov. 12. In Turkey, Prime Minister Mesut Yilmaz told Turks to stay 
calm, saying, ``the Turkish government will resolve this situation.'' 
``Every wrong turn has a very hard price to pay, and the Turkish state 
is powerful enough to make them pay that price,'' he said of Italian 
leaders. Yilmaz also appealed to NATO for support in the clash between 
the two NATO partners, calling Ocalan ``the worst terrorist of the 
century.'' Ocalan leads the Kurdistan Workers Party, or PKK, which 
has fought a 14-year-old war for autonomy for Kurds in Turkey's southeast. 
The conflict has killed 37,000 people. Turkey has demanded his extradition, 
but Italy's law prohibits it from extraditing someone to a country 
where he may face the death penalty, as is the case with Ocalan. Italian 
Premier Massimo D'Alema insisted he wouldn't be intimidated. ``We 
will apply the decisions of the courts,'' D'Alema told reporters during 
a visit to Florence. Germany announced Wednesday that it would not 
seek the extradition of Ocalan, who also has been wanted in Germany 
on charges of terrorism since 1990. The decision meant Italy no longer 
needed to detain Ocalan on the German-issued arrest warrant. ``It 
is clear that we will review our economic and trade relations with 
a government, which by keeping the murderer of 30,000 people and providing 
him haven, is becoming an accomplice to his crimes,'' Turkey's defense 
minister Ismet Sezgin said from Ankara. ``I am amazed,'' Turkey's 
ambassador to Italy, Inal Batu, told the AGI news agency. ``The head 
of a terrorist organization, a notorious assassin is treated by your 
country like a welcome guest.'' In a written statement, Ocalan appealed 
to the thousands of Kurds who have traveled to Rome in a show of solidarity 
to return home and sustain the Kurdish cause through legal and democratic 
means. ``I don't want our people to keep protesting and setting themselves 
on fire and I don't want any behavior that might reflect badly on 
the Kurdish people,'' said the statement read by a Kurdish spokesman 
in Rome, Akif Hasan. Italy's refusal to turn over Ocalan has infuriated 
Turks. Protesters have burned Italian flags outside the Italian Embassy 
in Turkey and launched a boycott of Italian goods. Foreign Minister 
Lamberto Dini denounced the boycott, calling the action ``an aggression 
against all of Europe.'' Friday's court decision said Ocalan is free 
to move around Rome but he will have to notify authorities of any 
plans to leave his residence. Ocalan's camp has said it expects a 
ruling on the asylum request in about a month.
