Three French police officers were suspended Friday pending the results 
of an investigation into the suspicious death of a Zairian man who 
died during questioning earlier this month. Sidney Manoka, a 25-year-old 
boxer who had been living for 14 years in France, was detained by 
police on Nov. 6 in Tourcoing, northern France, after getting into 
an altercation with another driver. Two police officers demanded Manoka's 
papers, but he refused to comply after which reiforcements were brought 
in. He was then handcuffed and made to lie on the ground, according 
to police records. Soon after he lost consciousness. An autopsy later 
revealed that Manoka died of suffocation. Interior Minister Jean-Jack 
Queyranne announced the suspensions in a statement.
