A federal judge has ordered a trial in the wrongful death civil lawsuit 
against former au pair Louise Woodward. Woodward was convicted of 
second-degree murder last year in connection with the death of 8-month-old 
Matthew Eappen. But a judge reduced that verdict to involuntary manslaughter 
and sentenced her to time already served in prison. Thursday, a judge 
ruled Woodward may be liable for punitive damages.
