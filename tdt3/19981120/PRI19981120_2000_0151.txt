46 states have unanimously approved a $206 billion deal offered by 
the tobacco industry to treat smoking-related illnesses. The settlement 
includes $2 billion to fund anti-smoking campaigns aimed at teenagers. 
The World's David Laballey reports. Referring to the biggest civil 
settlement in U.S. history, the state of Washington's attorney general 
called today a great day and took a jab at the tobacco industry, saying 
Joe Camel and his ilk are in intensive care. The $206 billion settlement 
requires the four major tobacco companies to make payments to 46 states 
over 25 years and to finance anti-smoking programs. That's in exchange 
for dropping all outstanding health claim lawsuits. From the year 
2000 on, smoking ads on billboards will be banned as will be cartoon 
characters and merchandise that promotes smoking.
