A shaggy Hungarian sheepdog, the family pet of French actor Alain 
Delon, has disappeared from his Swiss home. ``My children grew up 
with the dog and they miss him the most,'' Delon's wife, Rosalie, 
was quoted Friday as telling the Geneva daily Le Temps. Five-year-old 
Pouki, a Hungarian puli described as having ``Bob Marley dreadlocks,'' 
went missing from the house in suburban Thonex on Monday, according 
to notices posted in Geneva by Mrs. Delon. She said the medium-sized 
black dog was a present to her on the birth of her son, Alain-Fabien, 
four years ago. He and his sister Anoushka, 8, miss the dog very much, 
said Mrs. Delon. Heartthrob actor Delon, now 63, was the star of numerous 
films, including ``Is Paris Burning?,'' ``Girl on a Motorcycle'' and 
``Rocco and his Brothers.'' Earlier this week he lost a bid in France 
to block publication of a biography which alleges links between him 
and shady politicians, mob figures and mercenaries.
