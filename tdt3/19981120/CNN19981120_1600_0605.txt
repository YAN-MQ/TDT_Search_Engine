1 1/2 million people have died in Sudan as a result of civil war or 
famine. Tim ewart has more in a report that has images some viewers 
may find disturbing. It is a place where death is never far away. 
Where life hangsly a thread. A place, too, of bitter irony. Rains, 
which have swollen the river and flooded fields have come too late 
for a harvest ruined by drought. The result is upwards of 50,000 people 
dependent on foreign aid. Most have fled here to escape civil war 
in the surrounding countryside. Nearly 6,000 are living in the open. 
Clogging streets in the town's center. This is a place where hope 
like food is in short supply, and what matters here is replacing aid 
with self-sufficiency. It's hard to see at the moment how that's going 
to happen. Food flights arrive daily at a landing strip where a wrecked 
Russian aircraft is a reminder of how perilous a business this can 
be. It's a lifeline that must be maintained. You must feed these people 
for another year. Exactly. Exactly. And we hope all the international 
communities will support us to make sure these people are fed till 
next year. And if that support doesn't come, these people will die? 
Definitely. They will starve to death. And nearby, at a place called 
a wheel, a lone British aid worker, rachel, runs a compound for malnourished 
children. Like this young man, 18 months, weight, 10 pounds. That's 
life threatening. If the children don't receive food within a few 
days, they almost certainly are going to die. Is the only food they're 
getting food that's being sent from outside. Most of the feed these 
children are geting is food from outside. That's why they're here. 
Nevertheless, conditions are improving. In the summer, 100 people 
a day died of hunger in wau. Now it's fewer than 10. There are glimpses 
of a better life. Hoemts when the horrors fade. They quickly return. 
People here suffered civil war for 18 years. And peace and something 
approaching the normal life can seem like a distant prospect. Tim 
ewart, itn at wau in southern Sudan.
