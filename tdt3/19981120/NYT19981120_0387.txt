Under the threat of legal action by representatives of J.D. Salinger, 
the Film Society of Lincoln Center announced Friday that it was canceling 
a screening of an Iranian film adapted from Salinger's 1961 book ``Franny 
and Zooey.'' The film, ``Pari,'' was to have been shown Friday night 
as part of three-week festival of Iranian cinema. But Richard Pena, 
the programming director for the film society, said his organization 
had received a letter Monday warning that screening the film would 
constitute a breach of copyright. ``They said essentially there was 
no authorization for the adaptation,'' Pena said. ``We really had 
no choice but to cancel.'' Pena said the film, made in 1995, had been 
shown at festivals in Europe and at a retrospective at Lincoln Center 
in 1996. ``It was assumed there was no prohibition on the film,'' 
he said. ``It's been around for a while.'' But R. Andrew Boose, a 
lawyer for Salinger, said the reclusive writer had only learned of 
the film's existence last week after several published articles, including 
one in The New York Times, referred to the connection between ``Pari'' 
and ``Franny and Zooey.'' ``We're not looking for publicity,'' Boose 
said. ``They simply did not seek permission from the copyright owner 
of the novel.'' Under federal and international copyright law, the 
copyright holder has exclusive rights over the original and any derivative 
work, including translations, dramatizations and adaptations. The 
legal definitions are not exact, however, and knotty disputes are 
common, as evidenced recently in the battle over ``Lo's Diary,'' a 
takeoff on Vladimir Nabokov's novel ``Lolita,'' told from Lolita's 
point of view. Its publication was halted in the United States after 
a lawsuit was filed alleging copyright infringement. ``Pari,'' directed 
by Dariush Mehrjui, tells the story of three brothers and a sister 
confronting the issues of art and religion in contemporary Iran. In 
the film, the action of the sister, Pari, mirrors that of Salinger's 
character Franny, including her troubled relationship with her fiancee. 
Mehrjui, who is one of his nation's most respected filmmakers, said 
he was stunned by the cancellation. ``This reaction is really quite 
bewildering,'' he said. ``I don't want to distribute the film commercially. 
It's a kind of cultural exchange. I just want to let the film be seen 
for the critics and the people that follow my work.'' The director 
said the film was indeed ``loosely based'' on ``Franny and Zooey,'' 
but he added that he had written to Salinger seeking permission to 
use the material before making the movie. ``I wrote him a letter indicating 
that I was just a small filmmaker doing an adaptation,'' he said. 
``But I did not hear back, so I just continued and made it,'' he said. 
This week's action is not the first Salinger has taken to protect 
his work and his privacy. In the 1980s he won a much publicized case 
to prevent the publication of a biography by Ian Hamilton, who had 
sought to use portions of Salinger's unpublished correspondence. More 
recently, Salinger's literary and legal representatives shut down 
a Web site devoted to the work of the writer, whose most famous novel, 
``The Catcher in the Rye,'' is a staple of high school and college 
classrooms nationwide. Salinger's literary agent, Phyllis Westberg, 
president of Harold Ober Associates, did not return calls for comment 
Friday. For Mehrjui, who said he fell in love with Salinger's writing 
while he was an exchange student in California in the early 1960s, 
the decision held some ironic value. ``In our country, we don't have 
copyrights,'' he said. ``We feel free to read and do whatever we want.''
