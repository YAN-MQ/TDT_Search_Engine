U.S. special prosecutor, Kenneth Starr, has concluded his testimony 
before congress in which he accused President Clinton of lying under 
oath and obstructing justice. Mr. Starr's appearance before the House 
Judiciary Committee Thursday lasted more than 10 hours. During which 
he faced questioning from Mr. Clinton's supporters. The special prosecutor 
accused the president of violating his oath of office when he lied 
about his affair with Monica Lewinski. He also said Mr. Clinton repeatedly 
abused his presidential powers by what he described as attempts to 
block an investigation into the matter. The evidence suggests that 
the president repeatedly used the machinery of government and the 
powers of his high office to conceal his relationship. The inquiry 
by the House Judiciary Committee is to determine whether the President 
should be impeached for his behavior in the Monica Lewinski affair 
and matter.
