More people are using the Internet to find airline fares. Are they 
actually buying tickets online? Lori Waffenschmidt finds out in this 
edition of "working ahead." They lure travelers with bonus frequent 
flier miles and discounts. Many find travel web sites indispensable 
trip tools. Just last year, industry gurus cast doubts online travel 
would ever take off. But the numbers prove otherwise. Last year, travelocity 
did well over $100 million in sales, and we're going to do more than 
twice that this year. Right now, we're booking almost 50% of all reservations 
on the Internet. Jupiter communications predicts online travel spending 
will exceed $2 billion this year. In 2002, we think that about $12 
billion in travel will be booked online. What's gratifying to us is 
to see the repeat purchase rate. Our customers are coming back very, 
very frequently to book more and more of their trips online. Airline 
tickets are what most people buy. It's a fairly simple purchase. A 
hotel, it's a little bit less certain what you're getting. As much 
as bookings have increased there is still much uncertainty about buying 
online. Only about 2% of all travel purchased is completed on the 
Internet. And a phocuswright study says, even when it comes to "wired" 
travelers, only 18% actually buy online. The rest just look, then 
call their travel agent or the airlines. Consumers hesitate putting 
credit card numbers on the Internet. That's why msn expedia and travelocity 
use secure technology and offer guarantees. We will pay the first 
$50 of any problem that might occur with a credit card. Which could 
narrow the gap between the number of lookers and bookers. Lori Waffenschmidt, 
CNN, reporting.
