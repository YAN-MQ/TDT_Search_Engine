Americans are giving mixed reviews to the presidential impeachment 
hearings. Jennifer Auther sampled public opinion in southern California. 
Television networks carried it live. In the process, we uncovered 
substantial and credible evidence of serious legal wrongdoing by the 
president. Some people clearly wished they had more time to watch 
history unfold. Perjury, it's a serious crime, because it strikes 
at the heart of the system. I think Starr's doing a good job. You 
hear about these things in history, and it needs to happen. Then there 
are those who would Hang their hat on these words -- I say to my republican 
colleagues that the irony is that the harder you try to win the war, 
the more you lose the hearts and minds of the American people. The 
end result is going to be a lot of waste of time, effort, and money. 
When it is all over, he will still be president. I wish the thing 
would be over with. I really don't care anymore. There is a sense 
of embarrassment that President Clinton's infidelity has led to this. 
There's a word in yiddish, it's "schande." And German, ak they need 
to leave the guy alone. I think this has gone on far enough. Or it 
may resemble the O.J. Simpson saga. People say they won't watch. Most 
say they don't care. The question is -- will TV ratings reveal something 
else? Jennifer Auther, CNN, Los Angeles.
