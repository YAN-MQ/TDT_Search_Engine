An Italian court of appeals on Friday rejected Turkey's request for 
the extradition of a Kurdish rebel leader, deepening tensions between 
Italy and Turkey. The Kurd, Abdullah Ocalan, was arrested last week 
while seeking to enter Italy. Now he is to be released from detention 
in a military hospital and put under house arrest while Italy considers 
his request for political asylum. Prime Minister Massimo D'Alema had 
already said Italy would not hand Ocalan over to Turkey, citing an 
Italian law that prohibits extradition of prisoners to countries that 
have the death penalty. But the court ruling _ and the easing of Ocalan's 
detention _ infuriated Turkish officials, who regard Ocalan, leader 
of the Kurdistan Workers Party, as a terrorist and public enemy No. 
1. The 14-year-old conflict between Kurdish separatists and Turkish 
troops in southeastern Turkey has claimed more than 35,000 lives. 
``Italy is attempting to make peace with terrorism,'' Prime Minister 
Mesut Yilmaz of Turkey said after hearing the court's ruling. ``It 
faces the danger of earning Turkey's eternal hostility.'' He added: 
``The Italian government is making mistake after mistake. Every mistake 
will certainly have a very heavy price.'' The Turkish defense minister, 
Ismet Sezgin, told Reuters Friday that Turkey might reconsider military 
industry projects with Italy. The Italian company Finmeccanica was 
a strong favorite to win a $3.5 billion tender to build attack helicopters 
for the Turkish military. Turkey has already begun unofficial boycotts 
of Italian goods, and demonstrations in Ankara and Istanbul have included 
Turkish protesters burning Italian-made silk ties to illustrate their 
point. Until recently, Italy and Turkey maintained good relations. 
Italy was one of the few European nations strongly favoring Turkey's 
inclusion in the European Union. Turkey is particularly upset because 
D'Alema has not ruled out granting Ocalan political asylum, which 
many leftists in his coalition favor. The United States, which requested 
that Italy extradite Ocalan to Turkey, has also expressed its opposition 
to political asylum for Ocalan. If Italy grants him asylum, the move 
would inflame an already tense diplomatic standoff. Diplomats in Rome 
suspect that Italy will postpone any such decision for as long as 
possible. While a commission in the Italian Interior Ministry considers 
Ocalan's application, the Kurdish leader will have to stay in Rome, 
and will have to notify the authorities any time he leaves his residence. 
D'Alema, who complained this week about the lack of support from other 
European nations, may seek it next week, when he is expected to travel 
to Brussels, Paris and Bonn for meetings with his counterparts. The 
court of appeals originally said Ocalan would have to remain in Italian 
custody pending an arrest warrant from Germany. But Germany, which 
issued a warrant for Ocalan on homicide charges in 1990, said Friday 
that it would not for the moment press Italy for his extradition. 
Germany is home to 2 million Turks, a quarter of them ethnic Kurds, 
and seems reluctant to create new domestic tensions by bringing Ocalan 
to trial. Essentially, Germany seems happy for now to let Italy take 
the heat. ``Beyond the legal aspects of extradition,'' a German government 
spokesman, Uwe-Karsten Heye, said Friday, ``there is a complex political 
problem which can hardly be treated justly as a matter of formal international 
extradition procedures.''
