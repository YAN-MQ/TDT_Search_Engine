Before the Judiciary committee adjourned for the night, they met in 
closed session. They moved to extend the inquiry into the Kathleen 
Willey case, a former White House aide who claims President Clinton 
groped her. Subpoenas were approved for Willey's attorney and an acquaintance 
of hers, major democratic donor Nathan Landow. The committee also 
wants to talk to presidential advisers Robert Bennett and Bruce Lindsey.
