President Clinton and Prime Minister Keizo Obuchi of Japan ended two 
days of talk and ceremony here Friday night with an affirmation of 
their national partnership but no evidence of progress on trade and 
other economic disputes that are festering between their countries. 
While he appealed to the Japanese to have patience with Obuchi's plan 
to revive the economy, Clinton gave little sign of such patience himself 
or of optimism that the plan would be enough. ``Sometimes when you 
have to turn a country around it takes more than you think in the 
beginning,'' Clinton said, standing beside Obuchi to address reporters 
Friday evening. Under pressure from the United States, Obuchi announced 
on Monday a $195 billion package of spending and tax cuts to increase 
investment and consumer demand. The markets shrugged, and in a meeting 
Friday with private economists here, the most optimistic forecast 
for the Japanese economy heard by Clinton advisers was that it would 
shrink by only 1 percent next year. Standing with Clinton, Obuchi 
predicted ``positive growth'' next year. But Deputy Treasury Secretary 
Lawrence Summers offered a dimmer view at a subsequent briefing. ``The 
recognition that there is a risk of slow or negative growth is why 
there's a view that it may be necessary over time to do more,'' Summers 
said. In the morning Clinton suggested that a surge in exports to 
the United States of certain types of Japanese steel might stem from 
illegal trade practices. He raised the issue in the afternoon in meetings 
with Obuchi but received no specific assurances that Obuchi would 
address the problem, Summers said. Summers said that Clinton's concerns 
over steel ``were very clearly heard'' and that the Japanese showed 
an ``awareness here of the importance of making sure that trade is 
by the rules in steel and other sectors.'' In his unusually blunt 
speech, to the American Chamber of Commerce, Clinton warned of the 
possibility of ``retaliatory protectionism,'' saying that protectionist 
sentiment could rise in the United States if its trade deficit continued 
to grow while Japan resisted opening its markets. Japan has frustrated 
the Clinton administration's hopes to liberalize trade this year in 
nine specific economic sectors, including timber and fishing. The 
president said Friday that he now hoped to achieve that goal next 
year. The leaders also devoted 45 minutes to security, including what 
Clinton in his public remarks called ``disturbing signs'' in North 
Korea. The administration, which has been criticized in the region 
as letting its policy on North Korea drift, is worried that North 
Korea may be preparing to build a plant for nuclear weapons at a vast 
new underground site, in violation of a 1994 agreement. The United 
States wants to inspect the site, but the North Koreans informed an 
American representative this week that they would grant such an inspection 
only in exchange for hundreds of millions of dollars. In his remarks 
to reporters, Clinton called such conditions ``completely unacceptable.'' 
He said North Korea's intentions remained mysterious and that it was 
unclear whether ``they're attempting to get more money out of various 
countries for doing what they ought to be doing anyway or whether 
they really are moving toward a more hostile posture.'' Clinton flew 
Friday night for a two-day visit to South Korea.
