And the United States is inviting about 50 nations and organizations 
to attend a conference later this month, in which it hopes to raise 
billions of dollars to support the latest peace accord between Israel 
and the Palestinians. Now, as part of the agreement, Washington has 
pledged to help pay the cost of Israel's next troop redeployment whenever 
it may come. VOA's Nick Symeone reports the Clinton administration 
is looking for other nations to help pick up the costs. Israel alone 
is widely believed to be requesting $1 billion to help pay for security, 
road construction, and other costs associated with its troop withdrawal 
from the West Bank. The Palestinians are expecting a generous amount 
of foreign aid as well. With such a high price tag for peace, the 
Clinton administration is rounding up as many donors as possible hoping 
to raise billions of dollars in new aid and to review past pledges 
of international help for the peace process. State department spokesman, 
James Rubin, about the conference, beginning on November 30. We will 
officially launch a second five-year phase of the assistance effort 
and call on additional donations by international donors to pledge 
enhanced higher levels of assistance for this next phase. For our 
part, the administration hopes to increase U.S. assistance to the 
Palestinians significantly over the next five years. Five hundred 
million dollars was pledged to the Palestinians five years ago. This 
compares to nearly $3 billion dollars in U.S. aid that Israel receives 
each year. Dory Gould, Israel's ambassador to the United Nations says 
implementing the Wye Agreement will be costly. DORY GOULD, There is, 
obviously, the more extensive you make a further redeployment, then 
obviously, the requirements of Israel in terms of making these redeployments 
safe for both the state of Israel in terms of the IDF and the Israel 
defense forces and in terms of the special bypass growth that was 
to be put there for Israelis. Obviously, those figures go up. And 
we have to, obviously, work out an arrangement to address these requirements. 
What ever new aid the United States pledges to both sides will be 
worked out in negotiations with the Congress, which has cut back on 
some aid to the Jewish State. Nick Symeone, VOA News in Washington.
