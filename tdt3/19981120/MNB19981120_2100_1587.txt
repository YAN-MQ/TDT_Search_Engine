Time for a look at the weather across the country. Janice huff? Hi, 
Brian. It's a rainy night here on the east coast of the matter of 
fact up and down the eastern seaboard we're tracking a cold front, 
rain mainly from Norfolk, virginia, northward tonight. Ending as the 
storm system moves offshore. A patch of show in the Great Lakes. But 
the big story is the storm moving across the pacific northwest, washington, 
Oregon, and northern California seeing heavy rain and snow in the 
higher elevations. This is snoqualmie pass, Washington. Much of the 
snow has fallen above the 5,000 foot level. It's difficult getting 
that all off the cars. Snow advisories and winter storm warnings in 
effect. You will need chains in the higher elevations of Washington 
state as well as Oregon. See the clouds rolling east into Idaho and 
Montana with that system. Also heavy rain over parts of south Texas 
and along the gulf coast. Cooler temperatures on the way. Right now, 
39 degrees in Pittsburgh, 25 in Minneapolis. Temperatures remain mild 
over southern California and south Florida. Miami in the 70's. Most 
of the nation will be in the denies teens, 20's and 230's. Highs tomorrow, 
60's north into sections of eastern Montana, very mild for this time 
of year. Cool over the rest of the northern tier of states. Minneapolis 
45, Chicago 49. Chilly in the northeast tomorrow. 72 in Los Angeles, 
82 in Phoenix. Should be a nice day there. Windy, snowy, wet weather 
for the pacific northwest tomorrow. Monday, not much chasmse the storm 
system remains stateary and most of the southern half will be warm. 
Thanks.
