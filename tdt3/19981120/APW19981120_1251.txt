A group of neighborhood organizations on Friday became the latest 
party to file a lawsuit against Gen. Augusto Pinochet. The group accuses 
him of involvement in the deaths of 76 of its members during his regime. 
The move by the Metropolitan Federation of Communal and Neighboring 
Organizations raised to 14 the number of lawsuits pending in Chile 
against the embattled 82-year-old former dictator. The group's president, 
Jose Hidalgo, said 70 of the victims were killed by police and military 
forces working to supress protests against Pinochet during the 1980s. 
Hidalgo said the other six are among the more than 1,000 suspected 
dissidents who are unaccounted for following their arrests by the 
dictator's secret police force. Thirteen lawsuits have been filed 
against Pinochet in recent months by the relatives of victims of his 
1973-90 military regime. Pinochet is being held at a London hospital 
on a warrant by a Spanish judge who wants to extradite him to face 
charges of genocide and murder. His legal fate now rests with Britain's 
House of Lords, which has set Nov. 25, Pinochet's 83rd birthday, to 
rule whether he qualifies for state immunity. The government insisted 
Friday that Pinochet should be allowed to return to Chile immediately 
if the House of Lords rules in his favor. Upon his return, the former 
ruler is expected to face increased pressure in the courts, despite 
his immunity to prosecution in Chile as a senator-for-life and the 
further protection afforded him by an amnesty law that his regime 
issued. However, some of the crimes outlined in the 14 lawsuits occurred 
after the 1973-78 period covered by the amnesty law. On Friday, Chile's 
Catholic Church supported the growing demands for justice in the human 
rights violations under Pinochet. The nation's bishops said the most 
serious cases ``should be thoroughly investigated and clarified.'' 
In a statement they called ``Hope and Reconciliation,'' the bishops 
said the situation ``is especially painful'' for the relatives of 
the dissidents still missing.
