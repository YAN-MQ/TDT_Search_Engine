U.S. Secretary of State, Madeline Albright says U.S. relations with 
Peonyoung are at a critical juncture because of Peongyong's missile 
program. She says North Korea now faces a choice about its future 
relationship with Washington over its efforts to build a long-range 
ballistic missile. She made the comment only a few hours before President 
Clinton was scheduled to discuss the North Korea issue with South 
Korean President, Kim Dae-jung, during a visit to Seoul. VOA's Debra 
Tate has more. Mr. Clinton's stop here comes amid heightened U.S. 
and South Korean concerns that North Korea may be resuming its nuclear 
weapons program. Earlier this week, North Korean officials denied 
a U.S. request to allow an inspection of an underground construction 
site near the capital that Washington suspects may be a nuclear facility. 
Peongyoung, which says the facility is for civilian non-nuclear purposes, 
said it would agree to access to the site only on condition of financial 
compensation. A demand rejected by U.S. officials. The dispute threatens 
to derail a 1994 pact under which North Korea has agreed to freeze 
its nuclear program in exchange for free fuel and safer nuclear reactors 
provided by a global consortium. The issue is expected to top the 
agenda during Mr. Clinton's talks with Mr. Kim. Debra Tate, VOA News, 
Seoul.
