Budapest, Hungary (AP) _ The president of Kyrgyzstan arrived Friday 
on a four-day official visit to Hungary, in an effort to boost economic 
and trade relations, and to learn from Hungary's experience to create 
market economy. Kyrgyzstan is one of the most impoverished of the 
former Soviet republics, and was badly hit by Russia's economic crisis 
in August. President Askar Akayev is the first president of the central 
Asian republic to visit Hungary. Hungarian President Arpad Goenz visited 
Kyrgyzstan a year ago. Akayev is accompanied by several of the country's 
ministers. Kyrgyzstan, which now is engaged in market reforms, is 
interested in the experiences of Central European countries such as 
Hungary and Poland, which are front-runners to join the European Union. 
Akayev visited Poland for two days prior to his arrival in Hungary. 
Bilateral trade between Hungary and Kyrgyzstan is low, totaling only 
dlrs 2.3 million in 1997. It increased slightly to dlrs 2.9 million 
in the first eight months of this year. Four new cooperation agreements 
are to be signed in the areas of culture, science, education, tourism 
and customs. The visit will conclude Monday with talks with Prime 
Minister Viktor Orban.
