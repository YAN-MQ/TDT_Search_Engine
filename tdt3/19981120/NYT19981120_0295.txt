NATIONAL FORECAST A surge of chilly air into the Northeast will be 
accompanied by snow showers from western New York to central Maine. 
A band of squalls may bring a few inches to communities along the 
eastern end of Lake Ontario. Clouds will break along the north Atlantic 
coast as brisk winds descend the Appalachians. Expansive high pressure 
will control the weather over most of the eastern half of the nation. 
It will be mainly sunny and cooler in the Southeast. After a frosty 
morning, afternoon readings will return to seasonal levels in the 
Ohio and Tennessee valleys. Clouds and scattered showers will mark 
a stalled front in the Deep South. The leading edge of cooler air 
will reach into northern Florida, but the southern half of the state 
will remain sultry. A disturbance at 20,000 feet over southern Texas 
will produce a plume of high clouds across the western and central 
Gulf states. Periods of light rain will dampen the Rio Grande Valley. 
Very mild weather will spread across the Rockies and into the Plains. 
Readings will rise toward record levels in eastern Colorado, Nebraska 
and Kansas. Farther north, clouds will keep readings closer to seasonal 
values. Winds will gust over 40 mph from Montana to Minnesota. Gales 
and heavy rain will drench the Northwest coast from northernmost California 
to the Olympic peninsula. Showers will spread across the interior 
sections as a vigorous cold front pushes inland. The Southwest will 
stay bright and warm with very mild air reaching into southern California 
and Arizona. Focus: Winter Arrives The mercury fell to 5 below zero 
at Fargo, N.D., on Friday morning and to 9 below at Grand Forks, N.D. 
This marked the first widespread subzero readings away from the higher 
elevations of the West this season. A deep snow cover helped chill 
the surface air. In a typical November, the temperature falls below 
zero twice in Fargo. Most winters bring 50 days with subzero readings 
in the north country, but below-zero values have been measured as 
late as April in Fargo. A stiff wind from the southwest will draw 
much warmer air into the Dakotas this weekend.
