The French may be cleaner than they were 20 years ago, but less than 
half bathe daily, a study says. According to the annual study published 
by France's Committee on Health Education, only 47 percent of the 
population takes a bath or a shower daily _ and only because they 
feel they have to, not because they like it. The study, published 
Friday by the daily Le Figaro, shows the French are not as clean as 
Germans, British and Scandinavians, but have better hygiene than the 
Spanish, Portuguese and Greeks. Yet, when it comes to bathrooms and 
washing machines, France is better equipped than some of its neighbors. 
In 1997, 95 percent of French homes had washing machines, and 96 percent 
had bathrooms, the report said. In 1962, just 29 percent had bathrooms. 
As for dental hygiene, the study says about 67 percent of French brush 
their teeth twice daily, 25 percent brush once a day, and 8 percent 
say they don't brush at all. ``Today people are much more aware of 
the importance of dental hygiene,'' said Dr. Elisabeth Dhumeaux-Boedels, 
a Paris orthodontist. ``This includes children, thanks to aggressive 
campaigns by primary schools, parents and dentists themselves.'' The 
study also shows the French remain Europe's biggest consumers of cosmetics 
and beauty products, a holdover from the days of King Louis XIV. The 
Sun King and his court perfumed themselves with heavy fragrances to 
camouflage strong body odor. Louis liked an audience when he relieved 
himself, but wouldn't have been caught dead washing. ``Call it a French 
particularity,'' Edouard Zarifian was quoted as saying by Le Figaro. 
``Because, at the same time, in other European courts, bathing had 
been elevated to an institution.''
