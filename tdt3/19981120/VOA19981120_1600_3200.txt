Right now let us to go to Ray Freeman for some items from the U.S. 
world of arts. The head of the Hollywood film company, Universal Studios, 
has resigned as a result of a corporate reorganization. Frank Biandi, 
Jr. was ousted as Universal's Chairman and Chief Executive after two 
years with the company. He will be replaced by the studio's second 
in command, Ron Meyer, who will also oversee Universal's television 
business and theme parks. The reorganization allows Edgar Bronson, 
Jr. the head of Universal's parent company, Seagram, to take greater 
control of its entertainment business. The shakeup reportedly is also 
a result of Universal's relatively poor profitability, within the 
Seagram Company. The movie company, one of several major studios in 
Hollywood, has just four percent of the total American box office 
receipts this year. Trailing behind leaders, Disney, Warner, and Paramount. 
Universal's recent films, Primary Colors and Basketball, were considered 
disappointments in the box office. Its most recent major release, 
Meet Joe Black, starring Brad Pitt opened last weekend to generally 
negative reviews. And an upcoming movie, Babe, Pig in the City, has 
been delayed for release and reportedly had production problems. The 
studio has big hopes for the Babe sequel, following the success of 
the original movie centering on a talking pig. The last big hit for 
Universal was director Steven Spieldberg's dinosaur film, The Lost 
World, Jurassic Park, released last year.
