Associated Press Writer BAGHDAD, Iraq (AP) _ U.N. weapons teams went 
into the field for the third consecutive day on Friday, usually a 
day of rest in the Muslim world. ``We're going to be working seven 
days a week,'' said Caroline Cross, spokeswoman for the U.N. Special 
Commission, which oversees weapons inspections. ``We want to get on 
with things and get as much done in as short a period of time as possible.'' 
At least three U.N. vehicles left the headquarters compound on the 
edge of Baghdad and were joined, as required, by Iraqi escorts. Neither 
side has been saying much since the U.N. weapons inspectors returned 
Tuesday from Bahrain, where they had been evacuated last week amid 
fears of a U.S. missile strike. The U.N. inspectors must certify that 
Iraq has eliminated its weapons of mass destruction before the U.N. 
Security Council will lift the trade sanctions imposed after Iraq's 
1990 invasion of Kuwait. The inspectors, who generally have not worked 
on Friday, the Muslim Sabbath, refused to talk with reporters. Ms. 
Cross would not say where they were going. Charles Duelfer, deputy 
director of UNSCOM, told The Associated Press in a telephone interview 
from New York on Thursday that this was intentional. ``We're coming 
out of a crisis,'' Duelfer said. ``We're trying to keep the temperature 
down as much as possible.'' In sermons at Friday prayers, mosque preachers 
addressed the standoff that almost led to the American attack. ``We 
thank God that the crisis ended,'' said Imam Bakr al-Samerai at the 
Abdel-Khader al-Gailani Mosque. Abdel-Razak al-Saadi, preaching at 
the 14th of Ramadan Mosque, urged Arabs to ``stand by Iraq and tell 
America that we will not allow this oppression and aggression to continue.'' 
The United States and Britain had threatened military action if Iraq 
did not reverse decisions in August and October to limit the work 
of the inspectors. Iraq backed down last Saturday, pledging full cooperation 
with UNSCOM in a letter to U.N. Secretary-General Kofi Annan. Iraq 
hopes that a promised ``comprehensive review'' by the council of its 
compliance with disarmament resolutions will lead to an easing or 
lifting of the sanctions, which have limited oil sales and crippled 
the economy. But the acting U.S. ambassador to the United Nations, 
Peter Burleigh, made it clear earlier this week that the United States 
does not see the review as leading automatically to an end of the 
sanctions.
