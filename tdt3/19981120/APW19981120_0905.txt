Ukraine's President Leonid Kuchma on Friday ordered a probe into allegations 
that the country's nuclear power plants concealed profits from using 
nuclear fuel supplied by Russia under a disarmament program. Ukraine 
has received dlrs 1.1 billion worth of Russian nuclear fuel in exchange 
for surrendering nuclear warheads to Russia for dismantling under 
a 1994 agreement mediated by the United States. However, Ukraine's 
nuclear power plants have failed to pay taxes on most of the revenues 
they earned from using the Russian fuel, Kuchma told a meeting of 
the presidential council for combating organized crime, according 
to the Interfax news agency. Ukraine has five nuclear plants, which 
together account for more than 40 percent of the former Soviet republic's 
electricity production.
