Runner Ben Johnson told high school students Friday that he lost his 
right to compete because he ``went with the flow'' and took performance-enhancing 
drugs. Wearing a t-shirt with a picture of Argentinean soccer star 
Diego Maradona, who has also been suspended for drug use, Johnson 
presented something of a mixed message. On the one hand, he warned 
the 300 teen-agers packed into the Ben Gurion High School gymnasium 
here that taking drugs ``can harm you in the long run. ``As a kid, 
I didn't know much better. I kind of went with the flow. If I had 
discipline it would not have happened,'' he said. ``Don't make the 
mistake I did.'' On the other hand, Johnson was clearly bitter. He 
suggested to the students that he had been singled out unfairly and 
that Canada did not back him up when he was stripped of his gold medal 
in the 1988 Seoul Olympics after testing positive for steroids. In 
an interview, he said ``all the top athletes'' used steroids 10 years 
ago, and many still do. ``They had to pick on somebody, and they picked 
on me,'' he said in the speech about his Olympics experience. ``If 
I was from Britain or the United States my country would have protected 
me.'' Johnson was banned for life from track and field in 1993 after 
failing another drug test. Even so, Johnson said he trains 20 to 25 
hours a week and hopes to compete in the year 2000 Olympics in Australia. 
``I can still run just as fast as before,'' Johnson said in an interview. 
But time is running out with Johnson facing his 37th birthday next 
month. ``I want to return to track and field as fast as possible. 
At 36, I haven't much time left although I feel like a 20 year old,'' 
he added. His manager, Morris Chrobotek, said there was a possibility 
that Johnson could run for another country and said there were at 
least 10 countries that might accept Johnson. He named Israel, the 
United States and Japan as possibilities. ``He is striving to come 
back and prove to the world that he can do it clean,'' said Chrobotek, 
noting Johnson had applied to the Athletics Canada to reinstate him 
as a runner and cancel the lifetime ban. Johnson, in Israel as a guest 
of the Macabbieh Athletic Association in Tel Aviv, ran 50-meter sprints 
with some of the students after the speech, allowing some to win. 
He also gave pointers on take off to the young runners. ``I was very 
excited to meet this man. I remember him so well from when I was small,'' 
said Ilan Ziv, 17.
