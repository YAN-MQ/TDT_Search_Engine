Another surge for Amazon.com. the retailer gained more than 27 points 
after announcing a 3-for 3-for-1 stock split yesterday. Amazon is 
up over $47 this week alone, but one adviser has words of caution 
for Amazon investors. You want to buy Amazon or whatever names it 
is, I would recommend that you buy several, not just one. I would 
scale in rather than putting everything I have to work. Probably the 
best way to go at this point in the game would be to look at an Internet 
fund to get a broader array of exposure.
