Many of our FM and medium wave affiliates are taking a bit of a break. 
Just for two minutes. We hope you return to News Now. It was because 
of a television program that the Temptations are enjoying somewhat 
of a resurgence in popularity. Well, they have always been popular, 
I mean speaking of Cher being a big draw of the 60s and 70s. They 
were another one. Yes, sir. Absolutely. I know, I am not going to 
quite my day job. Earlier this month, the NBC television network broadcast 
a four hour miniseries tracing the lives and work of the musical group. 
Which is best known for its Motown-style hit records in the 60s and 
70s. Oh, My Girl, that is just one of them I can think of a lot of 
them. Some group members and devoted fans simply call the group the 
Temps. Now the NBC broadcast attracted large numbers of viewers and 
it seemed that some of them were inspired to go out and buy music 
by the group. The new Temptations album titled, Phoenix Rising, has 
sold enough copies to become their first gold album in 23 years. And 
an album of their past hits called the Ultimate Collection, also has 
entered the chart of best-selling albums even though it was released 
a year and a half ago.
