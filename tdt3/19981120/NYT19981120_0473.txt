The day after the governor of Connecticut announced a deal to build 
a new football stadium for the New England Patriots in Hartford, a 
Patriot official said Friday that the team had received 3,000 requests 
for 10,000 season tickets, and business leaders said they were interested 
in leasing the luxury suites that would be critical to the team's 
success. In the days after the negotiations between Gov. John G. Rowland 
and Patriots owner Robert Kraft first became public knowledge, some 
people questioned whether this long-depressed state capital could 
attract enough corporate support, and whether it could fill seats 
with converted Jets and Giants fans as well as with the faithful from 
Boston. But corporate leaders here said concerns about the team's 
economic viability were probably overblown. ``Those people are being 
unduly pessimistic,'' said Lawrence Gottesdiener, whose company, Northland 
Investment Corp., of Newton, Mass., owns the Metro Center, an office 
complex near the Hartford Civic Center, and three other commercial 
buildings in the area. ``They will be able to sell seats.'' Half of 
the requests for season tickets, which started pouring in shortly 
after the deal was announced Thursday, were from Connecticut residents, 
a Patriots spokesman said. Under the terms of the agreement, the state 
will build a $350 million, 68,000-seat stadium as part of a $1 billion 
development along the Connecticut River that will include a hotel, 
convention center and sports stores. The team is scheduled to move 
to Hartford in the fall of 2001 from its current home in Foxboro, 
Mass. The stadium is to have 125 to 150 luxury suites and 6,000 club 
seats, which typically feature comfortable chairs and waiter service. 
Luxury suites generally cost $50,000 to $100,000 each for eight league 
games and two exhibition games. Club seats can range from $1,000 to 
several thousand dollars a season. Keith Anderson, a spokesman for 
the Travelers insurance operations group in Hartford, a division of 
Citigroup, said that it was too early for the company to decide whether 
to buy a luxury suite or club seats. But Anderson did say that the 
company was considering the purchases. ``All I can tell you is that 
the reaction among employees is one of enthusiasm,'' he said, adding 
that Citigroup has about 7,000 employees in the area. ``Already, we 
have been getting calls about tickets. If the response of our employees 
is any indication, this stands a very good chance of success.'' Edward 
Morgan, a group senior vice president of the Hartford Financial Services 
Group, a venerable financial services and insurance company here, 
echoed that sentiment. ``We have always been supporters of sports 
and the arts in Hartford, and I suspect we would be with the Patriots,'' 
he said. Joe McGee, vice president of the Southwestern Connecticut 
Area Commerce and Industry Association in Stamford, said that a crucial 
factor in the team's success might be whether Patriots games are televised 
regularly on cable stations that can be seen in Fairfield County, 
an affluent suburb of New York City that is home to the headquarters 
of many Fortune 500 companies. He noted that when the team and the 
state were close to a similar deal in 1993, there was significant 
interest among Fairfield County-based corporations in the 80 luxury 
seats offered then. ``Some companies were interested, and some had 
concerns because they had arrangements with the New York teams,'' 
he said. Robert Samek, 44, of Kensington, who grew up watching Giants 
games on television every Sunday with his father and brother, said 
abandoning the New York team was unthinkable. ``I'll buy Patriots 
season tickets,'' said Samek, who went to both Giants Super Bowl games, 
one in Pasadena, Calif., and the other in Tampa, Fla. ``It's one way 
of assuring yourself of a ticket to a Giants game someday down the 
road.'' In addition to attracting support from corporations in Connecticut, 
the team will need to retain the allegiance of companies in Boston. 
Some large companies, like BankBoston, have already said that they 
plan to support the Patriots in Hartford. ``We have a sky box now 
that we use to entertain clients, and we will have a sky box in any 
stadium as long as the stadium is located in a state where we do business,'' 
said Bruce Spitzer, a BankBoston company spokesman. ``We have a large 
franchise in Connecticut. Our colleagues there are very excited.'' 
Many people in the Boston area, however, are as upset as football 
fans in Baltimore were when their beloved Baltimore Colts moved to 
Indianapolis in 1984. ``There has never been a greater indication 
of what is wrong with our government system,'' said Jeff Keith, the 
marketing and public relations manager for Spike Technologies in Nashua, 
N.H. ``There are hundreds of thousands of businessmen, fans and taxpayers 
throughout Massachusetts who would have done anything to get the deal 
done and keep the Pats in New England.'' Like many fans of Boston 
sports teams, he directed special ire at the speaker of the Massachusetts 
House of Representatives, Thomas Finneran, whose fiscal restraint 
forced Kraft to flee to Hartford. ``One man has single-handedly insured 
that Boston will lose yet again another landmark,'' said Keith, who 
has held season tickets for six years. ``Any businessman, or legislator, 
worth his salt can easily see the positive financial impact a professional 
team of the Patriots' caliber has on the overall economy.''
