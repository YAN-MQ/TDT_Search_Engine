The New York Islanders have what the Canucks want. And on Friday, 
Brian Burke, the Vancouver general manager, came all the way to Texas 
trying to get it. One day after scouting the Devils in New Jersey, 
Burke arrived at the Islanders' hotel here and is believed to have 
met with Mike Milbury, the Islanders' coach and general manager, to 
discuss a a trade of the unsigned Islander Zigmund Palffy to Vancouver 
for Pavel Bure, the disgruntled star who has refused to join the Canucks. 
It would not have been the first time Burke and Milbury discussed 
such a deal. Burke, who watched the Islanders lose their third straight 
game, 4-2, to the Stars at Reunion Arena on Friday night, said his 
first preference is to swap Bure for an elite player. Palffy, a three-time 
40-goal scorer, is in that category. Speculation was that Burke was 
looking for a second Islander in addition to Palffy. ``If we get a 
good deal, we'll pull the trigger,'' said Burke, who would not detail 
any discussions he has had with the Islanders for Bure. ``If we don't, 
he's going to sit all year. There is no time frame.'' More than five 
teams are interested in acquiring Bure, Burke said. He scouted the 
Flyers on Tuesday, the Capitals on Wednesday and the Devils on Thursday. 
But since the Islanders are the only team with an top-echelon player 
to offer, it would seem they are the front-runners to get the flashy 
Bure, who has scored 60 goals twice. A player of Bure's or Palffy's 
caliber might have helped the slumping Islanders, who were outclassed 
by the talented Stars on Friday night. Early in the third period, 
the Islanders cut the Stars' lead to 3-2 on a goal by Mariusz Czerkawski, 
who scored his fifth goal in four games, but they could get no closer. 
Wade Flaherty, who started in goal for the Islanders, made 22 saves. 
Ed Belfour made 15 stops for the defensive-minded Stars. SLAP SHOTS 
KENNY JONSSON, the Islanders' top defenseman, did not dress, because 
of the mild concussion he sustained against the Avalanche last Tuesday. 
He is questionable for Saturday night's game in Nashville, Tenn. ... 
Left wing JOE SACCO missed his fourth game with a sore wrist. He may 
return to the lineup on Saturday.
