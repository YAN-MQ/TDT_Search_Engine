Ronaldo, the Brazilian superstar of Internazionale, will not start 
in Sunday's crucial game against Fiorentina, missing his seventh league 
match out of ten this season. His absence will prevent the Milan powerhouse 
from testing the long-awaited duo of Ronaldo and Roberto Baggio. Both 
players have been often sidelined with knee tendinitis in the initial 
months of the Italian soccer season and have played only samples of 
games together. Inter officials said Friday that the Brazilian striker 
will not play against the league leader in Florence as a result of 
his questionable condition, following a streak of knee problems. ``He's 
healed and must only improve his form,'' a spokesman for Inter said. 
``Ronaldo may be fielded in Wednesday's Champions Cup game against 
Real Madrid,'' he added. The Inter-Real Madrid match at San Siro may 
decide the qualifier from Group C for the quarterfinals and is expected 
to attract a sell-out crowd of 80,000. In Ronaldo's absence Inter's 
offense against Fiorentina will be led by Baggio in a team with Chilean 
veteran striker Ivan Zamorano and France's Youri Djorkaeff. Fiorentina 
will also miss a key player, Portuguese midfielder Manuel Rui Costa 
who suffered a left thigh strain in Wednesday's Portugal-Israel friendly.
