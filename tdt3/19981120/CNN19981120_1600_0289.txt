Palestinians in the West Bank celebrated today after Israel started 
following through on the new mideast interim accord. In the first 
part of a three-phase pullback, Israel began withdrawing its troops 
from parts of the West Bank. That gives the Palestinians full or partial 
control of an additional 9% of the disputed area. Israel also has 
released 250 Palestinian prisoners. 150 were criminals. Some Palestinian 
officials are upset because they wanted the release to be limited 
to political prisoners.
