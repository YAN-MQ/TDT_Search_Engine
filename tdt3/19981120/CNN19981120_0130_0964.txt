States have until Friday to decide if they will sign onto the proposed 
settlement agreement with the tobacco industry. So far, 28 states 
have indicated they'll participate. It's up to the tobacco companies 
to decide how many states must sign up for the agreement to go forward. 
The number of states participating will affect the size of the settlement, 
which could be $206 billion. The states sued to recover the costs 
of treating smoking-related illnesses.
