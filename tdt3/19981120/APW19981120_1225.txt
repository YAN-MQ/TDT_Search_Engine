Iraq called a U.N. request for documents about its banned weapons 
program ``provocative rather than professional'' on Friday and laid 
out conditions for arms inspectors to see one of the more contentious 
items. Iraq's deputy foreign minister, Riyadh al-Qaisi, said in a 
letter to chief U.N. weapons inspector Richard Butler that the document 
in question was beyond the scope of UNSCOM's mandate. Nevertheless, 
he wrote, UNSCOM experts can view ``relevant portions'' of it in the 
presence of the U.N. chief's envoy in Baghdad, Prakash Shah. The document 
is an air force diary detailing munitions destroyed during the 1980-88 
Iran-Iraq. It was discovered during a July weapons search. UNSCOM 
spokesman Gustavo Zlauvinen said inspectors were studying the response 
and were ``analyzing what we should do.'' A U.S. official said Washington 
was awaiting Butler's response. U.S. President Bill Clinton cited 
the document in his speech Sunday that detailed what information Iraq 
must give inspectors if it is to see sanctions lifted. The sanctions, 
imposed after Iraq's 1990 invasion of Kuwait, which sparked the Gulf 
War, can only be lifted once inspectors certify that Iraq has destroyed 
its biological, chemical and nuclear weapons _ and the missiles used 
to deliver them. Baghdad severed all cooperation with the inspectors 
on Oct. 31 and only resumed in the face of threats of a military strike. 
The United States has warned that airstrikes are still an option if 
Iraq reneges on its weekend promise to cooperate with the U.N. Special 
Commission, or UNSCOM, which is charged with dismantling Iraq's weapons 
of mass destruction. Butler formally requested the diary in a letter 
Wednesday to Deputy Prime Minister Tariq Aziz. Two other letters asked 
for documents relating to biological weapons and other weapons issues. 
``The request you made at this time, which is of a general nature, 
seems to be provocative rather than professional,'' al-Qaisi wrote. 
Some of the requested documents don't exist, others have been destroyed, 
and yet others have already been requested and whatever information 
available has been submitted, he wrote. ``We hope that UNSCOM will 
discard this unprofessional approach which would unjustifiably lead 
to the prolongation of work, and thereby maintaining the inequitable 
embargo on the people of Iraq,'' he wrote. Iraq's deputy ambassador, 
Saeed Hassan, said Iraq was still committed to cooperating with UNSCOM 
and said Iraq's willingness to allow inspectors to view the air force 
document showed its eagerness to do so. ``What they want is full submission, 
and they will never, never get it,'' he said. ``Full cooperation is 
different than full submission.'' U.N. and Western diplomats have 
noted that the more Iraq cooperates with inspectors in the short term 
_ by turning over documents, for example _ the more it could actually 
hurt its chances of having sanctions lifted if that cooperation reveals 
that its arms programs have not been dismantled. Countries that take 
a harder line against Baghdad, particularly the United States, would 
have that much more ammunition to justify keeping sanctions in place 
until their stated goals of ousting Saddam Hussein is met, the diplomats 
said.
