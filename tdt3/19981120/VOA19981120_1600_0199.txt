The ethics advisor for special prosecutor, Kenneth Starr, has resigned 
to protest Mr. Starr's decision to testify at impeachment hearings 
against President Clinton. Advisor, Stan Dash, says Mr. Starr unlawfully 
intruded on congress' power of impeachment and became an aggressive 
advocate for impeaching the president. Mr. Starr says he believes 
he acted properly. I had an invitation to come to the House of Representatives 
and to explain to the House of Representatives what was in the referral. 
I believe a fair reading of the testimony yesterday, but reasonable 
minds can differ as is obviously the case. Thursday at the start of 
impeachment hearings, Mr. Starr told the House Judiciary Committee 
the president lied under oath and abused his office in an effort to 
conceal his affair with Monica Lewinski. A pole suggests Mr. Starr's 
testimony did little to change public opinion with a majority still 
opposing impeachment.
