Major league baseball home run slugger, Sammy Sosa of the Chicago 
Cubs has been selected the National League's Most Valuable Player 
for 1998. Sosa received 30 of the 32 first place votes in balloting 
by the Baseball Writers' Association of America. Mark McGuire who 
electrified baseball fans along with Sosa, by breaking Roger Merris' 
home run record, finished second in the voting. Moiser Soleiu, of 
the Houston Astros finished third. Sosa hit a club record 66 homeruns 
and had a league high 158 runs batted in to help the Cubs win the 
National League wild card playoff birth. Sammy was happy to win the 
award, but he gave credit to others. I just want to say that I feel 
great, especially today, that they named me MVP, but also that was 
me but, you know, the people my teammates, my manager, they have a 
lot of thing to do with that, too. And it has been great to take that 
award today, it is an honor. Juan Gonzalez, of the Texas Rangers was 
named the American League's Most Valuable Player on Wednesday and 
predicted Sosa's victory would be a great source of pride for all 
Latin Americans. There is a special moment for all Latin America, 
because both players, one from Santo Domingo, and one from Puerto 
Rico win the MVP award the same year. The National League MVP is the 
last of the post season major league baseball awards.
