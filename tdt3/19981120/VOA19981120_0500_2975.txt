U.S. stock prices were higher yesterday in what seems to be a great 
deal of investor confidence in the technology sector. The NASDAQ composite 
index gained 22 points. That is more than one percent to 1,920. Some 
analysts say talk of a slow down in computer-related sales next year 
has been exaggerated. The benchmark Dow Jones industrials rose a more 
modest 15 points to 9,056. The S&P 500 was up eight points to 1,153. 
Joe Batafaglia of the Gruntle Investment Company. Remains optimistic 
that U.S. stock prices will continue to move higher. We believe in 
the fundamentals of the economy. Low inflation, lower interest rates, 
and that is being played out there in rising equity prices, which 
will continue well into next year. And there was some more economic 
news that indicates the economy is continuing to hum right along. 
Housing starts jumped by more than seven percent last month. The biggest 
increase in more than a year.
