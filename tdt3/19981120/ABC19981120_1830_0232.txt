Another warning for Microsoft today. Now it is Japanese trade regulators 
who say that Microsoft has been violating Japan's anti-monopoly laws. 
It's been a bad week for Microsoft, and for its CEO, Bill Gates. First, 
a federal judge ordered the company to change its Windows 98 operating 
system or take it off the market. And now the testimony of Mr. Gates 
himself in a major suit by the government against Microsoft is at 
the center of a very bitter argument. Here is ABC's Terry Moran. It 
was an ominous signal for Microsoft. A pointed response yesterday 
from the court to Microsoft's complaints that the government is being 
unfair in repeatedly playing excerpts from Bill gates' videotaped 
deposition. "If anything, I think your problem is with your witness, 
not with the way in which his testimony is being presented," judge 
Thomas Penfield Jackson said. "I find it very effective." This is 
the kind of testimony the judge is talking about. I don't know what 
you mean, concerned. What is it about the word concerned that you 
don't understand? In a trial tactic that seems to have taken Microsoft 
by surprise, the justice department is driving home each of its charges 
against the company with telling excerpts from Gates' testimony, essentially 
turning gates into a witness against his own company. The Bill Gates 
judge Jackson sees on tape is evasive, annoyed, out of the loop, a 
far cry from the hands-on business revolutionary of Microsoft legend. 
Since that question is that you don't have an answer to, you don't 
have an answer to that question, let me put a different question. 
I have an answer. The answer is I don't remember. The judge has been 
seen to laugh in court while watching the testimony. But will the 
tactic win the case? Credibility matters in a case like this. Did 
Bill Gates really undertake some of the things that some of the witnesses 
are saying? Gates himself dismisses the use of his testimony as a 
dirty trick by government lawyers. They don't show my whole deposition. 
They show these tiny little pieces. There is one way for Microsoft 
to fight back. Call Bill Gates as a witness, something the company 
has said it has no intention of doing. Terry Moran, ABC News, New 
York.
