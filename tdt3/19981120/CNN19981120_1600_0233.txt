Security and economic issues will top the agenda during President 
Clinton's two-day visit to south Korea. Mr. Clinton arrived in Seoul 
today, where he will meet with south Korean President Kim Dae-Jung. 
The two will discuss allegations north Korea is building a secret 
arsenal of nuclear weapons. Mr. Clinton arrived in south Korea from 
Tokyo. Earlier today, he held a joint news conference with Japanese 
prime minister keizo Obuchi. Mr. Clinton indicated opening up Japan's 
markets to more U.S. goods would help that country's troubled economy. 
We are also, I am confident, going to meet our responsibilities as 
the world's two largest economies. The United States will do its part 
with a determined policy to keep growth going, markets open to free 
and fair trade, and continued efforts to stabilize the global economy 
in the short and long term. Mr. Clinton is also scheduled to meet 
with U.S. troops stationed in south korea.
