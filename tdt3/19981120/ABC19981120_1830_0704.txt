In the Middle East, there was one of those moments we don't see very 
often. The Israelis and the Palestinians made an agreement, and at 
least for now, it has worked out. The Israelis have given back a small 
portion of the West Bank, roughly the size of Chicago this time. There 
was one last haggle over maps. It was a good day for Palestinians, 
and for some Jewish settlers, another reason to be bitter. ABC's Gillian 
Findlay. They make their way under cover of darkness. Israeli soldiers 
have orders to stop them. These are Jewish settlers from the town 
of kadumim and they're staking out new land. It's land Palestinians 
say is theirs and should, at the very least, be the subject of negotiations. 
But the settlers insist the land belongs to Israel. We've been longing 
for this land for 2000 years. It belongs to us and we're going to 
fight for it. That's essentially what Israel's foreign minister has 
told them to do. Earlier this week, ariel Sharon advised settlers 
to "run and grab more hills" before they become Palestinian territory. 
Settlers call the new clusters of trailers that have been popping 
up on hilltops "extensions" of existing Settlements. But some of them 
are miles away and Palestinians say that's a provocation. There's 
already been violence. These clashes were over a new road Israel is 
building in the West Bank, one of a dozen that will allow settlers 
to bypass Palestinian villages. The problem, to do it, Israel is confiscating 
Palestinian land. This woman says these olive trees have been in her 
family for generations. An Israeli bulldozer uprooted them in only 
minutes. After the kadumim settlers spent their first night in the 
hills, Israeli soldiers detained them and ordered them not to go back. 
But each night they have gone back, and will continue to go they say, 
as a Warning to their government not to give too much away. Gillian 
Findlay, kadumim.
