Sonny Bono's widow says prescription drugs contributed to his death. 
Bono died in a skiing accident last January. Mary Bono tells "TV guide" 
he took painkillers for chronic back and neck pain, 15 to 20 pills 
a day. She said the pills clouded his judgment, made him behave erratically 
and led to his death. Tests on his body showed no evidence of drug 
or alcohol abuse.
