This is meteorologist Valerie Voss with your "CNN Headline News Weather 
forecast" for Saturday. A cold front will move off the east coast, 
ushering in cooler weather, but clear skies, although there will be 
some lingering snow showers across upstate New York, northern New 
England, perhaps the eastern Great Lakes, and a shower or thunderstorm 
across central Florida. Meanwhile, a system in the northwest is just 
the first of a series. We'll see heavy rain, strong winds, heavy mountain 
snow and warmer air pushing into the plains states. Highs on Saturday 
will be in the 60s through the central plains. The coolest air will 
be 30s across the northeast. Looking ahead then to Sunday, still wet 
and windy in the northwest, with some rain showers across south Texas 
and Florida. On Monday, still rainy and windy in the northwest, with 
a mix of rain and snow across the Great Lakes. As you can see, temperatures 
are warming a bit. 40s north to 70s south. Same situation on Tuesday, 
while the wet weather continues in the west. Don't forget, you can 
find four-day forecasts for more than 7,200 cities at cNN.com.
