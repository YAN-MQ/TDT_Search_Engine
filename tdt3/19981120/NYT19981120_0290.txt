Here are some of the things you can fit into Helmut Lang's holster 
bag, though not all at the same time: a Penguin paperback, a rolled-up 
decorating magazine, a reporter's notebook, a cellular phone, a peanut 
butter and jelly sandwich, a box of Uniball pens, a banana, your hand. 
(It will not hold a newspaper or a legal pad or a can of soda or a 
laptop computer.) The bag, which is made of thin cotton, straps around 
your waist with a wide Velcro band and around your left leg with a 
slim little cord. You step into it like a pair of pants, and it hangs 
loosely on your hip like a tool belt or a gun holster. It is an extraordinarily 
useful piece of equipment, especially when worn in conjunction with 
one of Lang's belt bags _ or try two! _ and his arm pouches, which 
are the size of cigarette packs and fit around an arm with wide elastic 
bands. When all these bags are deployed around your body, with your 
stuff nicely distributed among them and easily accessible, you'll 
look a bit odd, like a gun-packing waitress on Rollerblades, but you'll 
be functioning in some sort of perfect ergonomic zone. You might feel 
like the narrator of Nicholson Baker's book ``The Mezzanine,'' full 
of the self-importance that comes from needing all the things that 
are contained in all the pouches. ``Of course, that was the principal 
reason you needed little bags,'' Baker writes. ``They kept your purchases 
private, while signaling to the world that you led a busy, rich life, 
full of pressing errands to run.'' Lang's holster bag, which will 
go on sale early next year, is one of a number of utilitarian ``body'' 
bags _ that is, bags that are worn strapped to the body like vests 
or belts _ being made by a number of designers. Bottega Veneta makes 
a holster vest bag in white deerskin that fits under a jacket or shirt. 
Miu Miu, Prada's secondary line, has a canvas vest bag, as well as 
a waist holster bag; Prada itself has belt bags. Dolce &AMP; Gabbana 
has both vest and waist holster bags. Missoni and Ann Demeulemeester 
make belt bags; Versace, wrist pouches. The fact that these designers 
showed these sorts of bags at exactly the same time _ during the recent 
shows of their spring collections _ feels like one of those fashion 
conspiracies. It's as if all the designers had a meeting one day and 
said: ``OK guys, forget cargo pants. This year, we're gonna make pockets. 
Just pockets this time. Cargos without the pants. Get it?'' (Presumably 
Ralph Lauren missed this particular meeting, and that is why he will 
soon be alone in selling silk Shantung cargo pants and bikini underwear 
with cargo pockets.) Last year's conspiracy, the great cargo pants 
hoax, roped in most of the garment industry, from Chanel to Baby Gap. 
One friend said wickedly, ``Babies need cargo pants _ they have a 
lot to schlep.'' The New Yorker ran a cartoon last summer with the 
punch line: ``You don't get an office. You get cargo pants.'' In its 
current catalog, J. Crew offers cargo pants with the line, ``More 
than an attitude, they're pants with drawers.'' If cargo pants were 
last year's metaphor for contemporary culture, which is increasingly 
nomadic and equipment-dependent, then body bags are the inevitable 
follow-up act. ``It's very American, this carrying tradition,'' said 
Richard Martin, director of the Costume Institute at the Metropolitan 
Museum of Art. The companies whose bags look most alike deny collusion. 
``It is the designer's job to feel the needs of society, and this 
time that is what we felt people wanted,'' Stefano Gabbana said in 
a faxed answer to a question. ``Those ideas weren't forced,'' said 
Laura Moltedo, the president and creative director of Bottega Veneta. 
``They made sense to us.'' Miuccia Prada declined to be interviewed 
for this article. Lang said he has been making the bags for sale in 
Japan since 1996. Kal Ruttenstein, senior vice president for fashion 
direction at Bloomingdale's, chuckled at the idea of a fashion conspiracy. 
``That's the mystery of fashion,'' he said, ``I really do think these 
things are in the air.'' Ruttenstein sent a buyer to Asian factories 
in the weeks following the Helmut Lang show; he hopes to have a Bloomingdale's 
label line of body bags in his stores by February. ``I hear that somebody 
in London is making them for immediate delivery,'' he said. Does it 
matter who was first? Who knows? What is true is that because high 
fashion right now is directly inspired by what young people are doing, 
as it was in the 1960s and '70s, the idea of something's being ``in 
the air'' is more concrete than it sounds. Young people (do they know 
that entire retail empires hinge on every stylistic twitch?) start 
little trend fires _ cargo pants, surf T-shirts, messenger bags _ 
and fashion smells the smoke and alters course, searching for street 
credibility. ``Postmodern theorists see the elusiveness of authenticity 
as the fundamental crisis of our age,'' Ted Polhemus wrote in his 
1994 book ``Streetstyle'' (Thames &AMP; Hudson). So who's making the 
real thing these days? Where is ground zero for the strap-on pocket? 
It may be in London, at the Soho gallery and clothing shop run by 
Vexed Generation, a 4-year-old British group that makes witty urban 
``war'' gear _ fleeces with Ninja hoods, parkas made with heavy nylon 
to deflect flying glass shards and pockets big enough to stow a gas 
mask and, most important, very distinctive body bags. Among the globe-trotting 
fashion pack, the stuff is all the rage. ``Our thing initially was 
to make clothes in reaction to the erosion of civil liberties in Britain,'' 
said Adam Thorpe, 29, who runs Vexed Generation with his partner, 
Joe Hunter, 31. ``We wanted to parody British police riot gear,'' 
he said. Still, the protective nylon was real enough, as was the kidney 
and crotch padding in the group's pants and parkas, which were manufactured 
and worn initially, Thorpe said, by friends who ran a relief organization 
in Sarajevo. It used to be that well-educated young people with something 
to say made paintings or staged performance pieces. Now, it seems, 
they make clothes. Vexed Generation's outsider status bloomed in a 
gallery space, where the group formed a loose collaborative of artists 
and musicians, selling clothes and showing art. They also made one 
extremely desirable bag: a well-padded, boxlike backpack with a strap 
that runs diagonally across the chest. (You can find it in Manhattan 
today at a new store, Nylon Squid _ another British import.) ``Everyone 
ripped it off,'' said Katherine Betts, fashion news director of Vogue. 
``We wrote about it last June, and in the same issue Miu Miu had an 
ad with the identical bag.'' The second bag Vexed Generation made 
was a vest bag called the Vexed Shopper _ ``a combination bulletproof 
vest and shopping bag,'' as Thorpe put it. It's a smart-looking bag, 
heftier than those you'll soon be seeing when the designers' spring 
collections hit the department stores, but instantly recognizable. 
Authenticity on this side of the Atlantic is currently making its 
home on Elizabeth Street, east of SoHo, where you can buy any number 
of body bags. Wander into Orfi, a store whose name stands for Organization 
for Returning Fashion Interest, and you'll find pockets tucked into 
scarves and four different kinds of belt bags. ``Fashion is the outward 
pimple on the face of everything that we're up to,'' said Scott Kruger, 
a member of Orfi. Orfi is _ guess what? _ a loose collaborative that 
includes Kruger, an architect; Don Hearn, also an architect, and Ana 
Gonzalez, a philosophy student turned clothing designer. Orfi makes 
street-inspired men's and women's clothing, which means a lot of cargo 
pants and pea jackets and garments made of packing cloth. A few weeks 
ago, Hearn was down in the store's workroom, fooling with a prototype 
for a new vest bag, which looked like a photographer's equipment vest 
and a little like the military jacket Hearn had brought in for inspiration. 
Maybe it doesn't matter who made the first body bag. Perhaps what 
we're seeing is the death throes of the status pocketbook. In any 
case, how refreshing to note a trend in bags that are purely utilitarian 
and that cost less than $500; Helmut Lang's holster bag, for instance, 
will retail for about $155. ``We are moving away from the bag as fetish 
object, I think,'' Kruger said. But Ms. Betts of Vogue is not so sure. 
``I think people are just going to fetishize these little bags,'' 
she said. ``People will fetishize anything you put in front of them. 
Anyway, soon it's not going to be about bags anymore. I just saw the 
spring shoe collections, and you know the way there was this handbag 
mania last year? Well, now it's going to be shoes, the weirder the 
better. Some of them are so weird they don't even look like shoes.'' 
Are you ready for it? My shoes are weirder than your shoes.
