Meanwhile, in the Big 10, a trip to the Rose Bowl is on the line when 
the Ohio State Buckeyes battle traditional rival, Michigan, and Wisconsin 
plays Penn State. Ohio State coach John Cooper says Saturday's context 
promises to be another game to remember. They have got a 16-game winning 
streak in our conference and playing great defense right now. Their 
offense is doing what they have to do to win ball games. They are 
running the football and they are mixing the running game in with 
the passing attack and there should be another great ball game between 
Ohio State Buckeyes and Michigan Wolverines here this coming Saturday. 
Meanwhile, Michigan coach, Lloyd Carr, says his Wolverines are hoping 
to keep their winning streak alive and make a second straight trip 
to the Rose Bowl. Well, the great week is at Michigan. We have an 
opportunity to play in the Michigan Ohio State game. We are going 
in to this game with some momentum, but we also are going into a game 
where we are going to have to play our very best. Meanwhile, Wisconsin 
coach Barry Alvarez, says Joe Paterno's Penn State squad is one of 
the strongest teams he has ever faced. As always, they have tremendous 
athletes. Offensively, outstanding skill players. Defensively, tremendous 
speed, give you a lot of different fronts. Unique to anybody else 
we play, Penn State is, as usual, is outstanding. Meanwhile in the 
southeast conference, the second ranked Tennessee Volunteers have 
a battle with conference rival Kentucky. Other games have UCLA taking 
on Southern California for a shot at the national title or a trip 
to the Rose Bowl. Not a bad trade off there. While also fourth ranked 
Florida takes on instate rival, Florida State. Notre Dame plays LSU, 
Arkansas is at Mississippi State and Oregon plays Oregon State.
