President Boris Yeltsin's former bodyguard said Friday that he had 
received instructions from a controversial financier to transfer more 
than one-quarter of the shares in Russia's largest television station 
to Yeltsin, the Interfax news agency reported. Yeltsin's spokesman 
Dmitry Yakushkin denied the charge Friday. ``(The president) has no 
shares, doesn't control any shares, and this question was not coordinated 
with him,'' Yakushkin told a news conference. A hard-line Communist 
member of parliament had alleged on Wednesday that financier Boris 
Berezovsky had given the bodyguard, Alexander Korzhakov, the power 
of attorney to give 26 percent of shares in the ORT television station 
to Yeltsin in 1994. The member of parliament, Viktor Ilyukhin, called 
the alleged transfer a bribe. The station is 51 percent government-owned, 
with the remainder held by various private investors, including Berezovsky. 
Berezovsky confirmed Thursday that the shares were transferred, but 
said that Korzhakov had forced the transaction. Korzhakov, the former 
head of the presidential security service and Yeltsin's confidant 
for 11 years, was ousted in a Kremlin power struggle in June 1996. 
The ORT station has meanwhile been fighting bankruptcy proceedings 
against it. On Friday, its noon news broadcast, which usually runs 
15 minutes, was cut to just three minutes because the company could 
not prepare video footage, ORT said. Shortly after noon, court marshals 
announced they were temporarily ending their attempts to confiscate 
ORT's company cars as part of the bankruptcy proceedings. The government 
had appealed to law enforcement authorities to halt the threatened, 
forced sale of the station's assets to pay its multimillion-dollar 
debt to government-owned transmitters. ORT officials say they've already 
cut costs, but that their biggest source of income, advertising, has 
shrunk as a result of the country's economic crisis.
