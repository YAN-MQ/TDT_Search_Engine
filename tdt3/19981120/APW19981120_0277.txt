Israel began withdrawing troops in the West Bank on Friday, but the 
handover was held up after several hours because the Palestinians 
raised questions about last-minute Israeli changes in the redeployment 
map. Once completed, the pullback would give Palestinian leader Yasser 
Arafat full or partial control of an additional 9.1 percent of the 
West Bank, or 510 square kilometers (204 square miles) and take him 
a step closer to his final goal _ statehood.
