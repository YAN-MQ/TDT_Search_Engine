Meanwhile, big news tonight about tobacco companies which have settled 
on their own strategy from the avalanche of lawsuits they faced. They'll 
pay and pay big, billions of dollars to every state in the country, 
a $206 billion agreement will be signed with 46 states. This is a 
huge cash dividend for the states. Tonight, Pete Williams adds it 
all up. It's the largest settlement of a civil lawsuit in U.S. history 
-- the states today accepting the tobacco industry's offer to pay 
for what they claim are health costs they're stuck with from sick 
smokers. The deal calls for cigarettemakers to pay the states $206 
billion over the next 25 years and to change tobacco ads -- a move 
intended to limit smoking's appeal to children. No more cigarette 
billboards or placards on buses, taxis, and subways. No more clothing, 
like hats, T-shirts and backpacks, with cigarette brand names. Nearly 
every state has signed on, agreeing to drop their lawsuits for the 
certainty of a settlement -- Because of the positive impact the terms 
of the agreement can have on youth smoking in Kansas, not to mention 
the general funds. I've notified my colleagues that I will accept 
the settlement. Kansas, for example, would get $1.5 billion over the 
next 25 years. That's as much as the state would spend in that period 
on transportation costs. In response, tobacco companies are expected 
to soon charge 35 cents more for a pack of cigarettes. But unlike 
the first proposed deal with the states and Congress that fell apart 
months ago, this one calls for no federal regulation of nicotine -- 
a Reason anti-smoking groups say it doesn't go far enough. It leaves 
a large number of avenues open for the industry to continue to market 
its products to our nation's kids. It does nothing to regulate nicotine 
and the other harmful components of tobacco products. Today's deal 
is only with states and doesn't affect hundreds of lawsuits filed 
by individual smokers. Still, it's a remarkable legal victory, given 
that no state has ever won a Jury verdict against a tobacco company, 
a demonstration of how much the industry thought it had to lose. Pete 
Williams, NBC news, Washington.
