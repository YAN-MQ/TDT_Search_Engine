There are indications the country's banks are tightening their business 
lending practices. A survey conducted by the federal reserve finds 
some banks say they are more willing to make consumer installment 
loans, while a "moderate percentage" say they have tightened standards 
on credit cards, and worries it may spread to the United States. The 
economic crises in Asia and other parts of the world may have contributed 
to the new lending practices.
