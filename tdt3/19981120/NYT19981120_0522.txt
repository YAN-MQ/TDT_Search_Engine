A powerful and confident New York Jets attack rehearsed the two-minute 
drill Friday for the all-or-nothing Tennessee Oilers defense. If it 
works for the Jets when the teams meet Sunday in Nashville, Tenn., 
they will decode the strategy that has helped the Oilers win three 
straight games and five of their last six. ``They just put more guys 
up there than you can block,'' Jets coach Bill Parcells said. ``It's 
the old disruption game. Who can disrupt who the most? If you can 
make plays, then you have a chance.'' That disruption game worked 
remarkably well against Pittsburgh twice in the last three weeks. 
The Oilers (6-4) held the Steelers' Jerome Bettis to a total of 55 
yards in generating two victories. Now it is the Jets' Curtis Martin's 
turn to try to move on the ground against the staunch Tennessee defense. 
Jeff Fisher, the coach of the Oilers, learned under the legendary 
defensive guru Buddy Ryan at Philadelphia. The Jets (6-4), though, 
have become a confident offensive force, having been held to fewer 
than 20 points only twice this season. If Martin can find cutback 
lanes, which the Oilers have been successfully sealing, then he has 
only open road ahead since the defensive backfield is understaffed. 
Like many of the defenses the Jets have faced, the Oilers stack eight 
or nine players in the ``box'' _ the imaginary area between the tackles, 
extending back to the linebackers. In that scheme their middle linebacker, 
Joe Bowden, is their leading tackler, and he can also put pressure 
on the quarterback. There is, however, only one player with as many 
as two sacks on the defense, tackle Josh Evans, who is also one of 
the team's top tacklers. Jets quarterback Vinny Testaverde faced the 
Oilers twice a year for five seasons, first with Cleveland and then 
with Baltimore. He started seven games against Houston and threw for 
14 touchdowns, with eight interceptions. His teams were 4-3 over the 
Oilers. ``You can get your opportunities against them, but you have 
to be careful in what you do,'' Testaverde said. ``They can create 
big plays for themselves with their blitzes. They wouldn't do it if 
they didn't feel comfortable in their own ability.'' Jumbo Elliott, 
the Jets' left tackle, said: ``Those multiple fronts require you to 
be on your toes and do your homework. You can do some things, though, 
if you pick it up the right way.'' For Keyshawn Johnson, the box, 
or whatever it's called, is irrelevant. ``I've got to get open,'' 
the receiver said. ``Not because they've got nine men on Curtis; I'll 
get open because I'm good enough to get open.'' The Jets' offense 
has been flexing its muscles since Testaverde took over from Glenn 
Foley. The only game under Testaverde it failed to produce more than 
20 points on its own came in last Sunday's 1-point loss to the Colts, 
when Aaron Glenn galloped to his record 104-yard return of an attempted 
field goal. That game, however, was marked by uncharacteristic drops 
by Johnson and Wayne Chrebet, as well as by tight end Fred Baxter, 
who also failed to keep his feet in bounds on a sure touchdown. ``The 
approach we have to take to the game,'' Parcells said, ``is `Can you 
make them play the way you want, or will they make you play the way 
they want to play?' You play the way they want to play, you don't 
have much of a chance.'' EXTRA POINTS Vanderbilt University, where 
the game will be played, was one of seven college coaching stops for 
BILL PARCELLS, who was defensive coordinator there in 1973-74. ``It 
was a school that had not won, but we got to a bowl game,'' he said. 
About a dozen of his former players will visit him Saturday night, 
Parcells said. ... TERRY DAY's comeback attempt has not worked out 
following his off-season knee surgery from a basketball injury. The 
second-year defensive lineman was given a three-week trial. Asked 
what he had shown, Parcells replied, ``Not much.'' He added, speaking 
about Day's reaction to suiting up again: ``I've had some players 
like this. They're so used to limping, they limp.'' The Jets will 
continue to pay Day, step up his rehabilitation and hope he can make 
it next year. ... The Jets will wear a football logo with the name 
``Weeb'' on the helmet for the rest of the season. It honors Weeb 
Ewbank, the architect of the Super Bowl III championship team, who 
died on Tuesday. ... Parcells described Thursday's practice as better 
than Wednesday's. He was, overall, very muted in his daily news conferences. 
The playoff race is on.
