Meanwhile, one giant leap for the international space station. The 
first piece of this science project was launched without a hitch today, 
putting in place the first piece of the most expensive jigsaw puzzle 
the world has ever seen or paid for. Here's Robert Hager. Early today, 
on the faraway steps of central Asia -- Main engine start and liftoff, 
the international space station is under way. a Russian rocket, two 
million pounds thrust, could be the start of a new era. The first 
component of the international space station heading toward orbit. 
a graphic of what it lifts to space. Built by Russians -- paid for 
by the U.S. to generate power for the space station and maneuver it. 
It's called zarya, or sunrise. Part two, not far behind -- waiting 
aboard a shuttle at cape Canaveral for liftoff December 3rd. A connecting 
hub of the station, called unity, to be joined to zarya in a Series 
of elaborate space walks next month. Astronauts training in a huge 
pool in Houston, under water, to simulate a Weightless environment. 
The space station may be controversial it'll take another 44 space 
shots, 1,000 hours of spacewalks, and about $40 billion, well over 
half paid for by the U.S. the U.S. share rising as the Russians, their 
economy in chaos, miss payments. Writer, William Burrows -- It's costing 
dearly, it really is. They are hemorrhaging, and they are, in part, 
causing us to hemorrhage too. And slowing down the project. The commander 
of December's flight, Bob cabana, says delays are rough. Hey, it's 
a hard task. You want to get up there, and you want to do the job. 
You want to have a goal in sight. And when it's a moving target, it 
sometimes get's kind of frustrating. Eventually, piece by piece, this 
is how NASA plans for it to grow. 16 nations contributing. Astronauts 
to begin staying there by the year 2000 but not completed until the 
year 2004. When done, it would be 3 1/2 times longer than a midsized 
jetliner, like a 737, have a much larger living area than the shuttle 
or Russian Mir, with the first shower stall in space. And from earth, 
it would be visible even without binoculars. A milestone in the history 
of space exploration. A journey that begins, today. Robert Hager,
