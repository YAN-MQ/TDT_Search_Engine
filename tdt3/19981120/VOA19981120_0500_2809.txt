You are listening to VOA News Now, 10 hours, 47 Universal Time on 
this Friday. I am Paul Westfieling along with Charlene Porter, joining 
us in just a minute, Les Carpenter. Here is the top new story we are 
following for you. The Palestinian Authority is refusing to take over 
West Bank areas vacated by Israel in the first stage of its pull out 
under the Wye River Interim Peace Accord, signed here in Washington. 
Palestinians claim the territory is smaller than what had been agreed 
upon. Stay tuned at the top of the hour. We will have full details 
on that story and much more.
