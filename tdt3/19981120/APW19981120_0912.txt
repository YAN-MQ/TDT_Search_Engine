Led by a former navy chief, Indian peace activists entered into Pakistan 
at the largest border post between the two hostile neighbors Friday 
in a small attempt to soothe bitter relations between the two nuclear 
nations. The group of 130 people, led by former Chief of Naval Staff 
Admiral L. Ramdass, was described by Indian officials as the largest 
ever delegation to drive past the heavily protected Wagah border in 
the northern Punjab state, into Pakistan. The delegation includes 
writers, filmmakers, women's right activists, journalists and representatives 
of voluntary groups, organizers said. Quibbling over a range of knotty 
disputes including their sharply divergent claims to the frontier 
mountainous region of Kashmir, New Delhi and Islamabad agreed in peace 
talks this months to let more of their people meet each other by loosening 
visa restrictions. The activists of the Pakistan-India People's Forum 
for Peace and Democracy said they were headed for a two-day conference 
with their counterparts in the Pakistani city of Peshawar Nov. 21-22. 
``The convention is taking place in the wake of the nuclear tests 
by the governments of the two countries which has added another dimension 
to their conflict and therefore inflated their sense of insecurity,'' 
the forum said in a statement in New Delhi. The rival tests in May 
by New Delhi and Islamabad heightened fears of the world's first nuclear 
conflict in South Asia, a region already rocked by three wars between 
India and Pakistan in the last 50 years. ``Our main objective ... 
is to promote peace and harmony between the two nations,'' Ramdass 
told The Associated Press. Also Friday, India's Foreign Office said 
an Indian delegation would visit Islamabad from Nov. 24 through 27 
to discuss a power sale deal, and talks would be held Dec. 1 through 
4 on a bus service between Delhi and the Pakistani city of Lahore.
