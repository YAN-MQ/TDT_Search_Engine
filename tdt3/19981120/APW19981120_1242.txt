Crown Prince Frederik, the heir to Denmark's throne, plans to take 
part in a 3,500-kilometer (2,170-mile) dog-sled trek to mark the 50th 
anniversary of a Danish navy unit that patrols along Greenland's northern 
fringe. The trip, set for February 2000, is planned to set off from 
Qaanaaq, 500 kilometers (310 miles) south of the North Pole. The crew 
will follow the coastline and are expected to arrive in June in Ittoqqortoormiit, 
1,400 kilometers (870 miles) northeast of the Greenland capital of 
Nuuk. The crown prince, 30, is a member of the navy's elite frogman 
unit and has taken part in Arctic drills. Frederik's personal secretary 
was quoted as telling newspapers on Friday that the crown prince would 
take part in the expedition on the same conditions as the others. 
``He is part of the team,'' Per Thornit was quoted as saying by the 
Berlingske Tidende daily. The six-person expedition will include three 
sleds, each weighing about 450 kilograms (990 pounds) and pulled by 
a total of 42 dogs. The trip is to commemorate the founding in 1950 
of the Sirius patrol, which monitors to northern fringes of the Danish 
territory.
