Iraq's news agency reports seven teams of U.N. weapons inspectors 
visited several sites Thursday. It's the second day of inspections 
since Iraq agreed to allow the teams to resume their duties. U.N. 
officials say the inspections went normally. If the monitoring teams 
certify Iraq has eliminated its weapons of mass destruction, U.N. 
sanctions against the country could be lifted.
