The first piece of the international space station is finally in orbit. 
The 24-ton section was rocketed into space today by a Russian proton 
booster rocket from Kazakhstan, after being delayed for a year. The 
41-foot long component will provide power and communication for the 
international space station, scheduled to be completed in 2004. It 
will take about 45 more flights to put 100 more pieces into orbit. 
16 nations are sharing the cost of the $40 billion project.
