Independent Counsel Kenneth Starr's appearance before the House Judiciary 
Committee on Thursday had no significant immediate impact on the nation's 
view of whether President Clinton should be impeached, two overnight 
polls released Friday showed. CBS News interviewed 584 respondents 
early in the week and again Thursday night. Early in the week, 25 
percent said they believed that Clinton should be impeached. Thursday 
night 30 percent said so, but the poll had a margin of sampling error 
of plus or minus 4 percentage points. A Gallup Poll interviewed 652 
people Thursday night, and found that 35 percent said they wanted 
their representative to vote for impeachment. That was an increase 
from 31 percent from a different poll last week. The margin of sampling 
error was plus or minus 5 percentage points. Both polls registered 
some improvement in national opinion about Starr himself. Gallup found 
that 35 percent had a favorable view of him now, compared with 31 
percent last week. Among the 44 percent who said they had seen or 
heard about the hearings, his rating was 40 percent favorable. CBS 
News registered a clearer gain, but from a lower base. Eighteen percent 
of its sample was favorable to Starr before the hearing, and 26 percent 
was afterward. Moreover, the national balance is still heavily against 
him. Fifty-eight percent of Gallup's respondents said they disapproved 
of how Starr was handling his investigation compared with 63 percent 
last week. In the CBS News poll Thursday, 60 percent said he was more 
concerned with damaging Clinton than with finding out whether anything 
illegal had been done. Earlier in the week, 62 percent held that view. 
Kathleen Frankovic, director of surveys for CBS News, said of her 
company's poll, ``While there was a modest improvement in opinions 
about Starr, there was little change in attitudes about the investigation 
or impeachment.'' This was true, Ms. Frankovic said, even though the 
CBS News Poll showed that 65 percent of the public felt Starr had 
done a good job of presenting his case to the committee. Gallup had 
a similar finding, with 26 percent saying he had done ``an excellent 
job'' and another 41 percent saying he had done a ``good job.'' The 
two polls offered somewhat contradictory findings about the impeachment 
process. Gallup asked if the hearing gave respondents more confidence 
or less confidence in the impeachment process in Congress. Thirty-two 
percent said it gave them more confidence; 42 percent said less. But 
in the CBS News Poll, the question was put in a different way, with 
respondents asked if they approved or disapproved of how the committee 
was handling impeachment. Early in the week, 41 percent approved and 
43 percent disapproved; on Thursday night 47 percent approved and 
39 percent disapproved.
