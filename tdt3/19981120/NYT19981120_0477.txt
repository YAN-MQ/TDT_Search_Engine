The New York Times said in an editorial for Sat., Nov. 21: For years, 
conservatives have been trying to break up the Court of Appeals for 
the 9th Circuit because they have been unhappy with some of the court's 
rulings on environmental issues and death penalty cases. Republicans 
in the Pacific Northwest have been particularly vocal in clamoring 
for their own circuit, believing that the San Francisco-based appeals 
court does not understand their values. A commission led by former 
Supreme Court Justice Byron White will report on the issue to Congress 
next month. Its draft proposal would significantly alter the court's 
structure without formally cutting the circuit in two. The appellate 
judges would be assigned to three regional divisions _ one for the 
Pacific Northwest states, one for northern California, Hawaii and 
Nevada, and one for southern California and Arizona. These would function 
as semi-autonomous units, but conflicting rulings would be resolved 
by a seven-judge panel selected from the entire circuit. Administration 
would remain under one roof. The plan is more reasonable than splitting 
the circuit. But it is still a change for which a compelling case 
has not been made. A simpler way to improve the court's performance 
is for Congress to fill its vacancies. For most of the last four years, 
10 out of 28 judgeships in the 9th Circuit have been vacant. Currently, 
only 22 are filled. In many cases judges from district courts or other 
circuits are asked to sit on panels hearing oral arguments. Simply 
reducing the excessive reliance on visiting judges could lead to more 
consistent rulings.
