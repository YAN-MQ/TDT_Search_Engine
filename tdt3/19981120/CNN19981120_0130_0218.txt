President Clinton may have been overseas, but he did keep an eye on 
the hearings. Mr. Clinton is on a five-day Asian trip focusing on 
the region's financial crisis. Speaking before business leaders, the 
president praised Japan for its efforts to end its recession. But 
he said he's worried about trade battles if Tokyo doesn't continue 
to open its markets to American-made products. Mr. Clinton is also 
scheduled to make stops in south Korea and Guam.
