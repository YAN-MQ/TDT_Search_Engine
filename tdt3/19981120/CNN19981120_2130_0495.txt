This is meteorologist Valerie Voss with your "CNN Headline News Weather" 
forecast for Saturday. The first in a series of frontal systems across 
the northwest will bring a Round of heavy rain and mountain snow along 
with strong, gusty winds. As it moves inland, however, out ahead of 
it we'll see warmer temperatures for the central plains states. The 
east gets cooler as the cold front moves off the coast, but skies 
will clear except for sections of upstate New York and northern New 
England, where we could see some rain showers, or down across Florida 
and south texas, where we could also see a shower or thunderstorm. 
Highs on Saturday -- 60s through the central plains. We'll see just 
30s over northern New England. Looking ahead to Sunday, it's still 
wet across the northwest as temperatures warm up across the country. 
Monday, still wet in the northwest, a mix of rain and snow for the 
Great Lakes region with rain showers in Texas. Then on Tuesday, pretty 
wet across most of the west coast. Temperatures range from 40s north, 
to 70s south. Don't forget, you can find four-day forecasts for more 
than 7,200 cities at cNN.com.
