With his professorial rumpled suits and gray, tousled hair, Robert 
H. Perkins, 58, looks every bit the parsimonious value player. But 
Perkins, the manager of the Berger Small Cap Value fund, has had plenty 
of time to hone his image. He has been trolling the markets for 30 
years. Since January 1995, however, small-capitalization stocks _ 
the category in which he specializes _ have lagged behind their large-cap 
siblings by an average of 14.5 percentage points a year, according 
to Ibbotson Associates, the research firm. Still, like many small-cap 
managers, he sees better times ahead. ``We're in the early stages 
of a period when small stocks outperform larger ones, much like late 
1990 through 1993, when the Russell 2000 stocks more than doubled 
the S&AMP;P 500,'' Perkins said from his office, in a turn-of-the-century, 
landmark brick building in Chicago. ``We believe the rebound will 
occur when the broad market sorts itself out and particularly when 
the large-company market leaders return to more realistic price levels,'' 
he said, something he expects to happen over the next two or three 
months. Perkins has amply demonstrated his abilities in the recent 
trying times. The fund, with $270.5 million in assets, returned 2.7 
percent for the 12 months through Nov. 13, compared with a 9.1 percent 
loss for its peer group of small-cap value funds, according to Morningstar, 
Inc., the financial publisher. The fund returned 20.3 percent, annualized, 
for the three years through Nov. 13, versus 12.2 percent for its group, 
Morningstar said. The data are for the fund's institutional shares; 
retail shares became available in February 1997. Perkins, plies his 
craft as a partner with Perkins, Wolf, McDonnell, a money management 
firm in Chicago. After more than a decade running funds for Kemper 
Securities, he struck out on his own in 1980, eventually starting 
the Omni Investment fund, seeded with $3.5 million in cash from friends 
and institutions. It opened to the public the week of the 1987 crash. 
Sales, however, languished. ``I was stupid enough to think that a 
good product would sell itself, and so we never marketed it,'' he 
said. It had just $35 million in assets when he sold it in 1996 to 
Berger Associates, which was in need of a small-cap value fund. He 
continues to manage the renamed fund as subadviser. Perkins's value 
tilt flows from an overarching, cautious philosophy. ``When we look 
at new ideas, our first step is to establish downside risk, and then 
we look for rewards,'' he said. His starting point is stocks of companies 
whose market capitalizations are under $1 billion and whose prices 
are hitting new lows. In particular, Perkins has a penchant for what 
he calls ``fallen growth stocks,'' those that have tumbled 50 percent 
to 70 percent from their 52-week highs because of what he sees as 
temporary problems. These are often cyclical in origin, or attributable 
to Wall Street overreaction. But not just any fallen stock will do. 
Ideally, he wants no debt on the company's balance sheet, to minimize 
risk. For much the same reason, he also wants companies that sell 
for two to four times the cash on their balance sheets. ``Cash is 
particularly important because when you buy near a stock's low, there's 
a company-specific or industry-specific problem,'' he said. ``The 
cash gives us some confidence that the company will have time to correct 
its problem.'' In general, he expects a company he buys to be back 
on its feet again within a year. The fund's own cash position has 
fluctuated recently. Perkins let cash levels rise to 20 percent three 
months ago and, then went on a stock-buying spree after the market 
fell. Cash was down to 5 percent by late October but has since rebounded 
to 15 percent. ``Small stocks are undervalued long term,'' he said, 
``but on a trading basis, the market may be a little ahead of itself, 
right now.'' Recently, he has been buying shares of semiconductor 
and telecommunications equipment makers. Last spring, he bought Brooks 
Automation, paying an average of $14 a share, compared with a high 
of almost $40 in October 1997. The stock price was depressed primarily 
because of slowing Asian demand and inventory problems, he said. The 
downturn is cyclical, Perkins said, adding that he expects profit 
growth to be in the low teens by mid-1999. He thinks the company, 
currently unprofitable, could earn $1 a share over the next 12 months. 
The stock closed on Friday at $14.25. Discipline in selling is important, 
too. Last summer, Perkins bought shares in Sawtek, a maker of electronic 
signal processing components for the telecommunications industry, 
at 10 times projected 1999 earnings. He paid an average of $13.40 
for the shares, which had fallen from $49.50 in September 1997, also 
because of problems in Asia. During the market run-up last month, 
however, he began paring back his shares, which had jumped nearly 
50 percent in value, to 19 times projected 1999 earnings, above his 
target of 18 or so. He closed out his position last week at $22 a 
share. In the last month or so, he has moved into consumer stocks, 
including Wolverine World Wide, maker of Hush Puppies shoes. He bought 
shares at an average of $11, down from $30.50 in March. ``We think 
the low-priced shoe business is relatively stable,'' he said. ``When 
Wall Street liked it, Wolverine sold for more than 25 times earnings, 
and now it's slipped to less than 10 times 1999 earnings.'' He expects 
that to climb to 15 over the next six months. The stock now trades 
at $13.0625. The relative obscurity of such picks is no accident. 
``Not too many people on the street follow our stocks,'' Perkins said. 
``The lack of sponsorship creates opportunity.''
