Its love affair with Monica at long last over, TV has turned nasty. 
Only 15 minutes into Kenneth Starr's two-hour-plus monologue _ the 
``Meet Joe Black'' of testimony, as one Hollywood observer described 
it _ the NBC affiliate in New York pulled the plug and switched to 
Sally Jessy Raphael. The same happened on other channels, in other 
cities, including Washington itself. In Seattle the local NBC station 
had to yank the impeachment hearings to quell a popular uprising: 
Viewers were on the phone demanding a return to regularly scheduled 
programming. Hours later, when the Starr-Kendall confrontation at 
last arrived, the All Monica cable network MSNBC hyped it as ``the 
big showdown,'' a prime-time battle so highly anticipated (said one 
commentator) that people might even watch it on pay-per-view. But 
none of the Big Three networks aired so much as a minute of it live. 
By this point, as The New York Times' Jill Abramson observed, Starr 
had failed to match the star power of John Dean, Oliver North or Clarence 
Thomas. Among other miscalculations, the independent counsel didn't 
realize that the very words ``Morgan Guaranty'' put the nation (and 
visibly yawning congressmen) to sleep. Or that his own report had 
hit the best-seller list not because of its constitutional arguments 
but because of its vivid descriptions of oral sex that, as he so painstakingly 
noted, did not reach ``completion.'' If Starr was going to abstain 
from sex at this late date, then of course America was going to change 
the channel to ``The Young and the Restless.'' New sex, even old sex, 
was the only hope of propping up a hearing with no new information, 
no new rhetoric, no changes of heart in any camp and no compelling 
new characters. Starr's belated exoneration of President Clinton on 
Filegate and Travelgate even killed the hope that such larger-than-life 
rascals as Craig Livingstone and Harry Thomason might someday be cross-examined 
by Mary Bono. And Henry Hyde quickly proved himself no Sam Ervin. 
Constantly lauded by the Washington media as the soul of judiciousness 
and wisdom, the chairman returned the favor Thursday morning by garnishing 
his own gravely patriotic opening statement not with a quotation from 
Jefferson or Madison or even de Tocqueville _ but from David Broder. 
After that, he faded into partisanship and befuddlement, managing 
his chaotic show with the wheezy ineptitude of Bottom putting the 
Mechanicals through the paces of ``Pyramus and Thisbe'' in ``A Midsummer 
Night's Dream.'' But the real author of this drama was Samuel Beckett. 
Like the release this week of the Tripp tapes _ whose contents were 
known through transcripts weeks ago _ the hearing was merely a rerun, 
peopled by characters who cannot escape repeating the same lines over 
and over, poignantly hoping that someone will care, that some higher 
force will swoop down to give it all meaning. Unlike the tramps of 
``Godot,'' however, the players in our impeachment drama DO have an 
exit (or, in D.C. parlance, an ``exit strategy'') from their existential 
dilemma _ if only they have the courage to take it. That exit is impeachment. 
The entire country knows _ and has known since January _ that Bill 
Clinton lied under oath about his sleazy affair with Monica Lewinsky. 
No Democrat on the committee defended the president's behavior Thursday, 
because it is, quite simply, indefensible. The Republicans, meanwhile, 
keep lecturing us that a presidential perjurer is not above the law, 
that the constitutional process of impeachment should not be derailed 
by election results or popular opinion, etc., etc. _ so why not just 
put their votes where their mouths are and go for it? The GOP has 
the majority _ a bigger majority now than it will have in January 
_ and can easily cancel the Hyde reruns tomorrow, without fear of 
public complaint. Since there is neither new evidence nor new arguments 
that will change the political equation that has been frozen in place 
for months, why not cut to the chase and stand up for principle with 
an actual vote? Should impeachment carry the day, there will be dividends 
for everyone. Bill Clinton may finally jump from a 70 to a 100 percent 
job-approval rating. Clinton-haters will finally get their day in 
court. And the country could be rewarded with a Senate trial so entertaining 
that Judge Judy may not know what hit her.
