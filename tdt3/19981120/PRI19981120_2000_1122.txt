For the World, this is Clark Boyd. Coming up, people who hate to see 
the price of oil go down, on PRI, Public Radio International. The 
World is sponsored by the Capital Group Companies, investing throughout 
the world for individuals and institutions. And the World is sponsored 
by Merck, dedicated to the needs of society through pharmaceutical 
research and consumer education to improve the quality of life. Merck, 
committed to bringing out the best in medicine. This is the World. 
I'm Lisa Mullins.
