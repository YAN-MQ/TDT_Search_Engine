President Bill Clinton has just completed a meeting with Japan's Prime 
Minister, Keizo Obuchi, in Tokyo. He and Mr. Obuchi responded to questions 
from reporters during which Mr. Clinton said he approved of Japan's 
recent bank reform legislation and the stimulus package overall. And 
he suggested something that benefited Americans, which may also stimulate 
Japan's economy. We believe that greater trade and investment will 
actually generate more jobs and more growth in Japan. And therefore, 
we think it is important to continue with the market opening mechanisms. 
And we have suggested that perhaps deregulation in the areas of telecommunications 
and airlines would generate more jobs here, only because they generated 
far more jobs for us in the United States when we did it, than we 
could have known. President Clinton urges he Japanese people to have 
confidence in their country by purchasing more of its goods and services. 
Mr. Clinton is now on his way to South Korea for talks.
