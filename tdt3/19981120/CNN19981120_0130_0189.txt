More witnesses may appear before the house Judiciary committee. Republicans 
on the committee want to subpoena President Clinton's attorney, bob 
Bennett, democratic contributor Nathan Landow and the attorney for 
former White House volunteer Kathleen Willey. Congressional sources 
say several democrats on the committee also want to subpoena several 
people, including Linda Tripp, literary agent lucianne goldberg and 
two of Starr's deputies. But some democrats are questioning the effort 
at a time when they're calling on republicans to quickly wrap up the 
impeachment inquiry.
