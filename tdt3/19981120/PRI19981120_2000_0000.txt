From Public Radio International, this is the World, a co-production 
of the BBC world service, PRI and WGBH Boston. Today is Friday November 
20. I'm Lisa Mullins in Boston. Coming up, celebrations on the west 
bank as Israel begins a pull back and reservations about a reprieve 
for illegal immigrants from central America. Giving people temporary 
status in the United States sounds good, but there's nothing as permanent 
as a temporary refugee. They're going to get jobs. They're going to 
start putting down roots and after a certain number of years it becomes 
difficult to ask them to leave. Also preparing a feast for the nation's 
top enchilada. First up, this news.
