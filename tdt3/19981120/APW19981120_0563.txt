A 26-year-old woman was found dead from starvation in her Paris apartment, 
and her sister, found with her, was suffering from acute malnutrition, 
police said Friday. Police said rescue workers called to the apartment 
in southern Paris found the body of Malika, whose last name was not 
released, on Thursday. Her sister, Nadia, 32, who was in the apartment 
at the time, was hospitalized in an advanced state of malnutrition. 
Nadia told rescue workers that her sister had had no income for several 
months and that the family was unable to help buy food, according 
to police. Further details were not immediately available. It was 
not immediately clear who alerted rescue workers to the situation. 
Police said an investigation was underway. Meanwhile, French radio 
reported that frigid temperatures took the life on Friday of a homeless 
man near one of the city's major hospitals, Cochin, also in southern 
Paris. According to a witness who spoke on Europe I radio, the man 
died because emergency social services refused to come get him. The 
witness was identified only as Michelle. She said she called several 
emergency numbers and was turned away and redirected to a new service 
each time. She said the man was still alive when firefighters arrived. 
''He was still alive because they told him, 'no, no, don't move. Don't 
be afraid,''' she told Europe I. ``Unfortunately, he died.''
