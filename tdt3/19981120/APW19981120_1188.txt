Meredith Gourdine, who won the long jump silver medal at the 1952 
Olympics, died Friday following a series of strokes. He was 69. Gourdine 
jumped 24 feet, 8 1/2 inches (7.4-meter) at the Helsinki Games and 
finished second to fellow American Jerome Biffle, an army private 
who came out of two-year retirement to win in 24-10 (7.45-meters). 
Gourdine's ex-wife, June Hubbard of Laurel, Maryland, said he had 
been suffering from diabetes, and had lost his vision and one leg. 
He was undergoing twice-weekly dialysis treatments at the time of 
his death, Hubbard said. ``That man, he never gave up no matter what. 
When he was losing his eyesight, when he lost the feeling in his hands,'' 
she said. ``He just kept on and on despite his disabilities.'' Meredith 
Gourdine Jr. of Houston said his father died at St. Joseph's Hospital 
in Houston.
