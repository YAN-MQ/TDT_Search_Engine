Hurricane Mitch has claimed three more lives. A helicopter on a mercy 
flight crashed off the atlantic coast of Honduras thursday, killing 
all three people on board. This comes as the international community 
helps central America recover from the storm, which killed more than 
11,000 people and caused billions of dollars in damage. Meanwhile, 
the U.S. army announced Thursday it will send an additional 4,300 
troops to the region to assist recovery efforts.
