It has been a very big week for this country's biggest instant family 
-- the McCaugheys. Bobbie and Kenny, their 2 1/2-year-old daughter 
and the Septuplets -- kenneth, Alexis, Natalie, Kelsey, Nathan, Brandon 
and Joel. The babies had their first birthday this week. And NBC's 
Ann Curry talked to their mom about what the past year's been like. 
Of course we had times that were scary because we didn't understand 
what was happening and they were things foreign to us. We never had 
to deal with it before. But looking back now and getting the whole 
picture in, we had a walk in the park.
