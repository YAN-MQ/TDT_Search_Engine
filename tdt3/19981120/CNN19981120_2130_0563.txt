The Taliban militia in Afghanistan has declared Saudi-born financier 
osama bin laden is not a terrorist. Today was the Taliban's deadline 
for the world to submit evidence on the matter to the afghan Supreme 
Court. A spokesman says the lack of submitted evidence means any pursuit 
of bin laden would be seen as a pretext to attack Afghanistan. Only 
three countries recognize the current leadership of Afghanistan.
