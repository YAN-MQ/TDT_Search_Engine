In Washington today, the immigration and naturalization service says 
it has cracked the largest immigrant smuggling ring in U.S. history. 
After a year-long investigation called operation seek and keep. The 
I.N.S. has arrested 21 people and uncovered a complex, global operation. 
Here's ABC's Bob Woodruff. At stash houses in the United States and 
at this one in the bahamas, federal agents found illegal immigrants 
packed into small rooms. Bags of false passports and piles of airline 
tickets. In the past three years, the I.N.S. believes 12,000 Indians 
have been smuggled into the U.S. by three related cartels. Human trafficking 
they say, has become a multibillion dollar industry. They are being 
smuggled in by well organized, well-financed international criminal 
networks. According to federal officials those smuggled in began their 
journey in India and were taken by air through Moscow to Cuba. From 
there they would pass either through the Bahamas and into Miami or 
through Ecuador and Mexico into Texas. The trip cost $20,000 to $25,000 
each paid either by their families or the employers waiting for them 
in the U.S. These aliens were ordered by unscrupulous businesses that 
wanted cheap labor. And wanted labor that basically had to take whatever 
conditions they had. Federal officials would not say what kinds of 
businesses were using these smuggled aliens because they have not 
yet tracked them all down. But they say there are thousands of leads.
