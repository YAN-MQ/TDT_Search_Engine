I am David Chadwick, VOA News. Israeli troops have begun pulling out 
of West Bank areas under an interim peace deal with the Palestinians. 
The pull out is the first stage in the process of handing over land 
near the town of Genene to partial or full control of the Palestinians 
under the U.S. brokered Wye River Peace Accord. VOA's David Gullest, 
watched the proceedings. The redeployment was carried out with little 
fanfare and without the public celebrations among Palestinians that 
marked Israel's last pull back two years ago. Israeli troops set up 
signs delineating the new Palestinian-controlled areas. And after 
officers from the two sides signed ceremonial maps of the new zones, 
the Israelis simply drove away. About 500 square kilometers of the 
West Bank is affected by the initial pull out, with additional lands 
to be turned over in two more steps in the next ten weeks. Israel 
is also releasing 250 Palestinian prisoners under the Wye River Accord 
signed at the White House a month ago, while the Palestinian Authority 
is taking a series of steps to crack down on anti-Israel militants. 
When the process is completed in January 40 percent of the West Bank 
will be controlled by Yasser Arafat's Palestinian Authority. David 
Gullest, VOA News in Cabatia in the West Bank.
