A 12-year-old boy who had been detained by security officials in Indian-held 
Kashmir died Friday and his body showed signs of a severe beating, 
a doctor said. The doctor, who spoke on condition of anonymity, said 
Shafat Ahmad Rather was brought unconscious and badly bruised to Srinagar 
Hospital by police Thursday. Relatives of the boy said had been detained 
for questioning last week by military troops. A military official, 
speaking on condition of anonymity, confirmed the boy had been held 
but said he was handed over to police Thursday in ``good condition.'' 
He would not comment further. The death sparked a peaceful protest 
by about 1,000 people in Srinagar Friday. Troops sent to Kashmir to 
quell a militant Muslim uprising are often accused of torturing detainees 
and of other human rights abuses. Muslim militants have been fighting 
since 1989 in Kashmir, saying predominately Hindu India's only Muslim-majority 
state should be independent or part of neighboring, officially Islamic 
Pakistan. India accuses Pakistan of fomenting the insurgency, but 
Pakistan says it lends the militants only moral support. India and 
Pakistan have fought two wars over Kashmir since both countries gained 
independence from Britain in 1947. Both claim all of the Himalayan 
territory, which is divided between them.
