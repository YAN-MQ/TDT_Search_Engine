BRUSSELS, Belgium (AP) - The European Union and South Africa on Friday 
stepped up efforts to clinch a trade deal they have been negotiating 
for four years, in a last-ditch attempt to wrap up the accord by the 
end of the year. Emerging from several hours of talks with the EU's 
top negotiator Philip Lowe, South Africa's Ambassador to the EU Elias 
Links predicted negotiations until ``the early hours'' of Saturday 
to try and conclude the deal. ``The progress established is not in 
the least a resounding success,'' Links told a news conference. ``To 
say that we were satisfied with the offer by the Europeans would be 
not telling the whole truth,'' he said. Under the latest EU proposal, 
the EU would phase out duties on 95 percent of South African imports 
over 10 years. In turn, South Africa proposes to phase out duties 
on 86 percent of EU imports over 12 years. The sensitive issues are 
agricultural goods and textiles. South Africa wants the EU to improve 
an offer on opening its markets to a number of South African agricultural 
products, including fresh and canned fruits, and cut flowers. Under 
the EU proposal, EU imports of these products from South Africa would 
benefit from reduced-duty import quotas, not full liberalization. 
On a separate but crucial point, the EU wants South African vintners 
to stop using the names ``sherry'' or ``port'' for any of their wines. 
It argues that only Spain can produce wines called sherry and only 
wines from the Portuguese city of Oporto can be labeled as port. South 
Africa claims they have used those terms for 300 years. The negotiators 
hope to reach an agreement this weekend or next week. The EU's Commissioner 
for relations with South Africa Joao de Deus Pinheiro wants a deal 
ready in time to be presented to a meeting of EU foreign ministers 
scheduled Dec. 7. Any deal would have to be endorsed by the EU countries 
and the South African government. The agreement would cover roughly 
90 percent of EU-South Africa trade, worth a total 17 billion European 
currency units (dlrs 19 million).
