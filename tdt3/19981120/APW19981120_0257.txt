Prices on the Hong Kong Stock Exchange closed lower on profit-taking 
Friday. The Hang Seng Index, the market's key indicator of blue chips, 
fell 79.94 points, or 0.8 percent, closing at 10,233.36. On Thursday, 
the index had gained 99.88 points. Turnover amounted to 8.46 billion 
Hong Kong dollars (U.S. dlrs 1.08 billion), up from Thursday's 7.14 
billion Hong Kong dollars (U.S. dlrs 915 million). Brokers said investors 
took profits following recent gains in share prices, discounting an 
expected cut in local interest rates. After the market closed, leading 
Hong Kong banks announced that they were cutting their prime lending 
rates by 0.25 percentage point to 9.50. Brokers said the cut in local 
interest rates was expected after U.S. interest rates were reduced 
on Tuesday. Among properties, Sun Hung Kai Properties fell 1.75 Hong 
Kong dollars to 55.50, and Cheung Kong fell 1.50 dollars to 57.25. 
In the banking sector, HSBC Holdings fell 5.00 dollars to 186.50, 
and Hang Seng Bank fell 1.00 dollar to 67.00. Elsewhere, Hutchison 
Whampoa fell 1.25 dollars to 55.25, and Swire Pacific ``A'' fell 50 
cents to 35.00.
