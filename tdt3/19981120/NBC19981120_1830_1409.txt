Much more on what it's been like to raise seven infants all at once, 
tonight on "Dateline" at 8:00, 7:00 central. I'll be right back with 
a look at an outrageous scheme to rip people off -- stealing from 
that trusty corner mailbox. When they said the world didn't need another 
nose strip we said, "oh, yeah?" How about making one that's contoured, 
for a good fit giving it a centering bump so you know where to place 
it and using a skin-friendly adhesive? Introducing ClearPassage an 
ergonomically advanced nose strip designed to relieve the symptoms 
of nasal congestion. Oh, and one last thing-- how about having it 
made by the maker of Afrin nasal spray the people who know more about 
the nose than anyone? New ClearPassage. Some things are just better 
in St. John's bay. Like our combed cotton turtlenecks, for him and 
her. With a heavier knit. And a more generous cut. Just $10.50. only 
at JCPenney. Just doesn't get any better. yup. Jc Penney. 12,000 people 
in my home town and I represent all of them. No time to get slowed 
down by irregularity. My doctor says, "exercise, eat more fiber." 
But sometimes a meal is whatever you get served. So my doctor suggested 
metamucil. It's not a chemically-altered fiber, not an artificial 
stimulant. The only leading brand with 100% natural fiber... is: keeps 
me regular, gently, changed my life. Now I can get out there and change 
the world. metamucil: La, La, La, La unlike ordinary pickles, claussen 
just won't bend... La, La, La when it comes to taste. - We make 'em 
cold and keep 'em cold. - so enjoy the cold snap of claussen.
