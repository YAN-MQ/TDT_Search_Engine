A report released this week by the U.S. Department of Energy finds 
that the price of oil and gasoline in the United States is low and 
will probably stay that way. This news comes as no surprise to American 
consumers who are finding gasoline prices at their lowest levels in 
six years. The average price for one gallon or 3.7 liters of gasoline 
hovers around one dollar. But a report released this week by the International 
Center for Technology Assessment says that Americans really are paying 
as much as 15 times more in hidden costs. The report considers such 
external factors as petroleum tax subsidies, pollution-related health 
problems and global warming. Joseph Mendleson, legal director of the 
Washington based research group says group subsidies cause consumers 
1.69 trillion dollars per year. We pay for those costs. Either through 
supporting government institutions that have to deal with those issues, 
whether it is through Medicare/Medicaid, you know, those are all costs 
that we do not realize that come out of our tax dollars. Joseph Mendleson 
says the international Center for Technology Assessment recommends 
policy decisions based on its report. For example, he says, as the 
environmental Protection Agency revises its standards for the next 
generation of automobiles, it should make a significant move away 
from gasoline powered vehicles.
