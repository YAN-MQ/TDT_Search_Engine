Since the American academy of pediatrics began its "back to sleep" 
campaign, the occurrence of sudden infant death syndrome has dropped 
to a record low. But there's evidence many parents are still confused 
about how to put their babies to bed. And doctors have puzzled over 
whether infants who sleep on their backs develop any differently than 
those who sleep on their tummies. In a study of 350 healthy babies, 
the American academy of pediatrics found that during the early months, 
those who slept on their bellies developed motor skills a little sooner 
than those put to bed on their backs. However, by the time they were 
walking, their motor skills were equal. By the time they reached their 
first birthday, they were equal. So this study did not state that 
these infants would be developmentally delayed. The findings reinforce 
advice to put babies on their backs to sleep. But experts say parents 
should make a point of placing infants on their stomachs while they 
are awake to help develop the upper body strength that prepares them 
for crawling. For the latest health news online, check out CNN.com/health.
