Biological and chemical agents may become formidable weapons in the 
arsenals of terrorists. Don Knapp reports on how experts are preparing 
for the threat. For more than 50 years, ever since the only war time 
use of atomic bombs leveled Hiroshima and nagasaki, leaders, scientists 
and others have managed to hold nuclear weapons in check. This is 
an example, if they put -- if they spray one kilogram of Anthrax. 
Keeping chemical and biological weapons in check may be much more 
difficult. The high-end scenarios, the ones that kill the most number 
of people, or cause the greatest fatalities, are the open-air releases 
of chemical or biological agents. Three years ago, the aum shinrikyo 
sect released Sarin gas in a Tokyo subway, killing 12 and sickening 
5,000. Experts say only minor mistakes prevented the attack from being 
even worse. Easy access to information and advances in technology 
have many worried about the proliferation of chemical and biological 
weapons. For the biological weapons in particular, you don't need 
big facilities. You need nothing more than what one would consider 
a microbrewery in your backyard to brew the bugs. Whether it's backyard 
bacteria or chemicals combined in a garage, they pose a difficult 
threat. Not merely because of their lethality, but because of the 
profound difficulties of determining whether someone is building them, 
using them, disseminating them or even working on them. Disaster team 
responses, like this one rehearsed in San Jose, california, may be 
of little use against a carefully orchestrated biological attack. 
There's going to be an exposure, most likely a silent exposure. And 
then people will start to get sick. Those people will now be spread 
out all across the nation, potentially, if the exposure occurred on 
a site like grand central station. John gannon, a senior intelligence 
officer, calls chemical and biological weapons a clear and present 
danger for the United States. America's prestige and high profile 
as a global power make us the world's biggest and most dispersed target. 
a target that, so far, has little defense against the emerging threat.
