Munich was selected Friday to stage next year's IAAF Grand Prix Final, 
the culminating event of the lucrative Golden League series. Munich 
was chosen by the International Amateur Athletic Federation at its 
annual Council meeting in Monaco. The event will be staged on Sept. 
11 or Sept. 12. The Golden League, which was introduced last season, 
will return in 1999 with meets in Oslo (June 30), Rome (July 7), Monte 
Carlo (Aug. 4), Zurich (Aug. 11), Brussels (Sept. 1) and Berlin (Sept. 
8). All six Golden League meets will take place on Wednesday nights 
in order to make the events easier to package for television. Just 
as last year, a dlrs 1 million jackpot is on offer for any athlete 
or athletes winning their event at all Golden League meets and the 
Grand Prix final. The jackpot was shared last season by American sprinter 
Marion Jones and distance runners Hicham El Guerrouj of Morocco and 
Haile Gebrselassie of Ethiopia. The IAAF said Friday that Qatar is 
a ``strong candidate'' to stage the Grand Prix Final in 2000. The 
Doha meet was elevated to Grand Prix status for 1999 following this 
year's historic meet in which, for the first time, women were allowed 
to compete in an international track and field competition in the 
Gulf region. No final decision was taken, meanwhile, on proposals 
to downgrade the status of Britain's only two IAAF outdoor meets. 
IAAF spokesman Giorgio Reineri said the Grand Prix commission recommended 
demotion of the Gateshead and Sheffield meets ``because the level 
of results and organization was very low last year.'' But British 
organizers promised improvements and IAAF president Primo Nebiolo 
said he would monitor the situation before a final decision was made. 
In other developments, the IAAF council decided to set mininum qualifying 
standards for women's pole vault and women's hammer throw at next 
year's World Championships in Seville, Spain. The events are being 
introduced at the worlds for the first time. The IAAF had previously 
planned to invite the top 12 ranked athletes in each event to compete 
in Seville. The IAAF also decided to introduce the women's 3,000 meter 
steeplechase on the continental level in 2000, and consider the event 
for possible inclusion at the 2003 World Championships.
