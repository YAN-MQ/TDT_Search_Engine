At one point in independent counsel Ken Starr's testimony yesterday 
at the impeachment inquiry against President Clinton, he said accepting 
criticism is part of his job. Today, he had to accept some from his 
ethics counselor, who has resigned. Gina London has that, and more 
on the expanding inquiry. I believe it was a fair reading of the testimony 
yesterday, but reasonable minds can differ, as is obviously the case. 
That was Ken Starr's response today as he learned his ethics counselor, 
Sam dash, resigned, contending Starr breached his role as independent 
counsel by being an "aggressive advocate" of his evidence of impeachment. 
And now, republicans are extending the impeachment inquiry into the 
kathleen Willey matter. Willey is the former White House volunteer 
who alleged Mr. Clinton groped her. Four new subpoenas reach out to 
Willey's lawyer, Dan Gecker, Nathan landau, a democratic fund-raiser 
who Willey says urged her to keep quiet about her claim -- What particularly 
bothered us was that first the subpoenas of at least a Couple of those 
people, Mr. landau, Mr. Gecker, appears to be a new fishing expedition. 
Also the president's close confidante, Bruce Lindsey. And Bob Bennett, 
Mr. Clinton's lawyer in the Paula Jones case. So very relevant questions 
is important to ask him concerning the allegations of obstruction 
of justice and perjury by the president of the United States. The 
committee plans to take private depositions of the four new witnesses 
the week after Thanksgiving. It's unclear, however, whether or not 
they will ultimately be called to testify publicly. In Washington, 
I'm Gina London, "Headline News."
