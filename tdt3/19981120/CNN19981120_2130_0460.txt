Palestinian police are celebrating today as Israel withdrew troops 
from parts of the northern West Bank. There were small skirmishes. 
No injuries are reported. The move gives Palestinians full or partial 
control over an additional 9% of the disputed area. Israeli troops 
left an army base near the Palestinian town of jenin. In accordance 
with the recent Middle East peace accord, Israel is scheduled to carry 
out two more pullbacks by late January.
