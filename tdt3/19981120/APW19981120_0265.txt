Jeremy Mayfield was fastest Friday in practice for the upcoming dlrs 
1 million NASCAR Thunder Special Coca-Cola 500, a season-ending exhibition 
race at the 1.5-mile Twin Ring Motegi. Mayfield, driving a Ford Taurus, 
marked the day's fastest lap of 35.692 seconds, followed by 35.817 
seconds posted by Mike Skinner circling the oval racetrack in a Chevrolet 
Monte Carlo. Finishing third was Jeff Burton, whose best time was 
35.911 seconds. He drove a Taurus. Jeff Gorden, at age 27 the youngest 
racer to win three Winston Cup championships, finished sixth in 36.011 
seconds on a Monte Carlo. The field of 31 in Sunday's competition 
includes 14 Winston Cup stars, 11 Winston Cup West competitors, four 
Japanese drivers and one each from the Busch Grand National and the 
Craftsman Truck Series. Last year, Gorden canceled his trip to the 
1.54-mile Suzuka Circuitland due to sickness. The race at Suzuka was 
a second-year event in a three-year contract that NASCAR has with 
the Japanese in promoting the race worldwide. Skinner, winner at Suzuka 
last year, leads a number of drivers taking part for the second straight 
year. They include Michael Waltrip, Kenny Wallace, Butch Gilliland, 
Scott Gaylord, Ron Hornaday and Bobby Hamilton. Wallace has an ace 
in the hole like he did last year, when he drove his red, white and 
blue Monte Carlo to a seventh place finish. He has had a unique preparation 
_ that is, interactive video games. ``I got ready for last year's 
race by competing on the Suzuka track in the NASCAR 98 game from EA 
Sports,'' said Wallace. ``Before last year, I'd never had the opportunity 
to come to Japan and race for real, so I did the next best thing by 
racing at Suzuka in the video game. The track in the game was identical 
to the real one in Japan, so it actually helped in my preparation.'' 
Among the racers are Dale Earnhardt, 47, ranked eighth in the Winston 
Cup, and his son Dale Earnhardt Jr., 24, top-ranked in the Busch Grand 
national. For the first time ever, the father and the son will compete 
in the same event. ``When I was a little kid watching my father race, 
I sat there and told myself I wish I would have a chance to race against 
him. And that's why this means something different, special and important,'' 
said the junior. His father says it's exciting to enter the race with 
his son for the first time. ``I remember the first time I rode in 
a race car with my dad (Ralph) and remember the first time I watched 
him race and also the first time I raced against him on the same track. 
I won't really call it a race. I could hardly keep up with him.'' 
The father had an eighth-fastest time of 36.064 seconds and the son 
was next in 36.277 seconds. Both drove Chevrolet Monte Carlo cars 
and they had no side-by-side races between them. The event will include 
practice and qualifying Saturday and a 201-lap race Sunday. The race 
Sunday offers a top prize of dlrs 105,000.
