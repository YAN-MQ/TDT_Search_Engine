The Mets traded their backup catcher Friday. And no, he was not Todd 
Hundley. As general manager Steve Phillips pointed out, Hundley is 
not considered a backup. How long the former all-star catcher will 
remain with the Mets, though, is anybody's guess, as the Mets and 
Baltimore Orioles attempt to work out a deal for him. Meanwhile, Phillips 
dealt Jorge Fabregas to the Florida Marlins for Oscar Henriquez, a 
hard-throwing right-hander. For Fabregas, 28, who grew up in Miami, 
the Marlins will be the fifth organization he has been with in the 
last three years. After being acquired by the Mets from the Arizona 
Diamondbacks with Willie Blair in the Bernard Gilkey deal at the July 
31 trading deadline last season, Fabregas hit .188 in 20 games as 
Mike Piazza's backup. The 6-foot-6-inch Henriquez was one of three 
players the Houston Astros traded to Florida for Moises Alou before 
last season. Henriquez, 24, was 0-0 with an 8.55 earned run average 
in 15 games for Florida and 1-0 with a 2.56 ERA and 11 saves for Class 
AAA Charlotte. ``He's a big power pitcher,'' Phillips said of Henriquez, 
adding that the pitcher will have to earn his way onto the Mets' roster. 
By then, Hundley will probably be elsewhere. ``I'm not locked into 
any date or deadline,'' Phillips said when asked when a trade would 
be made. Piazza's backup now, Phillips said, is Todd Pratt or Vance 
Wilson. And Hundley? ``Even if he's there,'' Phillips said, ``Todd 
is too good a player to be portrayed as a backup.'' Phillips is apparently 
working on a deal with Milwaukee for second baseman Fernando Vina, 
a Mets utilityman in 1994 who came into his own last season. The Brewers 
are believed to have asked for the right-handed pitching prospect 
Octavio Dotel and outfielder Jay Payton. The Mets are believed to 
be more likely to part with Payton than with Dotel, but Phillips said 
neither player was certain to be included in any deal. Because the 
Mets are trying to trade for a second baseman, they have yet to hold 
serious discussions with the representative for the free-agent third 
baseman Robin Ventura. Phillips did speak Friday with Ventura's agent, 
John Boggs, but apparently told him that he wanted to see how some 
other developments played out before making any offer. One possible 
development involves the free-agent outfielder B.J. Surhoff, who has 
been seeking a guaranteed fourth year in any contract offer from the 
Mets. ``We have not changed any offer today to Surhoff,'' Phillips 
said. And so the Mets, who have offered Surhoff a three-year deal 
for $17.25 million, apparently must wait for Surhoff to visit the 
Pittsburgh Pirates on Monday. Then there is Brian Jordan. Phillips 
indicated he had been hoping to talk with Jordan's agent, Jim Turner, 
but had been unable to do so.
