Finally scientists at the University of Virginia in Charlottesville, 
have just done a chemical analysis of hair, taken from that Stone 
Age man found frozen in an Alpine glacier eight years ago. Now you 
will remember they figured him for a hunter, due to the bow and arrow 
he was carrying as the glacier entrapped him 5,000 years ago. But 
guess what? Isotopes from the hair show that the iceman was a vegetarian. 
A preponderance of light isotopes of carbon and nitrogen denote a 
herbivore diet. Which makes you wonder why he was carrying that bow 
and arrow around. Well that is it for today. I am Brian Sislack, inviting 
you to join me next time for another edition of Science World.
