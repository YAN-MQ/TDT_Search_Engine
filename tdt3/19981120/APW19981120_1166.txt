United States Secretary of State Madeleine Albright said Friday that 
she believed Israel and the Palestinians would implement the latest 
peace accord after Israel had begun withdrawing troops from the West 
Bank as outlined in the agreement. Albright said in an interview with 
Israel television that she had just spoken by phone with Prime Minister 
Benjamin Netanyahu about the withdrawal, which was outlined in the 
land-for-security agreement signed Oct. 23 at the White House. Israel 
transferred 9.1 percent of the West Bank to full or partial Palestinian 
control earlier in the day as part of the three-phase pullback to 
be completed by the end of January. ``I think that we need to see 
this in a positive way in the fact that things are actually happening 
that people thought would not happen,'' Albright said. The secretary 
of state admonished Israeli and Palestinian leaders against making 
provocative statements as they had earlier in the week. Israeli Foreign 
Minister Ariel Sharon had called on Jewish settlers ``to move, to 
run, to grab more hills, expand the territory'' in the West Bank to 
prevent the lands from being transferred to the Palestinians. Palestinian 
leader Yasser Arafat said Monday that ``our rifles are ready'' to 
take Jerusalem. Both Sharon and Arafat later retracted or clarified 
their statements. ``I think there are examples of a few too much rhetoric, 
frankly, from both sides,'' Albright told the television. ``It's very 
important to look at the actions and the actions are moving very much 
in a positive direction,'' she added. The peace accord worked out 
at the Wye Plantation in Maryland also details several Palestinian 
actions against anti-Israeli militants and incitement. The Israeli 
Cabinet approved Friday's withdrawal only after verifying that the 
Palestinian Authority had begun to carry out several of the security 
measures. The Wye Memorandum effectively ended almost two years of 
deadlock in the peace process, caused largely by anti-Israeli attacks 
and Israeli demands for a tougher Palestinian stance against Islamic 
militants.
