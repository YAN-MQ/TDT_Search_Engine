Investigators looking into the crash of Swissair flight 111 say they 
have discovered one of the three engines was not working when the 
plane crashed. The lead investigator says small pieces of aluminum 
have been recovered off peggy's cove, Nova Scotia. He says the metal 
got so hot before the crash that it melted, and it's too early to 
say whether there was a fire in the plane before it went down. The 
plane crashed September 2nd, killing all 229 people aboard.
