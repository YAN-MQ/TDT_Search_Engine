Twenty years ago, Khalil Eid planted rows of olive trees on a rocky 
plot of land in his West Bank village. As the trees flourished, so 
did Eid's livelihood. He took the olives to family presses and sold 
bottles of oil. On Thursday, the 58-year-old Palestinian farmer watched 
from a wind-swept hillside while Israeli bulldozers and mechanical 
shovels ripped a swath of village land and uprooted his olive grove. 
The bulldozers, guarded by Israeli troops, were clearing land for 
13 bypass roads crisscrossing the West Bank and linking Jewish settlements 
that eventually will be surrounded by Palestinian territory. Israel 
says the roads are necessary for settlers' security. After agreeing 
to hand over some West Bank land, it announced last week it would 
confiscate thousands more acres (hectares) of Arab-owned land for 
highways. Palestinians say the roads will reinforce Israel's hold 
over the area and make it nearly impossible to divide the land for 
a future Palestinian state. ``I look at the West Bank in the year 
2005 and I see that it will look like Swiss cheese,'' said Khalil 
Tufjaki, chief cartographer for the Palestinian Authority. Most of 
the West Bank, home to 1.6 million Palestinians and 150,000 Israelis, 
will be sliced-up for bypass roads under the Israeli plan, he said. 
Palestinian official Nabil Amr called the land expropriations ``provocative,'' 
and correctly predicted violence. In the village of al-Khader near 
Bethlehem, Israeli troops clashed with Palestinian stone-throwers 
last weekend when clearing began there for a road connecting Jerusalem 
with the Jewish settlement of Efrat.
