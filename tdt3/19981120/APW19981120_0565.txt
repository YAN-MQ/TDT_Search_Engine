It seems the Santa Claus business in Britain has fallen on lean times. 
One of the country's largest suppliers of Santa Clauses reports a 
serious shortage of actors aspiring to play the jolly old elf this 
year _ a problem partly blamed on healthier eating trends. The Ministry 
of Fun, a London-based entertainment agency, demands that its Santas 
be convincing _ which means an authentic fat belly is required. ``Kids 
can spot padding,'' agency director Julian Pearson says. But fewer 
Santas are measuring up this year. ``They're eating salads and everything 
like this,'' Pearson says. ``This is not what we want. We need to 
fatten them up.'' Pearson faces finding Santas for about 470 engagements, 
ranging from store appearances to magazine shoots, in the weeks leading 
up to Christmas. So far, he's got only about 30 working, fewer than 
in previous years. The demand for Santas is especially high this season, 
so Pearson says he's even scanned ads in actors' trade newspapers 
trying to recruit older, portly actors _ preferably with their own 
white beards. But most physically suitable thespians refuse to subject 
themselves to the rigors of being Kris Kringle, he says. Francine 
Estry Elkinson's Manchester marketing agency also is deperately seeking 
suitable Santas. She agrees older actors with the right look and voice 
tend to be weight-conscious, which means they don't fill out the suit 
properly. ``I think everybody is facing the same sort of thing,'' 
she says of the shortage. Pearson says he'll take amateurs who look 
the part, but applicants must audition, and most don't make the cut. 
For the ones who do, the pay isn't bad _ about 100 pounds (dlrs 167) 
for a few hours of spreading good cheer. ``It's a huge job,'' Pearson 
says. ``It's the most magical job in the world.''
