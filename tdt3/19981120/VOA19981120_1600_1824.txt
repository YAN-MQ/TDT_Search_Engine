I am Dave Deforest, VOA News. Street celebrations have broken out 
across the Northern West Bank as Israel transferred full or partial 
control of the area to the Palestinians as part of the Wye Peace Deal. 
U.S. Secretary of State, Madeline Albright, called it an important 
step. There were those who thought that there could never be an agreement, 
then there were those who thought it would never be implemented, and 
I think that today is a very important step. Two more Israeli withdrawals 
are scheduled in the next 10 weeks. When the process is completed, 
Palestinians will hold 40 percent of the West Bank. Israel also released 
250 Palestinian inmates Friday.
