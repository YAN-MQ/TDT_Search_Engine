Tetsuya Fujita, a meteorologist who devised the standard scale for 
rating the severity of tornadoes and discovered the role of sudden 
violent down-bursts of air that sometimes cause airplanes to crash, 
died on Thursday at his home in Chicago. He was 78. Known as ``Ted 
the Tornado Man'' or ``Mr. Tornado,'' Fujita once told an interviewer, 
``anything that moves I am interested in.'' According to a colleague, 
he followed that interest to the last, though he had been ill for 
two years and bedridden recently. ``He did research from his bed until 
the very end,'' said James Partacz, a research meteorologist at the 
University of Chicago Wind Research Laboratory, of which Fujita was 
the director. With his wife, Sumiko, Fujita devised the Fujita scale 
of tornado wind speed and damage in 1951. It classifies tornadoes 
on a hierarchy beginning with the designation F0, or ``light'' (with 
winds of 40 to 72 mph), to F6, or ``inconceivable'' (with winds of 
319 to 379 mph). In the 1970s, he collaborated in the development 
of a sensing array, a rugged cylinder of instruments carried by tornado 
chasers on the ground who would anchor the cylinder in the path of 
an approaching tornado, then flee. The instrument package would record 
pressure, temperature, electrical phenomena and wind. Less well known 
than his work with tornadoes was Fujita's discovery of a type of wind 
called ``micro bursts,'' a small, localized downdraft that spreads 
out on or near the ground to produce 150-mph gusts that can knock 
airplanes out of the sky. The discovery stemmed from his investigation 
of an Eastern Airlines crash in 1975 at Kennedy International Airport 
in New York. The patterns of trees uprooted by tornadoes helped Fujita 
to refine the theory of micro bursts, as did similar patterns he had 
seen when he visited Nagasaki and Hiroshima, Japan, in 1945, just 
weeks after the atomic bombs were dropped there, to observe the effects 
of shock waves on trees and buildings. Fujita was born in Kitakyushu 
City, Japan, on Oct. 23, 1920. He graduated from the Meiji College 
of Technology in 1943 with a bachelor's degree in mechanical engineering, 
became an assistant professor there and earned a doctorate from Tokyo 
University in 1953. In 1947, after observing a severe thunderstorm 
from a mountain observatory in Japan, he wrote a report speculating 
on downdrafts of air within the storm. He sent the report to Horace 
Byers, chairman of the University of Chicago's meteorology department, 
who ultimately invited Fujita to Chicago and became his mentor. Fujita 
was fascinated by statistics _ any statistics. For years, he charted 
the Dow Jones average and the Consumer Price Index from the year of 
his birth, as well as his own blood pressure. Colleagues said he also 
had a gift for insight into the workings of the atmosphere. ``He often 
had ideas way before the rest of us could even imagine them,'' said 
James Wilson, a senior scientist at the National Center for Atmospheric 
Research in Boulder, Colo. Although he built a machine that could 
create miniature tornadoes in the laboratory, Fujita shunned computers. 
``He used to say that the computer doesn't understand these things,'' 
said Duane Stiegler, a Chicago meteorologist who worked with Fujita 
until his death. Fujita is survived by his wife and a son, Kazuya, 
a geology professor at Michigan State University in East Lansing.
