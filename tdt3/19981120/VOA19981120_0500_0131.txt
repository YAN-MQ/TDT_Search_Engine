The first sanction of the long planned international space station 
has been successfully placed in orbit after lift off from the Russian 
launch site in Kazakstan. The Russian space station module, Zadia, 
was launched atop a Russian booster rocket early today. The American 
space shuttle, Endeavor, will rendezvous with Zadia in two weeks to 
deliver a connecting module.
