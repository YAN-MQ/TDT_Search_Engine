College hoop highlights and the national league MVP next in "CNN Headline 
Sports." And later -- how private are your private phone conversations? 
Jeanne Moos is on the case. Dog, thinking: T-bone! T-bone! Looking 
for a T-bone! Chewy, meaty T-bone! At the big T-bone store! There's 
one! No, that's not one. Over there! no! no! On that shelf! ahh! Too 
green! Wait a minute! There! A whole package of little chewy, meaty 
T-bone steaks! Ya-hoo! I'm waking up! Mama brought you some T bonz 
dog snacks. Made with real meat, so dogs think... It's a T-bone! Resealable 
T bonz brand from Purina. It's a T-bone! With "CNN Headline Sports," 
I'm Russell Biven.
