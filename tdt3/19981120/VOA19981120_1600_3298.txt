A subway station as important culture? That is what New York State 
Parks Office believes as it recently nominated New York City subway 
system to the national register of historic places. By having the 
subway listed on the register, the stations would be eligible for 
state preservation grants and increased U.S. government funding. The 
historic designation would also protect the subway stations from modernization, 
which would alter its original look. New York City officials noted 
that the subway is sometimes considered, "an embarrassment." But that 
its historic and cultural importance is finally being appreciated. 
Some of New York's 48 subway stations have touches of elegance, such 
as the one at Wall Street, with it decorative Oak ticket booth. Several 
stations also feature colorful mosaic tile work and Barili sculpture. 
The subway system, in its 94th year, is the largest in the United 
States.
