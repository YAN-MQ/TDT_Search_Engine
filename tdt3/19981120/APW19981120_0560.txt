Six Chechen policemen who disappeared from their post over the weekend 
were freed on Friday by security forces, the ITAR-Tass news agency 
reported. The six were serving along the border between the regions 
of Chechnya and Ingushetia in Russia's troubled Caucasus region when 
they went missing. No details of the Ingush security operation to 
free the policemen were provided, ITAR-Tass said. Ingushetia has been 
torn by violence resulting from ethnic strife with nearby North Ossetia. 
It has also suffered a spillover of violence and kidnappings from 
breakaway Chechnya, where rebels fought a 1994-96 independence war 
with Russia.
