JERUSALEM (AP) _ UEFA has reinstated the European Under-18 Championships 
qualifying tournament in Israel, one week after the Gulf crisis prompted 
its cancelation last week, the Jerusalem Post reported Friday. UEFA 
told the Israel Football Association on Thursday that tensions surrounding 
the Iraq crisis had diminished enough to hold the tournament in Israel, 
the paper reported. The English, Israeli, Andorran and Spanish teams 
will coordinate new dates for the week-long tournament, the paper 
reported. The finals are scheduled to be played in Sweden next summer. 
UEFA canceled the events last Thursday after the English team said 
it would not attend because of the tense situation in the Gulf. The 
threat of U.S. military action against Iraq was averted Sunday when 
President Clinton accepted the Iraqi government's pledge to lift its 
three-month ban on U.N. weapons inspections. During the 1991 Gulf 
War, Iraq fired 39 Scud missiles with conventional warheads at Israeli 
cities.
