What is believed to be Vincent Van Goes' last self-portrait has sold 
for more than $71 million at auction. Portrait of the artist without 
his beard sold Thursday at Christi's New York Auction House for much 
more than its estimated price of $20 million. Van Goe painted the 
self-portrait in 1889 as a birthday present for his mother while he 
convalesced in France. The troubled Dutch artist had painted the portrait 
to show his mother he was in good health. But his face is heavily 
lined and his eyes are filled with emotion. Now this work is said 
to be one of Van Goe's most powerful works. The auction also sold 
works by Andy Worhall and Paul Sezahn. A 1904 painting by Sezahn called 
Chateau Noir, sold for $11 1/2 million. Several million dollars above 
its estimated price.
