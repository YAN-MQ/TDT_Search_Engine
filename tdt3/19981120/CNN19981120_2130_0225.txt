The immigration and naturalization service says it has shut down the 
largest and most sophisticated smuggling operation in U.S. history. 
Pierre Thomas has that. The immigration and naturalization service 
say they've attacked a New type of international crime organization, 
what they call "flesh cartels." We are here today to announce the 
takedown of the largest alien smuggling organization ever targeted 
in U.S. history. 12,000 people illegally smuggled into to the U.S. 
for at least $20,000 a head, a Gross intake in excess of $200 million 
in three years. They are being smuggled in by well-organized, well-financed 
international criminal networks. ? A series of sweeping raids in the 
Caribbean and United States, authorities arrested 21 people, taking 
down safe houses like this one in the Bahamas. Sources tell CNN some 
aliens were allegedly forced to work for illegally low wages. For 
some, it amounted to virtual slave labor. They could not complain 
or leave for fear of being deported. They came primarily from India, 
Pakistan, Afghanistan and Syria. Most were transported from Moscow, 
Cuba and Florida, sometimes passing through mass coe and Ecuador. 
We want to seize their assets planes, boats, stash houses and their 
cash. And to attack them as vigorously as we attack drug cartels. 
Justice officials say the crackdown demonstrates the increasingly 
global nature of crime. Officials declined to describe the jobs aliens 
were given because they hope not only to arrest the smugglers, but 
also employers who "made orders for aliens." Pierre Thomas, CNN.
