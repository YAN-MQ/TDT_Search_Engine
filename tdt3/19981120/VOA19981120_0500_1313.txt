The director of the scandal-plagued Fistina Cycling Team says no decision 
has been made on whether the team will take part in major races next 
year. At a news conference in Burns, Thursday, Juan Fernandez said 
the team wants to begin its square one and that the tour of Italy 
might be too difficult for the team next year. Fistina has been in 
turmoil since being expelled from the Tour de France this year after 
some of its riders admitted to taking performance-enhancing drugs. 
Three of its riders were banned from all competition until May 1 were 
taking the illegal substances. Top riders Alec Zewell, Aran DuFoe, 
and Richard Valan have all left the team. Last month Fistina cut its 
budget for next season in half and is renegotiating the contracts 
of all of its riders. And that is a look at sports. I am Steve Shy.
