The ethics advisor for U.S. special prosecutor, Kenneth Starr, has 
resigned to protest Mr. Starr's decision to testify at impeachment 
hearings against President Clinton. Advisor, Sam Dash, says Mr. Starr 
unlawfully intruded on congress' power of impeachment and became an 
aggressive advocate for impeaching the president. Mr. Starr says he 
believes he acted properly. I did not ask for the invitation. But 
I certainly readily accepted it and in my judgment, I think it was 
proper for me to do what I did. I think I had a duty to do what I 
did. Special prosecutor, Kenneth Starr.
