Microsoft is reportedly considering charging an annual fee to users 
of its windows system, starting in 2001. That news comes from a memo 
released at the company's antitrust trial thursday. The trial yielded 
a key question Thursday -- is Microsoft a monopoly? Steve young reports. 
To prove Microsoft is a monopolist, the government called the chief 
economist for the justice department's antitrust division under ronald 
Reagan. Frederick Warren boulton said Microsoft has had a 90% to 5% 
PC operating system share since 1990. And it's projected to go higher 
by 2001. But he said monopolies are measured by more than market share. 
The economist said the clincher in determining that Microsoft is a 
Monopolist is that it's been able to charge consumers significantly 
higher than competitive prices. But Microsoft argued the software 
business moves so fast, the usual definition of monopoly doesn't apply. 
If we ever stop innovating, we will quickly be passed by other companies 
in this industry. And that's why Microsoft invests over $3 billion 
a year in research and development to continually improve our products 
for consumers. Anybody who walks into a computer store or uses a PC 
wouldn't have any trouble answering the issue as to whether windows 
has a monopoly in the PC business. The government witness said Microsoft 
makes fat profits because software is a digital product. And those 
rich profits help the company keep its monopoly. The cost of putting 
windows on new PCs is practically zero. That's because Microsoft gives 
master copies of windows to computer companies and they absorb the 
cost of loading windows on to their computers. The economists said 
Microsoft gets a check just for granting a license. And he said there's 
evidence that Compaq computer, for example, paid microsoft $750 million 
in a single year. But late in the day, Microsoft's lawyer got the 
economist to concede he never would have guessed in 1995 that a major 
threat to Microsoft would be a company named Netscape. Steve young,
