An explosion demolished part of the deputy prime minister's office 
Friday, killing at least one person and wounding two others, according 
to a press report. The explosion rocked the capital Mbabane just before 
5 p.m. (1500 GMT). Hundreds of onlookers gathered as police and firemen 
searched the rubble and found three seriously injured victims, the 
South African Press Association reported. One man, believed a security 
guard, later died in a hospital, SAPA reported. The blast destroyed 
a security guard hut. It was not immediately clear if Deputy Prime 
Minister Arthur Khoza was in the area, or what might have caused the 
blast. On Oct. 28, an explosion badly damaged a bridge two hours after 
King Mswati III crossed it, injuring one person. In that case, police 
said they were investigating a possible connection to political activists 
who have been protesting Swaziland's ban on political parties. Swaziland 
is a country of 1 million people sandwiched between South Africa and 
Mozambique.
