Israeli warplanes struck Friday in southern Lebanon, retaliating for 
attacks on Israeli outposts in which three guerrillas died. Two Israeli 
jets fired two air-to-surface missiles on a valley between the villages 
of Toulin and Kabrigha, Lebanese security officials said. Israel believes 
the area is a base for Lebanese guerrillas opposed to Israel's occupation 
of the border region in southern Lebanon. There was no immediate word 
on casualties. An Israeli army spokesman said the planes returned 
safely to base after hitting targets. The air raid followed attacks 
on Israeli and allied positions in the border enclave early Friday, 
the Lebanese officials said on customary condition of anonymity. They 
said guerrillas of the Syrian-backed Amal group carried out the attacks. 
An Israeli army spokesman said three guerrillas were killed but he 
did not identify their group. Amal denied any of its fighters were 
killed. The attacks come at a time of heightened tension in which 
Israel has been launching air raids over southern Lebanon almost daily. 
Israel occupied the border region in 1985 to shield its northern towns 
against cross-border attacks. Israel suffered its heaviest losses 
in the zone in more than a year when the guerrilla group Hezbollah 
killed three Israeli soldiers with a roadside bomb Nov. 16.
