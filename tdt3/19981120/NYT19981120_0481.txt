George Steinbrenner is close to completing a deal to sell a majority 
interest in the Yankees to Cablevision, a media company that owns 
the Rangers, the Knicks and Madison Square Garden, two business associates 
of Steinbrenner's said Friday. The sale will probably be concluded 
early next year, they said, and would keep Steinbrenner in charge 
of the team. ``As far as I know there's nothing that's been signed,'' 
said a lawyer involved with the team, ``but they are probably close 
to a handshake. It's very, very warm.'' One detail yet to be resolved 
is how much some of the minor partners would be paid for their shares. 
It is not clear how large an obstacle that could be to the sale. ``He 
hasn't finalized it yet,'' another associate said of Steinbrenner. 
``There are a few things he has to work out,'' he said, but added 
that it was likely that the deal would be completed. Steinbrenner 
said in a telephone interview Friday that he had not reached a deal 
to sell a majority interest in the team, but he acknowledged that 
a sale was a topic of discussion at a partners' meeting in Cleveland 
on Thursday. ``We discussed the possibilities before us, and we have 
several,'' Steinbrenner said. Asked if talks with Cablevision continued, 
he said: ``They've been ongoing for over a year and a half. They're 
not the only talks. But there is absolutely nothing at this point.'' 
The lawyer who discussed the pending sale, speaking on the condition 
of anonymity, said that in the deal under consideration, Steinbrenner 
would not sell his entire 60 percent share of the Yankees but ``a 
significant portion'' of it. He said he also understood that some 
of the limited partners would sell their shares, but others would 
retain their interests. It was unclear Friday night how large a stake 
in the team Cablevision was preparing to buy. But under the terms 
being negotiated, the team's value would be placed at more than $600 
million, according to one person close to Steinbrenner. Steinbrenner 
and Cablevision have been discussing a deal off and on for most of 
the year. At one point the talks cooled off, only to be revived as 
the Yankees headed toward the end of the World Championship season. 
Cablevision, a Long Island company run by Charles Dolan, sees the 
Yankees as a valuable property because of the television programming 
they provide. Cablevision currently has rights to the Yankees under 
a 12-year, $486 million contract, and would almost certainly have 
to pay even more for a new deal. At those prices, Cablevision executives 
figure, they might as well own the team. Completing his 26th year 
as the team's principal owner, Steinbrenner has long said he would 
not sell the Yankees. He never seriously considered previous offers. 
When Madison Square Garden owned cable rights to Yankee games, before 
it was bought by Cablevision, its officials, too, tried to buy at 
least a part of the team, but got nowhere. But now the timing favors 
a sale. Steinbrenner has acknowledged that he is not getting any younger 
_ he is 68 _ and neither his sons, Henry and Harold, nor his son-in-law, 
Steve Swindal, has expressed an interest in owning and operating the 
team. Henry Steinbrenner, known as Hank, was once briefly involved 
in the team operation about a dozen years ago. Harold Steinbrenner 
and Swindal are general partners of the Yankees but have played no 
visible role in the operation of the club. George Steinbrenner would 
not have to own a majority of the club to be the managing partner. 
He owned less than 50 percent when he and his partners bought the 
team from CBS for $10 million in 1973, and he was the managing partner. 
More recently, Walt Disney Co. bought 25 percent of the Anaheim Angels 
from Gene Autry and became the managing partner. The only difference 
would be the oddity of Steinbrenner's working for someone else. As 
the managing partner, he would have a free hand in running the Yankees, 
but he would still be acting in that role under an agreement with 
the majority owner. It is not known how long that agreement would 
keep him in that position. The value of the Yankees has always been 
high, but the club's price tag has become even more lucrative with 
their two World Series championships in the last three years. Dolan 
of Cablevision obviously likes what the Yankees have done for Cablevision 
in that time and would welcome Steinbrenner's continued operation. 
``I'm very fond of Chuck Dolan,'' Steinbrenner said Friday. ``We're 
both from Cleveland.''
