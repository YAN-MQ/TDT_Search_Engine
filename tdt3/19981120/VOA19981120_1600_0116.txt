A court in Rome has freed Kurdish rebel leader, Abdullah Ocalan from 
jail. But ordered him to remain in Rome while his appeal for political 
asylum is considered. Turkish officials who want to put Mr. Ocalan 
on trial for treason and terrorism warned Italy that it will face 
eternal hostility from Turkey for its refusal to extradite the country's 
most wanted fugitive. Gulland Aliraza, of the Washington Center for 
Strategic and International Studies explains Turkey's anger. There 
was euphoria when Ocalan was detained in Rome and the expectation 
was that he would be returned within a few days. And now, there is 
this deep disappointment, which has turned to anger, against Italy, 
primarily, and against the West I am afraid for its failure to understand 
the Turkish case. And I think almost anything short of war between 
Turkey and Italy is possible. Germany has also sought Mr. Ocalan's 
extradition on charges of terrorism, but said Friday it is dropping 
the request for the time being.
