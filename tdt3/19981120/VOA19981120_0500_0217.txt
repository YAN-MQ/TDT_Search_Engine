South Korea says the United States and North Korea will likely hold 
another round of talks early next month on opening a suspected nuclear 
site for U.S. inspection. South Korean officials say Pyongyang has 
asked that the meeting be held here in Washington. Earlier this week, 
special U.S. envoy Charles Cartman held two days of intensive talks 
with North Korean officials. U.S. officials confirmed that North Korea 
asked for $300 million in exchange for an inspection of the site. 
The request was turned down. Meanwhile, a new report says the North 
Koreans are building at least two new launch facilities for their 
medium range missile.
