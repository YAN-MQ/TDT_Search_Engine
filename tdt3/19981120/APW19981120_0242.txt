Slumping demand pushed Singapore's non-oil exports _ a barometer of 
the country's trade-driven economy _ down 4.8 percent in October from 
a year earlier, the government said Friday. Non-oil domestic exports, 
including crucial electronics products, dropped to 8.01 billion Singapore 
dollars (dlrs 4.93 billion), said Singapore's Trade Development Board, 
well below analysts' forecasts. ``The depressed global demand conditions 
for electronic and related products, as well as fallen demand from 
Asian economies hit by the financial crisis, continued to take its 
toll on Singapore's external trade,'' said TDB, which is part of the 
Ministry of Trade and Industry. The slump hits Singapore as it is 
slipping into a technical recession. A vital component of Singapore's 
non-oil exports is electronics, which plunged 6.2 percent in October 
compared to the same period last year. Electronics are the country's 
biggest export item, totaling nearly 70 percent of exports. Low prices 
and an over-capacity of printed circuit boards, integrated circuits, 
personal computers and printers were the primary culprits in the sector's 
poor performance. In September, Singapore's total non-oil domestic 
exports rose 1.7 percent from a year earlier, while electronics exports 
shrank 1.2 percent. Meanwhile, oil exports in October plunged 21 percent 
from a year before, after a 12.8 percent fall in September. Government 
economists attributed the fall to depressed oil prices and weak demand 
from major Asian markets.
