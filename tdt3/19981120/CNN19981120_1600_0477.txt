A new study shows a dramatic decline in the percentage of women who 
smoke while pregnant. The centers for disease control and prevention 
says the number of pregnant smokers dropped 26% between 1990 and 1996. 
That's mostly because of a dramatic decrease in smoking by women in 
their 20s and 30s. The percentage of pregnant teenagers who smoke 
has actually increased slightly. Smoking during pregnancy has been 
found to increase the chances for illness in babies.
