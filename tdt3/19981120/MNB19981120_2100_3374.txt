Last yeer at this time the country was wondering what would become 
of the mcCaughey Septuplets. All seven just turned 1 year old and 
they are thriving. What about the parents, Bobbi and Kenny McCaughey? 
Anesthetic Curry spent a day with them and filed this report for "the 
today show" on NBC's. 6:45 ram, seven little alarm clocks are going 
off in this tiny home in carlisle, Iowa. Before Kenny McCaughey goes 
to work he supervises breakfast for his hungry family. This is the 
first of up to 32 serial or formula bottles the Septuplets devour 
daily. Morning. How are you, bop bi? I can't believe how big themplet 
Kenny leaves for work. 8:45 A.M., bath time. The sink soon overflows 
with chubby thrise thighs and sweet cheeks. Once a week, Bobbi makes 
sure each child is tipping the scale in the right direction. Good, 
almost 14 pounds. Great. ok. They're dressed, socks on. About an hour 
to get them dressed and all cleaned up. Now what? Do you take a break? 
Now is wh when you get them ready for a nap? First a little housekeeping. 
So all the things they were sleeping in get washed? ok. One of 15 
loads of laundry each week. 10:00 A.M., three hours after the babies 
woke up, they go down for a nap and Bobbi grabs time with their older 
sister, mikayla. The babies are up, 45 minutes later, and it's play 
time. Watermelon, watermelon, how it drips how it drips, up and down 
my elbows, up andown my elbows, spit out the pits. Noon. Bobbi takes 
three babies battling respiratory infections to the doctor. Dp 00 
P.M., 12 jars of baby food comingight up. no, no, no. Like clockwork 
Nathan needs a diaper change, one of 40 in this family every day. 
4:30 sharp, it's nap number three. 7:00 P.M., Kenny, home from work, 
is cleaning up after a quick dinner. Husband tries to do dishes. His 
stepmom assists with the eve anyone ritual and the day ends -- Look 
what I got! The way it began 12 hours earlier. Night Night.
