Austria's Stefan Eberharter won a men's World Cup giant slalom on 
Friday by doing something teammate Hermann Maier couldn't _ finish. 
Eberharter was standing at the bottom, having already posted a time 
of 2 minutes, 14.75 seconds for two runs down the C.B.'s Run course, 
when Maier charged out of the starting gate. Maier, the Olympic and 
World Cup champion, led the first run by .35 seconds over Eberharter 
and seemed well on his way to winning his second race of the season 
in as many starts. But he hooked a ski on a gate and skied off the 
course, giving victory to Eberharter. Maier, furious with himself, 
slammed down his skis and poles, vaulted a plastic safety fence and 
charged away through the crowd. Eberharter, meanwhile, showed little 
emotion, then bent down to take off his skis. Although Maier won the 
Olympic and World Cup GS titles, it is now Eberharter who has the 
advantage in that discipline by winning two of the last three races. 
He won the final GS of last season and placed second to Maier in the 
season opener last month at Solden, Austria. Maier's crash allowed 
another teammate, Christian Mayer, to claim second in 2:15.27. Marco 
Buechel of Liechtenstein, fifth after the opening run, got third, 
his best-ever result, in 2:15.68. He celebrated by pumping his fists 
in the air and flopping onto his back in the snow. Kjetil Andre Aamodt 
of Norway, eighth after the morning session, was fourth in 2:15.83 
and Italy's Patrick Holzer rounded out the top five in 2:15.98. Jure 
Kosir of Slovenia, Siegfried Voglreiter of Austria, Bode Miller of 
Franconia, New Hampshire, Lasse Kjus of Norway and Michael Von Gruenigen 
of Switzerland completed the top 10. Miller, an unknown when he surprised 
with an 11th-place finish here a year ago, was seventh in the morning 
only to struggle a bit in the afternoon. Yet he only dropped one spot 
and, with an eighth, posted a career best. Von Gruenigen, the 1996 
and 1997 World Cup GS champ and second to Maier last season, was only 
22nd in the morning. The fastest time of the afternoon, 1:07.18, vaulted 
him 12 places in the standings. Paul Casey Puckett of Boulder, Colorado, 
was 25th in 2:17.75 and Thomas Vonn of Newburgh, New York, was 27th 
in 2:19.19. Canada's Thomas Grandi, 17th in the morning, finished 
14th in 2:16.87.
