The man who Served as Ken Starr's ethics adviser resigned his post 
today. Former Watergate counsel Sam dash made the decision to protest 
Starr's appearance before the house Judiciary committee. He says Starr 
violated his obligation under the independent counsel statute by aggressively 
arguing for impeachment. Starr says he disagrees with dash but respects 
his decision to resign. Sam dash is a man of total principle and I 
love Sam dash. And I think he did feel strongly that, while we had 
properly submitted the referral to Congress, that it was wrong for 
me to go forward and to testify yesterday in the way that, as he saw 
it, that I did. And I love Sam. I respect him. I admire him, I think 
he's a total man of principle. I have really profited from his judgment.
