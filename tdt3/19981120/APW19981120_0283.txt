A heavy overnight snowfall in Kosovo forced the rerouting of aid convoys 
Friday amid concerns about reaching refugees sheltered in remote villages. 
The United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees diverted three aid 
convoys carrying food, blankets and mattresses, originally destined 
for three distribution points west of Pristina, to Podujevo, about 
30 kilometers (20 miles) north of the capital, after a snowfall of 
between 20 and 50 centimeters (20 inches), said the organization's 
spokesman, Fernando del Mundo. Although UNHCR says there are no longer 
any refugees living out in the open, many are sheltering in the homes 
of friends and relatives or have managed to rebuild a warm room in 
their destroyed houses and need aid supplies to survive the winter. 
``It's going to be a major problem, especially in mountain areas,'' 
del Mundo said. ``Even in the towns and cities, people are sharing 
food with displaced people sheltering there. ... Until the next harvest, 
they will need support.'' Up to 300,000 people in the Serbian province 
of Kosovo have been left homeless since government forces cracked 
down on separatist Albanian rebels in late February. Hundreds more, 
mostly ethnic Albanian civilians, have been killed. The crackdown 
ended with an Oct. 12 agreement signed by Yugoslav President Slobodan 
Milosevic under the threat of NATO airstrikes. The separatist guerrillas 
have grudgingly accepted a cease-fire. UNHCR has been sending out 
two to three relief convoys six days a week, with large convoys consisting 
of about 20 trucks going to the major distribution points three times 
a week. From there, the aid is transported to villages, using smaller 
vehicles. But heavy snowfall can cause many of the dirt tracks leading 
to villages to become impassable. Aid convoys were not the only ones 
affected by the snow. The principal ethnic Albanian leader, Ibrahim 
Rugova, failed to appear at his scheduled news conference on Friday 
morning due to the bad weather conditions. The weather bureau forecast 
continued snowfall until Saturday.
