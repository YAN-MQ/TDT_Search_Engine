A Jewish leader said Friday he has suspended a contract with a kosher 
butcher after cattle corpses were found in a chapel in a Jewish cemetery 
in northern Romania. The cemetery watchman also owns a meat company 
that supplies kosher beef to the 400-member Jewish community in the 
Transylvanian city of Cluj. The daily Evenimentul Zilei reported Friday 
that the unidentified man was slaughtering cattle while on duty at 
the cemetery, and the chapel served as a natural refrigerator. The 
rear ends of six freshly slaughtered cattle were found Wednesday on 
the floor of the chapel, where coffins are held awaiting burial, said 
Nicolae Kallos, leader of the Jewish community in Cluj, some 325 kilometers 
(203 miles) northwest of Bucharest. Kallos declined to identify the 
cemetery watchman or provide other details of the incident. The Jewish 
community immediately suspended the contract with the company and 
also informed health authorities, who fined the watchman, Kallos said.
