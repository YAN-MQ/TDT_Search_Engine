"Star wars" mania is building again. Six months before the prequel 
to the successful movie series is scheduled to be released. Fans are 
paying a full price movie ticket just to see the trailer to "star 
wars episode one: the phantom menace." But you don't have to go to 
the theater to see it. You refer to the prophecy of the one who will 
bring balance to the force. You believe it's this boy? He can see 
things before they happen. Can help you. The force is unusually strong 
with him. He was meant to help you. Take off! Will I ever see you 
again? What does your heart tell you? Are you sure about this, trusting 
our fate to a boy we hardly know? Anakin skywalker, meet obi-Wan kenobi. 
I sense much fear in you. The boy is dangerous. They all sense it. 
Why can't you? Fear is the path to the dark side. Fear leads to anger, 
anger leads to hate. Hate leads to suffering. The movie, starring 
Liam Neeson, Ewan McGregor and Samuel L. Jackson, is scheduled to 
be released May 21st.
