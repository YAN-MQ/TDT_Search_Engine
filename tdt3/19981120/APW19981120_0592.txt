Citing growing tensions between Italy and Turkey, Italian league champion 
Juventus said Friday no Italian fans will be accompanying the team 
to its Champions League match in Istanbul. Italy and Turkey are locked 
in a standoff over a Turkish Kurd rebel leader arrested in Rome last 
week. Feeling is running strong in Turkey over Italy's refusal to 
immediately send him back for trial as a terrorist. The Turin team's 
safety in Istanbul is ``a big worry,'' Juventus manager Luciano Moggi 
acknowledged Friday. While the club is ready to play Galatasaray on 
Wednesday, it said no fan will be traveling to Turkey to support the 
team. ``Members of the VIP club, which usually travel with the team, 
will also stay home. Only players and team officials will go to Istanbul,'' 
said a spokesman for the team, who spoke on condition he not be identified 
by name. He refused to say if it was an independent decision by the 
fans' clubs or a move ordered for security reasons. Italian Premier 
Massimo D'Alema, who had been initially invited to watch the game 
in Istanbul, also gave up the trip. Europe's governing body for soccer, 
UEFA, said a final decision about whether to play next week's match 
would be made Monday. ``We are ready to play, under condition security 
is guaranteed. We will stick to UEFA's decision,'' the club spokesman 
said. Juventus coach Marcello Lippi was quoted by Milan's sports daily 
Gazzetta dello Sport as saying ``we hope we don't go to Turkey.'' 
Juventus, which needs a victory against Galatasaray to keep alive 
its qualifying chances, clearly would prefer to play the match on 
a neutral field rather than at home of the Turkish champion. With 
four draws in as many games of Group B, Juventus' chances to reach 
its fourth final since 1996 are in jeopardy. Galatasaray is the group 
leader. The Turin team is owned by the Agnelli family, which controls 
Italy's Fiat auto giant.
