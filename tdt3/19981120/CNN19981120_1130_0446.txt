I'm meteorologist Dave Hennen with your "CNN Headline News Weather." 
A cold day over the northern midwest today, with forecast temperatures 
only in the 20s. And it's turning cooler in the southeast. Still one 
more mild day, though, along the eastern seaboard. Forecast later 
today on into Saturday shows wet weather along that front in the east. 
Quickly dissipating, though, as we head through tomorrow morning. 
There'll be lingering cloud cover in the northeast. The windy, wet 
weather will continue, though, in the pacific northwest as high pressure 
builds in. We will see the drier weather pushing into the southeast 
along with some cooler temperatures. Extended forecast -- on Sunday, 
60s, 70s will dominate the weather over much of the plains. Above 
normal for this time of the year. It will be a little cool in the 
northeast, only in the 40s, with rain and wind continuing in the pacific 
northwest right on into Monday. We'll find some showers scattered 
over the Great Lakes on Monday as temperatures begin to moderate over 
much of the Great Lakes back into the 40s and 50s, and the 50s return 
to the northeast as the wet weather continues along much of the west 
coast. For more weather information, log into CNN.com, where there 
are four-day forecasts available for more than 7,200 cities.
