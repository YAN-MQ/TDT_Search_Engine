A Rome court on Friday set free a Kurdish rebel leader detained when 
he came to Italy seeking asylum, drawing immediate threats of retaliation 
against Italy from outraged Turkish leaders. The court threw out a 
Turkish arrest warrant for Abdullah Ocalan under a law barring extradition 
in death penalty cases. Although the court ordered Ocalan to stay 
in Rome, Justice Minister Oliviero Diliberto indicated the rebel chief 
would be freed from even that restriction on Dec. 23 if Germany chose 
not to pursue extradition on its own warrant against him by then. 
Hundreds of Ocalan's supporters danced in a Rome piazza at news of 
his release from a military hospital, where he had been held since 
his flight landed at Rome's international airport on Nov. 12. In Turkey, 
Prime Minister Mesut Yilmaz declared: ``Italy risks facing the eternal 
enmity of Turkey.'' ``Every wrong turn has a very hard price to pay, 
and the Turkish state is powerful enough to make them pay that price,'' 
Yilmaz said of Italian leaders. He did not specify what that price 
might be. Ocalan leads the Kurdistan Workers Party, or PKK, which 
has fought a 14-year-old war for autonomy for Kurds in Turkey's southeast. 
The conflict has killed 37,000 people. Ocalan, a fugitive overseas 
during much of the conflict, is on trial in absentia on capital charges 
in Turkey, which had demanded his extradition. Yilmaz appealed to 
NATO for support in the clash between the two NATO partners, describing 
as Ocalan ``the worst terrorist of the century.'' U.S. Secretary of 
State Madeleine Albright backed Turkey's stand on Ocalan, telling 
a Washington news conference, ``It is very important that he be brought 
to justice'' _ if not in Turkey, then in Italy or Germany. Ocalan 
has been wanted in Gerrmany on charges of terrorism since 1990. Germany, 
however, said it would not seek the extradition of the rebel chief, 
at least not for now. Italian Premier Massimo D'Alema promised Italy 
would keep Ocalan under surveillance to ``guarantee that he can't 
carry out terrorist activities or any hostile activities against Turkey.'' 
Ocalan asked the thousands of Kurds who have traveled to Rome to show 
solidarity to return home and sustain the Kurdish cause through legal 
and democratic means. ``I don't want our people to keep protesting 
and setting themselves on fire and I don't want any behavior that 
might reflect badly on the Kurdish people,'' Ocalan said in a statement 
read by a spokesman. Italy's refusal to turn over Ocalan has infuriated 
Turks, who know him as the leader of terror bombings and guerrilla 
warfare. Protesters have burned Italian flags outside the Italian 
Embassy in Turkey and launched a boycott of Italian goods. Families 
of soldiers killed in the Kurdish conflict urged the government Friday 
to do everything necessary to bring ``this murderer'' to Turkey. ``The 
blood of our children and our husbands will not be left unanswered,'' 
the families said in a statement. Additionally, ``It is clear that 
we will review our economic and trade relations with a government, 
which by keeping the murderer of 30,000 people and providing him haven, 
is becoming an accomplice to his crimes,'' Defense Minister Ismet 
Sezgin said from Ankara. Foreign Minister Lamberto Dini denounced 
the boycott, calling the action ``an aggression against all of Europe.''
