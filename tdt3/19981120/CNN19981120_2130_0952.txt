Florida's attorney-general says 22 states are investigating allegations 
ford motor company allowed dealers to cheat customers. He claims people 
who wanted to buy cars they had been leasing before the lease was 
completed were sometimes told they owed hundreds or thousands of dollars 
more than they actually did. He claims some dealers then pocketed 
the difference after forwarding the correct balance to Ford. Investigators 
believe Ford may have provided training materials to help dealers 
cheat customers. The company denies it broke the law.
