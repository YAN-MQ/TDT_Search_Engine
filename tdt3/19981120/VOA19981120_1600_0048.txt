I am John Brachard, VOA News. Israeli troops have handed over a wide 
area of the northern West Bank to Yasser Arafat's Palestinian Authority, 
in accordance with the U.S. brokered Wye River Interim Peace Agreement. 
And Palestinians are celebrating the move. VOA's David Gullest reports 
from Jerusalem. After some last minute disputes over the new boundaries, 
Israel handed over or gave the Palestinians partial control over more 
than 500 square kilometers of the West Bank. There were street celebrations 
as Palestinian police arrived in Kovatia, the largest of more than 
20 villages and towns under Arab for the first time in more than 30 
years. But there was bitterness in nearby Jewish settlements. Some 
of which are now nearly encircled by Palestinian land. Settler spokesman, 
David Wilder. There are, I think, two or three communities there that 
have been, unless, not only are they isolated, but they are surrounded 
and prone to attacks on all sides, without any measures having been 
taken yet to protect them. Two more withdrawals are schedule in the 
next ten weeks, when the process is completed, the Palestinian Authority 
will control 40 percent of the West Bank. David Gullest, VOA News, 
Jerusalem.
