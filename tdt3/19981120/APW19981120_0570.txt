A sea of mostly impoverished Romanians lined up outside the presidential 
palace, waiting in the freezing cold for their chance to see their 
president, media reported Friday. But despite falling living standards, 
the 5,000 people who pushed and shoved their way inside the palace 
gates weren't calling for the resignation of President Emil Constantinescu 
and his government. They were well-wishers who wanted to kiss his 
cheek on his 59th birthday. While thousands of people across the country 
marched in the streets Thursday, protesting Constantinescu's failure 
to retool the economy along market lines, the president received his 
guests _ and their kisses _ in a large marble drawing room with hand-woven 
carpets. Greeting people, Constantinescu acknowledged times were hard. 
``I can't do too much for you, but I can try to respond to the love 
and faith you have in me,'' said Constantinescu as people broke into 
a spontaneous ``Happy Birthday.'' Some people brought huge bouquets. 
Others brought him letters asking for help with their hardships. Prime 
Minister Radu Vasile gave the president an antique sword and a group 
of students brought him a tank of 59 turtles _ a wish for a long life. 
The director of pro-government daily Ziua published a letter Friday 
congratulating Constantinescu on his birthday, in a style reminiscent 
of fawning letters sent to former communist dictator Nicolae Ceausescu, 
who was executed in 1989. Under Ceausescu, people were forced to wish 
the leader a happy birthday. Former President Ion Iliescu opened the 
presidential palace and offered well-wishers a glass of champagne 
on his birthday, and Constantinescu has carried on the tradition. 
Explaining the fervor, Tudor Oltean, a former government official 
said: ``Romanians like to use any occasion for kissing and bowing, 
to show how faithful and obedient they are,'' he said. ``After that, 
they are faithful to the next person in power.''
