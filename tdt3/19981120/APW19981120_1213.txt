Iraq hasn't turned over documents detailing its weapons of mass destruction, 
as demanded by the chief U.N. weapons inspector, but did send two 
letters about the request Friday, U.N. officials said. A spokesman 
for the U.N. Special Commission, Gustavo Zlauvinen, declined to describe 
the content of the letters from Iraq's deputy foreign minister, Riyadh 
al-Qaisi. ``We are studying them and we are analyzing what we should 
do,'' he said. U.S. President Bill Clinton specifically cited one 
of the requested documents _ an air force log detailing munitions 
used during the 1980-88 Iran-Iraq war _ in his speech Sunday that 
detailed what information Iraq must provide to avoid airstrikes. Chief 
inspector Richard Butler formally requested the log in a letter Wednesday 
to Deputy Prime Minister Tariq Aziz. Two other letters asked for documents 
relating to biological weapons and other programs. His requests came 
after Iraq _ facing threatened U.S. and British airstrikes _ pledged 
over the weekend to resume full cooperation with Butler's U.N. Special 
Commission, or UNSCOM, which is charged with dismantling Iraq's weapons 
of mass destruction. Baghdad severed all cooperation on Oct. 31. The 
Security Council imposed sanctions in 1990 after Iraq invaded Kuwait, 
sparking the Gulf war. Sanctions can only be lifted once inspectors 
certify that Iraq has destroyed its biological, chemical and nuclear 
weapons _ and the missiles used to deliver them. The United States 
and Britain have said the military threat remains to ensure that Baghdad 
cooperates fully. Butler said Thursday that he would ``happily'' tell 
the Security Council that he had accounted for all of Iraq's banned 
arms if Baghdad provided the documents that answer questions about 
what types of weapons of mass destruction Iraq produced and where 
the weapons are now. ``They are the history. They are the palpable 
record of what is actually happened with some hideous and illegal 
weapons,'' Butler told the Overseas Press Club. Inspectors discovered 
the air force document in July but were prevented from taking it. 
The Iraqi responses to the first two of Butler's three requests were 
received as inspectors returned to work for a third day. Over the 
next week, Butler said, he will start compiling teams who will go 
on unannounced searches of suspected weapons sites _ visits which 
have been the most confrontational but also have given inspectors 
some of their best information over the past seven years. Butler said 
he planned to conduct the ``whole spectrum'' of inspections before 
reporting back to the council on the level of Iraq's cooperation in 
three to four weeks. The council has said it would conduct a complete 
overview of Baghdad's compliance with U.N. resolutions once Butler 
has reported that inspectors have received that cooperation. Iraq 
hopes the so-called ``comprehensive review'' will lead to a lifting 
of the eight-year-old U.N. oil embargo, which has devastated its economy. 
But U.N. and Western diplomats noted that the more Iraq cooperates 
with inspectors in the short term _ by turning over documents, for 
example _ the more it could actually hurt its chances of having sanctions 
lifted if that cooperation reveals that its arms programs have not 
been dismantled. With more information, countries that take a harder 
line against Baghdad, particularly the United States, would have that 
much more ammunition to justify keeping sanctions in place until their 
stated goal of ousting Saddam Hussein is met, the diplomats said.
