The environmental group Greenpeace and 11 other organizations want 
the U.S. government to immediately ban all vinyl toys for children 
under the age of 6. the groups say many of the toys contain toxic 
substances that can be chewed or sucked by young children. For instance, 
they say a chemical softener that makes some vinyl toys flexible is 
highly toxic when digested by animals. Greenpeace says the toys should 
be tested for safety in the same way drugs are tested. Unlike our 
drugs and other materials that must be tested for safety and efficacy, 
for the food, drug and cosmetic act, toys can be marketed as poison 
without any information until they're proven by the government to 
be unsafe. That's a Burden of proof that the government and the taxpayers 
should not have to bear, and it's a Burden of risk to our children 
that is unacceptable both legally and ethically. A chemical manufacturers 
association researcher says the toys have been tested for 25 years 
and have been deemed safe.
