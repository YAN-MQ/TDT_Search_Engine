U.N. weapons inspectors did not observe a traditional Muslim day of 
rest. Three U.N. trucks and their Iraqi escorts headed out toward 
unnamed locations. The inspectors say they want to get as much done 
as they can in as little time as possible. It's the third day the 
inspectors have been back at work since the end of the standoff with 
Iraq.
