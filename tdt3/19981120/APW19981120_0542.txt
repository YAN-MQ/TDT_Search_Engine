Assault charges cannot be filed against a Kenyan police officer who 
savagely beat his wife four months ago until police received a medical 
report, a police official said Friday. And the medical report has 
to include comments from the woman, who remains in serious condition 
in Kenyatta Hospital, unable to speak, four months after the July 
31 beating. ``I confirmed today the medical report cannot be done 
until the victim recovers,'' said senior Nairobi police official Gabriel 
Thinwa. ``The patient is not talking, and this where the main evidence 
is expected to come from.'' Thinwa denied newspaper and television 
reports that police have failed to take action against Constable Felix 
Nthinwa Munyao. ``We have completed our investigations, and at present 
Officer Munyao had been interdicted (suspended) pending court action,'' 
said Thinwa, who is Munyuo's commanding officer. No charges have been 
filed against another police officer who doused his girlfriend with 
parrafin last month and set her afire after a quarrel. The woman died 
of burns. Thinwa said police have established that Munyuo had a quarrel 
with his wife Betty Kavata during which she was seriously beaten and 
later hospitalized. The Daily Nation on Friday quoted doctors as saying 
only divine intervention could save her life. ``The patient's memory 
is gone. Her chances of survival are minimal,'' the newspaper quoted 
her doctor as saying. Wife-beating is common throughout Kenya, and 
sociologists and criminologists say it is on the rise, partly because 
of Kenya's worsening economic situation. The private Coalition of 
Violence Against Women plans to launch a 16-day awareness campaign 
Wednesday to highlight violence against women and girls in the East 
African nation.
