The Palestinian Authority refusing to take over West Bank areas vacated 
by Israel in the first stage of its pull-out under the Wye River Interim 
Peace Accord. The Palestinians say the territory is smaller than what 
has been agreed upon. Israeli radio says the ministerial committee 
on withdrawal affairs made last minute changes on the maps and Palestinian 
leader, Yasser Arafat, is demanding to see them. Senior commanders 
from the two sides overseeing the pull out have flown by helicopter 
to Hebron for a meeting with Mr. Arafat in the first stage of the 
interim accord Palestinians are to gain partial control over two percent 
more land and full control over 7.1 percent more land.
