The U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service is proposing more protection for 
the short-tailed albatross. Which was hunted nearly to extinction 
in the late 1800s. The bird received official protection status under 
the Endangered Species Act 25 years ago. However, an administration 
oversight limited that protection to the bird's Japanese nesting places. 
To remedy the situation, the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service has proposed 
extending protection to the Bird's U.S. range. In Alaska's Illution 
Islands, and in the northwest islands of Hawaii. If approved by congress, 
the proposal will go into effect within a year. With U.S. Environment 
Briefs, I am Roseanne Scurble.
