The Asbury Park Board of Education has taken legal steps to dismiss 
the high school athletic director, whose decision to allow two academically 
ineligible students to play football forced the school's team to forfeit 
an undefeated season. Board members filed a formal complaint Thursday, 
asserting that athletic director Stephen Kessler was either grossly 
negligent or had deliberately overlooked at least one player's academic 
record. The board also censured the district's superintendent, Robert 
Mann; the high school principal, Daniel Murphy, and the students' 
special education supervisor, Linda Burgess, saying they should have 
uncovered the situation. `` Kessler should have known,'' said Charles 
Harris, a board member. ``The fact that he said he misinterpreted 
the ruling, that was no excuse. There was too much at stake.'' The 
team, the Blue Bishops, forfeited six of its eight winning games last 
month after Kessler reported that he had mistakenly allowed a newly 
classified special education student to play. Then, on Nov. 3, after 
reviewing students' records, the district reported that a second ineligible 
student had been on the field all season, and the team's record was 
changed from 8-0 to 0-8 under a ruling by the New Jersey Interscholastic 
Athletic Association. Kessler has been the target of anger in the 
community and received a death threat Oct. 28. Still, he intends to 
fight for his job, his lawyer, Michael Schottland, said. As a tenured 
employee who has worked in the district for more than 30 years, he 
cannot be dismissed until a formal complaint is filed and hearings 
are held by the state Department of Education. Schottland said his 
client admitted that he misinterpreted rules of the scholastic athletic 
association that require newly classified special education students 
to wait a semester before playing team sports. The youth in question 
was classified in July and began playing in August. Kessler did not 
accept blame for allowing the second boy to play. He needed a special 
waiver because he had completed 25 of the required 27.5 semester credits 
the previous year. Schottland said the special education supervisor, 
Ms. Burgess, had granted permission to the student. She would not 
comment on Friday. Schottland said that the board was using Kessler 
as a scapegoat and that it should have instead appealed the athletic 
association's ruling on the ground that it set educational policy, 
which only the State Department of Education can do.
