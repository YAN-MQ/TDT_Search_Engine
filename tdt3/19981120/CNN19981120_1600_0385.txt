The FBI's new high-tech operations center is up and running in Washington. 
Officials say the strategic information and operations center, or 
sioc, gives the bureau the ability to handle as many as five crises 
at once. The $20 million facility is located on the fifth floor of 
the FBI's headquarters in Washington. Attorney general Janet Reno 
says the facility will play a vital role in the fight against terrorism. 
I have watched as people looked at the rubble and the tragedy of Oklahoma 
City and wondered how we could pull from that rubble and that tragedy 
facts that could be presented in a court of law that could produce 
a conviction pursuant to the rule of law. It did not seem possible. 
The federal bureau of investigation made it so. Coincidentally, the 
FBI is celebrating its 90th anniversary today.
