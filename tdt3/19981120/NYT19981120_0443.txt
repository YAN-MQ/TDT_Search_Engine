The New York Times said in an editorial for Saturday, Nov. 21: After 
32 years of dictatorship under President Suharto, Indonesians are 
understandably eager for free elections. President B.J. Habibie must 
move faster in providing them and avoid the Suharto-style repression 
he has flirted with in recent weeks. Habibie, who was Suharto's protege, 
took over when his mentor was forced from power last May. He has made 
some limited steps toward democracy. But instead of seeking legitimacy 
through early elections, Habibie has stretched out what should have 
been a brief transition. This month, students returned to the streets 
of Jakarta for the largest demonstrations since the fall of Suharto. 
They were protesting the slow pace of Habibie's transition timetable, 
his anemic efforts to recover money stolen by the Suharto family and 
the military's continued role in government. Unlike last May, the 
protests were not joined by the middle class. But they did draw support 
from the far more numerous, and desperate, urban poor. Security forces 
overreacted, killing several students. Habibie seized on the violent 
crackdown as a pretext for interrogating several opposition political 
figures. Habibie is pushing ahead with plans that would defer selection 
of the next president until the end of 1999. Even then, the choice 
would not be made by Indonesia's voters but by a partially elected 
assembly likely to include large numbers of military officers and 
government appointees. It will lack the legitimacy to carry out painful 
economic reforms or cope with popular protests. Next week, Indonesia's 
Parliament will consider the army's future role in politics. Habibie 
and his political allies want the army to retain its hand in selecting 
presidents for 5 to 10 more years. That kind of military influence 
has no place in a democratic Indonesia. A quicker, cleaner transition 
to full civilian democracy is needed, and Washington should not be 
shy about saying so.
