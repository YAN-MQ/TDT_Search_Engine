Not even solid sales in the United States and a weak yen that made 
those sales more valuable could save Toyota Motor Corp., Japan's largest 
car manufacturer and one of its most financially sound companies, 
from a decline in profits. Expenses largely unrelated to Toyota's 
core auto business chipped away at the company's consolidated earnings, 
which fell 20 percent, to 192.6 billion yen, or $1.6 billion at current 
exchange rates, in the six months that ended Sept. 30. Of Japan's 
top five car manufacturers, only Honda Motor Co., which derives three-quarters 
of its sales outside Japan, and Mazda Motor Corp. posted profit increases 
in the same period. Sales increased 11.4 percent, spurred by gains 
in North America and Europe, and income on an operating level crept 
up 1.2 percent. Toyota's operating profits on a stand-alone basis 
inched forward, albeit by a scant 0.1 percent, as cost-cutting measures 
and higher exports offset a 14.4 percent decline in its domestic car 
sales. But higher depreciation costs due to plant expansion in the 
United States and Canada, and other non-auto-related expenses, such 
as a paper loss on the company's securities portfolio and losses on 
stakes it holds in 62 companies on a nonconsolidated basis, led to 
a drop in bottom-line profits.
