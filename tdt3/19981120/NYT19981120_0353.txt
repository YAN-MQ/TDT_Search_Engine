The second-richest woman in America is now apparently the second-richest 
Texan. Alice Walton, the only daughter (she has three brothers) of 
the late Sam Walton, has acquired a Texas driver's license and 3,200 
acres in the hill country near Mineral Wells, west of Dallas. The 
compound includes a 4,400-square-foot main house, four other houses, 
a pool and outbuildings. It is a fit spread for Ms. Walton, a lifelong 
equestrian who also trains and breeds work horses for ranchers. It 
is also a refuge, after a decade of fitful efforts in her native Arkansas 
to become a regional leader in money management, economic development 
and investment banking. Last month, she resigned as chief executive 
of Llama Co., her investment firm, while remaining chairman and majority 
shareholder. She opened Llama in Fayetteville in 1988 with $25 million 
of her own capital. Hard feelings linger, according to Arkansas business 
leaders who request anonymity for fear of offending the Walton family. 
``There's the sense around here that she feels mistreated, so she's 
packing up and moving to Texas,'' one senior executive sighed. In 
a phone interview, Ms. Walton did not explain her decision, but said 
of her new address: ``I feel so totally at home. I love it.'' A watercolorist 
who collects early American art, she rhapsodized over the paint that 
was being applied to her new home that day. ``Yellow-gold, Southwestern, 
soft, soft, soft,'' she said. For all her artistic ardor, though, 
she has no fashion pretensions. Asked if she had a favorite designer, 
she laughed. ``I'm a cowgirl,'' she said. ``I like jeans and boots.'' 
But she left no doubt she would stay in charge at Llama. As she described 
her vision for the firm, she peppered her comments with digs at Wall 
Street. ``What I want are a group of people who have financial expertise 
but don't think like an investment banker, who have operating knowledge, 
who understand our clients,'' said Ms. Walton, 49. ``Most investment 
banks aren't built that way. They're built around 28-year-old guys 
who don't have the sense God gave a goose.'' It's not as if Ms. Walton 
has to work for a living. Her stake in Wal-Mart is worth an estimated 
$11 billion, placing her second in wealth to her mother, Helen, among 
women and probably second, in Texas, to Michael Dell, the founder 
of Dell Computer, who is worth about $13 billion. Ms. Walton may miss 
her thousand acres of Ozark lakefront near the headquarters of the 
Wal-Mart chain, which was founded by her father. But she will also 
leave behind the state's income tax. (Texas has none.) Lynn DeVault, 
her chosen successor as Llama's chief, said that annual earnings are 
``in the millions'' and that Llama has $500 million in investments 
and loans and $300 million under management. Llama has had successes, 
financing a bond issue for a northwest Arkansas airport near Wal-Mart's 
home _ President Clinton, dedicating the airport this month, singled 
out Ms. Walton for praise _ and helping to finance an employee buyout 
that kept Hathaway Shirt Co. of Maine alive. Last month, Llama acquired 
Boston Capital Mortgage, since renamed Llama Capital Mortgage. Llama's 
real estate and corporate finance branches, Ms. DeVault said, had 
record returns in 1997. But in Arkansas, Llama is more often noted 
for its setbacks. In February, it sold a sports management division, 
and three months later withdrew as underwriter for two state bond 
issues. ``No one has ever understood what Llama was trying to do,'' 
said an investment banker in Little Rock. ``It's always been whatever 
was the idea of the week.'' Ms. Walton's company has also suffered 
from executive turnover. Don Clanton, a former Llama executive, calls 
her a poor manager. ``She becomes impatient,'' he said. But she is 
knowledgeable, he added: ``She gets to the bottom line about as fast 
as anyone I've seen.'' Ms. DeVault says any turnover resulted from 
growth. As for Ms. Walton's management skills, the ranch-horse enterprise, 
Ms. DeVault added, is ``very much a business.'' ``She's not a kid 
with a pony in the back yard,'' Ms. DeVault said. Ms. Walton traveled 
to her new backyard along a sometimes rough course. Her father, in 
his autobiography, described her as ``volatile.'' She initially worked 
as a Wal-Mart buyer and later became a broker at E.F. Hutton's New 
Orleans office. There, she ran afoul of the Securities and Exchange 
Commission over options trading and in 1979 accepted a six-month suspension 
without acknowledging any improprieties. She soon returned to Arkansas. 
She has also endured two divorces and more than 30 surgeries to repair 
a leg crushed when the car she was driving overturned in Mexico in 
1983. Six years later, she was held blameless when an Arkansas woman 
stepped into the path of her Porsche and died. Then, last January, 
her sport utility vehicle crashed near her Arkansas home. She was 
charged with drunken driving and resisting arrest. ``You know who 
I am, don't you? You know my last name?'' an officer quoted Ms. Walton 
as saying. She said she had no memories of the incident, because of 
a concussion. Despite hiring two prominent lawyers and a public relations 
firm, she was convicted, fined $925, sentenced to 28 hours of community 
service and ordered to undergo counseling. Ms. DeVault said Ms. Walton's 
move to Texas was not an effort to escape her past. In any case, Ms. 
Walton will not be leaving the Walton empire too far behind. There 
in Mineral Wells is Wal-Mart Store No. 804.
