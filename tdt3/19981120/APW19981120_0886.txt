Siding with European central bankers, U.S. Federal Reserve Chairman 
Alan Greenspan said Friday that the success of Europe's single currency, 
the euro, depends on the credibility of the new central bank that 
will watch over it. Pointing to the German mark, Greenspan said its 
strength was based on the reputation of Germany's central bank, the 
Bundesbank. ``If the European Central Bank fails to inherit the reputation'' 
of the Bundesbank, then the euro could be ``undercut,'' Greenspan 
said via a video link from Washington to a banking conference in Frankfurt. 
But he also said ``I have considerable confidence that the advent 
of the euro will be a successful one.'' Turning to foreign exchange 
rates, Greenspan called it an ``illusion'' to think target zones for 
the world's major currencies could succeed. ``One might argue it's 
a desirable goal, but not credible or feasible,'' Greenspan said. 
The idea is favored by Oskar Lafontaine, the finance minister in Germany's 
new center-left government, who views it as a way to avoid harmful 
swings in financial markets. Greenspan said the money that central 
banks would need to defend the foreign exchange target, coupled with 
other technical problems, make such a program ``extraordinarily difficult 
to manage.'' He also said interest rates would be a difficult way 
to manage target zones. If Europe were in a recession, for example, 
and its currency was at the lower end of the band, it wouldn't want 
to raise interest rates to defend the currency. The Bundesbank, which 
maintains it must remain free of political interference, has ignored 
recent calls by Lafontaine for lower interest rates in the euro zone 
to promote economic growth. On Thursday the Bundesbank left its key 
interest rates unchanged, just two days after the Federal Reserve 
trimmed its rates for a third time in recent weeks, Interest rates 
across much of Europe are already easing as central banks bring their 
rates in line with the low levels in Germany and France, Bundesbank 
president Hans Tietmeyer told the conference. ``There is an agreement 
it should be done at a lower level _ that is all going on _ it's moving 
in the right direction,'' Tietmeyer said in a question-and-answer 
session following a speech. Tietmeyer added that a convergence of 
interest rates in coming weeks is essential as the euro will start 
with a single money market rate on Jan. 1.
