When leaders of major religious organizations believe their flocks 
to be facing a matter of overarching importance, they may decide guidance 
is best given through a formal pastoral statement, a nuanced and reflective 
document sent to all congregations under their care. Such statements 
are not a simple matter, often involving months of deliberation before 
they are released. At least two such messages were published this 
week, one by the nation's Roman Catholic bishops, the other by the 
president of a Protestant denomination. Each, in its own quite separate 
way, addressed the question of how Christians should act in the larger 
society. The National Conference of Catholic Bishops issued a document 
at its semiannual meeting in Washington. News from the four-day gathering 
was dominated by the bishops' statement that they should try to persuade 
politicians to oppose abortion, and by the election of Bishop Wilton 
Gregory of Bellevue, Ill., as the conference's vice president, making 
him the first African-American prelate to hold one of the organization's 
top two offices. But the bishops also voted unanimously to send out 
a plain-spoken, ``pastoral reflection'' on the values Catholics ought 
to bring to the workaday world. ``How do we connect worship on Sunday 
to work on Monday?'' asks the document, ``Everyday Christianity: To 
Hunger and Thirst for Justice,'' which says the church's social mission 
is ultimately up to the people in the pews. It will be sent to all 
19,000 parishes in the United States. With references to statements 
by Pope John Paul II and to some of the bishops' pastoral letters 
of earlier years, the document addresses Catholics as members of families, 
workers, managers and citizens. Of business owners and investors, 
it asks: ``Decisions about the use of capital have moral implications: 
Are they creating and preserving quality jobs at living wages? Are 
they building up community through the goods and services they provide?'' 
And to the faithful as consumers, it states: ``When we purchase goods 
and services, we can choose to support companies that defend human 
life, treat workers fairly, protect creation and respect other basic 
moral values at home and abroad. We can also make conscious efforts 
to consume less.'' ``Our society urgently needs the everyday witness 
of Christians who take the social demands of our faith seriously,'' 
the document states in its conclusion. On Tuesday, as the bishops 
approved their message, the United Church of Christ finished mailing 
copies of a pastoral letter from its president, the Rev. Paul Sherry, 
to the more than 6,000 congregations in the 1.4 million-member denomination, 
which has its headquarters in Cleveland. Sherry's letter, ``Now, No 
Condemnation,'' defends the rights of gay men and lesbians in the 
church and in society. He began it, Sherry wrote, months ago as a 
response to well-publicized statements by prominent politicians and 
religious bodies condemning homosexual activity. The letter, he said, 
is ``to remind all of us that the church is to be a place where all 
are welcomed, where the gifts of all are recognized and received, 
and where the rights of all are defended and promoted.'' While many 
Protestant bodies have moved to prohibit or at least discourage the 
ordination of openly gay men and lesbians as members of the clergy, 
the United Church of Christ is unusual in leaving the matter to its 
conferences, as its regional associations are called. Some have ordained 
openly gay men and lesbians as ministers. In a cover statement addressed 
to clergy members, Sherry wrote that the murder of Matthew Shepard, 
a gay college student, in Wyoming last month ``underscores the critical 
importance of this reflection and the need for our voice to be heard.'' 
Sherry asked that the letter be read from the denomination's pulpits. 
Whether that happens is up to each congregation, which are autonomous 
under the church's system. ``It's not an edict,'' said Barb Powell, 
a church spokeswoman. ``It's a letter.'' ``He wants people to talk 
about it,'' Ms. Powell said.
