New England is generally viewed as a bastion of civility, a place 
where Frostian musings about good fences making good neighbors do 
not immediately elicit cries to shut up. But in recent days, trash 
talking has replaced poetry recitals in the meadows and mill towns 
to the east. Boston is calling Hartford, the proud Connecticut city 
built on insurance policies against bathtub falls and death, a ghost 
town for yahoos. Hartford counters by dismissing Boston, the noble 
Massachusetts metropolis that sees tragedy of Greek proportion in 
every Red Sox defeat, as a grimy, creaking haven for sore losers. 
Only Providence, the Rhode Island home to liberty and la Cosa Nostra, 
demonstrates having learned a lesson from the American Revolution. 
It democratically thumbs its nose at everyone. At the root of all 
the discontent, waged in newspaper columns and on radio airwaves, 
is this week's announcement by Robert Kraft that he will move his 
National Football League team, the New England Patriots, from Foxboro, 
Mass., to Hartford in time for the 2001 season. On one level, the 
issue merely reflects a series of business decisions: Massachusetts 
refused to placate the wealthy owner of a sports franchise with the 
subsidies that he sought, and so he went to a place where he felt 
more wanted, to a city looking to jump-start its revitalization. On 
another level, it speaks to the pull of regional identity, love for 
one's sports idols and contempt for one's neighbors. Dan Shaughnessy, 
a sports writer for The Boston Globe, greeted the prospect of losing 
the Patriots with a front-page polemic on Thursday against Kraft's 
choice of Hartford, whose charms apparently are lost on him. He called 
the city a ``yahoo sports town'' and ``America's file cabinet,'' a 
place where ``poor souls'' wander ``dead streets.'' Vincent ``Buddy'' 
Cianci, the mayor of Providence, whose city also wooed the Patriots, 
asked: ``Have the rules changed? Has Hartford become the celebrated 
city of the Northeast? ``You can marry an ugly woman for enough money, 
I guess.'' On Friday, Jim Shea of The Hartford Courant raised his 
own pen in defense, smearing Boston with ink. ``The best thing about 
Boston is Cape Cod,'' he said. ``Boston has the charm of a storm sewer.'' 
As for the common Boston lament that its residents would rather watch 
the ice sport of curling than travel to Hartford for a Patriots game, 
Shea wondered: If it weren't for Boston fans, who would urinate in 
the streets, pick fights and ``wander around stinking drunk''? The 
exchanges are nasty enough to make Boston's residents forget how to 
spell ``Yastrzemski'' and make Hartford's denizens forget that the 
big G. Fox department store on Main Street is still vacant. In the 
end, though, the dispute seems driven more by sports writers and commentators 
than by deep-seated resentment. First, the spokeswomen for the mayor's 
offices of Boston and Hartford said they were rarely asked about rivalry 
between the cities. More often, they say, their squabbles are with 
Providence and its irrepressible mayor, Cianci. Second, the Patriots 
play in Foxboro, which is 30 miles from Boston, a city the team abandoned 
with such ill feeling years earlier that it changed its name from 
the Boston Patriots to the New England Patriots. Among certain Yankees, 
once a Benedict Arnold, always a Benedict Arnold. Jacque Goddard, 
the spokeswoman for Boston's mayor, Thomas Menino, said, ``Many people 
in the city of Boston feel that the team has not had loyalty to the 
city, that it has purposely tried to shed its Boston image by moving 
elsewhere in Massachusetts and changing the name of the team.'' Lastly, 
everyone agrees Hartford could use a pat on its hunched back. Boston 
has the Red Sox and the Bruins. Hartford, which also has economic 
woes, recently saw its only professional sports franchise, the Whalers 
hockey team, flee to North Carolina. ``It would be nice if people 
would see what we're all about before calling us yahoos,'' said Nilda 
Torres, the executive assistant to Hartford's mayor, Michael Peters. 
``All we keep hearing is `Did you hear that Boston's radio stations 
are taking more swipes at us?' I mean, it's not our fault.''
