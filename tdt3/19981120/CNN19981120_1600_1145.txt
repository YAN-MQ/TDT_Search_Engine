That's "Dollars & Sense." Back to you, Denise. Thank you, Beverly. 
Next on "Headline Sports," the latest people to play let's make a 
deal in major league baseball. You spend your days-- and probably 
more evenings than you'd care to admit-- caught up in things like 
trying to align your company's strategies... with process and technology... 
and managing risks to your global operations. At Arthur Andersen, 
we've got people with knowledge and experience... who can help you 
make those kinds of decisions. And while that may not exactly get 
you home early, it just might free you up enough... to take care of 
something that's really important. If you looked into your local carrier's 
phone lines what time period would they place your company in? Why 
live in the past... when local's future is right through here? On-net. 
Where local, national and global all flow over one network, owned 
by one company. Oh, and did I mention... it'll save you money? On-net. 
From MCI Worldcom.
