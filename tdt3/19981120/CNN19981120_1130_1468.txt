Conservationists in Sweden were pleased when wolf packs returned to 
their country. But not everyone is happy. Gary Strieker reports. In 
the mountains of central and northern Sweden, this is domestic livestock 
for the native sami people. The sami have herded reindeer since antiquity, 
facing losses from predators like the lynx and the bear, and from 
an old enemy that was once wiped out, and has now come back -- the 
wolf. They have never been accepted in the reindeer grazing area. 
We have accepted a number of the other predators, but not wolves. 
The return of the wolf started here about 20 years ago when a Pair 
of wolves was spotted in northern Sweden, apparently coming from finland. 
Experts say there are now six breeding packs of wolves in Sweden and 
Norway 50 to 70 wolves so far protected by law, and thriving on abundant 
moose and other wild prey, good news for those who support wolves. 
They're increasing at the rate you would expect them to do, and hopefully 
they will survive here in Sweden. But the samis say wolves are killing 
far too many reindeer and that the law bars them from protecting their 
animals. In no way we're allowed to kill a wolf. And we're not allowed 
to disturb them either. That's the law in Sweden today. The conflicts 
between wolves and the sami reindeer herders are just part of a growing 
problem here. Most wolves in Sweden are found south of the reindeer 
areas, where they encounter people far different from the sami. Hunters 
report increasing attacks by wolves on their dogs. He says some people 
are now afraid to go into the forest with their dogs because of the 
wolves. It's very hard. I want to cry. This woman had two dogs, both 
of them killed by wolves. Now I know it might happen again, and I 
don't want it to happen. I don't, I don't, I don't. Others report 
encounters with bold, apparently aggressive wolves and say something 
has to be done. We must begin to Hunt them, so they be afraid of people. 
Conservationists say swedes will soon have to decide how many wolves 
they will tolerate here and whether to allow hunting of wolves to 
control them. Gary Strieker, CNN, in central Sweden.
