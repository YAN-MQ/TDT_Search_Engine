The traffic safety department in the city of Vladivostok in Russia's 
Far East has charged the U.S. consul general with injuring a pedestrian 
in a car accident, a news report said Friday. The U.S. Embassy in 
Moscow confirmed that Consul General Douglas Kent was in a car accident 
Oct. 27. Embassy spokesman Michael Hurley had no other details about 
the case Friday and said the consulate was handling it. No one was 
available for comment at the consulate in Vladivostok, eight time 
zones and 6,400 kilometers (4,000 miles) east of Moscow. The Interfax 
news agency quoted traffic department chief Viktor Chaika as saying 
Kent caused a three-car accident in which a 23-year-old pedestrian 
suffered a serious spinal injury. The traffic department in Vladivostok 
charged him with violating traffic safety and causing injury to a 
pedestrian. While Kent is subject to Russian laws, if convicted he 
is likely to be expelled instead of sentenced, because of his diplomatic 
immunity, Chaika said. Kent arrived in Vladivostok a few months ago, 
Hurley said.
