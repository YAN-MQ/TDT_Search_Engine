If Bill Gates, the chairman of Microsoft, is serving as an effective 
witness for his company at the government's antitrust trial, it is 
hard to find anyone other than Microsoft employees who hold that view. 
On Thursday, Thomas Penfield Jackson, the U.S. district judge who 
is judge and jury in the case, told lawyers for both sides that ``it's 
evident to every spectator that for whatever reasons, in many respects 
Mr. Gates has not been particularly responsive to his deposition interrogation.'' 
Speaking to Microsoft's lawyers at a closed hearing, Jackson noted 
that even ``everyone at your table has reflected skepticism as the 
testimony is presented.'' A transcript of the discussion was made 
public late that night. Government lawyers interviewed Gates for 20 
hours in August, and they have been playing parts of this deposition 
in court over the last three weeks. In the tapes, Gates appears to 
recall little if anything about the subjects in dispute at the trial. 
He pauses for 30 seconds or longer before answering many questions 
and argues with the government about the meaning of even the most 
common words, like ``compete,'' ``ask'' and ``market share.'' Experienced 
trial lawyers who are not involved in this case say witnesses like 
Gates can harm a company's case. ``Where a case goes to trial, the 
credibility of a witness can be strongly and successfully attacked 
if he couldn't remember significant events at his deposition that 
any reasonable person would have remembered,'' said Gary Naftalis, 
a partner in the firm Kramer, Levin, Naftalis &AMP; Frankel in New 
York. Microsoft spokesmen contend that Gates testified just as witnesses 
should in adversarial circumstances. The company even hired Joseph 
diGenova, a former U.S. attorney, as a legal consultant and spokesman. 
And after the last playing of a Gates tape segment, diGenova told 
reporters that the Gates performance was typical. Microsoft had struggled 
mightily to prevent the playing of the tape. Thursday's closed conference 
with Jackson came as a result of a request by Microsoft's lead lawyer, 
John Warden, that the government play the whole tape at once, not 
just the pieces. Jackson rejected the request, saying: ``If anything, 
I think the problem is with your witness, not the way in which his 
testimony is being presented.''
