And the first section of the long planned international space station 
has been successfully placed in orbit after lift off from the Russian 
launch site in Kazakstan. The Russian space station module, Zadia, 
was launched atop a Russian booster rocket early today. Ten minutes 
later, ground control announced the capsule had separated from the 
rocket and entered orbit. The American space shuttle Endeavor will 
rendezvous with Zadia in two weeks to deliver a connecting module.
