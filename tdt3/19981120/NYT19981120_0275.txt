Prime Minister Bertie Ahern of the Irish Republic and David Trimble, 
the first minister of the new Northern Ireland Assembly, said Friday 
that they had made significant progress toward setting up a council 
that would give Roman Catholic Ireland more influence in the predominantly 
Protestant British province of Northern Ireland. Under the peace agreement 
approved in the spring to end the sectarian warfare in the North, 
the cross-border council would have northern and southern officials 
cooperating on issues like tourism, agriculture and development. Under 
the accord the British government in London is to yield such powers 
next year. The council was a major concession to northern Catholics, 
and the political wing of the Irish Republican Army. Sinn Fein, vigorously 
supported it. After meeting for an hour here Ahern and Trimble indicated 
that they had made no progress on the issue that is blocking the work 
of the new Assembly, the peace accord, disarming the IRA. Trimble, 
the Protestant leader of the Ulster Unionist Party, said, ``It won't 
work unless it all works,'' referring to the accord and the disarmament 
dispute. Ahern said he hoped a compromise could be achieved in weeks. 
The IRA. refuses to disarm. Protestant officials, led by Trimble, 
want disarmament to start before Sinn Fein is permitted to take part 
fully in the work of the Assembly. Trimble is refusing to allow Sinn 
Fein to have Cabinet posts in the new Assembly's provisional government 
or places on the North-South council until the IRA. begins to disarm. 
The two leaders said they hoped that there would be progress on the 
issue before Prime Minister Tony Blair of Britain addresses the Irish 
Parliament here next week. He will be the first British prime minister 
to do so since southern Ireland became independent in 1922 In Omagh, 
Northern Ireland, a senior police official of the Royal Ulster Constabulary 
appealed for informers' tips to help catch the terrorists of an Irish 
Republican Army splinter group called the Real IRA, who detonated 
a bomb on Aug. 15 that killed 29 people there. The official said that 
more than 40 people had been questioned, but that no breakthrough 
was imminent. The official, Detective Chief Superintendent Eric Anderson, 
his voice cracking with emotion in an interview on Irish national 
radio, said: ``It has been a devastating experience. I want you to 
listen. I want you to go in your room, perhaps before you say your 
prayers, and think of any piece of information whatsoever.'' To reassure 
people with Republican paramilitary groups, he added: ``You will not 
be followed. You will not be badgered, not be harassed.'' In the history 
of Irish rebellion against British rule, informers have been routinely 
killed by Catholic terrorists.
