The first piece of the international space station is finally in orbit. 
The 24-ton section rocketed into space today after being delayed for 
a Year. The 41-foot-long component will provide power and communications 
for the international space station, which is scheduled to be completed 
in 2004. It will take 45 more flights to put 100 more pieces into 
orbit. 16 nations are sharing the cost of the $30 billion project.
