Still ahead, the gruesome death of a famous film director, North Dakota, 
deadly debris on the nation's highways. Every day when I go out there 
and put the kids in the car, it's scary. High impact. When a tire 
or piece of metal suddenly becomes a lethal weapon. And liftoff. The 
first step into a new age of manned space exploration. Hi, pumpkin. 
It's late. You should be asleep. Mommy said that I could stay up until 
you got home. - oh. - What are you eating? - Cheerios. - For dinner? 
They taste just as good at night. And remember, I told you they were 
good for my cholesterol. Oh, yeah. An important new study shows... 
that three cups of cheerios whole grain oats a day, added to a low 
fat diet, can help push your cholesterol down. Do you know what else 
is good for my heart? - uh-uh. - a hug from you. The one and only 
cheerios Max is a mighty dog. That's why he gets new mighty dog carved 
beef in gravy. Tender slices in savory gravy... to give Max all the 
energy he needs. New mighty dog carved beef and carved beef with pasta. 
Mighty dog... from friskies.
