Britain is exploring the possibility of restoring military ties with 
its former colony of Nigeria in the wake of improved relations between 
the two countries, a senior British military officer said Friday. 
Maj. Gen. Christopher Drewry, Britain's assistant chief of defense 
staff, met with his counterpart, Air Vice-Marshal Al-Amin Daggash, 
on Thursday to discuss bilateral ties. Drewry is in Nigeria to ``put 
in place the necessary machinery for the resumption of military links,'' 
he said. Military ties between Britain and Nigeria were suspended 
by London as part of a series of sanctions aimed at punishing former 
dictator Gen. Sani Abacha. Abacha died in June and was replaced by 
Gen. Abdulsalami Abubakar, who has been working toward restoring Nigeria's 
battered foreign relations. He also plans to hand power over to a 
civilian government next year. British Commonwealth states, European 
Union members and the United States all imposed trade and economic 
sanctions on Nigeria following the 1995 execution of environmental 
activist and author Ken Saro-Wiwa and eight other associates. Although 
Britain is exploring the possibility of restoring military relations 
with Nigeria, Drewry said final approval would only come after democratic 
reforms had been fully adopted in the West African country. Nigeria's 
military is one of most advanced in Sub-Saharan Africa and has played 
a leading and dominant role in a regional peacekeeping force known 
as ECOMOG. Nigerian troops fighting under the ECOMOG banner toppled 
a military junta in Sierra Leone earlier this year and cleared the 
way for that country's elected president to be reinstated. Drewry 
commended Nigeria's military command for its participation in ECOMOG 
operations in Sierra Leone, Liberia and in the near future in Guinea-Bissau.
