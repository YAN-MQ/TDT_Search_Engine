In Arizona, the case of the insurance company and the hit list. Here's 
the plot as they put it to the jury. An insurance company has financial 
troubles and so it sets out to get rid of some policy holders. The 
expensive ones, with disability claims. ABC's Brian Rooney reports 
from Phoenix. Ron diamond was a practicing dentist until he developed 
carpal tunnel syndrome in his wrists, which left him unable to use 
his instruments. So he filed for disability benefits with general 
American insurance and trained for a new profession, repairing medical 
electronics. But eventually, general American cut him off saying he 
was no longer eligible. I trusted totally in my local agent. And the 
insurance company. And the insurance company, yes. Three years later, 
a lawyer told diamond his name had appeared on a secret lt comp by 
L, ow dy payments of $100,000 or more. The only criteria for being 
a member of this particular club was that your claim represented too 
significant a liability to the company. The lawyers argued that the 
company's own documents show that to make up for losses in disability 
insuranc general American targeted the 58 on thatlist hem out caply 
intimidate, and cut them off. One memo says about a client "if he 
doesn't accept a buyout, we should NY further benets." A memo from 
one executive talks about secrecy anstroyi memos, "if litigation would 
ever develop." William wizinsky of Michigan, who suffered lifelong 
back and eye injuries in a car accident, was told he's no longer disabled. 
There's people out there that got conned out of their money and they 
don't even know about it. Trust us, we'll protect you. And when people 
do trust, it's much easier to betray them. The jury came back with 
a stunning decision in favor of Dr. diamond, $1 million in damages 
and $58 million more to punish general american. It will be years 
before diamond sees a penny of it. General American, which declined 
an interview, is appealing. Brian Rooney, ABC News, Phoenix.
