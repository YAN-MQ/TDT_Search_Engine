This week 22 nations are considering the fate of the Atlantic tuna 
and swordfish. The International Commission For The Conservation of 
Atlantic Tuna, meeting in Santiago Decompostello, Spain, is addressing 
over-fishing and the means restore depleted tuna and swordfish. Blue 
fin tuna has declined 90 percent since 1975. Swordfish is down by 
70 percent since the mid 1960s. Ken Hinman is the President of the 
National Coalition for Marine Conservation, an organization dedicated 
the protection of ocean fish. He says the United States has complied 
with internationally agreed on quotas and expects the same from other 
members of the Tuna Protection Commission. The United States is going 
in with a very strong statement. And position that they expect that 
countries will be abiding by the rules or else they will push very 
strongly for these penalties and even in the most severe style, which 
is the trade sanctions to be imposed as punishment. Ken Hinman says 
compliance with already signed agreements is only one issue. Another, 
he says is more effective quotas. A dead swordfish is a dead swordfish 
and when it adds up to excessive mortality, it is going to impede 
the recovery of these fish. So, we also asking and we want the U.S. 
to come back with an agreement that countries will count their dead 
discards against their quotas. Ken Hinman with the National Coalition 
for Marine Conservation also hopes that the U.S. will push beyond 
setting the new quotas for the Blue Fin Tuna, which expire this year, 
to the creation of an effective restoration program for the species.
