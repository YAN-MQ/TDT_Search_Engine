While U.S. state governments have unanimously agreed to that $206 
billion tobacco deal, which was negotiated by State Attorneys General. 
The money, which will be paid by the tobacco companies, will help 
cover the costs of treating smoking related illnesses. The deal also 
restricts certain cigarette marketing activities such as the use of 
T shirts, caps, and other clothing to promote cigarette brands. Unlike 
a previous agreement, this one does not require approval by congress.
