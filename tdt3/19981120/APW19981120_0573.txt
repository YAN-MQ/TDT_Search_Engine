Police burst into a dissident's home Friday in eastern China, breaking 
up a political meeting and taking him and three other activists away, 
a human rights group said. The police in the city of Hangzhou also 
searched Wu Yilong's home and seized a fax machine, an address book 
and documents, the Information Center of Human Rights and Democratic 
Movement in China said. Wu and the three others had met to discuss 
affairs related to a political party set up by dissidents in June 
to challenge the ruling Communist Party, the Hong Kong-based group 
reported. Chinese authorities have refused dissidents' requests to 
register the China Democracy Party, as required by law, and detained 
and questioned dozens of its supporters, mostly for short periods 
of time. Apart from Wu, the police detained Wang Rongqing, also from 
Hangzhou, and Yao Zhenxian and Li Guotao, who arrived in Hangzhou 
on Friday morning from Shanghai, about 180 kilometers (110 miles) 
to the northeast, the Information Center said. It said the four dissidents' 
whereabouts were unknown.
