Juventus and Italian national team striker Alessandro Del Piero will 
undergo surgery to repair a torn left knee ligament at the Steadman 
Hawkins Clinic in the United States, his agent announced Friday. The 
operation will be performed early next week in Vail, Colorado, by 
Dr. Richard Steadman, a surgeon who has treated major knee injuries 
of several professional athletes, including Serie A notables Nicola 
Berti and Maurizio Ganz. The 24-year-old Del Piero was injured in 
a league game against Udinese two weeks ago. Team doctors said he's 
expected to be sidelined for the remainder of the Italian season, 
which concludes in May. One of the most popular Italian players and 
the European Champions Cup leading scorer last season, Del Piero said 
in a recent interview that he was prepared to face a long rehabilitation 
``and be back to action, stronger than before, next season.'' Del 
Piero was scheduled to fly to Denver, via Chicago, Saturday morning 
along with his agent Claudio Pasqualin and Juventus doctor Riccardo 
Agricola. Steadman and his clinic are world renown for its specialty 
in sports-related injuries, having treated former German national 
team captain Lothar Matthaeus, five-time overall Alpine World Cup 
champion Marc Girardelli, four-time Australian Open champion Monica 
Seles, two-time women's World Cup downhill champion Picabo Street 
and numerous prominent American baseball, basketball and gridiron 
football players.
