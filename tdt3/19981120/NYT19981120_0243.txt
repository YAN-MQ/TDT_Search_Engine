Last year, Angela Voulangas found the mink cape she had inherited 
from her grandmother years ago. Actually, it was more of a capelet, 
and Ms. Voulangas, a 33-year-old graphic designer, had no idea what 
to do with it. ``Where am I going to wear a capelet?'' she asked. 
The 40-year-old mink seemed ``too incongruous with my life,'' she 
added. And yet, it also seemed like ``exciting raw material.'' She 
decided to dye it blue and burgundy, and cut it up into two collars 
and a bag. That way, she said, ``I don't feel I went out and clubbed 
a baby seal.'' Park Avenue matrons once lined raincoats with their 
favorite minks to avoid paint-throwing protesters. Now that the anti-fur 
frenzy has died down a bit, furry pelts are coming out of the closet. 
Even young eco-sensitive people are finding ways of rationalizing 
this indulgence. Hand-me-downs are OK; so is anything found at a flea 
market or a vintage store, or any fur recycled into bite-size pieces 
of trim, collar and other accessories. Dyeing the fur a color not 
found in nature helps. Emily Dougherty, 25, a beauty editor at Harper's 
Bazaar, had two collars made _ purple, and black and blue _ because, 
she said, ``I don't want to know what kind of animal it was.'' Ms. 
Dougherty used the leftover strips to edge the hem of an otherwise 
boring skirt. Some skins, however, don't allow for such willful conscience 
abating. Liz Darst, 33, a freelance television producer, inherited 
her mother's fox stole, the kind with the head still on it that attaches 
jaw to paw, which looked as if it last saw the light of day circa 
1959 at the local country club. ``It was like something from the Flintstones,'' 
she said. ``It's so grotesque, there are eyeballs sticking out. You 
can't salvage that because it's so shameful.'' But she is making her 
mother's mink stole into a scarf. ``It's so soft and pretty,'' she 
said. ``I guess I feel like it's already dead and gone, so it's better 
not to waste it.'' The logic can be as fuzzy as a frazzled beaver 
coat. Jana Ragsdale, 34, a Columbia University administrator, played 
dress-up in her grandmother's furs when she was a child and always 
thought someday she would wear them. But after she inherited the furs, 
she only dared wear them in the woods near her former home in upstate 
New York, and never had the nerve to put them on in public in the 
city. ``I don't want to aggravate people unnecessarily, or have to 
shout out, `This raccoon was killed 80 years ago,''' Ms. Ragsdale 
said. She had the corner dry cleaner stitch together a patchwork quilt 
of pieces from stoles and from her grandfather's raccoon cheerleader 
coat to make a big throw for an unsightly couch. This she can live 
with, she said, because of its sentimental value, and her cats love 
it. Those without inheritances are browsing flea markets and the Salvation 
Army. Alison Houtte, the owner of Hooti Couture, a popular vintage 
store in Brooklyn, used to stock vintage full-length fur coats, but 
few people would even try them on, let alone buy them. About 16 months 
ago, she finally donated the furs to the Salvation Army and began 
to stock only fur accessories and fur-trimmed clothes. As of this 
summer, she said, those items rarely remain in the store for more 
than three days. ``Women see it in the magazines, and it flies out 
of the store,'' said Ms. Houtte, who recently sold a yellow wool coat 
from the 1950's with a dyed yellow fur collar for $75. It resembled 
one that was $5,530 in the Versace store on Fifth Avenue before it 
sold out earlier this fall. While many fur initiates can condone only 
wearing colorful scraps, some are becoming more brazen. Anne Magruder, 
the managing editor of US magazine, found a champagne mink stole at 
the 26th Street flea market, and wore it to a wedding reception in 
New Hampshire. Intact. ``I would never cut it up, it's too beautiful,'' 
she said. ``Anybody can have a fur collar, but there's just something 
so much more luxurious about a stole. It's unexpected. People treat 
you like a movie star when you're wearing one.''
