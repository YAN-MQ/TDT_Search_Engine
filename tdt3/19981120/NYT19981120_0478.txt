In Hampton, Va., and Lubbock, Texas, a calm has been shattered. A 
women's college basketball game canceled. Two communities, one largely 
black and one largely white, are left to wonder whether games are 
all they have in common, whether this latest wound will ever heal. 
The healing process began in earnest Friday when Lubbock Mayor Windy 
Sitton flew to Virginia to apologize to Hampton University's president, 
the head women's basketball coach and the team for events that have 
Lubbock defending itself from being painted as an intolerant city 
with a racist police force. ``We're so sorry,'' Sitton said. From 
Lubbock, Ken Walker, the 48-year-old chief of police, said: ``I hate 
that it happened. I wish it hadn't have happened. It did. We can't 
go back and change it. Do we wish it hadn't happened? Absolutely. 
Especially since the coaches didn't do anything. They were at the 
wrong place at the wrong time.'' For Patricia Bibbs, Hampton's second-year 
head coach, maybe Lubbock is the wrong place at the wrong time. She 
stood by Friday afternoon, listened graciously to Sitton, and accepted 
an outpouring of support. All the while, she must have been wondering 
how would she get back those intangibles that had been snatched away 
by police last Monday in Lubbock. In 15 years as a highly respected 
head coach _ 13 at Grambling, 2 at Hampton _ she has always been known 
for professionalism. Now Bibbs, her husband and an assistant coach 
find themselves reconciling anger, hurt and feelings of revenge. Hampton's 
president, Dr. William Harvey, said at a news conference Friday: ``The 
apology is all well and good, and I believe that she is sincere, but 
you can't undo what's been done. No one should have to endure that 
kind of humiliation.'' The events leading to the news conference began 
Monday when Bibbs took her Pirates team to Lubbock for a game with 
12th-ranked Texas Tech. In a startling series of events, police arrested 
Bibbs; her husband, Ezell Bibbs Jr., 46, and an assistant coach, Vanetta 
Robinson Kelso, 36, after a Lubbock woman reported that the women 
had tried to engage her in a ``pigeon drop'' scam in a Wal-Mart parking 
lot. Speaking by telephone after practice Friday, an emotional Bibbses 
told of the humiliation of being handcuffed and placed in the back 
of a squad car. ``All I could think of was having my team see me like 
this,'' she said. ``I saw one of my assistant coaches come out to 
the parking lot. I just yelled at him: `Please don't let them see 
me like this. Keep them away.' ``How can I get that back? How can 
I get that back?'' Friday, after reviewing security videotapes from 
the Wal-Mart store, police said that the arrests were a case of mistaken 
identity and that no charges would be filed. But legal action is very 
likely _ by Hampton. Officials at the university _ one of the most 
prestigious of the nation's traditionally black schools _ hired lawyer 
Johnnie Cochran to investigate the arrests. In Lubbock, police and 
politicians insisted that race was not a factor in the arrests. Bibbs, 
who was born in Choudrant, La., and raised in Monroe, sees a different 
story. ``Listen, I'm a professional person, my husband's a professional 
person,'' she said. ``You tell someone that you are here to play Texas 
Tech, and they don't want to listen to that. They didn't want to to 
listen, and they didn't listen. I kept telling them: `I'm a friend 
of Marsha Sharp. We're playing her team, you can check it out.' '' 
Sharp, Texas Tech's head coach since 1981 and a longtime friend of 
Bibbs, called the arrest bizarre and said she was devastated by the 
events. But asked whether she thought the arrests were racially motivated, 
Sharp said: ``My gut feeling is that that's not what we're dealing 
with here. I went to her hotel and talked to Coach Bibbs and the players. 
I just told them how sorry I was this happened and that we would do 
anything we could to help.'' Bibbs was selected the Mid-Eastern Athletic 
Conference coach of the year last season, and her team was the MEAC 
co-champion. She arrived from Grambling State, where the women's basketball 
program was placed on two years of probation by the National Collegiate 
Athletic Association in 1997 for violations committed under Bibbs. 
This season Bibbs packed her early schedule with powerhouse teams, 
not simply for the lucrative financial guarantees that smaller programs 
receive to play larger programs in their home arenas, but to get battle 
tested for the coming season. The events of the last week have thrown 
the season into free fall. Even during Friday's news conference with 
the mayor of Lubbock, Bibbs kept flashing back to the parking lot. 
Watching the police going through the van. Watching her assistant 
coach, Kelso, who is five months pregnant, vomiting in the squad car 
after her arrest. Going to the jail and sitting in a dingy cell. ``I 
was so scared,'' she said. ``I've only seen this stuff on television, 
and I've read about it, but it's scary. You don't know what they're 
going to do, and we didn't see any black police officers the whole 
time we were there.'' Through tears, Bibbs said the mayor's apology 
may have removed the nail, but the hole is still there. ``I've been 
in education for 26 years,'' she said. ``I deal with young ladies. 
Everybody who knows me knows that I'm a professional person. I'm a 
lady. I carry myself like that, I acknowledge that all the time. I 
have one of the best-dressed teams. Look what they've done to me. 
How can you get that back? I've got to go into these homes, recruiting 
these athletes, talk to their mothers. How can I get that back?''
