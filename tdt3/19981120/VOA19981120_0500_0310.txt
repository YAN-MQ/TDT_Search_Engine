The head of the International Monetary Fund has assured Central America 
it can count on debt relief in the wake of devastation caused by Hurricane 
Mitch. IMF managing director, Michelle Comdesu, arrived in Honduras 
Thursday for talks on ways to help the Central American countries 
rebuild their shattered economies. Hurricane Mitch, which swept through 
the region earlier this month, left at least 11,000 people dead or 
missing. And caused damage estimated at several billion dollars. The 
hardest hit countries, Honduras, Nicaragua, have a combined debt of 
more than $10 billion. I am David Chadwick, VOA News.
