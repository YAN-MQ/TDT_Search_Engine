This is the time of year when farmers begin planting their fields 
in Zimbabwe. But this year, many say they are uncertain about what 
to do. The government of President Robert McGobi is already announced 
it will seize a large number of farms owned by whites for redistribution 
to black farmers. Charles Bartlett reports from Hurari. President 
McGobi's move to immediately take over 841 white-owned farms has shocked 
farmers and the diplomatic community in Zimbabwe. They feel betrayed 
over an earlier agreement on land reform. The Commercial Farmers' 
Union, CFU, says white farmers have begun receiving notification that 
their land will be seized, but the government has remained silent. 
The takeover contradicts decisions made at an aid donors' conference 
in Harari in September. When it was agreed that land reforms would 
be carried out and carefully planned stages. The CFU was locked in 
a meeting over the issue Thursday, and had no official comment. Except 
to say it would seek an urgent meeting with Mr. McGobi. Diplomats 
representing Western donor countries and agencies were also meeting 
at the initiative of the World Bank to decide on a response to a decision, 
which has thrown their plans into disarray. Diplomats say that Mr. 
McGobi is in danger of alienating the international community, at 
a time when Zimbabwe is facing an unprecedented economic crisis and 
a wave of social unrest. This action over the land comes against a 
background of two national strifes within eight days and sieges in 
the rural areas where victims of the countries liberation war are 
trying to evict some white farmers from their land. Agricultural sources 
say Mr. McGobi's latest move may not result in the immediate seizure 
of farms, but could be designed to keep the issue alive, as he faces 
the biggest challenge to this 18 year rule. He came to power in 1980 
after a seven-year guerrilla war against white minority rule. Which 
was fueled, in large part, by the fact that white colonizers had taken 
most of the country's best agricultural land. Charles Bartlett, for 
VOA News, Hurari.
