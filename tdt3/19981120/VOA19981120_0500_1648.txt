Many of our local FM and medium wave affiliates are taking a bit of 
break just two minutes. Hope you will return to News Now. Well there 
is one thing good about this Friday, Charlene, it is the 20th, last 
Friday was the 13th, but we will not even talk about that. Twentieth 
of November, 1998. On this date in 1951, a For Sale sign was placed 
in front of the last house completed in the development known as Lovettown. 
The privately built town of more than 17,000 homes was begun in 1946 
on Long Island near New York City. It is sometimes considered America's 
first suburb and it has become a symbol of suburbia itself. Now the 
goal of the Abraham Lovett & Sons Construction Company was to provide 
affordable homes for veterans of World War II. The company used assembly 
line methods to hold down the cost of construction of the 19 square 
kilometer site. At the peak of production as many as 30 houses were 
completed every day. Lovettown also had paved streets, utilities and 
neighborhood grocery stores, something was, was kind of unusual for 
that time. Something else on this date in 1866. Hundreds of union 
veterans that was north for those who fought in the American Civil 
War, met in Indianapolis, Indiana at the first convention of the Grand 
Army of the Republic. Now the Grand Army of the Republic was founded 
as a patriotic paternity dedicated to charity and friendship among 
the veterans of the civil war. However, within a few years, the veterans 
group became a powerful influence in American politics. The GAR lobbied 
for veterans' benefits. The organization also pressed the government 
to enact policies to punish the former confederate states that had 
seceded from the Union. The membership of the Grand Army of the Republic 
swelled to more than 400,000 in 1890. The last member died in 1956 
at the age of 109. It is 10 hours, 30 universal time and this is VOA 
News Now. Palestinians refused to take over West Bank areas vacated
