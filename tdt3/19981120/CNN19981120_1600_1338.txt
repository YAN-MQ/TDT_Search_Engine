Nick faldo fired the only bogey-free round of the day as he teamed 
with fellow Brit David Carter to grab the lead after two days of the 
world cup of golf. The American team of John Daly and Scott verplank 
led at one point, but heavy winds in New Zealand played a part in 
their losing 11 strokes in eight holes and falling all the way to 
eighth place. Perhaps the U.S. squad should have been Mark O'Meara 
and hale Irwin. Today, they won the Jack Nicklaus award as the players 
of the year on the pGA and senior tour.
