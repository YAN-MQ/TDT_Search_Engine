Your are listening to VOA News Now. We are broadcasting from Washington. 
I am Charlene Porter along with Paul Westfieling. And the lead story 
in the news at this hour. The Palestinians have refused to take over 
West Bank areas vacated by Israel as Israeli troops begin the first 
stage of their pullout under the Wye River Interim Peace Accord. We 
will have further details on this late breaking story in our next 
newscast about 12 minutes from now. Sports, here is Steve Shy.
