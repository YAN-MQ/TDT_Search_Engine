Russian President Boris Yeltsin has been accused of accepting bribes. 
A parliamentary committee says Mr. Yeltsin was paid off by a powerful 
businessman, Boris Bereznofsky. The committee says Bereznofsky transferred 
shares in Russia's biggest TV station to the president in 1994. Mr. 
Yeltsin denies the charges.
