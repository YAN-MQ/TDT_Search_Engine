In the U.S. National Football League, the New England Patriots have 
reached a tentative deal to move from Foxborough, Massachusetts to 
Hartford, Connecticut. The deal was announced by Connecticut Governor, 
John Roland, and team owner, Robert Craft, on Thursday. Craft explained 
why he felt he had to move the team. I had two objectives to try to 
accomplish. One, was to bring a championship to New England, and the 
other was to find a suitable stadium that would allow our team to 
compete on the long term. The deal still has to be approved by the 
Connecticut Legislature, which will meet in special session within 
the next 45 days.
