Independent counsel Ken Starr was on the defensive Thursday as he 
made his case against President Clinton before the house Judiciary 
committee. During partisan and sometimes heated questioning, Starr 
said the president carried out a scheme to conceal his relationship 
with Monica Lewinsky and engaged in a pattern of obstruction. Skip 
Loescher has more. Independent counsel Ken Starr raises his right 
hand and swears to tell the truth. i do. But Starr tells the house 
Judiciary committee the president didn't tell the truth in the Monica 
Lewinsky case. The president chose deception. Starr contends the president 
also obstructed justice and misused his power. Democrats claim Starr 
and committee republicans are simply obsessed by sex and want to get 
the president. The president is not above the law, Mr. Starr. And 
neither are you. Despite a five-year fishing expedition which has 
yielded nothing more than allegations revolving around a tawdry sex 
scandal, this committee is still trying to bait the hook. Despite 
all the democratic criticism, Starr says the facts show President 
Clinton may have committed impeachable offenses. It would not change 
it. The facts have a real power to them. There is very substantial 
reason to believe that the president did, in fact, not tell the truth 
under oath. Tonight, Starr was questioned by the president's attorney, 
David kendall. And Starr admitted he was not present at any time that 
Monica Lewinsky was questioned. And you've never really exchanged 
words with Ms. Lewinsky, have you? That's correct. She -- the answer 
is yes. I have not had occasion to meet or otherwise to look her in 
the eye myself. Despite Monica Lewinsky's claims to the contrary, 
Starr denies that his office ever asked her to wear a body wire to 
get potentially damaging information from Betty Currie, the president's 
secretary, or Mr. clinton's friend, Vernon Jordan, or from the president 
himself. Skip Loescher, "CNN Headline News," Washington.
