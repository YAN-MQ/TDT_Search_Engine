The UN refugee agency UNHCR, says a regional solution must be found 
to the enormous refugee problem in the former Yugoslavia. The agency 
told officials from the region. Millions of refugees and internally 
displaced people are reluctant to return home because of intimidation 
by other ethnic groups. Lisa Schline in Geneva reports. The UN's top 
refugee official, Sydeko Agata, says that three years after the signing 
of the Dayton Peace Accord in Bosnia, the progress of refugee returns 
remains painfully slow. She says large numbers of mainly Muslin refugees 
are afraid to go back to their original homes, which are now located 
in majority Serb or Croite areas. Ms. Agata says a humanitarian disaster 
has been averted for now in the Serbian province of Kosovo. She says 
the Kosovo cease fire is fragile, but says the speeding deployment 
of 2,000 international monitors in Kosovo will help to build confidence 
among ethnic Albanians. Who have returned to the villages they fled 
during the fighting. Lisa Schline, for VOA News, Geneva.
