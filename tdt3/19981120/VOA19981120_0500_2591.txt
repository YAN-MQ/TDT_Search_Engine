Hello, everyone and welcome to Science World. I am Brian Sislack. 
Several large studies have shown that people who have had heart attacks 
and are socially isolated or depressed are more likely to have a second 
attack or suffer other heart complications than are those whose lives 
are happier. This theory is now undergoing a major test in the nationwide 
study sponsored by Harvard School of Public Health and the U.S. National 
Heart, Lung, and Blood Institute. This study called Enriched For Enhancing 
Recovery And Coronary Heart Disease involves 3,000 heart patients 
spread over eight sites across the United States. The participants 
all isolated and depressed, have been divided into two groups. One 
receives standard medical treatment. The other, gets the treatment 
plus social support, including weekly meetings with a psychologist 
or social workers, therapy aimed at alleviating depression and enabling 
them to get social support, and an opportunity to participate in group 
therapy. The study is double blind in that those evaluating the data, 
do not know which patients belong to which group. The patients will 
be followed for three and a half years, in addition to confirming 
the benefits of social interventions for heart patients, the researchers 
hope to determine the precise mechanism by which depression contributes 
further to heart disease. Is it simply that those who are depressed 
are less likely to eat well, exercise, and seek medical attention, 
and more likely to smoke and drink excessively? Or is there some connection 
between a depressed person's brain chemistry and heart disease? Curious 
minds seek out the answer.
