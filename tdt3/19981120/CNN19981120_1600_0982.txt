Not a bad way to end the week. Blue chip stocks closed above the 9100 
Mark for the first time since July. The Dow industrials are now within 
2% of their all-time high, also set in july. Trading has been heavy 
today, due to the expiration of some options and futures contracts. 
That's known as double witching. The Dow industrials finished the 
day up 103 points at 9159, led by a strong performance from financial 
stocks. Weakness in high-tech issues weighed on the NASDAQ all day.
