The 1990s have seen a decline in the number of women who smoke during 
pregnancy, though hundreds of thousands still light up. The centers 
for disease control and prevention found 13.6% of pregnant women smoked 
in 1996. That's down from 18.4% in 1990. The highest rate of smoking 
during pregnancy is among women aged 15 to 19.
