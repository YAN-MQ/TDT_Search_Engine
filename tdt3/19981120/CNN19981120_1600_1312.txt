One of the big games on tomorrow's college football schedule will 
take place at the Horseshoe in Columbus. Ohio state plays host to 
a Michigan team they have beaten only once in the last ten years. 
In games like this, players, big players, got to make -- they got 
to make plays. You know, Desmond Howard made big plays, Charles Woodson 
made big plays, biakabutuka made big plays, in the games they've won. 
So our great players, our so-called "great players" have got to step 
up this week and make plays.
