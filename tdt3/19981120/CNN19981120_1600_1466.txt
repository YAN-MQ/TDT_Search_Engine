It wasn't a cat on a hot tin roof in Indianapolis, but a cat on a 
cold steel light pole. Sammy the cat climbed up this pole, but then 
couldn't figure out how to get down. His owner says she thought Sammy 
might fall and lose one of his nine lives. But a rescue crew used 
a cherry picker to go up and save him.
