It's blast off for the biggest space mission in history. The first 
part of the international space station lifted off from Kazakstan 
earlier today. It's due to form part of an orbital station more than 
100 yards long. Sixteen countries are involved in the project, including 
the United States. NASA Chief Dan Golden is excited by today's successful 
launch. Within a few years, the brightest star ever will appear in 
the sky. It'll be a sign of hope because all these nations are coming 
together to utilize technology, not to blow up humanity, but to make 
this place a better world and to leave earth orbit and to land on 
Mars. Dan Golden of NASA.
