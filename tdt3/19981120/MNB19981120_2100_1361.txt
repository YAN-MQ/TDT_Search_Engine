One story that may be soon to go away, the biggest civil settlement 
in history was reached today between big tobacco, as it's known, and 
all the remaining states that filed lawsuits against the industry. 
The cigarette companies have agreed to pay $206 billion over 25 years 
to help the states recover the cost of treating sick smokers. They 
will also stop advertising on billboards and no longer use cartoon 
characters like Joe camel.
