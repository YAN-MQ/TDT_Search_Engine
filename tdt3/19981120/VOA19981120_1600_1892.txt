The international space station era has begun with the launch Friday 
of the first station module. VOA science correspondent, David MacElary 
tells us the Russian space agency has sent a component called Zaria, 
into orbit. Zaria, the foundation for the space station to come, took 
off atop a Russian proton rocket. From the cold barren windswept Russian 
launch center at Bikanor in the Central Asian nation Caussakston. 
U.S. space agency commentator Rob Nabias, followed the launch from 
Russian mission control near Moscow. Main engine start. Six engines 
up and running. And liftoff. Liftoff of the proton rocket on the Zaria 
control module. The international space station is under way. Zaria 
deployed its antennas and solar wings shortly after launch and will 
be boosted to an altitude of 380 kilometers within a few weeks. There 
it will await an early December visit by a U.S. space shuttle crew, 
which will attach the first U.S. module to it. Over the next five 
years, more modules, solar arrays, a robot arm, and other hardware 
from 16 nations will be added. Even as international research crews 
inhabit that station beginning in the year 2000. David MacElary, VOA 
News, Washington.
