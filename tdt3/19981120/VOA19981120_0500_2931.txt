A number of Japanese lenders are lining up for public money to help 
them over the rough spots as they write-off trillions of yen in bad 
loans. To accept a some of the $34 billion worth of government aid 
for lenders, the banks will have to cut costs and end years of poor 
credit controls. In addition, they will have to agree to increase 
lending to small and medium sized companies, which have been collapsing 
at near record pace. Finding money for capital expenditures for many 
Japanese companies, has become nearly impossible.
