Actress Michele Lee says the location of her new star on the Hollywood 
walk of fame brings back some fond memories. Lee's former cast mates 
were on hand for the unveiling yesterday. She says her father owned 
a Deli down the street and her grandfather also lived on that street. 
Lee appeared on all 344 episodes of the series "knots landing," which 
ran from 1979 to 1993.
