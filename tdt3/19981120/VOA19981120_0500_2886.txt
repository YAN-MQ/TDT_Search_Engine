Tokyo's stocks rose sharply reaching a 10-week high after Prime Minister 
Obuchi indicated he may consider a plan to deepen income tax cuts 
and revise the national sales tax. Many economists believe it was 
the two percent hike in the sales tax that sent the Japanese economy 
into recession. The NIK 225 Index gained 425 points to 14,780. President 
Clinton who has been visiting Japan, told a group of Japanese and 
American business people that Japan must carry out economic reforms 
quickly, including opening up Japanese markets. He said a failure 
to do so, or even a delay, could make Japan's economic troubles, even 
worse.
