A diplomatic squabble is intensifying between Turkey and Italy over 
a Kurdish rebel leader held by police in Rome. Abdullah Urgulan is 
wanted in Turkey for the deaths of thousands of people in a violent 
campaign by his Kurdish separatist group the PKK. Today he was ordered 
freed by a Rome court and Turkish Prime Minister Messet Yomats is 
warning of serious consequences. Chris Morris reports. The gloves 
have now come off in this growing diplomatic crisis between two NATO 
allies. After an emergency meeting with his advisors, a grim-faced 
Turkish prime minister argued that the Italian government's political 
stance had played a major role in the court's decision to release 
Mr. Urgulan. The fact that the PKK leader will not for the moment 
be allowed to leave Rome was no consolation for Ankora. As long as 
Italy tries to make peace with terrorism, Mr. Yoma said, it will earn 
Turkey's enduring hostility. Chris Morris, BBC News, Ankora.
