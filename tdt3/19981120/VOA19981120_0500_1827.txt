The Palestinian Authority is refusing to take over West Bank areas 
vacated by Israel in the first stage of its pull out under the Wye 
River Interim Peace Accord. The Palestinians say the territory is 
smaller than what has been agreed upon. Israeli radio says the Ministerial 
Committee on Withdrawal Affairs made last minute changes on the maps 
and Palestinian leader, Yasser Arafat is demanding to see them. Senior 
commanders from the two sides overseeing the pull out have flown by 
helicopter to Hebron for a meeting with Mr. Arafat. In the first stage 
of the Interim Accord, Palestinians are to gain control, partial control 
over 2 percent more land and full control over 7.1 percent more land. 
The Accord calls for Israel to hand over 13 percent more of the West 
Bank land in stages as Palestinians take steps to boost security.
