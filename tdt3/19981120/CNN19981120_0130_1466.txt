Linda Tripp's taped conversations with Monica Lewinsky alone are a 
good reason to watch what you say on the phone. It seems lots of people 
have Hang-UPS about privacy. Jeanne Moos reports. After listening 
to Linda Tripp -- Oh, Monica, Monica, Monica. And Monica Lewinsky 
-- I would deny, deny, deny. -- it's hard to deny feeling a little 
phobic about using the phone. Have you ever felt like you were being 
recorded when you're on the phone? MA'am, that would be great, thank 
you, if you could do that. You know what, yes, I have sometimes. But 
I'm on the phone, if you'll excuse me. I'm really sorry, don't mean 
to be rude. What's really rude is taping somebody's conversation. 
Even royalty's not immune. A right royal shocker. The Charles and 
Camilla love tape. From Charles and Camilla to Newt Gingrich to Bill 
and Gennifer -- But I just think that if everybody's on record denying 
it, you got no problem. No wonder folks are suspicious. Oh, definitely. 
Oh, totally. What makes you suspicious? Strange noises on the telephone. 
You mean like the ones Monica heard? You know what's really weird? 
I keep hearing these double clicks. That's my gum. Oh, okay. She used 
a radio shack recorder. And like I said, if she used one of our recorders, 
she wouldn't have to say she was chewing gum. No clicks. No clicks. 
Gregg graison represents quark, a Manhattan store specializing in 
surveillance -- for instance, this $100 ear mic that plugs into a 
tape recorder. Now, you put the phone headset against your head, have 
your conversation, record both sides nice and clear. Far fancier than 
what Linda Tripp apparently used. Excuse me, do you happen to have 
the Linda Tripp phone recording conversation model? What you have 
to do is you add a device to one of these. Do you ever get the feeling 
like you're being recorded when you're on the phone? I did a long 
time ago when I ran an escort service. You don't even have to be the 
one having the conversation to be taped. Take fox sports announcer 
Joe Buck, whose wife broke the news. And I am awakened from a deep 
sleep to, "you're on Tripp/Lewinsky tapes." And that got my attention 
immediately. Joe and two other TV announcers were calling game five 
of last year's New York/Cleveland playoff when Linda Tripp left the 
phone to get a Bite to eat. I'm starving. Hold on, it's just in the 
oven. High hop, Derek jeter is over in front of that ball. So nice 
to know what average Americans are talking about when you're doing 
a game. And if you think listening to 22 hours of tapes is dull, watch 
the drowsy lady screen left of Ken Starr and the guy fighting slumber 
on the right. When it comes to impeachment, better sleep on it. Jeanne 
Moos, CNN, New York.
