Ministers from the organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries gather 
next week to ponder what to do about falling oil prices. For the past 
year, OPEC members have voluntarily cut production, hoping to drive 
up demand and prices. But the strategy hasn't worked. Prices continue 
to fall and now oil companies in the United States and elsewhere are 
beginning to feel the pinch. Liz George has the story from our business 
desk in New York. The price of oil is currently at 10-year lows, languishing 
at around $10 a barrel of crude. An industry struggling with a deep 
recession. Already companies both worldwide and in the U.S. have cut 
exploration budgets and now job losses are beginning to hit at head 
offices. Occidental Petroleum announced this week it's reducing stock 
by 25 percent at its offices in Los Angeles and Dallas. Meanwhile, 
in a bid to increase prices, the OPEC countries are expected to continue 
their 5 percent production cuts. William Brown's an independent oil 
analyst with WH Brown and Company. I don't think we'll see countries 
all of a sudden say well this is getting us nowhere. Let's just sell 
more oil again and try to get what we can and I think of all these 
countries, Mexico would probably be the least likely. They really 
don't have that much spare capacity and they wouldn't gain that much. 
Saudi Arabia and others certainly have more spare capacity. And even 
with the price plummet that such action would suggest, these Gulf 
countries might make a little more money over the short term but you're 
just going to end up in another downward spiral. This market right 
now is weak enough so that it cannot tolerate any violation of this 
discipline that we've seen so far. It's in a very delicate edge and 
next week's OPEC meeting is probably their most important in history. 
Analysts expect consumers can count on low gas prices at the pump 
at least through the winter months.
