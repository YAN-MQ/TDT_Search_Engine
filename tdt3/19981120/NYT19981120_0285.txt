As if they were Boy Scouts doing a good deed, soldiers stopped traffic 
Friday to allow student demonstrators in bright yellow college jackets 
to hand out purple orchids in a gesture of peace. The soldiers stood 
by quietly outside a downtown university as 1,000 people mourned the 
shooting deaths of some of the 16 student demonstrators a week ago. 
The troops allowed a small group of demonstrators to cross their lines 
to demonstrate at the National Monument, demanding that former President 
Suharto be put on trial. Despite the military's insistence that soldiers 
had been issued only blanks and rubber bullets before the shooting 
last Friday reports have emerged that metal bullet fragments had been 
found in some victims' bodies. The military promised an investigation 
into whether live rounds had been fired. ``The investigation aims 
to find out exactly what went wrong,'' I. Wayan Karya, a spokesman 
for the office of President B.J. Habibie, said. ``We want to find 
out why, despite the fact that live ammunition was expressly prohibited 
by military commanders, one post-mortem did locate a bullet embedded 
in the body of a victim.'' Dr. Munim Idries at Cipto Mangunkusumo 
Hospital, where post-mortems were carried out, said Friday that he 
had found fragments from ``high-velocity type'' bullets in the bodies 
of seven students. A hospital official said the fragments had been 
handed over to the military for investigation. The shootings have 
aroused widespread anger at the military at a time when it is under 
pressure to withdraw from its pervasive political and social roles. 
Graffiti appeared Friday on a overpass here reading, ``Death to the 
Army,'' and they were quickly erased. Next week Parliament is to consider 
proposals to reduce the military representation in its own membership. 
The military has 75 appointed seats in the 500-member legislature. 
The proposals include a phased reduction beginning with a cut to 55 
or 25 seats to an immediate and the complete elimination of military 
representation. Although the military leadership favors reducing its 
role, it has to contend with resistance in its ranks to eliminating 
the privileges that brings. The military is also concerned about continuing 
dangers of instability as Indonesia contends simultaneously with an 
economic crisis and a political transition. While the military was 
put on the defensive by the killings last week, Habibie took the offensive 
against his critics, accusing a group of respected former generals 
and officials of using the demonstrations to try to topple his government. 
Ten opponents have been charged this week with sedition and barred 
from leaving the country. The Jakarta Post, an English-language newspaper, 
expressed outrage Friday over the treatment of Habibie's opponents, 
calling the charges a trademark of his predecessor, Suharto. In a 
speech on Thursday, Habibie warned that civil unrest could threaten 
the changes that he has put in motion. In the six months since Suharto 
was forced to resign, the government has allowed the formation of 
new parties, opened the door to free speech and a free press and moved 
to arrange general elections for early next year. ``We are running 
against time,'' the president said. ``Concrete measures have to be 
taken. The stakes are very great. It will not be an impossibility 
that social unrest continues to be rampant, eventually threatening 
the unity of our nation.''
