Israeli troops have begun pulling out of West Bank areas under an 
interim peace deal with the Palestinians. The United States seeks 
international donors to help pay for the costs of supporting that 
peace accord. Special prosecutor, Kenneth Starr, is sharply questioned 
by President Clinton's lawyers at congressional impeachment hearings. 
And the first component for the international space station is launched 
about four hours ago with our live coverage from our science correspondent. 
I am Charlene Porter along with Paul Westfieling in Washington. Details 
on these and other stories, sports, business news, and more in this 
hour of News Now. The news is next.
