Pollsters are weighing in on Ken Starr's testimony. 652 people were 
questioned between 6:00 P.M. and 9:00 P.M. last night for the latest 
CNN/"USA today" Gallup poll. 26% of respondents say Starr's presentation 
was "excellent." 41% rate it "good." % say it was "not so good." And 
12% rate the presentation "poor." The poll also asked people if the 
impeachment hearing is accomplishing something worthwhile. 43% of 
the respondents say yes. 49% say no. Overall, the hearing did not 
change many minds on the impeachment question. The percentage of respondents 
who want their representative to vote for impeachment, as well as 
the significantly higher percentage of respondents who do not, remains 
statistically unchanged from the period before the hearing.
