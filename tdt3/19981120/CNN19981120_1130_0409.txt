U.N. weapons inspectors did not observe a traditional Muslim day of 
rest today. At least three U.N. trucks and their Iraqi escorts headed 
out towards unnamed locations. The inspectors say they want to get 
as much done as they can in as little time as possible. Today is the 
third day the inspectors have been back at work since the end of the 
crisis with Iraq.
