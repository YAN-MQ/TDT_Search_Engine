Now we are turning to business news. Les Carpenter joins us for the 
latest in what is happening in the European and Asian markets on this 
Friday. Well, thank you very much, Charlene. Share prices in Europe 
are higher. The Frankfort Dashes is up 72 points, the Swiss market 
index has gained around a hundred, the London Flipsy up 43 and Parisdaq 
40, up 60. European markets are showing some optimism that a Japanese 
plan to boost the economy may finally start that country out of its 
recessions.
