Computermakers are doing more to make computers cheaper and simpler, 
while meeting the needs of consumers. Marsha Walton has more in this 
edition of "tech trends." The desktop computer has revolutionized 
the way we live, work and play, but attendees here at the comdex computer 
show say that box may not be with us forever. The PC as we know it 
probably is going away, and where it's going is it's going to be going 
with us. High-tech analyst Cheryl currid says the PC's "smarts" are 
going to be in smaller hybrid devices -- palm-sized computers, phones 
that double as fax machines, scanners that can capture data from a 
page and beam it wirelessly to many other devices. The benefit of 
so many of these devices is you can be smart when you're not in front 
of your PC. Analysts say the computer has always been in sync with 
the needs of the corporate world. But far too often, the computer 
industry has not explored the needs of the average consumer. For the 
last 20 years, all we've done is bring digital technology to business. 
What we really are in now, as an industry starting to do, is take 
technology and move it to other devices, and as a result, bring it 
to the masses. For example, new devices like this web pad look a lot 
more like an etch-A-sketch than a computer. It's wireless, you can 
roam around the house with it, send an E-mail and surf the net. But 
you won't find spreadsheets or word documents, it's made strictly 
for personal use. My mom is actually my inspiration. If my mom can't 
use it, we don't want to build it. For the 2,400 exhibitors here at 
comdex, the whole idea of computers is changing. We won't just sit 
in front of them anymore, we will wear them and carry them and get 
them to start working for us. Marsha Walton, CNN, Las Vegas.
