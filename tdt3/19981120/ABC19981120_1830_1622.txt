Finally this evening, a word about language. How do you say Buyer 
beware in French? We feel a little sorry for Malcolm Pierce. He's 
an English farmer and even though the English never have liked the 
french, he bought a herd of French cows at auction in France for his 
farm in England. It seems the French cows produce more protein in 
their milk. Come on, come on, girls. The trouble is that when Malcolm 
calls the cows to be milked, the french cows ignore him. Yes, it turns 
out that French cows feel the same way about the English language 
that the French government does. So meet olivier, whose French is 
excellent. It just seemed natural to me that they should be looked 
after by someone who speaks to them in French and my schoolboy French 
isn't any good anymore. The French government would be very pleased. 
Sounds good to us.
