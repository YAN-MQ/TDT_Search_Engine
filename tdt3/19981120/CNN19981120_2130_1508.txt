Negotiators for NBA owners and players returned to the bargaining 
table today for the first time in three weeks. Gary Tuchman tells 
us how the dispute is affecting fans of all ages. The NBA has been 
M.I.A. and whether it's children shooting hoops on the playgrounds 
or Wall Street traders participating in leagues in gymnasiums, there 
is a longing to see the league that has disappeared. I think it's 
a shame that we can't watch these great superstars play. It makes 
me mad, 'cause I really like the NBA. Players and owners held talks 
on Friday in an effort to end the nBA lockout. But the NBA's deputy 
commissioner says -- I don't have any particular reason to be optimistic 
here. Comments like that don't make the fans happy, and neither do 
comments like this, from the star center of the New York Knicks. We 
feel that we are fighting for our lives and our livelihoods. From 
the fans who help pay the players' salaries, there's not a Lot of 
compassion. I blame the players, 'cause they should have not, like, 
asked for the money, first of all. 'cause I think they, like, make 
a lot of money anyway. But there are plenty of fans who slam the owners 
along with the players. People are constantly telling children, you 
know, "you're this, you're that. You're acting, you know, childish, 
you have to grow up." And meanwhile, you have these grown men who 
are acting like children. Some of the real children say they think 
the players and the owners -- oh! -- are a bit stuck-up. They have 
too much -- too big of an ego. But despite the hard feelings, there 
are some who say the NBA can recover from this better than other professional 
sports leagues. I think, really, that if they can get back to playing 
games by the Super Bowl, which is when an awful lot of people turn 
and look at basketball for the first time -- if they can do that, 
I really don't think there'll be any damage whatsoever. Basketball 
fans do not have a lot of sympathy for the wealthy NBA players and 
owners when they talk about their financial problems. But without 
pro games to watch, the fans, in their own way -- Yeah! -- are realizing 
a net loss. Gary Tuchman, CNN, New York.
