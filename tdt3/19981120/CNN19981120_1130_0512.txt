A dozen consumer and environmental groups are pressuring the government 
to impose a ban on vinyl toys, which they say can be dangerous to 
children. Rusty Dornin has details. Soft vinyl toys, the kind kids 
love to chew. Now the environmental group Greenpeace and 11 consumer 
groups are calling for a ban all vinyl toys for kids under the age 
of 6. the danger, they say, is phthalate, a softening ingredient used 
in vinyl toys, a toxin found to cause liver damage in rats when digested. 
Unlike our drugs and other materials that must be tested for safety 
and efficacy, through the food, drug and cosmetic act, toys can be 
marketed as poison without any information until they're proven by 
the government to be unsafe. Tough timing for the toy industry, as 
the Christmas shopping season swings into gear. The toy manufacturers 
of America is now accusing Greenpeace of launching a Campaign based 
on scientific half truths. A retort backed up by the chemical manufacturers 
association. These toys have been used for over 30 years. A small 
amount, a very, very minute amount of phthalates will come out or 
may come out when a child sucks on a toy. a minute amount that chemical 
manufacturers say is safe. A federal watchdog agency is investigating 
and told CNN -- two European countries have banned the use of phthalates 
in toys, six others are considering restrictions. Consumer activists 
say if the federal government or toy manufacturers don't take action, 
they will pursue a lawsuit under the California toxics law, which 
requires warning labels on all products containing carcinogens. Nicholas 
Olsen's mom says she's not pulling any toys out of her son's mouth 
yet. It does concern me, but I think you do need to wait until all 
the evidence is in. Consumers may learn more when the safety commission 
releases its report on phthalates, due before Christmas. Rusty Dornin, 
CNN, San Francisco.
