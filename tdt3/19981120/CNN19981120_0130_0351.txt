A word of warning before Thanksgiving -- the center for science in 
the public interest says government tests found nine out of ten turkeys 
carry bacteria that could cause food poisoning. Those findings came 
before the government implemented a new food safety program. To be 
safe, cooks should use a thermometer to check the inside temperature 
of both the Turkey and stuffing. A Turkey is ready when it reaches 
an inside temperature of 180 degrees. Stuffing must be 165 degrees 
to be safe.
