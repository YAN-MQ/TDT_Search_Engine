Britain is proposing new laws to crack down on soccer hooligans, racist 
fans and ticket scalpers. The measures, expected to be in place next 
season, have been called the toughest in the world by government officials. 
The plans for toughening up on soccer-related violence come in the 
wake of disturbances at this year's World Cup in France, where English 
troublemakers clashed with police and rival fans. There have also 
been violent outbursts on the pitch this season in English soccer. 
In one incident, Sheffield Wednesday player Paolo Di Canio pushed 
a referee to the ground. In another, West Ham striker John Hartson 
kicked teammate Eyal Berkovic in the head in a practice session. The 
measures, as reported in British newspapers, are to be unveiled next 
week by the Home Office. They include: _ increased fines and exclusion 
orders blocking known troublemakers from soccer matches in Britain. 
_ restrictions on ticket sales to keep scalpers from obtaining tickets 
of matches abroad. _ moves to make racist chants criminal offenses. 
_ increased powers to bar unconvicted but known hooligans from traveling 
to matches abroad. The crackdown, called for in a report earlier this 
year by former government minister David Mellor, is also aimed at 
helping England's bid to land the 2006 World Cup against competition 
from South Africa and Germany. An unidentified Home Office official, 
quoted in Friday's Daily Mail, said pressure would be put on league 
officials to crack down on player violence on the field. ``There is 
little point in us telling fans how to behave and weeding out the 
troublesome element if they see players essentially getting away with 
things,'' the paper cited the source as saying. ``Players misbehaving 
on the pitch inevitably give the impression to fans that it is OK 
to misbehave. We want to see player and the F.A. setting an example.''
