Wall Street gave investors a good reason to smile this week. On Friday, 
the Dow industrials rose 97 points. Even more impressive, the Dow 
was up nearly 10% during October. That's the best monthly performance 
in almost 12 years. Stock prices were helped by good economic news. 
The commerce department says the economy grew by a surprising 3.3% 
during the third quarter.
