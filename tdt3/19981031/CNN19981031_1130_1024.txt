Lori Waffenschmidt, CNN. "CNN Headline Sports" is next. Hi, I'm expecting 
a fax. Room 212 wants the ammunition to deal with her toughest clients. 
Nothing? Davies, 212. I called earlier. Right, fax. It hasn't come 
yet. I need it for a meeting. Excuse me, miss Davies? It just came 
in. Thank you, so much. Good morning, everyone. Business services
