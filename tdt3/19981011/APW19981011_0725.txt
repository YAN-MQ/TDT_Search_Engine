Under towering marble figures of the Jews who founded Christianity, 
Pope John Paul II on Sunday decreed the first Jewish-born saint of 
the modern era: Edith Stein, a nun killed in the gas chambers of Auschwitz. 
From now on, the pope said, Catholics should commemorate all the Holocaust's 
murdered Jews each year when they mark the day Stein died _ Aug. 9. 
``In the martyr Sister Teresa Benedicta of the Cross so many differences 
meet and are resolved in peace,'' John Paul, using the name Stein 
chose in the church, told the thousands filling St. Peter's Square. 
``The value of her testimony is to render ever stronger the bridge 
of mutual understanding between Christians and Jews,'' he said, calling 
Stein an ``eminent daughter of Israel and a faithful daughter of the 
church.'' It was a day filled with remarkable gestures of reconciliation: 
The Roman Catholic Church putting all its ceremony, pomp and grandeur 
into a tribute to a woman of Jewish heritage. Relatives of Holocaust 
victims _ Stein's family _ sharing a dais with the leader of Germany, 
Chancellor Helmut Kohl. Stein is believed to be the first Jewish-born 
saint since the early days of the church, said the Rev. Simion Hernandez, 
who oversaw the process toward canonization. Incomplete records and 
the prevalence of conversions, voluntary and forced, make it impossible 
to say for certain. She was born into an Orthodox Jewish German family 
on Yom Kippur, the Jewish Day of Atonement, in 1891. An atheist, she 
joined the Roman Catholic Church in 1922 and later became a Carmelite 
nun. In 1942, Adolf Hitler's regime ordered all the converts in the 
Netherlands shipped to Auschwitz to punish the Dutch bishops for speaking 
out against it. Stein was offered a chance to escape deportation, 
the pope said, but turned it down. ``Why should I be excluded?'' he 
quoted her as saying. ``If I cannot share the fate of my brothers 
and sisters, my life is, in a certain way, destroyed.'' Stein was 
in a chapel praying with nuns of her order when the Nazis came to 
arrest her. Her sister, who had followed her into Catholicism, also 
was among the converts deported. At Auschwitz, they are thought to 
have been taken almost directly from the trains to the gas chambers. 
``We remember all of them today with profound respect,'' said John 
Paul, whose voice stayed strong throughout the 2 1/2-hour ceremony. 
``From now on, in celebrating the memory of our new saint, we also 
cannot forget the Shoah, which slowly worked at the elimination of 
a people, costing the lives of millions of Jewish brothers and sisters,'' 
he declared, using the Hebrew word for the Holocaust. In Jerusalem, 
the Simon Wiesenthal Center protested Stein's canonization. ``She 
could in no way symbolize the Jewish martyrs of the Holocaust because 
she chose to leave Judaism,'' said one center official, Ephraim Zuroff. 
In naming Stein a saint, the church credits her with interceding almost 
a half-century after her death to save a toddler's life. More than 
a decade ago, at 2 1/2, Teresia Benedicta McCarthy of Brockton, Mass., 
swallowed an overdose of Tylenol and suffered such severe liver damage 
that she was put on a priority list for a transplant. Then, overnight, 
she recovered. Benedicta's doctor called the recovery miraculous, 
and the church agreed _ saying the only explanation were the prayers 
that the McCarthys and their friends offered to Stein. Benedicta's 
family had urged that the church mark her canonization with a fuller 
accounting of the church's actions in the Holocaust, as had Stein's 
relatives. The family of Stein's grandnephew, Michael Biberstein of 
Kensington, Calif., wrote the pope in August, the San Diego Union-Tribune 
reported. They praised John Paul for his ``goodwill to the Jewish 
people'' but said the past is ``still waiting to be fully acknowledged.'' 
In March, the Vatican issued a long-awaited statement of regret that 
Catholics did not say and do more to stop Nazi persecution of Jews, 
but praised the conduct of wartime pope Pius XII, whom some accuse 
of failing to do enough. Improving relations with Jews has been a 
tenet of John Paul's papacy, as has been the creation of saints. More 
people have been canonized during his papacy, which reaches its 20th 
anniversary on Friday, than in any other.
