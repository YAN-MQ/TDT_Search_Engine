With a look at your "Headline News weather," I'm Karen McGinnis. A 
fairly vigorous frontal system begins to push onshore, Vancouver island 
and coastal sections of British Columbia, Washington and into Oregon. 
Some of the winds may gust in excess of 50 miles an hour. A developing 
storm system across the U.S./Canadian border. Farther to the north, 
look for some snowfall. To the south, breezy conditions. As we head 
into the southeast, high pressure is going to be in control and temperatures 
will be fairly mild, readings mostly in the 70s. In Fairbanks, Alaska, 
expect a cloudy day and 40 degrees. In our extended forecast, heavy 
rainfall is anticipated for Tuesday in coastal sections of Washington, 
also into Oregon. And still windy through the midwestern United States. 
For Wednesday, look for unsettled weather conditions into the Great 
Lakes, where some of the coldest readings will be reported. Then for 
Thursday, more rain for the northwest, also beginning to push into 
the northeast into New England.
