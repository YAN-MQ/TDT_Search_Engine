A woman who was born an orthodox Jew and died a Roman Catholic nun 
is now a Saint. But not everyone's happy about it. Gayle young reports. 
With all the pomp and ceremony of the Vatican, a Jewish convert killed 
in the Holocaust was made the Roman Catholic church's newest Saint. 
Edith Stein became a carmelite nun in the years before she was gassed 
at the auschwitz concentration camp. Pope John Paul II decreed the 
date of her death as a Catholic memorial day for Holocaust victims. 
Some Jewish groups condemned the canonization, saying Stein was exterminated 
by the Nazis because she was born an orthodox Jew. But Catholics in 
St. Peter's square defended the choice. As long as she's baptized, 
Catholic and a member of good standing of our faith. God bless her. 
I am glad she's being made a Saint. We are happy to have her. I feel, 
"hurrah for her." I am glad she made it. Stein's dramatic life was 
the subject of an Italian movie. She converted to catholicism and 
became a nun in her 30s. The church tried to Shelter her during the 
war. But in 1942, she was shipped to auschwitz with other Catholics 
who had converted from Judaism. She died in a gas chamber. 40 years 
after her death, Stein was believed by the faithful to have saved 
the life of an American girl. Teresia benedicta McCarthy, who was 
in Rome for the ceremony, accidentally overdosed on Tylenol at age 
2. her family prayed to Stein and the child recovered. The church 
ruled it a miracle. And Stein qualified for sainthood. They started 
like telling everybody else to pray, and then like all of a sudden 
I got better. Former German chancellor Helmut Kohl also attended the 
ceremony. The Pope appeared weak at times, even in pain. But despite 
the controversy from Jewish groups, he was determined to usher Stein 
into the Catholic pantheon of saints. Gayle young, CNN, Vatican city.
