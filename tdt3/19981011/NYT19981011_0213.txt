Bob Toledo and Cade McNown doth protest too much. For all the one-game-at-a-time 
rhetoric from UCLA's coach and quarterback, they would have difficulty 
ignoring that the football cosmos shifted dramatically toward the 
West Coast this past weekend. The Bruins (4-0 overall, 2-0 Pacific 
10) have been winning impressively but needed outside help for a chance 
at the national championship. They got it on Saturday when Nebraska 
lost. Those two words had not been uttered in 19 games. So UCLA, a 
52-28 winner over Arizona, jumped to second in the Associated Press 
and USA Today/CNN polls and in the New York Times computer ranking, 
behind No. 1 Ohio State. It is the highest ranking since 1988 for 
the Bruins, who in 1954 tied with the Buckeyes for their only national 
title. At least one Bruin was excited. Running back Keith Brown, who 
ran for 91 yards and two touchdowns, was expecting to return to the 
state of Arizona for the Fiesta Bowl on Jan. 4. ``Whether or not we're 
No. 1, we're still going to play Ohio State in the Fiesta Bowl if 
we keep winning like this,'' Brown said, ``so we'll be No. 1 once 
we win that game.'' Toledo said: ``That's the farthest thing from 
my mind at this point. Next week, we've got a talented Oregon team 
coming to our house.'' The Ducks, behind Akili Smith, the nation's 
leading passer, are 5-0 (2-0 Pacific-10) after defeating Washington 
State, 51-29. That sets up the only battle of the unbeatens on Saturday 
at the Rose Bowl. True, the season is barely to the midway point. 
But who would have thought that the Ducks (ranked seventh by the Times 
computer and 11th by the AP) would be playing the Bruins in an important 
game? That is how profoundly Nebraska's 28-21 defeat at Texas A&AMP;M 
altered the rankings. Nebraska fell to eighth, and A&AMP;M rose to 
10th in the AP poll and to 12th in the Times ranking. The Cornhuskers 
have shared or won outright three of the last four national championships. 
But they showed their vulnerability the week before when they needed 
a goal-line stand to beat Oklahoma State, and they showed their mortality 
against an A&AMP;M squad that ran over them with 113 yards from Dante 
Hall and 110 yards from Ja'Mar Toombs. Tennessee made an emphatic 
statement to remain in the title picture. The Volunteers blitzed Georgia's 
freshman quarterback, Quincy Carter, into 14-of-38 passing with two 
interceptions, and won easily, 22-3. Travis Stephens rushed for 107 
yards and Travis Henry added 53, easing concern about their running 
game after Jamal Lewis tore up his knee. Tennessee can also take a 
heartening look at its schedule. The Volunteers, who climbed a notch 
to third in the AP poll and moved up three spots for fourth in the 
Times computer ranking, play four of their remaining six games at 
home. Only one opponent, Arkansas, is ranked in the Top 20. Kansas 
State's schedule only gets tougher. The Wildcats, who won unimpressively 
by 16-9 over Colorado (No. 19 AP, No. 7 Times), still must play Oklahoma 
State, Nebraska and Missouri. Kansas State (No. 4 AP, No. 3 Times) 
had been winning by an average score of 62-5 playing weak teams. ``I 
don't pay that much attention to margins of victory,'' Kansas State 
coach Bill Snyder said after Saturday's game, ``but I don't think 
we played as well as we're capable of playing.'' Behind by 7 on Saturday 
night, Colorado had a chance for one last drive until coach Rick Neuheisel 
and Bob Hauck, his special teams coach, both inserted punt returners, 
giving the Buffaloes 12 men on the field. ``Our fans deserved 37 seconds 
to see what might have happened,'' Neuheisel said. No such mistakes 
helped decide Ohio State's fate. The Buckeyes put a clamp on their 
top ranking with a 41-0 pasting of Illinois. Quarterback Joe Germaine 
threw for 307 yards and three touchdowns, and the defense limited 
Illinois to 57 yards rushing. The Buckeyes do not have a Top 25 opponent 
left on their schedule. One of the emerging teams they avoid is Wisconsin. 
The Badgers ascended three rungs to ninth in the AP and the coaches' 
poll and six spots to 13th in the Times computer after they survived 
a record 83 throwing attempts by Purdue's Drew Brees in a 31-24 victory. 
Wisconsin coach Barry Alvarez took the UCLA approach to his team's 
lofty rating. ``Are we ranked as high as we should be?'' he asked. 
``I don't know, and I don't really care.''
