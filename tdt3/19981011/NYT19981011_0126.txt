Things have reached a sad state when two hours with Ann-Margret isn't 
sexy. This is no reflection on the actress, who has been exuding sensuality 
since ``Bye Bye Birdie,'' when she was 22. Now, at 57, she seems the 
perfect choice to play Pamela Harriman, America's ambassador to France 
who was better known for the powerful men she had loved and/or married. 
But the resulting film, which has its premiere Monday on Lifetime, 
is deadly. ``Life of the Party: The Pamela Harriman Story'' seems 
to want to paint Harriman as a great courtesan. But it keeps telling 
us how irresistible she was to men while illustrating nothing of the 
kind. The flashback to London in 1941, where the young Pamela Digby 
Churchill first meets Averell Harriman, reveals this film's Harlequin 
Romance-style idea of enticing dialogue. The scene, in which bombs 
are dropping while the couple are at a party and all the other guests 
are running for the shelter, boils down to this: Averell: ``You like 
danger, don't you?'' Pamela: ``Hold me.'' Close-up: his hand unzipping 
her dress. In a later scene, Leland Hayward, the agent and Broadway 
producer who becomes Pamela's second husband, is astounded by her 
sexual skills. ``You wouldn't believe what she could do with an ice 
cube,'' he tells a friend by telephone. ``You do? Well, did she tell 
you that she learned it from the Duchess of Windsor? I mean, no wonder 
Eddie abdicated.'' The name dropping is one of the film's few enjoyable 
aspects. The '50s period detail is another. Scenes with Babe Paley 
and Betsy Whitney, who act as a sort of Greek chorus, analyzing Pamela's 
romantic situations over elegant lunches, look like a gorgeous old 
Revlon ad come to life. Beyond that, the plot unfolds in disappointing 
just-the-facts style. Pamela leaves her native England, her first 
husband (Randolph Churchill, son of Winston) and her teen-age son 
to move to New York in 1955. Betsy and Babe introduce her to Hayward. 
Pamela impresses him by having researched Broadway musicals, marries 
him, alienates his daughter Brooke and takes care of him until his 
death in 1971. Within a year, she marries Harriman, now a former governor 
of New York. All it takes is a little fiddling with dinner-party place 
cards and a quick visit to Frank Sinatra to make him jealous. She 
moves to Washington, alienates Harriman's godson, Peter Duchin, whom 
he reared, and cares for her husband until his death in 1986. Alone 
at last, she throws herself into Democratic politics, becomes an ambassador 
and dies in Paris in February, 1997. After the movie, Lifetime is 
showing a documentary, ``Intimate Portrait: Pamela Harriman,'' which 
covers her childhood and her earlier liaisons, among them Prince Aly 
Khan and Edward R. Murrow. ``The remarkable thing,'' says Brooke Hayward, 
who married Duchin in 1985 (drawn together by a common hatred?), ``was 
that she wasn't remarkable.'' Judging by these two television productions, 
Ms. Hayward is right. PRODUCTION NOTES: `LIFE OF THE PARTY: THE PAMELA
