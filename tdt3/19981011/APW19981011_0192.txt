Ahead of a crucial Mideast summit this week in Washington, Israel's 
Cabinet will oppose a U.S. initiative for its troops to withdraw from 
13 percent of the West Bank, an Israeli newspaper reported Sunday. 
Such a declaration by the Israeli government ahead of talks between 
Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, U.S. President Bill Clinton and 
Palestinian leader Yasser Arafat could harm chances to end months 
of stalemate and complete a peace deal. Netanyahu was meeting with 
his inner Cabinet Sunday, including Ariel Sharon, the foreign minister 
designate who also opposes the withdrawal plan, to prepare for the 
Oct. 15th summit. The summit will center around a U.S. peace plan 
that calls on Israel to withdraw from 13 percent of the West Bank 
in exchange for Palestinian measures against Islamic militants. Netanyahu's 
Cabinet, which is dominated by hard-liners who oppose land-for-peace 
deals with the Palestinians, is scheduled to meet Tuesday to discuss 
the deal, a day before the prime minister leaves for Washington. The 
Yediot Ahronot newspaper reported that the Cabinet will oppose a withdrawal 
from 13 percent and a proposed future withdrawal from an additional 
1 percent. In addition, the Cabinet will inform Netanyahu that they 
will only authorize the implementation of any deal after the Palestinians 
fulfill a series of demands that include disarming militants and annulling 
sections of the PLO charter, the report said. Netanyahu has come under 
fierce pressure from far-right members of his coalition government 
who have threatened to topple him if he goes ahead with another pullback. 
Israel committed to several withdrawals in a separate peace accords 
over a year ago, but has since said it would not be able to withdraw 
without specific security guarantees from Arafat that the land it 
cedes will not be used as havens for terrorists. Meanwhile, several 
hundred Palestinians burned Israeli and American flags and pictures 
of Sharon at an anti-peace rally in the West Bank city of Nablus. 
And in the Gaza Strip, an argument between Israeli and Palestinian 
policemen over security arrangements there ended in a scuffle with 
one Israeli policeman lightly hurt.
