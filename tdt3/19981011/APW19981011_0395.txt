Physicians blasted the government's decision to withhold anti-AIDS 
therapy from HIV victims who are pregnant and poor, a newspaper reported 
on Sunday. The policy was announced Friday by Health Minister Nkosazana 
Zuma, who said the government's new 80 million rand (dlrs 14 million) 
AIDS awareness campaign money would be better spent on public education. 
Doctors complained that the decision shut down five pilot projects 
that were to treat HIV positive mothers in the last month of pregnancy 
with AZT, a drug that reportedly can reduce by half the transmission 
rate of HIV to babies. ``Here's a real way we can prevent transmission 
and the government is not intervening,'' Glenda Gray, director of 
an HIV research unit at Chris Hani Baragwanath Hospital, was quoted 
as saying. Baragwanath serves the black township of Soweto outside 
of Johannesburg. Treatment was estimated to cost up to 750 rand (dlrs 
131) per patient for the last month of pregnancy. Zuma said a large 
number of women would have to be treated to save a small number of 
babies. Without treatment, up to 46 percent of HIV-positive mothers 
pass the virus to their babies, the newspaper said.
