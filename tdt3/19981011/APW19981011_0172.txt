The chief U.N. weapons inspector has apologized for accusing a former 
inspector of breaking the law by speaking out about Iraq's weapons 
capabilities. Richard Butler had accused the former inspector, Scott 
Ritter, of breaking the law by releasing details of information he 
collected while on official duty. In an interview earlier this month, 
Butler asked Ritter to ``desist from doing that.'' Ritter's lawyer, 
Matthew L. Lifflander, asked Butler to retract the accusation in a 
letter Wednesday. ``I apologize to Scott Ritter if he understood that 
I meant he broke the American law,'' Butler told the respected Arabic 
daily Al-Hayat, which is published in London. ``All that I meant was 
that he violated his commitments to the United Nations.'' The interview 
with Butler in New York was published Sunday. Since he resigned Aug. 
26, Ritter has spoken out several times on Iraq's weapons programs, 
accusing the United States and Britain of failing to stand behind 
inspectors. He also accused Butler of bowing to U.S. pressure by halting 
surprise inspections of sites. Ritter has been quoted by U.S. and 
Israeli newspapers as saying he dealt with Israeli intelligence and 
the CIA in seeking information on Iraq's weapons program. Iraq has 
long maintained that the U.N. Special Commission was not a neutral 
agency but worked under the United States and that some of the arms 
inspectors were spies, Ritter in particular. U.N. sanctions imposed 
on Iraq for its invasion of Kuwait in 1990, which led to the Gulf 
War, will not be lifted until U.N. arms monitors certify Baghdad has 
eliminated all its banned weapons.
