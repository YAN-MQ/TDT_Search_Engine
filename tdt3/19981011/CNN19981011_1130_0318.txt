Talks over the crisis in Yugoslavia are continuing in Belgrade at 
this hour as the threat of NATO air strikes looms. U.S. special envoy 
Richard Holbrooke is trying to convince Yugoslav President Slobodan 
Milosevic to stop the violence against ethnic Albanians in the Kosovo 
province. Sources close to Milosevic say he's willing to comply with 
some of Holbrooke's demands to avoid air strikes, but refuses to allow 
international observers into Kosovo. Holbrooke describes the situation 
as "very serious."
