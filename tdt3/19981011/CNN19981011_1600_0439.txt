Women younger than 75 are nearly twice as likely as men to die after 
a heart attack. That's according to a new study by Yale University 
researchers. They reached that conclusion after studying 1025 heart 
attack patients. They also found that of the people they studied, 
women older than 75 were less likely to die from a heart attack than 
men in the same age group.
