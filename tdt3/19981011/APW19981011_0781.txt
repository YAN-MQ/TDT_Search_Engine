Afghanistan's Taliban militia returned the bodies of three slain Iranian 
diplomats to Iran on Sunday, Iranian television reported. The move 
is likely aimed at defusing growing tensions between Iran, which has 
massed more than 200,000 troops on its eastern border with Afghanistan, 
and the Taliban. The Taliban has said that renegade militiamen killed 
eight Iranian diplomats and a journalist after the militia captured 
the northern Afghan city of Mazar-e-Sharif on Aug. 8. Iran has demanded 
the Taliban return the bodies of the Iranians and send the killers 
for trial in Tehran. The bodies of the other six Iranians already 
have been returned. ``An airplane carrying the bodies of three Iranian 
diplomats murdered by the Taliban in Mazar-e Sharif landed in Mashhad 
airport, northeastern Iran tonight,'' the television reported. The 
report was monitored by the British Broadcasting Corp. and received 
in Cairo. On Thursday, Iran said its border forces fought a three-hour 
battle with Taliban fighters, inflicting heavy casualties. The Taliban 
denied that any fighting took place and claimed that Iran has been 
firing artillery into Afghanistan. On Friday, the Taliban released 
five Iranians captured during the militia's sweep of the western part 
of the country. Iranian radio said the Iranians claimed that they 
were tortured. Taliban leaders, who are mostly Sunni Muslims, accuse 
Iran of arming and financing its northern-based opposition, which 
includes the country's minority Shiite Muslims. Most Iranians also 
are Shiite Muslims.
