Mike Sammond, "Headline Sports." The American league championship 
series is now a best of three. Orlando Hernandez pitched seven scoreless 
innings and Paul O'Neill went deep as the Yankees shut out the Indians 
4-0 Saturday night. The series is even at two games apiece. This was 
the biggest game we've played all year. There's no doubt about it. 
We're playing for our lives out there tonight. And he comes out, pitches 
out of trouble a couple times and nothing affects him.
