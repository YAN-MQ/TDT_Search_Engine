The justice department accuses visa and Mastercard not only of conspiring 
to dominate the credit card market but of holding back new technologies. 
Rick Lockridge reports. Smart cards are called that because they have 
an embedded microchip that keeps track of more kinds of information 
and allows more flexible types of uses than the magnetic stripes on 
traditional cards. But while smart cards have been widely embraced 
in parts of Europe, they never really caught on in the United States. 
Despite a pretty good push from visa. So what are the reasons for 
that? Some of them deal with the fundamental security of smart cards, 
and the truth is that smart cards are not very secure, they are very 
vulnerable to attack. And some of them may deal with practices that 
visa and Mastercard have taken place. In France, you can use the vitale 
smart card to pay for a doctors visit, and when you do, the card stores 
your updated patient information. Smart card makers insist there are 
no security weaknesses in the card, and say a user's money and privacy 
are always safe. All the data can be in your card or in your pocket. 
This means privacy, no big brother. But some experts say there's no 
guarantee Americans will embrace smart card technology, even if the 
government can loosen visa and Mastercard's alleged strangle hold 
on the American credit card market. This technology for the smart 
cards is still somewhat immature. Look for the rise in Internet commerce 
to possibly decide this issue. Studies show consumers don't like giving 
their credit card numbers over the net. And new super secure smart 
cards under development just for Internet shopping could tilt the 
balance and force American card issuers to get a little "smarter."
