House majority whip Tom delay says republicans are ready to stay in 
Washington until a budget agreement is in place. And he's challenging 
President Clinton to do the same. Budget talks continue behind closed 
doors with education as the major sticking point. Republicans are 
not opposed to spending more money on education, but they want it 
to be controlled at the state and local levels, not by the federal 
government. President Clinton's plan calls for more than $6 billion 
to modernize schools and hire new teachers. Any budget that does not 
do anything to help modernize our schools to give our children safe 
and clean places to learn does no fully prepare them for the 21st 
century. Tomorrow night, the funding to keep the government open expires 
again. Senator Daschle, congressman Gephardt, the democratic colleagues 
and I will work with the republican majority to do the right thing 
for our country. We must pass a budget that is fiscally responsible, 
that honors our values, that invests in the education of our children. 
That is the most important thing we can do in this long-running Congress. 
GOP proposals include education savings accounts and grants to individual 
schools to shrink class sizes.
