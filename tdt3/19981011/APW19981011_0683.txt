Egyptian Foreign Minister Amr Moussa will leave for Turkey on Monday 
in the latest bid by Egypt to calm the mounting crisis between Syria 
and Turkey. Moussa is expected to relay a message from Syrian President 
Hafez Assad to Turkish President Suleyman Demirel, Egypt's Al-Ahram 
newspaper reported Sunday. Its contents were not disclosed. Moussa 
will later fly to Damascus to relay to Assad the Turkish response, 
Egypt's Middle East News Agency reported. Tunisian Foreign Minister 
Said Bin Mustafa arrived in Damascus Sunday and also is expected to 
meet with Assad Monday to discuss the crisis. Turkey has demanded 
that Syria end its support for Kurdish rebels, expel a Kurdish leader 
and close Kurdish rebel camps in Syrian-controlled Lebanon. If Syria 
does not abide by the demands, Turkey has threatened to attack its 
southern neighbor. Syria has denied sheltering the rebels.
