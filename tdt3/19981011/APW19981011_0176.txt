BELGRADE, Yugoslavia (AP) _ U.S. envoy Richard Holbrooke insists ``nothing 
has changed'' in efforts to convince Yugoslavia to accept international 
demands for peace in Kosovo, despite the government's insistence it 
has met the demands of the international community. Holbrooke met 
again Sunday with President Slobodan Milosevic, whose crackdown on 
ethnic Albanian separatists in Kosovo seven months ago has brought 
NATO to the brink of airstrikes. Following a late night session which 
ended after midnight Sunday, the government's Tanjug news agency issued 
a statement saying all conditions necessary for a political settlement 
had been met and all U.N. demands fulfilled. But Holbrooke gave no 
hint of an impending breakthrough, saying ``nothing has changed.'' 
Calling the situation ``very serious,'' Holbrooke said NATO will meet 
Monday ``to authorize action'' unless he achieves a breakthrough for 
``a peaceful, acceptable'' alternative to the use of force. The major 
obstacle to an agreement appears to be Holbrooke's demand that Milosevic 
agree to an expanded international monitoring mission which would 
verify compliance with demands of the U.N. Security Council. Holbrooke 
alluded this early Sunday, saying his mission ``will continue an intense 
effort to find a peaceful, acceptable, fully verifiable compliance 
system as an alternative to the other choice'' _ meaning the use of 
force. But Holbrooke said ``we certainly don't agree.'' The Serbs 
appeared to be separating the demand for verification with the general 
conditions laid down by the Security Council. On Sunday, Belgrade's 
newspapers ran optimistic headlines suggesting that tensions had eased 
and that an agreement may be in sight. Ekspres Politika headlined: 
``Sobering Up,'' and Dnevni Telegraf bannered: '' NATO Threat Removed?'' 
Kosovo is a province of Serbia, the main republic of Yugoslavia. But 
its 2 million-strong population is 90 percent ethnic Albanian, and 
many of them want independence or substantial self-rule. Milosevic 
launched the crackdown after the Kosovo Liberation Army stepped up 
attacks on Serb police and troops in the troubled province. Sources 
close to Milosevic, speaking on condition of anonymity, said he had 
signaled his willingness to comply with six main demands in order 
to head off NATO intervention. Those measures include withdrawing 
more troops from Kosovo, allowing humanitarian aid to the refugees 
and opening up serious talks with the secessionists on the restoration 
of self-rule which he abolished in 1989. But the sources said Milosevic 
refused to budge on an additional demand to deploy an international 
monitoring force in the secessionist Serbian province. The force, 
aimed at seeing if he was living up to his commitments, would include 
some NATO troops. ``Milosevic won't make any concessions that go against 
the interests of the Serbian people,'' Dragan Tomic, a close Milosevic 
ally, said Saturday. The weekend of intensive diplomacy signals a 
glimmer of hope in efforts to avoid NATO action to halt a crackdown 
in Kosovo that has killed hundreds and displaced upwards of 300,000 
from their homes. Showing Milosevic it means business if talks fail, 
Washington ordered the deployment of six B-52 bombers, one reconnaissance 
aircraft and 13 tankers to Britain in preparation for possible intervention. 
Also stepping up the pressure, NATO Secretary-General Javier Solana 
said the 16 members all but erased their remaining differences on 
airstrikes at a meeting of alliance ambassadors Saturday. ``If Milosevic 
does not comply, I can tell you that NATO is ready to act,'' Solana 
told reporters in Brussels, Belgium. Washington is pressing for a 
monitoring force, which would include some NATO troops, because Milosevic 
gained a reputation for breaking promises during Bosnia's civil war. 
He also violated a pledge earlier this year to halt his offensive 
against the ethnic Albanian militants. Meanwhile, a top Russian military 
official said Moscow was prepared to take Yugoslavia's side in case 
of NATO airstrikes _ and provide weapons if necessary. ``I think that 
in this case, Russia will have a right to develop full-scale military 
cooperation with the Federal Republic of Yugoslavia,'' Col. Gen. Leonid 
Ivashov told NTV television station. Russia is the Serbs' main ally, 
sharing bonds of religion and joint Slavic roots.
