The Sudanese government on Sunday approved a bill that allows the 
formation of ``political associations'' that can compete in elections. 
Sudan's constitution, which was approved earlier this year, does not 
clearly mention the right to form political parties, which were banned 
after a 1989 coup, but does speak about the right to organize political 
associations. A government statement said that the new law would be 
effective Jan. 1. and that the associations would be able to compete 
in elections. The associations must commit themselves to ``the provisions 
of the constitution,'' which keep Islamic law in place, the statement 
said. The political associations will be barred from receiving funding 
from abroad, the statement added. Anyone convicted of crimes against 
the state would be banned from a leadership role in the associations, 
it said.
