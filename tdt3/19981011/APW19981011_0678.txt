What France's men couldn't do its women could, winning the epee team 
title Sunday at the world fencing championships. Italy's women, who 
had settled for silver and bronze in the individual foil event, joined 
forces to take gold in the team foil competition. Led by Laura Flessel, 
who won the individual epee title on Friday, France's women clinched 
the title with a 45-38 victory over Cuba. Ukraine beat out Hungary 
45-41 to take the bronze. France reached the gold-medal duel edging 
Hungary 45-43 in the semifinals, while Cuba had trounced the Ukraine 
45-32. Two-time individual foil world champion Giovanna Trillini, 
who went home with the silver earlier this week, led a strong Italian 
squad which included individual bronze medallist Valentina Vezzali. 
The Italians triumphed over Romania 45-35 for the crown, while Poland 
thumped Russia 45-30 for the bronze. Italy slashed its way into the 
final with a 45-26 victory over Poland in the smeifinals while Romania 
reached the gold-medal showdown by defeating Russia 45-31.
