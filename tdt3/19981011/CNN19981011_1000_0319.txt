Sinn Fein leader Gerry Adams says northern Ireland needs U.S. support 
to achieve peace. The leader of the political wing of the Irish republican 
army is on an eight-day U.S. fund-raising tour. A peace treaty was 
signed in April. But the formation of a multiparty administration 
in the province is in jeopardy. Adams and Ulster unionist leader David 
trimble can't agree on whether the IRA should begin disarming before 
Sinn Fein can join the administration.
