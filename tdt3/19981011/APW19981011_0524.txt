John Fitzgerald used drop shots and Pretoria's high altitude to his 
advantage at the MTN Champions Sunday as he defeated Bjorn Borg 7-5, 
6-3 to capture his first singles title on the seniors tour. The Australian, 
better known for his doubles prowess, said he was delighted just to 
share a court with Borg. ``He still has such a presence and he's done 
so much for the tour as well,'' Fitzgerald said. Earlier in the tournament, 
Fitzgerald ousted top seed Henri Leconte of France in the first round 
and 1996 champion Yannick Noah of France in the semifinals. ``The 
altitude and the fast surface suits him,'' Borg said of Fitzgerald. 
``He's been here 10 times, so he must like to play here.'' Borg has 
failed to win a title in his four visits to South Africa. Fitzgerald 
then teamed with South African Kevin Curren to win the doubles title, 
defeating the Swedish pair of Borg and Mats Wilander 7-5, 7-5.
