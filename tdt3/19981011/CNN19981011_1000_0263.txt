High-tech companies in the U.S. apparently won't be adding larger 
numbers of skilled immigrants to their payrolls this year, thanks 
to senator Tom Harkin of Iowa. He's blocking action on a Bill to raise 
the number of "skilled worker" visas from 65,000 a year to more than 
115,000 for the next two years. Harkin and other opponents claim high-tech 
companies have an ulterior motive for wanting the Bill -- to replace 
U.S. workers with lower-wage immigrants.
