The only U.S. captain ever court-martialed for losing a ship in wartime 
is in line for a posthumous pardon thanks to the efforts of a 12-year-old 
boy. Hunter Scott of Pensacola, Florida, researched the 1945 sinking 
of the "USS Indianapolis" for a history project and has concluded 
rear admiral Charles B. McVay, the third, didn't know his ship was 
in immediate danger. Therefore, he isn't guilty of negligence. More 
than 800 people died when the ship sank. McVay committed suicide in 
1968. A congressman has now introduced a Bill to clear McVay of his 
court-martial.
