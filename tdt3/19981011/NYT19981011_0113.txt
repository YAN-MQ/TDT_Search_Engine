The annual conferences and meetings of the advertising industry trade 
associations are almost always like Kabuki or No theater _ highly 
stylized, ritualized events carefully choreographed on the theory 
that, to quote the old ad slogan, the best surprise is no surprise. 
So it was startling when officials at the 89th annual conference of 
the Association of National Advertisers, held here at the Ritz-Carlton 
Hotel this weekend, sharply deviated from the familiar patterns with 
unexpected news: They would for the first time open their membership 
to regional and national agencies that create all types of advertising. 
``These agencies represent brand marketers' most important partners 
in building brand equity,'' John Sarsen Jr., president and chief executive 
of the association, said at the general session on Friday. ``Together, 
major marketers and major marketing communications agencies can build 
the most powerful, resourceful, effective brand-building association 
in the world.'' The decision to add as full members agencies that 
produce advertising from television commercials and Web site banners 
to ethnic campaigns and direct mail galvanized attendees, quickly 
overshadowing the entire agenda of the meeting. They spoke of virtually 
nothing else before and after the three daily general sessions and 
during receptions and meals. One reason the decision so dominated 
the conference was because it pointed up a rift between the association 
and its counterpart trade organization for Madison Avenue, the American 
Association of Advertising Agencies. Three top officers of the agency 
association, who were here attending the advertiser meeting, said 
they knew nothing about the decision until moments before Sarsen announced 
it. The three executives tried to put the best face they could on 
the decision. ``Any initiative that will allow agencies to get closer 
to clients is welcomed by the AAAA,'' said O. Burtch Drake, president 
and chief executive of the agency association. ``What agency doesn't 
want a chance to sit down with clients?'' But Drake and his colleagues 
expressed dismay and concern at being kept in the dark about such 
a significant change, which could have profound implications for agencies 
and the agency association. ``There is a courtesy that exists in the 
trade association business,'' Drake said. ``You give someone a heads-up 
regardless of the issue.'' For instance, the advertiser association 
will not require its prospective agency members to also be members 
of the agency association _ meaning they could cancel memberships 
in one as they join the other. ``We have to take what appears to be 
a problem and make it an opportunity,'' said Michael Donahue, executive 
vice president of the agency association. The decision to alter the 
membership rules, which was approved unanimously by the board of the 
advertiser association and ratified unanimously by the full membership, 
marked the second aggressive effort in a year to seek income where 
in the past there had been only outgo. At the 1997 conference, the 
advertiser association began selling sponsorships of the general sessions, 
at an estimated $100,000 each, to the media companies from which advertisers 
buy commercial time and ad space. That highly unusual practice, which 
continued here this year, prompted grumbling from many attendees about 
sitting through thinly veiled sales pitches. Now, the agencies to 
which advertisers pay commissions and fees are being asked to pay 
the advertiser association's membership dues, to be calculated on 
a sliding scale based on billings or income. But the decision to admit 
agencies as members ``is not revenue-driven,'' said John Costello, 
the 1998-99 chairman of the advertiser association who is also senior 
executive vice president and general marketing manager at Sears, Roebuck 
&AMP; Co. Rather, he added, because ``our mission is to focus on brand-building,'' 
it made sense to reach out to ``our closest business-building partners, 
the advertising agencies.'' Sarsen and Costello said that many details 
were still to be worked out, including exactly what the range of agency 
membership dues would be or even how many ad agencies were expected 
to sign up. But asked whether media companies would now be considered 
for membership as well, Sarsen replied that the agencies were ``right 
at the top of the list,'' and the media, which he referred to as ``delivery 
vehicles,'' were ``at the bottom of the list.'' Drake had a caustic 
response to that. ``Why not include the media?'' he asked. ``They've 
already sold the meeting to them.'' At a briefing after the general 
session, Sarsen and Costello defended their decision not to discuss 
the change with the agency association officers until after its approval. 
``We felt an obligation to talk to our members and board first,'' 
Costello said. But he added that ``we did talk to some selected friends 
to get their input and guidance.'' One such friend was Shelly Lazarus, 
chairwoman and chief executive of the Ogilvy &AMP; Mather Worldwide 
unit of WPP Group in New York. A supportive quotation from Ms. Lazarus, 
the 1998-99 vice chairwoman of the agency association, was displayed 
on a large screen as Sarsen announced the decision. The statement 
quoted her as calling the decision ``a good first step'' that ``begins 
an important dialogue.'' Pressed to explain why Ms. Lazarus was consulted 
when other top agency association leaders were not, Sarsen said that 
the criterion was to talk to agency executives that ``someone was 
pretty close to.'' Indeed, Ms. Lazarus works closely with Costello 
because Ogilvy is a main agency of Sears. That relationship raises 
an issue: Will agency executives feel obligated to join the advertiser 
association to satisfy or mollify clients? ``It's hard to say no,'' 
Drake asserted. ``It's like getting a call from a client saying: `I'm 
being honored at the Waldorf. Would you like to take a table?' Agencies 
take a table.'' F. Stone Roberts, chairman and chief executive of 
Gotham Inc., an agency in New York owned by Interpublic Group of Cos., 
said: ``There's no question agencies will join the ANA. We're going 
to follow the money.'' Patrick McGrath, the 1998-99 chairman of the 
agency association, said that he did not view the decision ``as any 
kind of a threat'' to agencies. ``They put out their hands and said, 
`Come join us in helping build our brands,''' said McGrath, who is 
also chairman and chief executive of Jordan McGrath Case &AMP; Partners 
in New York. ``It's a real plus for agencies.'' ``I wouldn't have 
felt so good if, for instance, they wanted management consultants,'' 
he added. That was a reference to the fears among agencies that consultants 
are usurping their role in developing brand-building advertising for 
clients. ``It looks like the ANA is looking for free branding advice,'' 
said Tom Messner, partner at Messner Vetere Berger McNamee Schmetterer 
Euro RSCG, a unit of Havas Advertising in New York. ``I don't see 
the point'' in joining the advertiser association, he added. ``I don't 
think it makes sense unless they have some good health insurance plan.'' 
Messner's viewpoint seemed to be in the minority. ``There's no doubt 
I would join,'' said Mary Lou Quinlan, chief executive at N.W. Ayer 
&AMP; Partners, a unit of MacManus Group in New York. ``But we'll 
have to appreciate the opportunity,'' she added, ``and give the advertisers 
time for peer networking among themselves. Otherwise, it'll be everybody 
on the hunt and the advertisers will say, `Is this what I signed on 
for?''' David Ropes, director for corporate advertising and integrated 
marketing at Ford Motor Co., agreed. ``We don't want to lose the ability 
to get together and talk about our mutual interests,'' he said of 
the advertisers. ``We want to incentivize agencies to become full 
marketing partners. But the intention is not to turn this into a meeting 
for a thousand people.''
