At a conference on heart disease in Washington, participants are talking 
about the advances taking place in cancer research. Louise Schiavone 
explains why. Dr. judah Folkman -- the Harvard researcher whose cancer 
studies drew international attention this year -- now foresees a day 
when many would-be heart surgeries are replaced by sophisticated drug 
therapies. It is an exciting time in cardiology as it begins to link 
up with angiogenesis research. Angiogenesis is a process in which 
blood vessels grow and is directly linked to the growth of tumors. 
His early laboratory success with a new class of drugs which control 
that process -- drugs called "angiogenesis inhibitors" -- show it 
is possible to reduce or eliminate cancerous tumors in mice and potentially 
in people. Researchers are now applying angiogenesis inhibitors to 
mice with blocked blood vessels with the goal of reversing the buildup 
and presence of plaque. We decided to investigate this question in 
our lab and the hypothesis was simply rewritten. "Is plaque growth 
angiogenesis dependent? yes or no?" Like tumor growth is angiogenesis 
dependent." Scientists have found a 70% to 85% reduction in plaque 
buildup in mice like these treated with angiogenesis inhibitors. Doctors 
already know the opposite effect using angiogenesis can help grow 
new blood vessels to relieve those that are blocked. Dr. Folkman now 
believes the combination of the two could be a powerful development 
when applied to humans. These therapies, he says -- Might, in fact, 
displace coronary bypass surgery, much like gastric surgery for bleeding 
ulcers was displaced by the introduction of the H-2 blockers. Dr. 
Folkman and other scientists don't know how long it will take to get 
to that point. In the United States, more than 250,000 people undergo 
heart bypass surgery every year. Because of the risks involved, in 
surgery, doctors are excited about the potential offered by these 
new drug-based alternatives to bypass. Louise Schiavone, CNN. Washington.
