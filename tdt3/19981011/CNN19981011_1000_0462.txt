You soon could be hearing about a new type of pollution with a new 
kind of threat. Environmentalists are calling it "smart pollution" 
-- bugs, plants and animals that are carried across borders, intentionally 
or by accident. A new species can evolve quickly to dominate and sometimes 
destroy native plants and animals. Threats range from the familiar 
landscape-smothering kudzu vines to bloodthirsty Asian Tiger mosquitoes.
