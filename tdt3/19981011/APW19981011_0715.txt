Indian communists on Sunday called for nationwide protests against 
the ruling Bharatiya Janata Party, saying its economic policies were 
causing price increases. At a rally ending a seven-day congress of 
the Communist Party of India (Marxist), party leaders urged Indians 
to join in planned nationwide strikes, said Jyoti Basu, chief minister 
of West Bengal state. West Bengal, whose capital city is Calcutta, 
is ruled by the Communist Party. The party says the BJP is mismanaging 
the economy, causing price increases.
