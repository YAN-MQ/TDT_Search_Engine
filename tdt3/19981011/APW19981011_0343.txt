Oscar Camenzind of Switzerland won the men's elite road race Sunday 
at the World Cycling Championships breaking away in the final lap 
of 258-kilometer (162-mile) race. Peter Van Petegem of Belgium took 
second ahead of Michele Bartoli of Italy. American Lance Armstrong, 
taking part in his first World Championships since undergoing successful 
cancer treatment, came in fourth to add to his fourth in the time 
trial. The race in southern Netherlands came down to the final two 
laps of the 17.2-kilometer (10.7-mile) circuit. Armstrong, Camenzind, 
Niki Aebersold of Switzerland and Michael Boogerd of the Netherlands 
broke away up the Cauberg climb and were soon joined by Bartoli and 
Van Petegem. The six stayed together until less than a lap to go when 
Camenzind made a breakaway. Bartoli and Van Petegem gave chase. At 
the bottom of the Cauberg hill, Camenzind led by seven seconds over 
the Bartoli and Van Petegem with the Armstrong trio about 27 seconds 
back. Entering the final flat section of about two kilometers (1.25 
miles), Camenzind, a 27-year-old from Steinen, Switzerland, had stretched 
his advantage, winning by 23 seconds over Van Petegem. Camenzind's 
winning time was 6 hours, 1 minute, 29 seconds. Armstrong won the 
sprint for fourth, 68 seconds behind. Aebersold was fifth with Boogerd 
sixth. Armstrong won the worlds in 1993. At this time last year he 
was slowly returning to riding after chemotherapy and an operation 
had put the cancer into remission. Spain's Abraham Olano, who won 
Thursday's time trial and was the 1995 road champion did not start 
with a knee problem. The last three Tour de France winners -- Marco 
Pantani, Jan Ullrich and Bjarne Riis also did not participate. Last 
year's road champion, Laurent Brochard and the top-ranked cyclist 
according to UCI ratings, Laurent Jalabert, also did not compete due 
to the fallout of the Tour de France doping scandal. The championships 
concluded with the Netherlands' Leontien van Moorsel taking a gold 
and silver medal in the elite women's races in a comeback from weight 
problems. Diana Ziliute of Lithuania took the women's road race.
