In Washington, President Clinton will spend the rest of the weekend 
working on the budget. He will meet with his budget team and top congressional 
democrats to try to resolve disputes with republicans. Budget talks 
are stalled because of differences over Mr. Clinton's education proposal. 
Carl Rochelle reports. For second time in two weeks I signed legislation 
to keep your government running. But I can't keep granting extensions 
indefinitely. Mr. Clinton said his budget negotiators to Capitol Hill 
to work with lawmakers. Later his chief of staff reported progress 
in some areas, but still more work ahead. As badly as these fellows 
want to go home and begin their campaigns, they're going to have to 
stay and complete their work. One of the areas where they have the 
work to do is in education. Bowls says negotiations are deadlocked 
over the president's proposals to modernize the nation's schools and 
make classes smaller by adding more teachers. Republicans accuse the 
White House of misrepresenting what's really going on in the negotiations, 
saying it's the administration that's holding things up. Once the 
administration ever gets serious about concluding the negotiations, 
we'll get it done. For some reason, we can't bring it to a conclusion. 
Despite all the tough talk, both sides say privately they are unwilling 
to take the politically risky move of shutting down the government 
to make their point. And for the Clinton administration the public 
debate over the budget Bill has had the effect of pushing discussion 
over impeachment proceedings out of the headlines, at least until 
after the Columbus day weekend. Karl Rochelle, CNN, the White House.
