New York's police commissioner has fired an officer who rode on a 
labor day parade float that mocked black people. The officer was suspended 
shortly after he wore blackface and threw watermelon during the parade. 
After the suspension, he filed a lawsuit demanding the NYPD give him 
his job back. The New York civil liberties union says the officer 
was illegally suspended for exercising his free speech rights.
