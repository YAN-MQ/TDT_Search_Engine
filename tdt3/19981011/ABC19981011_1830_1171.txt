This week at the White House, President Clinton will announce new 
initiatives to protect children from violence at school. Since the 
high profile shootings last year, many schools are already acting 
on their own. ABC's Ron Claiborne reports from munster, Indiana. Like 
most students, those at Harrison high are used to fire and tornado 
drills. Now, they also prepare for a different kind of emergency. 
We are now conducting a security drill. Teachers are to keep students 
in the classroom and lock the doors. This is how Harrison high plans 
to react if a gunman were to go on a rampage. We want to be ready 
just as we want to be ready when a tornado comes. We want our children 
to know what to do. In the wake of last year's school shootings, Indiana 
and seven other states have ordered their schools to come up with 
comprehensive security plans. Many campuses have imposed tough new 
safety measures. On the ground. In some cities, police practice rescuing 
students during an assault. Hand held metal detectors are used to 
check for weapons. Some school districts now require see-through backpacks. 
Security cameras have been placed in hallways and classrooms. And 
there are hot lines so students can anonymously report overheard threats. 
Threats need to be treated seriously. So across the country, school 
administrators are attending security seminars where they're taught 
to think like an intruder. How would I do this if I wanted to do this? 
What would I do and where would I do it? It used to be something that 
we didn't worry about. It was like, "oh, we live in Indiana, nothing's 
ever gonna happen here." But now, it's, "oh, my gosh, that happened 
in Kentucky. It could happen any day, at any place." School officials 
concede that some security measures are intrusive, even frightening. 
But as one principal said, "I'd rather apologize for the precautions 
than apologize for not having been prepared." Ron Claiborne, ABC News 
munster, Indiana.
