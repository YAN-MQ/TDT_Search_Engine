An earthquake with a magnitude of 4.7 struck eastern Taiwan at noon 
Sunday, rocking a fishing port but causing no injuries or damage. 
The quake's epicenter was located 6.8 kilometers (4.2 miles) south 
of the city of Hualien, 110 kilometers (68 miles) southeast of Taipei, 
the Central Weather Bureau reported. The quake was felt most strongly 
in the fishing port of Nanao just north in neighboring Ilan county, 
and in Hualien and Chengkung, a coastal town in southeastern Taitung 
county, the bureau said. Taiwan is frequently struck by small magnitude 
earthquakes, and five people were killed in the mountains near Chiayi, 
200 kilometers (124 miles) south of Taipei, in the aftermath of a 
6.2 magnitude quake in July.
