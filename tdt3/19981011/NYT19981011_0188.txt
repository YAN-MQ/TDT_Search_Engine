This is the kind of place where they just call him Al. If a politician 
needed a respite from the scandal in Washington, it could be found 
here Sunday afternoon, at the Gore family barbecue, where nearly everyone, 
it seemed, was related to Vice President Al Gore, knew him personally 
or knew a close member of his family. ``I campaigned with Al the first 
day he ran for Congress,'' said Mark Farrar, a cattleman who recalled 
offering his home in Shelbyville to Gore that night in 1976. ``While 
we were getting ready to go out, he sat there on the couch and fed 
my daughter her bottle.'' Her name, by the way, is Mary Elizabeth, 
which is the given name of Gore's wife, Tipper. But Farrar said that 
was just a coincidence. Coincidence or not, a visit to his home state 
and the daylong celebration in a horse-showing arena seemed to give 
Gore a break from worries foreign, domestic and personal, three weeks 
before midterm elections that are now laden with extra meaning because 
of impeachment proceedings in Congress. Even his mild Southern accent 
took on an added degree of twang. Gore, the son of a former senator, 
Albert Gore, is a presidential aspirant in 2000 and has been campaigning 
around the country virtually nonstop in recent months. According to 
the White House's political strategy, Gore is primarily responsible 
for generating support for House candidates in the Democratic Party's 
effort to keep the electoral cost of the Monica Lewinsky scandal to 
a minimum. The schedule for Sunday called for a visit to a district 
where Democrats are fighting to regain a seat they lost in 1994. Dressed 
in a plaid shirt, khaki slacks and black cowboy boots, Gore pressed 
the idea at a fund-raising event before the barbecue. He addressed 
a crowd of about 100 people, who contributed some $50,000 to the campaign 
of Jerry Cooper, a Democratic state legislator who is trying to unseat 
Van Hilleary, a two-term Republican. Gore said a victory for Cooper 
would help Democrats pick up the 11 seats they need ``to kick Newt 
Gingrich out of that speaker's chair.'' As he normally does, Gore 
avoided any direct reference to President Clinton's problems other 
than a few swipes at the Republican majority in Congress, whose actions 
against Clinton he said reflect ``an extremist ideology that is not 
supported by the American people.'' But the main business of the day 
followed, in the arena next door, where Gore wandered among 4,000 
people for several hours, signing autographs, posing for pictures 
and chatting with families. Later, he went on stage for a speech and 
a few verses of ``I Saw the Light'' with a local country-and-western 
band. While it was fundamental retail politics, it was a highly unusual 
setting for Gore in that almost all his public appearances are rigidly 
scripted, with tight crowd control. Here, he stood in the middle of 
a throng of people, moving slowly about, twisting and turning to greet 
people approaching from all sides. Most just wanted to have a picture 
snapped, but others had messages to deliver. Some had buttons that 
said ``Gore 2000,'' and some had signs that said ``I adore Gore.'' 
Bonnie Dixon, 46, a high school teacher, nudged her way to the front 
with her 9-year-old son, Jason, who was wearing a T-shirt that said 
``Preserve Our Prairies.'' ``He wore it just for you,'' Ms. Dixon 
told the vice president, who has made protecting the environment one 
of his major issues. Ricky Forsythe, 31, a house mover from Bell Buckle, 
Tenn., threw an arm around the vice president and placed his head 
on his shoulder so they could pray. Gore obliged. ``I told him I pray 
for him and Bill Clinton, too,'' Forsythe said. In a crowd with so 
many Gore supporters, including his mother, Pauline, and his oldest 
daughter, Karenna, it was hard to find anyone who thought the president 
ought to resign or be impeached. Paul Dentici, 73, a retired city 
official in Nashville and a Navy veteran, offered a response typical 
of voters here who are trying to balance Clinton's predicament with 
the interests of the country. ``I don't want to hear about the president's 
problems anymore,'' he said. ``The whole country is disgusted with 
it.'' But for Najanna Coleman, a bank executive in Milan, Tenn., who 
served as a campaign volunteer for Gore when he ran for president 
in 1988, one problem lingers. She said she worries that Clinton's 
problems might somehow harm Gore in his bid to succeed the president. 
``He's my man,'' Ms. Coleman said of the vice president. ``I'm sure 
it could have some effect, but people are tired of hearing about the 
situation in Washington. It's time to move on, and Al can take us 
where we need to go.''
