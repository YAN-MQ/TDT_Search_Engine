With President Clinton distracted and besieged and his moral authority 
questioned after an affair with Monica Lewinsky, there is much room 
for America's allies, its Congress and even its energy companies to 
ignore, deflect or defy his will. The president has been forced to 
drag NATO closer and closer to the brink of bombing Serbia, an outcome 
no one wants, to have President Slobodan Milosevic of Yugoslavia take 
Washington seriously. In the midst of a global economic crisis, Clinton 
was negotiating down to the wire this weekend with congressional Republicans 
to fulfill American financial obligations to the International Monetary 
Fund and the United Nations, organizations that Washington insists 
on trying to lead even though it will not pay its bills to them. Clinton 
appears to have lost his two-year campaign to persuade major oil companies 
to build a pipeline from the Caspian Sea through Turkey, even though 
he had declared it an American strategic priority. And this week, 
in what Clinton will hail as a foreign-policy triumph, he is expected 
to preside over an interim Israeli-Palestinian agreement that is coming 
so late, and is being accomplished so grudgingly, that both sides 
fear that it will fall apart a few weeks after it is signed. ``Sometimes 
moments of truth arrive,'' David Calleo of the Johns Hopkins School 
of Advanced International Studies said. ``It's hard to distinguish 
between a lack of credibility that comes from the discrediting of 
an individual president and that coming from a certain accretion of 
realism. The administration has been trying to make water run uphill 
and make policy by declaration. But both the president and the policies 
are running out of gas.'' Examples abound of how it is simply easier 
to say ``no'' to a wounded president, to delay, prevaricate or even 
reject his declared policies. In the case of the Caspian pipeline, 
the oil companies argued that at today's petroleum prices the multibillion-dollar 
project made no economic sense. But a stronger or more focused president 
might have made a persuasive case, perhaps directly to the public, 
that the pipeline was not about transporting oil today, but about 
America's energy security and its political influence well into the 
next century. And such a president might have organized the financial 
resources required to make it happen. This president's commitment 
to foreign policy has always been secondary. Clinton has rarely shown 
much boldness or even the willingness to punish those like Milosevic, 
Saddam Hussein of Iraq or even Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu of 
Israel who taunt and defy him. That is especially true with Israel, 
because White House punishment of Israel threatens core Democratic 
Party constituencies. In dealing with the Caucasus region and the 
Middle East, Calleo said, ``the world doesn't see much leadership 
of a sustained positive kind.'' The Middle East encompasses issues 
other than the Israeli-Palestinian relationship, ``and to be on the 
outs with both Iraq and Iran at the same time isn't much of a strategy, 
and yet it just goes on and on,'' he said. In the Balkans the American 
effort to re-create a kind of multiethnic Hapsburg empire is too ambitious, 
but would certainly require lots of troops on the ground in Kosovo. 
``We have these policies but don't want to pay the price to sustain 
them, and everyone knows it,'' Calleo said. ``If you can't or won't 
follow through on your threats, it's not much good to make them.'' 
Sen. John McCain, R-Ariz., bluntly said Sunday in a discussion of 
Kosovo on ``Fox News Sunday,'' ``I think we have been diverted by 
the Lewinsky matter. There is still no long-term plan, a good description 
of what our objectives are.'' McCain added about Clinton: ``He is 
putting our young people in danger. Any president must go to the American 
people and explain what is going on.'' Of course, to order a bombing 
campaign because of the Kosovo crisis would be a failure of American 
and NATO policy, which is to threaten Milosevic into meeting some 
set of American objectives. But bombing would only make it harder 
to stave off a humanitarian disaster among the nearly 300,000 ethnic 
Albanian refugees and make it more likely that NATO ground troops 
would have to be introduced, senior administration officials concede. 
``NATO knows this, but Milosevic knows it, too,'' one senior American 
official said, speaking on condition of anonymity. ``Add that to Lewinsky 
and you get a real credibility problem.'' Robert Kagan, of the Carnegie 
Endowment, says that the lack of American decisiveness inevitably 
produces an unwillingness of other countries and actors to follow. 
``It would be simple to say that because of Lewinsky this president 
is distracted,'' Kagan said. ``But the problem of credibility transcends 
the Lewinsky affair, though it only exacerbates the problems.'' The 
matter is especially acute in an altering world of economic crisis 
where bilateral policies are less important than multilateral ones, 
``when we really do need some concentrated leadership of an unusual 
kind.'' International indecisiveness in NATO, the United Nations and 
global financial institutions starts with American indecisiveness, 
Kagan said. ``You have a Cabinet secretary'' _ such as Secretary of 
State Madeleine Albright _ ``issuing threats while it is soon clear 
that the administration will not follow through,'' he said, whether 
the topic is the Middle East or Kosovo. ``You have the secretary of 
defense,'' William Cohen, ``speaking for the Joint Chiefs of Staff, 
and they don't want to go into Kosovo.'' And Clinton ``doesn't have 
the moral authority to order them to go on the one hand, or provide 
them the budget that makes it easier for them to go.'' He described 
the situation as ``a simple paradox: If it were clearer that we were 
prepared to take action, it would be easier for others to get on board.'' 
For Richard Haass, foreign policy director for the Brookings Institution, 
Clinton's ``unwillingness to level with Congress and the American 
people over Bosnia has a bad aftertaste'' and resonates with negative 
implications for Kosovo, Haass said, where ``we've dithered for months.'' 
There are similar gaps between rhetoric and action over Iraq, Haass 
said. He compared Clinton's statements in February when he talked 
of going to war over access for arms inspectors to the administration's 
willingness now to let the United Nations solve the problem. ``They 
blinked in February,'' Haass said, ``and now we're reluctant to bring 
the crisis to a head.'' In general, he said, ``We've allowed matters 
to drift in the Middle East, and Clinton has lost respect. He hasn't 
been willing to blow the whistle or speak the truth publicly. ``The 
cumulative effect is that this is an administration that friends and 
foes alike can ignore,'' Haass said. ``That is dangerous.''
