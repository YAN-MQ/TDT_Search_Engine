Let's figure what went wrong for Kansas City and what went right for 
New England in a 40-10 Patriots rout here Sunday afternoon. It was 
a victory that left 59,749 fans at Foxboro Stadium giddy over what 
this means in the long run for the home team. The Patriots scored 
first on a 1-yard touchdown run by rookie running back Robert Edwards 
with 4 minutes 53 seconds left in the first quarter. Two Chiefs penalties 
contributed to the 40-yard drive. And then later in the quarter Kansas 
City tried a fourth-and-1 run near midfield that lost a yard. Those 
were things that went wrong for the Chiefs. Seldom have Coach Marty 
Schottenheimer's Chiefs been thrashed so thoroughly. ``A lot went 
wrong and we have to be held accountable for it,'' Schottenheimer 
said. ``I mean, we can't blame it on the stars.'' New England's Adam 
Vinatieri hit a 32-yard field goal in the second quarter and then 
appeared to have another one, from 37 yards. But Donnie Edwards was 
penalized for delay of game, for flinching and waving illegally before 
the kick, and New England received a first down at the Kansas City 
15 instead of the field goal. And the Patriots took that second chance 
and scored on Drew Bledsoe's 15-yard touchdown pass to Robert Edwards 
to make it 17-0 with 9:11 left before halftime. Minutes later, the 
Chiefs roughed the punter and gave the Patriots another chance and 
the Patriots scored another touchdown instead of ending their series 
with a punt, and it was 24-0 with 2:48 left before halftime. It was 
27-0 at halftime. Those were some of the things that went right for 
New England. Kansas City scored its only touchdown with 52 seconds 
left in the third quarter. By then, New England had scored the game's 
first 37 points. Throughout the game, little went right for Kansas 
City (4-2) and little went wrong for New England (4-1). The Chiefs 
played as if their bodies were here but their minds were back in Kansas 
City. A mental funk. The Patriots sensed their vulnerability and pounded 
them mercilessly. ``We played a lousy game in their house,'' linebacker 
Derrick Thomas said. ``There were a lot of problems but we have a 
lot of people with pride. We'll get 'em back.'' Receiver Andre Rison 
said payback was not the issue, but improvement was. ``They did look 
good,'' he said. ``Any time this happens you have to realize where 
you are. We have 10 games left. The future is the focus.'' And what 
about the Patriots? What does their future hold? Are they so good 
that they can whip a good team like the Chiefs? Do they have that 
kind of killer instinct? Is Bledsoe (17 for 26 for 226 yards and 3 
touchdowns) reaching a new level, a new plateau of expertise? Is Edwards 
(23 rushes for 104 yards; 3 receptions for 32 yards) rising to become 
the running back who was so good last year at Georgia? Are the Patriots 
Super Bowl material? A 40-10 victory over Kansas City makes people 
ask those kind of questions, even with the season less than half over. 
``We are not in shock,'' said Patriots safety Willie Clay., They certainly 
did not expect to beat Kansas City by 30 points. But afterward, they 
acted like they had. ``We beat them in every phase of the game,'' 
said Patriots cornerback Ty Law. ``They like to bump-and-run and press 
on receivers. We took advantage of that. They challenged us on fourth 
downs. Our defense took care of that. Really early, our front lines 
hammered them. That kind of took their breath away for the rest of 
the day.'' The numbers were stunning. New England led in first downs, 
31-9. In total yards, 438-134. In plays, 82-44. And there were 54 
New England rushing plays. That makes for a long, long day for the 
Kansas City defense. New England dominated in rushing yards, 206-14. 
It dominated in possession time, 41:48-18:12. The Patriots earned 
four sacks, a fumble recovery and an interception. Stunning. ``We 
had a lot of things go right,'' said Patriots Coach Pete Carroll. 
``When it happens like that, how can you go wrong?''
