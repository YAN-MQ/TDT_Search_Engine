A federal grand jury reportedly will hear evidence this month in the 
case of a 1963 Alabama church bombing that killed four African-American 
girls. A Mississippi newspaper reports the FBI says the grand jury 
will be used to find evidence. A jury convicted a Ku Klux klansman 
on state murder charges in the case in 1977, who eventually died in 
prison. Investigators say they believe he did not act alone. The FBI 
reopened the investigation last year.
