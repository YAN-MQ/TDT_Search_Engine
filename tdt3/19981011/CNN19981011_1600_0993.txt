NASA is working on ways to bring the high cost of space travel down 
to earth. Allard beutel looks at one initiative. The most expensive 
part of getting any spacecraft into orbit is the first few seconds 
-- getting off the ground. So of course, NASA is working on cheaper 
alternatives to the current method that involves large Rockets that 
blast off a launch pad. Enter magnetic levitation. Several companies 
and Britain's University of sussex are developing this technology 
with NASA. The idea is -- high-powered magnets would drive a spacecraft 
down a two to five-mile-long track. The craft would catapult from 
the ground at about 600 miles an hour. Then it would use a conventional 
rocket engine to reach orbit. NASA says the system could be reset 
to do it all again just 0 minutes later. Researchers say a spacecraft 
being launched on a maglev system is like a log being swept downstream 
by a river's current. When the spacecraft is launched on the magnetic 
field, the two river banks keep guided to keep it guided and straight, 
and then the magnetic field also levitates the spacecraft. So we have 
three distinct magnetic operations -- lift, thrust and guidance. NASA 
hopes to be able use a maglev launcher to put small communication 
satellites in orbit by the year 2007. Allard beutel, "Headline News."
