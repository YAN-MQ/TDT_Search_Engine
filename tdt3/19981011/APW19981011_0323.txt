Under the towering marble figures of the Jews who founded his church, 
Pope John Paul II on Sunday decreed the first Jewish-born saint of 
the modern era: Edith Stein, a nun killed in the gas chambers of Auschwitz. 
Every year, he told Catholics, her saint's day must also serve as 
a commemoration of all the Holocaust's murdered Jews. ``The value 
of her testimony is to render ever more solid the bridge of mutual 
understanding between Christians and Jews,'' he said. ``In the martyr, 
Sister Teresa Benedicta of the Cross, so many differences meet and 
are resolved in peace,'' John Paul, using the name Stein chose in 
the church, told the thousands filling St. Peter's Square. It was 
a day filled with remarkable gestures of reconciliation: The Roman 
Catholic Church exercising all its ceremony, pomp and grandeur in 
tribute to people of the Jewish faith. Looking on were members of 
Stein's family, sharing a stage with German Chancellor Helmut Kohl.
