Egyptian Foreign Minister Amr Moussa will go to Turkey on Monday in 
Egypt's latest attempt to calm a crisis between Syria and Turkey over 
Kurdish rebels. Moussa is expected to relay a message from Syrian 
President Hafez Assad to Turkish President Suleyman Demirel, Egypt's 
Al-Ahram newspaper reported Sunday. Its contents were not disclosed. 
Moussa will later fly to Damascus to relay to Assad the Turkish response, 
Egypt's Middle East News Agency reported. Tunisian Foreign Minister 
Said Bin Mustafa arrived in Damascus on Sunday and also is expected 
to meet Assad Monday. Turkey has demanded that Syria end its support 
for Kurdish rebels, expel a Kurdish leader and close Kurdish rebel 
camps in Syrian-controlled Lebanon. If Syria refuses, Turkey has threatened 
to attack its southern neighbor. Syria denies sheltering the rebels.
