Voters in this southernmost county went to the polls Sunday in elections 
that are likely to test President Franjo Tudjman's ruling party. More 
than 100,000 residents are eligible to cast ballots in over 240 polling 
stations. Independent polls predict that Tudjman's ruling party, the 
Croatian Democratic Union, or HDZ, will be unseated in the county 
by a united block consisting of five opposition parties, the Social 
Democrats, Social Liberals, Liberals, Peasant party and an Istrian 
regional party. Elections were re-called in the county because no 
party was able to establish a commanding role in the 40 seat house 
following nationwide municipal elections in April. Support for Tudjman's 
party, which currently holds a majority in 19 of 21 counties, has 
been steadily deteriorating in recent months, rocked by a series of 
financial scandals and a splintering rift within its ranks. The region, 
centred around the resort town of Dubrovnik, is a tourist mecca still 
struggling to reconstruct itself following heavy destruction in Croatia's 
1991 war with rebel minority Serbs. In a bid to boost his party's 
sagging chances, Tudjman visited the ancient city on Friday to open 
works on a new bridge and tour war damaged villages. The elections 
for control of wider Dubrovnik are expected to be a major litmus test 
for HDZ ahead of parliamentary elections scheduled late next year. 
Voting began at 0700 and will end at 7 p.m. (1700 gmt). Preliminary 
results are expected by Monday evening.
