The maker of the anti-impotence drug Viagra has been criticized in 
a British newspaper for conducting experiments on dogs. A spokesman 
for Pfizer says it was necessary to test Viagra on dogs so it could 
get a product license. The "Sunday mirror" reported today beagles 
were drugged unconscious and underwent gruesome surgery. Pfizer says 
the dogs received a general anesthetic and felt nothing during surgery.
