Romania will let NATO use its airspace in emergency situations if 
the alliance launches airstrikes against Yugoslavia, the president's 
office announced Sunday. ``We agree to NATO access in emergency and 
unpredictable situations,'' read a statement from the office of President 
Emil Constantinescu. The country's Supreme Defense Council met earlier 
Sunday to consider NATO's request. The council also decided in its 
four-hour meeting that Romania's army would not participate in any 
NATO military action against neighboring Yugoslavia. NATO is considering 
airstrikes to force Yugoslavian President Slobodan Milosevic to agree 
end a crackdown against ethnic Albanians in the Kosovo province. ``Romania 
cannot afford direct participation in fighting actions if these actions 
take place,'' the statement said. Romania supports a peaceful solution 
to the situation in the Serbian province, it said. The council also 
decided to reinforce the army, signaling it was worried that the deteriorating 
crisis in Kosovo ``might generate risks and threats to Romania's national 
security.'' Romania is anxious to join NATO, but Yugoslav officials 
have warned neighboring countries against being drawn into the crisis.
