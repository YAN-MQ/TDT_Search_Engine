The book "Lolita" has ruffled many a feather, with charges author 
Vladimir nabokov turned a 12-year-old girl into a sex object. Now 
a retold version of the story, called "Lo's diary," has angered nabokov's 
family. An Italian woman's new book parodies the story, telling it 
from the child's point of view. A lawsuit calls Lo's diary a "rip-off" 
and seeks to ban its U.S. publication. The book's publisher says Lo's 
diary is "something new, with different characters."
