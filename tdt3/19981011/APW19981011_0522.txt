Kenyans swept the men's and women's titles at Chicago Marathon on 
Sunday, with Ondoro Osoro winning in the third-fastest time ever and 
Joyce Chepchumba capturing the women's division. Osoro, running in 
his first marathon, overtook defending champion Khalid Khannouchi 
in the last 1 1-2 kilometers (mile). He won in 2 hours, 6 minutes 
and 54 seconds, 49 seconds off the world record set last month in 
Berlin. Osoro's time set a Chicago Marathon record, topping the 2:07:10 
Khannouchi ran last year. Chepchumba, winner of the 1997 London Marathon, 
won in 2:23:57, a personal best. Chepchumba made up 21 seconds between 
the 34th and 35th kilometers (21st and 22nd miles) to pass Colleen 
DeReuck, the leader for most of the race. DeReuck finished well behind. 
Khannouchi, a Moroccan who lives in suburban New York, took the lead 
in the 34th kilometers (21st mile) and looked as if he was on his 
way to his second Chicago Marathon title. But Osoro kept gaining, 
finally overtaking him as they passed Soldier Field, about a kilometer 
(less than a mile) from the finish line. ``When we were approaching 
6 miles (9 1-2 kilometers) to go, one of the guys started to move,'' 
Osoro said. ``I had to stay behind and see how he ran. I had to keep 
going and I had to catch him.''
