Britain's Tim Henman overcame a third-set stumble to beat fourth-seed 
Andre Agassi 6-4, 6-3, 3-6, 6-4 on Sunday, winning the Swiss Indoors 
for his second title of the season and the fourth of his career. After 
successfully defending his Tashkent title last week, Henman needed 
two hours, 16 minutes Sunday for his 12th straight victory and his 
first consecutive titles on the ATP Tour. ``I played some of the best 
tennis of my career, the kind I only dreamed about,'' the sixth-seeded 
Henman said. ``The level was just so high and I was very consistent. 
``And to win in a final with a player of the highest pedigree like 
Agassi you have to put out some great tennis to win.'' The victory 
avenged his loss to Agassi 10 weeks ago, when the American beat out 
Henman for the title in Los Angeles at the Mercedes Cup in the pair's 
only other head-to-head meeting. ``He just rose above today and played 
deserving of the victory and I didn't,'' said Agassi, who reached 
the final without dropping a set. ``He made it happen. I was really 
impressed. ``Initially I wouldn't have categorized him with the best 
players in the world, but today he showed he's perhaps one of the 
strongest players on this surface. He kicked my butt.'' Eighth in 
ATP Tour World Championship standings, the victory solidified Henman's 
chances of a berth at the season-ending tournament in Hannover, Germany, 
next month. ``I hope this was an indication of things to come,'' Henman 
said. ``I know I can still improve and I believe I can go on to win 
more and bigger tournaments.'' With both players attacking the net 
and looking solid, it was Agassi who created the first break opportunity. 
But leading 0-30 at 3-3 on Henman's serve, Agassi blew his chance 
to jump ahead, squandering three break points and allowing Henman 
to win the next five. Leading 5-4, Henman broke Agassi, the American 
unable to save a second break point, with a wide shot costing him 
the set. Another wide shot cost Agassi his opening serve in the second, 
giving Henman a 2-0 lead. But the Briton squandered his advantage 
on his next service game, double-faulting twice to put Agassi back 
on serve. But a determined Henman, immediately broke back, then held 
to take the set. As Henman began to struggle with his serve in the 
third set, Agassi began to get back into the match, breaking to go 
4-2, then holding to take the set and keep his hopes alive. The pair 
traded breaks twice in the fourth set before the No. 1-ranked Briton 
took Agassi's serve at 5-4 to seal the title. ``I was up a break in 
the fourth and should have been able to hang on and turn the match 
around,'' said Agassi, whose match record fell to 57-13 this season. 
``In hindsight I should have been pleased that I got back into the 
match. But I could have shot myself if I'd had a gun, I was so angry 
with myself.'' Agassi, who won four titles this season, is currently 
fifth in the ATP Tour World Championahip standings. While a victory 
in the final would have virtually guaranteed him a berth at the World 
Championship, reaching the final has further cemented him among the 
top eight that will get invited to Hannover Reaching the final will 
also aid his climb back up the ATP Tour rankings. The American, who 
finished 122nd last year _ his lowest since turning pro in 1985 _ 
has risen to eighth. Going from No. 141 in November 1997 to No. 8, 
the 28-year-old American still has a chance to pass compatriot Pete 
Sampras to to finish the year as No. 1. ``It's possible,'' admitted 
Agassi. ``But first I need to be able to win.''
