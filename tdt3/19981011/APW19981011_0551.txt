As U.S. bombers moved into position for possible NATO airstrikes on 
Yugoslavia, a senior U.S. envoy accelerated talks Sunday with President 
Slobodan Milosevic, after reporting ``no change'' in the leader's 
tough stand on the crisis in the Kosovo province. U.S. envoy Richard 
Holbrooke and Milosevic met into the night Sunday for the sixth time 
in seven days, signaling U.S. determination to search for a peaceful 
way out of the Kosovo deadlock. The Americans and Europeans are demanding 
that Milosevic halt the crackdown he launched Feb. 28 after the militant 
Kosovo Liberation Army stepped up attacks on Serb police and troops 
in the troubled province. Kosovo is a province of Serbia, the main 
republic of Yugoslavia. Its 2 million-strong population is 90 percent 
ethnic Albanian, and most of them want independence or substantial 
self-rule. The major obstacle to solving the crisis appears to be 
Holbrooke's demand that Milosevic agree to an expanded international 
monitoring mission to verify compliance with demands of the U.N. Security 
Council. Those demands include a withdrawal of special troops, an 
immediate cease-fire, allowing refugees to return home and beginning 
talks with ethnic Albanians on Kosovo's future. In Washington, U.S. 
President Bill Clinton's national security adviser, Sandy Berger, 
told CNN on Sunday that Milosevic ``is not in compliance as of this 
point.'' Berger said that if Milosevic remains defiant, NATO will 
act as early as Monday to authorize the alliance commander, Gen. Wesley 
Clark, to launch military strikes. ``The ball now is in Mr. Milosevic's 
court,'' Berger said. ``He can come into compliance or he can face 
military action by NATO'' at ``any time.'' Washington backed up those 
words with actions. Six U.S. B-52 bombers arrived Sunday in Britain 
and a contingent of A-10 anti-tank planes flew from Germany to Italy. 
In Bucharest, the Romanian government agreed to allow NATO to use 
its airspace in ``emergency and unpredictable situations'' if the 
alliance launches airstrikes against Yugoslavia.
