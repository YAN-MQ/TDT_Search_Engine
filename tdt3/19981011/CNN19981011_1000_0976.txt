You no longer have an excuse if distance is keeping you from going 
to college. Beverly Schuch explains, there's a new trend in higher 
education -- long-distance learning. Clay Walker found a way to get 
his master's degree in business without leaving his job. By day, he's 
a marketing executive for NFL players incorporated. At night, on weekends 
and on an occasional lunch break, he attends Colorado state University 
-- 2,000 miles away -- through csu's distance learning program, a 
combination of real-time classes videotaped on campus, book and online 
instruction. You are really doing the same class work that the on-campus 
students are doing. So for anybody who's thinking about it, don't 
think for a minute that it's easier. Don't think for a minute that 
you can get away with doing this in any less time. More than 4 million 
people are taking some kind of distance learning program, either earning 
a degree or certificate, or gaining professional knowledge. And top-drawer 
schools like Stanford and Duke are offering distance degrees. Distance 
learning students are older than their on-campus counterparts because 
most are in the workforce. When considering a distance learning degree, 
make sure you have the self-discipline and motivation to go the distance. 
And there are important questions to ask. Is there a residency requirement? 
Is there a good online library and telephone support to get help if 
necessary? Finally, is the institution properly accredited -- diploma 
mills cranking out worthless degrees are plentiful. Financial aid 
is available for distance learners. And for many programs, there is 
no difference between a degree earned on campus and one earned from 
a distance. That's "your money," Beverly Schuch, "CNN Financial News," 
New York.
