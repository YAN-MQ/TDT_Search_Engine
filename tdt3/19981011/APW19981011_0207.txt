Forty-three Sudanese died of diarrhea last week in a government hospital 
in Omdurman following a scare over contaminated food, a newspaper 
reported Sunday. More than 160 patients, most of them from poor neighborhoods 
in Omdurman, were admitted to the hospital, the independent daily 
Akhbar al-Sa'a reported. Omdurman neighbors the capital, Khartoum. 
In a crackdown last week aimed at preventing disease through contaminated 
food, health and police authorities closed down nearly 1,500 food 
kiosks and put on trial more than 6,000 street vendors.
