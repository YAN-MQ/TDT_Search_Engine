Concealed in giant swaths of blue cloth, a woman steps out of the 
shadows and whispers in accented English: ``I am an educator. Do you 
have a job for me, not in Kabul, in the provinces?'' The rancid smell 
of an open sewer hangs heavy in the mid-afternoon heat and the bark 
of stray dogs makes the whisper barley audible. Another woman outside 
a blue-tiled mosque eyes a foreigner. Quickly she tucks her chin to 
her chest and stoops her shoulders trying it seems to bury herself 
deep inside her burqua. She steps forward her hand outstretched. ``I'm 
not a beggar, but I have no choice. I need food for my family,'' says 
a voice from within. In the beleaguered capital, ruled by Afghanistan's 
hardline Taliban religious army, women have been on the receiving 
end of most of the militia's Islamic edicts. Women cannot work, girls 
do not go to school. Women are not allowed to leave their homes unless 
accompanied by a male relative. Taxi drivers routinely are beaten 
if their fare is a woman alone. Devastated by relentless fighting 
between rival Islamic factions, aid workers say an estimated 30,000 
widows are among the hardest hit by the Taliban's rigid rules regarding 
women. Forced off the job in 1996 when the Taliban took control of 
Kabul some women have resorted to begging, others to sending their 
young children on to the street to scavenge and beg. These so-called 
street children in Kabul, according to a survey by one aid group, 
is about 28,000. ``There are a a lot of widows in Afghanistan who 
have lost their husbands, their bread winners, in the war. . . these 
women have to do something for their survival,'' said Huma Saeed, 
a member of a small, but vocal Afghan women's group called the Revolutionary 
Afghan Women's Association. Their members, like Saeed, are mostly 
in neighboring Pakistan. ``They have lost the male members of their 
family and they themselves cannot have a job,'' says Saeed. ``Begging 
is the only way.'' The Taliban defend their edicts in the name of 
Islam and remind its critics that the previous rulers of Kabul, led 
by ousted President Burhanuddin Rabbani, destroyed the city in four 
years of bitter factional fighting that killed 50,000 people, many 
of them women and children. They say the streets were not safe from 
marauding bands of men who would steal and rape. But for women it 
seems the Taliban's harsh edicts is taking a toll on their mental 
health. At Kabul's only mental health hospital, Dr. Shaheen Shah Wasah, 
says since the Taliban takeover the number of women patients is on 
the increase. Theirs is a small shabby ward. Even behind closed doors 
several women bury themselves in their burqa, lying listlessly on 
the bed. Some moan and rock back and forth. Others squat in a corner. 
Depression is their greatest enemy, says Wasah. ``Some of them were 
students or teachers or worked in the government,'' he said. ``Now 
she is in her home. She has no picnics. She can't go anywhere . . 
. anymore. Of course it affects her brain.'' There have been reports, 
although not documented, that suicide among women in Afghanistan has 
increased dramatically in Kabul since the Taliban takeover. Wasah 
agreed, but said that suicide in Islamic Afghanistan is shameful and 
victims are buried quickly and quietly. ``Many more women are coming 
to my hospital . . . they are suffering from depression,'' he said. 
``But many more are coming for medicine and going back home.'' But 
the medicine is running out, says Wasah. International aid workers, 
who have left Kabul to protest a Taliban order relocating them to 
abandoned school dormitories, were supplying Kabul's only mental health 
hospital with its medicines. Another week and Wasah's stock of medicines 
will be gone. ``Then I don't know what I will do,'' he said. ``Maybe 
I will take them and leave them outside the presidential palace.'' 
On the street outside the mental health hospital, children scramble 
and jostle for a place in front of the World Food Program bakeries 
that supply subsidized bread to some of Kabul's poorest. Children, 
clutching their WFP slip _ proof that they are in need _ wrap the 
warm bread in their tattered scarves and trudge back home. Six-year-old 
Laila rubs her inflamed eye, squinting into the sun, as she explains 
that the bread and rice is the only food her family is likely to eat 
that day. ``I come every day . . . there are six of us in my family,'' 
she says.
