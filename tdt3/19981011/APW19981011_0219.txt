Tiger Woods missed a 4-foot putt at the last after blowing a 4-stroke 
lead as the United States lost to Spain in the semifinal of the Dunhill 
Cup Sunday. After John Daly had won his match against Miguel Angel 
Jimenez in another nail-biting finish and with Mark O'Meara trailing 
Jose Maria Olazabal by three, Woods and Santiago Luna came to the 
last with the Spaniard ahead by one. Putting for an eagle from just 
off the green, Woods left his ball only four feet from the hole. Luna 
then handed the American a great chance of a playoff when his eagle 
putt from an almost identical position only just made the top of the 
green and rolled back into the depression known as the Valley of Sin. 
Luna's follow up putt ended three feet from the hole and Woods needed 
to hold his to force a playoff. But he slid it wide and three feet 
past and Luna holed his to clinch an upset victory. Woods, who was 
out in 34 and appeared to be on course to continue his phenomenal 
series of low scores here, wound up with a level par 72 to lose by 
one. His previous three rounds had gone 66-70-66. Daly, who was 6-up 
at the turn but level going to the last, carded 73 to beat Jimenez 
by two for a personal Dunhill Cup record of 8-1 having played in the 
United States' 1993 triumph. O'Meara limped home with a 76 to lose 
to Olazabal by four. In the final later Sunday with 300,000 pounds 
(dlrs 500,000) at stake for the winning trio, Spain met defending 
titlist South Africa, who downed Australia 2-1. South Africa's David 
Frost crushed Craig Parry by six after a 72 while Retief Goosen won 
his ninth Dunhill Cup match in a row with a 71 to beat Stuart Appleby 
by three and clinch another place in the final. In the last match, 
Ernie Els returned a 73 and lost to Australia's Steve Elkington by 
one.
