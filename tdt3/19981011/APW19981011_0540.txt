Brazil's Rodrigo Pessoa took home the last gold medal awarded at the 
World Equestrian Games Sunday, defeating three other riders in the 
final show jumping test. Pessoa qualified for Sunday's four-way final 
in first position and went on to win the event with a total score 
of 4 penalty points. He rides the 11-year-old German-bred gelding 
Gandini Lianos. Frenchman Thierry Pomel, 42, scored 5 points to clinch 
the silver on the selle Francais gelding Thor des Chaines. The defending 
champion, Germany's Franke Sloothaak, 40, earned the bronze on stallion 
San Patrignano Joly with a score of 8. At 26, Pessoa was among the 
youngest riders competing. He is the son of 64-year-old veteran Nelson 
Pessoa, who also competed in this edition of the worlds. ``I learned 
everything from my father so I tried to do everything he taught me,'' 
Pessoa said. ``He has never won a gold at the worlds so this medal 
is for both of us.'' Pessoa made his equestrian career on the European 
circuit, winning the World Cup show-jumping title this season. Switzerland's 
Willi Melliger, 45, the 1996 Olympic silver medalist, was fourth with 
12 penalty points. Melliger's horse, a grey Holsteiner gelding, Calvaro 
V, won the Best Horse award for making the fewest faults. In the final 
test, each competitor takes a turn riding his three rivals' horses 
and the person who accumulates the least penalties wins. Penalties 
are awarded for refusing, knocking down or touching an obstacle, and 
for falling. The top American, Alison Firestone, did not qualify for 
Sunday's final, finishing a disappointing 14th in Saturday's round 
of jumping. After dominating the 1996 Atlanta Olympics, Germany again 
dominated the worlds here, winning 10 medals, including five golds. 
It collected golds in the show-jumping, the individual and team dressage, 
and the women's and team vaulting. New Zealand won both the team and 
individual three-day event, with the individual gold going to 1990 
champion Blyth Tait. The sole U.S. gold went to Devon Maitozo in the 
men's vaulting. Switzerland's Werner Ulrich won the individual driving 
and the Netherlands won the team driving event. The next edition of 
the worlds are scheduled for Jerez, Spain in 2002.
