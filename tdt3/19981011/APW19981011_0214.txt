A special U.S. envoy insists ``nothing has changed'' in efforts to 
convince Slobodan Milosevic to accept international demands for peace 
in Kosovo despite the Yugoslav president's claim he has met U.N. conditions 
to avoid NATO airstrikes. Richard Holbrooke met again Sunday with 
Milosevic, whose crackdown on ethnic Albanian separatists in Kosovo 
seven months ago has brought NATO to the brink of airstrikes. Following 
a late night session which ended after midnight Sunday, the government's 
Tanjug news agency issued a statement from Milosevic saying all conditions 
necessary for a political settlement had been met and all U.N. demands 
fulfilled. But Holbrooke gave no hint of an impending breakthrough, 
saying ``nothing has changed.'' Calling the situation ``very serious,'' 
Holbrooke said NATO will meet Monday ``to authorize action'' unless 
he achieves a breakthrough for ``a peaceful, acceptable'' alternative 
to the use of force. The major obstacle to an agreement appears to 
be Holbrooke's demand that Milosevic agree to an expanded international 
monitoring mission which would verify compliance with demands of the 
U.N. Security Council. Holbrooke alluded this early Sunday, saying 
his mission ``will continue an intense effort to find a peaceful, 
acceptable, fully verifiable compliance system as an alternative to 
the other choice'' _ meaning the use of force. But Holbrooke said 
``we certainly don't agree.'' The Serbs appeared to be separating 
the demand for verification with the general conditions laid down 
by the Security Council. On Sunday, Belgrade's newspapers ran optimistic 
headlines suggesting that tensions had eased and that an agreement 
may be in sight. Ekspres Politika headlined: ``Sobering Up,'' and 
Dnevni Telegraf bannered: `` NATO Threat Removed?'' Kosovo is a province 
of Serbia, the main republic of Yugoslavia. But its 2 million-strong 
population is 90 percent ethnic Albanian, and many of them want independence 
or substantial self-rule. Milosevic launched the crackdown after the 
Kosovo Liberation Army stepped up attacks on Serb police and troops 
in the troubled province. But the crackdown has left hundreds dead 
and driven more than a quarter million civilians from their homes, 
prompting renewed international efforts to end the crisis before winter 
sets in. In Sofia, Bulgaria, U.S. first lady Hillary Rodham Clinton 
told an international women's conference that the world ``must speak 
with one voice to end what is both a humanitarian crisis and violation 
of humanity'' in Kosovo. Sources close to Milosevic, speaking on condition 
of anonymity, said he had signaled his willingness to comply with 
six main demands in order to head off NATO intervention. Those measures 
include withdrawing more troops from Kosovo, allowing humanitarian 
aid to the refugees and opening up serious talks with the secessionists 
on the restoration of self-rule which he abolished in 1989. But the 
sources said Milosevic refused to budge on an additional demand to 
deploy an international monitoring force in the secessionist Serbian 
province. The force, aimed at seeing if he was living up to his commitments, 
would include some NATO troops. ``Milosevic won't make any concessions 
that go against the interests of the Serbian people,'' Dragan Tomic, 
a close Milosevic ally, said Saturday. The weekend of intensive diplomacy 
signals a glimmer of hope in efforts to avoid NATO action to halt 
a crackdown in Kosovo that has killed hundreds and displaced upwards 
of 300,000 from their homes. Showing Milosevic it means business if 
talks fail, Washington ordered the deployment of six B-52 bombers, 
one reconnaissance aircraft and 13 tankers to Britain in preparation 
for possible intervention. Also stepping up the pressure, NATO Secretary-General 
Javier Solana said the 16 members all but erased their remaining differences 
on airstrikes at a meeting of alliance ambassadors Saturday. ``If 
Milosevic does not comply, I can tell you that NATO is ready to act,'' 
Solana told reporters in Brussels, Belgium. Washington is pressing 
for a monitoring force, which would include some NATO troops, because 
Milosevic gained a reputation for breaking promises during Bosnia's 
civil war. He also violated a pledge earlier this year to halt his 
offensive against the ethnic Albanian militants. Meanwhile, a top 
Russian military official said Moscow was prepared to take Yugoslavia's 
side in case of NATO airstrikes _ and provide weapons if necessary. 
``I think that in this case, Russia will have a right to develop full-scale 
military cooperation with the Federal Republic of Yugoslavia,'' Col. 
Gen. Leonid Ivashov told NTV television station. Russia is the Serbs' 
main ally, sharing bonds of religion and joint Slavic roots. In Kosovo, 
Holbrooke met with three ethnic Albanian negotiators _ Fehmi Agani, 
Iljaz Kurtesi and Edita Tahiri _ and then with political leader Ibrahim 
Rugova. Philip Reeker, a spokesman, said Holbrooke and his aides were 
conducting two-track talks _ on a political level and on Milosevic's 
compliance, ``because compliance has got to be full, durable and verifiable.'' 
A deal would require Milosevic to give up full domination over Kosovo, 
and the ethnic Albanian side would have to settle for less than full 
independence. Chief ethnic Albanian negotiator Agani has rejected 
that element, saying Kosovo could not remain in Serbia following the 
violence. The Serbian side was close to accepting it, but rejects 
the idea that Kosovo police would be dominated by ethnic Albanians, 
Serbian sources said.
