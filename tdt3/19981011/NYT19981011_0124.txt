The New York Times' computer football ranking is based on an analysis 
of each team's scores with emphasis on three factors: who won, by 
what margin and against what quality of opposition. The quality of 
an opponent is determined by examining its record against other teams. 
The Times' computer model collapses runaway scores and takes note 
of a home-field advantage. Recent games count more than earlier games. 
The top team is assigned a rating of 1.000; the ratings of all other 
teams are percentages reflecting their strength relative to the top 
team. This week, for example, there is a very large difference Ohio 
State (1) and UCLA (2), and a much smaller difference between Tennessee 
(4) and Virginia Tech (5).
