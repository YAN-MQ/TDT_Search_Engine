One of the most sensitive indicators of economic health is the housing 
market. Aram Roston has more. The Atlanta housing market has been 
white hot in the '90s, with prices climbing fast and new homes going 
up everywhere. Low interest rates, low inflation and a booming economy 
have been the driving factors here, as they have in the rest of the 
country. All the ingredients that, in fact, fuel a good housing market. 
In spite of 6% mortgages and a healthy economy, builder Rick Porter 
says the boom cycle has to end. He says unpredictability overseas 
and in the stock market at home means now is not the time to expand 
his business. All of the intangible factors today are creating an 
environment where I'm saying, "well, I better make some good decisions 
right now. I better be careful over the next couple of years." It's 
about an acre lot -- Tandi tempele, a broker in Atlanta, spends her 
days showing some of the city's most expensive real estate. She says 
fears about the economy are causing jitters among prospective buyers. 
I had a client that came to look at the house. And she said that her 
husband felt that the market was really going to downturn, and that 
we have been -- we are at the height of the market. And that it's 
going to start going down the tubes. And they actually called me back 
later on in the afternoon and decided they didn't want to come back 
to the house, because they were afraid that maybe the market would 
turn. Economists like David seiders say there is some reason to be 
concerned. We haven't really seen anything dramatic in the numbers, 
housing numbers, yet. But I think there is trouble brewing there. 
Nationwide, the national association of home builders predicts a 10% 
drop in single-family home sales over the next nine months. Aram Roston,
