Pakistan canceled its contract with the country's largest private 
power company on Sunday and Prime Minister Nawaz Sharif announced 
a 30 percent cut in electricity bills. Several senior officials of 
the largely British-owned Hub Power Company (Hubco) have been charged 
with fraud and giving kickbacks, said Pakistan's accountability chief 
Saif-ur Rehman. The cancellation of Hubco's contract follows months 
of wrangling between the government and privately run power companies 
in Pakistan. It was the third private company to have its contract 
canceled. The government says the companies charged inflated prices 
for electricity sold to the cash-strapped state utility. The private 
power company contracts were signed by former Prime Minister Benazir 
Bhutto's government. According to Sharif the cancellation of the Hubco 
contract will save Pakistan 10 billion rupees (dlrs 217 million). 
``I am returning this 10 billion rupees to you. . . by reducing your 
electricity bill,'' he said on national television. It will go into 
effect on Oct. 21. His critics however say that Pakistan's economy 
is teetering on the verge of collapse and can ill afford to slash 
its power rates. Economists and traders on the stock exchange warned 
that the cancellation of the Hubco contract will cause chaos when 
the Karachi Stock Exchange opens for trading on Monday. ``The share 
price of Hub power will drop further now and there will be panic in 
the stock market when it opens Monday,'' said Sajjad Mankani, a dealer 
at BMA Capital Management in the southern port city of Karachi. In 
addition to canceling the contract, the government lodged two criminal 
cases of ``fraud, commissions and electricity theft'' against senior 
company officials, including chief executive D.M. Woodroofe, resident 
engineer Tom Macky and finance director Khursheed Hussain in the southern 
port city of Karachi, Rehman told a news conference in the federal 
capital. Several key officials of Ms. Bhutto's former government also 
have been charged, he said. Rehman said Hubco paid millions of dollars 
in kickbacks to officials in Ms. Bhutto's government to charge inflated 
rates. ``We have proof of their corruption and have formed a strong 
team of legal experts to fight the cases,'' he said. The state-run 
Water and Power Development Authority buys electricity from Hubco 
at 6.60 rupees (14 cents) per kilowatt compared to the 1.36 rupees 
per kilowatt fixed in 1992 by Sharif, who was in power at the time, 
he said. ``We have decided to cancel the agreements made during the 
Bhutto government and will pay according to the old agreement of 1992,'' 
Rehman said. There was no immediate comment from Hubco officials.
