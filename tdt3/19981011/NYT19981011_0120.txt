NATIONAL FORECAST The slow-moving storm system that brought downpours 
to much of New England at the weekend, including nearly 12 inches 
of rain in parts of southern Maine will move into the North Atlantic 
Ocean on Monday. Clouds will linger for a time in parts of eastern 
and northern New England, but sunshine will return as drier breezes 
from the north develop. Most of the interior Northeast will have ample 
sunshine with a mild afternoon, despite patchy morning fog in the 
valleys of the central Appalachians. The southeastern states will 
be warm and abundantly sunny as high pressure drifts over the region. 
Onshore winds along the southern flank of the high will bring a few 
clouds and isolated showers to the eastern coast of Florida and parts 
of the western Gulf of Mexico coast. Periods of cool rain will fall 
near a low-pressure center as it moves across northern Minnesota to 
the northern Great Lakes. Farther south, a broken band of light showers 
will accompany a front as it sweeps through the central Great Lakes 
states. In the wake of the front, cool, gusty winds from the northwest 
will import drier air to the Dakotas to the northern Mississippi Valley. 
In the West, the Rocky Mountain states will have plenty of sunshine. 
By afternoon, temperatures in most areas will be several degrees above 
the seasonal average. A cold front will bring clouds and showers as 
it moves into the Pacific Northwest. Meanwhile, the deserts of the 
Southwest will be very warm with plenty of bright sunshine. Focus: 
Autumn Frost In much of the Northeast, October brings the first frost 
since spring. However, the occurrence of the first frost can differ 
by as much as months within 100 miles. There are significant delays 
in frost in major cities as opposed to the surrounding countryside, 
in coastal communities compared with inland areas, and over hilltops 
vs. nearby valleys. On the plateau of northwestern Pennsylvania, there 
is a 70 percent chance of a freeze by Sept. 1. Yet not far away along 
the shores of the relatively warm Lake Erie, wine makers can enjoy 
frost-free weather into early November.
