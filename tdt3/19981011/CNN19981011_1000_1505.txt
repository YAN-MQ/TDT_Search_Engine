Whether the topic is bugs, meteors or world war II, Hollywood seems 
to be following a simple rule this year -- one movie is not enough. 
Lauren Sydney reports. Does it bug you when one movie too closely 
resembles another? This fall "ant sooechlt" will go antenna to antenna 
with "bug's life." Precon fain was based on Steve prefontaine. Last 
year special effects ex-trav began is A's Dante's peak and volcano 
erupted simultaneously in theaters but weak ticket sales left them 
in the dust. It's never recommended to have two movies out there that 
are too close. An audience really doesn't have that much time. On 
occasion they do. Deep impact and Armageddon made a big dent at the 
box office. Both movies are good, they'll survive. Both movies will 
survive. But studios still like to hedge their bets. Huge jockeying 
for position. The old movie would slide around for weeks before the 
release date. What one did was tell them they were coming out in March 
so the other one settled out in November and then they said we're 
going to come out in October. Things like that happen all the time. 
If mb is doing a story about an ant all of a sudden somebody else 
has one. That's funny Hollywood's like that. All of a sudden everybody 
is doing movies about world war II and there's 12 of them out. Not 
12 but certainly 12. "Saving private Ryan" paved the way for "the 
thin red line" which will hit theaters Christmas day. Another film 
is the "the trueman show," two teenagers get stuck in a television 
show in the upcoming film and Ron Howard directs Ed TV. Although the 
film come comes out next year it is already drawing comparisons to 
the trueman show. I think that cold probably only help nus reality 
because we look at some of the similar areas in such a completely 
different way. The trueman show, Ed TV, Pleasantville are such off 
beat concepts that an audience can return to that more than they can 
return to asteroid hitting the earth. It's more complicated, more 
dependant on drama and the acting. But it is still dependant on audiences 
liking repeat story Lyons as much as studios like repeat business.
