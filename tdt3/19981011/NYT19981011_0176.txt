The Welcome Wagon is rolling up the welcome mat. Since the 1920s, 
Welcome Wagon's sales representatives, almost always women, have gone 
from house to house visiting newlyweds and the newly moved-in, bearing 
greeting baskets laden with coupons, magnets, ballpoint pens and other 
items sponsored by the local locksmith, the town optometrist and other 
merchants. But these old-fashioned visits are coming to an end, in 
a testament to changing lifestyles or perhaps that traditional corporate 
desire to cut costs. The owner of the Welcome Wagon, Cendant Corp., 
is dismissing most of its 2,200 representatives and will replace them 
with direct marketing through the mail. So rather than a lengthy visit 
with the possibility of real-time conversation, each of Welcome Wagon's 
targeted households will get a bound directory delivered to the doorstep, 
in which businesses will have paid to advertise. The point is to reach 
more people, Cendant spokesmen say, and these days, people are not 
at home as much as they used to be, because of busier families and 
a surge in the number of working mothers. Cendant, which also owns 
Avis car rentals and Howard Johnson hotels, has found itself in financial 
turmoil this year, but the company says its problems are not related 
to its decision to change the Welcome Wagon. This change, however, 
appears to have taken many sales representatives by surprise and was 
met with sorrow by some of them. Although they were paid for their 
work, certain representatives regarded it as more of a social mission 
than a marketing one. For decades, Welcome Wagon thrived on that very 
ambiguity, getting over the threshold thanks to its neighborly demeanor 
when other marketers might not. ``My heart is in these home visits,'' 
said Dee Strilowich, the company's top-performing salesperson, who 
has worked for Welcome Wagon in Ridgefield, Conn., and nearby Redding 
for the last four years. ``I loved giving the welcome and greeting 
to those new movers, new parents, engaged women.'' But Cendant insisted 
that times had changed, which is why it decided last month to end 
the visits and lay off its representatives. ``It's a different world 
today,'' said Elliot Bloom, a spokesman for Cendant in Parsippany, 
N.J. ``In the past, 20 years ago, when you knocked on people's doors, 
Mom was home. Now she's in the work force.'' A vice president for 
Welcome Wagon, Dinah Watson, agreed. ``We had representatives who 
were beating their heads against the wall because they had the names 
of several people to go and visit but could never find them at home,'' 
she said. She said she was offered a severance package, which she 
will be taking, and added that the 250 representatives she supervised 
have until the end of this month to decide whether they will stay 
with the company. About 500 people will be retained to work in ad 
sales for Welcome Wagon, Bloom said. It is being combined with another 
Cendant company, called Getting to Know You, that specializes in direct 
mail. ``Whenever you make a change like this, there is some displacement,'' 
said Christopher Jones, another Cendant spokesman. Representatives 
have until the end of the year to make their visits, and after that, 
``we've asked them to stop.'' Mrs. Strilowich, who was greeted herself 
by a Welcome Wagon representative when she moved to Ridgefield 28 
years ago, said she had about 200 visits scheduled through December 
and would complete them all. She said most of the representatives 
she had spoken to were sorry to see their jobs end so suddenly. ``A 
lot of them are in the same situation I was,'' she said, adding that 
she is the primary earner in her family. ``They were looking for at 
least two or three more years.'' Some Welcome Wagon representatives 
expressed anger over the loss of their jobs and the end of their visits 
with families. ``Cendant sacrificed us for the bottom line,'' said 
Wendy Amundsen, one of the company's top-selling representatives, 
in Stamford, Conn. ``Sometimes there are just more important things 
in life than money.'' Cendant has been struggling this year with other, 
much larger business problems, including an accounting error that 
stripped $115 million from its 1997 earnings, the subsequent resignations 
of a host of senior executives, and a stock price that has plunged 
from $41.69 in April to $9 on Friday. But Bloom dismissed as ``absolute 
nonsense'' any suggestion that Cendant's wider problems had led to 
the switch in strategy for Welcome Wagon. He said that the company 
had peaked in 1968 with 1.5 million visits a year, but that the number 
had fallen to 580,000 last year. Still, Cendant had thought enough 
of the company to pay $20 million to acquire it in 1995, when Cendant 
was known as CUC International and the number of visits was estimated 
at 500,000 a year. At the time, CUC said it planned to expand the 
sales force, and it did so, adding some 800 positions by this year. 
The company saw Welcome Wagon as a marketing device for a personal 
credit-history business it already owned. With little overhead beyond 
the 100-person management staff, a toll-free number and a World Wide 
Web site, profits were substantial. And sales representatives, who 
were paid by the amount of business they solicited from area merchants, 
could earn as much as $70,000 a year. Many received benefits as well. 
Welcome Wagon took its name from 19th century Conestoga covered wagons 
that would greet frontier settlers as they arrived, bringing food 
and fresh water from the nearest village. The company was founded 
in 1928 in Memphis, Tenn. This summer, to mark its 70th anniversary, 
the governors of several states declared part of July ``Welcome Wagon 
Week.'' ``You will visit households when they're celebrating a move, 
or an engagement, or the birth of a new child,'' promises the Welcome 
Wagon Web site, which so far has not been altered to reflect the newly 
impersonal nature of the operation. ``You will also introduce local 
businesses to Welcome Wagon's unique, personalized advertising program. 
What could be more fun.'' But now the fun is over. ``I thought Welcome 
Wagon would go on forever,'' Ms. Amundsen said. ``Welcome Wagon is 
like apple pie, baseball, hot dogs. It's an American institution. 
I thought I would retire in this job.''
