``Have you ever lost a friend?,'' Jane Barlow Schwartz, the narrator, 
asks at the opening of Cathleen Schine's witty new novel, ``The Evolution 
of Jane.'' Jane has lost a friend, Martha Barlow, her distant cousin. 
``She had been my best friend for almost a decade, for more than half 
of childhood,'' Jane explains, ``and then she evaporated, as though 
she had never really existed at all. Did anyone call me, try to console 
me, try to find a new friend for me? Yet when my husband left me after 
six months, I was bathed in sympathy and inappropriate blind dates.'' 
When her husband left her, Jane's mother became convinced that she 
needed to `` `go abroad' in order to heal.'' `` `Off you go!' my mother 
used to say when she pushed me out the door to play, to stop me from 
moping around the house. `` `Off you go!' she said after my divorce. 
`Off to the Galapagos!' '' Why the Galapagos? In her childhood, Jane 
had been infatuated with Darwin. Like the protagonists of Ms. Schine's 
previous novels (``Alice in Bed,'' ``To the Birdhouse,'' ``Rameau's 
Niece'' and ``The Love Letter''), Jane is fascinated with order, and 
what she had particularly liked about an illustrated account of the 
voyage of the Beagle were ``pictures of the cabinets used to store 
specimens, pictures of rows of little bottles and jars and wooden 
boxes, each labeled in an old-fashioned hand.'' She had always wanted 
to visit the Galapagos, the famous site of Darwin's studies of the 
origin of species. So she happily accepts her mother's offer of a 
trip there as her 25th-birthday present. And when she arrives, who 
turns out to be her tour guide? None other than Martha Barlow, her 
long-lost childhood friend. In what follows, Jane worries increasingly 
about why Martha ``had thrown me over, dumped, ditched, cut, cold-shouldered, 
discarded, shelved, jettisoned and retired me,'' which she has never 
understood. On the tour, Martha is friendly to Jane and highly instructive 
on the Galapagos flora and fauna, particularly as they pertain to 
Darwin's theories of natural selection. But happy as she is to become 
reacquainted with Jane, she clearly isn't interested in exploring 
their personal past. This forces Jane to remember the details of their 
friendship and to examine them for possible offenses she might have 
given. Their families had occupied two of three identical houses in 
Connecticut built by the girls' great-great-grandfather for his triplet 
sons. These sons were ``ships' captains who prospered and caused their 
New England village to prosper to such an extent that the town fathers 
rechristened it `Barlow' after its own favorite sons.'' In the family's 
subsequent history, some sort of mysterious feud had broken out, possibly 
over the sale of part of the family business. This may explain why 
Jane's and Martha's parents, although summer next-door neighbors, 
were politely cool to one another. But the girls had overcome whatever 
stood between the families and become virtual twins. Until somehow, 
somewhere, Jane did something to drive Martha away. In the Galapagos, 
Jane feels compelled to understand how the friendship came to an end, 
just as in her passion for order she has to understand how a unique 
organism comes into being and what exactly defines a species. ``The 
mechanism that explained the transmutation of species would explain 
Martha's transmutation, the transmutation of friendship.'' If she 
can't find an explanation, if friendship lapses into nonfriendship 
in the way that one species seems to transmute into another, then 
Jane faces what she feels is most frightening about Darwin: ``not 
nature red in tooth and claw,'' ``not our ancestors the apes,'' but 
chaos, meaning ``there is no plan, there never was one.'' Perhaps 
to face this chaos is where Jane has to evolve. In ``The Evolution 
of Jane,'' Ms. Schine very nearly pulls off a tour de force in which 
friendship comes to stand for the possibility of transcending natural 
selection. The characters, especially as bright, strong-willed children, 
are charming in the way we have come to expect of Ms. Schine's writing. 
(Typical of Jane as a child is her response to her father's saying, 
``Jane, I'm speechless,'' which is to retort, `` `I'm speechless' 
is speech.'') The Darwinian ideas are articulated with vivid intensity, 
particularly in the anecdotes that Martha relates about the creatures 
of the Galapagos. But a degree of strain becomes evident when events 
are made to illustrate the novel's ideas. Certain incidents seem awkwardly 
forced. That Jane thinks so little about her ex-husband that she mentions 
him only three or four times in passing is hard to believe. And despite 
all the theorizing about the nature of Jane's and Martha's friendship, 
one finds it difficult to accept that Jane can never bring herself 
to sit down with Martha and ask her: ``So what happened to us? Why 
did you stop returning my calls?'' Consistently amusing and provocative, 
``The Evolution of Jane'' remains a great pleasure to read. But it 
works better intellectually than in the gut, where the best fiction 
has to make its presence felt. PUBLICATION NOTES: `THE EVOLUTION OF 
JANE' By Cathleen Schine 210 pages. Houghton Mifflin. $24.
