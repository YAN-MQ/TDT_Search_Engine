Three bombs exploded minutes apart from each other Sunday afternoon 
in Corsica's two main ports, in the latest attacks during a government 
crackdown on the French island. There was no claim of responsibility 
for the blasts, which caused some damage but no injuries. But suspicion 
fell on Corsican militants waging a 23-year-old campaign for greater 
autonomy. The first explosion targeted a building adjoining tax offices 
in the center of Bastia on the northern end of the rocky island, police 
officials said on customary anonymity. A few minutes later, a two 
explosions occurred near the center of Ajaccio on the western side 
of Corsica. One blast struck a garage belonging to the state utility 
Electricite de France. The exact location of the other explosion in 
Ajaccio was not immediately known. The blasts came less than three 
weeks after an underground nationalist group threatened new attacks. 
It was the same group that claimed responsibility for assassinating 
the top French official on the island Feb. 9. The killing of Prefect 
Claude Erignac, was a symbolic act against France's centralized government, 
triggered a government crackdown including arrests and the replacement 
of a number of local officials. A probe on Corsica released last month 
found a ``pre-mafia-like'' system of corruption driven in part by 
militant intimidation. Meanwhile, a newspaper reported Corsican nationalists 
had plotted bombings in Metz in eastern France. The city is the birthplace 
of Judge Gilbert Thiel, who was investigating terrorism on Corsica. 
A police search two weeks ago at the home of Corsican nationalist 
Charles Pieri, a leader of A Cuncolta Independentista, found documents 
showing the planned attacks on public buildings, the newspaper Est 
Republicain reported. The attacks were never carried out. Various 
Corsican nationalist groups have demanded greater autonomy or outright 
independence on the island, a tourist haven that suffers from chronic 
unemployment and underdevelopment.
