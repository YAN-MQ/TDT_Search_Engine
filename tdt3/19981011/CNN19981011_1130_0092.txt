The house Judiciary committee is scheduled to meet to discuss its 
impeachment inquiry against President Clinton. Lawyers on both sides 
are also expected to continue considering which witnesses to subpoena 
and decide which facts are in dispute. On this morning's talk shows, 
two congressmen expressed confidence the proceedings would be fair. 
This is reality now. I'm sitting as a juror. I'm sitting as someone 
who is going to shape the law for years to come in this country. I 
don't like Bill Clinton as a politician. I would argue against his 
education policies. I don't have a whole lot of respect for him as 
a politician. I love the law. And I'm going to be sitting, with these 
guys and other people on the committee, and what we do here will determine 
the flavor of the law and the politics long after we're dead and gone. 
It's the most important thing I'll ever do. No one is going to check 
their conscience at the door. You asked the question earlier of Lindsay 
Graham, about his signing on the resolution. I'm confident that this 
committee under the leadership of Henry Hyde and John Conyers will 
get on track. As Tom indicated, he and I were disappointed with the 
process to date. But we are hopeful that over the course of the next 
several months, there will be a lack of partisanship and an agreement 
to work together in a process that is fundamentally fair, respectful 
of our constitutional responsibility and the conclusion that we do 
arrive at will be embraced by the American people.
