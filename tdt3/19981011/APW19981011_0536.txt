A British woman critically injured during an armed robbery at a hotel 
bar on Oct. 1 has been airlifted to a hospital in Great Yarmouth, 
England. Medical officials at the Queen Elizabeth Hospital said Saturday 
that although the victim remained in critical condition, she had improved 
enough to withstand the 20-hour flight home by air ambulance. Paula 
Bridges, 41, of Suffolk, was shot in the heart during the robbery 
at the Palm Garden Hotel where she was staying with her family. Accounts 
of the robbery differed on whether the robbers fired at people in 
the bar or whether Bridges was hit by a ricocheting bullet. In an 
effort to curb crimes involving firearms, the Barbados government 
recently increased the penalty for illegal possession of guns from 
two years in prison to 20 years.
