Thirty-three top police informers whose names have been passed on 
to the criminal underworld, _allegedly by a rogue employee in the 
government's prosecution service _ are being given new identities 
in an attempt to protect them, police confirmed Sunday. A clerk at 
the Crown Prosecution Service's London headquarters was charged last 
week with taking the names from a computer and passing them to criminals 
via a nightclub bouncer. Mark Herbert, 30, and bouncer Kevin Sumner, 
40, were ordered held in custody until Oct. 23. On Saturday, two national 
weekly newspapers, The Observer and the Mail on Sunday, succeeded 
in getting a High Court judge to overturn an injunction obtained by 
Attorney-General John Morris banning reporting of the case on grounds 
this would endanger police operations. Judge William Gage ruled Saturday 
that allegations of corruption in the Crown Prosecution Service _ 
which deals with serious cases involving terrorism, drugs and fraud 
_ should be exposed in the public interest. ``All the people on the 
list have been contacted, they all know about the problem.'' said 
a spokeswoman for the prosecution service, speaking on condition of 
anonymity, as is customary. ``This is a matter of great concern to 
us, which is why we have been cooperating with the police. We are 
also starting a full review of security.'' Police declined to give 
further details.
