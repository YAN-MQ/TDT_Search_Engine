Sandrine Testud spoiled the beginning of Lindsay Davenport's reign 
as the new No. 1 by beating the American 7-5, 6-3 to win the Porsche 
Grand Prix on Sunday. Testud, a 26-year-old Frenchwoman, broke Davenport's 
serve three times in the first set and twice more in the second to 
win in 71 minutes and capture the second title of her career after 
Palermo in 1997. Davenport, 22, appeared listless in her first final 
since dethroning Martina Hingis from the top ranking earlier in the 
week. ``Sandrine has played incredibly well this week,'' Davenport 
said. ``I simply couldn't beat her.'' The American had trouble with 
her serve, a factor of her game that Davenport has acknowledged needs 
improving. Testud picked up dlrs 79,000 for her victory, while Davenport 
had to settle for dlrs 36,000. In addition, Testud could drive home 
across the border in a new sports car donated by the title sponsor 
of the tournament. ``It's been a wonderful week,'' Testud said. By 
reaching the semifinals of the dlrs 450,000 indoor event, Davenport 
made sure of rising to No. 1 when the new computer rankings come out 
Monday, ending Hingis' 80-week reign. Davenport suffered only her 
third loss since this summer's Wimbledon. She was in her seventh final 
of the year and seeking her sixth title. Since Wimbledon, Davenport 
has won four tournaments, including last month's U.S. Open, her first 
Grand Slam title. Another showdown between Davenport and Hingis was 
put on hold when Hingis pulled out of next week's tournament in Zurich 
because of an ankle injury.
