"Star wars" tops "entertainment weekly's" list of the 100-best works 
of science fiction. The magazine says George Lucas' 1977 film was 
the prescription for a cynical audience numbed by everything from 
Vietnam to Watergate to drugs. Number two and three are "star trek," 
and "the twilight zone." The rankings are based on a work's quality, 
influence on pop culture and impact on the collective imagination.
