Kelly Robbins closed with a 2-under-par 70 Sunday and won the LPGA 
Tournament of Champions, her first victory since the opening event 
of the season. Robbins finished with a 12-under 276 total, four shots 
better than runner-up and fellow American Juli Inkster and the same 
lead she held over the field starting the final round. Inkster had 
four birdies on the back nine in a 69 as matched her best finish of 
the year. Sherri Steinhauer started the final round in second place, 
but her 71 was her worst round of the tournament and left her at 281. 
The anticipated showdown between player of the year contenders Annika 
Sorenstam of Sweden and South Korean Se Ri Pak didn't pan out. Sorenstam, 
the defending champion, had a 70 and finished at 283. A double-bogey 
on No. 12 effectively took her out of the running for her fifth victory 
of the year. Sorenstam avoided media interviews and autograph seekers 
alike coming off the 18th green. Pak, the leader at seven under after 
two days, double-bogeyed No. 1 to go two over. She finished with a 
72 and was at even par for the tournament. Pak, who has also won four 
tournaments this year, including two majors, had a string of 103 holes 
without a bogey snapped in the second round. She had 12 bogeys over 
the final two rounds. Robbins, 29, earned dlrs 122,000 for winning 
the tournament at the 6,300-yard (5,670-meter), Grand National and 
passed the dlrs 3 million for her career. She has eight victories 
on the U.S. LPGA tour, including the HealthSouth Inaugural in January. 
Robbins had only five top 10 finishes in her last 22 events coming 
in and had missed three of the last four cuts. Inkster was two strokes 
behind Steinhauer after 12 holes, but birdied No. 18 to pass her for 
second. Cindy Figg-Currier had 69 to finish fifth at 284.
