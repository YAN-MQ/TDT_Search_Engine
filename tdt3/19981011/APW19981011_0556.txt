Switzerland's telephone company Swisscom said Sunday it has adjusted 
its books to reflect 942 million Swiss francs (dlrs 725 million) in 
shrunken values of investments in Asia and Eastern Europe. Spokesman 
Werner Nuber said the company had long since informed Swiss authorities 
of the downward adjustments to the value of its assets over three 
years, reported earlier Sunday by the weekly SonntagsBlick. The main 
investments affected include those in the European Unisource alliance, 
which it has shared with AT and T, Dutch and Swedish partners; Malaysia's 
Mutiara Telecom; and India's Aircel Digilink, the company said. But 
Swisscom said it still regards its investments in the turbulent markets 
as having long-term promise despite problems from 1995 through 1997. 
The government-controlled Swisscom, formerly the telecommunications 
arm of Switzerland's postal service, has begun selling shares to the 
public, with an initial offering of about 30 percent of the firm's 
share capital earlier this month. Nuber refused to characterize the 
writeoffs as losses and rejected comparisons with UBS, Switzerland's 
and Europe's largest bank. Last month UBS said market turmoil would 
cause it an after-tax loss of up to 1 billion francs (then dlrs 720 
million) in the third quarter of 1998.
