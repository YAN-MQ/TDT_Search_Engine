U.S. envoy Richard Holbrooke says the situation in Yugoslavia is "very 
serious." He says NAto will meet tomorrow "to authorize action" unless 
he and Yugoslav President Slobodan Milosevic reach an agreement during 
today's talks. Negotiations have resumed, but both sides are digging 
their heels on one issue -- whether Milosevic will allow an international 
monitoring force into Kosovo. NATO is considering air strikes against 
Serbian targets unless the violence in Kosovo stops. The Pentagon 
has deployed six B-52 bombers and other military vehicles to Britain 
in preparation for possible intervention. I think the issue of presence 
on the ground -- what it is, how big it is and what countries are 
involved and how it's made up is possibly a make-or-break in terms 
of how this diplomatic effort continues, whether it triumphs or fails. 
I think the only encouragement we can see -- and certainly U.S. officials 
are alluding to this -- is that this effort is still continuing and 
is set to have more talks today. But this one issue, the most crucial 
issue of trying to guarantee compliance, is the implementation of 
that demand which is going to make or break -- we understand for officials 
-- is going to make or break this mediation effort.
