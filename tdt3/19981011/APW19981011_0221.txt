Both times they've done it, they've been hammered by coaches and players 
complaining the trip is just too far to go for a regular season game. 
They've had problems with the ice, big cost concerns, and now even 
trouble filling the stands. But NHL officials say bringing a couple 
teams over to Japan to start the season is still a good idea _ though 
maybe not next year. The NHL was back in Japan over the weekend with 
a pair of season openers between the Calgary Flames and San Jose Sharks 
at Tokyo's Yoyogi Gymnasium, a venue left over from the 1964 Summer 
Olympics. The game Saturday was a 3-3 tie, and was played before a 
spirited but disappointing crowd of 8,400, well under the 10,000-seat 
capacity. Sunday's 5-3 victory for Calgary featured the first NHL 
hat trick in Japan _ Flames' star Theoren Fleury put in three goals 
and assisted on the other two _ but still fewer people saw it _ 7,100. 
The drop in attendance follows sellout crowds when the NHL season 
openers debuted in Japan last year, just ahead of the Nagano Winter 
Olympics, when the Vancouver Canucks played the Mighty Ducks of Anaheim. 
Players and coaches have complained before each trip that the travel 
time, jet lag and unfamiliar surroundings are an unwelcome burden. 
``I can tell you that coming over you have a lot of reservations,'' 
Fleury said after Sunday's game. He said there were problems with 
the ice _ ``there were a lot of holes in certain parts.'' Of course, 
winning takes the edge off. ``We'll come here anytime,'' said Calgary 
coach Brian Sutter. Whatever the difficulties, league officials say 
they intend to keep spreading the NHL action around. ``What we are 
in is the entertainment business. For people around the world to experience 
it is what we want to do,'' said NHL senior vice president Steve Solomon. 
``Our international objectives are very important.'' Solomon noted 
that NHL ice hockey has a very strong international element, with 
more than 20 percent of the players coming from outside North America. 
But he said that while negotiations for future Japan tours are ongoing, 
a return next year is unlikely. ``We are still in the discussion stage,'' 
he said. ``I suspect we will not be back next year. If we come back, 
what we will be looking at is 2000.'' He said the league is likely 
to hold exhibitions or other events next year in Europe, probably 
in the preseason, but did not foresee any actual expansions involving 
franchises outside North America. ``There are no plans,'' he said. 
``It's not something I see on the radar screen.'' Solomon defended 
the Japan tour, saying that although some players had complained, 
most were happy to be here. ``I think overall the attitude of the 
players is very positive,'' he said. And though the games failed to 
fill the 10,000-seat venue, Solomon said he was satisfied with the 
level of interest here. He said the sophistication of the Japanese 
fans _ many of whom wore NHL team jerseys or waved team pennants throughout 
the games _ requires a regular season game, not an exhibition. ``They 
are very sophisticated,'' he said. ``They know who the stars are, 
and they want the real thing. Exhibition games are possible, but harder 
to generate interest in.''
