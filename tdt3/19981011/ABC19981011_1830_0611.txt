The budget showdown does one thing, it takes attention away from Monica 
Lewinsky. Things may be looking up a bit for the president. Today, 
republican senator Orrin Hatch, head of the Senate Judiciary committee, 
said there are not enough votes in the Senate to remove Mr. Clinton 
from office. Many Americans say they are sick of the whole thing, 
and as ABC's Karla Davis reports, some democrats are trying to turn 
that to their advantage. I think it's time someone stood up for President 
Clinton and stood up to all the republicans who are trying to tear 
him down. Freshly minted political ads are now running in which democrats, 
like this candidate for the governor of New York, attack republicans 
for initiating impeachment hearings. George pataki and the republican 
party -- Months and months of more mud and politics. In a Washington 
state congressional race, the democratic challenger takes aim at the 
incumbent. 1 of 227 republicans who voted for an impeachment inquiry. 
Rick white and Newt Gingrich shouldn't be dragging us through this. 
Jay endsley's race in the Seattle area is one of the country's closest. 
The American people are smart. They get it and it's just too bad that 
the Congress is not listening to them. The attack is a calculated 
risk. I think every democratic candidate up in November will be watching 
these ads to see whether or not they rally the democratic base or 
change the nature of the election. The candidates are clearly hoping 
to tap into an electorate sick of the Lewinsky saga. A new "Newsweek" 
poll shows only 11% of Americans asked want impeachment hearing to 
continue. 56% want to the president censured or no further action 
at all. So nervous candidates are walking a fine line trying to energize 
voters by telling them what they want to hear without angering them 
by harping on a scandal they have already heard too much about. Karla 
Davis, ABC News, Capitol Hill.
