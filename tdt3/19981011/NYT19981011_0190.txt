Five months ago, people here triumphantly celebrated in the streets 
when the Hindu nationalist-led government conducted nuclear tests. 
In recent days, thousands of Delhiites have again poured into the 
streets, but this time they are cursing the very same political party. 
The issue that angers them is the price of the lowly onion _ an essential 
ingredient of the flavor base, or masala, of almost every dish cooked 
here. On some days, onions have reached a record 60 rupees a kilo, 
or about $1.45 for 2.2 pounds, a price that is seven times higher 
than it was this time last year. In a desperate effort to appease 
angry voters, the state and national governments, both headed by the 
Bharatiya Janata Party, are selling a limited supply of onions in 
New Delhi for just 10 rupees, or about 25 cents, a kilo. The national 
government also decided on Thursday to import 10,000 tons of onions 
from the Middle East and to suspend exports temporarily. But shoppers 
on long lines waiting to buy the subsidized onions are still spitting 
mad. Most of them often have to wait two, four, even six hours in 
the onion lines _ and sometimes they sell out. ``I'm sweating here 
just to buy the bloody onions and I didn't even get any,'' said Gursharn 
Kaur, a 56-year-old housewife, as a government truck pulled away. 
An unusually hot summer and late monsoon rains have damaged harvests 
and contributed to shortages, driving up the price of onions, cauliflower, 
peas, coriander, chilies and other vegetables. The state and national 
governments here have responded with the heavily subsidized onions, 
which newspapers are calling a sop to voters and many economists consider 
a gimmick. But the politicians know their audience. ``Onions are a 
metaphor for the world turned upside down,'' said Yogendra Yadav, 
a political scientist at the Center for the Study of Developing Societies, 
a research institution in New Delhi. ``They become a symbol of what 
is happening to the basic things of life.''
