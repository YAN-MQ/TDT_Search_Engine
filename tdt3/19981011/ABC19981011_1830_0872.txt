In news overseas, there was more gunfire reported in Kosovo today. 
Tomorrow, NAto ministers are expected to authorize air strikes against 
Serb targets. A final diplomatic push is still under way as NATO prepares 
for possible action. ABC's Mike Lee reports from Belgrade. Ratcheting 
up the pressure on the Serbs today, the U.S. moved these A-10 tank 
Buster aircraft to Aviano air base in Italy and B-52 bombers to Britain. 
I think just by the virtue of being here, we send a very powerful 
signal that NATO means business. In Belgrade, still talking but still 
warning that air strikes are getting closer, American envoy Richard 
Holbrooke has met through the weekend with Serb leader Slobodan Milosevic. 
Few details, but the deadlock appears to be over whether Serb police 
in Kosovo province should be replaced by NATO ground troops who would 
supervise any peace settlement. Today, in Kosovo, Albanians continued 
to suffer and die in refugee camps. Tens of thousands afraid to return 
to their homes, which have been attacked by Serbs. Most international 
relief agencies have fled the area, creating a potential food crisis. 
Albanians also face reprisals if NATO does strike. The armed Albanian 
rebel group, the KLA, is virtually defeated. Today, some of them made 
a show of laying down their arms in support of U.S. peace efforts. 
In the Serbian capital of Belgrade, no sign of panic by Serbs over 
NATO threats, only defiance toward the west. "We Serbs will never 
kneel down," he says. A political analyst here says that when attacked 
from outside, Serbs will back their leader, Milosevic, right or wrong. 
Many people believe that after this intervention, possible intervention, 
he will be much stronger in Serbia. With NAto expected to issue a 
"activation order" on Monday, the trigger will be cocked and air strikes 
possible within days here. Mike Lee, ABC News, Belgrade.
