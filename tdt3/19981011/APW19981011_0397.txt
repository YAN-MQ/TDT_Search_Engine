Several bags of gunpowder stored in a house to make fireworks exploded 
in a southern Indian town Sunday killing 11 people, including six 
children, and injuring three others, domestic news agencies reported. 
Police said the explosion was so powerful that the house collapsed 
on the victims, trapping them under the rubble, the Press Trust of 
India said. The explosion took place in the city of Vijayawada, 1,400 
kilometers (850 miles) south of the Indian capital, New Delhi. It 
was not clear from the reports if the people killed were workers making 
fireworks for the ongoing festival season in India. Six of the victims 
were children who are frequently employed by factory owners as cheap 
labor in the manufacture of fireworks. Rescue workers were sifting 
through the rubble to look for survivors.
