Joining the chorus of Yugoslav officials protesting NATO threats of 
intervention, Yugoslavia's defense minister said Sunday there was 
``no real justification'' to bomb his country. ``Bombs cannot bring 
peace. Bombs can only bring conflicts, war and instability, not only 
in Kosovo but in a wider Balkan region,'' said Pavle Bulatovic, the 
defense minister and aide to the country's president, Slobodan Milosevic, 
referring to the looming NATO action as a way to end the Kosovo crisis. 
``It should be in nobody's interest to make Balkan a powder keg again,'' 
Bulatovic said, alluding to the region's turbulent history. His comments 
came amid intense negotiations in Belgrade between top US envoy, Richard 
Holbrooke and Milosevic on a peaceful solution for Kosovo, a province 
within Serbia and the Yugoslav federation. Speaking at a ceremony 
in Yugoslav army barracks in northern Serbia where several hundred 
young recruits were starting their obligatory one-year service in 
the Yugoslav army, Bulatovic said ``the threats are not justified.'' 
Also on Sunday, unspecified NATO officers who are in Belgrade with 
Holbrooke, met with a team of top Yugoslav army officers, a spokesman 
for the US negotiating team said, but declined to identify them or 
to elaborate.
