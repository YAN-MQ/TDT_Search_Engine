An act of Congress could forever change the business of baseball. 
And some people think it could mean an end to picket lines at the 
ballpark. Cynthia Tornquist explains. Mark McGwire and Sammy Sosa 
made this season one for the record books. Now Congress has made its 
own Mark on baseball history, when it passed a Bill revoking a 1922 
Supreme Court ruling that exempted the game from antitrust laws. The 
fans witnessed disruptions in play in '72, '76, '80, '81, '85, '90, 
'94 and '95. This will make it much less likely they'll have to witness 
that again. Congressman Jim Bunning, a former pitcher who was inducted 
into the hall of fame, says players can now resort to the courts instead 
of strikes or boycotts. There is an ultimate arbitrator, and that 
is a federal district court of the United States. Sports analysts 
say the 1922 ruling had deprived players of some of the protections 
enjoyed by athletes of other professional sports, and has been blamed 
for baseball's many work stoppages, including the 1994-95 strike. 
Owners could do whatever they wanted. They could lock players out, 
or during a strike, they could negotiate in what the players would 
argue is not in good faith, and there's not that much they could do 
about it. But "sports illustrated" baseball writer Tom verducci says 
the Bill is no guarantee that players won't boycott or strike in the 
future. I just don't see it as being a great deterrent. The Bill lifts 
the exemption for the majors, but not the minor leagues. It also deals 
only with labor relations, not issues concerning team relocation or 
league expansion. So baseball can still decide where franchises are 
going it can still decide where minor league teams are going to be 
located. Both owners and players support the legislation. Unfortunately 
for fans, it will not help to reduce ticket prices. While passage 
of the Bill is smart business for baseball, sports analysts say it 
is also a goodwill gesture, to show fans that owners and players can 
put aside their squabbles and play ball. Cynthia Tornquist, CNN, New
