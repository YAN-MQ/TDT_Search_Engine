The cost of business travel is going up. Kalin Thomas-Samuel explains 
why in today's edition of "working ahead." Business travel costs could 
rise 6% in 1999. That's according to the American express annual trends 
and forecasts preview. American express predicts about a 5% increase 
in business airfares, as much as a 6% jump in corporate rental car 
rates and about a 3% rise in restaurant meals over this year's prices. 
And hotel rates could rise 10%. Strong demand for airline seats and 
hotel rooms are keeping prices high. As airline ticket prices continue 
to rise, flying satisfaction is falling. The department of transportation 
says airline passenger complaints more than doubled over a one-year 
period. According to the monthly "air travel consumer report," Flyers 
mad more than 760 complaints against the top ten U.S. airlines in 
August, while they filed just under 370 complaints a year earlier. 
Complaints include flight problems, overbooking, mishandled baggage 
and bad customer service. It's a banner year for train travel. Amtrak 
reports more than 2 million passengers boarded the northeast corridor 
metroliner trains between last October and the end of September. It's 
the second record year for this alternative to flying. 15 metroliners 
make the three-hour daily run with stops in between. Kalin Thomas-Samuel, 
CNN, reporting.
