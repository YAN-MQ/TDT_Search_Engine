Germany's Social Democrats and Greens met Sunday to settle plans for 
higher energy taxes and discuss scrapping nuclear power, two of the 
toughest topics in talks on forming a new center-left government. 
The issues are vital to the environmentalist Greens, junior partner 
in the negotiations. But Chancellor-elect Gerhard Schroeder, who campaigned 
as a friend of business, says he's giving priority to jobs and economic 
growth. Both party platforms call for shutting down Germany's 19 nuclear 
power plants, a prospect that already has utilities threatening to 
sue the government for billions of marks. Schroeder says he wants 
to try to reach an agreement with the nuclear industry to begin decommissioning 
nuclear plants. But Greens leaders are looking for a firm and swift 
timetable. With double-digit unemployment weighing down the new government 
from the start, both sides say they want tax reform as a way to spur 
the economy and create jobs. Negotiators reportedly agreed on a modest 
rise in gasoline prices of 6 pfennigs (3.75 cents) even before party 
leaders met in a building on the Rhine River in Bonn. Schroeder, who 
sits on the supervisory board of Volkswagen, has balked at a sharper 
increase demanded by the Greens. But proposals to raise prices of 
heating oil and electricity were also on the table Sunday. Walter 
Riester, Schroeder's designated labor minister, was quoted Sunday 
as saying that the ``ecological tax reform'' was needed even if it 
killed jobs at first. ``The worst would be failure to carry out important 
structural changes,'' he told Frankfurter Allgemeine Sonntagszeitung. 
German industry organizations lashed out at the emerging tax plans 
over the weekend. Hans-Olaf Henkel, head of the Federation of German 
Industry, said they amounted to a ``massive increase in the burden 
on business'' and would lead to layoffs. However, the Social Democrats 
say energy-intensive industries, including automakers, would be largely 
spared from the new taxes. The incoming government wants to raise 
energy prices to finance a cut in contributions to lavish welfare-state 
benefits _ a burden shared by companies and employees. The charges 
make German labor among the world's most expensive. Negotiators have 
already agreed on the outlines of other tax measures: relief for average 
wage earners, closing loopholes, and curbing tax breaks for business 
and well-off individuals.
