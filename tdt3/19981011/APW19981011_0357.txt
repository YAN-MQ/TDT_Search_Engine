Pakistan canceled its contract with the country's largest private 
power company and charged some of its senior officials with fraud 
and giving kickbacks, a senior government official said Sunday. The 
cancellations followed months of wrangling between the government 
and the Hub Power Company (Hubco) in which Prime Minister Nawaz Sharif 
accused the largely British-owned company of charging inflated prices 
for electricity it sold to the cash-strapped state utility. The contract 
was signed by former Prime Minister Benazir Bhutto's government. The 
government lodged two criminal cases of ``fraud, commissions and electricity 
theft'' against senior company officials, including chief executive 
D.M. Woodroofe, resident engineer Tom Macky and finance director Khursheed 
Hussain in the southern port city of Karachi, the government's accountability 
chief, Senator Saif-ur Rehman, told a news conference. Several key 
officials of Ms. Bhutto's former government also have been charged, 
he said. Rehman said Hubco paid millions of dollars in kickbacks to 
officials in Ms. Bhutto's government to charge inflated rates. ``We 
have proof of their corruption and have formed a strong team of legal 
experts to fight the cases,'' he said. The state-run Water and Power 
Development Authority buys electricity from Hubco at 6.60 rupees (14 
cents) per kilowatt compared to the 1.36 rupees per kilowatt fixed 
in 1992 by Sharif, who was in power at the time, he said. ``We have 
decided to cancel the agreements made during the Bhutto government 
and will pay according to the old agreement of 1992,'' Rehman said. 
There was no immediate comment from Hubco officials. Rehman said the 
Bhutto government awarded contracts to foreign power companies to 
supply more power than Pakistan required. He said Hubco has dropped 
its production to 400 kilowatts from 1,200 to create power shortage. 
Since returning to power in 1997 Sharif's government has been trying 
to renegotiate power rates with several privately run power suppliers. 
The feud has been laced with accusations by the government of widespread 
payments of kickbacks to members of Ms. Bhutto's government in exchange 
for the inflated rates.
