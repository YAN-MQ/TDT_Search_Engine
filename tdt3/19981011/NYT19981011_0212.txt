I found myself one recent Monday on a stretch of rural highway in 
eastern Colorado at the time of morning when round bales lying in 
the hayfields look like cattle grazing, and vice versa. I was driving 
toward the sunrise, still only a premonition in the distance. The 
horizon in that direction was a long, low ridgeline dotted either 
with trees that resembled a band of clouds or clouds that had affixed 
themselves with stems to earth or possibly very large sheep moving 
single file with a grim and stately purpose. Over the ridge and into 
the next swale rode the pickup, and there I saw a small corral with 
four horses, all of them looking intently _ wishfully, I suspect _ 
at the kitchen light that had just been switched on in a dark ranch 
house across the barnyard. On a fence post near the road sat a red-tailed 
hawk, surprisingly bulbous. The rising light caught in his eye, and 
to me he looked dour, hungry for a diet less rich in rodents, a palate-cleansing 
carrot perhaps or a plate of watercress. I've always loved the crescendo 
Monday brings, but I've always thought of it in strictly urban terms. 
By the time darkness has begun to wear away on a New York Monday morning, 
the city has rumbled to life, shaking off Sunday like a distant childhood. 
Soon the streets are filled with people, some of whom look as though 
their coattails had caught in the city's gears and dragged them headlong 
from their beds. Millions of weekday morning habits iterate themselves 
anew, yet even the familiarity of it all seems somehow fresh. But 
in deep country, near, say, Last Chance, Colo., the week evolves more 
slowly. Monday's chores look much like Sunday's. The headlong rush 
to get kids off to school is no different on the Colorado plains from 
anywhere else. But once the school bus has come and gone, once the 
high school kids have driven themselves off to class in a neighboring 
town, silence falls over the highway again. The low angle of the sun 
seems to give every object it strikes a higher profile. Its light 
throws the long shadow of a pickup and horse trailer into the far 
ditch, where the driver waves to himself. On yet another fence post, 
another hawk preens, and on the unplowed side of the road antelope 
move stiffly up a ridge and out of sight. Then the highway is still, 
except for the wind, and what day of the week it is is anybody's guess 
until the next vehicle passes, when, for a moment _ in the presence 
of a service truck or a postal carrier or a delivery van _ Monday 
reappears.
