22-year-old Matthew shepard's condition has worsened slightly. Doctors 
at a FT. Collins, Colorado, hospital are treating the critically wounded 
Wyoming college student for hypothermia and massive head injuries. 
Authorities in laramie say shepard was pistol whipped and lashed to 
a fence because he is gay. Two men have been charged in the Wednesday 
attack. A woman has been charged as an accessory and a second woman 
could face the same charge. In a statement, shepard's parents expressed 
gratitude for the outpouring of support for their son. We want to 
thank the American public for their kind thoughts about Matthew and 
their fond wishes for his speedy recovery. We appreciate your prayers 
and goodwill. And we know they are something Matthew would appreciate, 
too. Matthew is a very special person, and everyone can learn important 
lessons from his life. All of us who know Matthew see him as he is 
-- a very kind and gentle soul. He is a strong believer in humanity 
and human rights. He is a trusting person who takes everybody at face 
value, and he does not see the bad side of anyone. His one intolerance 
is when people don't accept others as they are. He has always strongly 
felt that all people are the same regardless of their sexual preference, 
race, or religion. About 100 people marched in this weekend's homecoming 
parade at the University of Wyoming to protest the beating. Shepard 
is a student at the school.
