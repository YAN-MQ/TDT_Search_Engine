The star's angelic face was everywhere. The reviews were mostly glowing. 
The show was being called the next ``Dawson's Creek'' or the next 
``Ally McBeal.'' In every way ``Felicity,'' a new drama on the fast-charging 
WB network about a girl's journey to college and self-discovery, was 
the single new show to go into the television season resounding with 
buzz _ the swirl of publicity, promotion and press coverage that usually 
converts into a cultural phenomenon and the next big thing on television. 
The hype was so exquisitely successful that during a season-opening 
lunch in Hollywood, program executives at rival networks identified 
``Felicity'' as the new show they would most like to steal. Now, though, 
only two weeks into the run of the series, ``Felicity'' stands not 
only as a classic example of a perfectly orchestrated symphony of 
buzz, but perhaps of its limitations. No other new show this fall 
attracted anything like the attention given to ``Felicity,'' whose 
star, Keri Russell, was on the covers of ``Seventeen'' and ``Detour'' 
magazines before the show went on the air. And indeed, the build-up 
resulted in the best rating for any new show in WB's short history. 
But unlike ``Dawson's Creek,'' the object of a similarly crafted campaign 
last season, ``Felicity'' is apparently not escalating _ or even holding 
_ the pre-premiere excitement. In week two, ``Felicity'' fell 2 percentage 
points in its national share of audience. It lost 4 percentage points 
among teen-agers. Surprisingly, ``Felicity'' finds itself trailing 
other new series in appealing to teen-agers including ABC's ``Two 
of a Kind'' and ``Brother's Keeper.'' More pointedly, last Tuesday, 
the second episode of ``Felicity'' finished behind ``Costello'' _ 
a comedy on Fox considered such a flop that it was the first series 
of the season canceled last week _ in the categories of overall number 
of viewers; viewers between the ages of 18 and 49, considered the 
most important sales category for advertisers, and even women between 
18 and 34, a category more suited to WB's other successful shows. 
WB merits a break when measured against the larger networks because 
the latter's station lineups are much stronger. But even Paul Schulman, 
whose agency buys time for advertisers, and the man whose early endorsement 
of ``Felicity'' was used by WB as the fuse to ignite its promotion 
campaign, expressed concern about the drop-off. In a comparison that 
made ``Felicity'' sound like a high-tech initial public offering whose 
price was bid up before it hit the market, Schulman said: ``A six 
share in the second week is respectable. If week three is a four share, 
I'd say, if that's a stock, it might be time to sell.'' That's not 
likely to happen. In an exercise that illustrates the symbiosis between 
the world of network television and national magazines, both of which 
gear themselves disproportionately to attracting younger consumers, 
Entertainment Weekly and TV Guide have already discussed cover deals 
with ``Felicity'' for upcoming issues. TV Guide's plan is for Ms. 
Russell to share the cover on the Nov. 7 issue with David Boreanaz, 
of another WB series, ``Buffy, The Vampire Slayer,'' as two representatives 
of ``young Hollywood.'' Steven Reddicliffe, the editor of TV Guide, 
said the magazine has done extremely well in the past with youth-oriented 
covers on ``Dawson's Creek,'' ``South Park'' and ``Buffy.'' He said 
the goal of increasing newsstand sales was one reason to go for a 
``Felicity'' cover this early in its life. Another, he said, is ``it's 
a good show.'' Those reasons all apply to the decision-making at Entertainment 
Weekly as well. Mary Kaye Schilling, the assistant managing editor 
who oversees the magazine's television coverage, said, ``We made them 
an offer of a cover.'' But one thing does concern her. ``The second 
episode was very slow,'' she said. ``They need to do another good 
episode. `Dawson' took off and just kept going. We need to see what 
happens before we commit to the cover.'' Ms. Schilling was among the 
first targets of WB's skillful efforts to make ``Felicity'' its new 
``Dawson's Creek.'' She was sent a copy of the show's script before 
it was even filmed, and she made the decision to assign a writer to 
follow the show's path to the air. The early tipoff of possible breakthrough 
hits to media outlets that want to be identified with the next hot, 
young show has been a hallmark of WB's innovative approach to establishing 
public awareness of its shows. First, WB takes the daring step of 
singling out just one new show for special saturation promotion. Of 
the $4.5 million the network spent to promote its new season, said 
Bob Bibb, the co-executive vice president of marketing for WB, ``about 
half went to `Felicity.''' Getting advertisers _ and the press _ excited 
is at the heart of the strategy. It begins, said Brad Turrell, the 
senior vice president of publicity for WB, with the program department 
``delivering a really good show.'' Convinced that ``Felicity'' was 
just that, Turrell said, the network, weeks before the May presentations 
of fall schedules to the advertising industry, sent off the pilot 
to Schulman, who acknowledged that ``I'm known as someone who will 
take a public stand on something if I like it.'' He liked ``Felicity'' 
and Keri Russell very much. ``She couldn't have been more precious,'' 
he said. Schulman was so immediately taken with the show, he said, 
that he contacted several of his clients, including Ralston-Purina, 
Gap, and Pier One. ``All of them are now sponsors,'' he said. The 
same day the show was unveiled to advertisers in New York (with Ms. 
Russell a special guest at Schulman's table), WB's press office sent 
out 600 tapes of the pilot to critics around the country. That set 
off the steady stream of mentions that WB had found the next ``Dawson's 
Creek.'' After that, the show was marketed as though WB was releasing 
a movie, with posters in movie theaters, hanging mobiles above the 
popcorn machines, even trailers that played along with the coming 
attractions. To reach rock music fans, WB not only purchased a Madonna 
song, ``The Power of Love,'' to use as the ``Felicity'' theme song, 
it also bought up the rights to the background music on the hold-button 
message on Ticketmaster's phone lines for people calling to buy tickets 
to rock concerts. The network also bought commercials on Channel One, 
the news channel fed daily into high schools. To bring in Seventeen, 
WB made a deal that got Ms. Russell on the cover. In return, Seventeen 
got to join with WB to produce an hourlong special on the network 
about teen-oriented movies and television shows in the coming season. 
Beyond the cover treatment, ``Felicity'' received splashy, pre-debut 
features in numerous other magazines including Vanity Fair and Time, 
the latter writing: ``Polished execution and an enormously appealing 
cast may make the hype prophetic rather than a curse.'' But might 
the glittering build-up have created unreasonable expectations for 
a show that may take time to find its true footing? Ms. Schilling 
thinks so. ``We really loved the pilot,'' she said. ``But the show 
has to find its way. It has to lighten up.'' Schulman said, ``Serial 
dramas take time to build. `Melrose Place' was getting numbers in 
its first year that were very cancellable.'' Fox stayed with that 
show and it emerged as a true hit, not just a buzz hit, even though 
it was on the cover of People magazine before it went on the air. 
The connection is no accident. Many of the top WB executives learned 
the business of buzz creation in the early days of Fox. They know 
how to tap into advertising and media outlets hungering for the next 
big hit with the young audience. So get ready, Turrell said, for a 
show called ``Zoe Bean,'' a midseason comedy WB is already labeling 
`` `Seinfeld' for teens.'' ``Once the dust settles on `Felicity,' 
'' Turrell said, ``we'll start hitting key people with `Zoe.' We'll 
be getting the first tapes out in early November.''
