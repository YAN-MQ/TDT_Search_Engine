Iraq's economy is in tatters the results of economic sanctions imposed 
after Iraq invaded Kuwait in 1990. The effects of these sanctions 
on the Iraqi people has been severe. Rula Amin looks how two Iraqi 
women are coping. At this Baghdad factory, five women found a living, 
making men's undershirts. Tunes of the classical love songs struggle 
with the heartbeat of their machines but the romance coming from the 
radio is hardly a match to these women's reality. A reality shaped 
by harsh U.N. sanctions that had crippled Iraq's one prosperous economy 
and drove Iraqi women out of their lives. Sawsan Rasheed comes to 
work at 9:00 A.M., she works nonstop until 8:00 P.M., has been doing 
so for the last seven years. She makes $15 a month. The last time 
she bought a dress or a shoe? Three or four years ago. She says she 
can't even remember the last time she went shopping. Sawsan is 40 
years old, single, and she says because of sanctions, there is no 
chance that she will ever marry. It's too expensive, she says, few 
in Iraq can afford to establish a new household these days. Besides, 
she says, her family can't afford to lose her income. For other Iraqi 
women, especially those with higher education, and making much less 
money, it's staying at the job that is difficult. Arkan bithon, a 
mother of two children, has a bachelor's degree in French literature. 
In addition, she has spent two years in France getting an advanced 
degree. As a professional translator, and a public servant, arkan 
makes 3,500 Iraqi dinars -- that is about $1.50 a month -- depending 
on the devaluating situation of the Iraqi dinar. Every day, she pays 
at least a 1000 Iraqi dinar or one-third of her monthly salary, just 
for cabs. Arkan basically spends money to keep on working. I go to 
work, because I find identity there. I feel I am still arkan, that 
I am not finished yet. If I stop translating, communicating, I feel 
I become a different person. It's some kind of stubbornness, you can 
call it determination. But even as she comes to work, the sanctions 
regime come after her. Newspapers or magazines are a rare commodity 
in Iraq, and forget about new books. We wait for any delegation, a 
friend or acquaintance to visit Baghdad, maybe they will bring us 
a magazine or a newspaper, I miss these things. To keep busy and alive, 
she translates old material, like this magazine, dated April 1990. 
And whatever arkan translates, sits on the shelves for years. Can't 
be printed because there's no paper to print on. Rula Amin for CNN, 
Baghdad.
