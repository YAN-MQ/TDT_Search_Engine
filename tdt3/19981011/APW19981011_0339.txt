Traveling by car, planes and ferries, Greeks returned to their hometowns 
Sunday to cast ballots in a huge range of municipal elections that 
were seen as a gauge of the strength of the governing Socialist party. 
The races _ ranging from the Athens mayoral contest to hundreds of 
city hall and district seats around the country _ were being widely 
interpreted as a referendum on government policies, particularly the 
economic austerity measures designed to earn the European Union's 
poorest country a spot in the bloc's single currency group by 2001. 
Many labor groups _ traditional Socialist backers _ have objected 
to Premier Costas Simitis' aggressive privatization plans and efforts 
to trim Greece's overstaffed public sector. A strong showing by conservative 
and other opposition candidates could be a significant setback for 
the powerful Socialists two years before general elections. It could 
also force a rethinking of the hard-line strategy to take part in 
the monetary union. Millions of Greeks returned to their places of 
birth to vote because of complicated red tape involved in registering 
their new residences. More than half of Greece's 10.2 million people 
live in the greater Athens area. Voting in Greece is mandatory. Even 
the city's mayor, Dimitris Avramopoulos, couldn't vote for himself. 
He traveled to the tiny mountain village of Elliniko, about 150 kilometers 
(95 miles) southwest of Athens, to cast his ballot. Avramopoulos, 
who is expected to be re-elected in a landslide vote, is considered 
a possible conservative challenger to Simitis in the 2000 elections. 
Other major cities electing mayors included the port of Piraeus near 
Athens and the northern city of Salonica, where two campaign offices 
were slightly damaged by arson attacks early Sunday. Many races were 
close and will be decided in a run-off vote next Sunday. In total, 
voters cast ballots in about 900 mayoral and 54 regional governor 
races. At least a dozen villages staged protests against a government 
program to merge their local communities into larger and more powerful 
municipalities. Voting was postponed until Wednesday in one tiny community 
on the island of Crete, where many inhabitants have a fierce regional 
identity. At one village in northern Greece, locals blocked the roads 
with tractors in an attempt to stop election officials from setting 
up ballot boxes.
