Peruvians voted in municipal elections across the country Sunday, 
with eyes fixed on the mayoral race in Lima, where the popular mayor 
tested the political waters. Sunday's election results could have 
an influence on whether Lima Mayor Alberto Andrade decides to challenge 
President Alberto Fujimori if the president seeks re-election in 2000. 
Andrade, who made his name by cleaning up the once garbage strewn 
and street vendor congested streets of Lima's center, was leading 
in pre-election polls by a comfortable margin. He was elected mayor 
of Lima in 1995. Andrade's chief opponent in the municipal elections, 
Juan Carlos Hurtado Miller, served as minister of economy under Fujimori 
in the early 1990s. Hurtado is running on the ticket of a political 
movement that is believed to be a front for Fujimori. During Hurtado's 
tenure as economy minister, the government instituted severe austerity 
measures credited with ending hyperinflation and generating economic 
growth. Voting got off to a slow start Sunday and voters grew impatient 
in the long lines outside various voting stations in Lima. The delays 
were attributed to irregularities including the absence of election 
personnel and voting materials. Army troops stood guard at voting 
booths across the country, but the early hours of voting proceeded 
without incident. Through the 1980s and early 1990s extreme-left Shining 
Path guerrillas carried out terror campaigns to block voting, killing 
hundreds of mayors and candidates. Violence has dropped off sharply 
since the capture of the group's major leaders in 1992 and 1993. Only 
one mayor was assassinated during this year's campaign in comparison 
to 410 mayors and candidates in the 1989 municipal elections. In addition 
to the much watched Lima race, voters elected 1,811 other mayors and 
city councils. About 13.4 million Peruvians are registered to vote. 
Voting is mandatory. Those who didn't vote face fines of dlrs 35.
