Shawn Mullins has taken an unusual route to musical success. He joined 
the army and put out his own albums. Mark Scheerer has more. Everything's 
gonna be all right rock-A-bye rock-A-bye Be all that you can be. In 
the army, Shawn Mullins really wanted to be a musician. I went to 
north Georgia college, and I was already interested in the military, 
'cause my dad had been in the army and my brother was in the Navy. 
So I went up there and got in their military program and signed a 
contract with the army that way. Went though college and then commissioned. 
So I was an officer in the army for a short amount of time. She grew 
up with the children of the stars in the Hollywood hills and the boulevard 
Mullins started putting out his own CDs, and one of them included 
this song, "lullaby," which caught the attention of 99x, an influential 
Atlanta radio station. They started playing "lullaby" and they told 
Mullins to get ready for a record company bidding war. And I was like, 
"yeah, right. You know, I've been doing this for nine years and I 
haven't got no calls yet." Sure enough, though, within about eight 
days of them playing the record five or six times a day -- I mean, 
they were really spinning it -- I had 26 calls from major record companies 
on my answering machine. Columbia records signed Mullins and rereleased 
his CD, "soul's core." And, of course, produced a video for the song 
that made it all happen. Her parents threw big parties everyone was 
there they hung out with folks like Dennis Hopper and Bob Seger and 
Sonny and Cher now comes the hard part. Can Mullins build on the success 
of "lullaby" and his own do-it-yourself aesthetic? Can he avoid the 
one-hit wonder syndrome? Springsteen's never written another "born 
in the USA." He's written some amazing songs since then, though, that 
are well respected. I think it's a matter of growing as an artist 
and a writer. And after all, Shawn Mullins has already done the basic 
training on his own. Everything's gonna be all right rock-A-bye rock-A-bye 
rock-A-bye Mark Scheerer, "CNN Entertainment News," New York.
