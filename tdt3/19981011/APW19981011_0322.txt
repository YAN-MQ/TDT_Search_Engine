Sadler's Wells, the second-oldest working theater in London, reopens 
Monday 315 years young with a dance program and an entirely new look 
after a 48 million pounds (dlrs 80 million) modernization. The low-key 
building of 1930, the sixth theater on the site, has been almost totally 
demolished except for the steel framework and bits of the auditorium. 
The 1,500-seat theater is also capitalizing on the natural asset that 
gives it half its name _ water from springs beneath the building is 
being bottled for sale to patrons and to supply the air conditioning 
via a new 650-foot (200-meter) deep borehole. The old well itself 
has been made a visible feature of the theater. It used to be under 
a gangway carpet, and you could feel the floorboards wobble when you 
walked over it. Now, it's hoped patrons will toss money into it to 
help out with a different liquidity flow. Another modest moneymaking 
gambit is to have the theater licensed to conduct marriages. Richard 
Sadler founded the theater in 1683. From the 1920s onward, through 
the efforts of Lilian Baylis and Dame Ninette de Valois, it became 
famous for drama, dance, opera and lyric theater despite being in 
Islington, one-and-a-half miles (2.4 kms) northeast of Leicester Square, 
the hub of London's theaterland. The rebuilding project has created 
a landmark by extending the fly tower used for moving stage sets and 
displaying the theater's name on it in bold letters. The auditorium 
has big screens so that films can be mixed with opera, dance and drama. 
It has a proscenium arch, but also a maneuverable platform, doubling 
the stage area and permitting theater-in-the-round performances for 
the first time. The first scheduled in-the-round work is ``On the 
Road to Baghdad'' from a picaresque novel by Turkish-born Guneli Gun, 
who lives in Oberlin, Ohio. It will be staged in March. ``It really 
is a performance space for the next millennium,'' said chief executive 
Ian Albery. ``We wanted to be able to welcome the best companies in 
national and international dance and lyric theater.'' The bulk of 
the cost of the new building, 36 million pounds (dlrs 60 million), 
came from the National Lottery. The theater had to raise the rest 
and has still to find 4 million pounds (dlrs 6.6 million). Sadler's 
first theater was a ``Musike House'' opened 20 years after the Theater 
Royal opened in Drury Lane. Then Islington _ now densely urbanized 
_ was a place of green fields, orchards, mansions and gardens. Sadler 
discovered a well in the garden of his first theater and turned it 
into a medicinal spa. On finding two more wells, he named them Sadler's 
New Tunbridge Wells after a popular spa in Kent. The name was shortened 
as theater buildings succeeded one another over the centuries.
