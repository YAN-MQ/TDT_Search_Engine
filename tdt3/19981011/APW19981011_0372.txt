Premier Pakalitha Mosisili fled to safety Sunday after a gunshot injured 
a participant at a party rally. The shot scattered about 5,000 supporters 
of the Lesotho Congress Party, while some members rushed to protect 
Mosisili and his deputy, Kelibone Maope. The LCD called the attack 
an assassination attempt by opposition parties who have sporadically 
blockaded the capital of Maseru since early August. An opposition 
leader denied the allegation, saying the remarks were a smear campaign 
against the alliance. ``This is absolute trash,'' said alliance spokesman 
Vincent Malebo. ``We are not assassins.'' A shooting suspect was arrested 
and questioned, the South African Press Association reported. Along 
with a rally Sunday by the opposition alliance, the ruling party gathering 
fueled ongoing tensions in Lesotho. Scores were killed after last 
month's South African-led intervention to end an army mutiny and paralyzing 
protests by the opposition, which charged May elections won by the 
LCD were rigged. The opposition rally took place under heavy security 
from South African troops in armored vehicles. ``Our rally will proceed 
in spite of intimidation by ... forces and the government, because 
we want to prove our popularity,'' Malebo said. At its rally, the 
ruling party said it would oppose amnesty for rebel soldiers who removed 
the army's top leadership in September. In an address to the nation, 
King Letsie III on Saturday appealed for unity and asked about 100 
protesters to leave his royal palace, where they set up camp in August. 
Malebo said those encamped at the palace would return home after the 
opposition rally. The two sides are to meet on Wednesday with representatives 
of the Southern African Development Community, a 14-nation coalition, 
to discuss peaceful resolution.
