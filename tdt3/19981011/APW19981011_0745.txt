David Duval shot a final-round 3-under-par 68 Sunday, good enough 
for a three-shot victory in the Michelob Championship _ his seventh 
victory in 364 days. Once known as Mr. Runner-up because of his seven 
second-place finishes before a breakthrough playoff victory here last 
year, Duval improved on his Sunday scoring average of 69.5, which 
already ranked him fifth on U.S. tour. With a 16-under 268, he also 
became the first successful defender on the 6,853-yard (6,168-meter) 
River Course at Kingsmill since Calvin Peete in 1983, and he still 
has titles to defend at Walt Disney World and in the Tour championship 
later this month. ``If this is some type of dream, I certainly don't 
want to wake up anytime soon,'' said Duval, who won dlrs 342,000 to 
boost his earnings for the season to dlrs 2,464,408, extending his 
American PGA Tour record. It's also nearly dlrs 700,000 more than 
Vijay Singh, his closest rival who has played 24 events to Duval's 
21. New Zealand's Phil Tataurangi finished alone in second after a 
closing 69, the best finish of his career. The dlrs 205,200 in prize 
money also moved him from No. 165 to No. 86 on the money list, meaning 
he'll retain his American tour card for 1999. ``I dare say he played 
a better round of golf than me today with all that riding on his shoulders,'' 
Duval said of his 26-year-old playing partner. But the story, once 
again, was clearly Duval, the first player to win seven times in one 
year since Tom Watson in 1979-80. ``Every time I looked at the leaderboard 
after making birdies, he's making birdies, too,'' said Payne Stewart, 
who shot 69 and finished five back in a tie for fourth with Australian 
Bradley Hughes. ``You can talk all you want to about Tiger Woods, 
but David's winning golf tournaments,'' Stewart said, listing Duval, 
Woods and Justin Leonard as the young stars of the future. ``(Duval's) 
learned how to win.'' Playing in the final threesome with 19-year 
tour veteran Gary Hallberg and Tataurangi, Duval started with a one-shot 
lead and never lost it, even after stumbling with an early bogey on 
the par-3 fifth hole. He quickly made up for that with five birdies 
in the next eight holes. By then, with Stewart and fellow American 
Barry Cheesman also attacking par on the back nine, the only questions 
were who would finish second, and if Duval would break Scott Hoch's 
19-under 265 tournament record, set in 1996. He didn't, but did just 
about everything else right. Cheesman shot a 66 to jump into third 
place, and Billy Mayfair made five birdies on six holes beginning 
at No. 12 to claim a share of sixth with John Huston, Hallberg and 
Frank Lickliter. Hallberg, one shot off the lead at the start, did 
not make a birdie all day and shot a 3-over 74.
