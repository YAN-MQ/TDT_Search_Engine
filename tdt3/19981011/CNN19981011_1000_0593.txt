If you're a logger in China, it's time to find a new job. The government 
has banned logging in the upper reaches of the yangtze river after 
a deadly year of flooding. Rebecca MacKinnon has the story. For generations 
the songs sung by men hauling timber have rung through the mountains 
of western sachwan province. They won't sing much longer. On September 
1st the government outlawed the cutting of any more trees. Logging 
companies have until next June to get all remaining logs out of the 
area. This man used to make a living transporting timber. Now he says 
he's going to have to sell his truck and find a new government job, 
planting trees. Many hillsides have been stripped by logging, less 
rain water stays in the ground, more water and silt goes into the 
river causing floods downstream. Half a century of heavy logging along 
tributary rivers and streams along this one are believed to be a major 
reason for this year's devastating floods, nearly 600 meters away. 
Reversing the damage will take many more decades. We must urgently 
plant more trees in order to protect the forests we have. The central 
government has committed more than $2 billion to re-employ China's 
lumberjacks. Life for these men has never been easy. Loggers waiting 
out a frequent summer storm say they don't mind if they cut down trees 
or plant new ones as long as they get paid. But for local businesses 
which rely on timber to make things, the future is much less certain. 
This man makes furniture. "If the logging ban sticks," he says, "he 
might go out of business." A price the people of western sichuan will 
have to pay to save their countrymen from deadly floods. Rebecca mackinnon, 
CNN, sichuan, China.
