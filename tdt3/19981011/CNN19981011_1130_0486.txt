Thousands of Israelis were forced to evacuate their homes today when 
a forest fire engulfed a neighborhood for several hours. At least 
three people were injured as high winds carried flames from the forest 
into a populated area in haifa. The fire destroyed about 20 homes 
and damaged more than 100 others. It's not known what caused the fire.
