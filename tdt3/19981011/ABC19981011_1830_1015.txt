The Roman Catholic church has its first Jewish-born Saint modern times. 
Pope John Paul today canonized edith Stein. Born a Jew, she died a 
Catholic nun in auschwitz. Jewish leaders today criticized the church 
for making her a Saint saying as a converted Catholic, she is a wrong 
choice as the symbol of the Holocaust.
