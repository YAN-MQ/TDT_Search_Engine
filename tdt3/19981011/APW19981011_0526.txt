Romania decided Sunday to allow NATO to use its airspace in emergency 
situations if the alliance launches airstrikes against Yugoslavia. 
President Emil Constantinescu convened the country's Supreme Defense 
Council to consider a NATO request made Friday to allow alliance aircraft 
to use Romanian airspace. Later, a statement from the presidential 
office said ``We agree to NATO access in emergency and unpredictable 
situations.'' Following a four-hour meeting, the Supreme Defense Council 
added, however, that Romania's army would not participate in military 
action against its neighbor if NATO launches airstrikes to force President 
Slobodan Milosevic to agree to international demands on Kosovo. ``Romania 
cannot afford direct participation in fighting actions if these actions 
take place,'' the statement said, adding Romania supports a peaceful 
solution to the situation in the Serbian province. The council also 
decided to reinforce the army, signaling it was worried that the deteriorating 
crisis in Kosovo ``might generate risks and threats to Romania's national 
security.'' Romania is anxious to join NATO, but Yugoslav officials 
have warned neighboring countries against being drawn into the crisis 
over international demands for peace in Kosovo. Torn between its desire 
to join the alliance and its friendship with Serbia, Romanian leaders 
have voiced concern that the conflict could easily spill over into 
Romania. Romania has its own Hungarian minority and is afraid that 
if Kosovo's Albanians are given too much autonomy it could spark similar 
demands from the 1.7 million ethnic Hungarians. Constantinescu said 
he had conferred on the Kosovo issue by telephone with the president 
of neighboring Bulgaria, Petar Stoyanov. Romania reiterated it would 
send medics and backup equipment in the region in case of a NATO air 
strike. Romania shares a 425 kilometer- (265 mile-) border with Yugoslavia.
