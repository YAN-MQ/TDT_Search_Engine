David Wells tugged at the left sleeve of his gray Yankee jersey, tugged 
at the right sleeve and adjusted his pants. He had just started to 
pitch in the most important game of his career, but in the first inning 
on Sunday he looked more like a frustrated hitchhiker than a post-season 
stalwart. The Yankees had gift-wrapped a 3-0 lead for Wells during 
a wacky top of the first, and were privately expecting him to take 
the cushion, run with it and usher them back to New York in command 
of the series. Give us a smooth ride, Boomer, and it will be a smooth 
flight on Sunday night, the Yankees silently asked him. But there 
was nothing too smooth about the bottom of the first for Wells, and 
there was a reason for his sluggishness. Wells revealed that some 
Indians fans made disparaging remarks to him about his deceased mother, 
Eugenia Ann, as he warmed up in the bullpen. The words seeped inside 
his head and it hurt. After the Yankees regrouped and stopped the 
Indians, 5-3, some teammates talked about how the fans hung over the 
center-field bullpen and annoyed Wells by touching on a taboo topic 
before Game 5 of the American League Championship Series. During the 
first inning, Wells was irritated because he was thinking about the 
woman who was known as Attitude Annie, who died of heart disease related 
to diabetes at the age of 58 on Jan. 4, 1997 _ the woman to whom he 
prays before each start. ``When you get a bunch of clowns out there 
that start talking about your mother and not knowing that my mom passed 
away a year and a half ago, it really bothered me,'' Wells said. ``What 
got me more was some little kids out there started to do the same 
thing. I was in awe out there because I couldn't believe that could 
happen.'' Wells did not answer the hecklers until after the game. 
``I can deal with a lot of negative stuff out there, but when it involves 
my mom or anyone of my family members, it really bothers me,'' he 
said. ``So to those idiots out there, this one is for you.'' What 
started out as a bumpy journey turned into a smooth ride as Wells 
stopped thinking about the crass comments and steered the Yankees 
to a commanding 3-2 lead in the four-of-seven-game series. This was 
the new and improved Wells, not the Wells who used to quit. Wells 
rallied by squelching the Indians on one run and five hits, while 
striking out nine after the first inning. He finished with 11 strikeouts 
in seven and a third innings, won his second game in this series and 
is now 7-1 for his career in the post-season. ``He's an animal,'' 
Manager Joe Torre said. ``He goes after them.'' ``Wells had great 
guts,'' said George Steinbrenner, the Yankees' principal owner. ``The 
guy is becoming a leader on this team. If I would have said that three 
or four years ago, they would have jailed me.'' Wells was stunned 
when Torre ambled to the mound to remove him with one out in the eighth, 
especially since he had just struck out his third straight batter. 
He told Torre that he had only thrown ``one bad pitch,'' but the manager 
stayed firm as the other Yankees chuckled. When Wells returned to 
the dugout amid a sea of boos, he took his cap off and twirled it 
to the fans. ``He just wanted to stay in the game, whether he was 
joking or not,'' Chuck Knoblauch said. ``He always has something good 
to say. That's why all four of us ran in there so quick to catch what 
he had to say.'' The first started with the precise Wells, who had 
allowed as many walks (29) as homers (29) this season, going 3-0 on 
Kenny Lofton and then surrendering a homer on a 3-1 pitch. After back-to-back 
singles, a wild pitch and Manny Ramirez's sacrifice fly, the Indians 
trimmed the score to 3-2. Where was the Wells who held opponents to 
three earned runs in 251/3 innings in his last three post-season starts? 
Who had volunteered to pitch Game 4 on Saturday night? Who is ready 
to pitch Game 7, if necessary, on two days of rest? Eventually, he 
showed up. Maybe Wells was a little late, but he arrived. Wells got 
Mark Whiten to flail at a 2-2 pitch for the second out, but he walked 
Jim Thome to fill the bases. After visits from Scott Brosius, the 
pitching coach Mel Stottlemyre and catcher Jorge Posada, Wells made 
Richie Sexon's legs wobble with an 0-2 curve. How far has Wells come? 
Far enough to flaunt Steinbrenner's team rules. He has not shaved 
his goatee before his last two starts, something which Steinbrenner 
refused to criticize. The owner who believes in clean-cut appearances 
and once had Don Mattingly benched for not getting a haircut said, 
``there's nothing wrong with facial hair.'' There is also nothing 
wrong with having Wells pitch an important game, either. ``I'm getting 
to even like the metallic band,'' Steinbrenner said. Wells was walking 
past Steinbrenner in the crowded clubhouse and barked, ``It's Metallica.'' 
A surprised Steinbrenner said: ``I'm sorry, I'm sorry. Metallica.''
