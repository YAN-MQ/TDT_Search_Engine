Meanwhile, in the national league, San Diego can make the world series 
for the first time in 14 years with a win today. Joey Hamilton will 
get the start for the pads. Denny neagle goes for Atlanta. You know, 
one thing's for sure. I'm gonna show up. I'm not gonna be scared. 
I'm not gonna be intimidated. I'm gonna go out there and have some 
fun and do the best I can. If your mind-set, if you're up 3-0 and 
you say, "well, I got some breathing room," that's right when you're 
gonna get your butt blown off, you know?
