Saudi authorities cut off an Egyptian man's right hand by sword Sunday 
for stealing at Islam's holiest site in Mecca, the official Saudi 
Press Agency reported. Saeed Abdul-Razaq Madkour was convicted of 
numerous counts of theft and pickpocketing in the Kaaba mosque, the 
focal point for prayers by Muslims around the world. Madkour's hand 
was amputated in the holy city of Mecca in western Saudi Arabia, the 
agency said. Last month, an Afghan man had his right hand cut off 
for pickpocketing in the Kaaba mosque. A strict interpretation of 
Islamic law stipulates the cutting off of a thief's right hand. Amputations 
are carried out in a public square on the rare occasions they are 
implemented in Saudi Arabia. This was the third time this year an 
amputation has been carried out.
