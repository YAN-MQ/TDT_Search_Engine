The unflinching Omar Vizquel used every inch of his talent _ including 
his bare hands _ to stop the Yankees from barging into town and swiping 
the feel-good atmosphere that was swirling around the Indians' clubhouse 
as the weekend began. But the same locker room that on Thursday was 
alive with salsa music in the background and filled with playful jabs 
after Game 3 on Friday, was eerily quiet Sunday night long after the 
Yankees took Game 5, 5-3. And suddenly an Indians team with a 2-1 
edge is faced with going back to Yankee Stadium down, 3-2, in this 
four-of-seven-game American League Championship Series. ``It's not 
going to be easy, but this team has come from behind before,'' Vizquel 
said. ``We can't hang our heads. The series has changed a little, 
but we still have a chance. It's just going to take everyone giving 
110 percent.'' That might have been an invitation to David Justice. 
There were some within the Indians' clubhouse who wondered if Justice, 
who took a pitch off his right elbow in Game 4, could have been in 
the lineup for Game 5. But Justice took himself out before the game, 
perhaps feeling less than comfortable facing David Wells. Justice, 
who is a career .125 hitter against Wells, caused the Indians to reshuffle 
their lineup. ``I felt in talking to him that he could have played,'' 
said Manger Mike Hargrove, who used Justice as a pinch-hitter against 
Mariano Rivera in the ninth. ``I chose to go with a right-hander in 
the lineup. Based on the fact that David had been hit in the forearm 
the night before and wasn't feeling really comfortable with the left-handed 
pitching right now, that's the reason we changed.'' While Justice 
didn't feel comfortable, Vizquel was absorbing a punishing day for 
his team. After he had done everything humanly and superhumanly possible 
defensively _ which included a spectacular barehanded play on a hard 
bouncer by Chili Davis in the second inning to turn a double play 
_ he also absorbed the sting at the plate. Vizquel took an inside 
pitch from Wells off his left hand in the fifth inning, part of a 
day in which he was 2 for 3 with a run scored. This kind of effort 
came on the heels of Game 4, when he went 3 for 4. He has been one 
of the few consistencies at the plate for the Indians. ``I'm in a 
groove right now,'' Vizquel said. ``I'm really seeing the ball well. 
I hope some of the other hitters get in a groove soon. We have to 
have the little guys and the big guys getting it together at the same 
time.'' Justice is one of those big guys. But he has been ineffective 
in this ALCS, and Jim Thome has had to pick up the power in his absence. 
Thome hit his third home run of this series Sunday. ``We've got a 
tough road ahead of us,'' Thome said. ``We have to stay positive, 
though.'' It's hard when so much is against them. Also hurting the 
Indians is the injured Sandy Alomar, whose back stiffened up in Game 
4. No one was doubting Alomar's pain. ``I know he really wants to 
play,'' Vizquel said. ``I hope he can take some drugs and play.'' 
Vizquel broke open in a laugh, and he was about the only one in the 
Indians' clubhouse who could force a smile. Others looked snake-bitten, 
including starter Chad Ogea. He was one ground ball from ending the 
first inning on a double play and avoiding three first-inning runs. 
Instead of letting the grounder get to Vizquel, Ogea reached for it 
and deflected it so that everyone was safe. Ogea lasted just one and 
one-third innings. And in a role reversal, Jaret Wright, the same 
struggling pitcher Ogea had relieved in Game 1, came on to do the 
same for him. In Game 1, it was the young Wright who was beaten up 
by the Yankees for five runs in the first inning. A calm Ogea trotted 
in from the bullpen to pitch five and two-thirds innings, and gave 
up just two runs. This time it was Wright's turn to pick up the pieces 
left by Ogea. In his first relief appearance in his career, Wright 
went six innings and gave up two hits and one earned run. ``I felt 
good,'' Wright said. ``The difference between today and the last time 
was that I had the placement on my fastball. But I wouldn't second-guess 
anyone's decision to start Chad.'' Ogea's misfortune in the first 
was typical of the way things have been going for the Indians. Cleveland 
has been outscored, 10-2, in the first inning by the Yankees. ``When 
we've done well, we've had the pitching with us,'' Vizquel said. ``When 
we do the little things, we win. We have been in situations where 
we've been down before and come back. We have to believe that this 
time, too.''
