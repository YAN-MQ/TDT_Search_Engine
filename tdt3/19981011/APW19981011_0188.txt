BELGRADE, Yugoslavia (AP) _ U.S. envoy Richard Holbrooke insists ``nothing 
has changed'' in efforts to convince Yugoslavia to accept international 
demands for peace in Kosovo, despite the government's insistence it 
has met the demands of the international community. Holbrooke met 
again Sunday with President Slobodan Milosevic, whose crackdown on 
ethnic Albanian separatists in Kosovo seven months ago has brought 
NATO to the brink of airstrikes. Following a late night session which 
ended after midnight Sunday, the government's Tanjug news agency issued 
a statement from Milosevic saying all conditions necessary for a political 
settlement had been met and all U.N. demands fulfilled.
