Iran denied Sunday that an appeals court upheld a death sentence a 
day earlier for a German businessman convicted of having sex with 
a Muslim woman. No new ruling has been issued for the 56-year-old 
Helmut Hofer, Foreign Ministry spokesman Mahmoud Mohammadi was quoted 
as saying by the official Islamic Republic News Agency. Hofer's lawyer 
and several newspapers reported Saturday that the death sentence against 
Hofer was upheld by the appeals court. The lawyer showed a copy of 
the verdict to The Associated Press. Hofer was sentenced to death 
in January soon after his arrest for having sex with 26-year-old Vahideh 
Qassemi, a medical student. Iranian law punishes sex between unmarried 
Muslims with flogging. If the man is a non-Muslim, he faces the death 
penalty. The denial Sunday seems to be an attempt by the Iranian government 
to mollify Germany, which reacted angrily to news of the verdict. 
It could reflect, too, infighting within the fractured Iranian government, 
where hard-line factions and moderates centered around President Mohammad 
Khatami are vying for influence. Hard-liners control the powerful 
judiciary. The Iranian ambassador in Bonn was summoned to the Foreign 
Ministry to hear a protest over the verdict. German Foreign Minister 
Klaus Kinkel said the court ruling ``inevitably throws a new shadow 
on both sides' wish to improve relations.'' On Sunday, Iran criticized 
Germany for turning Hofer's case into a political issue that could 
threaten relations. ``As far as Iran is concerned, Hofer's case is 
trivial and is a judicial issue where political considerations do 
not play a role,'' a commentary on state-run Tehran radio said Sunday. 
There were conflicting accounts of the appeal Sunday. Mohammadi said 
that Hofer's case has already been presented to the supreme court. 
Another court routinely examined the case for possible errors before 
forwarding it, he said. But the head of the court where the trial 
took place said that the death sentence had been upheld. The death 
sentence verdict ``has not been changed,'' Nasser Seraj was quoted 
as saying by the Jomhuri Eslami newspaper. Hofer's lawyer, Malekhoushang 
Qahhari, was out of town Sunday and not available for comment. But 
on Saturday, he said that he had expected his client to be released. 
``I'm surprised. I expected that today's verdict would clear Hofer 
of all charges,'' Qahhari said. The appeals court had earlier assured 
German officials that Hofer would be freed because the court was satisfied 
that he was a Muslim and would marry the Iranian woman. Iran has been 
keen to improve its relations with the European Union, especially 
its top Western trade partner, Germany. Bonn had warned Tehran that 
if Hofer were executed, relations would sour. Ties between the two 
had only recently started to recover from strains caused by a German 
court's ruling last year implicating senior Iranian officials in the 
1992 assassination of Iranian-Kurdish dissidents at Berlin's Mykonos 
restaurant.
