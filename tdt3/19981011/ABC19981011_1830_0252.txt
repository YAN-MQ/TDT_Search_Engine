Responding to the Wyoming attack President Clinton has called for 
tougher hate crime laws. Civil rights groups say these days, gays 
need that protection more than any other group. Here's ABC's Mark 
Mullen. San Francisco long has been a refuge from the intolerance 
of more conservative communities. At a coming-out-day event, there 
was outrage and sadness over the beating in Wyoming. I'm shocked and 
overwhelmed. I was very sad that this happened. California is one 
of 21 states along with the district of Columbia which have hate crime 
laws that include sexual orientation. But 18 states have hate crime 
laws which exclude sexual orientation. Eight states have no hate crime 
laws for anyone, including Wyoming, where the beating happened. Human 
rights groups are concerned. We're seeing an increase in the hate 
crimes directed at the gay and lesbian community. And, in fact, not 
just an increase in the sheer numbers, but the intensity of the violence. 
This weekend, the president condemned the attack and called on lawmakers 
to pass a Bill now in Congress that would make it easier to prosecute 
anti-gay crimes. The Bill is vigorously opposed by some of the religious 
right. One of the things which studies have found is that individuals 
who commit hate crimes against gay people think that what they are 
doing is accepted by society. Critics say that the absence of broader 
anti-hate laws, helped create a dangerous climate. It all adds up 
that we're Lesser than. That we're not as good as other Americans, 
that we don't deserve to be treated fairly, and that we don't deserve 
protection. Human rights groups hope that the attention from this 
case will help get tougher laws passed. Though it took this horrific 
incident to get the nation's attention. Mark Mullen, ABC News, New 
York.
