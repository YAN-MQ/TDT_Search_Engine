The last of the protesting miners who camped out for more than four 
months at Russia's main government building have left the site, and 
some claim they were forced out by police, strikers said Sunday. The 
miners had been demanding overdue wages and President Boris Yeltsin's 
resignation. The twenty protesters who stayed at the makeshift tent 
village after many of their fellow strikers left last week were pushed 
out by police Saturday night, and weren't given time to pack up their 
belongings, said Konstantin Pimenov, deputy chairman of the committee 
that organized the protest. Pimenov said the miners were taken to 
a police station and 11 of them were put on a train leaving Moscow 
later Saturday night. ``More than 200 policemen, showing violence, 
simply deported them,'' he said. Six of the miners managed to get 
off the train at Vladimir, about 160 kilometers (100 miles) east of 
Moscow, and returned to the capital, Pimenov said. They are now in 
hiding, and will probably return to the government building, he said. 
A police spokesman denied Pimenov's claims, saying the miners had 
not been dispersed by anyone. The miners' banners and tents were also 
removed Sunday. About half of the 50 miners at the site left last 
week, claiming they had reached an agreement with the government over 
their wages. At times there had been as many as 200 after the protest 
started June 11, but the miners' numbers dwindled as the protest dragged 
on the weather turned colder.
