The house Judiciary committee is scheduled to meet tomorrow to discuss 
the next steps in its impeachment inquiry against President Clinton. 
Lawyers on both sides are also expected to continue considering which 
witnesses to subpoena and decide which facts are in dispute. Meanwhile, 
lawmakers in both parties are stressing the importance of their task. 
Right now I think anybody who looks at it objectively says there isn't 
one democrat who isn't going to vote for impeachment in the Senate 
at this point. But this evolves, and as the facts and the evidence 
come out, it seems to me that that may change. So we have to take 
our duties very seriously, and I believe that democrats and republicans 
will take those duties very seriously as we get going here. It is 
improbable, at best, that the united Senate would ever move to convict 
Bill Clinton based on impeachment charges. There simply is not the 
kind of bipartisan support, and there are too many misgivings about 
the Starr investigation and the components of the charges. This should 
lead to a coalescing of democrats and republicans to begin considering 
a censure resolution.
