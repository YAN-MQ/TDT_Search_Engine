Twenty Russian soldiers who had access to nuclear weapons were dismissed 
during the last two years because they were deemed mentally unfit 
for service, a news agency said Sunday. The men were in Russia's strategic 
missile force, the Interfax news agency said, citing a report by the 
Russian Military Prosecutor's Office. The report gave no further details. 
More than 650 armed forces personnel and 480 Interior Ministry troops 
were also dismissed for similar reasons in the same period, the Prosecutor's 
Office report said. The men were allowed to join Russia's military 
because of the country's determination to fulfill draft quotas. Many 
conscripts flee rather than report for duty in the military, where 
harsh conditions and hazing are prevalent. More than 4,000 recruits 
drafted in the spring of 1998 are in need of medical treatment, and 
over 8,700 needed a ``thorough medical check,'' the report said.
