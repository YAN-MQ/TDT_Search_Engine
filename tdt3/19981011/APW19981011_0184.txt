Toshimitsu Izawa finally proved that his victory in the 1995 Japan 
Open wasn't a fluke. Izawa shot a 4-under-par 68 Sunday for a three-stroke 
victory with an 11-under 277 total in the 110 million yen (dlrs 894,000) 
Tokai Classic. The Japan Open championship was the 30-year-old Izawa's 
only previous triumph in a nine-year career. Izawa, teeing off one 
stroke off the pace, sank six birdies against two bogeys over the 
par-72 Miyoshi Country Club course. Izawa surged ahead, improving 
his score by two strokes before the turn, as overnight leader Yasuharu 
Imano shot a 3-over 39 on the front nine and fell out of contention 
with a final round of 76. On the back side, Izawa improved his score 
by two more shots and held off a late charge by Nobumitsu Yuhara, 
who also carded a 68 to place second at 8-over 280. ``Yes, it took 
three long years,'' a jubilant Izawa said. ``But I wasn't thinking 
about victory, yet. Because of injuries last year, I've been aiming, 
so far this season, to win an exempt status for next year.'' The top 
50 finishers on the money list at the end of the season will qualify 
for the 1999 Japan PGA Tour. ``I hope this win will help me speed 
up momentum and confidence.'' Izawa collected the top prize of 19.8 
million yen (dlrs 161,000). Mark Calcavecchia of the United States 
turned in a 73 and shared third place at 283 with Kaname Yokoo, Toshiaki 
Odate and Mamoru Osanai.
