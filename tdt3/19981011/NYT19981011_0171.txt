The black robes and black toque cap unmistakably signify that the 
Rev. Sava Janjic is a monk of the ancient Serbian Orthodox Church. 
But his language and his study in southern Kosovo, with three computers, 
a scanner and the latest Internet connection, are unquestionably of 
the modern world. ``This is a war between extremists,'' he said, speaking 
in fluent English of the conflict in Serbia's province as he sat on 
a wide veranda overlooking a 14th-century frescoed church kept in 
pristine condition. ``On one side is a totalitarian regime, and on 
the other, secessionists.'' Father Sava, as he is known, is a rare 
voice of public opposition to hard-line Serbian positions, a thorn 
of conscience amid the hate-filled speeches in the Serbian Parliament 
and the unrelenting repression by the Yugoslav president, Slobodan 
Milosevic, against Kosovo's majority ethnic Albanians. In voicing 
his opposition to Milosevic in Washington, where he visited officials 
in September, and in the rustic quiet of his monastery, Janjic, 33, 
has no compunction in using tough language. ``If Mladic and Karadzic 
were in The Hague court that would only be a start,'' he said, referring 
to Ratko Mladic and Radovan Karadzic, respectively the military and 
civilian leaders of the Bosnian Serbs during the 1992-95 Bosnian war. 
``The main bosses remain free.'' ``When I see Tudjman and Milosevic 
in The Hague, I'll be happy,'' he said, referring to the president 
of Croatia, Franjo Tudjman, and the Yugoslav leader. Such radical 
talk is startling from a man of religion, but Janjic says he sees 
himself and his monastery as a bridge: between the extremist Serbs 
and extremist Albanians, between ordinary Serbs and the outside world. 
And for that, his expertise in computers, acquired step by step over 
the last several years, is a perfect tool. ``I think this is a wonderful 
media,'' he said, patting his new Compaq laptop, a gift from the Convention 
of Serbian Unity Congress in Washington. ``It gives us the opportunity 
to spread the ideas of the opposition in Kosovo and to get information 
out about the church. It is all very well to wish well. We want to 
do something.'' Every night, he sends e-mails around the world, many 
of them Western newspaper reports about the war in Kosovo, some of 
them statements from Bishop Artimije of Kosovo, some of them accounts 
of how the Milosevic government is harassing the independent media 
in Yugoslavia. In the last few days, he has sent a blizzard of e-mails 
on what he sees as the folly of NATO bombing against Serbia. ``Military 
intervention will only homogenize people around the hardline Serbian 
policies and destroy the prospects for democracy,'' he said. ``The 
psychology of the Serbs is such that if they are attacked, they become 
very resentful to the attackers and foreign countries. The regime 
can use this.'' That was an allusion to Milosevic's control of powerful 
media like state television that give most of the overwhelmingly rural 
people of Serbia their news. The Decani monastery, one of the most 
fabled of the beautiful Orthodox monasteries that tell Kosovo's history 
as the heartland of the Serbs' medieval empire, opposed Milosevic's 
wars in Croatia and Bosnia, arguing that Yugoslavia should stay intact 
and orient itself toward the West. Since the conflict in Kosovo started 
in March, the bishop has called for a cease-fire and the start of 
talks. For this stance, Artimije, unlike other senior bishops in Serbia, 
has never been invited to meet the Yugoslav leader. ``Doors are open 
to him in Washington, London, Paris and Moscow, but not in Belgrade,'' 
Janjic said. The bishop took over the Kosovo diocese in 1991, and 
attracted a new generation of monks to the monastery, whose church 
was built between 1327 and 1335 by Prince Stephan Dusan, who became 
King of Serbia. Janjic, who was born in Dubrovnik, Croatia, and is 
a graduate of the University of Belgrade, is one of the 21 monks who 
spend up to six hours in prayer every day. The order of service on 
the pulpit is about the only contemporary object in the church: a 
printout from Janjic's computer done in a 19th-century style type 
font. Because he is so media-savvy, Janjic understands how the manipulation 
of state-run television and newspapers by Milosevic's governing Socialist 
Party affects the mind-set of ordinary Serbs. ``There are people in 
Serbia who want to make democratic change in Serbia,'' he said. ``Some 
of us met with Robert Gelbhard, the American diplomat, in June. But 
how is it possible to work for change when there is no free media?'' 
The lack of a free press in Yugoslavia worries him for another reason. 
When there are reports in the Serbian press of atrocities committed 
against Serbian civilians in Kosovo by ethnic Albanian guerrillas, 
the West discredits the accounts, he said. In the summer, when the 
separatist Kosovo Liberation Army was at the peak of its strength, 
the sound of fighting between the guerrillas and Serbian forces resounded 
in the hills above the monastery. ``We were here, shut inside the 
monastery with shooting all around,'' he said. ``But there were no 
attempts to attack the monastery and no damage to Serb Orthodox churches 
in this area.'' What would he do if the guerrillas came to the monastery 
_ as the Serbian police often do? (The police are required to leave 
their weapons under the fir tree in the garden.) ``We'd open the door 
and ask them to have a cup of coffee,'' the priest replied. ``If they 
want to kill us, we have to be ready as Christians and monks. But 
I don't think that will happen.'' And which side does God take in 
this conflict? ``God is on the side of the suffering people, the people 
who were killed in Gornje Obrinje and in Glodjane,'' he said, referring 
to a site where Albanians were massacred by Serbs and a site where 
34 Serbs were massacred by Albanians. ``And that's my side too.''
