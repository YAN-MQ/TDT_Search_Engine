Sudan declared Sunday it wanted a full cease-fire with southern rebels, 
but stopped short of agreeing to adhere to the partial truce that 
rebels declared last week. The Sudan People's Liberation Army said 
Thursday that it would extend by another three months a cease-fire 
set to end Wednesday in southern Bahr el-Ghazal province. The truce 
was designed to allow relief food to reach civilians stricken by famine. 
The government has not officially responded. But a statement issued 
by the office of state minister for foreign affairs, Bishop Gabriel 
Roreg, said the government hoped to ``realize peace in the homeland 
in a comprehensive cease-fire.'' The statement called ``on those working 
with humanitarian groups to exercise pressure on the rebels ... to 
halt the shedding of blood and end the suffering of civilians in the 
south.'' Sudan's army warned that rebels might use the truce to rearm. 
``We in the armed forces believe the cease-fire will benefit the rebel 
movement'' because the rebels will use the time to prepare for future 
fighting, Sudan's army spokesman. Lt. Gen. Abdul-Rahman Sirul-Khatim, 
said Saturday. Sudan has been embroiled in a civil war for 15 years, 
pitting Christian and animist rebels fighting for more autonomy against 
the government in the Muslim, Arab north. About 1 1/2 million people 
have died in the war and famines caused by the fighting.
