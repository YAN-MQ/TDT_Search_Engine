The University of Virginia is setting up a committee to review the 
school's medical center. Uva has been embarrassed by three mistakes 
made public in recent months, including mixing up two newborns in 
1995, switching the bodies of dead babies, and giving a mother only 
the placenta of her baby to bury after it died. Virginia governor 
Jim Gilmore also has sent the state medical examiner to investigate 
procedures at the center's morgue.
