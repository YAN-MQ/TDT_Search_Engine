Russell Biven, "Headline Sports." The American league championship 
series is all tied at two. Last night, Orlando Hernandez pitched seven 
shutout innings as New York blanked the Indians 4-0. Both teams got 
just four hits apiece, but the Yankees made them count. He pitched 
well against everyone. I don't really think he changed his philosophy. 
He's going to make you hit his pitch. You know, he threw a 3-2 changeup 
to thome. I mean, that's a tough pitch. You know, worked ahead the 
whole night. Game five is later this afternoon at jacobs field. New 
York sends David Wells to the hill, while Cleveland counters with 
Chad ogea.
