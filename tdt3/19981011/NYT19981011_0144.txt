You can call it espionage, or you can call it surveillance. But in 
pro football, a spy by any other name would smell as sour. As the 
Giants confronted the Atlanta Falcons Sunday night, part of the story 
line was the Giants' suspicion during the week that Dan Reeves, the 
former Giants coach who now tutors the Falcons, had a spy peering 
at the Giants' outdoor practice field from high in the nearby Sheraton 
Meadowlands Hotel. According to a Giants official, a Falcon assistant 
coach who had been on Reeves' Giants staff, Joe DeCamillis, was suspected 
of being involved in the plot. DeCamillis, who is also Reeves' son-in-law, 
denied any involvement, saying: ``I ain't doing anything like that. 
Coach Reeves would be angry if he knew someone did that.'' But as 
the Giants' coach for four seasons, Reeves realized the Sheraton and 
an adjacent high-rise office building afforded a clear view of practice. 
``Dan wanted to put up a wall to block that view of the practice field,'' 
a former Giants official recalled. Whatever Reeves did or didn't do 
last week, the Giants had a security official with high-powered binoculars 
surveying the windows of the hotel and the office building during 
practice. Coach Jim Fassel also took the team inside the team's practice 
bubble to go through the new plays designed for the Falcon game. Such 
paranoia by Giant coaches isn't new. The week before a 1991 game with 
the Washington Redskins, Coach Ray Handley had similar fears. ``There 
have been times,'' Handley said then, ``when teams were very well 
advised of things that we were doing in games that we thought were 
new and would surprise them, but it did not surprise them.'' Whatever 
did or did not occur during practice that week, the Giants lost that 
game, 17-13, in what was an 8-8 season. Spying, or the suspicion of 
spying, is not new among National Football League coaches. Whenever 
a helicopter flew anywhere near the Jets' practice in the week before 
a game with the Oakland Raiders three decades ago, Coach Weeb Ewbank 
glared at it. ``Al Davis has somebody up there watching us,'' Ewbank 
growled, referring to the Raiders' managing general genius. ``Don't 
do anything until that copter leaves.'' Then and now, Davis enjoyed 
a sinister reputation. Harland Svare, the San Diego Chargers' coach 
who had been a Giants linebacker, once sat in the visiting locker 
room at the Oakland Coliseum and shouted at a light fixture. ``I know 
you're up there, Al Davis,'' Svare said. ``I know you're up there.'' 
Told later of Svare's accusation, Davis didn't hesitate to perpetuate 
his sinister reputation. ``The thing wasn't in the light fixture,'' 
Davis said. ``I'll tell you that much.'' To thwart the possibility 
of spying, each NFL team now has a security guard, if not several 
guards, at its practice complex. As the Los Angeles Rams' coach three 
decades ago, George Allen was the first coach to take that precaution, 
hiring Ed Boynton, a retired Long Beach, Calif., policeman. Known 
as ``Double O,'' Boynton accompanied Allen to the Redskins. He once 
chased a suspect from the chemical lab of the high school near the 
Redskin training camp in Carlisle, Pa. At least a decade before Double 
O arrived, Paul Brown, the Hall of Fame coach of the Cleveland Browns, 
was his own security officer. Whenever the Browns practiced in cavernous 
Cleveland Stadium, if a stranger suddenly appeared, Brown would stop 
practice and have the stranger ushered out. Ewbank, a Browns' assistant 
under Brown, took that distrust to Baltimore as the Colts' coach _ 
even a distrust of Brown himself. In 1959, when the defending champion 
Colts were about to play the Browns, Ewbank sent the equipment manager, 
Fred Schubach, across the street from the open end of Baltimore's 
old Memorial Stadium to check for suspicious strangers in the Ednor 
Garden houses. ``We're all Colt fans here,'' one resident told Schubach, 
``but if Coach Ewbank feels that strongly about it, come in and look 
around.'' No suspicious strangers were found, but the Colts lost, 
38-31, one of their three defeats that season in repeating as NFL 
champions. Most coaches, not only Jim Fassel, still think a suspicious 
stranger might be out there somewhere watching practice. And it's 
easier for a spy now. For years, some NFL teams didn't wear numbers 
on their practice jerseys to thwart the possibility of spies. But 
when each team began filming practices, numbers were necessary. Spies 
or no spies.
