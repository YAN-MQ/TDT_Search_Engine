It may be the last chance to avert a military strike in the Balkans. 
U.S. envoy Richard Holbrooke is meeting again today with Yugoslav 
President Slobodan Milosevic to try and come up with a diplomatic 
solution to the crisis in Kosovo. The U.N. wants Milosevic to stop 
harassing ethnic Albanians in the province, and to discuss their eventual 
autonomy. If he refuses, NATO could authorize military strikes when 
it meets tomorrow. Mike Hanna has more. a change of command ceremony 
at the headquarters of the allied forces in southern Europe. It's 
here in Naples that any strike against President Milosevic's Serb 
regime will be coordinated. And words of warning from NATO's supreme 
commander. President Milosevic is going to have to calculate very 
carefully what the risks will be as he moves ahead. That's the message 
that I would give as a military leader who's very well familiar with 
what the consequences of military action can be. But military action 
originating in Italy first needs the go ahead of a government which 
in recent days has been dealing with a domestic political crisis, 
resulting in a vote of no confidence in prime minister Romano Prodi. 
He's now heading a caretaker government that in the next 48 hours 
is expected to call a vote on whether to back military action in Yugoslavia. 
Until a positive vote is registered, strike aircraft at Italian bases 
like Aviano will not be used in a strike. But NAto sources say this 
would only be a hindrance if the punitive operation was to become 
an extended one. The strike is expected to come from missile cruisers 
at present exercising in international waters or from long-range bombers 
deployed out of bases in Britain. Air support and second-wave strikes 
would originate from carriers like the "USS Eisenhower," part of a 
massive NatO naval force now at full operational readiness, taking 
part in an exercise called "operation dynamic mix" that was organized 
before the Kosovo crisis. The forces needed for an initial strike 
are in place. Plans to deal with virtually any military contingency 
have been drawn up at these headquarters. But now the force commanders 
can only wait on a political decision that must be taken by all 16 
members of NATO. Mike Hanna, CNN, Naples.
