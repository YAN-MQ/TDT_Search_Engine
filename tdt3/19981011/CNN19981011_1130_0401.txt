Sinn Fein leader Gerry Adams says northern Ireland needs U.S. support 
to achieve peace. The leader of the political wing of the Irish republican 
army is on an eight-day U.S. fundraising tour. A northern Ireland 
peace treaty was signed in April. But the formation of a multiparty 
administration in the province is in jeopardy. Adams and Ulster unionist 
leader David trimble can't agree on whether the IRA should begin disarming 
before Sinn Fein can join the administration.
