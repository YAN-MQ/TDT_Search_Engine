This is "Headline News," I'm Sachi Koto. Democrats are plotting strategy 
for the end game of congressional budget talks. Mr. Clinton is meeting 
with democratic leaders of the house and Senate at this hour at the 
White House. Funding for Mr. Clinton's education agenda is reported 
to be a sticking point in the negotiations with republicans. Mr. Clinton's 
proposal calls for $1.2 billion to hire 100,000 new teachers. In addition, 
he wants $5 billion allocated for school construction. Republicans 
say they want more money for education too, but not the way Mr. Clinton 
has structured the programs. There are areas where we can, I think 
can reach agreement with regard to how to handle the census, possibly 
with the international monetary fund. Once again, we have a responsibility 
to try to protect the American people's money and I don't think we 
ought to just turn billions of dollars over to IMF without some conditions 
as to how that money is going to be used. On education, we want more 
money for education, it's important in America, but there's a fundamental 
difference there. We don't want 20% of the money to be eaten up coming 
from the local level to Washington, back through the district regional 
offices and then eventually to the people. We would like more of the 
decisions to be made by the families and the local school officials. 
They want it controlled from Washington. But in the end, I think we'll 
reach agreement on that also. President Clinton spoke on the issue 
just moments ago. Tomorrow night the funding to keep the government 
open expires again. Senator Daschle, congressman Gephardt will work 
with the republican majority to do the right thing for our country. 
We must pass a budget that is physically responsible, that honors 
our values, that invests in the education of our children. That is 
the most important thing we can do, and, in this loan running Congress.
