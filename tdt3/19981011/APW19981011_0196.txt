The chief U.N. weapons inspector has apologized for accusing a former 
inspector of breaking the law by speaking out about Iraq's weapons 
capabilities, according to an Arabic newspaper. Richard Butler had 
accused the former inspector, Scott Ritter, of breaking the law by 
releasing details of information he collected while on official duty. 
In an interview earlier this month, Butler asked Ritter to ``desist 
from doing that.'' In a letter Wednesday, Ritter's lawyer, Matthew 
L. Lifflander, asked Butler to retract the accusation. In an interview 
published Sunday in the daily Al-Hayat, which is published in London, 
Butler did just that. ``I apologize to Scott Ritter if he understood 
that I meant he broke the American law,'' the paper quoted Butler 
as saying. ``All that I meant was that he violated his commitments 
to the United Nations.'' Since he resigned Aug. 26, Ritter has spoken 
out several times on Iraq's weapons programs, accusing the United 
States and Britain of failing to stand behind inspectors. He also 
accused Butler of bowing to U.S. pressure by halting surprise inspections 
of sites. Ritter has been quoted by U.S. and Israeli newspapers as 
saying he dealt with Israeli intelligence and the CIA in seeking information 
on Iraq's weapons program. Iraq has long maintained that the U.N. 
Special Commission was not a neutral agency but worked under the United 
States and that some of the arms inspectors _Ritter in particular 
_ were spies. U.N. sanctions imposed on Iraq for its invasion of Kuwait 
in 1990, which led to the Gulf War, will not be lifted until U.N. 
arms monitors certify Baghdad has eliminated all its banned weapons.
