At least 11 people were killed in fighting between government troops 
and Tamil Tiger guerrillas in northeastern Sri Lanka, the military 
said Sunday. Four civilians were killed when their van exploded as 
it passed over a rebel land mine in the eastern Batticaloa district 
on Sunday, said military officials who asked not to be named. Four 
guerrillas were killed by government troops Saturday near the northern 
town of Mankulam, the military said in a statement. Three more rebels 
were killed at the nearby towns of Kilinochchi and Paranthan, also 
on Saturday, the statement said. There were no casualties on the government 
side, the military said. Fighting has decreased this month after major 
battles in Kilinochchi, Mankulam and Paranthan. Those battles last 
month left at least 1,800 dead or missing on both sides, according 
to the military. The rebels are fighting for a separate homeland for 
minority Tamils in the country's north and east, claiming that they 
are discriminated against by the majority Sinhalese who control the 
government and the military. More than 55,000 people have died in 
15 years of fighting.
