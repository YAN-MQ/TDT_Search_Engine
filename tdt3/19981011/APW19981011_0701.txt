Goals by Irina Grigoryeva and Tatyana Yegorova rallied Russia to a 
2-1 victory over Finland Sunday, sending it to its first Women's World 
Cup. Russia's victory gave it a 4-2 aggregate for the two legs and 
made it the sixth and final European team to qualify, the 12th overall 
for the 16-team field. Finland, trying to overcome a 2-1 loss in the 
first leg, took the early lead in the 25th minute when Terhi Uusi-Luomalahti 
converted a penalty. A 1-0 victory would have sent Finland to the 
United States, but Grigoryeva tied it six minutes later on a deflected 
shot and Yegorova notched the winner in the 79th after a corner. Russia 
was the better side, with a coherent team play and safer passing, 
and the players also showed better individual skills. Marina Burakova 
marshalled the defense, and was the best on the team, along with the 
two goalscorers.
