The University of Wyoming marked its homecoming yesterday, and fellow 
students carried banners for Matthew shepard. The 21-year-old lies 
in critical condition in a Colorado hospital after he was robbed, 
beaten and left for dead last week, apparently because he is gay. 
Hospital officials say his condition has worsened slightly. Two men 
and a woman have been arrested and charged. A second woman may also 
face charges.
