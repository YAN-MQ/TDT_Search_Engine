Singer Garth Brooks surprised a Minnesota family with some special 
gifts last week after they bought the five millionth ticket on his 
current tour. He presented them with three new vehicles, a five-day 
trip to cancun, Mexico, and $5,000 spending money. They also got a 
video camera and ten dozen red Roses. Brooks says the gifts are a 
way to thank his fans for giving him and his family the life they 
live.
