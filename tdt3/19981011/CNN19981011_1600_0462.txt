If you hate pumping gas, maybe your next car should be a Chevrolet 
metro. Two models of the 1999 metro top the EPA's list of the most 
fuel-efficient gasoline vehicles. The Suzuki swift and a pair of Honda 
civics round out the top five. On the other side of the gas gauge 
are three ferraris, a Lamborghini and a rolls Royce. Ironically, good 
gas mileage doesn't always translate into good sales. With gas prices 
so low, auto dealers say sales of fuel-efficient cars have lagged 
behind gas guzzling sport utility vehicles.
