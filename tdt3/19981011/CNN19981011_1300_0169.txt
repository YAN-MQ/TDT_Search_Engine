High-tech companies in the U.S. apparently won't be adding larger 
numbers of skilled immigrants to their payrolls this year because 
of the efforts of senator Tom Harkin of Iowa. He's blocking action 
on a Bill to raise the number of so-called "skilled worker" visas 
from 65,000 a year to more than 115,000 for the next two years. Harkin 
and other opponents claim high-tech companies have an ulterior motive 
for wanting the Bill -- to replace U.S. workers with lower-wage immigrants.
