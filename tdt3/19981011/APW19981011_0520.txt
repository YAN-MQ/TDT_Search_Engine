Britain's number one Tim Henman produced some of the best tennis of 
his career Sunday to oust fourth-seed Andre Agassi in the final of 
the Swiss Indoors and collect his second title of the season. After 
successfully defending his Tashkent title last week, Henman went on 
to defeat the American veteran 6-4, 6-3, 3-6, 6-4 in two hours, 16 
minutes to earn his first career back-to-back titles and extend his 
winning streak to 12 victories. ``I played some of the best tennis 
of my career, the kind I only dreamed about,'' said Henman, seeded 
sixth. ``The level was just so high and I was very consistent. ``And 
to win in a final with a player of the highest pedigree like Agassi 
you have to put out some great tennis to win.'' The victory avenged 
his loss to Agassi 10 weeks ago, when the American beat out Henman 
for the title in Los Angeles in the pair's only other head-to-head. 
``He just rose above today and played deserving of the victory and 
I didn't,'' said Agassi, who reached the final without dropping a 
set. ``He made it happen. I was really impressed. ``Initially I wouldn't 
have categorized him with the best players in the world but today 
he showed he's perhaps one of the strongest players on this surface. 
He kicked my butt.'' Currently eighth in the ``Road to Hannover'' 
standings, the victory solidifies Henman's chances of a berth at the 
ATP Tour World Championship next month. ``I hope this was an indication 
of things to come,'' said Henman, who has four career titles. ``I 
know I can still improve and I believe I can go on to win more and 
bigger tournaments.'' With both players attacking the net and looking 
solid, it was Agassi who created the first break opportunity. But 
leading 0-30 at 3-3 on Henman's serve, Agassi blew his chance to jump 
ahead, squandering three break points, with a steely Henman scoring 
the next five. Leading 5-4, Henman broke Agassi, the American unable 
to save a second break point, with a wide shot costing him the set. 
Another wide-shot cost Agassi his opening serve in the second, giving 
Henman a 2-0 lead. But the Briton squandered his advantage on his 
next service game, double-faulting twice to put Agassi back on serve. 
But a determined Henman, refusing to let the tables turn, immediately 
broke back then held to take the set. As Henman began to struggle 
with his serve in the third set, Agassi began to get back into the 
match, breaking to go 4-2, then holding to take the set and keep his 
hopes alive. The pair traded breaks twice in the fourth set before 
the British number one took Agassi's serve at 5-4 to seal the title. 
``I was up a break in the fourth and should have been able to hang 
on and turn the match around,'' said Agassi, who has a 57-13 win-loss 
record this season. ``In hindsight I should have been pleased that 
I got back into the match. But I could have shot myself if I'd had 
a gun, I was so angry with myself.'' Agassi, who won four titles this 
season, is currently fifth in the ``Road to Hannover'' standings. 
While a victory in the final would have virtually guaranteed him a 
berth at the World Championships, reaching the final has further cemented 
his foothold in the top-eight standings. Reaching the final will also 
aid his climb back up the ATP rankings. The American, who finished 
last year 122 in the world _ his lowest ATP ranking since turning 
pro in 1985 _ is currently eighth in the standings. Going from No. 
141 in November 1997, to his current ranking of No. 8, the 28-year-old 
American still has a chance to leapfrog compatriot Pete Sampras to 
to finish the year as No. 1. ``It's possible,'' admitted Agassi. ``But 
first I need to be able to win.''
