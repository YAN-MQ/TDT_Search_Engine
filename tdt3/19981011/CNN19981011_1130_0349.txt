U.S. B-52 bombers are arriving in England today in anticipation of 
possible NATO air strikes on Yugoslavia. They're among 260 U.S. strike 
aircraft NAto could authorize to attack as early as tomorrow. U.S. 
aircraft based in Italy may not be available for use. The Italian 
government has not yet agreed to allow air strikes to be launched 
from Italian territory. NATO planners say that doesn't pose a problem 
unless military action becomes prolonged.
