Joseph Sandler, a distinguished psychoanalyst who worked in Britain, 
The Netherlands and Israel, has died. He was 71. London's Guardian 
newspaper said Sandler, who died Oct. 6, had cancer. Born in South 
Africa, Sandler received his initial degrees from the University of 
Cape Town, and his doctorate from London University when he was 23. 
Under Anna Freud at the Hampstead Clinic, now the Anna Freud Clinic, 
in London, Sandler made a major contribution to clarifying psychoanalytic 
idea in the language of human relationships. He wrote more than 200 
papers and co-authored and edited 44 books. Sandler's teaching career 
began at London's Middlesex Hospital in 1967. After working at Leiden 
University in The Netherlands, Sandler was founder and director of 
the Sigmund Freud Center at Jerusalem's Hebrew University where he 
was the first holder, between 1979 and 1984, of the Sigmund Freud 
professorship. He returned to England to take up the Freud memorial 
chair at University College, London, where he had been emeritus professor 
since his retirement in 1992. Sandler is survived by his wife, Anne-Marie, 
also a psychoanalyst, and three children.
