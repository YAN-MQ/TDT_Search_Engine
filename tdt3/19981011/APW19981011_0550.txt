Art or fashion? Issey Miyake's exhibition opening Sunday at the Cartier 
Foundation for Modern Art was a glorious combination of both. Clothes 
shown as puppets on strings were literally jumping for joy. As an 
appropriate introduction to a mad nine days of nearly 100 international 
luxury ready-to-wear shows for summer 1999, Miyake's exhibition couldn't 
be beat for class and futuristic appeal. He steers fashion, art and 
the cyberworld into the next millennium with his latest techniques. 
In the opening room called ``Jumping,'' viewers get a great look at 
Miyake's styles of the last 10 years, as the jumping wire-puppet mobiles 
show his permanent-pleated clothes in fantastic Japanese-lantern shapes. 
Suspended from the ceiling, they unfold, then collapse and fold flat 
for practicality. This is the line called Pleats Please, made so popular 
by Miyake in the past five years, in lower prices for top fashion, 
around the dlrs 150 or a bit more per item. ``I would like to make 
the next generation move in their fashions, to make people feel free,'' 
said Miyake as he roamed around the Exhibition called ``Making Things,'' 
on until January 17. Miyake loves to collaborate with other artists, 
who use his methods and clothes for symbiotic inspiration. There's 
a squiggly dragon-shaped spot on the Cartier Fondation floor where 
last week Chinese artist Cai Guo-Qiang literally exploded and burnt 
a Miyake outfit. He then transferred the gunpowdered patterns onto 
fabric, in Pleats Please clothes, hung on the glass walls of the museum. 
Several other artists' works were on display, including a big wall 
hanging quilt made by fusing and ``blowing up'' Miyake designs as 
a three-by-eight-meter (12-by-24 foot) pneumatic work inflated by 
an air blower. ``His energy and open-mindedness to new ideas are a 
fabulous inspiration,'' said artist Tim Hawkinson, 37, of California. 
``But I hated cutting up the Pleats Please outfits.'' ``Just before'' 
is a huge roll of black material; you can see the dresses coming out 
from it. ``Shops or customers can gear their lengths, decolletes, 
and so on to each shape, cutting as you go, so to speak,'' said Jun 
Kanai, of Miyake, New York. With ``A Piece of Cloth'' dresses - whole 
wardrobes may be cut from tubes of material, which can be customized 
by stores or customers. Miyake, 60, who studied at the Chambre Syndicale 
fashion school in Paris and worked briefly at Givenchy, is very aware 
of women as wearers of clothes, however high-tech and arty his productions 
may seem. ``Yes, I'd like women of the future to participate in the 
making of their outfits,'' he said. ``There are no secrets to my methods. 
Everybody can join in. It's interactive, if you wish. But remember,'' 
he said with a wink, ``a computer gives no ideas.'' Meanwhile Jose 
Levy's show in the Louvre Carrousel area was a quiet, restful moment 
of seaside blues and grays. Levy, 35, has often showed menswear, and 
is now launching himself into light, summery clothes based on nostalgia. 
Suits in light beiges and blues, some lovely little poplin kilts and 
tri-toned knits in sea-haze pinks, grays and blues were out of an 
impressionist painting. Along with easy shorts, they could look just 
at home at seaside Deauville or Honfleur. These are girlish and mild 
clothes, nothing too long, nothing too shocking. More exciting - but 
perhaps less wearable - numbers will blast out during the week, as 
shown by the likes of Alexander McQueen at Givenchy or Jean-Paul Gaultier. 
The fashion mood is good here, whatever the downbeat worldwide stock 
markets are showing,'' said Didier Grumbach, new head of the ready-to-wear 
and couture's Chambre Syndicale.
