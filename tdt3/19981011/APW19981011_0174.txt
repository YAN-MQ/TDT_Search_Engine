Two U.S. B-52 bombers _ the first of seven due within hours _ landed 
Sunday at a British air base to prepare for possible NATO air strikes 
against in Kosovo. The bombers, accompanied by a reconnaissance aircraft 
and tanker aircraft, flew in to Fairford, a Royal Air Force base in 
Gloucestershire, 75 miles (120 kms) west of London. The B-52s, capable 
of carrying cruise missiles, are among 260 U.S. aircraft, mostly already 
in Europe, poised to take part in strikes which NATO plans to authorize 
Monday unless there is a last-minute deal with Yugoslav President 
Slobodan Milosevic over the ethnic Alabanian majority in Kosovo. ``There 
is a way out and the way out for Milosevic is to comply with the will 
of the world community, the objectives of the U.N. Security Council 
and the United Nations,'' said Defense Secretary George Robertson, 
speaking on Sky TV. ``If he does that ... then he can avoid the use 
of force, If not, he is on the very last countdown and the B-52s arrive 
today.'' Robertson added that NATO was determined to act before the 
winter because of the plight of thousands of refugees living in the 
open after being driven from their homes by Serb forces. ``They are 
in the forests of Kosovo and the tragedy will come when the winter 
comes in and they will need shelter. Then thousands of people will 
die,'' he said. Among European members of NATO, Britain has been the 
most vociferous in urging strikes against Serb forces in Kosovo. The 
B-52s arrived from Barksdale air base, Louisiana, a 4,000-mile (6,500 
km) journey. ``Our motto here is `any time, every time','' said base 
commander Lt.-Col. Sheri Andino. ``The length of time the bombers 
stay here at Fairford is a political decision, we are just ready if 
we are needed.''
