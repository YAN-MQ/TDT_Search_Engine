As U.S. bombers moved into position for possible NATO airstrikes, 
a senior U.S. envoy accelerated talks Sunday with President Slobodan 
Milosevic, after reporting ``no change'' in the Yugoslav leader's 
tough stand on Kosovo. U.S. envoy Richard Holbrooke and Milosevic 
met well into the night Sunday, signaling U.S. determination to search 
for a peaceful way out of the Kosovo deadlock. The two conferred for 
more than seven hours in the afternoon and them resumed late Sunday 
after about a 2 1/2-hour break. The major obstacle appears to be Holbrooke's 
demand that Milosevic agree to an expanded international monitoring 
mission to verify compliance with demands of the U.N. Security Council. 
Those demands include a withdrawal of special troops, an immediate 
cease-fire, allowing refugees to return home and beginning talks with 
ethnic Albanians on Kosovo's future. In Washington, President Bill 
Clinton's national security adviser told Cable News Network on Sunday 
that Milosevic ``is not in compliance as of this point.'' The adviser, 
Sandy Berger, said that if Milosevic remains defiant, NATO will act 
as early as Monday to authorize the alliance commander, Gen. Wesley 
Clark, to launch military strikes. ``The ball now is in Mr. Milosevic's 
court,'' Berger said. ``He can come into compliance or he can face 
military action by NATO'' at ``any time.'' Washington backed up those 
words with actions. Six U.S. B-52 bombers arrived Sunday in Britain 
and a contingent of A-10 anti-tank planes flew from Germany to Italy. 
In Bucharest, the Romanian government agreed to allow NATO to use 
its airspace in ``emergency and unpredictable situations'' if the 
alliance launches airstrikes against Yugoslavia. Hungarian Prime Minister 
Viktor Orban said his government was considering a similar request 
from the alliance. The positioning of more U.S. planes within range 
and getting them ready for attacks were clearly designed to convince 
Milosevic of Washington's resolve to force compliance with U.N. demands 
for an end to the Kosovo crisis. Holbrooke said NATO would meet Monday 
``to authorize action'' if his mediation effort fails. The Americans 
and Europeans are demanding that Milosevic halt the crackdown he launched 
Feb. 28 after the militant Kosovo Liberation Army stepped up attacks 
on Serb police and troops in the troubled province. Kosovo is a province 
of Serbia, the main republic of Yugoslavia. But its 2 million-strong 
population is 90 percent ethnic Albanian, and most of them want independence 
or substantial self-rule. In Kosovo, journalists heard sporadic gunfire 
Sunday and saw white and gray smoke rising from about six houses in 
the ethnic Albanian village of Makrmalj about 30 kilometers (20 miles) 
west of Pristina. Ethnic Albanian rebels claimed the activity was 
part of a Serb police operation. Police prevented the journalists 
from getting closer than about a kilometer (half mile) from the village. 
After the previous, late-night session with Milosevic, an exhausted-looking 
Holbrooke insisted ``nothing has changed'' in the Yugoslav leader's 
stand. The U.S. envoy called the situation ``very serious'' and said 
he was looking for ``peaceful, acceptable'' alternative to the use 
of force. A statement from Milosevic's office, issued after the talks 
and distributed by the government's Tanjug news agency, said all U.N. 
conditions have been met for a political settlement. But Milosevic 
seemed to be separating U.N. demands _ including a cease-fire, talks 
on Kosovo's future and allowing refugees to return home _ from the 
U.S. insistence on verification. Holbrooke told reporters early Sunday 
that his mission ``will continue an intense effort to find a peaceful, 
acceptable, fully verifiable compliance system as an alternative to 
the other choice'' _ meaning the use of force. Serb sources, speaking 
on condition of anonymity, said Milosevic has refused to budge on 
the monitoring force. Washington is pressing for such a force because 
Milosevic is known for breaking promises. A source close to Milosevic 
indicated the Yugoslav president was ready to comply with other conditions. 
On Sunday, Belgrade's newspapers ran optimistic headlines suggesting 
that tensions had eased and that an agreement may be in sight. Ekspres 
Politika headlined: ``Sobering Up,'' and Dnevni Telegraf bannered: 
`` NATO Threat Removed?'' But latest reports on military preparations 
suggested time was running out. On Sunday, six U.S. B-52 bombers, 
each capable of carrying up to 20 cruise missiles, arrived at Fairford, 
a Royal Air Force base in Gloucestershire, 75 miles (120 kms) west 
of London. ``This is a warning,'' Col. Wendell Griffin, the detachment 
commander, said. ``We are glad to be here and we are very prepared. 
But we are on standby, and we will be ready and able to fly missions 
eight or nine hours from now.'' Meanwhile, 10 A-10 attack aircraft, 
which were used successfully against Iraqi armor in the 1991 Persian 
Gulf War, arrived at the Aviano air base in northern Italy from their 
base in Spangdahlem, Germany. The A-10s carry 30 milimeter cannons 
designed to fight armored forces. International efforts to end the 
seven-month crisis have accelerated following allegations that Serb 
police massacred scores of ethnic Albanian refugees. Concern is mounting 
that winter will bring a humanitarian disaster if thousands remain 
homeless by the time the first snows fall. In Sofia, Bulgaria, U.S. 
first lady Hillary Rodham Clinton told an international women's conference 
that the world ``must speak with one voice to end what is both a humanitarian 
crisis and violation of humanity'' in Kosovo.
