The Arab League praised the leaders of Yemen and Eritrea Sunday, saying 
they spared the Middle East ``the agony of war'' when they resorted 
to international arbitration to resolve a dispute over Red Sea islands. 
An international arbitration panel in The Hague on Friday granted 
Yemen control of three Red Sea islands, a decision that Eritrea said 
it accepts. The 22-member Arab League called the arbitration ``a civilized 
choice... that spared the region the agony of war.'' ``It is a real 
victory for peace,'' the statement added. Yemen and Eritrea both claimed 
the three islands, one of which, the Greater Hanish, was captured 
by Eritrea in a brief battle in December 1995. Yemen retained control 
of the other two, Lesser Hanish and Zuqar. The tribunal awarded all 
three islands to Yemen and stipulated that the decision should be 
complied with within 90 days. The islands sit across one of the world's 
major shipping lanes, 160 kilometers (100 miles) north of the Bab 
el-Mandeb strait at the southern entrance to the Red Sea.
