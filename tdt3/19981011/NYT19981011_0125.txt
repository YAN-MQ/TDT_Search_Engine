Liz Phair loves to hear a crowd roar for her. ``I wish I could tape-record 
everything you guys are saying out there,'' she said, grinning hugely, 
at Roseland on Thursday night. Then she lifted her slender arms in 
a come-on gesture to get her fans to yell more. She adores that sound, 
not because it signals solidarity or whatever else women in rock are 
supposed to champion, but just because it turns her on. Ms. Phair 
has been accused of many things since releasing her debut album, ``Exile 
in Guyville'' (Matador/Capitol), in 1993. Vanity is certainly one 
of them. Evidence of it abounded at Roseland, starting with a preperformance 
slide show that captured Ms. Phair in myriad poses: baring her breasts, 
smooching some guy, guzzling a beer. Watching the images revolve to 
a soundtrack of her favorite pop hits was like getting stuck between 
the translucent pages of her favorite photo album. Yet those who begrudge 
the Oberlin-educated singer her prettiness and privilege don't see 
that her sense of entitlement is exactly the point. This projection 
of a big, bad self defines her artistry. Very few women have acted 
so sure that they had a right to be rock stars. Many have fought for 
that status, stolen it or changed it to fit them. But Ms. Phair simply 
spoke the language. She gained notoriety for using dirty words, but 
her voice mattered more. Adopting a dry, conversational tone, she 
rejected the female singer's usual aura of vulnerability working toward 
strength. She sang about her needs as if they were important, and 
not only to her. Her subjects, mostly love botched, were familiar. 
But her ability to assume a man's prerogative while maintaining a 
female perspective was new. At Roseland, she fulfilled another aspect 
of her promise by claiming the role of band leader. Gone was the awkwardness 
of her early live performances, which contrasted so strangely with 
her recordings. Defiantly glamorous in strappy high heels, she led 
her five-piece group with exhilarated poise. She played inventive 
rhythm guitar; when she removed the instrument to better vocalize, 
she hit every tough note. New selections from ``Whitechocolatespaceegg,'' 
her latest album, show Ms. Phair's growth as a songwriter; she fleshes 
out characters other than herself now. Her music has matured, too, 
into feisty mainstream power pop. New versions of her earlier songs 
revealed that this big sound always lurked within them.
