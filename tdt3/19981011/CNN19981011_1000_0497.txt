With a look at your "Headline News weather," I'm Karen McGinnis. It's 
going to be rather blustery and chilly across the northern tier into 
the Great Lakes and Hudson bay. Temperatures mostly in the 50s and 
some 40s in the central prairie provinces of Canada. Mostly 70s and 
80s dominate the southern third of the United States. Still, a soggy 
forecast into New England. As we head on into Monday evening, the 
area of low pressure low to move away off the eastern seaboard. While 
there is a developing system across the northern great plains, there 
will be a little bit of snowfall that we can expect across the central 
prairie provinces of Canada. And yet another wet weather system moves 
on shore for the pacific northwest. If you're looking at Alaska, Hawaii 
and the Caribbean, it shapes up like this. Cloudy skies for Fairbanks. 
And about 87 degrees forecast for Honolulu. In our extended forecast, 
the rainfall could be heavy coming up on Tuesday for the northwest. 
For Wednesday, we could see a little bit of rain wrapped around the 
Great Lakes region. And then by Thursday, the coolest readings into 
the Great Lakes. For more weather information, log onto CNN.com.
