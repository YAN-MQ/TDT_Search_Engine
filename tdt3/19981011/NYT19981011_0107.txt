To put it bluntly, Michael Naumann swims with the sharks instead of 
the carps since he abandoned the rarefied world of New York publishing 
for a rank as German culture minister and a political career that 
can so far be counted by the months. Still, though he's now a nouveau 
politician and no longer chief executive of the publishing house Henry 
Holt &AMP; Co., part of Verlagsgruppe Georg von Holtzbrinck, he came 
to mingle with publishers at the 50th annual Frankfurt Book Fair. 
The sprawling yearly rite of the book industry last week drew some 
6,700 national publishers promoting more than 360,000 titles. It was 
a literary homecoming for Naumann, 56, who for years roamed the vast 
exhibition space as a publisher for Henry Holt and before that as 
head of the German publishing house Rowohlt Verlag. At the cramped 
Henry Holt booth, there was no publisher in evidence this week to 
replace Naumann, who abruptly resigned last summer. He agreed then 
to take the ministry position if the Social Democrats won national 
elections, which they did this month. Yet, here at the book fair, 
the new culture minister was still willing to promote Henry Holt titles 
developed under his watch, like a biography of Anne Frank. But there 
are clear limits on what Naumann will promote in his new role as a 
publisher turned politician. German literature, for instance. ``If 
I start to promote a book for one publisher, then 10 others will get 
angry,'' he said after appearing on a panel discussing the market 
for German literature. ``Don't expect Michael Naumann to run around 
saying, `Buy German literature.' What you do is provide financial 
support to institutions that are already doing this work.'' With a 
$2 billion budget, Naumann no longer has to worry about book sales; 
he will be doling out money to support major symphonies, museums and 
castles. One of his primary goals is to nurture and develop cultural 
institutions in eastern Germany, he said. He also has plans to start 
musical academies for young people and a refugee program for writers 
and intellectuals exiled from their home countries. In the gossipy 
publishing world that he fled, Naumann's frank comments sometimes 
kept him from being a popular figure. He irritated some U.S. publishers 
with his decision to boycott the annual National Book Awards dinner 
when the judges failed to nominate his author, Thomas Pynchon, for 
a prize for ``Mason &AMP; Dixon.'' Several U.S. publishers questioned 
any criticism from Holt, saying that it had suffered losses up to 
$8 million last year. Such griping seems rather tame now to Naumann, 
who said he had quickly learned the differences between the cultures 
of publishing and politics. Without being specific, he complained 
about turf disputes. ``I always thought that publishing, in a way, 
is full of sharks,'' he said. ``I now know we are all carps _ carps 
compared to the sharks of politics.'' Naumann has already made his 
mark in his new environment, particularly with his penchant for outspokenness. 
Just a few days after he was nominated to be the Social Democrats' 
cultural czar, he stirred a fiery debate by raising the issue of whether 
Germany should abandon its project to build a huge memorial to victims 
of the Nazi Holocaust near the Reichstag building, the national parliament 
house in Berlin. ``The real memorials in Germany are the concentration 
camps,'' he said at the time, adding that the memorial would ``not 
lead psychologically to what a simple visit to Bergen-Belsen evokes 
in a more shocking manner.'' Helmut Kohl, who was toppled as chancellor 
in the election last month, mused after Naumann made his comments: 
``It's hard to see how you could smash much more china than this man 
has done in just a few hours.'' At the Frankfurt fair, some Germans 
in publishing circles were still talking about election-night news 
clips that they said showed Naumann jockeying to get closer to the 
newly elected chancellor, Gerhard Schroeder. With his political career 
just two months old, Naumann said he now understood the attractions 
of politics, although the ministry position represents a two-thirds 
cut in pay from what he was making at Holt. There was the moment when 
he returned to Koethen, his hometown in the former East Germany, where 
a former classmate is now the mayor, and was greeted by people he 
hadn't seen in 40 years. ``I'm finding out why politicians do this,'' 
he said. ``It's exciting. It gets the adrenaline going. You get your 
highs through huge crowds.'' Just last year, Naumann considered applying 
for U.S. citizenship, a step that obviously is foreclosed now for 
him. ``To be frank, I miss America,'' he said as he walked away from 
the book fair. ``If this fails,'' he added, ``I don't have any doubt 
that I would turn around with my suitcase and go back to try to find 
a job in the United States.''
