President Clinton is focusing his attention on federal spending today. 
He will be meeting a little over an hour from now with his budget 
team and later with top congressional democrats. They'll review the 
status of talks with republicans who now appear willing to give the 
president some of the money he wants for education. The budget negotiations 
have caused the president to delay a fundraising trip to New York 
until late tomorrow. Both the house and Senate were in session yesterday. 
They will resume work tomorrow, and a top order of business will be 
passing another stopgap spending measure. If one isn't passed, much 
of the government will run out of money at midnight tomorrow.
