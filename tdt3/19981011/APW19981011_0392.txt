ASTROMERITIS, Cyprus (AP) - Cypriot President Glafcos Clerides said 
Sunday that pressure from the international community was needed to 
ensure that Turkey implements Security Council resolutions for the 
reunification of the war-divided island. ``We will do everything possible 
to find a solution within the framework of the U.N. resolutions,'' 
Glafcos Clerides told a protest rally by Greek Cypriot refugees. ``However, 
our political will is not enough... What is needed is a more determined 
intervention on the part of the international community toward the 
Turkish side,'' he said. ``We want a Cyprus where all human rights 
are restored, including the right of refugees to return to their homes,'' 
Clerides told a rally of some 3,000 refugees. The refugees from the 
Turkish-occupied north of the island were staging their annual protest 
against the refusal of the Turkish authorities to allow their return. 
The refugees fled or were forced from their homes in the wake of the 
1974 Turkish invasion and occupation of north Cyprus which was sparked 
by an abortive coup by supporters of union with Greece. A breakaway 
Turkish Cypriot state in the north is only recognized by Turkey which 
maintains 35,000 troops there. The U.N. resolutions call for the reunification 
of Cyprus in a bizonal federation, the return of all refugees and 
the withdrawal of the estimated 35,000 Turkish troops and 50,000 mainland 
settlers from the north.
