There is more to ballet in Russia than its best-known companies, the 
Bolshoi and the Kirov. The second major troupe in Moscow, after the 
Bolshoi, is the Stanislavsky and Nemirovich-Danchenko Ballet, to make 
its U.S. debut on Dec. 19 at the John F. Kennedy Center for the Performing 
Arts in Washington. There was a glimpse of the Stanislavsky's leading 
dancers in the New York area, thanks to a presentation of the Russian 
Ballet School in Sea Cliff, N.Y., on Thursday night. Natalya Ledovskaya, 
a strong, beautifully schooled ballerina who exudes a feminine perfume, 
and Vladimir Kirillov, a superb partner with Romantic good looks, 
appeared as guests in a showcase at the school. Konstantin Uralsky, 
a former dancer in the Bolshoi who was artistic director of Ballet 
Iowa in Des Moines from 1991 to 1997, and his wife, Irina Vassileni-Uralsky, 
also once in the Bolshoi, invited Russian-trained dancers who lived 
either in the United States or in Russia for this official opening 
of their school. Uralsky also announced plans for a professional chamber 
ballet troupe and introduced Olga Lepeshinskaya, whose career at the 
Bolshoi from 1933 to 1963 made her one of Soviet ballet's best-known 
stars. Ms. Lepeshinskaya, 86, came from Moscow as president of the 
Russian Dance Association to declare the Uralsky School accredited. 
It is up to Americans to decide whether certificates make a difference. 
But the dancers on view made a case for Russian training. Ekaterina 
Shelkanova, formerly with the Kirov and now a soloist in American 
Ballet Theater, danced the adagio from ``Le Corsaire'' with Alexander 
Kedrov, formerly of the Bolshoi and the Boston Ballet (he also performed 
a solo from Uralsky's ``Petrouchka''). Anatoly Barzov, dean of the 
dance division of the New University of Humanities in Moscow presented 
three fresh and impeccably drilled 13-year-olds identified as Mariya, 
Yuliya and Andrei, in excerpts. One was the pas de trois from Vassily 
Vainonen's ``Nutcracker,'' in which Ms. Ledovskaya is to star. At 
this showing, she was seen in contemporary choreography, including 
a duet from ``The Phantom Ball'' set to Chopin. Dmitri Briantsev, 
the Stanislavsky's artistic director, is not strong on transitions 
or organic flow. But Ms. Ledovskaya and Kirillov looked perfectly 
at ease in this mix of the romantic and the acrobatic. Partings and 
embraces, full of twists, were serenely rendered by the dancers. At 
heart, they were dramatically intense and they made something out 
of the lifts and slides, recalling skating images, in ``On the Edge,'' 
choreographed by Alex Ursuliak of the Stuttgart Ballet Academy, to 
music from the film ``Titanic.'' One looks forward to seeing them 
in Washington.
