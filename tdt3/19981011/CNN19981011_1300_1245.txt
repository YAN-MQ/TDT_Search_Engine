First up the NFL and week six, the bills on the road with the Colts 
two, teams needing a win to stay alive in the AFC east division. The 
Cowboys hosting the Panthers Carolina at 0-4 looking for their first 
win of the season. The chiefs and Patriots, both teams fighting for 
AFC division titles. The steelers against the bengals Cincinnati quarterback 
Neil O'Donnell going up against his former team. The 49ers looking 
to maintain their share of the NFC lead. As they play the saints. 
The Oilers out to pick up their second straight win with a victory 
over the Ravens. It's the 0-5 Redskins against the 0-5 Eagles. Coming 
up later today, two of the top three passners league history square 
off at the kingdome when the Broncos visit the seahawks in a AFC west 
battle. This is the kind of game you want to play in. Because you're 
playing against the best team in the league and that's how you measure 
up how good you are. It's too early for a must-win. But this is a 
big win, this would be a big win for us.
