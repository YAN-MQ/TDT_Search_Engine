The Brazilian passion known as soccer to the rest of the world might 
be even more popular if it weren't for the violence that surrounds 
the club matches. In a poll by Ibope, commissioned by and published 
Sunday in the sports daily Lance!, 61 percent of 3,000 soccer fans 
surveyed said they stayed away from matches because of hooliganism. 
``The problem (of hooliganism) is much the same as in England. There 
is a very active minority of fans involved,'' said Col. Silvio Roberto 
Villar, who heads policing of Sao Paulo soccer stadiums, in an interview 
with radio station CBN on Sunday. ``Ideally, supporters should not 
to wear their teams' colors when leaving stadiums in case they are 
attacked. It's an absurd situation but that is the state of things.'' 
Since the early 1990s, fan clubs of club teams _ known throughout 
South America as ``Barras Bravas'' _ have clashed sporadically in 
Brazil, causing the deaths of two teen-agers in the last three years. 
Last season, a youth was killed in a street fight following a game 
between Rio teams Flamengo and Vasco da Gama. In Sao Paulo, a 16-year-old 
died during a 1995 stadium riot involving fans of Sao Paulo FC and 
Palmeiras, prompting a judge to ban fan club members from city stadiums. 
Since then, security cameras have been installed in Rio's famed Maracana 
Stadium to clamp down on violence and meeting rooms for fan clubs 
have been shut. The Ibope survey found the other major reason keeping 
fans away from games is high ticket prices, cited by 16 percent as 
a problem. Fourteen percent said ``poorly organized'' leagues were 
the chief reason they missed matches. The survey's margin of error 
was given as 1.8 percent. Attendances at Brazilian soccer matches 
have fallen over the last two years although no exact figures were 
available.
