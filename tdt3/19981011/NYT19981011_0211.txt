The New York Times said in an editorial on Monday, Oct. 12: New Jersey 
may soon be positioned to convert its car-pool lanes on Interstate 
287 into regular lanes, thanks to the footwork of some members of 
its congressional delegation. They crafted legislative language that 
would relieve New Jersey of the obligation to repay Washington $140 
million in federal money spent building the lanes. This maneuver is 
the latest expression of growing opposition in New Jersey and Long 
Island, N.Y., to special lanes for car pools _ an unfortunate attitude 
in a region of congested roads and poor air quality. Instead, officials 
ought to be emulating cities elsewhere that have found ways to get 
more out of underutilized car-pool lanes. The San Diego region provides 
a good example of how market forces can cut congestion. On Interstate 
15, an eight-mile stretch is free for buses, vans and car pools of 
two or more. Solo motorists pay a toll, generally from 50 cents to 
$4, pegged to the time of day and congestion. By purchasing access 
to lanes that speed one's commute, these motorists, along with car 
poolers, free up space in regular lanes. Revenue from this creative 
pricing finances bus service in the I-15 corridor. Except for a long-range 
study or two, the New York region has not begun to address managing 
demand in an equally imaginative fashion. Instead, some politicians 
want to turn high-occupancy vehicle, or HOV, lanes on the Long Island 
Expressway into general-occupancy lanes. Jerseyans want to end HOV 
lanes on I-287 and I-80. None of this augurs well for a region that 
hopes to add tens of thousands of jobs _ and thus commuters _ in the 
years ahead.
