The movie "Casablanca" has taken on the status of a cultural myth. 
But did you ever wonder what might have become of the main characters 
after that last scene at the airport? Charles Feldman has the answer. 
Play it, Sam. Play "as time goes by." Little did ilsa know that when 
she spoke those now immortal words, back in the days when the world 
was all black and white, she'd be providing the title for a new novel 
that picks up where "Casablanca" the movie left off. The new book 
has just hit the bookstores, but the whole idea of doing a "Casablanca" 
sequel has hit some like a ton of moroccan bricks. I see no reason 
for this thing to come into existence, except that somebody is going 
to make a Buck off of it. Aljean harmetz wrote a book about the making 
of "Casablanca." She's not against sequels per Se, but she says the 
movie had the perfect ending. It was during the second world war. 
The lives of three little people didn't amount to a hill of beans 
in that world, and all three of them had to put their personal lives 
behind them for the good of humanity. Which brings us back to the 
key question about the sequel -- why? Well, why not? Great cultural 
myths deserve to be added to. We've done this throughout time immemorial, 
starting with the greeks. Like the movie, the new novel is a time 
Warner property -- the same company which owns CNN. In a 1994 interview, 
one of the screenwriters of "Casablanca" told us Warner brothers had 
bugged him for years to do a sequel. I wouldn't go near it. I wouldn't 
go near it. They're doing anything that can improve the bottom line. 
The bottom line here is pretty simple. You can buy the new book and 
learn about what happens to the main characters -- or you can let 
bogie have the last word. Here's looking at you, kid. Charles Feldman, 
CNN, Los Angeles.
