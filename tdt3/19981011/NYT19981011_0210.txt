The New York Times said in an editorial on Monday, Oct. 12: The visit 
of the Irish republican leader Gerry Adams to Spain's Basque country 
last week suggests that peace can be contagious. Adams' visit came 
three weeks after the Basque nationalist terror group, ETA, for the 
first time announced an unconditional and indefinite cease-fire. The 
ETA's apparent decision to pursue its goal of independence for the 
Basque country through politics alone, after a 30-year conflict that 
has killed 800 people, seems in part inspired by Northern Ireland's 
peace effort. Now the Spanish government should respond with conciliatory 
gestures to create lasting peace. Contacts between Sinn Fein, the 
political arm of the Irish Republican Army, and ETA's political wing, 
Herri Batasuna, began a dozen years ago, and members of the two organizations 
have visited each other frequently. The turn toward politics was helped 
by the ETA's recent military decline, and its drop in public support 
after several recent brutal murders of popular Basque and Spanish 
politicians. Basques were repressed under Spain's dictator, Gen. Francisco 
Franco. Children, for example, were punished for speaking the Basque 
language in school. Though democratic Spanish governments have resorted 
to terror tactics to fight the ETA, they have also granted substantial 
autonomy to the three-province region known as the Basque Country. 
It has its own police, taxes, language and parliament, now led by 
a nonviolent Basque nationalist party. Separatists, however, want 
a referendum on independence. Although it is likely that nationalists 
would lose a referendum, Madrid has never permitted one. Spain's constitution 
does not provide for such votes, and Madrid is afraid of independence 
fever spreading to Catalonia, another autonomous region. Spain is 
right to insist on its territorial integrity. But it should not treat 
the ETA's cease-fire as unconditional surrender. Now that the ETA 
apparently has renounced violence, Spain should begin a real peace 
process _ including humanitarian gestures like moving ETA prisoners, 
who are scattered throughout Spain, closer to their families in the 
Basque country. It should also release the 23 Herri Batasuna leaders 
sentenced last year to seven-year terms for showing a pro-ETA video 
on television. Such moves will encourage the ETA to disarm, and help 
prevent the rise of splinter groups.
