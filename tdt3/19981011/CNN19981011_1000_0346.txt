It was homecoming yesterday at the University of Wyoming, and fellow 
students carried banners for Matthew shepard. The 21-year-old lies 
in critical condition in a Colorado hospital after he was robbed, 
beaten and left for dead last week, apparently because he is gay. 
Hospital officials say his condition has worsened slightly. Two men 
and a woman have been charged. A second woman was arrested and may 
also face charges. Yesterday, shepard's parents released a statement 
on their son's behalf. We feel that if he were giving this statement 
himself, he would emphasize he does not want the horrible actions 
of the few very disturbed individuals to Mar the fine reputations 
of laramie or the University. Political leaders ranging from President 
Clinton to house speaker Newt Gingrich are condemning the attack on 
shepard. Gay rights activists say it shows the need for tougher hate 
crime laws.
