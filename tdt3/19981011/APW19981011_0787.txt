Felipe Alou has rejected an offer to become the manager of the Los 
Angeles Dodgers and accepted another to remain with the Montreal Expos. 
``I'm glad to say I'll stay at home,'' Alou said Sunday after agreeing 
to a three-year contract to remain manager of the Expos. ``But I have 
to be honest _ I thought I was gone.'' In fact, Alou was booked on 
a flight to Los Angeles when the Expos called. ``But some Expos people 
requested that I wait because they had something to offer me,'' Alou 
said. General manager Jim Beattie and Mark Routtenberg, a member of 
the Expos' ownership group, met with Alou at his Florida home on Friday 
and convinced him to stay. ``The Dodgers were coming in on the next 
plane from Santo Domingo to finalize the agreement,'' Alou said. ``But 
the Expos made an awesome offer. ``There was about a 10-minute difference. 
Otherwise, I'd be on a flight to L.A.'' Alou's contract is believed 
to be worth about dlrs 2 million per year. Los Angeles was reported 
to have offered the 63-year-old manager a three-year contract worth 
a total of dlrs 3.5 million to dlrs 4 million. The contract includes 
escape clauses that will allow him to go to another team if the U.S. 
Major League Baseball club is sold and moves to another city.
