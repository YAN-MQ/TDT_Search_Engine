Customs officials seized four illegal shipments of Viagra that entered 
the country over the past month, a newspaper reported Sunday. The 
action came as South Africa prepares to legally market the sex potency 
drug later this month. The illegal pills entered the country via airfreight, 
the Sunday Times of Johannesburg reported. The pills will cost about 
100 rand (dlrs 18) each in South Africa. The storage venue for legally 
imported quantities of the drug is being kept secret for security 
reasons, said Medicines Control Council chairwoman Dr. Helen Rees. 
Police recently arrested a Polish citizen trying to sell 120 Viagra 
tablets. The paper said customs officials refused to reveal how many 
illegal pills they had impounded.
