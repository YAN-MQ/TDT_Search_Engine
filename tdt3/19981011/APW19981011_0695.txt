For someone who had never run a marathon before, Ondoro Osoro seems 
to have the hang of it. On a day when Kenyans ruled the Chicago Marathon, 
the former cross-country runner won in 2 hours, 6 minutes and 54 seconds, 
the third-fastest time in history. His time Sunday was 49 seconds 
off the world record, set by Ronaldo Da Costa at last month's Berlin 
Marathon. Joyce Chepchumba, winner of the 1997 London Marathon, completed 
the Kenyan sweep, winning the women's race with a personal best of 
2:23:57. ``It was my first marathon and I think I'm very happy,'' 
Osoro said, his smile as bright as the medal hanging around his neck. 
``I must be a lucky man today, running for the first time and running 
very well.'' Osoro made a late surge, overtaking defending champion 
Khalid Khannouchi of Morocco in the last 1 1-2 kilometers (mile). 
Osoro, who missed almost two years while recuperating from a 1995 
car accident, raised his arms as he crossed the finish line, and race 
director Carey Pinkowski grabbed him in a bear hug. He set records 
for debut and North American marathons, and broke the course record 
of 2:07:10, set last year by Khannouchi, who also won in his first 
marathon. Khannouchi, who now lives in the United States, finished 
second at 2:07:19. Gert Thys of South Africa was third at 2:07:43, 
and Joseph Kahugu, another Kenyan, was fourth at 2:07:57. It was the 
first race in which four runners broke 2:08. ``I got cramps the last 
two miles (3 kilometers),'' said Khannouchi, who had a sore ankle 
the past two weeks and finished the race limping. ``I was almost going 
to drop off the last two miles (3 kilometers), but I just made it 
all the way.'' Chepchumba wasn't a factor early, as South Africans 
Colleen de Reuck and Elana Meyer ran 1-2. De Reuck pulled away from 
Meyer at the 23rd kilometer (14th mile), and by the 34th kilometer 
(21st mile), she had a 21-second lead on Chepchumba. But when de Reuck's 
leg started hurting, Chepchumba quickly caught up to her and flew 
by just before the 35th-kilometer (22nd-mile) mark. ``I kept looking 
back, thinking she could come back. I thought she could come back 
because I was tired,'' Chepchumba said. ``When I entered the bridge 
(about a mile from the finish), I didn't see anybody, so I thought 
I could make it.'' De Reuck finished second at 2:27:04, and Meyer 
was third at 2:27:20. Osoro, who started road racing full-time only 
last year, didn't even want to come to the Chicago Marathon. When 
his agent first asked him, he said no because he wouldn't get any 
appearance fees. But after thinking about it some more, he agreed. 
``I don't run because I need money. I like running. So I said `OK, 
I will try and run my best,''' said Osoro, whose victory earned him 
dlrs 105,000. ``My coming was good.'' Khannouchi took the lead at 
the 34th kilometer (21st mile), moving inside and past Kahugu as they 
rounded a corner. He built a solid lead, and seemed to be headed for 
his second title. But Osoro was always behind him, hanging back just 
a bit. ``When you're running, you never know if the person in front 
of you has energy,'' said Osoro, who trailed by five seconds at the 
40th kilometer (25th mile). ``You have to try and catch him, so that's 
what I did. I tried to catch him.'' With about a kilometer (less than 
a mile) to go, Osoro made his move. He went past Khannouchi with a 
burst of speed as they passed Soldier Field, and opened a comfortable 
lead with another sprint. ``I wanted to run so fast that when it came 
time to sprint, I was already gone because he's a very good sprinter,'' 
Osoro said. ``I continued to push because I knew he's very fast in 
finishing.'' Now that he's won, Osoro won't hesitate about running 
in 1999. ``I'd like to come next year,'' he said. ``Maybe they'll 
invite me again.''
