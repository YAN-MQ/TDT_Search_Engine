On the morning after he ran third in the Jockey Club Gold Cup at Belmont 
Park and lost for the first time in 10 races, Skip Away was nursing 
a swollen right front ankle on Sunday. But his trainer, Sonny Hine, 
said he was ``95 percent sure'' that Skip Away would run in the $4 
million Breeders' Cup Classic and pursue his goal to become racing's 
richest horse. ``Skippy's ankle blew up three or four times as big 
as it was after the race,'' Hine said. ``There's a lot of heat and 
inflammation, but he's sound. If we go to the Breeders' Cup will depend 
on what I can accomplish in a week, but I'm 95 percent sure we'll 
run there.'' Skip Away's loss was his first in a year, and it came 
after a grinding duel on a muddy track with Gentlemen, the West Coast 
superstar. They ran 1-2 in the Woodward three weeks ago and were expected 
to dominate the Gold Cup. But after flying a mile in 1:34 1/5, they 
were caught from behind by Wagon Limit, a 34-1 long shot who had been 
racing in last place for most of the way. ``Jerry Bailey told me that 
Skippy leaped a path over by the chute where they turn the tractors,'' 
Hine said. ``That must have been where he hurt himself. He had a little 
filling last night, and we expected it to blow up, but not as much 
as it did. We didn't give him anything because we didn't want to mask 
anything. We wanted to know exactly what it was we had to deal with. 
``I hope to get him back on track in a week or so, but he may not 
let me wait that long. He chased me out of his stall this morning. 
He's sound, believe me, we just have to get rid of the filling.'' 
Skip Away won $110,000 for running third, leaving him with career 
earnings of $9.6 million. He needs about $400,000 to pass Cigar's 
record of just under $10 million. Wagon Limit, who pulled off the 
upset with a cunning ride by Robbie Davis, also might return for a 
rematch in the Classic. But his trainer, Allen Jerkens, the man who 
has engineered upsets over Secretariat and Kelso and now Skip Away, 
sounded modest in victory. ``It just goes to show,'' he said, ``that 
when you're lucky and you have a horse that's ready, anything can 
happen. I've seen it so many times over the years at Belmont. You 
had two horses going at it, and they went the first quarter in 23 
3/5 seconds, they did a half-mile in 46 2/5 and three-quarters in 
1:09 3/5. That's going to take a toll on any horse.'' Gentlemen, who 
is 6 years old, jogged around his barn and impressed his trainer, 
Richard Mandella, who said: ``He ran another great race. I thought 
he was home, and then this other horse comes out of nowhere. It's 
funny because I looked at the entries the other day and said: `Now, 
why is Allen Jerkens in here?''' Mandella indicated that both the 
Breeders' Cup Classic and the $1 million Breeders' Cup Mile were possible 
targets for Gentlemen.
