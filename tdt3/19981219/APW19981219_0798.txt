LONDON (AP) _ U.S. and British forces are ``well on course to meet 
our objectives,'' Prime Minister Tony Blair said Saturday, but he 
said attacks in Iraq would continue until military goals are achieved. 
British jets based in Kuwait were joining in a fourth day of attacks, 
Blair confirmed. ``As well as the military dimension we are already 
in discussion with our colleagues and allies and partners around the 
world as to how we adopt a forward strategy to insure that three is 
containment and stability in the long term,'' he said at a brief news 
conference at 10 Downing St., his official residence. A Royal Air 
Force spokesman in Kuwait said that all British jets which took part 
in raids Saturday had returned to base. ``A number of Tornado aircraft 
took part in sorties tonight and completed their missions successfully,'' 
the spokesman, speaking on conditions of customary anonymity, said.
