And the vote now is over. In the house, the motion to table the appeal 
from the ruling of the chair. Again, the chair overruled the democrats' 
bid to bring up a censure motion. If the democrats are going to walk 
out, as they threatened to do, and they are now clustered around the 
well of the house, they would do so now. They may not do that. But, 
again, they have been thwarted in their attempt to have censure debated 
as an alternative to impeachment. The vote, a rather lop sided 226 
to 230 rather to 203. White House press secretary Joe Lockhart says 
he hopes Bob Livingston will reconsider. He says the president still 
has no intention of resigning. Lockhart called for an end to what 
he termed "the politics of personal destruction."
