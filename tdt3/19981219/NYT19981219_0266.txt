To many of the staunch conservatives who have disdained Bill Clinton 
from the start, the impeachment of the president brought unwavering 
approval but little cheering. ``It's the right thing, but I feel very 
sad today,'' said Wyatt Waterman, 42, the assistant manager of a bookstore. 
``It's not good for the country, and it's not good for us as a nation 
to watch. But there was no alternative. He committed perjury.'' In 
this sharply conservative western suburb of Chicago, the home of Wheaton 
College, a school that hews to the literal words of the Bible, the 
vote to put Clinton on trial in the Senate was greeted with quiet 
praise, especially for Republican Rep. Henry Hyde, who represents 
the district. In a barbershop on Front Street, Doug Wicks, a 39-year-old 
sales manager, said that ``Clinton's getting what he deserved,'' but 
he added, ``I hate to see it _ this man's got a family of his own, 
and loyal supporters.'' To be sure, not everyone was feeling sorry 
for Clinton. ``He's a liar, an adulterer, a bribe-taker,'' said Joe 
Maurer, 67. ``The man is a public disgrace. Not only should he be 
out of office, he ought to be behind bars.'' But in general, few people 
in Wheaton seemed to have a visceral reaction to the impeachment. 
Most often, they shook their heads and spoke in somber tones. Most 
said Congress simply had no choice. To Andy Pilipzcuk, 26, voting 
against impeachment would have lowered the standard of behavior expected 
of public officials. ``We can't let the next generation think this 
kind of behavior is acceptable,'' he said. Virtually no one here relishes 
a trial in the Senate. All of Clinton's critics, and even a defender 
or two, called on the president to step down. ``I just wish he'd resign,'' 
said Nancy Lewis, 46, as she shopped for Christmas presents at the 
college bookstore, where a book featured in the window was titled, 
``Tell Me the Truth,'' about the importance of fidelity and family 
values. To Ms. Lewis, punishment was only just for a president who, 
in her view, had abused his power, especially when it came to women. 
``I'm not a women's libber at all, but he's taken advantage of women,'' 
she said. She said that she was ``not vindictive _ we all have problems,'' 
but that Clinton should ``do the respectful thing and step down.'' 
Wicks, who also called on the president to resign, said he mostly 
feared that a long trial in the Senate could ``ruin the economy, the 
stock market, the holidays.'' Even in a place like Wheaton, however, 
there were people who registered objection to the impeachment of Clinton 
over actions tied to a sexual affair, and saw hypocrisy in many of 
the denunciations. ``Let God judge,'' said Sunny Hardwick, fairly 
trembling with anger, as she clipped the hair of a man who sharply 
criticized the president. Ms. Hardwick said that, as a devout Christian, 
she was spending her time ``praying for the president'' instead of 
throwing stones. Ruth Volle, too, said she abhorred the actions by 
Congress, and the invasions into his private life. ``From the beginning, 
he should have just said, `It's none of your business.''' But the 
overwhelming majority of people here said they welcomed the impeachment, 
even if they found little joy in the president's comeuppance. And 
almost all of them said they hoped Clinton would leave office without 
subjecting the nation to a tawdry ordeal in the Senate. ``We have 
to uphold the Constitution,'' said Scott Mathias, 40. ``I'm pleased 
by the impeachment, but saddened. I just don't think there was any 
choice here.''
