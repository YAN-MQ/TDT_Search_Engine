Fed-ex and the union representing its pilots have reached a tentative 
agreement. The contract calls for a 17% pay increase over five years 
for the 3,500 fed-ex pilots. If ratified by the fed-ex pilots association 
and its members, the agreement will give the pilots more control over 
their working schedules. The pilots threatened to strike last month 
due to a pay dispute that began in July.
