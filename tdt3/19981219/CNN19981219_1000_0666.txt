Iraqi newspapers are condemning the joint U.S. and British air strikes 
against Iraq. That comes a day after Iraqi President Saddam Hussein 
told his people in a Taped TV address that Iraq won't back down. Saddam 
referred to the U.S. and Britain as "barbaric criminals" and "Subordinates 
of satan." He called on Iraqis to continue their resistance.
