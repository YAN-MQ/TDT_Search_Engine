Thunderous blasts rocked Baghdad before dawn on Saturday, with U.S. 
and British forces pressing a punishing air offensive on Iraq for 
a third night. Reporters saw fiery streaks from what appeared to be 
Tomahawk cruise missiles arcing across the sky and landing in giant 
fireballs. Warheads exploded a few seconds later, lighting the pre-dawn 
horizon in a red glow that silhouetted palm trees against the dark 
sky. Iraqi anti-aircraft gunners on rooftops opened fire, filling 
the sky with booms and bright red flashes. Orange tracer bullets streaked 
high above. When the attack ended, ambulances or fire trucks with 
sirens blaring were heard speeding away. Officials, who must escort 
journalists wishing to tour the city, refused to take them to the 
targeted areas. Baghdad residents said damage from the Friday and 
Saturday attacks was heavy and that a number of buildings in the center 
of the capital _ including palaces, security headquarters and offices 
of the ruling Baath Party _ had been hit. Western reporters staying 
at Al-Rashid Hotel in central Baghdad saw explosions in nearby areas 
known to have palaces, a headquarters of the Special Security service 
and the command center for the Popular Army, which is a paramilitary 
force. The walls of the Military Industrialization Corporation, which 
oversees state-run factories, were still standing, but the building 
appeared to have been gutted by missiles. Saturday's attack appeared 
to be the toughest yet against Baghdad since the U.S. and British 
militaries began air strikes early Thursday to punish Iraq for its 
obstruction of U.N. inspectors searching for evidence of weapons of 
mass destruction. Before Saturday's attack, the United States fired 
nearly 300 Tomahawk cruise missiles from ships in the Gulf or from 
B-52 bomber aircraft. The missiles carry warheads weighing up to 1,350 
kilograms (3,000 pounds). Iraq says 25 people were killed and 75 injured 
in the first two nights of attacks. On Saturday, the state-run Iraqi 
News Agency said five more people were killed and 21 wounded in a 
missile attack on the Al-Riyad neighborhood of the northern town of 
Kirkuk. The report said an agricultural training center and a number 
of houses were damaged. Meanwhile, a second U.S. aircraft carrier 
battle group _ led by the USS Carl Vinson _ moved into the Gulf to 
join the USS Enterprise group, U.S. Navy officials said.
