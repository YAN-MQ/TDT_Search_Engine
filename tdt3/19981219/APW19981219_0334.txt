Pope John Paul II is still hoping to visit Iraq in 2000, the Vatican's 
secretary of state said Saturday as he renewed the Holy See's call 
for the end to the U.S-British bombings. Cardinal Angelo Sodano's, 
the Vatican's No. 2 official, was asked by reporters at a ceremony 
if John Paul might make the journey as part of Holy Year activities. 
``We hope so,'' Sodano replied. ``It's in our prayers.'' The pope 
has mentioned more than once that he would like to make a pilgrimage 
to Iraq, which includes the Biblical birthplace of Abraham, but no 
plans for such a visit have been announced. Asked if the bombings 
constituted an aggression, the cardinal replied: ``Either it's a war 
of defense or a war of aggression. There's no middle ground.'' Sodano 
added: ``I hope that, after these three days, by now the bombings 
are over.'' Earlier in the week, the Vatican's spokesman, Joaquin 
Navarro-Valls, said the pope was saddened by the airstrikes and that 
the Holy See hoped for a quick end to what it termed aggression.
