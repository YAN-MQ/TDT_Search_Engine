A prominent Muslim leader met Indonesia's ex-President Suharto on 
Saturday in a sign the former authoritarian head of state is still 
viewed as a powerful figure by many of his countrymen. After the meeting, 
Muslim leader Abdurrahman Wahid said he had suggested a four-person 
meeting on the future of the troubled Southeast Asian nation that 
would include himself and Suharto. The other two participants would 
be President B.J. Habibie, Suharto's successor and onetime protege, 
and Gen. Wiranto, chief of the politically powerful military. Suharto, 
77, quit in May after riots and protests against his 32-year rule 
and has been living as a virtual recluse in his affluent Jakarta home. 
However, many Indonesians believe he continues to exert influence 
over Habibie and the government, which includes many appointees who 
owe their careers to Suharto. Student protesters have been pressing 
for a trial of Suharto on charges of corruption and human rights abuses, 
and have labeled as cosmetic a government investigation of the former 
president. Wahid, who heads the country's largest Muslim organization, 
Nahdlatul Ulama, and has founded his own political party, met Suharto 
at his house for one and a half hours. He said Suharto accepted his 
suggestion for a dialogue and said the country's leaders should join 
together to solve problems in Indonesia, which is plagued by political 
uncertainty and the worst economic crisis in decades. Wiranto has 
also accepted the proposal, Wahid said. ``Gen. Wiranto will represent 
the military bureaucracy, Suharto (will participate) as a leader with 
a huge loyalist following and myself as a leader with a great number 
of followers,'' Wahid said. ``We still need the consent of President 
Habibie, who will represent the civilian bureaucracy,'' said Wahid, 
who is popularly known as Gus Dur. Habibie has allowed political parties 
to form and has scheduled Parliamentary elections next year. But student 
protesters say he has not gone far enough with political reforms.
