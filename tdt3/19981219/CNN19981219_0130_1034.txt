More economists are warning the "heart" of the American economy -- 
heavy industry -- may be in a recession. Ceci Rodgers tells us why. 
Slowing sales, particularly in Asia, are hurting profits at the nation's 
biggest manufacturers, with profit warnings coming this week from 
minnesota mining and manufacturing and caterpillar. We like to use 
the word recession for the whole economy, but for the manufacturing 
sector, they're beleaguered. They've been cutting jobs and if you 
want talk about a manufacturing sector recession, I think they've 
got something like that going on. Overall, exports of U.S. goods are 
down just 1% this year. But to the pacific Rim, mired in recession, 
exports are down 14.5%. and demand is beginning to weaken in troubled 
Latin American countries. The outlook for next year is even more bleak. 
Boeing is just one manufacturer cutting jobs and production to adjust 
to cancellations of aircraft orders for 1999. Manufacturing is just 
one-fifth of the economy, but economists warn the weakness may spread. 
These people who get laid off are not going to be buying as many cars 
and furniture and other manufactured goods. And if their value of 
their stocks go down, that could curtail some of their spending. Another 
big problem for manufacturers, they can't raise prices. Demand is 
so weak, the competition for each and every sale is intensifying. 
But some economists believe the worst may almost are over, therefore 
casting a rebound in manufacturing by about the middle of next year. 
But that hinges on a turnaround in Asia and more importantly, preventing 
a Meltdown in Latin America. Ceci Rogers, "CNN Financial News," Chicago.
