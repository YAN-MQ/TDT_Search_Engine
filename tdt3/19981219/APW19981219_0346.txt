Ashok Shandilya, an Indian railroad officer from Bombay, beat world 
No. 2 and countryman Geet Sethi to claim gold in English billiards 
at the Asian Games Saturday. ``He is a gutsy chap, real champion stuff,'' 
said Sethi after he lost 5-4 to Shandilya. ``Indeed, I am disappointed, 
but I admit I played badly and the better player won.'' Shandilya, 
30, who works as a sports officer for the Bombay railroad, attributed 
his victory to conviction. ``I thought I have to get going to win. 
I told myself I must win,'' Shandilya said. In the best of 9-frame 
final, Sethi took the first frame 150-62, but Shandilya fought back 
and took two frames 152-22 and 150-9. Down 1-3, Sethi, 37 who runs 
a travel agency in the west Indian city of Ahmedabad, gained his composure 
and took the next frame 150-83. After the neck-and-neck battle reached 
4-4, Sethi committed a foul in the decisive frame, leading to his 
downfall. Shandilya took the final frame 151-23. ``He is the best 
player India has,'' Shandilya said of Sethi. ``But today for some 
reason he played badly.'' ``When we were tied 4-4, I knew that if 
I commit one mistake that will be my end. But fortunately I did not 
commit any mistake,'' Shandilya said. The bronze was claimed by host 
Thailand's Praprut Chaithanasakul, who beat the Philippines' Reynaldo 
Grandea 4-1 in the seven-frame match for third place.
