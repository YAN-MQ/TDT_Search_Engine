The participants in a February assassination attempt against Georgian 
President Eduard Shevardnadze were trained at a terrorist camp in 
Russia's breakaway region of Chechnya, the official investigation 
concluded Saturday. Gigla Agulashvili, the deputy director of the 
investigative department of the Georgian Prosecutor's office, said 
that 18 terrorists had taken part: 12 Georgian citizens and 6 citizens 
of other countries. He said they had been trained for several months 
in a region of Chechnya that was not under control of the Chechen 
government at the time. Chechen law enforcement officials aided in 
the investigation, he said. Shevardnadze was unhurt in the attack 
on Feb. 9, when gunmen showered his motorcade in the capital Tbilisi 
with grenades and automatic weapons-fire. Two of Shevardnadze's guards 
were killed. Shevardnadze blamed the attack on followers of Zviad 
Gamsakhurdia, Georgia's leader when it became independent in 1991. 
Gamsakhurdia was ousted in early 1992 and he died in mysterious circumstances 
in 1994.
