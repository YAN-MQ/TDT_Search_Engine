friday night on ice -- the sabres ran their unbeaten streak to eight 
games with a come-from-behind 4-2 win against montreal. as usual, 
hasek was stellar -- 36 saves. while curtis brown's third-period goal 
snapped a 2-2 deadlock. now, the sabres are doing all this without 
holdout forward donald audette. friday, audette was traded to los 
angeles for a second-round draft pick. the stars are unbeaten in seven 
straight, not too shabby. dallas downed detroit 3-1. lehtinen and 
hull scored third-period goals, while ed belfour came within two minutes 
of a shutout. the stars are 3-0 against the stanley cup champs this 
season.
