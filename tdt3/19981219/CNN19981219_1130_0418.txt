here is a wrap-up of the day's events. so far, the house of representatives 
will vote today on whether to impeach president clinton. during this 
morning's debate, house speaker-designate bob livingston, who admitted 
just days ago he's had several extramarital affairs announced he will 
not stand for speaker of the house next month and will resign from 
congress. lawmakers will vote on four articles of impeachment, charging 
president clinton with obstruction of justice, abuse of power, and 
two counts of perjury. democrats are calling for censure and plan 
to walk out of the chamber in protest if denied that option. republicans 
are arguing impeachment is warranted.
