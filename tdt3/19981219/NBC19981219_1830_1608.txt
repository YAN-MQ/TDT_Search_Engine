updating the two major stories tonight, the president announcing the 
end of the bombing campaign in iraq, and his being impeached by the 
house of representatives. new numbers out tonight indicates it does 
not reflect the public's mood. when asked how they felt about the 
president's job approval rating -- nbc news correspondent rick davis 
reports on how americans reacted. people came to the white house today 
to see this nation's history on a day history was made. some came 
with a message. can the creep swear in the veep? but many who came 
to tour the white house like william roth of miami felt sympathy not 
anger. i wish chelsea and hillary and mr. clinton the best of times. 
900 miles away in little rock, arkansas, in health clubs, in homes 
and dark bars, the people of the president's home state heard the 
call that the president resign. the question divided some families. 
i do think he should. why? because he's humiliated arkansas and the 
country. stay in there and fight. if i was caught in the same situation 
at my job, i would be fired. no. i don't want the president to resign. 
but what will be the legacy of the man cast in stone in little rock? 
the mayor. it leaves a mark that we all would agree is a mark that 
we would rather not have there. and he would rather is not there. 
on the other hand, he has done great things for this country and this 
world. a clinton biographer. the president is not thinking about legacy, 
he's thinking about survival. as his wife used to tell him, life is 
not a dress rehersal. his legacy will be that he is the second president 
impeached by the house. and now the people of little rock and the 
nation wait to learn if the legacy of william jefferson clinton will 
include being removed from office by a vote of the senate. rick davis, 
nbc news.
