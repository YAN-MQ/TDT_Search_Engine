Kazakstan's Olga Shishigina, who returned this season from a two-year 
drug ban, set an Asian Games record of 12.63 seconds in the women's 
100-meter hurdles Saturday. Qatar's Mohammed Taib took his fifth Asian 
Games gold medal by capturing the 5,000 meters _ his first 5,000 since 
1990 _ after taking his third straight 1,500 earlier in the week. 
China, which had been battling Japan for supremacy in the athletic 
events, took over the overall lead in golds by winning three of eight 
events Saturday. It had 15 golds to 12 for Japan, which won the men's 
4 x 400 relay. Shishigina had tested positive in a meet in early 1996 
for stanozolol, the same steroid that turned up in Canadian sprinter 
Ben Johnson's drug test at the 1988 Olympics. She was banned for four 
years, but the IAAF, the sport's governing body, cut that to two in 
May 1996. She had been considered one of the favorites for the 1996 
Olympic gold medal after a time of 12.44 seconds _ still the Asian 
record _ in 1995 and a second place behind American Gail Devers at 
the 1995 worlds. On Saturday, Shishigina, who returned to competition 
at the Asian track championships in July, ran 12.63 into the wind, 
one of the top times of 1998. That beat the games record of 12.73 
set by China's Liu Huajin of China in 1990. China's Liu Jing was second 
in 12.82. In the men's 110 hurdles, China's Chen Yanhao won easily 
in 13.65 seconds, far off the 13.30 games mark set by another Chinese, 
Li Tong, in 1994. Chen took control of the race by the fourth hurdle 
and gradually moved out to a two-meter victory over Kazakstan's Andrei 
Sklyarenko, 13.86. Third was Qatar's Hamad al-Dosari, 13.99, the only 
other runner under 14.00. In Taib's race, the pace quickened with 
two laps to go. South Korea's Baek Seung-do took the lead, and Taib 
and Qatar's Ahmed Hashim followed. In the final lap, Taib moved easily 
in front with 200 meters to go and established a large lead before 
slowing at the finish to win in 13 minutes, 55.79 seconds. Hashim 
took the silver in 13:56.65, with Baek third in 13:57.11 As he did 
in the 1,500, Taib slowed dramatically after his victory was assured, 
allowing the other medalists to close the gap somewhat. Taib said 
it was his first 5,000 since 1990, when he won the Asian Games event. 
``It's preparation for Sydney. I want to run the 5,000 there. I am 
getting older,'' said Taib, who will be 31 in 2000. China added gold 
medals in two women's events. Cai Weiyan and Sun Caiyun, both former 
record holders in the pole vault, were first and third, with Japan's 
Masumi Ono second, all clearing 4.00 meters. China also held off India 
in the women's 4 x 400 relay. China's Chen Yuxiang saw a large lead 
in the final 100 meters almost disintegrate when India's 800 and 1,500 
winner, Jyortirmoy Sikdhar, made a late charge that fell short by 
about a meter, 3:32.03 to 3:32.20. The men's relay went to Japan in 
an Asian Games record, 3:01.70, breaking a 12-year-old mark of 3:02.33. 
Uzbekistan's Sergi Voinov won the men's javelin with a toss of 79.70, 
putting Asian Games record holder Zhang Lianbiao of China into second 
with 78.58. Zhang did more than 83 meters in 1994. Sergei Arzamassov 
of Kazakstan beat another Chinese for the gold in the triple jump 
by two centimeters, 17.00 to 16.98. After Saturday's eight finals, 
and with only the men's marathon left, China, with 15 golds, will 
not get close to its total from the previous games. In 1994, China 
had 22 medals in the sport, paced by its women, who took 14 of 19 
events. But this time China's women have faltered, losing all the 
middle distance races that they dominated between 1993 and 1994, when 
members of coach Ma Junren's training group set world records in the 
1,500, 3,000 and 10,000. At these games, aside from Shishigina's hurdles 
time, the only other world-class mark for the women was in the marathon, 
where Japan's Naoko Takashashi set the fifth best time ever in the 
event, just one minute off the world's best. The men had Koji Ito 
of Japan, the 100-meter gold medalist, running an Asian record of 
10.00 seconds in the semifinals, just missing the sub-10 barrier.
