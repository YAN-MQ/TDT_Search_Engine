"CNN Headline News," I'm Chuck Roberts. After a morning of high emotion 
and a major change in the congressional political landscape, the House 
of Representatives is poised to vote on articles of impeachment of 
President Clinton. The last round of debate has focused on a democratic 
proposal to substitute a motion to censure President Clinton instead 
of impeachment. It was introduced by minority leader Dick Gephardt, 
who said bipartisan support would provide an opportunity to begin 
what he called the process of "Healing our nation and healing our 
people." We need to start binding up our wounds. We need to end this 
downward spiral which will culminate in the death of representative 
democracy. I believe this healing can start today by changing the 
course we've begun. This is exactly why we need this today to be bipartisan. 
This is why we ask the opportunity to vote on a bipartisan censure 
resolution to begin the process of healing our nation and healing 
our people. Republican house Judiciary committee member Charles Canady 
responded the house has no option but to consider impeachment. We 
do not sit in judgment on the president for his frailties, or his 
human failings. That is not our responsibility. But today in this 
house we do sit in judgment on the president of the United States 
for his crimes. And it is because of his crimes that this motion must 
be rejected. It must be rejected first, because the proposal for censure 
is outside the framework established by our constitution. As the chairman 
of the Judiciary committee so eloquently explained, the constitution 
establishes a single method for this Congress to sit in judgment on 
the misconduct of a president. The constitutional method is impeachment 
by the house and trial in the senate. That is going to prevail. There's 
only a couple minutes -- less than main knit voting on a motion to 
table the appeal from the ruling of the chair. The chair, in fact, 
overruled the motion to recommit the impeachment inquiry in favor 
of a censure vote and the republicans will prevail. Had prevailed 
in defeating that bid. So the bottom line is the impeachment will 
be voted on shortly. Yea or nay. And the democrats have been thwarted 
in their atestimony to have their motion changed to censure.
