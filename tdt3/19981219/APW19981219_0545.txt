Iraqi President Saddam Hussein has put Iraq's southern provinces on 
maximum alert and deployed thousands of elite troops to head off a 
possible revolt by Shiite Muslims, dissidents and travelers said Saturday. 
The Iraqi leader also has armed tens of thousands of members of the 
ruling Baath Party to guard government offices in Baghdad and other 
towns in fear a rebellion could be set off by U.S. and British airstrikes 
aimed at the country, they said. The dissidents and travelers, who 
spoke from Jordan and Syria on condition of anonymity, said elite 
Republican Guard divisions were sent to the provinces of Basra, Nasirriya 
and Imara, where they maintained Shiite rebels already were staging 
an insurgency. Some troops, their tanks and artillery have been stationed 
in date palm groves along the 500-kilometer (335-mile) highway from 
Basra to Baghdad, they said. There was no way to immediately confirm 
the reports. Baghdad has made no mention of the troop deployment, 
but Iraqi officials have voiced concern the American and British attacks 
may be aimed at destabilizing Saddam's regime and paving the way for 
a rebellion. Southern Iraq was the site of fierce fighting in the 
aftermath of the 1991 Gulf War when the Iraqi military crushed an 
uprising by Shiite Muslim rebels. Iraqi opposition groups in London 
have said fighting has flared again there in recent months. Hamdi 
al-Bayati, a spokesman in London for the Supreme Council of the Islamic 
Revolution in Iraq, said some of the guard units in the area have 
been engaged in fighting with Shiite rebels in Imara since Thursday. 
He said fighting was still raging in and around the marsh areas of 
al-Iz and Umm al-Naaj in the province. The reported security steps 
follow U.S. and British airstrikes which began Thursday to punish 
Iraq for its obstruction of U.N. inspectors searching for evidence 
of weapons of mass destruction. U.S. President Bill Clinton said he 
ordered the series of airstrikes to destroy Iraqi ``military and security'' 
targets. On Friday, Saddam said he would not ``compromise or kneel'' 
in the showdown with U.S. and British military forces. Addressing 
the nation on television for the first time since the airstrikes began, 
Saddam told Iraqis: ``Continue your resistance and, by God's will, 
you will be victorious.'' But the travelers and dissidents said the 
Iraqi authorities have shown considerable nervousness since the bombardment 
started and have imposed strict security measures. Among measures 
they've taken are stopping and turning back many travelers heading 
from Baghdad to the southern provinces on the main highway, they said. 
The travelers are stopped at military checkpoints, a permanent feature 
along the road.
