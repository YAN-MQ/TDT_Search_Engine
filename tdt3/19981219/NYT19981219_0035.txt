When the Islanders embarked on a four-game West Coast trip after losing 
seven straight games, their playoff outlook was bleak and their collective 
attitude was bleaker. But that was before Zigmund Palffy, the Islanders' 
best player, agreed to a long-term contract. Before the textbook victory 
over the San Jose Sharks. And before the inspiring overtime victory 
over the Los Angeles Kings on Thursday. With Palffy on his way back 
from Slovakia, the buzz that permeated the Islanders' locker room 
early this season has also returned, and with it the hope of making 
the playoffs. ``He's a great player,'' Trevor Linden, the Islanders' 
captain, said of Palffy. ``It's great for the team to have him back. 
Apart from his goal-scoring ability, his play-making ability adds 
another dimension. It's amazing what one player does for the whole 
team's outlook.'' Palffy, who agreed in principle to a five-year contract 
averaging $5.5 million on Thursday, signed it Friday morning, according 
to Petr Svoboda, who is an associate of Palffy's agent, Paul Kraus. 
Palffy, who is a three-time 40-goal scorer, is expected to leave his 
native Slovakia Friday and arrive on Long Island late Saturday. He 
will make his season debut Tuesday against the St. Louis Blues at 
Nassau Coliseum. ``I absolutely feel we can still make the playoffs 
at this stage,'' said Steven Gluckstern, the Islanders' co-owner, 
who attended Thursday's game against the Kings. ``We're going to have 
to play better than .500 and this team is capable of that. And with 
Ziggy, this team is more than capable of that. The Islanders were 
visibly energized by the news of Palffy's signing, which came just 
hours before they beat the Kings in a wild shootout, 5-4, on an overtime 
goal by Bryan Berard at the Great Western Forum. ``I think they showed 
that early,'' said Mike Milbury, the Islanders' coach and general 
manager, referring to the effect the news of Palffy's signing had 
on the team. ``I don't know how to factor that in, but I'm sure it 
had something to do with it.'' On Thursday, the Islanders strayed 
from the tight defensive game plan that earned them a 1-0 victory 
against the Sharks. But this time, they got a break, that crucial 
late-in-the game bounce, the one that so often has gone the other 
way this season. Berard's giveaway led to a momentum-killing goal 
by the Kings earlier in the game. But two minutes into overtime, Berard 
picked up a rebound off the post and beat a sprawled Jamie Storr under 
the crossbar. The original shot was taken by Mariusz Czerkawski, who 
set up a nifty pass from Robert Reichel. Saturday's midnight holiday 
trade moratorium deadline is expected to pass without Milbury pulling 
the trigger on a deal. SLAP SHOTS KENNY JONSSON, the Islanders' top 
defenseman, may have sustained his second concussion in a month during 
Friday night's game against the Mighty Ducks when TRAVIS GREEN clipped 
Jonsson's head with an elbow in the first period. Green, a former 
Islander who was traded to Anaheim late last season, was confronted 
by the Islanders' captain, TREVOR LINDEN, as Jonsson lay motionless 
on the ice. After the period, Green said, ``I was just trying to finish 
my check on the play.'' Any injury to Jonsson would be crucial. Of 
the eight games Jonsson missed with his first concussion, the Islanders 
lost seven.
