About a dozen Chinese fishing vessels have been spotted this week 
near three of eight islands controlled by the Philippines in the disputed 
Spratlys chain, the military said Saturday. The Western Command based 
in Palawan, the Philippine province closest to the islands, said in 
a report to Chief of Staff Gen. Joselin Nazareno that the fishing 
vessels dropped anchor Friday several kilometers (miles) off Kota, 
Parola and Panata islands. At least nine of the vessels were still 
in the area, about 800 kilometers (500 miles) southwest of Manila, 
as of Saturday, the report said. There was no immediate word on whether 
the Philippine government will lodge another protest against China 
as it did in October after the military discovered new Chinese structures 
being built on Mischief Reef, which is claimed by both Manila and 
Beijing. China said the structures are shelters for Chinese fishermen. 
Later, Beijing offered joint use of the platforms, and this was accepted 
``in principle'' by the Philippine government. Chinese and Philippine 
officials last month agreed to hold talks in Manila in January to 
work on ``confidence building measures'' to ease the tension over 
the Spratlys. On Friday, Nazareno said the military plans to improve 
the runway on Pag-asa, the largest of the eight islands occupied by 
Philippine troops, to accommodate more aircraft. China, Taiwan and 
Vietnam claim all of the Spratlys. The Philippines and Malaysia claim 
only some of the islands and reefs and Brunei claims one reef. The 
Spratlys straddle vital sea lanes in the South China Sea and are believed 
to be rich in minerals. Meanwhile, the military reported that two 
of 25 fishermen on a fishing boat that sank during a recent storm 
in the Spratlys have been rescued. The 23 other fishermen aboard the 
fishing boat Nastra were believed to have drowned. Ramos Boklat and 
Joel Atsas Ecol told rescuers that they abandoned their boat after 
the others refused to leave it despite being battered by big waves 
during tropical storm Faith last week. The two men were seen at the 
Jackson Atoll by air force reconnaissance planes last Saturday.
