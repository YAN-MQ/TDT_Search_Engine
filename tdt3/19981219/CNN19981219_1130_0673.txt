recapping our top story for you, there's been even more drama than 
expected in what was already a historic day on capitol hill. speaker 
elect bob livingston announced he will not take on the leadership 
role next session and will resign from the house within six months. 
the move comes just days after he publicly admitted to having extra-marital 
affairs. livingston said he hopes president clinton will follow his 
example and resign for the good of the country, but through his press 
secretary today, president clinton called for an end to the politics 
of personal destruction, those are his woyrdz, and asked livingston 
to reconsider his decision.
