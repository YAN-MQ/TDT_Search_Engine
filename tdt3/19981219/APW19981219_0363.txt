A Congolese rebel leader on Saturday cast new doubts on the chances 
for a cease-fire in the Congo, saying peace is impossible unless President 
Laurent Kabila is removed from power. Bizima Karaha, the declared 
Foreign Minister in the rebel hierarchy, said that Kabila's removal 
from power was just a matter of time. ``Today the question is not 
to know if Kabila will go or not. It is a matter of knowing how and 
when he will go,'' Karaha said. ``And after Kabila, then what?'' Karaha 
said the rebels believed a cease-fire was ``easy'' to achieve, but 
that Kabila was holding up the process by refusing to meet with the 
renegades, who launched an uprising to topple Kabila in August. Since 
then at least five other countries have been drawn in, including Angola, 
Zimbabwe and Namibia in support of Kabila and Rwanda and Uganda on 
the rebel side. ``We are demanding direct talks before a cease-fire 
can be signed,'' Karaha said. He was speaking with journalists shortly 
before departing Burkina Faso's capital following an Organization 
of African Unity that sought to negotiate an end Congo's war, which 
has drawn in at least five other African countries. On Friday, Burkina 
Faso's president Blaise Compaore said the warring parties in the Congo 
agreed to meet Dec. 27 and 28 in the Zambian capital, Lusaka to sign 
a cease-fire treaty. Representatives of the five countries embroiled 
in the war worked on a ``pre-agreement'' during a summit meeting of 
the Organization of African Unity, Compaore said. Karaha claimed that 
Kabila's troops were no longer willing to fight for him and the government's 
main allies Zimbabwe and Angola were also losing commitment to the 
war because of domestic problems. ``Kabila is losing the war because 
Angola is in trouble with a civil war in their own country and Zimbabwe 
has lost a lot of people and planes so far. It has become very unpopular 
in Zimbabwe,'' he said. The rebels have captured the eastern half 
of Congo, an area with upwards of 20 million people, Karaha said. 
Those claims are difficult to independently verify because the territory 
is vast and remote. Congo's government has made equally bold claims 
of battlefield successes, saying it has dislodged the rebels from 
some of its strongholds with air attacks. Although repeated peace 
initiatives for Congo have failed, Compaore expressed confidence that 
the latest efforts would succeed. ``The representatives who were here 
agreed unanimously to work on the cease-fire agreement,'' he said. 
Along with Kabila and the rebels, delegates from Angola, Zimbabwe, 
Uganda, Rwanda were in Burkina Faso. OAU member heads of state endorsed 
a recommendation that foreign observers be prepared to monitor the 
anticipated treaty.
