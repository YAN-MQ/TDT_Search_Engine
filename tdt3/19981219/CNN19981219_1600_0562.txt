Back with you now at CNN center "Headline News." We are awaiting President 
Clinton's address. As you see outside of the White House, democratic 
leaders have emerged after meeting with President Clinton after today's 
vote in the house where they approved two articles of impeachment 
against President Clinton. Only the second time in this nation's history 
that that has happened. A standing president being impeached. It will 
move to a Senate trial next month. This appears to be all the democrats 
involved in the vote today. They had been meeting for the last few 
hours with the president and the first lady. We saw vice President 
Al Gore and Dick Gephardt emerge from the White House as well. They 
stepped back into the oval office. We will hear from some members 
of the house first. We expect to hear from Dick Gephardt at some point, 
and then from the president himself.
