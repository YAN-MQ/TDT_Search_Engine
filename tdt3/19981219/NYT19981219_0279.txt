Judith Arron, the executive and artistic director of Carnegie Hall 
since 1986, died on Friday at the University of Colorado Health Sciences 
Center in Denver. She was 56 and lived in Chappaqua. The cause was 
breast cancer, Carnegie Hall officials said Saturday. Ms. Arron presided 
over probably the most momentous years of Carnegie Hall since its 
rescue from the wrecking ball in 1960. The exhaustive $60 million 
renovation of the hall in 1986 happened on her watch, as well as the 
season-long and highly festive centennial celebration of 1990-91. 
Ms. Arron used the refurbishment of Carnegie Hall's smaller Weill 
Recital Hall as an opportunity to transform it from a rental space 
to an important venue for events produced by the Hall. They included 
debut series, chamber-music events, jazz concerts and a new music 
series administered by the Carnegie Hall Composer's Chair, which is 
currently held by Ellen Taaffe Zwilich. Under Ms. Arron, the Hall 
promoted and extended educational programs both for the very young 
and for professionals, with workshops overseen by musicians like Robert 
Shaw and Pierre Boulez. In partnership with the Hall's president, 
the violinist Isaac Stern, and its chairman, Sanford Weill, Ms. Arron 
began a new endowment campaign in 1995 and had raised $87 million 
to date. Ms. Arron came to Carnegie Hall from Cincinnati, where she 
was the Cincinnati Symphony's manager and the director of its May 
Festival. Her work in developing educational outreach programs there 
in 1969 was admired in orchestra circles around the country. Before 
that, Ms. Arron had worked for the American Symphony Orchestra League 
and a government arts program. Ms. Arron was born in Seattle and graduated 
from the University of Puget Sound with a performance degree in cello 
and piano. Her husband, Ronald Arron, is a violinist with the Metropolitan 
Opera Orchestra. Stern said Saturday that Ms. Arron's health in the 
last two weeks had been ``touch and go'' but that her eight-and-a-half-year 
battle with cancer had been ``a miracle'' and a victory of ``will 
and heart over doctors and medicine.'' Weill cited her ``extraordinary 
abilities as an administrator and her keen understanding of the financial 
world.'' At her death, Ms. Arron was preparing to bring yet another 
performing space to Carnegie Hall, a below-ground area long occupied 
by the Carnegie Hall Cinema to be equipped with high-tech appurtenances 
and intended for smaller opera productions and experimental work. 
Ms. Arron is survived, in addition to her husband, by two sons, Joseph 
and Edward of New York; her parents, Richard and Berenice Hagerty 
of La Quinta, Calif.; a sister, Colleen Fretz of Belize, and two brothers, 
Richard Hagerty Jr. of Modesto, Calif., and Dale Hagerty of La Quinta.
