CNN has learned that President Clinton will address the nation after 
the house votes on impeachment. He'll be joined by house democratic 
leaders in the rose garden at the White House. Mr. Clinton also has 
videotaped a different kind of address to be broadcast today in the 
Arab world, defending "operation desert fox." He explains his decision 
to bomb Iraq, and said he hopes that Arabs realize the attack is in 
their best interest. Saddam promised to cooperate unconditionally 
with the inspectors, but this month he broke his promises again. And 
again defied the U.N., so we had to act. Saddam simply must not be 
allowed to threaten his neighbors and the world with nuclear arms, 
poising gas or biological weapons.
