Perhaps this weekend you ought to rummage through the attic. Dust 
off the rusty old metal tackle box. Poke through the pockets of that 
mouse-chewed fly-fishing vest. And don't overlook that yellowed stack 
of papers, catalogs and magazines. You may not find some musty old 
Bell Telephone stock certificates, but the right Creek Chub catalog 
may be worth a lot more than its weight in gold. An old Wheatley fly 
box may be worth more than the dozens of salmon flies that it still 
holds. A slightly tarnished antique reel may be worth enough to buy 
a hundred shares of the latest high-flying Internet stock. And if 
you happen to find a Haskell Minnow plug, take it directly to your 
safe deposit box. Collecting, selling and investing in antique fishing 
tackle is booming, as was evident last month in Boxborough, Mass., 
at North America's foremost auction of fishing tackle and accessories. 
Nearly a thousand items were on the daylong agenda, some 300 people 
were in attendance and almost 200 others bid by telephone or had submitted 
absentee bids. In the evaluation period before the auction, attendees 
pored over the items, which included about 250 lures and groups of 
lures, nearly 200 reels and more than a hundred rods, plus prints, 
creels, books, nets, catalogs, signs and all types of antique fishing-related 
esoterica. The mood was library-like, with people speaking in hushed 
tones while studiously examining merchandise, some using measuring 
tapes to verify the dimensions of reels and the lengths of rods. Pat 
Salimeno, a collector from Wurtsboro, N.Y., asked to see a small reel. 
A brass winch multiplier reel of the mid-1800s, and one of perhaps 
only five known from the British maker Ustonson, it was engraved with 
the words, ``Makers to His Majesty Temple Bar Ld'n'' and was estimated 
to be worth $5,000 to $7,500. Salimeno inspected the 1 3/4-inch-diameter 
reel, which the auction catalog called ``historically important,'' 
but he was just looking. ``Reels are getting to be fantastically expensive,'' 
he said. ``They especially draw people who want investments.'' That 
view was confirmed by Bob Lang of Raymond, Maine, who is one of the 
foremost authorities on sporting collectibles and was the sponsor 
of the auction, one of two he conducts annually. ``Last year, prices 
skyrocketed,'' he said. ``We set a new record in the spring of '97 
when a reel similar to the Ustonson one, but made around 1820 by the 
famed Kentucky maker George Snyder, sold for $31,350. ``None of the 
reels today will fetch similar money, but there's a lot of good ones, 
and they've brought some of my best phone bidders here to see the 
reels and to bid in person. Even still, I have people from 12 countries 
who will be phone bidding on reels, and, for the first time ever, 
two bidders from Japan.'' Those interested in antique tackle are private 
collectors, dealers of new and used sporting equipment or antiques, 
and pure investors. The good stuff, Lang said, usually goes to collectors, 
who will pay more. ``A lot of buyers now were not around 10 or 15 
years ago and don't have a sense of what it used to be like,'' he 
said. ``Older collectors know a $100 lure and can't bring themselves 
to pay $200 for it, but a new guy has no hesitance.'' Indeed, the 
audience reflected a lot of collectors in their 30s and 40s. ``It's 
like the stock market,'' Lang said. Salimeno, who may have one of 
the best antique lure collections in the United States, concurred. 
``A lot of people overbid because they don't know the real value of 
an item,'' he said. ``They want it and they've got the bucks.'' Yet 
he was still lamenting having passed up a Haskell Minnow at auction 
when the top bid was $7,000. It went back on auction and fetched $12,000. 
Then it reappeared at auction and sold for $22,000, the current record 
for an antique lure. Those numbers were not reached in Boxborough, 
only because, as Salimeno put it, the merchandise was good but in 
general of interest to the midlevel collector. Nevertheless, when 
the Ustonson reel went off early in the afternoon, the bidding was 
brisk. In addition to people bidding in person, there were seven telephone 
bidders; one of them landed the reel for $9,500. Later, an antique 
leather-trimmed rattan creel by Turtle fetched $2,000, also from a 
phone bidder. An elegant Hardy Brothers walnut chest with about 175 
salmon flies sold for $2,700 in spirited bidding between an attendee 
and a phone bidder, with the former prevailing. At least 10 bamboo 
rods, by such famous makers as Thomas &AMP; Thomas, Payne, Garrison 
and Gillum, sold for $2,000 to $3,500, Salimeno reserved his interest 
for a rare ink blotter making its first appearance at an auction. 
Issued by Orvis of Vermont in what is believed to be about 1880, it 
was an unusual item that advertised merchandise and contained an illustration 
of a leaping trout in one corner. It was never used to blot ink, and 
Lang estimated its value at $300. Bidding started low among several 
interested parties, but at $150 only Salimeno and a phone bidder were 
left. Salimeno was willing to pay $400 to $450. The rapid-talking 
auctioneer pointed to the representative of the phone bidder and then 
to Salimeno. Each raised the bid again and again, and within seconds 
it topped $400. Salimeno dropped out at $550 to what he later learned 
was a determined collector from Connecticut _ the same person who 
earlier bought the Ustonson reel and who an observer later calculated 
had spent $40,000 on the day. Disappointed, Salimeno bid on an extremely 
rare $5 note from Derby Fishing Co. dated 1808. Its value was estimated 
at $125; he obtained it for $25. The profit of the day fell to one 
of Lang's helpers, a woman who last summer bought a rare 12-page 1942 
Creek Chub catalog at a yard sale for 25 cents. It was auctioned for 
$225.
