In the first 209 years in the history, the U.S. House of Representatives 
have voted on articles of impeachment on one president. Today they 
will vote on impeaching a second president. Democratic members will 
attempt to derail impeachment. They will move to send the four articles 
back to the Judiciary committee and when the effort fails, many democrats 
are expected to Bach walk out in protest.
