Many in the international community are criticizing the strikes against 
iraq, including Russia. Andrea Koppel reports on what could be a break 
in an already fragile relationship. Despite obvious signs of a rift 
in U.S./Russian relations, the United States' top diplomat downplayed 
differences. We obviously disagree about the use of force in Iraq. 
But we have a very important relationship with the Russians, and we 
will continue to manage that relationship. To that end, U.S. officials 
say secretary Albright spoke with russian foreign minister Igor ivanov 
Friday morning, following up on messages exchanged between President 
Clinton and Russian President Yeltsin. Aides say President Clinton 
tried to explain why the U.S. launched air strikes against Iraq. He 
argued that we shouldn't let a disagreement in this area sidetrack 
progress we're making in other areas. Publicly, Russian officials 
across the political spectrum have expressed their outrage over ongoing 
military strikes in Iraq. From the Russian parliament to the Kremlin, 
a chorus of anti-American rhetoric has many U.S. officials and other 
experts concerned. I don't know if it's a turning point in U.S./Russian 
relations, but it's a Critical moment. Thus far, Russia has recalled 
its ambassadors from Washington and london, mostly a symbolic gesture 
intended to send a strong message of disapproval. Still, many worry 
about long-term consequences should relations between these two powers 
continue to deteriorate. We have two elections coming up. The Duma 
is going to be elected again next year. That could emerge with a passionate, 
even larger anti-western majority. They have one now. And there will 
be another president elected in the year 2000. If that president turns 
out to be hostile to the United States and the west, we're in for 
further troubles there. It's a potential dangerous chain reaction 
of events many experts say must be resolved now. Otherwise, they say 
U.S./Russian relations, which are today only fraying at the seams, 
could rip apart. Andrea Koppel, CNN, the state department.
