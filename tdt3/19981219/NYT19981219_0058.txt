They were going to call it Desert Viper, but the second word had to 
begin with an F. Desert Fiper? Generals do not like to sound foolish. 
Well, what about Desert Ferret or Desert Flamingo? OK, maybe those 
handles lack that certain something. But Desert Fox? That was the 
nickname of Erwin Rommel, the fabled North African field marshal of 
Hitler's army. The Pentagon wanted to name the campaign against Iraq 
desert-something-or-other to be consistent with names for other operations 
in the Persian Gulf, like Desert Storm in 1991. Desert Viper may have 
a ferocious ring, but under Pentagon protocol, the military command 
planning the operation _ in this case, the one based at McGill Air 
Force Base near Tampa, Fla. _ was supposed to choose a name beginning 
with D or F. Enter a computer data base, known at the Pentagon, the 
world capital of acronyms, as the Nicaa. (Don't even ask what that 
stands for.) It decided that the second word should begin with an 
F. ``Fiper'' is not in the dictionary, of course, and ``Desert Fiper'' 
doesn't have the right ring. So high-level types at McGill settled 
on fox. Eventually, Defense Secretary William Cohen approved the name 
Desert Fox. Did anybody think of Rommel, who was portrayed by James 
Mason in not one but two Hollywood films? ``Nobody,'' said Lt. Col. 
David Thurston, a spokesman for the Joint Chiefs of Staff. ``That 
was not in the mix. I know that it's been speculated on by various 
members of the media and others, but that did not enter into it.'' 
Marc Schneier, president of the New York Board of Rabbis, accepted 
that explanation. ``I am sure the powers that be did not associate 
the name with the Nazi general,'' he said. ``And as it happens, the 
choice could be something positive, because in the aftermath of this 
campaign, the term Desert Fox will no longer be associated with a 
Nazi officer, but instead will be associated with a determined effort 
to stop a mad dictator from acquiring weapons of mass destruction.''
