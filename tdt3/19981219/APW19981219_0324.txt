Reigning world champion Janne Ahonen of Finland clinched his second 
World Cup victory of the season Saturday, soaring a record 132-meters 
in the second round of a ski jumping event on the K120 hill at Harrachov. 
Ahonen, who was seventh after the first round, leaping an average 
109 meters, beat Rony Hornschuh of Germany, who also improved notably 
in the second round, by 13 points. Japan's Kazuoshi Funaki finished 
third, with jumps of 107.5 and 123.5 meters. Olav Magne Doenne of 
Norway, who was in comfortable lead after round one with a stylish 
122-meter leap, slipped to fourth place after a weak second-round 
effort in an increasingly dense fog and pouring rain, while his teammate 
Morten Aagheim took fifth. Saturday's event was rescheduled from Liberec 
to Harrachov due to a rapid thaw. The overall World Cup leader Martin 
Schmitt of Germany, who won the initial three events of the season, 
didn't take part in the competition, prefering to practice at home 
instead.
