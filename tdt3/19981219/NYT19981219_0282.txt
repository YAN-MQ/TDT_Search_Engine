Christmas was still a week away, but the spirit of Christmas Eve prevailed 
at the Fifth Avenue Presbyterian Church. For the last four years, 
the majestic church at Fifth Avenue and 55th Street has conducted 
what it terms the ``Travelers' Christmas Eve,'' a service intended 
for parishioners who are leaving town for the holidays. Visitors are 
welcome too. From the beginning, in 1995, the early Christmas Eve 
was a hit, and this week it drew 625 people. The service Thursday 
night was identical in every way to the one that will be conducted 
twice on Christmas Eve itself, complete with prayer, sermon, choir, 
brass and string instruments, audience caroling and a candlelight 
conclusion. ``It has become a tradition, and the key point is not 
to make people feel it is a lesser service or miniservice,'' the Rev. 
Thomas Tewell, senior pastor of the congregation, said. ``It makes 
people who travel feel that this is the way the church cares for them.'' 
Other churches in the city will be having services for travelers Sunday, 
among them Marble Collegiate Church, Riverside Church, and the Unitarian 
Church of All Souls, where, in addition to Christmas services Sunday 
morning, there will be what the Rev. F. Forrester Church described 
as a ``New York City-Sioux Falls Christmas pageant, the same pageant 
you grew up with in Sioux Falls with children dressed as wise men, 
shepherds and sheep.'' The Rev. Arthur Caliandro of Marble Collegiate 
Church, where Sunday's service will include the Christmas story, carols 
and music from Handel's ``Messiah,'' said: ``When people go away to 
Ohio, Nebraska, wherever, they still want to have Christmas in their 
New York church. If we don't have a full-blown Christmas experience 
for them here, they leave wanting.'' Then there is Judson Memorial 
Church, an interdenominational Christian church in the heart of Greenwich 
Village, where for years there has been no service on either Christmas 
Eve or Christmas Day. ``A lot of our people travel and the idea that 
Jesus was born in late December was a European invention and is arbitrary,'' 
the Rev. Peter Laarman, the senior minister, said. ``We made a considered 
decision this year that because Christmas is Friday, it would be OK 
to have the main celebration on Dec. 20.'' Tampering with the traditional 
service schedule for either Christmas Eve or Christmas Day is unthinkable 
among Roman Catholics, Episcopalians or members of other orthodox 
denominations. ``I am not critical of what others do, but it wouldn't 
be liturgically proper,'' said Joseph Zwilling, spokesman for the 
Archdiocese of New York. ``This is the last Sunday of Advent, and 
the Christmas Eve service anticipates the Christmas Mass.'' It is 
the lack of a precise date for the birth of Jesus that gives the more 
liberal denominations justification for celebrating early. ``This 
is clearly a dilemma that certain congregations, especially ones with 
affluent people who travel a great deal, face,'' said Peter Awn, professor 
of religion at Columbia University. ``Do you allow the community to 
diminish in order to keep to an artificial date? What services like 
this say is that if you care about community building, you must make 
what appear to be untraditional compromises.'' Clearly community was 
important at Fifth Avenue Presbyterian Church, where greeters were 
on hand at every doorway wishing people merry Christmas, and where 
worshippers hugged and kissed one another. Meredith Marsh, who will 
spend the holiday in Brandon, Miss., brought a group of friends also 
about to disperse across the country: Don Latham to New Orleans, Elizabeth 
Brooks to Houston, Heather Murrell to Gruver, Texas, and Alicia Kelly 
to Norfolk, Va. ``I think this is wonderful,'' Ms. Marsh said. ``I 
wouldn't miss it.'' Christie Manning, who will be in Minneapolis on 
Christmas, stood at the back of the sanctuary holding her daughter, 
Alex, who will be 1 on Dec. 30. Ms. Manning is due to have her second 
child next month. ``Whoever would have thought you would find something 
so welcoming in the middle of Manhattan,'' she said.
