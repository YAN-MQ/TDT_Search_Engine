This is Orelon Sidney with your "CNN Headline News" weather update. 
A low-pressure system will move across portions of the eastern U.S. 
today, with a cold front trailing into the gulf of Mexico. Showers 
and maybe a few thunderstorms are possible as this system heads eastward. 
Look for a retrograde of the storm system heading into Sunday, that 
means warmer temperature force the plains states. An area of low pressure 
remains across the four corners region, and snow showers stay in the 
forecast for most of the weekend. Bitterly cold high temperatures 
are expected for the northern plains into the northern Rockies with 
temperatures below zero today. You'll see 20s, 30s, 40s and 50s across 
most of the rest of the United States, with the southern tier on the 
warm side in the 60s and the 70s. The extended forecast includes bitterly 
cold temperatures for Monday in the northwest with snow possible in 
the region. A heavy mix is possible in the Great Lakes with showers 
and scattered thunderstorms continuing into the gulf south. Snow shower 
taper off on Tuesday in the northwest and continue scattered across 
the Great Lakes into Wednesday. The extended forecast for more than 
7,000 cities is at CNN.com.
