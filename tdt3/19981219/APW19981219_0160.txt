Defying a ban on pro-Iraq demonstrations, about 3,000 Palestinians 
screaming ``Death to Israel _ death to America!'' marched Saturday 
in the West Bank town of Hebron. Clashes with Israeli troops afterward 
injured seven protesters. Another demonstration took place in the 
southern Gaza Strip town of Rafah, where about 400 Palestinian protesters 
burned U.S. and British flags. Police dispersed them, but without 
using force. In the West Bank, Palestinian police did not attempt 
to restrain the marchers as they set out from Hebron University, some 
wearing black hoods or masked with keffiyehs, carrying posters of 
Iraqi president Saddam Hussein. When the marchers reached the center 
of town, where several Jewish settler enclaves are located, about 
400 protesters broke away from the main rally and hurled stones at 
Israeli troops. The soldiers responded with rubber bullets and tear 
gas. All of the injuries to protesters were from rubber-coated bullets. 
The Hebron rally drew Palestinian political groups from across the 
political spectrum, ranging from the radical Islamic group Hamas to 
Yasser Arafat's Fatah faction. The Fatah participation came despite 
a declaration by Arafat's police chief in Gaza that such demonstrations 
were banned. Palestinian authorities also shut down media broadcasting 
pro-Iraqi sentiments and detained journalists _ including some working 
for foreign media outlets _ who covered pro-Iraqi unrest. On Saturday, 
the Palestinian journalists' syndicate called a strike to protest 
the curbs. The Iraq crisis poses a dilemma for the Palestinian leadership. 
On the one hand, it is anxious to curb the unmitigated backing Palestinians 
gave Saddam during the 1991 Gulf War _ a stance that set back the 
Palestinian cause in the West. At the same time, however, Arafat's 
government apparently wants to allow some outlet for Palestinian street 
sentiment in favor of Iraq. In Manger Square in Bethlehem _ where 
just days ago, U.S. President Bill Clinton received a rapturous greeting 
_ marchers on Friday chanted ``Saddam, Saddam, our beloved,'' and 
``Death to America, death to Clinton, death to Britain!'' Anticipating 
the demonstration, authorities made sure to strip the city of the 
U.S. flags that had hung from electricity poles during the Clinton 
visit. Protesters found a few leftover plastic U.S. flags, and wrapped 
them around their shoes in a sign of contempt. After the demonstration, 
marchers threw stones at Israeli troops guarding the entrance to the 
city. The troops responded with rubber bullets and tear gas. Fifteen 
protesters were injured.
