Palestinian authorities allowed several Palestinian media outlets 
to reopen Saturday after closing them a day earlier over coverage 
of pro-Iraq rallies or for broadcasting what was deemed to be pro-Iraqi 
material. Two other news offices, including the Gaza City bureau of 
The Associated Press, were opened Saturday night after they were closed 
on Friday to prevent what a police official said would be violations 
of ``national interests.'' On Friday, Palestinian police detained 
nine journalists, including some working for foreign news organizations, 
who had covered pro-Iraq demonstrations in the West Bank and the Gaza 
Strip. Five local Palestinian TV stations and one radio station in 
the West Bank were closed down, but all were given permission to reopen 
Saturday. One, however, refused to do so until given an explanation 
for being closed down in the first place. Samir Kumsia, the owner 
of Mahed TV in Bethlehem, said: ``They have to give me a logical explanation. 
Until then I will stay closed. This is not a civilized manner in which 
to deal with us.'' In addition to the AP Gaza City office, the office 
of Orbit Satellite Service, an Israeli-based agency that transmits 
TV footage, was reopened Saturday. A Palestinian police official, 
Col. Mohammed Hindi, told the AP that the foreign news organizations 
had been closed ``to prevent any material from being transmitted from 
the offices to the world that could violate Palestinian national interests.'' 
Earlier Saturday, the Palestinian Journalists Syndicate said in a 
statement that the closing of the offices and the detention of the 
journalists was a ``serious violation'' of their basic rights. The 
syndicate said it would stage a strike as well as a a sit-in at the 
Palestinian legislature on Monday. The New York-based Committee to 
Protect Journalists also protested the curbs on coverage. In a letter 
to Palestinian leader Yasser Arafat, it urged Arafat to allow the 
offices to re-open and denounced ``attempts to silence independent 
journalism in flagrant violation of the right to free expression.'' 
The Foreign Press Association in Israel also said it was sending a 
letter of protest to Arafat's Palestinian Authority.
