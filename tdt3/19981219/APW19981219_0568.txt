Concluding an election campaign marred by violence and a high-profile 
political assassination, St. Petersburg voters were set to decide 
Sunday who would govern their city. The second round of voting for 
the city council is considered key for Russia's democratic politicians, 
whose popularity has been dented by the country's roiling economic 
crisis. Just six of 50 seats were decided in the first round two weeks 
ago. Many see the St. Petersburg poll as a first battle in a long 
political season leading to national parliamentary elections next 
year and elections to replace President Boris Yeltsin in 2000. At 
stake is not just leadership of the northern port, but also control 
over millions of dollars worth of privatization and budget revenues 
in the city. St. Petersburg is Russia's second largest city and a 
traditional stronghold of support for the country's democrats. In 
spite of this reputation, intrigue and violence have blighted the 
campaign. One candidate was beaten with metal rods. A gunman shot 
out the windows of a city council member's apartment with an assault 
rifle. Observers reported vote-buying, in exchange for money or vodka. 
The most shocking violence came on Nov. 20, when unidentified gunmen 
shot and killed the city's top democratic politician, Galina Starovoitova. 
An aide was critically wounded with two gunshots to the head and neck. 
Starovoitova's assassination galvanized St. Petersburg. Turnout for 
the first round was twice as large as expected and democratic candidates 
seem poised to win a majority in the city council as a result. ``The 
killing has elevated this to a higher level,'' said Leonid Kesselman, 
a sociologist and political columnist. ``It's no longer about local 
elections, but a symbol of what will begin in Russia next year.''
