Airplane noise has gotten a lot softer, according to the Federal Aviation 
Administration, and a 10-year program with that in mind is approaching 
a pianissimo finale. But some airlines will face a last-minute rush 
to fix or retire old planes next year, and one, a cargo carrier in 
Miami, will ground some planes in January, until they can be fixed. 
Under a law passed by Congress in 1990, the airlines have had to steadily 
reduce the number of the noisiest airplanes they fly, called Stage 
2 planes; generally, by 1999, those planes must make up less than 
one-quarter of the airlines' fleets, and by 2000, they must be eliminated 
entirely. The first 25 percent cut was in 1994, and the next in 1996. 
``The noise in and around all these airports we live near is going 
to change a lot in the next 12 1/2 months,'' said James Erickson, 
director of the FAA's office of environment and energy. Steps so far 
have been helpful, he said, but ``phasing out that last noisy airplane 
makes a tremendous difference.'' The replacement planes, called Stage 
3, are much quieter; Erickson said that a Stage 2 McDonnell-Douglas 
DC-10, for example, made as much noise as nine new Boeing 777s. Stage 
2 planes include McDonnell Douglas DC-9s and older Boeing 727s and 
737s; Stage 3 planes include newer models of the 727 and 737. The 
rules cover all planes over 75,000 pounds, including small commuter 
planes but not some small corporate jets. The rules affect about 7,500 
planes registered in this country. Some airlines have already met 
the requirements for 2000. United Parcel Service, the first to eliminate 
all its Stage 2 planes, replaced the engines on its 727s to do so. 
UPS flies mostly at night and often into small airports, and said 
it was eager to be a good neighbor. Engineers lower engine noise by 
reducing the maximum speed at which the engines move air. To get more 
thrust, newer engines move more air than old ones. Airlines are selling 
old planes overseas or retiring them, or installing ``hush kits.'' 
American Airlines plans to make its 727s comply with a system that 
limits engine thrust and flap settings. The FAA estimates that in 
1975, 7 million people were exposed to a noise level of 65 decibels 
from planes, considered undesirable. By 1995, the number was down 
to 1.7 million, and by 2000, it will be 600,000 people, the agency 
said. Erickson said that the agency had had 16 requests for exemptions, 
and had turned down 15; one is still under consideration. He added 
that his office was in regular contact with all of the approximately 
260 airlines that fly in the United States, to ensure that they had 
plans to meet the rules. One, Fine Air Services Inc. of Miami, however, 
has had a problem. The airline had counted in its fleet some Stage 
2 planes that it shared with other airlines. When the FAA said it 
could not do so, Fine Air found that it was behind the required quota. 
So the airline signed a consent decree in September, promising to 
convert six of its old DC-8s by Jan. 1. Two have been outfitted with 
hush kits, and equipment is on hand to do four more, said John Zappia, 
the airline's chief operating officer. The other four will be grounded 
on Dec. 26, after the busy cargo season, and stay on the ground until 
work is finished, sometime in January.
