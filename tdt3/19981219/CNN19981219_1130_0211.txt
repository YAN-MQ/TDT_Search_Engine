the vote on impeachment is drawing near. if, as expected, the house 
votes to impeach president clinton, he would become only the second 
president in history to be impeached. the other was andrew johnson, 
130 years ago. the house is engaging in its final debate as it considers 
four articles of impeachment. a vote count by cnn shows a majority 
of lawmakers support at least one article of impeachment. one republican 
says his support of impeachment springs in part from his responsibilities 
as a parent. when they are old enough to appreciate today's solemnitiy, 
i want my young daughters to know that when the last role was called, 
their father served in a house faithful to the guiding principle that 
no person is above the law, and he served with colleagues who counted 
it a privilege to risk political fortune in defense of the constitution.
