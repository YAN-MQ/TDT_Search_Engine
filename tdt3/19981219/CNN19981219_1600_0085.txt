Earlier this afternoon, democrats were pushing for a vote on a censure 
resolution. There was a great deal of debate democrats supporting 
something less than impeachment, republicans saying impeachment was 
the only mechanism available to the House of Representatives, in fact 
it is against the country's constitution to go forward with anything 
but impeachment. In the end, the republicans, having the majority 
in the house were able to vote against the censure resolution. Democrats, 
as a sign of protest, walked out of the Congress as a protest to that 
vote and returned to the house for a vote on the first article of 
impeachment.
