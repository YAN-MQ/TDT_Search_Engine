Moments before impeaching President Clinton on Saturday, the House 
rejected a Democratic proposal, along party lines, to allow lawmakers 
to censure Clinton instead of impeach him. Immediately after a failed 
procedural vote on the censure alternative, about half of the 206 
Democrats stalked out of the House chamber to protest the Republican 
leadership's decision to block a floor vote on censure. ``We're offended 
by this process,'' Rep. Dick Gephardt, D-Mo., the Democratic leader, 
told reporters at the base of the Capitol steps. ``They have disregarded 
the clear will of the American people.'' Public opinion polls show 
that Americans prefer censure over impeachment, but House Republican 
leaders vowed to block a censure vote, arguing that it was unconstitutional 
for the House to punish the president, instead of the Senate. Republican 
leaders feared that allowing a vote on censure would drain away votes 
for impeachment. Democrats, conceding they were fighting a losing 
battle, nonetheless used a series of procedural motions to push the 
censure alternative to the floor. The censure motion, which was rejected 
in the House Judiciary Committee, stated that the president made ``false 
statements'' concerning his ``reprehensible conduct with a subordinate.'' 
It also condemned the president for taking steps to ``delay discovery 
of the truth'' and said Clinton remained subject to criminal and civil 
penalties once he left office. Unlike the version proposed in the 
committee, Saturday's censure motion did not require the Senate's 
approval or Clinton's signature. ``Impeachment should be used only 
as a last resort,'' said Rep. Rick Boucher, D-Va., author of the censure 
motion. ``It is a drastic remedy to remove a tyrant.'' But Republicans 
said censure was not an option the Founding Fathers envisioned as 
a part of the impeachment process. ``Censure is outside the framework 
of the Constitution,'' said Rep. Charles Canady, R-Fla. With the direct 
route to censure blocked, the Democrats took other parliamentary steps. 
Just before voting on the first article, Democrats asked the House 
to reconsider the impeachment resolution, but with instructions to 
censure Clinton instead. This is called a motion to recommit. Republicans 
immediately challenged whether the censure proposal was relevant, 
or germane, to the underlying impeachment issue. This is called a 
point of order. There were several minutes of debate on this matter. 
But the results were carefully scripted, since both sides had submitted 
their arguments in advance to the House parliamentarian, Charles Johnson, 
for his ruling. The parliamentarian, the arbiter of House rules, is 
a nonpartisan position, and members are obliged to follow his recommendations. 
After the brief debate, Rep. Ray LaHood, R-Ill., whom Speaker Newt 
Gingrich named to preside over the impeachment vote from the speaker's 
chair, read a statement, based on Johnson's advice, ruling that censure 
was not germane. The Democrats appealed the chair's ruling. But House 
Republican leaders have made parliamentary votes a test of party loyalty. 
The appeal lost, 230-204. Only two Republicans voted with the Democrats, 
Constance Morella of Maryland and Peter King of New York.
