President Bill Clinton's impeachment vote produced little official 
reaction on Saturday, but TV bulletins worldwide focused on the battle 
in the House of Representatives over his future. A German newspaper 
lamented the loss to American prestige, while a senior aid to Israel's 
prime minister said that the impeachment vote would likely have little 
influence on the Middle East peace process. The British Broadcasting 
Corp. World Service TV and the Sky TV, Britain's two satellite TV 
news services, both led their news bulletins with running coverage 
of the impeachment vote and the political fallout in the United States, 
interspersing coverage with pictures from Baghdad under a fourth night 
of U.S. and British airstrikes. The London-based Middle East Broadcasting 
Corp., which broadcasts in Arabic throughout the Middle East, ran 
the story of Clinton's impeachment second after the latest reports 
from Iraq. On Friday in Iraq, Al-Thawra, the paper of Saddam's ruling 
Baath Party, headlined its anti-American editorial ``Operation Monica,'' 
and said that the airstrikes aimed to deflect attention from Clinton's 
political problems at home and his relationship with the former White 
House intern, Monica Lewinsky. The House of Representatives impeached 
Clinton on Saturday for obstructing justice and lying under oath about 
his sexual affair with Ms. Lewinsky, voting largely along party lines 
to send his case to the Senate. It was only the second presidential 
impeachment in American history. Saying that the vote was an internal 
affair for the United States, British Prime Minister Tony Blair, the 
president's strongest ally outside the United States, said he would 
not comment on the impeachment proceedings. ``That's not right for 
me to do so,'' Blair said at a news conference Saturday. In Israel, 
David Bar-Illan, aide to Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu said: ``Until 
now, none of this domestic embroilment has affected the administration's 
involvement in the peace process and we don't expect it to now.'' 
Calling the impeachment vote ``horrible theater,'' the Berliner Morgenpost 
daily newspaper, said in a Sunday editorial that the Lewinsky affair 
had ``poisoned the political climate of the United States'' and damaged 
the country's standing abroad. ``Already the damage for the image 
and believability of the United States is alarming,'' the editorial 
said, noting that of the seven Republicans who voted in 1868 against 
the impeachment of an early president, Andrew Johnson, ``none were 
reelected.''
