matt yallof, "cnn headline sports." week 16 in the nfl gets under 
way today. two games -- the early contest doesn't get much bigger 
than this. jets and bills at the newly named ralph wilson stadium. 
with a win, new york clinches its first division title since the merger. 
the bills, with a new 15-year lease to stay in buffalo, clinch a playoff 
spot with a victory. i'm still thinking afc east. and until that is 
a dead issue and out of the picture, we believe and i believe we can 
do that. you know, if you can't get ready to play in this game, get 
out of football, you know? do something else. i mean, what game could 
you get ready for if you can't get ready for a division championship 
game? you know? if you can't get ready for the next one after that, 
what're you doing playing? get out. well, the late game is pivotal 
for tampa bay, as the bucs in need to beat washington to keep pace 
for a wild card in the nfc.
