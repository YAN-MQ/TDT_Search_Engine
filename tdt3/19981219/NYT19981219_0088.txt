A group of Massachusetts lawmakers has asked the federal government 
for $100 million in aid to help thousands of fishermen threatened 
by the collapse of cod stocks in the Gulf of Maine. In a letter sent 
last week, Sen. Edward Kennedy, D-Mass., and four other members of 
Congress urged the administration to include in the federal budget 
for 2000 an emergency relief package for fishermen and cities that 
rely on the cod stocks economically. Regulators voted last week to 
bar fishing in several spawning grounds off the coast of New England 
in an effort to stop the collapse of the cod supplies. Scientists 
announced this month that cod stocks in the Gulf of Maine, already 
known to be depleted, had dropped to a 30-year low. As many as 2,500 
fishermen, many of them small-boat owners who cannot travel far off-shore 
to the open fishing grounds, will be affected by the closures. Cities 
like Gloucester, Mass., which has long depended on fishing, have already 
been hit hard by the industry decline and government restrictions 
in recent years to protect fishing stocks. ``We need an 80 percent 
reduction in current fishing levels in order to start rebuilding the 
Gulf of Maine cod stock,'' said Patricia Fiorelli, spokeswoman for 
the New England Fishery Management Council, which voted for the closures. 
As dismayed as they are by the new restrictions, fishermen are already 
bracing for more regulation next year, which might include further 
limiting fishing trips or closures beyond the spawning period. Tom 
Brancaleone, president of the Gloucester Fishermen's Association, 
has already sold his boat and gone into semi-retirement at age 56. 
``We've been frustrated for 20 years, but not like now,'' Brancaleone 
said. The lawmakers ask in the letter that the aid go toward health 
care for fishermen and their families, boat buybacks, career counseling 
for those who must stop fishing and projects to diversify the economy. 
``We've got a lot of fishing people who are suffering a significant 
economic setback, not unlike farmers in some parts of the country,'' 
said Sen. John Kerry, D-Mass., one of the signers of the letter. ``There 
we've made an effort to soften the blow. Now we have to begin to understand 
our responsibilities to these communities.'' Massachusetts Reps. Barney 
Frank, Bill Delahunt and John Tierney, all Democrats, also signed 
the letter to the budget office director, Jack Lew. Brancaleone, like 
many of the fishermen, is skeptical of the scientists' data and says 
the cod stocks are not lower. He would rather see the government lift 
the restrictions than offer money to buy fishermen's boats. ``Fishermen 
are proud people and they like to make their own living,'' he said. 
``No one here wants a handout.'' The federal government has given 
$80 million to the New England fishing industry since 1994, including 
$25 million for boat buybacks. ``At that time the clear message was, 
`This is the last time,''' said Peter Shelley, director of the Marine 
Resources Project at the Conservation Law Foundation. ``I'm fairly 
skeptical that a majority of Congress knows enough about the pain 
that a fishing closure can bring to want to help in this kind of situation. 
I hope I'm wrong.'' But without relief now, fishermen might be tempted 
to fish stocks beyond the point of recovery, he said.
