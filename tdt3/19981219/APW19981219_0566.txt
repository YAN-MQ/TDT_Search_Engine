The European Union is to pursue a ``comprehensive dialogue'' with 
Iran, including issues of human rights, international terrorism and 
the Middle East peace process, media reported Saturday. Albert Rohan, 
general secretary of the Austrian foreign ministry met Friday with 
Iran's vice-foreign minister Morteza Samadi in Vienna. A German and 
British representative also attended the meeting. Major points to 
be discussed included human rights, international terrorism, weapons 
of mass destruction and the Middle East peace process. Economic support 
for Iran is also up for discussion, but presents problems, Rohan said, 
largely because the EU does not have an economic agreement with Iran. 
Special funds for fighting drug smuggling and caring for refugees 
in Iran, however, are under consideration, Die Presse daily reported. 
Austria currently holds the rotating EU presidency and Germany will 
take over early next year.
