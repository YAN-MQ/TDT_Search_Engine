A candidate running on a platform of fighting corruption has been 
elected president of a New Jersey Teamsters union local long considered 
to be one of the most corrupt labor organizations in the nation. The 
4,400-member unit, Local 560 of the International Brotherhood of Teamsters, 
has been under federal trusteeship since 1986, and last had an election 
in 1988. It represents truck drivers, warehouse workers and factory 
employees. Pete Brown, a onetime truck driver who had been serving 
as the local's president by designation of its board until he won 
Friday's election, said, ``This tells the mob and their cronies to 
get out and keep on going.'' The election took place after the court-appointed 
trustee, Edwin Stier, spent years trying to weed out officials and 
members with mob ties and to encourage honest workers to move into 
leadership positions. From the 1950s through the '70s, Local 560, 
based in Union City, was run by the Provenzano family, especially 
by Anthony ``Tony Pro'' Provenzano, who was convicted of racketeering, 
extortion and murder. In 1986, Local 560 became the first Teamsters 
local in the nation to be taken over by the federal government as 
the result of a civil racketeering suit charging leaders with being 
close to mobsters. Many members of the local have complained about 
being under federal control for 12 years, but Stier said rooting out 
all the corrupt elements had been difficult. Stier said Brown's victory, 
achieved with a turnout of 46 percent of the membership, was an important 
step toward ending the era of mob influence. He said he would soon 
make a recommendation about the trusteeship to the federal judge who 
oversees the union, but did not say what he might recommend. ``This 
election,'' Stier said in an interview, ``confirms my belief that 
the membership has rejected domination by organized crime and has 
created new independent leadership that has fought against the racketeer 
element in the union.'' Stier was badly disappointed the last time 
he organized an election at Local 560. That election, held in 1988, 
was won by Michael Sciarra, who was later expelled from the union 
after he was found to have associated with the Genovese crime family. 
Brown has served as president of the local for the last 13 months, 
having been elected by the local's seven-person board. The board's 
composition has changed in recent years as Stier repeatedly ousted 
members found to have connections to organized crime. Brown, whose 
seven-member slate swept the election, said his board was like that 
of many other unions, dedicated to negotiating good contracts, recruiting 
new members and fighting for its members' grievances. According to 
official results, Brown received 55 percent of the vote, easily outdistancing 
his two rivals. One was Daniel Sciarra, nephew of the ousted former 
president. The other candidate was Al Laurie, who was business manager 
under Sciarra. Brown received 1,049 votes, Laurie 476 votes and Sciarra 
376 votes.
