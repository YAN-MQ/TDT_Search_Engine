Hundreds of protesters attacked the U.S. and British embassies in 
Damascus on Saturday as tens of thousands of Syrians took to the city's 
main downtown streets to denounce the American and British air strikes 
on Iraq. Witnesses said the U.S. Embassy's Marine guards fired tear 
gas to disperse the crowd, but three protesters managed to enter the 
grounds and climb the walls of the building to haul down and burn 
the American flag. Chanting ``Down with America!'' a crowd estimated 
at a thousand surrounded the embassy in the upscale al-Rawdha neighborhood. 
Many pelted the building with stones, shattering windows. ``It's very 
crowded. They are throwing stones,'' said a switchboard operator at 
the embassy who would not give his name. The mobs later attacked two 
other American installations and two British government buildings, 
but there were no reports of injuries to any Westerners. Witnesses 
said about a dozen protesters were taken away to a hospital after 
being overcome by tear gas outside the U.S. Embassy. Large demonstrations 
are rare in the Syrian capital, which is under tight security control, 
and Saturday's marches throughout the downtown could not have occurred 
without government approval.
