From Utah to Georgia, more American troops are heading to the Persian 
gulf in support of operations against Iraq. 500 personnel are leaving 
FT. bliss, Texas. Units from other bases in Texas also are on their 
way, as are 105 pilots from langley air force base in Virginia. As 
Eric horng reports from one base, the timing of the deployment is 
affecting different people in different ways. At a time many Americans 
are preparing for holiday homecomings, others are leaving their families 
behind, thundering toward the Persian gulf, answering the Pentagon's 
call to action. Few servicemen and women are surprised by this latest 
deployment. But the timing is still hard to take. I haven't seen my 
family in two years. And I'm missing them by four days. He'll be walking 
when I come back, so that's the sad thing. But for others, the deployment 
means Christmas comes a few days early this year. Aram and kale rice 
are already playing with their Christmas gifts, thanks to an early 
visit from Santa. We found out and he came last night. That is one 
good Santa claus. Yeah, we called him up, and he came early. We did 
the whole thing. We had the big ham dinner. Turkeys, all the trimmings. 
But for edith McDavid of Greenville, Mississippi, the deployment is 
affecting more than holiday plans McDavid's fiance is headed to the 
gulf instead of the Altar. The couple had planned to get married this 
weekend. Now, her wedding dress hangs on a wall and, unused decorations 
litter a Room in the house. I don't know what to do with these things. 
I guess we'll never be able to use them. Before these latest deployments, 
the U.S. already had more than 24,000 military personnel in the Persian 
gulf region. Now, with thousands more on the way, their families are 
hoping for a speedy end to the crisis so the holidays can truly begin.
