This is the vote on the very first article of impeachment. That being 
perjury and as that is being taken, the democrats are sounding off 
on the steps of the capitol, telling the world what they think, how 
unfair this is. That is that they will not be allowed to have a censure 
resolution. There's David Bonior. The one option that commands us 
a part of the American people and that is censure. These partisan 
proceedings -- The magic number is 218. Our count is 219 confirmed 
votes for impeachment. One notable republican Christopher Shays of 
Connecticut in an empassioned three minute speech said he could not 
support them but mostly every other moderate republican has joined 
ranks with the house leadership and will vote at least one article 
of impeachment. And we will rejoin the vote when we return. The democrats 
have made their case and presumably they'll file back into the chamber. 
They would not want this historic occasion to go without their votes 
being recorded. But here is the first article of impeachment and you 
see it ice already lop-sided 157 to 73. We'll be right back.
