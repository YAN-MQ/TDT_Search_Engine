The bombs may be sophisticated, but the sentiments scribbled on them 
are not. ``Hold Onto Yer Butt,'' read one. ``Die, You Magets,'' said 
another. Warned a third: ``This is Gunna Hurt.'' There is something 
about warfare that brings out the very basic. In this most modern 
of combat operations, targeting orders arrive by e-mail, crew members 
watch the war unfold on satellite television and every bomb this aircraft 
carrier has dispatched toward Iraq was guided by laser. And in a first 
for the U.S. Navy, women have been flying combat missions, taking 
off from this command post, the main staging area for what have been 
three nights of dusk-to-dawn operations. But just below the flight 
deck, in the ``Bomb Farm,'' the high-tech weapons had been scrawled 
with Magic Markers in that time-tested way, to send crude messages 
to Iraq of what sailors really think. ``To Sadam, Mery X-Mas,'' one 
said. The Bomb Farm messages are among a number of jarring contrasts 
aboard this jarring ship, where stockings have been hung beneath the 
admiral's Christmas tree just a few doors away from the deck where 
crew members load 2,000-pound bombs onto Navy warplanes in preparation 
for a fourth night of attacks. The attacks, by American and British 
forces, resumed after sunset, the Pentagon announced in Washington. 
Since the strikes began early Wednesday here, the televisions perched 
all over the ship have been tuned to CNN, allowing nearly everyone 
aboard to track both the impeachment debate in Washington and the 
impact of the air strikes launched from here. On the first night of 
the attack, crew members watched from an observation deck as warplanes 
took off from the carrier and cruise missiles were fired from here, 
then hurried inside to watch on television as the rest of the world 
learned what had happened. And because the Enterprise is fully wired, 
most of the crew have made time during the operation to check their 
e-mail and to assure loved ones that everything is all right. ``It's 
bizarre _ really strange,'' said Lt. Randy Miller, an F-18/A pilot 
who has sent an electronic ``I'm OK'' note to his wife, at home in 
Chesapeake, Va., after returning from each of the three bombing missions 
he has flown against Iraq. There had been speculation that the attacks 
might end Saturday, the first day of Ramadan, the Muslim holy month. 
But Capt. Tom Hagan, commander of the carrier's air wing, said Saturday 
afternoon that the missions would continue into a fourth night, and 
that his aircraft were still ``working down the target set'' provided 
by the Pentagon at the outset. A second carrier, the Carl Vinson, 
entered the Persian Gulf Saturday, doubling to 92 the number of Navy 
attack planes here and adding hundreds more cruise missiles to a stock 
greatly depleted in the first three nights. Rear Adm. James Cutler 
Dawson Jr., commander of the naval task force in the gulf, said both 
carriers would take part in the attack planned for tonight. Reporters 
aboard the Enterprise were told that to maintain the security of the 
operation, they would not be permitted to file any information after 
4 p.m. local time (10 a.m. ET.) On each of the last three nights, 
the 46 F-14 and F-18/A fighters on board the Enterprise have launched 
90 bombing missions in a tempo that for most crew members has left 
little time for sleep. They have dropped hundreds of bombs on targets 
in Iraq, ranging from 500- to 2,000-pound bombs, cutting deep into 
what had been stored in magazines beneath the deck. Admiral Dawson 
told reporters Saturday, ``We have sufficient ordnance to sustain 
us for quite some time.'' But the ship's commanding officer, Capt. 
Evan Chanik, said in a message to the crew late Saturday afternoon, 
``Very truthfully, I don't know what's going to happen here into the 
future.'' The pilots include three women, two of whom took part in 
the first wave of attacks early Thursday morning. The change in Pentagon 
policy allowing women to fly combat missions was not made until after 
the Persian Gulf war, and officers aboard the ship acknowledged that 
the women had made Navy history. But one of them, Lt. Kendra Williams, 
26, of Anchorage, Alaska, described that fact as ``not a huge deal.'' 
A 1994 graduate of the Naval Academy, Lieutenant Williams has flown 
her F-18/A on two bombing missions, but insisted on her own behalf 
and that of the two other women, ``None of us is really out for that 
kind of recognition.'' All the pilots have returned unscathed, and 
none of the planes have been hit by Iraqi fire, one officer said. 
But some pilots said that at some points they had encountered heavy 
antiaircraft fire. ``We went to Baghdad last night and it was pretty 
intense,'' said an F-18/A pilot who asked that his name not be used. 
Deep in the bowels of the ship Saturday, crew members were assembling 
laser-guided bombs to precise specifications to hit the particular 
weapons bunkers, barracks and other sites on Saturday night's target 
list. In general, commanders said they were pleased with the damage 
achieved, with most strikes recorded and later reviewed on videotape 
taken from cameras mounted on each aircraft. But they suggested that 
nerves and inexperience might have slowed the operation in its early 
stages. Hagan said the attacks on Thursday night ``in particular were 
very satisfying in terms of our ability to take out the targets that 
we've been assigned,'' adding that there had been ``less anxiety and 
more experience'' than in the first two nights.
