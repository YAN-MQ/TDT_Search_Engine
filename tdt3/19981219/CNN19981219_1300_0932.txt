Democrats are filing back in. Their protest ended and they are going 
in to vote on the first of four articles of impeachment against pk 
pg. If only one prevails he stands peached and an impeachment is an 
indictment. It is an indictment and the matter is then sent to the 
Senate for a trial, although some bargaining may occur and no trial 
might occur, but senator trent Lott the majority leader says that 
will never happen. Mr. Clinton is accused of lying to a grand jury, 
lying in the Paula Jones sexual harassment suit, obstructing justice 
and abuse of power. Of the four, it is regarded that the first has 
the best chance of succeeding. That's the one being voted on right 
now. This would be lying to a grand jury. It's worth noting that as 
democrat Barney Frank pointed out, the exact phrase in President Clinton's 
grand jury testimony August 17th of this year that is deemed perjurious 
has never been identified. The republican accusers have never line 
by line gone over and said, this is what is perjury. That has made 
democrats mad. Four articles of impeachment and the magic number is 
218. There seems almost no chance that he will not be impeached on 
this first article. Every democrat is in the house except Shun, George 
Miller, California democrat, who has recovering from hip surgery and 
will not be able to vote. He said he wasn't needed anyway. As you 
know in case you're just joining us the censure motion that the democrats 
had hoped to submit in place of an impeachment vote has been ruled 
out of order. It was ruled nongermane. There was perhaps half hour 
of passionate debate over that. Lots of precedents were cited including 
one from Bob bar on the censure motion against President Andrew Jackson. 
Bob bar indicated that that was overruled as well. So that was the 
guiding precedent apparently with which the chair voted to overrule 
the democrats' motion to recommit the impeachment debate in favor 
of censure motion and as we just learned, the motion to table that 
overrule failed and so here is the very first impeachment vote. Only 
19 -- make it 21 votes short of actually impeaching the president. 
He will be the first president since Andrew Johnson to be impeached 
and the first elected president in history to be impeached.
