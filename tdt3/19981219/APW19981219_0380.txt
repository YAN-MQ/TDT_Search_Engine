India beat defending champion South Korea 4-2 in a penalty shootout 
for the Asian Games field hockey gold medal Saturday, after the two 
drew 1-1 in regulation time and 14 minutes' extra time. Earlier, Pakistan 
defeated Japan 3-0 for the bronze medal. ``Our strong point tonight 
was teamwork,'' said Indian head coach M. Kaushik. ``The Koreans are 
very strong and quick and I wasn't sure if we would come out on top.'' 
But Korean captain Park Shin-heum wept as he walked off the field 
after coming so close to bringing his nation its third men's hockey 
gold in four games. ``We played a very good game today,'' said Kim 
Sang-ryul, Korea's head coach. ``A high number of penalty corners 
made problems for us. They are the fastest players in the world.'' 
At the start, Korea came on strong with short, quick passes that put 
the solid Indian team to the test. Five minutes into the game, Korea 
scored first when Yeo Woon-gon slammed the ball in on the team's second 
penalty corner attempt. Korea came close in the 9th minute when Song 
Seung-tae made it past the Indian defenders but goalkeeper Ashish 
Ballal managed to block the shot with his foot. In the 21st minute, 
captain Dhannaraj Pillay slammed in an equalizer for India on a field 
goal, causing the large and raucous crowd of Indian fans to shout 
in delight. India opened the second half with a series of back-to-back 
drives and fast breaks that brought the crowd to its feet. Neither 
team could score in the second half or during the 14 minutes of extra 
time, forcing the penalty shootout. ``We have one of the best goalkeepers,'' 
said Indian captain Pillay. ``The team is great and it should be kept 
until 2000,'' the Olympic year. In the battle for the bronze, Pakistan 
shut out Japan with superior ball-handling and short, quick passes. 
Japan put up strong resistance to Pakistan's fast breaks in the first 
half, allowing it only a handful of attempts. Japan failed to score 
from four penalty corners, while Pakistan was able to score two goals 
from its seven penalty corner tries. Pakistan's Sohail Abbas scored 
first in the 34th minute, slamming the ball in from a penalty corner 
pass. Abbas, the team's striker, also scored Pakistan's second goal 
with another penalty corner in the 8th minute of the second half. 
A goal in the 21st minute of the second half by Muhammud Nadeem gave 
Pakistan insurance. ``The overall performance of the team was very 
good,'' said Abbas. ``We wanted to play well and we wanted to win. 
The players played as a team and covered up each others' weaknesses.''
