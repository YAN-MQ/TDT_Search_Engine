Hundreds of protesters attacked the U.S. Embassy in Damascus on Saturday 
as tens of thousands of Syrians took to the streets to denounce the 
American and British air strikes on Iraq. Chanting ``Down with America,'' 
a crowd estimated at a thousand surrounded the embassy in the upscale 
Rowda neighborhood. Many pelted the building with stones, shattering 
windows. Witnesses said embassy guards fired tear gas to disperse 
the crowd. ``It's very crowded. They are throwing stones,'' said a 
switchboard operator at the embassy who would not give his name. The 
building was believed to be largely empty and closed for the day. 
Efforts to reach officials at the embassy proved unsuccessful since 
the operator said no one was available to comment.
