This is Orelon Sidney with your "CNN Headline News" weather update. 
Showers and thunderstorms will be numerous as we head through the 
evening hours on Saturday across the gulf coast and into near cape 
hatteras. Also, look for showers and snow mixed across portions of 
New England as a Cold front moves offshore. The front and the west 
will drag slightly and then move northward as we head into Sunday. 
That's going to mean warmer temperatures for the deep south on Sunday. 
Atlanta, Georgia, will see a high in the 60s. You'll see a chance 
of snow flurries across the western United States as a Low-pressure 
storm affects the four corners. Cold temperatures are expected today, 
especially for the northern Rockies and the northern plains with temperatures 
in the single digits to below zero. Readings along the coasts range 
from the 20s and 30s to 60s and the 70s. Our extended forecast includes 
a heavy mix Monday across the Great Lakes with showers and thunderstorms 
trailing southward into the gulf of Mexico. The bitter cold continues 
across the northern plains for Tuesday and into wednesday with scattered 
snow showers expected nationwide. The extended forecast for more than 
7,000 cities is at CNN.com.
