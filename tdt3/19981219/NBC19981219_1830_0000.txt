on this vote, the yeas are 228 and the nays are 206. article one is 
adopted. bill clinton becomes the first elected president ever impeached 
by vote of the full house of representatives. yes to two articles, 
no to two others, the case goes on to the senate. i hope there will 
be a constitutional and fair manner of resolving this quickly. and 
tonight -- the search, underway for the next speaker of the house. 
the last man in line for the job has pulled out. i must set the example 
that i hope president clinton will follow. i will not stand for speaker 
of the house on january sixth. good evening. it has been a day for 
the history books here in the nation's capitol, though historians 
may not look kindly on what transpired behind me here today. william 
jefferson clinton is now the first elected president to be impeached 
by the house, the second president in all of history. he says he will 
stay on the job, while his fate is already lying before the u.s. senate 
in the form of two articles of impeachment agreed to here today. the 
nation is tonight without a speaker of the house designate. bob livingston 
is resigning because of the scandal that has eroded his power base. 
and the business of the federal government continues half a world 
away with the announcement that the bombing is over in iraq, at least 
for now.
