The House vote calling for Bill Clinton's impeachment went unheard 
at Bennett's, a camping and military surplus store that has been a 
fixture in downtown Little Rock since 1870. There were no televisions, 
no radios, and no reason for them. The owner, Joe Kaufman, did not 
need to see one more nail driven into the pride of his city and state 
and into the hearts of the people who once saw such promise in a favorite 
son. ``It's boredom,'' Kaufman said when asked why people in his store 
and in the city just seemed to be going about their business on the 
day the House of Representatives voted to bring President Clinton 
to trial. It is not that they do not care, only that they are weary 
of it all, weary of feeling bad. ``Another slap in the face,'' said 
Kaufman, 73. ``We've been put down so much, for a man who had shown 
us such hope and promise. It's a little like a personal affront, a 
sinking feeling.'' A Southern state, mostly rural, long defensive 
over jokes about its sophistication, had given the nation a president. 
In return, people here say, the nation has only piled more derision 
and ridicule on them. In the city where Bill Clinton's political dreams 
were first validated by those who believed in him, people accepted 
the House vote calling for his impeachment with a sense of resignation, 
sorrow, and, some, with satisfaction. ``Bill did some dumb stuff, 
but he did some good,'' said Jackie Cox, who runs Newsmart Liquor 
in downtown Little Rock and has been angry with what she sees as a 
political witch hunt to unseat the president. ``But,'' she said, ``this 
is all just too much. I feel like there has to be a quitting place.'' 
In the television section of Dillard's, a department store in the 
upscale Park Plaza shopping center in western Little Rock, 42 of the 
56 televisions were turned to the House proceedings. But there was 
no crowd to watch it. Many shoppers did not so much as glance as they 
moved through the aisles searching for toasters, china and the perfect 
gift. ``I'm really tired of this,'' said Carrie Foster, 34, a medical 
administrator who was shopping Saturday afternoon with her fiance, 
Brian Scott, 30, vice president of a real estate title company. Ms. 
Foster commented: ``I wish he'd resign and be done with it. I really 
don't think it's an impeachable matter.'' But of Clinton's presidency, 
she said, ``It's a wash,'' and added: ``He could really have improved 
the image of the state, put it in a good light. But he's brought us 
back down.'' She said she voted for Clinton in 1992, but for Bob Dole 
in 1996. There was no remorse in her fiance, who voted against Clinton 
both times. ``He lied and he lied before a federal grand jury,'' Scott 
said. ``Nobody forced him to lie. It's an embarrassment.'' Of the 
president's scandals, Scott said: ``I go to regional meetings in Chicago, 
and they say to me, `Hey, Bubba.' In Los Angeles, that's all I heard 
about. So I started telling them I was from Texas. And then I stopped 
going altogether. It's really embarrassing.'' Most people shopping 
in downtown Little Rock had not even heard about Rep. Robert Livingston, 
the House speaker-designate, and his decision to resign after acknowledging 
that he, too, had had affairs. The ones who had heard said it was 
only evidence that all leaders were flawed, somehow. ``He doesn't 
deserve this,'' Jessie Thompson, 59, a hospital coordinator, said 
of Clinton's impeachment. Tom Catlett, 73, the Monroe County judge, 
from Clarendon, Ark., voiced the unease of many here that the vote 
was pure politics against the president. ``It's a straight partisan 
deal,'' Catlett said. ``We all make mistakes. I think he brought half 
of it on himself. But I'm not going to put my foot on a friend. There's 
some wrong in all of us.'' His wife, Estelle, 65, agreed, saying, 
``He should not be crucified.'' Jo Cheek, 62, of Little Rock, is a 
strong Clinton supporter. ``It's sad, really sad,'' Ms. Cheek said. 
``It's tearing the country up.'' But those who have not supported 
Clinton had no pity. ``He lied,'' said David Hall, 52, a doctor. ``It's 
a shame for the state and the country. He had so much negative press 
from the get-go.'' The Monica Lewinsky affair was just the caboose 
on a train, some here said. ``These were like the rumors we've heard 
about around here for years,'' Hall said, ``so we were not surprised,''. 
His wife, Victoria, 49, voted for Clinton in 1992 but not in 1996. 
``It's his dishonesty that brought us to this point,'' she said, ``not 
politics.''
