After more than three years of trial for former Premier Giulio Andreotti 
on Mafia charges, a date has been set for final arguments, although 
a verdict is likely months away. The trial in the Sicilian capital 
of Andreotti, who is accused of using his political influence to aid 
Cosa Nostra, began in September 1995. After calling hundreds of witnesses, 
including many mobsters who are now collaborating with the state, 
the court on Saturday announced that final arguments will begin on 
Jan. 19, after recess for Christmas and New Year's holidays. The arguments 
by both prosecution and defense are expected to take months, and no 
verdict is expected before sometime in the spring, according to court 
sources. Andreotti, once one of Italy's most powerful politicians 
for decades after World War II while his Christian Democrat party 
was predominant, has denied any ties with mobsters. One ex-mobster 
told the court that Andreotti once received a kiss of respect from 
Salvatore Riina, the reputed top boss of Cosa Nostra who was arrested 
in 1993. His defense has raised the possibility that turncoats might 
be getting back at him for anti-Mafia laws passed by his coalitions.
