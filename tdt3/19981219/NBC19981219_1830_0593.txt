we have this program note tonight. impeachment, and the search for 
a house speaker will be the primary topics tomorrow morning on "meet 
the press." senators dodd, hatch, leahy, and mcconnell are among tim 
russert's guests. in a moment, the other major story of this day, 
the announced end of air strikes against iraq. which of these two 
computers is perfect for you? the one that was built two months ago 
or this one, which hasn't been built yet? gateway wants to ask you 
some questions first. how fast do you want to go? movie buff? how 
many kids? any future rembrandts? the perfect computer should be exactly 
what you want it to be. starting at $999 all the way up to your dream 
system. call gateway about guaranteed christmas delivery. man, that 
chili was hot. you got heartburn, too? yeah. wanna try these new pepcid 
ac chewables? it says you gotta take it with water. what's the water 
for? with tums you don't need water. just because new pepcid is chewable 
doesn't mean it works like tums. tums calcium knocks out heartburn 
fast. pepcid chewables' famotidine has to go through your bloodstream, 
so it takes 40 minutes just to start controlling acid. wanna go back 
for water? forget the water. pass the tums. tums ta tum tum tums
