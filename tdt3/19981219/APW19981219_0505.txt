International officials demanded unity Saturday from the leaders of 
Kosovo's independence-minded ethnic Albanians, saying that was a necessary 
condition for any fruitful talks with the Serbian government. French 
and Austrian diplomats led a group of international officials to the 
provincial capital Saturday for talks with ethnic Albanian leaders, 
in an attempt to bring together the rebel Kosovo Liberation Army and 
more moderate followers of Ibrahim Rugova. ``We want to give a strong 
signal to the Kosovo Albanian side (that) it's time now to start real 
negotiating at a broad base ... that represents all the Kosovo Albanian 
political forces,'' said Wolfgang Petritsch, Austria's Ambassador 
to Belgrade. ``We are still short of a real and definite commitment 
that will lead to a concrete forming of such a team.'' Petritsch, 
along with French Ambassador to neighboring Macedonia, Jacques Huntzinger, 
met first with Fehmi Agani, the head of the Albanian negotiating team 
in the southern Serbian province. Agani represents Rugova's camp, 
which has said it will accept broad autonomy for Kosovo within Serbia, 
the dominant republic in Yugoslavia. The KLA is determined to fight 
for full independence. ``Time is running out and everybody must make 
some efforts for reopening the door for political process. We hope 
the door will be open ... in the next days,'' Huntzinger said. Representatives 
of the six-member international Contact Group _ Britain, France, Germany, 
Italy, the United States and Russia _ also attended the talks and 
later met with KLA spokesman, Adem Demaci. The KLA previously have 
been barred from political negotiations because of their continued 
military activity. Petritsch challenged the Kosovo Albanian side to 
``come up with a solution to this.'' He added ``there are positive 
signals that the KLA is realizing ... that they have to decide whether 
to continue on the military path or if they want to join political 
negotiating process.'' The talks come on the heels of what has been 
the bloodiest week in Kosovo since Yugoslav President Slobodan Milosevic 
agreed to scale back his troops in October. More than 1,000 people 
have been killed and up to 300,000 forced from their homes since fighting 
escalated early this year. Just outside of Pristina Saturday, hundreds 
of Serbs attended the burial of Zvonko Bojanic, a municipal leader 
who was brutally killed. Bojanic's body was found dumped along a roadside 
early Friday, badly beaten, and shot between the eyes, with multiple 
fracture wounds. The Serbs blame the KLA for the killing, but Demaci 
has denied the rebels were involved in the killing, suggesting Serbian 
secret police may have been behind it. ``Our targets are exclusively 
police and military of the Serbian regime,'' said Demaci. Serbian 
police said, however, that the five assailants who broke into Bojanic's 
home and kidnapped him Thursday night wore KLA uniforms. Also Saturday, 
relatives of 36 ethnic Albanian guerrilla fighters killed in a border 
clash on Monday recovered the bodies from the Serb-run morgue in Prizren 
and were preparing to bury them in a collective ceremony on Sunday.
