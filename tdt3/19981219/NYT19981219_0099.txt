As defiant as on the day she blamed the Monica Lewinsky scandal on 
a ``vast right-wing conspiracy,'' Hillary Rodham Clinton went to Capitol 
Hill on Saturday morning and blasted an unfair, politically motivated 
impeachment process that she said the president would continue to 
fight. In a closed meeting with House Democrats, Mrs. Clinton said 
she was there in part as ``a wife who loves and supports her husband,'' 
and charged that Republicans were impeaching her husband _ ``hounding 
him out of office,'' she said _ because they opposed his agenda. ``She 
said this is as much about ending his agenda on health care and other 
things as about hounding him out of office,'' said Rep. Bob Menendez 
of New Jersey. ``She said there would be no resignation and we should 
not and cannot allow them to hound him out of office.'' Mrs. Clinton 
is extremely popular among congressional Democrats _ far more so than 
her husband _ and came to inoculate him against the possibility that 
Democrats could be persuaded that resignation might be best for the 
country. Two House Democrats, Rep. Louise Slaughter of New York and 
Rep. William Lipinski of Illinois, had already said they would urge 
resignation if he were impeached. ``She was determined and defiant,'' 
said Rep. Jerrold Nadler of New York. ``Her message was that they've 
been pursuing him since the day he came into office.'' In what several 
members called a ``pep rally,'' she thanked Democrats for their support 
and asked them to keep it coming, receiving half a dozen standing 
ovations. After the meeting, members stood in line to give her a hug. 
And as they left, several House Democrats referred at least obliquely 
to Mrs. Clinton's own political prospects. ``She's probably the most 
popular person in the country with Democrats, period, and that's also 
true of us in the caucus,'' said Rep. Eliot Engel of New York, where 
Mrs. Clinton has been mentioned as someone with the potential to succeed 
Daniel Patrick Moynihan in the Senate. Mrs. Clinton's continued support 
for her husband has been seen as crucial to his popularity with the 
public, cited again and again by those who say they will stick with 
him, too, in statements along the order of ``If Hillary doesn't mind, 
why should I?'' or ``That's between him, his God, and Hillary.'' Though 
Mrs. Clinton got generous credit for campaigning in congressional 
races before the November elections, some Democrats had still expressed 
nervousness that she had not offered fresh support for the president 
in recent weeks. (Friends said she was annoyed by the inference: Was 
she supposed to announce her continued support every day? Or lobby 
Republicans who wince at the mention of her name?) And her appearance 
on Saturday, following supportive remarks she made on Friday, definitively 
ended a week of speculation that Mrs. Clinton had decided to distance 
herself from her husband, in the hour of his greatest political need, 
in order to keep her own options open. That the Clintons held hands 
rather less on their recent trip to Israel than on earlier trips, 
and that Mrs. Clinton seemed to pull away from her husband at one 
moment, were reported on CNN, NBC and a number of newspapers as evidence 
that Mrs. Clinton was no longer on the team. The headline on the page 
one story that ran in the Washington Times on Wednesday was ``Hillary 
shows signs of relinquishing role as the defender in chief for her 
husband.'' But on Saturday she said she had come to the Hill as ``a 
wife who loves and supports her husband,'' a Judiciary Committee staff 
member during Watergate who knows firsthand how the process should 
work, and an American who feels proud of the Democrats. Members said 
that the first lady's demeanor had been serious but that she never 
stopped smiling. Rep. Dennis Kucinich of Ohio said he felt pumped 
up by the meeting with Mrs. Clinton: ``It's a campaign all over again. 
This needs to be a fight every step of the way, and we're going to 
wake the town and tell the people.'' And he suggested that at this 
late date, the two-for-one presidency has new life: ``She's so terrific,'' 
he said. ``It's lucky for America we have a woman with the strength 
to lead the nation right now. And everybody understands she is one 
of the leaders of the nation right now, as much as the president.''
