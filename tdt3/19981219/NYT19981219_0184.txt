Two of the three previous speakers of the House were hounded by scandal 
before Robert Livingston's withdrawal Saturday after admitting to 
marital indiscretions. Rep. Jim Wright of Texas, a Democrat who was 
speaker from Jan. 6, 1987, to June 6, 1989, was forced out by accusations 
that he had skirted restrictions on outside income, some of it from 
book royalties. His pursuer was Rep. Newt Gingrich, a Georgia Republican. 
Wright was succeeded as speaker by Rep. Tom Foley, a Democrat from 
Washington state, who lost his seat in the Republican avalanche of 
1994. Gingrich succeeded Foley and survived House charges over the 
use of tax-exempt money for partisan purposes. But having weathered 
his own scandal, Gingrich was felled after the Republicans' poor showing 
in November's elections, in which the party tried to capitalize on 
the Monica Lewinsky matter. Livingston was out before he was in, having 
been speaker-designate for exactly one month.
