while the president fights to save his job, house republicans are 
busy trying to figure out who will be the next speaker of the house, 
now that the speaker-elect is resigning. joe johns has been with that 
all day long. house republicans were voting on impeachment today but 
found they were losing their own leader in the process. to a chorus 
of cheers and boos from the public at the capitol, congressman bob 
livingston walked away today from the third most powerful position 
in the government. inside, he had been cheered by his colleagues after 
his unexpected announcement. the current chairman of the powerful 
house appropriations committee who would have been the successor to 
newt gingrich gave up both the speakership and his seat in congress 
after disclosing extramarital infidelities. republicans called him 
a hero. there is no greater american at least today, in my mind than 
bob livingston. even the top democrat in the house said livingston 
should reconsider. i believe his decision to retire is a terrible 
capitulation to the negative forces that are consuming our political 
system folks back in livingston's new orleans district took the news 
hard. i'm stunned. i thought he would be president of the united states 
one day. a republican critic of the president who recently admitted 
an extramarital affair of his own and a child out of wedlock said 
there's message in livingston's departure. i think that the people 
who are in public life, in any level, owe the public a good job. and 
they need to be held accountable for their public duties. their private 
lives should be their own. there is already a leader in the race to 
replace livingston. congressman dennis hastert widely regarded as 
a consensus builder. the vote on a new speaker has been scheduled 
for the first week in january. there is a possibility others could 
get in the race.
