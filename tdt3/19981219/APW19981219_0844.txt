Iraq's vice president declared Saturday that the Baghdad regime will 
end all dealings with the U.N. Special Commission, which oversees 
weapons inspections, in response to the American and British air strikes. 
Taha Yassin Ramadan made the statement shortly before a half-dozen 
loud blasts rocked the capital, indicating that the fourth wave of 
punishing missile strikes was underway. Two of the missiles struck 
near the Labor and Social Affairs Ministry, gouging a 40-foot (12-meter) 
hole into the earth, just 10 feet (3 meters) from the information 
office by the ministry gate. The impact of the missiles, which struck 
at 9:45 p.m. (1845 GMT), shattered the windows of the small, one-story 
information office. Three night guards were injured in the blast, 
Iraqi officials said. A third missile shot past the ministry, a large 
complex of several buildings. The ministry is responsible for social 
security, pensions, prisons and benefits for the handicapped. Iraqi 
officials escorted journalists to the area but would not permit them 
to examine the site where the third missile struck.
