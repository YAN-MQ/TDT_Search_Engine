The deepest secrets and innermost thoughts of America's most famous 
atheist are for sale. Madalyn Murray O'Hair, who founded the nation's 
leading atheist group, American Atheists Inc., in the 1960s and vanished 
in 1995, left behind a stack of diaries that will be sold next month 
to satisfy a claim against her estate brought by the IRS. The handwritten 
diaries, more than a thousand pages long, begin in 1953 and end abruptly, 
just seven weeks before Mrs. O'Hair disappeared along with her son 
Jon Garth Murray and granddaughter, Robin Murray-O'Hair. The three 
have not been seen or heard from since Sept. 29, 1995. And despite 
a worldwide search, no substantive clues to their whereabouts have 
been found. Ronald Ingalls, a lawyer and bankruptcy trustee who was 
appointed to oversee the liquidation of Mrs. O'Hair's estate, said 
he had ``no idea'' of the worth of the diaries and other personal 
documents offered for sale, which include Mrs. O'Hair's birth certificate, 
military service record and marriage license. But he said he hoped 
to get enough money to pay a $250,000 claim the IRS has lodged against 
Mrs. O'Hair's estate. Ingalls, who is storing the 2-foot-high stack 
of diaries at a downtown Austin bank, has not set a date for the auction. 
A quick survey of the diaries reveals a woman very much concerned 
with money, power and her waistline. On Jan. 6, 1973, Mrs. O'Hair 
wrote her goals for the new year: ``Begin a Bible chair at U. of Texas. 
Get a mink coat and a Cadillac car. Humiliate Billy Graham, for money.'' 
There are several entries about her weight. On April 23, 1976, she 
wrote: ``I am gaining weight like mad. I don't feel well from it at 
all. Drastic, Madalyn, Drastic.'' From a historical perspective, the 
diaries may be disappointing, because there are no entries from 1959 
to 1972, a period that was perhaps the most intriguing one in Mrs. 
O'Hair's life. In 1960, she filed a lawsuit against the Baltimore 
school district in an effort to remove prayer from public schools. 
In 1963, she was a secondary plaintiff in a case heard by the Supreme 
Court that resulted in a ban on prayer in public schools. That same 
year, Mrs. O'Hair fled to Mexico to evade charges of assaulting Baltimore 
policemen. However, the diaries contain several interesting historical 
passages, including several about Larry Flynt, the publisher of Hustler 
magazine. In 1984, when Flynt was sent to prison for contempt of court, 
Mrs. O'Hair persuaded him to sign a power of attorney that gave her 
control over all his assets, including Hustler. But Mrs. O'Hair's 
gambit was thwarted by Flynt's brother. On March 16, 1984, Mrs. O'Hair 
wrote in her diary: ``I can't believe the perfidy over the Larry Flynt 
deal. The whole gawd-dam world is made up of liars, cheats &AMP; swindlers 
whose single driving force is greed. Everyone sells out. Everyone 
can be bought.'' Gregory Shaw, the vice president in charge of books 
and manuscripts at Butterfield &AMP; Butterfield, a Los Angeles auction 
house, said putting a value on the diaries was difficult because no 
other historical figures could be compared to Mrs. O'Hair. But he 
said he thought the diaries would not be worth more than $100,000. 
Although the diaries may contain clues regarding the disappearance 
of the three atheists, the final entries appear rather pedestrian. 
On Aug. 1, 1995, while on vacation in Virginia with her son and granddaughter, 
Mrs. O'Hair complained about the cost of travel. More than anything, 
the diaries may reveal Mrs. O'Hair's passion for discord. ``What is 
the matter with hating?'' she wrote on Oct. 9, 1956. ``It is treated 
as a leper among the emotions. Why in the hell should we go exuding 
sweetness &AMP; light?''
