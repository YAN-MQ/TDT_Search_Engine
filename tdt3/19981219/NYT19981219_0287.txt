When President Clinton called off the air strikes that had rained 
hundreds of cruise missiles down on Iraq last week, he could claim 
justifiably that he had achieved the goal established on the first 
day of the attack. ``Our objectives were clear,'' he said Saturday 
night in announcing that he had ordered a halt to the air strikes 
after four days. The United States, he said, had sought ``to degrade 
Saddam's weapons of mass destruction program'' and ``his capacity 
to attack his neighbors.'' Again and again over the last week, Clinton 
and his senior aides have said the central goal of the air strikes 
was to ``degrade'' the ability of President Saddam Hussein of Iraq 
to develop chemical and biological weapons. And that mission, the 
president said Saturday, ``is now complete.'' But ``degrade'' can 
mean many things. It is possible to degrade a target heavily. It is 
possible to degrade one slightly. And as senior administration officials 
acknowledge, albeit on condition of anonymity, the aftermath of the 
bombing campaign will be a weakened Iraq, but one still capable within 
months _ and possibly just weeks or days _ of threatening its neighbors 
with an arsenal of chemical, biological and even nuclear weapons. 
U.N. weapons inspectors believe the Iraqis are still hiding tons of 
nerve gas and that they are seeking to obtain uranium from a rogue 
nation or terrorist groups to complete as many as four nuclear warheads. 
The Defense Department insisted that last week's air strikes had set 
back by at least one year Iraq's program to build ballistic missiles 
capable of delivering chemical and biological weapons. But Iraq retains 
a number of mobile missiles capable of hitting targets in Saudi Arabia, 
Kuwait and Israel. ``This is a very limited air campaign,'' said Adm. 
Stanley Arthur, the retired four-star admiral who oversaw all naval 
forces during the 1991 Persian Gulf war, which included weeks of air 
strikes that were several times larger than the combined strikes of 
last week. ``The goals here are fairly modest,'' he said. ``All this 
can do is set back the Iraqis on some sort of time scale. And I would 
guess that you're talking about months.'' Clinton administration officials 
say they are drafting plans for another set of air strikes against 
Iraq early next year, after the end of the Islamic holy month of Ramadan. 
No decision has been made on whether to carry out additional American 
air strikes next year, but the fact that the planners are already 
at work suggests that the Pentagon recognizes the severe limits of 
the air campaign that ended Saturday. ``If we can maintain some degree 
of international consensus about this, I think we'll be going back,'' 
said an administration official who is involved in the planning. Both 
Clinton and Secretary of Defense William Cohen made clear Saturday 
that they would still like to see U.N. weapons inspections resume 
and that they will continue to rely on the punishing economic sanctions 
that have done as much as any missile to ``contain'' Iraq. And Clinton 
again indicated that the best way to solve the problem ``is for Iraq 
to have a different government.'' In this military strike, the weapon 
of choice was the cruise missile. And the limitations of the missile 
could be seen as a metaphor for the administration's limited goals. 
While the ground-hugging missiles are more likely to hit their targets 
than traditional free-falling bombs, they sometimes miss, they pack 
less of a punch than many types of so-called dumb bombs, and they 
are expensive, about $1 million each. The Pentagon has acknowledged 
using at least 290 of them in the air strikes last week, meaning that 
U.S. taxpayers are already out a quarter of a billion dollars, just 
for cruise missiles. The reliance on these weapons over traditional 
bombing _ in which pilots take the risk of flying close to their targets 
and dropping more powerful explosives _ was a virtual acknowledgement 
by the administration of the modesty of its goals. ``Cruise missiles 
are great at the start when you want that element of surprise and 
pinpoint accuracy,'' Arthur said. ``But they are not hard-target destroyers. 
For that, you need to get the fixed-wing assets in there, with more 
penetrating weapons and with some of the bigger warheads.'' ``But 
if the target is worth getting, you're going to have to take that 
risk at some point,'' he added. ``If you're not going to take that 
risk, the results will always be limited.''
