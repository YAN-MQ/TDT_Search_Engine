On "World News Tonight" this Saturday -- Article one is approved. 
For the second time in our history, the House of Representatives impeaches 
the president. The president reacts, saying, he'll stay focused on 
his job. It's what I've tried to do for six years. For six years. 
It's what I intend to do for two more until the last hour more until 
the last hour of the last day of my term. And it is not the day's 
only drama. And it is not the day's only drama. I will not stand for 
speaker of the house. The incoming speaker of the house announces 
he will resign. We'll have the story from Capitol Hill and around 
the co the country. Good evening. I'm Charles Gibson.
