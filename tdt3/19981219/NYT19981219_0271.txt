Many Americans voiced anger, disgust and frustration with the proceedings. 
Some radiated grim satisfaction. But as President Clinton's long, 
painful journey from scandal to impeachment ended Saturday, most Americans 
were just benumbed, inoculated by the seemingly endless months of 
lies, legalisms and disillusionment with politics, Washington-style. 
As the House cast the fateful votes to send perjury and other charges 
against Clinton to the Senate for trial, countless Americans paid 
scant attention, opting for football on television or Christmas shopping, 
a reflection of polls that had shown that the people overwhelmingly 
opposed an impeachment that was a foregone conclusion and were sick 
of the whole mess. Still, there was great drama in the day _ the bombs 
falling in Iraq, the stunning announcement that Rep. Robert Livingston, 
R-La., would not serve as speaker and would resign from the House 
after admitting adulterous affairs, and the realization by many that 
the impeachment of a president had happened only once before, 130 
years ago. And around the nation, Americans paused in homes, restaurants 
and shopping malls decked out for Christmas to watch the televised 
spectacle. Some endorsed the Republican-dominated vote to impeach, 
insisting that even a president was not above the law, and that impeachment 
was necessary for moral accountability. Others called on the president 
to resign and spare the nation months of agony. But in interviews 
in New York, Seattle, Boston, Los Angeles, Chicago, Miami, Houston 
and other cities, most people, while deploring Clinton's behavior 
in trying to cover up his affair with Monica Lewinsky, said they opposed 
impeachment, calling it excessive punishment and perhaps harmful to 
the nation. ``It strikes me as dangerous,'' Greg Noonan, a first-year 
law student at Harvard, said as the impeachment vote flashed on a 
television screen at the Three Aces, a restaurant in Cambridge, Mass. 
``And most infuriatingly of all, it strikes me as completely ignoring 
the will of the American people.'' In Seattle, several people working 
out at the Olympic Athletic Club shook their heads in disgust as the 
vote unfolded on overhead screens. ``I'm very, very saddened and I'm 
very, very angry,'' said Ross Carey, a doctor, who said the Republicans 
had ``put politics ahead of what is best for the country.'' Bob and 
Carol Wentink, a Chicago couple, said impeachment seemed excessive 
for what the president did. ``It's a shame,'' Wentink, 54, an electronics 
designer, said. ``I think there's too much interest in private lives. 
While he did wrong, I don't think he deserves to be impeached.'' His 
wife, a retired teacher, added: ``I think it's a huge mistake. It's 
going to affect the way people around the world look at us.'' Evan 
Ackerman, 28, a financial consultant in Miami, also called impeachment 
inappropriate. ``But that doesn't necessarily mean I like Clinton,'' 
he added. ``Even if he is a sleazebag, they should wait until he leaves 
office. He should be scolded, sued for millions of dollars, reprimanded.'' 
Greater forgiveness was to be found at the Hair Place, a beauty salon 
in the New York City borough of Queens. ``So he lied under oath,'' 
said Diane Barnett, 41, an office manager who lives in Roosevelt, 
L.I. ``That's a petty issue. Everybody lies. It's like his wife said: 
There are so many other issues, like hunger and health care, to be 
concerned about.'' Paul Trageser, 62, a silversmith from Cincinnati, 
said the impeachment had been motivated by pure politics. ``It's partisan, 
it's unfair, it's a witch hunt,'' he said in Los Angeles, where he 
was visiting. ``I'm sick of what the Republicans have done over the 
past few years _ so squeaky clean and hypocritical. It's sad and bizarre.'' 
Around the country, however, there were many who approved of impeachment. 
``Hooray,'' yelled Ann Jewel, who heard the news as she wheeled a 
cart full of grocery bags across the parking lot in Chicago. A 57-year-old 
receptionist for an insurance company and the mother of five children, 
Ms. Jewel said she had voted twice for Clinton, but had come to believe 
that he betrayed the country and was not sincere in his many apologies. 
``He put his hand on the Bible and lied,'' she said. ``A lot of things 
can be forgiven, but to be forgiven a person has to be sorry. He cannot 
be forgiven just because he is caught.'' In Houston, Monika Miura, 
48, a legal librarian, said Clinton, like any citizen, had to be called 
to account for lying under oath. ``If anyone needs to be above reproach 
and needs to be an honorable individual, it should be the president,'' 
she said. ``This is not an issue about sex. This is an issue about 
honor and truthfulness.'' Gertrude Jackson, 75, a retired Chicago 
department store cashier, also said she favored impeachment, and that 
it was not about sex. ``Everybody knew when he was elected that he 
was a woman-chaser,'' she said. ``He just got too big for his britches. 
He broke the law. He should be punished.'' In Denver, John Harless, 
a 53-year-old retired banker, said Clinton had no one to blame but 
himself. ``It's a somber moment, and I'm not happy about it,'' Harless 
said. ``He did some good things. It's too bad he recklessly endangered 
the office of the president. He ruined his own presidency.'' At the 
Market coffee shop in Denver, Cherish Finn spoke of Clinton in the 
past tense, as if he was already gone, though the outcome of his trial 
in the senate remains in doubt. ``I think he was a good leader,'' 
Ms. Finn said. ``This has been a good time in our country. We had 
a great four years with him, and he had the potential to do something 
with this country. He should have been honest. This society is based 
on forgiveness, and he made a mockery of the system by lying.'' Hardly 
anyone defended Clinton, but many expressed concern over the possible 
effects of his impeachment _ on the economy, on the stability of government, 
on the conduct of foreign affairs and on the future of the nation. 
``This is dog eat dog now _ not `of the people, for the people,''' 
said Vic Lysell, 50, a paint salesman who had stopped for breakfast 
at Johnny's diner in Seattle's waterfront Ballard neighborhood. ``This 
is not our system at work, it's the GOP at work. It's crazy.'' Ed 
Wetzel, sitting nearby, needed a jolt of coffee to digest the news. 
He said he opposed impeachment, but added that now that it was a fact, 
Clinton should ``strongly consider'' resignation. ``This thing would 
be the focus of the whole next year,'' he said. ``The entire country 
would suffer for it.'' The owner of Johnny's, John Khalil, disagreed. 
Referring to Republicans, he said: ``They are pushing hard to destroy 
this man any way they can, and it's wrong. Now the president needs 
to battle back.'' For many Americans, impeachment was just another 
occasion to condemn Clinton. ``What the president did was shameful, 
and I think he has to pay the price,'' said Al Habib, 54, a Brooklyn 
pharmacist. ``He's a very bad role model for the younger generation. 
The right thing to do is remove him from office.'' But others denounced 
the forces arrayed against him. ``The whole thing stinks,'' said Susan 
Macina, 35, who lives in Brooklyn and Hollywood, Fla. ``What the president 
did was terrible, but not impeachable. It's an offense in his personal 
life. We elected him twice without knowing about his affairs. I think 
there are going to be mass protests in this country.'' But there was 
little sign of protest Saturday. Indeed, tours of shops, cafes and 
other public places in a half-dozen cities found many people ignoring 
the telecast from Capitol Hill. Kevin James, 29, working at a juice 
bar in Seattle, said he was more concerned with Christmas shopping 
and finding a new apartment. ``It's simply not on my important list 
now,'' he said of the impeachment. Cindy Carlson, a 45-year-old college 
English professor in Denver, called the impeachment historic, but 
not comparable to the Watergate proceedings that led to the resignation 
of President Nixon. ``I cried during Watergate,'' she said. ``I felt 
the American way of life was threatened. Now I think it's different. 
The country will survive this.''
