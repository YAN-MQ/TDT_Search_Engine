From Atlanta, this is "CNN Headline News." I'm David Goodnow. Words 
are flying on Capitol Hill, and bombs are bursting in Baghdad. Early 
Saturday in Iraq's capital city, U.S. and British military forces 
let loose a third wave of cruise missiles. About the same time in 
Washington, a divided House of Representatives closed the door on 
12 hours of historic debate for and against impeachment. A CNN head 
count shows at least one article of impeachment is all but certain 
to pass Saturday, when lawmakers could begin voting. During the hours 
of heated debate, republicans maintained President Clinton violated 
his "solemn oath" with lies. Democrats argued waging an impeachment 
battle while U.S. troops are fighting in the Persian gulf is inappropriate. 
The president will continue to lead after this is over. The charges 
don't carry enough substance to go into any long trial at the senate. 
We will survive, and the president will continue to lead. And the 
American people would support him. I might say it's probably the end 
of the republican party as we know it. If the president of the United 
States simply committed adultery, then that indeed is a matter that 
should be reserved to his family. If, on the other hand, the president 
of the United States committed perjury or illegal acts, then that 
matter must necessarily be reserved to this congress. I agree that 
the private failings of a public man deserve neither debate nor reprimand 
from this body. And yet, public misconduct by that same official deserves 
punishment of the fullest measure.
