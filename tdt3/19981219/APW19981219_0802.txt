Pelting stones, burning flags and even breaking into a U.S. ambassador's 
home, protesters across the Arab world joined Saturday in a bitter 
wave of anger over the airstrikes on Iraq. A common theme of the protests 
was that all Arabs _ not just Iraqi leader Saddam Hussein _ are being 
targeted by the U.S. and British attacks. ``The aggression on Iraq 
is an aggression on the whole Arab nation,'' said Aziza Fadhel, a 
university student in the Syrian capital, Damascus, where protesters 
broke into and damaged the U.S. ambassador's residence. That was exactly 
the idea U.S. President Bill Clinton was trying to fight in a message 
offered for broadcast in Arab countries. Saddam ``threatens Muslims 
and non-Muslims alike,'' Clinton said in the videotaped message. ``We 
had to act.'' But there was little empathy with that position. Egyptian 
President Hosni Mubarak, a key Arab ally during the Gulf War, sent 
a message to Clinton urging him to halt the attacks that began Thursday, 
Egypt's Middle East News Agency reported. The United Arab Emirates' 
minister of defense criticized the strikes for taking place during 
the Islamic fasting month. ``I have mixed feelings of sadness and 
anger for seeing strikes against Iraq these days as we welcome the 
holy month of Ramadan,'' Sheik Mohammed bin Rashid Al-Maktoum said 
in a statement carried by the official WAM news agency. In a rare 
protest in the Syrian capital, thousands marched through downtown 
Damascus Saturday, and about 1,000 people _ most of them students 
_ attacked the U.S. Embassy, its nearby residence and the American 
Cultural Center. Rioters also threw stones at the British Embassy 
in Damascus and broke into the British Council, where they damaged 
furniture and scattered library books. At the U.S. residence, more 
than 100 people climbed over the wall, broke down the front door and 
stormed inside, destroying everything in their path _ furniture, windows, 
the ambassador's private office. They knocked books on the floor, 
and destroyed kitchen cabinets and bookcases. They also attacked the 
car of Ambassador Ryan Crocker, shattering the lights and windows. 
Crocker's wife, Christine, was in the house at the time but was not 
hurt. At the embassy, U.S. Marine guards fired tear gas from the roof 
to disperse the stone-throwing crowd. Three protesters managed to 
enter the compound, climb the walls and haul down and burn the American 
flag. Syrian security forces dispersed the mobs after about six hours. 
In New York, a U.S. State Department official, speaking on condition 
of anonymity, said the United States was ``deeply concerned'' about 
Syria's failure to protect the ambassador's residence. ``The ambassador 
has waged a very strong protest with the government of the Syria Arab 
Republic,'' the official said. ``We have protested in the strongest 
possible terms to the Syrian ambassador in Washington, D.C., as well.''
