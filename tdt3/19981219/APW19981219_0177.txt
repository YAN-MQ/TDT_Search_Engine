Li Xiaoyong scored 24 points Saturday, leading a well-diciplined Chinese 
team to a 112-92 victory over South Korea for the men's basketball 
gold medal at the Asian Games. China's fourth consecutive Asian Games 
basketball triumph was a tame affair after the Philippines' dramatic 
bronze medal victory earlier in the day. Isabelo Lastimosa scored 
the last 10 points as the Philippines came from one point down with 
1:15 to play and beat Kazakstan 73-68. Li scored four 3-pointers and 
went 8-for-8 from the foul line for his 24, and Zhang Jinsong added 
22 for the Chinese, who led 59-43 at halftime. The team sank 7 of 
10 3-point attempts in the first half, while Korea went 2-for-6. The 
taller Chinese controlled the pace and the area under the basket, 
forcing the Koreans to shoot more from outside. China hit 21 of 33 
from the field, or 63 percent, to Korea's 56 percent on 17 for 30. 
It also outrebounded the Koreans 26-15. Seo Jan-hoon led Korea's scoring 
with 20, including 8 for 16 from the field. ``China was a bit messy 
in the second half, but that is quite normal,'' said Chinese coach 
Wang Fei. ``We could be because of the lead.'' Against the Philippines, 
Kazakstan led 68-67 before Lastimosa put the game away with two free 
shots, a field goal, and two more free throws. He ended with 19 points. 
Trying to get back on top Asian basketball, the Philippines sent a 
team of its top pros, but they lost to China in the semifinals. Still, 
the bronze medal finish improved on the last games in 1994, when the 
Filipinos lost the bronze medal game to Japan. Kazakstan scored early 
on 3-point shots against the flashier Filipinos, and the two were 
tied 36-36 at halftime. Early in the second half, Kazakstan was able 
to break inside for layups, but the Philippines tightened its defense. 
Mikhail Dedov led Kazakstan's scoring with 15. ``It's been a wonderful 
job,'' said Tim Cone, the Philippines' coach. ``It's different for 
us than it is for anyone else. ... We only have one shot at it, while 
these other teams go back and play for the ABC (Asian Basketball Confederation). 
We don't get that,'' he said. The Philippine team of players from 
its professional league was put together in February to prepare for 
these games. ``It's hard to face those guys (players) now,'' Cone 
said. ``It's hard to tell those guys it's all over. It's time to part 
and go back and play for our own teams. ``Today's game wasn't for 
the players. ... It was for the people back home.'' Lastimosa said, 
``Definitely it's a hard game. It's a team you can't take lightly. 
Emotionally we were down. We weren't ready in the games before against 
Korea and China.'' The Philippines was Asia's basketball power before 
it launched its own professional league in 1975. Since then it had 
been sending top amateurs to foreign competitions, an approach that 
didn't win medals.
