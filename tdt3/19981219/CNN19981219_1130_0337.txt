before today's debate, first lady hillary rodham clinton visited with 
the democratic caucus. she thanked them for their support of the president 
and called the current impeachment process unfair. i don't think that 
she is here to change anybody's mind, and it's not a question of coming 
late. overwhelmingly the democratic caucus, first of all, we feel 
that this has been an unfair process from the very beginning. this 
has been a partisan process. you cannot impeach a president on partisan 
lines. we are watering down the constitution. we are reducing the 
standard of impeachment. and in doing so, we are creating some very 
dangerous precedents for the country.
