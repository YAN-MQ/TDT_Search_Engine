The star of the latest action against Iraq has been the cruise missile 
-- both the sea-launched version and the model fired from airplanes. 
The main advantage of these weapons is that they allow the U.S. military 
to hit targets without risking the lives of air crews. But the weapons 
have their problems. They're expensive -- on average, $1 million a 
missile. And they're not as accurate as laser-guided bombs. And since 
the military's fired more cruise missiles in this conflict than it 
did in the entire gulf war, stockpiles of the weapon are running short.
