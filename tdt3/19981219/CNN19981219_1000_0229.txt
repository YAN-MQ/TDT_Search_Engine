If the House of Representatives approves impeachment, President Clinton's 
trial will move onto the Senate next year. A two-thirds majority vote 
would be needed to remove the president from office. When the trial 
begins, Senate members can end the proceedings at any time, with a 
simple majority vote. That would be the best time for the president 
to work out an alternative deal for censure.
