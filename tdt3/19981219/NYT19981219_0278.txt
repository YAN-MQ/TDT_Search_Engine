On Tuesday nights, after people in this moneyed town have finished 
dinner, Tonya White, a fourth-generation Greenwich resident, bundles 
her toddler into her car and, with her 58-year-old mother, goes hunting 
for junk. As the boy nods off, mother and daughter cruise the lanes 
of nearby communities like Rye, N.Y., and Port Chester, N.Y., and 
rummage with flashlights through homeowners' trash, sifting out old 
lamps, dolls, pots, quilts, anything thrown away as clutter or too 
much trouble to repair. On weekday afternoons, mother and daughter 
take another tack, visiting the town dump here and poking through 
mounds of wood, metal and trash for goods whose value has gone unrecognized. 
What they harvest they haul into consignment shops, which pay them 
70 percent of sales. ``I found a very nice Pentax,'' Ms. White said. 
``Wide-angle lens. Digital. The only thing was the shutter was stuck. 
All I had to do was stick my finger inside. I put some batteries in, 
some film. Bang, it worked.'' She knows a dozen for-profit scavengers 
like herself, including those who do it just because they cannot resist 
the instinct to get something for nothing. ``There's so many people 
looking through garbage, it's hard to find anything good,'' she said. 
``People in Mercedes-Benzes. They have lots of money and they're still 
trying to find that Rembrandt in the garbage.'' Junking, as it's called, 
is the way Ms. White and her mother make their living, the kind of 
occupation most Americans do not associate with Greenwich but one 
that says something about wealthy towns' scruffier, less visible corners, 
where weather-beaten clapboard houses are scattered among the factories 
and the lawns are handkerchief size. People who resort to such makeshift 
enterprises have watched the wealth mushroom around them and pass 
them by. Maybe they blame bad luck or personal troubles. But they 
seem to have adopted the philosophy that if they cannot live as well 
as the rich, they might as well live off them. Along the way, they 
help remind us of the extravagance in increasingly affluent America, 
where toys languish unopened in closets and perfectly fine refrigerators 
are discarded to make way for trendy Sub-Zeros. Greenwich is self-conscious 
about this waste. The town officially prohibits scavenging at the 
dump (although officials seem to overlook regulars like the Whites), 
and it includes a Salvation Army drop-off bin and a free book exchange 
that could stock a small-town library. However, as Ms. White says, 
there is no getting around the indulgence. ``People have a fantastic 
need to consume,'' she said, talking rapidly between drags of a cigarette. 
``They can't get enough. They have to have more gold necklaces and 
more shoes when there are people out there who have absolutely nothing.'' 
Ms. White, a slight 24-year-old who also happens to be a skillful, 
sensitive painter, thinks of herself as ``rescuing things that shouldn't 
be thrown out in the first place.'' ``I don't see any shame in doing 
it,'' she said. ``I'm not prostituting my body. I'm not lying or cheating 
my way to the top. I'm making an honest living.'' It is not difficult 
to understand how Ms. White wound up in her line of work. She is the 
great-granddaughter of an Italian immigrant who settled in Greenwich's 
more blue-collar Byram section. Her father abandoned the family when 
she was 18 and her mother went into the junk work her own father had 
done. Three years ago, Ms. White had a baby with a man who also absconded, 
so she went on welfare and joined her mother in junking. They say 
the work can earn $200 a month or more, but it is not easy. ``When 
it snows, everything looks the same,'' she said. ``You don't know 
what you're looking at, and it's freezing and raining.'' One thing 
that rankles her is when people are offended by her activities, like 
the woman who caught her scavenging and icily said, ``Please leave.'' 
``We've become so callous,'' Ms. White said. ``You see a bum on the 
street and immediately you think, `Why don't they go to work?' But 
you don't know what they went through. They can't find a place to 
take a shower or they can't get the clean clothes to get to the job. 
I think they want poor people to die.''
