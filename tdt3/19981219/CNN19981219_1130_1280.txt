now back to the afc -- if the patriots make the postseason, they'll 
have to do it without drew bledsoe. we knew he couldn't play tomorrow 
against san fran. scott zolak gets the start. well, now bledsoe is 
questionable for the finale against the jets. the pats can clinch 
a playoff spot with a win sunday and a tennessee loss to green bay. 
you know, it got to be a situation where i was doing more damage to 
the finger playing. and, you know, had some soft tissue damage from 
the pins and the bones were moving around. and it just wasn't healing 
correctly. so the combination of those two reasons, you know, it's 
time to sit down for at least for a week, and then we'll see.
