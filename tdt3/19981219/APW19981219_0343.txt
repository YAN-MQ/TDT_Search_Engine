A weekly ferry service from Dubai to the southern Iraqi port of Umm 
al-Qasr was suspended Saturday because of the U.S. and British airstrikes 
on Iraq. Mohammed Hamdan al-Shamsi, manager of Naif Marine Services, 
said the ferry _ the first direct link between the Gulf and its sanctions-hit 
neighbor since the 1990 Gulf crisis _ was ``stopped due to the conditions.'' 
He said the decision was taken Saturday morning despite bookings by 
about 60 passengers. ``We didn't launch ... because we were unable 
to contact our agent in Umm al-Qasr by phone or telex,'' he said. 
``Apparently their lines are down.'' There have been reports from 
southern Iraq of difficult communications problems, suggesting that 
the U.S. and British attacks may have damaged telephone facilities. 
The ferry service will restart as soon as it gets a go-ahead from 
the Umm al-Qasr agent, al-Shamsi said. The service, which started 
Nov. 7, caters mainly to businessmen and Shiite Muslim pilgrims headed 
to shrines in southern Iraq. It leaves Dubai on Saturday and makes 
the return trip on Monday. The only other option for traveling to 
Iraq is a 10-hour road trip from the Jordanian capital Amman.
