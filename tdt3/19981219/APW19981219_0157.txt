AMMAN, Jordan (AP) _ U.N. aid workers who reluctantly left Iraq said 
Saturday the airstrikes will only deepen the suffering of Iraqis and 
reverse economic progress made in recent years. ``This is a very, 
very unfortunate situation for the Iraqis,'' said Darleen Biseau, 
who worked on the U.N.-approved oil-for-food program in Baghdad. The 
program is an exception from the punishing trade sanctions imposed 
by the U.N. Security Council after Iraq's 1990 invasion of Kuwait. 
It allows Iraq to sell limited quantities of oil to buy needed food 
and medicine for its 22 million people. One of 110 U.N. humanitarian 
workers who left Iraq Friday morning, Biseau was exhausted and tearful 
as she described the 15-hour trip through the desert to the Jordanian 
capital Amman. ``It's a trip we made with tears for all those people 
we left there,'' she said in a wavering voice. ``There is nothing 
really happy for us about being here at all. ``I think the cumulative 
effect of many years of suffering is simply not going to be helped 
by this, and I don't have the words to describe how bad the effect 
of this airstrike is on Iraq.'' Victor Algus, of the U.N. Habitat 
program, said he hoped the U.S. and British strikes would not have 
a long-term impact on their work. ``We are in the humanitarian business, 
and it is needed in Iraq,'' Algus said. ``The Iraqis are suffering 
and we have to help them.'' Most of the other U.N. aid workers refused 
to talk to reporters. The workers were evacuated after spending the 
first night of U.S. and British military strikes huddled in their 
headquarters on the outskirts of Baghdad. Prakash Shah, the special 
envoy of U.N. Secretary-General Kofi Annan, and the U.N. humanitarian 
coordinator, Hans von Sponeck, remain in Baghdad along with 26 U.N. 
workers, U.N. officials said. The United Nations has said it remains 
fully committed to implementation of the oil-for-food program and 
hopes the relocated workers will soon resume their duties in Iraq.
