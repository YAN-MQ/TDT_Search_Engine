Croatian President Franjo Tudjman said Saturday that while Croatia 
is eager to join the West, it would not accept to be treated as a 
``colony.'' Tudjman, who spoke to reporters upon his return from his 
first official visit to Russia, said Croatia still wanted to be admitted 
to Western institutions, but would not accept ``imposed solutions,'' 
which are against the national interests. ``We are under the surveillance 
as rarely any other country,'' Tudjman said, listing international 
diplomats and humanitarian agencies based in Croatia that he said 
``monitor and report'' the situation in the country. Earlier this 
week, he charged that the work of U.S. and European officials based 
in Croatia, as well as humanitarian agencies and media has been aimed 
at destabilizing the country. His remarks indicated an increased dislike 
towards the Western governments, whose support and alliance he desired 
for long. Nevertheless, Tudjman's government has often complained 
that constant criticism from the United States and its allies, who 
insist Croatia improve its treatment of Serbs, fully respect neighboring 
Bosnia's borders and improve its democracy record before it will be 
considered for admission to the European Union or NATO's Partnership 
for Peace program, are the equivalent to interfering with the country's 
internal affairs. Calling Russia a world superpower despite its current 
crisis, Tudjman showed fresh praise for the Christian Orthodox country 
that sided with rebel Serbs during the 1991 war of independence from 
the former Yugoslavia. The move was seen by some here as a search 
for the new allies. Still, the Croatian president argued that his 
visit to Russia, which coincided with a serious rift between Washington 
and Moscow over the air strikes on Iraq, did not mean Croatia had 
``turned its back'' on the United States. He said it is in Croatia's 
``strategic interest'' to have ``partnership and friendly relations'' 
with Washington. Croatia is also seeking good relations with Europe. 
On Friday, Tudjman and Yeltsin signed a declaration on friendship 
and cooperation, while their associates signed several other agreements, 
including the one on arms trade and defense cooperation.
