One more time, Sam, to use the word surreal. We're joined by cokie 
Roberts and Jackie Judd. Cokie, do we get to trial? The trial is likely 
to come, yes, Charlie. You know the institution of Congress well and 
you know some of its players insist on the prerogatives of the institutions. 
In the Senate that would include senator Robert Byrd of West Virginia, 
the historian of the Senate, who will insist that the Senate go forward 
at least for a while. Obviously, the pressure will now be on to try 
to bring that to a short conclusion, but the pressure was on the house 
as well. And an election intervene Ed, and the house impeached the 
president. You said earlier in the broadcast this would have repercussions 
for the presidency and House of Representatives. I think that will 
be the case. Jackie, when you first learned of the story back in January, 
did you ever think we would get to this day? Oh, my gosh, no. The 
one constant to the story has been its utter unpredictability. Even 
though over the past few days, everyone widely expected these articles 
of impeachment to pass. Sitting here was still a shock. It was just 
a shock to hear the speaker pro tem in the house floor announce that 
the first article of impeachment had passed. So no, I don't think 
anyone could have predict weed would find ourselves here on this night 
talking about what we are. Sam, finld word. Do you think they at the 
White House really feel this presidency is in jeopardy? Yes they think 
it's very much in jeopardy. They are smart down here, Charlie. They 
understand each time you take a step, you have to recalculate the 
next step. They know they can't count on not having 67 votes against 
the president in the Senate. That's why they want, they must have, 
they believe, this censure deal. All right, Sam Donaldson, Jackie 
Judd, cokie Roberts, thank you very much.
