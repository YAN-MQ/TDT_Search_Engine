The federal government has established new rules allowing more people 
to join credit unions. The credit union industry calls it a "Christmas 
present for consumers," while the banking industry sees it as a lump 
of coal. The rules let federally chartered credit unions continue 
to include more than one occupational group in their memberships as 
long as each group doesn't exceed 3,000 people.
