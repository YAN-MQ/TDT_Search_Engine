And we have this just in. President William Jefferson Clinton has 
become the first president in 130 years to be impeached. The House 
of Representatives, as you see, 219 have voted yea in adopting the 
first amendment. The first article, the first of four. The one of 
lying to a grand jury in August. They are now going to vote on the 
others. Lying in the Paula Jones sexual harassment suit, obstructing 
justice and abuse of power. This will probably be the biggest lop-sided 
vote of all. It's not even as close as many had thought. it's 222 
to 203. This debate began passionate as it was about 9:00 this morning, 
having concluded last night about 10:00. They voted -- they debated 
for a couple hours and then speaker elect Bob livingston rose to say 
that he was resigning. He had admitted only a couple days ago to a 
few extramarital affairs and he said it was in the best interest of 
the country and to set the right example in this debate for him to 
step aside. He will not be the speaker of the house. In kt fa, he 
won't be a congressman in six months. But Clinton spokesman Joe Lockhart 
said the president likes Livingston, hoped to work with him in the 
coming 106th Congress and asked Livingston to reconsider. Then after 
that we had the motion, the democrats to recommit the impeachment 
articles. That would allow them to offer a censure resolution. But 
that got nowhere. They walked out in protest. Then they filed back 
in slowly and this vote is being taken, by the way, electronically 
for reasons not entirely clear. The chair has decided not to have 
everyone stand and give their yeas and nays. There is one independent, 
Bernie Sanders of Vermont, who voted against impeachment. The vote 
now 227 to 205. 228 now. First president in 130 years. Andrew Johnson 
was the -- the time is gone. This motion has been approved. The first 
article of impeachment against President Clinton has been approved. 
What's next of course is the second article. It may not stand quite 
the same chance. Lying in the Paula Jones sexual harassment suit. 
This would be the president's deposition on January 17th followed 
by two more articles of impeachment, then it's up to the Senate. This 
thing could take five months, it could be settled in sort of a plea 
bargain. That's the latest. The president stands peach preponderance 
of the evidence
