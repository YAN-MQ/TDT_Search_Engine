The latest American attack on Iraq has divided this city, which has 
the nation's largest concentration of Arab-Americans, for while Saddam 
Hussein is almost universally loathed, opinions differ on whether 
renewed air strikes will do any good. At the Baghdadi Restaurant here 
in Detroit's western suburbs, the mere mention of the American raids 
draws the owner and a handful of customers into an angry discussion. 
Even though all of them fled southern Iraq after Saddam, the country's 
president, suppressed a rebellion at the end of the Persian Gulf War 
in 1991, none have anything good to say about the American attack 
and all are convinced that Iraqi civilians will suffer more than their 
leaders. ``Just about every Iraqi knows that this operation is directed 
toward the Iraqi people,'' said Mohammed Al-Alawi, a retired transportation 
company manager. ``The infrastructure being destroyed, the hospitals 
being destroyed, does not hurt Saddam, it hurts the Iraqi people.'' 
But at the Cedarland Restaurant, a popular Lebanese-American gathering 
place a few blocks away, opinions of the attack were more favorable. 
``It's a good idea,'' said Sam Sobh, the restaurant's owner, adding 
that while he worried about the suffering of the Iraqi people, he 
was also concerned about reports of Iraq's weapons programs. Whenever 
the United States bombs Iraq, many Arab-Americans find themselves 
asked for their reactions. But the nation's Arab-American population 
is far from monolithic. James Zogby, the president of the Arab American 
Institute, said noted the differences of opinion, but said that a 
consensus still existed among Arab-Americans on some issues. There 
is a consensus that Saddam should be removed, and yet general agreement 
too that economic sanctions are ineffective and cause excessive hardship 
for the Iraqi people, he said. On military action, he acknowledged, 
``There is a range of opinion, there's no doubt about it.'' Still, 
Zogby insisted that ``a majority view would not support the bombing.'' 
That is particularly true here in Dearborn, where auto factory jobs 
began attracting Arab immigrants in the 1920s. Further waves of immigrants 
have been lured by the hundreds of businesses in the city with Arabic 
signs and Arabic-speaking staffs. Thousands of Iraqis have fled to 
the Detroit area since the end of the Gulf War, joining an already 
large Iraqi-American population. But while sentiment among them is 
vehemently critical of Saddam, there has been little support for another 
round of American air strikes. An Iraqi-American gas station owner 
paused while buying baklava at a pastry shop here to express his dismay. 
``This conflict against Saddam, it is hurting the people, not Saddam,'' 
he said, insisting on anonymity because he still has relatives in 
Iraq. ``Saddam is hard to catch, it's hard to find Saddam. Will America 
go after him house to house? It's a loser.'' The Iraqi-Americans at 
the Baghdadi Restaurant, a 40-seat diner nearby with a large, open 
grill, were also upset that the American strategy seemed to be aimed 
more at destroying Iraqi weapons of mass destruction than at removing 
Saddam from power. The strong sentiment was that President Clinton 
was less interested in bringing democracy to Iraq than in avoiding 
impeachment, and was risking the lives of Iraqi civilians in the process. 
Casey Mahb, the restaurant's owner, expressed the common suspicion 
that the United States could use satellite reconnaissance to find 
Saddam and could figure out a way to remove him, but chose not to 
do so. ``If they want to get rid of Saddam Hussein, they can do it 
in two hours,'' Mahb insisted. ``Whenever they want to keep the news 
busy, away from their problems, they take Saddam off the shelf.'' 
This city's large population of Lebanese-Americans, many of whose 
families have been here for several generations, have been a little 
more willing to accept military action. But many are also worried 
that Arab lives could be lost while Saddam might escape unscathed. 
``If you bomb the city, you're not going to kill him because he's 
in hiding,'' said Mark Shiblaq, an automotive purchasing manager, 
as he paid for his shish kebab at the Cedarland Restaurant. ``I have 
a real problem with smart bombs that are not so smart.''
