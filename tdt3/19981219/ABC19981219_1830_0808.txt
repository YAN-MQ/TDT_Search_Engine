And it is this man, Dennis Hastert of Illinois, who I dare say, you 
haven't heard of before or seen before, who is emerging as the front-runner 
to become the next speaker. ABC's Linda Douglass back with us. Who 
is this man? I'm chuckling at the picture because the word rumpled 
has come up all day long. Rumpled, charmed, low key, Con sill ya tore 
try, someone who can get along with moderates and republicans. The 
man who put the health care package together for the house republicans, 
well liked by all sides. Looks like he's got it. Thank you very much, 
Linda Douglass.
