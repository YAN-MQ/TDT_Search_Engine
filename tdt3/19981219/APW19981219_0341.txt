Jean-Luc Cretier, the Olympic downhill champion, tore knee ligaments 
following a season-ending spill during Saturday's World Cup downhill 
race in Val Gardena. Mauro Cornaz, coach of the French downhill team, 
said Cretier torn the cruciate ligament of his left knee and bruises 
in his face and hands following the high-speed fall on an icy course. 
Cornzas said it was a season-ending injury, also putting at risk the 
ski career of the 33-year-old ace from Bourg St. Maurice. Cretier, 
who had won the Olympic title at Nagano this year, fell shortly after 
the start, at a steep, icy section. Cretier, coming down the No. 6 
bib, skidded through an unfenced area and fell over a ridge of grass 
and snow. He was quickly treated by race stewards and doctors at the 
scene of the accident and was later taken by helicopter to the nearby 
hospital of Bressanone (Brixen). Saturday's downhill was the second 
of consecutive World Cup speed races in this north Italian valley. 
Cretier had placed 25th on Friday. The icy, Saslong course proved 
extremely dangerous this weekend, with bad spills marring both days 
of competition. American Ehlias Louis and Frenchman David Pretot tore 
knee ligaments in spills during Friday's downhill. Canadian Ed Podivinsky 
also suffered a season-ending knee injury during Weddnesday's practice 
here.
