World Cup overall leader Alexandra Meissnitzer of Austria widened 
the scope of her supremacy on Saturday, winning her first career World 
Cup downhill. ``It was a big dream of mine to win in the downhill 
because I compete in three disciplines and had never won in the downhill,'' 
said Meissnitzer, who has also won two super-Gs and a pair of giant 
slaloms this season. ``For me it was a big goal as I am not a real 
downhiller and it's not so easy. You need a special feeling.'' Meissnitzer, 
who has won 5-of-12 races this season, stormed down the icy, bumpy 
2,500-meter (8,202-foot) Piste de l'Ours in 1 minute, 42.68 seconds. 
``At the top today I didn't do anything differently than yesterday,'' 
said Meissnitzer, who finished fourth in Friday's downhill. ``But 
at the bottom I pushed more. Yesterday I was too passive.'' The Austrian 
was the only skier to break 42 seconds, with runner-up Regine Cavagnoud 
of France crossing in 1:43. Cavagnoud, who is having her best season 
since 1993, finished ahead of World Cup downhill leader Renate Goetschl 
of Austria, third in 1:43.17. For Goetschl, the winner of the season-opening 
back-to-back downhills in Lake Louise, Canada, the third place finish 
was little consolation. A favorite coming into this weekend's double 
header, Goetschl appeared headed for a third consecutive win when 
a near fall in Friday's race left the Austrian back in 14th. With 
the third place, Goetschl managed to cling to her lead in the World 
Cup downhill standings where she sits with 278 points. Her lead is 
shaky, however, with Meissnitzer quickly gaining ground and currently 
just 23 points behind in second. With five victories and two other 
podium finishes, Meissnitzer has rocketed to the top of the overall 
standings, rapidly pulling away from her closest challengers. The 
Austrian leads with 775 points, a whopping 353 ahead of second place 
Goetschl. Germany's Martina Ertl, who finished 15th, dropped to third 
from second with 416. But while her lead appears solid, the 25-year-old 
Austrian is adamant that the overall title does not figure on her 
``to do'' list. ``I really don't think about the overall,'' insisted 
Meissnitzer, who said her goals did include world championship and 
Olympic gold. ``That's something in the heads of the coaches and the 
media. ``If you think too much about the overall, it's bad for your 
skiing as you tend to be stiff and not relaxed enough,'' Meissnitzer 
explained. ``My aim this year is to win at the world championships 
in Vail.'' But whether she likes it or not, Meissnitzer has become 
the woman to beat, chased by those who openly have their eye on the 
World Cup's most prized trophy. Her biggest rivals, Ertl and teammate 
Hilde Gerg, second and third in the overall last year behind Katja 
Seizinger, and 1997 overall champion Pernilla Wiberg of Sweden, will 
attempt to narrow the gap during Sunday's slalom, which also counts 
towards the combined. Though she normally does not race in the slalom, 
Meissnitzer has chosen to try her hand at the combined, relying on 
her strength in the downhill to carry her through.
