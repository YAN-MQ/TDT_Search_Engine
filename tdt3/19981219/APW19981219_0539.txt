Germany's Ruhrgas has won an auction to buy 2.5 percent of shares 
in Russia's Gazprom monopoly, the Federal Property Fund announced 
Saturday. Ruhrgas offered to pay dlrs 660 million, dlrs 9 million 
above the government's minimum bidding price of dlrs 651 million. 
The second highest bidder for shares in the world's largest gas company, 
Interoil France Ltd., offered to pay dlrs 651.5 million, said Igor 
Shuvalov, chairman of the Federal Property Fund, which is responsible 
for privatization. The government has been trying to boost its revenues 
through privatization, but was recently forced to cancel planned auctions 
of the oil company Rosneft and the telecommunications concern Svyazinvest 
because of lack of interest. Anticipated proceeds from the Gazprom 
sale have already been included in the government's revenues in the 
final quarter of 1998. The government holds 40 percent of Gazprom 
shares, with private investors in Russia and abroad holding the remaining 
shares. The government had put off the sale of a Gazprom stake after 
the company's share prices plunged in the wake of the August devaluation 
of the ruble. The government plans to sell up to 5 percent of Gazprom 
shares, but has not yet announced when it will offer the additional 
2.5 percent. After repeated setbacks and a few scandals this year, 
Russia's privatization program will be redefined in 1999, said Deputy 
Minister for State Property, Alexander Braverman. ``It won't have 
just a fiscal character,'' Braverman told reporters. ``There will 
be an emphasis on investment, and the government won't be motivated 
by just short-term budget revenues.'' The government is also looking 
at expanding to new privatization methods, such as sales through the 
issuance of convertible bonds, Braverman said.
