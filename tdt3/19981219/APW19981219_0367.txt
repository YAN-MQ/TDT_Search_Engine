Palestinian journalists called a strike Saturday to protest curbs 
on coverage of pro-Iraq rallies. A day earlier, Palestinian police 
detained nine journalists who had covered pro-Iraq demonstrations 
in the West Bank and the Gaza Strip and sealed the offices of eight 
news organizations. Those offices shut by police included the Gaza 
City bureau of The Associated Press, which remained sealed on Saturday. 
Also closed down were five local Palestinian TV stations and one radio 
station in the West Bank, and the Gaza City branch of Orbit Satellite 
Service, an Israeli-based agency that transmits TV footage. The Palestinian 
Journalists Syndicate said in a statement that the closing of the 
offices and the detention of the journalists was a ``serious violation'' 
of their basic rights. The syndicate said it would stage a strike 
as well as a sit-in at the Palestinian legislature on Monday. The 
New York-based Committee to Protect Journalists also protested the 
curbs on coverage. In a letter to Palestinian leader Yasser Arafat, 
it urged Arafat to allow the offices to re-open and denounced ``attempts 
to silence independent journalism in flagrant violation of the right 
to free expression.'' The Foreign Press Association in Israel also 
said it was sending a letter of protest to Arafat's Palestinian Authority.
