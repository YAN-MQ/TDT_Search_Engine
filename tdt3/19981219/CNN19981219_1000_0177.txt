First lady Hillary Rodham Clinton met with congressional democrats 
this morning before they resumed debate in the house chamber. She 
reportedly thanked the group for their support during the impeachment 
process. She also told the lawmakers that her husband has no intention 
of resigning if impeached. Yesterday, the first lady called for reconciliation 
following the impeachment debate. After her meeting with democrats, 
house minority leader Dick Gephardt commented on the possibility of 
a walkout by democrats during the debate. I hope there's not a walkout 
because I hope there's not a denial of my motion to recommit, which 
is based on censuring and condemning the president's actions rather 
than impeaching him. If we can win that vote, I still think we can, 
I will plead with my republican colleagues to vote for a process that 
is open and fair, then there won't be any walkout.
