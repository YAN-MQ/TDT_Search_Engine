We assume that the delay this afternoon -- we were expecting to hear 
from President Clinton about ten minutes ago. The delay may be because 
of what is happening in other parts of the world. In Iraq, there has 
been a fourth wave of attacks on Bagdad. The president very busy today. 
He has been dealing with crisis overseas as well as crisis at home.
