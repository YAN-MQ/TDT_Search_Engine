After three decades of controversy, $30 billion and a series of mishaps, 
one of the nation's most costly and most troubled combat aircraft 
_ the B-1 bomber _ flew into combat for the first time this week. 
Two of the four B-1 bombers based in Oman since November joined in 
the second day of attacks against Iraq on Thursday, striking a military 
complex near Baghdad with a torrent of 500-pound bombs before flying 
back safely to their base with at least a small measure of vindication. 
``Well, vindication might not be the right word,'' said Col. Tony 
Przybyslawski, commanding officer of the Air Force's 28th Bomb Wing 
at Ellsworth Air Force Base in South Dakota, where two dozen B-1s 
are based. Nonetheless, he continued, ``Everyone here is really thrilled.'' 
Combat is a milestone that few thought the B-1 would ever reach. Never 
before in the nation's military-industrial history, it is fair to 
say, has so much energy been expended to build so many bombers that 
have accomplished so little. President Nixon first approved the development 
of the B-1 in 1970 to replace the nation's aging fleet of B-52s, which 
served as the mainstay of any nuclear strike against the Soviet Union. 
(Today's fleet of B-52s came off the assembly line in 1961 and 1962 
and are expected to fly well into the 21st Century.) By 1977, with 
the B-1 program beset with design flaws and cost overruns, President 
Carter killed the bomber. President Reagan gave it new life in 1981 
after using its demise during his election campaign to attack Carter 
as weak on defense. The Air Force rolled out the first of 100 B-1s 
in 1986, but problems had only just begun. In a little more than a 
year, three crashed. One went down over Colorado when a bird pierced 
its fuselage and ripped its hydraulic lines apart. In 1991, a study 
concluded it could not fly in the snow. It sat out the Persian Gulf 
war because of engine problems. Even now, some question whether the 
92 B-1s left have much of a mission. The long, sleek bombers, with 
swept-back wings for supersonic flight at low or high altitudes, was 
designed to penetrate Soviet airspace to deliver nuclear weapons, 
but President Bush ordered it refitted to carry conventional weapons. 
The B-1s first combat mission underscored its ongoing evolution. In 
a campaign that has been dominated by laser- and satellite-guided 
missiles and ``smart'' bombs, the two bombers dropped old-fashioned 
``dumb'' ones in what is traditionally known as ``carpet bombing.'' 
Over the next few years, all the B-1s will be adapted to carry the 
``smart'' weapons. Vice Adm. Scott Fry, director of operations for 
the Joint Chiefs of Staff, said Saturday that the Pentagon had not 
yet been able to assess the damage done by the bombers' strikes, which 
continued on the third night of the attack on Friday. But one of the 
pilots, Stephen Wolborsky, himself on his first combat mission, left 
little doubt there was a sense of accomplishment. ``The adrenaline 
was pumping,'' he said on the phone from Oman after his flight on 
Thursday. ``There was a certain amount of excitement for myself, our 
crew and the two ships.''
