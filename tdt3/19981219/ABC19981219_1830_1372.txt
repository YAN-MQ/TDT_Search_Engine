The final missile attack, ironically, on Iraq, came as the president 
was being impeached. ABC's Ron Claiborne is in Baghdad. Iraqis in 
the capital awoke before dawn to the frightening roar of exploding 
missiles and anti-aircraft fire. And tonight, there was more -- what 
the U.S. called the fourth wave of the attack. Despite four days of 
punishing strikes, Baghdad remains defiant. Tonight, the Iraqi vice 
president vowed the U.N. weapons inspectors would never be allowed 
to return. "The mission of UNSCOM," he said "the mission of the spys 
is past tense." They have no mission anymore. This latest round of 
strikes came as Muslims here began celebrating the holy month of Ramadan. 
The timing has outraged some Iraqis. "Americans are criminals." This 
man said. "They hit us on Ramadan. May God take his revenge on them." 
This man said, "the Americans and British have no mercy or humanity, 
Ramadan or not." Between air raids, there was the almost odd appearance 
of calm in Baghdad, though some people, like this man, were taking 
precautions, like stocking up on kerosene in case power stations are 
knocked out. Journalists have not been allowed to see any dramatic 
evidence of damage from the aerial assaults. Though they have been 
given access to hospitals filled with what the Iraqis say are wounded 
in the attacks. It's too soon for any official Iraqi reaction to the 
cessation of hostilities, but flout the four days of assaults by the 
U.S. and British armed forces, they've been forceful and unyielding. 
You can expect tomorrow they will declare this a victory for them. 
Charlie? Thanks, ABC's Ron Claiborne live in Baghdad.
