Harry Treleaven Jr., an advertising executive and early political 
consultant who is credited with creating the ``Nixon's the One!'' 
slogan for the 1968 presidential campaign, died Dec. 9 at the Sarah 
Neuman Nursing Home in Mamaroneck, N.Y. He was 76 and lived in Manhattan 
and Amagansett, N.Y. A former wife, Elsie Lawall Treleaven, said the 
cause was heart failure. Treleaven (pronounced TRELL-eh-ven) was one 
of the first practitioners of techniques that are used commonly in 
politics today in the packaging and handling of candidates. Though 
he was not the best known of Richard Nixon's Republican brain trust 
in the 1968 campaign, he played an important role in setting its tone 
and conveying the desired image to the public. Some of his contributions 
were recorded by Joe McGinniss in his book about the campaign, ``The 
Selling of the President,'' for which McGinniss received access to 
Treleaven's confidential staff memorandums. In one memorandum quoted 
by McGinniss, Treleaven discussed how the campaign had to turn Nixon's 
liabilities into assets. ``Not always loved, he is universally respected,'' 
Treleaven wrote. ``Not glamorous, he does have a certain star quality 
going for him.'' Treleaven conceded that there were some negatives 
to Nixon's personality, but said, ``If we recognize them, deal with 
them intelligently instead of worrying about them, their effect can 
be minimized.'' There was, for example, Nixon's apparent lack of humor. 
``Can be corrected to a degree,'' Treleaven wrote, ``but let's not 
be too obvious about it.'' On another of the candidate's shortcomings, 
warmth, Treleaven wrote, ``He can be helped greatly in this respect 
by how he is handled, by what he says and how he says it.'' One solution 
offered by Treleaven: ``presenting him informally.'' In another memorandum, 
Treleaven wrote of Nixon's pictures: ``Avoid closeups.'' Nixon presented 
a difficult case for the handlers. At one point, Treleaven wrote, 
``the chances of overcoming Richard Nixon's cold image and the chances 
of making him loved and making him glamorous via commercial exposure 
on television (where admittedly he has not been at his best) are far 
less than the chances of making him loved and making him glamorous 
via saturation exposure of artfully conceived and produced four-color, 
full-page (or double spread) magazine advertisements.'' Treleaven 
was born in Oak Park, Ill., and graduated from Duke University, where 
he was editor in chief of The Duke Chronicle. He rose to the rank 
of lieutenant while serving with the Navy's Seabees in the South Pacific 
during World War II. After the war he wrote plays for radio shows 
like ``The Whistler'' in California and then moved to New York as 
an executive at the J. Walter Thompson agency, working on accounts 
like Ford, Pan Am and Singer. Treleaven's first political job was 
as consultant to George Bush's congressional campaign in Houston, 
which Bush won in an upset at the start of his political career. Treleaven 
is survived by a son from his first marriage, to Joan Westphal, Gregory 
Treleaven of Boston; two children from his second marriage, to Elsie 
Lawall Treleaven, Bruce Treleaven of Montclair, N.J., and Gwyneth 
Claiborne of Fairfield, Conn., and four grandchildren. Leonard Garment, 
the Nixon counsel, in his book ``Crazy Rhythm,'' said Treleaven had 
a genius for political advertising. Garment once said the ``Nixon's 
the One!'' campaign showed Nixon as a person ``who has had experience 
and has been able to stay on his feet _ even if he is unpleasant.''
