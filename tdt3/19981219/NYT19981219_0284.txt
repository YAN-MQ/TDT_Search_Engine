The former premier of Nova Scotia was acquitted Friday of eight charges 
of rape, attempted rape and indecent assault related to incidents 
that allegedly took place 40 years ago. The former premier, Gerald 
Regan, now 70, led the province's government from 1970 to 1978. He 
was also a member of the federal Parliament and a Cabinet minister 
under Prime Minister Pierre Trudeau. ``It's been a long, long ordeal,'' 
he said after hearing the jury's decision. ``We've lived and died 
with this for the last five years.'' A jury of six women and four 
men deliberated about eight hours before returning the not guilty 
verdict in a Halifax courtroom Friday afternoon. But it was only after 
the jury had been sequestered Thursday night that it became known 
that besides the three women who had testified during the trial, 19 
other women had told investigators they had been sexually assaulted 
or harassed by Regan years ago. The judge, Michael MacDonald, blocked 
attempts by prosecutors to allow some of the other alleged victims 
to testify, and limited this trial to just the charges brought by 
three women. The judge also issued a publication ban, which prevented 
any information about the other cases from being reported during the 
trial. The trial of Regan, a respected public figure in Nova Scotia, 
was one of the most sensational proceedings in Canada in recent years. 
It brought calls from some quarters for a statute of limitations on 
criminal charges. The trial also forced Canadians to try to reconcile 
two starkly different images of a man who had spent most of his adult 
life in public service. Regan, a tall, stately man, was always formal 
and polite as he marched into and out of the Halifax courthouse. Inside 
the courtroom, however, the prosecution and three alleged victims 
portrayed him as a brutal rapist and sexual predator who enjoyed watching 
his victims cringe in fear. It came down to Regan's word against the 
moving testimony of the alleged victims. The accusers, now middle-aged 
women, said they were teen-agers when the attacks took place, often 
after Regan had parked his car in an isolated area. The women all 
said they knew him then but not intimately. Regan steadfastly denied 
making advances to the women. Throughout the trial, his wife, Carole, 
62, defended him against the accusations. The crown prosecutor, Adrian 
Reid, told the jury that despite Regan's gentlemanly demeanor and 
public reputation, he had ``a dark side'' that led him to prey on 
young women. The jury's acquittal was a stinging loss for the prosecution, 
which had spent five years on the case. ``If there are grounds for 
appeal, we'll consider them,'' Reid told reporters. But Regan's lawyer, 
Edward Greenspan, said that prosecutors had been off base from the 
moment the investigation was launched. ``If he had not been the former 
premier of this province they would never have spent millions of dollars 
pursuing him,'' Greenspan said. ``It just wouldn't have happened to 
an ordinary citizen.'' Regan's troubles have not ended. He is scheduled 
to appear in court again next February as proceedings begin on another 
sex complaint.
