CNN's latest survey of house members indicates republicans have enough 
votes to pass at least one article of impeachment. The survey finds 
219 votes for impeachment -- one more than is necessary. 200 members 
of Congress are expected to vote against all articles of impeachment. 
14 members, ten republicans and one democrat, still are undecided. 
One congressman could not be reached.
