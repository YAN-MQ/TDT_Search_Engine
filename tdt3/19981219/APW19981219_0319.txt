Thousands of bottles of wine, champagne and cognac that belonged to 
late Romanian dictator Nicolae Ceausescu, will be auctioned off, an 
official said Saturday. The auction will take place Monday in Bucharest. 
Most of the wines come from Romanian vineyards, others were given 
to Ceausescu by other Communist leaders. The oldest two bottles from 
Tirnave vineyard, 190 miles north of Bucharest, date back to 1918, 
said government spokesman Mihai Nica. Every bottle is sealed with 
a golden ribbon and bearing an attached card reading, ``Ceausescu's 
family residence.'' The state-run company that owns the 1,150 bottles, 
Bucur S.A., intends to sell them as a package starting at 35 million 
lei (dlrs 3,334), roughly dlrs 3 per bottle. The money will be given 
to senior citizens home. So far, only one person reportedly announced 
its intention to participate to the auction. Following the communist 
dictator's execution in the 1989 anti-Communist revolution, some 3,000 
bottles of spirits were found in his villa in Bucharest. The following 
year, 1,800 were sold and the money was donated to a hospital. Ceausescu's 
cars and boats are also still in government possession. The state 
would like to auction them off, but is still awaiting a government 
decision to allow the sale to go ahead.
