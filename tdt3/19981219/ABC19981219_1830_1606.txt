Finally tonight it has been said over and over, this is an historic 
day. The phrase may be overused, but the truth of it is self-evident. 
And so we asked three who study history for their opinions of this 
day. Impeachment is a word that is awfully hard to ignore when it 
is attached to the name of a president. And everything that is written 
about Bill Clinton in the future will have that word impeachment attached 
to it. Clearly, the history books are going to read, "William Jefferson 
Clinton, who was the 42nd president of the United States, who was 
impeached by the House of Representatives for bringing dishonor to 
the office fts presidency." has to be. This is not a constitutional 
crisis. It is a constitutional procedure. And we are lucky that the 
founders of this nation foresaw events like this and you can make 
a strong case that it should now be adjudicated in the senate as it 
will be. Since Nixon, we have lived in a culture where there is a 
sense that if you don't like a person, you try to destroy him. And 
that has happened on both sides of the aisle. The nature of political 
discourse, more than anything else, changed when newt Gingrich came 
in to Congress and decided he could produce a republican majority 
in the House of Representatives with a scorched-earth policy. I think 
what you are now going to see is the opposite of an era of good feeling, 
a period in which politicians are operating in a way in washington, 
which very confrontational, probably very poisonous for a very long 
time.
