Former White House press secretary Mike McCurry says he has doubts 
about President Clinton after his handling of the Monica Lewinsky 
matter. In an interview with the BBC, McCurry called the president's 
behavior "Incredibly bizarre" and said he's "deeply disappointed" 
in Mr. Clinton's actions. I have enormous doubts because of the recklessness 
of his behavior. The immorality is troublesome to me, but one can 
sort of understand how an adult male gets in that situation. I don't 
think Mrs. McCurry would understand me getting in that situation, 
but you can see how pressures occur. But there is something beyond 
that. The nature of this particular affair and the way he did conceal 
it really does raise some very profound troubling matters. Mike McCurry.
