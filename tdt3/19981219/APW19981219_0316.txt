Sporadic gun battles rattled Brazzaville's southern outskirts for 
a third straight day on Saturday, and civilians were evacuated by 
government troops pinning down a rogue militia group with machine 
gun and mortar fire. Police director-general Jean Francois Ndenguec 
said the renegades had been forced out of Republic of Congo's capital 
into the southern countryside bordering the former Zaire, now known 
as Congo. ``We have finished the war in the capital and we expect 
to finish it very soon elsewhere,'' Ndenguec told The Associated Press. 
Neighborhoods on Brazzaville's south side were largely abandoned and 
army officers said they would treat any people remaining in violence 
flashpoints as ``enemies.'' At least 100 renegade soldiers and 10 
government troops were killed since the fighting began on Wednesday, 
Ndenguec said. He did not know whether civilians had been caught in 
the crossfire and his estimates could not be independently confirmed. 
Scattered machine gun and mortar fire could be heard early Saturday 
morning in the Bacongo suburb on the southern fringe of Brazzaville 
and later in Madibou, a town about 15 kilometers (10 miles) south 
of the capital. The exact origin of the gunfire was unclear. More 
than 10,000 people are believed to have fled the Central African country. 
Fighting between the outlawed ``Ninja'' militia of former Prime Minister 
Bernard Kolelas began Wednesday night and has continued sporadically 
ever since. Although earlier in the week many people panicked in downtown 
Brazzaville, believing the Ninjas had launched an all-out attack, 
by Saturday shops re-opened and commuters returned to the streets. 
Electricity remained off and working telephones were scarce, although 
officials promised power would be restored by Saturday night. Last 
year, Kolelas and his sometime-ally, ousted president Pascal Lissouba, 
fled the country after President Denis Sassou-Nguesso and his ``Cobra'' 
militia _ with the help of Angolan government troops _ defeated Lissouba 
in a five-month civil war last year. Since then, the Ninjas have resisted 
disarmament and have been waging a campaign against the government. 
Sassou-Nguesso has outlawed all militia groups including his own Cobra 
militia. Many of his former militia fighters have joined the army. 
Angola turned the tide in Republic of Congo's civil war, sending troops 
to help Sassou-Nguesso defeat Lissouba. Many Angolan soldiers stayed 
in Republic of Congo after the war ended. Angola joined the civil 
war because Lissouba was believed to be sending aid to the Angolan 
rebel group UNITA, which has been fighting Angola's government for 
two decades. The Republic of Congo government says UNITA is now supporting 
the Ninjas and that 15 UNITA soldiers were captured last week near 
Brazzaville.
