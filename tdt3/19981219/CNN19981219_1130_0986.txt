if you've taken care of most of your holiday shopping, but you're 
still short one good gift idea, consider frequent flier miles. kalin 
thomas-samuel has the story in today's edition of "working ahead." 
this time of year, many travelers may be short on cash and heavy on 
frequent flyer miles. with little effort, miles can be turned into 
holiday gifts. i give them away to her. if they need something to 
go somewhere or something like that, and don't really have the funds 
to be able to buy a ticket, then i'd rather do that for them, then 
give them something that i can't use. if you're eligible for an award, 
you can designate your award to go to someone else. what's not allowed 
is transferring your miles to someone else's frequent flyer account. 
some airlines do let you buy miles to add to the recipient's account. 
even upgrade awards make good gifts. you can buy the cheap ticket 
or the person can buy a cheap ticket and then with this mileage award 
can upgrade it and for once travel in a comfortable seat. frequent 
flyer miles can also be perfect corporate gifts. companies donate 
their mileages to their employees as incentive packages. that's good. 
airlines say it's a way to thank clients or employees. but even when 
awards are given as gifts, restrictions and black-out dates may still 
apply. kalin thomas-samuel, cnn, atlanta.
