Young Americans appear to be getting the message about drugs. A new 
government survey finds drug use among teenagers is declining. Pierre 
Thomas explains. Some promising news for American parents. According 
to a new U.S. government-funded survey, teen drug use appears to be 
stabilizing, or in some cases, even falling for the second year in 
a row. We're making a little bit of a dent in a very big problem. 
We ought to be cautious about our assertions today, but I would argue 
that america's team effort is starting to pay off. The 1998 survey 
of 49,000 students by the University of Michigan shows teen drug use 
decreased or remained the same in most categories, decreased among 
tenth graders in all categories, including marijuana. Eighth graders 
used less LSD and inhalants. And eighth graders said even trying marijuana 
was a great risk, showing a Shift in attitudes. U.S. officials are 
optimistic because they've seen nearly a decade of bad news about 
teen drug use. The new trend follows six years of steady increases. 
why? Young people are becoming more concerned about the hazards of 
drugs because they're seeing more people in their own peer groups 
and also in public life who are getting into trouble with drugs. All 
of them are not acceptable to me. But many teens say drugs remain 
pervasive, especially marijuana, which is far more potent now than 
during the 1960s and 1970s. You see it around every corner, every 
school. Most students smoke it. Even friends of mine do it. While 
the overall news is promising, teen cocaine use is up, and teen drug 
use does remain high. When surveyed, 25% of 12th graders and more 
than 12% of eighth graders said they had used illicit drugs in just 
the past 30 days. Pierre Thomas, CNN, Washington.
