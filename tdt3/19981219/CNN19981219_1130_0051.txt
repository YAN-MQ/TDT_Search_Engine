president clinton is turning out not to be the sole focus of today's 
impeachment vote on capitol hill. after calling on the president to 
resign, speaker-designate bob livingston stunned the house by announcing 
he'll be setting the example by resigning himself. livingston says 
he will not stand for speaker of the house on january 6th. he says 
he will resign his house seat in six months and call a special election. 
just days ago, livingston admitted to having several extramarital 
affairs. as he announced his decision, livingston apologized to his 
family. i can only challenge you in such fashion if i am willing to 
heed my own words. to my colleagues, my friends and most especially 
my wife and family, i have hurt you all deeply and i beg your forgiveness. 
i was prepared to lead our narrow majority as speaker, and i believe 
i had it in me to do a fine job. but i cannot do that job or be the 
kind of leader that i would like to be under current circumstances. 
so i must set the example that i hope president clinton will follow. 
i will not stand for speaker of the house on january 6th. reaction 
on the house floor was swift. majority whip tom delay, choked with 
emotion, praised livingston for his decision. this country shows us 
time and time again how great it is. there's no greater american in 
my mind, at least today, than bob livingston. because -- -- because 
he understood what this debate was all about. it was about honor and 
decency and integrity and the truth, everything that we honor in this 
country. the white house also issued comment. a spokesman says president 
clinton wants livingston to reconsider his resignation. the president, 
as we said, is going to do what's in the best interests of this country. 
he's going to keep on pushing his agenda forward. and i think that 
it would be wrong to give in to this insidious politics of personal 
destruction which seems so pervasive in this town now.
