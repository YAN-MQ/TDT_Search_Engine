It takes a lot to shock the seasoned veterans in the nation's capitol, 
but members of Congress seemed to be genuinely stunned today when 
speaker-elect bob Livingston announced his resignation. ABC's Mike 
Von Fremd reports. God bless America. "it was as if the air had been 
sucked out of the chamber," one member said after speaker-elect Bob 
Livingston announced his resignation. The republican leadership immediately 
called him a hero for having the courage to step down. There is no 
greater American in my mind, at least today, than Bob livingston. 
Democratic leader Dick Gephardt called Livingston an honorable man 
and led a standing ovation for him. But a chorus of democrats said 
Livingston is leaving office for the wrong reason. It is a surrender. 
It is a surrender to a developing sexual McCarthyism. That sentiment 
was shared by many of Livingston's conservative louisiana district. 
why? I mean, what he did was wrong, but didn't have anything to do 
with doing his job. Clinton is being tried for perjury, not infidelity, 
so I am very sorry to hear about Livingston. After Livingston announced 
his resignation, speaker Gingrich came by his office to offer a very 
public Pat on the back, two republican leaders whose careers have 
been cut short by a democratic president's scandal. The governor has 
urged the people of Louisiana to call Livingston's office here in 
Washington and try to convince him to reconsider. Those who know Livingston 
say that seems unlikely, and plans are already under way to pick his 
successor. Mike Von Fremd, ABC News, Capitol Hill.
