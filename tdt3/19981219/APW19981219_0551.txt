LONDON (AP) _ U.S. and British forces are ``well on course to meet 
our objectives,'' Prime Minister Tony Blair said Saturday, but he 
said attacks in Iraq would continue until military goals are achieved. 
British jets based in Kuwait were joining in a fourth day of attacks, 
Blair confirmed. ``As well as the military dimension we are already 
in discussion with our colleagues and allies and partners around the 
world as to how we adopt a forward strategy to insure that three is 
containment and stability in the long term,'' he said at a brief news 
conference at 10 Downing St., his official residence. Earlier, British 
officials showed videotapes of bomb hits on Republican Guard facilities 
in southern Iraq, and emphasized that the Guard was a key target of 
the operation. ``Those are the people that surround him, keep him 
in office, have their own system of repression, and of course have 
been instrumental in putting together the means of concealing the 
weapons of mass destruction,'' Blair said. Gen. Sir Charles Guthrie, 
chief of the defense staff, estimated that the attacks on Friday night 
and Saturday morning achieved 75 percent of their objectives, without 
losing any of Britain's 12 Kuwait-based Tornado fighter-bombers. Defense 
Secretary George Robertson, who joined Guthrie at a news briefing, 
said the Republican Guard was targeted because of its role in protecting 
Saddam as well as guarding the chemical and biological weapons programs 
which are the prime targets of the U.S-British operation. ``We want 
the Republican Guard to know that the cozy life they have led under 
Saddam is under attack,'' Robertson said. Britain released video images 
of laser-guided bombs hitting Republican Guard facilities at Al Kut, 
100 miles (160 kms) southeast of Baghdad, and the nearby Muhammad 
Al Amin garrison. Guthrie said leaflets dropped by U.S. and British 
planes in Iraq had warned the regular army to stay out of the conflict. 
He said the message was ``Keep out of this, you are not our targets, 
remain in your barracks.'' ``And I think it is a message which has 
got across,'' Guthrie said. He added that there had been no reports 
of Iraqi aircraft challenging the attacking forces. Blair, in an interview 
with the BBC World Service earlier Saturday, said the United States 
and Britain had struck against Saddam ``because we genuinely believe 
the stability of the world is at risk if this man's allowed to get 
back out of his cage.'' said he regretted civilian casualties but 
said the military operation was necessary. ``If we hadn't taken action 
now then he knows we lack the will to prevent him developing these 
weapons,'' Blair added.
