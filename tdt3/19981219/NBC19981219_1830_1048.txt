the targets were mostly military, hit mostly at night, and that meant 
by day, iraqis could go about their business. that means the start 
of the holy month of ram dan. here's donatella lorch. a special evening 
in baghdad. the al fayes family gathers at dusk to celebrate ramadan, 
and the breaking of the fast. wiaam, a mechanical engineer, has cooked 
all afternoon as she always does. american bombings haven't changed 
the family habits. my husband he came now from his work nothing changes. 
her son omar has spend the afternoon weight-lifting. i went to see 
my friends. normal life. for many iraqis, cruise missile attacks only 
mean less sleep. 6-year-old doraid is frightened, but the rest of 
the family says they've had eight years to get used to it. this is 
not the first time from 1991 until now. still, american missiles do 
not make the family hate americans. our war is with the american government, 
not the american people. and we know that all american people, they 
don't agree about this war. so you're not angry with the american 
people? no. and so iraqis go about their business -- to school, to 
work, and by sunset, home in time to brake the ramadan fast. there 
are two realties here. throughout the daylight hours, life goes on 
as normal, almost as if people have decided to block out the bombs 
and missiles that have been raining down on them when night falls.
