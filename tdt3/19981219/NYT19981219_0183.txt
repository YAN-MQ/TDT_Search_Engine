By the time the voting was over Saturday in the House, the vast majority 
of the moderate Republicans from the Northeast had locked arms with 
their more conservative brethren from the South and West to support 
the impeachment of President Clinton. But in their oratory, the moderates 
struggled to distance themselves from the unyielding, often angry 
speeches of Clinton's most bitter adversaries. The moderates expressed 
sadness, dismay, confusion and angst. Several praised the president's 
policies. A few said they liked him as a person. And most emphasized 
that they were not motivated by hate _ the emotion that Democrats 
asserted had driven the impeachment process inexorably to its conclusion 
Saturday. ``I bear no animosity toward the president,'' said Rep. 
Marge Roukema, R-N.J. ``I do not wish him ill. Clearly, any sins that 
may have been committed are between him and the Lord. And any infidelities 
must remain between him and his family. But we cannot deny the damage 
that has been done to his office and to our nation.'' Rep. Bob Franks, 
another New Jersey Republican, said Friday: ``It's with a profound 
sense of sadness that I stand here this evening. We're called upon 
to decide what is right for the country and what is required to serve 
the interests of justice. In making this decision, I recognize that 
the purpose of impeachment is not to punish a political leader, but 
to preserve the integrity of our institutions of government.'' In 
a region where Clinton's policies are popular and the president himself 
continues to receive high ratings in opinion polls, the anguish of 
these representatives is hardly surprising. Many of the Republicans 
from New York, New Jersey and Connecticut _ all states that Clinton 
won handily in 1996 _ have said that they expect to infuriate many 
of their constituents by voting for impeachment. And so, in their 
floor speeches, some of the region's members of Congress leavened 
their criticisms of Clinton's behavior with praise for his work. ``There 
is much that is likable about President Clinton, and I was proud to 
work with him on the environment, education, health care and other 
issues I deeply care about,'' said Rep. Michael Forbes, R-N.Y. ``This 
issue comes down to one basic principle: The president of the United 
States is not above the law.'' It was left to the region's Democrats, 
who for much of the last six years have been Clinton's strongest defenders, 
to raise their voices in anger, accusing Kenneth Starr, the independent 
counsel, as well as House Republican leaders and the national Republican 
Party itself, of peddling hate, destroying civility in Congress and 
railroading a popularly elected president. ``What has this president 
done to cause so much hatred, so much animosity?'' asked Rep. Charles 
Rangel, D-N.Y. ``You have brought hatred to this floor! You can see 
it in the eyes. You can see it in the language. And people will walk 
lockstep and vote as Republicans and not as members of the United 
States Congress.'' Rep. Robert Menendez, D-N.J., said: ``Somewhere 
along the way, some in this House forgot that Bill Clinton is our 
president, not your personal enemy. The Constitution is not a license 
to destroy a president because you don't like him.'' Several Democrats 
likened impeachment to a peaceful coup d'etat, salting their defenses 
of Clinton with warnings of political recriminations against Republicans 
from a scandal-weary electorate. Using the Spanish phrase for a coup, 
``golpe de estado,'' Rep. Jose Serrano, D-N.Y., said: ``I grew up 
in the public housing projects of the South Bronx. I can see a bunch 
of bullies when I see them. The bullies get theirs, and you're going 
to get yours, too. The people are going to rise up, from California 
to New York.'' Most pro-impeachment Republicans from the region said 
they believed that Clinton had probably committee perjury by lying 
under oath about his affair with Monica Lewinsky, and they argued 
that such high-profile mendacity would be damaging to the nation's 
moral fiber and judicial traditions. Rep. Rick Lazio, R-N.Y., recalled 
asking people to tell the truth in court when he was a prosecutor. 
Most did, he said. ``If an anonymous citizen can abide by his oath, 
what about a president?'' he asked. ``When a president fails in his 
duty as an ordinary citizen does not, the failure is catastrophic.'' 
Several members from the region sounded calls for bipartisanship. 
Saying he felt that the president had not committed impeachable offenses 
but had come very close, Rep. Christopher Shays, R-Conn., said he 
could understand the sentiments of people on both sides of the vote. 
``I pray that the Republicans and Democrats in this Congress will 
find common ground and do the work of the people of this great and 
prosperous land during the next two years,'' Shays said. Two New Yorkers, 
one a Democrat and one a Republican, even chastised their own parties 
for an overzealous partisanship that had criminalized politics and 
hounded worthy people from government over the past decade. ``We are 
a nation consumed by investigations, by special counsel,'' said Rep. 
Peter King, R-N.Y., one of only five Republicans to vote against the 
first article of impeachment. Addressing his fellow Republicans, King 
added, ``We saw the abuses of special counsels by Lawrence Walsh and 
others as they went against members of the Reagan and Bush administrations. 
We saw good people, like Elliott Abrams, brought down on the flimsiest 
of charges involving lying. And all of us know it was wrong, and we 
rallied against it. But Saturday, somehow we're willing to apply a 
different standard, a different principle. And that's wrong.'' Rep. 
Charles Schumer, D-N.Y., who will join the Senate in January, said 
both parties had pursued investigations to a destructive end. ``We 
are now at a point,'' he said, ``where we risk, deeply risk, wounding 
the nation we all love.''
