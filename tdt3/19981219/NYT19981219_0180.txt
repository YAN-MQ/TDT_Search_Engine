Rep. Zach Wamp, R-Tenn., delivered sobering news to Rep. Robert Livingston 
on Saturday morning: A small but influential cluster of House conservatives 
was so furious at Livingston for not disclosing his adulterous affairs 
earlier that it was considering voting against him for speaker in 
January. ``There were quite a few members who felt this was a huge 
dilemma,'' Wamp said he had told Livingston, putting the number at 
about a dozen. It did not matter because Livingston had made up his 
mind. Moments after his conversation with Wamp, he stepped up to the 
microphone on the House floor and stunned the chamber _ and the political 
world _ by declaring that he would not stand for speaker and would 
retire from the House in six months. Livingston's decision appeared 
to be driven by more than threats to his political survival after 
he disclosed on Thursday that he had been unfaithful. His friends 
and colleagues said he had been huddled with his wife, Bonnie, who 
was described as devastated by the turn of events. ``His wife is suffering 
terribly,'' said Rep. Billy Tauzin, R-La., one of Livingston's closest 
friends. He said that in a conversation he had with Livingston on 
the House floor on Friday, ``he talked about how much pain she was 
in. He didn't tell anyone about his decision.'' Tauzin said he had 
not tried to talk him out of the decision after it was made. ``No 
one should. It's personal. It wouldn't have done any good. Bob did 
not take a poll. He did not solicit advice.'' He added: ``This is 
not just him. This is Bonnie.'' Despite the personal factors, Livingston 
sought to turn his decision to the political advantage of Republicans 
by calling on President Clinton to resign for his own personal indiscretions. 
That move added credibility to the Republican cries for Clinton to 
resign because it immediately silenced Democrats who had sought to 
cast Republicans as motivated by unabashed partisanship. ``This puts 
enormous additional pressure on Clinton because it raises the bar 
and the standards for doing what's best for the country ahead of what's 
best for you or your party,'' said Ralph Reed, a Republican strategist. 
But he said he did not expect Clinton to ever resign, saying, ``I 
don't think the words resignation or quit are in Clinton's vocabulary.'' 
Reed and many other strategists and friends of Livingston said they 
thought he was motivated by a variety of personal considerations _ 
not the least of which was his concern about trying to lead a House 
that is wracked by partisanship. ``This is a series of earthquakes 
and tornadoes which make Watergate look like a mild spring shower,'' 
said Kenneth Duberstein, a White House chief of staff under President 
Ronald Reagan. ``I think this is Bob Livingston realizing that enough 
is enough and feeling like it was his duty to step aside. I take him 
at his word.'' A year ago Livingston announced plans to retire, but 
then changed his mind. William W. Pascoe III, political director of 
the American Conservative Union, said that considering he was once 
chairman of the Appropriations Committee, ``there's no limit to how 
much money he could make'' as a lobbyist. But, he added, ``We're being 
silly if we say that the thought never occurred to him on his own 
that he was setting an example that might build public support for 
Clinton to end this long national nightmare and resign.'' But Livingston's 
decision also thrust the Republican Party deeper into turmoil only 
weeks after a discouraging election that cost the party seats in the 
House and forced Speaker Newt Gingrich to step aside for Livingston. 
``This certainly has to erode confidence in the Republicans' ability 
to govern,'' said Charles Cook Jr., editor of a nonpartisan political 
report. ``But at the same time none of this makes the Democrats look 
any better. The headaches that this creates are just endless.'' Livingston's 
announcement not only set off a fresh leadership struggle, but many 
leading Republicans said they now feared that David Duke, the former 
Ku Klux Klan leader, would follow through on his plans to run for 
Livingston's House seat should he retire. Rep. Sonny Callahan, R-Ala., 
said he was worried that the House would not be ready to pick a speaker 
when it reconvened on Jan. 6. He said he believed that Livingston 
should take over as speaker until he left office in six months _ a 
sentiment echoed by many Democrats. On Friday, Livingston asked some 
of his supporters _ Reps. Callahan, Ron Packard of California, C.W. 
Young of Florida, Jerry Lewis of California and Donald Manzullo of 
Illinois _ to find out what members thought about his infidelities. 
They said he was concerned that he might have lost the backing of 
some of his supporters, who were furious that Livingston had not leveled 
with them in his campaign for the leadership post. But almost overwhelmingly, 
members continued to back him, saying they were disappointed but still 
had faith in him. That did not stop a vocal minority of conservatives 
openly speculating as early as Friday night that he might resign. 
``On our side there were some members who felt they deserved to know 
this before the conference race in November,'' Wamp said. ``It probably 
would have changed the outcome. Bob should have told us.'' The tension 
between Livingston and House conservatives is reminiscent of the threats 
Gingrich faced from the right wing of his caucus, which had grown 
increasingly disenchanted with his leadership _ and was instrumental 
in his decision to resign. ``Livingston's relationship with conservatives 
in the caucus was always going to be difficult because he is not one 
of them,'' Cook said. ``It was always going to put him in a position 
of weakness in dealing with them.'' Immediately after Livingston's 
speech Saturday morning, a number of Republicans and Democrats surrounded 
him and asked him to reconsider, some publicly, some in private conversations. 
A few members were crying in the foyer. ``There was a feeling of almost 
complete disbelief,'' said Rep. Peter King, R-N.Y. Jay Stone, a lobbyist 
here who is one of Livingston's closest friends from Louisiana, recalled 
Saturday how excited the congressman was about becoming speaker. ``It 
was, `Can you believe this? Can you believe that I'm actually doing 
it?' '' Stone said. ``One of our own friends had actually made it. 
Now, we're just devastated.''
