Two guerrillas have been killed in overnight clashes with Israeli 
troops in southern Lebanon, the Hezbollah militant group said Saturday. 
Israeli helicopter gunships repeatedly attacked suspected guerrilla 
bases overnight, Lebanese security officials said. The air raids occurred 
near Majdel Selim, about 25 kilometers (15 miles) east of the port 
of Tyre. A statement by the Iranian-backed Hezbollah said Wafik Zahwi, 
22, and Abdul Rasoul Baydoun, 21, were killed ``confronting the enemy'' 
near an Israeli outpost. In Jerusalem, an Israeli army spokesman said 
at least two Hezbollah guerrillas were killed and several more injured 
in the central sector of the Israeli-occupied zone of southern Lebanon. 
The guerrillas were apparently laying explosives when the clashes 
occurred, the spokesman said, adding no Israeli soldiers were injured. 
On Saturday, Israeli troops and the Lebanese guerrillas exchanged 
artillery and mortar fire around Sojod, about 22 kilometers (14 miles) 
southeast of the port city of Sidon, Lebanese officials said. Also, 
the pro-Israeli militia, the South Lebanon Army, fired mortars and 
155mm howitzers at villages facing the occupied zone, the officials 
said. The villages are believed to be used only by guerrillas. There 
were no immediate reports of casualties in these exchanges. Hezbollah 
and other guerrilla factions are fighting to drive some 1,500 Israeli 
troops and their 2,500 militia allies out of Lebanon. Israel set up 
the occupied zone in 1985 as a buffer against guerrilla attacks on 
its northern territory.
