Like most children, the second-graders in room 205 at Public School 
116 in Murray Hill love to see images of themselves in the stories 
they read, their teacher said last week. They love the story about 
how people of every shade rally to help a Hispanic mother and daughter 
who lost everything in an apartment fire. They love to read about 
how children come in ``All the Colors of the Earth.'' They especially 
enjoy a book about an African-American father who leaves home to find 
work, only to return when the seasons change. These are tales that 
most of the 27 students in Virginia Lockwood's class can relate to, 
Ms. Lockwood said on Thursday. They are mostly children of employees 
at the United Nations, and come from Vietnam, the Caribbean, Japan 
and other places, as well as Manhattan. In a setting so dizzyingly 
diverse, race and ethnicity are beside the point, Ms. Lockwood said. 
Multiculturalism _ a flashpoint for so much recent tension and bitterness 
in the city's public schools _ is no big deal in Ms. Lockwood's class. 
``I don't say, `Look, children, here's a story about a little African-American 
boy, or here's a story about a Vietnamese girl,''' Ms. Lockwood said. 
``Instead, I say: `Look, children, here's a great story about feelings.' 
Let's read it together. The characters might happen to be black, Hispanic 
or Asian, but that's not the point.'' But not every classroom in the 
city is so relaxed. Last month, a white third-grade teacher was driven 
from a school in Bushwick, Brooklyn, by black parents angry over her 
use of a book called ``Nappy Hair,'' a coming-of-age story about a 
black girl. The parents _ whom Schools Chancellor Rudy Crew later 
criticized as misguided _ denounced and threatened the teacher after 
concluding that the book was offensive. In a school system where 66 
percent of the 70,000 teachers are white and 70 percent of the 1.1 
million school children are black and Hispanic, having white teachers 
teaching black history and culture can hardly be avoided. Though the 
Bushwick incident resonated throughout the city, it did not dampen 
the enthusiasm of teachers like Ms. Lockwood. If anything, it only 
strengthened their resolve. Ms. Lockwood integrates multiculturalism 
into her classroom mostly through reading and writing, rather than 
introducing it as something separate _ a trap that many people fall 
into, she said. Ms. Lockwood's strategy seems to work. While reading 
a story last week about American children picking on an Asian girl 
because of her native clothes, a Vietnamese student said emphatically 
that the outfit was ``dress-up clothes, not pajamas.'' An African-American 
boy then offered to have his mother sew the outfits for all the students 
in the class. ``We have children sharing information about their culture 
in a relaxed setting, rather than setting it up as a day for this 
culture or that culture,'' Ms. Lockwood said. Gail Wesson Spivey, 
a black librarian at Public School 198 in East Flatbush, and Teri 
Gray, a white Jewish second-grade teacher, help each other avoid culturally 
insensitive material by running books by each other. Ms. Spivey also 
relies on parents. Last week, she asked a Muslim mother to read a 
book about Ramadan to see if it was culturally sensitive. The parent 
approved the book and Ms. Spivey added it to the library. ``This was 
not, `Mother, may I use this book?''' Ms. Spivey said. ``It was more 
like, `What do you think?''' Ms. Spivey is certain that she would 
have been driven out of Public School 75 in Bushwick right alongside 
the teacher, Ruth Sherman, over the use of ``Nappy Hair.'' She has 
been recommending it to white colleagues since it was published last 
year. ``It gets on my nerves that this is something that people still 
have to figure out,'' Ms. Spivey said. ``I've spent a lifetime being 
a voracious reader and none of the books were about me. When `Nappy 
Hair' came out, I was ecstatic.'' Ms. Sherman transferred from Public 
School 75 to Public School 131 in Jamaica, Queens, about two weeks 
ago after some black parents threatened her at a public meeting. They 
said the book, a critically acclaimed story by a black scholar, was 
racist. They were angered by black-and-white photocopied pages of 
an illustration from the book that were left in mailboxes around the 
community. The fliers showed a dark-skinned black child complaining 
about having kinky hair. Taken out of context, the illustrations can 
appear jarring and the text insensitive. Last week, Crew lashed out 
at the disapproving parents, saying their actions could cause white 
teachers to shy away from a multicultural curriculum. Ms. Sherman, 
however, has said in interviews that she would not be deterred and 
planned to use the book at her new school. With the approach of Black 
History Month in February, Evelina Barker, a Hispanic parent who lives 
in Bushwick, wondered aloud whether teachers were going to fear teaching 
children about historic black figures. ``What's going to happen here?'' 
Ms. Barker said recently on a windswept sidewalk outside Public School 
75 on Grove Street. Her 8-year-old daughter, Amani Coleman, was a 
student in Ms. Sherman's class. ``If a teacher teaches something in 
Spanish, are they going to be called racist?'' Isoke Nia, a black 
instructor at Teacher's College at Columbia University, said she has 
seen white teachers teach black history better than some black teachers. 
``I couldn't let the words come out of my mouth that only black teachers 
can teach black kids,'' Ms. Nia said. ``We as a people, who have had 
a less than pleasant relationship with America, need to sit down together 
and shake out some of the stuff. ``I don't see anyone banning any 
Asian books or stories about the Holocaust,'' Ms. Nia continued. ``In 
books about the Holocaust, Jewish people aren't referred to kindly 
in every sentence. It's the knowledge of the teacher. The question 
is do they have the sensitivity to teach it. In most cases, the answer 
is yes.''
