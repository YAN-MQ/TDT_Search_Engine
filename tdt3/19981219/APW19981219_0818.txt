In this seaside, gambling resort, everybody thinks everybody else 
is bluffing. It was no different Saturday with a bunch of American 
professional basketball players around. Remaining steadfast in their 
belief that there will be a settlement that ends the National Basketball 
Association lockout and saves the season, the players said commissioner 
David Stern's threat of no basketball was as weak as a dlrs 5 chip 
at a dlrs 100 blackjack table. ``Everyone wants to make it seem like 
a false sense of security on the players' behalf,'' said Karl Malone, 
one of 16 current and former All-Stars who played in a charity exhibition 
game at the Convention Center Saturday night. ``I think it will end 
in the next week. Sometimes when it's Christmas, you're in a giving 
mood. We've been doing it all summer; maybe it's their turn now.'' 
Nearly all the players involved in the charity game were veterans 
and millionaires who are set for life financially. Consequently, their 
optimism might not be a reflection of the feelings among the broader 
population of locked out NBA players. Still, as they offered reassurances, 
they seemed genuine in their belief that it would be too risky for 
the owners to imperil the value of their franchises by scrapping an 
entire season. There has been talk that a rival league would be formed 
and the NBA would never recover. ``My man went on vacation, so obviously 
he's not too worried about it,'' Houston forward Charles Barkley said 
in reference to Stern's much-publicized holiday trip to Aspen, Colorado. 
``This is about money, a lot of money. The owners are greedy and the 
players are greedy. I can sympathize with both. I don't care about 
either one of them. I just want it to get resolved because it's not 
good for the game of basketball.'' ``If he wants to do it, do it. 
If he cancels the season, he cancels the season,'' Seattle guard Gary 
Payton said sarcastically. ``He's going to hurt himself and he's going 
to hurt us and the fans will be hurt, so that would be crazy.'' NBA 
spokesman Chris Brienza said Stern was expected to leave New York 
Saturday but would be able to return within a few hours if necessary. 
Deputy commissioner Russ Granik said there was no news to report. 
Brienza also said no undue significance should be attached to Stern's 
statement Friday that the cancellation of the season was ``virtually 
inevitable.'' ``It's nothing different,'' Brienza said. ``You could 
go back to his comments after the last full negotiating session (Dec. 
3) when he said it was more probable than not that the season won't 
be played.'' Union director Billy Hunter also dismissed the statement. 
``It's no different from what he has been saying,'' Hunter said. ``And 
my position hasn't changed. We are prepared to compromise and we are 
prepared to negotiate.'' The first 2 1-2 months of the season already 
have been lost and a deal needs to be reached soon in order to save 
the season. The opposing sides are fighting over the rules for dividing 
about dlrs 2 billion in annual revenue. The lockout is essentially 
a strike by the owners. Under American labor law, without a contract 
_ or in this case a collective bargaining agreement, owners can prohibit 
_ or lock out _ players from working until a deal is reached. The 
collective bargaining agreement (CBA) is the ground rules which sets 
things like minimum salaries, pension and health insurance benefits, 
roster limits and a salary cap. The biggest issue in this work stoppage 
is money. The owners have insisted on maximum salary costs and the 
union has refused to accept a ``hard'' salary cap. The league has 
a limit each team can spend on salaries, but the so-called ``Larry 
Bird'' exemption allows clubs to disregard the cap to re-sign their 
own free agents. It virtually makes the salary cap an invisible ceiling. 
The problem comes down to how much of the dlrs 2 billion in projected 
annual revenues should be dedicated to player salaries. The club owners 
have asked for a 50-50 split, while the players have tied many of 
their concessions to receiving 60 percent.
