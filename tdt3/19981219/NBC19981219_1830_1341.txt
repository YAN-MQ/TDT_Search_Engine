now that the house has voted impeachment, members of the u.s. senate 
now will be the jurors in what history may record as the real "trial 
of the century." that could result in removal from office. here's 
nbc's john palmer at the white house. the senate has tried only one 
president for impeachment, andrew johnson, who escaped conviction 
by one vote 130 years ago. but senate officials say the rules are 
clear enough from more recent impeachment trials of ten other federal 
officials. january sixth, the senate will convene with new members 
sworn in. the next day, house judiciary chairman henry hyde will come 
to the senate and read the articles of impeachment. january eighth, 
chief justice william renquist, who will preside over the trial, will 
administer a special oath to members of the senate who will serve 
as jurors. at this point, the process pauses, giving the president's 
lawyers a month to file a response. this pause offers the president 
a window to negotiate a possible plea bargain for something less than 
an impeachment conviction, which would then have to be approved by 
the senate. when the trial resumes in mid-february, senate democrats 
are likely to make a motion to adjourn which, if passed by a simple 
majority, would halt the trial. failing that, the proceeding will 
continue. if they want to call witnesses and make detailed evidentiary 
findings, then this could be a very lengthy process. it takes a two-thirds 
vote to convict on any impeachment count. that's 67 from among the 
55 republicans and 45 democrats who'll make up the senate next year. 
if convicted on any count, the president would immediately leave office, 
an outcome mr. clinton and senate democrats will work hard to avoid.
