Crucial valves in the sprinkler system at a Brooklyn apartment building 
for the elderly where a fire killed three firefighters Friday may 
have been closed for years, perhaps even since the building was built 
in 1983, and the sprinklers in a twin building were also improperly 
shut down, city officials said Saturday. Mayor Rudolph Giuliani ordered 
an immediate check of the sprinkler systems at about a dozen other 
Housing Authority buildings, and started an investigation into whether 
requirements for inspections and other fire-prevention procedures 
should be strengthened. Giuliani said all new apartment buildings 
should be required to have sprinklers. After meeting with top officials 
in the fire, police and housing departments, the mayor said, ``They 
have been working all through the night to try to find the answer 
to make sure that this problem doesn't exist in any other building 
that has a similar kind of system.'' Although the main valve connected 
to the water source was open, five valves on the first floor intended 
to feed water to the residential areas were concealed behind a trapdoor 
that had been painted over, according to Giuliani and Fire Commissioner 
Thomas Von Essen. It was unclear how the sprinkler system had passed 
a 1996 fire department inspection, or whether required monthly checks 
by the Housing Authority had been conducted properly. Typically, the 
head of the most remote sprinkler in a system would be removed to 
check whether water was reaching it; it appears that in this building 
only the main valve was checked. ``There are a series of inspections 
that indicate that the sprinkler system was working,'' Giuliani said. 
``However, there's this question: `Did anybody inspect the valves'' 
that feed the sprinklers? ``We don't know the answer to that yet.'' 
Officials believe that the fire was caused by an elderly woman smoking 
in bed. In addition to studying why the sprinkler system was shut 
off, officials are trying to determine why a self-closing steel fire 
door malfunctioned and remained ajar, allowing a fireball to engulf 
the three firefighters in the 10th-floor hallway. A fire department 
official who spoke on the condition of anonymity said that the hallway 
temperature had reached 2,000 degrees and that the firefighters' protective 
suits can withstand heat only up to 700 degrees. Ruth Colon, a spokeswoman 
for the Housing Authority, said the intense heat made the fire door 
malfunction, and that doors on neighboring apartments were working 
fine after the fire. ``No clue,'' Ms. Colon said when asked why the 
sprinklers were off and the fire door open. ``This is the mystery 
that we are trying to find: Why was the main one open and every other 
one was closed? We are investigating every possibility.'' Ms. Colon 
said that despite searching all night Friday, officials had been unable 
to find recent inspection records on the sprinklers. Fire department 
officials spent all morning in meetings but emerged with little information 
about what had gone wrong at the building. ``We're planning funerals 
here,'' said Michael Regan, a deputy fire commissioner. Funerals for 
the victims, Lt. Joseph Cavalieri and firefighters James Bohan and 
Christopher Bopp, are scheduled for Monday and Tuesday. Jacqueline 
Pinder, 67, the woman who lived in the apartment where the fire started, 
was listed in critical condition Saturday at Jacobi Medical Center 
in the Bronx, along with her neighbor Angel Morales, 69, who pulled 
Ms. Pinder into the safety of his apartment. Five firefighters who 
were injured fighting the blaze were in good condition and were expected 
to be released from hospitals this weekend, officials said. At the 
10-story apartment building, police, fire, and housing department 
officials were cleaning up soot and soggy rugs, and relatives of the 
elderly residents swarmed in to check on their loved ones. ``It was 
a tragedy, but they're lucky that more people weren't killed,'' said 
Andrew Malave, 40, whose mother lives on the eighth floor. ``With 
all these elderly people, these sprinklers should not be turned off.'' 
Malave and other residents and their relatives wondered whether the 
sprinklers were shut because of recent construction in the building, 
including repairs to the elevators. ``Nothing here ever works,'' said 
Gloria Bryant, 73, who has lived in the building for three years. 
Ms. Bryant said there was a fire a year ago and the fire alarms failed, 
but it was a small blaze and was contained. ``Something is always 
wrong,'' she said. Outside the building, firefighter Mike Fazio was 
helping assess the damage, remembering Bopp, who was in his class 
at the training academy. ``The whole thing is horrible, really crushing,'' 
said Fazio, who last saw Bopp at a Christmas party last week. ``It's 
been hard on everybody and everybody's families. Everybody is still 
in shock from this.''
