Looking at a picture at the White House of President Clinton emerging 
to give his address to the nation. The president has been meeting 
with house democratic leaders this afternoon. You see Dick Gephardt 
and vice President Gore joining him. We are expecting he will call 
for some sort of national reconciliation. The first lady is there 
as well. She has been fairly quiet on the subject of the vote in the 
house. She has not come out and said anything directly in defense 
of president clinton. We are anticipating that he will not resign, 
although that call has come from several republicans, including Bob 
Livingston who resigned himself today. He said he would serve as an 
example. He called on the president to do the same. The democrats 
saying that will not happen. The president is not about to resign 
his post. You saw them come out, we thought the president would address 
the nation now. He has gone back into the oval office. We expected 
him to address us from that podium.
