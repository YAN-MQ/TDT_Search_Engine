Canadian authorities have finished identifying the remains of the 
passengers and crew on Swissair Flight 111, the MD-11 that crashed 
off the coast of Nova Scotia, and the airline will begin returning 
them to families soon, the Nova Scotia medical examiner said Friday. 
Flight 111 crashed Sept. 2 after leaving Kennedy International Airport 
for Switzerland. With help from the Canadian armed forces and the 
Royal Canadian Mounted Police, and with heavy reliance on DNA testing, 
the medical examiner identified all of the 229 people on board except 
a pair of identical twins, 19-year-old men from Switzerland, whose 
DNA was indistinguishable. People involved in the investigation said 
1,300 DNA tests were conducted, the most in connection with a single 
event. Some remains were identified by dental records or other means. 
Some remains cannot be identified as those of a specific person and 
will be buried ``at an appropriate site in Nova Scotia,'' said the 
provincial Medical Examiner, Dr. John Butt. Families of all the victims 
were notified that 17 ``small pieces of dental remains'' were accidentally 
incinerated at a laboratory in Halifax, Nova Scotia, where they had 
been sent for identification. In his letter of notification to the 
families earlier this week, Butt called it ``a most unfortunate occurrence.'' 
Investigators are still searching the Atlantic Ocean bottom for plane 
parts and human remains, but if any remains are recovered now, after 
three months in the water, the soft tissue that can be typed by DNA 
is no longer usable for testing, Butt said in a telephone interview 
on Friday. Remains of each person aboard the plane are available and 
will be returned, he said. Miles Gerety of Stamford, Conn., the brother 
of a passenger and now the acting chairman of an organization of families 
of Flight 111 victims, said families could choose to bury the remains 
in Halifax, scatter ashes at sea or have the remains sent home. Gerety 
said some families would probably delay burial until the authorities 
turn over personal effects, especially wedding bands. A spokesman 
for the Royal Canadian Mounted Police, Sgt. Bill Price, said that 
no passengers' belongings had been turned over to relatives yet because 
his agency was still gathering evidence. Investigators continue to 
search the sea bottom, turning up small parts of the plane and human 
remains, according to Jim Harris, a spokesman for the Transportation 
Safety Board of Canada. Harris said the flight data recorder, a computer 
recording device that tracks hundreds of aspects of flight, was working 
normally when the pilots first radioed a distress call. It stopped 
recording six minutes before the crash. The first sign of trouble 
was the autopilot disconnecting itself. The autopilot is supposed 
to disconnect if it cannot keep the plane flying the way the pilots 
have ordered and turn control back to them, but so far investigators 
do not know what prompted the disconnection.
