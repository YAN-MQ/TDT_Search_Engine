For P.T. Usha, a medal at her last Asian Games would have been a dream 
finish to a remarkably long career that has made her an Indian track 
legend. But it wasn't to be. Usha, 33, bowed out from her fifth Asian 
Games without running Saturday in what had been expected to be her 
last race. Plagued by a hamstring injury and feeling low after performing 
poorly earlier in the week, Usha was left out of the 4 x 400 Indian 
squad in Saturday's final. ``I feel sorry. I wanted that her last 
race would be graceful,'' said her coach, Jasvinder Bhutia. ``It is 
a sad dismissal.'' Usha burst into Indian athletics 20 years ago as 
a shy 13-year-old in pigtails. Since then, she has picked up four 
gold and seven silver Asian Games medals and come closest to being 
the first Indian to win an Olympic track and field medal, missing 
bronze by 0.01 seconds in the 400-meter hurdles at the 1984 games. 
She emerged from retirement to run in the Asian Track Championships 
in Fukuoka, Japan, this July. She was third, in 23.46 seconds, in 
the 200 and anchored India's victorious 4 x 100 relay. Usha also anchored 
India's silver medal team in 4 x 400, which finished .16 seconds behind 
China. But her training for the Bangkok games was disrupted by a heel 
injury and a hamstring strained at a November meet in the eastern 
city of Calcutta, when she collapsed in the 200. The injuries effectively 
ruined Usha's swan song. She did not qualify for the 200 final and 
was sixth in the 400, her favorite event. The poor results led to 
her missing Saturday's final. India's team doctor, Rakesh Kaushal, 
said her confidence was also ``a little bit on the low side'' to run 
following her disappointing earlier races. ``We have a better girl,'' 
said Lalit Bhanot, secretary of the Amateur Athletic Federation of 
India. ``We knew that she wasn't going to do well.'' Usha said Indian 
officials told her Friday that she would not be running. But she made 
clear she thought she could have competed. ``If I can run in the 200 
semifinals and the 400 semifinals and final I can run in the 400 meters 
relay also,'' she said. ``It is bad luck. Without injury, she has 
such will power that she definitely would have won a medal,'' her 
coach said. Usha watched from the stands Saturday as India's women 
got silver in the race. She said she would go to the next Asian Games 
in the year 2002 but only as a spectator. ``I can't run, I have to 
see that,'' she said.
