democrats point to polls showing the majority of americans are against 
impeach nent. they argue he should not be removed from office when 
the country and congress are so divided. a few republicans are joining 
them in saying his discretions are not impeachable. but they acknowledge 
their position won't win the day. in a few minutes, the president 
of the united states, william jefferson clinton, will be impeached. 
but he will not be impeached with my vote. i cast my vote with no 
criticism of those who think differently, and who will vote differently. 
we've all tried to do our best, and we will all have to live with 
our vote the rest of our lives. my prayers are for this country and 
its people, our president, and his family, and for the house of representatives 
and all of its members.
