Tonight, President Clinton declared the bombing campaign in Iraq has 
ended. And that the mission has been accomplished. ABC's John McWethy 
is at the Pentagon. The campaign ended after 70 hours of intense air 
strikes. We have inflicted significant damagen Saddam's weapons of 
mass destruction programs. On the command structures that direct and 
protect that capability, and on his military and security infrastructure. 
We estimate that Saddam's missile program has been set back by at 
least a Year. Other critical targets were purposely ignored. No attempt 
was made to hit any of the so-called dual use facilities, such as 
fertile lieser or pharmaceutical plants that could be quickly converted 
to mass produce chemical or biological weapons. We did not target 
those facilities because of the concern we have for the amount of 
damage to innocent civilians. As the air strikes ended, the administration 
was left with the tough question of, what next? An even larger American 
military presence will have to be permanently stationed in the Persian 
gulf, and air strikes may soon be needed again, all to enforce a policy 
that is increasingly unpopular even among some of america's best friends. 
John McWethy, ABC News, the Pentagon.
