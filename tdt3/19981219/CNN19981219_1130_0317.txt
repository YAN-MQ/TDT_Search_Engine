right now on the house floor democrats are demanding a vote on the 
lesser penalty of censure before republicans bring the articles of 
impeachment to a vote. republicans are expected to deny them the option 
of censuring president clinton. if that happens, democrats have said 
they'll walk out of the chamber, at least temporarily, in protest.
