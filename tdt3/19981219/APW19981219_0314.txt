Pope John Paul II was feeling better Saturday after a day of rest 
to combat a light flu and he has resumed his audiences, the Vatican 
said. On Friday, Vatican spokesman Joaquin Navarro-Valls said the 
flu, accompanied by a fever of 38 degrees Celsius (100 F), forced 
the pope to cancel that day's appointments. But by Saturday morning 
the pope was doing better and went ahead with a private meeting with 
the patriach of Antioch, Ignace Moussa I Dauod, in the early afternoon, 
the Vatican said. John Paul used the audience as an occasion to call 
for more collaboration between Catholics who follow the Eastern rite, 
as does the patriarch, and Orthodox Christians. The pope was scheduled 
to appear at noon Sunday at his studio window overlooking St. Peter's 
Square to give his weekly blessing. The flu hit at the start of the 
busy holiday period for the frail pope, who no longer celebrates Mass 
Christmas morning in St. Peter's Basilica to allow himself more time 
to rest after midnight Mass Christmas eve. The pope is scheduled to 
journey to Mexico and St. Louis, Missouri, in January.
