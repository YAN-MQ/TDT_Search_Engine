Local leaders of India's ruling party plan to send holiday greeting 
cards with pictures of a mushroom cloud to celebrate this year's nuclear 
tests. Lawmakers and members of the right-wing Bharatiya Janata Party 
in Uttar Pradesh state said the tests were the biggest achievement 
so far this year. The party is in control of the government in Uttar 
Pradesh, India's most populous state. In the past, political parties 
and lawmakers have mailed greeting cards with innocuous messages or 
illustrations. The cards, sent to celebrate the new year, contain 
a decidedly more political message this year. The Congress Party, 
the main opposition group in India, designed cards showing onions 
_ whose sixfold price hike in recent weeks was among the reasons the 
BJP lost three crucial state elections recently. The socialist Samajwadi 
Party is designing a card showing the BJP's alleged anti-Muslim attitude 
and the reported connection of BJP lawmakers with criminals in Uttar 
Pradesh. The Bahujan Samaj Party, which represents low-caste Hindus, 
is also planning to print cards highlighting what it calls rampant 
corruption in the state administration.
