Republican leaders are refusing to allow a vote on censure as an alternative 
to impeachment. Democrats say that's a prime example of partisan politics. 
If the republicans do not allow a vote on censure, I feel that I am 
a Member of the Duma or of the reichstag. Only a totalitarian legislative 
body would the majority deny what is a Minority, the right to present 
an option on an issue which is supported by the majority of the people.
