For all you aviation buffs, there's a web site that will fly you back 
in time. We'll take you there. Here's a web site that will have aviation 
buffs flying high. Zeno's warbird video drive-in at the address shown 
below, features a number of world war II aviation training films that 
will acquaint you with the bombers and fighters of the era. This isn't 
exactly top gun. These detailed films show you that you had to do 
more than just kick the tires and light the fires to get these magnificent 
flying machines of yesteryear off the ground. This is just part of 
what it took to start up an F-4 U corsair. With ignition off, the 
prop is pulled through three or four times to clear the cylinder. 
A cartridge is placed in the breach of the starter which is reached 
through a door in the accessory compartment. Various charts and photos 
also give you a closeup view of these classic planes. Some of these 
films include tips on bailing out. But always remember, this rule 
of aerial combat. The object isn't to bail out of your ship, it's 
to make the other fellow bail out of his. CNN.com/online can link 
you to this and other sites. And that's what's "on-line."
