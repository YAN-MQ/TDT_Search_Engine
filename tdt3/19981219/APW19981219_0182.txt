Palestinians clashed violently with Israeli troops after a pro-Iraq 
demonstration Saturday, hurling stones and firebombs at soldiers, 
who fired back rubber bullets. Forty-four marchers were hurt. The 
rally in the West Bank town of Hebron and a smaller one in the Gaza 
Strip town of Rafah came in defiance of a Palestinian police ban on 
pro-Iraq demonstrations. In Rafah, about 400 Palestinian protesters 
burned U.S. and British flags. Police dispersed them, but without 
using force. In Hebron, Palestinian police did not attempt to restrain 
about 3,000 marchers as they set out from Hebron University, some 
wearing black hoods or masked with keffiyehs, carrying posters of 
Iraqi president Saddam Hussein. They waved Iraqi flags and screamed 
``Death to Israel _ death to America!'' When the marchers reached 
the center of Hebron _ the site of several Jewish settlements and 
a frequent flashpoint _ about 400 protesters broke away from the main 
rally and threw stones and firebombs at Israeli troops. The soldiers 
responded with volleys of rubber bullets. Amid pitched battles in 
the winding, cramped downtown streets, soldiers and protesters alike 
ducked into shops and doorways for cover. At one point, with stones 
raining down on them, about 20 Israeli soldiers grouped and charged 
stone-throwers, firing rubber bullets as they ran forward. Of the 
44 Palestinians hurt by rubber-coated bullets, at least one was hurt 
critically, hospital officials said. Finally, after about two hours, 
Palestinian police moved in and began dispersing the demonstrators. 
The Iraq crisis poses a dilemma for the Palestinian leadership. On 
the one hand, it is anxious to rein in the unmitigated backing Palestinians 
gave Saddam during the 1991 Gulf War _ a stance that set back the 
Palestinian cause in the West. At the same time, however, Arafat's 
government apparently wants to allow some outlet for Palestinian street 
sentiment in favor of Iraq. Official Palestinian radio on Saturday 
played patriotic songs. The Hebron rally drew Palestinian political 
groups from across the political spectrum, ranging from the radical 
Islamic group Hamas to Yasser Arafat's Fatah faction. Fatah's participation 
came despite a declaration by Arafat's own police chief in Gaza that 
such demonstrations were banned. On Friday, Palestinian authorities 
also shut down media broadcasting pro-Iraqi sentiments and detained 
journalists _ including some working for foreign media outlets _ who 
covered pro-Iraqi unrest. The Gaza City bureau of The Associated Press 
was closed down by the authorities, and remained shut on Saturday. 
The Palestinian journalists' syndicate called a strike starting Saturday 
to protest the curbs on their coverage, and said they would stage 
a sit-in at the Palestinian legislative council on Monday.
