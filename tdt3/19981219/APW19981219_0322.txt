Italy's Kristian Ghedina won Saturday's World Cup downhill race in 
Val Gardena _ the second of back-to-back speed races here + ending 
the winning streak of Norwegian Lasse Kjus and extending the winless 
series of the Austrians. Ghedina captured his tenth World Cup career 
victory in a replay of his 1996 (cq) triumph in this northern valley 
when he won the second of consecutive downhills. ``I did not ski a 
perfect race. I made some mistakes. But it does not matter when you 
win,'' said Ghedina, as he carried his 4-year-old brother Luca shoulder 
on at the finish line. ``He brings me good luck. He was here two years 
ago, and I won the race,'' Ghedina added, after hugging the brother. 
The 29-year-old skier from Cortina d'Ampezzo clocked a winning time 
of two minutes, 4.17 seconds down the 3,495-meter long Saslong course, 
dropping 839 meters. Kjus, winner of the two previous World Cup downhills, 
finished runnerup, 0.14 seconds behind. Second place kept the Norwegian 
skier atop the World Cup overall standings, with 493 points after 
ten races. Werner Franz edged Austrian teammate Hermann Maier for 
third place, 0.28 seconds behind the winner. The two Austrians had 
placed second and third respectively, behind Kjus, in Friday's downhill 
making up for the race canceled in Whistler Mountain, canada, earlier 
this month. Maier, the defending World Cup champion, complained that 
a race stewart disturbed his run crossing the course as he was coming 
down. The jury rejected a complaint by the Austrian team because Maier 
did not stop and made it to the finish line, still placing fourth 
with a gap of 0.48. Maier said later he could have hardly beaten Ghedina, 
even in absence of the disturbing presence of the steward who was 
rushing to help a fallen competitor. The Austrians are winless in 
three downhill races this season after starting the season triumphantly 
in the other three disciplines of the World Cup. Ghedina's time Saturday 
was nearly two seconds slower than Kjus' winning time the previous 
day, over the same icy course and distance. The Italian skier had 
placed fourth Friday and a distant 45th in the first season downhill 
at Val D'Isere last week. The race was marred by a bad spill of Olympic 
downhill champion Jean-Luc Cretier. The Frenchman tore the cruciate 
ligament of his left knee. Cretier, who had won the Olympic title 
in Nagano this year beating Kjus, fell at an icy section shortly after 
the start, skidded off the track and fell over a ridge of snow and 
grass. He was taken by helicoper to the nearby hospital of Bressanone 
(Brixen). Mauro Cornaz, coach of the French downhill team, said Cretier 
suffered a season-ending torn ligament, bruises in his face and in 
his hands. Two other skiers, American Ehlias Louis and France's David 
Pretot, torn knee ligaments in falls during Friday's race. The men's 
World Cup circuit continues Sunday with a giant slalom at nearby Alta 
Badia.
