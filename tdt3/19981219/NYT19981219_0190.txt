On the Jets, there is the team within the team. Call them the Parcells 
10, those who had worked for Bill Parcells with the New England Patriots 
or with the Giants or, in the case of the latest member, David Meggett, 
who worked for the coach with both the Patriots and the Giants. Of 
the 10, no two are the same. Some, like Meggett, are considered club 
pros _ Jumbo Elliott, Pepper Johnson, Keith Byars, Otis Smith, Jerome 
Henderson. Two are mostly on special teams, Corwin Brown and Mike 
Gisler. One is a third-string quarterback, Ray Lucas. And one, Curtis 
Martin, is a $36 million running back. Their positions and responsibilities 
vary. So do their salaries. But to Parcells, the 10 have a common 
denominator. ``They like football, they're willing to work, and winning 
means something to them,'' he said. ``It's not about money.'' It's 
mostly about understanding and appreciating what makes Parcells such 
a successful coach. Meggett knows all about that. Before the Jets 
beat the Bills 17-10 here on Saturday, clinching first place in the 
American Conference East, Meggett explained why he enjoyed working 
for Parcells. ``The knowledge the coach brings to the game,'' Meggett 
said. ``The businesslike atmosphere.'' As the most recent member of 
what is now the Parcells 10, Meggett also enjoyed seeing familiar 
faces in the locker room. ``It's a feeling of home,'' he said. ``So 
many guys I played with. That's a good feeling.'' And those Meggett 
played with on the Patriots and earlier on the Giants remember what 
Meggett did. Byars, now a Jets fullback, cited the Patriots' 23-22 
victory over the Giants in the 1996 season finale, when Meggett's 
touchdown on a 60-yard punt return pulled the Patriots to within 22-17 
in the fourth quarter. That victory clinched first place and a playoff 
bye for the Patriots on their way to Super Bowl XXXI. ``No matter 
how much they pay you,'' Byars said, ``it's not going to make you 
make a play, make a catch.'' Elliott, the offensive tackle, remembered 
several Meggett moments when they were on the Giants together. ``David 
made big plays,'' Elliott said. ``Whether it was a return or a run 
or a catch or throwing a pass.'' Meggett twice threw option passes 
for Giant touchdowns against the Redskins in 1993. As a Giant rookie 
in 1989, he took a short pass from Phil Simms and scooted 57 yards 
in a swirling snowstorm for the winning touchdown in a 14-7 victory 
in Denver. When Meggett was a free agent after the 1994 season, Parcells, 
then in New England, quickly signed him to a five-year, $10 million 
contract that included a $3 million signing bonus. Over his career, 
Meggett, now 32, who last Tuesday signed a two-game contract for $60,000, 
has scored 27 touchdowns _ 11 on pass receptions, 8 as a rusher, 7 
on punt returns and 1 on a kickoff return. He is the National Football 
League's career leader in punt returns, 344, and punt-return yardage, 
3,668. Oddly enough, when Parcells was coaching the Giants, he had 
resisted using a 1989 fifth-round draft choice on Meggett, who had 
been the Division I-AA player of the year at Towson State. Although 
a sturdy 180 pounds, Meggett was only 5 feet 7 inches, and Parcells 
already had a 5-7 running back, Joe Morris. ``How else can I use him?'' 
Parcells asked the Giants' scouts. Use him, the scouts suggested, 
on a pitchout or a reverse. ``What do you guys think this is, the 
Blue-Gray game?'' Parcells snapped, but then he said, ``All right, 
let's take him, but I'm telling you right now, if he can't return 
kickoffs and punts, I'm going to cut him.'' Parcells not only didn't 
cut Meggett, he also brought Meggett to the Patriots. And now Meggett 
is one of the Parcells 10 on the Jets. ``We all played for Bill,'' 
Elliott said. ``Football was different when most of us started. You 
had to earn your way more.'' Signing Meggett paid off quickly for 
Parcells on Saturday. On the Jets' first drive, Meggett picked up 
22 yards on a draw play to help set up Vinny Testaverde's 7-yard touchdown 
pass to Wayne Chrebet. Elliott, who joined the Giants in 1988, played 
three seasons for Parcells; in the 20-19 victory in Super Bowl XXV, 
he blocked Bruce Smith, the Bills' feared pass-rusher. Elliott joined 
the Jets as a free agent in 1996; the next year Parcells was happy 
to inherit him. But when Elliott was told about Parcells' reference 
to ``It's not about money'' for the Parcells 10, he smiled. ``Winning 
means a lot to us,'' the 308-pound, 6-foot-7-inch offensive tackle 
said, ``but we wouldn't do it for free.''
