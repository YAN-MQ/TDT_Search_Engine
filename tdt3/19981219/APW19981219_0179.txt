Moscow Mayor Yuri Luzhkov Saturday called on all Russians to unite 
under a new political movement to restore the country to its position 
as a leading world power. Luzhkov, speaking at the founding congress 
of the Fatherland movement, urged ``workers, farmers, intelligentsia 
and military servicemen'' to unite in the name of Russia, the Interfax 
news agency reported. ``Join us,'' he said. ``We are facing very difficult 
and immensely important tasks.'' Luzhkov launched the political movement 
in November, apparently to support his likely presidential bid in 
2000. He said Fatherland's goal was to ensure Russia's development 
as a market economy with a strong state sector drawing support from 
both the left and right of the political spectrum. Luzhkov called 
for a revival of the defense industry and the country's nuclear forces 
to restore Russia to a position of one of the world's eight leading 
powers. ``We need a modern army, a reliable nuclear deterrence system,'' 
Luzhkov told the 1,123 delegates to the congress. ``The international 
community needs a strong Russia as a great power that respects itself 
and other powers,'' he said, according to the ITAR-Tass news agency. 
Domestically, he said he wanted to create a state system ``based on 
social democracy and a combination of market-economy methods and social 
policies.'' Luzhkov lashed out at government reformists, and said 
they had not accomplished anything significant. ``Due to the radical 
reforms implemented in Russia in the past few years, the country has 
begun turning into a dump site,'' the mayor said. ``If the situation 
in the country remains as it was, we will all be up against some serious 
trouble.'' So far, Luzhkov has not said outright that he would run 
for president. The mayor is popular in Moscow, and has strong ratings 
in opinion polls. However, it is unclear how strong a popular following 
he has in Russia's outlying regions, where many resent the capital's 
relative prosperity. Others expected to run in 2000 are Communist 
leader Gennady Zyuganov, liberal politician Grigory Yavlinsky, former 
Prime Minister Viktor Chernomyrdin and Alexander Lebed, a former general 
who is now governor of a vast region in Siberia.
