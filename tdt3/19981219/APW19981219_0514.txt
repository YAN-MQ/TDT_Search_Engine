Japanese Prime Minister Keizo Obuchi announced late Saturday a formal 
agreement to launch a coalition government with a minority opposition 
party in a move designed to ease the passage of key legislation. The 
political deal, which calls for eliminating two Cabinet posts to signal 
a commitment to government streamlining, follows a tentative accord 
reached last month. It forges a link between Obuchi's Liberal Democratic 
Party and the Liberal Party headed by bigwig pol Ichiro Ozawa, who 
bolted from the ranks of the LDP in 1993. The move appeared likely 
to give the government a stronger hand in Parliament to pass promised 
economic stimulus measures. Prime Minister Obuchi has come under increasing 
pressure both at home and abroad to jump start his nation's economy, 
which is stuck in its worst recession since World War II. ``We have 
agreed to work together to seek ways to overcome these difficult times,'' 
Obuchi said at a hastily-arranged midnight news conference following 
last minute talks with the Liberal Party. ``And I'm confident that 
we can solve tough issues through our coalition.'' A new coalition 
government will be launched before the next regular Parliamentary 
session begins in mid-January, Obuchi said. He did not specify what 
changes would be made when the Cabinet is reshuffled _ or which posts 
would be eliminated by shrinking the number of ministers from 20 to 
18. Liberal Party head Ozawa made it clear at a separate news conference 
that his party wants to be fully represented in the Cabinet, however. 
``It's a coalition Cabinet, so I'm relying on common sense,'' he said 
of his party's expectations for ministerial posts. The Liberal Party's 
93 seats in the more powerful 500-seat lower house of Parliament, 
added to the ruling Liberal Democrats' 262 seats, will assure swift 
passage of bills. It will also give the governing party a boost in 
the upper house, where it lacks a majority. With the backing of the 
Liberal Party, Obuchi's ruling LDP is betting it can attract enough 
independent lawmaker votes in the upper house to override any objections 
made by opposition party forces. The two parties are both viewed as 
conservative forces in Parliament. Many Liberal Party lawmakers were 
once members of the Liberal Democratic Party. Ozawa originally left 
the ruling party five years ago, vowing to offer a real opposition 
alternative and end the Liberal Democrats' four decades of political 
dominance. Although Ozawa was a key backer of reform-oriented administrations 
in 1993-94, he was viewed as too closely linked with the old-style 
ruling party kingpins to gain much popularity among voters. In his 
talks with Prime Minister Obuchi, Ozawa initially played hard to get 
by demanding a reduction in the number of Cabinet posts to 17 and 
the temporary abolition of an unpopular national sales tax. But the 
tax issue eventually was dropped and the LDP simply agreed to ``review'' 
other policy reforms pushed by Ozawa such as a re-interpretation of 
national defense guidelines. The Asahi Shimbun, a major daily, warned 
in an editorial in its early Sunday edition that the coalition could 
bode a turn to the political right in the formulation of government 
policies. ``There is a danger the coalition may shift government policy 
on issues such as national security and interpretation of the constitution'' 
toward a more conservative view, the paper said.
