i will remember you will you remember me in december, every minute 
you talk on at&t will mean an at&t donation don't let your life to 
the american red cross. the more calls you make, pass you by... the 
more help we can give. and i will remember you this year, why not 
reach out to everyone you love, so we can all reach out to those who 
need it most. will you remember me man: mud holes. dirt roads. most 
people wouldn't !!think of driving through stuff like that. but then, 
that's the beauty of subaru all-wheel drive. it automatically transfers 
power from the wheels that slip to the wheels that grip. which means 
it does the thinking for you. SORRY MATE... GUESS I WASN'T THINKIN'.
