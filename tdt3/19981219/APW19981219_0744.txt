LIBREVILLE, Gabon (AP) _ U.S. diplomats and aid workers in Gabon attended 
a memorial service in the capital Saturday to mourn a Peace Corps 
volunteer who police said was raped and stabbed to death two days 
earlier. The partially-naked body of Karen Phillips, 37, was discovered 
in the forest about 200 meters from her home in the logging town of 
Oyem, about 190 miles (320 kilometers) northwest of the capital, a 
police spokesman said on condition of anonymity. Three people were 
arrested on Friday in connection with the death but their identities 
had not been released and it was not clear if they knew the victim.
