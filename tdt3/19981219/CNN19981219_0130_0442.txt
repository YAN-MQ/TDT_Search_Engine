Former White House press secretary Mike McCurry is speaking out about 
his old boss. McCurry says he had enormous doubts about President 
Clinton after his handling of the Monica Lewinsky matter. McCurry 
told "BBC newsnight" -- "I feel deeply disappointed, hurt and a bit 
flabbergasted he could be so reckless. He cannot suffer any more personal 
embarrassment. The question is how much do we all have to suffer at 
this point?" McCurry left the White House in October after serving 
President Clinton for almost four years.
