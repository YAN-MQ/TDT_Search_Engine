Clay Blair, an author who wrote extensively on World War II and the 
Korean War and was a former editor of The Saturday Evening Post, died 
Wednesday at his home on Washington Island, Wis. He was 73. He suffered 
a heart attack, said his agent, Russell Galen. In World War II, Blair 
served aboard the submarine Guardfish, participating in its last two 
patrols off Japan. In the 1950s, when he covered national security 
affairs as a magazine correspondent, Blair got to know many of the 
wartime skippers and made ``dives'' in postwar submarines. Those experiences 
inspired a deep and abiding interest in submarine warfare and led 
to a series of books in which Blair told the story of the ``silent 
service.'' Many of his 26 books focused on military history. In the 
first, ``The Atomic Submarine and Admiral Rickover'' (Henry Holt, 
1954), Blair told of the development of nuclear-powered submarines. 
He collaborated with Comdr. William Anderson in ``Nautilus 90 North'' 
(World, 1959), an account of the first submarine voyage beneath the 
North Pole. Blair wrote of heroic exploits as well as failures in 
American leadership and of design problems like defective torpedoes 
in ``Silent Victory: The U.S. Submarine War Against Japan'' (J.B. 
Lippincott, 1975). Robert Trumbull wrote in The New York Times that 
the book was ``the definitive work, not only on submarine warfare 
in general but also on a controversial chapter in American military 
history.'' Over the last 10 years Blair worked on the two-volume ``Hitler's 
U-Boat War'' (Random House, 1996 and 1998), in which he concluded 
that the German submarine menace had been ``vastly overblown'' in 
many historical accounts. Blair provided a wide-ranging look at the 
Korean War in ``The Forgotten War'' (Times Books, 1987), collaborated 
with Gen. Omar Bradley, a commander of Army forces in World War II, 
in ``A General's Life'' (Simon &AMP; Schuster, 1983) and described 
American airborne operations in World War II in ``Ridgway's Paratroopers'' 
(Dial, 1985). Blair and his co-author, James Shepley, stirred controversy 
with ``The Hydrogen Bomb'' (David McKay, 1954), maintaining that the 
race by the United States against the Soviet Union to develop the 
bomb was hampered by opposition from the nuclear physicist J. Robert 
Oppenheimer and his supporters. Rear Adm. Lewis Strauss, chairman 
of the Atomic Energy Commission, made an unsuccessful effort to buy 
the manuscript with the intention of locking it in a safe until most 
of the principal figures in the book had died. Blair and his wife, 
Joan, collaborated on several books, including ``The Search for J.F.K.'' 
(Berkley/Putnam's, 1976), an account of John F. Kennedy's younger 
years. Blair, a native of Lexington, Va., attended Tulane University 
and then Columbia, leaving in 1949 to become a reporter-trainee at 
Time magazine. He was Washington correspondent for Time and Life from 
1950 to 1957, then joined the Washington bureau of The Saturday Evening 
Post, which was owned by the Curtis Publishing Co. Blair was editor 
in chief of all Curtis magazines and served as editor of The Post 
in the early 1960s. With a goal of ``sophisticated muckraking,'' Blair 
sought exclusive articles for The Post. But several libel suits were 
brought against the magazine, including a highly publicized case in 
which Wally Butts, the athletic director and former football coach 
at the University of Georgia, won a $460,000 judgment involving an 
article alleging game-fixing. In 1964, with Curtis ailing financially, 
Blair was a leader in a rebellion by 15 editors and advertising employees 
who demanded that the Curtis board oust Matthew J. Culligan, the president, 
chairman and chief executive of the company, charging mismanagement. 
The turmoil resulted in the departure of both Blair and Culligan. 
After that, Blair devoted himself exclusively to free-lance writing. 
Besides his wife, Blair is survived by six children from his marriage 
to the former Agnes Devereux: four sons, Clay 3rd of Germany, Kemp 
and Robert of Boulder, Colo., and Christopher of Washington and two 
daughters, Marie Louise Houle of Amherst, Mass., and Sibyl Dance of 
Palm City, Fla. He is also survived by two stepsons, David West of 
Greenville, Texas, and Christopher West of Denver, and five grandchildren.
