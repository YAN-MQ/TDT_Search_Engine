Iraqi President Saddam Hussein went on television Friday to urge his 
people to continue their resistance to the allied bombings. In a taped 
address, Hussein said he would not "compromise or kneel" in the showdown 
nor "let evil triumph over virtue." After his speech, Iraqi commanders 
said they had shot down 77 cruise missiles so far. The Pentagon disputes 
that.
