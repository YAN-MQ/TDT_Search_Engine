British jets attacked a regional headquarters of the Republican Guard 
in overnight raids which also targeted air defense and a battle tank 
storage area, a senior military officer said Saturday. Gen. Sir Charles 
Guthrie, chief of the defense staff, estimated that the attacks achieved 
75 percent of their objectives, without losing any of Britain's 12 
Kuwait-based Tornado fighter-bombers. Prime Minister Tony Blair said 
in a broadcast interview that that the United States and Britain had 
struck against President Saddam Hussein ``because we genuinely believe 
the stability of the world is at risk if this man's allowed to get 
back out of his cage.'' Defense Secretary George Robertson, who joined 
Guthrie at a news briefing, said the Republican Guard was targeted 
because of its role in protecting Saddam as well as guarding the chemical 
and biological weapons programs which are the prime targets of the 
U.S-British operation. ``We want the Republican Guard to know that 
the cozy life they have led under Saddam is under attack,'' Robertson 
said. Britain released video images of laser-guided bombs hitting 
Republican Guard facilities at Al Kut, 100 miles (160 kms) southeast 
of Baghdad, and the nearby Muhammad Al Amin garrison. Robertson said 
U.S. and British analysts were continuing to assess damage and he 
would not say whether the attacks would continue. ``We are absolutely 
determined to reduce the threat that Saddam poses to the countries 
of the Middle East, the Gulf states,'' Robert said, adding: ``When 
we believe that threat has been lifted, we will stop the operation.'' 
Guthrie said the U.S. and British operations were more intense than 
on the previous night, but that British jets encountered less antiaircraft 
fire. Guthrie said leaflets dropped by U.S. and British planes in 
Iraq had warned the regular army to stay out of the conflict. He said 
the message was ``Keep out of this, you are not our targets, remain 
in your barracks.'' ``And I think it is a message which has got across,'' 
Guthrie said. He added that there had been no reports of Iraqi aircraft 
challenging the attacking forces. Blair, in an interview with the 
BBC World Service, said he regretted civilian casualties but said 
the military operation was necessary. ``If we hadn't taken action 
now then he knows we lack the will to prevent him developing these 
weapons,'' Blair said. ``I think the Iraqi people know who's responsible 
for keeping them in a state of poverty ... he's turned virtually the 
entirety of his country into a semi-military complex for his own purposes.''
