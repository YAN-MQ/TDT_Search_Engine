Looking again now at the White House lawn on the south grounds, which 
is outside of the oval office, the president expected in moments to 
make his address, the first time we will have heard from him as an 
impeached president. This is the second time that a president of the 
United States has been impeached by the full House of Representatives. 
The last time, 130 years ago. We're expecting him to emerge momentarily. 
He's been meeting with democratic leaders.
