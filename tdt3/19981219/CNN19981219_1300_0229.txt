A shocking development occurred during this morning's debate on the 
four articles of impeachment against President Clinton. Speaker-designate 
Bob Livingston announced he will not accept the speakership January 
6th. He also said he will resign his house seat in six months and 
ask louisiana's governor to call a special election. Livingston admitted 
days ago he had several extramarital affairs. As he announced his 
decision, Livingston called on President Clinton to follow his lead.
