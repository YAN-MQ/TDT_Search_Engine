The world of politics has seldom been a place for the timid. But lately, 
some of the political dialogue has been getting unusually rough, especially 
in the impeachment debate over President Clinton. Bruce Morton reports. 
Meaner, this place is getting meaner. You can see it as the debate 
began. The rules prohibit members from engaging in generally personal 
abusive language toward the president and also, from enganling in 
comparisons to personal conduct of sitting members of either house 
of Congress. Some members who were leaving talked about how it has 
changed. Now we are routinely using criminal accusations and scandal 
to win the political battles and ideal logical things we can't settle 
at the ballot box. It bothers me that the com raudry D that does not 
exist anymore. When did it start? It contains no reference to any 
mention of judge Thomas' private parts or sexual prowl ES. Maybe when 
the Senate didn't confirm John tower with lots of references maybe 
he drank or womanized. Certainly the quality of our mercy has been 
diminished because of the tower affair. Speaker Jim writhe resigned, 
Tom Foley had to Con front rumors he was dwa. Congressman Barney Frank 
openly gay had to hear this. A slip of the tongue Barney said if it 
isn't in there, it can't be said. Then there was Newt Gingrich complaining 
about his seat on the way to a Funeral. I can tell you this. If it 
would get the government open, I would be glad to tell him I'm sorry. 
Did the politicians start it? Or is the whole country meaner than 
it used to be. Lately it has been sex, not just the president but 
congressman Hyde, burton, Bob Livingston confessing affairs. Private 
conduct is becoming a manner of public notice. It will drive a lot 
of good people out of public service. Nobody wants their families 
interfered with in this way. Campaign 2000 is just getting started. 
Would you want your child to run for public office. Bruise more tin, 
CNN, Washington.
