How will they judge President Clinton? I'm so clogged up. I just can't 
focus. You okay? No...if this meeting doesn't go well... it's all 
that work wasted. You've gotta stay focused. I'll find a way. Clear 
the congestion with tavist-D. Prescription strength. just one gives 
you 12 hours of uninterrupted relief. To get that, you'd need four 
Tylenol cold pills. Tavist-D clears your congestion so you're clear-heed 
again. Why be congested? Be clear-headed, clear through your day with 
tavist-D. No, this isn't a jeans commercial. It's about constipation. 
You're bloated-- not yourself. Your size 10's feel like 2's. Fibercon 
has natural fiber action... to relieve bloating cstipation. I'm myself 
again.
