Here is a wrap-up of the day's events so far -- the House of Representatives 
will vote today on whether to impeach President Clinton. During this 
morning's debate, house speaker-designate Bob Livingston, who admitted 
days ago he's had several extramarital affairs, announced he will 
not accept the speakership next month, and will resign from Congress. 
Lawmakers will vote on four articles of impeachment, charging president 
clinton with obstruction of justice, abuse of power and two counts 
of perjury. One for the grand jury testimony in August and one for 
his civil deposition in January. Democrats are calling for censure 
and plan to walk out of the chamber in protest if denied that option. 
Let's go to the hall and pick up some sound. All in favor, the yeas 
and nays will rise and standing. A sufficient number standing -- this 
will be a 15-minute vote. All right. The democrats are, as we speak, 
filing out of the chamber. Although they're not doing it En mass. 
They represent the top half of your screen. And we're not sure exactly 
what motion is being considered right now, but shortly that is within 
the next hour or so, the actual articles of impeachment will be voted 
on one by one and by CNN estimates the republicans have enough votes. 
In fact, they had 219 -- this is the shot of the democrats walking 
out in protest. They were not able to get the House of Representatives 
to consider a motion of censure. This is their reaction. There were 
some arcain grums about the germaneness of a motion to recommit. That 
was the democrats' last hope. There's we're not sure what the democrats 
plan to do and we're not sure if the house can vote if there's no 
qaur um. It would appear obvious they could not vote on articles of 
impeachment.
