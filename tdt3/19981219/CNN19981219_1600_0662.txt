Looking at democratic leaders that were in the White House this afternoon 
after the vote in the house. Those democrats walked out of the house 
this afternoon in protest, protesting the denial of a censure motion. 
Democrats had wanted something to fall short of impeachment, something 
along the lines of a censure vote against the president. That did 
not come through, and in protest, many of these democrats you're looking 
at right now, walked out of the Congress. Then they returned to vote 
on the four articles of impeachment. Again, two articles were passed, 
one dealing with Mr. Clinton's testimony before the grand jury in 
relation to the Monica Lewinsky case, the other that passed today, 
dealing with obstruction of justice in relation to the paula Jones 
case from Arkansas.
