John Paul II was feeling better Saturday after a day of rest to combat 
a light flu and was ready to resume his audiences later in the day, 
said Vatican spokesman Joaquin Navarro-Valls. The flu forced the pope 
to cancel his appointments on Friday. On Friday Vatican spokesman 
Joaquin Navarro-Valls said John Paul, who is 78, had a fever of 38 
degrees Celsius (100 F) as part of a mild flu. By Friday evening, 
the fever had reportedly gone down by almost a degree (99 F). The 
pope was scheduled to appear at noon Sunday at his studio window overlooking 
St. Peter's Square to give his weekly blessing. The flu hit at the 
start of the busy holiday period for the frail pope, who no longer 
celebrates Mass Christmas morning in St. Peter's Basilica to allow 
himself more time to rest after midnight Mass Christmas eve. The pope 
is scheduled to journey to Mexico and St. Louis, Missouri, in January.
