Foreign Minister Igor Ivanov said the use of force against Iraq could 
seriously affect relations between Russia and the United States, a 
statement from the Foreign Ministry said Saturday. ``If this action 
is not stopped, Russian-American relations can seriously suffer,'' 
Ivanov told U.S. Secretary of State Madeleine Albright in a telephone 
conversation Friday night. Ivanov said joint efforts of Russia and 
the United States in recent years had advanced their partnership in 
key areas of bilateral relations and international matters, the ministry 
statement said. ``This is important both for the two peoples and for 
stability and security in the whole world,'' Ivanov was quoted as 
saying. ``It is necessary to do everything to prevent a slideback 
in our relations.'' Ivanov called for a halt to the bombing campaign 
against Saddam Hussein and he urged the United States to resume the 
search for a political solution to the situation in Iraq at the U.N. 
Security Council. The Foreign Ministry said Albright will travel to 
Moscow in January, apparently in an attempt to isolate the dispute 
over Iraq from the rest of the U.S.-Russian relationship. ``We do 
want to keep our channels of communication open despite the unfortunate 
decision of Russia to recall its ambassador,'' State Department spokesman 
James P. Rubin said in Washington, referring to Russia's decision 
to recall Ambassador Yuli M. Vorontsov to protest the attack on Iraq. 
On Friday, Moscow denounced the United States and demanded an end 
to attacks on Iraq. U.S. President Bill Clinton sent a letter to President 
Boris Yeltsin on Friday defending the decision to attack. Yeltsin 
responded with a message to Clinton through Ivanov, but the contents 
of Yeltsin's message were not disclosed.
