NATIONAL FORECAST More than 6 inches of snow will fall along the Front 
Range of the Colorado Rockies on Sunday as cold, moist winds from 
the east glide up the sloping terrain. The developing snowstorm in 
the Colorado Rockies is just one facet of a large incursion of Arctic 
air into the contiguous states over the past few days. With a subcenter 
of Arctic high pressure bivouacked near the Canadian-Washington border, 
the brunt of the Arctic air mass will continue to be borne by the 
Rockies and the Plains. While Arctic air tightens its grip on the 
West and parts of the Middle West, the cold front marking the leading 
edge of Arctic air will stall from southeast Canada to the eastern 
Great Lakes and just north of the Ohio Valley as upper-level steering 
winds from the southwest blow nearly parallel to the front. Broken 
areas of light to moderate snow will fall near the upper Mississippi 
Valley and western Great Lakes as a jet stream disturbance passes 
west of the stalled front. Snowfalls will be enhanced across Michigan's 
upper peninsula as cold air is moistened in transit over Lake Superior. 
Patches of freezing rain will develop just west of the Arctic front 
from the middle Mississippi Valley northeastward, where a weak area 
of low pressure produces precipitation in a zone where only a shallow 
layer of Arctic air will be present. Meanwhile, a few clusters of 
showers will dampen parts of the Gulf states as a jet stream disturbance 
that brought high clouds to the Southwestern states Saturday summons 
moisture northward from the Gulf of Mexico. Focus: Blizzard Blizzard 
warnings were issued for northeast North Dakota and northwest Minnesota 
on Friday as an invading Arctic air mass blasted into the upper Middle 
West. There is a technical and a colloquial definition of a blizzard. 
Technically, winds must be sustained for 35 mph or more for three 
consecutive hours, all the while with visibility below one-quarter 
of a mile in snow or blowing snow. At one time, temperatures were 
required to be lower than 20 degrees Fahrenheit, but the condition 
was removed several years ago. Colloquially, a blizzard refers to 
any snowstorm with high winds.
