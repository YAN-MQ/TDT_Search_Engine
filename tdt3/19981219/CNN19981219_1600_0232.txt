While we're waiting for the president, let's recap and talk about 
what else happened today. A surprise move by house speaker designate 
Bob Livingston, when he announced he would not accept the speakership 
and said he will resign. He urged the president to resign as well. 
Two days ago, Livingston admitted in engaging in affairs during his 
marriage. E he had been selected to replace Newt Gingrich as shous 
speaker. Bob Livingston says he will quit Congress in six months and 
ask Louisiana's governor to hold a special election to fill his seat. 
I can only challenge you in such fashion if I am willing to heed my 
own words. To my colleagues, my friends, my wife and family, I have 
hurt you all deeply and I beg your forgiveness. I was prepared to 
lead our narrow majority as speaker, and I believe I had it in me 
to do a fine job. But I cannot do that job or be the kind of leader 
that I would like to be under current circumstances. So I must set 
the example that I hope President Clinton will follow. I will not 
stand for speaker of the house on January 6th. Now, just before the 
votes began, the democrats walked out of the capitol in protest. Republicans 
had blocked their attempt to have the house consider a motion of censure, 
so they made that move as protest. Going back to the story about Bob 
Livingston and his surprise resignation today, republican sources 
say the party is likely to elect Dennis Hastert. There was an immediate 
response from the White House. The house press secretary the president 
is urging Livingston to reskr. He says he believes the politics of 
person destruction has become too pervasive. He says that President 
Clinton will absolutely not resign. You are looking at a live picture 
from outside the White House.
