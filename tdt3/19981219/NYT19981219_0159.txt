As defiant as on the day she blamed the Monica Lewinsky scandal on 
a ``vast right-wing conspiracy,'' Hillary Rodham Clinton went to Capitol 
Hill on Saturday morning and blasted the impeachment process as unfair 
and politically motivated. She told House Democrats that the president 
would continue to fight and that they should, too. In a closed meeting 
with the House Democrats, Mrs. Clinton said she was there in part 
as ``a wife who loves and supports her husband,'' and charged that 
Republicans were impeaching her husband _ ``hounding him out of office,'' 
she said _ because they opposed his agenda. ``She said this is as 
much about ending his agenda on health care and other things as about 
hounding him out of office,'' said Rep. Bob Menendez of New Jersey. 
``She said there would be no resignation and we should not and cannot 
allow them to hound him out of office.'' Mrs. Clinton's continued 
support for her husband has been seen as crucial to his popularity, 
cited again and again by those who say they will stick with him, too, 
in statements along the order of ``If Hillary doesn't mind, why should 
I?'' or ``That's between him, his God and Hillary.'' She had been 
credited with saving his political skin at least twice before, appearing 
at his side on ``60 Minutes'' as he denied a long affair with Gennifer 
Flowers, and going solo on the ``Today'' show to complain about a 
``vast right-wing conspiracy'' after Clinton's denial of ``sexual 
relations with that woman, Miss Lewinsky.'' And though Mrs. Clinton 
got generous credit for campaigning before the November elections, 
some Democrats had expressed a little nervousness lately, wondering 
why she hadn't offered fresh support for the president. Her staff 
has insisted that she did all she could, consulting constitutional 
scholars and regularly discussing the issue with the president. Friends 
said she had been annoyed by suggestions to the contrary: Was she 
supposed to issue daily statements of support? Or lobby Republicans 
who wince at the mention of her name? On Saturday, though, her mission 
was clear. Mrs. Clinton is extremely popular among congressional Democrats 
_ far more so than her husband _ and she came to inoculate him against 
the possibility that Democrats could be persuaded that his resignation 
might be best for the country. Two House Democrats, Rep. Louise Slaughter 
of New York and Rep. William Lipinski of Illinois, had already said 
they would urge resignation if he were impeached. ``She was determined 
and defiant,'' said Rep. Jerrold Nadler of New York. ``Her message 
was that they've been pursuing him since the day he came into office.'' 
The president has not always enjoyed warm relations with congressional 
Democrats, many of whom disagreed with him on welfare and thought 
at times that he worked rather too cozily with their Republican counterparts. 
On Saturday, Mrs. Clinton reminded them that her husband was not the 
real issue. ``She said this goes beyond her husband, to the Constitution 
and the presidency,'' said Rep. Charles Rangel, who has himself been 
critical of the president at times. Not on Saturday, though: ``Resign? 
We say, `Hell, no.''' In what several members called a ``pep rally,'' 
Mrs. Clinton thanked Democrats for their support and asked them to 
keep it coming, receiving half a dozen standing ovations. Afterward, 
members stood in line to give her a hug. And as they left, several 
House Democrats referred at least obliquely to Mrs. Clinton's own 
political prospects. ``She's probably the most popular person in the 
country with Democrats, period, and that's also true of us in the 
caucus,'' said Rep. Eliot Engel of New York, where Mrs. Clinton has 
been mentioned as someone with the potential to succeed Daniel Patrick 
Moynihan in the Senate. Her appearance on Saturday, following supportive 
remarks she made on Friday, did seem to end a week of speculation 
that Mrs. Clinton had decided to protect her political future by distancing 
herself from her husband, in the hour of his greatest political need. 
That the Clintons held hands rather less on their recent trip to Israel 
than on earlier trips, and that Mrs. Clinton seemed to pull away from 
her husband at one moment, were reported on CNN, NBC and a number 
of newspapers as evidence that Mrs. Clinton was no longer on the team. 
The headline on the page one story that ran in the Washington Times 
on Wednesday was ``Hillary shows signs of relinquishing role as the 
defender in chief for her husband.'' But on Saturday she said she 
had gone to the Hill as ``a wife who loves and supports her husband,'' 
a Judiciary Committee staff member during Watergate who knows firsthand 
how the process should work, and an American who feels proud of the 
Democrats. Rep. Dennis Kucinich of Ohio said he felt pumped up by 
the meeting with Mrs. Clinton: ``It's a campaign all over again. This 
needs to be a fight every step of the way, and we're going to wake 
the town and tell the people.'' And he suggested that at this late 
date, the two-for-one presidency has new life: ``She's so terrific,'' 
he said. ``It's lucky for America we have a woman with the strength 
to lead the nation right now. And everybody understands she is one 
of the leaders of the nation right now, as much as the president.'' 
Now, the question is whether Mrs. Clinton's pep talk will sustain 
Democrats in the days ahead, amid a steady succession of jaw-dropping 
events on Capitol Hill. Less than an hour after the meeting _ after 
Rep. Bob Livingston made the surprise announcement that he won't become 
speaker _ Rep. Jane Harman of California said the meeting with the 
first lady had been quite emotional, but then added, ``It seems like 
we've lived a century since then.''
