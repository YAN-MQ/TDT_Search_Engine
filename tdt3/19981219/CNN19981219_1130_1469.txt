three adventurists are on day two of another attempt to circle the 
globe nonstop in a balloon. two of them, chicago millionaire steve 
fossett and british tycoon richard branson, used to be arch rivals 
in the quest to set the world record. yesterday, they joined forces 
and took off from morocco in a 200-foot balloon, along with teammate 
per linstrand. a spokeswoman for the team says all is well. they flew 
into libyan air space today, and should by over turkey by tonight.
