Two thirds of a 1,800-man NATO force to be deployed as protection 
for unarmed international verifiers in Kosovo, haa already been deployed 
in Macedonia, a spokesman for the mission said Saturday. Lt. Col. 
Andrew Venus said about 650 French, 200 Italian, 150 British and 100 
German and Dutch troops, have arrived. The remaining 600 soldiers 
will arrive by the end of December or first week of January 1999. 
The soldiers are based in barracks of the Macedonian army in the border 
town of Kumanovo, western Macedonian town of Tetovo and Petrovec airport 
in the capital Skopje. The still-forming observers mission in Kosovo 
is tasked with monitoring a shaky truce in the volatile Yugoslav province. 
The NATO mission is supposed to provide protection in case the estimated 
2,000 verifiers run into trouble in Kosovo. Kosovo is a predominantly 
ethnic Albanian province in Serbia, the dominant republic in Yugoslavia. 
Macedonia borders Kosovo.
