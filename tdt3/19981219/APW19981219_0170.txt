World Cup overall leader Alexandra Meissnitzer of Austria widened 
the scope of her supremacy on Saturday, winning her first career World 
Cup downhill. Meissnitzer, who has won five of 12 races this season, 
stormed down the icy, bumpy 2,500-meter (8,202-foot) Piste de l'Ours 
in 1 minute, 42.68 seconds, to add the downhill victory to her wins 
in the super-G and giant slalom. The Austrian was the only skier to 
break the 42 second barrier, with runnerup Regine Cavagnoud of France 
crossing in 1:43.00 flat. Cavagnoud, who is having her best season 
since 1993, finished ahead of World Cup downhill leader Renate Goetschl 
of Austria, third in 1:43.17. Goetschl, winner of both downhills this 
season, was the favorite coming into this weekend's double header, 
but a near fall in Friday's race left the Austrian back in 14th. Goetschl 
clings to her lead in the World Cup downhill standings, but Meissnitzer 
has been rapidly gaining ground.
