With the expected Hoe impeachment vote and the crisis in the Persian 
gulf, the U.S. seems to be engaged in two battles -- one at home and 
another overseas. Patty Davis looks at how consumers and retailers 
are reacting. As the United States continued to pound Iraq, shoppers 
were pounding the pavement in Chicago. No, it hasn't affected my holiday 
spending. It's affected my holiday spirits. And despite the impeachment 
proceedings against President Clinton on the house floor, shyae Yang's 
spirits were just fine. He had just sold some stock at a tidy profit. 
Whoever will be the president -- Al Gore or Clinton -- it will be 
the same. So I really don't worry about it. As the stock market shrugs 
off both impeachment and U.S. military involvement in Iraq, small 
investors seem to be taking it in stride. While we might want to think 
that these dramatic events are going to somehow topple consumer confidence 
or topple the economy, what we're finding is that this economy is 
extremely strong. Low inflation, low interest rates and plentiful 
jobs keep the ford explorers rolling out of this showroom. The historic 
events in Washington and Iraq aren't slowing sales any. If we get 
40 a month, we sell 40. If we get 20, we sell 20, if we get 50, we 
sell 50. So really, it's been unbelievable. The attack on Iraq hasn't 
made driving that truck any more expensive. Oil prices, which rose 
sharply during the gulf war, have fallen this time, due to a glut 
of oil on world markets. That's put more money in consumers' pocketbooks. 
And with one more week to go until Christmas -- I'm spending a lot 
more this year. Shoppers seem to have no qualms about spending it.
