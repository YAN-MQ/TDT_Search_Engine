A suspected top aide to Osama Bin Laden, the Saudi millionaire accused 
of organizing the deadly bombings at U.S. embassies in Africa this 
summer, will be extradited to the United States from Germany soon, 
a government spokesman said Saturday. Mamdouh Mahmud Salim, who is 
jailed in Munich, is to be extradited on Monday, a report by the Hamburg-based 
Welt am Sonntag newspaper said. But the spokesman in Bonn, requesting 
anonymity, said he could not confirm what day the extradition would 
take place. He said that justice and foreign ministry officials had 
given final approval for the extradition on Friday. ``So it could 
happen in the next few days.'' The latest decision comes after the 
Federal Constitutional Court threw out an appeal against the extradition 
by Salim on Dec. 11, saying it was baseless. The justice ministry 
said at the time that extradition would be approved as soon as the 
U.S. government gave assurances that Salim would not face a death 
penalty, which is forbidden by the German constitution. Salim, 40, 
has been jailed since his arrest in Bavaria three months ago on a 
U.S. warrant. A Munich state court originally approved his extradition 
on Nov. 27. U.S. officials claim Salim is Bin Laden's finance chief 
and have charged him in New York with murder conspiracy and use of 
weapons of mass destruction in an international plot to kill U.S. 
citizens. Three other alleged accomplices of Bin Laden already are 
jailed in the United States. The Aug. 7 bombings in Kenya and Tanzania 
killed 224 people, including 12 Americans.
