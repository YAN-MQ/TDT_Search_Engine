From Atlanta, this is CNN "Headline News." This is Judy Fortin. Events 
have taken an unexpected turn. There is a vacuum in the top ranks 
of the house leadership. Bob Livingston, the choice to take over after 
Newt Gingrich, stunned his colleagues two days ago when he revealed 
he had extramarital affairs, stunned his colleagues again this morning. 
You, sir, may resign your post. no! no! no! The house will be in order. 
And, and -- The house will be in order. And I can only challenge you 
in such fashion if I am willing to heed my own words. To my colleagues, 
my friends and most especially my wife and family, I have hur you 
all deeply and I beg your forgiveness. I was prepared to lead our 
narrow majority as speaker, and I believe I had it in me to do a fine 
job. But I can't do that job or be the kind of leader that I would 
like to be under current circumstances. So I must set the example 
that I hope President Clinton will follow. I will not stand for speaker 
of the house on January 6th.
