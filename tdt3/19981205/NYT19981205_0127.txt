Jennifer Blanken learned about the auction from the local newspaper 
and quickly called her friend Sunny Hersh. Furniture belonging to 
the woman who became notorious last summer as the Morristown Madam 
was being sold. Wouldn't it be fun to preview the very items that 
helped fire up the office-park Casanovas who had stolen off to the 
Madam's 20-room mansion for what her advertisements promised would 
be ``An Afternoon Delight.'' ``She said it was fantasy furniture,'' 
Mrs. Blanken said, explaining why the remarks of a woman accused of 
running a bordello had drawn her to Dawson's auction house. ``I wanted 
to see what that whole category involved.'' Mrs. Hersh agreed: ``Someone 
in that line of business would be fanciful. You go in and sort of 
step into another world.'' So there, indoors on a springlike afternoon 
were the two suburban mothers peering with scarcely concealed smiles 
at a Carrara marble maiden with a breast half bared and a regal chair 
cushioned in a velvet that one customer described as ``bordello red.'' 
They scrutinized the gaudy late-19th-century stalwarts _ a carved 
oak clock valued at $18,000, a towering walnut serving buffet, a fireplace 
mantel, all richly decorated with satyrs, cupids, griffins and dragons. 
``It just wouldn't go with my stuff,'' said Mrs. Hersh, who lives 
in Long Valley, N.J., west of Morristown. ``I have a real contemporary 
home in a contemporary suburb _ your basic Long Valley Colonial.'' 
Still, she said she understood the attraction of all those mythological 
carvings. ``She didn't want to have the same things in her house that 
these men have in their homes,'' Mrs. Hersh said. Although she works 
in marketing and not sociology, Mrs. Hersh put her finger on what 
it was about Judith Kelly Dempsey's unorthodox suburban business that 
has so captivated Morris County and beyond. ``Something is happening 
other than going to work and coming home,'' Mrs. Hersh said. ``Your 
neighbor who gets up at 5:30 and goes into the city? Something's happening 
other than that.'' John Cheever and John Updike couldn't have put 
it better. Their suburban chronicles tenderly delve into the contrast 
between the sober, manicured homes and the trouble and angst that 
sometimes fester inside. People move to the suburbs precisely because 
they are predictable, even humdrum. After urban thieves steal the 
car radio, humdrum is good, they figure. They don't expect to find 
bookie parlors, terrorist cells or bordellos behind the clipped hedges. 
When they do, it's the talk of the town. Both the auction house and 
Mrs. Dempsey, whom the auction catalog discreetly identified only 
as a former Playboy bunny, were hoping that publicity about Mrs. Dempsey's 
case would raise prices by drawing many bidders to Saturday's auction 
looking for, well, an afternoon delight. The truth about the furniture, 
though, was a little less titillating. Mrs. Dempsey, who has rejected 
a prosecutor's offer of probation in exchange for a guilty plea to 
promoting prostitution, says she was enchanted by mythical figures 
as a girl and started buying furniture carved with them long before 
she opened what she called her escort service. At 46, she considers 
herself a suburban hausfrau just like some of the women ogling her 
furniture. She stands out, she said, only because of the unusual business 
she started after her husband ran off and stranded her with a $700,000 
mortgage. ``Maybe I was a little more resourceful in my effort to 
save my house,'' she said. In addition to visitors who, to use Mrs. 
Hersh's term, were ``peeking,'' there were serious collectors, like 
the lanky 67-year-old squire sporting an Irish country hat who was 
there, he said, because he looks ``for quality no matter where I find 
it.'' A place like Mrs. Dempsey's business, which charged $225 an 
hour, would be sure to have elegant things. ``You go to a dump, you're 
going to draw a dumpy clientele,'' he said. ``You've got a fancy place, 
you're going to draw high prices for services rendered.'' Of the peekers, 
one woman joked coyly with a friend that she was looking at the furniture 
``to see which room your husband and my husband used.'' Another, Helen 
Reingold, an 83-year-old neighbor of Mrs. Dempsey's, tweaked the press 
for its excessive interest. ``Let me ask you gentlemen,'' she said 
tartly to a reporter and photographer, turning the antique tables 
on them. ``What are you doing here?''
