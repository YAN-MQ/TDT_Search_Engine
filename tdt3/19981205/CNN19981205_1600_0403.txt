Astronauts on the space shuttle "endeavour" are beginning to tackle 
the first task in assembling the international space station. They're 
preparing to unload the 25,000-pound unity Module from the shuttle's 
cargo bay using the 50-foot-long robot arm. Tomorrow, they'll connect 
it with the Russian-made zarya control Module that was put into orbit 
two weeks ago. The crew also will test spacesuits and jet-powered 
backpacks that will be used during construction of the space station.
