One week from today, the president will be in the Middle East, meeting 
with israelis and Palestinians to promote the peace process. Right 
now, things are not going as well as he had hoped. And as NBC's Martin 
Fletcher reports, the closer the trip gets, the more endangered the 
peace process becomes. Palestinians are turning the streets into a 
battle zone, demanding Israel free political prisoners from its jails. 
Is there a price for human beings' life to go on staying in prison 
for all of these years without knowing when he will be released? The 
protests quickly turned violent today. Near three West Bank towns, 
Israeli troops struggled to keep the roads open. This Palestinian 
was shot in the chest. He survived because the Israelis use rubber 
bullets, not live ammunition, unless their lives are in danger. These 
are not the scenes expected from the peace process but it's the reality. 
Emotions are high among Palestinians. They feel cheated. Two weeks 
ago, Israel released 250 Palestinian prisoners, as agreed in the last 
peace agreement signed in Washington. But 150 of them were common 
criminals, enraging the Palestinians. Israel, in turn, was Enraged 
after this attack was broadcast many times this week. Palestinian 
students, calling for the release of prisoners, attacked israeli cars. 
Inside this one -- a lone Israeli soldier. Palestinians beat him with 
rocks and stones, stole his rifle, then he ran for his life. His mother 
was thankful her son survived. He saved his life with honor. But many 
Israelis condemned him for not killing the people trying to kill him. 
American officials are trying hard to end the confrontation before 
the president arrives. His visit was supposed to be a celebration 
of the peace process. Instead, Clinton may find himself trying to 
save it. Martin Fletcher, NBC news, Tel Aviv.
