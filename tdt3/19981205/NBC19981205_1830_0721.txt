To Iraq now, where an all-too-familiar scenario is playing out, as 
U.N. inspectors continue their search for weapons of mass destruction. 
NBC's Kevin Tibbles is in Baghdad tonight. The game of cat-and-mouse 
continues daily, and this morning, U.N. inspectors once again went 
out in search of Iraq's hidden weapons. Three weeks after the U.S. 
and Great Britain were poised to attack, the situation remains in 
limbo. Chief U.N. weapons inspector Richard Butler, this week in Moscow, 
should report by mid-December on whether Iraq is finally making good 
on its promise to allow unhindered access -- something he's been demanding 
all along. What we're looking for is the record that we need of Iraq's 
program of weapons of mass destruction, the program that we have to 
bring to account before we can report to the security council that 
Iraq is properly disarmed. But the Iraqis claim there's another reason 
the process is taking so long -- eight years of economic sanctions 
have crippled the economy and iraq thinks the west wants to keep it 
that way. There's a political objective for the United States in the 
region which requires keeping the region volatile and unstable in 
order to achieve that objective. But weapons inspectors maintain Iraq 
is still hiding materials capable of making chemical and biological 
weapons. Sanctions won't be lifted until they're all found and destroyed, 
and to ensure Saddam Hussein complies, the gulf bristles with military 
hardware, ready to strike at any time. While it won't say where its 
inspectors are going each day, the U.N. insists they will make surprise 
visits to sites throughout Iraq, and continue to seek out hidden documents 
denied them in the past. Failure to comply would bring this uneasy 
calm to an end. Kevin Tibbles, NBC, Baghdad.
