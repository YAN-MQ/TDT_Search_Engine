A New York City police officer committed suicide Friday night shortly 
after leaving the scene of a multiple-car accident he caused in nearby 
Nassau County, law enforcement officials said. The officer was identified 
as Michael Lynch, 32, a five-year veteran of the Police Department. 
No one was seriously hurt in the accident, but Lynch did not know 
that because he did not stop to check, the Lynbrook Police Department 
said. Then, when Lynch showed up at a nearby repair shop an hour later, 
workers said they told him that his car, a 1999 Honda Accord with 
500 miles on the odometer, would cost $9,000 to repair. ``He was very 
upset when he walked in and just kept saying, `I really screwed up, 
I really screwed up,''' said a repairman who declined to give his 
name. ``Then a few minutes later, after we had called him a cab, we 
heard a gunshot out front.'' The accident occurred shortly after 8:30 
p.m. Lynch's car hit another car as both vehicles traveled west on 
the Sunrise Highway, near Roosevelt Avenue, said Sgt. James Fleming 
of the Lynbrook Police Department. Lynch then drove his car over a 
small concrete divider and hit two other cars traveling east, Fleming 
said. ``Then he just took off,'' Fleming said. ``It happens all the 
time, but what caused him to do what he did I could not speculate.'' 
An hour after the accident, about six miles away in nearby Lawrence, 
workers at the K &AMP; G Garage said they saw Lynch drive up to their 
24-hour repair shop. They said he asked for an estimate and was told 
that the damage to both sides of the car would cost $9,000 to repair. 
Lynch was married but had no children. He was last assigned to the 
103rd Precinct in Queens.
