The background noise on the telephone didn't sound like a boat at 
anchor, or even a marina for that matter. It was a chattering, clattering 
kind of sound, like people standing around wheels and brakes and asphalt. 
So what was Mike Golding, leader in the Around Alone race for solo 
sailors, doing at a go-cart park in South Africa? ``It's a good way 
to let off steam,'' the 38-year-old Englishman said last week from 
Cape Town, where the first leg of the race ended. ``I'm here racing 
against my support crew and a few other people I've met down here. 
The track has 30 go-carts, so I'm hoping some of my sailing competitors 
will show up, too.'' Unlike driving the daredevil go-carts, no one 
sails a top 60-foot yacht flat-out. Built with low-slung decks and 
innovative keels and rigs, the highly tuned monohulls are capable 
of more speed than any one competitor can handle. When the wind is 
up, speeds in the 20-knot range and above leave such thoroughbreds 
on the edge of capsizing. ``More than 50 percent of the time, you're 
having to lift your foot from the pedal to stay safe,'' Golding said 
of Team Group 4, his French-built yacht, which surprised everyone 
in the fleet of 15 by winning Leg 1. ``The boat is able to do things 
that as a human, you are not able to control. It's like a fast car; 
sometimes you have to hold back.'' Golding's victory in the first 
leg of the 27,000-mile race around the world developed slowly, like 
water rising from a deep well. It was not until a month after the 
Sept. 26 start from Charleston, S.C., that Golding clawed his way 
to the front of the fleet. ``It's the competition, and not necessarily 
the act of sailing, that gives me pleasure,'' Golding said. ``It's 
more the act of putting what I know against what the others know.'' 
Now it is Golding whom the other 14 lone sailors must beat in the 
second stage, a 6,884-mile leg to Auckland, New Zealand, which began 
Saturday from Cape Town. Golding, a former firefighter, has sailed 
around the world three times before, twice in amateur races and once 
in a record-setting 161-day nonstop solo voyage against the prevailing 
winds. But in the Around Alone race, Golding was lower on the favored-to-win 
list than the likes of Isabelle Autissier, the indomitable French 
sailor who is the only woman in the race, or Marc Thiercelin of France, 
who had finished an impressive second in a similar race around the 
world last year. By the end of the first leg, a 34-day chase after 
wind from the North to South Atlantic, those three had finished within 
six hours of each other. When they arrived Oct. 31, they were all 
faster to Cape Town after their 6,800-mile ocean passage than anyone 
in the 1994-95 race, breaking the record set by Autissier, who led 
the fleet four years ago. ``Our boats are lively, tender, exciting 
and fast, and sometimes scary,'' Golding said. ``But in some ways, 
they are stronger than other boats.'' Made of composite materials 
such as fiberglass and carbon fiber, the yachts are constructed to 
withstand the huge seas and gale winds likely to hit during legs in 
the lower latitudes beneath Australia, New Zealand, Chile and Argentina. 
Depending on the design, some of the 60-footers are built with as 
many as five watertight compartments to keep them afloat if damaged. 
Fast boats or not, the Around Alone race seldom offers easy sailing. 
Add to that a few tales of personal woe such as the much-publicized 
elbow injury that befell Viktor Yasykov of Russia during the first 
stage. An abscess in his arm required at-sea consultation through 
e-mail with a physician in Boston. But excessive bleeding and pain 
nearly cost him his arm as well as the race before the infection cleared 
up. The Cape Town-to-Auckland route is rife with turbulence and possibility 
for disaster. In the 1994-95 race, Autissier was rescued at sea after 
her 60-foot sailboat was rolled upside-down through 360 degrees and 
dismasted by storms. But she said last week that she is calm and well 
prepared. ``The more you have been down there, the more comfortable 
you are in going back,'' she said. ``But you have to really think 
about what will happen all the time. Maybe sometimes you are not busy 
on the deck, but you have to concentrate. You have to feel the waves. 
Everything can change so fast.''
