The Arizona Cardinals publicity staff has begun to compile a list 
of ``Jake Plummer Game-Saving Comebacks.'' It's the sort of thing 
done for a Joe Montana or a John Elway, but in only 19 National Football 
League starts _ Sunday's game with the Giants will be his 20th _ Plummer 
has already brought the Cardinals from behind in the fourth quarter 
seven times. There has been nothing run-of-the-mill about any of them. 
It's hard, in fact, to choose a favorite. Was it when Jake the Snake 
moved the Cardinals 50 yards in 5 plays and 27 seconds to set up the 
game-winning field goal over the Redskins? Or was it when he moved 
the Cardinals 55 yards in 6 plays and 34 seconds for the game-winning 
field goal as time expired against the Ravens? How about 98 yards 
on 14 plays against the Eagles? That, of course, was Plummer's first 
Eagles-Cardinals game. In the second, he finished with an 86-yard, 
9-play drive that put the game away in the final two minutes. But 
perhaps the best comeback was the one that came up short _ with the 
help of a controversial official's call. That was the game three weeks 
ago against Dallas when the Cardinals charged at the Cowboys from 
28 points down. In the second half, Plummer threw for 314 yards. The 
Cardinals lost, 35-28, but Plummer finished with 465 yards passing 
_and that did not include his pass to Rob Moore on the final play. 
It was ruled incomplete, although television replays appeared to show 
that the Cardinals deserved a touchdown. The budding legend of Plummer, 
who is 23 years old, only blossoms when Jake talks about himself. 
He is as calm then as he is exciting to watch. ``Don't rush,'' Plummer 
said in explaining the key to his late-game heroics. ``The game won't 
end until that clock runs out. Relax and have fun with it. Believe 
in yourself. If I didn't believe in myself and instead listened to 
everything that was said about me _ you're too small, too skinny and 
your arm's not strong enough _ I'd be cleaning pools in Arizona. Or 
something.'' He is a quarterback with unusual accomplishments and 
attributes. Whenever Plummer has stepped on the field for the first 
time with a new team _ in high school in Idaho, in college at Arizona 
State and in the National Football League at Arizona _ he has led 
his team to a touchdown on his first drive at quarterback. Giants 
Coach Jim Fassel was the offensive coordinator for the Cardinals in 
1996 when Plummer, who is 6 feet 2 inches and 197 pounds, was leading 
Arizona State to a Rose Bowl appearance. ``I was right there in town 
so I heard all the talk and commotion about this guy,'' Fassel said. 
``But I looked at his height and weight and read the scouting reports 
about his arm strength and speed and I said: `I don't know about this 
guy.' ``All the measureables weren't that good.'' Fassel then got 
some tape of Plummer's games at Arizona State. ``I put in one reel 
of film, watched it and I said: `This guy can play,''' Fassel said. 
``I watched another reel and I knew definitely that he can play. He's 
the kind of guy you have to watch him play to understand.'' For the 
most part, Giants fans have yet to see the Plummer everybody else 
is talking about. In Plummer's rookie season last year, he threw for 
388 yards in a 19-10 loss to the Giants, but he also threw two interceptions. 
In a 17-point loss at Giants Stadium two months ago, Plummer again 
threw two interceptions, was sacked seven times and fumbled once. 
Said Plummer of such down days: ``You're not going to be perfect every 
day, not just as a young quarterback but throughout your whole career. 
Remember, if it was an easy job, everyone would be doing it.'' Plummer 
has been likened to Montana, a comparison that, surprisingly, does 
not seem to irk or astound anyone in the football community. ``They 
are similar looking,'' Fassel said. ``The way he drops back and moves 
in the pocket. Jake is an extremely good thrower on the run _ a great 
thing to be these days. His build is slight like Montana's. He seems 
to be one of those guys who can avoid or slip past big hits and if 
you can do that, you avoid injuries even if you're not big. ``Jake 
needs to play a lot more before we know more, though.'' Plummer accepts 
the Montana comparisons, to a degree. ``I did watch him constantly 
growing up,'' Plummer said. ``He's my favorite to watch on film. For 
one, he was a smaller guy and they said things about him that they've 
said about me in terms of size, arm strength and all that. ``But he 
was a leader. He went out there and guys believed in him. I'd like 
to be thought of like that some day. But I'm just starting out.'' 
As Plummer has become a bigger story nationally, he has also got the 
attention of his opponents. The legend is growing. Even the Giants, 
who have beaten the Cardinals 7 of the last 10 times they have met, 
seem to know that Plummer is to be feared. ``He's really tricky,'' 
the Giants' Pro Bowl defensive end, Michael Strahan, said. ``He scoots 
and slides by people. You may think you've got him, but you don't. 
You can't judge him by looking at him. ``They don't call him Jake 
the Snake for nothing.''
