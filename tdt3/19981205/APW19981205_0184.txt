A Chinese man has confessed to the murder of a young Chinese couple 
in Cyprus, and police are looking for another Chinese suspect, police 
told a court Saturday. The court ordered Wang Yiang, 21, to remain 
in custody for eight days pending a full investigation into his admission 
that he committed the double murder that has shocked the normally 
placid Cyprus. Police prosecutor Andreas Kariolemos also told the 
Limassol Court that Yiang implicated a compatriot, Hua Cheng Bu, 21, 
as the mastermind of the murder. The bodies of the victims, a man 
and and a woman both aged 23, were found Wednesday at the bottom of 
a remote cliff in the central mountains, 30 miles (50 kilometers) 
north of Limassol. Police said they had been battered on the head 
with an iron bar and strangled with leather thongs, apparently a couple 
of days earlier. The victims' names have not been released pending 
intimation to their next of kin in China. The couple had arrived in 
Cyprus two months ago and had registered as students at a local college 
where the two suspects are also registered. Limassol police chief 
Miltiades Neocleous said the victims had been killed in their Limassol 
apartment, which had been ransacked. The motive appeared to be robbery 
as the culprits believed the couple had a large amount of money stashed 
in their apartment, he added. Neocleous had earlier described the 
crime as ``most unusual for Cyprus.'' Violent crimes are rare in Cyprus, 
an island nation of 650,000 people that records less than 10 murders 
a year.
