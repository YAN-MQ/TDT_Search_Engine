Miguel Angel Garcia Mendez, a former legislator in Puerto Rico and 
lifelong champion of statehood for the island commonwealth, died in 
a hospital in Mayaguez, Puerto Rico, on Nov. 17, his 96th birthday. 
Garcia Mendez, a former speaker of the Puerto Rican House of Representatives, 
helped found the Statehood Republican Party in 1948. The organization 
was a forerunner of the pro-statehood New Progressive Party. Gov. 
Pedro Rossello, the party's current head, declared a three-day period 
of official mourning. At the governor's urging, Puerto Ricans will 
take another nonbinding vote on the status of the island on Dec. 13. 
Garcia Mendez was born in Aguadilla in the island's northwest. He 
served in Puerto Rico's House of Representatives from 1932 to 1940 
and became its youngest leader. He was later elected senator. A prominent 
lawyer and businessman, he founded Western Bank. He also owned El 
Imparcial, a newspaper that is defunct. Garcia Mendez is survived 
by two daughters. His wife, Freddery Ramirez de Arellano, died some 
years ago.
