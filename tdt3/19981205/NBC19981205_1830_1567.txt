When it comes to liver transplants good news tonight about a shorter 
waiting time. It's happening because of doctors trying something different. 
Details from Mike Boettcher in Los Angeles. 9-month-old Molly is in 
desperate need of a new liver. And on this day at the UCLA medical 
center, she'll get one -- not a whole liver, but a small part of one 
that arrived at the Los Angeles hospital hours earlier. The larger 
piece of that same liver will go to a 58-year-old man. One donated 
liver, two people in need. An innovative idea to address the high 
demand for liver transplants. The main problem with liver transplantation 
and all types of transplantation is there's not enough organs to go 
around. Currently in the U.S., there are 11,400 people on the waiting 
list for liver transplants, with fewer than half that number of organs 
donated each year. The split liver technique, giving parts of the 
same organ to two recipients, has cut the average waiting time for 
children under 2 from 290 days to less than 30. If this technique 
is maximally utilized, we could probably add another 1,000 organs 
that would be transplantable every year in the United States. Since 
launching its program in July of '96, Dr. busuttil and his team have 
split 48 donated livers among 89 recipients, many of them infants. 
Amazing. Look at those cheeks. She looks fabulous. Little Jacqueline 
Miranda got hers three months ago. Today, she's doing well. I was 
scared because every day she looked worse. She looked yellow with 
a greenish color. She looked so sad. Jacqueline got her piece of liver 
in just seven weeks, but typically there are 8,000 to 9,000 Americans 
children and adults -- awaiting liver transplants, and only 4,000 
donated each year. That's why liver splitting has been such a breakthrough. 
The splitting technique works for livers because the liver is the 
only major organ that regenerates. The small transplanted portion 
in the baby will grow with the child. Babies benefitting from a new 
kind of medical math where one liver equals two lives. Mike Boettcher,
