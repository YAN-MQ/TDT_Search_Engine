Now, to the latest chapter in a 44-year-old murder case. Ohio's highest 
court has cleared the way for a civil court trial where samuel Reese 
sheppard can try to clear his father's name once and for all. Here's 
NBC's Anne Thompson. In life, Dr. Sam sheppard stood trial twice for 
the 1954 murder of his wife, Marilyn, in their suburban Cleveland 
home. Now dead, sheppard will be the subject of a third trial, as 
his son continues his crusade to prove his father's innocence. I want 
to know who killed my mother. This is not just about clearing my father's 
name. Dr. sheppard's claim that a bushy-haired intruder did it inspired 
the TV series and movie "the fugitive." But the real-life drama proved 
more compelling. No one wanted to hear my side of the story. In the 
midst of a media frenzy, sheppard was convicted in what was then called 
"the trial of the century." After a decade in prison, the conviction 
was overturned. And in 1966, sheppard was acquitted. What it was like 
there for you? It was hell. But that has never been enough for his 
son. He exhumed his father's body. And now armed with DNA evidence, 
Sam Reese sheppard believes he can prove "The bushy-haired intruder" 
was the family's window washer Richard eberling. There was a blood 
trail throughout the house that has been well documented. Our suspect's 
DNA was in that blood trail. Our suspect's DNA are in forensic samples 
from vaginal swabs from my mother, a detail that was never dealt with 
in terms of evidence of rape. Eberling died in prison last summer 
while serving time for another murder. Just one reason why the cuyahoga 
county prosecutor's office has no desire to resurrect one of the century's 
most sensational cases. He's been acquitted. What else is there to 
hash out? There is no other jury that is going to make a determination 
as to the guilt or innocence in this case. It's done. And the judge 
who could preside this time is well aware that a Third sheppard trial 
could be as big a media circus as the first. I think it'll be a unique 
experience for everyone in the courtroom, including the attorneys 
for both sides. If a court declares Dr. sheppard innocent, his son 
could collect some $2 million in damages. But Sam Reese sheppard says 
it's not money that he wants, instead, he wants to remove the stigma 
of a murder conviction from his family name. Anne Thompson, NBC news,
