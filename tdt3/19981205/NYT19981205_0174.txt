A Nigerian woman seven-and-a-half months pregnant went into labor 
on a flight from Ghana to New York on Saturday, but the pilots radioed 
ahead and two Port Authority police officers rushed on board when 
the plane landed at Kennedy International Airport and helped deliver 
a healthy baby girl in coach class. ``She was born in coach, but she 
got first-class treatment,'' said Lt. Dan Carbonaro, a Port Authority 
police tour commander, who witnessed the birth and joined in the applause 
of the flight attendants and cockpit crew of Ghana Airways Flight 
150, as the 6 pound, 9 ounce infant began to cry. The mother, Janet 
Omolara Osita, 27, of Hassan, Nigeria, who was traveling alone to 
New York to visit relatives, gave birth to the as-yet-unnamed child 
across a row of seats with the help of officers George Howard and 
Doris Caridi, and two airport paramedics, Maureen Boyd and Mark Schauber. 
Afterward, the infant was wrapped in an airplane blanket and handed 
to her crying, beaming mother. They were taken by ambulance to Jamaica 
Hospital, where Michael Hinck, a spokesman, said mother and child 
were doing fine. ``The Port Authority officers did a great job,'' 
he said. ``Everything came out great.'' The birth in a plane on the 
tarmac at Kennedy Airport did not automatically confer U.S. citizenship 
on the infant, Carbonaro noted. ``She was technically born in Ghana 
because the plane had not been received by U.S. Customs,'' he said. 
``The plane was still legally in the country of origin.'' While doctors 
advise women not to travel by air in the last trimester of a pregnancy, 
airlines have no regulations prohibiting such travel, the lieutenant 
said. And with about six weeks remaining to her due date, Ms. Osita 
apparently had no hint that the birth was near when she boarded the 
flight Friday night in Accra, Ghana. Toward the end of the seven-hour 
flight, however, Ms. Osita went into labor, which progressed rapidly. 
Moreover, the flight, which had been scheduled to land at 7:15 a.m., 
was about 20 minutes late. But the pilots radioed ahead and the Port 
Authority police were alerted at 7:27 a.m. Nearly all Port Authority 
police officers are trained in emergency medical treatment, including 
birth deliveries, and, as it happened, Howard, a 41-year-old father 
of two boys, had assisted in a birth once before, 20 years ago as 
a volunteer firefighter on Long Island. Howard and Caridi, along with 
the paramedics, were waiting at the gate of Terminal 4, the International 
Arrivals Building, when Flight 150, a McDonnell Douglas wide-bodied 
MD-11 with several hundred passengers aboard, drew up and opened the 
hatches about 7:35 a.m. As the plane's crew escorted passengers out, 
the officers and paramedics hurried aboard. ``The baby had already 
started to crown,'' said Howard, a policeman for 13 years. ``It was 
in the birth canal.'' The mother, he said, was laid across several 
seats in the center of the coach section. ``We just worked with her,'' 
he said. ``It was natural childbirth. She gave it a good push and 
after a couple of minutes the baby came out. One portion of the head 
came out and turned to one side. Then the shoulders came out, then 
the rest of the baby. I clamped the cord and cut it.'' It was 7:48 
a.m., someone noticed. ``Doris was comforting the mother while I delivered,'' 
Howard said. ``Then Doris wrapped the baby in a blanket and handed 
her to the mother. I was pretty calm, but it was exciting.'' Amid 
the tears of the smiling mother, Carbonaro recalled a moment of deep 
joy. ``The flight crew was there and they all started applauding,'' 
he said. ``Normally we deal in a lot of negative things. But when 
I heard the baby start to cry, well, it really felt good. It's a great 
uplift, especially in the holiday season.''
