The White House legal team wants at least three days to explain why 
President Clinton shouldn't be impeached. The house Judiciary committee 
is offering one. Mr. Clinton's lawyers say they want to discuss the 
constitutional standard for impeachment and the legal standards for 
perjury and obstruction of justice. Committee chairman Henry Hyde 
has not yet commented on their demands. Other republicans on the committee 
call them delaying tactics designed to push the inquiry into the hands 
of the new Congress, which will have more democrats.
