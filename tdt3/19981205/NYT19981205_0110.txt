It is reading week, the week before exams, and the students at Northwestern 
University are actually reading. Besides Proust and organic chemistry, 
they are looking at headlines: ``4 are indicted in N.U. football scandal.'' 
To the outside world, the indictments of four former Northwestern 
football players on Thursday may have appeared to be a joke: that 
even one of the great private research universities has two gambling 
scandals in a single year. Only a week after two Northwestern basketball 
players were sentenced to prison terms of one to two months for trying 
to fix three games, the Wildcat football players were accused of lying 
to a federal grand jury when they denied betting on Northwestern games 
in 1994. Northwestern's suspected point-shavers may have higher median 
SAT scores than those of other universities' point-shavers, but on 
sports-talk radio programs in Chicago, the main word used by callers 
to describe the players was ``dumb.'' Sports cheating is usually seen 
as a symptom of an overzealous attempt to win at all costs. But the 
Northwestern basketball and football players are accused of trying 
to lose by more than predicted by the point spread. One player was 
accused of fumbling the ball on the goal line against Iowa to protect 
a bet. On Northwestern's leaf-blown campus, beside Lake Michigan and 
just north of Chicago, the accusations appeared to pain many faculty 
members, students and alumni. Just across the street from campus at 
Gary Barnett's sports bar and restaurant, owned by the school's head 
football coach, the women's basketball team gathered on Friday afternoon 
for an early supper before their game against Ohio University. On 
the wall hung the portrait of the 1995 football team, which lost to 
the University of Southern California in the Rose Bowl, many of its 
players teammates of the four suspected gamblers who played on a losing 
1994 team. ``It's a very sad thing for Northwestern,'' whispered Don 
Perrelli, the women's basketball coach for 14 seasons, who did not 
want his players to hear him. ``We're family. What we're doing here, 
having a meal, it's a family thing. As a coach, you could never think 
that a member of your family was playing to lose.'' The indictments 
sent the university's athletic department and what it calls its ``revenue 
sports'' into a defensive crouch. As an airline will drape a cloth 
over its logo on a crashed jet, Northwestern had no Wildcat logos 
at its news conference on Thursday and no purple bunting. Gary Barnett, 
who became the football coach in 1992, two years before the suspected 
gambling, offered this assessment of the charges: ``The stain is on 
the individuals, not on the school. It doesn't indict a program. It 
doesn't indict the school. It indicts the individuals.'' The local 
and national sports pages were aflame with criticism of Northwestern 
for deflecting responsibility for the suspected gambling. Rick Telander, 
a sports columnist for The Chicago Sun-Times, was angry. An alumnus 
and former Northwestern athlete, Telander wrote, ``I want out of here'' 
in a column from the Northwestern athletic club, where his photo hangs 
on the wall in football gear. ``Not out of the room,'' he wrote. ``Out 
of the university. Out of the athletic `family.' Out of any connection 
with this two-faced, sanctimonious, smug, holier-than-thou, elitist 
university and its athletic department led by how-could-they-do-this-to-me 
athletic director Rick Taylor and know-nothing football coach Gary 
Barnett.'' Of course, the university administrators acknowledged, 
Northwestern has had its share of student drinkers, drug users and 
gamblers. But the university said again and again that it acted as 
soon as it caught wind of the gambling, hiring a former assistant 
U.S. attorney to investigate, and it turned over its findings to the 
federal authorities and the NCAA. The university also has imposed 
a ``zero tolerance'' policy on gambling by any athlete. Anti-gambling 
literature from the NCAA is distributed to athletes six to eight times 
a year. Starting this year, every team must watch a video about the 
perils of sports gambling. The coaches and players gather once each 
spring to hear a speaker like a reformed gambler or a former FBI agent 
who has investigated sports gambling. ``The columnists want heads 
to roll,'' said Alan Cubbage, Northwestern's vice president for university 
relations. ``Fire the coach and athletic director after they did what 
they're supposed to and reported it immediately to the university 
administration? Did they know what was going on? Did they fail to 
report it? Did they cover it up? The answer is no, no, no.'' Northwestern 
asked reporters not to interview students. ``It's reading week and 
they need to focus,'' Cubbage said. But students on campus shared 
mixed emotions. ``I think the university is definitely responsible,'' 
said Tracy Horton, a junior history major from Flint, Mich. ``I read 
that Northwestern wasn't getting sanctioned at all. I don't think 
that's right at all. It is a family, but in a family you take responsibility.'' 
On the other hand, Ms. Horton said she would not want the football 
coach to be dismissed (except for this year's 3-9 finish) or for Northwestern's 
reputation to be damaged. ``I think no one expected something like 
this to happen here because we're supposed to be so smart.'' Chris 
McCoy, a sophomore chemistry student from Topeka, Kan., said, ``From 
what I've heard, the university handled this absolutely correctly 
and did everything they should.'' Some students expressed sympathy 
for the scholarship athletes, who apparently got into debt with gamblers. 
After years as star high school athletes, they found themselves at 
the end of another losing season on a campus where athletes were not 
much revered. Other students saw no excuse for athletes betting against 
their team. ``I have no sympathy for them,'' McCoy said. ``It was 
just a dumb thing to do. I can imagine how frustrated their teammates 
must feel, working so hard all year.'' Several students said they 
knew of other students who gambled on sports and would have no trouble 
finding a place to place a bet. Another student said he and his fraternity 
buddies could not find a bookmaker on campus so they sent a $200 check 
to open an account in Antigua and now call a toll-free number to place 
their bets. Jeanne Brei, class of 1983, is an entertainer in Las Vegas 
and a rabid Northwestern football fan. ``When I was at the school, 
it was the academic ideal that was most important, not sports,'' Ms. 
Brei said. ``And now it seems it's the money. And that's not what 
Northwestern is supposed to be all about. ``So I was very, very disappointed 
that some of our guys would do something like this,'' she said. ``I 
mean, people are basically there to study.''
