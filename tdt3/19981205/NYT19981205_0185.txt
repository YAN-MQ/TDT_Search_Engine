Cleopa, an Orthodox monk who once fled communist pressure by becoming 
an anchorite in Romania's forests, died last week in the remote monastery 
where his down-to-earth teachings came to attract large and steady 
streams of pilgrims. He was 87. Romanian Orthodox officials in Bucharest, 
who reported his death on Thursday, said he succumbed to the illnesses 
of age. He was to be buried at the 14th-century Sihastra Monastery, 
200 miles north of Bucharest, where an amphitheater was constructed 
after 1989 to accommodate the growing numbers of visitors eager to 
hear Cleopa's teachings. In accordance with an tradition traced to 
Gregory of Sinai, a 14th-century saint, Orthodox officials said Cleopa's 
body would be lowered directly into the ground seated on a small stool, 
as a mark of respect for a life of particular asceticism. In a recent 
article posted on a Romanian language Web site devoted to Cleopa's 
teaching, he was described at a recent appearance as being frail as 
he greeted visitors while being carried by younger monks. ``I am Uncle 
Moldy,'' he was quoted as saying, ``with one foot in the grave and 
the other on earth.'' Then he declared, ``life is a fight against 
the body, the world, the devil and death.'' A child of illiterate 
peasants who was born in northern Romania, Cleopa entered the Sihastra 
Monastery in 1934, when he was 25, taking a single name as is customary 
for monks. As he cared for the monastery's sheep, he quickly gained 
respect within the religious community for his remarkable memory. 
``He could recite long sections of scripture and the teachings of 
the church fathers by heart,'' recalled the Rev. Roman Braga, a 77-year-old 
priest who is the spiritual leader at the Romanian Orthodox convent 
of the Dormition of the Mother of God in Rives Junction, Mich. ``I 
met Brother Cleopa in between my prison terms,'' said Braga, who spent 
11 years in custody in communist Romania. ``I had heard of him and 
traveled to see him in the early 1950s. He was not highly educated, 
but he was able to speak in simple ways that were at the same time 
very deep and went to the heart of his listeners. ``He spoke of ordinary 
things but in ways that made you think of God. I remember how joyful 
he was. He kept saying that life was a gift and he had his special 
way of greeting you; he would say, `May Heaven consume you.''' By 
the time Braga met the monk, Cleopa had returned from his years of 
solitude. As Braga told the story, the monk had spent 12 years as 
a shepherd when the old abbot of Sihastra died. The monks elected 
Cleopa to be the new abbot. After that, his reputation spread and 
people began traveling to the remote monastery to seek his absolution 
and guidance. After 1948, when Communists consolidated their control 
over Romania, such visits brought Cleopa to the critical attention 
of state authorities, police and even some fellow churchmen. ``He 
was told to tell the people who were coming to see him, to go away, 
to stop coming, but he could not do that,'' said Braga. ``Instead, 
sometime around 1950, he left the monastery and became a hermit. He 
went into the mountain forests, living in solitude in an underground 
den he built. Woodsmen brought him sacks of potatoes each month and 
every day he would eat one potato.'' Braga said that after Stalin 
died in 1953, pressure on the Orthodox Church eased and Cleopa was 
able to return to the monastery. His reputation for wisdom and good 
humor grew and so, too, did the number of visitors, first during years 
that the country was ruled by Nicolae Ceausescu and then even more 
markedly after the fall of the dictator in 1989. In the last decade 
of his life, Cleopa was invited to lecture at universities. His sermons 
were gathered and published under the title ``Talks with Brother Cleopa'' 
and were posted on the Internet. Some were translated into English 
and published in Sobornost, an ecumenical Orthodox and Anglican journal 
published in Oxford.
