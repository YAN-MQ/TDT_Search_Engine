Mo Lewis didn't make any early-morning trips into the city last week. 
The New York Jets linebacker usually goes to martial-arts classes 
three days a week from 6:30 to 7:30 a.m., but, he said: ``I've stopped 
now. This is a crucial moment for us.'' Indeed, the Jets (8-4) are 
entering the crucial point of the season with four games to go, including 
Sunday's matchup with the Seattle Seahawks at Giants Stadium in East 
Rutherford, N.J. Lewis, who has started all 105 games he has played 
for the team, doesn't want to jeopardize the Jets' chances of making 
the playoffs for only the second time in his eight-season career. 
So he is temporarily forgoing the lessons that made him a first-degree 
black belt in both karate and taekwondo and funneling those skills 
onto the football field. He hasn't always been this intense, this 
focused. Although Lewis was the Jets' leading tackler from 1992-94, 
he went into a two-year tailspin during the disastrous Rich Kotite 
years. Now, in his second season under coach Bill Parcells, he is 
playing at a peak again. He leads the Jets in sacks with 6, and in 
solo tackles with 54. He has produced 2 interceptions, recovered a 
fumble, forced another, and batted down 4 passes. Two games ago, Lewis 
brought down one of the top runners in football, the Oilers' Eddie 
George, with a one-armed tackle that made all of the highlight shows. 
At moments like that, the 6-foot-3-inch, 258-pound Lewis is an avenging 
force of pure power. He is doing all of this with a technique that 
Parcells _ who built his career around coaching linebackers _ called 
unique. ``He has a funny stance, gets tight, like in a little shell,'' 
Parcells said. ``I had never seen anyone do that before. Mo lines 
up with his hands up front, together. It's a funny appearance. He's 
all wound up.'' It's a style that Lewis adapted from his martial arts 
training, in which many of the moves start from a coiled position. 
He said he does it because it helps him react and attack more quickly. 
Yet, Lewis is careful to separate that aggressive football persona 
from his life at home with his wife, Christalyn, and his sons, Morris 
IV, 3, and Christopher Wiley, 11 months. ``I don't take my job home 
to my wife,'' he said. ``People view football players as aggressive. 
You hear about some players who come home angry. She has enough to 
worry about with my two boys. The only reaction she knows about a 
game I just played is when she drives me home in the car. If we won, 
I'm smiling all the way home. If we lose, I don't say a word.'' Until 
Parcells closed practices, Christalyn often watched. ``I used to see 
how aggressive he is on the field, but he wears two hats,'' she said. 
``When he comes home, he's husband and daddy. He is attentive and 
passive, especially since the kids were born.'' In the off season, 
in his home in Marietta, Ga., Lewis doesn't talk or think football. 
``I go bass fishing,'' he said. ``It puts everything in the past.'' 
He said he once caught a 10-pounder and this past off season landed 
a $25,000 first prize in a bass-fishing competition. He also pursues 
his study of the martial arts, a fascination he has had since he was 
5 years old and saw the movie ``Enter the Dragon.'' ``I liked the 
self-confidence Bruce Lee had,'' Lewis recalled. ``Cowboys carry guns. 
This was something different.'' Lewis' mother wasn't thrilled with 
his hobby. ``She said there was too much feet involved,'' Lewis said. 
``Too much kicking and jumping. My father was OK with it. He was a 
boxer. He was trying to make a living at boxing but after I was born, 
he decided to get a regular job.'' Through high school in Atlanta, 
Lewis starred in football and baseball, no doubt using some of the 
hand-eye coordination developed in the dojo. He was good enough as 
a pitcher to be drafted by the Pittsburgh Pirates, but Lewis' father, 
Morris II, insisted that he go to college. Ray Sherman, who later 
would become the Jets' offensive coordinator for one season, tried 
to recruit him to play as a tight end at Purdue. ``I had big hands 
and he thought I'd be good at the position,'' Lewis said. ``But growing 
up in Georgia, there was only one school for me.'' That was the University 
of Georgia, and although Sherman eventually moved there, too, Lewis 
played linebacker for the Bulldogs. He developed into an all-Southeastern 
Conference player, but he said the best thing about college was ``I 
met my wife.'' Christalyn was a pre-med major and Lewis said her father 
didn't want her to get married until she got her degree. ``She switched 
majors and graduated sooner and then we got married,'' Lewis said. 
Then he met the Jets, who selected him in the third round of the 1991 
draft. ``I said, `Who's on the Jets? Where are the Jets?''' Lewis 
recalled. ``The only ones I could think about were Freeman McNeil 
and Al Toon.'' Still, Lewis flowered in the defense run by Pete Carroll, 
and in 1994 produced a stunning 114 individual tackles along with 
4 interceptions. ``But then everything went out of me,'' he said as 
he considered the frustration of winning only three games in 1995. 
The self-reliant Lewis could not stand losing, and didn't know how 
to cope with the feeling. Something else happened that year, just 
when it appeared he was going to gain league-wide recognition: he 
started getting paid like a star. The new Jets regime headed by Kotite 
rewarded him with a deal that included a $2.1 million signing bonus. 
It was an acknowledgment of his consistent team-leading tackling, 
his aggressive play, his ability. ``Some players get to a plateau 
and get complacent,'' he said. ``I got complacent. It lasted two years.'' 
His 1995 and 1996 seasons were not only debacles for the team, which 
went 3-13 and then 1-15, they were aimless years for Lewis. His weight 
ballooned into the 290's. He sustained the first _ and only _ injury 
that has sidelined him, a torn pectoral muscle that kept him out of 
the final nine games of '96. Teammates who had previously talked of 
him going to the Pro Bowl now joked that he had someone else sign 
in for him when he was supposed to be in the weight room. ``Baseball 
was my first love, then fishing, and karate,'' Lewis said. ``But even 
though football wasn't No. 1, I always wanted to compete. And when 
that left me, I knew there was something wrong there.'' Enter Parcells, 
the linebacker expert whose Giants and Patriots teams were defined 
by the position. ``Two years before I came here I voted for him for 
the Pro Bowl,'' Parcells said. But in the new coach's tough off-season 
program, Lewis turned out to be a comparative rookie, and a soft one 
at that. ``He's a physical player,'' Parcells said, ``but he came 
to me after our first meeting and said he didn't know anything about 
weight-lifting.'' Lewis seemed embarrassed about it. ``They get insecure,'' 
said Parcells. ``They walk into that weight room and see other guys 
doing it and they don't know how.'' After they met for the first time, 
Lewis said he wanted to return to the linebacker he had been. ``I 
knew I was challenged again,'' he said. ``Am I going to let him dictate 
what I do _ or do I go out there? I dropped my weight. He wanted me 
mainly over the tight end. Now I have more chances to roam. I know 
I scared a lot people with my size _ at 260 pounds, they didn't think 
I could move. But I can move.'' Parcells recognized Lewis' explosiveness 
and quickness and tried to exploit them. During the 1997 exhibition 
season, he switched Lewis from the weakside spot to the more active 
strongside position. ``I was trying to find the right spot for him,'' 
Parcells said. He apparently has found it. In each of the Jets' last 
two victories, Lewis led the defense with 10 tackles and throughout 
the season he has been the most stable force on the linebacking corps, 
which has gone through a dramatic upheaval. Before the season started, 
he and Marvin Jones and James Farrior were the starters. Then Jones 
suffered season-ending knee surgery, and Farrior had a knee injury 
that sidelined him. Linebackers coach Al Groh and defensive coordinator 
Bill Belichick mixed and matched the openings with Bryan Cox and Pepper 
Johnson and Chad Cascadden and now that Farrior is healthy, he can't 
get his starting job back. Lewis has been the constant on the unit. 
He has been constantly good, as well, with his pass-rushing, pass 
defense and tackling. Best of all, with a victory against the Seahawks, 
the Jets would remain at least tied for first with Miami in the American 
Football Conference East Division. And those bad days? ``Losing brings 
a lot of misery onto anybody,'' Lewis said. ``I was brought up to 
believe even when you get kicked down you can come back. We went from 
3-13, the worst club record, and next year we went 1-15.'' These days, 
though, the Jets and Lewis are pummeling opponents, or, as Lewis likes 
to say, ``Killing a gnat with a sledgehammer.'' He doesn't want to 
waste any more chances.
