Saudi Finance Minister Ibrahim al-Assaf has denied that his country 
is trying to borrow dlrs 5 billion from the United Arab Emirates, 
the Asharq Alawsat newspaper reported Saturday. Al-Assaf said that 
although the budget had swelled beyond the government's expectations, 
authorities will continue to cover the budget gap by borrowing from 
local banks. The London-based Financial Times reported Friday that 
Saudi Arabia is looking for a dlrs 5 billion loan from the Emirates 
to help cover its budget deficit. Saudi Arabia had originally projected 
a dlrs 4.8 billion deficit but analysts predict the deficit to reach 
dlrs 15 billion by the end of the year. Saudi Arabia has been hit 
hard by low prices of oil, its economic mainstay.
