Pope John Paul II has extended a planned visit to his native Poland 
and may address parliament while in Warsaw, a newspaper reported Saturday. 
The pope's trip will begin June 5 and last until June 14, one day 
longer than originally planned, according to the daily newspaper Zycie. 
He has added new cities to his itinerary _ Stary Sacz, Sosnowiec and 
Gliwice, all in the south _ increasing his stops to 19. The newspaper 
also said a parliament address is likely what government spokesman 
Jaroslaw Selling meant when he said he expected a ``political surprise'' 
during the pope's visit. The trip would be John Paul's eighth to Poland 
since becoming pope in 1978. During his stay, he is expected to beatify 
more than 100 Poles killed under Nazi occupation. Warsaw will be the 
last leg of a tour that probably will begin with a mass at the Baltic 
coast resort of Sopot. Other stops: the coastal cities of Gdansk and 
Oliwa, and nearby Pelplin and Elblag; Bydgoszcz, Torun, Elk and Wigry 
in the north; Lichen, Lowicz, Siedlce and Drohiczyn in central and 
eastern Poland; and Krakow, Sandomierz, Zamosc in the south. The extra 
cities were added during a planning visit by Vatican envoy the Rev. 
Roberto Tucci. Tucci leaves Poland on Saturday.
