For a Hollywood studio, redoing a classic is always a risk. For Universal 
Pictures, troubled by a recent series of flops, remaking ``Psycho'' 
was risky, and weird. After all, Gus Van Sant, the versatile director 
of ``Good Will Hunting,'' has not merely remade Alfred Hitchcock's 
1960 thriller. He has replicated it shot for shot, using the same 
script, the same mesmerizing score by Bernard Herrmann and the same 
Saul Bass titles. The only significant difference besides casting 
is that the new movie is in color rather than black and white. If 
there is a precedent to Van Sant's odd enterprise, it can be found 
in a satiric story by Jorge Luis Borges, ``Pierre Menard, Author of 
the Quixote.'' In it, an obscure novelist produces a masterpiece consisting 
entirely of parts of the original ``Don Quixote.'' Analyzing the new 
work, scholars find many improvements over the 17th-century version, 
including subtle references to Nietzsche, William James and biographical 
details from Menard's life. ``Psycho'' is one of the most influential 
and carefully analyzed movies ever made. Maybe Van Sant wants film 
buffs to have a Borgesian field day with the remake. No doubt Universal 
wants the movie to make money and mop up the red ink from ``Meet Joe 
Black,'' ``Babe: Pig in the City'' and other recent box-office duds 
that led to the ouster of the studio chairman last week. Whatever 
the director's intent, the audience reaction today cannot help but 
be different from that of 1960, in part because of the movies since 
then that were influenced by ``Psycho.'' With its graphic depiction 
of sexual repression, perversion and madness, the first ``Psycho'' 
effectively proclaimed the end of the buttoned-up 1950s. But its scenes 
of violence are chaste by the standards of the slasher movies, crazed 
killers and shock value of today. At the opening Friday, I found the 
new version both off-putting and seductive, like a new production 
of a familiar opera. The dialogue, almost unaltered, seems dated, 
but the double-entendres are funnier the second time around. Critics 
may dwell on the few minor changes in the new version. But over all, 
the images remind you what a monumental film achievement ``Psycho'' 
was. There are people, especially women, who still get nervous alone 
in the shower thinking of naked and vulnerable Janet Leigh, slashed 
to death in a 45-second scene of horror that took Hitchcock seven 
days and 70 camera setups to film. In 1960, he appealed to audiences 
not to spill the movie's secrets, especially the female lead's murder 
halfway through the film. People remember it the way they remember 
where they were when President Kennedy was killed. Yet the new version 
features the shower murder (with Anne Heche) in its own lurid ads. 
When she undresses in that creepy motel, you wonder why she doesn't 
remember the original movie. Yet the shock of ``Psycho'' remains potent. 
More than the acting, more than the story, more than the message, 
Hitchcock maintained that ``Psycho'' stirred feelings of terror, surprise 
and attraction by its camera work, technique and other elements of 
``pure cinema,'' carefully preserved in the remake. A few years after 
the movie, Hitchcock told French director Francois Truffaut that ``Psycho'' 
was, more than his other movies, ``a film that belongs to filmmakers, 
to you and me.'' Different fans remember different enduring images. 
For some, it is the driving rain and slashing windshield-wiper blades 
that foreshadow the first murder. Others will always be haunted by 
the constant use of the double-image of mirrors, evoking the theme 
of split personality, or the way the opening voyeuristic shot through 
a hotel window prefigures Anthony Perkins spying on his prey, or simply 
the way Hitchcock uses agile camera work to disguise the mother's 
identity without making you suspicious of the trick he is playing. 
No wonder Van Sant realized he could not remake the movie without 
preserving Hitchcock's mordantly elegant story-telling and the haunting 
Herrmann music. On the other hand, nearly 40 years after the original, 
the premises of the plot are more absurd than ever. The psychologizing 
about Norman Bates' supposed psychosis seems forced and the clunky 
police dialogue sounds like something out of ``Dragnet.'' Mental health 
professionals say that, more than any other film, ``Psycho'' stigmatized 
mental illness for Americans. Sen. Pete Domenici, R-N.M., an advocate 
for the rights of the mentally disabled, even wrote to Edgar Bronfman 
Jr., principal owner of the studio, asking for the remake to include 
a preface noting the great strides in treating the mentally ill since 
1960. Universal turned Domenici down flat. In fact, the remake shows 
the psychologizing to be more flawed dramaturgically than scientifically. 
Just the same, if Hitchcock were alive, he would be hoping that a 
new generation of viewers would always think twice about getting into 
the shower in a lonely motel room.
