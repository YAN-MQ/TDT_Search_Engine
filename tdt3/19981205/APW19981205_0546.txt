An Italian who was arrested this week for carrying illegal drugs was 
found dead Saturday in a Cairo police station, security officials 
said. Angelo Maria Micali, 38, who owns an alcohol shop in Cairo, 
was found dead by his cell mates in the Giza police station, said 
the officials, speaking on condition of anonymity. They said it was 
not clear how he died and an autopsy has been ordered. The Italian 
embassy was closed for the weekend and diplomats were not available 
outside for comment. Police said Michaeli and an Egyptian friend of 
his were detained Monday in the Red Sea resort of Sharm el-Sheik after 
they were found in possession of 140,000 pills of Rohypnol, a synthetic 
drug. Rohypnol is a prescribed hypnotic and muscle relaxant that has 
been widely sold to youngsters as a pleasure-giving agent. In the 
United States it is called the ``date-rape drug.'' After his arrest, 
Michaeli was kept in police custody for four days pending further 
investigations, and the term was extended by 15 days, said the officials. 
It was not clear since when Michaeli had been living in Egypt. No 
charges had been filed against Michaeli but smuggling of drugs is 
usually punished by death in Egypt.
