A woman and a baby are dead after a police Van ran into the crowd 
at a Holiday parade in Minneapolis. Several people were hurt. Police 
say the Van was being used to pick up intoxicated spectators when 
it lurched forward. I seen the cop take one of these drunk guys to 
have street and put them in the back of the Van. All of a sudden, 
the Van gunned off, just sped out of control. And hit one cop car 
and then ran into the thing. Right into the crowd of people. The investigation 
into the accident will be conducted by the Minnesota state patrol.
