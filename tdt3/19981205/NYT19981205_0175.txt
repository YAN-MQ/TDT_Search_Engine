For nearly six years, the women fought to keep their home, a century-old 
low-rent residence in Manhattan catering to single women, from closing 
its doors. Even when the eviction orders came, they refused to go. 
But on Saturday, finally accepting that their exodus was inevitable, 
the last three tenants gathered their belongings in duffel bags and 
boxes, and quietly left Leo House, which is operated by a nonprofit 
group affiliated with Catholic Charities. About 150 supporters, including 
politicians and housing advocates, stood outside the building's entrance, 
at 322 West 23rd St., cheering on Mary Anne Aitken, Catherine Klemann 
and Georgia Upshaw. ``Our fight is over now,'' Ms. Aitken said, as 
a young boy presented her with a bouquet of carnations and a group 
of picketers chanted: ``Affordable housing is no more. The Leo House 
has closed the door.'' Ms. Aitken, 38, and two other women were the 
final members of a group of 28 women who had fought to continue living 
in an annex of Leo House when the eviction effort began in March 1993. 
Over the years, their landlord, the Leo House for German Catholic 
Emigrants, a nonprofit organization, has said it wanted to remove 
long-term tenants to serve more short-term occupants. But the women 
fought all the way to state Supreme Court, claiming that their landlord 
was violating rent-stabilization laws protecting long-term tenants. 
Last February the court ruled in favor of Leo House. Ms. Aitken, who 
plans to move into a studio apartment in the Flatbush section of Brooklyn, 
said she and the other tenants were charged about $300 a month in 
rent. Another of the women, Catherine Klemann, 33, who lived in the 
building since 1984, said she was unsure where she would go. Her new 
apartment in the Hell's Kitchen neighborhood will not be ready to 
move into for at least another week. She and a group of community 
leaders said that they intended to ask the building's managers for 
an additional week. ``At this point, I'd rather be moving into my 
own place, but I have no place to go until it's ready,'' she said. 
A lawyer for Leo House called the women's protest unfair and misguided. 
He said two of the women stopped paying rent long ago, one in September 
1997 and the other last May. ``These women are by most standards not 
entitled to charity,'' the lawyer, Jared Brown, said. ``They are working 
women. The Leo House won the right to evict them and just throw them 
into the streets. That never happened, because the board wanted to 
be fair.'' The women had hoped Cardinal John O'Connor, who once served 
on the Leo House board, would intervene and offer them a last-minute 
reprieve. They met with the cardinal last month. The spokesman for 
the archdiocese of New York, Joseph Zwilling, did not immediately 
return phone calls to his office and home Saturday. But Brown said 
the archdiocese gives no money to Leo House, only referring people 
there through Catholic Charities. The complex, opened in 1889 for 
German Catholic immigrant women, is made up of a 59-room hotel that 
has charged guests $55 to $80 a day, and the annex, where tenants 
paid $45 to $70 a week. The hotel will remain in operation, mostly 
for travelers who are visiting sick or infirm people in New York City, 
but plans for the annex remain unresolved, Brown said. Several community 
housing organizations said that they planned to continue the women's 
fight, pressuring the board to provide some form of affordable housing. 
``It isn't very charitable or humane for a church organization to 
throw people out just for a more profitable investment,'' said Jane 
Wood, a longtime organizer of the Chelsea Coalition on Housing.
