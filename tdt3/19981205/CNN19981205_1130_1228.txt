The nation's undefeated get one more shot. I'm Anthony Keith James, 
and this is "CNN Headline Sports." To say this is a big day in college 
football is putting it mildly. It's a huge day. Especially if you're 
undefeated with your sights on national title. Tennessee and UCLA 
have the inside track since they are top two teams in the bowl championship 
series, the much maligned system that determines the participants 
for the fiesta bowl in tempe, Arizona. But first, the top-ranked Vols 
at 11-0 have to take care of number 22 mississippi state in tonight's 
SEC title game at the Georgia dome. The bulldogs stand between them 
and a date in the fiesta bowl. As far bcs, you know, we gotta win 
this football game to be southeastern conference champions. And that's 
our only concern at this point. If we win this ball game, then we 
have a chance, I think, to play for a National championship. Yeah, 
we feel that we're overlooked. But, you know, we only -- we know what 
we can do. And, you know, we just have a chance to prove it to everybody. 
There's no question that this would be the biggest win of the Mississippi 
state in modern history. Meanwhile, UCLA will attempt to clear its 
final hurdle on the way to a shot at a national title. The Bruins 
at 10-0 out to protect their 20-game win streak win a win on the road 
over the 7-3 hurricanes. This game was earlier postponed because of 
hurricane georges. K state, ranked third in the bcs, is keeping its 
fingers crossed in hopes of an upset of one, if not both, of the top 
two teams. The 11-0 Wildcats take on 10-2 Texas A&M in the big 12 
title game in St. louis. One other title game to mention -- brigham 
young runs with air force in the wac championship. Despite the outcome, 
air force will play in Hawaii on Christmas day. Byu takes on Tulane 
in the liberty bowl on new year's eve. In case you missed it, Marshall 
is going to the motor city bowl for the second straight year as the 
midamerican conference champ. The thundering herd beat toledo 23-17 
for the Mac title. Marshall takes on Louisville in the motor city 
bowl on the 23rd of this month.
