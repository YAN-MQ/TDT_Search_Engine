Massachusetts hung on to defeat Lehigh, 27-21, Saturday in a Division 
I-AA quarterfinal game. Lehigh quarterback Phil Stambaugh, facing 
a fourth-and-15 at UMass' 16-yard line, threw the ball out of the 
end zone to set off a rush of fans onto the field. The Minutemen (10-3), 
making their first playoff appearance since 1990, will play Northwestern 
State, a 31-20 winner over Appalachian State, in a semifinal next 
Saturday. Massachusetts' smallest player, the 5-foot-7-inch, 151-pound 
Adrian Zullo, dragged Caliphe Buchanan into the end zone to complete 
a 37-yard scoring pass from Todd Bankhead, giving UMass a 20-14 lead 
heading into the fourth quarter. Place-kicker Jason Cherry, who earlier 
missed a 25-yard field-goal attempt, was not called on when UMass 
faced a fourth-and-goal at the 1-yard line on its next possession. 
Marcel Shipp squirted in for the touchdown to give UMass a 27-14 with 
11 minutes 17 seconds to go. The Minutemen were nearing their first 
playoff victory since 1978. In 1990, its last appearance, UMass lost 
to William &AMP; Mary, 38-0. Lehigh, making its first postseason appearance 
since 1980, appeared headed for its first defeat in 14 games spanning 
back to last season. But Lehigh fought back. Stambaugh rifled a 42-yard 
completion to receiver Deron Braswell to set up the Mountain Hawks 
at the UMass 34 with 8:30 left. Stambaugh burrowed in from the 1 to 
cap the 10-play, 81-yard drive, closing the gap to 27-21. Trailing 
14-13 with 8:35 left in the third quarter, the Minutemen had a chance 
to regain the lead on a 25-yard field-goal attempt by Cherry, but 
he hooked the ball into the left goal post. UMass had marched to the 
Lehigh 2, but two penalties _ the second one declined _ left them 
to rely on their iffy kicking game. Cherry, who replaced Matt Murphy 
at midseason, had attempted only three field goals before Saturday, 
and has not inspired confidence with low, weak kicks. After Lehigh's 
next drive stalled, it got the ball right back when Kevin Quinlan's 
fumble on the punt return was recovered by Bryant Appling at the Lehigh 
45. A 40-yard connection between Stambaugh and Rick Moore was called 
back because Moore was called for pushing off. Lehigh only went backward 
from there and had to punt. Massachusetts seized a 10-3 lead after 
a 30-yard touchdown pass from Bankhead to Jimmy Moore. Moore bobbled 
the ball with defensive back Kevin Joseph approaching, but managed 
to hang on to cap the 95-yard, nine-play drive. Massachusetts linebacker 
Kole Ayi knocked the ball from Deron Braswell's hands on the next 
possession, and cornerback Mike Smith recovered at the Lehigh 19 yard 
line. The Minutemen settled for Cherry's second field goal of the 
half, a 33-yarder, to increase their cushion to 13-7. Massachusetts, 
asserting its size advantage in the interior, was building momentum. 
On the ensuing Lehigh possession, a blitzing Ayi smothered Stambaugh 
for a 13-yard loss to force a punt. The Minutemen took a huge gamble 
on the next possession, and it paid off in the short run. Bankhead 
surged a yard on a fourth-and-1 to the UMass 29, keeping the Minutemen's 
next drive alive. But later, linebacker James Young hit Bankhead as 
he threw, sending a wobbly pass into the hands of Lehigh's Saundrell 
Davison at the Mountain Hawks' 48. A few plays later, Lehigh tailback 
Ron Jean sprinted 41 yards before Smith tackled him from behind. Jean, 
who rushed for 82 yards on 12 carries in the first half, finished 
off the drive with a 1-yard run, his second touchdown. Lehigh tried 
to increase its 14-13 lead on Stambaugh's last-second 50-yard heave 
into the end zone, but it fell to the ground.
