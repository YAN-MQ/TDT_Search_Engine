Cuban authorities have broken up a drug smuggling ring involving Canadians, 
Jamaicans and Britons who allegedly attempted to carry cocaine and 
hash from Jamaica to Great Britain, Cuba's official newspaper reported 
Saturday. Eighteen foreigners were arrested in separate operations 
between Nov. 6 and Nov. 16, most at Havana's Jose Marti International 
Airport, the daily Granma reported on its Web site, monitored in Mexico 
City. On Nov. 6, Customs and Interior Ministry agents arrested three 
Jamaicans carrying nearly 3 pounds (1.3 kilos) of hash from Montego 
Bay, Jamaica. The suspects said they were to deliver the hash to a 
Canadian in Cuba, according to the report. Over the next five days, 
agents arrested seven Canadians _ four men and three women _ who had 
arrived in Cuba from Montego Bay, Jamaica, with a total of nearly 
83.5 pounds (38 kilos) of cocaine in their suitcases. The seven were 
bound for Great Britain. Authorities later arrested four other Jamaicans, 
carrying a total of 34.5 pounds (15.65 kilos) of cocaine, who said 
four British citizens were in charge of taking the drugs out of Cuba. 
The Britons were arrested on Nov. 16. The names of the suspects were 
not released. Granma said 17 suspects remained in custody. A pregnant 
Canadian woman was returned to her country. The report said Canadian, 
Jamaican and British authorities were cooperating in the investigation 
of the alleged ring.
