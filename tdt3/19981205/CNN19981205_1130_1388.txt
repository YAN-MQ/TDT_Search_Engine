Mornings seem so much brighter after a good night's sleep. That's 
why I love my Tylenol pm. It stops my pain and helps me sleep so in 
the morning I'm rested, refreshed... ready to make the most of my 
day. It's... hey, Peter Lynch, the fidelity guy. Hey, Don, working 
hard? Vegas, Atlantic City. The airlines know me so well they call 
ahead and say they lost my luggage. Changing jobs so much you should 
take your retirement money with you. I've got money sitting in places 
even my in-laws couldn't find. Roll that money over. Really? Your 
pension your 401k-- put it in one place: fidelity. Call today to roll 
over your eligible SS if that's okay with you, sir.
