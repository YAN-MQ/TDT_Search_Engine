Astronauts on the space shuttle "endeavor" are getting ready to start 
assembling the international space station. Today they'll unload the 
American-made segment they carried into orbit from the shuttle's cargo 
bay. They'll use the shuttle's 50-foot-long robot arm to do that. 
Tomorrow they'll connect it with the Russian-made zarya control Module 
that was put into orbit two weeks ago. The crew also will test spacesuits 
and jet-powered backpacks that will be needed during the station's 
construction.
