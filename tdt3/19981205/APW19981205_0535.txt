One after the other, men and women stepped up to a microphone Saturday 
in a community center and in clear voices announced: ``I am HIV positive.'' 
The disclosures were greeted by clapping and cheering. Members of 
the crowd of 150 often left their seats to hug the speakers. Most 
of the 3 million South Africans with AIDS or its precursor, HIV, would 
not receive such a warm reception after disclosing that they are infected. 
The tiny minority who do are often fired from their jobs, hounded 
from their homes, treated as outcasts. Untold numbers go to the grave 
with their secret. The reaction was different at the community center 
because many in the crowd have HIV or AIDS. The gathering, sponsored 
by the National Association of People Living With HIV/AIDS, is meant 
to help remove the stigma from the disease and give the unfolding 
tragedy a human face. It was among the first of many such gatherings 
that officials hope to hold across South Africa. A recent similar 
gathering in KwaZulu-Natal province, where an estimated 25 percent 
of adults are infected, drew 1,000 people. South Africa is only now 
beginning to confront the disease that has made its way from central 
Africa around the world and is now exploding like a bomb in southern 
Africa. Every day, 1,500 South Africans become infected. By the end 
of the year, 168,000 more South Africans will have died from AIDS. 
Often, relatives say the person died of some other disease. This week, 
President Nelson Mandela denounced ``the silence that hangs over our 
cemeteries when we bury loved ones knowing they died of AIDS, but 
not speaking of it.'' AIDS sufferers are stigmatized because the disease 
_ which in Africa is most commonly transmitted by heterosexual sex 
_ is associated with promiscuity and death, and because many people 
wrongly believe they can contract AIDS by being near an HIV-positive 
person, said Liz Floyd, who runs the Johannesburg area health department's 
AIDS program. Sekgametsi More, a social worker at Johannesburg Hospital, 
said most people with HIV whom she has counseled have been shunned. 
Only a few days ago, More told a young woman that her HIV test was 
positive. The previous day, the woman had been fired from her job 
as a live-in maid because her employer that suspected the woman _ 
who had been constantly sick because her immune system was depressed 
_ had AIDS. The woman had been monogamous and was apparently infected 
by her boyfriend. The relationship has ended. ``When we told her she 
was HIV positive, it was terrible for her,'' More said. ``Now she 
knew she had this disease, plus she had no job and no place to live.'' 
At Saturday's gathering in the black township of Soweto, people spoke 
of receiving the double blow of finding out they had HIV, then being 
shunned. Joyce Malope, 27, discovered she was HIV positive in 1994, 
soon after she was raped. ``My husband dumped me after he kept telling 
me I was going to die,'' she told a reporter. ``I tried to commit 
suicide because I had no one to turn to.'' She was then directed to 
a counselor, who taught her to ``try to live with AIDS rather than 
thinking my life was already over.'' After dozens of people had spoken 
of their illness, the crowd began dancing to reggae music. Looking 
on, Floyd said she hoped many more such encounters could be held, 
and that more people would come to them. ``It's absolutely critical 
for this society to come to grips with the epidemic,'' she said. ``If 
people keep it under wraps _ if you don't meet the people who have 
it, it's very difficult to believe it is real.''
