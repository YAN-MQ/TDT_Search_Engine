Matt Yallof, "CNN Headline Sports." Scary scene at the vet in Philadelphia. 
During the fourth quarter of the army/Navy game, a guardrail gave 
way, sending roughly a dozen army cadets 15 feet to the artificial 
Turf. The game was delayed, as ambulances took the injured to local 
hospitals in philadelphia. The extent of the injuries not yet known.

Navy, diminished rightfully so.
