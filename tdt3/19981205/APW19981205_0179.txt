BRUSSELS, Belgium (AP) - Around 700 French NATO troops will leave 
for Macedonia on Sunday as part of a back-up force for international 
peace monitors in neighboring Kosovo. A NATO official, who spoke on 
condition of anonymity said, NATO ambassadors gave the activation 
order late Friday to send the so-called extraction forces to Macedonia. 
``The French have to move first since they have to constitute headquarters,'' 
the NATO official said. A NATO statement said the force will comprise 
about 1,500 troops. Around 300 British troops, and about 200 or so 
each from Germany, Italy and the Netherlands will join their French 
counterparts over the next two weeks, the NATO official said. About 
180 people, part of the back-up force, are already in Macedonia, doing 
preparatory work for the deployment. Under a U.S.-led initiative and 
warnings of NATO air strikes, Yugoslav President Slobodan Milosevic 
recently agreed to pull out some of his government forces from Kosovo, 
the violence-torn Albanian-majority province of Serbia, Yugoslavia's 
dominant republic. Milosevic also agreed to allow personnel of the 
Organization for Security and Cooperation in Europe to verify compliance 
on the ground. The NATO-led force to be stationed in Macedonia would 
evacuate the verifiers, should they run into trouble. But the NATO 
statement released Saturday warned Belgrade that its back-up force 
'in no way relieves the Federal Republic of Yugoslavia government 
of its primary responsibility for the safety and security of the OSCE 
verifiers deployed in Kosovo.'
