The new chairman of the house panel on social security says the two 
parties need to work together to save the system. In the weekly GOP 
radio address, representative clay Shaw of Florida called social security 
one of the best things about America. But he says it's headed for 
a crisis when the baby boom generation retires. He's calling on President 
Clinton to provide leadership. When the president convenes his historic 
White House summit, we are hopeful that he will present to us and 
the nation a specific plan on how best to strengthen social security. 
That's how social security reform always began in the past. And we 
agree with the president that we should save social security first. 
President Clinton will meet Tuesday with Shaw and other members of 
Congress to discuss ways to strengthen social security.
