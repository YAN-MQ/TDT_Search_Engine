Israeli coast guards fired on Lebanese fishing boats in the southern 
port city of Tyre Saturday, slightly wounding a fisherman, security 
officials said. The Israeli navy routinely patrols southern Lebanese 
waters to guard against sea attacks by Lebanese guerrillas. The activity 
increases with the escalation of guerrilla operations against Israelis 
and their allied South Lebanese Army on the ground. Lebanese security 
officials said a fisherman, Hassan Seknani, 27, was hit in his right 
arm and taken to a Tyre hospital for treatment. Tyre, on the Mediterranean, 
30 kilometers (18 miles) north of the Israeli border, has been under 
``virtual siege'' by Israeli gunboats since Friday, said the officials, 
speaking on condition of anonymity. The firing on the fishing boats 
came as Israeli warplanes flew low over several villages in the western 
Bekaa Valley just north of the Israeli-occupied enclave in southern 
Lebanon. Lebanese army and guerrilla anti-aircraft positions fired 
on the Israeli aircraft, said the officials. Also Friday, guerrillas 
of the Shiite Muslim Hezbollah group attacked an SLA outpost, wounding 
one of its fighters. The attack came in the wake of bombings by Israeli 
jets of suspected guerrilla bases in the south where the Israelis 
have been targeting suspected guerrilla location from the air almost 
daily since Nov. 8. Hezbollah is engaged in a guerrilla war to oust 
1,500 Israeli troops and 2,500 SLA militiamen from the south Lebanon 
security enclave that Israel established in 1985 to protect its northern 
border towns from cross-border guerrilla attacks.
