For years it was an eye sore. Now it's nourishing the body as and 
spirits of the a community. Cynthia Tornquist reports. In the heart 
of the south Bronx, one of the most congested and troubled urban areas 
in America, the taqwa community garden has become a Neighborhood symbol 
of pride. I like it because it's beautiful. And I like the vegetables 
because they taste good. The farm was started in 1991 by five neighbors 
in the highbridge section of Bronx, New York. They were fed up with 
drug activity and illegal dumping in a vacant lot, so they cleaned 
it and planted a small garden. We started thinking, wondering what 
we could do to bring some change to the community. So we agreed that 
a garden would be a good thing. Today, more than 0 local families 
tend the farm. It is also a place where youngsters learn about nature. 
These children are getting a lesson in hydroponics -- the cultivation 
of plants in water rather than in soil. You deal directly with the 
roots, only the roots. You can clean the roots and put it back. This 
is the best. Nearly 2,500 pounds of fresh produce was harvested this 
past year, feeding gardeners and struggling families in the community. 
There is a lack of access to fresh nutritious produce in a lot of 
these neighborhoods. And the food that's grown here in taqwa is far 
superior in quality and nutritional value to what you can find in 
the local supermarkets. For their achievement, abu talib and the young 
people of the south Bronx who helped build the taqwa community garden 
have been honored as the 1998 national winners of the John Deere kids 
seeds of hope award. There's an old slogan. They say, "he who controls 
your bread basket controls your destiny." The pride the children reap 
from this community effort will stay with them a lifetime. Cynthia 
Tornquist, CNN, New York.
