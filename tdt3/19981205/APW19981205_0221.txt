An internationally acclaimed Indian film about lesbian love has been 
pulled from theaters and sent back to cinema censors after Hindu right-wing 
protesters stormed theaters, shredded posters and disrupted screenings, 
a minister said Saturday. ``The film has been sent back for recertifying 
to the censor board. We will wait for their comments,'' junior Information 
and Broadcasting Minister Mukhtar Abbas Naqvi was quoted as saying 
by Press Trust of India. Naqvi's Hindu nationalist Bharatiya Janata 
Party leads the federal coalition. The protesters belonged to its 
right-wing ally Shiv Sena, which governs the western Maharashtra state. 
Shiv Sena activists stormed into theaters in Bombay, capital of Maharashtra, 
New Delhi and other cities over the past week, trying to stop showings 
of ``Fire.'' They call its sexual content an affront to Hindu values. 
``I am not supporting or justifying the violence. The perpetrators 
of the violence will be punished,'' minister Naqvi was quoted as saying. 
Leading theater and cinema figures Friday petitioned President K.R. 
Narayanan against the attacks, and activists said they had more to 
do with politics than protecting Indian values. ``I think ``Fire'' 
is being used by different people for different ends,'' the film's 
director, Canada-based Deepa Mehta, told the private STAR television 
network Saturday. Its lead actress Shabana Azmi, also a left-leaning 
social activist, is a lawmaker in the upper house of parliament, where 
opposition members made noisy protests this week about the attacks. 
``Fire'' is the story of women in unhappy marriages to two brothers 
living in New Delhi in what is called a joint family _ the brothers, 
both their wives and their mother under one roof. The sisters-in-law, 
seeking comfort, develop a lesbian relationship. The film tackles 
issues rarely addressed in India, including the unhappiness of women 
in traditional families who are expected to suppress their desires 
while serving their men and their elders. The film, with its scenes 
of two women kissing and a brief full-frontal nude shot, was expected 
to create ripples in conservative India. But ``Fire'' ran to packed 
houses for three weeks, causing only a smattering of protests from 
social organizations and women's groups, before the Shiv Sena began 
its violent campaign against the film.
