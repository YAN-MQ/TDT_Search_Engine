Things were odd enough here when the roses started blooming in December. 
But then the White House started complaining that people were not 
paying enough attention to the possible impeachment of President Clinton. 
``People aren't taking it seriously,'' fumed Joseph Lockhart, the 
White House press secretary. Indeed, they are not. The House of Representatives 
may be gearing up to vote as early as midmonth on the impeachment 
of a president _ for only the second time in history _ but history 
does not exactly hang heavy on the air. ``What are you talking about?'' 
asked Patrick Sabatier, the U.S. bureau chief for the French newspaper 
Liberation, when asked whether he thought Americans were paying sufficient 
attention to the weighty doings. ``The NBA lockout?'' After 10 months 
of hype, the impeachment hearings are drawing mostly shrugs and yawns 
from Washington's mandarins: political operatives, journalists, lawyers, 
lobbyists and even Clinton administration officials. Chastened by 
the Democrats' strong showing in the midterm elections, elite Washington 
appears to have caught up with the views held by most Americans for 
months. Not everyone is indifferent. Many conservatives in Congress 
are bent on impeachment. And as a result, the strategists who are 
paid to be terrified for Clinton worry that while Washington rolls 
its eyes, the House may actually vote against him. The Senate would 
then try him, a potentially lengthy process that would require a two-thirds 
vote to remove him from office. But there are few outward signs of 
this inward turmoil. No candlelight vigils flicker outside the White 
House, no horns honk in demand of the president's resignation _ the 
hallmarks of an uprising that Leonard Garment remembers from his days 
as counsel to President Richard Nixon. ``So what else? Who cares?'' 
said Garment, a lawyer here, as he described the current attitude. 
``That's the general sentiment.'' A lone sign-toting protester who 
appeared outside the White House last week was gone by Friday, when 
Cassie Waite, 15, jostled with her ninth-grade government class for 
a smiling photograph against the tall iron fence. Visiting from McKeesport, 
Pa., she had expected to see at least some demonstrators handing out 
leaflets, but instead saw only badged government workers and tourists 
strolling. ``It's on the news constantly, and it makes it seem like 
everything's going on here,'' Cassie said. ``And we get here _ and 
there's nothing. People are going on about their lives.'' She paused 
and although, moments before, she had been criticizing Clinton as 
a lawbreaker, added, ``And I think that's the way it should be.'' 
She was, she said, ``sick of hearing about it.'' Before a reporter 
raised it, the subject of impeachment hearings had simply not come 
up during the government class's visit to Washington, said Cassie's 
teacher, Ray Beard. ``The overall feeling of the students is not to 
be bothered discussing Clinton's problems,'' he said. On the other 
side of the fence, one official said he and his colleagues were not 
following the hearings. It was as though, he said, ``there's something 
you don't want to watch on your favorite channel but you know it'll 
be over. Every now and then you flip over to see: `Hey, is that thing 
off yet? C'mon already.''' Among some officials, the mood is light 
enough that they are literally dancing in the halls. At the senior 
staff meeting at the White House on Friday morning, Gene Sperling, 
the director of the National Economic Council, and Janet Yellen, the 
chairwoman of the Council of Economic Advisers, used a novel approach 
to announce that unemployment had dropped to 4.4 percent in November: 
They stood up, put their hands over their heads and spun around in 
a synchronized shimmy that one White House official called ``The Nerd.'' 
But for the strategists who are trying to devise Clinton's legal and 
political defense, impeachment is a darkening cloud. ``It's eerie,'' 
a senior White House official said of the environment in Washington. 
Few are taking the hearings seriously, he said, but ``next week we're 
going to have these final days, and it's going to be very reality-based 
in this country that this is happening.'' Lockhart, the press secretary, 
described the attitude in Washington as ``kind of suspended disbelief.'' 
``They'll wake up and they'll find out that their elected representatives 
have for reasons well short of legitimate moved to take a step to 
remove the president,'' he said. Tom Korologos, a Republican operative 
who was Nixon's Senate liaison, said that as the House impeachment 
vote drew close in 1974 the Senate had already devised exacting plans 
for its subsequent duties. Nixon resigned before the House vote, after 
becoming convinced that the Senate would convict him. ``I don't have 
the sense that anybody is taking it that seriously at the moment,'' 
Korologos said. ``It could sneak up on them really quick.'' Several 
causes lie behind federal Washington's new indifference: fatigue from 
multiple, mutating investigations; resignation in the face of the 
public's defiant liking for Clinton; a belief that no stirring revelations 
are in the offing, impatience with the bewildering swerves by the 
hearings and the president's defenders. So when the unpleasant subject 
of the hearings comes up _ and this is not often _ Washington's wealthy 
and powerful cluck and invoke Marx, saying history is repeating itself 
as farce. Those who are more knowing wonder how many more times it 
might repeat itself this way in the future, with these hearings as 
the new precedent. The issues that provoked this clash between the 
executive and legislative branches are less threatening to the Constitution 
than those in Watergate, say some who lived through both. ``There 
was a sense of awe and of great drama,'' recalled Elizabeth Drew, 
a journalist who covered Watergate for The New Yorker. Now, she said, 
``the issues involved are nowhere near the scale.'' Terry Eastland, 
the publisher of the American Spectator, said people simply did not 
want to follow a story when they thought they knew the end, and they 
believed that the Senate would not convict Clinton. Garment, the lawyer, 
saw something deeper, an anesthesia and amnesia producing a ``dazed 
Disneyland'' in modern politics. ``The end of the Cold War ended a 
sense of apprehension that major political events can affect our lives 
in a very serious way,'' he said. ``There's a collapse of a sort of 
emotional memory about vital, energetic, pointed, pungent politics. 
It's just all games, dirty jokes.''
