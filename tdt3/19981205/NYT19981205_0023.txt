Most of the suspects hauled into the treacherous confines of the criminal 
justice system are guilty. They are not all treated fairly, but for 
the most part they have committed the crimes for which they are prosecuted. 
But some are innocent. And the system _ a huge, grinding bureaucracy 
dominated by politicians and other officials anxious to show they 
are tougher than Dirty Harry _ does a terrible job of identifying 
and protecting them. As a prosecutor in New Jersey once told me: ``I 
can't go to the voters and tell them the evidence is ambiguous. When 
a crime is committed, somebody has got to pay. Most of the time we 
get the right guy.'' Prosecutors want to hear the word, ``guilty.'' 
They don't want to hear, ``You've got the wrong man, or the wrong 
woman, or the wrong kid.'' So you get cases like that of Lacresha 
Murray, an 11-year-old girl who was arrested and subsequently tried, 
convicted and sentenced to 25 years in prison for the beating death 
of a 2{-year-old girl, despite the absence of any witnesses or physical 
evidence linking her to the crime, and despite the strong likelihood 
that she was physically incapable of inflicting the fatal injury, 
namely the splitting of the child's liver. The New York Times, in 
an editorial Friday on the Sam Sheppard case, referred to the ``evil 
of a legal system when it is blind to innocence.'' In that case, despite 
DNA evidence indicating another man killed Sheppard's wife, the prosecution 
continues to fight efforts to exonerate Sheppard. ``Rarely,'' the 
editorial said, ``do prosecutors admit that devastating mistakes were 
made even in cases decades old.'' Lacresha's first conviction was 
overturned by the trial judge, John Dietz, who said, ``I had a question 
as to whether justice was done.'' In the period between the first 
and second trials, the prosecution produced an ``expert,'' Dr. Vincent 
DiMaio, who looked at photos of the dead child, Jayla Belton, and 
determined that certain bruises ``matched'' the tread on tennis shoes 
worn by Lacresha. No mention of the tennis shoes had been made at 
the first trial. None whatsoever. Prosecutors acknowledged during 
interviews on Thursday that they had no idea the tennis shoes might 
have been involved until DiMaio declared, ``Here is your murder weapon.'' 
The doctor's testimony at the second trial was crucial because officials 
at the state crime lab said they could see no match and declined to 
testify. It would later be revealed that DiMaio's idea of a match 
differs from that of the average person. In a letter to Keith Hampton, 
the lawyer who is handling Lacresha's appeal, DiMaio explained what 
he meant by a match. The letter is quoted in Hampton's appellant's 
brief. ``While a match may be unique, as in the case of a fingerprint, 
it does not have to be,'' DiMaio wrote. ``The analogy that I gave 
was that if a convenience store was robbed by two individuals described 
as `white males,' then both White (a colleague of Hampton's) and you 
`matched' that description because you both were white males.'' Got 
that? If two white guys held up a store, any two white guys would 
constitute a ``match'' of the holdupmen. This is the kind of kindling 
that blazes into miscarriages of justice. The jurors were never made 
aware of DiMaio's incredibly broad definition of a match. When I asked 
Ronnie Earle, the district attorney of Travis County, and several 
of his assistants if they had known about DiMaio's analogy, they expressed 
puzzlement. They apparently had never heard it. One of the assistants 
continues to refer to the sneakers and the bruises as ``a perfect 
match.'' I recently asked Dietz if, after presiding over two trials, 
he was convinced that Lacresha Murray was guilty. There was a long 
pause. And then the judge said he didn't think he should answer because 
the case is still on appeal. He acknowledged, however, that the case 
bothered him. He noted, among other things, that Derrick Shaw, Jayla's 
stepfather, ``was not a paragon of virtue, and neither was the mother.'' 
Referring to the fact that Jayla weighed only about 20 pounds, the 
judge said: ``It wasn't just that she was small. I just don't think 
she was being cared for very well. But anyway.''
