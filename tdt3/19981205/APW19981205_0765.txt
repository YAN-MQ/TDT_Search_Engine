Hundreds of fans rampaged Saturday before and after a Greek league 
match between defending champion Olympiakos and archrival Panathinaikos. 
Private Mega television showed fans smashing cars, attacking police 
and ripping up seats inside Athens' Olympic Stadium. At least 10 people 
were injured in the violence, including a police motorcycle officer 
and passengers in a taxi who were pulled out and beaten while the 
cab was smashed and looted, reports said. No arrests were reported. 
Olympiakos rallied from a two-goal deficit to win the game 4-2.
