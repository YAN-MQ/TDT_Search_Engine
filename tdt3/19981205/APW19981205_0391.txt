After a week of dizzying political change, the grandiose vision of 
postwar Lebanon as a Middle East business hub has given way to the 
pragmatic search for solutions to mounting economic problems. While 
new Prime Minister Salim Hoss has pledged to continue predecessor 
Rafik Hariri's pet program to rebuild the country devastated by the 
1975-90 civil war, he has also vowed to control the nation's purse 
strings tightly. The new Cabinet, which held its first meeting Saturday, 
is also more interested in cleaning up corruption in government and 
bringing down the 40 percent to 50 percent budget deficit. Hariri, 
a billionaire businessman, quit unexpectedly last week in an apparent 
power struggle with new President Emile Lahoud. While no one is suggesting 
that reconstruction should stop, it is clear that the new Cabinet 
will concentrate on practical spending and prudent investment in productive 
projects. Hariri's theme of build, build and build has been replaced 
by Hoss' ``austerity in the extreme,'' meaning that the tenacious 
business spirit nurtured by Hariri has gone with him. Hoss, a U.S.-educated 
economist, is widely respected for his modesty and calculating moves. 
But he lacks the flamboyant style and international connections of 
the globe-trotting Hariri, a construction magnate. ``We should not 
forget that Hariri's stature in the country, the region and on the 
international scene is quite big,'' political analyst Sarkis Naoum 
said in a television interview. He credited Hariri with building the 
infrastructure _ roads, telephones, water and electricity _ necessary 
to attract business and investment. But Hariri's amassing of real 
estate and businesses in Lebanon has attracted criticism, eroding 
the admiration he won for charity work before plunging into politics. 
Resentment also grew over his lifestyle: weekend trips to Paris and 
frequent visits elsewhere abroad, even if at his own expense, including 
one to Iran, when he carted back a dlrs 1 million load of Persian 
carpets. This lavish picture contrasted painfully with stories of 
Lebanese struggling to make ends meet as the spiraling cost of living 
made Beirut one of the most expensive cities in the Middle East. ``He 
gave the country concrete structures and many kilometers of roads 
but no plan or scheme for where they were leading,'' the independent 
English-language Daily Star wrote in an editorial. Hariri's government 
borrowed from local banks and on the international market to finance 
projects, pushing the national debt to an unprecedented dlrs 16 billion 
in just a few years. Critics have argued that some projects, like 
the dlrs 475 million new airport terminal and a planned palace of 
congresses, are unnecessary when the country faces such a serious 
resource crunch. But as Hariri bowed out, he took credit for leaving 
a country prepared to take care of itself. The fact that the Lebanese 
pound remained stable despite his resignation is a ``a sign that I 
have succeeded with distinction,'' he said.
