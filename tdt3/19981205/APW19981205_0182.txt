Russia's foreign trade is shrinking as a result of the economic crisis 
it could take up to four years to return to last year's level, the 
minister for trade said Saturday. Trade Minister Georgy Gabunia told 
an international economic forum that Russia's foreign trade turnover 
was currently at the 1995 level, and will amount to 83-84 percent 
of the trade level of 1997, the Interfax news agency reported. He 
blamed the decline on the economic crisis, which hit Russia in August 
and has clogged the banking system, and the crisis in Asian economies 
last year. Gabunia said even when the situation stabilizes, foreign 
trade will grow at just 3-4 percent a year, and return to the 1997 
levels only in 2002 or 2003. He said that in order to strengthen Russia's 
role in world trade, the government must change customs legislation 
and simplify import and export procedures to attract investors.
