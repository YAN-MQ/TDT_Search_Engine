Post-Apocalypse, when Muhammad Ali's old fight videos become the graven 
images of a new religion based on individual reinvention, one of the 
sacred texts will surely be David Remnick's ``King of the World,'' 
a shrewd and lively retelling of Cassius Clay's two fights with Sonny 
Liston. For now, the book should solve plenty of holiday gift-giving 
problems, certainly among sports fans, Ali fans, '60s fans, boomers 
in general. ``Ali is an American myth,'' writes Remnick in his epilogue, 
``who has come to mean many things to many people: a symbol of faith, 
a symbol of conviction and defiance, a symbol of beauty and skill 
and courage, a symbol of racial pride, of wit and love.'' Even in 
decline, Ali is symbolic; now he mirrors our fears of aging, of falling 
ill, of being vulnerable, writes Remnick, ``to the unpredictability 
and danger of life.'' It is this relentless symbolism that makes Ali 
both a seemingly accessible object of almost universal adoration and 
a tantalizingly remote human being. Other than his best friend, the 
photographer Howard Bingham, no one seems to have stayed close to 
Ali for a long time unless there was money involved. At 56, he is 
married to his fourth wife. The Ali that we think we know _ the crowd-pleasing, 
crowd-displeasing, always crowd-assembling entertainer and moral prism 
_ may actually be, by now, who he really is. That persona took form 
in the two main years of Remnick's book, 1964 and 1965, in which Ali 
first began to ``shake up the world.'' It was during those two years 
that Cassius Clay, the classic artist-athlete, passionately devoted 
to his craft and to his career, began to transcend boxing, the sport 
he briefly ennobled and then left seamier than ever, if only by comparison. 
A champion at 22 (though much younger in many ways), Ali was shaped 
by attention, controversy, scorn; there was more time to become a 
world figure than a fully realized person. But he was clearly a person 
of his time. Remnick sets the early '60s scene of racial change and 
confusion, in which the model of the black athlete with which whites 
were comfortable _ Joe Louis _ was no longer in stock. And the new 
version, Floyd Patterson _ a troubled youth salvaged by public school 
psychologists and a father-figure manager, a grateful Christian, an 
integrationist _ wasn't really a full-fledged heavyweight. His humiliating 
defeats by Sonny Liston, who was depicted by the press as the stereotypical 
``Bad Negro,'' became a national problem, for the NAACP, for Frank 
Sinatra, for liberals, for boxing. Enter Cassius Clay, Olympic light-heavyweight 
champion, handsome, extroverted, ingratiating. Boxing hyped him because 
he was, literally, fresh blood. Most of the press treated him contemptuously, 
but at length, because he was easy copy. (Remnick's treatment of the 
leading sports columnists of the time is cool, fair and devastating). 
Clay was handed a decision he did not deserve (against Doug Jones) 
so that he could go on to a title shot at 7-1 odds. The traditionalists 
who dubbed him braggart and clown did not think he was ultimately 
much better for the game than was Liston, but the kid had the cross-over 
appeal to boost the closed-circuit gate. Few recognized that he was 
the real goods, as a boxer and as a seeker. Once he became champion, 
he began to reinvent the title and himself. The heavyweight champion, 
Mr. Man, had tended to be a thug (John L. Sullivan, Jack Dempsey, 
Liston) or a defender of the faith (Gene Tunney, Louis, Patterson). 
The rare individualist, such as Jack Johnson, was isolated and discarded. 
Ali not only challenged white, Christian America, but replaced its 
values. He discarded Christianity, the local plantation folk who originally 
sponsored him as a pro and the customary rituals of his title, including 
joining the Army to cheerlead the troops. Having built him up, establishment 
America had to strip him of his title and deny him corporate endorsement 
to try to break him down. But by the time the antiwar movement and 
Howard Cosell caught up with Ali, the ``white power structure'' was 
stuck with him. For all that we know about Ali, and ``King of the 
World'' smartly packages those critical two years, there are still 
mysterious pockets. We could know so much more about the fascinating 
infusions of fearfulness and self-confidence he received at home. 
What emotional needs were served by the Nation of Islam that did not 
come from boxing or the civil-rights movement? How could he have betrayed 
Malcolm for Elijah Muhammad? And now, trapped in the prison of Parkinson's 
disease, is he truly as serene a soul as he seems when he says: ``God's 
showing me that I'm just a man like everyone else. Showing you, too. 
You can learn from me that way.'' Then again, perhaps all we need 
to know right now is from one old enemy. ``I came to love Ali,'' Patterson 
told Remnick. ``I came to see that I was a fighter and he was history.''
