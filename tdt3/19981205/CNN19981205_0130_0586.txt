The world's largest tobacco company, Philip Morris, is launching a 
major campaign to combat teen smoking. Critics are raising doubts 
that it will work and are questioning the company's motives. Deborah 
feyerick reports. This ad is aimed at teenagers. Its message -- smoking 
doesn't make you cool. We don't have to smoke to be different. Being 
ourselves is enough. Tobacco giant Philip Morris is shelling out $100 
million over and above the money set aside under the tobacco settlement 
for anti-smoking education. This is one of three commercials scheduled 
to hit air Monday. But will it work? These New York City high school 
students have their doubts. These ads, like, kids are right now, if 
they're going to smoke, they're gonna want to. It's part of their 
personality. If they want to fall in with the crowd that smokes, they're 
gonna do it. The cigarette -- like, the commercials aren't going to 
do anything to them. Teen smoking is on the rise, with more than 3,000 
kids every day lighting up for the first time, according to figures 
from the centers for disease control. Reasons include -- peer pressure, 
wanting to look grown up and being cool. That's a serious challenge. 
But not when it comes down to dealing with another person that confronting 
you with smoking, it's not enough. Philip Morris says the new campaign 
is designed to help prevent kids from starting to smoke. But in a 
statement, the company also says it's in the best interests of its 
employees, consumers and shareholders. Advertising experts say the 
campaign also help's the tobacco company's tarnished image. Philip 
Morris has an opportunity to make themselves look a little better 
with coming -- with a campaign that's going to be anti-tobacco. Critics 
of the tobacco industry say if Philip Morris was really serious about 
getting teens to quit, they would get rid of the Marlboro man, one 
of the most popular images with young smokers. Most kids don't want 
to be like other kids, they want to be like the cool adults. As for 
the overall message of these ads, these teens say, they are more effective 
than past efforts, but they still miss the boat. And I know my friends 
aren't going to be encouraged by a commercial telling them not and 
giving them reasons not to. It's their own decision. And if they stop, 
then maybe I'll stop. And that will likely take more than a few commercials.
