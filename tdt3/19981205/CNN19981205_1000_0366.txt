Another member of the Hoffa family could become president of the teamsters 
union. With all the votes counted from the eastern and southern regions 
of the country, James P Hoffa has taken the head of the vote. He's 
the son of Jimmy Hoffa. The federal government is supervising this 
election as part of a 1989 deal aimed at getting rid of mob influence. 
Election officials hope to finish counting ballots by Monday.
